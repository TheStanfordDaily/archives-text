# EDUCATION AT STANFORD
## Dogmatism, Scepticism And Criticism 
### EVE BAKER JONATHAN KETCHUM 
(Editor's note: This is the ninth in a
leisurely series of articles on education
at Stanford.)

Whenever we try to study anything
deeply, we encounter not only the sub
ject we are studying, but also a variety
of attitudes towards it, some of them in
conflict. First, we see these attitudes in
others; later, if we pay attention, we may
also come to see them in ourselves.
A university scholar, whether student
or teacher, ought to study both subject
matter and attitudes—including his own.
An institution which lacks reflection on
attitudes may be a trade school, and a
good one, but it is not a university.
Three attitudes towards knowledge
have commanded special attention in our
society since the beginning of the en
lightenment: dogmatism, scepticism, and
criticism.
The dogmatist asserts his values with
out self-examination. The sceptic at
tempts to throw everything into doubt.
The critic (in this special sense) tries to
arbitrate between the first two positions,
attempting to preserve the positive val
ues in the first, while honoring the
doubts of the second.
Dogma and Dogmatism
Though it may seem like splitting
hairs, the distinction between dogma and
dogmatism is traditional and important.
'Dogma' means 'doctrine' or 'teach
ing'; it refers to an-accepted body of
knowledge. Hut the foundations of that
knowledge are stated, and it is made
clear that the body of knowledge is only
as valid as its foundations. Mathematics
and physics are taught in this sense dog
matically, and they are open to question
and revision.
'Dogmatism' refers to an attitude, not.
to a body of knowledge. It is the attitude
which takes it for granted, either openly
or tacitly, that the dogma taught is

somehow beyond criticism. It was des
cribed in an earlier articles in this se
ries, "Dogmatism in the University."
Methods of Dogmatism
The dogmatist attempts to remove
himself and his teaching from open criti
cism by such characteristic methods as
evasion, authoritarianism, and polemic.
The evasive dogmatist always post
pones answers to challenging questions.
"I will come to that later."—Much, much
later. "We cannot go into these com
plexities. "We don't have time for that."
"That's beside the point."
The authoritarian dogmatist raises his
hackles when the student "stubbornly"
refuses evasion. "Which one of us is
teaching this class?" "When you are my
age, . . ." More gently, "It is generally
agreed that . . or, in strong form,
"As any fool can plainly see."
The polemic dogmatist refuses to un
derstand the student's objections, placing
the responsibility for the misunderstand
ing on the student. "I can't understand a
word you say." "You're being too vague."
—or too long, too brief, too esoteric.
Advanced Dogmat ism
A perservering ("stubborn") student
may be able to fight his way through
these elementary methods; but the ac
complished dogmatist has three more
weapons guaranteed to silence all but
the most formidable critics.
The first is downright dismissal,
which can be supported by massive ap
peal to authority. "We've heard quite
enough of your views, thank you."
That method, however, is likely to
raise resentment in other students, and
the more resourceful dogmatist will par
ry his critic with the baffling statement,
"Fundamentally, we're in complete
agreement."
Finally, if both those methods fail, the
dogmatist can weld evasion, authoritari
anism, and polemics together, and try to
disarm the critic completely with an
statement, "You are being hopelessly
dogmatic."

Characteristic of all forms of dogma
tism is refusal of encounter; if the dog
matist professes his openness at the
same time, he is open to the charge of
hypocrisy.
But the dogmatist may also have a
change of heart, and try to accept the
challenge. He must then doubt his own
position as well as that of his critic, and
can become some kind of sceptic.
The weakest form of se«pticism sprin
kles a little doubt over a dogmatistic
dish, just for seasoning. "We will never
know the final answers." "We have to
start somewhere."
A stronger form of scepticism, also
usable as a disguise for dogmatism, is
the famous statement, "It's all relative."
—excepting, of course, the statement it
self. Relativism can sink further into
cynicism: "It's all a game."
From Scepticism to Criticism
Only the strongest form of scepticism
commands any lasting respect. That is
radical or universal scepticism, which
doubts everything, even the doubt and
the very identity of the doubter.
The radical sceptic feels an acute need
for his former dogma. If he does not
turn back from doubting everything,
even the value of his own existence, how
how will he even preserve his sanity?
This is the very question which gave
rise to the idea to critical thought: how
can the sceptic preserve his inquiry with
out destroying himself?
Critical thought, criticism in this
sense, must therefore preserve the right
and obligation to doubt; that preserves
its scepticism. But it must also find a
way to retain some values; it must pro
duce a dogma without dogmatism.
Criticism is therefore negative, insofar
as it attacks dogmatism. But it is posi
tive insofar as it calls a halt, and not
an arbitrary halt, to scepticism.
The stopping point for scepticism (as
Kant put it forth) is reached by com
paring different attitudes towards the
same problem.

Suppose that you and I have gotten
into an argument about The Topic—re
ligion, morality, sex, education, or poli
tics. Suppose that we thought we were
in complete agreement on the basic is
sues when we started, but discovered
more and more disagreement as the con
versation went on.
Now suppose that we worked our way
through some of those forms of dogma
tism, and each of us have begun to
doubt our own convictions. We both rec
ognise that we cannot possibly both be
right. What now?
According to the negative aspect of
criticism, each of us must criticize him
self. I will recognise that, from your
viewpoint, there are contradictions in
mine; you recognize that from mine,
there are contradictions in both.
Then, we will either have to find a new
viewpoint which resolves all these con
tradictions, or keep the contradictions
alive, if we cannot find such a viewpoint
—or refuse encounter and sink back into
dogmatism.
If we cannot find a higher viewpoint,
and we do not want to sink back into
dogmatism, we will both have to act on
our best judgment with a kind of non
attachment: we must continue to make
practical decisions, but at the same time
keep looking for a possible resolution.
The Threat of Criticism
This non-attachment is at first very
unsettling. If we are accustomed to being
dogmatists, non-attachment not only
seems to be about to push us "off the
deep end," —as the dogmatist will re
mind us.
Self-criticism, then, retains an element
of the radical doubt of scepticism. But
it can also hold to the kernel of values
imbedded in dogmatism—hold, however,
with non-attachment.
One result of radical scepticism is to
make the familiar strange. Nothing can
be finally affirmed any more. Criticism
makes it possible to receive that strange
ness as a guest, not an enemy.

Methods of Dogmatism
The dogmatist attempts to remove
himself and his teaching from open criti
cism by such characteristic methods as
evasion, authoritarianism, and polemic.
The evasive dogmatist always post
pones answers to challenging questions.
"I will come to that later."—Much, much
later. "We cannot go into these com
plexities. "We don't have time for that."
"That's beside the point."
The authoritarian dogmatist raises his
hackles when the student "stubbornly"
refuses evasion. "Which one of us is
teaching this class?" "When you are my
age, . . ." More gently, "It is generally
agreed that . . or, in strong form,
"As any fool can plainly see."
The polemic dogmatist refuses to un
derstand the student's objections, placing
the responsibility for the misunderstand
ing on the student. "I can't understand a
word you say." "You're being too vague."
—or too long, too brief, too esoteric.
Advanced Dogmat ism
A perservering ("stubborn") student
may be able to fight his way through
these elementary methods; but the ac
complished dogmatist has three more
weapons guaranteed to silence all but
the most formidable critics.
The first is downright dismissal,
which can be supported by massive ap
peal to authority. "We've heard quite
enough of your views, thank you."
That method, however, is likely to
raise resentment in other students, and
the more resourceful dogmatist will par
ry his critic with the baffling statement,
"Fundamentally, we're in complete
agreement."
Finally, if both those methods fail, the
dogmatist can weld evasion, authoritari
anism, and polemics together, and try to
disarm the critic completely with an
statement, "You are being hopelessly
dogmatic."

Characteristic of all forms of dogma
tism is refusal of encounter; if the dog
matist professes his openness at the
same time, he is open to the charge of
hypocrisy.
But the dogmatist may also have a
change of heart, and try to accept the
challenge. He must then doubt his own
position as well as that of his critic, and
can become some kind of sceptic.
The weakest form of se«pticism sprin
kles a little doubt over a dogmatistic
dish, just for seasoning. "We will never
know the final answers." "We have to
start somewhere."
A stronger form of scepticism, also
usable as a disguise for dogmatism, is
the famous statement, "It's all relative."
—excepting, of course, the statement it
self. Relativism can sink further into
cynicism: "It's all a game."
From Scepticism to Criticism
Only the strongest form of scepticism
commands any lasting respect. That is
radical or universal scepticism, which
doubts everything, even the doubt and
the very identity of the doubter.
The radical sceptic feels an acute need
for his former dogma. If he does not
turn back from doubting everything,
even the value of his own existence, how
how will he even preserve his sanity?
This is the very question which gave
rise to the idea to critical thought: how
can the sceptic preserve his inquiry with
out destroying himself?
Critical thought, criticism in this
sense, must therefore preserve the right
and obligation to doubt; that preserves
its scepticism. But it must also find a
way to retain some values; it must pro
duce a dogma without dogmatism.
Criticism is therefore negative, insofar
as it attacks dogmatism. But it is posi
tive insofar as it calls a halt, and not
an arbitrary halt, to scepticism.
The stopping point for scepticism (as
Kant put it forth) is reached by com
paring different attitudes towards the
same problem.

Suppose that you and I have gotten
into an argument about The Topic—re
ligion, morality, sex, education, or poli
tics. Suppose that we thought we were
in complete agreement on the basic is
sues when we started, but discovered
more and more disagreement as the con
versation went on.
Now suppose that we worked our way
through some of those forms of dogma
tism, and each of us have begun to
doubt our own convictions. We both rec
ognise that we cannot possibly both be
right. What now?
According to the negative aspect of
criticism, each of us must criticize him
self. I will recognise that, from your
viewpoint, there are contradictions in
mine; you recognize that from mine,
there are contradictions in both.
Then, we will either have to find a new
viewpoint which resolves all these con
tradictions, or keep the contradictions
alive, if we cannot find such a viewpoint
—or refuse encounter and sink back into
dogmatism.
If we cannot find a higher viewpoint,
and we do not want to sink back into
dogmatism, we will both have to act on
our best judgment with a kind of non
attachment: we must continue to make
practical decisions, but at the same time
keep looking for a possible resolution.
The Threat of Criticism
This non-attachment is at first very
unsettling. If we are accustomed to being
dogmatists, non-attachment not only
seems to be about to push us "off the
deep end," —as the dogmatist will re
mind us.
Self-criticism, then, retains an element
of the radical doubt of scepticism. But
it can also hold to the kernel of values
imbedded in dogmatism—hold, however,
with non-attachment.
One result of radical scepticism is to
make the familiar strange. Nothing can
be finally affirmed any more. Criticism
makes it possible to receive that strange
ness as a guest, not an enemy.

leisurely series of articles on education
at Stanford.)

Whenever we try to study anything
deeply, we encounter not only the sub
ject we are studying, but also a variety
of attitudes towards it, some of them in
conflict. First, we see these attitudes in
others; later, if we pay attention, we may
also come to see them in ourselves.
A university scholar, whether student
or teacher, ought to study both subject
matter and attitudes—including his own.
An institution which lacks reflection on
attitudes may be a trade school, and a
good one, but it is not a university.
Three attitudes towards knowledge
have commanded special attention in our
society since the beginning of the en
lightenment: dogmatism, scepticism, and
criticism.
The dogmatist asserts his values with
out self-examination. The sceptic at
tempts to throw everything into doubt.
The critic (in this special sense) tries to
arbitrate between the first two positions,
attempting to preserve the positive val
ues in the first, while honoring the
doubts of the second.
Dogma and Dogmatism
Though it may seem like splitting
hairs, the distinction between dogma and
dogmatism is traditional and important.
'Dogma' means 'doctrine' or 'teach
ing'; it refers to an-accepted body of
knowledge. Hut the foundations of that
knowledge are stated, and it is made
clear that the body of knowledge is only
as valid as its foundations. Mathematics
and physics are taught in this sense dog
matically, and they are open to question
and revision.
'Dogmatism' refers to an attitude, not.
to a body of knowledge. It is the attitude
which takes it for granted, either openly
or tacitly, that the dogma taught is

somehow beyond criticism. It was des
cribed in an earlier articles in this se
ries, "Dogmatism in the University."

tism is refusal of encounter; if the dog
matist professes his openness at the
same time, he is open to the charge of
hypocrisy.
But the dogmatist may also have a
change of heart, and try to accept the
challenge. He must then doubt his own
position as well as that of his critic, and
can become some kind of sceptic.
The weakest form of se«pticism sprin
kles a little doubt over a dogmatistic
dish, just for seasoning. "We will never
know the final answers." "We have to
start somewhere."
A stronger form of scepticism, also
usable as a disguise for dogmatism, is
the famous statement, "It's all relative."
—excepting, of course, the statement it
self. Relativism can sink further into
cynicism: "It's all a game."
From Scepticism to Criticism
Only the strongest form of scepticism
commands any lasting respect. That is
radical or universal scepticism, which
doubts everything, even the doubt and
the very identity of the doubter.
The radical sceptic feels an acute need
for his former dogma. If he does not
turn back from doubting everything,
even the value of his own existence, how
how will he even preserve his sanity?
This is the very question which gave
rise to the idea to critical thought: how
can the sceptic preserve his inquiry with
out destroying himself?
Critical thought, criticism in this
sense, must therefore preserve the right
and obligation to doubt; that preserves
its scepticism. But it must also find a
way to retain some values; it must pro
duce a dogma without dogmatism.
Criticism is therefore negative, insofar
as it attacks dogmatism. But it is posi
tive insofar as it calls a halt, and not
an arbitrary halt, to scepticism.
The stopping point for scepticism (as
Kant put it forth) is reached by com
paring different attitudes towards the
same problem.

Suppose that you and I have gotten
into an argument about The Topic—re
ligion, morality, sex, education, or poli
tics. Suppose that we thought we were
in complete agreement on the basic is
sues when we started, but discovered
more and more disagreement as the con
versation went on.
Now suppose that we worked our way
through some of those forms of dogma
tism, and each of us have begun to
doubt our own convictions. We both rec
ognise that we cannot possibly both be
right. What now?
According to the negative aspect of
criticism, each of us must criticize him
self. I will recognise that, from your
viewpoint, there are contradictions in
mine; you recognize that from mine,
there are contradictions in both.
Then, we will either have to find a new
viewpoint which resolves all these con
tradictions, or keep the contradictions
alive, if we cannot find such a viewpoint
—or refuse encounter and sink back into
dogmatism.
If we cannot find a higher viewpoint,
and we do not want to sink back into
dogmatism, we will both have to act on
our best judgment with a kind of non
attachment: we must continue to make
practical decisions, but at the same time
keep looking for a possible resolution.
The Threat of Criticism
This non-attachment is at first very
unsettling. If we are accustomed to being
dogmatists, non-attachment not only
seems to be about to push us "off the
deep end," —as the dogmatist will re
mind us.
Self-criticism, then, retains an element
of the radical doubt of scepticism. But
it can also hold to the kernel of values
imbedded in dogmatism—hold, however,
with non-attachment.
One result of radical scepticism is to
make the familiar strange. Nothing can
be finally affirmed any more. Criticism
makes it possible to receive that strange
ness as a guest, not an enemy.

leisurely series of articles on education

Whenever we try to study anything
deeply, we encounter not only the sub
ject we are studying, but also a variety
of attitudes towards it, some of them in
conflict. First, we see these attitudes in
others; later, if we pay attention, we may
also come to see them in ourselves.
A university scholar, whether student
or teacher, ought to study both subject
matter and attitudes—including his own.
An institution which lacks reflection on
attitudes may be a trade school, and a
good one, but it is not a university.
Three attitudes towards knowledge
have commanded special attention in our
society since the beginning of the en
lightenment: dogmatism, scepticism, and
criticism.
The dogmatist asserts his values with
out self-examination. The sceptic at
tempts to throw everything into doubt.
The critic (in this special sense) tries to
arbitrate between the first two positions,
attempting to preserve the positive val
ues in the first, while honoring the
doubts of the second.
Dogma and Dogmatism
Though it may seem like splitting
hairs, the distinction between dogma and
dogmatism is traditional and important.
'Dogma' means 'doctrine' or 'teach
ing'; it refers to an-accepted body of
knowledge. Hut the foundations of that
knowledge are stated, and it is made
clear that the body of knowledge is only
as valid as its foundations. Mathematics
and physics are taught in this sense dog
matically, and they are open to question
and revision.
'Dogmatism' refers to an attitude, not.
to a body of knowledge. It is the attitude
which takes it for granted, either openly
or tacitly, that the dogma taught is

somehow beyond criticism. It was des
cribed in an earlier articles in this se
ries, "Dogmatism in the University."
Methods of Dogmatism
The dogmatist attempts to remove
himself and his teaching from open criti
cism by such characteristic methods as
evasion, authoritarianism, and polemic.
The evasive dogmatist always post
pones answers to challenging questions.
"I will come to that later."—Much, much
later. "We cannot go into these com
plexities. "We don't have time for that."
"That's beside the point."
The authoritarian dogmatist raises his
hackles when the student "stubbornly"
refuses evasion. "Which one of us is
teaching this class?" "When you are my
age, . . ." More gently, "It is generally
agreed that . . or, in strong form,
"As any fool can plainly see."
The polemic dogmatist refuses to un
derstand the student's objections, placing
the responsibility for the misunderstand
ing on the student. "I can't understand a
word you say." "You're being too vague."
—or too long, too brief, too esoteric.
Advanced Dogmat ism
A perservering ("stubborn") student
may be able to fight his way through
these elementary methods; but the ac
complished dogmatist has three more
weapons guaranteed to silence all but
the most formidable critics.
The first is downright dismissal,
which can be supported by massive ap
peal to authority. "We've heard quite
enough of your views, thank you."
That method, however, is likely to
raise resentment in other students, and
the more resourceful dogmatist will par
ry his critic with the baffling statement,
"Fundamentally, we're in complete
agreement."
Finally, if both those methods fail, the
dogmatist can weld evasion, authoritari
anism, and polemics together, and try to
disarm the critic completely with an
statement, "You are being hopelessly
dogmatic."

into an argument about The Topic—re
ligion, morality, sex, education, or poli
tics. Suppose that we thought we were
in complete agreement on the basic is
sues when we started, but discovered
more and more disagreement as the con
versation went on.
Now suppose that we worked our way
through some of those forms of dogma
tism, and each of us have begun to
doubt our own convictions. We both rec
ognise that we cannot possibly both be
right. What now?
According to the negative aspect of
criticism, each of us must criticize him
self. I will recognise that, from your
viewpoint, there are contradictions in
mine; you recognize that from mine,
there are contradictions in both.
Then, we will either have to find a new
viewpoint which resolves all these con
tradictions, or keep the contradictions
alive, if we cannot find such a viewpoint
—or refuse encounter and sink back into
dogmatism.
If we cannot find a higher viewpoint,
and we do not want to sink back into
dogmatism, we will both have to act on
our best judgment with a kind of non
attachment: we must continue to make
practical decisions, but at the same time
keep looking for a possible resolution.
The Threat of Criticism
This non-attachment is at first very
unsettling. If we are accustomed to being
dogmatists, non-attachment not only
seems to be about to push us "off the
deep end," —as the dogmatist will re
mind us.
Self-criticism, then, retains an element
of the radical doubt of scepticism. But
it can also hold to the kernel of values
imbedded in dogmatism—hold, however,
with non-attachment.
One result of radical scepticism is to
make the familiar strange. Nothing can
be finally affirmed any more. Criticism
makes it possible to receive that strange
ness as a guest, not an enemy.

Whenever we try to study anything
deeply, we encounter not only the sub
ject we are studying, but also a variety
of attitudes towards it, some of them in
conflict. First, we see these attitudes in
others; later, if we pay attention, we may
also come to see them in ourselves.
A university scholar, whether student
or teacher, ought to study both subject
matter and attitudes—including his own.
An institution which lacks reflection on
attitudes may be a trade school, and a
good one, but it is not a university.
Three attitudes towards knowledge
have commanded special attention in our
society since the beginning of the en
lightenment: dogmatism, scepticism, and
criticism.
The dogmatist asserts his values with
out self-examination. The sceptic at
tempts to throw everything into doubt.
The critic (in this special sense) tries to
arbitrate between the first two positions,
attempting to preserve the positive val
ues in the first, while honoring the
doubts of the second.
Dogma and Dogmatism
Though it may seem like splitting
hairs, the distinction between dogma and
dogmatism is traditional and important.
'Dogma' means 'doctrine' or 'teach
ing'; it refers to an-accepted body of
knowledge. Hut the foundations of that
knowledge are stated, and it is made
clear that the body of knowledge is only
as valid as its foundations. Mathematics
and physics are taught in this sense dog
matically, and they are open to question
and revision.
'Dogmatism' refers to an attitude, not.
to a body of knowledge. It is the attitude
which takes it for granted, either openly
or tacitly, that the dogma taught is

somehow beyond criticism. It was des
cribed in an earlier articles in this se
ries, "Dogmatism in the University."
Methods of Dogmatism
The dogmatist attempts to remove
himself and his teaching from open criti
cism by such characteristic methods as
evasion, authoritarianism, and polemic.
The evasive dogmatist always post
pones answers to challenging questions.
"I will come to that later."—Much, much
later. "We cannot go into these com
plexities. "We don't have time for that."
"That's beside the point."
The authoritarian dogmatist raises his
hackles when the student "stubbornly"
refuses evasion. "Which one of us is
teaching this class?" "When you are my
age, . . ." More gently, "It is generally
agreed that . . or, in strong form,
"As any fool can plainly see."
The polemic dogmatist refuses to un
derstand the student's objections, placing
the responsibility for the misunderstand
ing on the student. "I can't understand a
word you say." "You're being too vague."
—or too long, too brief, too esoteric.
Advanced Dogmat ism
A perservering ("stubborn") student
may be able to fight his way through
these elementary methods; but the ac
complished dogmatist has three more
weapons guaranteed to silence all but
the most formidable critics.
The first is downright dismissal,
which can be supported by massive ap
peal to authority. "We've heard quite
enough of your views, thank you."
That method, however, is likely to
raise resentment in other students, and
the more resourceful dogmatist will par
ry his critic with the baffling statement,
"Fundamentally, we're in complete
agreement."
Finally, if both those methods fail, the
dogmatist can weld evasion, authoritari
anism, and polemics together, and try to
disarm the critic completely with an
statement, "You are being hopelessly
dogmatic."

Characteristic of all forms of dogma
tism is refusal of encounter; if the dog
matist professes his openness at the
same time, he is open to the charge of
hypocrisy.
But the dogmatist may also have a
change of heart, and try to accept the
challenge. He must then doubt his own
position as well as that of his critic, and
can become some kind of sceptic.
The weakest form of se«pticism sprin
kles a little doubt over a dogmatistic
dish, just for seasoning. "We will never
know the final answers." "We have to
start somewhere."
A stronger form of scepticism, also
usable as a disguise for dogmatism, is
the famous statement, "It's all relative."
—excepting, of course, the statement it
self. Relativism can sink further into
cynicism: "It's all a game."
From Scepticism to Criticism
Only the strongest form of scepticism
commands any lasting respect. That is
radical or universal scepticism, which
doubts everything, even the doubt and
the very identity of the doubter.
The radical sceptic feels an acute need
for his former dogma. If he does not
turn back from doubting everything,
even the value of his own existence, how
how will he even preserve his sanity?
This is the very question which gave
rise to the idea to critical thought: how
can the sceptic preserve his inquiry with
out destroying himself?
Critical thought, criticism in this
sense, must therefore preserve the right
and obligation to doubt; that preserves
its scepticism. But it must also find a
way to retain some values; it must pro
duce a dogma without dogmatism.
Criticism is therefore negative, insofar
as it attacks dogmatism. But it is posi
tive insofar as it calls a halt, and not
an arbitrary halt, to scepticism.
The stopping point for scepticism (as
Kant put it forth) is reached by com
paring different attitudes towards the
same problem.
