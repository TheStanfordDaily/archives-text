# VISTA Seeks Volunteers to Fight Compassionate War
## 
### 
"An organization that fights poverty with deeds, not
dole, needs tough and compassionate people," accord
ing to Glenn Ferguson, director of Volunteers in Service
to America.
"When our VISTA Volunteers land in a city slum or
an Appalachian hollow, they immediately discover prob
lems that weren't covered in the sociology textbooks.
They're grim problems, for poverty is a grim business,
and the Volunteers have to be strong enough to act, to
endure, and smart enough to understand."
In describing the organization he heads, Ferguson
said: "ViSTA doesn't offer its Volunteers much money.
It doesn't offer the glamor of foreign travel. I believe it's
probably the most spartan and most dedicated arm of

the entire war on poverty. It offers the singular chance
for a person to find out if he has enough courage to
spend a year of his life in the often thankless task of
helping others."
VISTA, he said, "is not a job for the squeamish or
the theoreticians. It isn't easy to find volunteers. We've
got to count on a special kind of people. People who
care. People who mean what they say.
"The squeamish can't take the squalor and the heart
break and the theoreticians find their pet theories shot
down five minutes after they confront a 17-year old
dropout who thinks that a 47-cent bottle of wine and a
50-cent reefer are the only way to start the day."

A Volunteer's principal equipment, Ferguson said, "is
determination, compassion and perseverence. It takes
all three."
He said that VISTA "is calling the bluffs of people
who claim to be concerned. Their year in VISTA will
take them deep into the lives of others. I can think of
nothing more fascinating than that."
The college-trained, he said, "have the background
and the knowledge to make excellent Volunteers. If they
have the necessary emotional and mental stamina, they
move high up on our list of prospects.
"So far, college campuses have proved to be a most
productive source of good Volunteers," he said.
