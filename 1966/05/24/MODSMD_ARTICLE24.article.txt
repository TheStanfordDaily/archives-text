## A 						publication of Volunteers In Service To America VISTA Aids Indians In War Against Want 
### 
The 1960's could go down as
the decade in which the Ameri
can Indian fought his last battle
against his oldest foe —poverty —
and won.
But the odds still weigh heavily
against the reservation-bound In
dian. He suffers from disease,
malnutrition, polluted water, high
infant mortality, and a life ex

pectancy of 42 years.
The average Indian per family
income is $1,500 a year—less
than a quarter of the national av
erage. Unemployment is around
40 percent —eight times the na
tional average.
Nine out of 10 of the nation's
385,000 reservation Indians live

in housing without running water,
sanitary facilities, safe heating, or
electricity. The infant mortality
rate is 70 percent higher than
for the rest of the nation.
The outcome of the Indians'
war against want depends in large
measure upon how much help
and encouragement they receive.
Many of the Indians are under
educated. underskilled, and for
the most part, underfed. Help to
relieve these conditions is needed
desperately.
• More than 200 Volunteers
from VISTA are now working on
half of the Indian reservations in
the nation because they feel that
the Oglala Sioux and the Mille
Lac Chippewas need help now,
not next year.
One of those who is helping is
Patrick Krijaz, a recent graduate
of the University of Minnesota,
who is now known around Gal
lup, N. M., as the "alcoholic
VISTA Volunteer." Krijaz got
his title from the fact that he
concentrates on working with al

coholic Indians, helping them to
get sober, stay sober, and assume
a productive role in society.
Elsewhere in the state, a six
sided, dome-roofed hogan is
home for Karen Murkett, Nor
wich, Conn., who is spending a
year of her life among the Nava
jos on their reservation near
Lukachukai, Arizona. A graduate
of Wheelock College with a de
gree in pre-school education, Miss
Murkett drives a school bus some
30 miles a day to pick up her 15
four-year-old Indian students.
• Krijaz and Miss Murkett are
typical of the first contingent of
218 VISTA Volunteers who have
agreed to spend a minimum of a
year on reservations throughout
the country in an attempt to help
the Indian achieve a measure of
parity in American society.
The Volunteers now serve 49
tribes, which represent 50 per
cent of the total Indian popula
tion in 16 states. They work with
the Seminole, the Crow, the
Navajo, the Sioux, the Chippewa,
and the Apache.


AS AN EXAMPLE to the rest of the neighborhood, VISTA Volun
teers in west side Philadelphia cleaned up, repaired, and nearly
rebuilt a dilapidated row house which will serve the girl volun
teers as living quarters. Clearing debris are Mary Sullivan, Uni
versity of Massachusetts graduate; Marean Brown, who attended
San Jose State College, and Frank Rubright of Alma College.

the Seminole, the Crow, the
