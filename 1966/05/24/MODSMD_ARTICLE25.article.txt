# VISTA's College-Trained Acceptance Rate Hits 75%
## 
### 
Seventy-five percent of all col
lege trained persons who apply to
spend a year of their lives in serv
ice to America as VISTA Volun
teers are accepted, Glenn Fergu

son, director of VISTA, has an
nounced.
The high rate of acceptance of
college students and graduates by
VISTA is attributed by Fergu

son to the "initiative, commit
ment, and adaptability of college
students." These characteristics,
considered highly important for
the Volunteers, are "continually
demonstrated by young college
volunteers during training." he
said.
"In fact," Ferguson said,
"more than three-fourths of all
VISTA Volunteers now serving
in the nation's poverty areas are
between 20 and 24. Of these, ap
proximately half have completed
from one to three years of col
lege and another 16 percent are
recent graduates."
Sargent Shriver, the War on
Poverty director, said recently
that the college trained "are
bringing their gifts of education
and encouragement to the tene
ment alleys and back country
roads. They have received one of
the truly great benefits of our so
ciety—an excellent education. In
VISTA they will be able to share
this benefit with others and con
firm the humane values which
our colleges and universities rep
resent."
In selecting Volunteers, VISTA
places emphasis on the quality of
the individual rather than on
specific skills. "We have projects
for almost all skills," Ferguson
said, "but the most crucial skill
of all is the ability to listen, under
stand, and communicate with
people. This holds true whether
the volunteer is a liberal arts
major or an engineer."
Liberal arts students who have
become VISTA Volunteers set up
libraries where none existed be
fore, renovate rural schools, teach
adult literacy, tutor diopouts, sur
vey health needs, organize com
munity meetings, lead pre-school
classes, help mothers in day-care
centers, direct recreation pro
grams, conduct neighborhood
clean-up campaigns, work with
youth gangs and delinquents.
Vice-President Humphrey,
speaking to students at the Uni
versity of Minnesota, described
the "special role for the college

students of today in VISTA." He
called college training the key to
service.
"Help clean up own own back
yard," he urged. "We all owe
something, everyone of us who
is privileged to have an educa
tion. We owe something to the
society that made it possible for
us to have this education.
"The easiest thing for this rich
country is to dole out cash," he
continued. "What is more diffi
cult is to be able to extend the
hand of fellowship, the hand of
assistance, the hand of education,
the hand of training, to help peo
ple slowly but surely lift them
selves."
The Vice-President said he be
lieved that by spending a year in
service to America. VISTA Vol
unteers will dramatically affect
their own lives as well as the lives
of the poor.
"You have the opportunity,"
he said, "to test your skills and
principles in the service of your

fellow man under conditions
which will give full scope to your
abilities and imagination."
A year in VISTA offers unique
practical experience to the stu
dents who plan to return to col
lege, continue on to graduate
school, or pursue their careers.
Through work in widely varying
fields. Volunteers often discover
interest in careers which lead to
the further study of medicine,
education, social work, public
welfare, law and public adminis
tration.
Living and working among the
poor in such places as Eskimo
villages, Appalachian hollows,
Indian reservations, and city slums
proves to be a powerful exper
ience in learning and understand
ing for most Volunteers.
Although their primary task is
to add a new dimension to the
lives of the poor, most find that
after their year is up, they have
added a new dimension to their
own.

selves."
The Vice-President said he be

service to America. VISTA Vol
unteers will dramatically affect
their own lives as well as the lives
of the poor.
"You have the opportunity,"
he said, "to test your skills and
principles in the service of your

fellow man under conditions

abilities and imagination."
A year in VISTA offers unique
practical experience to the stu
dents who plan to return to col
lege, continue on to graduate
school, or pursue their careers.
Through work in widely varying
fields. Volunteers often discover
interest in careers which lead to
the further study of medicine,
education, social work, public
welfare, law and public adminis
tration.
Living and working among the
poor in such places as Eskimo
villages, Appalachian hollows,
Indian reservations, and city slums
proves to be a powerful exper
ience in learning and understand
ing for most Volunteers.
Although their primary task is
to add a new dimension to the
lives of the poor, most find that
after their year is up, they have
added a new dimension to their
own.

Seventy-five percent of all col
lege trained persons who apply to
spend a year of their lives in serv
ice to America as VISTA Volun
teers are accepted, Glenn Fergu

son, director of VISTA, has an
nounced.
The high rate of acceptance of
college students and graduates by
VISTA is attributed by Fergu

son to the "initiative, commit
ment, and adaptability of college
students." These characteristics,
considered highly important for
the Volunteers, are "continually
demonstrated by young college
volunteers during training." he
said.
"In fact," Ferguson said,
"more than three-fourths of all
VISTA Volunteers now serving
in the nation's poverty areas are
between 20 and 24. Of these, ap
proximately half have completed
from one to three years of col
lege and another 16 percent are
recent graduates."
Sargent Shriver, the War on
Poverty director, said recently
that the college trained "are
bringing their gifts of education
and encouragement to the tene
ment alleys and back country
roads. They have received one of
the truly great benefits of our so
ciety—an excellent education. In
VISTA they will be able to share
this benefit with others and con
firm the humane values which
our colleges and universities rep
resent."

In selecting Volunteers, VISTA
places emphasis on the quality of
the individual rather than on

for almost all skills," Ferguson
said, "but the most crucial skill
of all is the ability to listen, under
stand, and communicate with
people. This holds true whether
the volunteer is a liberal arts
major or an engineer."
Liberal arts students who have
become VISTA Volunteers set up

us to have this education.
"The easiest thing for this rich
