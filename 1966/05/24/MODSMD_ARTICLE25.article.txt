# VISTA's College-Trained Acceptance Rate Hits 75%
## 
### 
Seventy-five percent of all col
lege trained persons who apply to
spend a year of their lives in serv
ice to America as VISTA Volun
teers are accepted, Glenn Fergu

son, director of VISTA, has an
nounced.
The high rate of acceptance of
college students and graduates by
VISTA is attributed by Fergu

son to the "initiative, commit
ment, and adaptability of college
students." These characteristics,
considered highly important for
the Volunteers, are "continually
demonstrated by young college
volunteers during training." he
said.
"In fact," Ferguson said,
"more than three-fourths of all
VISTA Volunteers now serving
in the nation's poverty areas are
between 20 and 24. Of these, ap
proximately half have completed
from one to three years of col
lege and another 16 percent are
recent graduates."
Sargent Shriver, the War on
Poverty director, said recently
that the college trained "are
bringing their gifts of education
and encouragement to the tene
ment alleys and back country
roads. They have received one of
the truly great benefits of our so
ciety—an excellent education. In
VISTA they will be able to share
this benefit with others and con
firm the humane values which
our colleges and universities rep
resent."
