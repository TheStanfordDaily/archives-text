# VISTA Tops Peace Corps Growth, Shriver States
## 
### 
After 11 months of operation,
VISTA has done "better than the
Peace Corps at a comparable
stage of development," Sargent
Shriver, the man who until re
cently ran the Peace Corps, told
a Washington press conference.
At the 11-month mark, VISTA
had 1,477 Volunteers in the field
or in training in 39 states and
Washington, D.C. That figure has
now increased to more than
2.000 Volunteers.
During a comparable period,
Shriver said, the Peace Corps had
820 Volunteers, either on over
seas assignment or in training.
According to Shriver, VISTA
plans to have 3,500 Volunteers in
the field by June of this year.
"The Volunteers are the heart
of the war on poverty," he said.
"In community after community
they have shown that deprived
and isolated people are willing
and able to make a new, con
structive effort with encourage
ment and skilled assistance."
He pointed out that VISTA is
seeking Volunteers from the ranks
of the poor as well as from col
lege campuses. "People who have

grown up in poverty," he said,
"have a special understanding to
contribute."
Shriver said, "The War on
Poverty takes money. But money
alone cannot win the war. Dedi
cated, skilled people are needed
to bridge the gulf between the
poor and the rest of America
and to start the process of re
generation in America."
Shriver also pointed out that
the demand for VISTA Volun
teers is outstripping the supply.
He said that a total of 7,831
Volunteers have been requested
to serve in 577 projects in the
District of Columbia and every
state but Hawaii and lowa.
