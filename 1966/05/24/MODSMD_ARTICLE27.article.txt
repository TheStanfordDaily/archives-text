# 261 Assigned to the Hollows
## Poverty-Stricken Appalachia Provides Daily Challenge to VISTA Volunteers 
### 
Although Congress has ear
marked more than a billion dol
lars to help cure the economic ills
of Appalachia, the first tangible
sign of the new prosperity seen
by the citizens of Davidson, Ten
nessee, is a 250-book library built
and maintained by VISTA Vol
unteers.
The library in Davidson, a new
day school in Kentucky, and a
tutoring program in North Caro

lina are some of the first results
of the massive attack on poverty
in the Appalachian region that
stretches from New York to
Alabama.
These programs are the work
of more than 261 VISTA Vol
unteers who have been assigned
the task of breaking through the
apathy, hopelessness and resigna
tion that grip the Appalachian
communities where the coal has

played out, the young people
have left, and tomorrow offers
less hope than yesterday.
In Davidson, home of the 250-
book library, five VISTA Volun
teers attack poverty in this region
where two surveys have esti
mated the per capita income to
be approximately $200 a year.
