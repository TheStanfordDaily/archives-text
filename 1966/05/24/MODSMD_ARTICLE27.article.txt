# 261 Assigned to the Hollows
## Poverty-Stricken Appalachia Provides Daily Challenge to VISTA Volunteers 
### 
Although Congress has ear
marked more than a billion dol
lars to help cure the economic ills
of Appalachia, the first tangible
sign of the new prosperity seen
by the citizens of Davidson, Ten
nessee, is a 250-book library built
and maintained by VISTA Vol
unteers.
The library in Davidson, a new
day school in Kentucky, and a
tutoring program in North Caro

lina are some of the first results
of the massive attack on poverty
in the Appalachian region that
stretches from New York to
Alabama.
These programs are the work
of more than 261 VISTA Vol
unteers who have been assigned
the task of breaking through the
apathy, hopelessness and resigna
tion that grip the Appalachian
communities where the coal has

played out, the young people
have left, and tomorrow offers
less hope than yesterday.
In Davidson, home of the 250-
book library, five VISTA Volun
teers attack poverty in this region
where two surveys have esti
mated the per capita income to
be approximately $200 a year.
The Volunteers work for the
LBJ and C Development Corpo
ration, a private, non-profit or
ganization formed to administer
the area's Community Action
Program. LBJ and C stands for
Livingston, Byrdstown, James
town, and Cookeville, the county
seats of the four counties in
cluded in the original organiza
tion.
• The five Volunteers will live
in Davidson for a year, concen
trating on juvenile delinquents
and drop-outs. They will guide
community development pro
grams, conduct recreation, edu
cation, and health services.
The task is far from easy.
Glenn Ferguson, Director of
VISTA, said: "We tell our
trainees it may take several
months before they're accepted as
part of the community." A major
goal is to get local citizens to ex
press their needs and then help
evolve a program that will meet
them.
A depressed rural area such
as Davidson (population 119),
has problems. Located halfway

between Nashville and Knoxville,
deep in the mountains, it once
was a flourishing mining town
that boasted a movie theater, a
telephone office, and a depot
where the trains stopped twice a
day to load coal.
• But the mines gave out more
than ten years ago and most of
the people have moved away. The
railroad tracks are overgrown
with weeds and the theater and
telephone office have been razed.
A schoolhouse still stands but it
was abandoned' two years ago
when the supply of pupils dried
up. Those children who remain
rise before dawn to catch a bus
to the school in Clark Ranee. 18
miles away. Few from Davidson
finish high school.
This lack of purpose is one of
the major problems facing the
five VISTA Volunteers who have
been assigned to the community.
Gerry English, from Santa Rosa.
California, and Barbara McCol
laum, of Tucumcari, N. M., have
been working for nine months to
give Davidson a "sense of corn

munity."
The main obstacle to their ef
forts is indifference. Miss Eng
lish has observed: "They've lost
so much. You insulate yourself
against caring when caring doesn't
count. That's what's happened
here since the mines dried out."
• The 261 VISTA Volunteers
are working in 34 projects in
eight states of Appalachia: Ala
bama, Kentucky, Maryland,
North Carolina, Pennsylvania.
Tennessee. Virginia, and West
Virginia.
Ninety VISTA Volunteers are
living and working in rural Ken
tucky. They serve in 13 of the
poorest counties of the state,
which are among the 300 most
impoverished counties in Amer
ica.
Middlefork, Kentucky, is an
other Appalachian community.
Once fairly prosperous, its major
economic staples were coal and
tobacco. But the coal ran out,
and the big tobacco producers
found better quality crops and
cheaper transportation elsewhere.

Now Middlefork is left with 300
or so residents who support them
selves by subsistence farming and
by selling cucumbers at 11 cents
per hundred pounds.
Middlefork might have con
tinued indefinitely in this same
fashion if it weren't for Jean
Honrath, a young, energetic
VISTA Volunteer assigned to that
community by her VISTA project
sponsor, the Council of Southern
Mountains.
In something more than nine
months in Middlefork. Miss Hon
rath has made only a start toward
alleviating the material side of
the community's plight. But in a
less tangible sense she has made
large-scale progress in reaffirming
the self-respect of the community
in its own eyes and in motivating
them toward changing the con
ditions.
• A former student at Contra
Costa Junior College in the San
Francisco suburb of El Cerrito,
California. Miss Honrath de
veloped an early interest in work

-ing with younger people. She de
cided that her skills and tempera
ment would best be suited in
helping to break the vicious cycle
of Appalachian poverty at the
children's level.
She concentrated on Middle
fork's children and not only
helped to establish its first Boy
Scout troop, but also ran a highly
successful summer school pro
gram for more than two dozen
local children aged 8 to 16.
Middlefork adults have re
ceived their share of help as well.
Miss Honrath has organized a
program so that unemployed
fathers from the community can
spend several days a week work
ing to improve the Middlefork
school.
• She is self-effacing when she
speaks of her success in Middle
fork. "I've only done what the
community wants," she claims.
"I'm far from overconfident, yet
I'm optimistic at the same time.
My guess is that what we've done
will last and grow."

successful summer school pro

The library in Davidson, a new
day school in Kentucky, and a

of the massive attack on poverty
in the Appalachian region that
stretches from New York to
Alabama.
These programs are the work
of more than 261 VISTA Vol

the task of breaking through the
apathy, hopelessness and resigna

communities where the coal has

played out, the young people
have left, and tomorrow offers

In Davidson, home of the 250-

LBJ and C Development Corpo

Although Congress has ear
marked more than a billion dol
lars to help cure the economic ills
of Appalachia, the first tangible
sign of the new prosperity seen
by the citizens of Davidson, Ten
nessee, is a 250-book library built
and maintained by VISTA Vol
unteers.
The library in Davidson, a new
day school in Kentucky, and a
tutoring program in North Caro

lina are some of the first results
of the massive attack on poverty
in the Appalachian region that
stretches from New York to
Alabama.
These programs are the work
of more than 261 VISTA Vol
unteers who have been assigned
the task of breaking through the
apathy, hopelessness and resigna
tion that grip the Appalachian
communities where the coal has

played out, the young people
have left, and tomorrow offers
less hope than yesterday.
In Davidson, home of the 250-
book library, five VISTA Volun
teers attack poverty in this region
where two surveys have esti
mated the per capita income to
be approximately $200 a year.
The Volunteers work for the
LBJ and C Development Corpo
ration, a private, non-profit or
ganization formed to administer
the area's Community Action
Program. LBJ and C stands for
Livingston, Byrdstown, James
town, and Cookeville, the county
seats of the four counties in
cluded in the original organiza
tion.
• The five Volunteers will live
in Davidson for a year, concen
trating on juvenile delinquents
and drop-outs. They will guide
community development pro
grams, conduct recreation, edu
cation, and health services.
The task is far from easy.
Glenn Ferguson, Director of
VISTA, said: "We tell our
trainees it may take several
months before they're accepted as
part of the community." A major
goal is to get local citizens to ex
press their needs and then help
evolve a program that will meet
them.
A depressed rural area such
as Davidson (population 119),
has problems. Located halfway

between Nashville and Knoxville,
deep in the mountains, it once
was a flourishing mining town
that boasted a movie theater, a
telephone office, and a depot
where the trains stopped twice a
day to load coal.
• But the mines gave out more
than ten years ago and most of
the people have moved away. The
railroad tracks are overgrown
with weeds and the theater and
telephone office have been razed.
A schoolhouse still stands but it
was abandoned' two years ago
when the supply of pupils dried
up. Those children who remain
rise before dawn to catch a bus
to the school in Clark Ranee. 18
miles away. Few from Davidson
finish high school.
This lack of purpose is one of
the major problems facing the
five VISTA Volunteers who have
been assigned to the community.
Gerry English, from Santa Rosa.
California, and Barbara McCol
laum, of Tucumcari, N. M., have
been working for nine months to
give Davidson a "sense of corn

munity."
The main obstacle to their ef
forts is indifference. Miss Eng
lish has observed: "They've lost
so much. You insulate yourself
against caring when caring doesn't
count. That's what's happened
here since the mines dried out."
• The 261 VISTA Volunteers
are working in 34 projects in
eight states of Appalachia: Ala
bama, Kentucky, Maryland,
North Carolina, Pennsylvania.
Tennessee. Virginia, and West
Virginia.
Ninety VISTA Volunteers are
living and working in rural Ken
tucky. They serve in 13 of the
poorest counties of the state,
which are among the 300 most
impoverished counties in Amer
ica.
Middlefork, Kentucky, is an
other Appalachian community.
Once fairly prosperous, its major
economic staples were coal and
tobacco. But the coal ran out,
and the big tobacco producers
found better quality crops and
cheaper transportation elsewhere.

Now Middlefork is left with 300
or so residents who support them
selves by subsistence farming and
by selling cucumbers at 11 cents
per hundred pounds.
Middlefork might have con
tinued indefinitely in this same
fashion if it weren't for Jean
Honrath, a young, energetic
VISTA Volunteer assigned to that
community by her VISTA project
sponsor, the Council of Southern
Mountains.
In something more than nine
months in Middlefork. Miss Hon
rath has made only a start toward
alleviating the material side of
the community's plight. But in a
less tangible sense she has made
large-scale progress in reaffirming
the self-respect of the community
in its own eyes and in motivating
them toward changing the con
