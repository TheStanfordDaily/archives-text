# VISTA Volunteers Go North of Nome
## 
### 
Fifty VISTA Volunteers have
fanned out of Anchorage by bush
piane and boat to man their war
on poverty outposts among
Alaskas isolated Eskimo villages.
One of the Eskimo requests is
for Volunteers who know some
thing about improving the breed
of Alaskan reindeer. If they can
furnish some tips on preserving
this season's catch of walrus
meat, so much the better.
The 50 Volunteers are the first
of 200 who are needed to help the
state's indigenous population of
approximately 60.000 Eskimos,
Indians and Aleuts who rank as
the poorest economic group in
the nation. Many of these families
live on less than $1,000 a year.
Half of the adults have had less
than five years of school and nine
out of every ten families live in
substandard conditions.
The Alaska Volunteers took
their training at the University of
Alaska at Fairbanks, where they
were introduced to village life
and the customs of the people
who are not only the poorest
Americans, but also the most iso
lated.
• The majority of the Volun
teers now work among the Eski
mos in western Alaska and north
of the Arctic circle, but they are
also found among the Indian
communities and in urban centers
such as Anchorage. Part of their

training included special instruc
tion in how to prepare for long
periods of awesome weather and
for days without sun.
Requests for Volunteers poured
into VISTA's Washington head
quarters from more than half of
the state's towns and villages fol
lowing a letter from Senator E. L.
Bartlett explaining that the Vol
unteers could help make the set
tlements "better places to live."
The letter was sent to all village
headmen.
Eskimos are a tough people
who excel at living close to na
ture. The Volunteers will assist
them to participate in many of
the state-wide service programs
that operate under the direction
of the Alaska Department of
Economic Development and
Planning.
Speaking to the second con
tingent of VISTA Volunteers to
be sent to his state. Alaska Gov
ernor William A. Egan told them
that "the VISTA Volunteers who
have preceded you into rural
Alaska are already playing a sig
nificant role in the effort to up
grade village life.
"Some villages never heard
from are now part of the Alaskan
community of the whole because
of the efforts of VISTA Volun
teers. For example, results of a
recent election in one such vil
lage were brought to the attention

of interior Alaska residents
through a letter written to a
major newspaper by a Volunteer
living there."
• Pointing out that most of the
Volunteers would be assigned to
the western and northwestern
areas of Alaska, Governor Egan
said: "Here you will face a great
challenge, perhaps the greatest of
your life ... if you did no more

than articulate the special, press
ing needs of these villages, you
would be performing a great
service.
"In no other situation would
you have such an opportunity to
use your own judgment and im
plement ideas."
The Volunteers can be found
performing a variety of wide
ranging jobs. They have built
sawmills and taught music to
Eskimo children. At Bethel, a
Volunteer helped to construct a
breakwater to prevent flooding of
the village during spring thaws.
• At nearby Hooper's Bay one
of the Volunteers' main concerns
is to explore the possibility of
building a small "flash" freezing
plant to help exploit the abundant
fish resources in the area. The
fish cannot be marketed now be
cause there are no facilities to
preserve them.
Further to the north, at Anak
tuvik Pass, a Volunteer has man
aged to get a tractor for the vil
lage to assist in hauling coal
down from the mountains for
winter fuel.

While doing all this the Volun
teers must spend a certain amount
of time fishing and hunting so
they can eat. Although certain
staples are provided, the principal
items of their diet will be the
same as their Alaskan neighbor—
seal, fish, reindeer, caribou and
game birds.
The Volunteers have learned
to pack ice for water, to ride a
dog sled, and to memorize the
recipes for reindeer stew and bear
steak.
In many villages, the outstand
ing form of recreation is to greet
the arrival of the mail plane. To
help fill this gap the Volunteers
are developing recreation pro
grams for children, youth and
adults. They also encourage com
munity efforts to provide facili
ties for meetings, libraries, health
services, and social activities.
• In addition they are con
ducting pre-school classes, tutor
ing students, and carrying on an
adult education program. Other
projects include health, education
and community sanitation pro


BETSY REEVE, a Volunteer at Hooper's Bay, Alaska, talks with some of her well-bundled pupils
outside her home. A graduate of the University of Wisconsin, Miss Reeve chose to work in Alaska
and is serving with more than 50 other Volunteers in the state's isolated villages.


DENNIS SCHMITT examines a piece of coal brought down to
Anaktuvik Pass, Alaska, by a tractor which he helped the village
to obtain. Previously, the coal was packed in by dog sled. Before
joining VISTA, Schmitt attended the University of California at
Berkeley where he majored in philosophy.


VISTA Volunteer John Shively, University of North Carolina graduate, and Gay White, who
attended the University of Colorado, stroll beside a frozen river at Bethel, Alaska. Shively helped
to build the pilings at right which will prevent flooding and erosion during spring thaws. Miss
White teaches school.
