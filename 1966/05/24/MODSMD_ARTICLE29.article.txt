# Rigorous Training Gives Volunteers Skills to Fight Poverty's Seamy Side
## 
### 
VISTA's training program gives
its volunteers a long, realistic
ltx>k at the seamiest side of pov
erty while equipping them with
the skills and techniques needed
to combat it.
The tough, rigorous training
schedule, lasting for several weeks
—ten hours a day —is not counted
as part of the Volunteer's year of
service.
Training is conducted by non
profit organizations—universities,
colleges, or social action agencies
—which have the experience and
facilities necessary to train adults
with a variety of educational
backgrounds.
• Some of the training insti
tutions concentrate on the prob
lems of the mentally retarded.
Others deal with the plight of In
dian families and migrant labor
ers. But each training cycle
makes sure that the volunteers
fully understand VISTA's pur
pose —-and the roles that trainees
are expected to play after gradua
tion.
The Volunteers go directly
from training to assignments in
slums, migrant worker camps, In
dian reservations, and Job Corps
centers throughout the country.
• Every effort is made to
match the skills, abilities and in

terests of each Volunteer with re
quests and descriptions of assign
ments that are received from
agencies and organizations spon
soring VISTA projects.
One of the primary objectives
of VISTA training is to allow a
Volunteer to relate his previous
background and existing skills to
the aims and requirements of the
projects in which he will work.
The majority of the training pro
grams takes place right in the
slums, migrant camps, Appala
chian hollows and Indian reserva
tions. It is as direct and prac
tical as possible.
The field experience may take
the form of working in com
munity projects on the Maricopa
and Gila River Indian reserva
tions south of Phoenix. Arizona.
There 26 VISTA Volunteers in
stalled a new roof on the com
munity center, helped clean yards,
houses. and established two
nursery schools — all in four
weeks.
• In an industrialized, urban
area such as New York, the field
placement activity may be com
posed of helping retarded persons
between 17 and 35 to learn the
New York City transportation
system and how to use a cafe
teria. Or it may be acquainting

people with family planning
clinics, helping to organize, tenant
councils, working with street
gangs or finding jobs for youths
whose teenage criminal records
have blocked them from employ
ment.
Two Volunteers assigned to
serve with migrant workers in
California were sent to Belgrade,
Florida, to live for a week with
migrant workers. Their experi
ence included working in the let
tuce fields as well as assisting in
the operation of a pre-school pro
gram for children.
Some of the institutions which
have participated in VISTA train
ing include the University of
Utah. National Federation of Set
tlements in Chicago. University
of Alaska, Tuskegee Institute in
Alabama Community Services
Foundation in St. Petersburg,
Florida; the North Carolina
Fund. Arizona State University,
and the Columbia University
Graduate School of Social Work.
• In addition to these institu
tions which direct the training
program, more than 100 public
and private agencies engaged in
work among the poor are coop
erating with VISTA by providing
practical field experience during
training.

VOLUNTEER KENNETH VAN COMPTON, 19, talks with a man
whose apartment has been hit by fire. Van Compton provides
information and help for the man and his family to find a new
place to live on the Lower East Side of New York where the
former Tulsa University student is concentrating his efforts.
VISTA's training program gives
its volunteers a long, realistic
ltx>k at the seamiest side of pov
erty while equipping them with
the skills and techniques needed
to combat it.
The tough, rigorous training
schedule, lasting for several weeks
—ten hours a day —is not counted
as part of the Volunteer's year of
service.
Training is conducted by non
profit organizations—universities,
colleges, or social action agencies
—which have the experience and
facilities necessary to train adults
with a variety of educational
backgrounds.
• Some of the training insti
tutions concentrate on the prob
lems of the mentally retarded.
Others deal with the plight of In
dian families and migrant labor
ers. But each training cycle
makes sure that the volunteers
fully understand VISTA's pur
pose —-and the roles that trainees
are expected to play after gradua
tion.
The Volunteers go directly
from training to assignments in
slums, migrant worker camps, In
dian reservations, and Job Corps
centers throughout the country.
• Every effort is made to
match the skills, abilities and in

terests of each Volunteer with re
quests and descriptions of assign
ments that are received from
agencies and organizations spon
soring VISTA projects.
One of the primary objectives
of VISTA training is to allow a
Volunteer to relate his previous
background and existing skills to
the aims and requirements of the
projects in which he will work.
The majority of the training pro
grams takes place right in the
slums, migrant camps, Appala
chian hollows and Indian reserva
tions. It is as direct and prac
tical as possible.
The field experience may take
the form of working in com
munity projects on the Maricopa
and Gila River Indian reserva
tions south of Phoenix. Arizona.
There 26 VISTA Volunteers in
stalled a new roof on the com
munity center, helped clean yards,
houses. and established two
nursery schools — all in four
weeks.
• In an industrialized, urban
area such as New York, the field
placement activity may be com
posed of helping retarded persons
between 17 and 35 to learn the
New York City transportation
system and how to use a cafe
teria. Or it may be acquainting

people with family planning
clinics, helping to organize, tenant
councils, working with street
gangs or finding jobs for youths
whose teenage criminal records
have blocked them from employ
ment.
Two Volunteers assigned to
serve with migrant workers in
California were sent to Belgrade,
Florida, to live for a week with
migrant workers. Their experi
ence included working in the let
tuce fields as well as assisting in
the operation of a pre-school pro
gram for children.
Some of the institutions which
have participated in VISTA train
ing include the University of
Utah. National Federation of Set
tlements in Chicago. University
of Alaska, Tuskegee Institute in
Alabama Community Services
Foundation in St. Petersburg,
Florida; the North Carolina
Fund. Arizona State University,
and the Columbia University
Graduate School of Social Work.
• In addition to these institu
tions which direct the training
program, more than 100 public
and private agencies engaged in
work among the poor are coop
erating with VISTA by providing
practical field experience during
training.
