the nation's War On Poverty.
VISTA Volunteers work directly with those who
are not sharing in this nation's promise. They offer
their services and skills wherever poverty exists:
in cities, small towns and rural areas, in tenements
and shacks, on Indian reservations or in migrant
worker camps, among the sick and disabled, the
young and the old.
They serve for a year where they are requested
and needed —in the 50 States, the District of
Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and the
Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. Living and
working with the people they help, VISTA Volun
teers are there, prepared at all times to assist,
advise, befriend. VISTA Volunteers serve for a
minimum of a year, plus their training period.

A. In a wide variety of ways. Volunteers work to
provide new hope, dignity and skills that can help
lift people out of poverty. The specific fields in

tional counseling, recreation, agriculture, conserva
tion, sanitation, construction, community services
—the list, like the problems that poverty itself
creates, is practically inexhaustible.
Q. Are VISTA Volunteers paid?

that is enough to get by on in the areas to which

food, clothing, and transportation. In addition,
they receive approximately $75 a month for such
personal incidentals as laundry, haircuts, and rec
reation. Medical and dental care are also provided.
For every month of service, $50 is set aside for
each Volunteer. The entire amount is paid to
Volunteers upon completion of service.

experience and abilities, demonstrated and de
veloped during training, to a specific need in a

They serve for a year where they are requested
and needed —in the 50 States, the District of
Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and the
Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. Living and
working with the people they help, VISTA Volun
teers are there, prepared at all times to assist,
advise, befriend. VISTA Volunteers serve for a
minimum of a year, plus their training period.
What do VISTA Volunteers do?
A. In a wide variety of ways. Volunteers work to
provide new hope, dignity and skills that can help
lift people out of poverty. The specific fields in
which they work include: education, health, voca
tional counseling, recreation, agriculture, conserva
tion, sanitation, construction, community services
—the list, like the problems that poverty itself
creates, is practically inexhaustible.
Q. Are VISTA Volunteers paid?
A. Volunteers receive a monthly living allowance
that is enough to get by on in the areas to which
they are assigned. The allowance covers housing,
food, clothing, and transportation. In addition,
they receive approximately $75 a month for such
personal incidentals as laundry, haircuts, and rec
reation. Medical and dental care are also provided.
For every month of service, $50 is set aside for
each Volunteer. The entire amount is paid to
Volunteers upon completion of service.
U hat are the htturs of work?
A. VISTA Volunteers have a full-time commit
ment to the people they serve. It is no 9-to-5 job.
The Volunteer stands ready to offer assistance
whenever he is needed.
Q. if hat are the basic requirements for
joining VISTA?
A. You must be at least 18 years old.
You must be a United States citizen or a perma
nent resident of this country or one of its territories.
You must have no dependents under 18 years
of age.

Q. How does VISTA service affect draft
status?
A. VISTA Volunteers are not exempt from the
draft. However, VISTA Volunteers are usually
deferred. (1) The trainee sends a request to his
local draft board for deferment for the period of
his VISTA service with a copy to VISTA; (2)
VISTA writes his draft board certifying that he
is a VISTA trainee and keeps the draft board
notified. While this almost always gets a deferment,
the decision concerning draft status is entirely up
to the local draft board.
Q. Hoic do I join VISTA?
A. Anyone who wishes to become a VISTA Volun
teer must complete a preliminary application form.
Immediately after VISTA receives the preliminary
application, the individual is sent a detailed ques
tionnaire which asks for background information
and the names and addresses of at least five
references.
There are no personal interviews and no tests
or examinations.
Q. If I submit an application to VISTA,
am I obligated to join?
A. No, you are not obligated—but your applica
tion should be submitted with the understanding
that you are sincerely interested in joining VISTA.
Q. Do Volunteers have a choice about the
location and type of work they do?
A. Yes. The VISTA questionnaire provides ample
opportunity for listing your geographical and work
assignment preferences. VISTA attempts to honor
these preferences as far as it is practicable, but
VISTA's concern also is to match a Volunteer's
experience and abilities, demonstrated and de
veloped during training, to a specific need in a
specific project.
Q. How quickly does VISTA respond to an
application?
A. After you send in your detailed questionnaire
and if your references respond immediately, you
should have a response from VISTA within 30
days.
Q, Are trainees paid?
A. Yes. Living, travel and medical expenses are
paid. In addition, the $50 a month stipend begins
with the start of a Volunteer's training.
Q. Are Volunteers assigned singly or in a
team?
A. Very few Volunteers are assigned singly. VISTA
prefers to assign Volunteers in teams. Where teams
are not needed, at least two Volunteers are as
signed to a given community or area.
