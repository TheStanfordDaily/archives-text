# Administration Issues Statement Clarifying Policy On Open House
## 
### BILL RORABAUGH 
Robert G. Gordon, Associate Dean
of Students, issued a memorandum
last Friday to resident assistants
"in an effort to clarify the matter of
open house policy."
The clarification reminds resident
assistants that "if individual students
or student groups cannot responsibil
ity for this University policy, the bur
den of responsibility must fall directly
to residence staff members."
A conflict over "open house hours"
has existed since May 12, when Legis
lature took unilateral action to extend
visitation periods for undergraduate
residences, and abolish regulations for
graduate residences.
Gordon affirmed that resident as
sistants have had the responsibility for
enforcing present policy. He added,
"This memo is a reminder of their re
sponsibilities as resident assistants."
However, Gordon continued, "Act
ually, the responsibility lies with the
student. We ask the resident assis
tants to sit down with the students
who violate the rule and talk over the
student's responsibility."
But, he cautioned, "Resident assis
tants are never appointed to assume
the role of policemen. Our main con
cern is that resident assistants be in
tellectual catalysts for the living
group.
Bill Mahrt, a Larkin House resident
assistant, commented, "I don't feel we
have complete responsibility for dis

cipline. If we did, it would destroy our
effectiveness."
Another resident assistant, Bill Haw
thorne, said, "I think students should
be able to make decisions like this
for themselves."
Another resident assistant claimed
his relationships would be severely
jeopardized if he rigorously pursued
such a policy of enforcement as en
visaged in the memo.
Gordon's memorandum notes that
changes in University policy are pres
ently being considered by the Commit
tee on Student Affairs and Services,
chaired by Alfred Gromon. Students
on the committee are Stan Black,
Donna Huse, and W. S. (Sandy) Mac
kenzie.
"During this period of study, until
any recommendations of the Commit
tee are formulated and approved, pres
ent University policy is binding on all
members of the community."
"Members of the community are re
minded that violators are liable to
University action, through a Univer
sity tribunal if the student judicial
councils declare themselves incompe
tent to deal with such violations."
LASSU's action in greatly expand
ing open house hours means student
juricial councils will probably not
take action in case of a violation of
University policy. University policy
provides two open house periods per
week.

University policy permits women to
have male guests in their residences
on Wednesday evening and Sunday
afternoon. Men's houses are open on
Wednesday and Friday night's. In
dividual living groups may close their
house within these time periods by
registration with ASSU and the Resi
dence Director.

"During this period of study, until
any recommendations of the Commit
tee are formulated and approved, pres
ent University policy is binding on all
members of the community."
"Members of the community are re
minded that violators are liable to
University action, through a Univer
sity tribunal if the student judicial
councils declare themselves incompe
tent to deal with such violations."
LASSU's action in greatly expand
ing open house hours means student
juricial councils will probably not
take action in case of a violation of
University policy. University policy
provides two open house periods per
week.

University policy permits women to
have male guests in their residences
on Wednesday evening and Sunday
afternoon. Men's houses are open on
Wednesday and Friday night's. In
dividual living groups may close their
house within these time periods by
registration with ASSU and the Resi
dence Director.
Robert G. Gordon, Associate Dean
of Students, issued a memorandum
last Friday to resident assistants
"in an effort to clarify the matter of
open house policy."
The clarification reminds resident
assistants that "if individual students
or student groups cannot responsibil
ity for this University policy, the bur
den of responsibility must fall directly
to residence staff members."
A conflict over "open house hours"
has existed since May 12, when Legis
lature took unilateral action to extend
visitation periods for undergraduate
residences, and abolish regulations for
graduate residences.
Gordon affirmed that resident as
sistants have had the responsibility for
enforcing present policy. He added,
"This memo is a reminder of their re
sponsibilities as resident assistants."
However, Gordon continued, "Act
ually, the responsibility lies with the
student. We ask the resident assis
tants to sit down with the students
who violate the rule and talk over the
student's responsibility."
But, he cautioned, "Resident assis
tants are never appointed to assume
the role of policemen. Our main con
cern is that resident assistants be in
tellectual catalysts for the living
group.
Bill Mahrt, a Larkin House resident
assistant, commented, "I don't feel we
have complete responsibility for dis

cipline. If we did, it would destroy our
effectiveness."
Another resident assistant, Bill Haw
thorne, said, "I think students should
be able to make decisions like this
for themselves."
Another resident assistant claimed
his relationships would be severely
jeopardized if he rigorously pursued
such a policy of enforcement as en
visaged in the memo.
