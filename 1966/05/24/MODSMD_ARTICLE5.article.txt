# Davis: Good End To Good Year
## 
### AL HEINEMAN 
Modern jazz as a consummate art
form has seldom been displayed to bet
ter advantage than at. the Miles Davis
concert Sunday afternoon in Memorial
Auditorium.
The Davis quintet is as superlative
a group as he has led since the 1956-57
group with John Coltrane, and possi
bly better. In Wayne Shorter, Davis
has the first horn player since Col
trane who understands and can trans
late into coherent music the goals of
the leader.
Drummer Anthony Williams is a
marvel: he always surprises and de
lights. He has a seemingly endless va
riety of ways to play the same meter,
and is amazingly judicious in his use
of repetition; he hoars the soloists,
and responds to their need with an
empathy equalled by few of his con
temporaries.
All Shades
Pianist Herbie Hancock can play
rhythm and blues (as he demonstrat
ed on his backing of "Agitation" in
the first set), furious avant-garde

atonalitv (as in "No Blues" in the sec
ond set) and all shades in between.
Bassist Richard Davis is a gifted solo
ist and composer. He was substituting
for Davis' regular bassist, Ron Carter,
so was unfamiliar with some of the
arrangements--which are loose, any
way—but he, too, has big ears, and
had some very provoking dialogues
with Hancock throughout the after
noon. The bass solo on "Stella by Star
light" was lovely and melodic, even
during the fastest and most tech
nically demanding runs.
And it is a joy to report that Miles
Davis it together again. {Bedeviled by
illness during the past several months,
he has played sporadically, sometimes
well and sometimes not.) Sunday he
was in fine form, exhibiting his spe
cial brand of unsentimental lyricism
on "Stella by Starlight" (breathtak
ing, beautiful performance by the en
tire quintent, with Williams' brush
work behind the last two solos espe
cially noteworthy), an open horn ren
dition of "My Funny Valentine," and
on "So What." (The latter number

sounded ragged during the introduc
tion, because the melody is normally
stated by the bass, and Richard Davis
was unfamiliar with the tune.)
Less Impressive
Miles was less impressive, though
still interesting, on the opening "Au
tumn Leaves" and on "No Blues,"
where he was clearly bothered by lack
of communication between Hancock
and Richard Davis.
Among other outstanding perform
ances during the consistently reward
ing afternoon were Shorter's fine,
clear, melodic improvising on "Stelta"
(his movements in and out of double
time were exciting) and on "Funny
Valentine," Hancock's chording and
legato work on the opening "Autumn
Leaves" and incredible delicacy on
"All Blues," and Williams' great sup
port throughout and stinging solo and
exchange with Miles on the closing
piece, known variously as "The
Theme," "Miles' Theme," and "Go
Go."
It was a very good year. And a
lovely way to end it.

cial brand of unsentimental lyricism
on "Stella by Starlight" (breathtak
ing, beautiful performance by the en
tire quintent, with Williams' brush
work behind the last two solos espe
cially noteworthy), an open horn ren
dition of "My Funny Valentine," and
on "So What." (The latter number

sounded ragged during the introduc
tion, because the melody is normally
stated by the bass, and Richard Davis
was unfamiliar with the tune.)
Less Impressive
Miles was less impressive, though
still interesting, on the opening "Au
tumn Leaves" and on "No Blues,"
where he was clearly bothered by lack
of communication between Hancock
and Richard Davis.
Among other outstanding perform
ances during the consistently reward
ing afternoon were Shorter's fine,
clear, melodic improvising on "Stelta"
(his movements in and out of double
time were exciting) and on "Funny
Valentine," Hancock's chording and
legato work on the opening "Autumn
Leaves" and incredible delicacy on
"All Blues," and Williams' great sup
port throughout and stinging solo and
exchange with Miles on the closing
piece, known variously as "The
Theme," "Miles' Theme," and "Go
Go."
It was a very good year. And a
lovely way to end it.
Modern jazz as a consummate art
form has seldom been displayed to bet
ter advantage than at. the Miles Davis
concert Sunday afternoon in Memorial
Auditorium.
The Davis quintet is as superlative
a group as he has led since the 1956-57
group with John Coltrane, and possi
bly better. In Wayne Shorter, Davis
has the first horn player since Col
trane who understands and can trans
late into coherent music the goals of
the leader.
Drummer Anthony Williams is a
marvel: he always surprises and de
lights. He has a seemingly endless va
riety of ways to play the same meter,
and is amazingly judicious in his use
of repetition; he hoars the soloists,
and responds to their need with an
empathy equalled by few of his con
temporaries.
All Shades
Pianist Herbie Hancock can play
rhythm and blues (as he demonstrat
ed on his backing of "Agitation" in
the first set), furious avant-garde

atonalitv (as in "No Blues" in the sec
ond set) and all shades in between.
Bassist Richard Davis is a gifted solo
ist and composer. He was substituting
for Davis' regular bassist, Ron Carter,
so was unfamiliar with some of the
arrangements--which are loose, any
way—but he, too, has big ears, and
had some very provoking dialogues
with Hancock throughout the after
noon. The bass solo on "Stella by Star
light" was lovely and melodic, even
during the fastest and most tech
nically demanding runs.
And it is a joy to report that Miles
Davis it together again. {Bedeviled by
illness during the past several months,
he has played sporadically, sometimes
well and sometimes not.) Sunday he
was in fine form, exhibiting his spe
cial brand of unsentimental lyricism
on "Stella by Starlight" (breathtak
ing, beautiful performance by the en
tire quintent, with Williams' brush
work behind the last two solos espe
cially noteworthy), an open horn ren
dition of "My Funny Valentine," and
