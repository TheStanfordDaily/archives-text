# Draft Exam Protesters Explain Sit-In At Rally
## 
### KIRK HANEN Staff Editor 
Participants in last week's draft
exam sit-in returned to White Me
morial Plaza yesterday to analyze the
cause and effect of their protest.
In the Plaza some 96 hours earliei*'
they launched what has been termed
the most daring assertion of student
rights in Stanford hisory.
Billed in a handout titled "Why We
Sat-In" as an attempt to clarify. is
sues. The meeting drew some 200
spectators—of which University ad
ministrators formed a prominent part.
Principal speaker from the officially,
nameless and leaderless group was •
Bob Hass, graduate student in En
glish. He characterized the movement
as an effort to "force students out of
their timidity and expose them to
President J. E. Wallace Sterling's aris
tocratic contempt for student will."
Hass emphasized that the issue was
brought to the student body because
"administrators would lose their jobs
were they to back-up protestors. We
can't expect very much from the fac
ulty because they are cowardly vic
tims of administrative manipulation."
Next Move
In a telephone interview with The
Daily, protestor Keith Lowe outlined
plans for a "trial" tomorrow at nooft
in White Plaza in which Deans Robert
Wert and Donald Winbigler, President
Sterling, and members of the Aca
demic Council would be invited to de
fend the University's position.
"We'd also like to have one spokes
man represent the position of the
counter-pickets," he added.
The hand-out drafted by the sit-in
group blasted the University's decision
to provide facilities for the Selective
Service draft deferment examination:
"a decision which deeply affects the ■
lives of many students but which was
made by one dean without any partic
ipation by students or faculty mem
bers."
Judicial Hearing's
Student judicial hearings for the
33 students who voluntarily gave their
names to University officials prior to

abandoning their protest in the lobby
of Building 10, are tentatively slated
to begin Thursday.
In a statement issued last Thursday,

A special, open Judicial Council
hearing: on the protesters who vio
lated University |K»licy during* the
demonstrations last week-end will be
held in E-2 (Education Building:)
Thursday, starting: at 4 p.m. The hear
' ing: will be open, with observers
seated in order of their arrival until
the seating: capacity of the room is
filled.

Dean Wert characterized the protest
as an attempt "by a few sudents to
impose their will on their fellow stu

dents and the institution by a sit-in
which violates established campus
rules and University traditions."
These campus rules prohibit dem
onstrations inside which tend to dis
rupt University functions.
Appellate jurisdiction in cases de
cided by the Judicial Council lies with
the Interim Judicial Body.
According to its chairman, Dr. Jos
eph Sneed, either the protestors of
the University may appeal an unfav
orable decision. Sneed indicated that
the University itself could take no ac
tion against the non-students, though
their case could conceivably be refer
red to the civil courts.
Twelve graduate students, one sen
ior, three juniors, eight sophomorto
and nine freshmen are scheduled to
appear.
