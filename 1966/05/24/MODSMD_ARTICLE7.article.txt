# Gleason Concludes, Praises Popular Stanford Jazz Year
## 
### MARY PLATT 
"The Stanford Jazz Year," said
critic Ralph Gleason in the concluding
speech of that series yesterday, "has
been more important than those who
have worked on it probably realize. By
treating jazz seriously, you have set
up a situation such that other uni
versities can say 'Stanford did it,
why should't we?' "
Gleason, speaking of the need to ac
cept jazz, told regretfully of a state
ment made by Muddy Waters: Waters,
after his visit to Stanford, had said
it was "odd" that he had to come to us
only through his connection with the
Rolling Stones and the Beatles.
"Though he is as important to the
history of jazz as Henry James is to

the novel, he was hardly known in
the United States until he became ac
cepted in England."
Gleason traced the history of jazz,
pointing out that performers who
were once condemned as revolution
aries, now, in retrospect, seem tame
by comparison to still newer artists.
He illustrated his point by playing
several records, first by Dizzy Gilles
pie, then by Ornette Coleman, Tony
Williams, and finally, Archie Shepp.
Popular acceptance of these artists,
he said, was brought about not by the
manipulation of public opinion by
critics, but through the support of
already-established musicians.
Gleason spoke of the close connec
tion between jazz and social problems.
"To participate in jazz," he said, "you
must necessarily face the problem of
race. If you dig Miles Davis onstage,
you must dig him offstage. And when
you go out to dinner with him. you
must face the wagging fingers and
shaking heads of society."
"It is not true that, all art is born
of suffering," he said, "but jazz, a
primarily Negro form of music, was.
This does not mean that white men
never suffer, only that there is a cer
tain kind of trouble in this world
which a white man does not face. Thus
white jazz performers often try to
sound like Negroes, and in order to
have something to worry about, many
of them become junkies."
Gleason went on to speculate about
the future of ja/.z, saying that it may
eventually become such an "immedi
ate" experience that only a live per
formance will be able to convey its
meaning, and records will become
obsolete.
He predicted a continuation of the
past trend toward eliminating bars,
time count, and even key. "There will
always be blues singers; the pretty
melody will never die out; but jazz is
a form of music in which a message is
conveyed in terms of feelings, not in
terms of notes. If this involves the
tearing down of tradition, we will
have to accept it."
This speech brought to a close the
Stanford Jazz Year.
