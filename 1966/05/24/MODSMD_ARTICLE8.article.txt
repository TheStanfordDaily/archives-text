# Lowenstein Raps U.S. For Dominican Action
## 
### 
"American acion in the Dominican
Republic represents a desire to oppose
social change in the name of stability.
Stability means a freezing of the
status quo in wihch 80 per cent of
the people are starving."
This is the assessment Allard Low
enstein made last night before a very
small gathering in Tresidder. Lowen
stein, a member of the 6-man Commit
tee on Free Elections in the Dominican
Republic, is on campus to recruit vol
unteers for an international corps to
observe the June 1 Dominican elec
tions.
Bosch and the Dominican people,
Lowenstein said, believe that even if
the election is honest it will be a
mockery unless the elected president
is allowed to appoint his own ministers
and then allowed to remain in office.
Black Picture
Briefly sketching recent history,
Lowenstein painted a very black pic
ture of American participation in the
Dominican revolt. He said that on
April 25 of last year, just one day
after the revolt against the junta had
started, only one battalion was still
resisting and only three people had
been killed. The Constitutionalists had
a virtual victory and were negociating
with the military leaders.
At this point the American Ambas
sador telephoned Washington that
by, or in danger of being inclunced
the Constitutionalists were influenced
by, or in danger of being influenced
stein continued, American troops ar
rived to protect 5,000 U.S. citizens.
While still claiming to be neutral, the
United States—Lowenstein said—told
the junta it could bomb Santo Do
mingo.
Lowenstein then explained that the
U.S. created a fictional government
headed by a man as popular as Goeb
bels would have been at Nuremburg.

"But having created it, the U.S.
couldn't get rid of it."
U.S. Destroyed Values
Lowenstein stressed the fact that
U.S. government repeatedly destroyed
those values which it claimed it was
in the Dominican Republic to protect.
"The U.S. iis responsible for many
deaths. It distorted, maligned, and
manipulated," Lowenstein charged.
To back up his case, Lowenstein
cited the fact that only one arrest
was made by the Inter-American
Forces in spite of 200 to 500 deaths.
"When the Dominican air force sent
tanks to shell a hotel, it took six
hours for the Inter-American Forces
to appear. When they arrived, first
thing they did was to evacuate U.S.
citizens."
