# Court Negates Napalm Action
## 
### ERIC PROKOSCH 
A request by the Redwood City
Committee against Napalm for a writ
or mandate to force the city to certify
a petition for referendum on the na
palm issue was denied in San Mateo
County Superior Court Friday.
The petition referred to resolution
P496, in which the Board of Port
Commissioners March 21 approved
the sublease of land by Standard Oil
to United Technology Center, and ac
cording to Judge Melvin E. Cohn, this
sublease expired when a new lease
between the port and Standard Oil
went into effect May 1.
Had the petition referred to reso
lution P497, in which the port Man
ager was directed to advertise for a
new 8-month lease, the judge said he
would have allowed the writ of man
date.
Dennis L. Woodman, the counsel for
the RCCAN, disagreed with the ruling
but admitted that lie would have in
cluded P497 in the petition had he
known its content.
The RCCAN plans to appeal the de
cision to the District Court of Appeals
in San Francisco, and it hopes for a
speedy hearing.
Saturday morning Professor Charles
Stein, Professor Rruce Franklin, and
Mrs. Franklin were thwarted in an
attempt to make citizens' arrests of
napalm production workers on the
basis of a recent state law, enacted in
connection with race riots, which pro
hibits manufacture or possession of
"firebombs".
The protesters arrived at the UTC
napalm plant, only to find that work
had been suspended for the weekend.
The guard on duty turned his back
on them and refused to speak.
Protesters have also considered mak
ing citizens' arrests by the Nurem
berg war codes, which establish indi
vidual responsibility for participation
in war crimes.
