# Bill To Curb LSD Now On Governor's Desk

Legislation which would allow law enforce
ment agencies around the state to crack down
on those using LSD for non-medical purposes
unanimously passed the California Senate,
May 11.
Authored by Senator Donald L. Grunsky
(Rep.-Watsonville), the bill, if signed into law,
would make it a misdemeanor for anyone to
possess lysergic acid diethalymine (LSD) for
personal use.
Penalties for the first such offense would
be up to $1000 fine or one year in county jail.
Subsequent violations could net the user one
five years in state prison.
The Grunsky bill would make it a felony to
sell, manufacture, transport, or give away
LSD. The legislation calls for a one-five year

stint in state prison for the first offense, and
two-ten years for subsequent offenses.
On Brown's Desk
In a telephone interview with The Dally
yesterday, sources close to Sen. Grunsky said
that his bill is now on Governor Edmund G.
Brown's desk, waiting to be signed into law.
They added that there is "no question" that
Brown will do so.
In an earlier call for action to combat
"mushrooming" traffic in LSD, Grunsky
blamed the problem on a permissive educa
tional situation which allows young people too
much freedom.
After the Assembly Criminal Procedure
Committee, blocked his bill on April 19, Grun
sky chastized Gov. Brown, who was, he said,
"a little slow and late in waking up to the
problem, but got around to it as the roof
caved in."

Federal government officials focused their
efforts to harness the LSD problem on college
campuses around the nation early in April,
when Food and Drug Administration Commis
sioner Dr. James L. Goddard sent letters to
more than 2,000 college deans to alert them to
"a dangerous increase in the illicit use of LSD
by students."
Goddard requested campus officials to re
port any instances of illicit use or possession
of any of the hallocenogencis—mind expand
ing drugs—or amphetamines—sleep delaying
drugs.
On April 17, Dr. Maurice Osborne, Executive
Director of Cowell Health Center, told The
Daily that any knowledge of LSD is considered
privileged communication between doctor and
patient.
"Reporting usage will not help the individ
ual as a patient. It won't accomplish much for

him or ot' ers."
Cowell rfealth Center psychiatrist Edwin
Lipinski recently told The Daily that he too
opposed the FDA's requests, adding:
"I fee lat if I had to report those who use
LSD, I'd have to report many other people
who talk to me who are engaged in a variety
of illegal activities—not the least of which is
fornication."
Federal Laws
The FDA's Drug Abuse Control Amend
ments, which grew out of the Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act of 1938, provide for a certain
degree of control over those drugs "having a
potential for abuse because of their halluceno
genio effect."
Specifically, the Amendments prescribe
punishment for anyone who sells or gives LSD
or other controlled drugs to anyone under 21.
The first offense carries a $5,000 fine and up

to two years in Federal prison. Penalties for
subsequent offenses include a $15,000 fine and
up to six years in jail.
On the whole, net effects of state and federal
legislation against LSD remain uncertain.
One tangible result, however, was Sandoz
Pharmaceuticals' decision to halt distribution
of LSD in the United States. The Swiss-based
company's policy has been in effect since April
11.
Sole Distributor
Sandoz's parent company, Sandoz Limited,
first synthesized LSD in 1938. Until April 11,
it was the drug's only licensed distributor in
the United States.
Though the FDA denied putting pressure on
Sandoz to stop selling LSD, the company itself
said that it was dropping its investigational
drug permit because of what spokesmen
termed "unforeseen public reaction."
