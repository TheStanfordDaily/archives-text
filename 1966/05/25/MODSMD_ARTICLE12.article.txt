# Degrees Changed At Yale
## 
### 
New Haven, Conn. (CPS) —
Yale University has become the
nation's first major university
to announce a degree higher
than the M.A. but not requiring
a dissertation.
The new degree, Master of
Philosophy, will be offered after
the fall of 1968. It will normally
take two years of graduate
work and will be awarded to
students who have completed all
requirements for a Doctor of
Philosophy degree except the
dissertation.
It is designed to satisfy the
demand for more college teach
ers, since educators predict a
critical shortage by 1970, and to
raise the level of requirements
for the master's degree.
Old Demands
Yale Graduate School Dean
John Perry Miller said that for
over a decade there have been
demands for leading graduate
schools to establish a new de
gree which "represents substan
tially greater achievement than
the typical Master of Arts or
Master of Science degree, but
which places less emphasis on
research than the Ph.D."
Many educators feel that too
many promising teachers are
lost to other professions be
cause they are not research
oriented and therefore never be
gin, or complete, Ph.D. require
ments. These educators add that
those who complete all doctoral
requirements except the disser
tation have nothing to show for
almost three years of work.
Two recent proposals incorpo
rate the same requirements as
the Yale degree, although nei
ther has yet been adopted.
'Candidate's Certificate'
The Big Ten graduate school
deans have discussed offering a
"candidate's certificate" to all
certified doctoral students. A
person with such a certificate
could teach for a period of time
and then complete his Ph.D. The
Big Ten deans do not intend for
the certificate to have the pres
tige or status of a doctorate
and view it only as a stepping
stone to the Ph.D. What they
propose, in effect, is to formal
ize a step that is already in the
Ph.D. program.
The University of California
at Berkeley's Select Committee
on Education recently proposed
the establishment of a Doctor of
Arts in the well-known Musca
tine Report.
A Berkeley committee is cur
rently studying the advisability
of establishing this degree. The
proposal has met with strong ob
jection from segments of the
faculty who charge that a new
doctoral degree would degrade
the Ph.D. and that no doctoral
level degree should be awarded
without a heavy research re
quirement. y'

New Haven, Conn. (CPS) —
Yale University has become the
nation's first major university
to announce a degree higher
than the M.A. but not requiring
a dissertation.
The new degree, Master of
Philosophy, will be offered after
the fall of 1968. It will normally
take two years of graduate
work and will be awarded to
students who have completed all
requirements for a Doctor of
Philosophy degree except the
dissertation.
It is designed to satisfy the
demand for more college teach
ers, since educators predict a
critical shortage by 1970, and to
raise the level of requirements
for the master's degree.
Old Demands
Yale Graduate School Dean
John Perry Miller said that for
over a decade there have been
demands for leading graduate
schools to establish a new de
gree which "represents substan
tially greater achievement than
the typical Master of Arts or
Master of Science degree, but
which places less emphasis on
research than the Ph.D."
Many educators feel that too
many promising teachers are
lost to other professions be
cause they are not research
oriented and therefore never be
gin, or complete, Ph.D. require
ments. These educators add that
those who complete all doctoral
requirements except the disser
tation have nothing to show for
almost three years of work.
Two recent proposals incorpo
rate the same requirements as
the Yale degree, although nei
ther has yet been adopted.
'Candidate's Certificate'
The Big Ten graduate school
deans have discussed offering a
"candidate's certificate" to all
certified doctoral students. A
person with such a certificate
could teach for a period of time
and then complete his Ph.D. The
Big Ten deans do not intend for
the certificate to have the pres
tige or status of a doctorate
and view it only as a stepping
stone to the Ph.D. What they
propose, in effect, is to formal
ize a step that is already in the
Ph.D. program.
