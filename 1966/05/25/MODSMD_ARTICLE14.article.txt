# Activism At Stanford: 'Bringing Up Father
## 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL Asociate Editor 
"Klein proposes embellishments on the cur
rent structure; I reject the asumptions on
which the current structure is based."
These words of ASSU President-elect Dave
Harris, spoken during a campaign debate
against Bob Klein, symbolize several years
of student activism at Stanford and serve as
a harbinger of the new direction in which
student activism has begun to turn.
Historically, student concern at Stanford has
been expressed in two broad areas. The first
is a rebellion against the existing conception
of the role of the student. Much of the work
of the past half decade has been to remove
the image of the student as a passive recep
tacle to be treated rather arbitrarily and pa
ternalistically.
But running beneath the surface demands
for respect and participation has been a steady
current asking questions of a much broader
nature, such as what is a university and what
is its relation to society. These questions have
either not been answered or have not been
answered satisfactorily.
It is this dilemma of looking for leadership,
not finding it, and consequently vesting au
thority in themselves that has caused the sec
ond thrust of student activists. If the adminis
ration is incapable or unwilling to articulate
a philosophy of education, some students have
said, we will begin the dialogue alone.
Both strands of the protest—that ag3 ?r,t! t
an anachronistic and degrading set of rules
and the call for discussion of broader educa
tional issues—was summarized two years ago
by one student observer:
"In the minds of many student leaders, arbi
trariness is at once a direct function of an un
necessarily paternal attitude on the part of
the administration and a denial of the essen
tial academic nature of the University."
"Students fear a vacuum—the lack of a co
herent philosophy of education at the top of
the administrative structure. They ask the
question, "Where is the leadership?" and are
forced to conclude it is nowhere if not in them
selves."
Bringing Up Father
Given the essentially paternalistic attitude
of the administration and the students' self
imposed tasi of educating the administration
on what thej feel to be some basic educational
concepts, th history of Stanford in recent
years might be titled "Bringing Up Father."
The significance of the Harris election, com
ing at the same time that most of the battles
over rules and regulations have been won, is
that student energy, and in turn administration
energy, will at last be concentrated on the sec
ond of the two areas of thrust: the attempt to
define and to work toward a new conception of
education.
But before students could begin asking
questions about the nature of their education,
they had to achieve a status in which they
were listened to. Much of the effort of the last
five years has been to gain this position. It
has been manifested as rebellion against the
role assigned to students by the administra
tion.
Basically, what the students have rebelled
against is being treated as immature and
being treated as things. Both flow from an
administrative mentality which student lead
ers think is essentially paternalistic and fre
quently arbitrary.
Paternalism is characterized by over-pro
tectiveness. It is the attitude that "we know
your best interest." Paternalism should at
least be personal, critics say, but it is not
when it is combined with the administrative
mentality which, in the words of one faculty
member "puts a premium on efficiency, and
peace and quiet."
"The person is taken out for the common
good, expediting the educational process,"
another professor points out. This has two
unfortunate consequences. First, something
has gone terribly wrong when people and their
development, those things which should be the
central concern of education, are ignored. But
more importantly, the system is self-perpetu
ating. If one assumes that the system he op
erates functions well and he dismisses critic
ism as being uninformed or as coming from
people too young to understand, the system
is impregnable.
It is for this reason that students have been
turned a deaf ear when they have raised the
broader issues, such as the nature of the uni
versity's relation to society. And, unfortun
ately, these types of questions have arisen as
natural consequences of questioning the sys
tem of dealing with students.
For example, the administrative mentality
that students have criticized" is a sytom of
what some critics term commodity education.
"There is a cultural assumption in Ameri
ca," one observer points out, "that institu
tions of society produce commodities." The
university is an institution and what it pro
duces are trained minds, components for the
assembly line of society.
Dual Responsibility
The broad issue which Stanford has not
faced, critics say, is to bring into balance the
university's dual set of relations to society.
As transmitter of the cultural heritage, the
university is in an accommodating role to soci
ety. It has the responsibility of preparing the
new generation to take control of the institu
tions of society.
But secondly, the university is critic of the
culture being transmitted. In this second role,
it conflicts with society.
The more articulate students feel that Stan
ford has become overbalanced on the side of
accomodation to society. As former ASSU
President Bud Wedin wrote in a recent article
on education at Stanford: "unlike Faustus
who sold his soul to the devil for more honor
able reasons, Stanford has aligned itself with
the biases and norms of the technological
society for want of any soul at all."
Another unfortunate result of the adminis
tration's refusal to listen to students is that
they feel compelled out of frustration to use
forceful tactics.
"They don't understand that what we say
has merit," one student leader states. "And on
the other hand, we don't understand them
because they don't explain their actions to
us." When the gap between students and ad
ministration is as large as it apparently is,
another states, "the situation suggests per
haps some inadequacy to mere discussion."
The administration has learned to listen
over the last half decade to what students
are saying and thus drastic tactics have not
been used. Explanations of this phenomenon

vary, however. The pessimists maintain that
"a lot of the change hasn't been basic attitud
inal change. It was merely strategic change
due to pressure.
The administration has played a holding
game, one adherent of this position main
tains, in the hope that "the activist minority
would graduate and this would all be over."
The significance of the Harris election, this
observer says, is to prove that pressure for
change "is not a temporary aberration caused
by a scapegoat figure."
The other side maintains that there has
been a very definite maturing process on the
part of the administration. One member of
the administration maintains, "we are no
longer over-reacting; we have more confi
dence and a better time perspective."
A slightly cynical student adds: "They know
they just can't do certain things now that
they could a few years ago. The old ploy of
divide and conquer won't work; if a minority

is being isolated and treated unjustly, a sub
stantial segment of the community will rise
in their defense."
In response to continued student demands
for change, some of the most sensitive admin
istrators (there are at least three or four
people over thirty in the administration who
can be trusted) have suggested tactics which
they feel would be the most effective for
students.
The list of one, Associate Undergraauate
Dean Robert Hind, reads as follows: • arm
yourself with facts; • go to the appropriate
person; • be open-minded; • concentrate on
academic improvement rather than peripheral
matters.
Associate Dean of Students Joel Smith sug
gests that "students are paid more attention
on pragmatic questions where they have rele
vant information. Their effect is limited when
they talk about the structure of the univers
ity."
But what Stanford has lacked, the articulate
students feel, is analysis of the structure.
"Without a discussion and an articulation of a
broad concept of education." One retired stu
dent leader states, "Stanford can only have
accretions to the current structure." And the
current structure he and many others regard
as inadequate.
The underlying criticism is a challenge of
the existing conception of authority.
The problem arises from a confusion be
tween education and administration. The uni
versity is an institution of society and thus
has a governing body. But the authority vested
ih it is only for administrative matters.
"The administration and the trustees tend
to think of education as one facet of adminis
tration, rather than vice versa as it should
be," one observer feels.
Another laments that "authority no longer
relates to education." Final authority in the
universiy, this student feels, should be
"truth,"and all other authority gains its
legitimacy in relation to this primary author
ity.
Dialogue Impossible
Fundamental to the search for truth is
"the courage to attack your convictions." At
least some Stanford students have found this
trait lacking in both the administration and the
faculty. This discovery has had at least two
unfortunate results.
First, some students have by default come
to vest authority in their peers because they
feel the faculty and administration have abdi
cated their responsibility to be self-critical.
This results in education being less challeng
ing than it could be if, these students feel,
they could respect the faculty as searching
minds as well as dispensers of knowledge.
But more broadly, a dialogue about the cur
rent structure of the university is not even
possible because of the attitude of the adminis
tration. "Real disagreement is now impos
sible," one student states. "The joint inquiry
we desire requires questioning assumptions.
The administration is as yet unwilling to do
this."
"Something must be done to challenge their
parochial conception of authority. They won't
recognize student authority or any higher
authority. Stanford has neither the courage
nor the capability to question itself funda
mentally because of its parochialism."
Concomitant to the efforts at bringing up
Father has been the effort to "Bring Leland
off the Farm." The last decade has been the
emergence of Stanford from a rather paroch
ial Western institution to a university of na
tional reputation.
The result of the very deliberate efforts to
upgrade the faculty by bringing to Stanford
people from outside has been to make the be
ginnings, at least, of a process of self-criticism.
In the student body, this process was begun
by people like Allard Lowenstein, who was
for a year director of Stem Hall and taught
in the Political Science department.
"A 1 brought wide experience to a parochial
campus," one former administrator states. "He
came to Stanford at a time when there was a
feeling that major changes were needed. He
gave students confidence that change was
worthwhile and that students could make the
difference in bringing change where it had
before appeared impossible."
For several years, many students feel, the
administration used Lowenstein and the stu
dents he met during his year here as the ex
planation of student activism. The name
"Lowenstein" is not heard often anymore at
Stanford and yet students seem more dedi
cated than ever before to pressing for changes.
Much of the thrust of Lowenstein and stu
dents he inspired was to convince students
that they did have a right to be heard and a
right to be treated as adults. In a sense, these
feelings triggered the rebellion against the

old conception of the role of the student, a
rebellion which took form in the demand for
respect.
But this first rebellion was merely the
establishment of the base on which the real
discussion of education could begin. Now that
student leaders have largely completed the
attack on the facade of the current structure,
they are moving towards positing their own
conception of education. This second of the
two thrusts of student activism is summarized
by the term "integration."
First, students demand that their scholarly
and their social criticism be integrated. Many
students find it hypocritical on the part of the
administration to demand of students a critical
attitude and an openness of mind in the class
room but not to expect the same techniques
and commitments to apply outside the class.
"It seems strange," says one close ob
server of the administration, "that we excite
students about social institutions and then
tell them to keep the valve shut until they
leave."
The basic problem, as analyzed by several
of the most astute student critics, is one of
leadership. Ilene Strelitz, Daily editor, wrote
two years ago, in an editorial titled "Where is
Leadership in the University?":
"The criticism levelled at the student is
consistently in the direction of inaction; don't
step beyond the classroom, don't speak out,
and above all don't hold the lectures in the
classroom and the words in the text as rele
vant to the broad issues of controversy facing
your generation.
Students Make Demands
"This is an odd reversal of roles.
"The student should be criticized. The Presi
dent . . . should demand more confrontation
by the student of the responsibility of the edu
cated to the society. His words should be a
constant barrage of criticism for unawareness,
ignorance of 'the world outside', lack of appli
cation of talents, the need for the university
to be the fearless critic and ethical leader.
'It is the role of leadership to criticize and
to demand action, to pose the questions, not to
prohibit them. The students wait for a leader
to raise up before them.
"... The greatest sadness of all will come
if nothing is done, for the President, the deans,
etc. are leaders, no matter how they construe
that role. And it will be sad if the students are
led into passive and uncaring commitments to
stagnation."
There are strong indications that at least
a significant minority are not heading toward
stagnation, but it seems that many are doing
so in spite of, rather than because of any atti
tudes or policies of the administration. And,
in the strangest irony of all, it is the students
who have been demanding that the university
examine its responsibility to society, that the
university be the "formulator not the reflector
of cultural values," that the university define
itself.
But integration of scholarly and social critic
ism is only one of several types of integration
students have called for. The second type is
the integration of thought and action. Here,
students find inspiration in the words of Pro
fessors Otis Pease and Robert McAfee Brown.
Pease speaks of the paradox between curi
osity and commitment. "A great university,"
he says "may choose to do many things, but
the one thing it must do is to generate curios
ity and a sense of commitment among its stu
dents and teachers. And therein lies a para
dox."
"Curiosity is nothing less than the endless
desire to find truth about something; com
mitment involves the desire to act on what
one believes to be truth."
"It is the task of great teaching to create
an environment in which a person may learn
for himself to resolve this paradox, to learn
how he may fuse curiosity and commitment, so
that each, in reinforcing the other, may to
gether give life to his mind where singly they
would destroy it."
Brown emphasizes that "study and direct
concern cannot properly be separated from
one another."
"The notion that student revolt—whether
over Vietnam or social regulations or racial
injustice—is 'interfering with education' is a
notion incompatible with the recognition that
in the life of the truly educated person,
thought and action are indivisible."
"There is involved here a kind of amalgam
of vision, unrest, dissatisfaction, and a desire
to do something about it all. The task of the
university is not to keep a student separated
from the world, but to involve him more re
sponsibly in it."
For many students, the process has been
reversed: they have found through participa
tion in other social institutions that students
can play an active role in bringing change.
This belief, in turn, has been brought back
to the university, where many of these stu
dents find it increasingly unbearable to be
treated like passive containers into which in
formation is to be poured," says Joseph Katz
of the Institute for the Study of Human Prob
lems.
Katz thinks that the change in student con
sciousness is so drastic as to be "a possible
turning point in educational history.. Similar
to the people of the Renaissance and the
French revolution, students today have a new
consciousness: they feel differently about
themselves and about the world."
Gone is the passive acceptance of the exist
ing society and the individual's role in it. "Stu
dents now feel that they can do something
about their situation. Further, if things are
not as they should be, they feel that it is not
all their fault and that part rests in the social
sructure."
A third thrust of student pressure has been
to integrate the student's status outside the
classroom to his status inside. Much of he con
troversy summed up as "the revolt against
rules and regulations" has been based on the
contention that the student is treated differ
ently in his social life than he is in his aca
demic endeavors.
"There is a certain incongurity in demand
ing a critical attitude in class and assuming
that people can not regulate their own lives,"
one student leader states. "Such hypocrisy
ignores or blurs the facts." And again, lead
ership in the university is questioned.
"Because of this abdication, this refusal by
the administration to face problems," the same
student adds, "the task has fallen to the stu
dents."
All he three previously mentioned "integra
tions" have been mere preliminaries to the
final integration: incorporation of students
into the scholarly community.
Two years ago, in his concluding address
as ASSU President, Bud Wedin stated: "We

have taken a great deal of tolerance and un
derstanding from this community and replaced
it with skill and efficiency. Too often we have
regarded the individual as an object and have
seen him only in relation to rules or regula
tions."
"In short, we seem to have lost the vision of
a democratic university in which all share cer
tain rights of participation in matters of com
mon concern, and of freedom of inquiry, as
sociation, and development, and where pa
ternalism is replaced by fellowship in the
company of scholars."
"Perhaps it is time to review some of the
institutions of our society at Stanford to see
if we are really doing our utmost to produce
students with the intellectual maturity, the
self-assurance, and the sense of dignity and
independence so needed in today's society."
The following fall, a group of students and
faculty members formed the Stanford Associa
tion of University Scholars. The purpose of
the group, according to its founder Bob Rosen,
was "to break false dichotomies. Usually the
students and faculty are thought of in opposi
tion to the 'University.' We think that studens
and faculty, because they are the practicing
scholars, are the University. The administra
tion exists to work for the University, to fa
cilitate the pursuit of knowledge."
SAUS faded away, partially out of an inabil
ity to define itself and partially because the
energy of the participants was directed to
other activities. The participants in SAUS,
Rosen explains, were also involved in larger
political movements as well.
The fact that no new SAUS has arisen is
no sign that students are no longer interested
in education. Quite the contrary, Rosen mam
tains: participation in things such as the ASSU
Education Commission is far more broadly
based than concern over educational reform
ever has been.
"There is now a sincere interest in educa
tional reform," Rosen states, "and an orienta
tion toward acting on ideas. Groups will re
emerge on a formal basis with a fuller, strong
er consensus than SAUS ever had."
Just an opinion about rules and regulations
became part of the popular consciousness at
Stanford in the years following the original
questioning of the system, so now educational
reform has now been accepted.
Expect Change
"Whereas two years ago, no one thought
change possible," another says, "we now ex
pect change because we have had change. In
the election of Harris, it was shown for the
first time that on really important issues, stu
dents are willing to act. The administration
has to make sense now."
And here is no doubt that the administration
is trying harder. As one fringe member puts
it,"The administration pays more attention to
students than it likes to admit. And it is slow
to credit them."
But the reciprocal criticism also applies;
students are reluctant to give recognition to

the administration. The big problem in stu
dent-administration relations two years ago
was communication. The emphasis has shifted
somewhat now as each group recognizes that
where it had before assumed differences of
opinion, it can see now because the lines of
communication have been opened that the dif
ferences are real.
The basic problem seems to be one of trust.
If students felt they were a part of a joint
educational endeavor, in which the main cri
teria for decision-making, was as one observer
states "the engagement of the intellect over
a subject as one aspect of the educational
process," an entirely different atmosphere
would prevail.
By the combination of real participation
and openness which would require redress and
public accountability, the atmosphere of sus
picion could be replaced with one in which
all were moving in the same directions.
What students are calling for is a substan
tial say in determining their own education.
They recall that the term "authority" implies
the consent of the governed; otherwise gov
erning is merely the exercise of power.
Few models have been worked out in detail,
but one theme seems to reappear in almost all
discussions: the theme of community. If agree
ment can be reached on the principles of com
munity, any structure would come from the
consensus almost naturally.
The characteristics students have posited
for the community center around the concep
tion of a core of shared values, which would
include above all openness and freedom from
bias.
This attitude must first be employed, some
students feel, in self-analysis. Without funda
mental questioning of the assumptions upon
which the current structure of the University
is based, not even a beginning can be made
toward achieving community.
And before community is achieved, other
attitudes must change. Community involves
1) having an identification with the Univer
sity over and above loyalty to discipline or
constituency and 2) seeing people as individu
als rather than as representatives of consti
tuencies.
These traits seems to be lacking at Stanford
today and the insulting "power bloc" relation
ships make change appear the result of a vic
tory of one bloc over another rather than a
communal achievement.
As long as students are thought of as stu
dents rather than as more intellects being
"engaged over a subject," power blocs and
their consequent tactics will prevail. When stu
dents feel the frustration of their ideas being
ignored simply because of their status, they
often conclude that "Brinksmanship" is the
only way to push Stanford over the edge of
greatness.

Hopefully, the set of relations now pri
ing will be transcended, but one suspects
the structure and its occupants have bee
so identified with each other that m
change is impossible during the current
eration of either students or administrators.
Part of the gap between students and the
administration, which seems too much to
bridge: is the difference in values. In the case
of the current crop of students, the difference
seems to be more than is accountable by any
merely generational gap.
This generation tends to put the emphasis
on operations rather than content as the way
to authenticating a moral system.
"We are more open-minded and less dog
matic," one student explains. "We have a rela
tivistic conception of moral values and believe
that allowing people to develop themselves,
rather than imposing on them a system of
values, is the way to bring a happy society."
But the era of student-administration rela
tions may have come to an end, or at least a
lessening in intensity, for the recent ASSU
campaign was run on educational reform,
which will necessitate more dealing with the
faculty.
Opinion varies as to whether curricular
change will come more easily or with greater
difficulty than have the changes over rules
and regulations.
One administrator feels that "the difficult
changes are the visible ones. Those are now
past. Educational reform can be approached
on honest intellectual grounds, which was not
possible when the battles were being fought
in the public press."
On the other hand, curricular criticism can
often be interpreted as an attack on the pro
fessional autonomy of the professor. And even
more desperately, some students feel that the
refusal to be self-critical applies to the faculty
as well as the administration.
Faculty Paternalism
The administrative mentality causing a com
modity view of education in the administra
tion has pervaded the faculty as well. Pa
ternalism here is reflected in an attitude of
dispensing knowledge to a passive receptacle.
And just as with paternalism in the admin
istration, paternalism in the faculty is hard to
puncture. Some students have found a real
unwillingness on the part of some faculty
members to be honestly evaluative of their
own achievements or to confront students as
authorities in their own right.
A third body of opinion on curricular reform
holds that the administration, not the faculty,
is the key to reform because its conception of
education is the prevailing one.
This group feels that questions about foun
dations must be asked of a structure which
emphasizes passive receptivity. Regurgitation
of knowledge as a basis of determining level
of education seems to some students to reflect
Stanford's overbalance on the side of accomo
dating society.
Dave Harris based his campaign upon dis
satisfaction with the existing structure and he
analyzes his election as "an expression of stu
dent discontent, a broad emotional statement
of dissatisfaction with the type of education
given here and the student's role in it."
Education at Stanford, he says, is viewed as
"indoctrination, not participation. The student
is treated as a second-class citizen in the com
munity; his life is fragmented."
He would like to see students participating
in an "integrative four-year experience rather
than in a training period."
His preliminary plans for next year include
activities on two fronts. First, the fifty or so
people who recently signed up to work in his
organization will devote must of their efforts
to research in the fields of education, decision
making, student rights, and housing.
Second, under the heading of special Presi
dential programs, Harris is planning to back
an experimental college "to build in the mi
crocosm what we want in the macrocosm,"
and hopes to sponsor a national conference on
education.
The recent analysis by Katz and Nevitt San
ford of student activism nationally (Saturday
Review, December) has remarkable applica
tion to the situation at Stanford. They say that
the "demand for participation does not stem
from any desire to make college life easier.
Rather it springs from a profound attempt to
seek answers as to how one might achieve
such ends as a reliable personal identity, com
munity with other people, and social objectives
that will bring comfort and justice to those
largely bereft of them in our society."
Level Of Investigation
Their research shows that "the socially in
volved students total not more than 15 per
cent, but the movement can no longer be con
trolled by dealing with the minority alone, be
cause it is expressing the frustrations and as
pirations now shared by the majority of stu
dents."
The current situation represents a unique
opportunity to college administations, they
say. "Administrators who can find some way
to respond to what is human, though some
times chaotically expressed, in these under
graduate students, will find that they are go
ing to be part of a truly revolutionary phase
in the history of education."
"While the eighteenth century discovered
that good government depends upon the con
sent of the governed, our generation has the
opportunity of discovering and bringing to
fruition a system of education that is based
upon the consent of the educated."
On purely pragmatic grounds, encourage
ment of student participation in educational
reform is desirable, because, as one student
commented last spring in reaction to a speech
by President Sterling: "The 'Stanford student
movement'—if indeed, a movement exists as
such—does not represent a rebellious asser
tion of 'student autonomy' but, rather, a con
sidered and concerncd effort to help create a
better, more challenging university for those
students who follow."
There have been several signs since that
time that President Sterling shares much the
same opinion. At a recent alumni conference,
he commented that one strain of student pro
test shows "a genuine interest in the construc
tive task of improving education."
Recognition of the sincerity and construc
tive purpose of many student activists is cer
tainly welcome, but "what they desire most is
the appearance of forceful and self-critical
leadership dedicated to educational reform.
When that leadership becomes visible, stu
dents will at last be able to say that the proc
ess of bringing up father has been completed.


"Klein proposes embellishments on the cur
rent structure; I reject the asumptions on
which the current structure is based."
These words of ASSU President-elect Dave
Harris, spoken during a campaign debate
against Bob Klein, symbolize several years
of student activism at Stanford and serve as
a harbinger of the new direction in which
student activism has begun to turn.
Historically, student concern at Stanford has
been expressed in two broad areas. The first
is a rebellion against the existing conception
of the role of the student. Much of the work
of the past half decade has been to remove
the image of the student as a passive recep
tacle to be treated rather arbitrarily and pa
ternalistically.
But running beneath the surface demands
for respect and participation has been a steady
current asking questions of a much broader
nature, such as what is a university and what
is its relation to society. These questions have
either not been answered or have not been
answered satisfactorily.
It is this dilemma of looking for leadership,
not finding it, and consequently vesting au
thority in themselves that has caused the sec
ond thrust of student activists. If the adminis
ration is incapable or unwilling to articulate
a philosophy of education, some students have
said, we will begin the dialogue alone.
Both strands of the protest—that ag3 ?r,t! t
an anachronistic and degrading set of rules
and the call for discussion of broader educa
tional issues—was summarized two years ago
by one student observer:
"In the minds of many student leaders, arbi
trariness is at once a direct function of an un
necessarily paternal attitude on the part of
the administration and a denial of the essen
tial academic nature of the University."
"Students fear a vacuum—the lack of a co
herent philosophy of education at the top of
the administrative structure. They ask the
question, "Where is the leadership?" and are
forced to conclude it is nowhere if not in them
selves."
Bringing Up Father
Given the essentially paternalistic attitude
of the administration and the students' self
imposed tasi of educating the administration
on what thej feel to be some basic educational
concepts, th history of Stanford in recent
years might be titled "Bringing Up Father."
The significance of the Harris election, com
ing at the same time that most of the battles
over rules and regulations have been won, is
that student energy, and in turn administration
energy, will at last be concentrated on the sec
ond of the two areas of thrust: the attempt to
define and to work toward a new conception of
education.
But before students could begin asking
questions about the nature of their education,
they had to achieve a status in which they
were listened to. Much of the effort of the last
five years has been to gain this position. It
has been manifested as rebellion against the
role assigned to students by the administra
tion.
Basically, what the students have rebelled
against is being treated as immature and
being treated as things. Both flow from an
administrative mentality which student lead
ers think is essentially paternalistic and fre
quently arbitrary.
Paternalism is characterized by over-pro
tectiveness. It is the attitude that "we know
your best interest." Paternalism should at
least be personal, critics say, but it is not
when it is combined with the administrative
mentality which, in the words of one faculty
member "puts a premium on efficiency, and
peace and quiet."
"The person is taken out for the common
good, expediting the educational process,"
another professor points out. This has two
unfortunate consequences. First, something
has gone terribly wrong when people and their
development, those things which should be the
central concern of education, are ignored. But
more importantly, the system is self-perpetu
ating. If one assumes that the system he op
erates functions well and he dismisses critic
ism as being uninformed or as coming from
people too young to understand, the system
is impregnable.
It is for this reason that students have been
turned a deaf ear when they have raised the
broader issues, such as the nature of the uni
versity's relation to society. And, unfortun
ately, these types of questions have arisen as
natural consequences of questioning the sys
tem of dealing with students.
For example, the administrative mentality
that students have criticized" is a sytom of
what some critics term commodity education.
"There is a cultural assumption in Ameri
ca," one observer points out, "that institu
tions of society produce commodities." The
university is an institution and what it pro
duces are trained minds, components for the
assembly line of society.
Dual Responsibility
The broad issue which Stanford has not
faced, critics say, is to bring into balance the
university's dual set of relations to society.
As transmitter of the cultural heritage, the
university is in an accommodating role to soci
ety. It has the responsibility of preparing the
new generation to take control of the institu
tions of society.
But secondly, the university is critic of the
culture being transmitted. In this second role,
it conflicts with society.
The more articulate students feel that Stan
ford has become overbalanced on the side of
accomodation to society. As former ASSU
President Bud Wedin wrote in a recent article
on education at Stanford: "unlike Faustus
who sold his soul to the devil for more honor
able reasons, Stanford has aligned itself with
the biases and norms of the technological
society for want of any soul at all."
Another unfortunate result of the adminis
tration's refusal to listen to students is that
they feel compelled out of frustration to use
forceful tactics.
"They don't understand that what we say
has merit," one student leader states. "And on
the other hand, we don't understand them
because they don't explain their actions to
us." When the gap between students and ad
ministration is as large as it apparently is,
another states, "the situation suggests per
haps some inadequacy to mere discussion."
The administration has learned to listen
over the last half decade to what students
are saying and thus drastic tactics have not
been used. Explanations of this phenomenon

vary, however. The pessimists maintain that
"a lot of the change hasn't been basic attitud
inal change. It was merely strategic change
due to pressure.
The administration has played a holding
game, one adherent of this position main
tains, in the hope that "the activist minority
would graduate and this would all be over."
The significance of the Harris election, this
observer says, is to prove that pressure for
change "is not a temporary aberration caused
by a scapegoat figure."
The other side maintains that there has
been a very definite maturing process on the
part of the administration. One member of
the administration maintains, "we are no
longer over-reacting; we have more confi
dence and a better time perspective."
A slightly cynical student adds: "They know
they just can't do certain things now that
they could a few years ago. The old ploy of
divide and conquer won't work; if a minority

is being isolated and treated unjustly, a sub
stantial segment of the community will rise
in their defense."
In response to continued student demands
for change, some of the most sensitive admin
istrators (there are at least three or four
people over thirty in the administration who
can be trusted) have suggested tactics which
they feel would be the most effective for
students.
The list of one, Associate Undergraauate
Dean Robert Hind, reads as follows: • arm
yourself with facts; • go to the appropriate
person; • be open-minded; • concentrate on
academic improvement rather than peripheral
matters.
Associate Dean of Students Joel Smith sug
gests that "students are paid more attention
on pragmatic questions where they have rele
vant information. Their effect is limited when
they talk about the structure of the univers
ity."
But what Stanford has lacked, the articulate
students feel, is analysis of the structure.
"Without a discussion and an articulation of a
broad concept of education." One retired stu
dent leader states, "Stanford can only have
accretions to the current structure." And the
current structure he and many others regard
as inadequate.
The underlying criticism is a challenge of
the existing conception of authority.
The problem arises from a confusion be
tween education and administration. The uni
versity is an institution of society and thus
has a governing body. But the authority vested
ih it is only for administrative matters.
"The administration and the trustees tend
to think of education as one facet of adminis
tration, rather than vice versa as it should
be," one observer feels.
Another laments that "authority no longer
relates to education." Final authority in the
universiy, this student feels, should be
"truth,"and all other authority gains its
legitimacy in relation to this primary author
ity.
Dialogue Impossible
Fundamental to the search for truth is
"the courage to attack your convictions." At
least some Stanford students have found this
trait lacking in both the administration and the
faculty. This discovery has had at least two
unfortunate results.
First, some students have by default come
to vest authority in their peers because they
feel the faculty and administration have abdi
cated their responsibility to be self-critical.
This results in education being less challeng
ing than it could be if, these students feel,
they could respect the faculty as searching
minds as well as dispensers of knowledge.
But more broadly, a dialogue about the cur
rent structure of the university is not even
possible because of the attitude of the adminis
tration. "Real disagreement is now impos
sible," one student states. "The joint inquiry
we desire requires questioning assumptions.
The administration is as yet unwilling to do
this."
"Something must be done to challenge their
parochial conception of authority. They won't
recognize student authority or any higher
authority. Stanford has neither the courage
nor the capability to question itself funda
mentally because of its parochialism."
Concomitant to the efforts at bringing up
Father has been the effort to "Bring Leland
off the Farm." The last decade has been the
emergence of Stanford from a rather paroch
ial Western institution to a university of na
tional reputation.
The result of the very deliberate efforts to
upgrade the faculty by bringing to Stanford
people from outside has been to make the be
ginnings, at least, of a process of self-criticism.
In the student body, this process was begun
by people like Allard Lowenstein, who was
for a year director of Stem Hall and taught
in the Political Science department.
"A 1 brought wide experience to a parochial
campus," one former administrator states. "He
came to Stanford at a time when there was a
feeling that major changes were needed. He
gave students confidence that change was
worthwhile and that students could make the
difference in bringing change where it had
before appeared impossible."
For several years, many students feel, the
administration used Lowenstein and the stu
dents he met during his year here as the ex
planation of student activism. The name
"Lowenstein" is not heard often anymore at
Stanford and yet students seem more dedi
cated than ever before to pressing for changes.
Much of the thrust of Lowenstein and stu
dents he inspired was to convince students
that they did have a right to be heard and a
right to be treated as adults. In a sense, these
feelings triggered the rebellion against the

old conception of the role of the student, a
rebellion which took form in the demand for
respect.
But this first rebellion was merely the
establishment of the base on which the real
discussion of education could begin. Now that
student leaders have largely completed the
attack on the facade of the current structure,
they are moving towards positing their own
conception of education. This second of the
two thrusts of student activism is summarized
by the term "integration."
First, students demand that their scholarly
and their social criticism be integrated. Many
students find it hypocritical on the part of the
administration to demand of students a critical
attitude and an openness of mind in the class
room but not to expect the same techniques
and commitments to apply outside the class.
"It seems strange," says one close ob
server of the administration, "that we excite
students about social institutions and then
tell them to keep the valve shut until they
leave."
The basic problem, as analyzed by several
of the most astute student critics, is one of
leadership. Ilene Strelitz, Daily editor, wrote
two years ago, in an editorial titled "Where is
Leadership in the University?":
"The criticism levelled at the student is
consistently in the direction of inaction; don't
step beyond the classroom, don't speak out,
and above all don't hold the lectures in the
classroom and the words in the text as rele
vant to the broad issues of controversy facing
your generation.
Students Make Demands
"This is an odd reversal of roles.
"The student should be criticized. The Presi
dent . . . should demand more confrontation
by the student of the responsibility of the edu
cated to the society. His words should be a
constant barrage of criticism for unawareness,
ignorance of 'the world outside', lack of appli
cation of talents, the need for the university
to be the fearless critic and ethical leader.
'It is the role of leadership to criticize and
to demand action, to pose the questions, not to
prohibit them. The students wait for a leader
to raise up before them.
"... The greatest sadness of all will come
if nothing is done, for the President, the deans,
etc. are leaders, no matter how they construe
that role. And it will be sad if the students are
led into passive and uncaring commitments to
stagnation."
There are strong indications that at least
a significant minority are not heading toward
stagnation, but it seems that many are doing
so in spite of, rather than because of any atti
tudes or policies of the administration. And,
in the strangest irony of all, it is the students
who have been demanding that the university
examine its responsibility to society, that the
university be the "formulator not the reflector
of cultural values," that the university define
itself.
But integration of scholarly and social critic
ism is only one of several types of integration
students have called for. The second type is
the integration of thought and action. Here,
students find inspiration in the words of Pro
fessors Otis Pease and Robert McAfee Brown.
Pease speaks of the paradox between curi
osity and commitment. "A great university,"
he says "may choose to do many things, but
the one thing it must do is to generate curios
ity and a sense of commitment among its stu
dents and teachers. And therein lies a para
dox."
"Curiosity is nothing less than the endless
desire to find truth about something; com
mitment involves the desire to act on what
one believes to be truth."
"It is the task of great teaching to create
an environment in which a person may learn
for himself to resolve this paradox, to learn
how he may fuse curiosity and commitment, so
that each, in reinforcing the other, may to
gether give life to his mind where singly they
would destroy it."
Brown emphasizes that "study and direct
concern cannot properly be separated from
one another."
"The notion that student revolt—whether
over Vietnam or social regulations or racial
injustice—is 'interfering with education' is a
notion incompatible with the recognition that
in the life of the truly educated person,
thought and action are indivisible."
"There is involved here a kind of amalgam
of vision, unrest, dissatisfaction, and a desire
to do something about it all. The task of the
university is not to keep a student separated
from the world, but to involve him more re
sponsibly in it."
For many students, the process has been
reversed: they have found through participa
tion in other social institutions that students
can play an active role in bringing change.
This belief, in turn, has been brought back
to the university, where many of these stu
dents find it increasingly unbearable to be
treated like passive containers into which in
formation is to be poured," says Joseph Katz
of the Institute for the Study of Human Prob
lems.
Katz thinks that the change in student con
sciousness is so drastic as to be "a possible
turning point in educational history.. Similar
to the people of the Renaissance and the
French revolution, students today have a new
consciousness: they feel differently about
themselves and about the world."
Gone is the passive acceptance of the exist
ing society and the individual's role in it. "Stu
dents now feel that they can do something
about their situation. Further, if things are
not as they should be, they feel that it is not
all their fault and that part rests in the social
sructure."
A third thrust of student pressure has been
to integrate the student's status outside the
classroom to his status inside. Much of he con
troversy summed up as "the revolt against
rules and regulations" has been based on the
contention that the student is treated differ
ently in his social life than he is in his aca
demic endeavors.
"There is a certain incongurity in demand
ing a critical attitude in class and assuming
that people can not regulate their own lives,"
one student leader states. "Such hypocrisy
ignores or blurs the facts." And again, lead
ership in the university is questioned.
"Because of this abdication, this refusal by
the administration to face problems," the same
student adds, "the task has fallen to the stu
dents."
All he three previously mentioned "integra
tions" have been mere preliminaries to the
final integration: incorporation of students
into the scholarly community.
Two years ago, in his concluding address
as ASSU President, Bud Wedin stated: "We

have taken a great deal of tolerance and un
derstanding from this community and replaced
it with skill and efficiency. Too often we have
regarded the individual as an object and have
seen him only in relation to rules or regula
tions."
"In short, we seem to have lost the vision of
a democratic university in which all share cer
tain rights of participation in matters of com
mon concern, and of freedom of inquiry, as
sociation, and development, and where pa
ternalism is replaced by fellowship in the
company of scholars."
"Perhaps it is time to review some of the
institutions of our society at Stanford to see
if we are really doing our utmost to produce
students with the intellectual maturity, the
self-assurance, and the sense of dignity and
independence so needed in today's society."
The following fall, a group of students and
faculty members formed the Stanford Associa
tion of University Scholars. The purpose of
the group, according to its founder Bob Rosen,
was "to break false dichotomies. Usually the
students and faculty are thought of in opposi
tion to the 'University.' We think that studens
and faculty, because they are the practicing
scholars, are the University. The administra
tion exists to work for the University, to fa
cilitate the pursuit of knowledge."
SAUS faded away, partially out of an inabil
ity to define itself and partially because the
energy of the participants was directed to
other activities. The participants in SAUS,
Rosen explains, were also involved in larger
political movements as well.
The fact that no new SAUS has arisen is
no sign that students are no longer interested
in education. Quite the contrary, Rosen mam
tains: participation in things such as the ASSU
Education Commission is far more broadly
based than concern over educational reform
ever has been.
"There is now a sincere interest in educa
tional reform," Rosen states, "and an orienta
tion toward acting on ideas. Groups will re
emerge on a formal basis with a fuller, strong
er consensus than SAUS ever had."
Just an opinion about rules and regulations
became part of the popular consciousness at
Stanford in the years following the original
questioning of the system, so now educational
reform has now been accepted.
Expect Change
"Whereas two years ago, no one thought
change possible," another says, "we now ex
pect change because we have had change. In
the election of Harris, it was shown for the
first time that on really important issues, stu
dents are willing to act. The administration
has to make sense now."
And here is no doubt that the administration
is trying harder. As one fringe member puts
it,"The administration pays more attention to
students than it likes to admit. And it is slow
to credit them."
But the reciprocal criticism also applies;
students are reluctant to give recognition to

the administration. The big problem in stu
dent-administration relations two years ago
was communication. The emphasis has shifted
somewhat now as each group recognizes that
where it had before assumed differences of
opinion, it can see now because the lines of
communication have been opened that the dif
ferences are real.
The basic problem seems to be one of trust.
If students felt they were a part of a joint
educational endeavor, in which the main cri
teria for decision-making, was as one observer
states "the engagement of the intellect over
a subject as one aspect of the educational
process," an entirely different atmosphere
would prevail.
By the combination of real participation
and openness which would require redress and
public accountability, the atmosphere of sus
picion could be replaced with one in which
all were moving in the same directions.
What students are calling for is a substan
tial say in determining their own education.
They recall that the term "authority" implies
the consent of the governed; otherwise gov
erning is merely the exercise of power.
Few models have been worked out in detail,
but one theme seems to reappear in almost all
discussions: the theme of community. If agree
ment can be reached on the principles of com
munity, any structure would come from the
consensus almost naturally.
The characteristics students have posited
for the community center around the concep
tion of a core of shared values, which would
include above all openness and freedom from
bias.
This attitude must first be employed, some
students feel, in self-analysis. Without funda
mental questioning of the assumptions upon
which the current structure of the University
is based, not even a beginning can be made
toward achieving community.
And before community is achieved, other
attitudes must change. Community involves
1) having an identification with the Univer
sity over and above loyalty to discipline or
constituency and 2) seeing people as individu
als rather than as representatives of consti
tuencies.
These traits seems to be lacking at Stanford
today and the insulting "power bloc" relation
ships make change appear the result of a vic
tory of one bloc over another rather than a
communal achievement.
As long as students are thought of as stu
dents rather than as more intellects being
"engaged over a subject," power blocs and
their consequent tactics will prevail. When stu
dents feel the frustration of their ideas being
ignored simply because of their status, they
often conclude that "Brinksmanship" is the
only way to push Stanford over the edge of
greatness.

Hopefully, the set of relations now pri
ing will be transcended, but one suspects
the structure and its occupants have bee
so identified with each other that m
change is impossible during the current
eration of either students or administrators.
Part of the gap between students and the
administration, which seems too much to
bridge: is the difference in values. In the case
of the current crop of students, the difference
seems to be more than is accountable by any
merely generational gap.
This generation tends to put the emphasis
on operations rather than content as the way
to authenticating a moral system.
"We are more open-minded and less dog
matic," one student explains. "We have a rela
tivistic conception of moral values and believe
that allowing people to develop themselves,
rather than imposing on them a system of
values, is the way to bring a happy society."
But the era of student-administration rela
tions may have come to an end, or at least a
lessening in intensity, for the recent ASSU
campaign was run on educational reform,
which will necessitate more dealing with the
faculty.
Opinion varies as to whether curricular
change will come more easily or with greater
difficulty than have the changes over rules
and regulations.
One administrator feels that "the difficult
changes are the visible ones. Those are now
past. Educational reform can be approached
on honest intellectual grounds, which was not
possible when the battles were being fought
in the public press."
On the other hand, curricular criticism can
often be interpreted as an attack on the pro
fessional autonomy of the professor. And even
more desperately, some students feel that the
refusal to be self-critical applies to the faculty
as well as the administration.
Faculty Paternalism
The administrative mentality causing a com
modity view of education in the administra
tion has pervaded the faculty as well. Pa
ternalism here is reflected in an attitude of
dispensing knowledge to a passive receptacle.
And just as with paternalism in the admin
istration, paternalism in the faculty is hard to
puncture. Some students have found a real
unwillingness on the part of some faculty
members to be honestly evaluative of their
own achievements or to confront students as
authorities in their own right.
A third body of opinion on curricular reform
holds that the administration, not the faculty,
is the key to reform because its conception of
education is the prevailing one.
This group feels that questions about foun
dations must be asked of a structure which
emphasizes passive receptivity. Regurgitation
of knowledge as a basis of determining level
of education seems to some students to reflect
Stanford's overbalance on the side of accomo
dating society.
Dave Harris based his campaign upon dis
satisfaction with the existing structure and he
analyzes his election as "an expression of stu
dent discontent, a broad emotional statement
of dissatisfaction with the type of education
given here and the student's role in it."
Education at Stanford, he says, is viewed as
"indoctrination, not participation. The student
is treated as a second-class citizen in the com
munity; his life is fragmented."
He would like to see students participating
in an "integrative four-year experience rather
than in a training period."
His preliminary plans for next year include
activities on two fronts. First, the fifty or so
people who recently signed up to work in his
organization will devote must of their efforts
to research in the fields of education, decision
making, student rights, and housing.
Second, under the heading of special Presi
dential programs, Harris is planning to back
an experimental college "to build in the mi
crocosm what we want in the macrocosm,"
and hopes to sponsor a national conference on
education.
The recent analysis by Katz and Nevitt San
ford of student activism nationally (Saturday
Review, December) has remarkable applica
tion to the situation at Stanford. They say that
the "demand for participation does not stem
from any desire to make college life easier.
Rather it springs from a profound attempt to
seek answers as to how one might achieve
such ends as a reliable personal identity, com
munity with other people, and social objectives
that will bring comfort and justice to those
largely bereft of them in our society."
Level Of Investigation
Their research shows that "the socially in
volved students total not more than 15 per
cent, but the movement can no longer be con
trolled by dealing with the minority alone, be
cause it is expressing the frustrations and as
pirations now shared by the majority of stu
dents."
The current situation represents a unique
opportunity to college administations, they
say. "Administrators who can find some way
to respond to what is human, though some
times chaotically expressed, in these under
graduate students, will find that they are go
ing to be part of a truly revolutionary phase
in the history of education."
"While the eighteenth century discovered
that good government depends upon the con
sent of the governed, our generation has the
opportunity of discovering and bringing to
fruition a system of education that is based
upon the consent of the educated."
On purely pragmatic grounds, encourage
ment of student participation in educational
reform is desirable, because, as one student
commented last spring in reaction to a speech
by President Sterling: "The 'Stanford student
movement'—if indeed, a movement exists as
such—does not represent a rebellious asser
tion of 'student autonomy' but, rather, a con
sidered and concerncd effort to help create a
better, more challenging university for those
students who follow."
There have been several signs since that
time that President Sterling shares much the
same opinion. At a recent alumni conference,
he commented that one strain of student pro
test shows "a genuine interest in the construc
tive task of improving education."
Recognition of the sincerity and construc
tive purpose of many student activists is cer
tainly welcome, but "what they desire most is
the appearance of forceful and self-critical
leadership dedicated to educational reform.
When that leadership becomes visible, stu
dents will at last be able to say that the proc
ess of bringing up father has been completed.


"Klein proposes embellishments on the cur
rent structure; I reject the asumptions on
which the current structure is based."
These words of ASSU President-elect Dave
Harris, spoken during a campaign debate
against Bob Klein, symbolize several years
of student activism at Stanford and serve as
a harbinger of the new direction in which
student activism has begun to turn.
Historically, student concern at Stanford has
been expressed in two broad areas. The first
is a rebellion against the existing conception
of the role of the student. Much of the work
of the past half decade has been to remove
the image of the student as a passive recep
tacle to be treated rather arbitrarily and pa
ternalistically.
But running beneath the surface demands
for respect and participation has been a steady
current asking questions of a much broader
nature, such as what is a university and what
is its relation to society. These questions have
either not been answered or have not been
answered satisfactorily.
It is this dilemma of looking for leadership,
not finding it, and consequently vesting au
thority in themselves that has caused the sec
ond thrust of student activists. If the adminis
ration is incapable or unwilling to articulate
a philosophy of education, some students have
said, we will begin the dialogue alone.
Both strands of the protest—that ag3 ?r,t! t
an anachronistic and degrading set of rules
and the call for discussion of broader educa
tional issues—was summarized two years ago
by one student observer:
"In the minds of many student leaders, arbi
trariness is at once a direct function of an un
necessarily paternal attitude on the part of
the administration and a denial of the essen
tial academic nature of the University."
"Students fear a vacuum—the lack of a co
herent philosophy of education at the top of
the administrative structure. They ask the
question, "Where is the leadership?" and are
forced to conclude it is nowhere if not in them
selves."
Bringing Up Father
Given the essentially paternalistic attitude
of the administration and the students' self
imposed tasi of educating the administration
on what thej feel to be some basic educational
concepts, th history of Stanford in recent
years might be titled "Bringing Up Father."
The significance of the Harris election, com
ing at the same time that most of the battles
over rules and regulations have been won, is
that student energy, and in turn administration
energy, will at last be concentrated on the sec
ond of the two areas of thrust: the attempt to
define and to work toward a new conception of
education.
But before students could begin asking
questions about the nature of their education,
they had to achieve a status in which they
were listened to. Much of the effort of the last
five years has been to gain this position. It
has been manifested as rebellion against the
role assigned to students by the administra
tion.
Basically, what the students have rebelled
against is being treated as immature and
being treated as things. Both flow from an
administrative mentality which student lead
ers think is essentially paternalistic and fre
quently arbitrary.
Paternalism is characterized by over-pro
tectiveness. It is the attitude that "we know
your best interest." Paternalism should at
least be personal, critics say, but it is not
when it is combined with the administrative
mentality which, in the words of one faculty
member "puts a premium on efficiency, and
peace and quiet."
"The person is taken out for the common
good, expediting the educational process,"
another professor points out. This has two
unfortunate consequences. First, something
has gone terribly wrong when people and their
development, those things which should be the
central concern of education, are ignored. But
more importantly, the system is self-perpetu
ating. If one assumes that the system he op
erates functions well and he dismisses critic
ism as being uninformed or as coming from
people too young to understand, the system
is impregnable.
It is for this reason that students have been
turned a deaf ear when they have raised the
broader issues, such as the nature of the uni
versity's relation to society. And, unfortun
ately, these types of questions have arisen as
natural consequences of questioning the sys
tem of dealing with students.
For example, the administrative mentality
that students have criticized" is a sytom of
what some critics term commodity education.
"There is a cultural assumption in Ameri
ca," one observer points out, "that institu
tions of society produce commodities." The
university is an institution and what it pro
duces are trained minds, components for the
assembly line of society.
Dual Responsibility
The broad issue which Stanford has not
faced, critics say, is to bring into balance the
university's dual set of relations to society.
As transmitter of the cultural heritage, the
university is in an accommodating role to soci
ety. It has the responsibility of preparing the
new generation to take control of the institu
tions of society.
But secondly, the university is critic of the
culture being transmitted. In this second role,
it conflicts with society.
The more articulate students feel that Stan
ford has become overbalanced on the side of
accomodation to society. As former ASSU
President Bud Wedin wrote in a recent article
on education at Stanford: "unlike Faustus
who sold his soul to the devil for more honor
able reasons, Stanford has aligned itself with
the biases and norms of the technological
society for want of any soul at all."
Another unfortunate result of the adminis
tration's refusal to listen to students is that
they feel compelled out of frustration to use
forceful tactics.
"They don't understand that what we say
has merit," one student leader states. "And on
the other hand, we don't understand them
because they don't explain their actions to
us." When the gap between students and ad
ministration is as large as it apparently is,
another states, "the situation suggests per
haps some inadequacy to mere discussion."
The administration has learned to listen
over the last half decade to what students
are saying and thus drastic tactics have not
been used. Explanations of this phenomenon

vary, however. The pessimists maintain that
"a lot of the change hasn't been basic attitud
inal change. It was merely strategic change
due to pressure.
The administration has played a holding
game, one adherent of this position main
tains, in the hope that "the activist minority
would graduate and this would all be over."
The significance of the Harris election, this
observer says, is to prove that pressure for
change "is not a temporary aberration caused
by a scapegoat figure."
The other side maintains that there has
been a very definite maturing process on the
part of the administration. One member of
the administration maintains, "we are no
longer over-reacting; we have more confi
dence and a better time perspective."
A slightly cynical student adds: "They know
they just can't do certain things now that
they could a few years ago. The old ploy of
divide and conquer won't work; if a minority

is being isolated and treated unjustly, a sub
stantial segment of the community will rise
in their defense."
In response to continued student demands
for change, some of the most sensitive admin
istrators (there are at least three or four
people over thirty in the administration who
can be trusted) have suggested tactics which
they feel would be the most effective for
students.
The list of one, Associate Undergraauate
Dean Robert Hind, reads as follows: • arm
yourself with facts; • go to the appropriate
person; • be open-minded; • concentrate on
academic improvement rather than peripheral
matters.
Associate Dean of Students Joel Smith sug
gests that "students are paid more attention
on pragmatic questions where they have rele
vant information. Their effect is limited when
they talk about the structure of the univers
ity."
But what Stanford has lacked, the articulate
students feel, is analysis of the structure.
"Without a discussion and an articulation of a
broad concept of education." One retired stu
dent leader states, "Stanford can only have
accretions to the current structure." And the
current structure he and many others regard
as inadequate.
The underlying criticism is a challenge of
the existing conception of authority.
The problem arises from a confusion be
tween education and administration. The uni
versity is an institution of society and thus
has a governing body. But the authority vested
ih it is only for administrative matters.
"The administration and the trustees tend
to think of education as one facet of adminis
tration, rather than vice versa as it should
be," one observer feels.
Another laments that "authority no longer
relates to education." Final authority in the
universiy, this student feels, should be
"truth,"and all other authority gains its
legitimacy in relation to this primary author
ity.
Dialogue Impossible
Fundamental to the search for truth is
"the courage to attack your convictions." At
least some Stanford students have found this
trait lacking in both the administration and the
faculty. This discovery has had at least two
unfortunate results.
First, some students have by default come
to vest authority in their peers because they
feel the faculty and administration have abdi
cated their responsibility to be self-critical.
This results in education being less challeng
ing than it could be if, these students feel,
they could respect the faculty as searching
minds as well as dispensers of knowledge.
But more broadly, a dialogue about the cur
rent structure of the university is not even
possible because of the attitude of the adminis
tration. "Real disagreement is now impos
sible," one student states. "The joint inquiry
we desire requires questioning assumptions.
The administration is as yet unwilling to do
this."
"Something must be done to challenge their
parochial conception of authority. They won't
recognize student authority or any higher
authority. Stanford has neither the courage
nor the capability to question itself funda
mentally because of its parochialism."
Concomitant to the efforts at bringing up
Father has been the effort to "Bring Leland
off the Farm." The last decade has been the
emergence of Stanford from a rather paroch
ial Western institution to a university of na
tional reputation.
The result of the very deliberate efforts to
upgrade the faculty by bringing to Stanford
people from outside has been to make the be
ginnings, at least, of a process of self-criticism.
In the student body, this process was begun
by people like Allard Lowenstein, who was
for a year director of Stem Hall and taught
in the Political Science department.
"A 1 brought wide experience to a parochial
campus," one former administrator states. "He
came to Stanford at a time when there was a
feeling that major changes were needed. He
gave students confidence that change was
worthwhile and that students could make the
difference in bringing change where it had
before appeared impossible."
For several years, many students feel, the
administration used Lowenstein and the stu
dents he met during his year here as the ex
planation of student activism. The name
"Lowenstein" is not heard often anymore at
Stanford and yet students seem more dedi
cated than ever before to pressing for changes.
Much of the thrust of Lowenstein and stu
dents he inspired was to convince students
that they did have a right to be heard and a
right to be treated as adults. In a sense, these
feelings triggered the rebellion against the

old conception of the role of the student, a
rebellion which took form in the demand for
respect.
But this first rebellion was merely the
establishment of the base on which the real
discussion of education could begin. Now that
student leaders have largely completed the
attack on the facade of the current structure,
they are moving towards positing their own
conception of education. This second of the
two thrusts of student activism is summarized
by the term "integration."
First, students demand that their scholarly
and their social criticism be integrated. Many
students find it hypocritical on the part of the
administration to demand of students a critical
attitude and an openness of mind in the class
room but not to expect the same techniques
and commitments to apply outside the class.
"It seems strange," says one close ob
server of the administration, "that we excite
students about social institutions and then
tell them to keep the valve shut until they
leave."
The basic problem, as analyzed by several
of the most astute student critics, is one of
leadership. Ilene Strelitz, Daily editor, wrote
two years ago, in an editorial titled "Where is
Leadership in the University?":
"The criticism levelled at the student is
consistently in the direction of inaction; don't
step beyond the classroom, don't speak out,
and above all don't hold the lectures in the
classroom and the words in the text as rele
vant to the broad issues of controversy facing
your generation.
Students Make Demands
"This is an odd reversal of roles.
"The student should be criticized. The Presi
dent . . . should demand more confrontation
by the student of the responsibility of the edu
cated to the society. His words should be a
constant barrage of criticism for unawareness,
ignorance of 'the world outside', lack of appli
cation of talents, the need for the university
to be the fearless critic and ethical leader.
'It is the role of leadership to criticize and
to demand action, to pose the questions, not to
prohibit them. The students wait for a leader
to raise up before them.
"... The greatest sadness of all will come
if nothing is done, for the President, the deans,
etc. are leaders, no matter how they construe
that role. And it will be sad if the students are
led into passive and uncaring commitments to
stagnation."
There are strong indications that at least
a significant minority are not heading toward
stagnation, but it seems that many are doing
so in spite of, rather than because of any atti
tudes or policies of the administration. And,
in the strangest irony of all, it is the students
who have been demanding that the university
examine its responsibility to society, that the
university be the "formulator not the reflector
of cultural values," that the university define
itself.
But integration of scholarly and social critic
ism is only one of several types of integration
students have called for. The second type is
the integration of thought and action. Here,
students find inspiration in the words of Pro
fessors Otis Pease and Robert McAfee Brown.
Pease speaks of the paradox between curi
osity and commitment. "A great university,"
he says "may choose to do many things, but
the one thing it must do is to generate curios
ity and a sense of commitment among its stu
dents and teachers. And therein lies a para
dox."
"Curiosity is nothing less than the endless
desire to find truth about something; com
mitment involves the desire to act on what
one believes to be truth."
"It is the task of great teaching to create
an environment in which a person may learn
for himself to resolve this paradox, to learn
how he may fuse curiosity and commitment, so
that each, in reinforcing the other, may to
gether give life to his mind where singly they
would destroy it."
Brown emphasizes that "study and direct
concern cannot properly be separated from
one another."
"The notion that student revolt—whether
over Vietnam or social regulations or racial
injustice—is 'interfering with education' is a
notion incompatible with the recognition that
in the life of the truly educated person,
thought and action are indivisible."
"There is involved here a kind of amalgam
of vision, unrest, dissatisfaction, and a desire
to do something about it all. The task of the
university is not to keep a student separated
from the world, but to involve him more re
sponsibly in it."
For many students, the process has been
reversed: they have found through participa
tion in other social institutions that students
can play an active role in bringing change.
This belief, in turn, has been brought back
to the university, where many of these stu
dents find it increasingly unbearable to be
treated like passive containers into which in
formation is to be poured," says Joseph Katz
of the Institute for the Study of Human Prob
lems.
Katz thinks that the change in student con
sciousness is so drastic as to be "a possible
turning point in educational history.. Similar
to the people of the Renaissance and the
French revolution, students today have a new
consciousness: they feel differently about
themselves and about the world."
Gone is the passive acceptance of the exist
ing society and the individual's role in it. "Stu
dents now feel that they can do something
about their situation. Further, if things are
not as they should be, they feel that it is not
all their fault and that part rests in the social
sructure."
A third thrust of student pressure has been
to integrate the student's status outside the
classroom to his status inside. Much of he con
troversy summed up as "the revolt against
rules and regulations" has been based on the
contention that the student is treated differ
ently in his social life than he is in his aca
demic endeavors.
"There is a certain incongurity in demand
ing a critical attitude in class and assuming
that people can not regulate their own lives,"
one student leader states. "Such hypocrisy
ignores or blurs the facts." And again, lead
ership in the university is questioned.
"Because of this abdication, this refusal by
the administration to face problems," the same
student adds, "the task has fallen to the stu
dents."
All he three previously mentioned "integra
tions" have been mere preliminaries to the
final integration: incorporation of students
into the scholarly community.
Two years ago, in his concluding address
as ASSU President, Bud Wedin stated: "We

have taken a great deal of tolerance and un
derstanding from this community and replaced
it with skill and efficiency. Too often we have
regarded the individual as an object and have
seen him only in relation to rules or regula
tions."
"In short, we seem to have lost the vision of
a democratic university in which all share cer
tain rights of participation in matters of com
mon concern, and of freedom of inquiry, as
sociation, and development, and where pa
ternalism is replaced by fellowship in the
company of scholars."
"Perhaps it is time to review some of the
institutions of our society at Stanford to see
if we are really doing our utmost to produce
students with the intellectual maturity, the
self-assurance, and the sense of dignity and
independence so needed in today's society."
The following fall, a group of students and
faculty members formed the Stanford Associa
tion of University Scholars. The purpose of
the group, according to its founder Bob Rosen,
was "to break false dichotomies. Usually the
students and faculty are thought of in opposi
tion to the 'University.' We think that studens
and faculty, because they are the practicing
scholars, are the University. The administra
tion exists to work for the University, to fa
cilitate the pursuit of knowledge."
SAUS faded away, partially out of an inabil
ity to define itself and partially because the
energy of the participants was directed to
other activities. The participants in SAUS,
Rosen explains, were also involved in larger
political movements as well.
The fact that no new SAUS has arisen is
no sign that students are no longer interested
in education. Quite the contrary, Rosen mam
tains: participation in things such as the ASSU
Education Commission is far more broadly
based than concern over educational reform
ever has been.
"There is now a sincere interest in educa
tional reform," Rosen states, "and an orienta
tion toward acting on ideas. Groups will re
emerge on a formal basis with a fuller, strong
er consensus than SAUS ever had."
Just an opinion about rules and regulations
became part of the popular consciousness at
Stanford in the years following the original
questioning of the system, so now educational
reform has now been accepted.
Expect Change
"Whereas two years ago, no one thought
change possible," another says, "we now ex
pect change because we have had change. In
the election of Harris, it was shown for the
first time that on really important issues, stu
dents are willing to act. The administration
has to make sense now."
And here is no doubt that the administration
is trying harder. As one fringe member puts
it,"The administration pays more attention to
students than it likes to admit. And it is slow
to credit them."
But the reciprocal criticism also applies;
students are reluctant to give recognition to

the administration. The big problem in stu
dent-administration relations two years ago
was communication. The emphasis has shifted
somewhat now as each group recognizes that
where it had before assumed differences of
opinion, it can see now because the lines of
communication have been opened that the dif
ferences are real.
The basic problem seems to be one of trust.
If students felt they were a part of a joint
educational endeavor, in which the main cri
teria for decision-making, was as one observer
states "the engagement of the intellect over
a subject as one aspect of the educational
process," an entirely different atmosphere
would prevail.
By the combination of real participation
and openness which would require redress and
public accountability, the atmosphere of sus
picion could be replaced with one in which
all were moving in the same directions.
What students are calling for is a substan
tial say in determining their own education.
They recall that the term "authority" implies
the consent of the governed; otherwise gov
erning is merely the exercise of power.
Few models have been worked out in detail,
but one theme seems to reappear in almost all
discussions: the theme of community. If agree
ment can be reached on the principles of com
munity, any structure would come from the
consensus almost naturally.
The characteristics students have posited
for the community center around the concep
tion of a core of shared values, which would
include above all openness and freedom from
bias.
This attitude must first be employed, some
students feel, in self-analysis. Without funda
mental questioning of the assumptions upon
which the current structure of the University
is based, not even a beginning can be made
toward achieving community.
And before community is achieved, other
attitudes must change. Community involves
1) having an identification with the Univer
sity over and above loyalty to discipline or
constituency and 2) seeing people as individu
als rather than as representatives of consti
tuencies.
These traits seems to be lacking at Stanford
today and the insulting "power bloc" relation
ships make change appear the result of a vic
tory of one bloc over another rather than a
communal achievement.
As long as students are thought of as stu
dents rather than as more intellects being
"engaged over a subject," power blocs and
their consequent tactics will prevail. When stu
dents feel the frustration of their ideas being
ignored simply because of their status, they
often conclude that "Brinksmanship" is the
only way to push Stanford over the edge of
greatness.

Hopefully, the set of relations now pri
ing will be transcended, but one suspects
the structure and its occupants have bee
so identified with each other that m
change is impossible during the current
eration of either students or administrators.
Part of the gap between students and the
administration, which seems too much to
bridge: is the difference in values. In the case
of the current crop of students, the difference
seems to be more than is accountable by any
merely generational gap.
This generation tends to put the emphasis
on operations rather than content as the way
to authenticating a moral system.
"We are more open-minded and less dog
matic," one student explains. "We have a rela
tivistic conception of moral values and believe
that allowing people to develop themselves,
rather than imposing on them a system of
values, is the way to bring a happy society."
But the era of student-administration rela
tions may have come to an end, or at least a
lessening in intensity, for the recent ASSU
campaign was run on educational reform,
which will necessitate more dealing with the
faculty.
Opinion varies as to whether curricular
change will come more easily or with greater
difficulty than have the changes over rules
and regulations.
One administrator feels that "the difficult
changes are the visible ones. Those are now
past. Educational reform can be approached
on honest intellectual grounds, which was not
possible when the battles were being fought
in the public press."
On the other hand, curricular criticism can
often be interpreted as an attack on the pro
fessional autonomy of the professor. And even
more desperately, some students feel that the
refusal to be self-critical applies to the faculty
as well as the administration.
Faculty Paternalism
The administrative mentality causing a com
modity view of education in the administra
tion has pervaded the faculty as well. Pa
ternalism here is reflected in an attitude of
dispensing knowledge to a passive receptacle.
And just as with paternalism in the admin
istration, paternalism in the faculty is hard to
puncture. Some students have found a real
unwillingness on the part of some faculty
members to be honestly evaluative of their
own achievements or to confront students as
authorities in their own right.
A third body of opinion on curricular reform
holds that the administration, not the faculty,
is the key to reform because its conception of
education is the prevailing one.
This group feels that questions about foun
dations must be asked of a structure which
emphasizes passive receptivity. Regurgitation
of knowledge as a basis of determining level
of education seems to some students to reflect
Stanford's overbalance on the side of accomo
dating society.
Dave Harris based his campaign upon dis
satisfaction with the existing structure and he
analyzes his election as "an expression of stu
dent discontent, a broad emotional statement
of dissatisfaction with the type of education
given here and the student's role in it."
Education at Stanford, he says, is viewed as
"indoctrination, not participation. The student
is treated as a second-class citizen in the com
munity; his life is fragmented."
He would like to see students participating
in an "integrative four-year experience rather
than in a training period."
His preliminary plans for next year include
activities on two fronts. First, the fifty or so
people who recently signed up to work in his
organization will devote must of their efforts
to research in the fields of education, decision
making, student rights, and housing.
Second, under the heading of special Presi
dential programs, Harris is planning to back
an experimental college "to build in the mi
crocosm what we want in the macrocosm,"
and hopes to sponsor a national conference on
education.
The recent analysis by Katz and Nevitt San
ford of student activism nationally (Saturday
Review, December) has remarkable applica
tion to the situation at Stanford. They say that
the "demand for participation does not stem
from any desire to make college life easier.
Rather it springs from a profound attempt to
seek answers as to how one might achieve
such ends as a reliable personal identity, com
munity with other people, and social objectives
that will bring comfort and justice to those
largely bereft of them in our society."
Level Of Investigation
Their research shows that "the socially in
volved students total not more than 15 per
cent, but the movement can no longer be con
trolled by dealing with the minority alone, be
cause it is expressing the frustrations and as
pirations now shared by the majority of stu
dents."
The current situation represents a unique
opportunity to college administations, they
say. "Administrators who can find some way
to respond to what is human, though some
times chaotically expressed, in these under
graduate students, will find that they are go
ing to be part of a truly revolutionary phase
in the history of education."
"While the eighteenth century discovered
that good government depends upon the con
sent of the governed, our generation has the
opportunity of discovering and bringing to
fruition a system of education that is based
upon the consent of the educated."
On purely pragmatic grounds, encourage
ment of student participation in educational
reform is desirable, because, as one student
commented last spring in reaction to a speech
by President Sterling: "The 'Stanford student
movement'—if indeed, a movement exists as
such—does not represent a rebellious asser
tion of 'student autonomy' but, rather, a con
sidered and concerncd effort to help create a
better, more challenging university for those
students who follow."
There have been several signs since that
time that President Sterling shares much the
same opinion. At a recent alumni conference,
he commented that one strain of student pro
test shows "a genuine interest in the construc
tive task of improving education."
Recognition of the sincerity and construc
tive purpose of many student activists is cer
tainly welcome, but "what they desire most is
the appearance of forceful and self-critical
leadership dedicated to educational reform.
When that leadership becomes visible, stu
dents will at last be able to say that the proc
ess of bringing up father has been completed.


"Klein proposes embellishments on the cur
rent structure; I reject the asumptions on
which the current structure is based."
These words of ASSU President-elect Dave
Harris, spoken during a campaign debate
against Bob Klein, symbolize several years
of student activism at Stanford and serve as
a harbinger of the new direction in which
student activism has begun to turn.
Historically, student concern at Stanford has
been expressed in two broad areas. The first
is a rebellion against the existing conception
of the role of the student. Much of the work
of the past half decade has been to remove
the image of the student as a passive recep
tacle to be treated rather arbitrarily and pa
ternalistically.
But running beneath the surface demands
for respect and participation has been a steady
current asking questions of a much broader
nature, such as what is a university and what
is its relation to society. These questions have
either not been answered or have not been
answered satisfactorily.
It is this dilemma of looking for leadership,
not finding it, and consequently vesting au
thority in themselves that has caused the sec
ond thrust of student activists. If the adminis
ration is incapable or unwilling to articulate
a philosophy of education, some students have
said, we will begin the dialogue alone.
Both strands of the protest—that ag3 ?r,t! t
an anachronistic and degrading set of rules
and the call for discussion of broader educa
tional issues—was summarized two years ago
by one student observer:
"In the minds of many student leaders, arbi
trariness is at once a direct function of an un
necessarily paternal attitude on the part of
the administration and a denial of the essen
tial academic nature of the University."
"Students fear a vacuum—the lack of a co
herent philosophy of education at the top of
the administrative structure. They ask the
question, "Where is the leadership?" and are
forced to conclude it is nowhere if not in them
selves."
Bringing Up Father
Given the essentially paternalistic attitude
of the administration and the students' self
imposed tasi of educating the administration
on what thej feel to be some basic educational
concepts, th history of Stanford in recent
years might be titled "Bringing Up Father."
The significance of the Harris election, com
ing at the same time that most of the battles
over rules and regulations have been won, is
that student energy, and in turn administration
energy, will at last be concentrated on the sec
ond of the two areas of thrust: the attempt to
define and to work toward a new conception of
education.
But before students could begin asking
questions about the nature of their education,
they had to achieve a status in which they
were listened to. Much of the effort of the last
five years has been to gain this position. It
has been manifested as rebellion against the
role assigned to students by the administra
tion.
Basically, what the students have rebelled
against is being treated as immature and
being treated as things. Both flow from an
administrative mentality which student lead
ers think is essentially paternalistic and fre
quently arbitrary.
Paternalism is characterized by over-pro
tectiveness. It is the attitude that "we know
your best interest." Paternalism should at
least be personal, critics say, but it is not
when it is combined with the administrative
mentality which, in the words of one faculty
member "puts a premium on efficiency, and
peace and quiet."
"The person is taken out for the common
good, expediting the educational process,"
another professor points out. This has two
unfortunate consequences. First, something
has gone terribly wrong when people and their
development, those things which should be the
central concern of education, are ignored. But
more importantly, the system is self-perpetu
ating. If one assumes that the system he op
erates functions well and he dismisses critic
ism as being uninformed or as coming from
people too young to understand, the system
is impregnable.
It is for this reason that students have been
turned a deaf ear when they have raised the
broader issues, such as the nature of the uni
versity's relation to society. And, unfortun
ately, these types of questions have arisen as
natural consequences of questioning the sys
tem of dealing with students.
For example, the administrative mentality
that students have criticized" is a sytom of
what some critics term commodity education.
"There is a cultural assumption in Ameri
ca," one observer points out, "that institu
tions of society produce commodities." The
university is an institution and what it pro
duces are trained minds, components for the
assembly line of society.
Dual Responsibility
The broad issue which Stanford has not
faced, critics say, is to bring into balance the
university's dual set of relations to society.
As transmitter of the cultural heritage, the
university is in an accommodating role to soci
ety. It has the responsibility of preparing the
new generation to take control of the institu
tions of society.
But secondly, the university is critic of the
culture being transmitted. In this second role,
it conflicts with society.
The more articulate students feel that Stan
ford has become overbalanced on the side of
accomodation to society. As former ASSU
President Bud Wedin wrote in a recent article
on education at Stanford: "unlike Faustus
who sold his soul to the devil for more honor
able reasons, Stanford has aligned itself with
the biases and norms of the technological
society for want of any soul at all."
Another unfortunate result of the adminis
tration's refusal to listen to students is that
they feel compelled out of frustration to use
forceful tactics.
"They don't understand that what we say
has merit," one student leader states. "And on
the other hand, we don't understand them
because they don't explain their actions to
us." When the gap between students and ad
ministration is as large as it apparently is,
another states, "the situation suggests per
haps some inadequacy to mere discussion."
The administration has learned to listen
over the last half decade to what students
are saying and thus drastic tactics have not
been used. Explanations of this phenomenon

vary, however. The pessimists maintain that
"a lot of the change hasn't been basic attitud
inal change. It was merely strategic change
due to pressure.
The administration has played a holding
game, one adherent of this position main
tains, in the hope that "the activist minority
would graduate and this would all be over."
The significance of the Harris election, this
observer says, is to prove that pressure for
change "is not a temporary aberration caused
by a scapegoat figure."
The other side maintains that there has
been a very definite maturing process on the
part of the administration. One member of
the administration maintains, "we are no
longer over-reacting; we have more confi
dence and a better time perspective."
A slightly cynical student adds: "They know
they just can't do certain things now that
they could a few years ago. The old ploy of
divide and conquer won't work; if a minority

is being isolated and treated unjustly, a sub
stantial segment of the community will rise
in their defense."
In response to continued student demands
for change, some of the most sensitive admin
istrators (there are at least three or four
people over thirty in the administration who
can be trusted) have suggested tactics which
they feel would be the most effective for
students.
The list of one, Associate Undergraauate
Dean Robert Hind, reads as follows: • arm
yourself with facts; • go to the appropriate
person; • be open-minded; • concentrate on
academic improvement rather than peripheral
matters.
Associate Dean of Students Joel Smith sug
gests that "students are paid more attention
on pragmatic questions where they have rele
vant information. Their effect is limited when
they talk about the structure of the univers
ity."
But what Stanford has lacked, the articulate
students feel, is analysis of the structure.
"Without a discussion and an articulation of a
broad concept of education." One retired stu
dent leader states, "Stanford can only have
accretions to the current structure." And the
current structure he and many others regard
as inadequate.
The underlying criticism is a challenge of
the existing conception of authority.
The problem arises from a confusion be
tween education and administration. The uni
versity is an institution of society and thus
has a governing body. But the authority vested
ih it is only for administrative matters.
"The administration and the trustees tend
to think of education as one facet of adminis
tration, rather than vice versa as it should
be," one observer feels.
Another laments that "authority no longer
relates to education." Final authority in the
universiy, this student feels, should be
"truth,"and all other authority gains its
legitimacy in relation to this primary author
ity.
Dialogue Impossible
Fundamental to the search for truth is
"the courage to attack your convictions." At
least some Stanford students have found this
trait lacking in both the administration and the
faculty. This discovery has had at least two
unfortunate results.
First, some students have by default come
to vest authority in their peers because they
feel the faculty and administration have abdi
cated their responsibility to be self-critical.
This results in education being less challeng
ing than it could be if, these students feel,
they could respect the faculty as searching
minds as well as dispensers of knowledge.
But more broadly, a dialogue about the cur
rent structure of the university is not even
possible because of the attitude of the adminis
tration. "Real disagreement is now impos
sible," one student states. "The joint inquiry
we desire requires questioning assumptions.
The administration is as yet unwilling to do
this."
"Something must be done to challenge their
parochial conception of authority. They won't
recognize student authority or any higher
authority. Stanford has neither the courage
nor the capability to question itself funda
mentally because of its parochialism."
Concomitant to the efforts at bringing up
Father has been the effort to "Bring Leland
off the Farm." The last decade has been the
emergence of Stanford from a rather paroch
ial Western institution to a university of na
tional reputation.
The result of the very deliberate efforts to
upgrade the faculty by bringing to Stanford
people from outside has been to make the be
ginnings, at least, of a process of self-criticism.
In the student body, this process was begun
by people like Allard Lowenstein, who was
for a year director of Stem Hall and taught
in the Political Science department.
"A 1 brought wide experience to a parochial
campus," one former administrator states. "He
came to Stanford at a time when there was a
feeling that major changes were needed. He
gave students confidence that change was
worthwhile and that students could make the
difference in bringing change where it had
before appeared impossible."
For several years, many students feel, the
administration used Lowenstein and the stu
dents he met during his year here as the ex
planation of student activism. The name
"Lowenstein" is not heard often anymore at
Stanford and yet students seem more dedi
cated than ever before to pressing for changes.
Much of the thrust of Lowenstein and stu
dents he inspired was to convince students
that they did have a right to be heard and a
right to be treated as adults. In a sense, these
feelings triggered the rebellion against the

old conception of the role of the student, a
rebellion which took form in the demand for
respect.
But this first rebellion was merely the
establishment of the base on which the real
discussion of education could begin. Now that
student leaders have largely completed the
attack on the facade of the current structure,
they are moving towards positing their own
conception of education. This second of the
two thrusts of student activism is summarized
by the term "integration."
First, students demand that their scholarly
and their social criticism be integrated. Many
students find it hypocritical on the part of the
administration to demand of students a critical
attitude and an openness of mind in the class
room but not to expect the same techniques
and commitments to apply outside the class.
"It seems strange," says one close ob
server of the administration, "that we excite
students about social institutions and then
tell them to keep the valve shut until they
leave."
The basic problem, as analyzed by several
of the most astute student critics, is one of
leadership. Ilene Strelitz, Daily editor, wrote
two years ago, in an editorial titled "Where is
Leadership in the University?":
"The criticism levelled at the student is
consistently in the direction of inaction; don't
step beyond the classroom, don't speak out,
and above all don't hold the lectures in the
classroom and the words in the text as rele
vant to the broad issues of controversy facing
your generation.
Students Make Demands
"This is an odd reversal of roles.
"The student should be criticized. The Presi
dent . . . should demand more confrontation
by the student of the responsibility of the edu
cated to the society. His words should be a
constant barrage of criticism for unawareness,
ignorance of 'the world outside', lack of appli
cation of talents, the need for the university
to be the fearless critic and ethical leader.
'It is the role of leadership to criticize and
to demand action, to pose the questions, not to
prohibit them. The students wait for a leader
to raise up before them.
"... The greatest sadness of all will come
if nothing is done, for the President, the deans,
etc. are leaders, no matter how they construe
that role. And it will be sad if the students are
led into passive and uncaring commitments to
stagnation."
There are strong indications that at least
a significant minority are not heading toward
stagnation, but it seems that many are doing
so in spite of, rather than because of any atti
tudes or policies of the administration. And,
in the strangest irony of all, it is the students
who have been demanding that the university
examine its responsibility to society, that the
university be the "formulator not the reflector
of cultural values," that the university define
itself.
But integration of scholarly and social critic
ism is only one of several types of integration
students have called for. The second type is
the integration of thought and action. Here,
students find inspiration in the words of Pro
fessors Otis Pease and Robert McAfee Brown.
Pease speaks of the paradox between curi
osity and commitment. "A great university,"
he says "may choose to do many things, but
the one thing it must do is to generate curios
ity and a sense of commitment among its stu
dents and teachers. And therein lies a para
dox."
"Curiosity is nothing less than the endless
desire to find truth about something; com
mitment involves the desire to act on what
one believes to be truth."
"It is the task of great teaching to create
an environment in which a person may learn
for himself to resolve this paradox, to learn
how he may fuse curiosity and commitment, so
that each, in reinforcing the other, may to
gether give life to his mind where singly they
would destroy it."
Brown emphasizes that "study and direct
concern cannot properly be separated from
one another."
"The notion that student revolt—whether
over Vietnam or social regulations or racial
injustice—is 'interfering with education' is a
notion incompatible with the recognition that
in the life of the truly educated person,
thought and action are indivisible."
"There is involved here a kind of amalgam
of vision, unrest, dissatisfaction, and a desire
to do something about it all. The task of the
university is not to keep a student separated
from the world, but to involve him more re
sponsibly in it."
For many students, the process has been
reversed: they have found through participa
tion in other social institutions that students
can play an active role in bringing change.
This belief, in turn, has been brought back
to the university, where many of these stu
dents find it increasingly unbearable to be
treated like passive containers into which in
formation is to be poured," says Joseph Katz
of the Institute for the Study of Human Prob
lems.
Katz thinks that the change in student con
sciousness is so drastic as to be "a possible
turning point in educational history.. Similar
to the people of the Renaissance and the
French revolution, students today have a new
consciousness: they feel differently about
themselves and about the world."
Gone is the passive acceptance of the exist
ing society and the individual's role in it. "Stu
dents now feel that they can do something
about their situation. Further, if things are
not as they should be, they feel that it is not
all their fault and that part rests in the social
sructure."
A third thrust of student pressure has been
to integrate the student's status outside the
classroom to his status inside. Much of he con
troversy summed up as "the revolt against
rules and regulations" has been based on the
contention that the student is treated differ
ently in his social life than he is in his aca
demic endeavors.
"There is a certain incongurity in demand
ing a critical attitude in class and assuming
that people can not regulate their own lives,"
one student leader states. "Such hypocrisy
ignores or blurs the facts." And again, lead
ership in the university is questioned.
"Because of this abdication, this refusal by
the administration to face problems," the same
student adds, "the task has fallen to the stu
dents."
All he three previously mentioned "integra
tions" have been mere preliminaries to the
final integration: incorporation of students
into the scholarly community.
Two years ago, in his concluding address
as ASSU President, Bud Wedin stated: "We

have taken a great deal of tolerance and un
derstanding from this community and replaced
it with skill and efficiency. Too often we have
regarded the individual as an object and have
seen him only in relation to rules or regula
tions."
"In short, we seem to have lost the vision of
a democratic university in which all share cer
tain rights of participation in matters of com
mon concern, and of freedom of inquiry, as
sociation, and development, and where pa
ternalism is replaced by fellowship in the
company of scholars."
"Perhaps it is time to review some of the
institutions of our society at Stanford to see
if we are really doing our utmost to produce
students with the intellectual maturity, the
self-assurance, and the sense of dignity and
independence so needed in today's society."
The following fall, a group of students and
faculty members formed the Stanford Associa
tion of University Scholars. The purpose of
the group, according to its founder Bob Rosen,
was "to break false dichotomies. Usually the
students and faculty are thought of in opposi
tion to the 'University.' We think that studens
and faculty, because they are the practicing
scholars, are the University. The administra
tion exists to work for the University, to fa
cilitate the pursuit of knowledge."
SAUS faded away, partially out of an inabil
ity to define itself and partially because the
energy of the participants was directed to
other activities. The participants in SAUS,
Rosen explains, were also involved in larger
political movements as well.
The fact that no new SAUS has arisen is
no sign that students are no longer interested
in education. Quite the contrary, Rosen mam
tains: participation in things such as the ASSU
Education Commission is far more broadly
based than concern over educational reform
ever has been.
"There is now a sincere interest in educa
tional reform," Rosen states, "and an orienta
tion toward acting on ideas. Groups will re
emerge on a formal basis with a fuller, strong
er consensus than SAUS ever had."
Just an opinion about rules and regulations
became part of the popular consciousness at
Stanford in the years following the original
questioning of the system, so now educational
reform has now been accepted.
Expect Change
"Whereas two years ago, no one thought
change possible," another says, "we now ex
pect change because we have had change. In
the election of Harris, it was shown for the
first time that on really important issues, stu
dents are willing to act. The administration
has to make sense now."
And here is no doubt that the administration
is trying harder. As one fringe member puts
it,"The administration pays more attention to
students than it likes to admit. And it is slow
to credit them."
But the reciprocal criticism also applies;
students are reluctant to give recognition to

the administration. The big problem in stu
dent-administration relations two years ago
was communication. The emphasis has shifted
somewhat now as each group recognizes that
where it had before assumed differences of
opinion, it can see now because the lines of
communication have been opened that the dif
ferences are real.
The basic problem seems to be one of trust.
If students felt they were a part of a joint
educational endeavor, in which the main cri
teria for decision-making, was as one observer
states "the engagement of the intellect over
a subject as one aspect of the educational
process," an entirely different atmosphere
would prevail.
By the combination of real participation
and openness which would require redress and
public accountability, the atmosphere of sus
picion could be replaced with one in which
all were moving in the same directions.
What students are calling for is a substan
tial say in determining their own education.
They recall that the term "authority" implies
the consent of the governed; otherwise gov
erning is merely the exercise of power.
Few models have been worked out in detail,
but one theme seems to reappear in almost all
discussions: the theme of community. If agree
ment can be reached on the principles of com
munity, any structure would come from the
consensus almost naturally.
The characteristics students have posited
for the community center around the concep
tion of a core of shared values, which would
include above all openness and freedom from
bias.
This attitude must first be employed, some
students feel, in self-analysis. Without funda
mental questioning of the assumptions upon
which the current structure of the University
is based, not even a beginning can be made
toward achieving community.
And before community is achieved, other
attitudes must change. Community involves
1) having an identification with the Univer
sity over and above loyalty to discipline or
constituency and 2) seeing people as individu
als rather than as representatives of consti
tuencies.
These traits seems to be lacking at Stanford
today and the insulting "power bloc" relation
ships make change appear the result of a vic
tory of one bloc over another rather than a
communal achievement.
As long as students are thought of as stu
dents rather than as more intellects being
"engaged over a subject," power blocs and
their consequent tactics will prevail. When stu
dents feel the frustration of their ideas being
ignored simply because of their status, they
often conclude that "Brinksmanship" is the
only way to push Stanford over the edge of
greatness.

Hopefully, the set of relations now pri
ing will be transcended, but one suspects
the structure and its occupants have bee
so identified with each other that m
change is impossible during the current
eration of either students or administrators.
Part of the gap between students and the
administration, which seems too much to
bridge: is the difference in values. In the case
of the current crop of students, the difference
seems to be more than is accountable by any
merely generational gap.
This generation tends to put the emphasis
on operations rather than content as the way
to authenticating a moral system.
"We are more open-minded and less dog
matic," one student explains. "We have a rela
tivistic conception of moral values and believe
that allowing people to develop themselves,
rather than imposing on them a system of
values, is the way to bring a happy society."
But the era of student-administration rela
tions may have come to an end, or at least a
lessening in intensity, for the recent ASSU
campaign was run on educational reform,
which will necessitate more dealing with the
faculty.
Opinion varies as to whether curricular
change will come more easily or with greater
difficulty than have the changes over rules
and regulations.
One administrator feels that "the difficult
changes are the visible ones. Those are now
past. Educational reform can be approached
on honest intellectual grounds, which was not
possible when the battles were being fought
in the public press."
On the other hand, curricular criticism can
often be interpreted as an attack on the pro
fessional autonomy of the professor. And even
more desperately, some students feel that the
refusal to be self-critical applies to the faculty
as well as the administration.
Faculty Paternalism
The administrative mentality causing a com
modity view of education in the administra
tion has pervaded the faculty as well. Pa
ternalism here is reflected in an attitude of
dispensing knowledge to a passive receptacle.
And just as with paternalism in the admin
istration, paternalism in the faculty is hard to
puncture. Some students have found a real
unwillingness on the part of some faculty
members to be honestly evaluative of their
own achievements or to confront students as
authorities in their own right.
A third body of opinion on curricular reform
holds that the administration, not the faculty,
is the key to reform because its conception of
education is the prevailing one.
This group feels that questions about foun
dations must be asked of a structure which
emphasizes passive receptivity. Regurgitation
of knowledge as a basis of determining level
of education seems to some students to reflect
Stanford's overbalance on the side of accomo
dating society.
Dave Harris based his campaign upon dis
satisfaction with the existing structure and he
analyzes his election as "an expression of stu
dent discontent, a broad emotional statement
of dissatisfaction with the type of education
given here and the student's role in it."
Education at Stanford, he says, is viewed as
"indoctrination, not participation. The student
is treated as a second-class citizen in the com
munity; his life is fragmented."
He would like to see students participating
in an "integrative four-year experience rather
than in a training period."
His preliminary plans for next year include
activities on two fronts. First, the fifty or so
people who recently signed up to work in his
organization will devote must of their efforts
to research in the fields of education, decision
making, student rights, and housing.
Second, under the heading of special Presi
dential programs, Harris is planning to back
an experimental college "to build in the mi
crocosm what we want in the macrocosm,"
and hopes to sponsor a national conference on
education.
The recent analysis by Katz and Nevitt San
ford of student activism nationally (Saturday
Review, December) has remarkable applica
tion to the situation at Stanford. They say that
the "demand for participation does not stem
from any desire to make college life easier.
Rather it springs from a profound attempt to
seek answers as to how one might achieve
such ends as a reliable personal identity, com
munity with other people, and social objectives
that will bring comfort and justice to those
largely bereft of them in our society."
Level Of Investigation
Their research shows that "the socially in
volved students total not more than 15 per
cent, but the movement can no longer be con
trolled by dealing with the minority alone, be
cause it is expressing the frustrations and as
pirations now shared by the majority of stu
dents."
The current situation represents a unique
opportunity to college administations, they
say. "Administrators who can find some way
to respond to what is human, though some
times chaotically expressed, in these under
graduate students, will find that they are go
ing to be part of a truly revolutionary phase
in the history of education."
"While the eighteenth century discovered
that good government depends upon the con
sent of the governed, our generation has the
opportunity of discovering and bringing to
fruition a system of education that is based
upon the consent of the educated."
On purely pragmatic grounds, encourage
ment of student participation in educational
reform is desirable, because, as one student
commented last spring in reaction to a speech
by President Sterling: "The 'Stanford student
movement'—if indeed, a movement exists as
such—does not represent a rebellious asser
tion of 'student autonomy' but, rather, a con
sidered and concerncd effort to help create a
better, more challenging university for those
students who follow."
There have been several signs since that
time that President Sterling shares much the
same opinion. At a recent alumni conference,
he commented that one strain of student pro
test shows "a genuine interest in the construc
tive task of improving education."
Recognition of the sincerity and construc
tive purpose of many student activists is cer
tainly welcome, but "what they desire most is
the appearance of forceful and self-critical
leadership dedicated to educational reform.
When that leadership becomes visible, stu
dents will at last be able to say that the proc
ess of bringing up father has been completed.


"Klein proposes embellishments on the cur
rent structure; I reject the asumptions on
which the current structure is based."
These words of ASSU President-elect Dave
Harris, spoken during a campaign debate
against Bob Klein, symbolize several years
of student activism at Stanford and serve as
a harbinger of the new direction in which
student activism has begun to turn.
Historically, student concern at Stanford has
been expressed in two broad areas. The first
is a rebellion against the existing conception
of the role of the student. Much of the work
of the past half decade has been to remove
the image of the student as a passive recep
tacle to be treated rather arbitrarily and pa
ternalistically.
But running beneath the surface demands
for respect and participation has been a steady
current asking questions of a much broader
nature, such as what is a university and what
is its relation to society. These questions have
either not been answered or have not been
answered satisfactorily.
It is this dilemma of looking for leadership,
not finding it, and consequently vesting au
thority in themselves that has caused the sec
ond thrust of student activists. If the adminis
ration is incapable or unwilling to articulate
a philosophy of education, some students have
said, we will begin the dialogue alone.
Both strands of the protest—that ag3 ?r,t! t
an anachronistic and degrading set of rules
and the call for discussion of broader educa
tional issues—was summarized two years ago
by one student observer:
"In the minds of many student leaders, arbi
trariness is at once a direct function of an un
necessarily paternal attitude on the part of
the administration and a denial of the essen
tial academic nature of the University."
"Students fear a vacuum—the lack of a co
herent philosophy of education at the top of
the administrative structure. They ask the
question, "Where is the leadership?" and are
forced to conclude it is nowhere if not in them
selves."
Bringing Up Father
Given the essentially paternalistic attitude
of the administration and the students' self
imposed tasi of educating the administration
on what thej feel to be some basic educational
concepts, th history of Stanford in recent
years might be titled "Bringing Up Father."
The significance of the Harris election, com
ing at the same time that most of the battles
over rules and regulations have been won, is
that student energy, and in turn administration
energy, will at last be concentrated on the sec
ond of the two areas of thrust: the attempt to
define and to work toward a new conception of
education.
But before students could begin asking
questions about the nature of their education,
they had to achieve a status in which they
were listened to. Much of the effort of the last
five years has been to gain this position. It
has been manifested as rebellion against the
role assigned to students by the administra
tion.
Basically, what the students have rebelled
against is being treated as immature and
being treated as things. Both flow from an
administrative mentality which student lead
ers think is essentially paternalistic and fre
quently arbitrary.
Paternalism is characterized by over-pro
tectiveness. It is the attitude that "we know
your best interest." Paternalism should at
least be personal, critics say, but it is not
when it is combined with the administrative
mentality which, in the words of one faculty
member "puts a premium on efficiency, and
peace and quiet."
"The person is taken out for the common
good, expediting the educational process,"
another professor points out. This has two
unfortunate consequences. First, something
has gone terribly wrong when people and their
development, those things which should be the
central concern of education, are ignored. But
more importantly, the system is self-perpetu
ating. If one assumes that the system he op
erates functions well and he dismisses critic
ism as being uninformed or as coming from
people too young to understand, the system
is impregnable.
It is for this reason that students have been
turned a deaf ear when they have raised the
broader issues, such as the nature of the uni
versity's relation to society. And, unfortun
ately, these types of questions have arisen as
natural consequences of questioning the sys
tem of dealing with students.
For example, the administrative mentality
that students have criticized" is a sytom of
what some critics term commodity education.
"There is a cultural assumption in Ameri
ca," one observer points out, "that institu
tions of society produce commodities." The
university is an institution and what it pro
duces are trained minds, components for the
assembly line of society.
Dual Responsibility
The broad issue which Stanford has not
faced, critics say, is to bring into balance the
university's dual set of relations to society.
As transmitter of the cultural heritage, the
university is in an accommodating role to soci
ety. It has the responsibility of preparing the
new generation to take control of the institu
tions of society.
But secondly, the university is critic of the
culture being transmitted. In this second role,
it conflicts with society.
The more articulate students feel that Stan
ford has become overbalanced on the side of
accomodation to society. As former ASSU
President Bud Wedin wrote in a recent article
on education at Stanford: "unlike Faustus
who sold his soul to the devil for more honor
able reasons, Stanford has aligned itself with
the biases and norms of the technological
society for want of any soul at all."
Another unfortunate result of the adminis
tration's refusal to listen to students is that
they feel compelled out of frustration to use
forceful tactics.
"They don't understand that what we say
has merit," one student leader states. "And on
the other hand, we don't understand them
because they don't explain their actions to
us." When the gap between students and ad
ministration is as large as it apparently is,
another states, "the situation suggests per
haps some inadequacy to mere discussion."
The administration has learned to listen
over the last half decade to what students
are saying and thus drastic tactics have not
been used. Explanations of this phenomenon

vary, however. The pessimists maintain that
"a lot of the change hasn't been basic attitud
inal change. It was merely strategic change
due to pressure.
The administration has played a holding
game, one adherent of this position main
tains, in the hope that "the activist minority
would graduate and this would all be over."
The significance of the Harris election, this
observer says, is to prove that pressure for
change "is not a temporary aberration caused
by a scapegoat figure."
The other side maintains that there has
been a very definite maturing process on the
part of the administration. One member of
the administration maintains, "we are no
longer over-reacting; we have more confi
dence and a better time perspective."
A slightly cynical student adds: "They know
they just can't do certain things now that
they could a few years ago. The old ploy of
divide and conquer won't work; if a minority

is being isolated and treated unjustly, a sub
stantial segment of the community will rise
in their defense."
In response to continued student demands
for change, some of the most sensitive admin
istrators (there are at least three or four
people over thirty in the administration who
can be trusted) have suggested tactics which
they feel would be the most effective for
students.
The list of one, Associate Undergraauate
Dean Robert Hind, reads as follows: • arm
yourself with facts; • go to the appropriate
person; • be open-minded; • concentrate on
academic improvement rather than peripheral
matters.
Associate Dean of Students Joel Smith sug
gests that "students are paid more attention
on pragmatic questions where they have rele
vant information. Their effect is limited when
they talk about the structure of the univers
ity."
But what Stanford has lacked, the articulate
students feel, is analysis of the structure.
"Without a discussion and an articulation of a
broad concept of education." One retired stu
dent leader states, "Stanford can only have
accretions to the current structure." And the
current structure he and many others regard
as inadequate.
The underlying criticism is a challenge of
the existing conception of authority.
The problem arises from a confusion be
tween education and administration. The uni
versity is an institution of society and thus
has a governing body. But the authority vested
ih it is only for administrative matters.
"The administration and the trustees tend
to think of education as one facet of adminis
tration, rather than vice versa as it should
be," one observer feels.
Another laments that "authority no longer
relates to education." Final authority in the
universiy, this student feels, should be
"truth,"and all other authority gains its
legitimacy in relation to this primary author
ity.
Dialogue Impossible
Fundamental to the search for truth is
"the courage to attack your convictions." At
least some Stanford students have found this
trait lacking in both the administration and the
faculty. This discovery has had at least two
unfortunate results.
First, some students have by default come
to vest authority in their peers because they
feel the faculty and administration have abdi
cated their responsibility to be self-critical.
This results in education being less challeng
ing than it could be if, these students feel,
they could respect the faculty as searching
minds as well as dispensers of knowledge.
But more broadly, a dialogue about the cur
rent structure of the university is not even
possible because of the attitude of the adminis
tration. "Real disagreement is now impos
sible," one student states. "The joint inquiry
we desire requires questioning assumptions.
The administration is as yet unwilling to do
this."
"Something must be done to challenge their
parochial conception of authority. They won't
recognize student authority or any higher
authority. Stanford has neither the courage
nor the capability to question itself funda
mentally because of its parochialism."
Concomitant to the efforts at bringing up
Father has been the effort to "Bring Leland
off the Farm." The last decade has been the
emergence of Stanford from a rather paroch
ial Western institution to a university of na
tional reputation.
The result of the very deliberate efforts to
upgrade the faculty by bringing to Stanford
people from outside has been to make the be
ginnings, at least, of a process of self-criticism.
In the student body, this process was begun
by people like Allard Lowenstein, who was
for a year director of Stem Hall and taught
in the Political Science department.
"A 1 brought wide experience to a parochial
campus," one former administrator states. "He
came to Stanford at a time when there was a
feeling that major changes were needed. He
gave students confidence that change was
worthwhile and that students could make the
difference in bringing change where it had
before appeared impossible."
For several years, many students feel, the
administration used Lowenstein and the stu
dents he met during his year here as the ex
planation of student activism. The name
"Lowenstein" is not heard often anymore at
Stanford and yet students seem more dedi
cated than ever before to pressing for changes.
Much of the thrust of Lowenstein and stu
dents he inspired was to convince students
that they did have a right to be heard and a
right to be treated as adults. In a sense, these
feelings triggered the rebellion against the

old conception of the role of the student, a
rebellion which took form in the demand for
respect.
But this first rebellion was merely the
establishment of the base on which the real
discussion of education could begin. Now that
student leaders have largely completed the
attack on the facade of the current structure,
they are moving towards positing their own
conception of education. This second of the
two thrusts of student activism is summarized
by the term "integration."
First, students demand that their scholarly
and their social criticism be integrated. Many
students find it hypocritical on the part of the
administration to demand of students a critical
attitude and an openness of mind in the class
room but not to expect the same techniques
and commitments to apply outside the class.
"It seems strange," says one close ob
server of the administration, "that we excite
students about social institutions and then
tell them to keep the valve shut until they
leave."
The basic problem, as analyzed by several
of the most astute student critics, is one of
leadership. Ilene Strelitz, Daily editor, wrote
two years ago, in an editorial titled "Where is
Leadership in the University?":
"The criticism levelled at the student is
consistently in the direction of inaction; don't
step beyond the classroom, don't speak out,
and above all don't hold the lectures in the
classroom and the words in the text as rele
vant to the broad issues of controversy facing
your generation.
Students Make Demands
"This is an odd reversal of roles.
"The student should be criticized. The Presi
dent . . . should demand more confrontation
by the student of the responsibility of the edu
cated to the society. His words should be a
constant barrage of criticism for unawareness,
ignorance of 'the world outside', lack of appli
cation of talents, the need for the university
to be the fearless critic and ethical leader.
'It is the role of leadership to criticize and
to demand action, to pose the questions, not to
prohibit them. The students wait for a leader
to raise up before them.
"... The greatest sadness of all will come
if nothing is done, for the President, the deans,
etc. are leaders, no matter how they construe
that role. And it will be sad if the students are
led into passive and uncaring commitments to
stagnation."
There are strong indications that at least
a significant minority are not heading toward
stagnation, but it seems that many are doing
so in spite of, rather than because of any atti
tudes or policies of the administration. And,
in the strangest irony of all, it is the students
who have been demanding that the university
examine its responsibility to society, that the
university be the "formulator not the reflector
of cultural values," that the university define
itself.
But integration of scholarly and social critic
ism is only one of several types of integration
students have called for. The second type is
the integration of thought and action. Here,
students find inspiration in the words of Pro
fessors Otis Pease and Robert McAfee Brown.
Pease speaks of the paradox between curi
osity and commitment. "A great university,"
he says "may choose to do many things, but
the one thing it must do is to generate curios
ity and a sense of commitment among its stu
dents and teachers. And therein lies a para
dox."
"Curiosity is nothing less than the endless
desire to find truth about something; com
mitment involves the desire to act on what
one believes to be truth."
"It is the task of great teaching to create
an environment in which a person may learn
for himself to resolve this paradox, to learn
how he may fuse curiosity and commitment, so
that each, in reinforcing the other, may to
gether give life to his mind where singly they
would destroy it."
Brown emphasizes that "study and direct
concern cannot properly be separated from
one another."
"The notion that student revolt—whether
over Vietnam or social regulations or racial
injustice—is 'interfering with education' is a
notion incompatible with the recognition that
in the life of the truly educated person,
thought and action are indivisible."
"There is involved here a kind of amalgam
of vision, unrest, dissatisfaction, and a desire
to do something about it all. The task of the
university is not to keep a student separated
from the world, but to involve him more re
sponsibly in it."
For many students, the process has been
reversed: they have found through participa
tion in other social institutions that students
can play an active role in bringing change.
This belief, in turn, has been brought back
to the university, where many of these stu
dents find it increasingly unbearable to be
treated like passive containers into which in
formation is to be poured," says Joseph Katz
of the Institute for the Study of Human Prob
lems.
Katz thinks that the change in student con
sciousness is so drastic as to be "a possible
turning point in educational history.. Similar
to the people of the Renaissance and the
French revolution, students today have a new
consciousness: they feel differently about
themselves and about the world."
Gone is the passive acceptance of the exist
ing society and the individual's role in it. "Stu
dents now feel that they can do something
about their situation. Further, if things are
not as they should be, they feel that it is not
all their fault and that part rests in the social
sructure."
A third thrust of student pressure has been
to integrate the student's status outside the
classroom to his status inside. Much of he con
troversy summed up as "the revolt against
rules and regulations" has been based on the
contention that the student is treated differ
ently in his social life than he is in his aca
demic endeavors.
"There is a certain incongurity in demand
ing a critical attitude in class and assuming
that people can not regulate their own lives,"
one student leader states. "Such hypocrisy
ignores or blurs the facts." And again, lead
ership in the university is questioned.
"Because of this abdication, this refusal by
the administration to face problems," the same
student adds, "the task has fallen to the stu
dents."
All he three previously mentioned "integra
tions" have been mere preliminaries to the
final integration: incorporation of students
into the scholarly community.
Two years ago, in his concluding address
as ASSU President, Bud Wedin stated: "We

have taken a great deal of tolerance and un
derstanding from this community and replaced
it with skill and efficiency. Too often we have
regarded the individual as an object and have
seen him only in relation to rules or regula
tions."
"In short, we seem to have lost the vision of
a democratic university in which all share cer
tain rights of participation in matters of com
mon concern, and of freedom of inquiry, as
sociation, and development, and where pa
ternalism is replaced by fellowship in the
company of scholars."
"Perhaps it is time to review some of the
institutions of our society at Stanford to see
if we are really doing our utmost to produce
students with the intellectual maturity, the
self-assurance, and the sense of dignity and
independence so needed in today's society."
The following fall, a group of students and
faculty members formed the Stanford Associa
tion of University Scholars. The purpose of
the group, according to its founder Bob Rosen,
was "to break false dichotomies. Usually the
students and faculty are thought of in opposi
tion to the 'University.' We think that studens
and faculty, because they are the practicing
scholars, are the University. The administra
tion exists to work for the University, to fa
cilitate the pursuit of knowledge."
SAUS faded away, partially out of an inabil
ity to define itself and partially because the
energy of the participants was directed to
other activities. The participants in SAUS,
Rosen explains, were also involved in larger
political movements as well.
The fact that no new SAUS has arisen is
no sign that students are no longer interested
in education. Quite the contrary, Rosen mam
tains: participation in things such as the ASSU
Education Commission is far more broadly
based than concern over educational reform
ever has been.
"There is now a sincere interest in educa
tional reform," Rosen states, "and an orienta
tion toward acting on ideas. Groups will re
emerge on a formal basis with a fuller, strong
er consensus than SAUS ever had."
Just an opinion about rules and regulations
became part of the popular consciousness at
Stanford in the years following the original
questioning of the system, so now educational
reform has now been accepted.
Expect Change
"Whereas two years ago, no one thought
change possible," another says, "we now ex
pect change because we have had change. In
the election of Harris, it was shown for the
first time that on really important issues, stu
dents are willing to act. The administration
has to make sense now."
And here is no doubt that the administration
is trying harder. As one fringe member puts
it,"The administration pays more attention to
students than it likes to admit. And it is slow
to credit them."
But the reciprocal criticism also applies;
students are reluctant to give recognition to

the administration. The big problem in stu
dent-administration relations two years ago
was communication. The emphasis has shifted
somewhat now as each group recognizes that
where it had before assumed differences of
opinion, it can see now because the lines of
communication have been opened that the dif
ferences are real.
The basic problem seems to be one of trust.
If students felt they were a part of a joint
educational endeavor, in which the main cri
teria for decision-making, was as one observer
states "the engagement of the intellect over
a subject as one aspect of the educational
process," an entirely different atmosphere
would prevail.
By the combination of real participation
and openness which would require redress and
public accountability, the atmosphere of sus
picion could be replaced with one in which
all were moving in the same directions.
What students are calling for is a substan
tial say in determining their own education.
They recall that the term "authority" implies
the consent of the governed; otherwise gov
erning is merely the exercise of power.
Few models have been worked out in detail,
but one theme seems to reappear in almost all
discussions: the theme of community. If agree
ment can be reached on the principles of com
munity, any structure would come from the
consensus almost naturally.
The characteristics students have posited
for the community center around the concep
tion of a core of shared values, which would
include above all openness and freedom from
bias.
This attitude must first be employed, some
students feel, in self-analysis. Without funda
mental questioning of the assumptions upon
which the current structure of the University
is based, not even a beginning can be made
toward achieving community.
And before community is achieved, other
attitudes must change. Community involves
1) having an identification with the Univer
sity over and above loyalty to discipline or
constituency and 2) seeing people as individu
als rather than as representatives of consti
tuencies.
These traits seems to be lacking at Stanford
today and the insulting "power bloc" relation
ships make change appear the result of a vic
tory of one bloc over another rather than a
communal achievement.
As long as students are thought of as stu
dents rather than as more intellects being
"engaged over a subject," power blocs and
their consequent tactics will prevail. When stu
dents feel the frustration of their ideas being
ignored simply because of their status, they
often conclude that "Brinksmanship" is the
only way to push Stanford over the edge of
greatness.

Hopefully, the set of relations now pri
ing will be transcended, but one suspects
the structure and its occupants have bee
so identified with each other that m
change is impossible during the current
eration of either students or administrators.
Part of the gap between students and the
administration, which seems too much to
bridge: is the difference in values. In the case
of the current crop of students, the difference
seems to be more than is accountable by any
merely generational gap.
This generation tends to put the emphasis
on operations rather than content as the way
to authenticating a moral system.
"We are more open-minded and less dog
matic," one student explains. "We have a rela
tivistic conception of moral values and believe
that allowing people to develop themselves,
rather than imposing on them a system of
values, is the way to bring a happy society."
But the era of student-administration rela
tions may have come to an end, or at least a
lessening in intensity, for the recent ASSU
campaign was run on educational reform,
which will necessitate more dealing with the
faculty.
Opinion varies as to whether curricular
change will come more easily or with greater
difficulty than have the changes over rules
and regulations.
One administrator feels that "the difficult
changes are the visible ones. Those are now
past. Educational reform can be approached
on honest intellectual grounds, which was not
possible when the battles were being fought
in the public press."
On the other hand, curricular criticism can
often be interpreted as an attack on the pro
fessional autonomy of the professor. And even
more desperately, some students feel that the
refusal to be self-critical applies to the faculty
as well as the administration.
Faculty Paternalism
The administrative mentality causing a com
modity view of education in the administra
tion has pervaded the faculty as well. Pa
ternalism here is reflected in an attitude of
dispensing knowledge to a passive receptacle.
And just as with paternalism in the admin
istration, paternalism in the faculty is hard to
puncture. Some students have found a real
unwillingness on the part of some faculty
members to be honestly evaluative of their
own achievements or to confront students as
authorities in their own right.
A third body of opinion on curricular reform
holds that the administration, not the faculty,
is the key to reform because its conception of
education is the prevailing one.
This group feels that questions about foun
dations must be asked of a structure which
emphasizes passive receptivity. Regurgitation
of knowledge as a basis of determining level
of education seems to some students to reflect
Stanford's overbalance on the side of accomo
dating society.
Dave Harris based his campaign upon dis
satisfaction with the existing structure and he
analyzes his election as "an expression of stu
dent discontent, a broad emotional statement
of dissatisfaction with the type of education
given here and the student's role in it."
Education at Stanford, he says, is viewed as
"indoctrination, not participation. The student
is treated as a second-class citizen in the com
munity; his life is fragmented."
He would like to see students participating
in an "integrative four-year experience rather
than in a training period."
His preliminary plans for next year include
activities on two fronts. First, the fifty or so
people who recently signed up to work in his
organization will devote must of their efforts
to research in the fields of education, decision
making, student rights, and housing.
Second, under the heading of special Presi
dential programs, Harris is planning to back
an experimental college "to build in the mi
crocosm what we want in the macrocosm,"
and hopes to sponsor a national conference on
education.
The recent analysis by Katz and Nevitt San
ford of student activism nationally (Saturday
Review, December) has remarkable applica
tion to the situation at Stanford. They say that
the "demand for participation does not stem
from any desire to make college life easier.
Rather it springs from a profound attempt to
seek answers as to how one might achieve
such ends as a reliable personal identity, com
munity with other people, and social objectives
that will bring comfort and justice to those
largely bereft of them in our society."
Level Of Investigation
Their research shows that "the socially in
volved students total not more than 15 per
cent, but the movement can no longer be con
trolled by dealing with the minority alone, be
cause it is expressing the frustrations and as
pirations now shared by the majority of stu
dents."
The current situation represents a unique
opportunity to college administations, they
say. "Administrators who can find some way
to respond to what is human, though some
times chaotically expressed, in these under
graduate students, will find that they are go
ing to be part of a truly revolutionary phase
in the history of education."
"While the eighteenth century discovered
that good government depends upon the con
sent of the governed, our generation has the
opportunity of discovering and bringing to
fruition a system of education that is based
upon the consent of the educated."
On purely pragmatic grounds, encourage
ment of student participation in educational
reform is desirable, because, as one student
commented last spring in reaction to a speech
by President Sterling: "The 'Stanford student
movement'—if indeed, a movement exists as
such—does not represent a rebellious asser
tion of 'student autonomy' but, rather, a con
sidered and concerncd effort to help create a
better, more challenging university for those
students who follow."
There have been several signs since that
time that President Sterling shares much the
same opinion. At a recent alumni conference,
he commented that one strain of student pro
test shows "a genuine interest in the construc
tive task of improving education."
Recognition of the sincerity and construc
tive purpose of many student activists is cer
tainly welcome, but "what they desire most is
the appearance of forceful and self-critical
leadership dedicated to educational reform.
When that leadership becomes visible, stu
dents will at last be able to say that the proc
ess of bringing up father has been completed.


"Klein proposes embellishments on the cur
rent structure; I reject the asumptions on
which the current structure is based."
These words of ASSU President-elect Dave
Harris, spoken during a campaign debate
against Bob Klein, symbolize several years
of student activism at Stanford and serve as
a harbinger of the new direction in which
student activism has begun to turn.
Historically, student concern at Stanford has
been expressed in two broad areas. The first
is a rebellion against the existing conception
of the role of the student. Much of the work
of the past half decade has been to remove
the image of the student as a passive recep
tacle to be treated rather arbitrarily and pa
ternalistically.
But running beneath the surface demands
for respect and participation has been a steady
current asking questions of a much broader
nature, such as what is a university and what
is its relation to society. These questions have
either not been answered or have not been
answered satisfactorily.
It is this dilemma of looking for leadership,
not finding it, and consequently vesting au
thority in themselves that has caused the sec
ond thrust of student activists. If the adminis
ration is incapable or unwilling to articulate
a philosophy of education, some students have
said, we will begin the dialogue alone.
Both strands of the protest—that ag3 ?r,t! t
an anachronistic and degrading set of rules
and the call for discussion of broader educa
tional issues—was summarized two years ago
by one student observer:
"In the minds of many student leaders, arbi
trariness is at once a direct function of an un
necessarily paternal attitude on the part of
the administration and a denial of the essen
tial academic nature of the University."
"Students fear a vacuum—the lack of a co
herent philosophy of education at the top of
the administrative structure. They ask the
question, "Where is the leadership?" and are
forced to conclude it is nowhere if not in them
selves."
Bringing Up Father
Given the essentially paternalistic attitude
of the administration and the students' self
imposed tasi of educating the administration
on what thej feel to be some basic educational
concepts, th history of Stanford in recent
years might be titled "Bringing Up Father."
The significance of the Harris election, com
ing at the same time that most of the battles
over rules and regulations have been won, is
that student energy, and in turn administration
energy, will at last be concentrated on the sec
ond of the two areas of thrust: the attempt to
define and to work toward a new conception of
education.
But before students could begin asking
questions about the nature of their education,
they had to achieve a status in which they
were listened to. Much of the effort of the last
five years has been to gain this position. It
has been manifested as rebellion against the
role assigned to students by the administra
tion.
Basically, what the students have rebelled
against is being treated as immature and
being treated as things. Both flow from an
administrative mentality which student lead
ers think is essentially paternalistic and fre
quently arbitrary.
Paternalism is characterized by over-pro
tectiveness. It is the attitude that "we know
your best interest." Paternalism should at
least be personal, critics say, but it is not
when it is combined with the administrative
mentality which, in the words of one faculty
member "puts a premium on efficiency, and
peace and quiet."
"The person is taken out for the common
good, expediting the educational process,"
another professor points out. This has two
unfortunate consequences. First, something
has gone terribly wrong when people and their
development, those things which should be the
central concern of education, are ignored. But
more importantly, the system is self-perpetu
ating. If one assumes that the system he op
erates functions well and he dismisses critic
ism as being uninformed or as coming from
people too young to understand, the system
is impregnable.
It is for this reason that students have been
turned a deaf ear when they have raised the
broader issues, such as the nature of the uni
versity's relation to society. And, unfortun
ately, these types of questions have arisen as
natural consequences of questioning the sys
tem of dealing with students.
For example, the administrative mentality
that students have criticized" is a sytom of
what some critics term commodity education.
"There is a cultural assumption in Ameri
ca," one observer points out, "that institu
tions of society produce commodities." The
university is an institution and what it pro
duces are trained minds, components for the
assembly line of society.
Dual Responsibility
The broad issue which Stanford has not
faced, critics say, is to bring into balance the
university's dual set of relations to society.
As transmitter of the cultural heritage, the
university is in an accommodating role to soci
ety. It has the responsibility of preparing the
new generation to take control of the institu
tions of society.
But secondly, the university is critic of the
culture being transmitted. In this second role,
it conflicts with society.
The more articulate students feel that Stan
ford has become overbalanced on the side of
accomodation to society. As former ASSU
President Bud Wedin wrote in a recent article
on education at Stanford: "unlike Faustus
who sold his soul to the devil for more honor
able reasons, Stanford has aligned itself with
the biases and norms of the technological
society for want of any soul at all."
Another unfortunate result of the adminis
tration's refusal to listen to students is that
they feel compelled out of frustration to use
forceful tactics.
"They don't understand that what we say
has merit," one student leader states. "And on
the other hand, we don't understand them
because they don't explain their actions to
us." When the gap between students and ad
ministration is as large as it apparently is,
another states, "the situation suggests per
haps some inadequacy to mere discussion."
The administration has learned to listen
over the last half decade to what students
are saying and thus drastic tactics have not
been used. Explanations of this phenomenon

vary, however. The pessimists maintain that
"a lot of the change hasn't been basic attitud
inal change. It was merely strategic change
due to pressure.
The administration has played a holding
game, one adherent of this position main
tains, in the hope that "the activist minority
would graduate and this would all be over."
The significance of the Harris election, this
observer says, is to prove that pressure for
change "is not a temporary aberration caused
by a scapegoat figure."
The other side maintains that there has
been a very definite maturing process on the
part of the administration. One member of
the administration maintains, "we are no
longer over-reacting; we have more confi
dence and a better time perspective."
A slightly cynical student adds: "They know
they just can't do certain things now that
they could a few years ago. The old ploy of
divide and conquer won't work; if a minority

is being isolated and treated unjustly, a sub
stantial segment of the community will rise
in their defense."
In response to continued student demands
for change, some of the most sensitive admin
istrators (there are at least three or four
people over thirty in the administration who
can be trusted) have suggested tactics which
they feel would be the most effective for
students.
The list of one, Associate Undergraauate
Dean Robert Hind, reads as follows: • arm
yourself with facts; • go to the appropriate
person; • be open-minded; • concentrate on
academic improvement rather than peripheral
matters.
Associate Dean of Students Joel Smith sug
gests that "students are paid more attention
on pragmatic questions where they have rele
vant information. Their effect is limited when
they talk about the structure of the univers
ity."
But what Stanford has lacked, the articulate
students feel, is analysis of the structure.
"Without a discussion and an articulation of a
broad concept of education." One retired stu
dent leader states, "Stanford can only have
accretions to the current structure." And the
current structure he and many others regard
as inadequate.
The underlying criticism is a challenge of
the existing conception of authority.
The problem arises from a confusion be
tween education and administration. The uni
versity is an institution of society and thus
has a governing body. But the authority vested
ih it is only for administrative matters.
"The administration and the trustees tend
to think of education as one facet of adminis
tration, rather than vice versa as it should
be," one observer feels.
Another laments that "authority no longer
relates to education." Final authority in the
universiy, this student feels, should be
"truth,"and all other authority gains its
legitimacy in relation to this primary author
ity.
Dialogue Impossible
Fundamental to the search for truth is
"the courage to attack your convictions." At
least some Stanford students have found this
trait lacking in both the administration and the
faculty. This discovery has had at least two
unfortunate results.
First, some students have by default come
to vest authority in their peers because they
feel the faculty and administration have abdi
cated their responsibility to be self-critical.
This results in education being less challeng
ing than it could be if, these students feel,
they could respect the faculty as searching
minds as well as dispensers of knowledge.
But more broadly, a dialogue about the cur
rent structure of the university is not even
possible because of the attitude of the adminis
tration. "Real disagreement is now impos
sible," one student states. "The joint inquiry
we desire requires questioning assumptions.
The administration is as yet unwilling to do
this."
"Something must be done to challenge their
parochial conception of authority. They won't
recognize student authority or any higher
authority. Stanford has neither the courage
nor the capability to question itself funda
mentally because of its parochialism."
Concomitant to the efforts at bringing up
Father has been the effort to "Bring Leland
off the Farm." The last decade has been the
emergence of Stanford from a rather paroch
ial Western institution to a university of na
tional reputation.
The result of the very deliberate efforts to
upgrade the faculty by bringing to Stanford
people from outside has been to make the be
ginnings, at least, of a process of self-criticism.
In the student body, this process was begun
by people like Allard Lowenstein, who was
for a year director of Stem Hall and taught
in the Political Science department.
"A 1 brought wide experience to a parochial
campus," one former administrator states. "He
came to Stanford at a time when there was a
feeling that major changes were needed. He
gave students confidence that change was
worthwhile and that students could make the
difference in bringing change where it had
before appeared impossible."
For several years, many students feel, the
administration used Lowenstein and the stu
dents he met during his year here as the ex
planation of student activism. The name
"Lowenstein" is not heard often anymore at
Stanford and yet students seem more dedi
cated than ever before to pressing for changes.
Much of the thrust of Lowenstein and stu
dents he inspired was to convince students
that they did have a right to be heard and a
right to be treated as adults. In a sense, these
feelings triggered the rebellion against the

old conception of the role of the student, a
rebellion which took form in the demand for
respect.
But this first rebellion was merely the
establishment of the base on which the real
discussion of education could begin. Now that
student leaders have largely completed the
attack on the facade of the current structure,
they are moving towards positing their own
conception of education. This second of the
two thrusts of student activism is summarized
by the term "integration."
First, students demand that their scholarly
and their social criticism be integrated. Many
students find it hypocritical on the part of the
administration to demand of students a critical
attitude and an openness of mind in the class
room but not to expect the same techniques
and commitments to apply outside the class.
"It seems strange," says one close ob
server of the administration, "that we excite
students about social institutions and then
tell them to keep the valve shut until they
leave."
The basic problem, as analyzed by several
of the most astute student critics, is one of
leadership. Ilene Strelitz, Daily editor, wrote
two years ago, in an editorial titled "Where is
Leadership in the University?":
"The criticism levelled at the student is
consistently in the direction of inaction; don't
step beyond the classroom, don't speak out,
and above all don't hold the lectures in the
classroom and the words in the text as rele
vant to the broad issues of controversy facing
your generation.
Students Make Demands
"This is an odd reversal of roles.
"The student should be criticized. The Presi
dent . . . should demand more confrontation
by the student of the responsibility of the edu
cated to the society. His words should be a
constant barrage of criticism for unawareness,
ignorance of 'the world outside', lack of appli
cation of talents, the need for the university
to be the fearless critic and ethical leader.
'It is the role of leadership to criticize and
to demand action, to pose the questions, not to
prohibit them. The students wait for a leader
to raise up before them.
"... The greatest sadness of all will come
if nothing is done, for the President, the deans,
etc. are leaders, no matter how they construe
that role. And it will be sad if the students are
led into passive and uncaring commitments to
stagnation."
There are strong indications that at least
a significant minority are not heading toward
stagnation, but it seems that many are doing
so in spite of, rather than because of any atti
tudes or policies of the administration. And,
in the strangest irony of all, it is the students
who have been demanding that the university
examine its responsibility to society, that the
university be the "formulator not the reflector
of cultural values," that the university define
itself.
But integration of scholarly and social critic
ism is only one of several types of integration
students have called for. The second type is
the integration of thought and action. Here,
students find inspiration in the words of Pro
fessors Otis Pease and Robert McAfee Brown.
Pease speaks of the paradox between curi
osity and commitment. "A great university,"
he says "may choose to do many things, but
the one thing it must do is to generate curios
ity and a sense of commitment among its stu
dents and teachers. And therein lies a para
dox."
"Curiosity is nothing less than the endless
desire to find truth about something; com
mitment involves the desire to act on what
one believes to be truth."
"It is the task of great teaching to create
an environment in which a person may learn
for himself to resolve this paradox, to learn
how he may fuse curiosity and commitment, so
that each, in reinforcing the other, may to
gether give life to his mind where singly they
would destroy it."
Brown emphasizes that "study and direct
concern cannot properly be separated from
one another."
"The notion that student revolt—whether
over Vietnam or social regulations or racial
injustice—is 'interfering with education' is a
notion incompatible with the recognition that
in the life of the truly educated person,
thought and action are indivisible."
"There is involved here a kind of amalgam
of vision, unrest, dissatisfaction, and a desire
to do something about it all. The task of the
university is not to keep a student separated
from the world, but to involve him more re
sponsibly in it."
For many students, the process has been
reversed: they have found through participa
tion in other social institutions that students
can play an active role in bringing change.
This belief, in turn, has been brought back
to the university, where many of these stu
dents find it increasingly unbearable to be
treated like passive containers into which in
formation is to be poured," says Joseph Katz
of the Institute for the Study of Human Prob
lems.
Katz thinks that the change in student con
sciousness is so drastic as to be "a possible
turning point in educational history.. Similar
to the people of the Renaissance and the
French revolution, students today have a new
consciousness: they feel differently about
themselves and about the world."
Gone is the passive acceptance of the exist
ing society and the individual's role in it. "Stu
dents now feel that they can do something
about their situation. Further, if things are
not as they should be, they feel that it is not
all their fault and that part rests in the social
sructure."
A third thrust of student pressure has been
to integrate the student's status outside the
classroom to his status inside. Much of he con
troversy summed up as "the revolt against
rules and regulations" has been based on the
contention that the student is treated differ
ently in his social life than he is in his aca
demic endeavors.
"There is a certain incongurity in demand
ing a critical attitude in class and assuming
that people can not regulate their own lives,"
one student leader states. "Such hypocrisy
ignores or blurs the facts." And again, lead
ership in the university is questioned.
"Because of this abdication, this refusal by
the administration to face problems," the same
student adds, "the task has fallen to the stu
dents."
All he three previously mentioned "integra
tions" have been mere preliminaries to the
final integration: incorporation of students
into the scholarly community.
Two years ago, in his concluding address
as ASSU President, Bud Wedin stated: "We

have taken a great deal of tolerance and un
derstanding from this community and replaced
it with skill and efficiency. Too often we have
regarded the individual as an object and have
seen him only in relation to rules or regula
tions."
"In short, we seem to have lost the vision of
a democratic university in which all share cer
tain rights of participation in matters of com
mon concern, and of freedom of inquiry, as
sociation, and development, and where pa
ternalism is replaced by fellowship in the
company of scholars."
"Perhaps it is time to review some of the
institutions of our society at Stanford to see
if we are really doing our utmost to produce
students with the intellectual maturity, the
self-assurance, and the sense of dignity and
independence so needed in today's society."
The following fall, a group of students and
faculty members formed the Stanford Associa
tion of University Scholars. The purpose of
the group, according to its founder Bob Rosen,
was "to break false dichotomies. Usually the
students and faculty are thought of in opposi
tion to the 'University.' We think that studens
and faculty, because they are the practicing
scholars, are the University. The administra
tion exists to work for the University, to fa
cilitate the pursuit of knowledge."
SAUS faded away, partially out of an inabil
ity to define itself and partially because the
energy of the participants was directed to
other activities. The participants in SAUS,
Rosen explains, were also involved in larger
political movements as well.
The fact that no new SAUS has arisen is
no sign that students are no longer interested
in education. Quite the contrary, Rosen mam
tains: participation in things such as the ASSU
Education Commission is far more broadly
based than concern over educational reform
ever has been.
"There is now a sincere interest in educa
tional reform," Rosen states, "and an orienta
tion toward acting on ideas. Groups will re
emerge on a formal basis with a fuller, strong
er consensus than SAUS ever had."
Just an opinion about rules and regulations
became part of the popular consciousness at
Stanford in the years following the original
questioning of the system, so now educational
reform has now been accepted.
Expect Change
"Whereas two years ago, no one thought
change possible," another says, "we now ex
pect change because we have had change. In
the election of Harris, it was shown for the
first time that on really important issues, stu
dents are willing to act. The administration
has to make sense now."
And here is no doubt that the administration
is trying harder. As one fringe member puts
it,"The administration pays more attention to
students than it likes to admit. And it is slow
to credit them."
But the reciprocal criticism also applies;
students are reluctant to give recognition to

the administration. The big problem in stu
dent-administration relations two years ago
was communication. The emphasis has shifted
somewhat now as each group recognizes that
where it had before assumed differences of
opinion, it can see now because the lines of
communication have been opened that the dif
ferences are real.
The basic problem seems to be one of trust.
If students felt they were a part of a joint
educational endeavor, in which the main cri
teria for decision-making, was as one observer
states "the engagement of the intellect over
a subject as one aspect of the educational
process," an entirely different atmosphere
would prevail.
By the combination of real participation
and openness which would require redress and
public accountability, the atmosphere of sus
picion could be replaced with one in which
all were moving in the same directions.
What students are calling for is a substan
tial say in determining their own education.
They recall that the term "authority" implies
the consent of the governed; otherwise gov
erning is merely the exercise of power.
Few models have been worked out in detail,
but one theme seems to reappear in almost all
discussions: the theme of community. If agree
ment can be reached on the principles of com
munity, any structure would come from the
consensus almost naturally.
The characteristics students have posited
for the community center around the concep
tion of a core of shared values, which would
include above all openness and freedom from
bias.
This attitude must first be employed, some
students feel, in self-analysis. Without funda
mental questioning of the assumptions upon
which the current structure of the University
is based, not even a beginning can be made
toward achieving community.
And before community is achieved, other
attitudes must change. Community involves
1) having an identification with the Univer
sity over and above loyalty to discipline or
constituency and 2) seeing people as individu
als rather than as representatives of consti
tuencies.
These traits seems to be lacking at Stanford
today and the insulting "power bloc" relation
ships make change appear the result of a vic
tory of one bloc over another rather than a
communal achievement.
As long as students are thought of as stu
dents rather than as more intellects being
"engaged over a subject," power blocs and
their consequent tactics will prevail. When stu
dents feel the frustration of their ideas being
ignored simply because of their status, they
often conclude that "Brinksmanship" is the
only way to push Stanford over the edge of
greatness.

Hopefully, the set of relations now pri
ing will be transcended, but one suspects
the structure and its occupants have bee
so identified with each other that m
change is impossible during the current
eration of either students or administrators.
Part of the gap between students and the
administration, which seems too much to
bridge: is the difference in values. In the case
of the current crop of students, the difference
seems to be more than is accountable by any
merely generational gap.
This generation tends to put the emphasis
on operations rather than content as the way
to authenticating a moral system.
"We are more open-minded and less dog
matic," one student explains. "We have a rela
tivistic conception of moral values and believe
that allowing people to develop themselves,
rather than imposing on them a system of
values, is the way to bring a happy society."
But the era of student-administration rela
tions may have come to an end, or at least a
lessening in intensity, for the recent ASSU
campaign was run on educational reform,
which will necessitate more dealing with the
faculty.
Opinion varies as to whether curricular
change will come more easily or with greater
difficulty than have the changes over rules
and regulations.
One administrator feels that "the difficult
changes are the visible ones. Those are now
past. Educational reform can be approached
on honest intellectual grounds, which was not
possible when the battles were being fought
in the public press."
On the other hand, curricular criticism can
often be interpreted as an attack on the pro
fessional autonomy of the professor. And even
more desperately, some students feel that the
refusal to be self-critical applies to the faculty
as well as the administration.
Faculty Paternalism
The administrative mentality causing a com
modity view of education in the administra
tion has pervaded the faculty as well. Pa
ternalism here is reflected in an attitude of
dispensing knowledge to a passive receptacle.
And just as with paternalism in the admin
istration, paternalism in the faculty is hard to
puncture. Some students have found a real
unwillingness on the part of some faculty
members to be honestly evaluative of their
own achievements or to confront students as
authorities in their own right.
A third body of opinion on curricular reform
holds that the administration, not the faculty,
is the key to reform because its conception of
education is the prevailing one.
This group feels that questions about foun
dations must be asked of a structure which
emphasizes passive receptivity. Regurgitation
of knowledge as a basis of determining level
of education seems to some students to reflect
Stanford's overbalance on the side of accomo
dating society.
Dave Harris based his campaign upon dis
satisfaction with the existing structure and he
analyzes his election as "an expression of stu
dent discontent, a broad emotional statement
of dissatisfaction with the type of education
given here and the student's role in it."
Education at Stanford, he says, is viewed as
"indoctrination, not participation. The student
is treated as a second-class citizen in the com
munity; his life is fragmented."
He would like to see students participating
in an "integrative four-year experience rather
than in a training period."
His preliminary plans for next year include
activities on two fronts. First, the fifty or so
people who recently signed up to work in his
organization will devote must of their efforts
to research in the fields of education, decision
making, student rights, and housing.
Second, under the heading of special Presi
dential programs, Harris is planning to back
an experimental college "to build in the mi
crocosm what we want in the macrocosm,"
and hopes to sponsor a national conference on
education.
The recent analysis by Katz and Nevitt San
ford of student activism nationally (Saturday
Review, December) has remarkable applica
tion to the situation at Stanford. They say that
the "demand for participation does not stem
from any desire to make college life easier.
Rather it springs from a profound attempt to
seek answers as to how one might achieve
such ends as a reliable personal identity, com
munity with other people, and social objectives
that will bring comfort and justice to those
largely bereft of them in our society."
Level Of Investigation
Their research shows that "the socially in
volved students total not more than 15 per
cent, but the movement can no longer be con
trolled by dealing with the minority alone, be
cause it is expressing the frustrations and as
pirations now shared by the majority of stu
dents."
The current situation represents a unique
opportunity to college administations, they
say. "Administrators who can find some way
to respond to what is human, though some
times chaotically expressed, in these under
graduate students, will find that they are go
ing to be part of a truly revolutionary phase
in the history of education."
"While the eighteenth century discovered
that good government depends upon the con
sent of the governed, our generation has the
opportunity of discovering and bringing to
fruition a system of education that is based
upon the consent of the educated."
On purely pragmatic grounds, encourage
ment of student participation in educational
reform is desirable, because, as one student
commented last spring in reaction to a speech
by President Sterling: "The 'Stanford student
movement'—if indeed, a movement exists as
such—does not represent a rebellious asser
tion of 'student autonomy' but, rather, a con
sidered and concerncd effort to help create a
better, more challenging university for those
students who follow."
There have been several signs since that
time that President Sterling shares much the
same opinion. At a recent alumni conference,
he commented that one strain of student pro
test shows "a genuine interest in the construc
tive task of improving education."
Recognition of the sincerity and construc
tive purpose of many student activists is cer
tainly welcome, but "what they desire most is
the appearance of forceful and self-critical
leadership dedicated to educational reform.
When that leadership becomes visible, stu
dents will at last be able to say that the proc
ess of bringing up father has been completed.


"Klein proposes embellishments on the cur
rent structure; I reject the asumptions on
which the current structure is based."
These words of ASSU President-elect Dave
Harris, spoken during a campaign debate
against Bob Klein, symbolize several years
of student activism at Stanford and serve as
a harbinger of the new direction in which
student activism has begun to turn.
Historically, student concern at Stanford has
been expressed in two broad areas. The first
is a rebellion against the existing conception
of the role of the student. Much of the work
of the past half decade has been to remove
the image of the student as a passive recep
tacle to be treated rather arbitrarily and pa
ternalistically.
But running beneath the surface demands
for respect and participation has been a steady
current asking questions of a much broader
nature, such as what is a university and what
is its relation to society. These questions have
either not been answered or have not been
answered satisfactorily.
It is this dilemma of looking for leadership,
not finding it, and consequently vesting au
thority in themselves that has caused the sec
ond thrust of student activists. If the adminis
ration is incapable or unwilling to articulate
a philosophy of education, some students have
said, we will begin the dialogue alone.
Both strands of the protest—that ag3 ?r,t! t
an anachronistic and degrading set of rules
and the call for discussion of broader educa
tional issues—was summarized two years ago
by one student observer:
"In the minds of many student leaders, arbi
trariness is at once a direct function of an un
necessarily paternal attitude on the part of
the administration and a denial of the essen
tial academic nature of the University."
"Students fear a vacuum—the lack of a co
herent philosophy of education at the top of
the administrative structure. They ask the
question, "Where is the leadership?" and are
forced to conclude it is nowhere if not in them
selves."
Bringing Up Father
Given the essentially paternalistic attitude
of the administration and the students' self
imposed tasi of educating the administration
on what thej feel to be some basic educational
concepts, th history of Stanford in recent
years might be titled "Bringing Up Father."
The significance of the Harris election, com
ing at the same time that most of the battles
over rules and regulations have been won, is
that student energy, and in turn administration
energy, will at last be concentrated on the sec
ond of the two areas of thrust: the attempt to
define and to work toward a new conception of
education.
But before students could begin asking
questions about the nature of their education,
they had to achieve a status in which they
were listened to. Much of the effort of the last
five years has been to gain this position. It
has been manifested as rebellion against the
role assigned to students by the administra
tion.
Basically, what the students have rebelled
against is being treated as immature and
being treated as things. Both flow from an
administrative mentality which student lead
ers think is essentially paternalistic and fre
quently arbitrary.
Paternalism is characterized by over-pro
tectiveness. It is the attitude that "we know
your best interest." Paternalism should at
least be personal, critics say, but it is not
when it is combined with the administrative
mentality which, in the words of one faculty
member "puts a premium on efficiency, and
peace and quiet."
"The person is taken out for the common
good, expediting the educational process,"
another professor points out. This has two
unfortunate consequences. First, something
has gone terribly wrong when people and their
development, those things which should be the
central concern of education, are ignored. But
more importantly, the system is self-perpetu
ating. If one assumes that the system he op
erates functions well and he dismisses critic
ism as being uninformed or as coming from
people too young to understand, the system
is impregnable.
It is for this reason that students have been
turned a deaf ear when they have raised the
broader issues, such as the nature of the uni
versity's relation to society. And, unfortun
ately, these types of questions have arisen as
natural consequences of questioning the sys
tem of dealing with students.
For example, the administrative mentality
that students have criticized" is a sytom of
what some critics term commodity education.
"There is a cultural assumption in Ameri
ca," one observer points out, "that institu
tions of society produce commodities." The
university is an institution and what it pro
duces are trained minds, components for the
assembly line of society.
Dual Responsibility
The broad issue which Stanford has not
faced, critics say, is to bring into balance the
university's dual set of relations to society.
As transmitter of the cultural heritage, the
university is in an accommodating role to soci
ety. It has the responsibility of preparing the
new generation to take control of the institu
tions of society.
But secondly, the university is critic of the
culture being transmitted. In this second role,
it conflicts with society.
The more articulate students feel that Stan
ford has become overbalanced on the side of
accomodation to society. As former ASSU
President Bud Wedin wrote in a recent article
on education at Stanford: "unlike Faustus
who sold his soul to the devil for more honor
able reasons, Stanford has aligned itself with
the biases and norms of the technological
society for want of any soul at all."
Another unfortunate result of the adminis
tration's refusal to listen to students is that
they feel compelled out of frustration to use
forceful tactics.
"They don't understand that what we say
has merit," one student leader states. "And on
the other hand, we don't understand them
because they don't explain their actions to
us." When the gap between students and ad
ministration is as large as it apparently is,
another states, "the situation suggests per
haps some inadequacy to mere discussion."
The administration has learned to listen
over the last half decade to what students
are saying and thus drastic tactics have not
been used. Explanations of this phenomenon

vary, however. The pessimists maintain that
"a lot of the change hasn't been basic attitud
inal change. It was merely strategic change
due to pressure.
The administration has played a holding
game, one adherent of this position main
tains, in the hope that "the activist minority
would graduate and this would all be over."
The significance of the Harris election, this
observer says, is to prove that pressure for
change "is not a temporary aberration caused
by a scapegoat figure."
The other side maintains that there has
been a very definite maturing process on the
part of the administration. One member of
the administration maintains, "we are no
longer over-reacting; we have more confi
dence and a better time perspective."
A slightly cynical student adds: "They know
they just can't do certain things now that
they could a few years ago. The old ploy of
divide and conquer won't work; if a minority

is being isolated and treated unjustly, a sub
stantial segment of the community will rise
in their defense."
In response to continued student demands
for change, some of the most sensitive admin
istrators (there are at least three or four
people over thirty in the administration who
can be trusted) have suggested tactics which
they feel would be the most effective for
students.
The list of one, Associate Undergraauate
Dean Robert Hind, reads as follows: • arm
yourself with facts; • go to the appropriate
person; • be open-minded; • concentrate on
academic improvement rather than peripheral
matters.
Associate Dean of Students Joel Smith sug
gests that "students are paid more attention
on pragmatic questions where they have rele
vant information. Their effect is limited when
they talk about the structure of the univers
ity."
But what Stanford has lacked, the articulate
students feel, is analysis of the structure.
"Without a discussion and an articulation of a
broad concept of education." One retired stu
dent leader states, "Stanford can only have
accretions to the current structure." And the
current structure he and many others regard
as inadequate.
The underlying criticism is a challenge of
the existing conception of authority.
The problem arises from a confusion be
tween education and administration. The uni
versity is an institution of society and thus
has a governing body. But the authority vested
ih it is only for administrative matters.
"The administration and the trustees tend
to think of education as one facet of adminis
tration, rather than vice versa as it should
be," one observer feels.
Another laments that "authority no longer
relates to education." Final authority in the
universiy, this student feels, should be
"truth,"and all other authority gains its
legitimacy in relation to this primary author
ity.
Dialogue Impossible
Fundamental to the search for truth is
"the courage to attack your convictions." At
least some Stanford students have found this
trait lacking in both the administration and the
faculty. This discovery has had at least two
unfortunate results.
First, some students have by default come
to vest authority in their peers because they
feel the faculty and administration have abdi
cated their responsibility to be self-critical.
This results in education being less challeng
ing than it could be if, these students feel,
they could respect the faculty as searching
minds as well as dispensers of knowledge.
But more broadly, a dialogue about the cur
rent structure of the university is not even
possible because of the attitude of the adminis
tration. "Real disagreement is now impos
sible," one student states. "The joint inquiry
we desire requires questioning assumptions.
The administration is as yet unwilling to do
this."
"Something must be done to challenge their
parochial conception of authority. They won't
recognize student authority or any higher
authority. Stanford has neither the courage
nor the capability to question itself funda
mentally because of its parochialism."
Concomitant to the efforts at bringing up
Father has been the effort to "Bring Leland
off the Farm." The last decade has been the
emergence of Stanford from a rather paroch
ial Western institution to a university of na
tional reputation.
The result of the very deliberate efforts to
upgrade the faculty by bringing to Stanford
people from outside has been to make the be
ginnings, at least, of a process of self-criticism.
In the student body, this process was begun
by people like Allard Lowenstein, who was
for a year director of Stem Hall and taught
in the Political Science department.
"A 1 brought wide experience to a parochial
campus," one former administrator states. "He
came to Stanford at a time when there was a
feeling that major changes were needed. He
gave students confidence that change was
worthwhile and that students could make the
difference in bringing change where it had
before appeared impossible."
For several years, many students feel, the
administration used Lowenstein and the stu
dents he met during his year here as the ex
planation of student activism. The name
"Lowenstein" is not heard often anymore at
Stanford and yet students seem more dedi
cated than ever before to pressing for changes.
Much of the thrust of Lowenstein and stu
dents he inspired was to convince students
that they did have a right to be heard and a
right to be treated as adults. In a sense, these
feelings triggered the rebellion against the

old conception of the role of the student, a
rebellion which took form in the demand for
respect.
But this first rebellion was merely the
establishment of the base on which the real
discussion of education could begin. Now that
student leaders have largely completed the
attack on the facade of the current structure,
they are moving towards positing their own
conception of education. This second of the
two thrusts of student activism is summarized
by the term "integration."
First, students demand that their scholarly
and their social criticism be integrated. Many
students find it hypocritical on the part of the
administration to demand of students a critical
attitude and an openness of mind in the class
room but not to expect the same techniques
and commitments to apply outside the class.
"It seems strange," says one close ob
server of the administration, "that we excite
students about social institutions and then
tell them to keep the valve shut until they
leave."
The basic problem, as analyzed by several
of the most astute student critics, is one of
leadership. Ilene Strelitz, Daily editor, wrote
two years ago, in an editorial titled "Where is
Leadership in the University?":
"The criticism levelled at the student is
consistently in the direction of inaction; don't
step beyond the classroom, don't speak out,
and above all don't hold the lectures in the
classroom and the words in the text as rele
vant to the broad issues of controversy facing
your generation.
Students Make Demands
"This is an odd reversal of roles.
"The student should be criticized. The Presi
dent . . . should demand more confrontation
by the student of the responsibility of the edu
cated to the society. His words should be a
constant barrage of criticism for unawareness,
ignorance of 'the world outside', lack of appli
cation of talents, the need for the university
to be the fearless critic and ethical leader.
'It is the role of leadership to criticize and
to demand action, to pose the questions, not to
prohibit them. The students wait for a leader
to raise up before them.
"... The greatest sadness of all will come
if nothing is done, for the President, the deans,
etc. are leaders, no matter how they construe
that role. And it will be sad if the students are
led into passive and uncaring commitments to
stagnation."
There are strong indications that at least
a significant minority are not heading toward
stagnation, but it seems that many are doing
so in spite of, rather than because of any atti
tudes or policies of the administration. And,
in the strangest irony of all, it is the students
who have been demanding that the university
examine its responsibility to society, that the
university be the "formulator not the reflector
of cultural values," that the university define
itself.
But integration of scholarly and social critic
ism is only one of several types of integration
students have called for. The second type is
the integration of thought and action. Here,
students find inspiration in the words of Pro
fessors Otis Pease and Robert McAfee Brown.
Pease speaks of the paradox between curi
osity and commitment. "A great university,"
he says "may choose to do many things, but
the one thing it must do is to generate curios
ity and a sense of commitment among its stu
dents and teachers. And therein lies a para
dox."
"Curiosity is nothing less than the endless
desire to find truth about something; com
mitment involves the desire to act on what
one believes to be truth."
"It is the task of great teaching to create
an environment in which a person may learn
for himself to resolve this paradox, to learn
how he may fuse curiosity and commitment, so
that each, in reinforcing the other, may to
gether give life to his mind where singly they
would destroy it."
Brown emphasizes that "study and direct
concern cannot properly be separated from
one another."
"The notion that student revolt—whether
over Vietnam or social regulations or racial
injustice—is 'interfering with education' is a
notion incompatible with the recognition that
in the life of the truly educated person,
thought and action are indivisible."
"There is involved here a kind of amalgam
of vision, unrest, dissatisfaction, and a desire
to do something about it all. The task of the
university is not to keep a student separated
from the world, but to involve him more re
sponsibly in it."
For many students, the process has been
reversed: they have found through participa
tion in other social institutions that students
can play an active role in bringing change.
This belief, in turn, has been brought back
to the university, where many of these stu
dents find it increasingly unbearable to be
treated like passive containers into which in
formation is to be poured," says Joseph Katz
of the Institute for the Study of Human Prob
lems.
Katz thinks that the change in student con
sciousness is so drastic as to be "a possible
turning point in educational history.. Similar
to the people of the Renaissance and the
French revolution, students today have a new
consciousness: they feel differently about
themselves and about the world."
Gone is the passive acceptance of the exist
ing society and the individual's role in it. "Stu
dents now feel that they can do something
about their situation. Further, if things are
not as they should be, they feel that it is not
all their fault and that part rests in the social
sructure."
A third thrust of student pressure has been
to integrate the student's status outside the
classroom to his status inside. Much of he con
troversy summed up as "the revolt against
rules and regulations" has been based on the
contention that the student is treated differ
ently in his social life than he is in his aca
demic endeavors.
"There is a certain incongurity in demand
ing a critical attitude in class and assuming
that people can not regulate their own lives,"
one student leader states. "Such hypocrisy
ignores or blurs the facts." And again, lead
ership in the university is questioned.
"Because of this abdication, this refusal by
the administration to face problems," the same
student adds, "the task has fallen to the stu
dents."
All he three previously mentioned "integra
tions" have been mere preliminaries to the
final integration: incorporation of students
into the scholarly community.
Two years ago, in his concluding address
as ASSU President, Bud Wedin stated: "We

have taken a great deal of tolerance and un
derstanding from this community and replaced
it with skill and efficiency. Too often we have
regarded the individual as an object and have
seen him only in relation to rules or regula
tions."
"In short, we seem to have lost the vision of
a democratic university in which all share cer
tain rights of participation in matters of com
mon concern, and of freedom of inquiry, as
sociation, and development, and where pa
ternalism is replaced by fellowship in the
company of scholars."
"Perhaps it is time to review some of the
institutions of our society at Stanford to see
if we are really doing our utmost to produce
students with the intellectual maturity, the
self-assurance, and the sense of dignity and
independence so needed in today's society."
The following fall, a group of students and
faculty members formed the Stanford Associa
tion of University Scholars. The purpose of
the group, according to its founder Bob Rosen,
was "to break false dichotomies. Usually the
students and faculty are thought of in opposi
tion to the 'University.' We think that studens
and faculty, because they are the practicing
scholars, are the University. The administra
tion exists to work for the University, to fa
cilitate the pursuit of knowledge."
SAUS faded away, partially out of an inabil
ity to define itself and partially because the
energy of the participants was directed to
other activities. The participants in SAUS,
Rosen explains, were also involved in larger
political movements as well.
The fact that no new SAUS has arisen is
no sign that students are no longer interested
in education. Quite the contrary, Rosen mam
tains: participation in things such as the ASSU
Education Commission is far more broadly
based than concern over educational reform
ever has been.
"There is now a sincere interest in educa
tional reform," Rosen states, "and an orienta
tion toward acting on ideas. Groups will re
emerge on a formal basis with a fuller, strong
er consensus than SAUS ever had."
Just an opinion about rules and regulations
became part of the popular consciousness at
Stanford in the years following the original
questioning of the system, so now educational
reform has now been accepted.
Expect Change
"Whereas two years ago, no one thought
change possible," another says, "we now ex
pect change because we have had change. In
the election of Harris, it was shown for the
first time that on really important issues, stu
dents are willing to act. The administration
has to make sense now."
And here is no doubt that the administration
is trying harder. As one fringe member puts
it,"The administration pays more attention to
students than it likes to admit. And it is slow
to credit them."
But the reciprocal criticism also applies;
students are reluctant to give recognition to

the administration. The big problem in stu
dent-administration relations two years ago
was communication. The emphasis has shifted
somewhat now as each group recognizes that
where it had before assumed differences of
opinion, it can see now because the lines of
communication have been opened that the dif
ferences are real.
The basic problem seems to be one of trust.
If students felt they were a part of a joint
educational endeavor, in which the main cri
teria for decision-making, was as one observer
states "the engagement of the intellect over
a subject as one aspect of the educational
process," an entirely different atmosphere
would prevail.
By the combination of real participation
and openness which would require redress and
public accountability, the atmosphere of sus
picion could be replaced with one in which
all were moving in the same directions.
What students are calling for is a substan
tial say in determining their own education.
They recall that the term "authority" implies
the consent of the governed; otherwise gov
erning is merely the exercise of power.
Few models have been worked out in detail,
but one theme seems to reappear in almost all
discussions: the theme of community. If agree
ment can be reached on the principles of com
munity, any structure would come from the
consensus almost naturally.
The characteristics students have posited
for the community center around the concep
tion of a core of shared values, which would
include above all openness and freedom from
bias.
This attitude must first be employed, some
students feel, in self-analysis. Without funda
mental questioning of the assumptions upon
which the current structure of the University
is based, not even a beginning can be made
toward achieving community.
And before community is achieved, other
attitudes must change. Community involves
1) having an identification with the Univer
sity over and above loyalty to discipline or
constituency and 2) seeing people as individu
als rather than as representatives of consti
tuencies.
These traits seems to be lacking at Stanford
today and the insulting "power bloc" relation
ships make change appear the result of a vic
tory of one bloc over another rather than a
communal achievement.
As long as students are thought of as stu
dents rather than as more intellects being
"engaged over a subject," power blocs and
their consequent tactics will prevail. When stu
dents feel the frustration of their ideas being
ignored simply because of their status, they
often conclude that "Brinksmanship" is the
only way to push Stanford over the edge of
greatness.

Hopefully, the set of relations now pri
ing will be transcended, but one suspects
the structure and its occupants have bee
so identified with each other that m
change is impossible during the current
eration of either students or administrators.
Part of the gap between students and the
administration, which seems too much to
bridge: is the difference in values. In the case
of the current crop of students, the difference
seems to be more than is accountable by any
merely generational gap.
This generation tends to put the emphasis
on operations rather than content as the way
to authenticating a moral system.
"We are more open-minded and less dog
matic," one student explains. "We have a rela
tivistic conception of moral values and believe
that allowing people to develop themselves,
rather than imposing on them a system of
values, is the way to bring a happy society."
But the era of student-administration rela
tions may have come to an end, or at least a
lessening in intensity, for the recent ASSU
campaign was run on educational reform,
which will necessitate more dealing with the
faculty.
Opinion varies as to whether curricular
change will come more easily or with greater
difficulty than have the changes over rules
and regulations.
One administrator feels that "the difficult
changes are the visible ones. Those are now
past. Educational reform can be approached
on honest intellectual grounds, which was not
possible when the battles were being fought
in the public press."
On the other hand, curricular criticism can
often be interpreted as an attack on the pro
fessional autonomy of the professor. And even
more desperately, some students feel that the
refusal to be self-critical applies to the faculty
as well as the administration.
Faculty Paternalism
The administrative mentality causing a com
modity view of education in the administra
tion has pervaded the faculty as well. Pa
ternalism here is reflected in an attitude of
dispensing knowledge to a passive receptacle.
And just as with paternalism in the admin
istration, paternalism in the faculty is hard to
puncture. Some students have found a real
unwillingness on the part of some faculty
members to be honestly evaluative of their
own achievements or to confront students as
authorities in their own right.
A third body of opinion on curricular reform
holds that the administration, not the faculty,
is the key to reform because its conception of
education is the prevailing one.
This group feels that questions about foun
dations must be asked of a structure which
emphasizes passive receptivity. Regurgitation
of knowledge as a basis of determining level
of education seems to some students to reflect
Stanford's overbalance on the side of accomo
dating society.
Dave Harris based his campaign upon dis
satisfaction with the existing structure and he
analyzes his election as "an expression of stu
dent discontent, a broad emotional statement
of dissatisfaction with the type of education
given here and the student's role in it."
Education at Stanford, he says, is viewed as
"indoctrination, not participation. The student
is treated as a second-class citizen in the com
munity; his life is fragmented."
He would like to see students participating
in an "integrative four-year experience rather
than in a training period."
His preliminary plans for next year include
activities on two fronts. First, the fifty or so
people who recently signed up to work in his
organization will devote must of their efforts
to research in the fields of education, decision
making, student rights, and housing.
Second, under the heading of special Presi
dential programs, Harris is planning to back
an experimental college "to build in the mi
crocosm what we want in the macrocosm,"
and hopes to sponsor a national conference on
education.
The recent analysis by Katz and Nevitt San
ford of student activism nationally (Saturday
Review, December) has remarkable applica
tion to the situation at Stanford. They say that
the "demand for participation does not stem
from any desire to make college life easier.
Rather it springs from a profound attempt to
seek answers as to how one might achieve
such ends as a reliable personal identity, com
munity with other people, and social objectives
that will bring comfort and justice to those
largely bereft of them in our society."
Level Of Investigation
Their research shows that "the socially in
volved students total not more than 15 per
cent, but the movement can no longer be con
trolled by dealing with the minority alone, be
cause it is expressing the frustrations and as
pirations now shared by the majority of stu
dents."
The current situation represents a unique
opportunity to college administations, they
say. "Administrators who can find some way
to respond to what is human, though some
times chaotically expressed, in these under
graduate students, will find that they are go
ing to be part of a truly revolutionary phase
in the history of education."
"While the eighteenth century discovered
that good government depends upon the con
sent of the governed, our generation has the
opportunity of discovering and bringing to
fruition a system of education that is based
upon the consent of the educated."
On purely pragmatic grounds, encourage
ment of student participation in educational
reform is desirable, because, as one student
commented last spring in reaction to a speech
by President Sterling: "The 'Stanford student
movement'—if indeed, a movement exists as
such—does not represent a rebellious asser
tion of 'student autonomy' but, rather, a con
sidered and concerncd effort to help create a
better, more challenging university for those
students who follow."
There have been several signs since that
time that President Sterling shares much the
same opinion. At a recent alumni conference,
he commented that one strain of student pro
test shows "a genuine interest in the construc
tive task of improving education."
Recognition of the sincerity and construc
tive purpose of many student activists is cer
tainly welcome, but "what they desire most is
the appearance of forceful and self-critical
leadership dedicated to educational reform.
When that leadership becomes visible, stu
dents will at last be able to say that the proc
ess of bringing up father has been completed.


"Klein proposes embellishments on the cur
rent structure; I reject the asumptions on
which the current structure is based."
These words of ASSU President-elect Dave
Harris, spoken during a campaign debate
against Bob Klein, symbolize several years
of student activism at Stanford and serve as
a harbinger of the new direction in which
student activism has begun to turn.
Historically, student concern at Stanford has
been expressed in two broad areas. The first
is a rebellion against the existing conception
of the role of the student. Much of the work
of the past half decade has been to remove
the image of the student as a passive recep
tacle to be treated rather arbitrarily and pa
ternalistically.
But running beneath the surface demands
for respect and participation has been a steady
current asking questions of a much broader
nature, such as what is a university and what
is its relation to society. These questions have
either not been answered or have not been
answered satisfactorily.
It is this dilemma of looking for leadership,
not finding it, and consequently vesting au
thority in themselves that has caused the sec
ond thrust of student activists. If the adminis
ration is incapable or unwilling to articulate
a philosophy of education, some students have
said, we will begin the dialogue alone.
Both strands of the protest—that ag3 ?r,t! t
an anachronistic and degrading set of rules
and the call for discussion of broader educa
tional issues—was summarized two years ago
by one student observer:
"In the minds of many student leaders, arbi
trariness is at once a direct function of an un
necessarily paternal attitude on the part of
the administration and a denial of the essen
tial academic nature of the University."
"Students fear a vacuum—the lack of a co
herent philosophy of education at the top of
the administrative structure. They ask the
question, "Where is the leadership?" and are
forced to conclude it is nowhere if not in them
selves."
Bringing Up Father
Given the essentially paternalistic attitude
of the administration and the students' self
imposed tasi of educating the administration
on what thej feel to be some basic educational
concepts, th history of Stanford in recent
years might be titled "Bringing Up Father."
The significance of the Harris election, com
ing at the same time that most of the battles
over rules and regulations have been won, is
that student energy, and in turn administration
energy, will at last be concentrated on the sec
ond of the two areas of thrust: the attempt to
define and to work toward a new conception of
education.
But before students could begin asking
questions about the nature of their education,
they had to achieve a status in which they
were listened to. Much of the effort of the last
five years has been to gain this position. It
has been manifested as rebellion against the
role assigned to students by the administra
tion.
Basically, what the students have rebelled
against is being treated as immature and
being treated as things. Both flow from an
administrative mentality which student lead
ers think is essentially paternalistic and fre
quently arbitrary.
Paternalism is characterized by over-pro
tectiveness. It is the attitude that "we know
your best interest." Paternalism should at
least be personal, critics say, but it is not
when it is combined with the administrative
mentality which, in the words of one faculty
member "puts a premium on efficiency, and
peace and quiet."
"The person is taken out for the common
good, expediting the educational process,"
another professor points out. This has two
unfortunate consequences. First, something
has gone terribly wrong when people and their
development, those things which should be the
central concern of education, are ignored. But
more importantly, the system is self-perpetu
ating. If one assumes that the system he op
erates functions well and he dismisses critic
ism as being uninformed or as coming from
people too young to understand, the system
is impregnable.
It is for this reason that students have been
turned a deaf ear when they have raised the
broader issues, such as the nature of the uni
versity's relation to society. And, unfortun
ately, these types of questions have arisen as
natural consequences of questioning the sys
tem of dealing with students.
For example, the administrative mentality
that students have criticized" is a sytom of
what some critics term commodity education.
"There is a cultural assumption in Ameri
ca," one observer points out, "that institu
tions of society produce commodities." The
university is an institution and what it pro
duces are trained minds, components for the
assembly line of society.
Dual Responsibility
The broad issue which Stanford has not
faced, critics say, is to bring into balance the
university's dual set of relations to society.
As transmitter of the cultural heritage, the
university is in an accommodating role to soci
ety. It has the responsibility of preparing the
new generation to take control of the institu
tions of society.
But secondly, the university is critic of the
culture being transmitted. In this second role,
it conflicts with society.
The more articulate students feel that Stan
ford has become overbalanced on the side of
accomodation to society. As former ASSU
President Bud Wedin wrote in a recent article
on education at Stanford: "unlike Faustus
who sold his soul to the devil for more honor
able reasons, Stanford has aligned itself with
the biases and norms of the technological
society for want of any soul at all."
Another unfortunate result of the adminis
tration's refusal to listen to students is that
they feel compelled out of frustration to use
forceful tactics.
"They don't understand that what we say
has merit," one student leader states. "And on
the other hand, we don't understand them
because they don't explain their actions to
us." When the gap between students and ad
ministration is as large as it apparently is,
another states, "the situation suggests per
haps some inadequacy to mere discussion."
The administration has learned to listen
over the last half decade to what students
are saying and thus drastic tactics have not
been used. Explanations of this phenomenon

vary, however. The pessimists maintain that
"a lot of the change hasn't been basic attitud
inal change. It was merely strategic change
due to pressure.
The administration has played a holding
game, one adherent of this position main
tains, in the hope that "the activist minority
would graduate and this would all be over."
The significance of the Harris election, this
observer says, is to prove that pressure for
change "is not a temporary aberration caused
by a scapegoat figure."
The other side maintains that there has
been a very definite maturing process on the
part of the administration. One member of
the administration maintains, "we are no
longer over-reacting; we have more confi
dence and a better time perspective."
A slightly cynical student adds: "They know
they just can't do certain things now that
they could a few years ago. The old ploy of
divide and conquer won't work; if a minority

is being isolated and treated unjustly, a sub
stantial segment of the community will rise
in their defense."
In response to continued student demands
for change, some of the most sensitive admin
istrators (there are at least three or four
people over thirty in the administration who
can be trusted) have suggested tactics which
they feel would be the most effective for
students.
The list of one, Associate Undergraauate
Dean Robert Hind, reads as follows: • arm
yourself with facts; • go to the appropriate
person; • be open-minded; • concentrate on
academic improvement rather than peripheral
matters.
Associate Dean of Students Joel Smith sug
gests that "students are paid more attention
on pragmatic questions where they have rele
vant information. Their effect is limited when
they talk about the structure of the univers
ity."
But what Stanford has lacked, the articulate
students feel, is analysis of the structure.
"Without a discussion and an articulation of a
broad concept of education." One retired stu
dent leader states, "Stanford can only have
accretions to the current structure." And the
current structure he and many others regard
as inadequate.
The underlying criticism is a challenge of
the existing conception of authority.
The problem arises from a confusion be
tween education and administration. The uni
versity is an institution of society and thus
has a governing body. But the authority vested
ih it is only for administrative matters.
"The administration and the trustees tend
to think of education as one facet of adminis
tration, rather than vice versa as it should
be," one observer feels.
Another laments that "authority no longer
relates to education." Final authority in the
universiy, this student feels, should be
"truth,"and all other authority gains its
legitimacy in relation to this primary author
ity.
Dialogue Impossible
Fundamental to the search for truth is
"the courage to attack your convictions." At
least some Stanford students have found this
trait lacking in both the administration and the
faculty. This discovery has had at least two
unfortunate results.
First, some students have by default come
to vest authority in their peers because they
feel the faculty and administration have abdi
cated their responsibility to be self-critical.
This results in education being less challeng
ing than it could be if, these students feel,
they could respect the faculty as searching
minds as well as dispensers of knowledge.
But more broadly, a dialogue about the cur
rent structure of the university is not even
possible because of the attitude of the adminis
tration. "Real disagreement is now impos
sible," one student states. "The joint inquiry
we desire requires questioning assumptions.
The administration is as yet unwilling to do
this."
"Something must be done to challenge their
parochial conception of authority. They won't
recognize student authority or any higher
authority. Stanford has neither the courage
nor the capability to question itself funda
mentally because of its parochialism."
Concomitant to the efforts at bringing up
Father has been the effort to "Bring Leland
off the Farm." The last decade has been the
emergence of Stanford from a rather paroch
ial Western institution to a university of na
tional reputation.
The result of the very deliberate efforts to
upgrade the faculty by bringing to Stanford
people from outside has been to make the be
ginnings, at least, of a process of self-criticism.
In the student body, this process was begun
by people like Allard Lowenstein, who was
for a year director of Stem Hall and taught
in the Political Science department.
"A 1 brought wide experience to a parochial
campus," one former administrator states. "He
came to Stanford at a time when there was a
feeling that major changes were needed. He
gave students confidence that change was
worthwhile and that students could make the
difference in bringing change where it had
before appeared impossible."
For several years, many students feel, the
administration used Lowenstein and the stu
dents he met during his year here as the ex
planation of student activism. The name
"Lowenstein" is not heard often anymore at
Stanford and yet students seem more dedi
cated than ever before to pressing for changes.
Much of the thrust of Lowenstein and stu
dents he inspired was to convince students
that they did have a right to be heard and a
right to be treated as adults. In a sense, these
feelings triggered the rebellion against the

old conception of the role of the student, a
rebellion which took form in the demand for
respect.
But this first rebellion was merely the
establishment of the base on which the real
discussion of education could begin. Now that
student leaders have largely completed the
attack on the facade of the current structure,
they are moving towards positing their own
conception of education. This second of the
two thrusts of student activism is summarized
by the term "integration."
First, students demand that their scholarly
and their social criticism be integrated. Many
students find it hypocritical on the part of the
administration to demand of students a critical
attitude and an openness of mind in the class
room but not to expect the same techniques
and commitments to apply outside the class.
"It seems strange," says one close ob
server of the administration, "that we excite
students about social institutions and then
tell them to keep the valve shut until they
leave."
The basic problem, as analyzed by several
of the most astute student critics, is one of
leadership. Ilene Strelitz, Daily editor, wrote
two years ago, in an editorial titled "Where is
Leadership in the University?":
"The criticism levelled at the student is
consistently in the direction of inaction; don't
step beyond the classroom, don't speak out,
and above all don't hold the lectures in the
classroom and the words in the text as rele
vant to the broad issues of controversy facing
your generation.
Students Make Demands
"This is an odd reversal of roles.
"The student should be criticized. The Presi
dent . . . should demand more confrontation
by the student of the responsibility of the edu
cated to the society. His words should be a
constant barrage of criticism for unawareness,
ignorance of 'the world outside', lack of appli
cation of talents, the need for the university
to be the fearless critic and ethical leader.
'It is the role of leadership to criticize and
to demand action, to pose the questions, not to
prohibit them. The students wait for a leader
to raise up before them.
"... The greatest sadness of all will come
if nothing is done, for the President, the deans,
etc. are leaders, no matter how they construe
that role. And it will be sad if the students are
led into passive and uncaring commitments to
stagnation."
There are strong indications that at least
a significant minority are not heading toward
stagnation, but it seems that many are doing
so in spite of, rather than because of any atti
tudes or policies of the administration. And,
in the strangest irony of all, it is the students
who have been demanding that the university
examine its responsibility to society, that the
university be the "formulator not the reflector
of cultural values," that the university define
itself.
But integration of scholarly and social critic
ism is only one of several types of integration
students have called for. The second type is
the integration of thought and action. Here,
students find inspiration in the words of Pro
fessors Otis Pease and Robert McAfee Brown.
Pease speaks of the paradox between curi
osity and commitment. "A great university,"
he says "may choose to do many things, but
the one thing it must do is to generate curios
ity and a sense of commitment among its stu
dents and teachers. And therein lies a para
dox."
"Curiosity is nothing less than the endless
desire to find truth about something; com
mitment involves the desire to act on what
one believes to be truth."
"It is the task of great teaching to create
an environment in which a person may learn
for himself to resolve this paradox, to learn
how he may fuse curiosity and commitment, so
that each, in reinforcing the other, may to
gether give life to his mind where singly they
would destroy it."
Brown emphasizes that "study and direct
concern cannot properly be separated from
one another."
"The notion that student revolt—whether
over Vietnam or social regulations or racial
injustice—is 'interfering with education' is a
notion incompatible with the recognition that
in the life of the truly educated person,
thought and action are indivisible."
"There is involved here a kind of amalgam
of vision, unrest, dissatisfaction, and a desire
to do something about it all. The task of the
university is not to keep a student separated
from the world, but to involve him more re
sponsibly in it."
For many students, the process has been
reversed: they have found through participa
tion in other social institutions that students
can play an active role in bringing change.
This belief, in turn, has been brought back
to the university, where many of these stu
dents find it increasingly unbearable to be
treated like passive containers into which in
formation is to be poured," says Joseph Katz
of the Institute for the Study of Human Prob
lems.
Katz thinks that the change in student con
sciousness is so drastic as to be "a possible
turning point in educational history.. Similar
to the people of the Renaissance and the
French revolution, students today have a new
consciousness: they feel differently about
themselves and about the world."
Gone is the passive acceptance of the exist
ing society and the individual's role in it. "Stu
dents now feel that they can do something
about their situation. Further, if things are
not as they should be, they feel that it is not
all their fault and that part rests in the social
sructure."
A third thrust of student pressure has been
to integrate the student's status outside the
classroom to his status inside. Much of he con
troversy summed up as "the revolt against
rules and regulations" has been based on the
contention that the student is treated differ
ently in his social life than he is in his aca
demic endeavors.
"There is a certain incongurity in demand
ing a critical attitude in class and assuming
that people can not regulate their own lives,"
one student leader states. "Such hypocrisy
ignores or blurs the facts." And again, lead
ership in the university is questioned.
"Because of this abdication, this refusal by
the administration to face problems," the same
student adds, "the task has fallen to the stu
dents."
All he three previously mentioned "integra
tions" have been mere preliminaries to the
final integration: incorporation of students
into the scholarly community.
Two years ago, in his concluding address
as ASSU President, Bud Wedin stated: "We

have taken a great deal of tolerance and un
derstanding from this community and replaced
it with skill and efficiency. Too often we have
regarded the individual as an object and have
seen him only in relation to rules or regula
tions."
"In short, we seem to have lost the vision of
a democratic university in which all share cer
tain rights of participation in matters of com
mon concern, and of freedom of inquiry, as
sociation, and development, and where pa
ternalism is replaced by fellowship in the
company of scholars."
"Perhaps it is time to review some of the
institutions of our society at Stanford to see
if we are really doing our utmost to produce
students with the intellectual maturity, the
self-assurance, and the sense of dignity and
independence so needed in today's society."
The following fall, a group of students and
faculty members formed the Stanford Associa
tion of University Scholars. The purpose of
the group, according to its founder Bob Rosen,
was "to break false dichotomies. Usually the
students and faculty are thought of in opposi
tion to the 'University.' We think that studens
and faculty, because they are the practicing
scholars, are the University. The administra
tion exists to work for the University, to fa
cilitate the pursuit of knowledge."
SAUS faded away, partially out of an inabil
ity to define itself and partially because the
energy of the participants was directed to
other activities. The participants in SAUS,
Rosen explains, were also involved in larger
political movements as well.
The fact that no new SAUS has arisen is
no sign that students are no longer interested
in education. Quite the contrary, Rosen mam
tains: participation in things such as the ASSU
Education Commission is far more broadly
based than concern over educational reform
ever has been.
"There is now a sincere interest in educa
tional reform," Rosen states, "and an orienta
tion toward acting on ideas. Groups will re
emerge on a formal basis with a fuller, strong
er consensus than SAUS ever had."
Just an opinion about rules and regulations
became part of the popular consciousness at
Stanford in the years following the original
questioning of the system, so now educational
reform has now been accepted.
Expect Change
"Whereas two years ago, no one thought
change possible," another says, "we now ex
pect change because we have had change. In
the election of Harris, it was shown for the
first time that on really important issues, stu
dents are willing to act. The administration
has to make sense now."
And here is no doubt that the administration
is trying harder. As one fringe member puts
it,"The administration pays more attention to
students than it likes to admit. And it is slow
to credit them."
But the reciprocal criticism also applies;
students are reluctant to give recognition to

the administration. The big problem in stu
dent-administration relations two years ago
was communication. The emphasis has shifted
somewhat now as each group recognizes that
where it had before assumed differences of
opinion, it can see now because the lines of
communication have been opened that the dif
ferences are real.
The basic problem seems to be one of trust.
If students felt they were a part of a joint
educational endeavor, in which the main cri
teria for decision-making, was as one observer
states "the engagement of the intellect over
a subject as one aspect of the educational
process," an entirely different atmosphere
would prevail.
By the combination of real participation
and openness which would require redress and
public accountability, the atmosphere of sus
picion could be replaced with one in which
all were moving in the same directions.
What students are calling for is a substan
tial say in determining their own education.
They recall that the term "authority" implies
the consent of the governed; otherwise gov
erning is merely the exercise of power.
Few models have been worked out in detail,
but one theme seems to reappear in almost all
discussions: the theme of community. If agree
ment can be reached on the principles of com
munity, any structure would come from the
consensus almost naturally.
The characteristics students have posited
for the community center around the concep
tion of a core of shared values, which would
include above all openness and freedom from
bias.
This attitude must first be employed, some
students feel, in self-analysis. Without funda
mental questioning of the assumptions upon
which the current structure of the University
is based, not even a beginning can be made
toward achieving community.
And before community is achieved, other
attitudes must change. Community involves
1) having an identification with the Univer
sity over and above loyalty to discipline or
constituency and 2) seeing people as individu
als rather than as representatives of consti
tuencies.
These traits seems to be lacking at Stanford
today and the insulting "power bloc" relation
ships make change appear the result of a vic
tory of one bloc over another rather than a
communal achievement.
As long as students are thought of as stu
dents rather than as more intellects being
"engaged over a subject," power blocs and
their consequent tactics will prevail. When stu
dents feel the frustration of their ideas being
ignored simply because of their status, they
often conclude that "Brinksmanship" is the
only way to push Stanford over the edge of
greatness.

Hopefully, the set of relations now pri
ing will be transcended, but one suspects
the structure and its occupants have bee
so identified with each other that m
change is impossible during the current
eration of either students or administrators.
Part of the gap between students and the
administration, which seems too much to
bridge: is the difference in values. In the case
of the current crop of students, the difference
seems to be more than is accountable by any
merely generational gap.
This generation tends to put the emphasis
on operations rather than content as the way
to authenticating a moral system.
"We are more open-minded and less dog
matic," one student explains. "We have a rela
tivistic conception of moral values and believe
that allowing people to develop themselves,
rather than imposing on them a system of
values, is the way to bring a happy society."
But the era of student-administration rela
tions may have come to an end, or at least a
lessening in intensity, for the recent ASSU
campaign was run on educational reform,
which will necessitate more dealing with the
faculty.
Opinion varies as to whether curricular
change will come more easily or with greater
difficulty than have the changes over rules
and regulations.
One administrator feels that "the difficult
changes are the visible ones. Those are now
past. Educational reform can be approached
on honest intellectual grounds, which was not
possible when the battles were being fought
in the public press."
On the other hand, curricular criticism can
often be interpreted as an attack on the pro
fessional autonomy of the professor. And even
more desperately, some students feel that the
refusal to be self-critical applies to the faculty
as well as the administration.
Faculty Paternalism
The administrative mentality causing a com
modity view of education in the administra
tion has pervaded the faculty as well. Pa
ternalism here is reflected in an attitude of
dispensing knowledge to a passive receptacle.
And just as with paternalism in the admin
istration, paternalism in the faculty is hard to
puncture. Some students have found a real
unwillingness on the part of some faculty
members to be honestly evaluative of their
own achievements or to confront students as
authorities in their own right.
A third body of opinion on curricular reform
holds that the administration, not the faculty,
is the key to reform because its conception of
education is the prevailing one.
This group feels that questions about foun
dations must be asked of a structure which
emphasizes passive receptivity. Regurgitation
of knowledge as a basis of determining level
of education seems to some students to reflect
Stanford's overbalance on the side of accomo
dating society.
Dave Harris based his campaign upon dis
satisfaction with the existing structure and he
analyzes his election as "an expression of stu
dent discontent, a broad emotional statement
of dissatisfaction with the type of education
given here and the student's role in it."
Education at Stanford, he says, is viewed as
"indoctrination, not participation. The student
is treated as a second-class citizen in the com
munity; his life is fragmented."
He would like to see students participating
in an "integrative four-year experience rather
than in a training period."
His preliminary plans for next year include
activities on two fronts. First, the fifty or so
people who recently signed up to work in his
organization will devote must of their efforts
to research in the fields of education, decision
making, student rights, and housing.
Second, under the heading of special Presi
dential programs, Harris is planning to back
an experimental college "to build in the mi
crocosm what we want in the macrocosm,"
and hopes to sponsor a national conference on
education.
The recent analysis by Katz and Nevitt San
ford of student activism nationally (Saturday
Review, December) has remarkable applica
tion to the situation at Stanford. They say that
the "demand for participation does not stem
from any desire to make college life easier.
Rather it springs from a profound attempt to
seek answers as to how one might achieve
such ends as a reliable personal identity, com
munity with other people, and social objectives
that will bring comfort and justice to those
largely bereft of them in our society."
Level Of Investigation
Their research shows that "the socially in
volved students total not more than 15 per
cent, but the movement can no longer be con
trolled by dealing with the minority alone, be
cause it is expressing the frustrations and as
pirations now shared by the majority of stu
dents."
The current situation represents a unique
opportunity to college administations, they
say. "Administrators who can find some way
to respond to what is human, though some
times chaotically expressed, in these under
graduate students, will find that they are go
ing to be part of a truly revolutionary phase
in the history of education."
"While the eighteenth century discovered
that good government depends upon the con
sent of the governed, our generation has the
opportunity of discovering and bringing to
fruition a system of education that is based
upon the consent of the educated."
On purely pragmatic grounds, encourage
ment of student participation in educational
reform is desirable, because, as one student
commented last spring in reaction to a speech
by President Sterling: "The 'Stanford student
movement'—if indeed, a movement exists as
such—does not represent a rebellious asser
tion of 'student autonomy' but, rather, a con
sidered and concerncd effort to help create a
better, more challenging university for those
students who follow."
There have been several signs since that
time that President Sterling shares much the
same opinion. At a recent alumni conference,
he commented that one strain of student pro
test shows "a genuine interest in the construc
tive task of improving education."
Recognition of the sincerity and construc
tive purpose of many student activists is cer
tainly welcome, but "what they desire most is
the appearance of forceful and self-critical
leadership dedicated to educational reform.
When that leadership becomes visible, stu
dents will at last be able to say that the proc
ess of bringing up father has been completed.


"Klein proposes embellishments on the cur
rent structure; I reject the asumptions on
which the current structure is based."
These words of ASSU President-elect Dave
Harris, spoken during a campaign debate
against Bob Klein, symbolize several years
of student activism at Stanford and serve as
a harbinger of the new direction in which
student activism has begun to turn.
Historically, student concern at Stanford has
been expressed in two broad areas. The first
is a rebellion against the existing conception
of the role of the student. Much of the work
of the past half decade has been to remove
the image of the student as a passive recep
tacle to be treated rather arbitrarily and pa
ternalistically.
But running beneath the surface demands
for respect and participation has been a steady
current asking questions of a much broader
nature, such as what is a university and what
is its relation to society. These questions have
either not been answered or have not been
answered satisfactorily.
It is this dilemma of looking for leadership,
not finding it, and consequently vesting au
thority in themselves that has caused the sec
ond thrust of student activists. If the adminis
ration is incapable or unwilling to articulate
a philosophy of education, some students have
said, we will begin the dialogue alone.
Both strands of the protest—that ag3 ?r,t! t
an anachronistic and degrading set of rules
and the call for discussion of broader educa
tional issues—was summarized two years ago
by one student observer:
"In the minds of many student leaders, arbi
trariness is at once a direct function of an un
necessarily paternal attitude on the part of
the administration and a denial of the essen
tial academic nature of the University."
"Students fear a vacuum—the lack of a co
herent philosophy of education at the top of
the administrative structure. They ask the
question, "Where is the leadership?" and are
forced to conclude it is nowhere if not in them
selves."
Bringing Up Father
Given the essentially paternalistic attitude
of the administration and the students' self
imposed tasi of educating the administration
on what thej feel to be some basic educational
concepts, th history of Stanford in recent
years might be titled "Bringing Up Father."
The significance of the Harris election, com
ing at the same time that most of the battles
over rules and regulations have been won, is
that student energy, and in turn administration
energy, will at last be concentrated on the sec
ond of the two areas of thrust: the attempt to
define and to work toward a new conception of
education.
But before students could begin asking
questions about the nature of their education,
they had to achieve a status in which they
were listened to. Much of the effort of the last
five years has been to gain this position. It
has been manifested as rebellion against the
role assigned to students by the administra
tion.
Basically, what the students have rebelled
against is being treated as immature and
being treated as things. Both flow from an
administrative mentality which student lead
ers think is essentially paternalistic and fre
quently arbitrary.
Paternalism is characterized by over-pro
tectiveness. It is the attitude that "we know
your best interest." Paternalism should at
least be personal, critics say, but it is not
when it is combined with the administrative
mentality which, in the words of one faculty
member "puts a premium on efficiency, and
peace and quiet."
"The person is taken out for the common
good, expediting the educational process,"
another professor points out. This has two
unfortunate consequences. First, something
has gone terribly wrong when people and their
development, those things which should be the
central concern of education, are ignored. But
more importantly, the system is self-perpetu
ating. If one assumes that the system he op
erates functions well and he dismisses critic
ism as being uninformed or as coming from
people too young to understand, the system
is impregnable.
It is for this reason that students have been
turned a deaf ear when they have raised the
broader issues, such as the nature of the uni
versity's relation to society. And, unfortun
ately, these types of questions have arisen as
natural consequences of questioning the sys
tem of dealing with students.
For example, the administrative mentality
that students have criticized" is a sytom of
what some critics term commodity education.
"There is a cultural assumption in Ameri
ca," one observer points out, "that institu
tions of society produce commodities." The
university is an institution and what it pro
duces are trained minds, components for the
assembly line of society.
Dual Responsibility
The broad issue which Stanford has not
faced, critics say, is to bring into balance the
university's dual set of relations to society.
As transmitter of the cultural heritage, the
university is in an accommodating role to soci
ety. It has the responsibility of preparing the
new generation to take control of the institu
tions of society.
But secondly, the university is critic of the
culture being transmitted. In this second role,
it conflicts with society.
The more articulate students feel that Stan
ford has become overbalanced on the side of
accomodation to society. As former ASSU
President Bud Wedin wrote in a recent article
on education at Stanford: "unlike Faustus
who sold his soul to the devil for more honor
able reasons, Stanford has aligned itself with
the biases and norms of the technological
society for want of any soul at all."
Another unfortunate result of the adminis
tration's refusal to listen to students is that
they feel compelled out of frustration to use
forceful tactics.
"They don't understand that what we say
has merit," one student leader states. "And on
the other hand, we don't understand them
because they don't explain their actions to
us." When the gap between students and ad
ministration is as large as it apparently is,
another states, "the situation suggests per
haps some inadequacy to mere discussion."
The administration has learned to listen
over the last half decade to what students
are saying and thus drastic tactics have not
been used. Explanations of this phenomenon

vary, however. The pessimists maintain that
"a lot of the change hasn't been basic attitud
inal change. It was merely strategic change
due to pressure.
The administration has played a holding
game, one adherent of this position main
tains, in the hope that "the activist minority
would graduate and this would all be over."
The significance of the Harris election, this
observer says, is to prove that pressure for
change "is not a temporary aberration caused
by a scapegoat figure."
The other side maintains that there has
been a very definite maturing process on the
part of the administration. One member of
the administration maintains, "we are no
longer over-reacting; we have more confi
dence and a better time perspective."
A slightly cynical student adds: "They know
they just can't do certain things now that
they could a few years ago. The old ploy of
divide and conquer won't work; if a minority

is being isolated and treated unjustly, a sub
stantial segment of the community will rise
in their defense."
In response to continued student demands
for change, some of the most sensitive admin
istrators (there are at least three or four
people over thirty in the administration who
can be trusted) have suggested tactics which
they feel would be the most effective for
students.
The list of one, Associate Undergraauate
Dean Robert Hind, reads as follows: • arm
yourself with facts; • go to the appropriate
person; • be open-minded; • concentrate on
academic improvement rather than peripheral
matters.
Associate Dean of Students Joel Smith sug
gests that "students are paid more attention
on pragmatic questions where they have rele
vant information. Their effect is limited when
they talk about the structure of the univers
ity."
But what Stanford has lacked, the articulate
students feel, is analysis of the structure.
"Without a discussion and an articulation of a
broad concept of education." One retired stu
dent leader states, "Stanford can only have
accretions to the current structure." And the
current structure he and many others regard
as inadequate.
The underlying criticism is a challenge of
the existing conception of authority.
The problem arises from a confusion be
tween education and administration. The uni
versity is an institution of society and thus
has a governing body. But the authority vested
ih it is only for administrative matters.
"The administration and the trustees tend
to think of education as one facet of adminis
tration, rather than vice versa as it should
be," one observer feels.
Another laments that "authority no longer
relates to education." Final authority in the
universiy, this student feels, should be
"truth,"and all other authority gains its
legitimacy in relation to this primary author
ity.
Dialogue Impossible
Fundamental to the search for truth is
"the courage to attack your convictions." At
least some Stanford students have found this
trait lacking in both the administration and the
faculty. This discovery has had at least two
unfortunate results.
First, some students have by default come
to vest authority in their peers because they
feel the faculty and administration have abdi
cated their responsibility to be self-critical.
This results in education being less challeng
ing than it could be if, these students feel,
they could respect the faculty as searching
minds as well as dispensers of knowledge.
But more broadly, a dialogue about the cur
rent structure of the university is not even
possible because of the attitude of the adminis
tration. "Real disagreement is now impos
sible," one student states. "The joint inquiry
we desire requires questioning assumptions.
The administration is as yet unwilling to do
this."
"Something must be done to challenge their
parochial conception of authority. They won't
recognize student authority or any higher
authority. Stanford has neither the courage
nor the capability to question itself funda
mentally because of its parochialism."
Concomitant to the efforts at bringing up
Father has been the effort to "Bring Leland
off the Farm." The last decade has been the
emergence of Stanford from a rather paroch
ial Western institution to a university of na
tional reputation.
The result of the very deliberate efforts to
upgrade the faculty by bringing to Stanford
people from outside has been to make the be
ginnings, at least, of a process of self-criticism.
In the student body, this process was begun
by people like Allard Lowenstein, who was
for a year director of Stem Hall and taught
in the Political Science department.
"A 1 brought wide experience to a parochial
campus," one former administrator states. "He
came to Stanford at a time when there was a
feeling that major changes were needed. He
gave students confidence that change was
worthwhile and that students could make the
difference in bringing change where it had
before appeared impossible."
For several years, many students feel, the
administration used Lowenstein and the stu
dents he met during his year here as the ex
planation of student activism. The name
"Lowenstein" is not heard often anymore at
Stanford and yet students seem more dedi
cated than ever before to pressing for changes.
Much of the thrust of Lowenstein and stu
dents he inspired was to convince students
that they did have a right to be heard and a
right to be treated as adults. In a sense, these
feelings triggered the rebellion against the

old conception of the role of the student, a
rebellion which took form in the demand for
respect.
But this first rebellion was merely the
establishment of the base on which the real
discussion of education could begin. Now that
student leaders have largely completed the
attack on the facade of the current structure,
they are moving towards positing their own
conception of education. This second of the
two thrusts of student activism is summarized
by the term "integration."
First, students demand that their scholarly
and their social criticism be integrated. Many
students find it hypocritical on the part of the
administration to demand of students a critical
attitude and an openness of mind in the class
room but not to expect the same techniques
and commitments to apply outside the class.
"It seems strange," says one close ob
server of the administration, "that we excite
students about social institutions and then
tell them to keep the valve shut until they
leave."
The basic problem, as analyzed by several
of the most astute student critics, is one of
leadership. Ilene Strelitz, Daily editor, wrote
two years ago, in an editorial titled "Where is
Leadership in the University?":
"The criticism levelled at the student is
consistently in the direction of inaction; don't
step beyond the classroom, don't speak out,
and above all don't hold the lectures in the
classroom and the words in the text as rele
vant to the broad issues of controversy facing
your generation.
Students Make Demands
"This is an odd reversal of roles.
"The student should be criticized. The Presi
dent . . . should demand more confrontation
by the student of the responsibility of the edu
cated to the society. His words should be a
constant barrage of criticism for unawareness,
ignorance of 'the world outside', lack of appli
cation of talents, the need for the university
to be the fearless critic and ethical leader.
'It is the role of leadership to criticize and
to demand action, to pose the questions, not to
prohibit them. The students wait for a leader
to raise up before them.
"... The greatest sadness of all will come
if nothing is done, for the President, the deans,
etc. are leaders, no matter how they construe
that role. And it will be sad if the students are
led into passive and uncaring commitments to
stagnation."
There are strong indications that at least
a significant minority are not heading toward
stagnation, but it seems that many are doing
so in spite of, rather than because of any atti
tudes or policies of the administration. And,
in the strangest irony of all, it is the students
who have been demanding that the university
examine its responsibility to society, that the
university be the "formulator not the reflector
of cultural values," that the university define
itself.
But integration of scholarly and social critic
ism is only one of several types of integration
students have called for. The second type is
the integration of thought and action. Here,
students find inspiration in the words of Pro
fessors Otis Pease and Robert McAfee Brown.
Pease speaks of the paradox between curi
osity and commitment. "A great university,"
he says "may choose to do many things, but
the one thing it must do is to generate curios
ity and a sense of commitment among its stu
dents and teachers. And therein lies a para
dox."
"Curiosity is nothing less than the endless
desire to find truth about something; com
mitment involves the desire to act on what
one believes to be truth."
"It is the task of great teaching to create
an environment in which a person may learn
for himself to resolve this paradox, to learn
how he may fuse curiosity and commitment, so
that each, in reinforcing the other, may to
gether give life to his mind where singly they
would destroy it."
Brown emphasizes that "study and direct
concern cannot properly be separated from
one another."
"The notion that student revolt—whether
over Vietnam or social regulations or racial
injustice—is 'interfering with education' is a
notion incompatible with the recognition that
in the life of the truly educated person,
thought and action are indivisible."
"There is involved here a kind of amalgam
of vision, unrest, dissatisfaction, and a desire
to do something about it all. The task of the
university is not to keep a student separated
from the world, but to involve him more re
sponsibly in it."
For many students, the process has been
reversed: they have found through participa
tion in other social institutions that students
can play an active role in bringing change.
This belief, in turn, has been brought back
to the university, where many of these stu
dents find it increasingly unbearable to be
treated like passive containers into which in
formation is to be poured," says Joseph Katz
of the Institute for the Study of Human Prob
lems.
Katz thinks that the change in student con
sciousness is so drastic as to be "a possible
turning point in educational history.. Similar
to the people of the Renaissance and the
French revolution, students today have a new
consciousness: they feel differently about
themselves and about the world."
Gone is the passive acceptance of the exist
ing society and the individual's role in it. "Stu
dents now feel that they can do something
about their situation. Further, if things are
not as they should be, they feel that it is not
all their fault and that part rests in the social
sructure."
A third thrust of student pressure has been
to integrate the student's status outside the
classroom to his status inside. Much of he con
troversy summed up as "the revolt against
rules and regulations" has been based on the
contention that the student is treated differ
ently in his social life than he is in his aca
demic endeavors.
"There is a certain incongurity in demand
ing a critical attitude in class and assuming
that people can not regulate their own lives,"
one student leader states. "Such hypocrisy
ignores or blurs the facts." And again, lead
ership in the university is questioned.
"Because of this abdication, this refusal by
the administration to face problems," the same
student adds, "the task has fallen to the stu
dents."
All he three previously mentioned "integra
tions" have been mere preliminaries to the
final integration: incorporation of students
into the scholarly community.
Two years ago, in his concluding address
as ASSU President, Bud Wedin stated: "We

have taken a great deal of tolerance and un
derstanding from this community and replaced
it with skill and efficiency. Too often we have
regarded the individual as an object and have
seen him only in relation to rules or regula
tions."
"In short, we seem to have lost the vision of
a democratic university in which all share cer
tain rights of participation in matters of com
mon concern, and of freedom of inquiry, as
sociation, and development, and where pa
ternalism is replaced by fellowship in the
company of scholars."
"Perhaps it is time to review some of the
institutions of our society at Stanford to see
if we are really doing our utmost to produce
students with the intellectual maturity, the
self-assurance, and the sense of dignity and
independence so needed in today's society."
The following fall, a group of students and
faculty members formed the Stanford Associa
tion of University Scholars. The purpose of
the group, according to its founder Bob Rosen,
was "to break false dichotomies. Usually the
students and faculty are thought of in opposi
tion to the 'University.' We think that studens
and faculty, because they are the practicing
scholars, are the University. The administra
tion exists to work for the University, to fa
cilitate the pursuit of knowledge."
SAUS faded away, partially out of an inabil
ity to define itself and partially because the
energy of the participants was directed to
other activities. The participants in SAUS,
Rosen explains, were also involved in larger
political movements as well.
The fact that no new SAUS has arisen is
no sign that students are no longer interested
in education. Quite the contrary, Rosen mam
tains: participation in things such as the ASSU
Education Commission is far more broadly
based than concern over educational reform
ever has been.
"There is now a sincere interest in educa
tional reform," Rosen states, "and an orienta
tion toward acting on ideas. Groups will re
emerge on a formal basis with a fuller, strong
er consensus than SAUS ever had."
Just an opinion about rules and regulations
became part of the popular consciousness at
Stanford in the years following the original
questioning of the system, so now educational
reform has now been accepted.
Expect Change
"Whereas two years ago, no one thought
change possible," another says, "we now ex
pect change because we have had change. In
the election of Harris, it was shown for the
first time that on really important issues, stu
dents are willing to act. The administration
has to make sense now."
And here is no doubt that the administration
is trying harder. As one fringe member puts
it,"The administration pays more attention to
students than it likes to admit. And it is slow
to credit them."
But the reciprocal criticism also applies;
students are reluctant to give recognition to

the administration. The big problem in stu
dent-administration relations two years ago
was communication. The emphasis has shifted
somewhat now as each group recognizes that
where it had before assumed differences of
opinion, it can see now because the lines of
communication have been opened that the dif
ferences are real.
The basic problem seems to be one of trust.
If students felt they were a part of a joint
educational endeavor, in which the main cri
teria for decision-making, was as one observer
states "the engagement of the intellect over
a subject as one aspect of the educational
process," an entirely different atmosphere
would prevail.
By the combination of real participation
and openness which would require redress and
public accountability, the atmosphere of sus
picion could be replaced with one in which
all were moving in the same directions.
What students are calling for is a substan
tial say in determining their own education.
They recall that the term "authority" implies
the consent of the governed; otherwise gov
erning is merely the exercise of power.
Few models have been worked out in detail,
but one theme seems to reappear in almost all
discussions: the theme of community. If agree
ment can be reached on the principles of com
munity, any structure would come from the
consensus almost naturally.
The characteristics students have posited
for the community center around the concep
tion of a core of shared values, which would
include above all openness and freedom from
bias.
This attitude must first be employed, some
students feel, in self-analysis. Without funda
mental questioning of the assumptions upon
which the current structure of the University
is based, not even a beginning can be made
toward achieving community.
And before community is achieved, other
attitudes must change. Community involves
1) having an identification with the Univer
sity over and above loyalty to discipline or
constituency and 2) seeing people as individu
als rather than as representatives of consti
tuencies.
These traits seems to be lacking at Stanford
today and the insulting "power bloc" relation
ships make change appear the result of a vic
tory of one bloc over another rather than a
communal achievement.
As long as students are thought of as stu
dents rather than as more intellects being
"engaged over a subject," power blocs and
their consequent tactics will prevail. When stu
dents feel the frustration of their ideas being
ignored simply because of their status, they
often conclude that "Brinksmanship" is the
only way to push Stanford over the edge of
greatness.

Hopefully, the set of relations now pri
ing will be transcended, but one suspects
the structure and its occupants have bee
so identified with each other that m
change is impossible during the current
eration of either students or administrators.
Part of the gap between students and the
administration, which seems too much to
bridge: is the difference in values. In the case
of the current crop of students, the difference
seems to be more than is accountable by any
merely generational gap.
This generation tends to put the emphasis
on operations rather than content as the way
to authenticating a moral system.
"We are more open-minded and less dog
matic," one student explains. "We have a rela
tivistic conception of moral values and believe
that allowing people to develop themselves,
rather than imposing on them a system of
values, is the way to bring a happy society."
But the era of student-administration rela
tions may have come to an end, or at least a
lessening in intensity, for the recent ASSU
campaign was run on educational reform,
which will necessitate more dealing with the
faculty.
Opinion varies as to whether curricular
change will come more easily or with greater
difficulty than have the changes over rules
and regulations.
One administrator feels that "the difficult
changes are the visible ones. Those are now
past. Educational reform can be approached
on honest intellectual grounds, which was not
possible when the battles were being fought
in the public press."
On the other hand, curricular criticism can
often be interpreted as an attack on the pro
fessional autonomy of the professor. And even
more desperately, some students feel that the
refusal to be self-critical applies to the faculty
as well as the administration.
Faculty Paternalism
The administrative mentality causing a com
modity view of education in the administra
tion has pervaded the faculty as well. Pa
ternalism here is reflected in an attitude of
dispensing knowledge to a passive receptacle.
And just as with paternalism in the admin
istration, paternalism in the faculty is hard to
puncture. Some students have found a real
unwillingness on the part of some faculty
members to be honestly evaluative of their
own achievements or to confront students as
authorities in their own right.
A third body of opinion on curricular reform
holds that the administration, not the faculty,
is the key to reform because its conception of
education is the prevailing one.
This group feels that questions about foun
dations must be asked of a structure which
emphasizes passive receptivity. Regurgitation
of knowledge as a basis of determining level
of education seems to some students to reflect
Stanford's overbalance on the side of accomo
dating society.
Dave Harris based his campaign upon dis
satisfaction with the existing structure and he
analyzes his election as "an expression of stu
dent discontent, a broad emotional statement
of dissatisfaction with the type of education
given here and the student's role in it."
Education at Stanford, he says, is viewed as
"indoctrination, not participation. The student
is treated as a second-class citizen in the com
munity; his life is fragmented."
He would like to see students participating
in an "integrative four-year experience rather
than in a training period."
His preliminary plans for next year include
activities on two fronts. First, the fifty or so
people who recently signed up to work in his
organization will devote must of their efforts
to research in the fields of education, decision
making, student rights, and housing.
Second, under the heading of special Presi
dential programs, Harris is planning to back
an experimental college "to build in the mi
crocosm what we want in the macrocosm,"
and hopes to sponsor a national conference on
education.
The recent analysis by Katz and Nevitt San
ford of student activism nationally (Saturday
Review, December) has remarkable applica
tion to the situation at Stanford. They say that
the "demand for participation does not stem
from any desire to make college life easier.
Rather it springs from a profound attempt to
seek answers as to how one might achieve
such ends as a reliable personal identity, com
munity with other people, and social objectives
that will bring comfort and justice to those
largely bereft of them in our society."
Level Of Investigation
Their research shows that "the socially in
volved students total not more than 15 per
cent, but the movement can no longer be con
trolled by dealing with the minority alone, be
cause it is expressing the frustrations and as
pirations now shared by the majority of stu
dents."
The current situation represents a unique
opportunity to college administations, they
say. "Administrators who can find some way
to respond to what is human, though some
times chaotically expressed, in these under
graduate students, will find that they are go
ing to be part of a truly revolutionary phase
in the history of education."
"While the eighteenth century discovered
that good government depends upon the con
sent of the governed, our generation has the
opportunity of discovering and bringing to
fruition a system of education that is based
upon the consent of the educated."
On purely pragmatic grounds, encourage
ment of student participation in educational
reform is desirable, because, as one student
commented last spring in reaction to a speech
by President Sterling: "The 'Stanford student
movement'—if indeed, a movement exists as
such—does not represent a rebellious asser
tion of 'student autonomy' but, rather, a con
sidered and concerncd effort to help create a
better, more challenging university for those
students who follow."
There have been several signs since that
time that President Sterling shares much the
same opinion. At a recent alumni conference,
he commented that one strain of student pro
test shows "a genuine interest in the construc
tive task of improving education."
Recognition of the sincerity and construc
tive purpose of many student activists is cer
tainly welcome, but "what they desire most is
the appearance of forceful and self-critical
leadership dedicated to educational reform.
When that leadership becomes visible, stu
dents will at last be able to say that the proc
ess of bringing up father has been completed.


"Klein proposes embellishments on the cur
rent structure; I reject the asumptions on
which the current structure is based."
These words of ASSU President-elect Dave
Harris, spoken during a campaign debate
against Bob Klein, symbolize several years
of student activism at Stanford and serve as
a harbinger of the new direction in which
student activism has begun to turn.
Historically, student concern at Stanford has
been expressed in two broad areas. The first
is a rebellion against the existing conception
of the role of the student. Much of the work
of the past half decade has been to remove
the image of the student as a passive recep
tacle to be treated rather arbitrarily and pa
ternalistically.
But running beneath the surface demands
for respect and participation has been a steady
current asking questions of a much broader
nature, such as what is a university and what
is its relation to society. These questions have
either not been answered or have not been
answered satisfactorily.
It is this dilemma of looking for leadership,
not finding it, and consequently vesting au
thority in themselves that has caused the sec
ond thrust of student activists. If the adminis
ration is incapable or unwilling to articulate
a philosophy of education, some students have
said, we will begin the dialogue alone.
Both strands of the protest—that ag3 ?r,t! t
an anachronistic and degrading set of rules
and the call for discussion of broader educa
tional issues—was summarized two years ago
by one student observer:
"In the minds of many student leaders, arbi
trariness is at once a direct function of an un
necessarily paternal attitude on the part of
the administration and a denial of the essen
tial academic nature of the University."
"Students fear a vacuum—the lack of a co
herent philosophy of education at the top of
the administrative structure. They ask the
question, "Where is the leadership?" and are
forced to conclude it is nowhere if not in them
selves."
Bringing Up Father
Given the essentially paternalistic attitude
of the administration and the students' self
imposed tasi of educating the administration
on what thej feel to be some basic educational
concepts, th history of Stanford in recent
years might be titled "Bringing Up Father."
The significance of the Harris election, com
ing at the same time that most of the battles
over rules and regulations have been won, is
that student energy, and in turn administration
energy, will at last be concentrated on the sec
ond of the two areas of thrust: the attempt to
define and to work toward a new conception of
education.
But before students could begin asking
questions about the nature of their education,
they had to achieve a status in which they
were listened to. Much of the effort of the last
five years has been to gain this position. It
has been manifested as rebellion against the
role assigned to students by the administra
tion.
Basically, what the students have rebelled
against is being treated as immature and
being treated as things. Both flow from an
administrative mentality which student lead
ers think is essentially paternalistic and fre
quently arbitrary.
Paternalism is characterized by over-pro
tectiveness. It is the attitude that "we know
your best interest." Paternalism should at
least be personal, critics say, but it is not
when it is combined with the administrative
mentality which, in the words of one faculty
member "puts a premium on efficiency, and
peace and quiet."
"The person is taken out for the common
good, expediting the educational process,"
another professor points out. This has two
unfortunate consequences. First, something
has gone terribly wrong when people and their
development, those things which should be the
central concern of education, are ignored. But
more importantly, the system is self-perpetu
ating. If one assumes that the system he op
erates functions well and he dismisses critic
ism as being uninformed or as coming from
people too young to understand, the system
is impregnable.
It is for this reason that students have been
turned a deaf ear when they have raised the
broader issues, such as the nature of the uni
versity's relation to society. And, unfortun
ately, these types of questions have arisen as
natural consequences of questioning the sys
tem of dealing with students.
For example, the administrative mentality
that students have criticized" is a sytom of
what some critics term commodity education.
"There is a cultural assumption in Ameri
ca," one observer points out, "that institu
tions of society produce commodities." The
university is an institution and what it pro
duces are trained minds, components for the
assembly line of society.
Dual Responsibility
The broad issue which Stanford has not
faced, critics say, is to bring into balance the
university's dual set of relations to society.
As transmitter of the cultural heritage, the
university is in an accommodating role to soci
ety. It has the responsibility of preparing the
new generation to take control of the institu
tions of society.
But secondly, the university is critic of the
culture being transmitted. In this second role,
it conflicts with society.
The more articulate students feel that Stan
ford has become overbalanced on the side of
accomodation to society. As former ASSU
President Bud Wedin wrote in a recent article
on education at Stanford: "unlike Faustus
who sold his soul to the devil for more honor
able reasons, Stanford has aligned itself with
the biases and norms of the technological
society for want of any soul at all."
Another unfortunate result of the adminis
tration's refusal to listen to students is that
they feel compelled out of frustration to use
forceful tactics.
"They don't understand that what we say
has merit," one student leader states. "And on
the other hand, we don't understand them
because they don't explain their actions to
us." When the gap between students and ad
ministration is as large as it apparently is,
another states, "the situation suggests per
haps some inadequacy to mere discussion."
The administration has learned to listen
over the last half decade to what students
are saying and thus drastic tactics have not
been used. Explanations of this phenomenon

vary, however. The pessimists maintain that
"a lot of the change hasn't been basic attitud
inal change. It was merely strategic change
due to pressure.
The administration has played a holding
game, one adherent of this position main
tains, in the hope that "the activist minority
would graduate and this would all be over."
The significance of the Harris election, this
observer says, is to prove that pressure for
change "is not a temporary aberration caused
by a scapegoat figure."
The other side maintains that there has
been a very definite maturing process on the
part of the administration. One member of
the administration maintains, "we are no
longer over-reacting; we have more confi
dence and a better time perspective."
A slightly cynical student adds: "They know
they just can't do certain things now that
they could a few years ago. The old ploy of
divide and conquer won't work; if a minority

is being isolated and treated unjustly, a sub
stantial segment of the community will rise
in their defense."
In response to continued student demands
for change, some of the most sensitive admin
istrators (there are at least three or four
people over thirty in the administration who
can be trusted) have suggested tactics which
they feel would be the most effective for
students.
The list of one, Associate Undergraauate
Dean Robert Hind, reads as follows: • arm
yourself with facts; • go to the appropriate
person; • be open-minded; • concentrate on
academic improvement rather than peripheral
matters.
Associate Dean of Students Joel Smith sug
gests that "students are paid more attention
on pragmatic questions where they have rele
vant information. Their effect is limited when
they talk about the structure of the univers
ity."
But what Stanford has lacked, the articulate
students feel, is analysis of the structure.
"Without a discussion and an articulation of a
broad concept of education." One retired stu
dent leader states, "Stanford can only have
accretions to the current structure." And the
current structure he and many others regard
as inadequate.
The underlying criticism is a challenge of
the existing conception of authority.
The problem arises from a confusion be
tween education and administration. The uni
versity is an institution of society and thus
has a governing body. But the authority vested
ih it is only for administrative matters.
"The administration and the trustees tend
to think of education as one facet of adminis
tration, rather than vice versa as it should
be," one observer feels.
Another laments that "authority no longer
relates to education." Final authority in the
universiy, this student feels, should be
"truth,"and all other authority gains its
legitimacy in relation to this primary author
ity.
Dialogue Impossible
Fundamental to the search for truth is
"the courage to attack your convictions." At
least some Stanford students have found this
trait lacking in both the administration and the
faculty. This discovery has had at least two
unfortunate results.
First, some students have by default come
to vest authority in their peers because they
feel the faculty and administration have abdi
cated their responsibility to be self-critical.
This results in education being less challeng
ing than it could be if, these students feel,
they could respect the faculty as searching
minds as well as dispensers of knowledge.
But more broadly, a dialogue about the cur
rent structure of the university is not even
possible because of the attitude of the adminis
tration. "Real disagreement is now impos
sible," one student states. "The joint inquiry
we desire requires questioning assumptions.
The administration is as yet unwilling to do
this."
"Something must be done to challenge their
parochial conception of authority. They won't
recognize student authority or any higher
authority. Stanford has neither the courage
nor the capability to question itself funda
mentally because of its parochialism."
Concomitant to the efforts at bringing up
Father has been the effort to "Bring Leland
off the Farm." The last decade has been the
emergence of Stanford from a rather paroch
ial Western institution to a university of na
tional reputation.
The result of the very deliberate efforts to
upgrade the faculty by bringing to Stanford
people from outside has been to make the be
ginnings, at least, of a process of self-criticism.
In the student body, this process was begun
by people like Allard Lowenstein, who was
for a year director of Stem Hall and taught
in the Political Science department.
"A 1 brought wide experience to a parochial
campus," one former administrator states. "He
came to Stanford at a time when there was a
feeling that major changes were needed. He
gave students confidence that change was
worthwhile and that students could make the
difference in bringing change where it had
before appeared impossible."
For several years, many students feel, the
administration used Lowenstein and the stu
dents he met during his year here as the ex
planation of student activism. The name
"Lowenstein" is not heard often anymore at
Stanford and yet students seem more dedi
cated than ever before to pressing for changes.
Much of the thrust of Lowenstein and stu
dents he inspired was to convince students
that they did have a right to be heard and a
right to be treated as adults. In a sense, these
feelings triggered the rebellion against the

old conception of the role of the student, a
rebellion which took form in the demand for
respect.
But this first rebellion was merely the
establishment of the base on which the real
discussion of education could begin. Now that
student leaders have largely completed the
attack on the facade of the current structure,
they are moving towards positing their own
conception of education. This second of the
two thrusts of student activism is summarized
by the term "integration."
First, students demand that their scholarly
and their social criticism be integrated. Many
students find it hypocritical on the part of the
administration to demand of students a critical
attitude and an openness of mind in the class
room but not to expect the same techniques
and commitments to apply outside the class.
"It seems strange," says one close ob
server of the administration, "that we excite
students about social institutions and then
tell them to keep the valve shut until they
leave."
The basic problem, as analyzed by several
of the most astute student critics, is one of
leadership. Ilene Strelitz, Daily editor, wrote
two years ago, in an editorial titled "Where is
Leadership in the University?":
"The criticism levelled at the student is
consistently in the direction of inaction; don't
step beyond the classroom, don't speak out,
and above all don't hold the lectures in the
classroom and the words in the text as rele
vant to the broad issues of controversy facing
your generation.
Students Make Demands
"This is an odd reversal of roles.
"The student should be criticized. The Presi
dent . . . should demand more confrontation
by the student of the responsibility of the edu
cated to the society. His words should be a
constant barrage of criticism for unawareness,
ignorance of 'the world outside', lack of appli
cation of talents, the need for the university
to be the fearless critic and ethical leader.
'It is the role of leadership to criticize and
to demand action, to pose the questions, not to
prohibit them. The students wait for a leader
to raise up before them.
"... The greatest sadness of all will come
if nothing is done, for the President, the deans,
etc. are leaders, no matter how they construe
that role. And it will be sad if the students are
led into passive and uncaring commitments to
stagnation."
There are strong indications that at least
a significant minority are not heading toward
stagnation, but it seems that many are doing
so in spite of, rather than because of any atti
tudes or policies of the administration. And,
in the strangest irony of all, it is the students
who have been demanding that the university
examine its responsibility to society, that the
university be the "formulator not the reflector
of cultural values," that the university define
itself.
But integration of scholarly and social critic
ism is only one of several types of integration
students have called for. The second type is
the integration of thought and action. Here,
students find inspiration in the words of Pro
fessors Otis Pease and Robert McAfee Brown.
Pease speaks of the paradox between curi
osity and commitment. "A great university,"
he says "may choose to do many things, but
the one thing it must do is to generate curios
ity and a sense of commitment among its stu
dents and teachers. And therein lies a para
dox."
"Curiosity is nothing less than the endless
desire to find truth about something; com
mitment involves the desire to act on what
one believes to be truth."
"It is the task of great teaching to create
an environment in which a person may learn
for himself to resolve this paradox, to learn
how he may fuse curiosity and commitment, so
that each, in reinforcing the other, may to
gether give life to his mind where singly they
would destroy it."
Brown emphasizes that "study and direct
concern cannot properly be separated from
one another."
"The notion that student revolt—whether
over Vietnam or social regulations or racial
injustice—is 'interfering with education' is a
notion incompatible with the recognition that
in the life of the truly educated person,
thought and action are indivisible."
"There is involved here a kind of amalgam
of vision, unrest, dissatisfaction, and a desire
to do something about it all. The task of the
university is not to keep a student separated
from the world, but to involve him more re
sponsibly in it."
For many students, the process has been
reversed: they have found through participa
tion in other social institutions that students
can play an active role in bringing change.
This belief, in turn, has been brought back
to the university, where many of these stu
dents find it increasingly unbearable to be
treated like passive containers into which in
formation is to be poured," says Joseph Katz
of the Institute for the Study of Human Prob
lems.
Katz thinks that the change in student con
sciousness is so drastic as to be "a possible
turning point in educational history.. Similar
to the people of the Renaissance and the
French revolution, students today have a new
consciousness: they feel differently about
themselves and about the world."
Gone is the passive acceptance of the exist
ing society and the individual's role in it. "Stu
dents now feel that they can do something
about their situation. Further, if things are
not as they should be, they feel that it is not
all their fault and that part rests in the social
sructure."
A third thrust of student pressure has been
to integrate the student's status outside the
classroom to his status inside. Much of he con
troversy summed up as "the revolt against
rules and regulations" has been based on the
contention that the student is treated differ
ently in his social life than he is in his aca
demic endeavors.
"There is a certain incongurity in demand
ing a critical attitude in class and assuming
that people can not regulate their own lives,"
one student leader states. "Such hypocrisy
ignores or blurs the facts." And again, lead
ership in the university is questioned.
"Because of this abdication, this refusal by
the administration to face problems," the same
student adds, "the task has fallen to the stu
dents."
All he three previously mentioned "integra
tions" have been mere preliminaries to the
final integration: incorporation of students
into the scholarly community.
Two years ago, in his concluding address
as ASSU President, Bud Wedin stated: "We

have taken a great deal of tolerance and un
derstanding from this community and replaced
it with skill and efficiency. Too often we have
regarded the individual as an object and have
seen him only in relation to rules or regula
tions."
"In short, we seem to have lost the vision of
a democratic university in which all share cer
tain rights of participation in matters of com
mon concern, and of freedom of inquiry, as
sociation, and development, and where pa
ternalism is replaced by fellowship in the
company of scholars."
"Perhaps it is time to review some of the
institutions of our society at Stanford to see
if we are really doing our utmost to produce
students with the intellectual maturity, the
self-assurance, and the sense of dignity and
independence so needed in today's society."
The following fall, a group of students and
faculty members formed the Stanford Associa
tion of University Scholars. The purpose of
the group, according to its founder Bob Rosen,
was "to break false dichotomies. Usually the
students and faculty are thought of in opposi
tion to the 'University.' We think that studens
and faculty, because they are the practicing
scholars, are the University. The administra
tion exists to work for the University, to fa
cilitate the pursuit of knowledge."
SAUS faded away, partially out of an inabil
ity to define itself and partially because the
energy of the participants was directed to
other activities. The participants in SAUS,
Rosen explains, were also involved in larger
political movements as well.
The fact that no new SAUS has arisen is
no sign that students are no longer interested
in education. Quite the contrary, Rosen mam
tains: participation in things such as the ASSU
Education Commission is far more broadly
based than concern over educational reform
ever has been.
"There is now a sincere interest in educa
tional reform," Rosen states, "and an orienta
tion toward acting on ideas. Groups will re
emerge on a formal basis with a fuller, strong
er consensus than SAUS ever had."
Just an opinion about rules and regulations
became part of the popular consciousness at
Stanford in the years following the original
questioning of the system, so now educational
reform has now been accepted.
Expect Change
"Whereas two years ago, no one thought
change possible," another says, "we now ex
pect change because we have had change. In
the election of Harris, it was shown for the
first time that on really important issues, stu
dents are willing to act. The administration
has to make sense now."
And here is no doubt that the administration
is trying harder. As one fringe member puts
it,"The administration pays more attention to
students than it likes to admit. And it is slow
to credit them."
But the reciprocal criticism also applies;
students are reluctant to give recognition to

the administration. The big problem in stu
dent-administration relations two years ago
was communication. The emphasis has shifted
somewhat now as each group recognizes that
where it had before assumed differences of
opinion, it can see now because the lines of
communication have been opened that the dif
ferences are real.
The basic problem seems to be one of trust.
If students felt they were a part of a joint
educational endeavor, in which the main cri
teria for decision-making, was as one observer
states "the engagement of the intellect over
a subject as one aspect of the educational
process," an entirely different atmosphere
would prevail.
By the combination of real participation
and openness which would require redress and
public accountability, the atmosphere of sus
picion could be replaced with one in which
all were moving in the same directions.
What students are calling for is a substan
tial say in determining their own education.
They recall that the term "authority" implies
the consent of the governed; otherwise gov
erning is merely the exercise of power.
Few models have been worked out in detail,
but one theme seems to reappear in almost all
discussions: the theme of community. If agree
ment can be reached on the principles of com
munity, any structure would come from the
consensus almost naturally.
The characteristics students have posited
for the community center around the concep
tion of a core of shared values, which would
include above all openness and freedom from
bias.
This attitude must first be employed, some
students feel, in self-analysis. Without funda
mental questioning of the assumptions upon
which the current structure of the University
is based, not even a beginning can be made
toward achieving community.
And before community is achieved, other
attitudes must change. Community involves
1) having an identification with the Univer
sity over and above loyalty to discipline or
constituency and 2) seeing people as individu
als rather than as representatives of consti
tuencies.
These traits seems to be lacking at Stanford
today and the insulting "power bloc" relation
ships make change appear the result of a vic
tory of one bloc over another rather than a
communal achievement.
As long as students are thought of as stu
dents rather than as more intellects being
"engaged over a subject," power blocs and
their consequent tactics will prevail. When stu
dents feel the frustration of their ideas being
ignored simply because of their status, they
often conclude that "Brinksmanship" is the
only way to push Stanford over the edge of
greatness.

Hopefully, the set of relations now pri
ing will be transcended, but one suspects
the structure and its occupants have bee
so identified with each other that m
change is impossible during the current
eration of either students or administrators.
Part of the gap between students and the
administration, which seems too much to
bridge: is the difference in values. In the case
of the current crop of students, the difference
seems to be more than is accountable by any
merely generational gap.
This generation tends to put the emphasis
on operations rather than content as the way
to authenticating a moral system.
"We are more open-minded and less dog
matic," one student explains. "We have a rela
tivistic conception of moral values and believe
that allowing people to develop themselves,
rather than imposing on them a system of
values, is the way to bring a happy society."
But the era of student-administration rela
tions may have come to an end, or at least a
lessening in intensity, for the recent ASSU
campaign was run on educational reform,
which will necessitate more dealing with the
faculty.
Opinion varies as to whether curricular
change will come more easily or with greater
difficulty than have the changes over rules
and regulations.
One administrator feels that "the difficult
changes are the visible ones. Those are now
past. Educational reform can be approached
on honest intellectual grounds, which was not
possible when the battles were being fought
in the public press."
On the other hand, curricular criticism can
often be interpreted as an attack on the pro
fessional autonomy of the professor. And even
more desperately, some students feel that the
refusal to be self-critical applies to the faculty
as well as the administration.
Faculty Paternalism
The administrative mentality causing a com
modity view of education in the administra
tion has pervaded the faculty as well. Pa
ternalism here is reflected in an attitude of
dispensing knowledge to a passive receptacle.
And just as with paternalism in the admin
istration, paternalism in the faculty is hard to
puncture. Some students have found a real
unwillingness on the part of some faculty
members to be honestly evaluative of their
own achievements or to confront students as
authorities in their own right.
A third body of opinion on curricular reform
holds that the administration, not the faculty,
is the key to reform because its conception of
education is the prevailing one.
This group feels that questions about foun
dations must be asked of a structure which
emphasizes passive receptivity. Regurgitation
of knowledge as a basis of determining level
of education seems to some students to reflect
Stanford's overbalance on the side of accomo
dating society.
Dave Harris based his campaign upon dis
satisfaction with the existing structure and he
analyzes his election as "an expression of stu
dent discontent, a broad emotional statement
of dissatisfaction with the type of education
given here and the student's role in it."
Education at Stanford, he says, is viewed as
"indoctrination, not participation. The student
is treated as a second-class citizen in the com
munity; his life is fragmented."
He would like to see students participating
in an "integrative four-year experience rather
than in a training period."
His preliminary plans for next year include
activities on two fronts. First, the fifty or so
people who recently signed up to work in his
organization will devote must of their efforts
to research in the fields of education, decision
making, student rights, and housing.
Second, under the heading of special Presi
dential programs, Harris is planning to back
an experimental college "to build in the mi
crocosm what we want in the macrocosm,"
and hopes to sponsor a national conference on
education.
The recent analysis by Katz and Nevitt San
ford of student activism nationally (Saturday
Review, December) has remarkable applica
tion to the situation at Stanford. They say that
the "demand for participation does not stem
from any desire to make college life easier.
Rather it springs from a profound attempt to
seek answers as to how one might achieve
such ends as a reliable personal identity, com
munity with other people, and social objectives
that will bring comfort and justice to those
largely bereft of them in our society."
Level Of Investigation
Their research shows that "the socially in
volved students total not more than 15 per
cent, but the movement can no longer be con
trolled by dealing with the minority alone, be
cause it is expressing the frustrations and as
pirations now shared by the majority of stu
dents."
The current situation represents a unique
opportunity to college administations, they
say. "Administrators who can find some way
to respond to what is human, though some
times chaotically expressed, in these under
graduate students, will find that they are go
ing to be part of a truly revolutionary phase
in the history of education."
"While the eighteenth century discovered
that good government depends upon the con
sent of the governed, our generation has the
opportunity of discovering and bringing to
fruition a system of education that is based
upon the consent of the educated."
On purely pragmatic grounds, encourage
ment of student participation in educational
reform is desirable, because, as one student
commented last spring in reaction to a speech
by President Sterling: "The 'Stanford student
movement'—if indeed, a movement exists as
such—does not represent a rebellious asser
tion of 'student autonomy' but, rather, a con
sidered and concerncd effort to help create a
better, more challenging university for those
students who follow."
There have been several signs since that
time that President Sterling shares much the
same opinion. At a recent alumni conference,
he commented that one strain of student pro
test shows "a genuine interest in the construc
tive task of improving education."
Recognition of the sincerity and construc
tive purpose of many student activists is cer
tainly welcome, but "what they desire most is
the appearance of forceful and self-critical
leadership dedicated to educational reform.
When that leadership becomes visible, stu
dents will at last be able to say that the proc
ess of bringing up father has been completed.


"Klein proposes embellishments on the cur
rent structure; I reject the asumptions on
which the current structure is based."
These words of ASSU President-elect Dave
Harris, spoken during a campaign debate
against Bob Klein, symbolize several years
of student activism at Stanford and serve as
a harbinger of the new direction in which
student activism has begun to turn.
Historically, student concern at Stanford has
been expressed in two broad areas. The first
is a rebellion against the existing conception
of the role of the student. Much of the work
of the past half decade has been to remove
the image of the student as a passive recep
tacle to be treated rather arbitrarily and pa
ternalistically.
But running beneath the surface demands
for respect and participation has been a steady
current asking questions of a much broader
nature, such as what is a university and what
is its relation to society. These questions have
either not been answered or have not been
answered satisfactorily.
It is this dilemma of looking for leadership,
not finding it, and consequently vesting au
thority in themselves that has caused the sec
ond thrust of student activists. If the adminis
ration is incapable or unwilling to articulate
a philosophy of education, some students have
said, we will begin the dialogue alone.
Both strands of the protest—that ag3 ?r,t! t
an anachronistic and degrading set of rules
and the call for discussion of broader educa
tional issues—was summarized two years ago
by one student observer:
"In the minds of many student leaders, arbi
trariness is at once a direct function of an un
necessarily paternal attitude on the part of
the administration and a denial of the essen
tial academic nature of the University."
"Students fear a vacuum—the lack of a co
herent philosophy of education at the top of
the administrative structure. They ask the
question, "Where is the leadership?" and are
forced to conclude it is nowhere if not in them
selves."
Bringing Up Father
Given the essentially paternalistic attitude
of the administration and the students' self
imposed tasi of educating the administration
on what thej feel to be some basic educational
concepts, th history of Stanford in recent
years might be titled "Bringing Up Father."
The significance of the Harris election, com
ing at the same time that most of the battles
over rules and regulations have been won, is
that student energy, and in turn administration
energy, will at last be concentrated on the sec
ond of the two areas of thrust: the attempt to
define and to work toward a new conception of
education.
But before students could begin asking
questions about the nature of their education,
they had to achieve a status in which they
were listened to. Much of the effort of the last
five years has been to gain this position. It
has been manifested as rebellion against the
role assigned to students by the administra
tion.
Basically, what the students have rebelled
against is being treated as immature and
being treated as things. Both flow from an
administrative mentality which student lead
ers think is essentially paternalistic and fre
quently arbitrary.
Paternalism is characterized by over-pro
tectiveness. It is the attitude that "we know
your best interest." Paternalism should at
least be personal, critics say, but it is not
when it is combined with the administrative
mentality which, in the words of one faculty
member "puts a premium on efficiency, and
peace and quiet."
"The person is taken out for the common
good, expediting the educational process,"
another professor points out. This has two
unfortunate consequences. First, something
has gone terribly wrong when people and their
development, those things which should be the
central concern of education, are ignored. But
more importantly, the system is self-perpetu
ating. If one assumes that the system he op
erates functions well and he dismisses critic
ism as being uninformed or as coming from
people too young to understand, the system
is impregnable.
It is for this reason that students have been
turned a deaf ear when they have raised the
broader issues, such as the nature of the uni
versity's relation to society. And, unfortun
ately, these types of questions have arisen as
natural consequences of questioning the sys
tem of dealing with students.
For example, the administrative mentality
that students have criticized" is a sytom of
what some critics term commodity education.
"There is a cultural assumption in Ameri
ca," one observer points out, "that institu
tions of society produce commodities." The
university is an institution and what it pro
duces are trained minds, components for the
assembly line of society.
Dual Responsibility
The broad issue which Stanford has not
faced, critics say, is to bring into balance the
university's dual set of relations to society.
As transmitter of the cultural heritage, the
university is in an accommodating role to soci
ety. It has the responsibility of preparing the
new generation to take control of the institu
tions of society.
But secondly, the university is critic of the
culture being transmitted. In this second role,
it conflicts with society.
The more articulate students feel that Stan
ford has become overbalanced on the side of
accomodation to society. As former ASSU
President Bud Wedin wrote in a recent article
on education at Stanford: "unlike Faustus
who sold his soul to the devil for more honor
able reasons, Stanford has aligned itself with
the biases and norms of the technological
society for want of any soul at all."
Another unfortunate result of the adminis
tration's refusal to listen to students is that
they feel compelled out of frustration to use
forceful tactics.
"They don't understand that what we say
has merit," one student leader states. "And on
the other hand, we don't understand them
because they don't explain their actions to
us." When the gap between students and ad
ministration is as large as it apparently is,
another states, "the situation suggests per
haps some inadequacy to mere discussion."
The administration has learned to listen
over the last half decade to what students
are saying and thus drastic tactics have not
been used. Explanations of this phenomenon

vary, however. The pessimists maintain that
"a lot of the change hasn't been basic attitud
inal change. It was merely strategic change
due to pressure.
The administration has played a holding
game, one adherent of this position main
tains, in the hope that "the activist minority
would graduate and this would all be over."
The significance of the Harris election, this
observer says, is to prove that pressure for
change "is not a temporary aberration caused
by a scapegoat figure."
The other side maintains that there has
been a very definite maturing process on the
part of the administration. One member of
the administration maintains, "we are no
longer over-reacting; we have more confi
dence and a better time perspective."
A slightly cynical student adds: "They know
they just can't do certain things now that
they could a few years ago. The old ploy of
divide and conquer won't work; if a minority

is being isolated and treated unjustly, a sub
stantial segment of the community will rise
in their defense."
In response to continued student demands
for change, some of the most sensitive admin
istrators (there are at least three or four
people over thirty in the administration who
can be trusted) have suggested tactics which
they feel would be the most effective for
students.
The list of one, Associate Undergraauate
Dean Robert Hind, reads as follows: • arm
yourself with facts; • go to the appropriate
person; • be open-minded; • concentrate on
academic improvement rather than peripheral
matters.
Associate Dean of Students Joel Smith sug
gests that "students are paid more attention
on pragmatic questions where they have rele
vant information. Their effect is limited when
they talk about the structure of the univers
ity."
But what Stanford has lacked, the articulate
students feel, is analysis of the structure.
"Without a discussion and an articulation of a
broad concept of education." One retired stu
dent leader states, "Stanford can only have
accretions to the current structure." And the
current structure he and many others regard
as inadequate.
The underlying criticism is a challenge of
the existing conception of authority.
The problem arises from a confusion be
tween education and administration. The uni
versity is an institution of society and thus
has a governing body. But the authority vested
ih it is only for administrative matters.
"The administration and the trustees tend
to think of education as one facet of adminis
tration, rather than vice versa as it should
be," one observer feels.
Another laments that "authority no longer
relates to education." Final authority in the
universiy, this student feels, should be
"truth,"and all other authority gains its
legitimacy in relation to this primary author
ity.
Dialogue Impossible
Fundamental to the search for truth is
"the courage to attack your convictions." At
least some Stanford students have found this
trait lacking in both the administration and the
faculty. This discovery has had at least two
unfortunate results.
First, some students have by default come
to vest authority in their peers because they
feel the faculty and administration have abdi
cated their responsibility to be self-critical.
This results in education being less challeng
ing than it could be if, these students feel,
they could respect the faculty as searching
minds as well as dispensers of knowledge.
But more broadly, a dialogue about the cur
rent structure of the university is not even
possible because of the attitude of the adminis
tration. "Real disagreement is now impos
sible," one student states. "The joint inquiry
we desire requires questioning assumptions.
The administration is as yet unwilling to do
this."
"Something must be done to challenge their
parochial conception of authority. They won't
recognize student authority or any higher
authority. Stanford has neither the courage
nor the capability to question itself funda
mentally because of its parochialism."
Concomitant to the efforts at bringing up
Father has been the effort to "Bring Leland
off the Farm." The last decade has been the
emergence of Stanford from a rather paroch
ial Western institution to a university of na
tional reputation.
The result of the very deliberate efforts to
upgrade the faculty by bringing to Stanford
people from outside has been to make the be
ginnings, at least, of a process of self-criticism.
In the student body, this process was begun
by people like Allard Lowenstein, who was
for a year director of Stem Hall and taught
in the Political Science department.
"A 1 brought wide experience to a parochial
campus," one former administrator states. "He
came to Stanford at a time when there was a
feeling that major changes were needed. He
gave students confidence that change was
worthwhile and that students could make the
difference in bringing change where it had
before appeared impossible."
For several years, many students feel, the
administration used Lowenstein and the stu
dents he met during his year here as the ex
planation of student activism. The name
"Lowenstein" is not heard often anymore at
Stanford and yet students seem more dedi
cated than ever before to pressing for changes.
Much of the thrust of Lowenstein and stu
dents he inspired was to convince students
that they did have a right to be heard and a
right to be treated as adults. In a sense, these
feelings triggered the rebellion against the

old conception of the role of the student, a
rebellion which took form in the demand for
respect.
But this first rebellion was merely the
establishment of the base on which the real
discussion of education could begin. Now that
student leaders have largely completed the
attack on the facade of the current structure,
they are moving towards positing their own
conception of education. This second of the
two thrusts of student activism is summarized
by the term "integration."
First, students demand that their scholarly
and their social criticism be integrated. Many
students find it hypocritical on the part of the
administration to demand of students a critical
attitude and an openness of mind in the class
room but not to expect the same techniques
and commitments to apply outside the class.
"It seems strange," says one close ob
server of the administration, "that we excite
students about social institutions and then
tell them to keep the valve shut until they
leave."
The basic problem, as analyzed by several
of the most astute student critics, is one of
leadership. Ilene Strelitz, Daily editor, wrote
two years ago, in an editorial titled "Where is
Leadership in the University?":
"The criticism levelled at the student is
consistently in the direction of inaction; don't
step beyond the classroom, don't speak out,
and above all don't hold the lectures in the
classroom and the words in the text as rele
vant to the broad issues of controversy facing
your generation.
Students Make Demands
"This is an odd reversal of roles.
"The student should be criticized. The Presi
dent . . . should demand more confrontation
by the student of the responsibility of the edu
cated to the society. His words should be a
constant barrage of criticism for unawareness,
ignorance of 'the world outside', lack of appli
cation of talents, the need for the university
to be the fearless critic and ethical leader.
'It is the role of leadership to criticize and
to demand action, to pose the questions, not to
prohibit them. The students wait for a leader
to raise up before them.
"... The greatest sadness of all will come
if nothing is done, for the President, the deans,
etc. are leaders, no matter how they construe
that role. And it will be sad if the students are
led into passive and uncaring commitments to
stagnation."
There are strong indications that at least
a significant minority are not heading toward
stagnation, but it seems that many are doing
so in spite of, rather than because of any atti
tudes or policies of the administration. And,
in the strangest irony of all, it is the students
who have been demanding that the university
examine its responsibility to society, that the
university be the "formulator not the reflector
of cultural values," that the university define
itself.
But integration of scholarly and social critic
ism is only one of several types of integration
students have called for. The second type is
the integration of thought and action. Here,
students find inspiration in the words of Pro
fessors Otis Pease and Robert McAfee Brown.
Pease speaks of the paradox between curi
osity and commitment. "A great university,"
he says "may choose to do many things, but
the one thing it must do is to generate curios
ity and a sense of commitment among its stu
dents and teachers. And therein lies a para
dox."
"Curiosity is nothing less than the endless
desire to find truth about something; com
mitment involves the desire to act on what
one believes to be truth."
"It is the task of great teaching to create
an environment in which a person may learn
for himself to resolve this paradox, to learn
how he may fuse curiosity and commitment, so
that each, in reinforcing the other, may to
gether give life to his mind where singly they
would destroy it."
Brown emphasizes that "study and direct
concern cannot properly be separated from
one another."
"The notion that student revolt—whether
over Vietnam or social regulations or racial
injustice—is 'interfering with education' is a
notion incompatible with the recognition that
in the life of the truly educated person,
thought and action are indivisible."
"There is involved here a kind of amalgam
of vision, unrest, dissatisfaction, and a desire
to do something about it all. The task of the
university is not to keep a student separated
from the world, but to involve him more re
sponsibly in it."
For many students, the process has been
reversed: they have found through participa
tion in other social institutions that students
can play an active role in bringing change.
This belief, in turn, has been brought back
to the university, where many of these stu
dents find it increasingly unbearable to be
treated like passive containers into which in
formation is to be poured," says Joseph Katz
of the Institute for the Study of Human Prob
lems.
Katz thinks that the change in student con
sciousness is so drastic as to be "a possible
turning point in educational history.. Similar
to the people of the Renaissance and the
French revolution, students today have a new
consciousness: they feel differently about
themselves and about the world."
Gone is the passive acceptance of the exist
ing society and the individual's role in it. "Stu
dents now feel that they can do something
about their situation. Further, if things are
not as they should be, they feel that it is not
all their fault and that part rests in the social
sructure."
A third thrust of student pressure has been
to integrate the student's status outside the
classroom to his status inside. Much of he con
troversy summed up as "the revolt against
rules and regulations" has been based on the
contention that the student is treated differ
ently in his social life than he is in his aca
demic endeavors.
"There is a certain incongurity in demand
ing a critical attitude in class and assuming
that people can not regulate their own lives,"
one student leader states. "Such hypocrisy
ignores or blurs the facts." And again, lead
ership in the university is questioned.
"Because of this abdication, this refusal by
the administration to face problems," the same
student adds, "the task has fallen to the stu
dents."
All he three previously mentioned "integra
tions" have been mere preliminaries to the
final integration: incorporation of students
into the scholarly community.
Two years ago, in his concluding address
as ASSU President, Bud Wedin stated: "We

have taken a great deal of tolerance and un
derstanding from this community and replaced
it with skill and efficiency. Too often we have
regarded the individual as an object and have
seen him only in relation to rules or regula
tions."
"In short, we seem to have lost the vision of
a democratic university in which all share cer
tain rights of participation in matters of com
mon concern, and of freedom of inquiry, as
sociation, and development, and where pa
ternalism is replaced by fellowship in the
company of scholars."
"Perhaps it is time to review some of the
institutions of our society at Stanford to see
if we are really doing our utmost to produce
students with the intellectual maturity, the
self-assurance, and the sense of dignity and
independence so needed in today's society."
The following fall, a group of students and
faculty members formed the Stanford Associa
tion of University Scholars. The purpose of
the group, according to its founder Bob Rosen,
was "to break false dichotomies. Usually the
students and faculty are thought of in opposi
tion to the 'University.' We think that studens
and faculty, because they are the practicing
scholars, are the University. The administra
tion exists to work for the University, to fa
cilitate the pursuit of knowledge."
SAUS faded away, partially out of an inabil
ity to define itself and partially because the
energy of the participants was directed to
other activities. The participants in SAUS,
Rosen explains, were also involved in larger
political movements as well.
The fact that no new SAUS has arisen is
no sign that students are no longer interested
in education. Quite the contrary, Rosen mam
tains: participation in things such as the ASSU
Education Commission is far more broadly
based than concern over educational reform
ever has been.
"There is now a sincere interest in educa
tional reform," Rosen states, "and an orienta
tion toward acting on ideas. Groups will re
emerge on a formal basis with a fuller, strong
er consensus than SAUS ever had."
Just an opinion about rules and regulations
became part of the popular consciousness at
Stanford in the years following the original
questioning of the system, so now educational
reform has now been accepted.
Expect Change
"Whereas two years ago, no one thought
change possible," another says, "we now ex
pect change because we have had change. In
the election of Harris, it was shown for the
first time that on really important issues, stu
dents are willing to act. The administration
has to make sense now."
And here is no doubt that the administration
is trying harder. As one fringe member puts
it,"The administration pays more attention to
students than it likes to admit. And it is slow
to credit them."
But the reciprocal criticism also applies;
students are reluctant to give recognition to

the administration. The big problem in stu
dent-administration relations two years ago
was communication. The emphasis has shifted
somewhat now as each group recognizes that
where it had before assumed differences of
opinion, it can see now because the lines of
communication have been opened that the dif
ferences are real.
The basic problem seems to be one of trust.
If students felt they were a part of a joint
educational endeavor, in which the main cri
teria for decision-making, was as one observer
states "the engagement of the intellect over
a subject as one aspect of the educational
process," an entirely different atmosphere
would prevail.
By the combination of real participation
and openness which would require redress and
public accountability, the atmosphere of sus
picion could be replaced with one in which
all were moving in the same directions.
What students are calling for is a substan
tial say in determining their own education.
They recall that the term "authority" implies
the consent of the governed; otherwise gov
erning is merely the exercise of power.
Few models have been worked out in detail,
but one theme seems to reappear in almost all
discussions: the theme of community. If agree
ment can be reached on the principles of com
munity, any structure would come from the
consensus almost naturally.
The characteristics students have posited
for the community center around the concep
tion of a core of shared values, which would
include above all openness and freedom from
bias.
This attitude must first be employed, some
students feel, in self-analysis. Without funda
mental questioning of the assumptions upon
which the current structure of the University
is based, not even a beginning can be made
toward achieving community.
And before community is achieved, other
attitudes must change. Community involves
1) having an identification with the Univer
sity over and above loyalty to discipline or
constituency and 2) seeing people as individu
als rather than as representatives of consti
tuencies.
These traits seems to be lacking at Stanford
today and the insulting "power bloc" relation
ships make change appear the result of a vic
tory of one bloc over another rather than a
communal achievement.
As long as students are thought of as stu
dents rather than as more intellects being
"engaged over a subject," power blocs and
their consequent tactics will prevail. When stu
dents feel the frustration of their ideas being
ignored simply because of their status, they
often conclude that "Brinksmanship" is the
only way to push Stanford over the edge of
greatness.

Hopefully, the set of relations now pri
ing will be transcended, but one suspects
the structure and its occupants have bee
so identified with each other that m
change is impossible during the current
eration of either students or administrators.
Part of the gap between students and the
administration, which seems too much to
bridge: is the difference in values. In the case
of the current crop of students, the difference
seems to be more than is accountable by any
merely generational gap.
This generation tends to put the emphasis
on operations rather than content as the way
to authenticating a moral system.
"We are more open-minded and less dog
matic," one student explains. "We have a rela
tivistic conception of moral values and believe
that allowing people to develop themselves,
rather than imposing on them a system of
values, is the way to bring a happy society."
But the era of student-administration rela
tions may have come to an end, or at least a
lessening in intensity, for the recent ASSU
campaign was run on educational reform,
which will necessitate more dealing with the
faculty.
Opinion varies as to whether curricular
change will come more easily or with greater
difficulty than have the changes over rules
and regulations.
One administrator feels that "the difficult
changes are the visible ones. Those are now
past. Educational reform can be approached
on honest intellectual grounds, which was not
possible when the battles were being fought
in the public press."
On the other hand, curricular criticism can
often be interpreted as an attack on the pro
fessional autonomy of the professor. And even
more desperately, some students feel that the
refusal to be self-critical applies to the faculty
as well as the administration.
Faculty Paternalism
The administrative mentality causing a com
modity view of education in the administra
tion has pervaded the faculty as well. Pa
ternalism here is reflected in an attitude of
dispensing knowledge to a passive receptacle.
And just as with paternalism in the admin
istration, paternalism in the faculty is hard to
puncture. Some students have found a real
unwillingness on the part of some faculty
members to be honestly evaluative of their
own achievements or to confront students as
authorities in their own right.
A third body of opinion on curricular reform
holds that the administration, not the faculty,
is the key to reform because its conception of
education is the prevailing one.
This group feels that questions about foun
dations must be asked of a structure which
emphasizes passive receptivity. Regurgitation
of knowledge as a basis of determining level
of education seems to some students to reflect
Stanford's overbalance on the side of accomo
dating society.
Dave Harris based his campaign upon dis
satisfaction with the existing structure and he
analyzes his election as "an expression of stu
dent discontent, a broad emotional statement
of dissatisfaction with the type of education
given here and the student's role in it."
Education at Stanford, he says, is viewed as
"indoctrination, not participation. The student
is treated as a second-class citizen in the com
munity; his life is fragmented."
He would like to see students participating
in an "integrative four-year experience rather
than in a training period."
His preliminary plans for next year include
activities on two fronts. First, the fifty or so
people who recently signed up to work in his
organization will devote must of their efforts
to research in the fields of education, decision
making, student rights, and housing.
Second, under the heading of special Presi
dential programs, Harris is planning to back
an experimental college "to build in the mi
crocosm what we want in the macrocosm,"
and hopes to sponsor a national conference on
education.
The recent analysis by Katz and Nevitt San
ford of student activism nationally (Saturday
Review, December) has remarkable applica
tion to the situation at Stanford. They say that
the "demand for participation does not stem
from any desire to make college life easier.
Rather it springs from a profound attempt to
seek answers as to how one might achieve
such ends as a reliable personal identity, com
munity with other people, and social objectives
that will bring comfort and justice to those
largely bereft of them in our society."
Level Of Investigation
Their research shows that "the socially in
volved students total not more than 15 per
cent, but the movement can no longer be con
trolled by dealing with the minority alone, be
cause it is expressing the frustrations and as
pirations now shared by the majority of stu
dents."
The current situation represents a unique
opportunity to college administations, they
say. "Administrators who can find some way
to respond to what is human, though some
times chaotically expressed, in these under
graduate students, will find that they are go
ing to be part of a truly revolutionary phase
in the history of education."
"While the eighteenth century discovered
that good government depends upon the con
sent of the governed, our generation has the
opportunity of discovering and bringing to
fruition a system of education that is based
upon the consent of the educated."
On purely pragmatic grounds, encourage
ment of student participation in educational
reform is desirable, because, as one student
commented last spring in reaction to a speech
by President Sterling: "The 'Stanford student
movement'—if indeed, a movement exists as
such—does not represent a rebellious asser
tion of 'student autonomy' but, rather, a con
sidered and concerncd effort to help create a
better, more challenging university for those
students who follow."
There have been several signs since that
time that President Sterling shares much the
same opinion. At a recent alumni conference,
he commented that one strain of student pro
test shows "a genuine interest in the construc
tive task of improving education."
Recognition of the sincerity and construc
tive purpose of many student activists is cer
tainly welcome, but "what they desire most is
the appearance of forceful and self-critical
leadership dedicated to educational reform.
When that leadership becomes visible, stu
dents will at last be able to say that the proc
ess of bringing up father has been completed.


"Klein proposes embellishments on the cur
rent structure; I reject the asumptions on
which the current structure is based."
These words of ASSU President-elect Dave
Harris, spoken during a campaign debate
against Bob Klein, symbolize several years
of student activism at Stanford and serve as
a harbinger of the new direction in which
student activism has begun to turn.
Historically, student concern at Stanford has
been expressed in two broad areas. The first
is a rebellion against the existing conception
of the role of the student. Much of the work
of the past half decade has been to remove
the image of the student as a passive recep
tacle to be treated rather arbitrarily and pa
ternalistically.
But running beneath the surface demands
for respect and participation has been a steady
current asking questions of a much broader
nature, such as what is a university and what
is its relation to society. These questions have
either not been answered or have not been
answered satisfactorily.
It is this dilemma of looking for leadership,
not finding it, and consequently vesting au
thority in themselves that has caused the sec
ond thrust of student activists. If the adminis
ration is incapable or unwilling to articulate
a philosophy of education, some students have
said, we will begin the dialogue alone.
Both strands of the protest—that ag3 ?r,t! t
an anachronistic and degrading set of rules
and the call for discussion of broader educa
tional issues—was summarized two years ago
by one student observer:
"In the minds of many student leaders, arbi
trariness is at once a direct function of an un
necessarily paternal attitude on the part of
the administration and a denial of the essen
tial academic nature of the University."
"Students fear a vacuum—the lack of a co
herent philosophy of education at the top of
the administrative structure. They ask the
question, "Where is the leadership?" and are
forced to conclude it is nowhere if not in them
selves."
Bringing Up Father
Given the essentially paternalistic attitude
of the administration and the students' self
imposed tasi of educating the administration
on what thej feel to be some basic educational
concepts, th history of Stanford in recent
years might be titled "Bringing Up Father."
The significance of the Harris election, com
ing at the same time that most of the battles
over rules and regulations have been won, is
that student energy, and in turn administration
energy, will at last be concentrated on the sec
ond of the two areas of thrust: the attempt to
define and to work toward a new conception of
education.
But before students could begin asking
questions about the nature of their education,
they had to achieve a status in which they
were listened to. Much of the effort of the last
five years has been to gain this position. It
has been manifested as rebellion against the
role assigned to students by the administra
tion.
Basically, what the students have rebelled
against is being treated as immature and
being treated as things. Both flow from an
administrative mentality which student lead
ers think is essentially paternalistic and fre
quently arbitrary.
Paternalism is characterized by over-pro
tectiveness. It is the attitude that "we know
your best interest." Paternalism should at
least be personal, critics say, but it is not
when it is combined with the administrative
mentality which, in the words of one faculty
member "puts a premium on efficiency, and
peace and quiet."
"The person is taken out for the common
good, expediting the educational process,"
another professor points out. This has two
unfortunate consequences. First, something
has gone terribly wrong when people and their
development, those things which should be the
central concern of education, are ignored. But
more importantly, the system is self-perpetu
ating. If one assumes that the system he op
erates functions well and he dismisses critic
ism as being uninformed or as coming from
people too young to understand, the system
is impregnable.
It is for this reason that students have been
turned a deaf ear when they have raised the
broader issues, such as the nature of the uni
versity's relation to society. And, unfortun
ately, these types of questions have arisen as
natural consequences of questioning the sys
tem of dealing with students.
For example, the administrative mentality
that students have criticized" is a sytom of
what some critics term commodity education.
"There is a cultural assumption in Ameri
ca," one observer points out, "that institu
tions of society produce commodities." The
university is an institution and what it pro
duces are trained minds, components for the
assembly line of society.
Dual Responsibility
The broad issue which Stanford has not
faced, critics say, is to bring into balance the
university's dual set of relations to society.
As transmitter of the cultural heritage, the
university is in an accommodating role to soci
ety. It has the responsibility of preparing the
new generation to take control of the institu
tions of society.
But secondly, the university is critic of the
culture being transmitted. In this second role,
it conflicts with society.
The more articulate students feel that Stan
ford has become overbalanced on the side of
accomodation to society. As former ASSU
President Bud Wedin wrote in a recent article
on education at Stanford: "unlike Faustus
who sold his soul to the devil for more honor
able reasons, Stanford has aligned itself with
the biases and norms of the technological
society for want of any soul at all."
Another unfortunate result of the adminis
tration's refusal to listen to students is that
they feel compelled out of frustration to use
forceful tactics.
"They don't understand that what we say
has merit," one student leader states. "And on
the other hand, we don't understand them
because they don't explain their actions to
us." When the gap between students and ad
ministration is as large as it apparently is,
another states, "the situation suggests per
haps some inadequacy to mere discussion."
The administration has learned to listen
over the last half decade to what students
are saying and thus drastic tactics have not
been used. Explanations of this phenomenon

vary, however. The pessimists maintain that
"a lot of the change hasn't been basic attitud
inal change. It was merely strategic change
due to pressure.
The administration has played a holding
game, one adherent of this position main
tains, in the hope that "the activist minority
would graduate and this would all be over."
The significance of the Harris election, this
observer says, is to prove that pressure for
change "is not a temporary aberration caused
by a scapegoat figure."
The other side maintains that there has
been a very definite maturing process on the
part of the administration. One member of
the administration maintains, "we are no
longer over-reacting; we have more confi
dence and a better time perspective."
A slightly cynical student adds: "They know
they just can't do certain things now that
they could a few years ago. The old ploy of
divide and conquer won't work; if a minority

is being isolated and treated unjustly, a sub
stantial segment of the community will rise
in their defense."
In response to continued student demands
for change, some of the most sensitive admin
istrators (there are at least three or four
people over thirty in the administration who
can be trusted) have suggested tactics which
they feel would be the most effective for
students.
The list of one, Associate Undergraauate
Dean Robert Hind, reads as follows: • arm
yourself with facts; • go to the appropriate
person; • be open-minded; • concentrate on
academic improvement rather than peripheral
matters.
Associate Dean of Students Joel Smith sug
gests that "students are paid more attention
on pragmatic questions where they have rele
vant information. Their effect is limited when
they talk about the structure of the univers
ity."
But what Stanford has lacked, the articulate
students feel, is analysis of the structure.
"Without a discussion and an articulation of a
broad concept of education." One retired stu
dent leader states, "Stanford can only have
accretions to the current structure." And the
current structure he and many others regard
as inadequate.
The underlying criticism is a challenge of
the existing conception of authority.
The problem arises from a confusion be
tween education and administration. The uni
versity is an institution of society and thus
has a governing body. But the authority vested
ih it is only for administrative matters.
"The administration and the trustees tend
to think of education as one facet of adminis
tration, rather than vice versa as it should
be," one observer feels.
Another laments that "authority no longer
relates to education." Final authority in the
universiy, this student feels, should be
"truth,"and all other authority gains its
legitimacy in relation to this primary author
ity.
Dialogue Impossible
Fundamental to the search for truth is
"the courage to attack your convictions." At
least some Stanford students have found this
trait lacking in both the administration and the
faculty. This discovery has had at least two
unfortunate results.
First, some students have by default come
to vest authority in their peers because they
feel the faculty and administration have abdi
cated their responsibility to be self-critical.
This results in education being less challeng
ing than it could be if, these students feel,
they could respect the faculty as searching
minds as well as dispensers of knowledge.
But more broadly, a dialogue about the cur
rent structure of the university is not even
possible because of the attitude of the adminis
tration. "Real disagreement is now impos
sible," one student states. "The joint inquiry
we desire requires questioning assumptions.
The administration is as yet unwilling to do
this."
"Something must be done to challenge their
parochial conception of authority. They won't
recognize student authority or any higher
authority. Stanford has neither the courage
nor the capability to question itself funda
mentally because of its parochialism."
Concomitant to the efforts at bringing up
Father has been the effort to "Bring Leland
off the Farm." The last decade has been the
emergence of Stanford from a rather paroch
ial Western institution to a university of na
tional reputation.
The result of the very deliberate efforts to
upgrade the faculty by bringing to Stanford
people from outside has been to make the be
ginnings, at least, of a process of self-criticism.
In the student body, this process was begun
by people like Allard Lowenstein, who was
for a year director of Stem Hall and taught
in the Political Science department.
"A 1 brought wide experience to a parochial
campus," one former administrator states. "He
came to Stanford at a time when there was a
feeling that major changes were needed. He
gave students confidence that change was
worthwhile and that students could make the
difference in bringing change where it had
before appeared impossible."
For several years, many students feel, the
administration used Lowenstein and the stu
dents he met during his year here as the ex
planation of student activism. The name
"Lowenstein" is not heard often anymore at
Stanford and yet students seem more dedi
cated than ever before to pressing for changes.
Much of the thrust of Lowenstein and stu
dents he inspired was to convince students
that they did have a right to be heard and a
right to be treated as adults. In a sense, these
feelings triggered the rebellion against the

old conception of the role of the student, a
rebellion which took form in the demand for
respect.
But this first rebellion was merely the
establishment of the base on which the real
discussion of education could begin. Now that
student leaders have largely completed the
attack on the facade of the current structure,
they are moving towards positing their own
conception of education. This second of the
two thrusts of student activism is summarized
by the term "integration."
First, students demand that their scholarly
and their social criticism be integrated. Many
students find it hypocritical on the part of the
administration to demand of students a critical
attitude and an openness of mind in the class
room but not to expect the same techniques
and commitments to apply outside the class.
"It seems strange," says one close ob
server of the administration, "that we excite
students about social institutions and then
tell them to keep the valve shut until they
leave."
The basic problem, as analyzed by several
of the most astute student critics, is one of
leadership. Ilene Strelitz, Daily editor, wrote
two years ago, in an editorial titled "Where is
Leadership in the University?":
"The criticism levelled at the student is
consistently in the direction of inaction; don't
step beyond the classroom, don't speak out,
and above all don't hold the lectures in the
classroom and the words in the text as rele
vant to the broad issues of controversy facing
your generation.
Students Make Demands
"This is an odd reversal of roles.
"The student should be criticized. The Presi
dent . . . should demand more confrontation
by the student of the responsibility of the edu
cated to the society. His words should be a
constant barrage of criticism for unawareness,
ignorance of 'the world outside', lack of appli
cation of talents, the need for the university
to be the fearless critic and ethical leader.
'It is the role of leadership to criticize and
to demand action, to pose the questions, not to
prohibit them. The students wait for a leader
to raise up before them.
"... The greatest sadness of all will come
if nothing is done, for the President, the deans,
etc. are leaders, no matter how they construe
that role. And it will be sad if the students are
led into passive and uncaring commitments to
stagnation."
There are strong indications that at least
a significant minority are not heading toward
stagnation, but it seems that many are doing
so in spite of, rather than because of any atti
tudes or policies of the administration. And,
in the strangest irony of all, it is the students
who have been demanding that the university
examine its responsibility to society, that the
university be the "formulator not the reflector
of cultural values," that the university define
itself.
But integration of scholarly and social critic
ism is only one of several types of integration
students have called for. The second type is
the integration of thought and action. Here,
students find inspiration in the words of Pro
fessors Otis Pease and Robert McAfee Brown.
Pease speaks of the paradox between curi
osity and commitment. "A great university,"
he says "may choose to do many things, but
the one thing it must do is to generate curios
ity and a sense of commitment among its stu
dents and teachers. And therein lies a para
dox."
"Curiosity is nothing less than the endless
desire to find truth about something; com
mitment involves the desire to act on what
one believes to be truth."
"It is the task of great teaching to create
an environment in which a person may learn
for himself to resolve this paradox, to learn
how he may fuse curiosity and commitment, so
that each, in reinforcing the other, may to
gether give life to his mind where singly they
would destroy it."
Brown emphasizes that "study and direct
concern cannot properly be separated from
one another."
"The notion that student revolt—whether
over Vietnam or social regulations or racial
injustice—is 'interfering with education' is a
notion incompatible with the recognition that
in the life of the truly educated person,
thought and action are indivisible."
"There is involved here a kind of amalgam
of vision, unrest, dissatisfaction, and a desire
to do something about it all. The task of the
university is not to keep a student separated
from the world, but to involve him more re
sponsibly in it."
For many students, the process has been
reversed: they have found through participa
tion in other social institutions that students
can play an active role in bringing change.
This belief, in turn, has been brought back
to the university, where many of these stu
dents find it increasingly unbearable to be
treated like passive containers into which in
formation is to be poured," says Joseph Katz
of the Institute for the Study of Human Prob
lems.
Katz thinks that the change in student con
sciousness is so drastic as to be "a possible
turning point in educational history.. Similar
to the people of the Renaissance and the
French revolution, students today have a new
consciousness: they feel differently about
themselves and about the world."
Gone is the passive acceptance of the exist
ing society and the individual's role in it. "Stu
dents now feel that they can do something
about their situation. Further, if things are
not as they should be, they feel that it is not
all their fault and that part rests in the social
sructure."
A third thrust of student pressure has been
to integrate the student's status outside the
classroom to his status inside. Much of he con
troversy summed up as "the revolt against
rules and regulations" has been based on the
contention that the student is treated differ
ently in his social life than he is in his aca
demic endeavors.
"There is a certain incongurity in demand
ing a critical attitude in class and assuming
that people can not regulate their own lives,"
one student leader states. "Such hypocrisy
ignores or blurs the facts." And again, lead
ership in the university is questioned.
"Because of this abdication, this refusal by
the administration to face problems," the same
student adds, "the task has fallen to the stu
dents."
All he three previously mentioned "integra
tions" have been mere preliminaries to the
final integration: incorporation of students
into the scholarly community.
Two years ago, in his concluding address
as ASSU President, Bud Wedin stated: "We

have taken a great deal of tolerance and un
derstanding from this community and replaced
it with skill and efficiency. Too often we have
regarded the individual as an object and have
seen him only in relation to rules or regula
tions."
"In short, we seem to have lost the vision of
a democratic university in which all share cer
tain rights of participation in matters of com
mon concern, and of freedom of inquiry, as
sociation, and development, and where pa
ternalism is replaced by fellowship in the
company of scholars."
"Perhaps it is time to review some of the
institutions of our society at Stanford to see
if we are really doing our utmost to produce
students with the intellectual maturity, the
self-assurance, and the sense of dignity and
independence so needed in today's society."
The following fall, a group of students and
faculty members formed the Stanford Associa
tion of University Scholars. The purpose of
the group, according to its founder Bob Rosen,
was "to break false dichotomies. Usually the
students and faculty are thought of in opposi
tion to the 'University.' We think that studens
and faculty, because they are the practicing
scholars, are the University. The administra
tion exists to work for the University, to fa
cilitate the pursuit of knowledge."
SAUS faded away, partially out of an inabil
ity to define itself and partially because the
energy of the participants was directed to
other activities. The participants in SAUS,
Rosen explains, were also involved in larger
political movements as well.
The fact that no new SAUS has arisen is
no sign that students are no longer interested
in education. Quite the contrary, Rosen mam
tains: participation in things such as the ASSU
Education Commission is far more broadly
based than concern over educational reform
ever has been.
"There is now a sincere interest in educa
tional reform," Rosen states, "and an orienta
tion toward acting on ideas. Groups will re
emerge on a formal basis with a fuller, strong
er consensus than SAUS ever had."
Just an opinion about rules and regulations
became part of the popular consciousness at
Stanford in the years following the original
questioning of the system, so now educational
reform has now been accepted.
Expect Change
"Whereas two years ago, no one thought
change possible," another says, "we now ex
pect change because we have had change. In
the election of Harris, it was shown for the
first time that on really important issues, stu
dents are willing to act. The administration
has to make sense now."
And here is no doubt that the administration
is trying harder. As one fringe member puts
it,"The administration pays more attention to
students than it likes to admit. And it is slow
to credit them."
But the reciprocal criticism also applies;
students are reluctant to give recognition to

the administration. The big problem in stu
dent-administration relations two years ago
was communication. The emphasis has shifted
somewhat now as each group recognizes that
where it had before assumed differences of
opinion, it can see now because the lines of
communication have been opened that the dif
ferences are real.
The basic problem seems to be one of trust.
If students felt they were a part of a joint
educational endeavor, in which the main cri
teria for decision-making, was as one observer
states "the engagement of the intellect over
a subject as one aspect of the educational
process," an entirely different atmosphere
would prevail.
By the combination of real participation
and openness which would require redress and
public accountability, the atmosphere of sus
picion could be replaced with one in which
all were moving in the same directions.
What students are calling for is a substan
tial say in determining their own education.
They recall that the term "authority" implies
the consent of the governed; otherwise gov
erning is merely the exercise of power.
Few models have been worked out in detail,
but one theme seems to reappear in almost all
discussions: the theme of community. If agree
ment can be reached on the principles of com
munity, any structure would come from the
consensus almost naturally.
The characteristics students have posited
for the community center around the concep
tion of a core of shared values, which would
include above all openness and freedom from
bias.
This attitude must first be employed, some
students feel, in self-analysis. Without funda
mental questioning of the assumptions upon
which the current structure of the University
is based, not even a beginning can be made
toward achieving community.
And before community is achieved, other
attitudes must change. Community involves
1) having an identification with the Univer
sity over and above loyalty to discipline or
constituency and 2) seeing people as individu
als rather than as representatives of consti
tuencies.
These traits seems to be lacking at Stanford
today and the insulting "power bloc" relation
ships make change appear the result of a vic
tory of one bloc over another rather than a
communal achievement.
As long as students are thought of as stu
dents rather than as more intellects being
"engaged over a subject," power blocs and
their consequent tactics will prevail. When stu
dents feel the frustration of their ideas being
ignored simply because of their status, they
often conclude that "Brinksmanship" is the
only way to push Stanford over the edge of
greatness.

Hopefully, the set of relations now pri
ing will be transcended, but one suspects
the structure and its occupants have bee
so identified with each other that m
change is impossible during the current
eration of either students or administrators.
Part of the gap between students and the
administration, which seems too much to
bridge: is the difference in values. In the case
of the current crop of students, the difference
seems to be more than is accountable by any
merely generational gap.
This generation tends to put the emphasis
on operations rather than content as the way
to authenticating a moral system.
"We are more open-minded and less dog
matic," one student explains. "We have a rela
tivistic conception of moral values and believe
that allowing people to develop themselves,
rather than imposing on them a system of
values, is the way to bring a happy society."
But the era of student-administration rela
tions may have come to an end, or at least a
lessening in intensity, for the recent ASSU
campaign was run on educational reform,
which will necessitate more dealing with the
faculty.
Opinion varies as to whether curricular
change will come more easily or with greater
difficulty than have the changes over rules
and regulations.
One administrator feels that "the difficult
changes are the visible ones. Those are now
past. Educational reform can be approached
on honest intellectual grounds, which was not
possible when the battles were being fought
in the public press."
On the other hand, curricular criticism can
often be interpreted as an attack on the pro
fessional autonomy of the professor. And even
more desperately, some students feel that the
refusal to be self-critical applies to the faculty
as well as the administration.
Faculty Paternalism
The administrative mentality causing a com
modity view of education in the administra
tion has pervaded the faculty as well. Pa
ternalism here is reflected in an attitude of
dispensing knowledge to a passive receptacle.
And just as with paternalism in the admin
istration, paternalism in the faculty is hard to
puncture. Some students have found a real
unwillingness on the part of some faculty
members to be honestly evaluative of their
own achievements or to confront students as
authorities in their own right.
A third body of opinion on curricular reform
holds that the administration, not the faculty,
is the key to reform because its conception of
education is the prevailing one.
This group feels that questions about foun
dations must be asked of a structure which
emphasizes passive receptivity. Regurgitation
of knowledge as a basis of determining level
of education seems to some students to reflect
Stanford's overbalance on the side of accomo
dating society.
Dave Harris based his campaign upon dis
satisfaction with the existing structure and he
analyzes his election as "an expression of stu
dent discontent, a broad emotional statement
of dissatisfaction with the type of education
given here and the student's role in it."
Education at Stanford, he says, is viewed as
"indoctrination, not participation. The student
is treated as a second-class citizen in the com
munity; his life is fragmented."
He would like to see students participating
in an "integrative four-year experience rather
than in a training period."
His preliminary plans for next year include
activities on two fronts. First, the fifty or so
people who recently signed up to work in his
organization will devote must of their efforts
to research in the fields of education, decision
making, student rights, and housing.
Second, under the heading of special Presi
dential programs, Harris is planning to back
an experimental college "to build in the mi
crocosm what we want in the macrocosm,"
and hopes to sponsor a national conference on
education.
The recent analysis by Katz and Nevitt San
ford of student activism nationally (Saturday
Review, December) has remarkable applica
tion to the situation at Stanford. They say that
the "demand for participation does not stem
from any desire to make college life easier.
Rather it springs from a profound attempt to
seek answers as to how one might achieve
such ends as a reliable personal identity, com
munity with other people, and social objectives
that will bring comfort and justice to those
largely bereft of them in our society."
Level Of Investigation
Their research shows that "the socially in
volved students total not more than 15 per
cent, but the movement can no longer be con
trolled by dealing with the minority alone, be
cause it is expressing the frustrations and as
pirations now shared by the majority of stu
dents."
The current situation represents a unique
opportunity to college administations, they
say. "Administrators who can find some way
to respond to what is human, though some
times chaotically expressed, in these under
graduate students, will find that they are go
ing to be part of a truly revolutionary phase
in the history of education."
"While the eighteenth century discovered
that good government depends upon the con
sent of the governed, our generation has the
opportunity of discovering and bringing to
fruition a system of education that is based
upon the consent of the educated."
On purely pragmatic grounds, encourage
ment of student participation in educational
reform is desirable, because, as one student
commented last spring in reaction to a speech
by President Sterling: "The 'Stanford student
movement'—if indeed, a movement exists as
such—does not represent a rebellious asser
tion of 'student autonomy' but, rather, a con
sidered and concerncd effort to help create a
better, more challenging university for those
students who follow."
There have been several signs since that
time that President Sterling shares much the
same opinion. At a recent alumni conference,
he commented that one strain of student pro
test shows "a genuine interest in the construc
tive task of improving education."
Recognition of the sincerity and construc
tive purpose of many student activists is cer
tainly welcome, but "what they desire most is
the appearance of forceful and self-critical
leadership dedicated to educational reform.
When that leadership becomes visible, stu
dents will at last be able to say that the proc
ess of bringing up father has been completed.


"Klein proposes embellishments on the cur
rent structure; I reject the asumptions on
which the current structure is based."
These words of ASSU President-elect Dave
Harris, spoken during a campaign debate
against Bob Klein, symbolize several years
of student activism at Stanford and serve as
a harbinger of the new direction in which
student activism has begun to turn.
Historically, student concern at Stanford has
been expressed in two broad areas. The first
is a rebellion against the existing conception
of the role of the student. Much of the work
of the past half decade has been to remove
the image of the student as a passive recep
tacle to be treated rather arbitrarily and pa
ternalistically.
But running beneath the surface demands
for respect and participation has been a steady
current asking questions of a much broader
nature, such as what is a university and what
is its relation to society. These questions have
either not been answered or have not been
answered satisfactorily.
It is this dilemma of looking for leadership,
not finding it, and consequently vesting au
thority in themselves that has caused the sec
ond thrust of student activists. If the adminis
ration is incapable or unwilling to articulate
a philosophy of education, some students have
said, we will begin the dialogue alone.
Both strands of the protest—that ag3 ?r,t! t
an anachronistic and degrading set of rules
and the call for discussion of broader educa
tional issues—was summarized two years ago
by one student observer:
"In the minds of many student leaders, arbi
trariness is at once a direct function of an un
necessarily paternal attitude on the part of
the administration and a denial of the essen
tial academic nature of the University."
"Students fear a vacuum—the lack of a co
herent philosophy of education at the top of
the administrative structure. They ask the
question, "Where is the leadership?" and are
forced to conclude it is nowhere if not in them
selves."
Bringing Up Father
Given the essentially paternalistic attitude
of the administration and the students' self
imposed tasi of educating the administration
on what thej feel to be some basic educational
concepts, th history of Stanford in recent
years might be titled "Bringing Up Father."
The significance of the Harris election, com
ing at the same time that most of the battles
over rules and regulations have been won, is
that student energy, and in turn administration
energy, will at last be concentrated on the sec
ond of the two areas of thrust: the attempt to
define and to work toward a new conception of
education.
But before students could begin asking
questions about the nature of their education,
they had to achieve a status in which they
were listened to. Much of the effort of the last
five years has been to gain this position. It
has been manifested as rebellion against the
role assigned to students by the administra
tion.
Basically, what the students have rebelled
against is being treated as immature and
being treated as things. Both flow from an
administrative mentality which student lead
ers think is essentially paternalistic and fre
quently arbitrary.
Paternalism is characterized by over-pro
tectiveness. It is the attitude that "we know
your best interest." Paternalism should at
least be personal, critics say, but it is not
when it is combined with the administrative
mentality which, in the words of one faculty
member "puts a premium on efficiency, and
peace and quiet."
"The person is taken out for the common
good, expediting the educational process,"
another professor points out. This has two
unfortunate consequences. First, something
has gone terribly wrong when people and their
development, those things which should be the
central concern of education, are ignored. But
more importantly, the system is self-perpetu
ating. If one assumes that the system he op
erates functions well and he dismisses critic
ism as being uninformed or as coming from
people too young to understand, the system
is impregnable.
It is for this reason that students have been
turned a deaf ear when they have raised the
broader issues, such as the nature of the uni
versity's relation to society. And, unfortun
ately, these types of questions have arisen as
natural consequences of questioning the sys
tem of dealing with students.
For example, the administrative mentality
that students have criticized" is a sytom of
what some critics term commodity education.
"There is a cultural assumption in Ameri
ca," one observer points out, "that institu
tions of society produce commodities." The
university is an institution and what it pro
duces are trained minds, components for the
assembly line of society.
Dual Responsibility
The broad issue which Stanford has not
faced, critics say, is to bring into balance the
university's dual set of relations to society.
As transmitter of the cultural heritage, the
university is in an accommodating role to soci
ety. It has the responsibility of preparing the
new generation to take control of the institu
tions of society.
But secondly, the university is critic of the
culture being transmitted. In this second role,
it conflicts with society.
The more articulate students feel that Stan
ford has become overbalanced on the side of
accomodation to society. As former ASSU
President Bud Wedin wrote in a recent article
on education at Stanford: "unlike Faustus
who sold his soul to the devil for more honor
able reasons, Stanford has aligned itself with
the biases and norms of the technological
society for want of any soul at all."
Another unfortunate result of the adminis
tration's refusal to listen to students is that
they feel compelled out of frustration to use
forceful tactics.
"They don't understand that what we say
has merit," one student leader states. "And on
the other hand, we don't understand them
because they don't explain their actions to
us." When the gap between students and ad
ministration is as large as it apparently is,
another states, "the situation suggests per
haps some inadequacy to mere discussion."
The administration has learned to listen
over the last half decade to what students
are saying and thus drastic tactics have not
been used. Explanations of this phenomenon

vary, however. The pessimists maintain that
"a lot of the change hasn't been basic attitud
inal change. It was merely strategic change
due to pressure.
The administration has played a holding
game, one adherent of this position main
tains, in the hope that "the activist minority
would graduate and this would all be over."
The significance of the Harris election, this
observer says, is to prove that pressure for
change "is not a temporary aberration caused
by a scapegoat figure."
The other side maintains that there has
been a very definite maturing process on the
part of the administration. One member of
the administration maintains, "we are no
longer over-reacting; we have more confi
dence and a better time perspective."
A slightly cynical student adds: "They know
they just can't do certain things now that
they could a few years ago. The old ploy of
divide and conquer won't work; if a minority

is being isolated and treated unjustly, a sub
stantial segment of the community will rise
in their defense."
In response to continued student demands
for change, some of the most sensitive admin
istrators (there are at least three or four
people over thirty in the administration who
can be trusted) have suggested tactics which
they feel would be the most effective for
students.
The list of one, Associate Undergraauate
Dean Robert Hind, reads as follows: • arm
yourself with facts; • go to the appropriate
person; • be open-minded; • concentrate on
academic improvement rather than peripheral
matters.
Associate Dean of Students Joel Smith sug
gests that "students are paid more attention
on pragmatic questions where they have rele
vant information. Their effect is limited when
they talk about the structure of the univers
ity."
But what Stanford has lacked, the articulate
students feel, is analysis of the structure.
"Without a discussion and an articulation of a
broad concept of education." One retired stu
dent leader states, "Stanford can only have
accretions to the current structure." And the
current structure he and many others regard
as inadequate.
The underlying criticism is a challenge of
the existing conception of authority.
The problem arises from a confusion be
tween education and administration. The uni
versity is an institution of society and thus
has a governing body. But the authority vested
ih it is only for administrative matters.
"The administration and the trustees tend
to think of education as one facet of adminis
tration, rather than vice versa as it should
be," one observer feels.
Another laments that "authority no longer
relates to education." Final authority in the
universiy, this student feels, should be
"truth,"and all other authority gains its
legitimacy in relation to this primary author
ity.
Dialogue Impossible
Fundamental to the search for truth is
"the courage to attack your convictions." At
least some Stanford students have found this
trait lacking in both the administration and the
faculty. This discovery has had at least two
unfortunate results.
First, some students have by default come
to vest authority in their peers because they
feel the faculty and administration have abdi
cated their responsibility to be self-critical.
This results in education being less challeng
ing than it could be if, these students feel,
they could respect the faculty as searching
minds as well as dispensers of knowledge.
But more broadly, a dialogue about the cur
rent structure of the university is not even
possible because of the attitude of the adminis
tration. "Real disagreement is now impos
sible," one student states. "The joint inquiry
we desire requires questioning assumptions.
The administration is as yet unwilling to do
this."
"Something must be done to challenge their
parochial conception of authority. They won't
recognize student authority or any higher
authority. Stanford has neither the courage
nor the capability to question itself funda
mentally because of its parochialism."
Concomitant to the efforts at bringing up
Father has been the effort to "Bring Leland
off the Farm." The last decade has been the
emergence of Stanford from a rather paroch
ial Western institution to a university of na
tional reputation.
The result of the very deliberate efforts to
upgrade the faculty by bringing to Stanford
people from outside has been to make the be
ginnings, at least, of a process of self-criticism.
In the student body, this process was begun
by people like Allard Lowenstein, who was
for a year director of Stem Hall and taught
in the Political Science department.
"A 1 brought wide experience to a parochial
campus," one former administrator states. "He
came to Stanford at a time when there was a
feeling that major changes were needed. He
gave students confidence that change was
worthwhile and that students could make the
difference in bringing change where it had
before appeared impossible."
For several years, many students feel, the
administration used Lowenstein and the stu
dents he met during his year here as the ex
planation of student activism. The name
"Lowenstein" is not heard often anymore at
Stanford and yet students seem more dedi
cated than ever before to pressing for changes.
Much of the thrust of Lowenstein and stu
dents he inspired was to convince students
that they did have a right to be heard and a
right to be treated as adults. In a sense, these
feelings triggered the rebellion against the

old conception of the role of the student, a
rebellion which took form in the demand for
respect.
But this first rebellion was merely the
establishment of the base on which the real
discussion of education could begin. Now that
student leaders have largely completed the
attack on the facade of the current structure,
they are moving towards positing their own
conception of education. This second of the
two thrusts of student activism is summarized
by the term "integration."
First, students demand that their scholarly
and their social criticism be integrated. Many
students find it hypocritical on the part of the
administration to demand of students a critical
attitude and an openness of mind in the class
room but not to expect the same techniques
and commitments to apply outside the class.
"It seems strange," says one close ob
server of the administration, "that we excite
students about social institutions and then
tell them to keep the valve shut until they
leave."
The basic problem, as analyzed by several
of the most astute student critics, is one of
leadership. Ilene Strelitz, Daily editor, wrote
two years ago, in an editorial titled "Where is
Leadership in the University?":
"The criticism levelled at the student is
consistently in the direction of inaction; don't
step beyond the classroom, don't speak out,
and above all don't hold the lectures in the
classroom and the words in the text as rele
vant to the broad issues of controversy facing
your generation.
Students Make Demands
"This is an odd reversal of roles.
"The student should be criticized. The Presi
dent . . . should demand more confrontation
by the student of the responsibility of the edu
cated to the society. His words should be a
constant barrage of criticism for unawareness,
ignorance of 'the world outside', lack of appli
cation of talents, the need for the university
to be the fearless critic and ethical leader.
'It is the role of leadership to criticize and
to demand action, to pose the questions, not to
prohibit them. The students wait for a leader
to raise up before them.
"... The greatest sadness of all will come
if nothing is done, for the President, the deans,
etc. are leaders, no matter how they construe
that role. And it will be sad if the students are
led into passive and uncaring commitments to
stagnation."
There are strong indications that at least
a significant minority are not heading toward
stagnation, but it seems that many are doing
so in spite of, rather than because of any atti
tudes or policies of the administration. And,
in the strangest irony of all, it is the students
who have been demanding that the university
examine its responsibility to society, that the
university be the "formulator not the reflector
of cultural values," that the university define
itself.
But integration of scholarly and social critic
ism is only one of several types of integration
students have called for. The second type is
the integration of thought and action. Here,
students find inspiration in the words of Pro
fessors Otis Pease and Robert McAfee Brown.
Pease speaks of the paradox between curi
osity and commitment. "A great university,"
he says "may choose to do many things, but
the one thing it must do is to generate curios
ity and a sense of commitment among its stu
dents and teachers. And therein lies a para
dox."
"Curiosity is nothing less than the endless
desire to find truth about something; com
mitment involves the desire to act on what
one believes to be truth."
"It is the task of great teaching to create
an environment in which a person may learn
for himself to resolve this paradox, to learn
how he may fuse curiosity and commitment, so
that each, in reinforcing the other, may to
gether give life to his mind where singly they
would destroy it."
Brown emphasizes that "study and direct
concern cannot properly be separated from
one another."
"The notion that student revolt—whether
over Vietnam or social regulations or racial
injustice—is 'interfering with education' is a
notion incompatible with the recognition that
in the life of the truly educated person,
thought and action are indivisible."
"There is involved here a kind of amalgam
of vision, unrest, dissatisfaction, and a desire
to do something about it all. The task of the
university is not to keep a student separated
from the world, but to involve him more re
sponsibly in it."
For many students, the process has been
reversed: they have found through participa
tion in other social institutions that students
can play an active role in bringing change.
This belief, in turn, has been brought back
to the university, where many of these stu
dents find it increasingly unbearable to be
treated like passive containers into which in
formation is to be poured," says Joseph Katz
of the Institute for the Study of Human Prob
lems.
Katz thinks that the change in student con
sciousness is so drastic as to be "a possible
turning point in educational history.. Similar
to the people of the Renaissance and the
French revolution, students today have a new
consciousness: they feel differently about
themselves and about the world."
Gone is the passive acceptance of the exist
ing society and the individual's role in it. "Stu
dents now feel that they can do something
about their situation. Further, if things are
not as they should be, they feel that it is not
all their fault and that part rests in the social
sructure."
A third thrust of student pressure has been
to integrate the student's status outside the
classroom to his status inside. Much of he con
troversy summed up as "the revolt against
rules and regulations" has been based on the
contention that the student is treated differ
ently in his social life than he is in his aca
demic endeavors.
"There is a certain incongurity in demand
ing a critical attitude in class and assuming
that people can not regulate their own lives,"
one student leader states. "Such hypocrisy
ignores or blurs the facts." And again, lead
ership in the university is questioned.
"Because of this abdication, this refusal by
the administration to face problems," the same
student adds, "the task has fallen to the stu
dents."
All he three previously mentioned "integra
tions" have been mere preliminaries to the
final integration: incorporation of students
into the scholarly community.
Two years ago, in his concluding address
as ASSU President, Bud Wedin stated: "We

have taken a great deal of tolerance and un
derstanding from this community and replaced
it with skill and efficiency. Too often we have
regarded the individual as an object and have
seen him only in relation to rules or regula
tions."
"In short, we seem to have lost the vision of
a democratic university in which all share cer
tain rights of participation in matters of com
mon concern, and of freedom of inquiry, as
sociation, and development, and where pa
ternalism is replaced by fellowship in the
company of scholars."
"Perhaps it is time to review some of the
institutions of our society at Stanford to see
if we are really doing our utmost to produce
students with the intellectual maturity, the
self-assurance, and the sense of dignity and
independence so needed in today's society."
The following fall, a group of students and
faculty members formed the Stanford Associa
tion of University Scholars. The purpose of
the group, according to its founder Bob Rosen,
was "to break false dichotomies. Usually the
students and faculty are thought of in opposi
tion to the 'University.' We think that studens
and faculty, because they are the practicing
scholars, are the University. The administra
tion exists to work for the University, to fa
cilitate the pursuit of knowledge."
SAUS faded away, partially out of an inabil
ity to define itself and partially because the
energy of the participants was directed to
other activities. The participants in SAUS,
Rosen explains, were also involved in larger
political movements as well.
The fact that no new SAUS has arisen is
no sign that students are no longer interested
in education. Quite the contrary, Rosen mam
tains: participation in things such as the ASSU
Education Commission is far more broadly
based than concern over educational reform
ever has been.
"There is now a sincere interest in educa
tional reform," Rosen states, "and an orienta
tion toward acting on ideas. Groups will re
emerge on a formal basis with a fuller, strong
er consensus than SAUS ever had."
Just an opinion about rules and regulations
became part of the popular consciousness at
Stanford in the years following the original
questioning of the system, so now educational
reform has now been accepted.
Expect Change
"Whereas two years ago, no one thought
change possible," another says, "we now ex
pect change because we have had change. In
the election of Harris, it was shown for the
first time that on really important issues, stu
dents are willing to act. The administration
has to make sense now."
And here is no doubt that the administration
is trying harder. As one fringe member puts
it,"The administration pays more attention to
students than it likes to admit. And it is slow
to credit them."
But the reciprocal criticism also applies;
students are reluctant to give recognition to

the administration. The big problem in stu
dent-administration relations two years ago
was communication. The emphasis has shifted
somewhat now as each group recognizes that
where it had before assumed differences of
opinion, it can see now because the lines of
communication have been opened that the dif
ferences are real.
The basic problem seems to be one of trust.
If students felt they were a part of a joint
educational endeavor, in which the main cri
teria for decision-making, was as one observer
states "the engagement of the intellect over
a subject as one aspect of the educational
process," an entirely different atmosphere
would prevail.
By the combination of real participation
and openness which would require redress and
public accountability, the atmosphere of sus
picion could be replaced with one in which
all were moving in the same directions.
What students are calling for is a substan
tial say in determining their own education.
They recall that the term "authority" implies
the consent of the governed; otherwise gov
erning is merely the exercise of power.
Few models have been worked out in detail,
but one theme seems to reappear in almost all
discussions: the theme of community. If agree
ment can be reached on the principles of com
munity, any structure would come from the
consensus almost naturally.
The characteristics students have posited
for the community center around the concep
tion of a core of shared values, which would
include above all openness and freedom from
bias.
This attitude must first be employed, some
students feel, in self-analysis. Without funda
mental questioning of the assumptions upon
which the current structure of the University
is based, not even a beginning can be made
toward achieving community.
And before community is achieved, other
attitudes must change. Community involves
1) having an identification with the Univer
sity over and above loyalty to discipline or
constituency and 2) seeing people as individu
als rather than as representatives of consti
tuencies.
These traits seems to be lacking at Stanford
today and the insulting "power bloc" relation
ships make change appear the result of a vic
tory of one bloc over another rather than a
communal achievement.
As long as students are thought of as stu
dents rather than as more intellects being
"engaged over a subject," power blocs and
their consequent tactics will prevail. When stu
dents feel the frustration of their ideas being
ignored simply because of their status, they
often conclude that "Brinksmanship" is the
only way to push Stanford over the edge of
greatness.

Hopefully, the set of relations now pri
ing will be transcended, but one suspects
the structure and its occupants have bee
so identified with each other that m
change is impossible during the current
eration of either students or administrators.
Part of the gap between students and the
administration, which seems too much to
bridge: is the difference in values. In the case
of the current crop of students, the difference
seems to be more than is accountable by any
merely generational gap.
This generation tends to put the emphasis
on operations rather than content as the way
to authenticating a moral system.
"We are more open-minded and less dog
matic," one student explains. "We have a rela
tivistic conception of moral values and believe
that allowing people to develop themselves,
rather than imposing on them a system of
values, is the way to bring a happy society."
But the era of student-administration rela
tions may have come to an end, or at least a
lessening in intensity, for the recent ASSU
campaign was run on educational reform,
which will necessitate more dealing with the
faculty.
Opinion varies as to whether curricular
change will come more easily or with greater
difficulty than have the changes over rules
and regulations.
One administrator feels that "the difficult
changes are the visible ones. Those are now
past. Educational reform can be approached
on honest intellectual grounds, which was not
possible when the battles were being fought
in the public press."
On the other hand, curricular criticism can
often be interpreted as an attack on the pro
fessional autonomy of the professor. And even
more desperately, some students feel that the
refusal to be self-critical applies to the faculty
as well as the administration.
Faculty Paternalism
The administrative mentality causing a com
modity view of education in the administra
tion has pervaded the faculty as well. Pa
ternalism here is reflected in an attitude of
dispensing knowledge to a passive receptacle.
And just as with paternalism in the admin
istration, paternalism in the faculty is hard to
puncture. Some students have found a real
unwillingness on the part of some faculty
members to be honestly evaluative of their
own achievements or to confront students as
authorities in their own right.
A third body of opinion on curricular reform
holds that the administration, not the faculty,
is the key to reform because its conception of
education is the prevailing one.
This group feels that questions about foun
dations must be asked of a structure which
emphasizes passive receptivity. Regurgitation
of knowledge as a basis of determining level
of education seems to some students to reflect
Stanford's overbalance on the side of accomo
dating society.
Dave Harris based his campaign upon dis
satisfaction with the existing structure and he
analyzes his election as "an expression of stu
dent discontent, a broad emotional statement
of dissatisfaction with the type of education
given here and the student's role in it."
Education at Stanford, he says, is viewed as
"indoctrination, not participation. The student
is treated as a second-class citizen in the com
munity; his life is fragmented."
He would like to see students participating
in an "integrative four-year experience rather
than in a training period."
His preliminary plans for next year include
activities on two fronts. First, the fifty or so
people who recently signed up to work in his
organization will devote must of their efforts
to research in the fields of education, decision
making, student rights, and housing.
Second, under the heading of special Presi
dential programs, Harris is planning to back
an experimental college "to build in the mi
crocosm what we want in the macrocosm,"
and hopes to sponsor a national conference on
education.
The recent analysis by Katz and Nevitt San
ford of student activism nationally (Saturday
Review, December) has remarkable applica
tion to the situation at Stanford. They say that
the "demand for participation does not stem
from any desire to make college life easier.
Rather it springs from a profound attempt to
seek answers as to how one might achieve
such ends as a reliable personal identity, com
munity with other people, and social objectives
that will bring comfort and justice to those
largely bereft of them in our society."
Level Of Investigation
Their research shows that "the socially in
volved students total not more than 15 per
cent, but the movement can no longer be con
trolled by dealing with the minority alone, be
cause it is expressing the frustrations and as
pirations now shared by the majority of stu
dents."
The current situation represents a unique
opportunity to college administations, they
say. "Administrators who can find some way
to respond to what is human, though some
times chaotically expressed, in these under
graduate students, will find that they are go
ing to be part of a truly revolutionary phase
in the history of education."
"While the eighteenth century discovered
that good government depends upon the con
sent of the governed, our generation has the
opportunity of discovering and bringing to
fruition a system of education that is based
upon the consent of the educated."
On purely pragmatic grounds, encourage
ment of student participation in educational
reform is desirable, because, as one student
commented last spring in reaction to a speech
by President Sterling: "The 'Stanford student
movement'—if indeed, a movement exists as
such—does not represent a rebellious asser
tion of 'student autonomy' but, rather, a con
sidered and concerncd effort to help create a
better, more challenging university for those
students who follow."
There have been several signs since that
time that President Sterling shares much the
same opinion. At a recent alumni conference,
he commented that one strain of student pro
test shows "a genuine interest in the construc
tive task of improving education."
Recognition of the sincerity and construc
tive purpose of many student activists is cer
tainly welcome, but "what they desire most is
the appearance of forceful and self-critical
leadership dedicated to educational reform.
When that leadership becomes visible, stu
dents will at last be able to say that the proc
ess of bringing up father has been completed.


"Klein proposes embellishments on the cur
rent structure; I reject the asumptions on
which the current structure is based."
These words of ASSU President-elect Dave
Harris, spoken during a campaign debate
against Bob Klein, symbolize several years
of student activism at Stanford and serve as
a harbinger of the new direction in which
student activism has begun to turn.
Historically, student concern at Stanford has
been expressed in two broad areas. The first
is a rebellion against the existing conception
of the role of the student. Much of the work
of the past half decade has been to remove
the image of the student as a passive recep
tacle to be treated rather arbitrarily and pa
ternalistically.
But running beneath the surface demands
for respect and participation has been a steady
current asking questions of a much broader
nature, such as what is a university and what
is its relation to society. These questions have
either not been answered or have not been
answered satisfactorily.
It is this dilemma of looking for leadership,
not finding it, and consequently vesting au
thority in themselves that has caused the sec
ond thrust of student activists. If the adminis
ration is incapable or unwilling to articulate
a philosophy of education, some students have
said, we will begin the dialogue alone.
Both strands of the protest—that ag3 ?r,t! t
an anachronistic and degrading set of rules
and the call for discussion of broader educa
tional issues—was summarized two years ago
by one student observer:
"In the minds of many student leaders, arbi
trariness is at once a direct function of an un
necessarily paternal attitude on the part of
the administration and a denial of the essen
tial academic nature of the University."
"Students fear a vacuum—the lack of a co
herent philosophy of education at the top of
the administrative structure. They ask the
question, "Where is the leadership?" and are
forced to conclude it is nowhere if not in them
selves."
Bringing Up Father
Given the essentially paternalistic attitude
of the administration and the students' self
imposed tasi of educating the administration
on what thej feel to be some basic educational
concepts, th history of Stanford in recent
years might be titled "Bringing Up Father."
The significance of the Harris election, com
ing at the same time that most of the battles
over rules and regulations have been won, is
that student energy, and in turn administration
energy, will at last be concentrated on the sec
ond of the two areas of thrust: the attempt to
define and to work toward a new conception of
education.
But before students could begin asking
questions about the nature of their education,
they had to achieve a status in which they
were listened to. Much of the effort of the last
five years has been to gain this position. It
has been manifested as rebellion against the
role assigned to students by the administra
tion.
Basically, what the students have rebelled
against is being treated as immature and
being treated as things. Both flow from an
administrative mentality which student lead
ers think is essentially paternalistic and fre
quently arbitrary.
Paternalism is characterized by over-pro
tectiveness. It is the attitude that "we know
your best interest." Paternalism should at
least be personal, critics say, but it is not
when it is combined with the administrative
mentality which, in the words of one faculty
member "puts a premium on efficiency, and
peace and quiet."
"The person is taken out for the common
good, expediting the educational process,"
another professor points out. This has two
unfortunate consequences. First, something
has gone terribly wrong when people and their
development, those things which should be the
central concern of education, are ignored. But
more importantly, the system is self-perpetu
ating. If one assumes that the system he op
erates functions well and he dismisses critic
ism as being uninformed or as coming from
people too young to understand, the system
is impregnable.
It is for this reason that students have been
turned a deaf ear when they have raised the
broader issues, such as the nature of the uni
versity's relation to society. And, unfortun
ately, these types of questions have arisen as
natural consequences of questioning the sys
tem of dealing with students.
For example, the administrative mentality
that students have criticized" is a sytom of
what some critics term commodity education.
"There is a cultural assumption in Ameri
ca," one observer points out, "that institu
tions of society produce commodities." The
university is an institution and what it pro
duces are trained minds, components for the
assembly line of society.
Dual Responsibility
The broad issue which Stanford has not
faced, critics say, is to bring into balance the
university's dual set of relations to society.
As transmitter of the cultural heritage, the
university is in an accommodating role to soci
ety. It has the responsibility of preparing the
new generation to take control of the institu
tions of society.
But secondly, the university is critic of the
culture being transmitted. In this second role,
it conflicts with society.
The more articulate students feel that Stan
ford has become overbalanced on the side of
accomodation to society. As former ASSU
President Bud Wedin wrote in a recent article
on education at Stanford: "unlike Faustus
who sold his soul to the devil for more honor
able reasons, Stanford has aligned itself with
the biases and norms of the technological
society for want of any soul at all."
Another unfortunate result of the adminis
tration's refusal to listen to students is that
they feel compelled out of frustration to use
forceful tactics.
"They don't understand that what we say
has merit," one student leader states. "And on
the other hand, we don't understand them
because they don't explain their actions to
us." When the gap between students and ad
ministration is as large as it apparently is,
another states, "the situation suggests per
haps some inadequacy to mere discussion."
The administration has learned to listen
over the last half decade to what students
are saying and thus drastic tactics have not
been used. Explanations of this phenomenon

vary, however. The pessimists maintain that
"a lot of the change hasn't been basic attitud
inal change. It was merely strategic change
due to pressure.
The administration has played a holding
game, one adherent of this position main
tains, in the hope that "the activist minority
would graduate and this would all be over."
The significance of the Harris election, this
observer says, is to prove that pressure for
change "is not a temporary aberration caused
by a scapegoat figure."
The other side maintains that there has
been a very definite maturing process on the
part of the administration. One member of
the administration maintains, "we are no
longer over-reacting; we have more confi
dence and a better time perspective."
A slightly cynical student adds: "They know
they just can't do certain things now that
they could a few years ago. The old ploy of
divide and conquer won't work; if a minority

is being isolated and treated unjustly, a sub
stantial segment of the community will rise
in their defense."
In response to continued student demands
for change, some of the most sensitive admin
istrators (there are at least three or four
people over thirty in the administration who
can be trusted) have suggested tactics which
they feel would be the most effective for
students.
The list of one, Associate Undergraauate
Dean Robert Hind, reads as follows: • arm
yourself with facts; • go to the appropriate
person; • be open-minded; • concentrate on
academic improvement rather than peripheral
matters.
Associate Dean of Students Joel Smith sug
gests that "students are paid more attention
on pragmatic questions where they have rele
vant information. Their effect is limited when
they talk about the structure of the univers
ity."
But what Stanford has lacked, the articulate
students feel, is analysis of the structure.
"Without a discussion and an articulation of a
broad concept of education." One retired stu
dent leader states, "Stanford can only have
accretions to the current structure." And the
current structure he and many others regard
as inadequate.
The underlying criticism is a challenge of
the existing conception of authority.
The problem arises from a confusion be
tween education and administration. The uni
versity is an institution of society and thus
has a governing body. But the authority vested
ih it is only for administrative matters.
"The administration and the trustees tend
to think of education as one facet of adminis
tration, rather than vice versa as it should
be," one observer feels.
Another laments that "authority no longer
relates to education." Final authority in the
universiy, this student feels, should be
"truth,"and all other authority gains its
legitimacy in relation to this primary author
ity.
Dialogue Impossible
Fundamental to the search for truth is
"the courage to attack your convictions." At
least some Stanford students have found this
trait lacking in both the administration and the
faculty. This discovery has had at least two
unfortunate results.
First, some students have by default come
to vest authority in their peers because they
feel the faculty and administration have abdi
cated their responsibility to be self-critical.
This results in education being less challeng
ing than it could be if, these students feel,
they could respect the faculty as searching
minds as well as dispensers of knowledge.
But more broadly, a dialogue about the cur
rent structure of the university is not even
possible because of the attitude of the adminis
tration. "Real disagreement is now impos
sible," one student states. "The joint inquiry
we desire requires questioning assumptions.
The administration is as yet unwilling to do
this."
"Something must be done to challenge their
parochial conception of authority. They won't
recognize student authority or any higher
authority. Stanford has neither the courage
nor the capability to question itself funda
mentally because of its parochialism."
Concomitant to the efforts at bringing up
Father has been the effort to "Bring Leland
off the Farm." The last decade has been the
emergence of Stanford from a rather paroch
ial Western institution to a university of na
tional reputation.
The result of the very deliberate efforts to
upgrade the faculty by bringing to Stanford
people from outside has been to make the be
ginnings, at least, of a process of self-criticism.
In the student body, this process was begun
by people like Allard Lowenstein, who was
for a year director of Stem Hall and taught
in the Political Science department.
"A 1 brought wide experience to a parochial
campus," one former administrator states. "He
came to Stanford at a time when there was a
feeling that major changes were needed. He
gave students confidence that change was
worthwhile and that students could make the
difference in bringing change where it had
before appeared impossible."
For several years, many students feel, the
administration used Lowenstein and the stu
dents he met during his year here as the ex
planation of student activism. The name
"Lowenstein" is not heard often anymore at
Stanford and yet students seem more dedi
cated than ever before to pressing for changes.
Much of the thrust of Lowenstein and stu
dents he inspired was to convince students
that they did have a right to be heard and a
right to be treated as adults. In a sense, these
feelings triggered the rebellion against the

old conception of the role of the student, a
rebellion which took form in the demand for
respect.
But this first rebellion was merely the
establishment of the base on which the real
discussion of education could begin. Now that
student leaders have largely completed the
attack on the facade of the current structure,
they are moving towards positing their own
conception of education. This second of the
two thrusts of student activism is summarized
by the term "integration."
First, students demand that their scholarly
and their social criticism be integrated. Many
students find it hypocritical on the part of the
administration to demand of students a critical
attitude and an openness of mind in the class
room but not to expect the same techniques
and commitments to apply outside the class.
"It seems strange," says one close ob
server of the administration, "that we excite
students about social institutions and then
tell them to keep the valve shut until they
leave."
The basic problem, as analyzed by several
of the most astute student critics, is one of
leadership. Ilene Strelitz, Daily editor, wrote
two years ago, in an editorial titled "Where is
Leadership in the University?":
"The criticism levelled at the student is
consistently in the direction of inaction; don't
step beyond the classroom, don't speak out,
and above all don't hold the lectures in the
classroom and the words in the text as rele
vant to the broad issues of controversy facing
your generation.
Students Make Demands
"This is an odd reversal of roles.
"The student should be criticized. The Presi
dent . . . should demand more confrontation
by the student of the responsibility of the edu
cated to the society. His words should be a
constant barrage of criticism for unawareness,
ignorance of 'the world outside', lack of appli
cation of talents, the need for the university
to be the fearless critic and ethical leader.
'It is the role of leadership to criticize and
to demand action, to pose the questions, not to
prohibit them. The students wait for a leader
to raise up before them.
"... The greatest sadness of all will come
if nothing is done, for the President, the deans,
etc. are leaders, no matter how they construe
that role. And it will be sad if the students are
led into passive and uncaring commitments to
stagnation."
There are strong indications that at least
a significant minority are not heading toward
stagnation, but it seems that many are doing
so in spite of, rather than because of any atti
tudes or policies of the administration. And,
in the strangest irony of all, it is the students
who have been demanding that the university
examine its responsibility to society, that the
university be the "formulator not the reflector
of cultural values," that the university define
itself.
But integration of scholarly and social critic
ism is only one of several types of integration
students have called for. The second type is
the integration of thought and action. Here,
students find inspiration in the words of Pro
fessors Otis Pease and Robert McAfee Brown.
Pease speaks of the paradox between curi
osity and commitment. "A great university,"
he says "may choose to do many things, but
the one thing it must do is to generate curios
ity and a sense of commitment among its stu
dents and teachers. And therein lies a para
dox."
"Curiosity is nothing less than the endless
desire to find truth about something; com
mitment involves the desire to act on what
one believes to be truth."
"It is the task of great teaching to create
an environment in which a person may learn
for himself to resolve this paradox, to learn
how he may fuse curiosity and commitment, so
that each, in reinforcing the other, may to
gether give life to his mind where singly they
would destroy it."
Brown emphasizes that "study and direct
concern cannot properly be separated from
one another."
"The notion that student revolt—whether
over Vietnam or social regulations or racial
injustice—is 'interfering with education' is a
notion incompatible with the recognition that
in the life of the truly educated person,
thought and action are indivisible."
"There is involved here a kind of amalgam
of vision, unrest, dissatisfaction, and a desire
to do something about it all. The task of the
university is not to keep a student separated
from the world, but to involve him more re
sponsibly in it."
For many students, the process has been
reversed: they have found through participa
tion in other social institutions that students
can play an active role in bringing change.
This belief, in turn, has been brought back
to the university, where many of these stu
dents find it increasingly unbearable to be
treated like passive containers into which in
formation is to be poured," says Joseph Katz
of the Institute for the Study of Human Prob
lems.
Katz thinks that the change in student con
sciousness is so drastic as to be "a possible
turning point in educational history.. Similar
to the people of the Renaissance and the
French revolution, students today have a new
consciousness: they feel differently about
themselves and about the world."
Gone is the passive acceptance of the exist
ing society and the individual's role in it. "Stu
dents now feel that they can do something
about their situation. Further, if things are
not as they should be, they feel that it is not
all their fault and that part rests in the social
sructure."
A third thrust of student pressure has been
to integrate the student's status outside the
classroom to his status inside. Much of he con
troversy summed up as "the revolt against
rules and regulations" has been based on the
contention that the student is treated differ
ently in his social life than he is in his aca
demic endeavors.
"There is a certain incongurity in demand
ing a critical attitude in class and assuming
that people can not regulate their own lives,"
one student leader states. "Such hypocrisy
ignores or blurs the facts." And again, lead
ership in the university is questioned.
"Because of this abdication, this refusal by
the administration to face problems," the same
student adds, "the task has fallen to the stu
dents."
All he three previously mentioned "integra
tions" have been mere preliminaries to the
final integration: incorporation of students
into the scholarly community.
Two years ago, in his concluding address
as ASSU President, Bud Wedin stated: "We

have taken a great deal of tolerance and un
derstanding from this community and replaced
it with skill and efficiency. Too often we have
regarded the individual as an object and have
seen him only in relation to rules or regula
tions."
"In short, we seem to have lost the vision of
a democratic university in which all share cer
tain rights of participation in matters of com
mon concern, and of freedom of inquiry, as
sociation, and development, and where pa
ternalism is replaced by fellowship in the
company of scholars."
"Perhaps it is time to review some of the
institutions of our society at Stanford to see
if we are really doing our utmost to produce
students with the intellectual maturity, the
self-assurance, and the sense of dignity and
independence so needed in today's society."
The following fall, a group of students and
faculty members formed the Stanford Associa
tion of University Scholars. The purpose of
the group, according to its founder Bob Rosen,
was "to break false dichotomies. Usually the
students and faculty are thought of in opposi
tion to the 'University.' We think that studens
and faculty, because they are the practicing
scholars, are the University. The administra
tion exists to work for the University, to fa
cilitate the pursuit of knowledge."
SAUS faded away, partially out of an inabil
ity to define itself and partially because the
energy of the participants was directed to
other activities. The participants in SAUS,
Rosen explains, were also involved in larger
political movements as well.
The fact that no new SAUS has arisen is
no sign that students are no longer interested
in education. Quite the contrary, Rosen mam
tains: participation in things such as the ASSU
Education Commission is far more broadly
based than concern over educational reform
ever has been.
"There is now a sincere interest in educa
tional reform," Rosen states, "and an orienta
tion toward acting on ideas. Groups will re
emerge on a formal basis with a fuller, strong
er consensus than SAUS ever had."
Just an opinion about rules and regulations
became part of the popular consciousness at
Stanford in the years following the original
questioning of the system, so now educational
reform has now been accepted.
Expect Change
"Whereas two years ago, no one thought
change possible," another says, "we now ex
pect change because we have had change. In
the election of Harris, it was shown for the
first time that on really important issues, stu
dents are willing to act. The administration
has to make sense now."
And here is no doubt that the administration
is trying harder. As one fringe member puts
it,"The administration pays more attention to
students than it likes to admit. And it is slow
to credit them."
But the reciprocal criticism also applies;
students are reluctant to give recognition to

the administration. The big problem in stu
dent-administration relations two years ago
was communication. The emphasis has shifted
somewhat now as each group recognizes that
where it had before assumed differences of
opinion, it can see now because the lines of
communication have been opened that the dif
ferences are real.
The basic problem seems to be one of trust.
If students felt they were a part of a joint
educational endeavor, in which the main cri
teria for decision-making, was as one observer
states "the engagement of the intellect over
a subject as one aspect of the educational
process," an entirely different atmosphere
would prevail.
By the combination of real participation
and openness which would require redress and
public accountability, the atmosphere of sus
picion could be replaced with one in which
all were moving in the same directions.
What students are calling for is a substan
tial say in determining their own education.
They recall that the term "authority" implies
the consent of the governed; otherwise gov
erning is merely the exercise of power.
Few models have been worked out in detail,
but one theme seems to reappear in almost all
discussions: the theme of community. If agree
ment can be reached on the principles of com
munity, any structure would come from the
consensus almost naturally.
The characteristics students have posited
for the community center around the concep
tion of a core of shared values, which would
include above all openness and freedom from
bias.
This attitude must first be employed, some
students feel, in self-analysis. Without funda
mental questioning of the assumptions upon
which the current structure of the University
is based, not even a beginning can be made
toward achieving community.
And before community is achieved, other
attitudes must change. Community involves
1) having an identification with the Univer
sity over and above loyalty to discipline or
constituency and 2) seeing people as individu
als rather than as representatives of consti
tuencies.
These traits seems to be lacking at Stanford
today and the insulting "power bloc" relation
ships make change appear the result of a vic
tory of one bloc over another rather than a
communal achievement.
As long as students are thought of as stu
dents rather than as more intellects being
"engaged over a subject," power blocs and
their consequent tactics will prevail. When stu
dents feel the frustration of their ideas being
ignored simply because of their status, they
often conclude that "Brinksmanship" is the
only way to push Stanford over the edge of
greatness.

Hopefully, the set of relations now pri
ing will be transcended, but one suspects
the structure and its occupants have bee
so identified with each other that m
change is impossible during the current
eration of either students or administrators.
Part of the gap between students and the
administration, which seems too much to
bridge: is the difference in values. In the case
of the current crop of students, the difference
seems to be more than is accountable by any
merely generational gap.
This generation tends to put the emphasis
on operations rather than content as the way
to authenticating a moral system.
"We are more open-minded and less dog
matic," one student explains. "We have a rela
tivistic conception of moral values and believe
that allowing people to develop themselves,
rather than imposing on them a system of
values, is the way to bring a happy society."
But the era of student-administration rela
tions may have come to an end, or at least a
lessening in intensity, for the recent ASSU
campaign was run on educational reform,
which will necessitate more dealing with the
faculty.
Opinion varies as to whether curricular
change will come more easily or with greater
difficulty than have the changes over rules
and regulations.
One administrator feels that "the difficult
changes are the visible ones. Those are now
past. Educational reform can be approached
on honest intellectual grounds, which was not
possible when the battles were being fought
in the public press."
On the other hand, curricular criticism can
often be interpreted as an attack on the pro
fessional autonomy of the professor. And even
more desperately, some students feel that the
refusal to be self-critical applies to the faculty
as well as the administration.
Faculty Paternalism
The administrative mentality causing a com
modity view of education in the administra
tion has pervaded the faculty as well. Pa
ternalism here is reflected in an attitude of
dispensing knowledge to a passive receptacle.
And just as with paternalism in the admin
istration, paternalism in the faculty is hard to
puncture. Some students have found a real
unwillingness on the part of some faculty
members to be honestly evaluative of their
own achievements or to confront students as
authorities in their own right.
A third body of opinion on curricular reform
holds that the administration, not the faculty,
is the key to reform because its conception of
education is the prevailing one.
This group feels that questions about foun
dations must be asked of a structure which
emphasizes passive receptivity. Regurgitation
of knowledge as a basis of determining level
of education seems to some students to reflect
Stanford's overbalance on the side of accomo
dating society.
Dave Harris based his campaign upon dis
satisfaction with the existing structure and he
analyzes his election as "an expression of stu
dent discontent, a broad emotional statement
of dissatisfaction with the type of education
given here and the student's role in it."
Education at Stanford, he says, is viewed as
"indoctrination, not participation. The student
is treated as a second-class citizen in the com
munity; his life is fragmented."
He would like to see students participating
in an "integrative four-year experience rather
than in a training period."
His preliminary plans for next year include
activities on two fronts. First, the fifty or so
people who recently signed up to work in his
organization will devote must of their efforts
to research in the fields of education, decision
making, student rights, and housing.
Second, under the heading of special Presi
dential programs, Harris is planning to back
an experimental college "to build in the mi
crocosm what we want in the macrocosm,"
and hopes to sponsor a national conference on
education.
The recent analysis by Katz and Nevitt San
ford of student activism nationally (Saturday
Review, December) has remarkable applica
tion to the situation at Stanford. They say that
the "demand for participation does not stem
from any desire to make college life easier.
Rather it springs from a profound attempt to
seek answers as to how one might achieve
such ends as a reliable personal identity, com
munity with other people, and social objectives
that will bring comfort and justice to those
largely bereft of them in our society."
Level Of Investigation
Their research shows that "the socially in
volved students total not more than 15 per
cent, but the movement can no longer be con
trolled by dealing with the minority alone, be
cause it is expressing the frustrations and as
pirations now shared by the majority of stu
dents."
The current situation represents a unique
opportunity to college administations, they
say. "Administrators who can find some way
to respond to what is human, though some
times chaotically expressed, in these under
graduate students, will find that they are go
ing to be part of a truly revolutionary phase
in the history of education."
"While the eighteenth century discovered
that good government depends upon the con
sent of the governed, our generation has the
opportunity of discovering and bringing to
fruition a system of education that is based
upon the consent of the educated."
On purely pragmatic grounds, encourage
ment of student participation in educational
reform is desirable, because, as one student
commented last spring in reaction to a speech
by President Sterling: "The 'Stanford student
movement'—if indeed, a movement exists as
such—does not represent a rebellious asser
tion of 'student autonomy' but, rather, a con
sidered and concerncd effort to help create a
better, more challenging university for those
students who follow."
There have been several signs since that
time that President Sterling shares much the
same opinion. At a recent alumni conference,
he commented that one strain of student pro
test shows "a genuine interest in the construc
tive task of improving education."
Recognition of the sincerity and construc
tive purpose of many student activists is cer
tainly welcome, but "what they desire most is
the appearance of forceful and self-critical
leadership dedicated to educational reform.
When that leadership becomes visible, stu
dents will at last be able to say that the proc
ess of bringing up father has been completed.


"Klein proposes embellishments on the cur
rent structure; I reject the asumptions on
which the current structure is based."
These words of ASSU President-elect Dave
Harris, spoken during a campaign debate
against Bob Klein, symbolize several years
of student activism at Stanford and serve as
a harbinger of the new direction in which
student activism has begun to turn.
Historically, student concern at Stanford has
been expressed in two broad areas. The first
is a rebellion against the existing conception
of the role of the student. Much of the work
of the past half decade has been to remove
the image of the student as a passive recep
tacle to be treated rather arbitrarily and pa
ternalistically.
But running beneath the surface demands
for respect and participation has been a steady
current asking questions of a much broader
nature, such as what is a university and what
is its relation to society. These questions have
either not been answered or have not been
answered satisfactorily.
It is this dilemma of looking for leadership,
not finding it, and consequently vesting au
thority in themselves that has caused the sec
ond thrust of student activists. If the adminis
ration is incapable or unwilling to articulate
a philosophy of education, some students have
said, we will begin the dialogue alone.
Both strands of the protest—that ag3 ?r,t! t
an anachronistic and degrading set of rules
and the call for discussion of broader educa
tional issues—was summarized two years ago
by one student observer:
"In the minds of many student leaders, arbi
trariness is at once a direct function of an un
necessarily paternal attitude on the part of
the administration and a denial of the essen
tial academic nature of the University."
"Students fear a vacuum—the lack of a co
herent philosophy of education at the top of
the administrative structure. They ask the
question, "Where is the leadership?" and are
forced to conclude it is nowhere if not in them
selves."
Bringing Up Father
Given the essentially paternalistic attitude
of the administration and the students' self
imposed tasi of educating the administration
on what thej feel to be some basic educational
concepts, th history of Stanford in recent
years might be titled "Bringing Up Father."
The significance of the Harris election, com
ing at the same time that most of the battles
over rules and regulations have been won, is
that student energy, and in turn administration
energy, will at last be concentrated on the sec
ond of the two areas of thrust: the attempt to
define and to work toward a new conception of
education.
But before students could begin asking
questions about the nature of their education,
they had to achieve a status in which they
were listened to. Much of the effort of the last
five years has been to gain this position. It
has been manifested as rebellion against the
role assigned to students by the administra
tion.
Basically, what the students have rebelled
against is being treated as immature and
being treated as things. Both flow from an
administrative mentality which student lead
ers think is essentially paternalistic and fre
quently arbitrary.
Paternalism is characterized by over-pro
tectiveness. It is the attitude that "we know
your best interest." Paternalism should at
least be personal, critics say, but it is not
when it is combined with the administrative
mentality which, in the words of one faculty
member "puts a premium on efficiency, and
peace and quiet."
"The person is taken out for the common
good, expediting the educational process,"
another professor points out. This has two
unfortunate consequences. First, something
has gone terribly wrong when people and their
development, those things which should be the
central concern of education, are ignored. But
more importantly, the system is self-perpetu
ating. If one assumes that the system he op
erates functions well and he dismisses critic
ism as being uninformed or as coming from
people too young to understand, the system
is impregnable.
It is for this reason that students have been
turned a deaf ear when they have raised the
broader issues, such as the nature of the uni
versity's relation to society. And, unfortun
ately, these types of questions have arisen as
natural consequences of questioning the sys
tem of dealing with students.
For example, the administrative mentality
that students have criticized" is a sytom of
what some critics term commodity education.
"There is a cultural assumption in Ameri
ca," one observer points out, "that institu
tions of society produce commodities." The
university is an institution and what it pro
duces are trained minds, components for the
assembly line of society.
Dual Responsibility
The broad issue which Stanford has not
faced, critics say, is to bring into balance the
university's dual set of relations to society.
As transmitter of the cultural heritage, the
university is in an accommodating role to soci
ety. It has the responsibility of preparing the
new generation to take control of the institu
tions of society.
But secondly, the university is critic of the
culture being transmitted. In this second role,
it conflicts with society.
The more articulate students feel that Stan
ford has become overbalanced on the side of
accomodation to society. As former ASSU
President Bud Wedin wrote in a recent article
on education at Stanford: "unlike Faustus
who sold his soul to the devil for more honor
able reasons, Stanford has aligned itself with
the biases and norms of the technological
society for want of any soul at all."
Another unfortunate result of the adminis
tration's refusal to listen to students is that
they feel compelled out of frustration to use
forceful tactics.
"They don't understand that what we say
has merit," one student leader states. "And on
the other hand, we don't understand them
because they don't explain their actions to
us." When the gap between students and ad
ministration is as large as it apparently is,
another states, "the situation suggests per
haps some inadequacy to mere discussion."
The administration has learned to listen
over the last half decade to what students
are saying and thus drastic tactics have not
been used. Explanations of this phenomenon

vary, however. The pessimists maintain that
"a lot of the change hasn't been basic attitud
inal change. It was merely strategic change
due to pressure.
The administration has played a holding
game, one adherent of this position main
tains, in the hope that "the activist minority
would graduate and this would all be over."
The significance of the Harris election, this
observer says, is to prove that pressure for
change "is not a temporary aberration caused
by a scapegoat figure."
The other side maintains that there has
been a very definite maturing process on the
part of the administration. One member of
the administration maintains, "we are no
longer over-reacting; we have more confi
dence and a better time perspective."
A slightly cynical student adds: "They know
they just can't do certain things now that
they could a few years ago. The old ploy of
divide and conquer won't work; if a minority

is being isolated and treated unjustly, a sub
stantial segment of the community will rise
in their defense."
In response to continued student demands
for change, some of the most sensitive admin
istrators (there are at least three or four
people over thirty in the administration who
can be trusted) have suggested tactics which
they feel would be the most effective for
students.
The list of one, Associate Undergraauate
Dean Robert Hind, reads as follows: • arm
yourself with facts; • go to the appropriate
person; • be open-minded; • concentrate on
academic improvement rather than peripheral
matters.
Associate Dean of Students Joel Smith sug
gests that "students are paid more attention
on pragmatic questions where they have rele
vant information. Their effect is limited when
they talk about the structure of the univers
ity."
But what Stanford has lacked, the articulate
students feel, is analysis of the structure.
"Without a discussion and an articulation of a
broad concept of education." One retired stu
dent leader states, "Stanford can only have
accretions to the current structure." And the
current structure he and many others regard
as inadequate.
The underlying criticism is a challenge of
the existing conception of authority.
The problem arises from a confusion be
tween education and administration. The uni
versity is an institution of society and thus
has a governing body. But the authority vested
ih it is only for administrative matters.
"The administration and the trustees tend
to think of education as one facet of adminis
tration, rather than vice versa as it should
be," one observer feels.
Another laments that "authority no longer
relates to education." Final authority in the
universiy, this student feels, should be
"truth,"and all other authority gains its
legitimacy in relation to this primary author
ity.
Dialogue Impossible
Fundamental to the search for truth is
"the courage to attack your convictions." At
least some Stanford students have found this
trait lacking in both the administration and the
faculty. This discovery has had at least two
unfortunate results.
First, some students have by default come
to vest authority in their peers because they
feel the faculty and administration have abdi
cated their responsibility to be self-critical.
This results in education being less challeng
ing than it could be if, these students feel,
they could respect the faculty as searching
minds as well as dispensers of knowledge.
But more broadly, a dialogue about the cur
rent structure of the university is not even
possible because of the attitude of the adminis
tration. "Real disagreement is now impos
sible," one student states. "The joint inquiry
we desire requires questioning assumptions.
The administration is as yet unwilling to do
this."
"Something must be done to challenge their
parochial conception of authority. They won't
recognize student authority or any higher
authority. Stanford has neither the courage
nor the capability to question itself funda
mentally because of its parochialism."
Concomitant to the efforts at bringing up
Father has been the effort to "Bring Leland
off the Farm." The last decade has been the
emergence of Stanford from a rather paroch
ial Western institution to a university of na
tional reputation.
The result of the very deliberate efforts to
upgrade the faculty by bringing to Stanford
people from outside has been to make the be
ginnings, at least, of a process of self-criticism.
In the student body, this process was begun
by people like Allard Lowenstein, who was
for a year director of Stem Hall and taught
in the Political Science department.
"A 1 brought wide experience to a parochial
campus," one former administrator states. "He
came to Stanford at a time when there was a
feeling that major changes were needed. He
gave students confidence that change was
worthwhile and that students could make the
difference in bringing change where it had
before appeared impossible."
For several years, many students feel, the
administration used Lowenstein and the stu
dents he met during his year here as the ex
planation of student activism. The name
"Lowenstein" is not heard often anymore at
Stanford and yet students seem more dedi
cated than ever before to pressing for changes.
Much of the thrust of Lowenstein and stu
dents he inspired was to convince students
that they did have a right to be heard and a
right to be treated as adults. In a sense, these
feelings triggered the rebellion against the

old conception of the role of the student, a
rebellion which took form in the demand for
respect.
But this first rebellion was merely the
establishment of the base on which the real
discussion of education could begin. Now that
student leaders have largely completed the
attack on the facade of the current structure,
they are moving towards positing their own
conception of education. This second of the
two thrusts of student activism is summarized
by the term "integration."
First, students demand that their scholarly
and their social criticism be integrated. Many
students find it hypocritical on the part of the
administration to demand of students a critical
attitude and an openness of mind in the class
room but not to expect the same techniques
and commitments to apply outside the class.
"It seems strange," says one close ob
server of the administration, "that we excite
students about social institutions and then
tell them to keep the valve shut until they
leave."
The basic problem, as analyzed by several
of the most astute student critics, is one of
leadership. Ilene Strelitz, Daily editor, wrote
two years ago, in an editorial titled "Where is
Leadership in the University?":
"The criticism levelled at the student is
consistently in the direction of inaction; don't
step beyond the classroom, don't speak out,
and above all don't hold the lectures in the
classroom and the words in the text as rele
vant to the broad issues of controversy facing
your generation.
Students Make Demands
"This is an odd reversal of roles.
"The student should be criticized. The Presi
dent . . . should demand more confrontation
by the student of the responsibility of the edu
cated to the society. His words should be a
constant barrage of criticism for unawareness,
ignorance of 'the world outside', lack of appli
cation of talents, the need for the university
to be the fearless critic and ethical leader.
'It is the role of leadership to criticize and
to demand action, to pose the questions, not to
prohibit them. The students wait for a leader
to raise up before them.
"... The greatest sadness of all will come
if nothing is done, for the President, the deans,
etc. are leaders, no matter how they construe
that role. And it will be sad if the students are
led into passive and uncaring commitments to
stagnation."
There are strong indications that at least
a significant minority are not heading toward
stagnation, but it seems that many are doing
so in spite of, rather than because of any atti
tudes or policies of the administration. And,
in the strangest irony of all, it is the students
who have been demanding that the university
examine its responsibility to society, that the
university be the "formulator not the reflector
of cultural values," that the university define
itself.
But integration of scholarly and social critic
ism is only one of several types of integration
students have called for. The second type is
the integration of thought and action. Here,
students find inspiration in the words of Pro
fessors Otis Pease and Robert McAfee Brown.
Pease speaks of the paradox between curi
osity and commitment. "A great university,"
he says "may choose to do many things, but
the one thing it must do is to generate curios
ity and a sense of commitment among its stu
dents and teachers. And therein lies a para
dox."
"Curiosity is nothing less than the endless
desire to find truth about something; com
mitment involves the desire to act on what
one believes to be truth."
"It is the task of great teaching to create
an environment in which a person may learn
for himself to resolve this paradox, to learn
how he may fuse curiosity and commitment, so
that each, in reinforcing the other, may to
gether give life to his mind where singly they
would destroy it."
Brown emphasizes that "study and direct
concern cannot properly be separated from
one another."
"The notion that student revolt—whether
over Vietnam or social regulations or racial
injustice—is 'interfering with education' is a
notion incompatible with the recognition that
in the life of the truly educated person,
thought and action are indivisible."
"There is involved here a kind of amalgam
of vision, unrest, dissatisfaction, and a desire
to do something about it all. The task of the
university is not to keep a student separated
from the world, but to involve him more re
sponsibly in it."
For many students, the process has been
reversed: they have found through participa
tion in other social institutions that students
can play an active role in bringing change.
This belief, in turn, has been brought back
to the university, where many of these stu
dents find it increasingly unbearable to be
treated like passive containers into which in
formation is to be poured," says Joseph Katz
of the Institute for the Study of Human Prob
lems.
Katz thinks that the change in student con
sciousness is so drastic as to be "a possible
turning point in educational history.. Similar
to the people of the Renaissance and the
French revolution, students today have a new
consciousness: they feel differently about
themselves and about the world."
Gone is the passive acceptance of the exist
ing society and the individual's role in it. "Stu
dents now feel that they can do something
about their situation. Further, if things are
not as they should be, they feel that it is not
all their fault and that part rests in the social
sructure."
A third thrust of student pressure has been
to integrate the student's status outside the
classroom to his status inside. Much of he con
troversy summed up as "the revolt against
rules and regulations" has been based on the
contention that the student is treated differ
ently in his social life than he is in his aca
demic endeavors.
"There is a certain incongurity in demand
ing a critical attitude in class and assuming
that people can not regulate their own lives,"
one student leader states. "Such hypocrisy
ignores or blurs the facts." And again, lead
ership in the university is questioned.
"Because of this abdication, this refusal by
the administration to face problems," the same
student adds, "the task has fallen to the stu
dents."
All he three previously mentioned "integra
tions" have been mere preliminaries to the
final integration: incorporation of students
into the scholarly community.
Two years ago, in his concluding address
as ASSU President, Bud Wedin stated: "We

have taken a great deal of tolerance and un
derstanding from this community and replaced
it with skill and efficiency. Too often we have
regarded the individual as an object and have
seen him only in relation to rules or regula
tions."
"In short, we seem to have lost the vision of
a democratic university in which all share cer
tain rights of participation in matters of com
mon concern, and of freedom of inquiry, as
sociation, and development, and where pa
ternalism is replaced by fellowship in the
company of scholars."
"Perhaps it is time to review some of the
institutions of our society at Stanford to see
if we are really doing our utmost to produce
students with the intellectual maturity, the
self-assurance, and the sense of dignity and
independence so needed in today's society."
The following fall, a group of students and
faculty members formed the Stanford Associa
tion of University Scholars. The purpose of
the group, according to its founder Bob Rosen,
was "to break false dichotomies. Usually the
students and faculty are thought of in opposi
tion to the 'University.' We think that studens
and faculty, because they are the practicing
scholars, are the University. The administra
tion exists to work for the University, to fa
cilitate the pursuit of knowledge."
SAUS faded away, partially out of an inabil
ity to define itself and partially because the
energy of the participants was directed to
other activities. The participants in SAUS,
Rosen explains, were also involved in larger
political movements as well.
The fact that no new SAUS has arisen is
no sign that students are no longer interested
in education. Quite the contrary, Rosen mam
tains: participation in things such as the ASSU
Education Commission is far more broadly
based than concern over educational reform
ever has been.
"There is now a sincere interest in educa
tional reform," Rosen states, "and an orienta
tion toward acting on ideas. Groups will re
emerge on a formal basis with a fuller, strong
er consensus than SAUS ever had."
Just an opinion about rules and regulations
became part of the popular consciousness at
Stanford in the years following the original
questioning of the system, so now educational
reform has now been accepted.
Expect Change
"Whereas two years ago, no one thought
change possible," another says, "we now ex
pect change because we have had change. In
the election of Harris, it was shown for the
first time that on really important issues, stu
dents are willing to act. The administration
has to make sense now."
And here is no doubt that the administration
is trying harder. As one fringe member puts
it,"The administration pays more attention to
students than it likes to admit. And it is slow
to credit them."
But the reciprocal criticism also applies;
students are reluctant to give recognition to

the administration. The big problem in stu
dent-administration relations two years ago
was communication. The emphasis has shifted
somewhat now as each group recognizes that
where it had before assumed differences of
opinion, it can see now because the lines of
communication have been opened that the dif
ferences are real.
The basic problem seems to be one of trust.
If students felt they were a part of a joint
educational endeavor, in which the main cri
teria for decision-making, was as one observer
states "the engagement of the intellect over
a subject as one aspect of the educational
process," an entirely different atmosphere
would prevail.
By the combination of real participation
and openness which would require redress and
public accountability, the atmosphere of sus
picion could be replaced with one in which
all were moving in the same directions.
What students are calling for is a substan
tial say in determining their own education.
They recall that the term "authority" implies
the consent of the governed; otherwise gov
erning is merely the exercise of power.
Few models have been worked out in detail,
but one theme seems to reappear in almost all
discussions: the theme of community. If agree
ment can be reached on the principles of com
munity, any structure would come from the
consensus almost naturally.
The characteristics students have posited
for the community center around the concep
tion of a core of shared values, which would
include above all openness and freedom from
bias.
This attitude must first be employed, some
students feel, in self-analysis. Without funda
mental questioning of the assumptions upon
which the current structure of the University
is based, not even a beginning can be made
toward achieving community.
And before community is achieved, other
attitudes must change. Community involves
1) having an identification with the Univer
sity over and above loyalty to discipline or
constituency and 2) seeing people as individu
als rather than as representatives of consti
tuencies.
These traits seems to be lacking at Stanford
today and the insulting "power bloc" relation
ships make change appear the result of a vic
tory of one bloc over another rather than a
communal achievement.
As long as students are thought of as stu
dents rather than as more intellects being
"engaged over a subject," power blocs and
their consequent tactics will prevail. When stu
dents feel the frustration of their ideas being
ignored simply because of their status, they
often conclude that "Brinksmanship" is the
only way to push Stanford over the edge of
greatness.

Hopefully, the set of relations now pri
ing will be transcended, but one suspects
the structure and its occupants have bee
so identified with each other that m
change is impossible during the current
eration of either students or administrators.
Part of the gap between students and the
administration, which seems too much to
bridge: is the difference in values. In the case
of the current crop of students, the difference
seems to be more than is accountable by any
merely generational gap.
This generation tends to put the emphasis
on operations rather than content as the way
to authenticating a moral system.
"We are more open-minded and less dog
matic," one student explains. "We have a rela
tivistic conception of moral values and believe
that allowing people to develop themselves,
rather than imposing on them a system of
values, is the way to bring a happy society."
But the era of student-administration rela
tions may have come to an end, or at least a
lessening in intensity, for the recent ASSU
campaign was run on educational reform,
which will necessitate more dealing with the
faculty.
Opinion varies as to whether curricular
change will come more easily or with greater
difficulty than have the changes over rules
and regulations.
One administrator feels that "the difficult
changes are the visible ones. Those are now
past. Educational reform can be approached
on honest intellectual grounds, which was not
possible when the battles were being fought
in the public press."
On the other hand, curricular criticism can
often be interpreted as an attack on the pro
fessional autonomy of the professor. And even
more desperately, some students feel that the
refusal to be self-critical applies to the faculty
as well as the administration.
Faculty Paternalism
The administrative mentality causing a com
modity view of education in the administra
tion has pervaded the faculty as well. Pa
ternalism here is reflected in an attitude of
dispensing knowledge to a passive receptacle.
And just as with paternalism in the admin
istration, paternalism in the faculty is hard to
puncture. Some students have found a real
unwillingness on the part of some faculty
members to be honestly evaluative of their
own achievements or to confront students as
authorities in their own right.
A third body of opinion on curricular reform
holds that the administration, not the faculty,
is the key to reform because its conception of
education is the prevailing one.
This group feels that questions about foun
dations must be asked of a structure which
emphasizes passive receptivity. Regurgitation
of knowledge as a basis of determining level
of education seems to some students to reflect
Stanford's overbalance on the side of accomo
dating society.
Dave Harris based his campaign upon dis
satisfaction with the existing structure and he
analyzes his election as "an expression of stu
dent discontent, a broad emotional statement
of dissatisfaction with the type of education
given here and the student's role in it."
Education at Stanford, he says, is viewed as
"indoctrination, not participation. The student
is treated as a second-class citizen in the com
munity; his life is fragmented."
He would like to see students participating
in an "integrative four-year experience rather
than in a training period."
His preliminary plans for next year include
activities on two fronts. First, the fifty or so
people who recently signed up to work in his
organization will devote must of their efforts
to research in the fields of education, decision
making, student rights, and housing.
Second, under the heading of special Presi
dential programs, Harris is planning to back
an experimental college "to build in the mi
crocosm what we want in the macrocosm,"
and hopes to sponsor a national conference on
education.
The recent analysis by Katz and Nevitt San
ford of student activism nationally (Saturday
Review, December) has remarkable applica
tion to the situation at Stanford. They say that
the "demand for participation does not stem
from any desire to make college life easier.
Rather it springs from a profound attempt to
seek answers as to how one might achieve
such ends as a reliable personal identity, com
munity with other people, and social objectives
that will bring comfort and justice to those
largely bereft of them in our society."
Level Of Investigation
Their research shows that "the socially in
volved students total not more than 15 per
cent, but the movement can no longer be con
trolled by dealing with the minority alone, be
cause it is expressing the frustrations and as
pirations now shared by the majority of stu
dents."
The current situation represents a unique
opportunity to college administations, they
say. "Administrators who can find some way
to respond to what is human, though some
times chaotically expressed, in these under
graduate students, will find that they are go
ing to be part of a truly revolutionary phase
in the history of education."
"While the eighteenth century discovered
that good government depends upon the con
sent of the governed, our generation has the
opportunity of discovering and bringing to
fruition a system of education that is based
upon the consent of the educated."
On purely pragmatic grounds, encourage
ment of student participation in educational
reform is desirable, because, as one student
commented last spring in reaction to a speech
by President Sterling: "The 'Stanford student
movement'—if indeed, a movement exists as
such—does not represent a rebellious asser
tion of 'student autonomy' but, rather, a con
sidered and concerncd effort to help create a
better, more challenging university for those
students who follow."
There have been several signs since that
time that President Sterling shares much the
same opinion. At a recent alumni conference,
he commented that one strain of student pro
test shows "a genuine interest in the construc
tive task of improving education."
Recognition of the sincerity and construc
tive purpose of many student activists is cer
tainly welcome, but "what they desire most is
the appearance of forceful and self-critical
leadership dedicated to educational reform.
When that leadership becomes visible, stu
dents will at last be able to say that the proc
ess of bringing up father has been completed.
