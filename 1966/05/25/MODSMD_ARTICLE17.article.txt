## 
### 
Chester A. Berry, Director of
the Stanford Union, has an
nounced: "It is quite obvious
that, along with other commer
cial and institutional operations,
the Union must raise prices."
On June 1 the price of ham
burgers and other fountain items
will be raised five cents. While
meal prices will remain at the
present level in the immediate
future, it is quite likely they
will be raised later.
"During winter quarter," said
Berry, "evidence accumulated to
substantiate our own indications
of rising food and labor costs."
Berry noted that the faculty

club has also announced a price
increase of approximately 15 per
cent.
Berry cited U. S. government
statistics showing the cost of
living this February had in
creased by the greatest amount
since the Korean War. Food
prices led the increase in prices,
which have held relatively con
stant for 5 years.
