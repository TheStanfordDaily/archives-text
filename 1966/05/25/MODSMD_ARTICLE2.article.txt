# First ASSU Seminar Will Feature Sanford
## 
### 
Professor Nevitt Sanford will teach
the first of three new ASSU seminars
during the first week of fall quarter
next year. The seminars will carry
two units of academic credit as di
rected reading.
They will be held at the Mountain
Camp, owned by Stanford's Director
of Athletics Chuck Taylor, located
about twenty miles north of Santa
Cruz. "It's on'y five miles from a
good beach," aoded Clark Brown, one
of the organizers of the seminar.

Sign up for the fall seminar, limited
to about fifteen students with no
more than two in any one living
group, begin today at the ASSU sec
retary's office. A fifteen dollar de
posit, to cover food costs, will be re
quired, all other costs will be covered
by the ASSU.
The seminar group will leave after
fall quarter registration and spend six
day at the camp.
Educational Reform
The new program has been set up,
according to Brown, because the
ASSU wanted to assume financial and
administrative responsibility for a
legitimate academic program. This is
the first time ASSU has done this.
"We've talked about educational re
form and educational experimenta
tion," said Brown, "and we wanted to
do something about it in a concrete
form."
Sanford has pointed out that too
often the undergraduate's academic
experience is fragmented by short
class hours, and limited by his infre
quent contact with scholars. Accord
ing to Brown, this program hopes to
overcome some of these deficiencies
by providing a student with an op
portunity for extended interaction
with a professor and the chance to
examine an intellectual area in depth
and with some leisure.
Major College Problems
Sanford, director of the Institute
for the Study of Human Problems,
will use his book The American Col
lege as a base for the seminar. Par
ticipants will be asked to have read
about a third of the book by the time
the seminar starts.
"From this we will undoubtedly go
on to discussion of the major prob
lems confronting colleges and society
today," said Sanford.
"We will probably take up such is
sues as student-faculty and student
administration relations, how to im
prove teaching, and how the Univer
sity might better fulfill its role in so
ciety," he continued.
The second and third seminars, dur
which the first week of winter and
spring quarters, will follow the same
procedure. Professors Mancall and
Anderson, of History and Sociology,
will discuss developing economies in
emerging nations in the winter sem
inar.
Professor and Mrs. Drekmeier will
study some of the late 19th and early
20th century continental psycholo
gists, using a book they are writing
and will have completed by that time.
All the seminars will consist of read
ing and discussion, and there will not
be any papers to be written.

retary's office. A fifteen dollar de
posit, to cover food costs, will be re
quired, all other costs will be covered
by the ASSU.
The seminar group will leave after
fall quarter registration and spend six
day at the camp.
Educational Reform
The new program has been set up,
according to Brown, because the
ASSU wanted to assume financial and
administrative responsibility for a
legitimate academic program. This is
the first time ASSU has done this.
"We've talked about educational re
form and educational experimenta
tion," said Brown, "and we wanted to
do something about it in a concrete
form."
Sanford has pointed out that too
often the undergraduate's academic
experience is fragmented by short
class hours, and limited by his infre
quent contact with scholars. Accord
ing to Brown, this program hopes to
overcome some of these deficiencies
by providing a student with an op
portunity for extended interaction
with a professor and the chance to
examine an intellectual area in depth
and with some leisure.
Major College Problems
Sanford, director of the Institute
for the Study of Human Problems,
will use his book The American Col
lege as a base for the seminar. Par
ticipants will be asked to have read
about a third of the book by the time
the seminar starts.
"From this we will undoubtedly go
on to discussion of the major prob
lems confronting colleges and society
today," said Sanford.
"We will probably take up such is
sues as student-faculty and student
administration relations, how to im
prove teaching, and how the Univer
sity might better fulfill its role in so
ciety," he continued.
The second and third seminars, dur
which the first week of winter and
spring quarters, will follow the same
procedure. Professors Mancall and
Anderson, of History and Sociology,
will discuss developing economies in
emerging nations in the winter sem
inar.
Professor and Mrs. Drekmeier will
study some of the late 19th and early
20th century continental psycholo
gists, using a book they are writing
and will have completed by that time.
All the seminars will consist of read
ing and discussion, and there will not
be any papers to be written.
Professor Nevitt Sanford will teach
the first of three new ASSU seminars
during the first week of fall quarter
next year. The seminars will carry
two units of academic credit as di
rected reading.
They will be held at the Mountain
Camp, owned by Stanford's Director
of Athletics Chuck Taylor, located
about twenty miles north of Santa
Cruz. "It's on'y five miles from a
good beach," aoded Clark Brown, one
of the organizers of the seminar.

Sign up for the fall seminar, limited
to about fifteen students with no
more than two in any one living
group, begin today at the ASSU sec
retary's office. A fifteen dollar de
posit, to cover food costs, will be re
quired, all other costs will be covered
by the ASSU.
