### 
Plans for a skin and scuba
diving cruise in the Bahamas
this summer have been an
nounced by head swimming
coach Jim Gaughran.
According to Gaughran, whose
scuba course has become one of
the most popular in the Athletic
Department, the cruise will last
14 days and is open only to
Stanford students.
Participants will embark from
Grand Bahama in the newly out
fitted 60-foot ketch "Marita" for
one of three sessions beginning
July 15, August 1, and August
15.
"If enough interest is shown,"
Gaughran adds, "there is a defi
nite possibility for another
boat." He asks that interested
students get in touch with him
at the Athletic Department as
soon as possible.
