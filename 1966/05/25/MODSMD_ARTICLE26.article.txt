# Card Nines Top Season Stats
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity and fresh
man baseballers have some im
pressive statistics to show for
their 1966 seasons.
Glossy individual perform
ances added up to a champion
ship for Ray Young's frosh, but
the varsity had to content itself
with a second-place tie in the
CIBA, despite leading the league
in team hitting and fielding and
placing several men high on the
individual charts.

The varsity boasted three of
the league's top seven hitters,
one of whom, Jim Hibbs, also
led in both power departments.
Steve Hovley and Frank Duf
fy, in the thick of the CIBA bat
ting race all year, ended up third
and fourth respectively. Hovley,
a junior and one of the better
outfielders in the league, led it
in hits with 29 and batted .358.
Duffy, only a sophomore and
perhaps the top shortstop on the
Coast, was second in hits with 27
and wound up hitting .351.
Hibbs, a senior catcher who
has already signed with the Los
Angeles Dodgers, had a tremen
dous second half to pull his aver
age up to .324, seventh best in
the league.
Top Slugger
Hibbs also earned the unoffi
cial slugging title by topping the
CIBA in both home runs and
runs batted in.
He hit six out of the park, and
performed the unlikely feat of
driving in more runs (23) than
he had base hits (22).
Hovley, like Duffy an atten
tion-getter from pro scouts, stole
five bases to tie for third in that
category.
As a team, Stanford hit .268,
much the best in the league; but
the Cards could only bring 87
across, topping just Cal and
Santa Barbara in that depart
ment. Though no record was
kept, the Indians must have left
more men on base than anyone
else.
Good Afield
They were impressive defen
sively as well, with generally
tight pitching and the best field
ing record in the league.
Seniors John Mason and Terry
Docken each held opponents to
well under three earned runs per
nine-inning game. Mason's
E.R.A. was a mere 2.01, third
best in the league; Docken was
sixth at 2.60.
Afield, the Cards led the

league as well, making just 26
errors for a .966 percentage.
As good as the varsity marks
were, the frosh went them one
better by hitting six regulars
over .300 and showing three
starting pitchers who allowed
less than one run apiece per
game.
Boone Best
Third baseman Bob Boone led
the batters with 27 hits for a
.365 average. His 17 RBI were
also tops, and he struck out just
once in 74 at-bats.
Center fielder Jack Hodges
must have set some sort of rec
ord when his .317 mark made
him the low man in the out
field, Mark Marquess' .327 and
Chuck Hoffmeister's .349 com
pleted the trio; Hoffmeister also
led the club in runs with 21 and
triples with three, and his 19
steals — almost one a game —
were a league record.
Shortstop Russ Tweet batted
.305 and tied teammate Ron
Shotts for the team and league
leadership in homers with three.
Tweet's five doubles were also
best on the club.
Catcher Dennis King com
pleted the .300 club with a .303
mark, and handled a remarkable
pitching staff which held oppo
nents to an average of 1.5 runs
a game.
Unbeatable Duo
Don Rose and Sandy Vance
allowed just eight earned runs
between them in 130 innings,
and won 16 of the team's 19
games.
Rose, who started off the year
by shackling the varsity hitters
in a practice game, was 9-0
with a remarkable 0.41 E.R.A.
Vance was 7-0 and 0.71, and
struck out 98 batters in 63 in
ings.
Rod Poteete, injured much of
the year but sure to be heard
from next season, was 2-0 with
an 0.77 earned run mark and 34
strikeouts in 23 innings.
The team, which tied a game
with Santa Clara in the league
season and was 27-1-2 overall,
batted .299 with 187 hits in
league to oppoents' 104; they al
so stole 62 bases, better than
there per game.
