### 
With final intramural results
yet to be compiled, several
teams figure prominently in the
race for the overall title.
Certain to be near the top are
the Sigma Chis, who won it last

year and were leading through
the winter quarter, and the
Kappa Alphas, who made a
strong showing this quarter.
The biggest boost for the KA's
was winning the slow-pitch soft
ball championship; the point
differential between first and
second places is thirty points.
In losing to the "dixiefrats" the
Neutrinos repeated as runners
up.
The Neutrinos weren't hurt
ing, however, as they won the
horseshoe pitching for the sec
ond year in a row. Runners-up
in this event were the Th e t a
Xis.
Larkin repeated as table ten
nis champions, sweeping
through the double elimination
tournament without a loss. In
the volleyball competition, the
Nooners defeated the tradition
ally strong Delta Upsilon squad.
Only the water polo champion
ship remains to be decided be
fore the IM point total cham
pion is crowned.
