# Petition Asks For Changes But No Sit-Ins
## 
### 
Ted Hershberg, an acting history
instructor and third year graduate
student, has announced that a peti
tion to President Sterling will be
available today for students who "dis
agree with the tactic of the "sit-in"
as it was used on May 19-21 at Stan
ford," but who "sympathize, however,
with the issues those who sat-in
sought to raise." The petition will be
presented to President Sterling to
morrow.
Hershberg, acting as a spokesman
for a group, said 1000 copies of the
petition had been printed for distribu
tion and are available at the ASSU
office.
Students are asked to distribute the
petitions i"n their living groups, and
graduate students are asked to dis
tr'bute the circulars in their depart
ments.
Commenting on the students who
sat in, Hershberg said, "Granted they
behaved a bit too rashly, and they re
acted somewhat too quickly to the
passions of the moment, but because
their methods were questionable
should not force us to lose sight of
the significant and meaningful issues
they sought to raise."
The petition is being sponsored by
Ted Hershberg, Sandy MacKenzie, Jon
Roise, Tom Hecht, Bill Keylor, and
Dave Shookboff.
The petition states that "the pres
ent Selective Service System's criteria
for selecting men for war discrimi
nates against the poor, the unedu
cated, and the racial minorities."
Jt continues by presenting two al
ternatives to the sit-in that "would
have constituted a symbolic protest
against the selective service system
and promoted the urgently needed re
evaluation of the existing selection
process."
Either the University should refuse
"to have been a part of the admin
istrating apparatus of the Selective
Service System," or the University
should give the Selective Service
Examination for the convenience of
its students "accompanied by a state
ment pointing out the inequities of
that test and the draft system it repre
sens."
