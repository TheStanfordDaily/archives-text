## The 						Sit-In: Misuse Of Civil Disobedience? 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Stanford's first sit-in is now
history. If it is to be remem
bered at all, it will be remember
ed as a dismal failure; it could
not have been anything else.
Speaking as one who is sympa
thetic with the goals of the
"New Left" and the anti-Viet
nam war movements, I would
like to offer a few. thoughts as
to why the sit-in was doomed
from the start.
The technique of the sit-in
(at least in this generation) de
veloped out of the civil rights
movement in the South and has
been exported to other areas and
issues largely by those active
in the civil rights movement.
Yet the conditions under which
the technique succeeded in the
South were perhaps more im
portant to the success of the
movement than the sit-in tech
nique itself. It is this lesson
which the Stanford sit-in ig
nored.
• Non-violent civil disobedi
ence is an appeal to the public
conscience—not a method of co
ercing an individual.
• As an appeal to the public
conscience, it must carry such
moral justification as to over
come the democratic presump
tion against extra-legal meth
ods of protest.
• Moral justification and the
pragmatic concern for expedi
ency and utility cannot totally
be separated. These factors
which, under given circum
star e c will make the sit-in
~ble ? i compelling will
>r iQ Iso to -ake it morally
justiaJble—and vill make the
moral justification apparent to
the larger society.
a. Civil disobedience should
be used only when all other
existing remedies have been
exhausted; when every tradi
tional approach has been tried
and found wanting. Why did
the protesters' overwhelming
demand to have the Selective
Service test cancelled manifest
itself only days before the test
was scheduled? Would anyone
expect the faculty or adminis
tration to act on such short
notice when the tests had been
scheduled publicly for months?
Wasn't the impression con
veyed to the student body that
the demonstrators' moral re
vulsion to the test had ma
terialized overnight?
b. The goal of a sit-in must
be capable of precise and con
sistent articulation. Such was
the goal of the Southern civil
rights demonstrations. They
were demanding the right to
be free from specific forms of
racial discrimination — rights
guaranteed to them by the
Federal Constitution. What
was the goal of the Stanford
sit-in? Was it the complicity
of the University in the Selec
tive Service System? Such
complicity is wrong only if the
Selective Service System is
wrong. Was the System wrong
because it discriminated in fav
or of upper middle-class col
lege students? If so, were the
demonstrators calling for uni
versal military training, aboli
tion of conscription, or some
intermediate course? Did they
oppose the test simply on the
grounds that it aided the im
moral war in Vietnam? If the
war itself is immoral, can one
be criticized for preferring a
student exemption to the risk
of being sent to kill those who
we have no right to kij'?
The sit-in was a failure be
cause it was conducted without
regard to the essential nature
and function of civil disobedi
ence.

• Unfortunate
Approach
Editor, The Daily:
The demonstrators picketing
President Sterling's office pro
testing the use of Stanford as a
Selective Service Examination
Center are using this contro
versy to register their opposition
to the Draft in general and to
United States policy in the Viet
nam war. It is unfortunate that
this partcular even should have
been chosen as the vehicle of
protest, for it has resulted in a
conflict of the principles of the
demonstrators themselves and
has offended rather than merely
awakened a large number of
the Stanford men who consider
it a great convenience to be able
to take the examination on cam
pus.
Many of these demonstrators
are among those who are de
manding the right to be able to
obtain contraceptives from the
University Health Service, vet
these same students would deny
others the right to take the
Draft test on campus, if they so
desire. These particular protest
ers are demanding one right
while denying another. The con
traceptive question may not be
totally analagous to the Draft
test controversy, but neverthe
less, these demonstrators should
maintain some degree of consis
tency in their beliefs and actions
if they wish to avoid being la
beled hypocrites.

I would strongly urge these
protesting students, if they sin
cerely desire greater acceptance
of their ideas and values, to dis
continue this particular type of
demonstration which can only
do harm to the concepts they
stand for in the long run.

• Wrongly Directed
Editor, The Daily:
Thursday night during dinner,
mimeographed sheets were dis
tributed in the Wilbur dining
rooms, requesting support for a
vigil in President Sterling's of
fice. The expressed purpose of
this vigil was to "demand our
rights ... to enjoin the Univer
sity from cooperating with and
endorsing a rotten (sic) system
by giving the next deferment
test." We do not object to these
students expressing their views.
We do, however, feel that they
are protesting in the wrong
place and to the wrong person.
The draft test was given on a
voluntary basis. In making avail
able classroom space, we feel
that President Sterling was
merely cooperating with student
desire for a convenient place to
take the test. In doing this, nei
ther he nor the University was
"giving" nor necessarily "en
dorsing" these exams, as was
maintained by those sponsoring
the vigil. The test was given by
the Selective Service, to only
those students who, having con
sidered all alternatives, chose to
take it. If everyone has the right
to decide for himself whether to
take the test, those who do want
to should certainly be able to
take it at a convenient location.
Legitimate protest of the draft
policy should be directed to those
directly responsible—to the Se
lective Service—and not to the
President of the University.

• Praising Wert
Editor, The Daily:
A large number of students
counter-demonstrating in front
of President Sterling's office
were very favorably impressed
with Dean Wert's statement to
the sit-in protesters. The state
men made it abundantly clear
that President Sterling was will
ing to meet with five or six stu
dents in a private discussion;
privacy and the absence of news
media is a prerequisite for any
meaningful and intelligent dia
logue.
The protesters were given am
ple time to present their posi
tion through normal channels
(such as the Committee of Fif
teen) during the several months
since the draft exam at Stanford
was announced, but instead they
delayed action until one exam
had already been given.
The continuation of the sit-in
after Dean Wert's statement was
made served no purpose other
than obstructing normal activity
in the President's office, since
the draft exam would not be can
celled in spite of the demonstra
tors' effort to deny the right to
take the exam from those who
wished to take it.
The diciplinary action the pro
testers will receive has definite
ly been earned, and prompt ac
tion should be taken by the stu
dent judicial council.

• Nuremberg Rally
Editor, The Daily:
The Nuremberg rally in White
Plaza conducted by members of
our community who have Hit
ler's gift for alogical demogog
uery void of any rational or per
tinent content, but who lack
his ability to hold an audience
for more time than it takes them
to walk to the union or post of
fice, was sw?et.
Did any one take them ser
iously? Five People? Would you
believe three?
Slander and moral hypocrisy
have no place in this or any com
munity, least of all when prac
ticed by a group that professes
allegiance to the highest of
moral and libertarian ideals.

• Activists Not Listening
Editor, The Daily:
I spoke to a youth who was
handing out mimeographed ma
terial on The Sit-in at the White
Memorial Plaza at noon on Mon
day, May 23. I asked him why he
was dressed in such an unkempt
way. He said that he liked it
that way. I replied that it was
offensive to me and I pointed
out to him that his feet were
very dirty. He answered that
that was because he was bare
foot. I suggested that he must
be quite young to be so careless
of his appearance and he admit
ted that he was very young. I
realize now that I should have
admonished this child to go
home to his mother.
In his editorial in The Stan
ford Daily of May 24, Mr. Roise
predicts a rise in student activ

ism at Stanford in 1966. Some of
us have been around the cam
pus for a long time. In fact we
have devoted most our lives to
Stanford students. Never under
estimate the power of a woman!
This is one woman, and there
are many faculty wives like me,
who will be active if necessary
next Fall. We will not permit a
small group of idealistic, but re
bellious and misguided adoles
cent beatniks led by graduate
Teaching Assistants, who state
that "actions of the faculty seem
to them to be an appalling in
dication of moral bankruptcy
and intellectual cowardice" to
wreck our university. If anyone
is guilty of not listening it is
the student activist. Perhaps the
dirt in his ears prevents him
from hearing.
My husband is not morally
bankrupt or an intellectual cow
ard and neither am I.

• Teaching The Faculty
Editor, The Daily:
Now that the sit-in is over and
we can try to assess the respon
sibility for the breakdown in
communications that led to it, let
us not forget to include the re
sponsibility of the faculty. The
fact is that the students did
not act until the faculty had re
fused to act.
It has been said that the fac
ulty could not have considered
the problem of the draft at their
meeting last Tuesday because
they had spent so much time on
classified contracts. That is un
doubtedly true. But why did they
have to wait until last Tuesday
to consider the matter?
Professors at Brandeis raised
the issue more than two months
ago. And why did they have to
wait until last Tuesday to con
sider classified contracts? That
issue was raised last December
by the GCC Newsletter. Have the
faculty stopped reading the
newspapers?
In this situation the students
were very careful not to violate
faculty prerogatives. But it
seems that the faculty will not
consider issues until students
have violated those prerogatives.
Why should students have to
tell their teachers that they are
tacitly condoning a possible vio
lation of academic freedom?
Why should students have to
tell their teachers that they are
condoning the participation of
the University in what may be
an immoral system? But it
seems that students do have to
tell their teachers, and it seems
that they have to do it violently.
Maybe the faculty have learned
as much from this incident as
the rest of us hope to have
learned. But if not, I am afraid
that we can expect more sit-ins.
And maybe next time they will
be in the offices of the Executive
Committee of the Academic
Council.

• Showing Their Colors
Editor, Th<> Daily:
There is a final chapter to the
story of the draft protest, which
didn't make monday's Daily:
After the demonstrators had
left the President's office, and
had walked to his home to dis
cover that he was away for the
weekend, they returned to cam
pus by the quickest route, frater
nity row. Boys on the lawn of the
ATO house shouted "It would

take three of you chickenshits
to make one of us!" and other
things they thought appropriate
to the occasion.
Boys at the Beta Theta Pi and
Phi Gamma Delta houses follow
ed suit, with the more inventive
Betas running up to their bal
cony to bombard the tired pro
testers with water balloons.
This self-comment says more
about the fraternity "system"
than any outsider ever could.

• Decision-Making
Editor, The Daily:
The recent sit-in in the office
of President Sterling served to
dramatize an issue of fundamen
tal and long-standing importance
to everyone at Stanford Univer
sity. Can Stanford University
become the community of schol
ars which it claims to be?
The events of the past week-

end have shown that we are far
from attaining this goal. The
lack of willingness to communi
cate on the part of the adminis
tration has never been as clear
ly evident than in the unilateral
decision to hold a draft test on
campus which raises serious
questions for all at the Univer
sity.
It has also been evident with
regard to the issues of social
regs, liquor and religion on
which the administration
evinced little or no desire to act
until the application of power
on the part of some other group
was imminent.
It is true that the committee
of fifteen, the revival of LASSU
as a meaningful decision-making
body, and student participation
on certain committees has im
proved the situation somewhat
in the past few years.
However the total unwilling
ness of the administration to
consult students and revise on
the question of the di'aft test
before and after the sit-in indi
cates that the basic problem
hasn't been solved.
The desire of the administra
tion to substitute power for dis
cussion in this instance raises
further questions — the stu
dents who sat in tried are about
to be tried for violation of the
fundamental standard.
In a genuine community, the
basic standard of conduct should
be applicable to all within it,
not just one segment of its pop
ulation. It is without a doubt
that the intransigence evidenced
by President Sterling hurt the
Stanford community at least as
much as the action taken and
persisted in by the students as a
result.
Who, however, is going to try
him for violation of a fundamen
tal standard?
If Stanford is ever to become
a community in any meaningful
sense, communication, rather
than power struggle must play
the major role in University de
cision-making.
In addition, any basic stand
ard of conduct which is adopted
should be made applicable to all.

• Art Of Persuasion
Editor, The
It seems to me that much of
the enlightened campus dialogue
regarding this country's involve

ment in Viet Nam is failing in
its intended goal of awakening
anti-war sentiment. One of the
most obvious and most easily
corrected reasons for the unper
suasiveness of this dialogue is
the stereotype "beatnik" image
which many of the activists
convey to the uninitiated pub
lic.
The long hair and sandals and
beards of many articulate stu
dents cannot help but subtract
from the overall appeal of their
arguments to an audience which
is generally unaccustomed to
looking beyond surface appear
ance. Moreover, the national
audience welcomes the oppor
tunity to stereotype the student
activist as "just another beard
ed mal content, probably a Com
munist, and maybe a homosex
ual." Stereotyping, though some
times helpful, in this case mere
ly relieves the public of the bur
densome task of critical evalua
tion, when critical evaluation is
just what the activists want to

promote.
The tendency to stereotype,
prevalent among the uneducated
and among some politicians, is
sad—even tragic. But, it is com
mon. To provide the undecided
citizen with such an effortless
escape from a confrontation
with the issue neither does jus
tice to the war, to the citizen,
nor to the Student Left.
Of course, most students feel
that personal freedom is the
basis of their protest. That in
cludes the freedom to dress ac
cording to individual choice.
Freedom seems to me to rank
second only to happiness in the
hierarchy of human values. To
voluntarily give up any freedom
is an act with grave political
and philosophical implications
and should by no means be done
lightly. However, a few people
are dedicated not only to living
in the world, but to making the
world a better place in which to
live. For these few the casual
exercise of every freedom may
be costly in terms of accom
plishment.
To understand that I am not
advocating conformity, the issue
of personal freedom must be
put into perspective. Now, if
sprinter Pat Morrison wants to
let his hair grow to an unusual
length, that's his business. He
isn't trying to convince anyone
to think, or by implication, to do
as he does. His hair is only his
business.
But, the political activists are
engaged in the art of persua
sion, and they are foolish if
they believe that their appeal
goes out to a purely logical pub
lic. The SCPV, it is true, is not
trying to set fashions in hair
style any more than Morrison,
but only the naive orator fails
to see the irrational association
between the content of speech
and the appearance of speaker.
The successful orator capitalizes
upon this fact.
To those who at this point re
mind me that the student move
ment is also a protest against
ignorance and irrationality, not
a concession to it, I ask that
they refer that reminder to the
student leaders, who conceive
their own role and the role of
the university as one of leader
ship. How can there be leader
ship without a following?
It is an imperfect world where
certain personal freedoms, like
the freedom to express oneself
through the choice of clothes or

hair style, must be inhibited in
order to further some other
freedoms, like the freedom to
compete equally for public senti
ment alongside the models of
middleclass values. Those lead
ers who recognize the necessity
of coming out of the philosophi
cal ivory tower to establish con
tact with a non-philosophical
world should see this compro
mise as the least of many evils.
Some, obviously, refuse to
make that compromise. It seems
to me that their unwillingness
to compromise sheds some light
on the sincerity of their com
mitment to the goal of peace in
Viet Nam.
RON GARRISON
• Conflicting Demands
Editor, The Daily:
A basic contradiction emerges
in two of the recent protest
movements here at Stanford.
The SSRF wishes the univer
sity to supply contraceptives to
anyone who wants them with
the idea that each student would
then be able to make his (her)
own moral decision. That's fine.
But now the most recent
group proposes exactly the op
posite: that the individual stu
dent should not be allowed by
his individual choice (whether
moral or otherwise) to take the
selective service draft test on
university proper. This same
group indicts the faculty as a
unit for not supporting students
in a (now) redefined cause of
student particiaption in decision
making. This is truly an inter
esting case, since the decision
to hold a draft test was hardly
made at Building 10.
More student involvement in
decision making is certainly
needed at Stanford, but the re
cent draft test is a pretty weak
issue to identify it wih.
PHIL ARNOLD
• October Days
Editor, The Daily:
In trying to see the current
student unrest - administration
intransigence difficulties from a
point of view somewhere be
yond the heat of the conflict,
I am struck by one overriding
concern: What methods are ap
propriate to the solution of prob
lems that arise within a com
munity of scholars and their
students?
It seems to me that the most
appropriate methods would be
those which are the hallmark of
any thinking community: reas
on, definition, articulation, and
dialogue. This must be the case
so long as all protagonists are
concerned with preserving the
"community."
The present situation at Stan
ford, from this point of view, is
pretty dismal. The student lead
ers prefer to posit these delicate
issues concerning government
university, war-university, draft
university in the streets. The ad
ministration prefers to ignore
the problem, to be consistently
absent.
As the scene becomes increas
ingly dichotomized, as the pro
tagonists at either extreme ac
celerate the process of detach
ment from one another, cutting
lines of rational communication,
throwing up impenetrable walls
of opaque verbiage of absolutely
no use if dialogue is really de
sider between the extremes, the
possibility of clearly raising and
effectively solving these prob
lems becomes impossible.
Rather than a community of
scholars and students, this scene
is more reminiscent of Petro
grad in the spring of 3917. So
far, the problem, clumsily de
fined even in the pamphlets and
fly-leaves of those who have
raised it, has been articulated
in the manner of peasant muni
tion workers, through slogans at
best, through shouting rallies in
the streets at worst.
And the problem has been
met by an administration unwill
ing to admit the gravity of the
situation, as yet unable to think
out the problem or to take ag
gressively positive measures to
assess the nature of the student
demands and to land on a pro
gram of action which will insure
that the university will not
have to depend on the delicacy
of crowds in White Plaza to
solve these involved and intri
cate issues.
The problem with the bread
riots in Petrograd in 1917 is not
that they were an ineffective
expression of workers' and peas
ants' extreme discontent, but
that they were able to express
only this negative sentiment in
the absence of other viable
channels of communication. And
the problem with the Russian
Provisional Government in 1917
is not that it was a bad govern
ment, but that it was no gov
ernment at all. What can we ex
pect from next October?

• 'If Its Pressed
Editor, The Daily:
Hooray for the emerging Stan
ford. Down with ambivalent dou
ble-standards, bumbling bureau
cracy, and the multiversity-in
dustrial-military behemoth. Since

the election of "artistic social
ist" Dave Harris, Stanford has
made radical progress in identi
fying and confronting the real
issues. First, that bastion of in
trigue, the Electrical Engineer
ing Department, was identified
as a cover, albeit in the open,
for the monstrous CIA. Tlien
came the revelation of the blood
thirsty anti-intelectuallism of
the ROTC. This week, finally,
we're getting to the basic issue,
elimination of the "parentis
pocis" routine with the need
made obvious by the Athletic De
partment. It should be readily
apparent that the length of one's
hair is a private matter and
doesn't even require the "mu
tual consent" of the SSRF.
Furthermore, this leads im
mediately to a more basic issue,
the rights of the Stanford Dollie.
The restrictions on "Quad
clothes," actual and imagined,
must be eliminated. What right
has the University to impose its
ideas of contemporary dress
when such regulations obviously
contribute nothing to intellectual
attainment. Each person should
be free, at least in a university,
to be comfortable, to experi
ment, and to investigate various
modes of thought and apparel.
To the comment that the dis
traction of the Stanford males
by bikini-clad or even topless
damsels would be destructive to
their intellectual endeavors, I
say that this is merely a chal
lenge to the teachers. If their
teaching is stimulating enough,
who need watch the girls. After
all, we're here for an education,
not an eyeful.
Besides, think of the health
benefits. What could be more
American than taking in a little
sun on the way to class. Why
the reduction of auto accidents
involving students rushing back
from northern beaches and bars
alone should make everyone
wish the immediate elimination
of this childish regulation!
In keeping with the campaign
a number of slogans have been
suggested. "If It's Pressed, Don't
Wear It." "Be Comfortable,
Stimulate a Professor." And of
course, you can make up your
own.
I urge one and all to take up
this issue because at the rate
we're going there won't be many
worthy issues left.

• Bad Influence
Editor, The Daily:
I agree with Terry Inch, class
of '61, (The Daily, May 23) that
it's highly unfortunate that only
40 percent of the student body
voted in the last election. How
ever, I feel sure that even if 100
percent had voted, Dave Harris
still would have won by a fair
margin.
To find the true reasons for
Dave's victory you will have to
look a little deeper than at just
the size of the electorate. You
will have to look at the forces
which led Stanford students to
vote for a rebel.
As a freshman I know that
one of the strongest influences
on my classmates is that of the
Wilbur Sponsors. I realize gen
eralizations are not always fair,
but the majority of the sponsors
I've met are radical, whether
outspoken like Dave or not.
What's more, because of admin
istration concessions, the Wil
bur Sponsors have remained a
self-perpetuating group; thus,
they will continue to impress
their radical ideas on freshmen.
This leads to the real ques
tion, who influences the spon
sors? More generally, who in
fluences Stanford students? Ob
viously the faculty, and many,
many members of the faculty
are radical. Again, I have to
speak from experience.
At the beginning of second
quarter, my mathematics class
was dismissed by Mr. Kowalski
because he refused to teach in
the ROTC building. Last Friday
I saw my first quarter English
TA, Mr. Addams, sitting on
President Sterling's window sill,
encouraging the anti-draft dem
onstrators,
Certainly these two examples
are extreme, but they suggest
what is often a more subtle radi
calism imposed on students by a
large section of the faculty. In
fact, I'm sure that many of the
"free thinkers" who voted for
Dave were merely reflecting
their instructors' ideas.
As an afterthought, contrary
to the recent article in Western
Politica, some intellectuals are
not liberal. If you want to see
a different kind of professor
molding (is there a better
word?) Stanford students, Mr.
Inch, it is your right and your
duty as a donating alumnus to
demand a change on The Farm,

• Development
Program
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to suggest that
the proposals of Dave Harris
et. al. be viewed as an attempted


"First, Premier Ky, you must learn the principles of democracy ..
community development pro
gram—an attempt at an altera
tion of the public culture of the
University with the intent of
transforming the way that the
members feel about themselves.
Cooperation and suggestions
in this attempt might focus
upon the evident need of increas
ing the opportunities of the
members of the community for
self-realization. This increased
opportunity should be available
to the students in their search
for life-models in a period of
transition, to the faculty in
their goal of transmitting the
excitement of intellecual discov
ery and of providing models of
another culture (subculture if
you will) and to the administra
tors in their role of providing
the resources and settings best
facilitating the attainment of
community goals.
The attempts to reformulate
student identity and to increase
the participation of students in
shaping a better order should
be recognized as legitimate ef
forts to deal with the frustra
tions of the present environ
ment. This normative position
rests ultimately on a personal
philosophy of education but
justification is offered in terms
of public goals and norms.
Present student frustrations
have their basis in the depart
mentalization of knowledge and
in the isolation of classroom
learning from personal develop
ment. (See Joseph Katz and
Nevitt Sanford for doubts on
this score.)
These are not by any means
the sole characteristics of uni
versity organization and opera

tion which contribute to the
process of turning excited, hope
ful freshmen into pragmatic,
other-directed, what-good-is-this
academic-crud upperclassmen.
What might lead one to ex
tend the participation hypothe
sis beyond the confines of the
psych lab to the larger commun
ity?
Dare we think that cultural
dynamics are not restricted to
primitive societies but operate
in the very Quad itself? Do we
recognize that the operation of
the present academic process
functions more to alert the sub
jects of the operations to the
idiosyncratic cues of high status
people — instilling a life-goal of
meeting environmental tests of
personal worth rather than to
invoke and inspire a search for
truth and a life-goal of self-ex
tending creativity?
If we can see past the wishful
thoughts and the socially ap
proved nice-things-to-say, per
haps we can recognize that a call
to a new identity is a legitimate
and reasonable response to exist
ing conditions.
But to be successful, "there
must be commitment to the
change, and others must accord
it recognition and do all the
things needed to reinforce and
consolidate it so that a sense of
new identity can actually be at
tained (Ward Goodenough, 1963,
p. 291.)
DENNIS J SIMS
• A Dungeon ?
Editor, The Daily:
In response to Allan Christe
low's letter of May 20th, I be
lieve that Stanford is justified
in calling itself a university,

meaning that Stanford is at
least as much of a university as
Berkeley, Harvard, or Oxford.
Stanford may not measure up
to Mr. Christelows' "ideal"
standards, but then again, many
of us have different conceptions
of the ideal.
I do not feel that Stanford is
perfect, that Stanford should
be controlled Ry outside alumni
pressure, that students should
be made to conform to some
clean-cut image, or that ROTC
students should be coerced into
donating their blood. However,
simply because we have several
problems in the university, this
does not mean that Stanford is
leading American society "down
the road to infamy."
In previous years, Stanford
students have been active in civil
rights work, the Peace Corps,
the Ravenswood tutorial, num
erous work projects, Vista, and
assorted student political orga
nizations.
Mr. Christelow cannot fairly
argue that Stanford students are
apathetic and uncritical. Stu
dents do take an interest in the
"harsh reality of the outside
world," and they have made
honest attempts to improve it.
Some of the credit for motivat
ing student activity belongs to
Sanford University as it now
exists in its, admittedly, imper
fect form.
Stanford is not the stultify
ing dungeon that Mr. Christelow
describes, nor is it a factory for
the production of machine parts.
It has been used as a vantage
point from wihch students have
re-evaluated many aspects of
the "surrounding world."
Unfortunately, many students
often become frustrated, per
haps like Mr. Christelow, when
they realize that the really big
problem of our age—the possi
bility of world war and the wave
of revolution sweeping Africa,
Asia and South America — are
beyond student control and fre
quently beyond our still limited
understanding.

• Second-Rate School
Editor, The Daily:
Stanford University's 'leap to
greatness' would be better
termed 'stumbling mediocrity'.
The so-called 'Harvard of the
West' is guilty of the following
cardinal sins:
• Blatant religious discrimi
nation (for over seventy years):
for refusing (as recently as one
week ago) to let Jews hold ser
vices on campus other than in
a gaudy Christian church whose
symbology is offensive even to
many campus Christians.
• Obsequious kowtowing to
alumni criticism: for suspending
a Freshman athlete from the
track team because his hair was
too long and thus offended a
few well-heeled alumni.
• Giving academic credit for
soldier courses (ROTC), the aca
demic content of which has been
controversial at best.
• Having a sloppily cata
logued and even more sloppily
run main library. A first-class
library is the sine qua non of a
great university. There is no
question where that leaves Stan
ford.
Like some people, Stanford is
more concerned with its image
than with itself. Are not all of
these unmistakable signs of a
second-rate university?

•Arrive? Never!
Editor, The Dally:
The Freshman Daily (May 17)
was very interesting, but in
some ways disconcerting.
After reading about Wilbur,
Civ, the personal voice in En
glish and any number of other
editorials about how freshmen
look at things, two disturbing
comments stood out most in my
mind: first, that of the Roble
girl who said "I'd change no
thing . . . I'm crazy about every
aspect of this place," and even
more, the remarke from Art
Fisher's column entitled "Fresh
men: You Are Here—But When
Will You Arrive?" that "Kid,
you're just a little freshman and
you don't know what's happen
ing."
Despite the risk of sounding
like someone who is ready to
solve the world's problems at the
end of the freshman year, I
think that both these comments
miss one of the most vitally im
portant attitudes one can ever
hope to cultivate: that of con
sructive dissatisfaction.
No society, such as Stanford
University, is so good that every
aspect of it should remain un
changed; Mr. Fisher's article re
flects the same absence of con
structive dissatisfaction as the
freshman comment, but in a
much more serious way. I ques
tion whether the senior who
would say to a freshman or any
other student, silently or other
wise, that "Kid, you're just a
little freshman and don't know
what's happening'' doesn't have
a very good idea himself of the
changes he has undergone dur
ing his four years at Stanford.
"Freshmen: You Are Here—
But When Will You Arrive?" ex
horts Mr. Fisher. I don't want
to arrive, if that means that at
the end of my senior year, I'll
think that I realize all the im
plications of my college experi
ences. I'm glad to be a fresh
man, just as I'll be glad to be a
sophomore, junior, and senior.
Because for every mistake 1
make this year, there was some
thing learned about myself or
others that was so valuable that
I was glad to be wrong in the
learning, so long as I learned.
Mr. Fisher tells us freshmen
that when we are seniors, we
will have changed and when we
realize that, we "will have made
it." He says further that until
we have made this realization,
"It's all Frosh Week until then."
Does he mean that to imply that
when we are seniors, we will
know what it's all about?
I hope not, and I think not.
If my ideas are idealistic, they
do not ignore experience. If be
ing a freshman means a little
bungling through life and some
realizations of ignorance, I'm
glad to be a freshman. I'm hap
py to know that I still have a lot
to learn, and that I always will;
I'm happy to know that I'll
never arrive.

• Rewarding Seminar
Editor, The Daily:
Because the Freshman Semi
nar program (discussed in May
17's Freshman Edition of The
Daily) is made up of unique
groups of individuals studying
relatively unrelated topics, it is
practically impossible to make
general statements about the
program as a whole.
By taking part in one of these
groups ("Modern Ballads and
Their Backgrounds" with Profes
sor Claude Simpson), I enjoyed
a wide exchange of knowledge
injected with personal theories.
That is, I found a high level of
intra-group communication of
specialized educational value
which both illustrated back
ground research and opened wide
the gates for individual study.
I left the seminar with what
I feel is an enlightened curiosity,
a feeling of accomplishment and
potential, and a knowledge
which I have found both enjoy
able and practical. I consider
this participation in the Fresh
man Seminar program one of
my most rewarding experiences
at Stanford.

• Common Standards
Editor, The Daily:
So you received ten letters
backing the position of Pat Mor
rison, who refused to co-operate
with his track coach when asked
to have his lovely locks trimmed.
Well, here is one letter which
does not back either Pat or you.
To a grown man—it appears
as perfectly silly that such ac
tions are so important. Pat
must conform to some common
standards. He wears pants,
doesn't he?
I have had more friends who
never attended Stanford kid me
about the situation. They get
lots of laughs out of you "kids."
We Stanford alumni really take
a beating because of the child
ish antics of a very few stu
dents.
This is written in the thought
you might appreciate knowing
how most of we old timers feel.
Please, don't follow Berkeley's
example!
ROY F. REINEMAN,
Covlna, Calif.
Editor, The Daily:
Stanford's first sit-in is now
history. If it is to be remem
bered at all, it will be remember
ed as a dismal failure; it could
not have been anything else.
Speaking as one who is sympa
thetic with the goals of the
"New Left" and the anti-Viet
nam war movements, I would
like to offer a few. thoughts as
to why the sit-in was doomed
from the start.
The technique of the sit-in
(at least in this generation) de
veloped out of the civil rights
movement in the South and has
been exported to other areas and
issues largely by those active
in the civil rights movement.
Yet the conditions under which
the technique succeeded in the
South were perhaps more im
portant to the success of the
movement than the sit-in tech
nique itself. It is this lesson
which the Stanford sit-in ig
nored.
• Non-violent civil disobedi
ence is an appeal to the public
conscience—not a method of co
ercing an individual.
• As an appeal to the public
conscience, it must carry such
moral justification as to over
come the democratic presump
tion against extra-legal meth
ods of protest.
• Moral justification and the
pragmatic concern for expedi
ency and utility cannot totally
be separated. These factors
which, under given circum
star e c will make the sit-in
~ble ? i compelling will
>r iQ Iso to -ake it morally
justiaJble—and vill make the
moral justification apparent to
the larger society.
a. Civil disobedience should
be used only when all other
existing remedies have been
exhausted; when every tradi
tional approach has been tried
and found wanting. Why did
the protesters' overwhelming
demand to have the Selective
Service test cancelled manifest
itself only days before the test
was scheduled? Would anyone
expect the faculty or adminis
tration to act on such short
notice when the tests had been
scheduled publicly for months?
Wasn't the impression con
veyed to the student body that
the demonstrators' moral re
vulsion to the test had ma
terialized overnight?
b. The goal of a sit-in must
be capable of precise and con
sistent articulation. Such was
the goal of the Southern civil
rights demonstrations. They
were demanding the right to
be free from specific forms of
racial discrimination — rights
guaranteed to them by the
Federal Constitution. What
was the goal of the Stanford
sit-in? Was it the complicity
of the University in the Selec
tive Service System? Such
complicity is wrong only if the
Selective Service System is
wrong. Was the System wrong
because it discriminated in fav
or of upper middle-class col
lege students? If so, were the
demonstrators calling for uni
versal military training, aboli
tion of conscription, or some
intermediate course? Did they
oppose the test simply on the
grounds that it aided the im
moral war in Vietnam? If the
war itself is immoral, can one
be criticized for preferring a
student exemption to the risk
of being sent to kill those who
we have no right to kij'?
The sit-in was a failure be
cause it was conducted without
regard to the essential nature
and function of civil disobedi
ence.

• Unfortunate
Approach
Editor, The Daily:
The demonstrators picketing
President Sterling's office pro
testing the use of Stanford as a
Selective Service Examination
Center are using this contro
versy to register their opposition
to the Draft in general and to
United States policy in the Viet
nam war. It is unfortunate that
this partcular even should have
been chosen as the vehicle of
protest, for it has resulted in a
conflict of the principles of the
demonstrators themselves and
has offended rather than merely
awakened a large number of
the Stanford men who consider
it a great convenience to be able
to take the examination on cam
pus.
Many of these demonstrators
are among those who are de
manding the right to be able to
obtain contraceptives from the
University Health Service, vet
these same students would deny
others the right to take the
Draft test on campus, if they so
desire. These particular protest
ers are demanding one right
while denying another. The con
traceptive question may not be
totally analagous to the Draft
test controversy, but neverthe
less, these demonstrators should
maintain some degree of consis
tency in their beliefs and actions
if they wish to avoid being la
beled hypocrites.

I would strongly urge these
protesting students, if they sin
cerely desire greater acceptance
of their ideas and values, to dis
continue this particular type of
demonstration which can only
do harm to the concepts they
stand for in the long run.

• Wrongly Directed
Editor, The Daily:
Thursday night during dinner,
mimeographed sheets were dis
tributed in the Wilbur dining
rooms, requesting support for a
vigil in President Sterling's of
fice. The expressed purpose of
this vigil was to "demand our
rights ... to enjoin the Univer
sity from cooperating with and
endorsing a rotten (sic) system
by giving the next deferment
test." We do not object to these
students expressing their views.
We do, however, feel that they
are protesting in the wrong
place and to the wrong person.
The draft test was given on a
voluntary basis. In making avail
able classroom space, we feel
that President Sterling was
merely cooperating with student
desire for a convenient place to
take the test. In doing this, nei
ther he nor the University was
"giving" nor necessarily "en
dorsing" these exams, as was
maintained by those sponsoring
the vigil. The test was given by
the Selective Service, to only
those students who, having con
sidered all alternatives, chose to
take it. If everyone has the right
to decide for himself whether to
take the test, those who do want
to should certainly be able to
take it at a convenient location.
Legitimate protest of the draft
policy should be directed to those
directly responsible—to the Se
lective Service—and not to the
President of the University.

• Praising Wert
Editor, The Daily:
A large number of students
counter-demonstrating in front
of President Sterling's office
were very favorably impressed
with Dean Wert's statement to
the sit-in protesters. The state
men made it abundantly clear
that President Sterling was will
ing to meet with five or six stu
dents in a private discussion;
privacy and the absence of news
media is a prerequisite for any
meaningful and intelligent dia
logue.
The protesters were given am
ple time to present their posi
tion through normal channels
(such as the Committee of Fif
teen) during the several months
since the draft exam at Stanford
was announced, but instead they
delayed action until one exam
had already been given.
The continuation of the sit-in
after Dean Wert's statement was
made served no purpose other
than obstructing normal activity
in the President's office, since
the draft exam would not be can
celled in spite of the demonstra
tors' effort to deny the right to
take the exam from those who
wished to take it.
The diciplinary action the pro
testers will receive has definite
ly been earned, and prompt ac
tion should be taken by the stu
dent judicial council.

• Activists Not Listening
Editor, The Daily:
I spoke to a youth who was
handing out mimeographed ma
terial on The Sit-in at the White
Memorial Plaza at noon on Mon
day, May 23. I asked him why he
was dressed in such an unkempt
way. He said that he liked it
that way. I replied that it was
offensive to me and I pointed
out to him that his feet were
very dirty. He answered that
that was because he was bare
foot. I suggested that he must
be quite young to be so careless
of his appearance and he admit
ted that he was very young. I
realize now that I should have
admonished this child to go
home to his mother.
In his editorial in The Stan
ford Daily of May 24, Mr. Roise
predicts a rise in student activ

ism at Stanford in 1966. Some of
us have been around the cam
pus for a long time. In fact we
have devoted most our lives to
Stanford students. Never under
estimate the power of a woman!
This is one woman, and there
are many faculty wives like me,
who will be active if necessary
next Fall. We will not permit a
small group of idealistic, but re
bellious and misguided adoles
cent beatniks led by graduate
Teaching Assistants, who state
that "actions of the faculty seem
to them to be an appalling in
dication of moral bankruptcy
and intellectual cowardice" to
wreck our university. If anyone
is guilty of not listening it is
the student activist. Perhaps the
dirt in his ears prevents him
from hearing.
My husband is not morally
bankrupt or an intellectual cow
ard and neither am I.

• Teaching The Faculty
Editor, The Daily:
Now that the sit-in is over and
we can try to assess the respon
sibility for the breakdown in
communications that led to it, let
us not forget to include the re
sponsibility of the faculty. The
fact is that the students did
not act until the faculty had re
fused to act.
It has been said that the fac
ulty could not have considered
the problem of the draft at their
meeting last Tuesday because
they had spent so much time on
classified contracts. That is un
doubtedly true. But why did they
have to wait until last Tuesday
to consider the matter?
Professors at Brandeis raised
the issue more than two months
ago. And why did they have to
wait until last Tuesday to con
sider classified contracts? That
issue was raised last December
by the GCC Newsletter. Have the
faculty stopped reading the
newspapers?
In this situation the students
were very careful not to violate
faculty prerogatives. But it
seems that the faculty will not
consider issues until students
have violated those prerogatives.
Why should students have to
tell their teachers that they are
tacitly condoning a possible vio
lation of academic freedom?
Why should students have to
tell their teachers that they are
condoning the participation of
the University in what may be
an immoral system? But it
seems that students do have to
tell their teachers, and it seems
that they have to do it violently.
Maybe the faculty have learned
as much from this incident as
the rest of us hope to have
learned. But if not, I am afraid
that we can expect more sit-ins.
And maybe next time they will
be in the offices of the Executive
Committee of the Academic
Council.

• Showing Their Colors
Editor, Th<> Daily:
There is a final chapter to the
story of the draft protest, which
didn't make monday's Daily:
After the demonstrators had
left the President's office, and
had walked to his home to dis
cover that he was away for the
weekend, they returned to cam
pus by the quickest route, frater
nity row. Boys on the lawn of the
ATO house shouted "It would

take three of you chickenshits
to make one of us!" and other
things they thought appropriate
to the occasion.
Boys at the Beta Theta Pi and
Phi Gamma Delta houses follow
ed suit, with the more inventive
Betas running up to their bal
cony to bombard the tired pro
testers with water balloons.
This self-comment says more
about the fraternity "system"
than any outsider ever could.
MARLENE CHARYN

• Decision-Making
Editor, The Daily:
The recent sit-in in the office
of President Sterling served to
dramatize an issue of fundamen
tal and long-standing importance
to everyone at Stanford Univer
sity. Can Stanford University
become the community of schol
ars which it claims to be?
The events of the past week-

end have shown that we are far
from attaining this goal. The
lack of willingness to communi
cate on the part of the adminis
tration has never been as clear
ly evident than in the unilateral
decision to hold a draft test on
campus which raises serious
questions for all at the Univer
sity.
It has also been evident with
regard to the issues of social
regs, liquor and religion on
which the administration
evinced little or no desire to act
until the application of power
on the part of some other group
was imminent.
It is true that the committee
of fifteen, the revival of LASSU
as a meaningful decision-making
body, and student participation
on certain committees has im
proved the situation somewhat
in the past few years.
However the total unwilling
ness of the administration to
consult students and revise on
the question of the di'aft test
before and after the sit-in indi
cates that the basic problem
hasn't been solved.
The desire of the administra
tion to substitute power for dis
cussion in this instance raises
further questions — the stu
dents who sat in tried are about
to be tried for violation of the
fundamental standard.
In a genuine community, the
basic standard of conduct should
be applicable to all within it,
not just one segment of its pop
ulation. It is without a doubt
that the intransigence evidenced
by President Sterling hurt the
Stanford community at least as
much as the action taken and
persisted in by the students as a
result.
Who, however, is going to try
him for violation of a fundamen
tal standard?
If Stanford is ever to become
a community in any meaningful
sense, communication, rather
than power struggle must play
the major role in University de
cision-making.
In addition, any basic stand
ard of conduct which is adopted
should be made applicable to all.
JOHN SHIPPEE

• Art Of Persuasion
Editor, The
It seems to me that much of
the enlightened campus dialogue
regarding this country's involve

ment in Viet Nam is failing in
its intended goal of awakening
anti-war sentiment. One of the
most obvious and most easily
corrected reasons for the unper
suasiveness of this dialogue is
the stereotype "beatnik" image
which many of the activists
convey to the uninitiated pub
lic.
The long hair and sandals and
beards of many articulate stu
dents cannot help but subtract
from the overall appeal of their
arguments to an audience which
is generally unaccustomed to
looking beyond surface appear
ance. Moreover, the national
audience welcomes the oppor
tunity to stereotype the student
activist as "just another beard
ed mal content, probably a Com
munist, and maybe a homosex
ual." Stereotyping, though some
times helpful, in this case mere
ly relieves the public of the bur
densome task of critical evalua
tion, when critical evaluation is
just what the activists want to

promote.
The tendency to stereotype,
prevalent among the uneducated
and among some politicians, is
sad—even tragic. But, it is com
mon. To provide the undecided
citizen with such an effortless
escape from a confrontation
with the issue neither does jus
tice to the war, to the citizen,
nor to the Student Left.
Of course, most students feel
that personal freedom is the
basis of their protest. That in
cludes the freedom to dress ac
cording to individual choice.
Freedom seems to me to rank
second only to happiness in the
hierarchy of human values. To
voluntarily give up any freedom
is an act with grave political
and philosophical implications
and should by no means be done
lightly. However, a few people
are dedicated not only to living
in the world, but to making the
world a better place in which to
live. For these few the casual
exercise of every freedom may
be costly in terms of accom
plishment.
To understand that I am not
advocating conformity, the issue
of personal freedom must be
put into perspective. Now, if
sprinter Pat Morrison wants to
let his hair grow to an unusual
length, that's his business. He
isn't trying to convince anyone
to think, or by implication, to do
as he does. His hair is only his
business.
But, the political activists are
engaged in the art of persua
sion, and they are foolish if
they believe that their appeal
goes out to a purely logical pub
lic. The SCPV, it is true, is not
trying to set fashions in hair
style any more than Morrison,
but only the naive orator fails
to see the irrational association
between the content of speech
and the appearance of speaker.
The successful orator capitalizes
upon this fact.
To those who at this point re
mind me that the student move
ment is also a protest against
ignorance and irrationality, not
a concession to it, I ask that
they refer that reminder to the
student leaders, who conceive
their own role and the role of
the university as one of leader
ship. How can there be leader
ship without a following?
It is an imperfect world where
certain personal freedoms, like
the freedom to express oneself
through the choice of clothes or

hair style, must be inhibited in
order to further some other
freedoms, like the freedom to
compete equally for public senti
ment alongside the models of
middleclass values. Those lead
ers who recognize the necessity
of coming out of the philosophi
cal ivory tower to establish con
tact with a non-philosophical
world should see this compro
mise as the least of many evils.
Some, obviously, refuse to
make that compromise. It seems
to me that their unwillingness
to compromise sheds some light
on the sincerity of their com
mitment to the goal of peace in
Viet Nam.
RON GARRISON
• Conflicting Demands
Editor, The Daily:
A basic contradiction emerges
in two of the recent protest
movements here at Stanford.
The SSRF wishes the univer
sity to supply contraceptives to
anyone who wants them with
the idea that each student would
then be able to make his (her)
own moral decision. That's fine.
But now the most recent
group proposes exactly the op
posite: that the individual stu
dent should not be allowed by
his individual choice (whether
moral or otherwise) to take the
selective service draft test on
university proper. This same
group indicts the faculty as a
unit for not supporting students
in a (now) redefined cause of
student particiaption in decision
making. This is truly an inter
esting case, since the decision
to hold a draft test was hardly
made at Building 10.
More student involvement in
decision making is certainly
needed at Stanford, but the re
cent draft test is a pretty weak
issue to identify it wih.
PHIL ARNOLD
• October Days
Editor, The Daily:
In trying to see the current
student unrest - administration
intransigence difficulties from a
point of view somewhere be
yond the heat of the conflict,
I am struck by one overriding
concern: What methods are ap
propriate to the solution of prob
lems that arise within a com
munity of scholars and their
students?
It seems to me that the most
appropriate methods would be
those which are the hallmark of
any thinking community: reas
on, definition, articulation, and
dialogue. This must be the case
so long as all protagonists are
concerned with preserving the
"community."
The present situation at Stan
ford, from this point of view, is
pretty dismal. The student lead
ers prefer to posit these delicate
issues concerning government
university, war-university, draft
university in the streets. The ad
ministration prefers to ignore
the problem, to be consistently
absent.
As the scene becomes increas
ingly dichotomized, as the pro
tagonists at either extreme ac
celerate the process of detach
ment from one another, cutting
lines of rational communication,
throwing up impenetrable walls
of opaque verbiage of absolutely
no use if dialogue is really de
sider between the extremes, the
possibility of clearly raising and
effectively solving these prob
lems becomes impossible.
Rather than a community of
scholars and students, this scene
is more reminiscent of Petro
grad in the spring of 3917. So
far, the problem, clumsily de
fined even in the pamphlets and
fly-leaves of those who have
raised it, has been articulated
in the manner of peasant muni
tion workers, through slogans at
best, through shouting rallies in
the streets at worst.
And the problem has been
met by an administration unwill
ing to admit the gravity of the
situation, as yet unable to think
out the problem or to take ag
gressively positive measures to
assess the nature of the student
demands and to land on a pro
gram of action which will insure
that the university will not
have to depend on the delicacy
of crowds in White Plaza to
solve these involved and intri
cate issues.
The problem with the bread
riots in Petrograd in 1917 is not
that they were an ineffective
expression of workers' and peas
ants' extreme discontent, but
that they were able to express
only this negative sentiment in
the absence of other viable
channels of communication. And
the problem with the Russian
Provisional Government in 1917
is not that it was a bad govern
ment, but that it was no gov
ernment at all. What can we ex
pect from next October?

• 'If Its Pressed
Editor, The Daily:
Hooray for the emerging Stan
ford. Down with ambivalent dou
ble-standards, bumbling bureau
cracy, and the multiversity-in
dustrial-military behemoth. Since

the election of "artistic social
ist" Dave Harris, Stanford has
made radical progress in identi
fying and confronting the real
issues. First, that bastion of in
trigue, the Electrical Engineer
ing Department, was identified
as a cover, albeit in the open,
for the monstrous CIA. Tlien
came the revelation of the blood
thirsty anti-intelectuallism of
the ROTC. This week, finally,
we're getting to the basic issue,
elimination of the "parentis
pocis" routine with the need
made obvious by the Athletic De
partment. It should be readily
apparent that the length of one's
hair is a private matter and
doesn't even require the "mu
tual consent" of the SSRF.
Furthermore, this leads im
mediately to a more basic issue,
the rights of the Stanford Dollie.
The restrictions on "Quad
clothes," actual and imagined,
must be eliminated. What right
has the University to impose its
ideas of contemporary dress
when such regulations obviously
contribute nothing to intellectual
attainment. Each person should
be free, at least in a university,
to be comfortable, to experi
ment, and to investigate various
modes of thought and apparel.
To the comment that the dis
traction of the Stanford males
by bikini-clad or even topless
damsels would be destructive to
their intellectual endeavors, I
say that this is merely a chal
lenge to the teachers. If their
teaching is stimulating enough,
who need watch the girls. After
all, we're here for an education,
not an eyeful.
Besides, think of the health
benefits. What could be more
American than taking in a little
sun on the way to class. Why
the reduction of auto accidents
involving students rushing back
from northern beaches and bars
alone should make everyone
wish the immediate elimination
of this childish regulation!
In keeping with the campaign
a number of slogans have been
suggested. "If It's Pressed, Don't
Wear It." "Be Comfortable,
Stimulate a Professor." And of
course, you can make up your
own.
I urge one and all to take up
this issue because at the rate
we're going there won't be many
worthy issues left.

• Bad Influence
Editor, The Daily:
I agree with Terry Inch, class
of '61, (The Daily, May 23) that
it's highly unfortunate that only
40 percent of the student body
voted in the last election. How
ever, I feel sure that even if 100
percent had voted, Dave Harris
still would have won by a fair
margin.
To find the true reasons for
Dave's victory you will have to
look a little deeper than at just
the size of the electorate. You
will have to look at the forces
which led Stanford students to
vote for a rebel.
As a freshman I know that
one of the strongest influences
on my classmates is that of the
Wilbur Sponsors. I realize gen
eralizations are not always fair,
but the majority of the sponsors
I've met are radical, whether
outspoken like Dave or not.
What's more, because of admin
istration concessions, the Wil
bur Sponsors have remained a
self-perpetuating group; thus,
they will continue to impress
their radical ideas on freshmen.
This leads to the real ques
tion, who influences the spon
sors? More generally, who in
fluences Stanford students? Ob
viously the faculty, and many,
many members of the faculty
are radical. Again, I have to
speak from experience.
At the beginning of second
quarter, my mathematics class
was dismissed by Mr. Kowalski
because he refused to teach in
the ROTC building. Last Friday
I saw my first quarter English
TA, Mr. Addams, sitting on
President Sterling's window sill,
encouraging the anti-draft dem
onstrators,
Certainly these two examples
are extreme, but they suggest
what is often a more subtle radi
calism imposed on students by a
large section of the faculty. In
fact, I'm sure that many of the
"free thinkers" who voted for
Dave were merely reflecting
their instructors' ideas.
As an afterthought, contrary
to the recent article in Western
Politica, some intellectuals are
not liberal. If you want to see
a different kind of professor
molding (is there a better
word?) Stanford students, Mr.
Inch, it is your right and your
duty as a donating alumnus to
demand a change on The Farm,

• Development
Program
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to suggest that
the proposals of Dave Harris
et. al. be viewed as an attempted


"First, Premier Ky, you must learn the principles of democracy ..
community development pro
gram—an attempt at an altera
tion of the public culture of the
University with the intent of
transforming the way that the
members feel about themselves.
Cooperation and suggestions
in this attempt might focus
upon the evident need of increas
ing the opportunities of the
members of the community for
self-realization. This increased
opportunity should be available
to the students in their search
for life-models in a period of
transition, to the faculty in
their goal of transmitting the
excitement of intellecual discov
ery and of providing models of
another culture (subculture if
you will) and to the administra
tors in their role of providing
the resources and settings best
facilitating the attainment of
community goals.
The attempts to reformulate
student identity and to increase
the participation of students in
shaping a better order should
be recognized as legitimate ef
forts to deal with the frustra
tions of the present environ
ment. This normative position
rests ultimately on a personal
philosophy of education but
justification is offered in terms
of public goals and norms.
Present student frustrations
have their basis in the depart
mentalization of knowledge and
in the isolation of classroom
learning from personal develop
ment. (See Joseph Katz and
Nevitt Sanford for doubts on
this score.)
These are not by any means
the sole characteristics of uni
versity organization and opera

tion which contribute to the
process of turning excited, hope
ful freshmen into pragmatic,
other-directed, what-good-is-this
academic-crud upperclassmen.
What might lead one to ex
tend the participation hypothe
sis beyond the confines of the
psych lab to the larger commun
ity?
Dare we think that cultural
dynamics are not restricted to
primitive societies but operate
in the very Quad itself? Do we
recognize that the operation of
the present academic process
functions more to alert the sub
jects of the operations to the
idiosyncratic cues of high status
people — instilling a life-goal of
meeting environmental tests of
personal worth rather than to
invoke and inspire a search for
truth and a life-goal of self-ex
tending creativity?
If we can see past the wishful
thoughts and the socially ap
proved nice-things-to-say, per
haps we can recognize that a call
to a new identity is a legitimate
and reasonable response to exist
ing conditions.
But to be successful, "there
must be commitment to the
change, and others must accord
it recognition and do all the
things needed to reinforce and
consolidate it so that a sense of
new identity can actually be at
tained (Ward Goodenough, 1963,
p. 291.)
DENNIS J SIMS
• A Dungeon ?
Editor, The Daily:
In response to Allan Christe
low's letter of May 20th, I be
lieve that Stanford is justified
in calling itself a university,

meaning that Stanford is at
least as much of a university as
Berkeley, Harvard, or Oxford.
Stanford may not measure up
to Mr. Christelows' "ideal"
standards, but then again, many
of us have different conceptions
of the ideal.
I do not feel that Stanford is
perfect, that Stanford should
be controlled Ry outside alumni
pressure, that students should
be made to conform to some
clean-cut image, or that ROTC
students should be coerced into
donating their blood. However,
simply because we have several
problems in the university, this
does not mean that Stanford is
leading American society "down
the road to infamy."
In previous years, Stanford
students have been active in civil
rights work, the Peace Corps,
the Ravenswood tutorial, num
erous work projects, Vista, and
assorted student political orga
nizations.
Mr. Christelow cannot fairly
argue that Stanford students are
apathetic and uncritical. Stu
dents do take an interest in the
"harsh reality of the outside
world," and they have made
honest attempts to improve it.
Some of the credit for motivat
ing student activity belongs to
Sanford University as it now
exists in its, admittedly, imper
fect form.
Stanford is not the stultify
ing dungeon that Mr. Christelow
describes, nor is it a factory for
the production of machine parts.
It has been used as a vantage
point from wihch students have
re-evaluated many aspects of
the "surrounding world."
Unfortunately, many students
often become frustrated, per
haps like Mr. Christelow, when
they realize that the really big
problem of our age—the possi
bility of world war and the wave
of revolution sweeping Africa,
Asia and South America — are
beyond student control and fre
quently beyond our still limited
understanding.

• Second-Rate School
Editor, The Daily:
Stanford University's 'leap to
greatness' would be better
termed 'stumbling mediocrity'.
The so-called 'Harvard of the
West' is guilty of the following
cardinal sins:
• Blatant religious discrimi
nation (for over seventy years):
for refusing (as recently as one
week ago) to let Jews hold ser
vices on campus other than in
a gaudy Christian church whose
symbology is offensive even to
many campus Christians.
• Obsequious kowtowing to
alumni criticism: for suspending
a Freshman athlete from the
track team because his hair was
too long and thus offended a
few well-heeled alumni.
• Giving academic credit for
soldier courses (ROTC), the aca
demic content of which has been
controversial at best.
• Having a sloppily cata
logued and even more sloppily
run main library. A first-class
library is the sine qua non of a
great university. There is no
question where that leaves Stan
ford.
Like some people, Stanford is
more concerned with its image
than with itself. Are not all of
these unmistakable signs of a
second-rate university?

•Arrive? Never!
Editor, The Dally:
The Freshman Daily (May 17)
was very interesting, but in
some ways disconcerting.
After reading about Wilbur,
Civ, the personal voice in En
glish and any number of other
editorials about how freshmen
look at things, two disturbing
comments stood out most in my
mind: first, that of the Roble
girl who said "I'd change no
thing . . . I'm crazy about every
aspect of this place," and even
more, the remarke from Art
Fisher's column entitled "Fresh
men: You Are Here—But When
Will You Arrive?" that "Kid,
you're just a little freshman and
you don't know what's happen
ing."
Despite the risk of sounding
like someone who is ready to
solve the world's problems at the
end of the freshman year, I
think that both these comments
miss one of the most vitally im
portant attitudes one can ever
hope to cultivate: that of con
sructive dissatisfaction.
No society, such as Stanford
University, is so good that every
aspect of it should remain un
changed; Mr. Fisher's article re
flects the same absence of con
structive dissatisfaction as the
freshman comment, but in a
much more serious way. I ques
tion whether the senior who
would say to a freshman or any
other student, silently or other
wise, that "Kid, you're just a
little freshman and don't know
what's happening'' doesn't have
a very good idea himself of the
changes he has undergone dur
ing his four years at Stanford.
"Freshmen: You Are Here—
But When Will You Arrive?" ex
horts Mr. Fisher. I don't want
to arrive, if that means that at
the end of my senior year, I'll
think that I realize all the im
plications of my college experi
ences. I'm glad to be a fresh
man, just as I'll be glad to be a
sophomore, junior, and senior.
Because for every mistake 1
make this year, there was some
thing learned about myself or
others that was so valuable that
I was glad to be wrong in the
learning, so long as I learned.
Mr. Fisher tells us freshmen
that when we are seniors, we
will have changed and when we
realize that, we "will have made
it." He says further that until
we have made this realization,
"It's all Frosh Week until then."
Does he mean that to imply that
when we are seniors, we will
know what it's all about?
I hope not, and I think not.
If my ideas are idealistic, they
do not ignore experience. If be
ing a freshman means a little
bungling through life and some
realizations of ignorance, I'm
glad to be a freshman. I'm hap
py to know that I still have a lot
to learn, and that I always will;
I'm happy to know that I'll
never arrive.

• Rewarding Seminar
Editor, The Daily:
Because the Freshman Semi
nar program (discussed in May
17's Freshman Edition of The
Daily) is made up of unique
groups of individuals studying
relatively unrelated topics, it is
practically impossible to make
general statements about the
program as a whole.
By taking part in one of these
groups ("Modern Ballads and
Their Backgrounds" with Profes
sor Claude Simpson), I enjoyed
a wide exchange of knowledge
injected with personal theories.
That is, I found a high level of
intra-group communication of
specialized educational value
which both illustrated back
ground research and opened wide
the gates for individual study.
I left the seminar with what
I feel is an enlightened curiosity,
a feeling of accomplishment and
potential, and a knowledge
which I have found both enjoy
able and practical. I consider
this participation in the Fresh
man Seminar program one of
my most rewarding experiences
at Stanford.

• Common Standards
Editor, The Daily:
So you received ten letters
backing the position of Pat Mor
rison, who refused to co-operate
with his track coach when asked
to have his lovely locks trimmed.
Well, here is one letter which
does not back either Pat or you.
To a grown man—it appears
as perfectly silly that such ac
tions are so important. Pat
must conform to some common
standards. He wears pants,
doesn't he?
I have had more friends who
never attended Stanford kid me
about the situation. They get
lots of laughs out of you "kids."
We Stanford alumni really take
a beating because of the child
ish antics of a very few stu
dents.
This is written in the thought
you might appreciate knowing
how most of we old timers feel.
Please, don't follow Berkeley's
example!
ROY F. REINEMAN,
Covlna, Calif.
Editor, The Daily:
Stanford's first sit-in is now
history. If it is to be remem
bered at all, it will be remember
ed as a dismal failure; it could
not have been anything else.
Speaking as one who is sympa
thetic with the goals of the
"New Left" and the anti-Viet
nam war movements, I would
like to offer a few. thoughts as
to why the sit-in was doomed
from the start.
The technique of the sit-in
(at least in this generation) de
veloped out of the civil rights
movement in the South and has
been exported to other areas and
issues largely by those active
in the civil rights movement.
Yet the conditions under which
the technique succeeded in the
South were perhaps more im
portant to the success of the
movement than the sit-in tech
nique itself. It is this lesson
which the Stanford sit-in ig
nored.
• Non-violent civil disobedi
ence is an appeal to the public
conscience—not a method of co
ercing an individual.
• As an appeal to the public
conscience, it must carry such
moral justification as to over
come the democratic presump
tion against extra-legal meth
ods of protest.
• Moral justification and the
pragmatic concern for expedi
ency and utility cannot totally
be separated. These factors
which, under given circum
star e c will make the sit-in
~ble ? i compelling will
>r iQ Iso to -ake it morally
justiaJble—and vill make the
moral justification apparent to
the larger society.
a. Civil disobedience should
be used only when all other
existing remedies have been
exhausted; when every tradi
tional approach has been tried
and found wanting. Why did
the protesters' overwhelming
demand to have the Selective
Service test cancelled manifest
itself only days before the test
was scheduled? Would anyone
expect the faculty or adminis
tration to act on such short
notice when the tests had been
scheduled publicly for months?
Wasn't the impression con
veyed to the student body that
the demonstrators' moral re
vulsion to the test had ma
terialized overnight?
b. The goal of a sit-in must
be capable of precise and con
sistent articulation. Such was
the goal of the Southern civil
rights demonstrations. They
were demanding the right to
be free from specific forms of
racial discrimination — rights
guaranteed to them by the
Federal Constitution. What
was the goal of the Stanford
sit-in? Was it the complicity
of the University in the Selec
tive Service System? Such
complicity is wrong only if the
Selective Service System is
wrong. Was the System wrong
because it discriminated in fav
or of upper middle-class col
lege students? If so, were the
demonstrators calling for uni
versal military training, aboli
tion of conscription, or some
intermediate course? Did they
oppose the test simply on the
grounds that it aided the im
moral war in Vietnam? If the
war itself is immoral, can one
be criticized for preferring a
student exemption to the risk
of being sent to kill those who
we have no right to kij'?
The sit-in was a failure be
cause it was conducted without
regard to the essential nature
and function of civil disobedi
ence.

• Unfortunate
Approach
Editor, The Daily:
The demonstrators picketing
President Sterling's office pro
testing the use of Stanford as a
Selective Service Examination
Center are using this contro
versy to register their opposition
to the Draft in general and to
United States policy in the Viet
nam war. It is unfortunate that
this partcular even should have
been chosen as the vehicle of
protest, for it has resulted in a
conflict of the principles of the
demonstrators themselves and
has offended rather than merely
awakened a large number of
the Stanford men who consider
it a great convenience to be able
to take the examination on cam
pus.
Many of these demonstrators
are among those who are de
manding the right to be able to
obtain contraceptives from the
University Health Service, vet
these same students would deny
others the right to take the
Draft test on campus, if they so
desire. These particular protest
ers are demanding one right
while denying another. The con
traceptive question may not be
totally analagous to the Draft
test controversy, but neverthe
less, these demonstrators should
maintain some degree of consis
tency in their beliefs and actions
if they wish to avoid being la
beled hypocrites.

I would strongly urge these
protesting students, if they sin
cerely desire greater acceptance
of their ideas and values, to dis
continue this particular type of
demonstration which can only
do harm to the concepts they
stand for in the long run.

• Wrongly Directed
Editor, The Daily:
Thursday night during dinner,
mimeographed sheets were dis
tributed in the Wilbur dining
rooms, requesting support for a
vigil in President Sterling's of
fice. The expressed purpose of
this vigil was to "demand our
rights ... to enjoin the Univer
sity from cooperating with and
endorsing a rotten (sic) system
by giving the next deferment
test." We do not object to these
students expressing their views.
We do, however, feel that they
are protesting in the wrong
place and to the wrong person.
The draft test was given on a
voluntary basis. In making avail
able classroom space, we feel
that President Sterling was
merely cooperating with student
desire for a convenient place to
take the test. In doing this, nei
ther he nor the University was
"giving" nor necessarily "en
dorsing" these exams, as was
maintained by those sponsoring
the vigil. The test was given by
the Selective Service, to only
those students who, having con
sidered all alternatives, chose to
take it. If everyone has the right
to decide for himself whether to
take the test, those who do want
to should certainly be able to
take it at a convenient location.
Legitimate protest of the draft
policy should be directed to those
directly responsible—to the Se
lective Service—and not to the
President of the University.

• Praising Wert
Editor, The Daily:
A large number of students
counter-demonstrating in front
of President Sterling's office
were very favorably impressed
with Dean Wert's statement to
the sit-in protesters. The state
men made it abundantly clear
that President Sterling was will
ing to meet with five or six stu
dents in a private discussion;
privacy and the absence of news
media is a prerequisite for any
meaningful and intelligent dia
logue.
The protesters were given am
ple time to present their posi
tion through normal channels
(such as the Committee of Fif
teen) during the several months
since the draft exam at Stanford
was announced, but instead they
delayed action until one exam
had already been given.
The continuation of the sit-in
after Dean Wert's statement was
made served no purpose other
than obstructing normal activity
in the President's office, since
the draft exam would not be can
celled in spite of the demonstra
tors' effort to deny the right to
take the exam from those who
wished to take it.
The diciplinary action the pro
testers will receive has definite
ly been earned, and prompt ac
tion should be taken by the stu
dent judicial council.

• Activists Not Listening
Editor, The Daily:
I spoke to a youth who was
handing out mimeographed ma
terial on The Sit-in at the White
Memorial Plaza at noon on Mon
day, May 23. I asked him why he
was dressed in such an unkempt
way. He said that he liked it
that way. I replied that it was
offensive to me and I pointed
out to him that his feet were
very dirty. He answered that
that was because he was bare
foot. I suggested that he must
be quite young to be so careless
of his appearance and he admit
ted that he was very young. I
realize now that I should have
admonished this child to go
home to his mother.
In his editorial in The Stan
ford Daily of May 24, Mr. Roise
predicts a rise in student activ

ism at Stanford in 1966. Some of
us have been around the cam
pus for a long time. In fact we
have devoted most our lives to
Stanford students. Never under
estimate the power of a woman!
This is one woman, and there
are many faculty wives like me,
who will be active if necessary
next Fall. We will not permit a
small group of idealistic, but re
bellious and misguided adoles
cent beatniks led by graduate
Teaching Assistants, who state
that "actions of the faculty seem
to them to be an appalling in
dication of moral bankruptcy
and intellectual cowardice" to
wreck our university. If anyone
is guilty of not listening it is
the student activist. Perhaps the
dirt in his ears prevents him
from hearing.
My husband is not morally
bankrupt or an intellectual cow

• Teaching The Faculty
Editor, The Daily:
Now that the sit-in is over and
we can try to assess the respon
sibility for the breakdown in
communications that led to it, let
us not forget to include the re
sponsibility of the faculty. The
fact is that the students did
not act until the faculty had re
fused to act.
It has been said that the fac
ulty could not have considered
the problem of the draft at their
meeting last Tuesday because
they had spent so much time on
classified contracts. That is un
doubtedly true. But why did they
have to wait until last Tuesday
to consider the matter?
Professors at Brandeis raised
the issue more than two months
ago. And why did they have to
wait until last Tuesday to con
sider classified contracts? That
issue was raised last December
by the GCC Newsletter. Have the
faculty stopped reading the
newspapers?
In this situation the students
were very careful not to violate
faculty prerogatives. But it
seems that the faculty will not
consider issues until students
have violated those prerogatives.
Why should students have to
tell their teachers that they are
tacitly condoning a possible vio
lation of academic freedom?
Why should students have to
tell their teachers that they are
condoning the participation of
the University in what may be
an immoral system? But it
seems that students do have to
tell their teachers, and it seems
that they have to do it violently.
Maybe the faculty have learned
as much from this incident as
the rest of us hope to have
learned. But if not, I am afraid
that we can expect more sit-ins.
And maybe next time they will
be in the offices of the Executive
Committee of the Academic
Council.

• Showing Their Colors
Editor, Th<> Daily:
There is a final chapter to the
story of the draft protest, which
didn't make monday's Daily:
After the demonstrators had
left the President's office, and
had walked to his home to dis
cover that he was away for the
weekend, they returned to cam
pus by the quickest route, frater
nity row. Boys on the lawn of the
ATO house shouted "It would

take three of you chickenshits
to make one of us!" and other
things they thought appropriate
to the occasion.
Boys at the Beta Theta Pi and
Phi Gamma Delta houses follow
ed suit, with the more inventive
Betas running up to their bal
cony to bombard the tired pro
testers with water balloons.
This self-comment says more
about the fraternity "system"
than any outsider ever could.
MARLENE CHARYN

• Decision-Making
Editor, The Daily:
The recent sit-in in the office
of President Sterling served to
dramatize an issue of fundamen
tal and long-standing importance
to everyone at Stanford Univer
sity. Can Stanford University
become the community of schol
ars which it claims to be?
The events of the past week-

end have shown that we are far
from attaining this goal. The
lack of willingness to communi
cate on the part of the adminis
tration has never been as clear
ly evident than in the unilateral
decision to hold a draft test on
campus which raises serious
questions for all at the Univer
sity.
It has also been evident with
regard to the issues of social
regs, liquor and religion on
which the administration
evinced little or no desire to act
until the application of power
on the part of some other group
was imminent.
It is true that the committee
of fifteen, the revival of LASSU
as a meaningful decision-making
body, and student participation
on certain committees has im
proved the situation somewhat
in the past few years.
However the total unwilling
ness of the administration to
consult students and revise on
the question of the di'aft test
before and after the sit-in indi
cates that the basic problem
hasn't been solved.
The desire of the administra
tion to substitute power for dis
cussion in this instance raises
further questions — the stu
dents who sat in tried are about
to be tried for violation of the
fundamental standard.
In a genuine community, the
basic standard of conduct should
be applicable to all within it,
not just one segment of its pop
ulation. It is without a doubt
that the intransigence evidenced
by President Sterling hurt the
Stanford community at least as
much as the action taken and
persisted in by the students as a
result.
Who, however, is going to try
him for violation of a fundamen
tal standard?
If Stanford is ever to become
a community in any meaningful
sense, communication, rather
than power struggle must play
the major role in University de
cision-making.
In addition, any basic stand
ard of conduct which is adopted
should be made applicable to all.

• Art Of Persuasion
Editor, The
It seems to me that much of
the enlightened campus dialogue
regarding this country's involve

ment in Viet Nam is failing in
its intended goal of awakening
anti-war sentiment. One of the
most obvious and most easily
corrected reasons for the unper
suasiveness of this dialogue is
the stereotype "beatnik" image
which many of the activists
convey to the uninitiated pub
lic.
The long hair and sandals and
beards of many articulate stu
dents cannot help but subtract
from the overall appeal of their
arguments to an audience which
is generally unaccustomed to
looking beyond surface appear
ance. Moreover, the national
audience welcomes the oppor
tunity to stereotype the student
activist as "just another beard
ed mal content, probably a Com
munist, and maybe a homosex
ual." Stereotyping, though some
times helpful, in this case mere
ly relieves the public of the bur
densome task of critical evalua
tion, when critical evaluation is
just what the activists want to

promote.
The tendency to stereotype,
prevalent among the uneducated
and among some politicians, is
sad—even tragic. But, it is com
mon. To provide the undecided
citizen with such an effortless
escape from a confrontation
with the issue neither does jus
tice to the war, to the citizen,
nor to the Student Left.
Of course, most students feel
that personal freedom is the
basis of their protest. That in
cludes the freedom to dress ac
cording to individual choice.
Freedom seems to me to rank
second only to happiness in the
hierarchy of human values. To
voluntarily give up any freedom
is an act with grave political
and philosophical implications
and should by no means be done
lightly. However, a few people
are dedicated not only to living
in the world, but to making the
world a better place in which to
live. For these few the casual
exercise of every freedom may
be costly in terms of accom
plishment.
To understand that I am not
advocating conformity, the issue
of personal freedom must be
put into perspective. Now, if
sprinter Pat Morrison wants to
let his hair grow to an unusual
length, that's his business. He
isn't trying to convince anyone
to think, or by implication, to do
as he does. His hair is only his
business.
But, the political activists are
engaged in the art of persua
sion, and they are foolish if
they believe that their appeal
goes out to a purely logical pub
lic. The SCPV, it is true, is not
trying to set fashions in hair
style any more than Morrison,
but only the naive orator fails
to see the irrational association
between the content of speech
and the appearance of speaker.
The successful orator capitalizes
upon this fact.
To those who at this point re
mind me that the student move
ment is also a protest against
ignorance and irrationality, not
a concession to it, I ask that
they refer that reminder to the
student leaders, who conceive
their own role and the role of
the university as one of leader
ship. How can there be leader
ship without a following?
It is an imperfect world where
certain personal freedoms, like
the freedom to express oneself
through the choice of clothes or

hair style, must be inhibited in
order to further some other
freedoms, like the freedom to
compete equally for public senti
ment alongside the models of
middleclass values. Those lead
ers who recognize the necessity
of coming out of the philosophi
cal ivory tower to establish con
tact with a non-philosophical
world should see this compro
mise as the least of many evils.
Some, obviously, refuse to
make that compromise. It seems
to me that their unwillingness
to compromise sheds some light
on the sincerity of their com
mitment to the goal of peace in
Viet Nam.

• Conflicting Demands
Editor, The Daily:
A basic contradiction emerges
in two of the recent protest
movements here at Stanford.
The SSRF wishes the univer
sity to supply contraceptives to
anyone who wants them with
the idea that each student would
then be able to make his (her)
own moral decision. That's fine.
But now the most recent
group proposes exactly the op
posite: that the individual stu
dent should not be allowed by
his individual choice (whether
moral or otherwise) to take the
selective service draft test on
university proper. This same
group indicts the faculty as a
unit for not supporting students
in a (now) redefined cause of
student particiaption in decision
making. This is truly an inter
esting case, since the decision
to hold a draft test was hardly
made at Building 10.
More student involvement in
decision making is certainly
needed at Stanford, but the re
cent draft test is a pretty weak
issue to identify it wih.
PHIL ARNOLD
• October Days
Editor, The Daily:
In trying to see the current
student unrest - administration
intransigence difficulties from a
point of view somewhere be
yond the heat of the conflict,
I am struck by one overriding
concern: What methods are ap
propriate to the solution of prob
lems that arise within a com
munity of scholars and their
students?
It seems to me that the most
appropriate methods would be
those which are the hallmark of
any thinking community: reas
on, definition, articulation, and
dialogue. This must be the case
so long as all protagonists are
concerned with preserving the
"community."
The present situation at Stan
ford, from this point of view, is
pretty dismal. The student lead
ers prefer to posit these delicate
issues concerning government
university, war-university, draft
university in the streets. The ad
ministration prefers to ignore
the problem, to be consistently
absent.
As the scene becomes increas
ingly dichotomized, as the pro
tagonists at either extreme ac
celerate the process of detach
ment from one another, cutting
lines of rational communication,
throwing up impenetrable walls
of opaque verbiage of absolutely
no use if dialogue is really de
sider between the extremes, the
possibility of clearly raising and
effectively solving these prob
lems becomes impossible.
Rather than a community of
scholars and students, this scene
is more reminiscent of Petro
grad in the spring of 3917. So
far, the problem, clumsily de
fined even in the pamphlets and
fly-leaves of those who have
raised it, has been articulated
in the manner of peasant muni
tion workers, through slogans at
best, through shouting rallies in
the streets at worst.
And the problem has been
met by an administration unwill
ing to admit the gravity of the
situation, as yet unable to think
out the problem or to take ag
gressively positive measures to
assess the nature of the student
demands and to land on a pro
gram of action which will insure
that the university will not
have to depend on the delicacy
of crowds in White Plaza to
solve these involved and intri
cate issues.
The problem with the bread
riots in Petrograd in 1917 is not
that they were an ineffective
expression of workers' and peas
ants' extreme discontent, but
that they were able to express
only this negative sentiment in
the absence of other viable
channels of communication. And
the problem with the Russian
Provisional Government in 1917
is not that it was a bad govern
ment, but that it was no gov
ernment at all. What can we ex
pect from next October?

• 'If Its Pressed
Editor, The Daily:
Hooray for the emerging Stan
ford. Down with ambivalent dou
ble-standards, bumbling bureau
cracy, and the multiversity-in
dustrial-military behemoth. Since

the election of "artistic social
ist" Dave Harris, Stanford has
made radical progress in identi
fying and confronting the real
issues. First, that bastion of in
trigue, the Electrical Engineer
ing Department, was identified
as a cover, albeit in the open,
for the monstrous CIA. Tlien
came the revelation of the blood
thirsty anti-intelectuallism of
the ROTC. This week, finally,
we're getting to the basic issue,
elimination of the "parentis
pocis" routine with the need
made obvious by the Athletic De
partment. It should be readily
apparent that the length of one's
hair is a private matter and
doesn't even require the "mu
tual consent" of the SSRF.
Furthermore, this leads im
mediately to a more basic issue,
the rights of the Stanford Dollie.
The restrictions on "Quad
clothes," actual and imagined,
must be eliminated. What right
has the University to impose its
ideas of contemporary dress
when such regulations obviously
contribute nothing to intellectual
attainment. Each person should
be free, at least in a university,
to be comfortable, to experi
ment, and to investigate various
modes of thought and apparel.
To the comment that the dis
traction of the Stanford males
by bikini-clad or even topless
damsels would be destructive to
their intellectual endeavors, I
say that this is merely a chal
lenge to the teachers. If their
teaching is stimulating enough,
who need watch the girls. After
all, we're here for an education,
not an eyeful.
Besides, think of the health
benefits. What could be more
American than taking in a little
sun on the way to class. Why
the reduction of auto accidents
involving students rushing back
from northern beaches and bars
alone should make everyone
wish the immediate elimination
of this childish regulation!
In keeping with the campaign
a number of slogans have been
suggested. "If It's Pressed, Don't
Wear It." "Be Comfortable,
Stimulate a Professor." And of
course, you can make up your
own.
I urge one and all to take up
this issue because at the rate
we're going there won't be many
worthy issues left.

• Bad Influence
Editor, The Daily:
I agree with Terry Inch, class
of '61, (The Daily, May 23) that
it's highly unfortunate that only
40 percent of the student body
voted in the last election. How
ever, I feel sure that even if 100
percent had voted, Dave Harris
still would have won by a fair
margin.
To find the true reasons for
Dave's victory you will have to
look a little deeper than at just
the size of the electorate. You
will have to look at the forces
which led Stanford students to
vote for a rebel.
As a freshman I know that
one of the strongest influences
on my classmates is that of the
Wilbur Sponsors. I realize gen
eralizations are not always fair,
but the majority of the sponsors
I've met are radical, whether
outspoken like Dave or not.
What's more, because of admin
istration concessions, the Wil
bur Sponsors have remained a
self-perpetuating group; thus,
they will continue to impress
their radical ideas on freshmen.
This leads to the real ques
tion, who influences the spon
sors? More generally, who in
fluences Stanford students? Ob
viously the faculty, and many,
many members of the faculty
are radical. Again, I have to
speak from experience.
At the beginning of second
quarter, my mathematics class
was dismissed by Mr. Kowalski
because he refused to teach in
the ROTC building. Last Friday
I saw my first quarter English
TA, Mr. Addams, sitting on
President Sterling's window sill,
encouraging the anti-draft dem
onstrators,
Certainly these two examples
are extreme, but they suggest
what is often a more subtle radi
calism imposed on students by a
large section of the faculty. In
fact, I'm sure that many of the
"free thinkers" who voted for
Dave were merely reflecting
their instructors' ideas.
As an afterthought, contrary
to the recent article in Western
Politica, some intellectuals are
not liberal. If you want to see
a different kind of professor
molding (is there a better
word?) Stanford students, Mr.
Inch, it is your right and your
duty as a donating alumnus to
demand a change on The Farm,

• Development
Program
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to suggest that
the proposals of Dave Harris
et. al. be viewed as an attempted


"First, Premier Ky, you must learn the principles of democracy ..
community development pro
gram—an attempt at an altera
tion of the public culture of the
University with the intent of
transforming the way that the
members feel about themselves.
Cooperation and suggestions
in this attempt might focus
upon the evident need of increas
ing the opportunities of the
members of the community for
self-realization. This increased
opportunity should be available
to the students in their search
for life-models in a period of
transition, to the faculty in
their goal of transmitting the
excitement of intellecual discov
ery and of providing models of
another culture (subculture if
you will) and to the administra
tors in their role of providing
the resources and settings best
facilitating the attainment of
community goals.
The attempts to reformulate
student identity and to increase
the participation of students in
shaping a better order should
be recognized as legitimate ef
forts to deal with the frustra
tions of the present environ
ment. This normative position
rests ultimately on a personal
philosophy of education but
justification is offered in terms
of public goals and norms.
Present student frustrations
have their basis in the depart
mentalization of knowledge and
in the isolation of classroom
learning from personal develop
ment. (See Joseph Katz and
Nevitt Sanford for doubts on
this score.)
These are not by any means
the sole characteristics of uni
versity organization and opera

tion which contribute to the
process of turning excited, hope
ful freshmen into pragmatic,
other-directed, what-good-is-this
academic-crud upperclassmen.
What might lead one to ex
tend the participation hypothe
sis beyond the confines of the
psych lab to the larger commun
ity?
Dare we think that cultural
dynamics are not restricted to
primitive societies but operate
in the very Quad itself? Do we
recognize that the operation of
the present academic process
functions more to alert the sub
jects of the operations to the
idiosyncratic cues of high status
people — instilling a life-goal of
meeting environmental tests of
personal worth rather than to
invoke and inspire a search for
truth and a life-goal of self-ex
tending creativity?
If we can see past the wishful
thoughts and the socially ap
proved nice-things-to-say, per
haps we can recognize that a call
to a new identity is a legitimate
and reasonable response to exist
ing conditions.
But to be successful, "there
must be commitment to the
change, and others must accord
it recognition and do all the
things needed to reinforce and
consolidate it so that a sense of
new identity can actually be at
tained (Ward Goodenough, 1963,
p. 291.)
DENNIS J SIMS
• A Dungeon ?
Editor, The Daily:
In response to Allan Christe
low's letter of May 20th, I be
lieve that Stanford is justified
in calling itself a university,

meaning that Stanford is at
least as much of a university as
Berkeley, Harvard, or Oxford.
Stanford may not measure up
to Mr. Christelows' "ideal"
standards, but then again, many
of us have different conceptions
of the ideal.
I do not feel that Stanford is
perfect, that Stanford should
be controlled Ry outside alumni
pressure, that students should
be made to conform to some
clean-cut image, or that ROTC
students should be coerced into
donating their blood. However,
simply because we have several
problems in the university, this
does not mean that Stanford is
leading American society "down
the road to infamy."
In previous years, Stanford
students have been active in civil
rights work, the Peace Corps,
the Ravenswood tutorial, num
erous work projects, Vista, and
assorted student political orga
nizations.
Mr. Christelow cannot fairly
argue that Stanford students are
apathetic and uncritical. Stu
dents do take an interest in the
"harsh reality of the outside
world," and they have made
honest attempts to improve it.
Some of the credit for motivat
ing student activity belongs to
Sanford University as it now
exists in its, admittedly, imper
fect form.
Stanford is not the stultify
ing dungeon that Mr. Christelow
describes, nor is it a factory for
the production of machine parts.
It has been used as a vantage
point from wihch students have
re-evaluated many aspects of
the "surrounding world."
Unfortunately, many students
often become frustrated, per
haps like Mr. Christelow, when
they realize that the really big
problem of our age—the possi
bility of world war and the wave
of revolution sweeping Africa,
Asia and South America — are
beyond student control and fre
quently beyond our still limited
understanding.

• Second-Rate School
Editor, The Daily:
Stanford University's 'leap to
greatness' would be better
termed 'stumbling mediocrity'.
The so-called 'Harvard of the
West' is guilty of the following
cardinal sins:
• Blatant religious discrimi
nation (for over seventy years):
for refusing (as recently as one
week ago) to let Jews hold ser
vices on campus other than in
a gaudy Christian church whose
symbology is offensive even to
many campus Christians.
• Obsequious kowtowing to
alumni criticism: for suspending
a Freshman athlete from the
track team because his hair was
too long and thus offended a
few well-heeled alumni.
• Giving academic credit for
soldier courses (ROTC), the aca
demic content of which has been
controversial at best.
• Having a sloppily cata
logued and even more sloppily
run main library. A first-class
library is the sine qua non of a
great university. There is no
question where that leaves Stan
ford.
Like some people, Stanford is
more concerned with its image
than with itself. Are not all of
these unmistakable signs of a
second-rate university?

•Arrive? Never!
Editor, The Dally:
The Freshman Daily (May 17)
was very interesting, but in
some ways disconcerting.
After reading about Wilbur,
Civ, the personal voice in En
glish and any number of other
editorials about how freshmen
look at things, two disturbing
comments stood out most in my
mind: first, that of the Roble
girl who said "I'd change no
thing . . . I'm crazy about every
aspect of this place," and even
more, the remarke from Art
Fisher's column entitled "Fresh
men: You Are Here—But When
Will You Arrive?" that "Kid,
you're just a little freshman and
you don't know what's happen
ing."
Despite the risk of sounding
like someone who is ready to
solve the world's problems at the
end of the freshman year, I
think that both these comments
miss one of the most vitally im
portant attitudes one can ever
hope to cultivate: that of con
sructive dissatisfaction.
No society, such as Stanford
University, is so good that every
aspect of it should remain un
changed; Mr. Fisher's article re
flects the same absence of con
structive dissatisfaction as the
freshman comment, but in a
much more serious way. I ques
tion whether the senior who
would say to a freshman or any
other student, silently or other
wise, that "Kid, you're just a
little freshman and don't know
what's happening'' doesn't have
a very good idea himself of the
changes he has undergone dur
ing his four years at Stanford.
"Freshmen: You Are Here—
But When Will You Arrive?" ex
horts Mr. Fisher. I don't want
to arrive, if that means that at
the end of my senior year, I'll
think that I realize all the im
plications of my college experi
ences. I'm glad to be a fresh
man, just as I'll be glad to be a
sophomore, junior, and senior.
Because for every mistake 1
make this year, there was some
thing learned about myself or
others that was so valuable that
I was glad to be wrong in the
learning, so long as I learned.
Mr. Fisher tells us freshmen
that when we are seniors, we
will have changed and when we
realize that, we "will have made
it." He says further that until
we have made this realization,
"It's all Frosh Week until then."
Does he mean that to imply that
when we are seniors, we will
know what it's all about?
I hope not, and I think not.
If my ideas are idealistic, they
do not ignore experience. If be
ing a freshman means a little
bungling through life and some
realizations of ignorance, I'm
glad to be a freshman. I'm hap
py to know that I still have a lot
to learn, and that I always will;
I'm happy to know that I'll
never arrive.

• Rewarding Seminar
Editor, The Daily:
Because the Freshman Semi
nar program (discussed in May
17's Freshman Edition of The
Daily) is made up of unique
groups of individuals studying
relatively unrelated topics, it is
practically impossible to make
general statements about the
program as a whole.
By taking part in one of these
groups ("Modern Ballads and
Their Backgrounds" with Profes
sor Claude Simpson), I enjoyed
a wide exchange of knowledge
injected with personal theories.
That is, I found a high level of
intra-group communication of
specialized educational value
which both illustrated back
ground research and opened wide
the gates for individual study.
I left the seminar with what
I feel is an enlightened curiosity,
a feeling of accomplishment and
potential, and a knowledge
which I have found both enjoy
able and practical. I consider
this participation in the Fresh
man Seminar program one of
my most rewarding experiences
at Stanford.

• Common Standards
Editor, The Daily:
So you received ten letters
backing the position of Pat Mor
rison, who refused to co-operate
with his track coach when asked
to have his lovely locks trimmed.
Well, here is one letter which
does not back either Pat or you.
To a grown man—it appears
as perfectly silly that such ac
tions are so important. Pat
must conform to some common
standards. He wears pants,
doesn't he?
I have had more friends who
never attended Stanford kid me
about the situation. They get
lots of laughs out of you "kids."
We Stanford alumni really take
a beating because of the child
ish antics of a very few stu
dents.
This is written in the thought
you might appreciate knowing
how most of we old timers feel.
Please, don't follow Berkeley's
example!
ROY F. REINEMAN,
Covlna, Calif.
Editor, The Daily:
Stanford's first sit-in is now
history. If it is to be remem
bered at all, it will be remember
ed as a dismal failure; it could
not have been anything else.
Speaking as one who is sympa
thetic with the goals of the
"New Left" and the anti-Viet
nam war movements, I would
like to offer a few. thoughts as
to why the sit-in was doomed
from the start.
The technique of the sit-in
(at least in this generation) de
veloped out of the civil rights
movement in the South and has
been exported to other areas and
issues largely by those active
in the civil rights movement.
Yet the conditions under which
the technique succeeded in the
South were perhaps more im
portant to the success of the
movement than the sit-in tech
nique itself. It is this lesson
which the Stanford sit-in ig
nored.
• Non-violent civil disobedi
ence is an appeal to the public
conscience—not a method of co
ercing an individual.
• As an appeal to the public
conscience, it must carry such
moral justification as to over
come the democratic presump
tion against extra-legal meth
ods of protest.
• Moral justification and the
pragmatic concern for expedi
ency and utility cannot totally
be separated. These factors
which, under given circum
star e c will make the sit-in
~ble ? i compelling will
>r iQ Iso to -ake it morally
justiaJble—and vill make the
moral justification apparent to
the larger society.
a. Civil disobedience should
be used only when all other
existing remedies have been
exhausted; when every tradi
tional approach has been tried
and found wanting. Why did
the protesters' overwhelming
demand to have the Selective
Service test cancelled manifest
itself only days before the test
was scheduled? Would anyone
expect the faculty or adminis
tration to act on such short
notice when the tests had been
scheduled publicly for months?
Wasn't the impression con
veyed to the student body that
the demonstrators' moral re
vulsion to the test had ma
terialized overnight?
b. The goal of a sit-in must
be capable of precise and con
sistent articulation. Such was
the goal of the Southern civil
rights demonstrations. They
were demanding the right to
be free from specific forms of
racial discrimination — rights
guaranteed to them by the
Federal Constitution. What
was the goal of the Stanford
sit-in? Was it the complicity
of the University in the Selec
tive Service System? Such
complicity is wrong only if the
Selective Service System is
wrong. Was the System wrong
because it discriminated in fav
or of upper middle-class col
lege students? If so, were the
demonstrators calling for uni
versal military training, aboli
tion of conscription, or some
intermediate course? Did they
oppose the test simply on the
grounds that it aided the im
moral war in Vietnam? If the
war itself is immoral, can one
be criticized for preferring a
student exemption to the risk
of being sent to kill those who
we have no right to kij'?
The sit-in was a failure be
cause it was conducted without
regard to the essential nature
and function of civil disobedi
ence.

• Unfortunate
Approach
Editor, The Daily:
The demonstrators picketing
President Sterling's office pro
testing the use of Stanford as a
Selective Service Examination
Center are using this contro
versy to register their opposition
to the Draft in general and to
United States policy in the Viet
nam war. It is unfortunate that
this partcular even should have
been chosen as the vehicle of
protest, for it has resulted in a
conflict of the principles of the
demonstrators themselves and
has offended rather than merely
awakened a large number of
the Stanford men who consider
it a great convenience to be able
to take the examination on cam
pus.
Many of these demonstrators
are among those who are de
manding the right to be able to
obtain contraceptives from the
University Health Service, vet
these same students would deny
others the right to take the
Draft test on campus, if they so
desire. These particular protest
ers are demanding one right
while denying another. The con
traceptive question may not be
totally analagous to the Draft
test controversy, but neverthe
less, these demonstrators should
maintain some degree of consis
tency in their beliefs and actions
if they wish to avoid being la
beled hypocrites.

I would strongly urge these
protesting students, if they sin
cerely desire greater acceptance
of their ideas and values, to dis
continue this particular type of
demonstration which can only
do harm to the concepts they
stand for in the long run.

• Wrongly Directed
Editor, The Daily:
Thursday night during dinner,
mimeographed sheets were dis
tributed in the Wilbur dining
rooms, requesting support for a
vigil in President Sterling's of
fice. The expressed purpose of
this vigil was to "demand our
rights ... to enjoin the Univer
sity from cooperating with and
endorsing a rotten (sic) system
by giving the next deferment
test." We do not object to these
students expressing their views.
We do, however, feel that they
are protesting in the wrong
place and to the wrong person.
The draft test was given on a
voluntary basis. In making avail
able classroom space, we feel
that President Sterling was
merely cooperating with student
desire for a convenient place to
take the test. In doing this, nei
ther he nor the University was
"giving" nor necessarily "en
dorsing" these exams, as was
maintained by those sponsoring
the vigil. The test was given by
the Selective Service, to only
those students who, having con
sidered all alternatives, chose to
take it. If everyone has the right
to decide for himself whether to
take the test, those who do want
to should certainly be able to
take it at a convenient location.
Legitimate protest of the draft
policy should be directed to those
directly responsible—to the Se
lective Service—and not to the
President of the University.

• Praising Wert
Editor, The Daily:
A large number of students
counter-demonstrating in front
of President Sterling's office
were very favorably impressed
with Dean Wert's statement to
the sit-in protesters. The state
men made it abundantly clear
that President Sterling was will
ing to meet with five or six stu
dents in a private discussion;
privacy and the absence of news
media is a prerequisite for any
meaningful and intelligent dia
logue.
The protesters were given am
ple time to present their posi
tion through normal channels
(such as the Committee of Fif
teen) during the several months
since the draft exam at Stanford
was announced, but instead they
delayed action until one exam
had already been given.
The continuation of the sit-in
after Dean Wert's statement was
made served no purpose other
than obstructing normal activity
in the President's office, since
the draft exam would not be can
celled in spite of the demonstra
tors' effort to deny the right to
take the exam from those who
wished to take it.
The diciplinary action the pro
testers will receive has definite
ly been earned, and prompt ac
tion should be taken by the stu
dent judicial council.

• Activists Not Listening
Editor, The Daily:
I spoke to a youth who was
handing out mimeographed ma
terial on The Sit-in at the White
Memorial Plaza at noon on Mon
day, May 23. I asked him why he
was dressed in such an unkempt
way. He said that he liked it
that way. I replied that it was
offensive to me and I pointed
out to him that his feet were
very dirty. He answered that
that was because he was bare
foot. I suggested that he must
be quite young to be so careless
of his appearance and he admit
ted that he was very young. I
realize now that I should have
admonished this child to go
home to his mother.
In his editorial in The Stan
ford Daily of May 24, Mr. Roise
predicts a rise in student activ

ism at Stanford in 1966. Some of
us have been around the cam
pus for a long time. In fact we
have devoted most our lives to
Stanford students. Never under
estimate the power of a woman!
This is one woman, and there
are many faculty wives like me,
who will be active if necessary
next Fall. We will not permit a
small group of idealistic, but re
bellious and misguided adoles
cent beatniks led by graduate
Teaching Assistants, who state
that "actions of the faculty seem
to them to be an appalling in
dication of moral bankruptcy
and intellectual cowardice" to
wreck our university. If anyone
is guilty of not listening it is
the student activist. Perhaps the
dirt in his ears prevents him
from hearing.

• Teaching The Faculty
Editor, The Daily:
Now that the sit-in is over and
we can try to assess the respon
sibility for the breakdown in
communications that led to it, let
us not forget to include the re
sponsibility of the faculty. The
fact is that the students did
not act until the faculty had re
fused to act.
It has been said that the fac
ulty could not have considered
the problem of the draft at their
meeting last Tuesday because
they had spent so much time on
classified contracts. That is un
doubtedly true. But why did they
have to wait until last Tuesday
to consider the matter?
Professors at Brandeis raised
the issue more than two months
ago. And why did they have to
wait until last Tuesday to con
sider classified contracts? That
issue was raised last December
by the GCC Newsletter. Have the
faculty stopped reading the
newspapers?
In this situation the students
were very careful not to violate
faculty prerogatives. But it
seems that the faculty will not
consider issues until students
have violated those prerogatives.
Why should students have to
tell their teachers that they are
tacitly condoning a possible vio
lation of academic freedom?
Why should students have to
tell their teachers that they are
condoning the participation of
the University in what may be
an immoral system? But it
seems that students do have to
tell their teachers, and it seems
that they have to do it violently.
Maybe the faculty have learned
as much from this incident as
the rest of us hope to have
learned. But if not, I am afraid
that we can expect more sit-ins.
And maybe next time they will
be in the offices of the Executive
Committee of the Academic
Council.

• Showing Their Colors
Editor, Th<> Daily:
There is a final chapter to the
story of the draft protest, which
didn't make monday's Daily:
After the demonstrators had
left the President's office, and
had walked to his home to dis
cover that he was away for the
weekend, they returned to cam
pus by the quickest route, frater
nity row. Boys on the lawn of the
ATO house shouted "It would

take three of you chickenshits
to make one of us!" and other
things they thought appropriate
to the occasion.
Boys at the Beta Theta Pi and
Phi Gamma Delta houses follow
ed suit, with the more inventive
Betas running up to their bal
cony to bombard the tired pro
testers with water balloons.
This self-comment says more
about the fraternity "system"
than any outsider ever could.

• Decision-Making
Editor, The Daily:
The recent sit-in in the office
of President Sterling served to
dramatize an issue of fundamen
tal and long-standing importance
to everyone at Stanford Univer
sity. Can Stanford University
become the community of schol
ars which it claims to be?
The events of the past week-

end have shown that we are far
from attaining this goal. The
lack of willingness to communi
cate on the part of the adminis
tration has never been as clear
ly evident than in the unilateral
decision to hold a draft test on
campus which raises serious
questions for all at the Univer
sity.
It has also been evident with
regard to the issues of social
regs, liquor and religion on
which the administration
evinced little or no desire to act
until the application of power
on the part of some other group
was imminent.
It is true that the committee
of fifteen, the revival of LASSU
as a meaningful decision-making
body, and student participation
on certain committees has im
proved the situation somewhat
in the past few years.
However the total unwilling
ness of the administration to
consult students and revise on
the question of the di'aft test
before and after the sit-in indi
cates that the basic problem
hasn't been solved.
The desire of the administra
tion to substitute power for dis
cussion in this instance raises
further questions — the stu
dents who sat in tried are about
to be tried for violation of the
fundamental standard.
In a genuine community, the
basic standard of conduct should
be applicable to all within it,
not just one segment of its pop
ulation. It is without a doubt
that the intransigence evidenced
by President Sterling hurt the
Stanford community at least as
much as the action taken and
persisted in by the students as a
result.
Who, however, is going to try
him for violation of a fundamen
tal standard?
If Stanford is ever to become
a community in any meaningful
sense, communication, rather
than power struggle must play
the major role in University de
cision-making.
In addition, any basic stand
ard of conduct which is adopted
should be made applicable to all.

• Art Of Persuasion
Editor, The
It seems to me that much of
the enlightened campus dialogue
regarding this country's involve

ment in Viet Nam is failing in
its intended goal of awakening
anti-war sentiment. One of the
most obvious and most easily
corrected reasons for the unper
suasiveness of this dialogue is
the stereotype "beatnik" image
which many of the activists
convey to the uninitiated pub
lic.
The long hair and sandals and
beards of many articulate stu
dents cannot help but subtract
from the overall appeal of their
arguments to an audience which
is generally unaccustomed to
looking beyond surface appear
ance. Moreover, the national
audience welcomes the oppor
tunity to stereotype the student
activist as "just another beard
ed mal content, probably a Com
munist, and maybe a homosex
ual." Stereotyping, though some
times helpful, in this case mere
ly relieves the public of the bur
densome task of critical evalua
tion, when critical evaluation is
just what the activists want to

promote.
The tendency to stereotype,
prevalent among the uneducated
and among some politicians, is
sad—even tragic. But, it is com
mon. To provide the undecided
citizen with such an effortless
escape from a confrontation
with the issue neither does jus
tice to the war, to the citizen,
nor to the Student Left.
Of course, most students feel
that personal freedom is the
basis of their protest. That in
cludes the freedom to dress ac
cording to individual choice.
Freedom seems to me to rank
second only to happiness in the
hierarchy of human values. To
voluntarily give up any freedom
is an act with grave political
and philosophical implications
and should by no means be done
lightly. However, a few people
are dedicated not only to living
in the world, but to making the
world a better place in which to
live. For these few the casual
exercise of every freedom may
be costly in terms of accom
plishment.
To understand that I am not
advocating conformity, the issue
of personal freedom must be
put into perspective. Now, if
sprinter Pat Morrison wants to
let his hair grow to an unusual
length, that's his business. He
isn't trying to convince anyone
to think, or by implication, to do
as he does. His hair is only his
business.
But, the political activists are
engaged in the art of persua
sion, and they are foolish if
they believe that their appeal
goes out to a purely logical pub
lic. The SCPV, it is true, is not
trying to set fashions in hair
style any more than Morrison,
but only the naive orator fails
to see the irrational association
between the content of speech
and the appearance of speaker.
The successful orator capitalizes
upon this fact.
To those who at this point re
mind me that the student move
ment is also a protest against
ignorance and irrationality, not
a concession to it, I ask that
they refer that reminder to the
student leaders, who conceive
their own role and the role of
the university as one of leader
ship. How can there be leader
ship without a following?
It is an imperfect world where
certain personal freedoms, like
the freedom to express oneself
through the choice of clothes or

hair style, must be inhibited in
order to further some other
freedoms, like the freedom to
compete equally for public senti
ment alongside the models of
middleclass values. Those lead
ers who recognize the necessity
of coming out of the philosophi
cal ivory tower to establish con
tact with a non-philosophical
world should see this compro
mise as the least of many evils.
Some, obviously, refuse to
make that compromise. It seems
to me that their unwillingness
to compromise sheds some light
on the sincerity of their com
mitment to the goal of peace in
Viet Nam.
RON GARRISON
• Conflicting Demands
Editor, The Daily:
A basic contradiction emerges
in two of the recent protest
movements here at Stanford.
The SSRF wishes the univer
sity to supply contraceptives to
anyone who wants them with
the idea that each student would
then be able to make his (her)
own moral decision. That's fine.
But now the most recent
group proposes exactly the op
posite: that the individual stu
dent should not be allowed by
his individual choice (whether
moral or otherwise) to take the
selective service draft test on
university proper. This same
group indicts the faculty as a
unit for not supporting students
in a (now) redefined cause of
student particiaption in decision
making. This is truly an inter
esting case, since the decision
to hold a draft test was hardly
made at Building 10.
More student involvement in
decision making is certainly
needed at Stanford, but the re
cent draft test is a pretty weak
issue to identify it wih.
PHIL ARNOLD
• October Days
Editor, The Daily:
In trying to see the current
student unrest - administration
intransigence difficulties from a
point of view somewhere be
yond the heat of the conflict,
I am struck by one overriding
concern: What methods are ap
propriate to the solution of prob
lems that arise within a com
munity of scholars and their
students?
It seems to me that the most
appropriate methods would be
those which are the hallmark of
any thinking community: reas
on, definition, articulation, and
dialogue. This must be the case
so long as all protagonists are
concerned with preserving the
"community."
The present situation at Stan
ford, from this point of view, is
pretty dismal. The student lead
ers prefer to posit these delicate
issues concerning government
university, war-university, draft
university in the streets. The ad
ministration prefers to ignore
the problem, to be consistently
absent.
As the scene becomes increas
ingly dichotomized, as the pro
tagonists at either extreme ac
celerate the process of detach
ment from one another, cutting
lines of rational communication,
throwing up impenetrable walls
of opaque verbiage of absolutely
no use if dialogue is really de
sider between the extremes, the
possibility of clearly raising and
effectively solving these prob
lems becomes impossible.
Rather than a community of
scholars and students, this scene
is more reminiscent of Petro
grad in the spring of 3917. So
far, the problem, clumsily de
fined even in the pamphlets and
fly-leaves of those who have
raised it, has been articulated
in the manner of peasant muni
tion workers, through slogans at
best, through shouting rallies in
the streets at worst.
And the problem has been
met by an administration unwill
ing to admit the gravity of the
situation, as yet unable to think
out the problem or to take ag
gressively positive measures to
assess the nature of the student
demands and to land on a pro
gram of action which will insure
that the university will not
have to depend on the delicacy
of crowds in White Plaza to
solve these involved and intri
cate issues.
The problem with the bread
riots in Petrograd in 1917 is not
that they were an ineffective
expression of workers' and peas
ants' extreme discontent, but
that they were able to express
only this negative sentiment in
the absence of other viable
channels of communication. And
the problem with the Russian
Provisional Government in 1917
is not that it was a bad govern
ment, but that it was no gov
ernment at all. What can we ex
pect from next October?
ALAN KIMBALL

• 'If Its Pressed
Editor, The Daily:
Hooray for the emerging Stan
ford. Down with ambivalent dou
ble-standards, bumbling bureau
cracy, and the multiversity-in
dustrial-military behemoth. Since

the election of "artistic social
ist" Dave Harris, Stanford has
made radical progress in identi
fying and confronting the real
issues. First, that bastion of in
trigue, the Electrical Engineer
ing Department, was identified
as a cover, albeit in the open,
for the monstrous CIA. Tlien
came the revelation of the blood
thirsty anti-intelectuallism of
the ROTC. This week, finally,
we're getting to the basic issue,
elimination of the "parentis
pocis" routine with the need
made obvious by the Athletic De
partment. It should be readily
apparent that the length of one's
hair is a private matter and
doesn't even require the "mu
tual consent" of the SSRF.
Furthermore, this leads im
mediately to a more basic issue,
the rights of the Stanford Dollie.
The restrictions on "Quad
clothes," actual and imagined,
must be eliminated. What right
has the University to impose its
ideas of contemporary dress
when such regulations obviously
contribute nothing to intellectual
attainment. Each person should
be free, at least in a university,
to be comfortable, to experi
ment, and to investigate various
modes of thought and apparel.
To the comment that the dis
traction of the Stanford males
by bikini-clad or even topless
damsels would be destructive to
their intellectual endeavors, I
say that this is merely a chal
lenge to the teachers. If their
teaching is stimulating enough,
who need watch the girls. After
all, we're here for an education,
not an eyeful.
Besides, think of the health
benefits. What could be more
American than taking in a little
sun on the way to class. Why
the reduction of auto accidents
involving students rushing back
from northern beaches and bars
alone should make everyone
wish the immediate elimination
of this childish regulation!
In keeping with the campaign
a number of slogans have been
suggested. "If It's Pressed, Don't
Wear It." "Be Comfortable,
Stimulate a Professor." And of
course, you can make up your
own.
I urge one and all to take up
this issue because at the rate
we're going there won't be many
worthy issues left.

• Bad Influence
Editor, The Daily:
I agree with Terry Inch, class
of '61, (The Daily, May 23) that
it's highly unfortunate that only
40 percent of the student body
voted in the last election. How
ever, I feel sure that even if 100
percent had voted, Dave Harris
still would have won by a fair
margin.
To find the true reasons for
Dave's victory you will have to
look a little deeper than at just
the size of the electorate. You
will have to look at the forces
which led Stanford students to
vote for a rebel.
As a freshman I know that
one of the strongest influences
on my classmates is that of the
Wilbur Sponsors. I realize gen
eralizations are not always fair,
but the majority of the sponsors
I've met are radical, whether
outspoken like Dave or not.
What's more, because of admin
istration concessions, the Wil
bur Sponsors have remained a
self-perpetuating group; thus,
they will continue to impress
their radical ideas on freshmen.
This leads to the real ques
tion, who influences the spon
sors? More generally, who in
fluences Stanford students? Ob
viously the faculty, and many,
many members of the faculty
are radical. Again, I have to
speak from experience.
At the beginning of second
quarter, my mathematics class
was dismissed by Mr. Kowalski
because he refused to teach in
the ROTC building. Last Friday
I saw my first quarter English
TA, Mr. Addams, sitting on
President Sterling's window sill,
encouraging the anti-draft dem
onstrators,
Certainly these two examples
are extreme, but they suggest
what is often a more subtle radi
calism imposed on students by a
large section of the faculty. In
fact, I'm sure that many of the
"free thinkers" who voted for
Dave were merely reflecting
their instructors' ideas.
As an afterthought, contrary
to the recent article in Western
Politica, some intellectuals are
not liberal. If you want to see
a different kind of professor
molding (is there a better
word?) Stanford students, Mr.
Inch, it is your right and your
duty as a donating alumnus to
demand a change on The Farm,

• Development
Program
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to suggest that
the proposals of Dave Harris
et. al. be viewed as an attempted


"First, Premier Ky, you must learn the principles of democracy ..
community development pro
gram—an attempt at an altera
tion of the public culture of the
University with the intent of
transforming the way that the
members feel about themselves.
Cooperation and suggestions
in this attempt might focus
upon the evident need of increas
ing the opportunities of the
members of the community for
self-realization. This increased
opportunity should be available
to the students in their search
for life-models in a period of
transition, to the faculty in
their goal of transmitting the
excitement of intellecual discov
ery and of providing models of
another culture (subculture if
you will) and to the administra
tors in their role of providing
the resources and settings best
facilitating the attainment of
community goals.
The attempts to reformulate
student identity and to increase
the participation of students in
shaping a better order should
be recognized as legitimate ef
forts to deal with the frustra
tions of the present environ
ment. This normative position
rests ultimately on a personal
philosophy of education but
justification is offered in terms
of public goals and norms.
Present student frustrations
have their basis in the depart
mentalization of knowledge and
in the isolation of classroom
learning from personal develop
ment. (See Joseph Katz and
Nevitt Sanford for doubts on
this score.)
These are not by any means
the sole characteristics of uni
versity organization and opera

tion which contribute to the
process of turning excited, hope
ful freshmen into pragmatic,
other-directed, what-good-is-this
academic-crud upperclassmen.
What might lead one to ex
tend the participation hypothe
sis beyond the confines of the
psych lab to the larger commun
ity?
Dare we think that cultural
dynamics are not restricted to
primitive societies but operate
in the very Quad itself? Do we
recognize that the operation of
the present academic process
functions more to alert the sub
jects of the operations to the
idiosyncratic cues of high status
people — instilling a life-goal of
meeting environmental tests of
personal worth rather than to
invoke and inspire a search for
truth and a life-goal of self-ex
tending creativity?
If we can see past the wishful
thoughts and the socially ap
proved nice-things-to-say, per
haps we can recognize that a call
to a new identity is a legitimate
and reasonable response to exist
ing conditions.
But to be successful, "there
must be commitment to the
change, and others must accord
it recognition and do all the
things needed to reinforce and
consolidate it so that a sense of
new identity can actually be at
tained (Ward Goodenough, 1963,
p. 291.)
DENNIS J SIMS
• A Dungeon ?
Editor, The Daily:
In response to Allan Christe
low's letter of May 20th, I be
lieve that Stanford is justified
in calling itself a university,

meaning that Stanford is at
least as much of a university as
Berkeley, Harvard, or Oxford.
Stanford may not measure up
to Mr. Christelows' "ideal"
standards, but then again, many
of us have different conceptions
of the ideal.
I do not feel that Stanford is
perfect, that Stanford should
be controlled Ry outside alumni
pressure, that students should
be made to conform to some
clean-cut image, or that ROTC
students should be coerced into
donating their blood. However,
simply because we have several
problems in the university, this
does not mean that Stanford is
leading American society "down
the road to infamy."
In previous years, Stanford
students have been active in civil
rights work, the Peace Corps,
the Ravenswood tutorial, num
erous work projects, Vista, and
assorted student political orga
nizations.
Mr. Christelow cannot fairly
argue that Stanford students are
apathetic and uncritical. Stu
dents do take an interest in the
"harsh reality of the outside
world," and they have made
honest attempts to improve it.
Some of the credit for motivat
ing student activity belongs to
Sanford University as it now
exists in its, admittedly, imper
fect form.
Stanford is not the stultify
ing dungeon that Mr. Christelow
describes, nor is it a factory for
the production of machine parts.
It has been used as a vantage
point from wihch students have
re-evaluated many aspects of
the "surrounding world."
Unfortunately, many students
often become frustrated, per
haps like Mr. Christelow, when
they realize that the really big
problem of our age—the possi
bility of world war and the wave
of revolution sweeping Africa,
Asia and South America — are
beyond student control and fre
quently beyond our still limited
understanding.

• Second-Rate School
Editor, The Daily:
Stanford University's 'leap to
greatness' would be better
termed 'stumbling mediocrity'.
The so-called 'Harvard of the
West' is guilty of the following
cardinal sins:
• Blatant religious discrimi
nation (for over seventy years):
for refusing (as recently as one
week ago) to let Jews hold ser
vices on campus other than in
a gaudy Christian church whose
symbology is offensive even to
many campus Christians.
• Obsequious kowtowing to
alumni criticism: for suspending
a Freshman athlete from the
track team because his hair was
too long and thus offended a
few well-heeled alumni.
• Giving academic credit for
soldier courses (ROTC), the aca
demic content of which has been
controversial at best.
• Having a sloppily cata
logued and even more sloppily
run main library. A first-class
library is the sine qua non of a
great university. There is no
question where that leaves Stan
ford.
Like some people, Stanford is
more concerned with its image
than with itself. Are not all of
these unmistakable signs of a
second-rate university?

•Arrive? Never!
Editor, The Dally:
The Freshman Daily (May 17)
was very interesting, but in
some ways disconcerting.
After reading about Wilbur,
Civ, the personal voice in En
glish and any number of other
editorials about how freshmen
look at things, two disturbing
comments stood out most in my
mind: first, that of the Roble
girl who said "I'd change no
thing . . . I'm crazy about every
aspect of this place," and even
more, the remarke from Art
Fisher's column entitled "Fresh
men: You Are Here—But When
Will You Arrive?" that "Kid,
you're just a little freshman and
you don't know what's happen
ing."
Despite the risk of sounding
like someone who is ready to
solve the world's problems at the
end of the freshman year, I
think that both these comments
miss one of the most vitally im
portant attitudes one can ever
hope to cultivate: that of con
sructive dissatisfaction.
No society, such as Stanford
University, is so good that every
aspect of it should remain un
changed; Mr. Fisher's article re
flects the same absence of con
structive dissatisfaction as the
freshman comment, but in a
much more serious way. I ques
tion whether the senior who
would say to a freshman or any
other student, silently or other
wise, that "Kid, you're just a
little freshman and don't know
what's happening'' doesn't have
a very good idea himself of the
changes he has undergone dur
ing his four years at Stanford.
"Freshmen: You Are Here—
But When Will You Arrive?" ex
horts Mr. Fisher. I don't want
to arrive, if that means that at
the end of my senior year, I'll
think that I realize all the im
plications of my college experi
ences. I'm glad to be a fresh
man, just as I'll be glad to be a
sophomore, junior, and senior.
Because for every mistake 1
make this year, there was some
thing learned about myself or
others that was so valuable that
I was glad to be wrong in the
learning, so long as I learned.
Mr. Fisher tells us freshmen
that when we are seniors, we
will have changed and when we
realize that, we "will have made
it." He says further that until
we have made this realization,
"It's all Frosh Week until then."
Does he mean that to imply that
when we are seniors, we will
know what it's all about?
I hope not, and I think not.
If my ideas are idealistic, they
do not ignore experience. If be
ing a freshman means a little
bungling through life and some
realizations of ignorance, I'm
glad to be a freshman. I'm hap
py to know that I still have a lot
to learn, and that I always will;
I'm happy to know that I'll
never arrive.

• Rewarding Seminar
Editor, The Daily:
Because the Freshman Semi
nar program (discussed in May
17's Freshman Edition of The
Daily) is made up of unique
groups of individuals studying
relatively unrelated topics, it is
practically impossible to make
general statements about the
program as a whole.
By taking part in one of these
groups ("Modern Ballads and
Their Backgrounds" with Profes
sor Claude Simpson), I enjoyed
a wide exchange of knowledge
injected with personal theories.
That is, I found a high level of
intra-group communication of
specialized educational value
which both illustrated back
ground research and opened wide
the gates for individual study.
I left the seminar with what
I feel is an enlightened curiosity,
a feeling of accomplishment and
potential, and a knowledge
which I have found both enjoy
able and practical. I consider
this participation in the Fresh
man Seminar program one of
my most rewarding experiences
at Stanford.

So you received ten letters
backing the position of Pat Mor
rison, who refused to co-operate
with his track coach when asked
to have his lovely locks trimmed.
Well, here is one letter which
does not back either Pat or you.
To a grown man—it appears
as perfectly silly that such ac
tions are so important. Pat
must conform to some common
standards. He wears pants,
doesn't he?
I have had more friends who
never attended Stanford kid me
about the situation. They get
lots of laughs out of you "kids."
We Stanford alumni really take
a beating because of the child
ish antics of a very few stu
dents.
This is written in the thought
you might appreciate knowing
how most of we old timers feel.
Please, don't follow Berkeley's
example!
ROY F. REINEMAN,
Covlna, Calif.
Editor, The Daily:
Stanford's first sit-in is now
history. If it is to be remem
bered at all, it will be remember
ed as a dismal failure; it could
not have been anything else.
Speaking as one who is sympa
thetic with the goals of the
"New Left" and the anti-Viet
nam war movements, I would
like to offer a few. thoughts as
to why the sit-in was doomed
from the start.
The technique of the sit-in
(at least in this generation) de
veloped out of the civil rights
movement in the South and has
been exported to other areas and
issues largely by those active
in the civil rights movement.
Yet the conditions under which
the technique succeeded in the
South were perhaps more im
portant to the success of the
movement than the sit-in tech
nique itself. It is this lesson
which the Stanford sit-in ig
nored.
• Non-violent civil disobedi
ence is an appeal to the public
conscience—not a method of co
ercing an individual.
• As an appeal to the public
conscience, it must carry such
moral justification as to over
come the democratic presump
tion against extra-legal meth
ods of protest.
• Moral justification and the
pragmatic concern for expedi
ency and utility cannot totally
be separated. These factors
which, under given circum
star e c will make the sit-in
~ble ? i compelling will
>r iQ Iso to -ake it morally
justiaJble—and vill make the
moral justification apparent to
the larger society.
a. Civil disobedience should
be used only when all other
existing remedies have been
exhausted; when every tradi
tional approach has been tried
and found wanting. Why did
the protesters' overwhelming
demand to have the Selective
Service test cancelled manifest
itself only days before the test
was scheduled? Would anyone
expect the faculty or adminis
tration to act on such short
notice when the tests had been
scheduled publicly for months?
Wasn't the impression con
veyed to the student body that
the demonstrators' moral re
vulsion to the test had ma
terialized overnight?
b. The goal of a sit-in must
be capable of precise and con
sistent articulation. Such was
the goal of the Southern civil
rights demonstrations. They
were demanding the right to
be free from specific forms of
racial discrimination — rights
guaranteed to them by the
Federal Constitution. What
was the goal of the Stanford
sit-in? Was it the complicity
of the University in the Selec
tive Service System? Such
complicity is wrong only if the
Selective Service System is
wrong. Was the System wrong
because it discriminated in fav
or of upper middle-class col
lege students? If so, were the
demonstrators calling for uni
versal military training, aboli
tion of conscription, or some
intermediate course? Did they
oppose the test simply on the
grounds that it aided the im
moral war in Vietnam? If the
war itself is immoral, can one
be criticized for preferring a
student exemption to the risk
of being sent to kill those who
we have no right to kij'?
The sit-in was a failure be
cause it was conducted without
regard to the essential nature
and function of civil disobedi
ence.

• Unfortunate
Approach
Editor, The Daily:
The demonstrators picketing
President Sterling's office pro
testing the use of Stanford as a
Selective Service Examination
Center are using this contro
versy to register their opposition
to the Draft in general and to
United States policy in the Viet
nam war. It is unfortunate that
this partcular even should have
been chosen as the vehicle of
protest, for it has resulted in a
conflict of the principles of the
demonstrators themselves and
has offended rather than merely
awakened a large number of
the Stanford men who consider
it a great convenience to be able
to take the examination on cam
pus.
Many of these demonstrators
are among those who are de
manding the right to be able to
obtain contraceptives from the
University Health Service, vet
these same students would deny
others the right to take the
Draft test on campus, if they so
desire. These particular protest
ers are demanding one right
while denying another. The con
traceptive question may not be
totally analagous to the Draft
test controversy, but neverthe
less, these demonstrators should
maintain some degree of consis
tency in their beliefs and actions
if they wish to avoid being la
beled hypocrites.

I would strongly urge these
protesting students, if they sin
cerely desire greater acceptance
of their ideas and values, to dis
continue this particular type of
demonstration which can only
do harm to the concepts they
stand for in the long run.

• Wrongly Directed
Editor, The Daily:
Thursday night during dinner,
mimeographed sheets were dis
tributed in the Wilbur dining
rooms, requesting support for a
vigil in President Sterling's of
fice. The expressed purpose of
this vigil was to "demand our
rights ... to enjoin the Univer
sity from cooperating with and
endorsing a rotten (sic) system
by giving the next deferment
test." We do not object to these
students expressing their views.
We do, however, feel that they
are protesting in the wrong
place and to the wrong person.
The draft test was given on a
voluntary basis. In making avail
able classroom space, we feel
that President Sterling was
merely cooperating with student
desire for a convenient place to
take the test. In doing this, nei
ther he nor the University was
"giving" nor necessarily "en
dorsing" these exams, as was
maintained by those sponsoring
the vigil. The test was given by
the Selective Service, to only
those students who, having con
sidered all alternatives, chose to
take it. If everyone has the right
to decide for himself whether to
take the test, those who do want
to should certainly be able to
take it at a convenient location.
Legitimate protest of the draft
policy should be directed to those
directly responsible—to the Se
lective Service—and not to the
President of the University.

• Praising Wert
Editor, The Daily:
A large number of students
counter-demonstrating in front
of President Sterling's office
were very favorably impressed
with Dean Wert's statement to
the sit-in protesters. The state
men made it abundantly clear
that President Sterling was will
ing to meet with five or six stu
dents in a private discussion;
privacy and the absence of news
media is a prerequisite for any
meaningful and intelligent dia
logue.
The protesters were given am
ple time to present their posi
tion through normal channels
(such as the Committee of Fif
teen) during the several months
since the draft exam at Stanford
was announced, but instead they
delayed action until one exam
had already been given.
The continuation of the sit-in
after Dean Wert's statement was
made served no purpose other
than obstructing normal activity
in the President's office, since
the draft exam would not be can
celled in spite of the demonstra
tors' effort to deny the right to
take the exam from those who
wished to take it.
The diciplinary action the pro
testers will receive has definite
ly been earned, and prompt ac
tion should be taken by the stu
dent judicial council.

• Activists Not Listening
Editor, The Daily:
I spoke to a youth who was
handing out mimeographed ma
terial on The Sit-in at the White
Memorial Plaza at noon on Mon
day, May 23. I asked him why he
was dressed in such an unkempt
way. He said that he liked it
that way. I replied that it was
offensive to me and I pointed
out to him that his feet were
very dirty. He answered that
that was because he was bare
foot. I suggested that he must
be quite young to be so careless
of his appearance and he admit
ted that he was very young. I
realize now that I should have
admonished this child to go
home to his mother.
In his editorial in The Stan
ford Daily of May 24, Mr. Roise
predicts a rise in student activ

ism at Stanford in 1966. Some of
us have been around the cam
pus for a long time. In fact we
have devoted most our lives to
Stanford students. Never under
estimate the power of a woman!
This is one woman, and there
are many faculty wives like me,
who will be active if necessary
next Fall. We will not permit a
small group of idealistic, but re
bellious and misguided adoles
cent beatniks led by graduate
Teaching Assistants, who state
that "actions of the faculty seem
to them to be an appalling in
dication of moral bankruptcy
and intellectual cowardice" to
wreck our university. If anyone
is guilty of not listening it is
the student activist. Perhaps the
dirt in his ears prevents him
from hearing.
My husband is not morally
bankrupt or an intellectual cow

• Teaching The Faculty
Editor, The Daily:
Now that the sit-in is over and
we can try to assess the respon
sibility for the breakdown in
communications that led to it, let
us not forget to include the re
sponsibility of the faculty. The
fact is that the students did
not act until the faculty had re
fused to act.
It has been said that the fac
ulty could not have considered
the problem of the draft at their
meeting last Tuesday because
they had spent so much time on
classified contracts. That is un
doubtedly true. But why did they
have to wait until last Tuesday
to consider the matter?
Professors at Brandeis raised
the issue more than two months
ago. And why did they have to
wait until last Tuesday to con
sider classified contracts? That
issue was raised last December
by the GCC Newsletter. Have the
faculty stopped reading the
newspapers?
In this situation the students
were very careful not to violate
faculty prerogatives. But it
seems that the faculty will not
consider issues until students
have violated those prerogatives.
Why should students have to
tell their teachers that they are
tacitly condoning a possible vio
lation of academic freedom?
Why should students have to
tell their teachers that they are
condoning the participation of
the University in what may be
an immoral system? But it
seems that students do have to
tell their teachers, and it seems
that they have to do it violently.
Maybe the faculty have learned
as much from this incident as
the rest of us hope to have
learned. But if not, I am afraid
that we can expect more sit-ins.
And maybe next time they will
be in the offices of the Executive
Committee of the Academic
Council.

• Showing Their Colors
Editor, Th<> Daily:
There is a final chapter to the
story of the draft protest, which
didn't make monday's Daily:
After the demonstrators had
left the President's office, and
had walked to his home to dis
cover that he was away for the
weekend, they returned to cam
pus by the quickest route, frater
nity row. Boys on the lawn of the
ATO house shouted "It would

take three of you chickenshits
to make one of us!" and other
things they thought appropriate
to the occasion.
Boys at the Beta Theta Pi and
Phi Gamma Delta houses follow
ed suit, with the more inventive
Betas running up to their bal
cony to bombard the tired pro
testers with water balloons.
This self-comment says more
about the fraternity "system"
than any outsider ever could.

• Decision-Making
Editor, The Daily:
The recent sit-in in the office
of President Sterling served to
dramatize an issue of fundamen
tal and long-standing importance
to everyone at Stanford Univer
sity. Can Stanford University
become the community of schol
ars which it claims to be?
The events of the past week-

end have shown that we are far
from attaining this goal. The
lack of willingness to communi
cate on the part of the adminis
tration has never been as clear
ly evident than in the unilateral
decision to hold a draft test on
campus which raises serious
questions for all at the Univer
sity.
It has also been evident with
regard to the issues of social
regs, liquor and religion on
which the administration
evinced little or no desire to act
until the application of power
on the part of some other group
was imminent.
It is true that the committee
of fifteen, the revival of LASSU
as a meaningful decision-making
body, and student participation
on certain committees has im
proved the situation somewhat
in the past few years.
However the total unwilling
ness of the administration to
consult students and revise on
the question of the di'aft test
before and after the sit-in indi
cates that the basic problem
hasn't been solved.
The desire of the administra
tion to substitute power for dis
cussion in this instance raises
further questions — the stu
dents who sat in tried are about
to be tried for violation of the
fundamental standard.
In a genuine community, the
basic standard of conduct should
be applicable to all within it,
not just one segment of its pop
ulation. It is without a doubt
that the intransigence evidenced
by President Sterling hurt the
Stanford community at least as
much as the action taken and
persisted in by the students as a
result.
Who, however, is going to try
him for violation of a fundamen
tal standard?
If Stanford is ever to become
a community in any meaningful
sense, communication, rather
than power struggle must play
the major role in University de
cision-making.
In addition, any basic stand
ard of conduct which is adopted
should be made applicable to all.

• Art Of Persuasion
Editor, The
It seems to me that much of
the enlightened campus dialogue
regarding this country's involve

ment in Viet Nam is failing in
its intended goal of awakening
anti-war sentiment. One of the
most obvious and most easily
corrected reasons for the unper
suasiveness of this dialogue is
the stereotype "beatnik" image
which many of the activists
convey to the uninitiated pub
lic.
The long hair and sandals and
beards of many articulate stu
dents cannot help but subtract
from the overall appeal of their
arguments to an audience which
is generally unaccustomed to
looking beyond surface appear
ance. Moreover, the national
audience welcomes the oppor
tunity to stereotype the student
activist as "just another beard
ed mal content, probably a Com
munist, and maybe a homosex
ual." Stereotyping, though some
times helpful, in this case mere
ly relieves the public of the bur
densome task of critical evalua
tion, when critical evaluation is
just what the activists want to

promote.
The tendency to stereotype,
prevalent among the uneducated
and among some politicians, is
sad—even tragic. But, it is com
mon. To provide the undecided
citizen with such an effortless
escape from a confrontation
with the issue neither does jus
tice to the war, to the citizen,
nor to the Student Left.
Of course, most students feel
that personal freedom is the
basis of their protest. That in
cludes the freedom to dress ac
cording to individual choice.
Freedom seems to me to rank
second only to happiness in the
hierarchy of human values. To
voluntarily give up any freedom
is an act with grave political
and philosophical implications
and should by no means be done
lightly. However, a few people
are dedicated not only to living
in the world, but to making the
world a better place in which to
live. For these few the casual
exercise of every freedom may
be costly in terms of accom
plishment.
To understand that I am not
advocating conformity, the issue
of personal freedom must be
put into perspective. Now, if
sprinter Pat Morrison wants to
let his hair grow to an unusual
length, that's his business. He
isn't trying to convince anyone
to think, or by implication, to do
as he does. His hair is only his
business.
But, the political activists are
engaged in the art of persua
sion, and they are foolish if
they believe that their appeal
goes out to a purely logical pub
lic. The SCPV, it is true, is not
trying to set fashions in hair
style any more than Morrison,
but only the naive orator fails
to see the irrational association
between the content of speech
and the appearance of speaker.
The successful orator capitalizes
upon this fact.
To those who at this point re
mind me that the student move
ment is also a protest against
ignorance and irrationality, not
a concession to it, I ask that
they refer that reminder to the
student leaders, who conceive
their own role and the role of
the university as one of leader
ship. How can there be leader
ship without a following?
It is an imperfect world where
certain personal freedoms, like
the freedom to express oneself
through the choice of clothes or

hair style, must be inhibited in
order to further some other
freedoms, like the freedom to
compete equally for public senti
ment alongside the models of
middleclass values. Those lead
ers who recognize the necessity
of coming out of the philosophi
cal ivory tower to establish con
tact with a non-philosophical
world should see this compro
mise as the least of many evils.
Some, obviously, refuse to
make that compromise. It seems
to me that their unwillingness
to compromise sheds some light
on the sincerity of their com
mitment to the goal of peace in
Viet Nam.
RON GARRISON
• Conflicting Demands
Editor, The Daily:
A basic contradiction emerges
in two of the recent protest
movements here at Stanford.
The SSRF wishes the univer
sity to supply contraceptives to
anyone who wants them with
the idea that each student would
then be able to make his (her)
own moral decision. That's fine.
But now the most recent
group proposes exactly the op
posite: that the individual stu
dent should not be allowed by
his individual choice (whether
moral or otherwise) to take the
selective service draft test on
university proper. This same
group indicts the faculty as a
unit for not supporting students
in a (now) redefined cause of
student particiaption in decision
making. This is truly an inter
esting case, since the decision
to hold a draft test was hardly
made at Building 10.
More student involvement in
decision making is certainly
needed at Stanford, but the re
cent draft test is a pretty weak
issue to identify it wih.
PHIL ARNOLD
• October Days
Editor, The Daily:
In trying to see the current
student unrest - administration
intransigence difficulties from a
point of view somewhere be
yond the heat of the conflict,
I am struck by one overriding
concern: What methods are ap
propriate to the solution of prob
lems that arise within a com
munity of scholars and their
students?
It seems to me that the most
appropriate methods would be
those which are the hallmark of
any thinking community: reas
on, definition, articulation, and
dialogue. This must be the case
so long as all protagonists are
concerned with preserving the
"community."
The present situation at Stan
ford, from this point of view, is
pretty dismal. The student lead
ers prefer to posit these delicate
issues concerning government
university, war-university, draft
university in the streets. The ad
ministration prefers to ignore
the problem, to be consistently
absent.
As the scene becomes increas
ingly dichotomized, as the pro
tagonists at either extreme ac
celerate the process of detach
ment from one another, cutting
lines of rational communication,
throwing up impenetrable walls
of opaque verbiage of absolutely
no use if dialogue is really de
sider between the extremes, the
possibility of clearly raising and
effectively solving these prob
lems becomes impossible.
Rather than a community of
scholars and students, this scene
is more reminiscent of Petro
grad in the spring of 3917. So
far, the problem, clumsily de
fined even in the pamphlets and
fly-leaves of those who have
raised it, has been articulated
in the manner of peasant muni
tion workers, through slogans at
best, through shouting rallies in
the streets at worst.
And the problem has been
met by an administration unwill
ing to admit the gravity of the
situation, as yet unable to think
out the problem or to take ag
gressively positive measures to
assess the nature of the student
demands and to land on a pro
gram of action which will insure
that the university will not
have to depend on the delicacy
of crowds in White Plaza to
solve these involved and intri
cate issues.
The problem with the bread
riots in Petrograd in 1917 is not
that they were an ineffective
expression of workers' and peas
ants' extreme discontent, but
that they were able to express
only this negative sentiment in
the absence of other viable
channels of communication. And
the problem with the Russian
Provisional Government in 1917
is not that it was a bad govern
ment, but that it was no gov
ernment at all. What can we ex
pect from next October?
ALAN KIMBALL

• 'If Its Pressed
Editor, The Daily:
Hooray for the emerging Stan
ford. Down with ambivalent dou
ble-standards, bumbling bureau
cracy, and the multiversity-in
dustrial-military behemoth. Since

the election of "artistic social
ist" Dave Harris, Stanford has
made radical progress in identi
fying and confronting the real
issues. First, that bastion of in
trigue, the Electrical Engineer
ing Department, was identified
as a cover, albeit in the open,
for the monstrous CIA. Tlien
came the revelation of the blood
thirsty anti-intelectuallism of
the ROTC. This week, finally,
we're getting to the basic issue,
elimination of the "parentis
pocis" routine with the need
made obvious by the Athletic De
partment. It should be readily
apparent that the length of one's
hair is a private matter and
doesn't even require the "mu
tual consent" of the SSRF.
Furthermore, this leads im
mediately to a more basic issue,
the rights of the Stanford Dollie.
The restrictions on "Quad
clothes," actual and imagined,
must be eliminated. What right
has the University to impose its
ideas of contemporary dress
when such regulations obviously
contribute nothing to intellectual
attainment. Each person should
be free, at least in a university,
to be comfortable, to experi
ment, and to investigate various
modes of thought and apparel.
To the comment that the dis
traction of the Stanford males
by bikini-clad or even topless
damsels would be destructive to
their intellectual endeavors, I
say that this is merely a chal
lenge to the teachers. If their
teaching is stimulating enough,
who need watch the girls. After
all, we're here for an education,
not an eyeful.
Besides, think of the health
benefits. What could be more
American than taking in a little
sun on the way to class. Why
the reduction of auto accidents
involving students rushing back
from northern beaches and bars
alone should make everyone
wish the immediate elimination
of this childish regulation!
In keeping with the campaign
a number of slogans have been
suggested. "If It's Pressed, Don't
Wear It." "Be Comfortable,
Stimulate a Professor." And of
course, you can make up your
own.
I urge one and all to take up
this issue because at the rate
we're going there won't be many
worthy issues left.

• Bad Influence
Editor, The Daily:
I agree with Terry Inch, class
of '61, (The Daily, May 23) that
it's highly unfortunate that only
40 percent of the student body
voted in the last election. How
ever, I feel sure that even if 100
percent had voted, Dave Harris
still would have won by a fair
margin.
To find the true reasons for
Dave's victory you will have to
look a little deeper than at just
the size of the electorate. You
will have to look at the forces
which led Stanford students to
vote for a rebel.
As a freshman I know that
one of the strongest influences
on my classmates is that of the
Wilbur Sponsors. I realize gen
eralizations are not always fair,
but the majority of the sponsors
I've met are radical, whether
outspoken like Dave or not.
What's more, because of admin
istration concessions, the Wil
bur Sponsors have remained a
self-perpetuating group; thus,
they will continue to impress
their radical ideas on freshmen.
This leads to the real ques
tion, who influences the spon
sors? More generally, who in
fluences Stanford students? Ob
viously the faculty, and many,
many members of the faculty
are radical. Again, I have to
speak from experience.
At the beginning of second
quarter, my mathematics class
was dismissed by Mr. Kowalski
because he refused to teach in
the ROTC building. Last Friday
I saw my first quarter English
TA, Mr. Addams, sitting on
President Sterling's window sill,
encouraging the anti-draft dem
onstrators,
Certainly these two examples
are extreme, but they suggest
what is often a more subtle radi
calism imposed on students by a
large section of the faculty. In
fact, I'm sure that many of the
"free thinkers" who voted for
Dave were merely reflecting
their instructors' ideas.
As an afterthought, contrary
to the recent article in Western
Politica, some intellectuals are
not liberal. If you want to see
a different kind of professor
molding (is there a better
word?) Stanford students, Mr.
Inch, it is your right and your
duty as a donating alumnus to
demand a change on The Farm,

• Development
Program
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to suggest that
the proposals of Dave Harris
et. al. be viewed as an attempted


"First, Premier Ky, you must learn the principles of democracy ..
community development pro
gram—an attempt at an altera
tion of the public culture of the
University with the intent of
transforming the way that the
members feel about themselves.
Cooperation and suggestions
in this attempt might focus
upon the evident need of increas
ing the opportunities of the
members of the community for
self-realization. This increased
opportunity should be available
to the students in their search
for life-models in a period of
transition, to the faculty in
their goal of transmitting the
excitement of intellecual discov
ery and of providing models of
another culture (subculture if
you will) and to the administra
tors in their role of providing
the resources and settings best
facilitating the attainment of
community goals.
The attempts to reformulate
student identity and to increase
the participation of students in
shaping a better order should
be recognized as legitimate ef
forts to deal with the frustra
tions of the present environ
ment. This normative position
rests ultimately on a personal
philosophy of education but
justification is offered in terms
of public goals and norms.
Present student frustrations
have their basis in the depart
mentalization of knowledge and
in the isolation of classroom
learning from personal develop
ment. (See Joseph Katz and
Nevitt Sanford for doubts on
this score.)
These are not by any means
the sole characteristics of uni
versity organization and opera

tion which contribute to the
process of turning excited, hope
ful freshmen into pragmatic,
other-directed, what-good-is-this
academic-crud upperclassmen.
What might lead one to ex
tend the participation hypothe
sis beyond the confines of the
psych lab to the larger commun
ity?
Dare we think that cultural
dynamics are not restricted to
primitive societies but operate
in the very Quad itself? Do we
recognize that the operation of
the present academic process
functions more to alert the sub
jects of the operations to the
idiosyncratic cues of high status
people — instilling a life-goal of
meeting environmental tests of
personal worth rather than to
invoke and inspire a search for
truth and a life-goal of self-ex
tending creativity?
If we can see past the wishful
thoughts and the socially ap
proved nice-things-to-say, per
haps we can recognize that a call
to a new identity is a legitimate
and reasonable response to exist
ing conditions.
But to be successful, "there
must be commitment to the
change, and others must accord
it recognition and do all the
things needed to reinforce and
consolidate it so that a sense of
new identity can actually be at
tained (Ward Goodenough, 1963,
p. 291.)
DENNIS J SIMS
• A Dungeon ?
Editor, The Daily:
In response to Allan Christe
low's letter of May 20th, I be
lieve that Stanford is justified
in calling itself a university,

meaning that Stanford is at
least as much of a university as
Berkeley, Harvard, or Oxford.
Stanford may not measure up
to Mr. Christelows' "ideal"
standards, but then again, many
of us have different conceptions
of the ideal.
I do not feel that Stanford is
perfect, that Stanford should
be controlled Ry outside alumni
pressure, that students should
be made to conform to some
clean-cut image, or that ROTC
students should be coerced into
donating their blood. However,
simply because we have several
problems in the university, this
does not mean that Stanford is
leading American society "down
the road to infamy."
In previous years, Stanford
students have been active in civil
rights work, the Peace Corps,
the Ravenswood tutorial, num
erous work projects, Vista, and
assorted student political orga
nizations.
Mr. Christelow cannot fairly
argue that Stanford students are
apathetic and uncritical. Stu
dents do take an interest in the
"harsh reality of the outside
world," and they have made
honest attempts to improve it.
Some of the credit for motivat
ing student activity belongs to
Sanford University as it now
exists in its, admittedly, imper
fect form.
Stanford is not the stultify
ing dungeon that Mr. Christelow
describes, nor is it a factory for
the production of machine parts.
It has been used as a vantage
point from wihch students have
re-evaluated many aspects of
the "surrounding world."
Unfortunately, many students
often become frustrated, per
haps like Mr. Christelow, when
they realize that the really big
problem of our age—the possi
bility of world war and the wave
of revolution sweeping Africa,
Asia and South America — are
beyond student control and fre
quently beyond our still limited
understanding.
GEOFFREY STEVENS
Wilbur Freshman
• Second-Rate School
Editor, The Daily:
Stanford University's 'leap to
greatness' would be better
termed 'stumbling mediocrity'.
The so-called 'Harvard of the
West' is guilty of the following
cardinal sins:
• Blatant religious discrimi
nation (for over seventy years):
for refusing (as recently as one
week ago) to let Jews hold ser
vices on campus other than in
a gaudy Christian church whose
symbology is offensive even to
many campus Christians.
• Obsequious kowtowing to
alumni criticism: for suspending
a Freshman athlete from the
track team because his hair was
too long and thus offended a
few well-heeled alumni.
• Giving academic credit for
soldier courses (ROTC), the aca
demic content of which has been
controversial at best.
• Having a sloppily cata
logued and even more sloppily
run main library. A first-class
library is the sine qua non of a
great university. There is no
question where that leaves Stan
ford.
Like some people, Stanford is
more concerned with its image
than with itself. Are not all of
these unmistakable signs of a
second-rate university?

•Arrive? Never!
Editor, The Dally:
The Freshman Daily (May 17)
was very interesting, but in
some ways disconcerting.
After reading about Wilbur,
Civ, the personal voice in En
glish and any number of other
editorials about how freshmen
look at things, two disturbing
comments stood out most in my
mind: first, that of the Roble
girl who said "I'd change no
thing . . . I'm crazy about every
aspect of this place," and even
more, the remarke from Art
Fisher's column entitled "Fresh
men: You Are Here—But When
Will You Arrive?" that "Kid,
you're just a little freshman and
you don't know what's happen
ing."
Despite the risk of sounding
like someone who is ready to
solve the world's problems at the
end of the freshman year, I
think that both these comments
miss one of the most vitally im
portant attitudes one can ever
hope to cultivate: that of con
sructive dissatisfaction.
No society, such as Stanford
University, is so good that every
aspect of it should remain un
changed; Mr. Fisher's article re
flects the same absence of con
structive dissatisfaction as the
freshman comment, but in a
much more serious way. I ques
tion whether the senior who
would say to a freshman or any
other student, silently or other
wise, that "Kid, you're just a
little freshman and don't know
what's happening'' doesn't have
a very good idea himself of the
changes he has undergone dur
ing his four years at Stanford.
"Freshmen: You Are Here—
But When Will You Arrive?" ex
horts Mr. Fisher. I don't want
to arrive, if that means that at
the end of my senior year, I'll
think that I realize all the im
plications of my college experi
ences. I'm glad to be a fresh
man, just as I'll be glad to be a
sophomore, junior, and senior.
Because for every mistake 1
make this year, there was some
thing learned about myself or
others that was so valuable that
I was glad to be wrong in the
learning, so long as I learned.
Mr. Fisher tells us freshmen
that when we are seniors, we
will have changed and when we
realize that, we "will have made
it." He says further that until
we have made this realization,
"It's all Frosh Week until then."
Does he mean that to imply that
when we are seniors, we will
know what it's all about?
I hope not, and I think not.
If my ideas are idealistic, they
do not ignore experience. If be
ing a freshman means a little
bungling through life and some
realizations of ignorance, I'm
glad to be a freshman. I'm hap
py to know that I still have a lot
to learn, and that I always will;
I'm happy to know that I'll
never arrive.

• Rewarding Seminar
Editor, The Daily:
Because the Freshman Semi
nar program (discussed in May
17's Freshman Edition of The
Daily) is made up of unique
groups of individuals studying
relatively unrelated topics, it is
practically impossible to make
general statements about the
program as a whole.
By taking part in one of these
groups ("Modern Ballads and
Their Backgrounds" with Profes
sor Claude Simpson), I enjoyed
a wide exchange of knowledge
injected with personal theories.
That is, I found a high level of
intra-group communication of
specialized educational value
which both illustrated back
ground research and opened wide
the gates for individual study.
I left the seminar with what
I feel is an enlightened curiosity,
a feeling of accomplishment and
potential, and a knowledge
which I have found both enjoy
able and practical. I consider
this participation in the Fresh
man Seminar program one of
my most rewarding experiences
at Stanford.

Editor, The Daily:
So you received ten letters
backing the position of Pat Mor
rison, who refused to co-operate
with his track coach when asked
to have his lovely locks trimmed.
Well, here is one letter which
does not back either Pat or you.
To a grown man—it appears
as perfectly silly that such ac
tions are so important. Pat
must conform to some common
standards. He wears pants,
doesn't he?
I have had more friends who
never attended Stanford kid me
about the situation. They get
lots of laughs out of you "kids."
We Stanford alumni really take
a beating because of the child
ish antics of a very few stu
dents.
This is written in the thought
you might appreciate knowing
how most of we old timers feel.
Please, don't follow Berkeley's

ROY F. REINEMAN,
Covlna, Calif.
Editor, The Daily:
Stanford's first sit-in is now
history. If it is to be remem
bered at all, it will be remember
ed as a dismal failure; it could
not have been anything else.
Speaking as one who is sympa
thetic with the goals of the
"New Left" and the anti-Viet
nam war movements, I would
like to offer a few. thoughts as
to why the sit-in was doomed
from the start.
The technique of the sit-in
(at least in this generation) de
veloped out of the civil rights
movement in the South and has
been exported to other areas and
issues largely by those active
in the civil rights movement.
Yet the conditions under which
the technique succeeded in the
South were perhaps more im
portant to the success of the
movement than the sit-in tech
nique itself. It is this lesson
which the Stanford sit-in ig
nored.
• Non-violent civil disobedi
ence is an appeal to the public
conscience—not a method of co
ercing an individual.
• As an appeal to the public
conscience, it must carry such
moral justification as to over
come the democratic presump
tion against extra-legal meth
ods of protest.
• Moral justification and the
pragmatic concern for expedi
ency and utility cannot totally
be separated. These factors
which, under given circum
star e c will make the sit-in
~ble ? i compelling will
>r iQ Iso to -ake it morally
justiaJble—and vill make the
moral justification apparent to
the larger society.
a. Civil disobedience should
be used only when all other
existing remedies have been
exhausted; when every tradi
tional approach has been tried
and found wanting. Why did
the protesters' overwhelming
demand to have the Selective
Service test cancelled manifest
itself only days before the test
was scheduled? Would anyone
expect the faculty or adminis
tration to act on such short
notice when the tests had been
scheduled publicly for months?
Wasn't the impression con
veyed to the student body that
the demonstrators' moral re
vulsion to the test had ma
terialized overnight?
b. The goal of a sit-in must
be capable of precise and con
sistent articulation. Such was
the goal of the Southern civil
rights demonstrations. They
were demanding the right to
be free from specific forms of
racial discrimination — rights
guaranteed to them by the
Federal Constitution. What
was the goal of the Stanford
sit-in? Was it the complicity
of the University in the Selec
tive Service System? Such
complicity is wrong only if the
Selective Service System is
wrong. Was the System wrong
because it discriminated in fav
or of upper middle-class col
lege students? If so, were the
demonstrators calling for uni
versal military training, aboli
tion of conscription, or some
intermediate course? Did they
oppose the test simply on the
grounds that it aided the im
moral war in Vietnam? If the
war itself is immoral, can one
be criticized for preferring a
student exemption to the risk
of being sent to kill those who
we have no right to kij'?
The sit-in was a failure be
cause it was conducted without
regard to the essential nature
and function of civil disobedi
ence.

• Unfortunate
Approach
Editor, The Daily:
The demonstrators picketing
President Sterling's office pro
testing the use of Stanford as a
Selective Service Examination
Center are using this contro
versy to register their opposition
to the Draft in general and to
United States policy in the Viet
nam war. It is unfortunate that
this partcular even should have
been chosen as the vehicle of
protest, for it has resulted in a
conflict of the principles of the
demonstrators themselves and
has offended rather than merely
awakened a large number of
the Stanford men who consider
it a great convenience to be able
to take the examination on cam
pus.
Many of these demonstrators
are among those who are de
manding the right to be able to
obtain contraceptives from the
University Health Service, vet
these same students would deny
others the right to take the
Draft test on campus, if they so
desire. These particular protest
ers are demanding one right
while denying another. The con
traceptive question may not be
totally analagous to the Draft
test controversy, but neverthe
less, these demonstrators should
maintain some degree of consis
tency in their beliefs and actions
if they wish to avoid being la
beled hypocrites.

I would strongly urge these
protesting students, if they sin
cerely desire greater acceptance
of their ideas and values, to dis
continue this particular type of
demonstration which can only
do harm to the concepts they
stand for in the long run.

• Wrongly Directed
Editor, The Daily:
Thursday night during dinner,
mimeographed sheets were dis
tributed in the Wilbur dining
rooms, requesting support for a
vigil in President Sterling's of
fice. The expressed purpose of
this vigil was to "demand our
rights ... to enjoin the Univer
sity from cooperating with and
endorsing a rotten (sic) system
by giving the next deferment
test." We do not object to these
students expressing their views.
We do, however, feel that they
are protesting in the wrong
place and to the wrong person.
The draft test was given on a
voluntary basis. In making avail
able classroom space, we feel
that President Sterling was
merely cooperating with student
desire for a convenient place to
take the test. In doing this, nei
ther he nor the University was
"giving" nor necessarily "en
dorsing" these exams, as was
maintained by those sponsoring
the vigil. The test was given by
the Selective Service, to only
those students who, having con
sidered all alternatives, chose to
take it. If everyone has the right
to decide for himself whether to
take the test, those who do want
to should certainly be able to
take it at a convenient location.
Legitimate protest of the draft
policy should be directed to those
directly responsible—to the Se
lective Service—and not to the
President of the University.

• Praising Wert
Editor, The Daily:
A large number of students
counter-demonstrating in front
of President Sterling's office
were very favorably impressed
with Dean Wert's statement to
the sit-in protesters. The state
men made it abundantly clear
that President Sterling was will
ing to meet with five or six stu
dents in a private discussion;
privacy and the absence of news
media is a prerequisite for any
meaningful and intelligent dia
logue.
The protesters were given am
ple time to present their posi
tion through normal channels
(such as the Committee of Fif
teen) during the several months
since the draft exam at Stanford
was announced, but instead they
delayed action until one exam
had already been given.
The continuation of the sit-in
after Dean Wert's statement was
made served no purpose other
than obstructing normal activity
in the President's office, since
the draft exam would not be can
celled in spite of the demonstra
tors' effort to deny the right to
take the exam from those who
wished to take it.
The diciplinary action the pro
testers will receive has definite
ly been earned, and prompt ac
tion should be taken by the stu
dent judicial council.

• Activists Not Listening
Editor, The Daily:
I spoke to a youth who was
handing out mimeographed ma
terial on The Sit-in at the White
Memorial Plaza at noon on Mon
day, May 23. I asked him why he
was dressed in such an unkempt
way. He said that he liked it
that way. I replied that it was
offensive to me and I pointed
out to him that his feet were
very dirty. He answered that
that was because he was bare
foot. I suggested that he must
be quite young to be so careless
of his appearance and he admit
ted that he was very young. I
realize now that I should have
admonished this child to go
home to his mother.
In his editorial in The Stan
ford Daily of May 24, Mr. Roise
predicts a rise in student activ

ism at Stanford in 1966. Some of
us have been around the cam
pus for a long time. In fact we
have devoted most our lives to
Stanford students. Never under
estimate the power of a woman!
This is one woman, and there
are many faculty wives like me,
who will be active if necessary
next Fall. We will not permit a
small group of idealistic, but re
bellious and misguided adoles
cent beatniks led by graduate
Teaching Assistants, who state
that "actions of the faculty seem
to them to be an appalling in
dication of moral bankruptcy
and intellectual cowardice" to
wreck our university. If anyone
is guilty of not listening it is
the student activist. Perhaps the
dirt in his ears prevents him
from hearing.
My husband is not morally
bankrupt or an intellectual cow

• Teaching The Faculty
Editor, The Daily:
Now that the sit-in is over and
we can try to assess the respon
sibility for the breakdown in
communications that led to it, let
us not forget to include the re
sponsibility of the faculty. The
fact is that the students did
not act until the faculty had re
fused to act.
It has been said that the fac
ulty could not have considered
the problem of the draft at their
meeting last Tuesday because
they had spent so much time on
classified contracts. That is un
doubtedly true. But why did they
have to wait until last Tuesday
to consider the matter?
Professors at Brandeis raised
the issue more than two months
ago. And why did they have to
wait until last Tuesday to con
sider classified contracts? That
issue was raised last December
by the GCC Newsletter. Have the
faculty stopped reading the
newspapers?
In this situation the students
were very careful not to violate
faculty prerogatives. But it
seems that the faculty will not
consider issues until students
have violated those prerogatives.
Why should students have to
tell their teachers that they are
tacitly condoning a possible vio
lation of academic freedom?
Why should students have to
tell their teachers that they are
condoning the participation of
the University in what may be
an immoral system? But it
seems that students do have to
tell their teachers, and it seems
that they have to do it violently.
Maybe the faculty have learned
as much from this incident as
the rest of us hope to have
learned. But if not, I am afraid
that we can expect more sit-ins.
And maybe next time they will
be in the offices of the Executive
Committee of the Academic
Council.

• Showing Their Colors
Editor, Th<> Daily:
There is a final chapter to the
story of the draft protest, which
didn't make monday's Daily:
After the demonstrators had
left the President's office, and
had walked to his home to dis
cover that he was away for the
weekend, they returned to cam
pus by the quickest route, frater
nity row. Boys on the lawn of the
ATO house shouted "It would

take three of you chickenshits
to make one of us!" and other
things they thought appropriate
to the occasion.
Boys at the Beta Theta Pi and
Phi Gamma Delta houses follow
ed suit, with the more inventive
Betas running up to their bal
cony to bombard the tired pro
testers with water balloons.
This self-comment says more
about the fraternity "system"
than any outsider ever could.
MARLENE CHARYN

• Decision-Making
Editor, The Daily:
The recent sit-in in the office
of President Sterling served to
dramatize an issue of fundamen
tal and long-standing importance
to everyone at Stanford Univer
sity. Can Stanford University
become the community of schol
ars which it claims to be?
The events of the past week-

end have shown that we are far
from attaining this goal. The
lack of willingness to communi
cate on the part of the adminis
tration has never been as clear
ly evident than in the unilateral
decision to hold a draft test on
campus which raises serious
questions for all at the Univer
sity.
It has also been evident with
regard to the issues of social
regs, liquor and religion on
which the administration
evinced little or no desire to act
until the application of power
on the part of some other group
was imminent.
It is true that the committee
of fifteen, the revival of LASSU
as a meaningful decision-making
body, and student participation
on certain committees has im
proved the situation somewhat
in the past few years.
However the total unwilling
ness of the administration to
consult students and revise on
the question of the di'aft test
before and after the sit-in indi
cates that the basic problem
hasn't been solved.
The desire of the administra
tion to substitute power for dis
cussion in this instance raises
further questions — the stu
dents who sat in tried are about
to be tried for violation of the
fundamental standard.
In a genuine community, the
basic standard of conduct should
be applicable to all within it,
not just one segment of its pop
ulation. It is without a doubt
that the intransigence evidenced
by President Sterling hurt the
Stanford community at least as
much as the action taken and
persisted in by the students as a
result.
Who, however, is going to try
him for violation of a fundamen
tal standard?
If Stanford is ever to become
a community in any meaningful
sense, communication, rather
than power struggle must play
the major role in University de
cision-making.
In addition, any basic stand
ard of conduct which is adopted
should be made applicable to all.

• Art Of Persuasion
Editor, The
It seems to me that much of
the enlightened campus dialogue
regarding this country's involve

ment in Viet Nam is failing in
its intended goal of awakening
anti-war sentiment. One of the
most obvious and most easily
corrected reasons for the unper
suasiveness of this dialogue is
the stereotype "beatnik" image
which many of the activists
convey to the uninitiated pub
lic.
The long hair and sandals and
beards of many articulate stu
dents cannot help but subtract
from the overall appeal of their
arguments to an audience which
is generally unaccustomed to
looking beyond surface appear
ance. Moreover, the national
audience welcomes the oppor
tunity to stereotype the student
activist as "just another beard
ed mal content, probably a Com
munist, and maybe a homosex
ual." Stereotyping, though some
times helpful, in this case mere
ly relieves the public of the bur
densome task of critical evalua
tion, when critical evaluation is
just what the activists want to

promote.
The tendency to stereotype,
prevalent among the uneducated
and among some politicians, is
sad—even tragic. But, it is com
mon. To provide the undecided
citizen with such an effortless
escape from a confrontation
with the issue neither does jus
tice to the war, to the citizen,
nor to the Student Left.
Of course, most students feel
that personal freedom is the
basis of their protest. That in
cludes the freedom to dress ac
cording to individual choice.
Freedom seems to me to rank
second only to happiness in the
hierarchy of human values. To
voluntarily give up any freedom
is an act with grave political
and philosophical implications
and should by no means be done
lightly. However, a few people
are dedicated not only to living
in the world, but to making the
world a better place in which to
live. For these few the casual
exercise of every freedom may
be costly in terms of accom
plishment.
To understand that I am not
advocating conformity, the issue
of personal freedom must be
put into perspective. Now, if
sprinter Pat Morrison wants to
let his hair grow to an unusual
length, that's his business. He
isn't trying to convince anyone
to think, or by implication, to do
as he does. His hair is only his
business.
But, the political activists are
engaged in the art of persua
sion, and they are foolish if
they believe that their appeal
goes out to a purely logical pub
lic. The SCPV, it is true, is not
trying to set fashions in hair
style any more than Morrison,
but only the naive orator fails
to see the irrational association
between the content of speech
and the appearance of speaker.
The successful orator capitalizes
upon this fact.
To those who at this point re
mind me that the student move
ment is also a protest against
ignorance and irrationality, not
a concession to it, I ask that
they refer that reminder to the
student leaders, who conceive
their own role and the role of
the university as one of leader
ship. How can there be leader
ship without a following?
It is an imperfect world where
certain personal freedoms, like
the freedom to express oneself
through the choice of clothes or

hair style, must be inhibited in
order to further some other
freedoms, like the freedom to
compete equally for public senti
ment alongside the models of
middleclass values. Those lead
ers who recognize the necessity
of coming out of the philosophi
cal ivory tower to establish con
tact with a non-philosophical
world should see this compro
mise as the least of many evils.
Some, obviously, refuse to
make that compromise. It seems
to me that their unwillingness
to compromise sheds some light
on the sincerity of their com
mitment to the goal of peace in
Viet Nam.
RON GARRISON
• Conflicting Demands
Editor, The Daily:
A basic contradiction emerges
in two of the recent protest
movements here at Stanford.
The SSRF wishes the univer
sity to supply contraceptives to
anyone who wants them with
the idea that each student would
then be able to make his (her)
own moral decision. That's fine.
But now the most recent
group proposes exactly the op
posite: that the individual stu
dent should not be allowed by
his individual choice (whether
moral or otherwise) to take the
selective service draft test on
university proper. This same
group indicts the faculty as a
unit for not supporting students
in a (now) redefined cause of
student particiaption in decision
making. This is truly an inter
esting case, since the decision
to hold a draft test was hardly
made at Building 10.
More student involvement in
decision making is certainly
needed at Stanford, but the re
cent draft test is a pretty weak
issue to identify it wih.
PHIL ARNOLD
• October Days
Editor, The Daily:
In trying to see the current
student unrest - administration
intransigence difficulties from a
point of view somewhere be
yond the heat of the conflict,
I am struck by one overriding
concern: What methods are ap
propriate to the solution of prob
lems that arise within a com
munity of scholars and their
students?
It seems to me that the most
appropriate methods would be
those which are the hallmark of
any thinking community: reas
on, definition, articulation, and
dialogue. This must be the case
so long as all protagonists are
concerned with preserving the
"community."
The present situation at Stan
ford, from this point of view, is
pretty dismal. The student lead
ers prefer to posit these delicate
issues concerning government
university, war-university, draft
university in the streets. The ad
ministration prefers to ignore
the problem, to be consistently
absent.
As the scene becomes increas
ingly dichotomized, as the pro
tagonists at either extreme ac
celerate the process of detach
ment from one another, cutting
lines of rational communication,
throwing up impenetrable walls
of opaque verbiage of absolutely
no use if dialogue is really de
sider between the extremes, the
possibility of clearly raising and
effectively solving these prob
lems becomes impossible.
Rather than a community of
scholars and students, this scene
is more reminiscent of Petro
grad in the spring of 3917. So
far, the problem, clumsily de
fined even in the pamphlets and
fly-leaves of those who have
raised it, has been articulated
in the manner of peasant muni
tion workers, through slogans at
best, through shouting rallies in
the streets at worst.
And the problem has been
met by an administration unwill
ing to admit the gravity of the
situation, as yet unable to think
out the problem or to take ag
gressively positive measures to
assess the nature of the student
demands and to land on a pro
gram of action which will insure
that the university will not
have to depend on the delicacy
of crowds in White Plaza to
solve these involved and intri
cate issues.
The problem with the bread
riots in Petrograd in 1917 is not
that they were an ineffective
expression of workers' and peas
ants' extreme discontent, but
that they were able to express
only this negative sentiment in
the absence of other viable
channels of communication. And
the problem with the Russian
Provisional Government in 1917
is not that it was a bad govern
ment, but that it was no gov
ernment at all. What can we ex
pect from next October?

• 'If Its Pressed
Editor, The Daily:
Hooray for the emerging Stan
ford. Down with ambivalent dou
ble-standards, bumbling bureau
cracy, and the multiversity-in
dustrial-military behemoth. Since

the election of "artistic social
ist" Dave Harris, Stanford has
made radical progress in identi
fying and confronting the real
issues. First, that bastion of in
trigue, the Electrical Engineer
ing Department, was identified
as a cover, albeit in the open,
for the monstrous CIA. Tlien
came the revelation of the blood
thirsty anti-intelectuallism of
the ROTC. This week, finally,
we're getting to the basic issue,
elimination of the "parentis
pocis" routine with the need
made obvious by the Athletic De
partment. It should be readily
apparent that the length of one's
hair is a private matter and
doesn't even require the "mu
tual consent" of the SSRF.
Furthermore, this leads im
mediately to a more basic issue,
the rights of the Stanford Dollie.
The restrictions on "Quad
clothes," actual and imagined,
must be eliminated. What right
has the University to impose its
ideas of contemporary dress
when such regulations obviously
contribute nothing to intellectual
attainment. Each person should
be free, at least in a university,
to be comfortable, to experi
ment, and to investigate various
modes of thought and apparel.
To the comment that the dis
traction of the Stanford males
by bikini-clad or even topless
damsels would be destructive to
their intellectual endeavors, I
say that this is merely a chal
lenge to the teachers. If their
teaching is stimulating enough,
who need watch the girls. After
all, we're here for an education,
not an eyeful.
Besides, think of the health
benefits. What could be more
American than taking in a little
sun on the way to class. Why
the reduction of auto accidents
involving students rushing back
from northern beaches and bars
alone should make everyone
wish the immediate elimination
of this childish regulation!
In keeping with the campaign
a number of slogans have been
suggested. "If It's Pressed, Don't
Wear It." "Be Comfortable,
Stimulate a Professor." And of
course, you can make up your
own.
I urge one and all to take up
this issue because at the rate
we're going there won't be many
worthy issues left.

• Bad Influence
Editor, The Daily:
I agree with Terry Inch, class
of '61, (The Daily, May 23) that
it's highly unfortunate that only
40 percent of the student body
voted in the last election. How
ever, I feel sure that even if 100
percent had voted, Dave Harris
still would have won by a fair
margin.
To find the true reasons for
Dave's victory you will have to
look a little deeper than at just
the size of the electorate. You
will have to look at the forces
which led Stanford students to
vote for a rebel.
As a freshman I know that
one of the strongest influences
on my classmates is that of the
Wilbur Sponsors. I realize gen
eralizations are not always fair,
but the majority of the sponsors
I've met are radical, whether
outspoken like Dave or not.
What's more, because of admin
istration concessions, the Wil
bur Sponsors have remained a
self-perpetuating group; thus,
they will continue to impress
their radical ideas on freshmen.
This leads to the real ques
tion, who influences the spon
sors? More generally, who in
fluences Stanford students? Ob
viously the faculty, and many,
many members of the faculty
are radical. Again, I have to
speak from experience.
At the beginning of second
quarter, my mathematics class
was dismissed by Mr. Kowalski
because he refused to teach in
the ROTC building. Last Friday
I saw my first quarter English
TA, Mr. Addams, sitting on
President Sterling's window sill,
encouraging the anti-draft dem
onstrators,
Certainly these two examples
are extreme, but they suggest
what is often a more subtle radi
calism imposed on students by a
large section of the faculty. In
fact, I'm sure that many of the
"free thinkers" who voted for
Dave were merely reflecting
their instructors' ideas.
As an afterthought, contrary
to the recent article in Western
Politica, some intellectuals are
not liberal. If you want to see
a different kind of professor
molding (is there a better
word?) Stanford students, Mr.
Inch, it is your right and your
duty as a donating alumnus to
demand a change on The Farm,

• Development
Program
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to suggest that
the proposals of Dave Harris
et. al. be viewed as an attempted


"First, Premier Ky, you must learn the principles of democracy ..
community development pro
gram—an attempt at an altera
tion of the public culture of the
University with the intent of
transforming the way that the
members feel about themselves.
Cooperation and suggestions
in this attempt might focus
upon the evident need of increas
ing the opportunities of the
members of the community for
self-realization. This increased
opportunity should be available
to the students in their search
for life-models in a period of
transition, to the faculty in
their goal of transmitting the
excitement of intellecual discov
ery and of providing models of
another culture (subculture if
you will) and to the administra
tors in their role of providing
the resources and settings best
facilitating the attainment of
community goals.
The attempts to reformulate
student identity and to increase
the participation of students in
shaping a better order should
be recognized as legitimate ef
forts to deal with the frustra
tions of the present environ
ment. This normative position
rests ultimately on a personal
philosophy of education but
justification is offered in terms
of public goals and norms.
Present student frustrations
have their basis in the depart
mentalization of knowledge and
in the isolation of classroom
learning from personal develop
ment. (See Joseph Katz and
Nevitt Sanford for doubts on
this score.)
These are not by any means
the sole characteristics of uni
versity organization and opera

tion which contribute to the
process of turning excited, hope
ful freshmen into pragmatic,
other-directed, what-good-is-this
academic-crud upperclassmen.
What might lead one to ex
tend the participation hypothe
sis beyond the confines of the
psych lab to the larger commun
ity?
Dare we think that cultural
dynamics are not restricted to
primitive societies but operate
in the very Quad itself? Do we
recognize that the operation of
the present academic process
functions more to alert the sub
jects of the operations to the
idiosyncratic cues of high status
people — instilling a life-goal of
meeting environmental tests of
personal worth rather than to
invoke and inspire a search for
truth and a life-goal of self-ex
tending creativity?
If we can see past the wishful
thoughts and the socially ap
proved nice-things-to-say, per
haps we can recognize that a call
to a new identity is a legitimate
and reasonable response to exist
ing conditions.
But to be successful, "there
must be commitment to the
change, and others must accord
it recognition and do all the
things needed to reinforce and
consolidate it so that a sense of
new identity can actually be at
tained (Ward Goodenough, 1963,
p. 291.)

• A Dungeon ?
Editor, The Daily:
In response to Allan Christe
low's letter of May 20th, I be
lieve that Stanford is justified
in calling itself a university,

meaning that Stanford is at
least as much of a university as
Berkeley, Harvard, or Oxford.
Stanford may not measure up
to Mr. Christelows' "ideal"
standards, but then again, many
of us have different conceptions
of the ideal.
I do not feel that Stanford is
perfect, that Stanford should
be controlled Ry outside alumni
pressure, that students should
be made to conform to some
clean-cut image, or that ROTC
students should be coerced into
donating their blood. However,
simply because we have several
problems in the university, this
does not mean that Stanford is
leading American society "down
the road to infamy."
In previous years, Stanford
students have been active in civil
rights work, the Peace Corps,
the Ravenswood tutorial, num
erous work projects, Vista, and
assorted student political orga
nizations.
Mr. Christelow cannot fairly
argue that Stanford students are
apathetic and uncritical. Stu
dents do take an interest in the
"harsh reality of the outside
world," and they have made
honest attempts to improve it.
Some of the credit for motivat
ing student activity belongs to
Sanford University as it now
exists in its, admittedly, imper
fect form.
Stanford is not the stultify
ing dungeon that Mr. Christelow
describes, nor is it a factory for
the production of machine parts.
It has been used as a vantage
point from wihch students have
re-evaluated many aspects of
the "surrounding world."
Unfortunately, many students
often become frustrated, per
haps like Mr. Christelow, when
they realize that the really big
problem of our age—the possi
bility of world war and the wave
of revolution sweeping Africa,
Asia and South America — are
beyond student control and fre
quently beyond our still limited
understanding.

• Second-Rate School
Editor, The Daily:
Stanford University's 'leap to
greatness' would be better
termed 'stumbling mediocrity'.
The so-called 'Harvard of the
West' is guilty of the following
cardinal sins:
• Blatant religious discrimi
nation (for over seventy years):
for refusing (as recently as one
week ago) to let Jews hold ser
vices on campus other than in
a gaudy Christian church whose
symbology is offensive even to
many campus Christians.
• Obsequious kowtowing to
alumni criticism: for suspending
a Freshman athlete from the
track team because his hair was
too long and thus offended a
few well-heeled alumni.
• Giving academic credit for
soldier courses (ROTC), the aca
demic content of which has been
controversial at best.
• Having a sloppily cata
logued and even more sloppily
run main library. A first-class
library is the sine qua non of a
great university. There is no
question where that leaves Stan
ford.
Like some people, Stanford is
more concerned with its image
than with itself. Are not all of
these unmistakable signs of a
second-rate university?

•Arrive? Never!
Editor, The Dally:
The Freshman Daily (May 17)
was very interesting, but in
some ways disconcerting.
After reading about Wilbur,
Civ, the personal voice in En
glish and any number of other
editorials about how freshmen
look at things, two disturbing
comments stood out most in my
mind: first, that of the Roble
girl who said "I'd change no
thing . . . I'm crazy about every
aspect of this place," and even
more, the remarke from Art
Fisher's column entitled "Fresh
men: You Are Here—But When
Will You Arrive?" that "Kid,
you're just a little freshman and
you don't know what's happen
ing."
Despite the risk of sounding
like someone who is ready to
solve the world's problems at the
end of the freshman year, I
think that both these comments
miss one of the most vitally im
portant attitudes one can ever
hope to cultivate: that of con
sructive dissatisfaction.
No society, such as Stanford
University, is so good that every
aspect of it should remain un
changed; Mr. Fisher's article re
flects the same absence of con
structive dissatisfaction as the
freshman comment, but in a
much more serious way. I ques
tion whether the senior who
would say to a freshman or any
other student, silently or other
wise, that "Kid, you're just a
little freshman and don't know
what's happening'' doesn't have
a very good idea himself of the
changes he has undergone dur
ing his four years at Stanford.
"Freshmen: You Are Here—
But When Will You Arrive?" ex
horts Mr. Fisher. I don't want
to arrive, if that means that at
the end of my senior year, I'll
think that I realize all the im
plications of my college experi
ences. I'm glad to be a fresh
man, just as I'll be glad to be a
sophomore, junior, and senior.
Because for every mistake 1
make this year, there was some
thing learned about myself or
others that was so valuable that
I was glad to be wrong in the
learning, so long as I learned.
Mr. Fisher tells us freshmen
that when we are seniors, we
will have changed and when we
realize that, we "will have made
it." He says further that until
we have made this realization,
"It's all Frosh Week until then."
Does he mean that to imply that
when we are seniors, we will
know what it's all about?
I hope not, and I think not.
If my ideas are idealistic, they
do not ignore experience. If be
ing a freshman means a little
bungling through life and some
realizations of ignorance, I'm
glad to be a freshman. I'm hap
py to know that I still have a lot
to learn, and that I always will;
I'm happy to know that I'll
never arrive.

• Rewarding Seminar
Editor, The Daily:
Because the Freshman Semi
nar program (discussed in May
17's Freshman Edition of The
Daily) is made up of unique
groups of individuals studying
relatively unrelated topics, it is
practically impossible to make
general statements about the
program as a whole.
By taking part in one of these
groups ("Modern Ballads and
Their Backgrounds" with Profes
sor Claude Simpson), I enjoyed
a wide exchange of knowledge
injected with personal theories.
That is, I found a high level of
intra-group communication of
specialized educational value
which both illustrated back
ground research and opened wide
the gates for individual study.
I left the seminar with what
I feel is an enlightened curiosity,
a feeling of accomplishment and
potential, and a knowledge
which I have found both enjoy
able and practical. I consider
this participation in the Fresh
man Seminar program one of
my most rewarding experiences
at Stanford.

• Common Standards
Editor, The Daily:
So you received ten letters
backing the position of Pat Mor
rison, who refused to co-operate
with his track coach when asked
to have his lovely locks trimmed.
Well, here is one letter which
does not back either Pat or you.
To a grown man—it appears
as perfectly silly that such ac
tions are so important. Pat
must conform to some common
standards. He wears pants,
doesn't he?
I have had more friends who
never attended Stanford kid me
about the situation. They get
lots of laughs out of you "kids."
We Stanford alumni really take
a beating because of the child
ish antics of a very few stu
dents.
This is written in the thought
you might appreciate knowing
how most of we old timers feel.
Please, don't follow Berkeley's
example!
ROY F. REINEMAN,
Covlna, Calif.
Editor, The Daily:
Stanford's first sit-in is now
history. If it is to be remem
bered at all, it will be remember
ed as a dismal failure; it could
not have been anything else.
Speaking as one who is sympa
thetic with the goals of the
"New Left" and the anti-Viet
nam war movements, I would
like to offer a few. thoughts as
to why the sit-in was doomed
from the start.
The technique of the sit-in
(at least in this generation) de
veloped out of the civil rights
movement in the South and has
been exported to other areas and
issues largely by those active
in the civil rights movement.
Yet the conditions under which
the technique succeeded in the
South were perhaps more im
portant to the success of the
movement than the sit-in tech
nique itself. It is this lesson
which the Stanford sit-in ig
nored.
• Non-violent civil disobedi
ence is an appeal to the public
conscience—not a method of co
ercing an individual.
• As an appeal to the public
conscience, it must carry such
moral justification as to over
come the democratic presump
tion against extra-legal meth
ods of protest.
• Moral justification and the
pragmatic concern for expedi
ency and utility cannot totally
be separated. These factors
which, under given circum
star e c will make the sit-in
~ble ? i compelling will
>r iQ Iso to -ake it morally
justiaJble—and vill make the
moral justification apparent to
the larger society.
a. Civil disobedience should
be used only when all other
existing remedies have been
exhausted; when every tradi
tional approach has been tried
and found wanting. Why did
the protesters' overwhelming
demand to have the Selective
Service test cancelled manifest
itself only days before the test
was scheduled? Would anyone
expect the faculty or adminis
tration to act on such short
notice when the tests had been
scheduled publicly for months?
Wasn't the impression con
veyed to the student body that
the demonstrators' moral re
vulsion to the test had ma
terialized overnight?
b. The goal of a sit-in must
be capable of precise and con
sistent articulation. Such was
the goal of the Southern civil
rights demonstrations. They
were demanding the right to
be free from specific forms of
racial discrimination — rights
guaranteed to them by the
Federal Constitution. What
was the goal of the Stanford
sit-in? Was it the complicity
of the University in the Selec
tive Service System? Such
complicity is wrong only if the
Selective Service System is
wrong. Was the System wrong
because it discriminated in fav
or of upper middle-class col
lege students? If so, were the
demonstrators calling for uni
versal military training, aboli
tion of conscription, or some
intermediate course? Did they
oppose the test simply on the
grounds that it aided the im
moral war in Vietnam? If the
war itself is immoral, can one
be criticized for preferring a
student exemption to the risk
of being sent to kill those who
we have no right to kij'?
The sit-in was a failure be
cause it was conducted without
regard to the essential nature
and function of civil disobedi
ence.

• Unfortunate
Approach
Editor, The Daily:
The demonstrators picketing
President Sterling's office pro
testing the use of Stanford as a
Selective Service Examination
Center are using this contro
versy to register their opposition
to the Draft in general and to
United States policy in the Viet
nam war. It is unfortunate that
this partcular even should have
been chosen as the vehicle of
protest, for it has resulted in a
conflict of the principles of the
demonstrators themselves and
has offended rather than merely
awakened a large number of
the Stanford men who consider
it a great convenience to be able
to take the examination on cam
pus.
Many of these demonstrators
are among those who are de
manding the right to be able to
obtain contraceptives from the
University Health Service, vet
these same students would deny
others the right to take the
Draft test on campus, if they so
desire. These particular protest
ers are demanding one right
while denying another. The con
traceptive question may not be
totally analagous to the Draft
test controversy, but neverthe
less, these demonstrators should
maintain some degree of consis
tency in their beliefs and actions
if they wish to avoid being la
beled hypocrites.

I would strongly urge these
protesting students, if they sin
cerely desire greater acceptance
of their ideas and values, to dis
continue this particular type of
demonstration which can only
do harm to the concepts they
stand for in the long run.

• Wrongly Directed
Editor, The Daily:
Thursday night during dinner,
mimeographed sheets were dis
tributed in the Wilbur dining
rooms, requesting support for a
vigil in President Sterling's of
fice. The expressed purpose of
this vigil was to "demand our
rights ... to enjoin the Univer
sity from cooperating with and
endorsing a rotten (sic) system
by giving the next deferment
test." We do not object to these
students expressing their views.
We do, however, feel that they
are protesting in the wrong
place and to the wrong person.
The draft test was given on a
voluntary basis. In making avail
able classroom space, we feel
that President Sterling was
merely cooperating with student
desire for a convenient place to
take the test. In doing this, nei
ther he nor the University was
"giving" nor necessarily "en
dorsing" these exams, as was
maintained by those sponsoring
the vigil. The test was given by
the Selective Service, to only
those students who, having con
sidered all alternatives, chose to
take it. If everyone has the right
to decide for himself whether to
take the test, those who do want
to should certainly be able to
take it at a convenient location.
Legitimate protest of the draft
policy should be directed to those
directly responsible—to the Se
lective Service—and not to the
President of the University.

• Praising Wert
Editor, The Daily:
A large number of students
counter-demonstrating in front
of President Sterling's office
were very favorably impressed
with Dean Wert's statement to
the sit-in protesters. The state
men made it abundantly clear
that President Sterling was will
ing to meet with five or six stu
dents in a private discussion;
privacy and the absence of news
media is a prerequisite for any
meaningful and intelligent dia
logue.
The protesters were given am
ple time to present their posi
tion through normal channels
(such as the Committee of Fif
teen) during the several months
since the draft exam at Stanford
was announced, but instead they
delayed action until one exam
had already been given.
The continuation of the sit-in
after Dean Wert's statement was
made served no purpose other
than obstructing normal activity
in the President's office, since
the draft exam would not be can
celled in spite of the demonstra
tors' effort to deny the right to
take the exam from those who
wished to take it.
The diciplinary action the pro
testers will receive has definite
ly been earned, and prompt ac
tion should be taken by the stu
dent judicial council.

• Activists Not Listening
Editor, The Daily:
I spoke to a youth who was
handing out mimeographed ma
terial on The Sit-in at the White
Memorial Plaza at noon on Mon
day, May 23. I asked him why he
was dressed in such an unkempt
way. He said that he liked it
that way. I replied that it was
offensive to me and I pointed
out to him that his feet were
very dirty. He answered that
that was because he was bare
foot. I suggested that he must
be quite young to be so careless
of his appearance and he admit
ted that he was very young. I
realize now that I should have
admonished this child to go
home to his mother.
In his editorial in The Stan
ford Daily of May 24, Mr. Roise
predicts a rise in student activ

ism at Stanford in 1966. Some of
us have been around the cam
pus for a long time. In fact we
have devoted most our lives to
Stanford students. Never under
estimate the power of a woman!
This is one woman, and there
are many faculty wives like me,
who will be active if necessary
next Fall. We will not permit a
small group of idealistic, but re
bellious and misguided adoles
cent beatniks led by graduate
Teaching Assistants, who state
that "actions of the faculty seem
to them to be an appalling in
dication of moral bankruptcy
and intellectual cowardice" to
wreck our university. If anyone
is guilty of not listening it is
the student activist. Perhaps the
dirt in his ears prevents him
from hearing.
My husband is not morally
bankrupt or an intellectual cow

• Teaching The Faculty
Editor, The Daily:
Now that the sit-in is over and
we can try to assess the respon
sibility for the breakdown in
communications that led to it, let
us not forget to include the re
sponsibility of the faculty. The
fact is that the students did
not act until the faculty had re
fused to act.
It has been said that the fac
ulty could not have considered
the problem of the draft at their
meeting last Tuesday because
they had spent so much time on
classified contracts. That is un
doubtedly true. But why did they
have to wait until last Tuesday
to consider the matter?
Professors at Brandeis raised
the issue more than two months
ago. And why did they have to
wait until last Tuesday to con
sider classified contracts? That
issue was raised last December
by the GCC Newsletter. Have the
faculty stopped reading the
newspapers?
In this situation the students
were very careful not to violate
faculty prerogatives. But it
seems that the faculty will not
consider issues until students
have violated those prerogatives.
Why should students have to
tell their teachers that they are
tacitly condoning a possible vio
lation of academic freedom?
Why should students have to
tell their teachers that they are
condoning the participation of
the University in what may be
an immoral system? But it
seems that students do have to
tell their teachers, and it seems
that they have to do it violently.
Maybe the faculty have learned
as much from this incident as
the rest of us hope to have
learned. But if not, I am afraid
that we can expect more sit-ins.
And maybe next time they will
be in the offices of the Executive
Committee of the Academic
Council.

• Showing Their Colors
Editor, Th<> Daily:
There is a final chapter to the
story of the draft protest, which
didn't make monday's Daily:
After the demonstrators had
left the President's office, and
had walked to his home to dis
cover that he was away for the
weekend, they returned to cam
pus by the quickest route, frater
nity row. Boys on the lawn of the
ATO house shouted "It would

take three of you chickenshits
to make one of us!" and other
things they thought appropriate
to the occasion.
Boys at the Beta Theta Pi and
Phi Gamma Delta houses follow
ed suit, with the more inventive
Betas running up to their bal
cony to bombard the tired pro
testers with water balloons.
This self-comment says more
about the fraternity "system"
than any outsider ever could.
MARLENE CHARYN

• Decision-Making
Editor, The Daily:
The recent sit-in in the office
of President Sterling served to
dramatize an issue of fundamen
tal and long-standing importance
to everyone at Stanford Univer
sity. Can Stanford University
become the community of schol
ars which it claims to be?
The events of the past week-

end have shown that we are far
from attaining this goal. The
lack of willingness to communi
cate on the part of the adminis
tration has never been as clear
ly evident than in the unilateral
decision to hold a draft test on
campus which raises serious
questions for all at the Univer
sity.
It has also been evident with
regard to the issues of social
regs, liquor and religion on
which the administration
evinced little or no desire to act
until the application of power
on the part of some other group
was imminent.
It is true that the committee
of fifteen, the revival of LASSU
as a meaningful decision-making
body, and student participation
on certain committees has im
proved the situation somewhat
in the past few years.
However the total unwilling
ness of the administration to
consult students and revise on
the question of the di'aft test
before and after the sit-in indi
cates that the basic problem
hasn't been solved.
The desire of the administra
tion to substitute power for dis
cussion in this instance raises
further questions — the stu
dents who sat in tried are about
to be tried for violation of the
fundamental standard.
In a genuine community, the
basic standard of conduct should
be applicable to all within it,
not just one segment of its pop
ulation. It is without a doubt
that the intransigence evidenced
by President Sterling hurt the
Stanford community at least as
much as the action taken and
persisted in by the students as a
result.
Who, however, is going to try
him for violation of a fundamen
tal standard?
If Stanford is ever to become
a community in any meaningful
sense, communication, rather
than power struggle must play
the major role in University de
cision-making.
In addition, any basic stand
ard of conduct which is adopted
should be made applicable to all.

• Art Of Persuasion
Editor, The
It seems to me that much of
the enlightened campus dialogue
regarding this country's involve

ment in Viet Nam is failing in
its intended goal of awakening
anti-war sentiment. One of the
most obvious and most easily
corrected reasons for the unper
suasiveness of this dialogue is
the stereotype "beatnik" image
which many of the activists
convey to the uninitiated pub
lic.
The long hair and sandals and
beards of many articulate stu
dents cannot help but subtract
from the overall appeal of their
arguments to an audience which
is generally unaccustomed to
looking beyond surface appear
ance. Moreover, the national
audience welcomes the oppor
tunity to stereotype the student
activist as "just another beard
ed mal content, probably a Com
munist, and maybe a homosex
ual." Stereotyping, though some
times helpful, in this case mere
ly relieves the public of the bur
densome task of critical evalua
tion, when critical evaluation is
just what the activists want to

promote.
The tendency to stereotype,
prevalent among the uneducated
and among some politicians, is
sad—even tragic. But, it is com
mon. To provide the undecided
citizen with such an effortless
escape from a confrontation
with the issue neither does jus
tice to the war, to the citizen,
nor to the Student Left.
Of course, most students feel
that personal freedom is the
basis of their protest. That in
cludes the freedom to dress ac
cording to individual choice.
Freedom seems to me to rank
second only to happiness in the
hierarchy of human values. To
voluntarily give up any freedom
is an act with grave political
and philosophical implications
and should by no means be done
lightly. However, a few people
are dedicated not only to living
in the world, but to making the
world a better place in which to
live. For these few the casual
exercise of every freedom may
be costly in terms of accom
plishment.
To understand that I am not
advocating conformity, the issue
of personal freedom must be
put into perspective. Now, if
sprinter Pat Morrison wants to
let his hair grow to an unusual
length, that's his business. He
isn't trying to convince anyone
to think, or by implication, to do
as he does. His hair is only his
business.
But, the political activists are
engaged in the art of persua
sion, and they are foolish if
they believe that their appeal
goes out to a purely logical pub
lic. The SCPV, it is true, is not
trying to set fashions in hair
style any more than Morrison,
but only the naive orator fails
to see the irrational association
between the content of speech
and the appearance of speaker.
The successful orator capitalizes
upon this fact.
To those who at this point re
mind me that the student move
ment is also a protest against
ignorance and irrationality, not
a concession to it, I ask that
they refer that reminder to the
student leaders, who conceive
their own role and the role of
the university as one of leader
ship. How can there be leader
ship without a following?
It is an imperfect world where
certain personal freedoms, like
the freedom to express oneself
through the choice of clothes or

hair style, must be inhibited in
order to further some other
freedoms, like the freedom to
compete equally for public senti
ment alongside the models of
middleclass values. Those lead
ers who recognize the necessity
of coming out of the philosophi
cal ivory tower to establish con
tact with a non-philosophical
world should see this compro
mise as the least of many evils.
Some, obviously, refuse to
make that compromise. It seems
to me that their unwillingness
to compromise sheds some light
on the sincerity of their com
mitment to the goal of peace in
Viet Nam.
RON GARRISON
• Conflicting Demands
Editor, The Daily:
A basic contradiction emerges
in two of the recent protest
movements here at Stanford.
The SSRF wishes the univer
sity to supply contraceptives to
anyone who wants them with
the idea that each student would
then be able to make his (her)
own moral decision. That's fine.
But now the most recent
group proposes exactly the op
posite: that the individual stu
dent should not be allowed by
his individual choice (whether
moral or otherwise) to take the
selective service draft test on
university proper. This same
group indicts the faculty as a
unit for not supporting students
in a (now) redefined cause of
student particiaption in decision
making. This is truly an inter
esting case, since the decision
to hold a draft test was hardly
made at Building 10.
More student involvement in
decision making is certainly
needed at Stanford, but the re
cent draft test is a pretty weak
issue to identify it wih.
PHIL ARNOLD
• October Days
Editor, The Daily:
In trying to see the current
student unrest - administration
intransigence difficulties from a
point of view somewhere be
yond the heat of the conflict,
I am struck by one overriding
concern: What methods are ap
propriate to the solution of prob
lems that arise within a com
munity of scholars and their
students?
It seems to me that the most
appropriate methods would be
those which are the hallmark of
any thinking community: reas
on, definition, articulation, and
dialogue. This must be the case
so long as all protagonists are
concerned with preserving the
"community."
The present situation at Stan
ford, from this point of view, is
pretty dismal. The student lead
ers prefer to posit these delicate
issues concerning government
university, war-university, draft
university in the streets. The ad
ministration prefers to ignore
the problem, to be consistently
absent.
As the scene becomes increas
ingly dichotomized, as the pro
tagonists at either extreme ac
celerate the process of detach
ment from one another, cutting
lines of rational communication,
throwing up impenetrable walls
of opaque verbiage of absolutely
no use if dialogue is really de
sider between the extremes, the
possibility of clearly raising and
effectively solving these prob
lems becomes impossible.
Rather than a community of
scholars and students, this scene
is more reminiscent of Petro
grad in the spring of 3917. So
far, the problem, clumsily de
fined even in the pamphlets and
fly-leaves of those who have
raised it, has been articulated
in the manner of peasant muni
tion workers, through slogans at
best, through shouting rallies in
the streets at worst.
And the problem has been
met by an administration unwill
ing to admit the gravity of the
situation, as yet unable to think
out the problem or to take ag
gressively positive measures to
assess the nature of the student
demands and to land on a pro
gram of action which will insure
that the university will not
have to depend on the delicacy
of crowds in White Plaza to
solve these involved and intri
cate issues.
The problem with the bread
riots in Petrograd in 1917 is not
that they were an ineffective
expression of workers' and peas
ants' extreme discontent, but
that they were able to express
only this negative sentiment in
the absence of other viable
channels of communication. And
the problem with the Russian
Provisional Government in 1917
is not that it was a bad govern
ment, but that it was no gov
ernment at all. What can we ex
pect from next October?

• 'If Its Pressed
Editor, The Daily:
Hooray for the emerging Stan
ford. Down with ambivalent dou
ble-standards, bumbling bureau
cracy, and the multiversity-in
dustrial-military behemoth. Since

the election of "artistic social
ist" Dave Harris, Stanford has
made radical progress in identi
fying and confronting the real
issues. First, that bastion of in
trigue, the Electrical Engineer
ing Department, was identified
as a cover, albeit in the open,
for the monstrous CIA. Tlien
came the revelation of the blood
thirsty anti-intelectuallism of
the ROTC. This week, finally,
we're getting to the basic issue,
elimination of the "parentis
pocis" routine with the need
made obvious by the Athletic De
partment. It should be readily
apparent that the length of one's
hair is a private matter and
doesn't even require the "mu
tual consent" of the SSRF.
Furthermore, this leads im
mediately to a more basic issue,
the rights of the Stanford Dollie.
The restrictions on "Quad
clothes," actual and imagined,
must be eliminated. What right
has the University to impose its
ideas of contemporary dress
when such regulations obviously
contribute nothing to intellectual
attainment. Each person should
be free, at least in a university,
to be comfortable, to experi
ment, and to investigate various
modes of thought and apparel.
To the comment that the dis
traction of the Stanford males
by bikini-clad or even topless
damsels would be destructive to
their intellectual endeavors, I
say that this is merely a chal
lenge to the teachers. If their
teaching is stimulating enough,
who need watch the girls. After
all, we're here for an education,
not an eyeful.
Besides, think of the health
benefits. What could be more
American than taking in a little
sun on the way to class. Why
the reduction of auto accidents
involving students rushing back
from northern beaches and bars
alone should make everyone
wish the immediate elimination
of this childish regulation!
In keeping with the campaign
a number of slogans have been
suggested. "If It's Pressed, Don't
Wear It." "Be Comfortable,
Stimulate a Professor." And of
course, you can make up your
own.
I urge one and all to take up
this issue because at the rate
we're going there won't be many
worthy issues left.

• Bad Influence
Editor, The Daily:
I agree with Terry Inch, class
of '61, (The Daily, May 23) that
it's highly unfortunate that only
40 percent of the student body
voted in the last election. How
ever, I feel sure that even if 100
percent had voted, Dave Harris
still would have won by a fair
margin.
To find the true reasons for
Dave's victory you will have to
look a little deeper than at just
the size of the electorate. You
will have to look at the forces
which led Stanford students to
vote for a rebel.
As a freshman I know that
one of the strongest influences
on my classmates is that of the
Wilbur Sponsors. I realize gen
eralizations are not always fair,
but the majority of the sponsors
I've met are radical, whether
outspoken like Dave or not.
What's more, because of admin
istration concessions, the Wil
bur Sponsors have remained a
self-perpetuating group; thus,
they will continue to impress
their radical ideas on freshmen.
This leads to the real ques
tion, who influences the spon
sors? More generally, who in
fluences Stanford students? Ob
viously the faculty, and many,
many members of the faculty
are radical. Again, I have to
speak from experience.
At the beginning of second
quarter, my mathematics class
was dismissed by Mr. Kowalski
because he refused to teach in
the ROTC building. Last Friday
I saw my first quarter English
TA, Mr. Addams, sitting on
President Sterling's window sill,
encouraging the anti-draft dem
onstrators,
Certainly these two examples
are extreme, but they suggest
what is often a more subtle radi
calism imposed on students by a
large section of the faculty. In
fact, I'm sure that many of the
"free thinkers" who voted for
Dave were merely reflecting
their instructors' ideas.
As an afterthought, contrary
to the recent article in Western
Politica, some intellectuals are
not liberal. If you want to see
a different kind of professor
molding (is there a better
word?) Stanford students, Mr.
Inch, it is your right and your
duty as a donating alumnus to
demand a change on The Farm,

• Development
Program
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to suggest that
the proposals of Dave Harris
et. al. be viewed as an attempted


"First, Premier Ky, you must learn the principles of democracy ..
community development pro
gram—an attempt at an altera
tion of the public culture of the
University with the intent of
transforming the way that the
members feel about themselves.
Cooperation and suggestions
in this attempt might focus
upon the evident need of increas
ing the opportunities of the
members of the community for
self-realization. This increased
opportunity should be available
to the students in their search
for life-models in a period of
transition, to the faculty in
their goal of transmitting the
excitement of intellecual discov
ery and of providing models of
another culture (subculture if
you will) and to the administra
tors in their role of providing
the resources and settings best
facilitating the attainment of
community goals.
The attempts to reformulate
student identity and to increase
the participation of students in
shaping a better order should
be recognized as legitimate ef
forts to deal with the frustra
tions of the present environ
ment. This normative position
rests ultimately on a personal
philosophy of education but
justification is offered in terms
of public goals and norms.
Present student frustrations
have their basis in the depart
mentalization of knowledge and
in the isolation of classroom
learning from personal develop
ment. (See Joseph Katz and
Nevitt Sanford for doubts on
this score.)
These are not by any means
the sole characteristics of uni
versity organization and opera

tion which contribute to the
process of turning excited, hope
ful freshmen into pragmatic,
other-directed, what-good-is-this
academic-crud upperclassmen.
What might lead one to ex
tend the participation hypothe
sis beyond the confines of the
psych lab to the larger commun
ity?
Dare we think that cultural
dynamics are not restricted to
primitive societies but operate
in the very Quad itself? Do we
recognize that the operation of
the present academic process
functions more to alert the sub
jects of the operations to the
idiosyncratic cues of high status
people — instilling a life-goal of
meeting environmental tests of
personal worth rather than to
invoke and inspire a search for
truth and a life-goal of self-ex
tending creativity?
If we can see past the wishful
thoughts and the socially ap
proved nice-things-to-say, per
haps we can recognize that a call
to a new identity is a legitimate
and reasonable response to exist
ing conditions.
But to be successful, "there
must be commitment to the
change, and others must accord
it recognition and do all the
things needed to reinforce and
consolidate it so that a sense of
new identity can actually be at
tained (Ward Goodenough, 1963,
p. 291.)
DENNIS J SIMS
• A Dungeon ?
Editor, The Daily:
In response to Allan Christe
low's letter of May 20th, I be
lieve that Stanford is justified
in calling itself a university,

meaning that Stanford is at
least as much of a university as
Berkeley, Harvard, or Oxford.
Stanford may not measure up
to Mr. Christelows' "ideal"
standards, but then again, many
of us have different conceptions
of the ideal.
I do not feel that Stanford is
perfect, that Stanford should
be controlled Ry outside alumni
pressure, that students should
be made to conform to some
clean-cut image, or that ROTC
students should be coerced into
donating their blood. However,
simply because we have several
problems in the university, this
does not mean that Stanford is
leading American society "down
the road to infamy."
In previous years, Stanford
students have been active in civil
rights work, the Peace Corps,
the Ravenswood tutorial, num
erous work projects, Vista, and
assorted student political orga
nizations.
Mr. Christelow cannot fairly
argue that Stanford students are
apathetic and uncritical. Stu
dents do take an interest in the
"harsh reality of the outside
world," and they have made
honest attempts to improve it.
Some of the credit for motivat
ing student activity belongs to
Sanford University as it now
exists in its, admittedly, imper
fect form.
Stanford is not the stultify
ing dungeon that Mr. Christelow
describes, nor is it a factory for
the production of machine parts.
It has been used as a vantage
point from wihch students have
re-evaluated many aspects of
the "surrounding world."
Unfortunately, many students
often become frustrated, per
haps like Mr. Christelow, when
they realize that the really big
problem of our age—the possi
bility of world war and the wave
of revolution sweeping Africa,
Asia and South America — are
beyond student control and fre
quently beyond our still limited
understanding.

• Second-Rate School
Editor, The Daily:
Stanford University's 'leap to
greatness' would be better
termed 'stumbling mediocrity'.
The so-called 'Harvard of the
West' is guilty of the following
cardinal sins:
• Blatant religious discrimi
nation (for over seventy years):
for refusing (as recently as one
week ago) to let Jews hold ser
vices on campus other than in
a gaudy Christian church whose
symbology is offensive even to
many campus Christians.
• Obsequious kowtowing to
alumni criticism: for suspending
a Freshman athlete from the
track team because his hair was
too long and thus offended a
few well-heeled alumni.
• Giving academic credit for
soldier courses (ROTC), the aca
demic content of which has been
controversial at best.
• Having a sloppily cata
logued and even more sloppily
run main library. A first-class
library is the sine qua non of a
great university. There is no
question where that leaves Stan
ford.
Like some people, Stanford is
more concerned with its image
than with itself. Are not all of
these unmistakable signs of a
second-rate university?

•Arrive? Never!
Editor, The Dally:
The Freshman Daily (May 17)
was very interesting, but in
some ways disconcerting.
After reading about Wilbur,
Civ, the personal voice in En
glish and any number of other
editorials about how freshmen
look at things, two disturbing
comments stood out most in my
mind: first, that of the Roble
girl who said "I'd change no
thing . . . I'm crazy about every
aspect of this place," and even
more, the remarke from Art
Fisher's column entitled "Fresh
men: You Are Here—But When
Will You Arrive?" that "Kid,
you're just a little freshman and
you don't know what's happen
ing."
Despite the risk of sounding
like someone who is ready to
solve the world's problems at the
end of the freshman year, I
think that both these comments
miss one of the most vitally im
portant attitudes one can ever
hope to cultivate: that of con
sructive dissatisfaction.
No society, such as Stanford
University, is so good that every
aspect of it should remain un
changed; Mr. Fisher's article re
flects the same absence of con
structive dissatisfaction as the
freshman comment, but in a
much more serious way. I ques
tion whether the senior who
would say to a freshman or any
other student, silently or other
wise, that "Kid, you're just a
little freshman and don't know
what's happening'' doesn't have
a very good idea himself of the
changes he has undergone dur
ing his four years at Stanford.
"Freshmen: You Are Here—
But When Will You Arrive?" ex
horts Mr. Fisher. I don't want
to arrive, if that means that at
the end of my senior year, I'll
think that I realize all the im
plications of my college experi
ences. I'm glad to be a fresh
man, just as I'll be glad to be a
sophomore, junior, and senior.
Because for every mistake 1
make this year, there was some
thing learned about myself or
others that was so valuable that
I was glad to be wrong in the
learning, so long as I learned.
Mr. Fisher tells us freshmen
that when we are seniors, we
will have changed and when we
realize that, we "will have made
it." He says further that until
we have made this realization,
"It's all Frosh Week until then."
Does he mean that to imply that
when we are seniors, we will
know what it's all about?
I hope not, and I think not.
If my ideas are idealistic, they
do not ignore experience. If be
ing a freshman means a little
bungling through life and some
realizations of ignorance, I'm
glad to be a freshman. I'm hap
py to know that I still have a lot
to learn, and that I always will;
I'm happy to know that I'll
never arrive.

• Rewarding Seminar
Editor, The Daily:
Because the Freshman Semi
nar program (discussed in May
17's Freshman Edition of The
Daily) is made up of unique
groups of individuals studying
relatively unrelated topics, it is
practically impossible to make
general statements about the
program as a whole.
By taking part in one of these
groups ("Modern Ballads and
Their Backgrounds" with Profes
sor Claude Simpson), I enjoyed
a wide exchange of knowledge
injected with personal theories.
That is, I found a high level of
intra-group communication of
specialized educational value
which both illustrated back
ground research and opened wide
the gates for individual study.
I left the seminar with what
I feel is an enlightened curiosity,
a feeling of accomplishment and
potential, and a knowledge
which I have found both enjoy
able and practical. I consider
this participation in the Fresh
man Seminar program one of
my most rewarding experiences
at Stanford.

• Common Standards
Editor, The Daily:
So you received ten letters
backing the position of Pat Mor
rison, who refused to co-operate
with his track coach when asked
to have his lovely locks trimmed.
Well, here is one letter which
does not back either Pat or you.
To a grown man—it appears
as perfectly silly that such ac
tions are so important. Pat
must conform to some common
standards. He wears pants,
doesn't he?
I have had more friends who
never attended Stanford kid me
about the situation. They get
lots of laughs out of you "kids."
We Stanford alumni really take
a beating because of the child
ish antics of a very few stu
dents.
This is written in the thought
you might appreciate knowing
how most of we old timers feel.
Please, don't follow Berkeley's
example!
ROY F. REINEMAN,
Covlna, Calif.
Editor, The Daily:
Stanford's first sit-in is now
history. If it is to be remem
bered at all, it will be remember
ed as a dismal failure; it could
not have been anything else.
Speaking as one who is sympa
thetic with the goals of the
"New Left" and the anti-Viet
nam war movements, I would
like to offer a few. thoughts as
to why the sit-in was doomed
from the start.
The technique of the sit-in
(at least in this generation) de
veloped out of the civil rights
movement in the South and has
been exported to other areas and
issues largely by those active
in the civil rights movement.
Yet the conditions under which
the technique succeeded in the
South were perhaps more im
portant to the success of the
movement than the sit-in tech
nique itself. It is this lesson
which the Stanford sit-in ig
nored.
• Non-violent civil disobedi
ence is an appeal to the public
conscience—not a method of co
ercing an individual.
• As an appeal to the public
conscience, it must carry such
moral justification as to over
come the democratic presump
tion against extra-legal meth
ods of protest.
• Moral justification and the
pragmatic concern for expedi
ency and utility cannot totally
be separated. These factors
which, under given circum
star e c will make the sit-in
~ble ? i compelling will
>r iQ Iso to -ake it morally
justiaJble—and vill make the
moral justification apparent to
the larger society.
a. Civil disobedience should
be used only when all other
existing remedies have been
exhausted; when every tradi
tional approach has been tried
and found wanting. Why did
the protesters' overwhelming
demand to have the Selective
Service test cancelled manifest
itself only days before the test
was scheduled? Would anyone
expect the faculty or adminis
tration to act on such short
notice when the tests had been
scheduled publicly for months?
Wasn't the impression con
veyed to the student body that
the demonstrators' moral re
vulsion to the test had ma
terialized overnight?
b. The goal of a sit-in must
be capable of precise and con
sistent articulation. Such was
the goal of the Southern civil
rights demonstrations. They
were demanding the right to
be free from specific forms of
racial discrimination — rights
guaranteed to them by the
Federal Constitution. What
was the goal of the Stanford
sit-in? Was it the complicity
of the University in the Selec
tive Service System? Such
complicity is wrong only if the
Selective Service System is
wrong. Was the System wrong
because it discriminated in fav
or of upper middle-class col
lege students? If so, were the
demonstrators calling for uni
versal military training, aboli
tion of conscription, or some
intermediate course? Did they
oppose the test simply on the
grounds that it aided the im
moral war in Vietnam? If the
war itself is immoral, can one
be criticized for preferring a
student exemption to the risk
of being sent to kill those who
we have no right to kij'?
The sit-in was a failure be
cause it was conducted without
regard to the essential nature
and function of civil disobedi
ence.

• Unfortunate
Approach
Editor, The Daily:
The demonstrators picketing
President Sterling's office pro
testing the use of Stanford as a
Selective Service Examination
Center are using this contro
versy to register their opposition
to the Draft in general and to
United States policy in the Viet
nam war. It is unfortunate that
this partcular even should have
been chosen as the vehicle of
protest, for it has resulted in a
conflict of the principles of the
demonstrators themselves and
has offended rather than merely
awakened a large number of
the Stanford men who consider
it a great convenience to be able
to take the examination on cam
pus.
Many of these demonstrators
are among those who are de
manding the right to be able to
obtain contraceptives from the
University Health Service, vet
these same students would deny
others the right to take the
Draft test on campus, if they so
desire. These particular protest
ers are demanding one right
while denying another. The con
traceptive question may not be
totally analagous to the Draft
test controversy, but neverthe
less, these demonstrators should
maintain some degree of consis
tency in their beliefs and actions
if they wish to avoid being la
beled hypocrites.

I would strongly urge these
protesting students, if they sin
cerely desire greater acceptance
of their ideas and values, to dis
continue this particular type of
demonstration which can only
do harm to the concepts they
stand for in the long run.

• Wrongly Directed
Editor, The Daily:
Thursday night during dinner,
mimeographed sheets were dis
tributed in the Wilbur dining
rooms, requesting support for a
vigil in President Sterling's of
fice. The expressed purpose of
this vigil was to "demand our
rights ... to enjoin the Univer
sity from cooperating with and
endorsing a rotten (sic) system
by giving the next deferment
test." We do not object to these
students expressing their views.
We do, however, feel that they
are protesting in the wrong
place and to the wrong person.
The draft test was given on a
voluntary basis. In making avail
able classroom space, we feel
that President Sterling was
merely cooperating with student
desire for a convenient place to
take the test. In doing this, nei
ther he nor the University was
"giving" nor necessarily "en
dorsing" these exams, as was
maintained by those sponsoring
the vigil. The test was given by
the Selective Service, to only
those students who, having con
sidered all alternatives, chose to
take it. If everyone has the right
to decide for himself whether to
take the test, those who do want
to should certainly be able to
take it at a convenient location.
Legitimate protest of the draft
policy should be directed to those
directly responsible—to the Se
lective Service—and not to the
President of the University.

• Praising Wert
Editor, The Daily:
A large number of students
counter-demonstrating in front
of President Sterling's office
were very favorably impressed
with Dean Wert's statement to
the sit-in protesters. The state
men made it abundantly clear
that President Sterling was will
ing to meet with five or six stu
dents in a private discussion;
privacy and the absence of news
media is a prerequisite for any
meaningful and intelligent dia
logue.
The protesters were given am
ple time to present their posi
tion through normal channels
(such as the Committee of Fif
teen) during the several months
since the draft exam at Stanford
was announced, but instead they
delayed action until one exam
had already been given.
The continuation of the sit-in
after Dean Wert's statement was
made served no purpose other
than obstructing normal activity
in the President's office, since
the draft exam would not be can
celled in spite of the demonstra
tors' effort to deny the right to
take the exam from those who
wished to take it.
The diciplinary action the pro
testers will receive has definite
ly been earned, and prompt ac
tion should be taken by the stu
dent judicial council.

• Activists Not Listening
Editor, The Daily:
I spoke to a youth who was
handing out mimeographed ma
terial on The Sit-in at the White
Memorial Plaza at noon on Mon
day, May 23. I asked him why he
was dressed in such an unkempt
way. He said that he liked it
that way. I replied that it was
offensive to me and I pointed
out to him that his feet were
very dirty. He answered that
that was because he was bare
foot. I suggested that he must
be quite young to be so careless
of his appearance and he admit
ted that he was very young. I
realize now that I should have
admonished this child to go
home to his mother.
In his editorial in The Stan
ford Daily of May 24, Mr. Roise
predicts a rise in student activ

ism at Stanford in 1966. Some of
us have been around the cam
pus for a long time. In fact we
have devoted most our lives to
Stanford students. Never under
estimate the power of a woman!
This is one woman, and there
are many faculty wives like me,
who will be active if necessary
next Fall. We will not permit a
small group of idealistic, but re
bellious and misguided adoles
cent beatniks led by graduate
Teaching Assistants, who state
that "actions of the faculty seem
to them to be an appalling in
dication of moral bankruptcy
and intellectual cowardice" to
wreck our university. If anyone
is guilty of not listening it is
the student activist. Perhaps the
dirt in his ears prevents him
from hearing.
My husband is not morally
bankrupt or an intellectual cow

• Teaching The Faculty
Editor, The Daily:
Now that the sit-in is over and
we can try to assess the respon
sibility for the breakdown in
communications that led to it, let
us not forget to include the re
sponsibility of the faculty. The
fact is that the students did
not act until the faculty had re
fused to act.
It has been said that the fac
ulty could not have considered
the problem of the draft at their
meeting last Tuesday because
they had spent so much time on
classified contracts. That is un
doubtedly true. But why did they
have to wait until last Tuesday
to consider the matter?
Professors at Brandeis raised
the issue more than two months
ago. And why did they have to
wait until last Tuesday to con
sider classified contracts? That
issue was raised last December
by the GCC Newsletter. Have the
faculty stopped reading the
newspapers?
In this situation the students
were very careful not to violate
faculty prerogatives. But it
seems that the faculty will not
consider issues until students
have violated those prerogatives.
Why should students have to
tell their teachers that they are
tacitly condoning a possible vio
lation of academic freedom?
Why should students have to
tell their teachers that they are
condoning the participation of
the University in what may be
an immoral system? But it
seems that students do have to
tell their teachers, and it seems
that they have to do it violently.
Maybe the faculty have learned
as much from this incident as
the rest of us hope to have
learned. But if not, I am afraid
that we can expect more sit-ins.
And maybe next time they will
be in the offices of the Executive
Committee of the Academic
Council.

• Showing Their Colors
Editor, Th<> Daily:
There is a final chapter to the
story of the draft protest, which
didn't make monday's Daily:
After the demonstrators had
left the President's office, and
had walked to his home to dis
cover that he was away for the
weekend, they returned to cam
pus by the quickest route, frater
nity row. Boys on the lawn of the
ATO house shouted "It would

take three of you chickenshits
to make one of us!" and other
things they thought appropriate
to the occasion.
Boys at the Beta Theta Pi and
Phi Gamma Delta houses follow
ed suit, with the more inventive
Betas running up to their bal
cony to bombard the tired pro
testers with water balloons.
This self-comment says more
about the fraternity "system"
than any outsider ever could.
MARLENE CHARYN

• Decision-Making
Editor, The Daily:
The recent sit-in in the office
of President Sterling served to
dramatize an issue of fundamen
tal and long-standing importance
to everyone at Stanford Univer
sity. Can Stanford University
become the community of schol
ars which it claims to be?
The events of the past week-

end have shown that we are far
from attaining this goal. The
lack of willingness to communi
cate on the part of the adminis
tration has never been as clear
ly evident than in the unilateral
decision to hold a draft test on
campus which raises serious
questions for all at the Univer
sity.
It has also been evident with
regard to the issues of social
regs, liquor and religion on
which the administration
evinced little or no desire to act
until the application of power
on the part of some other group
was imminent.
It is true that the committee
of fifteen, the revival of LASSU
as a meaningful decision-making
body, and student participation
on certain committees has im
proved the situation somewhat
in the past few years.
However the total unwilling
ness of the administration to
consult students and revise on
the question of the di'aft test
before and after the sit-in indi
cates that the basic problem
hasn't been solved.
The desire of the administra
tion to substitute power for dis
cussion in this instance raises
further questions — the stu
dents who sat in tried are about
to be tried for violation of the
fundamental standard.
In a genuine community, the
basic standard of conduct should
be applicable to all within it,
not just one segment of its pop
ulation. It is without a doubt
that the intransigence evidenced
by President Sterling hurt the
Stanford community at least as
much as the action taken and
persisted in by the students as a
result.
Who, however, is going to try
him for violation of a fundamen
tal standard?
If Stanford is ever to become
a community in any meaningful
sense, communication, rather
than power struggle must play
the major role in University de
cision-making.
In addition, any basic stand
ard of conduct which is adopted
should be made applicable to all.

• Art Of Persuasion
Editor, The
It seems to me that much of
the enlightened campus dialogue
regarding this country's involve

ment in Viet Nam is failing in
its intended goal of awakening
anti-war sentiment. One of the
most obvious and most easily
corrected reasons for the unper
suasiveness of this dialogue is
the stereotype "beatnik" image
which many of the activists
convey to the uninitiated pub
lic.
The long hair and sandals and
beards of many articulate stu
dents cannot help but subtract
from the overall appeal of their
arguments to an audience which
is generally unaccustomed to
looking beyond surface appear
ance. Moreover, the national
audience welcomes the oppor
tunity to stereotype the student
activist as "just another beard
ed mal content, probably a Com
munist, and maybe a homosex
ual." Stereotyping, though some
times helpful, in this case mere
ly relieves the public of the bur
densome task of critical evalua
tion, when critical evaluation is
just what the activists want to

promote.
The tendency to stereotype,
prevalent among the uneducated
and among some politicians, is
sad—even tragic. But, it is com
mon. To provide the undecided
citizen with such an effortless
escape from a confrontation
with the issue neither does jus
tice to the war, to the citizen,
nor to the Student Left.
Of course, most students feel
that personal freedom is the
basis of their protest. That in
cludes the freedom to dress ac
cording to individual choice.
Freedom seems to me to rank
second only to happiness in the
hierarchy of human values. To
voluntarily give up any freedom
is an act with grave political
and philosophical implications
and should by no means be done
lightly. However, a few people
are dedicated not only to living
in the world, but to making the
world a better place in which to
live. For these few the casual
exercise of every freedom may
be costly in terms of accom
plishment.
To understand that I am not
advocating conformity, the issue
of personal freedom must be
put into perspective. Now, if
sprinter Pat Morrison wants to
let his hair grow to an unusual
length, that's his business. He
isn't trying to convince anyone
to think, or by implication, to do
as he does. His hair is only his
business.
But, the political activists are
engaged in the art of persua
sion, and they are foolish if
they believe that their appeal
goes out to a purely logical pub
lic. The SCPV, it is true, is not
trying to set fashions in hair
style any more than Morrison,
but only the naive orator fails
to see the irrational association
between the content of speech
and the appearance of speaker.
The successful orator capitalizes
upon this fact.
To those who at this point re
mind me that the student move
ment is also a protest against
ignorance and irrationality, not
a concession to it, I ask that
they refer that reminder to the
student leaders, who conceive
their own role and the role of
the university as one of leader
ship. How can there be leader
ship without a following?
It is an imperfect world where
certain personal freedoms, like
the freedom to express oneself
through the choice of clothes or

hair style, must be inhibited in
order to further some other
freedoms, like the freedom to
compete equally for public senti
ment alongside the models of
middleclass values. Those lead
ers who recognize the necessity
of coming out of the philosophi
cal ivory tower to establish con
tact with a non-philosophical
world should see this compro
mise as the least of many evils.
Some, obviously, refuse to
make that compromise. It seems
to me that their unwillingness
to compromise sheds some light
on the sincerity of their com
mitment to the goal of peace in
Viet Nam.
RON GARRISON
• Conflicting Demands
Editor, The Daily:
A basic contradiction emerges
in two of the recent protest
movements here at Stanford.
The SSRF wishes the univer
sity to supply contraceptives to
anyone who wants them with
the idea that each student would
then be able to make his (her)
own moral decision. That's fine.
But now the most recent
group proposes exactly the op
posite: that the individual stu
dent should not be allowed by
his individual choice (whether
moral or otherwise) to take the
selective service draft test on
university proper. This same
group indicts the faculty as a
unit for not supporting students
in a (now) redefined cause of
student particiaption in decision
making. This is truly an inter
esting case, since the decision
to hold a draft test was hardly
made at Building 10.
More student involvement in
decision making is certainly
needed at Stanford, but the re
cent draft test is a pretty weak
issue to identify it wih.
PHIL ARNOLD
• October Days
Editor, The Daily:
In trying to see the current
student unrest - administration
intransigence difficulties from a
point of view somewhere be
yond the heat of the conflict,
I am struck by one overriding
concern: What methods are ap
propriate to the solution of prob
lems that arise within a com
munity of scholars and their
students?
It seems to me that the most
appropriate methods would be
those which are the hallmark of
any thinking community: reas
on, definition, articulation, and
dialogue. This must be the case
so long as all protagonists are
concerned with preserving the
"community."
The present situation at Stan
ford, from this point of view, is
pretty dismal. The student lead
ers prefer to posit these delicate
issues concerning government
university, war-university, draft
university in the streets. The ad
ministration prefers to ignore
the problem, to be consistently
absent.
As the scene becomes increas
ingly dichotomized, as the pro
tagonists at either extreme ac
celerate the process of detach
ment from one another, cutting
lines of rational communication,
throwing up impenetrable walls
of opaque verbiage of absolutely
no use if dialogue is really de
sider between the extremes, the
possibility of clearly raising and
effectively solving these prob
lems becomes impossible.
Rather than a community of
scholars and students, this scene
is more reminiscent of Petro
grad in the spring of 3917. So
far, the problem, clumsily de
fined even in the pamphlets and
fly-leaves of those who have
raised it, has been articulated
in the manner of peasant muni
tion workers, through slogans at
best, through shouting rallies in
the streets at worst.
And the problem has been
met by an administration unwill
ing to admit the gravity of the
situation, as yet unable to think
out the problem or to take ag
gressively positive measures to
assess the nature of the student
demands and to land on a pro
gram of action which will insure
that the university will not
have to depend on the delicacy
of crowds in White Plaza to
solve these involved and intri
cate issues.
The problem with the bread
riots in Petrograd in 1917 is not
that they were an ineffective
expression of workers' and peas
ants' extreme discontent, but
that they were able to express
only this negative sentiment in
the absence of other viable
channels of communication. And
the problem with the Russian
Provisional Government in 1917
is not that it was a bad govern
ment, but that it was no gov
ernment at all. What can we ex
pect from next October?

• 'If Its Pressed
Editor, The Daily:
Hooray for the emerging Stan
ford. Down with ambivalent dou
ble-standards, bumbling bureau
cracy, and the multiversity-in
dustrial-military behemoth. Since

the election of "artistic social
ist" Dave Harris, Stanford has
made radical progress in identi
fying and confronting the real
issues. First, that bastion of in
trigue, the Electrical Engineer
ing Department, was identified
as a cover, albeit in the open,
for the monstrous CIA. Tlien
came the revelation of the blood
thirsty anti-intelectuallism of
the ROTC. This week, finally,
we're getting to the basic issue,
elimination of the "parentis
pocis" routine with the need
made obvious by the Athletic De
partment. It should be readily
apparent that the length of one's
hair is a private matter and
doesn't even require the "mu
tual consent" of the SSRF.
Furthermore, this leads im
mediately to a more basic issue,
the rights of the Stanford Dollie.
The restrictions on "Quad
clothes," actual and imagined,
must be eliminated. What right
has the University to impose its
ideas of contemporary dress
when such regulations obviously
contribute nothing to intellectual
attainment. Each person should
be free, at least in a university,
to be comfortable, to experi
ment, and to investigate various
modes of thought and apparel.
To the comment that the dis
traction of the Stanford males
by bikini-clad or even topless
damsels would be destructive to
their intellectual endeavors, I
say that this is merely a chal
lenge to the teachers. If their
teaching is stimulating enough,
who need watch the girls. After
all, we're here for an education,
not an eyeful.
Besides, think of the health
benefits. What could be more
American than taking in a little
sun on the way to class. Why
the reduction of auto accidents
involving students rushing back
from northern beaches and bars
alone should make everyone
wish the immediate elimination
of this childish regulation!
In keeping with the campaign
a number of slogans have been
suggested. "If It's Pressed, Don't
Wear It." "Be Comfortable,
Stimulate a Professor." And of
course, you can make up your
own.
I urge one and all to take up
this issue because at the rate
we're going there won't be many
worthy issues left.

• Bad Influence
Editor, The Daily:
I agree with Terry Inch, class
of '61, (The Daily, May 23) that
it's highly unfortunate that only
40 percent of the student body
voted in the last election. How
ever, I feel sure that even if 100
percent had voted, Dave Harris
still would have won by a fair
margin.
To find the true reasons for
Dave's victory you will have to
look a little deeper than at just
the size of the electorate. You
will have to look at the forces
which led Stanford students to
vote for a rebel.
As a freshman I know that
one of the strongest influences
on my classmates is that of the
Wilbur Sponsors. I realize gen
eralizations are not always fair,
but the majority of the sponsors
I've met are radical, whether
outspoken like Dave or not.
What's more, because of admin
istration concessions, the Wil
bur Sponsors have remained a
self-perpetuating group; thus,
they will continue to impress
their radical ideas on freshmen.
This leads to the real ques
tion, who influences the spon
sors? More generally, who in
fluences Stanford students? Ob
viously the faculty, and many,
many members of the faculty
are radical. Again, I have to
speak from experience.
At the beginning of second
quarter, my mathematics class
was dismissed by Mr. Kowalski
because he refused to teach in
the ROTC building. Last Friday
I saw my first quarter English
TA, Mr. Addams, sitting on
President Sterling's window sill,
encouraging the anti-draft dem
onstrators,
Certainly these two examples
are extreme, but they suggest
what is often a more subtle radi
calism imposed on students by a
large section of the faculty. In
fact, I'm sure that many of the
"free thinkers" who voted for
Dave were merely reflecting
their instructors' ideas.
As an afterthought, contrary
to the recent article in Western
Politica, some intellectuals are
not liberal. If you want to see
a different kind of professor
molding (is there a better
word?) Stanford students, Mr.
Inch, it is your right and your
duty as a donating alumnus to
demand a change on The Farm,

• Development
Program
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to suggest that
the proposals of Dave Harris
et. al. be viewed as an attempted


"First, Premier Ky, you must learn the principles of democracy ..
community development pro
gram—an attempt at an altera
tion of the public culture of the
University with the intent of
transforming the way that the
members feel about themselves.
Cooperation and suggestions
in this attempt might focus
upon the evident need of increas
ing the opportunities of the
members of the community for
self-realization. This increased
opportunity should be available
to the students in their search
for life-models in a period of
transition, to the faculty in
their goal of transmitting the
excitement of intellecual discov
ery and of providing models of
another culture (subculture if
you will) and to the administra
tors in their role of providing
the resources and settings best
facilitating the attainment of
community goals.
The attempts to reformulate
student identity and to increase
the participation of students in
shaping a better order should
be recognized as legitimate ef
forts to deal with the frustra
tions of the present environ
ment. This normative position
rests ultimately on a personal
philosophy of education but
justification is offered in terms
of public goals and norms.
Present student frustrations
have their basis in the depart
mentalization of knowledge and
in the isolation of classroom
learning from personal develop
ment. (See Joseph Katz and
Nevitt Sanford for doubts on
this score.)
These are not by any means
the sole characteristics of uni
versity organization and opera

tion which contribute to the
process of turning excited, hope
ful freshmen into pragmatic,
other-directed, what-good-is-this
academic-crud upperclassmen.
What might lead one to ex
tend the participation hypothe
sis beyond the confines of the
psych lab to the larger commun
ity?
Dare we think that cultural
dynamics are not restricted to
primitive societies but operate
in the very Quad itself? Do we
recognize that the operation of
the present academic process
functions more to alert the sub
jects of the operations to the
idiosyncratic cues of high status
people — instilling a life-goal of
meeting environmental tests of
personal worth rather than to
invoke and inspire a search for
truth and a life-goal of self-ex
tending creativity?
If we can see past the wishful
thoughts and the socially ap
proved nice-things-to-say, per
haps we can recognize that a call
to a new identity is a legitimate
and reasonable response to exist
ing conditions.
But to be successful, "there
must be commitment to the
change, and others must accord
it recognition and do all the
things needed to reinforce and
consolidate it so that a sense of
new identity can actually be at
tained (Ward Goodenough, 1963,
p. 291.)
DENNIS J SIMS
• A Dungeon ?
Editor, The Daily:
In response to Allan Christe
low's letter of May 20th, I be
lieve that Stanford is justified
in calling itself a university,

meaning that Stanford is at
least as much of a university as
Berkeley, Harvard, or Oxford.
Stanford may not measure up
to Mr. Christelows' "ideal"
standards, but then again, many
of us have different conceptions
of the ideal.
I do not feel that Stanford is
perfect, that Stanford should
be controlled Ry outside alumni
pressure, that students should
be made to conform to some
clean-cut image, or that ROTC
students should be coerced into
donating their blood. However,
simply because we have several
problems in the university, this
does not mean that Stanford is
leading American society "down
the road to infamy."
In previous years, Stanford
students have been active in civil
rights work, the Peace Corps,
the Ravenswood tutorial, num
erous work projects, Vista, and
assorted student political orga
nizations.
Mr. Christelow cannot fairly
argue that Stanford students are
apathetic and uncritical. Stu
dents do take an interest in the
"harsh reality of the outside
world," and they have made
honest attempts to improve it.
Some of the credit for motivat
ing student activity belongs to
Sanford University as it now
exists in its, admittedly, imper
fect form.
Stanford is not the stultify
ing dungeon that Mr. Christelow
describes, nor is it a factory for
the production of machine parts.
It has been used as a vantage
point from wihch students have
re-evaluated many aspects of
the "surrounding world."
Unfortunately, many students
often become frustrated, per
haps like Mr. Christelow, when
they realize that the really big
problem of our age—the possi
bility of world war and the wave
of revolution sweeping Africa,
Asia and South America — are
beyond student control and fre
quently beyond our still limited
understanding.

• Second-Rate School
Editor, The Daily:
Stanford University's 'leap to
greatness' would be better
termed 'stumbling mediocrity'.
The so-called 'Harvard of the
West' is guilty of the following
cardinal sins:
• Blatant religious discrimi
nation (for over seventy years):
for refusing (as recently as one
week ago) to let Jews hold ser
vices on campus other than in
a gaudy Christian church whose
symbology is offensive even to
many campus Christians.
• Obsequious kowtowing to
alumni criticism: for suspending
a Freshman athlete from the
track team because his hair was
too long and thus offended a
few well-heeled alumni.
• Giving academic credit for
soldier courses (ROTC), the aca
demic content of which has been
controversial at best.
• Having a sloppily cata
logued and even more sloppily
run main library. A first-class
library is the sine qua non of a
great university. There is no
question where that leaves Stan
ford.
Like some people, Stanford is
more concerned with its image
than with itself. Are not all of
these unmistakable signs of a
second-rate university?

•Arrive? Never!
Editor, The Dally:
The Freshman Daily (May 17)
was very interesting, but in
some ways disconcerting.
After reading about Wilbur,
Civ, the personal voice in En
glish and any number of other
editorials about how freshmen
look at things, two disturbing
comments stood out most in my
mind: first, that of the Roble
girl who said "I'd change no
thing . . . I'm crazy about every
aspect of this place," and even
more, the remarke from Art
Fisher's column entitled "Fresh
men: You Are Here—But When
Will You Arrive?" that "Kid,
you're just a little freshman and
you don't know what's happen
ing."
Despite the risk of sounding
like someone who is ready to
solve the world's problems at the
end of the freshman year, I
think that both these comments
miss one of the most vitally im
portant attitudes one can ever
hope to cultivate: that of con
sructive dissatisfaction.
No society, such as Stanford
University, is so good that every
aspect of it should remain un
changed; Mr. Fisher's article re
flects the same absence of con
structive dissatisfaction as the
freshman comment, but in a
much more serious way. I ques
tion whether the senior who
would say to a freshman or any
other student, silently or other
wise, that "Kid, you're just a
little freshman and don't know
what's happening'' doesn't have
a very good idea himself of the
changes he has undergone dur
ing his four years at Stanford.
"Freshmen: You Are Here—
But When Will You Arrive?" ex
horts Mr. Fisher. I don't want
to arrive, if that means that at
the end of my senior year, I'll
think that I realize all the im
plications of my college experi
ences. I'm glad to be a fresh
man, just as I'll be glad to be a
sophomore, junior, and senior.
Because for every mistake 1
make this year, there was some
thing learned about myself or
others that was so valuable that
I was glad to be wrong in the
learning, so long as I learned.
Mr. Fisher tells us freshmen
that when we are seniors, we
will have changed and when we
realize that, we "will have made
it." He says further that until
we have made this realization,
"It's all Frosh Week until then."
Does he mean that to imply that
when we are seniors, we will
know what it's all about?
I hope not, and I think not.
If my ideas are idealistic, they
do not ignore experience. If be
ing a freshman means a little
bungling through life and some
realizations of ignorance, I'm
glad to be a freshman. I'm hap
py to know that I still have a lot
to learn, and that I always will;
I'm happy to know that I'll
never arrive.

• Rewarding Seminar
Editor, The Daily:
Because the Freshman Semi
nar program (discussed in May
17's Freshman Edition of The
Daily) is made up of unique
groups of individuals studying
relatively unrelated topics, it is
practically impossible to make
general statements about the
program as a whole.
By taking part in one of these
groups ("Modern Ballads and
Their Backgrounds" with Profes
sor Claude Simpson), I enjoyed
a wide exchange of knowledge
injected with personal theories.
That is, I found a high level of
intra-group communication of
specialized educational value
which both illustrated back
ground research and opened wide
the gates for individual study.
I left the seminar with what
I feel is an enlightened curiosity,
a feeling of accomplishment and
potential, and a knowledge
which I have found both enjoy
able and practical. I consider
this participation in the Fresh
man Seminar program one of
my most rewarding experiences
at Stanford.

So you received ten letters
backing the position of Pat Mor
rison, who refused to co-operate
with his track coach when asked
to have his lovely locks trimmed.
Well, here is one letter which
does not back either Pat or you.
To a grown man—it appears
as perfectly silly that such ac
tions are so important. Pat
must conform to some common
standards. He wears pants,
doesn't he?
I have had more friends who
never attended Stanford kid me
about the situation. They get
lots of laughs out of you "kids."
We Stanford alumni really take
a beating because of the child
ish antics of a very few stu
dents.
This is written in the thought
you might appreciate knowing
how most of we old timers feel.
Please, don't follow Berkeley's
example!
ROY F. REINEMAN,
Covlna, Calif.
Editor, The Daily:
Stanford's first sit-in is now
history. If it is to be remem
bered at all, it will be remember
ed as a dismal failure; it could
not have been anything else.
Speaking as one who is sympa
thetic with the goals of the
"New Left" and the anti-Viet
nam war movements, I would
like to offer a few. thoughts as
to why the sit-in was doomed
from the start.
The technique of the sit-in
(at least in this generation) de
veloped out of the civil rights
movement in the South and has
been exported to other areas and
issues largely by those active
in the civil rights movement.
Yet the conditions under which
the technique succeeded in the
South were perhaps more im
portant to the success of the
movement than the sit-in tech
nique itself. It is this lesson
which the Stanford sit-in ig
nored.
• Non-violent civil disobedi
ence is an appeal to the public
conscience—not a method of co
ercing an individual.
• As an appeal to the public
conscience, it must carry such
moral justification as to over
come the democratic presump
tion against extra-legal meth
ods of protest.
• Moral justification and the
pragmatic concern for expedi
ency and utility cannot totally
be separated. These factors
which, under given circum
star e c will make the sit-in
~ble ? i compelling will
>r iQ Iso to -ake it morally
justiaJble—and vill make the
moral justification apparent to
the larger society.
a. Civil disobedience should
be used only when all other
existing remedies have been
exhausted; when every tradi
tional approach has been tried
and found wanting. Why did
the protesters' overwhelming
demand to have the Selective
Service test cancelled manifest
itself only days before the test
was scheduled? Would anyone
expect the faculty or adminis
tration to act on such short
notice when the tests had been
scheduled publicly for months?
Wasn't the impression con
veyed to the student body that
the demonstrators' moral re
vulsion to the test had ma
terialized overnight?
b. The goal of a sit-in must
be capable of precise and con
sistent articulation. Such was
the goal of the Southern civil
rights demonstrations. They
were demanding the right to
be free from specific forms of
racial discrimination — rights
guaranteed to them by the
Federal Constitution. What
was the goal of the Stanford
sit-in? Was it the complicity
of the University in the Selec
tive Service System? Such
complicity is wrong only if the
Selective Service System is
wrong. Was the System wrong
because it discriminated in fav
or of upper middle-class col
lege students? If so, were the
demonstrators calling for uni
versal military training, aboli
tion of conscription, or some
intermediate course? Did they
oppose the test simply on the
grounds that it aided the im
moral war in Vietnam? If the
war itself is immoral, can one
be criticized for preferring a
student exemption to the risk
of being sent to kill those who
we have no right to kij'?
The sit-in was a failure be
cause it was conducted without
regard to the essential nature
and function of civil disobedi
ence.

• Unfortunate
Approach
Editor, The Daily:
The demonstrators picketing
President Sterling's office pro
testing the use of Stanford as a
Selective Service Examination
Center are using this contro
versy to register their opposition
to the Draft in general and to
United States policy in the Viet
nam war. It is unfortunate that
this partcular even should have
been chosen as the vehicle of
protest, for it has resulted in a
conflict of the principles of the
demonstrators themselves and
has offended rather than merely
awakened a large number of
the Stanford men who consider
it a great convenience to be able
to take the examination on cam
pus.
Many of these demonstrators
are among those who are de
manding the right to be able to
obtain contraceptives from the
University Health Service, vet
these same students would deny
others the right to take the
Draft test on campus, if they so
desire. These particular protest
ers are demanding one right
while denying another. The con
traceptive question may not be
totally analagous to the Draft
test controversy, but neverthe
less, these demonstrators should
maintain some degree of consis
tency in their beliefs and actions
if they wish to avoid being la
beled hypocrites.

I would strongly urge these
protesting students, if they sin
cerely desire greater acceptance
of their ideas and values, to dis
continue this particular type of
demonstration which can only
do harm to the concepts they
stand for in the long run.

• Wrongly Directed
Editor, The Daily:
Thursday night during dinner,
mimeographed sheets were dis
tributed in the Wilbur dining
rooms, requesting support for a
vigil in President Sterling's of
fice. The expressed purpose of
this vigil was to "demand our
rights ... to enjoin the Univer
sity from cooperating with and
endorsing a rotten (sic) system
by giving the next deferment
test." We do not object to these
students expressing their views.
We do, however, feel that they
are protesting in the wrong
place and to the wrong person.
The draft test was given on a
voluntary basis. In making avail
able classroom space, we feel
that President Sterling was
merely cooperating with student
desire for a convenient place to
take the test. In doing this, nei
ther he nor the University was
"giving" nor necessarily "en
dorsing" these exams, as was
maintained by those sponsoring
the vigil. The test was given by
the Selective Service, to only
those students who, having con
sidered all alternatives, chose to
take it. If everyone has the right
to decide for himself whether to
take the test, those who do want
to should certainly be able to
take it at a convenient location.
Legitimate protest of the draft
policy should be directed to those
directly responsible—to the Se
lective Service—and not to the
President of the University.

• Praising Wert
Editor, The Daily:
A large number of students
counter-demonstrating in front
of President Sterling's office
were very favorably impressed
with Dean Wert's statement to
the sit-in protesters. The state
men made it abundantly clear
that President Sterling was will
ing to meet with five or six stu
dents in a private discussion;
privacy and the absence of news
media is a prerequisite for any
meaningful and intelligent dia
logue.
The protesters were given am
ple time to present their posi
tion through normal channels
(such as the Committee of Fif
teen) during the several months
since the draft exam at Stanford
was announced, but instead they
delayed action until one exam
had already been given.
The continuation of the sit-in
after Dean Wert's statement was
made served no purpose other
than obstructing normal activity
in the President's office, since
the draft exam would not be can
celled in spite of the demonstra
tors' effort to deny the right to
take the exam from those who
wished to take it.
The diciplinary action the pro
testers will receive has definite
ly been earned, and prompt ac
tion should be taken by the stu

• Activists Not Listening
Editor, The Daily:
I spoke to a youth who was
handing out mimeographed ma
terial on The Sit-in at the White
Memorial Plaza at noon on Mon
day, May 23. I asked him why he
was dressed in such an unkempt
way. He said that he liked it
that way. I replied that it was
offensive to me and I pointed
out to him that his feet were
very dirty. He answered that
that was because he was bare
foot. I suggested that he must
be quite young to be so careless
of his appearance and he admit
ted that he was very young. I
realize now that I should have
admonished this child to go
home to his mother.
In his editorial in The Stan
ford Daily of May 24, Mr. Roise
predicts a rise in student activ

ism at Stanford in 1966. Some of
us have been around the cam
pus for a long time. In fact we
have devoted most our lives to
Stanford students. Never under
estimate the power of a woman!
This is one woman, and there
are many faculty wives like me,
who will be active if necessary
next Fall. We will not permit a
small group of idealistic, but re
bellious and misguided adoles
cent beatniks led by graduate
Teaching Assistants, who state
that "actions of the faculty seem
to them to be an appalling in
dication of moral bankruptcy
and intellectual cowardice" to
wreck our university. If anyone
is guilty of not listening it is
the student activist. Perhaps the
dirt in his ears prevents him
from hearing.
My husband is not morally
bankrupt or an intellectual cow

• Teaching The Faculty
Editor, The Daily:
Now that the sit-in is over and
we can try to assess the respon
sibility for the breakdown in
communications that led to it, let
us not forget to include the re
sponsibility of the faculty. The
fact is that the students did
not act until the faculty had re
fused to act.
It has been said that the fac
ulty could not have considered
the problem of the draft at their
meeting last Tuesday because
they had spent so much time on
classified contracts. That is un
doubtedly true. But why did they
have to wait until last Tuesday
to consider the matter?
Professors at Brandeis raised
the issue more than two months
ago. And why did they have to
wait until last Tuesday to con
sider classified contracts? That
issue was raised last December
by the GCC Newsletter. Have the
faculty stopped reading the
newspapers?
In this situation the students
were very careful not to violate
faculty prerogatives. But it
seems that the faculty will not
consider issues until students
have violated those prerogatives.
Why should students have to
tell their teachers that they are
tacitly condoning a possible vio
lation of academic freedom?
Why should students have to
tell their teachers that they are
condoning the participation of
the University in what may be
an immoral system? But it
seems that students do have to
tell their teachers, and it seems
that they have to do it violently.
Maybe the faculty have learned
as much from this incident as
the rest of us hope to have
learned. But if not, I am afraid
that we can expect more sit-ins.
And maybe next time they will
be in the offices of the Executive
Committee of the Academic
Council.

• Showing Their Colors
Editor, Th<> Daily:
There is a final chapter to the
story of the draft protest, which
didn't make monday's Daily:
After the demonstrators had
left the President's office, and
had walked to his home to dis
cover that he was away for the
weekend, they returned to cam
pus by the quickest route, frater
nity row. Boys on the lawn of the
ATO house shouted "It would

take three of you chickenshits
to make one of us!" and other
things they thought appropriate
to the occasion.
Boys at the Beta Theta Pi and
Phi Gamma Delta houses follow
ed suit, with the more inventive
Betas running up to their bal
cony to bombard the tired pro
testers with water balloons.
This self-comment says more
about the fraternity "system"
than any outsider ever could.

• Decision-Making
Editor, The Daily:
The recent sit-in in the office
of President Sterling served to
dramatize an issue of fundamen
tal and long-standing importance
to everyone at Stanford Univer
sity. Can Stanford University
become the community of schol
ars which it claims to be?
The events of the past week-

end have shown that we are far
from attaining this goal. The
lack of willingness to communi
cate on the part of the adminis
tration has never been as clear
ly evident than in the unilateral
decision to hold a draft test on
campus which raises serious
questions for all at the Univer
sity.
It has also been evident with
regard to the issues of social
regs, liquor and religion on
which the administration
evinced little or no desire to act
until the application of power
on the part of some other group
was imminent.
It is true that the committee
of fifteen, the revival of LASSU
as a meaningful decision-making
body, and student participation
on certain committees has im
proved the situation somewhat
in the past few years.
However the total unwilling
ness of the administration to
consult students and revise on
the question of the di'aft test
before and after the sit-in indi
cates that the basic problem
hasn't been solved.
The desire of the administra
tion to substitute power for dis
cussion in this instance raises
further questions — the stu
dents who sat in tried are about
to be tried for violation of the
fundamental standard.
In a genuine community, the
basic standard of conduct should
be applicable to all within it,
not just one segment of its pop
ulation. It is without a doubt
that the intransigence evidenced
by President Sterling hurt the
Stanford community at least as
much as the action taken and
persisted in by the students as a
result.
Who, however, is going to try
him for violation of a fundamen
tal standard?
If Stanford is ever to become
a community in any meaningful
sense, communication, rather
than power struggle must play
the major role in University de
cision-making.
In addition, any basic stand
ard of conduct which is adopted
should be made applicable to all.

• Art Of Persuasion
Editor, The
It seems to me that much of
the enlightened campus dialogue
regarding this country's involve

ment in Viet Nam is failing in
its intended goal of awakening
anti-war sentiment. One of the
most obvious and most easily
corrected reasons for the unper
suasiveness of this dialogue is
the stereotype "beatnik" image
which many of the activists
convey to the uninitiated pub
lic.
The long hair and sandals and
beards of many articulate stu
dents cannot help but subtract
from the overall appeal of their
arguments to an audience which
is generally unaccustomed to
looking beyond surface appear
ance. Moreover, the national
audience welcomes the oppor
tunity to stereotype the student
activist as "just another beard
ed mal content, probably a Com
munist, and maybe a homosex
ual." Stereotyping, though some
times helpful, in this case mere
ly relieves the public of the bur
densome task of critical evalua
tion, when critical evaluation is
just what the activists want to

promote.
The tendency to stereotype,
prevalent among the uneducated
and among some politicians, is
sad—even tragic. But, it is com
mon. To provide the undecided
citizen with such an effortless
escape from a confrontation
with the issue neither does jus
tice to the war, to the citizen,
nor to the Student Left.
Of course, most students feel
that personal freedom is the
basis of their protest. That in
cludes the freedom to dress ac
cording to individual choice.
Freedom seems to me to rank
second only to happiness in the
hierarchy of human values. To
voluntarily give up any freedom
is an act with grave political
and philosophical implications
and should by no means be done
lightly. However, a few people
are dedicated not only to living
in the world, but to making the
world a better place in which to
live. For these few the casual
exercise of every freedom may
be costly in terms of accom
plishment.
To understand that I am not
advocating conformity, the issue
of personal freedom must be
put into perspective. Now, if
sprinter Pat Morrison wants to
let his hair grow to an unusual
length, that's his business. He
isn't trying to convince anyone
to think, or by implication, to do
as he does. His hair is only his
business.
But, the political activists are
engaged in the art of persua
sion, and they are foolish if
they believe that their appeal
goes out to a purely logical pub
lic. The SCPV, it is true, is not
trying to set fashions in hair
style any more than Morrison,
but only the naive orator fails
to see the irrational association
between the content of speech
and the appearance of speaker.
The successful orator capitalizes
upon this fact.
To those who at this point re
mind me that the student move
ment is also a protest against
ignorance and irrationality, not
a concession to it, I ask that
they refer that reminder to the
student leaders, who conceive
their own role and the role of
the university as one of leader
ship. How can there be leader
ship without a following?
It is an imperfect world where
certain personal freedoms, like
the freedom to express oneself
through the choice of clothes or

hair style, must be inhibited in
order to further some other
freedoms, like the freedom to
compete equally for public senti
ment alongside the models of
middleclass values. Those lead
ers who recognize the necessity
of coming out of the philosophi
cal ivory tower to establish con
tact with a non-philosophical
world should see this compro
mise as the least of many evils.
Some, obviously, refuse to
make that compromise. It seems
to me that their unwillingness
to compromise sheds some light
on the sincerity of their com
mitment to the goal of peace in
Viet Nam.
RON GARRISON
• Conflicting Demands
Editor, The Daily:
A basic contradiction emerges
in two of the recent protest
movements here at Stanford.
The SSRF wishes the univer
sity to supply contraceptives to
anyone who wants them with
the idea that each student would
then be able to make his (her)
own moral decision. That's fine.
But now the most recent
group proposes exactly the op
posite: that the individual stu
dent should not be allowed by
his individual choice (whether
moral or otherwise) to take the
selective service draft test on
university proper. This same
group indicts the faculty as a
unit for not supporting students
in a (now) redefined cause of
student particiaption in decision
making. This is truly an inter
esting case, since the decision
to hold a draft test was hardly
made at Building 10.
More student involvement in
decision making is certainly
needed at Stanford, but the re
cent draft test is a pretty weak
issue to identify it wih.
PHIL ARNOLD
• October Days
Editor, The Daily:
In trying to see the current
student unrest - administration
intransigence difficulties from a
point of view somewhere be
yond the heat of the conflict,
I am struck by one overriding
concern: What methods are ap
propriate to the solution of prob
lems that arise within a com
munity of scholars and their
students?
It seems to me that the most
appropriate methods would be
those which are the hallmark of
any thinking community: reas
on, definition, articulation, and
dialogue. This must be the case
so long as all protagonists are
concerned with preserving the
"community."
The present situation at Stan
ford, from this point of view, is
pretty dismal. The student lead
ers prefer to posit these delicate
issues concerning government
university, war-university, draft
university in the streets. The ad
ministration prefers to ignore
the problem, to be consistently
absent.
As the scene becomes increas
ingly dichotomized, as the pro
tagonists at either extreme ac
celerate the process of detach
ment from one another, cutting
lines of rational communication,
throwing up impenetrable walls
of opaque verbiage of absolutely
no use if dialogue is really de
sider between the extremes, the
possibility of clearly raising and
effectively solving these prob
lems becomes impossible.
Rather than a community of
scholars and students, this scene
is more reminiscent of Petro
grad in the spring of 3917. So
far, the problem, clumsily de
fined even in the pamphlets and
fly-leaves of those who have
raised it, has been articulated
in the manner of peasant muni
tion workers, through slogans at
best, through shouting rallies in
the streets at worst.
And the problem has been
met by an administration unwill
ing to admit the gravity of the
situation, as yet unable to think
out the problem or to take ag
gressively positive measures to
assess the nature of the student
demands and to land on a pro
gram of action which will insure
that the university will not
have to depend on the delicacy
of crowds in White Plaza to
solve these involved and intri
cate issues.
The problem with the bread
riots in Petrograd in 1917 is not
that they were an ineffective
expression of workers' and peas
ants' extreme discontent, but
that they were able to express
only this negative sentiment in
the absence of other viable
channels of communication. And
the problem with the Russian
Provisional Government in 1917
is not that it was a bad govern
ment, but that it was no gov
ernment at all. What can we ex
pect from next October?

• 'If Its Pressed
Editor, The Daily:
Hooray for the emerging Stan
ford. Down with ambivalent dou
ble-standards, bumbling bureau
cracy, and the multiversity-in
dustrial-military behemoth. Since

the election of "artistic social
ist" Dave Harris, Stanford has
made radical progress in identi
fying and confronting the real
issues. First, that bastion of in
trigue, the Electrical Engineer
ing Department, was identified
as a cover, albeit in the open,
for the monstrous CIA. Tlien
came the revelation of the blood
thirsty anti-intelectuallism of
the ROTC. This week, finally,
we're getting to the basic issue,
elimination of the "parentis
pocis" routine with the need
made obvious by the Athletic De
partment. It should be readily
apparent that the length of one's
hair is a private matter and
doesn't even require the "mu
tual consent" of the SSRF.
Furthermore, this leads im
mediately to a more basic issue,
the rights of the Stanford Dollie.
The restrictions on "Quad
clothes," actual and imagined,
must be eliminated. What right
has the University to impose its
ideas of contemporary dress
when such regulations obviously
contribute nothing to intellectual
attainment. Each person should
be free, at least in a university,
to be comfortable, to experi
ment, and to investigate various
modes of thought and apparel.
To the comment that the dis
traction of the Stanford males
by bikini-clad or even topless
damsels would be destructive to
their intellectual endeavors, I
say that this is merely a chal
lenge to the teachers. If their
teaching is stimulating enough,
who need watch the girls. After
all, we're here for an education,
not an eyeful.
Besides, think of the health
benefits. What could be more
American than taking in a little
sun on the way to class. Why
the reduction of auto accidents
involving students rushing back
from northern beaches and bars
alone should make everyone
wish the immediate elimination
of this childish regulation!
In keeping with the campaign
a number of slogans have been
suggested. "If It's Pressed, Don't
Wear It." "Be Comfortable,
Stimulate a Professor." And of
course, you can make up your
own.
I urge one and all to take up
this issue because at the rate
we're going there won't be many
worthy issues left.

• Bad Influence
Editor, The Daily:
I agree with Terry Inch, class
of '61, (The Daily, May 23) that
it's highly unfortunate that only
40 percent of the student body
voted in the last election. How
ever, I feel sure that even if 100
percent had voted, Dave Harris
still would have won by a fair
margin.
To find the true reasons for
Dave's victory you will have to
look a little deeper than at just
the size of the electorate. You
will have to look at the forces
which led Stanford students to
vote for a rebel.
As a freshman I know that
one of the strongest influences
on my classmates is that of the
Wilbur Sponsors. I realize gen
eralizations are not always fair,
but the majority of the sponsors
I've met are radical, whether
outspoken like Dave or not.
What's more, because of admin
istration concessions, the Wil
bur Sponsors have remained a
self-perpetuating group; thus,
they will continue to impress
their radical ideas on freshmen.
This leads to the real ques
tion, who influences the spon
sors? More generally, who in
fluences Stanford students? Ob
viously the faculty, and many,
many members of the faculty
are radical. Again, I have to
speak from experience.
At the beginning of second
quarter, my mathematics class
was dismissed by Mr. Kowalski
because he refused to teach in
the ROTC building. Last Friday
I saw my first quarter English
TA, Mr. Addams, sitting on
President Sterling's window sill,
encouraging the anti-draft dem
onstrators,
Certainly these two examples
are extreme, but they suggest
what is often a more subtle radi
calism imposed on students by a
large section of the faculty. In
fact, I'm sure that many of the
"free thinkers" who voted for
Dave were merely reflecting
their instructors' ideas.
As an afterthought, contrary
to the recent article in Western
Politica, some intellectuals are
not liberal. If you want to see
a different kind of professor
molding (is there a better
word?) Stanford students, Mr.
Inch, it is your right and your
duty as a donating alumnus to
demand a change on The Farm,

et. al. be viewed as an attempted


"First, Premier Ky, you must learn the principles of democracy ..
Editor, The Daily:
Stanford's first sit-in is now
history. If it is to be remem
bered at all, it will be remember
ed as a dismal failure; it could
not have been anything else.
Speaking as one who is sympa
thetic with the goals of the
"New Left" and the anti-Viet
nam war movements, I would
like to offer a few. thoughts as
to why the sit-in was doomed
from the start.
The technique of the sit-in
(at least in this generation) de
veloped out of the civil rights
movement in the South and has
been exported to other areas and
issues largely by those active
in the civil rights movement.
Yet the conditions under which
the technique succeeded in the
South were perhaps more im
portant to the success of the
movement than the sit-in tech
nique itself. It is this lesson
which the Stanford sit-in ig
nored.
• Non-violent civil disobedi
ence is an appeal to the public
conscience—not a method of co
ercing an individual.
• As an appeal to the public
conscience, it must carry such
moral justification as to over
come the democratic presump
tion against extra-legal meth
ods of protest.
• Moral justification and the
pragmatic concern for expedi
ency and utility cannot totally
be separated. These factors
which, under given circum
star e c will make the sit-in
~ble ? i compelling will
>r iQ Iso to -ake it morally
justiaJble—and vill make the
moral justification apparent to
the larger society.
a. Civil disobedience should
be used only when all other
existing remedies have been
exhausted; when every tradi
tional approach has been tried
and found wanting. Why did
the protesters' overwhelming
demand to have the Selective
Service test cancelled manifest
itself only days before the test
was scheduled? Would anyone
expect the faculty or adminis
tration to act on such short
notice when the tests had been
scheduled publicly for months?
Wasn't the impression con
veyed to the student body that
the demonstrators' moral re
vulsion to the test had ma
terialized overnight?
b. The goal of a sit-in must
be capable of precise and con
sistent articulation. Such was
the goal of the Southern civil
rights demonstrations. They
were demanding the right to
be free from specific forms of
racial discrimination — rights
guaranteed to them by the
Federal Constitution. What
was the goal of the Stanford
sit-in? Was it the complicity
of the University in the Selec
tive Service System? Such
complicity is wrong only if the
Selective Service System is
wrong. Was the System wrong
because it discriminated in fav
or of upper middle-class col
lege students? If so, were the
demonstrators calling for uni
versal military training, aboli
tion of conscription, or some
intermediate course? Did they
oppose the test simply on the
grounds that it aided the im
moral war in Vietnam? If the
war itself is immoral, can one
be criticized for preferring a
student exemption to the risk
of being sent to kill those who
we have no right to kij'?
The sit-in was a failure be
cause it was conducted without
regard to the essential nature
and function of civil disobedi
ence.

• Unfortunate
Approach
Editor, The Daily:
The demonstrators picketing
President Sterling's office pro
testing the use of Stanford as a
Selective Service Examination
Center are using this contro
versy to register their opposition
to the Draft in general and to
United States policy in the Viet
nam war. It is unfortunate that
this partcular even should have
been chosen as the vehicle of
protest, for it has resulted in a
conflict of the principles of the
demonstrators themselves and
has offended rather than merely
awakened a large number of
the Stanford men who consider
it a great convenience to be able
to take the examination on cam
pus.
Many of these demonstrators
are among those who are de
manding the right to be able to
obtain contraceptives from the
University Health Service, vet
these same students would deny
others the right to take the
Draft test on campus, if they so
desire. These particular protest
ers are demanding one right
while denying another. The con
traceptive question may not be
totally analagous to the Draft
test controversy, but neverthe
less, these demonstrators should
maintain some degree of consis
tency in their beliefs and actions
if they wish to avoid being la
beled hypocrites.

I would strongly urge these
protesting students, if they sin
cerely desire greater acceptance
of their ideas and values, to dis
continue this particular type of
demonstration which can only
do harm to the concepts they
stand for in the long run.

• Wrongly Directed
Editor, The Daily:
Thursday night during dinner,
mimeographed sheets were dis
tributed in the Wilbur dining
rooms, requesting support for a
vigil in President Sterling's of
fice. The expressed purpose of
this vigil was to "demand our
rights ... to enjoin the Univer
sity from cooperating with and
endorsing a rotten (sic) system
by giving the next deferment
test." We do not object to these
students expressing their views.
We do, however, feel that they
are protesting in the wrong
place and to the wrong person.
The draft test was given on a
voluntary basis. In making avail
able classroom space, we feel
that President Sterling was
merely cooperating with student
desire for a convenient place to
take the test. In doing this, nei
ther he nor the University was
"giving" nor necessarily "en
dorsing" these exams, as was
maintained by those sponsoring
the vigil. The test was given by
the Selective Service, to only
those students who, having con
sidered all alternatives, chose to
take it. If everyone has the right
to decide for himself whether to
take the test, those who do want
to should certainly be able to
take it at a convenient location.
Legitimate protest of the draft
policy should be directed to those
directly responsible—to the Se
lective Service—and not to the
President of the University.

• Praising Wert
Editor, The Daily:
A large number of students
counter-demonstrating in front
of President Sterling's office
were very favorably impressed
with Dean Wert's statement to
the sit-in protesters. The state
men made it abundantly clear
that President Sterling was will
ing to meet with five or six stu
dents in a private discussion;
privacy and the absence of news
media is a prerequisite for any
meaningful and intelligent dia
logue.
The protesters were given am
ple time to present their posi
tion through normal channels
(such as the Committee of Fif
teen) during the several months
since the draft exam at Stanford
was announced, but instead they
delayed action until one exam
had already been given.
The continuation of the sit-in
after Dean Wert's statement was
made served no purpose other
than obstructing normal activity
in the President's office, since
the draft exam would not be can
celled in spite of the demonstra
tors' effort to deny the right to
take the exam from those who
wished to take it.
The diciplinary action the pro
testers will receive has definite
ly been earned, and prompt ac
tion should be taken by the stu

that was because he was bare

• Teaching The Faculty
Editor, The Daily:
Now that the sit-in is over and
we can try to assess the respon
sibility for the breakdown in
communications that led to it, let
us not forget to include the re
sponsibility of the faculty. The
fact is that the students did
not act until the faculty had re
fused to act.
It has been said that the fac
ulty could not have considered
the problem of the draft at their
meeting last Tuesday because
they had spent so much time on
classified contracts. That is un
doubtedly true. But why did they
have to wait until last Tuesday
to consider the matter?
Professors at Brandeis raised
the issue more than two months
ago. And why did they have to
wait until last Tuesday to con
sider classified contracts? That
issue was raised last December
by the GCC Newsletter. Have the
faculty stopped reading the
newspapers?
In this situation the students
were very careful not to violate
faculty prerogatives. But it
seems that the faculty will not
consider issues until students
have violated those prerogatives.
Why should students have to
tell their teachers that they are
tacitly condoning a possible vio
lation of academic freedom?
Why should students have to
tell their teachers that they are
condoning the participation of
the University in what may be
an immoral system? But it
seems that students do have to
tell their teachers, and it seems
that they have to do it violently.
Maybe the faculty have learned
as much from this incident as
the rest of us hope to have
learned. But if not, I am afraid
that we can expect more sit-ins.
And maybe next time they will
be in the offices of the Executive
Committee of the Academic
Council.

• Showing Their Colors
Editor, Th<> Daily:
There is a final chapter to the
story of the draft protest, which
didn't make monday's Daily:
After the demonstrators had
left the President's office, and
had walked to his home to dis
cover that he was away for the
weekend, they returned to cam
pus by the quickest route, frater
nity row. Boys on the lawn of the
ATO house shouted "It would

take three of you chickenshits
to make one of us!" and other
things they thought appropriate
to the occasion.
Boys at the Beta Theta Pi and
Phi Gamma Delta houses follow
ed suit, with the more inventive
Betas running up to their bal
cony to bombard the tired pro
testers with water balloons.
This self-comment says more
about the fraternity "system"
than any outsider ever could.

• Decision-Making
Editor, The Daily:
The recent sit-in in the office
of President Sterling served to
dramatize an issue of fundamen
tal and long-standing importance
to everyone at Stanford Univer
sity. Can Stanford University
become the community of schol
ars which it claims to be?
The events of the past week-

end have shown that we are far
from attaining this goal. The
lack of willingness to communi
cate on the part of the adminis
tration has never been as clear
ly evident than in the unilateral
decision to hold a draft test on
campus which raises serious
questions for all at the Univer
sity.
It has also been evident with
regard to the issues of social
regs, liquor and religion on
which the administration
evinced little or no desire to act
until the application of power
on the part of some other group
was imminent.
It is true that the committee
of fifteen, the revival of LASSU
as a meaningful decision-making
body, and student participation
on certain committees has im
proved the situation somewhat
in the past few years.
However the total unwilling
ness of the administration to
consult students and revise on
the question of the di'aft test
before and after the sit-in indi
cates that the basic problem
hasn't been solved.
The desire of the administra
tion to substitute power for dis
cussion in this instance raises
further questions — the stu
dents who sat in tried are about
to be tried for violation of the
fundamental standard.
In a genuine community, the
basic standard of conduct should
be applicable to all within it,
not just one segment of its pop
ulation. It is without a doubt
that the intransigence evidenced
by President Sterling hurt the
Stanford community at least as
much as the action taken and
persisted in by the students as a
result.
Who, however, is going to try
him for violation of a fundamen
tal standard?
If Stanford is ever to become
a community in any meaningful
sense, communication, rather
than power struggle must play
the major role in University de
cision-making.
In addition, any basic stand
ard of conduct which is adopted
should be made applicable to all.

• Art Of Persuasion
Editor, The
It seems to me that much of
the enlightened campus dialogue
regarding this country's involve

ment in Viet Nam is failing in
its intended goal of awakening
anti-war sentiment. One of the
most obvious and most easily
corrected reasons for the unper
suasiveness of this dialogue is
the stereotype "beatnik" image
which many of the activists
convey to the uninitiated pub
lic.
The long hair and sandals and
beards of many articulate stu
dents cannot help but subtract
from the overall appeal of their
arguments to an audience which
is generally unaccustomed to
looking beyond surface appear
ance. Moreover, the national
audience welcomes the oppor
tunity to stereotype the student
activist as "just another beard
ed mal content, probably a Com
munist, and maybe a homosex
ual." Stereotyping, though some
times helpful, in this case mere
ly relieves the public of the bur
densome task of critical evalua
tion, when critical evaluation is
just what the activists want to

promote.
The tendency to stereotype,
prevalent among the uneducated
and among some politicians, is
sad—even tragic. But, it is com
mon. To provide the undecided
citizen with such an effortless
escape from a confrontation
with the issue neither does jus
tice to the war, to the citizen,
nor to the Student Left.
Of course, most students feel
that personal freedom is the
basis of their protest. That in
cludes the freedom to dress ac
cording to individual choice.
Freedom seems to me to rank
second only to happiness in the
hierarchy of human values. To
voluntarily give up any freedom
is an act with grave political
and philosophical implications
and should by no means be done
lightly. However, a few people
are dedicated not only to living
in the world, but to making the
world a better place in which to
live. For these few the casual
exercise of every freedom may
be costly in terms of accom
plishment.
To understand that I am not
advocating conformity, the issue
of personal freedom must be
put into perspective. Now, if
sprinter Pat Morrison wants to
let his hair grow to an unusual
length, that's his business. He
isn't trying to convince anyone
to think, or by implication, to do
as he does. His hair is only his
business.
But, the political activists are
engaged in the art of persua
sion, and they are foolish if
they believe that their appeal
goes out to a purely logical pub
lic. The SCPV, it is true, is not
trying to set fashions in hair
style any more than Morrison,
but only the naive orator fails
to see the irrational association
between the content of speech
and the appearance of speaker.
The successful orator capitalizes
upon this fact.
To those who at this point re
mind me that the student move
ment is also a protest against
ignorance and irrationality, not
a concession to it, I ask that
they refer that reminder to the
student leaders, who conceive
their own role and the role of
the university as one of leader
ship. How can there be leader
ship without a following?
It is an imperfect world where
certain personal freedoms, like
the freedom to express oneself
through the choice of clothes or

hair style, must be inhibited in
order to further some other
freedoms, like the freedom to
compete equally for public senti
ment alongside the models of
middleclass values. Those lead
ers who recognize the necessity
of coming out of the philosophi
cal ivory tower to establish con
tact with a non-philosophical
world should see this compro
mise as the least of many evils.
Some, obviously, refuse to
make that compromise. It seems
to me that their unwillingness
to compromise sheds some light
on the sincerity of their com
mitment to the goal of peace in
Viet Nam.
RON GARRISON
• Conflicting Demands
Editor, The Daily:
A basic contradiction emerges
in two of the recent protest
movements here at Stanford.
The SSRF wishes the univer
sity to supply contraceptives to
anyone who wants them with
the idea that each student would
then be able to make his (her)
own moral decision. That's fine.
But now the most recent
group proposes exactly the op
posite: that the individual stu
dent should not be allowed by
his individual choice (whether
moral or otherwise) to take the
selective service draft test on
university proper. This same
group indicts the faculty as a
unit for not supporting students
in a (now) redefined cause of
student particiaption in decision
making. This is truly an inter
esting case, since the decision
to hold a draft test was hardly
made at Building 10.
More student involvement in
decision making is certainly
needed at Stanford, but the re
cent draft test is a pretty weak
issue to identify it wih.
PHIL ARNOLD
• October Days
Editor, The Daily:
In trying to see the current
student unrest - administration
intransigence difficulties from a
point of view somewhere be
yond the heat of the conflict,
I am struck by one overriding
concern: What methods are ap
propriate to the solution of prob
lems that arise within a com
munity of scholars and their
students?
It seems to me that the most
appropriate methods would be
those which are the hallmark of
any thinking community: reas
on, definition, articulation, and
dialogue. This must be the case
so long as all protagonists are
concerned with preserving the
"community."
The present situation at Stan
ford, from this point of view, is
pretty dismal. The student lead
ers prefer to posit these delicate
issues concerning government
university, war-university, draft
university in the streets. The ad
ministration prefers to ignore
the problem, to be consistently
absent.
As the scene becomes increas
ingly dichotomized, as the pro
tagonists at either extreme ac
celerate the process of detach
ment from one another, cutting
lines of rational communication,
throwing up impenetrable walls
of opaque verbiage of absolutely
no use if dialogue is really de
sider between the extremes, the
possibility of clearly raising and
effectively solving these prob
lems becomes impossible.
Rather than a community of
scholars and students, this scene
is more reminiscent of Petro
grad in the spring of 3917. So
far, the problem, clumsily de
fined even in the pamphlets and
fly-leaves of those who have
raised it, has been articulated
in the manner of peasant muni
tion workers, through slogans at
best, through shouting rallies in
the streets at worst.
And the problem has been
met by an administration unwill
ing to admit the gravity of the
situation, as yet unable to think
out the problem or to take ag
gressively positive measures to
assess the nature of the student
demands and to land on a pro
gram of action which will insure
that the university will not
have to depend on the delicacy
of crowds in White Plaza to
solve these involved and intri
cate issues.
The problem with the bread
riots in Petrograd in 1917 is not
that they were an ineffective
expression of workers' and peas
ants' extreme discontent, but
that they were able to express
only this negative sentiment in
the absence of other viable
channels of communication. And
the problem with the Russian
Provisional Government in 1917
is not that it was a bad govern
ment, but that it was no gov
ernment at all. What can we ex
pect from next October?

• 'If Its Pressed
Editor, The Daily:
Hooray for the emerging Stan
ford. Down with ambivalent dou
ble-standards, bumbling bureau
cracy, and the multiversity-in
dustrial-military behemoth. Since

the election of "artistic social
ist" Dave Harris, Stanford has
made radical progress in identi
fying and confronting the real
issues. First, that bastion of in
trigue, the Electrical Engineer
ing Department, was identified
as a cover, albeit in the open,
for the monstrous CIA. Tlien
came the revelation of the blood
thirsty anti-intelectuallism of
the ROTC. This week, finally,
we're getting to the basic issue,
elimination of the "parentis
pocis" routine with the need
made obvious by the Athletic De
partment. It should be readily
apparent that the length of one's
hair is a private matter and
doesn't even require the "mu
tual consent" of the SSRF.
Furthermore, this leads im
mediately to a more basic issue,
the rights of the Stanford Dollie.
The restrictions on "Quad
clothes," actual and imagined,
must be eliminated. What right
has the University to impose its
ideas of contemporary dress
when such regulations obviously
contribute nothing to intellectual
attainment. Each person should
be free, at least in a university,
to be comfortable, to experi
ment, and to investigate various
modes of thought and apparel.
To the comment that the dis
traction of the Stanford males
by bikini-clad or even topless
damsels would be destructive to
their intellectual endeavors, I
say that this is merely a chal
lenge to the teachers. If their
teaching is stimulating enough,
who need watch the girls. After
all, we're here for an education,
not an eyeful.
Besides, think of the health
benefits. What could be more
American than taking in a little
sun on the way to class. Why
the reduction of auto accidents
involving students rushing back
from northern beaches and bars
alone should make everyone
wish the immediate elimination
of this childish regulation!
In keeping with the campaign
a number of slogans have been
suggested. "If It's Pressed, Don't
Wear It." "Be Comfortable,
Stimulate a Professor." And of
course, you can make up your
own.
I urge one and all to take up
this issue because at the rate
we're going there won't be many
worthy issues left.

• Bad Influence
Editor, The Daily:
I agree with Terry Inch, class
of '61, (The Daily, May 23) that
it's highly unfortunate that only
40 percent of the student body
voted in the last election. How
ever, I feel sure that even if 100
percent had voted, Dave Harris
still would have won by a fair
margin.
To find the true reasons for
Dave's victory you will have to
look a little deeper than at just
the size of the electorate. You
will have to look at the forces
which led Stanford students to
vote for a rebel.
As a freshman I know that
one of the strongest influences
on my classmates is that of the
Wilbur Sponsors. I realize gen
eralizations are not always fair,
but the majority of the sponsors
I've met are radical, whether
outspoken like Dave or not.
What's more, because of admin
istration concessions, the Wil
bur Sponsors have remained a
self-perpetuating group; thus,
they will continue to impress
their radical ideas on freshmen.
This leads to the real ques
tion, who influences the spon
sors? More generally, who in
fluences Stanford students? Ob
viously the faculty, and many,
many members of the faculty
are radical. Again, I have to
speak from experience.
At the beginning of second
quarter, my mathematics class
was dismissed by Mr. Kowalski
because he refused to teach in
the ROTC building. Last Friday
I saw my first quarter English
TA, Mr. Addams, sitting on
President Sterling's window sill,
encouraging the anti-draft dem
onstrators,
Certainly these two examples
are extreme, but they suggest
what is often a more subtle radi
calism imposed on students by a
large section of the faculty. In
fact, I'm sure that many of the
"free thinkers" who voted for
Dave were merely reflecting
their instructors' ideas.
As an afterthought, contrary
to the recent article in Western
Politica, some intellectuals are
not liberal. If you want to see
a different kind of professor
molding (is there a better
word?) Stanford students, Mr.
Inch, it is your right and your
duty as a donating alumnus to
demand a change on The Farm,

community development pro
gram—an attempt at an altera
tion of the public culture of the
University with the intent of
transforming the way that the
members feel about themselves.
Cooperation and suggestions
in this attempt might focus
upon the evident need of increas
ing the opportunities of the
members of the community for
self-realization. This increased
opportunity should be available
to the students in their search
for life-models in a period of
transition, to the faculty in
their goal of transmitting the
excitement of intellecual discov
ery and of providing models of
another culture (subculture if
you will) and to the administra
tors in their role of providing
the resources and settings best
facilitating the attainment of
community goals.
The attempts to reformulate
student identity and to increase
the participation of students in
shaping a better order should
be recognized as legitimate ef
forts to deal with the frustra
tions of the present environ
ment. This normative position
rests ultimately on a personal
philosophy of education but
justification is offered in terms
of public goals and norms.
Present student frustrations
have their basis in the depart

in the isolation of classroom

These are not by any means

Dare we think that cultural

recognize that the operation of
the present academic process
functions more to alert the sub

idiosyncratic cues of high status
people — instilling a life-goal of
meeting environmental tests of
personal worth rather than to
invoke and inspire a search for
truth and a life-goal of self-ex

If we can see past the wishful
thoughts and the socially ap
proved nice-things-to-say, per
haps we can recognize that a call
to a new identity is a legitimate
and reasonable response to exist
ing conditions.
But to be successful, "there
must be commitment to the
change, and others must accord
it recognition and do all the
things needed to reinforce and
consolidate it so that a sense of
new identity can actually be at

• A Dungeon ?
Editor, The Daily:
In response to Allan Christe
low's letter of May 20th, I be
lieve that Stanford is justified
in calling itself a university,

meaning that Stanford is at
least as much of a university as
Berkeley, Harvard, or Oxford.
Stanford may not measure up
to Mr. Christelows' "ideal"
standards, but then again, many
of us have different conceptions
of the ideal.
I do not feel that Stanford is
perfect, that Stanford should
be controlled Ry outside alumni
pressure, that students should
be made to conform to some
clean-cut image, or that ROTC
students should be coerced into
donating their blood. However,
simply because we have several
problems in the university, this
does not mean that Stanford is
leading American society "down
the road to infamy."
In previous years, Stanford
students have been active in civil
rights work, the Peace Corps,
the Ravenswood tutorial, num
erous work projects, Vista, and
assorted student political orga
nizations.
Mr. Christelow cannot fairly
argue that Stanford students are
apathetic and uncritical. Stu
dents do take an interest in the
"harsh reality of the outside
world," and they have made
honest attempts to improve it.
Some of the credit for motivat
ing student activity belongs to
Sanford University as it now
exists in its, admittedly, imper
fect form.
Stanford is not the stultify
ing dungeon that Mr. Christelow
describes, nor is it a factory for
the production of machine parts.
It has been used as a vantage
point from wihch students have
re-evaluated many aspects of
the "surrounding world."
Unfortunately, many students
often become frustrated, per
haps like Mr. Christelow, when
they realize that the really big
problem of our age—the possi
bility of world war and the wave
of revolution sweeping Africa,
Asia and South America — are
beyond student control and fre
quently beyond our still limited
understanding.

• Second-Rate School
Editor, The Daily:
Stanford University's 'leap to
greatness' would be better
termed 'stumbling mediocrity'.
The so-called 'Harvard of the
West' is guilty of the following
cardinal sins:
• Blatant religious discrimi
nation (for over seventy years):
for refusing (as recently as one
week ago) to let Jews hold ser
vices on campus other than in
a gaudy Christian church whose
symbology is offensive even to
many campus Christians.
• Obsequious kowtowing to
alumni criticism: for suspending
a Freshman athlete from the
track team because his hair was
too long and thus offended a
few well-heeled alumni.
• Giving academic credit for
soldier courses (ROTC), the aca
demic content of which has been
controversial at best.
• Having a sloppily cata
logued and even more sloppily
run main library. A first-class
library is the sine qua non of a
great university. There is no
question where that leaves Stan
ford.
Like some people, Stanford is
more concerned with its image
than with itself. Are not all of
these unmistakable signs of a
second-rate university?

•Arrive? Never!
Editor, The Dally:
The Freshman Daily (May 17)
was very interesting, but in
some ways disconcerting.
After reading about Wilbur,
Civ, the personal voice in En
glish and any number of other
editorials about how freshmen
look at things, two disturbing
comments stood out most in my
mind: first, that of the Roble
girl who said "I'd change no
thing . . . I'm crazy about every
aspect of this place," and even
more, the remarke from Art
Fisher's column entitled "Fresh
men: You Are Here—But When
Will You Arrive?" that "Kid,
you're just a little freshman and
you don't know what's happen
ing."
Despite the risk of sounding
like someone who is ready to
solve the world's problems at the
end of the freshman year, I
think that both these comments
miss one of the most vitally im
portant attitudes one can ever
hope to cultivate: that of con
sructive dissatisfaction.
No society, such as Stanford
University, is so good that every
aspect of it should remain un
changed; Mr. Fisher's article re
flects the same absence of con
structive dissatisfaction as the
freshman comment, but in a
much more serious way. I ques
tion whether the senior who
would say to a freshman or any
other student, silently or other
wise, that "Kid, you're just a
little freshman and don't know
what's happening'' doesn't have
a very good idea himself of the
changes he has undergone dur
ing his four years at Stanford.
"Freshmen: You Are Here—
But When Will You Arrive?" ex
horts Mr. Fisher. I don't want
to arrive, if that means that at
the end of my senior year, I'll
think that I realize all the im
plications of my college experi
ences. I'm glad to be a fresh
man, just as I'll be glad to be a
sophomore, junior, and senior.
Because for every mistake 1
make this year, there was some
thing learned about myself or
others that was so valuable that
I was glad to be wrong in the
learning, so long as I learned.
Mr. Fisher tells us freshmen
that when we are seniors, we
will have changed and when we
realize that, we "will have made
it." He says further that until
we have made this realization,
"It's all Frosh Week until then."
Does he mean that to imply that
when we are seniors, we will
know what it's all about?
I hope not, and I think not.
If my ideas are idealistic, they
do not ignore experience. If be
ing a freshman means a little
bungling through life and some
realizations of ignorance, I'm
glad to be a freshman. I'm hap
py to know that I still have a lot
to learn, and that I always will;
I'm happy to know that I'll
never arrive.

• Rewarding Seminar
Editor, The Daily:
Because the Freshman Semi
nar program (discussed in May
17's Freshman Edition of The
Daily) is made up of unique
groups of individuals studying
relatively unrelated topics, it is
practically impossible to make
general statements about the
program as a whole.
By taking part in one of these
groups ("Modern Ballads and
Their Backgrounds" with Profes
sor Claude Simpson), I enjoyed
a wide exchange of knowledge
injected with personal theories.
That is, I found a high level of
intra-group communication of
specialized educational value
which both illustrated back
ground research and opened wide
the gates for individual study.
I left the seminar with what
I feel is an enlightened curiosity,
a feeling of accomplishment and
potential, and a knowledge
which I have found both enjoy
able and practical. I consider
this participation in the Fresh
man Seminar program one of
my most rewarding experiences
at Stanford.

• Second-Rate School
Editor, The Daily:
Stanford University's 'leap to
greatness' would be better
termed 'stumbling mediocrity'.
The so-called 'Harvard of the
West' is guilty of the following
cardinal sins:
• Blatant religious discrimi
nation (for over seventy years):
for refusing (as recently as one
week ago) to let Jews hold ser
vices on campus other than in
a gaudy Christian church whose
symbology is offensive even to
many campus Christians.
• Obsequious kowtowing to
alumni criticism: for suspending
a Freshman athlete from the
track team because his hair was
too long and thus offended a
few well-heeled alumni.
• Giving academic credit for
soldier courses (ROTC), the aca
demic content of which has been
controversial at best.
• Having a sloppily cata
logued and even more sloppily
run main library. A first-class
library is the sine qua non of a
great university. There is no
question where that leaves Stan
ford.
Like some people, Stanford is
more concerned with its image
than with itself. Are not all of
these unmistakable signs of a
second-rate university?

•Arrive? Never!
Editor, The Dally:
The Freshman Daily (May 17)
was very interesting, but in
some ways disconcerting.
After reading about Wilbur,
Civ, the personal voice in En
glish and any number of other
editorials about how freshmen
look at things, two disturbing
comments stood out most in my
mind: first, that of the Roble
girl who said "I'd change no
thing . . . I'm crazy about every
aspect of this place," and even
more, the remarke from Art
Fisher's column entitled "Fresh
men: You Are Here—But When
Will You Arrive?" that "Kid,
you're just a little freshman and
you don't know what's happen
ing."
Despite the risk of sounding
like someone who is ready to
solve the world's problems at the
end of the freshman year, I
think that both these comments
miss one of the most vitally im
portant attitudes one can ever
hope to cultivate: that of con
sructive dissatisfaction.
No society, such as Stanford
University, is so good that every
aspect of it should remain un
changed; Mr. Fisher's article re
flects the same absence of con
structive dissatisfaction as the
freshman comment, but in a
much more serious way. I ques
tion whether the senior who
would say to a freshman or any
other student, silently or other
wise, that "Kid, you're just a
little freshman and don't know
what's happening'' doesn't have
a very good idea himself of the
changes he has undergone dur
ing his four years at Stanford.
"Freshmen: You Are Here—
But When Will You Arrive?" ex
horts Mr. Fisher. I don't want
to arrive, if that means that at
the end of my senior year, I'll
think that I realize all the im
plications of my college experi
ences. I'm glad to be a fresh
man, just as I'll be glad to be a
sophomore, junior, and senior.
Because for every mistake 1
make this year, there was some
thing learned about myself or
others that was so valuable that
I was glad to be wrong in the
learning, so long as I learned.
Mr. Fisher tells us freshmen
that when we are seniors, we
will have changed and when we
realize that, we "will have made
it." He says further that until
we have made this realization,
"It's all Frosh Week until then."
Does he mean that to imply that
when we are seniors, we will
know what it's all about?
I hope not, and I think not.
If my ideas are idealistic, they
do not ignore experience. If be
ing a freshman means a little
bungling through life and some
realizations of ignorance, I'm
glad to be a freshman. I'm hap
py to know that I still have a lot
to learn, and that I always will;
I'm happy to know that I'll
never arrive.

• Rewarding Seminar
Editor, The Daily:
Because the Freshman Semi
nar program (discussed in May
17's Freshman Edition of The
Daily) is made up of unique
groups of individuals studying
relatively unrelated topics, it is
practically impossible to make
general statements about the
program as a whole.
By taking part in one of these
groups ("Modern Ballads and
Their Backgrounds" with Profes
sor Claude Simpson), I enjoyed
a wide exchange of knowledge
injected with personal theories.
That is, I found a high level of
intra-group communication of
specialized educational value
which both illustrated back
ground research and opened wide
the gates for individual study.
I left the seminar with what
I feel is an enlightened curiosity,
a feeling of accomplishment and
potential, and a knowledge
which I have found both enjoy
able and practical. I consider
this participation in the Fresh
man Seminar program one of
my most rewarding experiences
at Stanford.

• Common Standards
Editor, The Daily:
So you received ten letters
backing the position of Pat Mor
rison, who refused to co-operate
with his track coach when asked
to have his lovely locks trimmed.
Well, here is one letter which
does not back either Pat or you.
To a grown man—it appears
as perfectly silly that such ac
tions are so important. Pat
must conform to some common
standards. He wears pants,
doesn't he?
I have had more friends who
never attended Stanford kid me
about the situation. They get
lots of laughs out of you "kids."
We Stanford alumni really take
a beating because of the child
ish antics of a very few stu
dents.
This is written in the thought
you might appreciate knowing
how most of we old timers feel.
Please, don't follow Berkeley's
example!
ROY F. REINEMAN,
Covlna, Calif.
Editor, The Daily:
Stanford's first sit-in is now
history. If it is to be remem
bered at all, it will be remember
ed as a dismal failure; it could
not have been anything else.
Speaking as one who is sympa
thetic with the goals of the
"New Left" and the anti-Viet
nam war movements, I would
like to offer a few. thoughts as
to why the sit-in was doomed
from the start.
The technique of the sit-in
(at least in this generation) de
veloped out of the civil rights
movement in the South and has
been exported to other areas and
issues largely by those active
in the civil rights movement.
Yet the conditions under which
the technique succeeded in the
South were perhaps more im
portant to the success of the
movement than the sit-in tech
nique itself. It is this lesson
which the Stanford sit-in ig
nored.
• Non-violent civil disobedi
ence is an appeal to the public
conscience—not a method of co
ercing an individual.
• As an appeal to the public
conscience, it must carry such
moral justification as to over
come the democratic presump
tion against extra-legal meth
ods of protest.
• Moral justification and the
pragmatic concern for expedi
ency and utility cannot totally
be separated. These factors
which, under given circum
star e c will make the sit-in
~ble ? i compelling will
>r iQ Iso to -ake it morally
justiaJble—and vill make the
moral justification apparent to
the larger society.
a. Civil disobedience should
be used only when all other
existing remedies have been
exhausted; when every tradi
tional approach has been tried
and found wanting. Why did
the protesters' overwhelming
demand to have the Selective
Service test cancelled manifest
itself only days before the test
was scheduled? Would anyone
expect the faculty or adminis
tration to act on such short
notice when the tests had been
scheduled publicly for months?
Wasn't the impression con
veyed to the student body that
the demonstrators' moral re
vulsion to the test had ma
terialized overnight?
b. The goal of a sit-in must
be capable of precise and con
sistent articulation. Such was
the goal of the Southern civil
rights demonstrations. They
were demanding the right to
be free from specific forms of
racial discrimination — rights
guaranteed to them by the
Federal Constitution. What
was the goal of the Stanford
sit-in? Was it the complicity
of the University in the Selec
tive Service System? Such
complicity is wrong only if the
Selective Service System is
wrong. Was the System wrong
because it discriminated in fav
or of upper middle-class col
lege students? If so, were the
demonstrators calling for uni
versal military training, aboli
tion of conscription, or some
intermediate course? Did they
oppose the test simply on the
grounds that it aided the im
moral war in Vietnam? If the
war itself is immoral, can one
be criticized for preferring a
student exemption to the risk
of being sent to kill those who
we have no right to kij'?
The sit-in was a failure be
cause it was conducted without
regard to the essential nature
and function of civil disobedi
ence.

• Unfortunate
Approach
Editor, The Daily:
The demonstrators picketing
President Sterling's office pro
testing the use of Stanford as a
Selective Service Examination
Center are using this contro
versy to register their opposition
to the Draft in general and to
United States policy in the Viet
nam war. It is unfortunate that
this partcular even should have
been chosen as the vehicle of
protest, for it has resulted in a
conflict of the principles of the
demonstrators themselves and
has offended rather than merely
awakened a large number of
the Stanford men who consider
it a great convenience to be able
to take the examination on cam
pus.
Many of these demonstrators
are among those who are de
manding the right to be able to
obtain contraceptives from the
University Health Service, vet
these same students would deny
others the right to take the
Draft test on campus, if they so
desire. These particular protest
ers are demanding one right
while denying another. The con
traceptive question may not be
totally analagous to the Draft
test controversy, but neverthe
less, these demonstrators should
maintain some degree of consis
tency in their beliefs and actions
if they wish to avoid being la
beled hypocrites.

I would strongly urge these
protesting students, if they sin
cerely desire greater acceptance
of their ideas and values, to dis
continue this particular type of
demonstration which can only
do harm to the concepts they
stand for in the long run.

• Wrongly Directed
Editor, The Daily:
Thursday night during dinner,
mimeographed sheets were dis
tributed in the Wilbur dining
rooms, requesting support for a
vigil in President Sterling's of
fice. The expressed purpose of
this vigil was to "demand our
rights ... to enjoin the Univer
sity from cooperating with and
endorsing a rotten (sic) system
by giving the next deferment
test." We do not object to these
students expressing their views.
We do, however, feel that they
are protesting in the wrong
place and to the wrong person.
The draft test was given on a
voluntary basis. In making avail
able classroom space, we feel
that President Sterling was
merely cooperating with student
desire for a convenient place to
take the test. In doing this, nei
ther he nor the University was
"giving" nor necessarily "en
dorsing" these exams, as was
maintained by those sponsoring
the vigil. The test was given by
the Selective Service, to only
those students who, having con
sidered all alternatives, chose to
take it. If everyone has the right
to decide for himself whether to
take the test, those who do want
to should certainly be able to
take it at a convenient location.
Legitimate protest of the draft
policy should be directed to those
directly responsible—to the Se
lective Service—and not to the
President of the University.

• Praising Wert
Editor, The Daily:
A large number of students
counter-demonstrating in front
of President Sterling's office
were very favorably impressed
with Dean Wert's statement to
the sit-in protesters. The state
men made it abundantly clear
that President Sterling was will
ing to meet with five or six stu
dents in a private discussion;
privacy and the absence of news
media is a prerequisite for any
meaningful and intelligent dia
logue.
The protesters were given am
ple time to present their posi
tion through normal channels
(such as the Committee of Fif
teen) during the several months
since the draft exam at Stanford
was announced, but instead they
delayed action until one exam
had already been given.
The continuation of the sit-in
after Dean Wert's statement was
made served no purpose other
than obstructing normal activity
in the President's office, since
the draft exam would not be can
celled in spite of the demonstra
tors' effort to deny the right to
take the exam from those who
wished to take it.
The diciplinary action the pro
testers will receive has definite
ly been earned, and prompt ac
tion should be taken by the stu
dent judicial council.

• Activists Not Listening
Editor, The Daily:
I spoke to a youth who was
handing out mimeographed ma
terial on The Sit-in at the White
Memorial Plaza at noon on Mon
day, May 23. I asked him why he
was dressed in such an unkempt
way. He said that he liked it
that way. I replied that it was
offensive to me and I pointed
out to him that his feet were
very dirty. He answered that
that was because he was bare
foot. I suggested that he must
be quite young to be so careless
of his appearance and he admit
ted that he was very young. I
realize now that I should have
admonished this child to go
home to his mother.
In his editorial in The Stan
ford Daily of May 24, Mr. Roise
predicts a rise in student activ

ism at Stanford in 1966. Some of
us have been around the cam
pus for a long time. In fact we
have devoted most our lives to
Stanford students. Never under
estimate the power of a woman!
This is one woman, and there
are many faculty wives like me,
who will be active if necessary
next Fall. We will not permit a
small group of idealistic, but re
bellious and misguided adoles
cent beatniks led by graduate
Teaching Assistants, who state
that "actions of the faculty seem
to them to be an appalling in
dication of moral bankruptcy
and intellectual cowardice" to
wreck our university. If anyone
is guilty of not listening it is
the student activist. Perhaps the
dirt in his ears prevents him
from hearing.
My husband is not morally
bankrupt or an intellectual cow
ard and neither am I.

• Teaching The Faculty
Editor, The Daily:
Now that the sit-in is over and
we can try to assess the respon
sibility for the breakdown in
communications that led to it, let
us not forget to include the re
sponsibility of the faculty. The
fact is that the students did
not act until the faculty had re
fused to act.
It has been said that the fac
ulty could not have considered
the problem of the draft at their
meeting last Tuesday because
they had spent so much time on
classified contracts. That is un
doubtedly true. But why did they
have to wait until last Tuesday
to consider the matter?
Professors at Brandeis raised
the issue more than two months
ago. And why did they have to
wait until last Tuesday to con
sider classified contracts? That
issue was raised last December
by the GCC Newsletter. Have the
faculty stopped reading the
newspapers?
In this situation the students
were very careful not to violate
faculty prerogatives. But it
seems that the faculty will not
consider issues until students
have violated those prerogatives.
Why should students have to
tell their teachers that they are
tacitly condoning a possible vio
lation of academic freedom?
Why should students have to
tell their teachers that they are
condoning the participation of
the University in what may be
an immoral system? But it
seems that students do have to
tell their teachers, and it seems
that they have to do it violently.
Maybe the faculty have learned
as much from this incident as
the rest of us hope to have
learned. But if not, I am afraid
that we can expect more sit-ins.
And maybe next time they will
be in the offices of the Executive
Committee of the Academic
Council.

• Showing Their Colors
Editor, Th<> Daily:
There is a final chapter to the
story of the draft protest, which
didn't make monday's Daily:
After the demonstrators had
left the President's office, and
had walked to his home to dis
cover that he was away for the
weekend, they returned to cam
pus by the quickest route, frater
nity row. Boys on the lawn of the
ATO house shouted "It would

take three of you chickenshits
to make one of us!" and other
things they thought appropriate
to the occasion.
Boys at the Beta Theta Pi and
Phi Gamma Delta houses follow
ed suit, with the more inventive
Betas running up to their bal
cony to bombard the tired pro
testers with water balloons.
This self-comment says more
about the fraternity "system"
than any outsider ever could.
MARLENE CHARYN

• Decision-Making
Editor, The Daily:
The recent sit-in in the office
of President Sterling served to
dramatize an issue of fundamen
tal and long-standing importance
to everyone at Stanford Univer
sity. Can Stanford University
become the community of schol
ars which it claims to be?
The events of the past week-

end have shown that we are far
from attaining this goal. The
lack of willingness to communi
cate on the part of the adminis
tration has never been as clear
ly evident than in the unilateral
decision to hold a draft test on
campus which raises serious
questions for all at the Univer
sity.
It has also been evident with
regard to the issues of social
regs, liquor and religion on
which the administration
evinced little or no desire to act
until the application of power
on the part of some other group
was imminent.
It is true that the committee
of fifteen, the revival of LASSU
as a meaningful decision-making
body, and student participation
on certain committees has im
proved the situation somewhat
in the past few years.
However the total unwilling
ness of the administration to
consult students and revise on
the question of the di'aft test
before and after the sit-in indi
cates that the basic problem
hasn't been solved.
The desire of the administra
tion to substitute power for dis
cussion in this instance raises
further questions — the stu
dents who sat in tried are about
to be tried for violation of the
fundamental standard.
In a genuine community, the
basic standard of conduct should
be applicable to all within it,
not just one segment of its pop
ulation. It is without a doubt
that the intransigence evidenced
by President Sterling hurt the
Stanford community at least as
much as the action taken and
persisted in by the students as a
result.
Who, however, is going to try
him for violation of a fundamen
tal standard?
If Stanford is ever to become
a community in any meaningful
sense, communication, rather
than power struggle must play
the major role in University de
cision-making.
In addition, any basic stand
ard of conduct which is adopted
should be made applicable to all.

• Art Of Persuasion
Editor, The
It seems to me that much of
the enlightened campus dialogue
regarding this country's involve

ment in Viet Nam is failing in
its intended goal of awakening
anti-war sentiment. One of the
most obvious and most easily
corrected reasons for the unper
suasiveness of this dialogue is
the stereotype "beatnik" image
which many of the activists
convey to the uninitiated pub
lic.
The long hair and sandals and
beards of many articulate stu
dents cannot help but subtract
from the overall appeal of their
arguments to an audience which
is generally unaccustomed to
looking beyond surface appear
ance. Moreover, the national
audience welcomes the oppor
tunity to stereotype the student
activist as "just another beard
ed mal content, probably a Com
munist, and maybe a homosex
ual." Stereotyping, though some
times helpful, in this case mere
ly relieves the public of the bur
densome task of critical evalua
tion, when critical evaluation is
just what the activists want to

promote.
The tendency to stereotype,
prevalent among the uneducated
and among some politicians, is
sad—even tragic. But, it is com
mon. To provide the undecided
citizen with such an effortless
escape from a confrontation
with the issue neither does jus
tice to the war, to the citizen,
nor to the Student Left.
Of course, most students feel
that personal freedom is the
basis of their protest. That in
cludes the freedom to dress ac
cording to individual choice.
Freedom seems to me to rank
second only to happiness in the
hierarchy of human values. To
voluntarily give up any freedom
is an act with grave political
and philosophical implications
and should by no means be done
lightly. However, a few people
are dedicated not only to living
in the world, but to making the
world a better place in which to
live. For these few the casual
exercise of every freedom may
be costly in terms of accom
plishment.
To understand that I am not
advocating conformity, the issue
of personal freedom must be
put into perspective. Now, if
sprinter Pat Morrison wants to
let his hair grow to an unusual
length, that's his business. He
isn't trying to convince anyone
to think, or by implication, to do
as he does. His hair is only his
business.
But, the political activists are
engaged in the art of persua
sion, and they are foolish if
they believe that their appeal
goes out to a purely logical pub
lic. The SCPV, it is true, is not
trying to set fashions in hair
style any more than Morrison,
but only the naive orator fails
to see the irrational association
between the content of speech
and the appearance of speaker.
The successful orator capitalizes
upon this fact.
To those who at this point re
mind me that the student move
ment is also a protest against
ignorance and irrationality, not
a concession to it, I ask that
they refer that reminder to the
student leaders, who conceive
their own role and the role of
the university as one of leader
ship. How can there be leader
ship without a following?
It is an imperfect world where
certain personal freedoms, like
the freedom to express oneself
through the choice of clothes or

hair style, must be inhibited in
order to further some other
freedoms, like the freedom to
compete equally for public senti
ment alongside the models of
middleclass values. Those lead
ers who recognize the necessity
of coming out of the philosophi
cal ivory tower to establish con
tact with a non-philosophical
world should see this compro
mise as the least of many evils.
Some, obviously, refuse to
make that compromise. It seems
to me that their unwillingness
to compromise sheds some light
on the sincerity of their com
mitment to the goal of peace in
Viet Nam.
RON GARRISON
• Conflicting Demands
Editor, The Daily:
A basic contradiction emerges
in two of the recent protest
movements here at Stanford.
The SSRF wishes the univer
sity to supply contraceptives to
anyone who wants them with
the idea that each student would
then be able to make his (her)
own moral decision. That's fine.
But now the most recent
group proposes exactly the op
posite: that the individual stu
dent should not be allowed by
his individual choice (whether
moral or otherwise) to take the
selective service draft test on
university proper. This same
group indicts the faculty as a
unit for not supporting students
in a (now) redefined cause of
student particiaption in decision
making. This is truly an inter
esting case, since the decision
to hold a draft test was hardly
made at Building 10.
More student involvement in
decision making is certainly
needed at Stanford, but the re
cent draft test is a pretty weak
issue to identify it wih.
PHIL ARNOLD
• October Days
Editor, The Daily:
In trying to see the current
student unrest - administration
intransigence difficulties from a
point of view somewhere be
yond the heat of the conflict,
I am struck by one overriding
concern: What methods are ap
propriate to the solution of prob
lems that arise within a com
munity of scholars and their
students?
It seems to me that the most
appropriate methods would be
those which are the hallmark of
any thinking community: reas
on, definition, articulation, and
dialogue. This must be the case
so long as all protagonists are
concerned with preserving the
"community."
The present situation at Stan
ford, from this point of view, is
pretty dismal. The student lead
ers prefer to posit these delicate
issues concerning government
university, war-university, draft
university in the streets. The ad
ministration prefers to ignore
the problem, to be consistently
absent.
As the scene becomes increas
ingly dichotomized, as the pro
tagonists at either extreme ac
celerate the process of detach
ment from one another, cutting
lines of rational communication,
throwing up impenetrable walls
of opaque verbiage of absolutely
no use if dialogue is really de
sider between the extremes, the
possibility of clearly raising and
effectively solving these prob
lems becomes impossible.
Rather than a community of
scholars and students, this scene
is more reminiscent of Petro
grad in the spring of 3917. So
far, the problem, clumsily de
fined even in the pamphlets and
fly-leaves of those who have
raised it, has been articulated
in the manner of peasant muni
tion workers, through slogans at
best, through shouting rallies in
the streets at worst.
And the problem has been
met by an administration unwill
ing to admit the gravity of the
situation, as yet unable to think
out the problem or to take ag
gressively positive measures to
assess the nature of the student
demands and to land on a pro
gram of action which will insure
that the university will not
have to depend on the delicacy
of crowds in White Plaza to
solve these involved and intri
cate issues.
The problem with the bread
riots in Petrograd in 1917 is not
that they were an ineffective
expression of workers' and peas
ants' extreme discontent, but
that they were able to express
only this negative sentiment in
the absence of other viable
channels of communication. And
the problem with the Russian
Provisional Government in 1917
is not that it was a bad govern
ment, but that it was no gov
ernment at all. What can we ex
pect from next October?

• 'If Its Pressed
Editor, The Daily:
Hooray for the emerging Stan
ford. Down with ambivalent dou
ble-standards, bumbling bureau
cracy, and the multiversity-in
dustrial-military behemoth. Since

the election of "artistic social
ist" Dave Harris, Stanford has
made radical progress in identi
fying and confronting the real
issues. First, that bastion of in
trigue, the Electrical Engineer
ing Department, was identified
as a cover, albeit in the open,
for the monstrous CIA. Tlien
came the revelation of the blood
thirsty anti-intelectuallism of
the ROTC. This week, finally,
we're getting to the basic issue,
elimination of the "parentis
pocis" routine with the need
made obvious by the Athletic De
partment. It should be readily
apparent that the length of one's
hair is a private matter and
doesn't even require the "mu
tual consent" of the SSRF.
Furthermore, this leads im
mediately to a more basic issue,
the rights of the Stanford Dollie.
The restrictions on "Quad
clothes," actual and imagined,
must be eliminated. What right
has the University to impose its
ideas of contemporary dress
when such regulations obviously
contribute nothing to intellectual
attainment. Each person should
be free, at least in a university,
to be comfortable, to experi
ment, and to investigate various
modes of thought and apparel.
To the comment that the dis
traction of the Stanford males
by bikini-clad or even topless
damsels would be destructive to
their intellectual endeavors, I
say that this is merely a chal
lenge to the teachers. If their
teaching is stimulating enough,
who need watch the girls. After
all, we're here for an education,
not an eyeful.
Besides, think of the health
benefits. What could be more
American than taking in a little
sun on the way to class. Why
the reduction of auto accidents
involving students rushing back
from northern beaches and bars
alone should make everyone
wish the immediate elimination
of this childish regulation!
In keeping with the campaign
a number of slogans have been
suggested. "If It's Pressed, Don't
Wear It." "Be Comfortable,
Stimulate a Professor." And of
course, you can make up your
own.
I urge one and all to take up
this issue because at the rate
we're going there won't be many
worthy issues left.

I agree with Terry Inch, class

it's highly unfortunate that only

voted in the last election. How
ever, I feel sure that even if 100
percent had voted, Dave Harris
still would have won by a fair
margin.
To find the true reasons for
Dave's victory you will have to
look a little deeper than at just
the size of the electorate. You
will have to look at the forces
which led Stanford students to
vote for a rebel.
As a freshman I know that
one of the strongest influences
on my classmates is that of the
Wilbur Sponsors. I realize gen
eralizations are not always fair,
but the majority of the sponsors
I've met are radical, whether
outspoken like Dave or not.
What's more, because of admin
istration concessions, the Wil
bur Sponsors have remained a
self-perpetuating group; thus,
they will continue to impress
their radical ideas on freshmen.
This leads to the real ques
tion, who influences the spon
sors? More generally, who in
fluences Stanford students? Ob
viously the faculty, and many,
many members of the faculty
are radical. Again, I have to
speak from experience.
At the beginning of second
quarter, my mathematics class
was dismissed by Mr. Kowalski
because he refused to teach in
the ROTC building. Last Friday
I saw my first quarter English
TA, Mr. Addams, sitting on
President Sterling's window sill,
encouraging the anti-draft dem
onstrators,
Certainly these two examples
are extreme, but they suggest
what is often a more subtle radi
calism imposed on students by a
large section of the faculty. In
fact, I'm sure that many of the
"free thinkers" who voted for
Dave were merely reflecting
their instructors' ideas.
As an afterthought, contrary
to the recent article in Western
Politica, some intellectuals are
not liberal. If you want to see
a different kind of professor
molding (is there a better
word?) Stanford students, Mr.
Inch, it is your right and your
duty as a donating alumnus to
demand a change on The Farm,

• Development
Program
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to suggest that
the proposals of Dave Harris
et. al. be viewed as an attempted


"First, Premier Ky, you must learn the principles of democracy ..
community development pro
gram—an attempt at an altera
tion of the public culture of the
University with the intent of
transforming the way that the
members feel about themselves.
Cooperation and suggestions
in this attempt might focus
upon the evident need of increas
ing the opportunities of the
members of the community for
self-realization. This increased
opportunity should be available
to the students in their search
for life-models in a period of
transition, to the faculty in
their goal of transmitting the
excitement of intellecual discov
ery and of providing models of
another culture (subculture if
you will) and to the administra
tors in their role of providing
the resources and settings best
facilitating the attainment of
community goals.
The attempts to reformulate
student identity and to increase
the participation of students in
shaping a better order should
be recognized as legitimate ef
forts to deal with the frustra
tions of the present environ
ment. This normative position
rests ultimately on a personal
philosophy of education but
justification is offered in terms
of public goals and norms.
Present student frustrations
have their basis in the depart
mentalization of knowledge and
in the isolation of classroom
learning from personal develop
ment. (See Joseph Katz and
Nevitt Sanford for doubts on
this score.)
These are not by any means
the sole characteristics of uni
versity organization and opera

tion which contribute to the
process of turning excited, hope
ful freshmen into pragmatic,
other-directed, what-good-is-this
academic-crud upperclassmen.
What might lead one to ex
tend the participation hypothe
sis beyond the confines of the
psych lab to the larger commun
ity?
Dare we think that cultural
dynamics are not restricted to
primitive societies but operate
in the very Quad itself? Do we
recognize that the operation of
the present academic process
functions more to alert the sub
jects of the operations to the
idiosyncratic cues of high status
people — instilling a life-goal of
meeting environmental tests of
personal worth rather than to
invoke and inspire a search for
truth and a life-goal of self-ex
tending creativity?
If we can see past the wishful
thoughts and the socially ap
proved nice-things-to-say, per
haps we can recognize that a call
to a new identity is a legitimate
and reasonable response to exist
ing conditions.
But to be successful, "there
must be commitment to the
change, and others must accord
it recognition and do all the
things needed to reinforce and
consolidate it so that a sense of
new identity can actually be at
tained (Ward Goodenough, 1963,
p. 291.)
DENNIS J SIMS
• A Dungeon ?
Editor, The Daily:
In response to Allan Christe
low's letter of May 20th, I be
lieve that Stanford is justified
in calling itself a university,

meaning that Stanford is at
least as much of a university as
Berkeley, Harvard, or Oxford.
Stanford may not measure up
to Mr. Christelows' "ideal"
standards, but then again, many
of us have different conceptions
of the ideal.
I do not feel that Stanford is
perfect, that Stanford should
be controlled Ry outside alumni
pressure, that students should
be made to conform to some
clean-cut image, or that ROTC
students should be coerced into
donating their blood. However,
simply because we have several
problems in the university, this
does not mean that Stanford is
leading American society "down
the road to infamy."
In previous years, Stanford
students have been active in civil
rights work, the Peace Corps,
the Ravenswood tutorial, num
erous work projects, Vista, and
assorted student political orga
nizations.
Mr. Christelow cannot fairly
argue that Stanford students are
apathetic and uncritical. Stu
dents do take an interest in the
"harsh reality of the outside
world," and they have made
honest attempts to improve it.
Some of the credit for motivat
ing student activity belongs to
Sanford University as it now
exists in its, admittedly, imper
fect form.
Stanford is not the stultify
ing dungeon that Mr. Christelow
describes, nor is it a factory for
the production of machine parts.
It has been used as a vantage
point from wihch students have
re-evaluated many aspects of
the "surrounding world."
Unfortunately, many students
often become frustrated, per
haps like Mr. Christelow, when
they realize that the really big
problem of our age—the possi
bility of world war and the wave
of revolution sweeping Africa,
Asia and South America — are
beyond student control and fre
quently beyond our still limited
understanding.

• Second-Rate School
Editor, The Daily:
Stanford University's 'leap to
greatness' would be better
termed 'stumbling mediocrity'.
The so-called 'Harvard of the
West' is guilty of the following
cardinal sins:
• Blatant religious discrimi
nation (for over seventy years):
for refusing (as recently as one
week ago) to let Jews hold ser
vices on campus other than in
a gaudy Christian church whose
symbology is offensive even to
many campus Christians.
• Obsequious kowtowing to
alumni criticism: for suspending
a Freshman athlete from the
track team because his hair was
too long and thus offended a
few well-heeled alumni.
• Giving academic credit for
soldier courses (ROTC), the aca
demic content of which has been
controversial at best.
• Having a sloppily cata
logued and even more sloppily
run main library. A first-class
library is the sine qua non of a
great university. There is no
question where that leaves Stan
ford.
Like some people, Stanford is
more concerned with its image
than with itself. Are not all of
these unmistakable signs of a
second-rate university?

•Arrive? Never!
Editor, The Dally:
The Freshman Daily (May 17)
was very interesting, but in
some ways disconcerting.
After reading about Wilbur,
Civ, the personal voice in En
glish and any number of other
editorials about how freshmen
look at things, two disturbing
comments stood out most in my
mind: first, that of the Roble
girl who said "I'd change no
thing . . . I'm crazy about every
aspect of this place," and even
more, the remarke from Art
Fisher's column entitled "Fresh
men: You Are Here—But When
Will You Arrive?" that "Kid,
you're just a little freshman and
you don't know what's happen
ing."
Despite the risk of sounding
like someone who is ready to
solve the world's problems at the
end of the freshman year, I
think that both these comments
miss one of the most vitally im
portant attitudes one can ever
hope to cultivate: that of con
sructive dissatisfaction.
No society, such as Stanford
University, is so good that every
aspect of it should remain un
changed; Mr. Fisher's article re
flects the same absence of con
structive dissatisfaction as the
freshman comment, but in a
much more serious way. I ques
tion whether the senior who
would say to a freshman or any
other student, silently or other
wise, that "Kid, you're just a
little freshman and don't know
what's happening'' doesn't have
a very good idea himself of the
changes he has undergone dur
ing his four years at Stanford.
"Freshmen: You Are Here—
But When Will You Arrive?" ex
horts Mr. Fisher. I don't want
to arrive, if that means that at
the end of my senior year, I'll
think that I realize all the im
plications of my college experi
ences. I'm glad to be a fresh
man, just as I'll be glad to be a
sophomore, junior, and senior.
Because for every mistake 1
make this year, there was some
thing learned about myself or
others that was so valuable that
I was glad to be wrong in the
learning, so long as I learned.
Mr. Fisher tells us freshmen
that when we are seniors, we
will have changed and when we
realize that, we "will have made
it." He says further that until
we have made this realization,
"It's all Frosh Week until then."
Does he mean that to imply that
when we are seniors, we will
know what it's all about?
I hope not, and I think not.
If my ideas are idealistic, they
do not ignore experience. If be
ing a freshman means a little
bungling through life and some
realizations of ignorance, I'm
glad to be a freshman. I'm hap
py to know that I still have a lot
to learn, and that I always will;
I'm happy to know that I'll
never arrive.

• Rewarding Seminar
Editor, The Daily:
Because the Freshman Semi
nar program (discussed in May
17's Freshman Edition of The
Daily) is made up of unique
groups of individuals studying
relatively unrelated topics, it is
practically impossible to make
general statements about the
program as a whole.
By taking part in one of these
groups ("Modern Ballads and
Their Backgrounds" with Profes
sor Claude Simpson), I enjoyed
a wide exchange of knowledge
injected with personal theories.
That is, I found a high level of
intra-group communication of
specialized educational value
which both illustrated back
ground research and opened wide
the gates for individual study.
I left the seminar with what
I feel is an enlightened curiosity,
a feeling of accomplishment and
potential, and a knowledge
which I have found both enjoy
able and practical. I consider
this participation in the Fresh
man Seminar program one of
my most rewarding experiences
at Stanford.

• Common Standards
Editor, The Daily:
So you received ten letters
backing the position of Pat Mor
rison, who refused to co-operate
with his track coach when asked
to have his lovely locks trimmed.
Well, here is one letter which
does not back either Pat or you.
To a grown man—it appears
as perfectly silly that such ac
tions are so important. Pat
must conform to some common
standards. He wears pants,
doesn't he?
I have had more friends who
never attended Stanford kid me
about the situation. They get
lots of laughs out of you "kids."
We Stanford alumni really take
a beating because of the child
ish antics of a very few stu
dents.
This is written in the thought
you might appreciate knowing
how most of we old timers feel.
Please, don't follow Berkeley's
example!
ROY F. REINEMAN,
Covlna, Calif.
Editor, The Daily:
Stanford's first sit-in is now
history. If it is to be remem
bered at all, it will be remember
ed as a dismal failure; it could
not have been anything else.
Speaking as one who is sympa
thetic with the goals of the
"New Left" and the anti-Viet
nam war movements, I would
like to offer a few. thoughts as
to why the sit-in was doomed
from the start.
The technique of the sit-in
(at least in this generation) de
veloped out of the civil rights
movement in the South and has
been exported to other areas and
issues largely by those active
in the civil rights movement.
Yet the conditions under which
the technique succeeded in the
South were perhaps more im
portant to the success of the
movement than the sit-in tech
nique itself. It is this lesson
which the Stanford sit-in ig
nored.
• Non-violent civil disobedi
ence is an appeal to the public
conscience—not a method of co
ercing an individual.
• As an appeal to the public
conscience, it must carry such
moral justification as to over
come the democratic presump
tion against extra-legal meth
ods of protest.
• Moral justification and the
pragmatic concern for expedi
ency and utility cannot totally
be separated. These factors
which, under given circum
star e c will make the sit-in
~ble ? i compelling will
>r iQ Iso to -ake it morally
justiaJble—and vill make the
moral justification apparent to
the larger society.
a. Civil disobedience should
be used only when all other
existing remedies have been
exhausted; when every tradi
tional approach has been tried
and found wanting. Why did
the protesters' overwhelming
demand to have the Selective
Service test cancelled manifest
itself only days before the test
was scheduled? Would anyone
expect the faculty or adminis
tration to act on such short
notice when the tests had been
scheduled publicly for months?
Wasn't the impression con
veyed to the student body that
the demonstrators' moral re
vulsion to the test had ma
terialized overnight?
b. The goal of a sit-in must
be capable of precise and con
sistent articulation. Such was
the goal of the Southern civil
rights demonstrations. They
were demanding the right to
be free from specific forms of
racial discrimination — rights
guaranteed to them by the
Federal Constitution. What
was the goal of the Stanford
sit-in? Was it the complicity
of the University in the Selec
tive Service System? Such
complicity is wrong only if the
Selective Service System is
wrong. Was the System wrong
because it discriminated in fav
or of upper middle-class col
lege students? If so, were the
demonstrators calling for uni
versal military training, aboli
tion of conscription, or some
intermediate course? Did they
oppose the test simply on the
grounds that it aided the im
moral war in Vietnam? If the
war itself is immoral, can one
be criticized for preferring a
student exemption to the risk
of being sent to kill those who
we have no right to kij'?
The sit-in was a failure be
cause it was conducted without
regard to the essential nature
and function of civil disobedi
ence.

• Unfortunate
Approach
Editor, The Daily:
The demonstrators picketing
President Sterling's office pro
testing the use of Stanford as a
Selective Service Examination
Center are using this contro
versy to register their opposition
to the Draft in general and to
United States policy in the Viet
nam war. It is unfortunate that
this partcular even should have
been chosen as the vehicle of
protest, for it has resulted in a
conflict of the principles of the
demonstrators themselves and
has offended rather than merely
awakened a large number of
the Stanford men who consider
it a great convenience to be able
to take the examination on cam
pus.
Many of these demonstrators
are among those who are de
manding the right to be able to
obtain contraceptives from the
University Health Service, vet
these same students would deny
others the right to take the
Draft test on campus, if they so
desire. These particular protest
ers are demanding one right
while denying another. The con
traceptive question may not be
totally analagous to the Draft
test controversy, but neverthe
less, these demonstrators should
maintain some degree of consis
tency in their beliefs and actions
if they wish to avoid being la
beled hypocrites.

I would strongly urge these
protesting students, if they sin
cerely desire greater acceptance
of their ideas and values, to dis
continue this particular type of
demonstration which can only
do harm to the concepts they
stand for in the long run.

• Wrongly Directed
Editor, The Daily:
Thursday night during dinner,
mimeographed sheets were dis
tributed in the Wilbur dining
rooms, requesting support for a
vigil in President Sterling's of
fice. The expressed purpose of
this vigil was to "demand our
rights ... to enjoin the Univer
sity from cooperating with and
endorsing a rotten (sic) system
by giving the next deferment
test." We do not object to these
students expressing their views.
We do, however, feel that they
are protesting in the wrong
place and to the wrong person.
The draft test was given on a
voluntary basis. In making avail
able classroom space, we feel
that President Sterling was
merely cooperating with student
desire for a convenient place to
take the test. In doing this, nei
ther he nor the University was
"giving" nor necessarily "en
dorsing" these exams, as was
maintained by those sponsoring
the vigil. The test was given by
the Selective Service, to only
those students who, having con
sidered all alternatives, chose to
take it. If everyone has the right
to decide for himself whether to
take the test, those who do want
to should certainly be able to
take it at a convenient location.
Legitimate protest of the draft
policy should be directed to those
directly responsible—to the Se
lective Service—and not to the
President of the University.

• Praising Wert
Editor, The Daily:
A large number of students
counter-demonstrating in front
of President Sterling's office
were very favorably impressed
with Dean Wert's statement to
the sit-in protesters. The state
men made it abundantly clear
that President Sterling was will
ing to meet with five or six stu
dents in a private discussion;
privacy and the absence of news
media is a prerequisite for any
meaningful and intelligent dia
logue.
The protesters were given am
ple time to present their posi
tion through normal channels
(such as the Committee of Fif
teen) during the several months
since the draft exam at Stanford
was announced, but instead they
delayed action until one exam
had already been given.
The continuation of the sit-in
after Dean Wert's statement was
made served no purpose other
than obstructing normal activity
in the President's office, since
the draft exam would not be can
celled in spite of the demonstra
tors' effort to deny the right to
take the exam from those who
wished to take it.
The diciplinary action the pro
testers will receive has definite
ly been earned, and prompt ac
tion should be taken by the stu
dent judicial council.

• Activists Not Listening
Editor, The Daily:
I spoke to a youth who was
handing out mimeographed ma
terial on The Sit-in at the White
Memorial Plaza at noon on Mon
day, May 23. I asked him why he
was dressed in such an unkempt
way. He said that he liked it
that way. I replied that it was
offensive to me and I pointed
out to him that his feet were
very dirty. He answered that
that was because he was bare
foot. I suggested that he must
be quite young to be so careless
of his appearance and he admit
ted that he was very young. I
realize now that I should have
admonished this child to go
home to his mother.
In his editorial in The Stan
ford Daily of May 24, Mr. Roise
predicts a rise in student activ

ism at Stanford in 1966. Some of
us have been around the cam
pus for a long time. In fact we
have devoted most our lives to
Stanford students. Never under
estimate the power of a woman!
This is one woman, and there
are many faculty wives like me,
who will be active if necessary
next Fall. We will not permit a
small group of idealistic, but re
bellious and misguided adoles
cent beatniks led by graduate
Teaching Assistants, who state
that "actions of the faculty seem
to them to be an appalling in
dication of moral bankruptcy
and intellectual cowardice" to
wreck our university. If anyone
is guilty of not listening it is
the student activist. Perhaps the
dirt in his ears prevents him
from hearing.
My husband is not morally
bankrupt or an intellectual cow

• Teaching The Faculty
Editor, The Daily:
Now that the sit-in is over and
we can try to assess the respon
sibility for the breakdown in
communications that led to it, let
us not forget to include the re
sponsibility of the faculty. The
fact is that the students did
not act until the faculty had re
fused to act.
It has been said that the fac
ulty could not have considered
the problem of the draft at their
meeting last Tuesday because
they had spent so much time on
classified contracts. That is un
doubtedly true. But why did they
have to wait until last Tuesday
to consider the matter?
Professors at Brandeis raised
the issue more than two months
ago. And why did they have to
wait until last Tuesday to con
sider classified contracts? That
issue was raised last December
by the GCC Newsletter. Have the
faculty stopped reading the
newspapers?
In this situation the students
were very careful not to violate
faculty prerogatives. But it
seems that the faculty will not
consider issues until students
have violated those prerogatives.
Why should students have to
tell their teachers that they are
tacitly condoning a possible vio
lation of academic freedom?
Why should students have to
tell their teachers that they are
condoning the participation of
the University in what may be
an immoral system? But it
seems that students do have to
tell their teachers, and it seems
that they have to do it violently.
Maybe the faculty have learned
as much from this incident as
the rest of us hope to have
learned. But if not, I am afraid
that we can expect more sit-ins.
And maybe next time they will
be in the offices of the Executive
Committee of the Academic
Council.

• Showing Their Colors
Editor, Th<> Daily:
There is a final chapter to the
story of the draft protest, which
didn't make monday's Daily:
After the demonstrators had
left the President's office, and
had walked to his home to dis
cover that he was away for the
weekend, they returned to cam
pus by the quickest route, frater
nity row. Boys on the lawn of the
ATO house shouted "It would

take three of you chickenshits
to make one of us!" and other
things they thought appropriate
to the occasion.
Boys at the Beta Theta Pi and
Phi Gamma Delta houses follow
ed suit, with the more inventive
Betas running up to their bal
cony to bombard the tired pro
testers with water balloons.
This self-comment says more
about the fraternity "system"
than any outsider ever could.
MARLENE CHARYN

• Decision-Making
Editor, The Daily:
The recent sit-in in the office
of President Sterling served to
dramatize an issue of fundamen
tal and long-standing importance
to everyone at Stanford Univer
sity. Can Stanford University
become the community of schol
ars which it claims to be?
The events of the past week-

end have shown that we are far
from attaining this goal. The
lack of willingness to communi
cate on the part of the adminis
tration has never been as clear
ly evident than in the unilateral
decision to hold a draft test on
campus which raises serious
questions for all at the Univer
sity.
It has also been evident with
regard to the issues of social
regs, liquor and religion on
which the administration
evinced little or no desire to act
until the application of power
on the part of some other group
was imminent.
It is true that the committee
of fifteen, the revival of LASSU
as a meaningful decision-making
body, and student participation
on certain committees has im
proved the situation somewhat
in the past few years.
However the total unwilling
ness of the administration to
consult students and revise on
the question of the di'aft test
before and after the sit-in indi
cates that the basic problem
hasn't been solved.
The desire of the administra
tion to substitute power for dis
cussion in this instance raises
further questions — the stu
dents who sat in tried are about
to be tried for violation of the
fundamental standard.
In a genuine community, the
basic standard of conduct should
be applicable to all within it,
not just one segment of its pop
ulation. It is without a doubt
that the intransigence evidenced
by President Sterling hurt the
Stanford community at least as
much as the action taken and
persisted in by the students as a
result.
Who, however, is going to try
him for violation of a fundamen
tal standard?
If Stanford is ever to become
a community in any meaningful
sense, communication, rather
than power struggle must play
the major role in University de
cision-making.
In addition, any basic stand
ard of conduct which is adopted
should be made applicable to all.

• Art Of Persuasion
Editor, The
It seems to me that much of
the enlightened campus dialogue
regarding this country's involve

ment in Viet Nam is failing in
its intended goal of awakening
anti-war sentiment. One of the
most obvious and most easily
corrected reasons for the unper
suasiveness of this dialogue is
the stereotype "beatnik" image
which many of the activists
convey to the uninitiated pub
lic.
The long hair and sandals and
beards of many articulate stu
dents cannot help but subtract
from the overall appeal of their
arguments to an audience which
is generally unaccustomed to
looking beyond surface appear
ance. Moreover, the national
audience welcomes the oppor
tunity to stereotype the student
activist as "just another beard
ed mal content, probably a Com
munist, and maybe a homosex
ual." Stereotyping, though some
times helpful, in this case mere
ly relieves the public of the bur
densome task of critical evalua
tion, when critical evaluation is
just what the activists want to

promote.
The tendency to stereotype,
prevalent among the uneducated
and among some politicians, is
sad—even tragic. But, it is com
mon. To provide the undecided
citizen with such an effortless
escape from a confrontation
with the issue neither does jus
tice to the war, to the citizen,
nor to the Student Left.
Of course, most students feel
that personal freedom is the
basis of their protest. That in
cludes the freedom to dress ac
cording to individual choice.
Freedom seems to me to rank
second only to happiness in the
hierarchy of human values. To
voluntarily give up any freedom
is an act with grave political
and philosophical implications
and should by no means be done
lightly. However, a few people
are dedicated not only to living
in the world, but to making the
world a better place in which to
live. For these few the casual
exercise of every freedom may
be costly in terms of accom
plishment.
To understand that I am not
advocating conformity, the issue
of personal freedom must be
put into perspective. Now, if
sprinter Pat Morrison wants to
let his hair grow to an unusual
length, that's his business. He
isn't trying to convince anyone
to think, or by implication, to do
as he does. His hair is only his
business.
But, the political activists are
engaged in the art of persua
sion, and they are foolish if
they believe that their appeal
goes out to a purely logical pub
lic. The SCPV, it is true, is not
trying to set fashions in hair
style any more than Morrison,
but only the naive orator fails
to see the irrational association
between the content of speech
and the appearance of speaker.
The successful orator capitalizes
upon this fact.
To those who at this point re
mind me that the student move
ment is also a protest against
ignorance and irrationality, not
a concession to it, I ask that
they refer that reminder to the
student leaders, who conceive
their own role and the role of
the university as one of leader
ship. How can there be leader
ship without a following?
It is an imperfect world where
certain personal freedoms, like
the freedom to express oneself
through the choice of clothes or

hair style, must be inhibited in
order to further some other
freedoms, like the freedom to
compete equally for public senti
ment alongside the models of
middleclass values. Those lead
ers who recognize the necessity
of coming out of the philosophi
cal ivory tower to establish con
tact with a non-philosophical
world should see this compro
mise as the least of many evils.
Some, obviously, refuse to
make that compromise. It seems
to me that their unwillingness
to compromise sheds some light
on the sincerity of their com
mitment to the goal of peace in
Viet Nam.

• Conflicting Demands
Editor, The Daily:
A basic contradiction emerges
in two of the recent protest
movements here at Stanford.
The SSRF wishes the univer
sity to supply contraceptives to
anyone who wants them with
the idea that each student would
then be able to make his (her)
own moral decision. That's fine.
But now the most recent
group proposes exactly the op
posite: that the individual stu
dent should not be allowed by
his individual choice (whether
moral or otherwise) to take the
selective service draft test on
university proper. This same
group indicts the faculty as a
unit for not supporting students
in a (now) redefined cause of
student particiaption in decision
making. This is truly an inter
esting case, since the decision
to hold a draft test was hardly
made at Building 10.
More student involvement in
decision making is certainly
needed at Stanford, but the re
cent draft test is a pretty weak
issue to identify it wih.

• October Days
Editor, The Daily:
In trying to see the current
student unrest - administration
intransigence difficulties from a
point of view somewhere be
yond the heat of the conflict,
I am struck by one overriding
concern: What methods are ap
propriate to the solution of prob
lems that arise within a com
munity of scholars and their
students?
It seems to me that the most
appropriate methods would be
those which are the hallmark of
any thinking community: reas
on, definition, articulation, and
dialogue. This must be the case
so long as all protagonists are
concerned with preserving the
"community."
The present situation at Stan
ford, from this point of view, is
pretty dismal. The student lead
ers prefer to posit these delicate
issues concerning government
university, war-university, draft
university in the streets. The ad
ministration prefers to ignore
the problem, to be consistently
absent.
As the scene becomes increas
ingly dichotomized, as the pro
tagonists at either extreme ac
celerate the process of detach
ment from one another, cutting
lines of rational communication,
throwing up impenetrable walls
of opaque verbiage of absolutely
no use if dialogue is really de
sider between the extremes, the
possibility of clearly raising and
effectively solving these prob
lems becomes impossible.
Rather than a community of
scholars and students, this scene
is more reminiscent of Petro
grad in the spring of 3917. So
far, the problem, clumsily de
fined even in the pamphlets and
fly-leaves of those who have
raised it, has been articulated
in the manner of peasant muni
tion workers, through slogans at
best, through shouting rallies in
the streets at worst.
And the problem has been
met by an administration unwill
ing to admit the gravity of the
situation, as yet unable to think
out the problem or to take ag
gressively positive measures to
assess the nature of the student
demands and to land on a pro
gram of action which will insure
that the university will not
have to depend on the delicacy
of crowds in White Plaza to
solve these involved and intri
cate issues.
The problem with the bread
riots in Petrograd in 1917 is not
that they were an ineffective
expression of workers' and peas
ants' extreme discontent, but
that they were able to express
only this negative sentiment in
the absence of other viable
channels of communication. And
the problem with the Russian
Provisional Government in 1917
is not that it was a bad govern
ment, but that it was no gov
ernment at all. What can we ex
pect from next October?

• 'If Its Pressed
Editor, The Daily:
Hooray for the emerging Stan
ford. Down with ambivalent dou
ble-standards, bumbling bureau
cracy, and the multiversity-in
dustrial-military behemoth. Since

the election of "artistic social
ist" Dave Harris, Stanford has
made radical progress in identi
fying and confronting the real
issues. First, that bastion of in
trigue, the Electrical Engineer
ing Department, was identified
as a cover, albeit in the open,
for the monstrous CIA. Tlien
came the revelation of the blood
thirsty anti-intelectuallism of
the ROTC. This week, finally,
we're getting to the basic issue,
elimination of the "parentis
pocis" routine with the need
made obvious by the Athletic De
partment. It should be readily
apparent that the length of one's
hair is a private matter and
doesn't even require the "mu
tual consent" of the SSRF.
Furthermore, this leads im
mediately to a more basic issue,
the rights of the Stanford Dollie.
The restrictions on "Quad
clothes," actual and imagined,
must be eliminated. What right
has the University to impose its
ideas of contemporary dress
when such regulations obviously
contribute nothing to intellectual
attainment. Each person should
be free, at least in a university,
to be comfortable, to experi
ment, and to investigate various
modes of thought and apparel.
To the comment that the dis
traction of the Stanford males
by bikini-clad or even topless
damsels would be destructive to
their intellectual endeavors, I
say that this is merely a chal
lenge to the teachers. If their
teaching is stimulating enough,
who need watch the girls. After
all, we're here for an education,
not an eyeful.
Besides, think of the health
benefits. What could be more
American than taking in a little
sun on the way to class. Why
the reduction of auto accidents
involving students rushing back
from northern beaches and bars
alone should make everyone
wish the immediate elimination
of this childish regulation!
In keeping with the campaign
a number of slogans have been
suggested. "If It's Pressed, Don't
Wear It." "Be Comfortable,
Stimulate a Professor." And of
course, you can make up your
own.
I urge one and all to take up
this issue because at the rate
we're going there won't be many
worthy issues left.

• Bad Influence
Editor, The Daily:
I agree with Terry Inch, class
of '61, (The Daily, May 23) that
it's highly unfortunate that only
40 percent of the student body
voted in the last election. How
ever, I feel sure that even if 100
percent had voted, Dave Harris
still would have won by a fair
margin.
To find the true reasons for
Dave's victory you will have to
look a little deeper than at just
the size of the electorate. You
will have to look at the forces
which led Stanford students to
vote for a rebel.
As a freshman I know that
one of the strongest influences
on my classmates is that of the
Wilbur Sponsors. I realize gen
eralizations are not always fair,
but the majority of the sponsors
I've met are radical, whether
outspoken like Dave or not.
What's more, because of admin
istration concessions, the Wil
bur Sponsors have remained a
self-perpetuating group; thus,
they will continue to impress
their radical ideas on freshmen.
This leads to the real ques
tion, who influences the spon
sors? More generally, who in
fluences Stanford students? Ob
viously the faculty, and many,
many members of the faculty
are radical. Again, I have to
speak from experience.
At the beginning of second
quarter, my mathematics class
was dismissed by Mr. Kowalski
because he refused to teach in
the ROTC building. Last Friday
I saw my first quarter English
TA, Mr. Addams, sitting on
President Sterling's window sill,
encouraging the anti-draft dem
onstrators,
Certainly these two examples
are extreme, but they suggest
what is often a more subtle radi
calism imposed on students by a
large section of the faculty. In
fact, I'm sure that many of the
"free thinkers" who voted for
Dave were merely reflecting
their instructors' ideas.
As an afterthought, contrary
to the recent article in Western
Politica, some intellectuals are
not liberal. If you want to see
a different kind of professor
molding (is there a better
word?) Stanford students, Mr.
Inch, it is your right and your
duty as a donating alumnus to
demand a change on The Farm,

• Development
Program
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to suggest that
the proposals of Dave Harris
et. al. be viewed as an attempted


"First, Premier Ky, you must learn the principles of democracy ..
community development pro
gram—an attempt at an altera
tion of the public culture of the
University with the intent of
transforming the way that the
members feel about themselves.
Cooperation and suggestions
in this attempt might focus
upon the evident need of increas
ing the opportunities of the
members of the community for
self-realization. This increased
opportunity should be available
to the students in their search
for life-models in a period of
transition, to the faculty in
their goal of transmitting the
excitement of intellecual discov
ery and of providing models of
another culture (subculture if
you will) and to the administra
tors in their role of providing
the resources and settings best
facilitating the attainment of
community goals.
The attempts to reformulate
student identity and to increase
the participation of students in
shaping a better order should
be recognized as legitimate ef
forts to deal with the frustra
tions of the present environ
ment. This normative position
rests ultimately on a personal
philosophy of education but
justification is offered in terms
of public goals and norms.
Present student frustrations
have their basis in the depart
mentalization of knowledge and
in the isolation of classroom
learning from personal develop
ment. (See Joseph Katz and
Nevitt Sanford for doubts on
this score.)
These are not by any means
the sole characteristics of uni
versity organization and opera

tion which contribute to the
process of turning excited, hope
ful freshmen into pragmatic,
other-directed, what-good-is-this
academic-crud upperclassmen.
What might lead one to ex
tend the participation hypothe
sis beyond the confines of the
psych lab to the larger commun
ity?
Dare we think that cultural
dynamics are not restricted to
primitive societies but operate
in the very Quad itself? Do we
recognize that the operation of
the present academic process
functions more to alert the sub
jects of the operations to the
idiosyncratic cues of high status
people — instilling a life-goal of
meeting environmental tests of
personal worth rather than to
invoke and inspire a search for
truth and a life-goal of self-ex
tending creativity?
If we can see past the wishful
thoughts and the socially ap
proved nice-things-to-say, per
haps we can recognize that a call
to a new identity is a legitimate
and reasonable response to exist
ing conditions.
But to be successful, "there
must be commitment to the
change, and others must accord
it recognition and do all the
things needed to reinforce and
consolidate it so that a sense of
new identity can actually be at
tained (Ward Goodenough, 1963,
p. 291.)
DENNIS J SIMS
• A Dungeon ?
Editor, The Daily:
In response to Allan Christe
low's letter of May 20th, I be
lieve that Stanford is justified
in calling itself a university,

meaning that Stanford is at
least as much of a university as
Berkeley, Harvard, or Oxford.
Stanford may not measure up
to Mr. Christelows' "ideal"
standards, but then again, many
of us have different conceptions
of the ideal.
I do not feel that Stanford is
perfect, that Stanford should
be controlled Ry outside alumni
pressure, that students should
be made to conform to some
clean-cut image, or that ROTC
students should be coerced into
donating their blood. However,
simply because we have several
problems in the university, this
does not mean that Stanford is
leading American society "down
the road to infamy."
In previous years, Stanford
students have been active in civil
rights work, the Peace Corps,
the Ravenswood tutorial, num
erous work projects, Vista, and
assorted student political orga
nizations.
Mr. Christelow cannot fairly
argue that Stanford students are
apathetic and uncritical. Stu
dents do take an interest in the
"harsh reality of the outside
world," and they have made
honest attempts to improve it.
Some of the credit for motivat
ing student activity belongs to
Sanford University as it now
exists in its, admittedly, imper
fect form.
Stanford is not the stultify
ing dungeon that Mr. Christelow
describes, nor is it a factory for
the production of machine parts.
It has been used as a vantage
point from wihch students have
re-evaluated many aspects of
the "surrounding world."
Unfortunately, many students
often become frustrated, per
haps like Mr. Christelow, when
they realize that the really big
problem of our age—the possi
bility of world war and the wave
of revolution sweeping Africa,
Asia and South America — are
beyond student control and fre
quently beyond our still limited
understanding.

• Second-Rate School
Editor, The Daily:
Stanford University's 'leap to
greatness' would be better
termed 'stumbling mediocrity'.
The so-called 'Harvard of the
West' is guilty of the following
cardinal sins:
• Blatant religious discrimi
nation (for over seventy years):
for refusing (as recently as one
week ago) to let Jews hold ser
vices on campus other than in
a gaudy Christian church whose
symbology is offensive even to
many campus Christians.
• Obsequious kowtowing to
alumni criticism: for suspending
a Freshman athlete from the
track team because his hair was
too long and thus offended a
few well-heeled alumni.
• Giving academic credit for
soldier courses (ROTC), the aca
demic content of which has been
controversial at best.
• Having a sloppily cata
logued and even more sloppily
run main library. A first-class
library is the sine qua non of a
great university. There is no
question where that leaves Stan
ford.
Like some people, Stanford is
more concerned with its image
than with itself. Are not all of
these unmistakable signs of a
second-rate university?

•Arrive? Never!
Editor, The Dally:
The Freshman Daily (May 17)
was very interesting, but in
some ways disconcerting.
After reading about Wilbur,
Civ, the personal voice in En
glish and any number of other
editorials about how freshmen
look at things, two disturbing
comments stood out most in my
mind: first, that of the Roble
girl who said "I'd change no
thing . . . I'm crazy about every
aspect of this place," and even
more, the remarke from Art
Fisher's column entitled "Fresh
men: You Are Here—But When
Will You Arrive?" that "Kid,
you're just a little freshman and
you don't know what's happen
ing."
Despite the risk of sounding
like someone who is ready to
solve the world's problems at the
end of the freshman year, I
think that both these comments
miss one of the most vitally im
portant attitudes one can ever
hope to cultivate: that of con
sructive dissatisfaction.
No society, such as Stanford
University, is so good that every
aspect of it should remain un
changed; Mr. Fisher's article re
flects the same absence of con
structive dissatisfaction as the
freshman comment, but in a
much more serious way. I ques
tion whether the senior who
would say to a freshman or any
other student, silently or other
wise, that "Kid, you're just a
little freshman and don't know
what's happening'' doesn't have
a very good idea himself of the
changes he has undergone dur
ing his four years at Stanford.
"Freshmen: You Are Here—
But When Will You Arrive?" ex
horts Mr. Fisher. I don't want
to arrive, if that means that at
the end of my senior year, I'll
think that I realize all the im
plications of my college experi
ences. I'm glad to be a fresh
man, just as I'll be glad to be a
sophomore, junior, and senior.
Because for every mistake 1
make this year, there was some
thing learned about myself or
others that was so valuable that
I was glad to be wrong in the
learning, so long as I learned.
Mr. Fisher tells us freshmen
that when we are seniors, we
will have changed and when we
realize that, we "will have made
it." He says further that until
we have made this realization,
"It's all Frosh Week until then."
Does he mean that to imply that
when we are seniors, we will
know what it's all about?
I hope not, and I think not.
If my ideas are idealistic, they
do not ignore experience. If be
ing a freshman means a little
bungling through life and some
realizations of ignorance, I'm
glad to be a freshman. I'm hap
py to know that I still have a lot
to learn, and that I always will;
I'm happy to know that I'll
never arrive.

• Rewarding Seminar
Editor, The Daily:
Because the Freshman Semi
nar program (discussed in May
17's Freshman Edition of The
Daily) is made up of unique
groups of individuals studying
relatively unrelated topics, it is
practically impossible to make
general statements about the
program as a whole.
By taking part in one of these
groups ("Modern Ballads and
Their Backgrounds" with Profes
sor Claude Simpson), I enjoyed
a wide exchange of knowledge
injected with personal theories.
That is, I found a high level of
intra-group communication of
specialized educational value
which both illustrated back
ground research and opened wide
the gates for individual study.
I left the seminar with what
I feel is an enlightened curiosity,
a feeling of accomplishment and
potential, and a knowledge
which I have found both enjoy
able and practical. I consider
this participation in the Fresh
man Seminar program one of
my most rewarding experiences
at Stanford.

• Common Standards
Editor, The Daily:
So you received ten letters
backing the position of Pat Mor
rison, who refused to co-operate
with his track coach when asked
to have his lovely locks trimmed.
Well, here is one letter which
does not back either Pat or you.
To a grown man—it appears
as perfectly silly that such ac
tions are so important. Pat
must conform to some common
standards. He wears pants,
doesn't he?
I have had more friends who
never attended Stanford kid me
about the situation. They get
lots of laughs out of you "kids."
We Stanford alumni really take
a beating because of the child
ish antics of a very few stu
dents.
This is written in the thought
you might appreciate knowing
how most of we old timers feel.
Please, don't follow Berkeley's
example!
ROY F. REINEMAN,
Covlna, Calif.
Editor, The Daily:
Stanford's first sit-in is now
history. If it is to be remem
bered at all, it will be remember
ed as a dismal failure; it could
not have been anything else.
Speaking as one who is sympa
thetic with the goals of the
"New Left" and the anti-Viet
nam war movements, I would
like to offer a few. thoughts as
to why the sit-in was doomed
from the start.
The technique of the sit-in
(at least in this generation) de
veloped out of the civil rights
movement in the South and has
been exported to other areas and
issues largely by those active
in the civil rights movement.
Yet the conditions under which
the technique succeeded in the
South were perhaps more im
portant to the success of the
movement than the sit-in tech
nique itself. It is this lesson
which the Stanford sit-in ig
nored.
• Non-violent civil disobedi
ence is an appeal to the public
conscience—not a method of co
ercing an individual.
• As an appeal to the public
conscience, it must carry such
moral justification as to over
come the democratic presump
tion against extra-legal meth
ods of protest.
• Moral justification and the
pragmatic concern for expedi
ency and utility cannot totally
be separated. These factors
which, under given circum
star e c will make the sit-in
~ble ? i compelling will
>r iQ Iso to -ake it morally
justiaJble—and vill make the
moral justification apparent to
the larger society.
a. Civil disobedience should
be used only when all other
existing remedies have been
exhausted; when every tradi
tional approach has been tried
and found wanting. Why did
the protesters' overwhelming
demand to have the Selective
Service test cancelled manifest
itself only days before the test
was scheduled? Would anyone
expect the faculty or adminis
tration to act on such short
notice when the tests had been
scheduled publicly for months?
Wasn't the impression con
veyed to the student body that
the demonstrators' moral re
vulsion to the test had ma
terialized overnight?
b. The goal of a sit-in must
be capable of precise and con
sistent articulation. Such was
the goal of the Southern civil
rights demonstrations. They
were demanding the right to
be free from specific forms of
racial discrimination — rights
guaranteed to them by the
Federal Constitution. What
was the goal of the Stanford
sit-in? Was it the complicity
of the University in the Selec
tive Service System? Such
complicity is wrong only if the
Selective Service System is
wrong. Was the System wrong
because it discriminated in fav
or of upper middle-class col
lege students? If so, were the
demonstrators calling for uni
versal military training, aboli
tion of conscription, or some
intermediate course? Did they
oppose the test simply on the
grounds that it aided the im
moral war in Vietnam? If the
war itself is immoral, can one
be criticized for preferring a
student exemption to the risk
of being sent to kill those who
we have no right to kij'?
The sit-in was a failure be
cause it was conducted without
regard to the essential nature
and function of civil disobedi
ence.

• Unfortunate
Approach
Editor, The Daily:
The demonstrators picketing
President Sterling's office pro
testing the use of Stanford as a
Selective Service Examination
Center are using this contro
versy to register their opposition
to the Draft in general and to
United States policy in the Viet
nam war. It is unfortunate that
this partcular even should have
been chosen as the vehicle of
protest, for it has resulted in a
conflict of the principles of the
demonstrators themselves and
has offended rather than merely
awakened a large number of
the Stanford men who consider
it a great convenience to be able
to take the examination on cam
pus.
Many of these demonstrators
are among those who are de
manding the right to be able to
obtain contraceptives from the
University Health Service, vet
these same students would deny
others the right to take the
Draft test on campus, if they so
desire. These particular protest
ers are demanding one right
while denying another. The con
traceptive question may not be
totally analagous to the Draft
test controversy, but neverthe
less, these demonstrators should
maintain some degree of consis
tency in their beliefs and actions
if they wish to avoid being la
beled hypocrites.

I would strongly urge these
protesting students, if they sin
cerely desire greater acceptance
of their ideas and values, to dis
continue this particular type of
demonstration which can only
do harm to the concepts they
stand for in the long run.

• Wrongly Directed
Editor, The Daily:
Thursday night during dinner,
mimeographed sheets were dis
tributed in the Wilbur dining
rooms, requesting support for a
vigil in President Sterling's of
fice. The expressed purpose of
this vigil was to "demand our
rights ... to enjoin the Univer
sity from cooperating with and
endorsing a rotten (sic) system
by giving the next deferment
test." We do not object to these
students expressing their views.
We do, however, feel that they
are protesting in the wrong
place and to the wrong person.
The draft test was given on a
voluntary basis. In making avail
able classroom space, we feel
that President Sterling was
merely cooperating with student
desire for a convenient place to
take the test. In doing this, nei
ther he nor the University was
"giving" nor necessarily "en
dorsing" these exams, as was
maintained by those sponsoring
the vigil. The test was given by
the Selective Service, to only
those students who, having con
sidered all alternatives, chose to
take it. If everyone has the right
to decide for himself whether to
take the test, those who do want
to should certainly be able to
take it at a convenient location.
Legitimate protest of the draft
policy should be directed to those
directly responsible—to the Se
lective Service—and not to the
President of the University.

• Praising Wert
Editor, The Daily:
A large number of students
counter-demonstrating in front
of President Sterling's office
were very favorably impressed
with Dean Wert's statement to
the sit-in protesters. The state
men made it abundantly clear
that President Sterling was will
ing to meet with five or six stu
dents in a private discussion;
privacy and the absence of news
media is a prerequisite for any
meaningful and intelligent dia
logue.
The protesters were given am
ple time to present their posi
tion through normal channels
(such as the Committee of Fif
teen) during the several months
since the draft exam at Stanford
was announced, but instead they
delayed action until one exam
had already been given.
The continuation of the sit-in
after Dean Wert's statement was
made served no purpose other
than obstructing normal activity
in the President's office, since
the draft exam would not be can
celled in spite of the demonstra
tors' effort to deny the right to
take the exam from those who
wished to take it.
The diciplinary action the pro
testers will receive has definite
ly been earned, and prompt ac
tion should be taken by the stu
dent judicial council.

• Activists Not Listening
Editor, The Daily:
I spoke to a youth who was
handing out mimeographed ma
terial on The Sit-in at the White
Memorial Plaza at noon on Mon
day, May 23. I asked him why he
was dressed in such an unkempt
way. He said that he liked it
that way. I replied that it was
offensive to me and I pointed
out to him that his feet were
very dirty. He answered that
that was because he was bare
foot. I suggested that he must
be quite young to be so careless
of his appearance and he admit
ted that he was very young. I
realize now that I should have
admonished this child to go
home to his mother.
In his editorial in The Stan
ford Daily of May 24, Mr. Roise
predicts a rise in student activ

ism at Stanford in 1966. Some of
us have been around the cam
pus for a long time. In fact we
have devoted most our lives to
Stanford students. Never under
estimate the power of a woman!
This is one woman, and there
are many faculty wives like me,
who will be active if necessary
next Fall. We will not permit a
small group of idealistic, but re
bellious and misguided adoles
cent beatniks led by graduate
Teaching Assistants, who state
that "actions of the faculty seem
to them to be an appalling in
dication of moral bankruptcy
and intellectual cowardice" to
wreck our university. If anyone
is guilty of not listening it is
the student activist. Perhaps the
dirt in his ears prevents him
from hearing.

• Teaching The Faculty
Editor, The Daily:
Now that the sit-in is over and
we can try to assess the respon
sibility for the breakdown in
communications that led to it, let
us not forget to include the re
sponsibility of the faculty. The
fact is that the students did
not act until the faculty had re
fused to act.
It has been said that the fac
ulty could not have considered
the problem of the draft at their
meeting last Tuesday because
they had spent so much time on
classified contracts. That is un
doubtedly true. But why did they
have to wait until last Tuesday
to consider the matter?
Professors at Brandeis raised
the issue more than two months
ago. And why did they have to
wait until last Tuesday to con
sider classified contracts? That
issue was raised last December
by the GCC Newsletter. Have the
faculty stopped reading the
newspapers?
In this situation the students
were very careful not to violate
faculty prerogatives. But it
seems that the faculty will not
consider issues until students
have violated those prerogatives.
Why should students have to
tell their teachers that they are
tacitly condoning a possible vio
lation of academic freedom?
Why should students have to
tell their teachers that they are
condoning the participation of
the University in what may be
an immoral system? But it
seems that students do have to
tell their teachers, and it seems
that they have to do it violently.
Maybe the faculty have learned
as much from this incident as
the rest of us hope to have
learned. But if not, I am afraid
that we can expect more sit-ins.
And maybe next time they will
be in the offices of the Executive
Committee of the Academic
Council.

• Showing Their Colors
Editor, Th<> Daily:
There is a final chapter to the
story of the draft protest, which
didn't make monday's Daily:
After the demonstrators had
left the President's office, and
had walked to his home to dis
cover that he was away for the
weekend, they returned to cam
pus by the quickest route, frater
nity row. Boys on the lawn of the
ATO house shouted "It would

take three of you chickenshits
to make one of us!" and other
things they thought appropriate
to the occasion.
Boys at the Beta Theta Pi and
Phi Gamma Delta houses follow
ed suit, with the more inventive
Betas running up to their bal
cony to bombard the tired pro
testers with water balloons.
This self-comment says more
about the fraternity "system"
than any outsider ever could.

• Decision-Making
Editor, The Daily:
The recent sit-in in the office
of President Sterling served to
dramatize an issue of fundamen
tal and long-standing importance
to everyone at Stanford Univer
sity. Can Stanford University
become the community of schol
ars which it claims to be?
The events of the past week-

end have shown that we are far
from attaining this goal. The
lack of willingness to communi
cate on the part of the adminis
tration has never been as clear
ly evident than in the unilateral
decision to hold a draft test on
campus which raises serious
questions for all at the Univer
sity.
It has also been evident with
regard to the issues of social
regs, liquor and religion on
which the administration
evinced little or no desire to act
until the application of power
on the part of some other group
was imminent.
It is true that the committee
of fifteen, the revival of LASSU
as a meaningful decision-making
body, and student participation
on certain committees has im
proved the situation somewhat
in the past few years.
However the total unwilling
ness of the administration to
consult students and revise on
the question of the di'aft test
before and after the sit-in indi
cates that the basic problem
hasn't been solved.
The desire of the administra
tion to substitute power for dis
cussion in this instance raises
further questions — the stu
dents who sat in tried are about
to be tried for violation of the
fundamental standard.
In a genuine community, the
basic standard of conduct should
be applicable to all within it,
not just one segment of its pop
ulation. It is without a doubt
that the intransigence evidenced
by President Sterling hurt the
Stanford community at least as
much as the action taken and
persisted in by the students as a
result.
Who, however, is going to try
him for violation of a fundamen
tal standard?
If Stanford is ever to become
a community in any meaningful
sense, communication, rather
than power struggle must play
the major role in University de
cision-making.
In addition, any basic stand
ard of conduct which is adopted
should be made applicable to all.

• Art Of Persuasion
Editor, The
It seems to me that much of
the enlightened campus dialogue
regarding this country's involve

ment in Viet Nam is failing in
its intended goal of awakening
anti-war sentiment. One of the
most obvious and most easily
corrected reasons for the unper
suasiveness of this dialogue is
the stereotype "beatnik" image
which many of the activists
convey to the uninitiated pub
lic.
The long hair and sandals and
beards of many articulate stu
dents cannot help but subtract
from the overall appeal of their
arguments to an audience which
is generally unaccustomed to
looking beyond surface appear
ance. Moreover, the national
audience welcomes the oppor
tunity to stereotype the student
activist as "just another beard
ed mal content, probably a Com
munist, and maybe a homosex
ual." Stereotyping, though some
times helpful, in this case mere
ly relieves the public of the bur
densome task of critical evalua
tion, when critical evaluation is
just what the activists want to

promote.
The tendency to stereotype,
prevalent among the uneducated
and among some politicians, is
sad—even tragic. But, it is com
mon. To provide the undecided
citizen with such an effortless
escape from a confrontation
with the issue neither does jus
tice to the war, to the citizen,
nor to the Student Left.
Of course, most students feel
that personal freedom is the
basis of their protest. That in
cludes the freedom to dress ac
cording to individual choice.
Freedom seems to me to rank
second only to happiness in the
hierarchy of human values. To
voluntarily give up any freedom
is an act with grave political
and philosophical implications
and should by no means be done
lightly. However, a few people
are dedicated not only to living
in the world, but to making the
world a better place in which to
live. For these few the casual
exercise of every freedom may
be costly in terms of accom
plishment.
To understand that I am not
advocating conformity, the issue
of personal freedom must be
put into perspective. Now, if
sprinter Pat Morrison wants to
let his hair grow to an unusual
length, that's his business. He
isn't trying to convince anyone
to think, or by implication, to do
as he does. His hair is only his
business.
But, the political activists are
engaged in the art of persua
sion, and they are foolish if
they believe that their appeal
goes out to a purely logical pub
lic. The SCPV, it is true, is not
trying to set fashions in hair
style any more than Morrison,
but only the naive orator fails
to see the irrational association
between the content of speech
and the appearance of speaker.
The successful orator capitalizes
upon this fact.
To those who at this point re
mind me that the student move
ment is also a protest against
ignorance and irrationality, not
a concession to it, I ask that
they refer that reminder to the
student leaders, who conceive
their own role and the role of
the university as one of leader
ship. How can there be leader
ship without a following?
It is an imperfect world where
certain personal freedoms, like
the freedom to express oneself
through the choice of clothes or

hair style, must be inhibited in
order to further some other
freedoms, like the freedom to
compete equally for public senti
ment alongside the models of
middleclass values. Those lead
ers who recognize the necessity
of coming out of the philosophi
cal ivory tower to establish con
tact with a non-philosophical
world should see this compro
mise as the least of many evils.
Some, obviously, refuse to
make that compromise. It seems
to me that their unwillingness
to compromise sheds some light
on the sincerity of their com
mitment to the goal of peace in
Viet Nam.
RON GARRISON
• Conflicting Demands
Editor, The Daily:
A basic contradiction emerges
in two of the recent protest
movements here at Stanford.
The SSRF wishes the univer
sity to supply contraceptives to
anyone who wants them with
the idea that each student would
then be able to make his (her)
own moral decision. That's fine.
But now the most recent
group proposes exactly the op
posite: that the individual stu
dent should not be allowed by
his individual choice (whether
moral or otherwise) to take the
selective service draft test on
university proper. This same
group indicts the faculty as a
unit for not supporting students
in a (now) redefined cause of
student particiaption in decision
making. This is truly an inter
esting case, since the decision
to hold a draft test was hardly
made at Building 10.
More student involvement in
decision making is certainly
needed at Stanford, but the re
cent draft test is a pretty weak
issue to identify it wih.
PHIL ARNOLD
• October Days
Editor, The Daily:
In trying to see the current
student unrest - administration
intransigence difficulties from a
point of view somewhere be
yond the heat of the conflict,
I am struck by one overriding
concern: What methods are ap
propriate to the solution of prob
lems that arise within a com
munity of scholars and their
students?
It seems to me that the most
appropriate methods would be
those which are the hallmark of
any thinking community: reas
on, definition, articulation, and
dialogue. This must be the case
so long as all protagonists are
concerned with preserving the
"community."
The present situation at Stan
ford, from this point of view, is
pretty dismal. The student lead
ers prefer to posit these delicate
issues concerning government
university, war-university, draft
university in the streets. The ad
ministration prefers to ignore
the problem, to be consistently
absent.
As the scene becomes increas
ingly dichotomized, as the pro
tagonists at either extreme ac
celerate the process of detach
ment from one another, cutting
lines of rational communication,
throwing up impenetrable walls
of opaque verbiage of absolutely
no use if dialogue is really de
sider between the extremes, the
possibility of clearly raising and
effectively solving these prob
lems becomes impossible.
Rather than a community of
scholars and students, this scene
is more reminiscent of Petro
grad in the spring of 3917. So
far, the problem, clumsily de
fined even in the pamphlets and
fly-leaves of those who have
raised it, has been articulated
in the manner of peasant muni
tion workers, through slogans at
best, through shouting rallies in
the streets at worst.
And the problem has been
met by an administration unwill
ing to admit the gravity of the
situation, as yet unable to think
out the problem or to take ag
gressively positive measures to
assess the nature of the student
demands and to land on a pro
gram of action which will insure
that the university will not
have to depend on the delicacy
of crowds in White Plaza to
solve these involved and intri
cate issues.
The problem with the bread
riots in Petrograd in 1917 is not
that they were an ineffective
expression of workers' and peas
ants' extreme discontent, but
that they were able to express
only this negative sentiment in
the absence of other viable
channels of communication. And
the problem with the Russian
Provisional Government in 1917
is not that it was a bad govern
ment, but that it was no gov
ernment at all. What can we ex
pect from next October?

• 'If Its Pressed
Editor, The Daily:
Hooray for the emerging Stan
ford. Down with ambivalent dou
ble-standards, bumbling bureau
cracy, and the multiversity-in
dustrial-military behemoth. Since

the election of "artistic social
ist" Dave Harris, Stanford has
made radical progress in identi
fying and confronting the real
issues. First, that bastion of in
trigue, the Electrical Engineer
ing Department, was identified
as a cover, albeit in the open,
for the monstrous CIA. Tlien
came the revelation of the blood
thirsty anti-intelectuallism of
the ROTC. This week, finally,
we're getting to the basic issue,
elimination of the "parentis
pocis" routine with the need
made obvious by the Athletic De
partment. It should be readily
apparent that the length of one's
hair is a private matter and
doesn't even require the "mu
tual consent" of the SSRF.
Furthermore, this leads im
mediately to a more basic issue,
the rights of the Stanford Dollie.
The restrictions on "Quad
clothes," actual and imagined,
must be eliminated. What right
has the University to impose its
ideas of contemporary dress
when such regulations obviously
contribute nothing to intellectual
attainment. Each person should
be free, at least in a university,
to be comfortable, to experi
ment, and to investigate various
modes of thought and apparel.
To the comment that the dis
traction of the Stanford males
by bikini-clad or even topless
damsels would be destructive to
their intellectual endeavors, I
say that this is merely a chal
lenge to the teachers. If their
teaching is stimulating enough,
who need watch the girls. After
all, we're here for an education,
not an eyeful.
Besides, think of the health
benefits. What could be more
American than taking in a little
sun on the way to class. Why
the reduction of auto accidents
involving students rushing back
from northern beaches and bars
alone should make everyone
wish the immediate elimination
of this childish regulation!
In keeping with the campaign
a number of slogans have been
suggested. "If It's Pressed, Don't
Wear It." "Be Comfortable,
Stimulate a Professor." And of
course, you can make up your
own.
I urge one and all to take up
this issue because at the rate
we're going there won't be many
worthy issues left.

• Bad Influence
Editor, The Daily:
I agree with Terry Inch, class
of '61, (The Daily, May 23) that
it's highly unfortunate that only
40 percent of the student body
voted in the last election. How
ever, I feel sure that even if 100
percent had voted, Dave Harris
still would have won by a fair
margin.
To find the true reasons for
Dave's victory you will have to
look a little deeper than at just
the size of the electorate. You
will have to look at the forces
which led Stanford students to
vote for a rebel.
As a freshman I know that
one of the strongest influences
on my classmates is that of the
Wilbur Sponsors. I realize gen
eralizations are not always fair,
but the majority of the sponsors
I've met are radical, whether
outspoken like Dave or not.
What's more, because of admin
istration concessions, the Wil
bur Sponsors have remained a
self-perpetuating group; thus,
they will continue to impress
their radical ideas on freshmen.
This leads to the real ques
tion, who influences the spon
sors? More generally, who in
fluences Stanford students? Ob
viously the faculty, and many,
many members of the faculty
are radical. Again, I have to
speak from experience.
At the beginning of second
quarter, my mathematics class
was dismissed by Mr. Kowalski
because he refused to teach in
the ROTC building. Last Friday
I saw my first quarter English
TA, Mr. Addams, sitting on
President Sterling's window sill,
encouraging the anti-draft dem
onstrators,
Certainly these two examples
are extreme, but they suggest
what is often a more subtle radi
calism imposed on students by a
large section of the faculty. In
fact, I'm sure that many of the
"free thinkers" who voted for
Dave were merely reflecting
their instructors' ideas.
As an afterthought, contrary
to the recent article in Western
Politica, some intellectuals are
not liberal. If you want to see
a different kind of professor
molding (is there a better
word?) Stanford students, Mr.
Inch, it is your right and your
duty as a donating alumnus to
demand a change on The Farm,

• Development
Program
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to suggest that
the proposals of Dave Harris
et. al. be viewed as an attempted


"First, Premier Ky, you must learn the principles of democracy ..
community development pro
gram—an attempt at an altera
tion of the public culture of the
University with the intent of
transforming the way that the
members feel about themselves.
Cooperation and suggestions
in this attempt might focus
upon the evident need of increas
ing the opportunities of the
members of the community for
self-realization. This increased
opportunity should be available
to the students in their search
for life-models in a period of
transition, to the faculty in
their goal of transmitting the
excitement of intellecual discov
ery and of providing models of
another culture (subculture if
you will) and to the administra
tors in their role of providing
the resources and settings best
facilitating the attainment of
community goals.
The attempts to reformulate
student identity and to increase
the participation of students in
shaping a better order should
be recognized as legitimate ef
forts to deal with the frustra
tions of the present environ
ment. This normative position
rests ultimately on a personal
philosophy of education but
justification is offered in terms
of public goals and norms.
Present student frustrations
have their basis in the depart
mentalization of knowledge and
in the isolation of classroom
learning from personal develop
ment. (See Joseph Katz and
Nevitt Sanford for doubts on
this score.)
These are not by any means
the sole characteristics of uni
versity organization and opera

tion which contribute to the
process of turning excited, hope
ful freshmen into pragmatic,
other-directed, what-good-is-this
academic-crud upperclassmen.
What might lead one to ex
tend the participation hypothe
sis beyond the confines of the
psych lab to the larger commun
ity?
Dare we think that cultural
dynamics are not restricted to
primitive societies but operate
in the very Quad itself? Do we
recognize that the operation of
the present academic process
functions more to alert the sub
jects of the operations to the
idiosyncratic cues of high status
people — instilling a life-goal of
meeting environmental tests of
personal worth rather than to
invoke and inspire a search for
truth and a life-goal of self-ex
tending creativity?
If we can see past the wishful
thoughts and the socially ap
proved nice-things-to-say, per
haps we can recognize that a call
to a new identity is a legitimate
and reasonable response to exist
ing conditions.
But to be successful, "there
must be commitment to the
change, and others must accord
it recognition and do all the
things needed to reinforce and
consolidate it so that a sense of
new identity can actually be at
tained (Ward Goodenough, 1963,
p. 291.)
DENNIS J SIMS
• A Dungeon ?
Editor, The Daily:
In response to Allan Christe
low's letter of May 20th, I be
lieve that Stanford is justified
in calling itself a university,

meaning that Stanford is at
least as much of a university as
Berkeley, Harvard, or Oxford.
Stanford may not measure up
to Mr. Christelows' "ideal"
standards, but then again, many
of us have different conceptions
of the ideal.
I do not feel that Stanford is
perfect, that Stanford should
be controlled Ry outside alumni
pressure, that students should
be made to conform to some
clean-cut image, or that ROTC
students should be coerced into
donating their blood. However,
simply because we have several
problems in the university, this
does not mean that Stanford is
leading American society "down
the road to infamy."
In previous years, Stanford
students have been active in civil
rights work, the Peace Corps,
the Ravenswood tutorial, num
erous work projects, Vista, and
assorted student political orga
nizations.
Mr. Christelow cannot fairly
argue that Stanford students are
apathetic and uncritical. Stu
dents do take an interest in the
"harsh reality of the outside
world," and they have made
honest attempts to improve it.
Some of the credit for motivat
ing student activity belongs to
Sanford University as it now
exists in its, admittedly, imper
fect form.
Stanford is not the stultify
ing dungeon that Mr. Christelow
describes, nor is it a factory for
the production of machine parts.
It has been used as a vantage
point from wihch students have
re-evaluated many aspects of
the "surrounding world."
Unfortunately, many students
often become frustrated, per
haps like Mr. Christelow, when
they realize that the really big
problem of our age—the possi
bility of world war and the wave
of revolution sweeping Africa,
Asia and South America — are
beyond student control and fre
quently beyond our still limited
understanding.

• Second-Rate School
Editor, The Daily:
Stanford University's 'leap to
greatness' would be better
termed 'stumbling mediocrity'.
The so-called 'Harvard of the
West' is guilty of the following
cardinal sins:
• Blatant religious discrimi
nation (for over seventy years):
for refusing (as recently as one
week ago) to let Jews hold ser
vices on campus other than in
a gaudy Christian church whose
symbology is offensive even to
many campus Christians.
• Obsequious kowtowing to
alumni criticism: for suspending
a Freshman athlete from the
track team because his hair was
too long and thus offended a
few well-heeled alumni.
• Giving academic credit for
soldier courses (ROTC), the aca
demic content of which has been
controversial at best.
• Having a sloppily cata
logued and even more sloppily
run main library. A first-class
library is the sine qua non of a
great university. There is no
question where that leaves Stan
ford.
Like some people, Stanford is
more concerned with its image
than with itself. Are not all of
these unmistakable signs of a
second-rate university?

•Arrive? Never!
Editor, The Dally:
The Freshman Daily (May 17)
was very interesting, but in
some ways disconcerting.
After reading about Wilbur,
Civ, the personal voice in En
glish and any number of other
editorials about how freshmen
look at things, two disturbing
comments stood out most in my
mind: first, that of the Roble
girl who said "I'd change no
thing . . . I'm crazy about every
aspect of this place," and even
more, the remarke from Art
Fisher's column entitled "Fresh
men: You Are Here—But When
Will You Arrive?" that "Kid,
you're just a little freshman and
you don't know what's happen
ing."
Despite the risk of sounding
like someone who is ready to
solve the world's problems at the
end of the freshman year, I
think that both these comments
miss one of the most vitally im
portant attitudes one can ever
hope to cultivate: that of con
sructive dissatisfaction.
No society, such as Stanford
University, is so good that every
aspect of it should remain un
changed; Mr. Fisher's article re
flects the same absence of con
structive dissatisfaction as the
freshman comment, but in a
much more serious way. I ques
tion whether the senior who
would say to a freshman or any
other student, silently or other
wise, that "Kid, you're just a
little freshman and don't know
what's happening'' doesn't have
a very good idea himself of the
changes he has undergone dur
ing his four years at Stanford.
"Freshmen: You Are Here—
But When Will You Arrive?" ex
horts Mr. Fisher. I don't want
to arrive, if that means that at
the end of my senior year, I'll
think that I realize all the im
plications of my college experi
ences. I'm glad to be a fresh
man, just as I'll be glad to be a
sophomore, junior, and senior.
Because for every mistake 1
make this year, there was some
thing learned about myself or
others that was so valuable that
I was glad to be wrong in the
learning, so long as I learned.
Mr. Fisher tells us freshmen
that when we are seniors, we
will have changed and when we
realize that, we "will have made
it." He says further that until
we have made this realization,
"It's all Frosh Week until then."
Does he mean that to imply that
when we are seniors, we will
know what it's all about?
I hope not, and I think not.
If my ideas are idealistic, they
do not ignore experience. If be
ing a freshman means a little
bungling through life and some
realizations of ignorance, I'm
glad to be a freshman. I'm hap
py to know that I still have a lot
to learn, and that I always will;
I'm happy to know that I'll
never arrive.

• Rewarding Seminar
Editor, The Daily:
Because the Freshman Semi
nar program (discussed in May
17's Freshman Edition of The
Daily) is made up of unique
groups of individuals studying
relatively unrelated topics, it is
practically impossible to make
general statements about the
program as a whole.
By taking part in one of these
groups ("Modern Ballads and
Their Backgrounds" with Profes
sor Claude Simpson), I enjoyed
a wide exchange of knowledge
injected with personal theories.
That is, I found a high level of
intra-group communication of
specialized educational value
which both illustrated back
ground research and opened wide
the gates for individual study.
I left the seminar with what
I feel is an enlightened curiosity,
a feeling of accomplishment and
potential, and a knowledge
which I have found both enjoy
able and practical. I consider
this participation in the Fresh
man Seminar program one of
my most rewarding experiences
at Stanford.

So you received ten letters
backing the position of Pat Mor

with his track coach when asked
to have his lovely locks trimmed.
Well, here is one letter which
does not back either Pat or you.
To a grown man—it appears
as perfectly silly that such ac
tions are so important. Pat
must conform to some common
standards. He wears pants,
doesn't he?
I have had more friends who
never attended Stanford kid me
about the situation. They get
lots of laughs out of you "kids."
We Stanford alumni really take
a beating because of the child
ish antics of a very few stu

This is written in the thought
you might appreciate knowing
how most of we old timers feel.
Please, don't follow Berkeley's

ROY F. REINEMAN,
Covlna, Calif.
Editor, The Daily:
Stanford's first sit-in is now
history. If it is to be remem
bered at all, it will be remember
ed as a dismal failure; it could
not have been anything else.
Speaking as one who is sympa
thetic with the goals of the
"New Left" and the anti-Viet
nam war movements, I would
like to offer a few. thoughts as
to why the sit-in was doomed
from the start.
The technique of the sit-in
(at least in this generation) de
veloped out of the civil rights
movement in the South and has
been exported to other areas and
issues largely by those active
in the civil rights movement.
Yet the conditions under which
the technique succeeded in the
South were perhaps more im
portant to the success of the
movement than the sit-in tech
nique itself. It is this lesson
which the Stanford sit-in ig
nored.
• Non-violent civil disobedi
ence is an appeal to the public
conscience—not a method of co
ercing an individual.
• As an appeal to the public
conscience, it must carry such
moral justification as to over
come the democratic presump
tion against extra-legal meth
ods of protest.
• Moral justification and the
pragmatic concern for expedi
ency and utility cannot totally
be separated. These factors
which, under given circum
star e c will make the sit-in
~ble ? i compelling will
>r iQ Iso to -ake it morally
justiaJble—and vill make the
moral justification apparent to
the larger society.
a. Civil disobedience should
be used only when all other
existing remedies have been
exhausted; when every tradi
tional approach has been tried
and found wanting. Why did
the protesters' overwhelming
demand to have the Selective
Service test cancelled manifest
itself only days before the test
was scheduled? Would anyone
expect the faculty or adminis
tration to act on such short
notice when the tests had been
scheduled publicly for months?
Wasn't the impression con
veyed to the student body that
the demonstrators' moral re
vulsion to the test had ma
terialized overnight?
b. The goal of a sit-in must
be capable of precise and con
sistent articulation. Such was
the goal of the Southern civil
rights demonstrations. They
were demanding the right to
be free from specific forms of
racial discrimination — rights
guaranteed to them by the
Federal Constitution. What
was the goal of the Stanford
sit-in? Was it the complicity
of the University in the Selec
tive Service System? Such
complicity is wrong only if the
Selective Service System is
wrong. Was the System wrong
because it discriminated in fav
or of upper middle-class col
lege students? If so, were the
demonstrators calling for uni
versal military training, aboli
tion of conscription, or some
intermediate course? Did they
oppose the test simply on the
grounds that it aided the im
moral war in Vietnam? If the
war itself is immoral, can one
be criticized for preferring a
student exemption to the risk
of being sent to kill those who
we have no right to kij'?
The sit-in was a failure be
cause it was conducted without
regard to the essential nature
and function of civil disobedi
ence.

• Unfortunate
Approach
Editor, The Daily:
The demonstrators picketing
President Sterling's office pro
testing the use of Stanford as a
Selective Service Examination
Center are using this contro
versy to register their opposition
to the Draft in general and to
United States policy in the Viet
nam war. It is unfortunate that
this partcular even should have
been chosen as the vehicle of
protest, for it has resulted in a
conflict of the principles of the
demonstrators themselves and
has offended rather than merely
awakened a large number of
the Stanford men who consider
it a great convenience to be able
to take the examination on cam
pus.
Many of these demonstrators
are among those who are de
manding the right to be able to
obtain contraceptives from the
University Health Service, vet
these same students would deny
others the right to take the
Draft test on campus, if they so
desire. These particular protest
ers are demanding one right
while denying another. The con
traceptive question may not be
totally analagous to the Draft
test controversy, but neverthe
less, these demonstrators should
maintain some degree of consis
tency in their beliefs and actions
if they wish to avoid being la
beled hypocrites.

I would strongly urge these
protesting students, if they sin
cerely desire greater acceptance
of their ideas and values, to dis
continue this particular type of
demonstration which can only
do harm to the concepts they
stand for in the long run.

• Wrongly Directed
Editor, The Daily:
Thursday night during dinner,
mimeographed sheets were dis
tributed in the Wilbur dining
rooms, requesting support for a
vigil in President Sterling's of
fice. The expressed purpose of
this vigil was to "demand our
rights ... to enjoin the Univer
sity from cooperating with and
endorsing a rotten (sic) system
by giving the next deferment
test." We do not object to these
students expressing their views.
We do, however, feel that they
are protesting in the wrong
place and to the wrong person.
The draft test was given on a
voluntary basis. In making avail
able classroom space, we feel
that President Sterling was
merely cooperating with student
desire for a convenient place to
take the test. In doing this, nei
ther he nor the University was
"giving" nor necessarily "en
dorsing" these exams, as was
maintained by those sponsoring
the vigil. The test was given by
the Selective Service, to only
those students who, having con
sidered all alternatives, chose to
take it. If everyone has the right
to decide for himself whether to
take the test, those who do want
to should certainly be able to
take it at a convenient location.
Legitimate protest of the draft
policy should be directed to those
directly responsible—to the Se
lective Service—and not to the
President of the University.

• Praising Wert
Editor, The Daily:
A large number of students
counter-demonstrating in front
of President Sterling's office
were very favorably impressed
with Dean Wert's statement to
the sit-in protesters. The state
men made it abundantly clear
that President Sterling was will
ing to meet with five or six stu
dents in a private discussion;
privacy and the absence of news
media is a prerequisite for any
meaningful and intelligent dia
logue.
The protesters were given am
ple time to present their posi
tion through normal channels
(such as the Committee of Fif
teen) during the several months
since the draft exam at Stanford
was announced, but instead they
delayed action until one exam
had already been given.
The continuation of the sit-in
after Dean Wert's statement was
made served no purpose other
than obstructing normal activity
in the President's office, since
the draft exam would not be can
celled in spite of the demonstra
tors' effort to deny the right to
take the exam from those who
wished to take it.
The diciplinary action the pro
testers will receive has definite
ly been earned, and prompt ac
tion should be taken by the stu
dent judicial council.

• Activists Not Listening
Editor, The Daily:
I spoke to a youth who was
handing out mimeographed ma
terial on The Sit-in at the White
Memorial Plaza at noon on Mon
day, May 23. I asked him why he
was dressed in such an unkempt
way. He said that he liked it
that way. I replied that it was
offensive to me and I pointed
out to him that his feet were
very dirty. He answered that
that was because he was bare
foot. I suggested that he must
be quite young to be so careless
of his appearance and he admit
ted that he was very young. I
realize now that I should have
admonished this child to go
home to his mother.
In his editorial in The Stan
ford Daily of May 24, Mr. Roise
predicts a rise in student activ

ism at Stanford in 1966. Some of
us have been around the cam
pus for a long time. In fact we
have devoted most our lives to
Stanford students. Never under
estimate the power of a woman!
This is one woman, and there
are many faculty wives like me,
who will be active if necessary
next Fall. We will not permit a
small group of idealistic, but re
bellious and misguided adoles
cent beatniks led by graduate
Teaching Assistants, who state
that "actions of the faculty seem
to them to be an appalling in
dication of moral bankruptcy
and intellectual cowardice" to
wreck our university. If anyone
is guilty of not listening it is
the student activist. Perhaps the
dirt in his ears prevents him
from hearing.
My husband is not morally
bankrupt or an intellectual cow
ard and neither am I.

• Teaching The Faculty
Editor, The Daily:
Now that the sit-in is over and
we can try to assess the respon
sibility for the breakdown in
communications that led to it, let
us not forget to include the re
sponsibility of the faculty. The
fact is that the students did
not act until the faculty had re
fused to act.
It has been said that the fac
ulty could not have considered
the problem of the draft at their
meeting last Tuesday because
they had spent so much time on
classified contracts. That is un
doubtedly true. But why did they
have to wait until last Tuesday
to consider the matter?
Professors at Brandeis raised
the issue more than two months
ago. And why did they have to
wait until last Tuesday to con
sider classified contracts? That
issue was raised last December
by the GCC Newsletter. Have the
faculty stopped reading the
newspapers?
In this situation the students
were very careful not to violate
faculty prerogatives. But it
seems that the faculty will not
consider issues until students
have violated those prerogatives.
Why should students have to
tell their teachers that they are
tacitly condoning a possible vio
lation of academic freedom?
Why should students have to
tell their teachers that they are
condoning the participation of
the University in what may be
an immoral system? But it
seems that students do have to
tell their teachers, and it seems
that they have to do it violently.
Maybe the faculty have learned
as much from this incident as
the rest of us hope to have
learned. But if not, I am afraid
that we can expect more sit-ins.
And maybe next time they will
be in the offices of the Executive
Committee of the Academic
Council.

• Showing Their Colors
Editor, Th<> Daily:
There is a final chapter to the
story of the draft protest, which
didn't make monday's Daily:
After the demonstrators had
left the President's office, and
had walked to his home to dis
cover that he was away for the
weekend, they returned to cam
pus by the quickest route, frater
nity row. Boys on the lawn of the
ATO house shouted "It would

take three of you chickenshits
to make one of us!" and other
things they thought appropriate
to the occasion.
Boys at the Beta Theta Pi and
Phi Gamma Delta houses follow
ed suit, with the more inventive
Betas running up to their bal
cony to bombard the tired pro
testers with water balloons.
This self-comment says more
about the fraternity "system"
than any outsider ever could.

• Decision-Making
Editor, The Daily:
The recent sit-in in the office
of President Sterling served to
dramatize an issue of fundamen
tal and long-standing importance
to everyone at Stanford Univer
sity. Can Stanford University
become the community of schol
ars which it claims to be?
The events of the past week-

end have shown that we are far
from attaining this goal. The
lack of willingness to communi
cate on the part of the adminis
tration has never been as clear
ly evident than in the unilateral
decision to hold a draft test on
campus which raises serious
questions for all at the Univer
sity.
It has also been evident with
regard to the issues of social
regs, liquor and religion on
which the administration
evinced little or no desire to act
until the application of power
on the part of some other group
was imminent.
It is true that the committee
of fifteen, the revival of LASSU
as a meaningful decision-making
body, and student participation
on certain committees has im
proved the situation somewhat
in the past few years.
However the total unwilling
ness of the administration to
consult students and revise on
the question of the di'aft test
before and after the sit-in indi
cates that the basic problem
hasn't been solved.
The desire of the administra
tion to substitute power for dis
cussion in this instance raises
further questions — the stu
dents who sat in tried are about
to be tried for violation of the
fundamental standard.
In a genuine community, the
basic standard of conduct should
be applicable to all within it,
not just one segment of its pop
ulation. It is without a doubt
that the intransigence evidenced
by President Sterling hurt the
Stanford community at least as
much as the action taken and
persisted in by the students as a
result.
Who, however, is going to try
him for violation of a fundamen
tal standard?
If Stanford is ever to become
a community in any meaningful
sense, communication, rather
than power struggle must play
the major role in University de
cision-making.
In addition, any basic stand
ard of conduct which is adopted
should be made applicable to all.

• Art Of Persuasion
Editor, The
It seems to me that much of
the enlightened campus dialogue
regarding this country's involve

ment in Viet Nam is failing in
its intended goal of awakening
anti-war sentiment. One of the
most obvious and most easily
corrected reasons for the unper
suasiveness of this dialogue is
the stereotype "beatnik" image
which many of the activists
convey to the uninitiated pub
lic.
The long hair and sandals and
beards of many articulate stu
dents cannot help but subtract
from the overall appeal of their
arguments to an audience which
is generally unaccustomed to
looking beyond surface appear
ance. Moreover, the national
audience welcomes the oppor
tunity to stereotype the student
activist as "just another beard
ed mal content, probably a Com
munist, and maybe a homosex
ual." Stereotyping, though some
times helpful, in this case mere
ly relieves the public of the bur
densome task of critical evalua
tion, when critical evaluation is
just what the activists want to

promote.
The tendency to stereotype,
prevalent among the uneducated
and among some politicians, is
sad—even tragic. But, it is com
mon. To provide the undecided
citizen with such an effortless
escape from a confrontation
with the issue neither does jus
tice to the war, to the citizen,
nor to the Student Left.
Of course, most students feel
that personal freedom is the
basis of their protest. That in
cludes the freedom to dress ac
cording to individual choice.
Freedom seems to me to rank
second only to happiness in the
hierarchy of human values. To
voluntarily give up any freedom
is an act with grave political
and philosophical implications
and should by no means be done
lightly. However, a few people
are dedicated not only to living
in the world, but to making the
world a better place in which to
live. For these few the casual
exercise of every freedom may
be costly in terms of accom
plishment.
To understand that I am not
advocating conformity, the issue
of personal freedom must be
put into perspective. Now, if
sprinter Pat Morrison wants to
let his hair grow to an unusual
length, that's his business. He
isn't trying to convince anyone
to think, or by implication, to do
as he does. His hair is only his
business.
But, the political activists are
engaged in the art of persua
sion, and they are foolish if
they believe that their appeal
goes out to a purely logical pub
lic. The SCPV, it is true, is not
trying to set fashions in hair
style any more than Morrison,
but only the naive orator fails
to see the irrational association
between the content of speech
and the appearance of speaker.
The successful orator capitalizes
upon this fact.
To those who at this point re
mind me that the student move
ment is also a protest against
ignorance and irrationality, not
a concession to it, I ask that
they refer that reminder to the
student leaders, who conceive
their own role and the role of
the university as one of leader
ship. How can there be leader
ship without a following?
It is an imperfect world where
certain personal freedoms, like
the freedom to express oneself
through the choice of clothes or

hair style, must be inhibited in
order to further some other
freedoms, like the freedom to
compete equally for public senti
ment alongside the models of
middleclass values. Those lead
ers who recognize the necessity
of coming out of the philosophi
cal ivory tower to establish con
tact with a non-philosophical
world should see this compro
mise as the least of many evils.
Some, obviously, refuse to
make that compromise. It seems
to me that their unwillingness
to compromise sheds some light
on the sincerity of their com
mitment to the goal of peace in
Viet Nam.
RON GARRISON
• Conflicting Demands
Editor, The Daily:
A basic contradiction emerges
in two of the recent protest
movements here at Stanford.
The SSRF wishes the univer
sity to supply contraceptives to
anyone who wants them with
the idea that each student would
then be able to make his (her)
own moral decision. That's fine.
But now the most recent
group proposes exactly the op
posite: that the individual stu
dent should not be allowed by
his individual choice (whether
moral or otherwise) to take the
selective service draft test on
university proper. This same
group indicts the faculty as a
unit for not supporting students
in a (now) redefined cause of
student particiaption in decision
making. This is truly an inter
esting case, since the decision
to hold a draft test was hardly
made at Building 10.
More student involvement in
decision making is certainly
needed at Stanford, but the re
cent draft test is a pretty weak
issue to identify it wih.
PHIL ARNOLD
• October Days
Editor, The Daily:
In trying to see the current
student unrest - administration
intransigence difficulties from a
point of view somewhere be
yond the heat of the conflict,
I am struck by one overriding
concern: What methods are ap
propriate to the solution of prob
lems that arise within a com
munity of scholars and their
students?
It seems to me that the most
appropriate methods would be
those which are the hallmark of
any thinking community: reas
on, definition, articulation, and
dialogue. This must be the case
so long as all protagonists are
concerned with preserving the
"community."
The present situation at Stan
ford, from this point of view, is
pretty dismal. The student lead
ers prefer to posit these delicate
issues concerning government
university, war-university, draft
university in the streets. The ad
ministration prefers to ignore
the problem, to be consistently
absent.
As the scene becomes increas
ingly dichotomized, as the pro
tagonists at either extreme ac
celerate the process of detach
ment from one another, cutting
lines of rational communication,
throwing up impenetrable walls
of opaque verbiage of absolutely
no use if dialogue is really de
sider between the extremes, the
possibility of clearly raising and
effectively solving these prob
lems becomes impossible.
Rather than a community of
scholars and students, this scene
is more reminiscent of Petro
grad in the spring of 3917. So
far, the problem, clumsily de
fined even in the pamphlets and
fly-leaves of those who have
raised it, has been articulated
in the manner of peasant muni
tion workers, through slogans at
best, through shouting rallies in
the streets at worst.
And the problem has been
met by an administration unwill
ing to admit the gravity of the
situation, as yet unable to think
out the problem or to take ag
gressively positive measures to
assess the nature of the student
demands and to land on a pro
gram of action which will insure
that the university will not
have to depend on the delicacy
of crowds in White Plaza to
solve these involved and intri
cate issues.
The problem with the bread
riots in Petrograd in 1917 is not
that they were an ineffective
expression of workers' and peas
ants' extreme discontent, but
that they were able to express
only this negative sentiment in
the absence of other viable
channels of communication. And
the problem with the Russian
Provisional Government in 1917
is not that it was a bad govern
ment, but that it was no gov
ernment at all. What can we ex
pect from next October?
ALAN KIMBALL

• 'If Its Pressed
Editor, The Daily:
Hooray for the emerging Stan
ford. Down with ambivalent dou
ble-standards, bumbling bureau
cracy, and the multiversity-in
dustrial-military behemoth. Since

the election of "artistic social
ist" Dave Harris, Stanford has
made radical progress in identi
fying and confronting the real
issues. First, that bastion of in
trigue, the Electrical Engineer
ing Department, was identified
as a cover, albeit in the open,
for the monstrous CIA. Tlien
came the revelation of the blood
thirsty anti-intelectuallism of
the ROTC. This week, finally,
we're getting to the basic issue,
elimination of the "parentis
pocis" routine with the need
made obvious by the Athletic De
partment. It should be readily
apparent that the length of one's
hair is a private matter and
doesn't even require the "mu
tual consent" of the SSRF.
Furthermore, this leads im
mediately to a more basic issue,
the rights of the Stanford Dollie.
The restrictions on "Quad
clothes," actual and imagined,
must be eliminated. What right
has the University to impose its
ideas of contemporary dress
when such regulations obviously
contribute nothing to intellectual
attainment. Each person should
be free, at least in a university,
to be comfortable, to experi
ment, and to investigate various
modes of thought and apparel.
To the comment that the dis
traction of the Stanford males
by bikini-clad or even topless
damsels would be destructive to
their intellectual endeavors, I
say that this is merely a chal
lenge to the teachers. If their
teaching is stimulating enough,
who need watch the girls. After
all, we're here for an education,
not an eyeful.
Besides, think of the health
benefits. What could be more
American than taking in a little
sun on the way to class. Why
the reduction of auto accidents
involving students rushing back
from northern beaches and bars
alone should make everyone
wish the immediate elimination
of this childish regulation!
In keeping with the campaign
a number of slogans have been
suggested. "If It's Pressed, Don't
Wear It." "Be Comfortable,
Stimulate a Professor." And of
course, you can make up your
own.
I urge one and all to take up
this issue because at the rate
we're going there won't be many
worthy issues left.

• Bad Influence
Editor, The Daily:
I agree with Terry Inch, class
of '61, (The Daily, May 23) that
it's highly unfortunate that only
40 percent of the student body
voted in the last election. How
ever, I feel sure that even if 100
percent had voted, Dave Harris
still would have won by a fair
margin.
To find the true reasons for
Dave's victory you will have to
look a little deeper than at just
the size of the electorate. You
will have to look at the forces
which led Stanford students to
vote for a rebel.
As a freshman I know that
one of the strongest influences
on my classmates is that of the
Wilbur Sponsors. I realize gen
eralizations are not always fair,
but the majority of the sponsors
I've met are radical, whether
outspoken like Dave or not.
What's more, because of admin
istration concessions, the Wil
bur Sponsors have remained a
self-perpetuating group; thus,
they will continue to impress
their radical ideas on freshmen.
This leads to the real ques
tion, who influences the spon
sors? More generally, who in
fluences Stanford students? Ob
viously the faculty, and many,
many members of the faculty
are radical. Again, I have to
speak from experience.
At the beginning of second
quarter, my mathematics class
was dismissed by Mr. Kowalski
because he refused to teach in
the ROTC building. Last Friday
I saw my first quarter English
TA, Mr. Addams, sitting on
President Sterling's window sill,
encouraging the anti-draft dem
onstrators,
Certainly these two examples
are extreme, but they suggest
what is often a more subtle radi
calism imposed on students by a
large section of the faculty. In
fact, I'm sure that many of the
"free thinkers" who voted for
Dave were merely reflecting
their instructors' ideas.
As an afterthought, contrary
to the recent article in Western
Politica, some intellectuals are
not liberal. If you want to see
a different kind of professor
molding (is there a better
word?) Stanford students, Mr.
Inch, it is your right and your
duty as a donating alumnus to
demand a change on The Farm,

• Development
Program
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to suggest that
the proposals of Dave Harris
et. al. be viewed as an attempted


"First, Premier Ky, you must learn the principles of democracy ..
community development pro
gram—an attempt at an altera
tion of the public culture of the
University with the intent of
transforming the way that the
members feel about themselves.
Cooperation and suggestions
in this attempt might focus
upon the evident need of increas
ing the opportunities of the
members of the community for
self-realization. This increased
opportunity should be available
to the students in their search
for life-models in a period of
transition, to the faculty in
their goal of transmitting the
excitement of intellecual discov
ery and of providing models of
another culture (subculture if
you will) and to the administra
tors in their role of providing
the resources and settings best
facilitating the attainment of
community goals.
The attempts to reformulate
student identity and to increase
the participation of students in
shaping a better order should
be recognized as legitimate ef
forts to deal with the frustra
tions of the present environ
ment. This normative position
rests ultimately on a personal
philosophy of education but
justification is offered in terms
of public goals and norms.
Present student frustrations
have their basis in the depart
mentalization of knowledge and
in the isolation of classroom
learning from personal develop
ment. (See Joseph Katz and
Nevitt Sanford for doubts on
this score.)
These are not by any means
the sole characteristics of uni
versity organization and opera

tion which contribute to the
process of turning excited, hope
ful freshmen into pragmatic,
other-directed, what-good-is-this
academic-crud upperclassmen.
What might lead one to ex
tend the participation hypothe
sis beyond the confines of the
psych lab to the larger commun
ity?
Dare we think that cultural
dynamics are not restricted to
primitive societies but operate
in the very Quad itself? Do we
recognize that the operation of
the present academic process
functions more to alert the sub
jects of the operations to the
idiosyncratic cues of high status
people — instilling a life-goal of
meeting environmental tests of
personal worth rather than to
invoke and inspire a search for
truth and a life-goal of self-ex
tending creativity?
If we can see past the wishful
thoughts and the socially ap
proved nice-things-to-say, per
haps we can recognize that a call
to a new identity is a legitimate
and reasonable response to exist
ing conditions.
But to be successful, "there
must be commitment to the
change, and others must accord
it recognition and do all the
things needed to reinforce and
consolidate it so that a sense of
new identity can actually be at
tained (Ward Goodenough, 1963,
p. 291.)
DENNIS J SIMS
• A Dungeon ?
Editor, The Daily:
In response to Allan Christe
low's letter of May 20th, I be
lieve that Stanford is justified
in calling itself a university,

meaning that Stanford is at
least as much of a university as
Berkeley, Harvard, or Oxford.
Stanford may not measure up
to Mr. Christelows' "ideal"
standards, but then again, many
of us have different conceptions
of the ideal.
I do not feel that Stanford is
perfect, that Stanford should
be controlled Ry outside alumni
pressure, that students should
be made to conform to some
clean-cut image, or that ROTC
students should be coerced into
donating their blood. However,
simply because we have several
problems in the university, this
does not mean that Stanford is
leading American society "down
the road to infamy."
In previous years, Stanford
students have been active in civil
rights work, the Peace Corps,
the Ravenswood tutorial, num
erous work projects, Vista, and
assorted student political orga
nizations.
Mr. Christelow cannot fairly
argue that Stanford students are
apathetic and uncritical. Stu
dents do take an interest in the
"harsh reality of the outside
world," and they have made
honest attempts to improve it.
Some of the credit for motivat
ing student activity belongs to
Sanford University as it now
exists in its, admittedly, imper
fect form.
Stanford is not the stultify
ing dungeon that Mr. Christelow
describes, nor is it a factory for
the production of machine parts.
It has been used as a vantage
point from wihch students have
re-evaluated many aspects of
the "surrounding world."
Unfortunately, many students
often become frustrated, per
haps like Mr. Christelow, when
they realize that the really big
problem of our age—the possi
bility of world war and the wave
of revolution sweeping Africa,
Asia and South America — are
beyond student control and fre
quently beyond our still limited
understanding.
GEOFFREY STEVENS
Wilbur Freshman
• Second-Rate School
Editor, The Daily:
Stanford University's 'leap to
greatness' would be better
termed 'stumbling mediocrity'.
The so-called 'Harvard of the
West' is guilty of the following
cardinal sins:
• Blatant religious discrimi
nation (for over seventy years):
for refusing (as recently as one
week ago) to let Jews hold ser
vices on campus other than in
a gaudy Christian church whose
symbology is offensive even to
many campus Christians.
• Obsequious kowtowing to
alumni criticism: for suspending
a Freshman athlete from the
track team because his hair was
too long and thus offended a
few well-heeled alumni.
• Giving academic credit for
soldier courses (ROTC), the aca
demic content of which has been
controversial at best.
• Having a sloppily cata
logued and even more sloppily
run main library. A first-class
library is the sine qua non of a
great university. There is no
question where that leaves Stan
ford.
Like some people, Stanford is
more concerned with its image
than with itself. Are not all of
these unmistakable signs of a
second-rate university?

•Arrive? Never!
Editor, The Dally:
The Freshman Daily (May 17)
was very interesting, but in
some ways disconcerting.
After reading about Wilbur,
Civ, the personal voice in En
glish and any number of other
editorials about how freshmen
look at things, two disturbing
comments stood out most in my
mind: first, that of the Roble
girl who said "I'd change no
thing . . . I'm crazy about every
aspect of this place," and even
more, the remarke from Art
Fisher's column entitled "Fresh
men: You Are Here—But When
Will You Arrive?" that "Kid,
you're just a little freshman and
you don't know what's happen
ing."
Despite the risk of sounding
like someone who is ready to
solve the world's problems at the
end of the freshman year, I
think that both these comments
miss one of the most vitally im
portant attitudes one can ever
hope to cultivate: that of con
sructive dissatisfaction.
No society, such as Stanford
University, is so good that every
aspect of it should remain un
changed; Mr. Fisher's article re
flects the same absence of con
structive dissatisfaction as the
freshman comment, but in a
much more serious way. I ques
tion whether the senior who
would say to a freshman or any
other student, silently or other
wise, that "Kid, you're just a
little freshman and don't know
what's happening'' doesn't have
a very good idea himself of the
changes he has undergone dur
ing his four years at Stanford.
"Freshmen: You Are Here—
But When Will You Arrive?" ex
horts Mr. Fisher. I don't want
to arrive, if that means that at
the end of my senior year, I'll
think that I realize all the im
plications of my college experi
ences. I'm glad to be a fresh
man, just as I'll be glad to be a
sophomore, junior, and senior.
Because for every mistake 1
make this year, there was some
thing learned about myself or
others that was so valuable that
I was glad to be wrong in the
learning, so long as I learned.
Mr. Fisher tells us freshmen
that when we are seniors, we
will have changed and when we
realize that, we "will have made
it." He says further that until
we have made this realization,
"It's all Frosh Week until then."
Does he mean that to imply that
when we are seniors, we will
know what it's all about?
I hope not, and I think not.
If my ideas are idealistic, they
do not ignore experience. If be
ing a freshman means a little
bungling through life and some
realizations of ignorance, I'm
glad to be a freshman. I'm hap
py to know that I still have a lot
to learn, and that I always will;
I'm happy to know that I'll
never arrive.

• Rewarding Seminar
Editor, The Daily:
Because the Freshman Semi
nar program (discussed in May
17's Freshman Edition of The
Daily) is made up of unique
groups of individuals studying
relatively unrelated topics, it is
practically impossible to make
general statements about the
program as a whole.
By taking part in one of these
groups ("Modern Ballads and
Their Backgrounds" with Profes
sor Claude Simpson), I enjoyed
a wide exchange of knowledge
injected with personal theories.
That is, I found a high level of
intra-group communication of
specialized educational value
which both illustrated back
ground research and opened wide
the gates for individual study.
I left the seminar with what
I feel is an enlightened curiosity,
a feeling of accomplishment and
potential, and a knowledge
which I have found both enjoy
able and practical. I consider
this participation in the Fresh
man Seminar program one of
my most rewarding experiences
at Stanford.

Editor, The Daily:
So you received ten letters
backing the position of Pat Mor
rison, who refused to co-operate
with his track coach when asked
to have his lovely locks trimmed.
Well, here is one letter which
does not back either Pat or you.
To a grown man—it appears
as perfectly silly that such ac
tions are so important. Pat
must conform to some common
standards. He wears pants,
doesn't he?
I have had more friends who
never attended Stanford kid me
about the situation. They get
lots of laughs out of you "kids."
We Stanford alumni really take
a beating because of the child
ish antics of a very few stu
dents.
This is written in the thought
you might appreciate knowing
how most of we old timers feel.
Please, don't follow Berkeley's

ROY F. REINEMAN,
Covlna, Calif.
Editor, The Daily:
Stanford's first sit-in is now
history. If it is to be remem
bered at all, it will be remember
ed as a dismal failure; it could
not have been anything else.
Speaking as one who is sympa
thetic with the goals of the
"New Left" and the anti-Viet
nam war movements, I would
like to offer a few. thoughts as
to why the sit-in was doomed
from the start.
The technique of the sit-in
(at least in this generation) de
veloped out of the civil rights
movement in the South and has
been exported to other areas and
issues largely by those active
in the civil rights movement.
Yet the conditions under which
the technique succeeded in the
South were perhaps more im
portant to the success of the
movement than the sit-in tech
nique itself. It is this lesson
which the Stanford sit-in ig
nored.
• Non-violent civil disobedi
ence is an appeal to the public
conscience—not a method of co
ercing an individual.
• As an appeal to the public
conscience, it must carry such
moral justification as to over
come the democratic presump
tion against extra-legal meth
ods of protest.
• Moral justification and the
pragmatic concern for expedi
ency and utility cannot totally
be separated. These factors
which, under given circum
star e c will make the sit-in
~ble ? i compelling will
>r iQ Iso to -ake it morally
justiaJble—and vill make the
moral justification apparent to
the larger society.
a. Civil disobedience should
be used only when all other
existing remedies have been
exhausted; when every tradi
tional approach has been tried
and found wanting. Why did
the protesters' overwhelming
demand to have the Selective
Service test cancelled manifest
itself only days before the test
was scheduled? Would anyone
expect the faculty or adminis
tration to act on such short
notice when the tests had been
scheduled publicly for months?
Wasn't the impression con
veyed to the student body that
the demonstrators' moral re
vulsion to the test had ma
terialized overnight?
b. The goal of a sit-in must
be capable of precise and con
sistent articulation. Such was
the goal of the Southern civil
rights demonstrations. They
were demanding the right to
be free from specific forms of
racial discrimination — rights
guaranteed to them by the
Federal Constitution. What
was the goal of the Stanford
sit-in? Was it the complicity
of the University in the Selec
tive Service System? Such
complicity is wrong only if the
Selective Service System is
wrong. Was the System wrong
because it discriminated in fav
or of upper middle-class col
lege students? If so, were the
demonstrators calling for uni
versal military training, aboli
tion of conscription, or some
intermediate course? Did they
oppose the test simply on the
grounds that it aided the im
moral war in Vietnam? If the
war itself is immoral, can one
be criticized for preferring a
student exemption to the risk
of being sent to kill those who
we have no right to kij'?
The sit-in was a failure be
cause it was conducted without
regard to the essential nature
and function of civil disobedi
ence.

• Unfortunate
Approach
Editor, The Daily:
The demonstrators picketing
President Sterling's office pro
testing the use of Stanford as a
Selective Service Examination
Center are using this contro
versy to register their opposition
to the Draft in general and to
United States policy in the Viet
nam war. It is unfortunate that
this partcular even should have
been chosen as the vehicle of
protest, for it has resulted in a
conflict of the principles of the
demonstrators themselves and
has offended rather than merely
awakened a large number of
the Stanford men who consider
it a great convenience to be able
to take the examination on cam
pus.
Many of these demonstrators
are among those who are de
manding the right to be able to
obtain contraceptives from the
University Health Service, vet
these same students would deny
others the right to take the
Draft test on campus, if they so
desire. These particular protest
ers are demanding one right
while denying another. The con
traceptive question may not be
totally analagous to the Draft
test controversy, but neverthe
less, these demonstrators should
maintain some degree of consis
tency in their beliefs and actions
if they wish to avoid being la
beled hypocrites.

I would strongly urge these
protesting students, if they sin
cerely desire greater acceptance
of their ideas and values, to dis
continue this particular type of
demonstration which can only
do harm to the concepts they
stand for in the long run.

• Wrongly Directed
Editor, The Daily:
Thursday night during dinner,
mimeographed sheets were dis
tributed in the Wilbur dining
rooms, requesting support for a
vigil in President Sterling's of
fice. The expressed purpose of
this vigil was to "demand our
rights ... to enjoin the Univer
sity from cooperating with and
endorsing a rotten (sic) system
by giving the next deferment
test." We do not object to these
students expressing their views.
We do, however, feel that they
are protesting in the wrong
place and to the wrong person.
The draft test was given on a
voluntary basis. In making avail
able classroom space, we feel
that President Sterling was
merely cooperating with student
desire for a convenient place to
take the test. In doing this, nei
ther he nor the University was
"giving" nor necessarily "en
dorsing" these exams, as was
maintained by those sponsoring
the vigil. The test was given by
the Selective Service, to only
those students who, having con
sidered all alternatives, chose to
take it. If everyone has the right
to decide for himself whether to
take the test, those who do want
to should certainly be able to
take it at a convenient location.
Legitimate protest of the draft
policy should be directed to those
directly responsible—to the Se
lective Service—and not to the
President of the University.

• Praising Wert
Editor, The Daily:
A large number of students
counter-demonstrating in front
of President Sterling's office
were very favorably impressed
with Dean Wert's statement to
the sit-in protesters. The state
men made it abundantly clear
that President Sterling was will
ing to meet with five or six stu
dents in a private discussion;
privacy and the absence of news
media is a prerequisite for any
meaningful and intelligent dia
logue.
The protesters were given am
ple time to present their posi
tion through normal channels
(such as the Committee of Fif
teen) during the several months
since the draft exam at Stanford
was announced, but instead they
delayed action until one exam
had already been given.
The continuation of the sit-in
after Dean Wert's statement was
made served no purpose other
than obstructing normal activity
in the President's office, since
the draft exam would not be can
celled in spite of the demonstra
tors' effort to deny the right to
take the exam from those who
wished to take it.
The diciplinary action the pro
testers will receive has definite
ly been earned, and prompt ac
tion should be taken by the stu
dent judicial council.

• Activists Not Listening
Editor, The Daily:
I spoke to a youth who was
handing out mimeographed ma
terial on The Sit-in at the White
Memorial Plaza at noon on Mon
day, May 23. I asked him why he
was dressed in such an unkempt
way. He said that he liked it
that way. I replied that it was
offensive to me and I pointed
out to him that his feet were
very dirty. He answered that
that was because he was bare
foot. I suggested that he must
be quite young to be so careless
of his appearance and he admit
ted that he was very young. I
realize now that I should have
admonished this child to go
home to his mother.
In his editorial in The Stan
ford Daily of May 24, Mr. Roise
predicts a rise in student activ

ism at Stanford in 1966. Some of
us have been around the cam
pus for a long time. In fact we
have devoted most our lives to
Stanford students. Never under
estimate the power of a woman!
This is one woman, and there
are many faculty wives like me,
who will be active if necessary
next Fall. We will not permit a
small group of idealistic, but re
bellious and misguided adoles
cent beatniks led by graduate
Teaching Assistants, who state
that "actions of the faculty seem
to them to be an appalling in
dication of moral bankruptcy
and intellectual cowardice" to
wreck our university. If anyone
is guilty of not listening it is
the student activist. Perhaps the
dirt in his ears prevents him
from hearing.

bankrupt or an intellectual cow

• Teaching The Faculty
Editor, The Daily:
Now that the sit-in is over and
we can try to assess the respon
sibility for the breakdown in
communications that led to it, let
us not forget to include the re
sponsibility of the faculty. The
fact is that the students did
not act until the faculty had re
fused to act.
It has been said that the fac
ulty could not have considered
the problem of the draft at their
meeting last Tuesday because
they had spent so much time on
classified contracts. That is un
doubtedly true. But why did they
have to wait until last Tuesday
to consider the matter?
Professors at Brandeis raised
the issue more than two months
ago. And why did they have to
wait until last Tuesday to con
sider classified contracts? That
issue was raised last December
by the GCC Newsletter. Have the
faculty stopped reading the
newspapers?
In this situation the students
were very careful not to violate
faculty prerogatives. But it
seems that the faculty will not
consider issues until students
have violated those prerogatives.
Why should students have to
tell their teachers that they are
tacitly condoning a possible vio
lation of academic freedom?
Why should students have to
tell their teachers that they are
condoning the participation of
the University in what may be
an immoral system? But it
seems that students do have to
tell their teachers, and it seems
that they have to do it violently.
Maybe the faculty have learned
as much from this incident as
the rest of us hope to have
learned. But if not, I am afraid
that we can expect more sit-ins.
And maybe next time they will
be in the offices of the Executive
Committee of the Academic
Council.

• Showing Their Colors
Editor, Th<> Daily:
There is a final chapter to the
story of the draft protest, which
didn't make monday's Daily:
After the demonstrators had
left the President's office, and
had walked to his home to dis
cover that he was away for the
weekend, they returned to cam
pus by the quickest route, frater
nity row. Boys on the lawn of the
ATO house shouted "It would

take three of you chickenshits
to make one of us!" and other
things they thought appropriate
to the occasion.
Boys at the Beta Theta Pi and
Phi Gamma Delta houses follow
ed suit, with the more inventive
Betas running up to their bal
cony to bombard the tired pro
testers with water balloons.
This self-comment says more
about the fraternity "system"
than any outsider ever could.
MARLENE CHARYN

• Decision-Making
Editor, The Daily:
The recent sit-in in the office
of President Sterling served to
dramatize an issue of fundamen
tal and long-standing importance
to everyone at Stanford Univer
sity. Can Stanford University
become the community of schol
ars which it claims to be?
The events of the past week-

end have shown that we are far
from attaining this goal. The
lack of willingness to communi
cate on the part of the adminis
tration has never been as clear
ly evident than in the unilateral
decision to hold a draft test on
campus which raises serious
questions for all at the Univer
sity.
It has also been evident with
regard to the issues of social
regs, liquor and religion on
which the administration
evinced little or no desire to act
until the application of power
on the part of some other group
was imminent.
It is true that the committee
of fifteen, the revival of LASSU
as a meaningful decision-making
body, and student participation
on certain committees has im
proved the situation somewhat
in the past few years.
However the total unwilling
ness of the administration to
consult students and revise on
the question of the di'aft test
before and after the sit-in indi
cates that the basic problem
hasn't been solved.
The desire of the administra
tion to substitute power for dis
cussion in this instance raises
further questions — the stu
dents who sat in tried are about
to be tried for violation of the
fundamental standard.
In a genuine community, the
basic standard of conduct should
be applicable to all within it,
not just one segment of its pop
ulation. It is without a doubt
that the intransigence evidenced
by President Sterling hurt the
Stanford community at least as
much as the action taken and
persisted in by the students as a
result.
Who, however, is going to try
him for violation of a fundamen
tal standard?
If Stanford is ever to become
a community in any meaningful
sense, communication, rather
than power struggle must play
the major role in University de
cision-making.
In addition, any basic stand
ard of conduct which is adopted
should be made applicable to all.

• Art Of Persuasion
Editor, The
It seems to me that much of
the enlightened campus dialogue
regarding this country's involve

ment in Viet Nam is failing in
its intended goal of awakening
anti-war sentiment. One of the
most obvious and most easily
corrected reasons for the unper
suasiveness of this dialogue is
the stereotype "beatnik" image
which many of the activists
convey to the uninitiated pub
lic.
The long hair and sandals and
beards of many articulate stu
dents cannot help but subtract
from the overall appeal of their
arguments to an audience which
is generally unaccustomed to
looking beyond surface appear
ance. Moreover, the national
audience welcomes the oppor
tunity to stereotype the student
activist as "just another beard
ed mal content, probably a Com
munist, and maybe a homosex
ual." Stereotyping, though some
times helpful, in this case mere
ly relieves the public of the bur
densome task of critical evalua
tion, when critical evaluation is
just what the activists want to

promote.
The tendency to stereotype,
prevalent among the uneducated
and among some politicians, is
sad—even tragic. But, it is com
mon. To provide the undecided
citizen with such an effortless
escape from a confrontation
with the issue neither does jus
tice to the war, to the citizen,
nor to the Student Left.
Of course, most students feel
that personal freedom is the
basis of their protest. That in
cludes the freedom to dress ac
cording to individual choice.
Freedom seems to me to rank
second only to happiness in the
hierarchy of human values. To
voluntarily give up any freedom
is an act with grave political
and philosophical implications
and should by no means be done
lightly. However, a few people
are dedicated not only to living
in the world, but to making the
world a better place in which to
live. For these few the casual
exercise of every freedom may
be costly in terms of accom
plishment.
To understand that I am not
advocating conformity, the issue
of personal freedom must be
put into perspective. Now, if
sprinter Pat Morrison wants to
let his hair grow to an unusual
length, that's his business. He
isn't trying to convince anyone
to think, or by implication, to do
as he does. His hair is only his
business.
But, the political activists are
engaged in the art of persua
sion, and they are foolish if
they believe that their appeal
goes out to a purely logical pub
lic. The SCPV, it is true, is not
trying to set fashions in hair
style any more than Morrison,
but only the naive orator fails
to see the irrational association
between the content of speech
and the appearance of speaker.
The successful orator capitalizes
upon this fact.
To those who at this point re
mind me that the student move
ment is also a protest against
ignorance and irrationality, not
a concession to it, I ask that
they refer that reminder to the
student leaders, who conceive
their own role and the role of
the university as one of leader
ship. How can there be leader
ship without a following?
It is an imperfect world where
certain personal freedoms, like
the freedom to express oneself
through the choice of clothes or

hair style, must be inhibited in
order to further some other
freedoms, like the freedom to
compete equally for public senti
ment alongside the models of
middleclass values. Those lead
ers who recognize the necessity
of coming out of the philosophi
cal ivory tower to establish con
tact with a non-philosophical
world should see this compro
mise as the least of many evils.
Some, obviously, refuse to
make that compromise. It seems
to me that their unwillingness
to compromise sheds some light
on the sincerity of their com
mitment to the goal of peace in
Viet Nam.
RON GARRISON
• Conflicting Demands
Editor, The Daily:
A basic contradiction emerges
in two of the recent protest
movements here at Stanford.
The SSRF wishes the univer
sity to supply contraceptives to
anyone who wants them with
the idea that each student would
then be able to make his (her)
own moral decision. That's fine.
But now the most recent
group proposes exactly the op
posite: that the individual stu
dent should not be allowed by
his individual choice (whether
moral or otherwise) to take the
selective service draft test on
university proper. This same
group indicts the faculty as a
unit for not supporting students
in a (now) redefined cause of
student particiaption in decision
making. This is truly an inter
esting case, since the decision
to hold a draft test was hardly
made at Building 10.
More student involvement in
decision making is certainly
needed at Stanford, but the re
cent draft test is a pretty weak
issue to identify it wih.
PHIL ARNOLD
• October Days
Editor, The Daily:
In trying to see the current
student unrest - administration
intransigence difficulties from a
point of view somewhere be
yond the heat of the conflict,
I am struck by one overriding
concern: What methods are ap
propriate to the solution of prob
lems that arise within a com
munity of scholars and their
students?
It seems to me that the most
appropriate methods would be
those which are the hallmark of
any thinking community: reas
on, definition, articulation, and
dialogue. This must be the case
so long as all protagonists are
concerned with preserving the
"community."
The present situation at Stan
ford, from this point of view, is
pretty dismal. The student lead
ers prefer to posit these delicate
issues concerning government
university, war-university, draft
university in the streets. The ad
ministration prefers to ignore
the problem, to be consistently
absent.
As the scene becomes increas
ingly dichotomized, as the pro
tagonists at either extreme ac
celerate the process of detach
ment from one another, cutting
lines of rational communication,
throwing up impenetrable walls
of opaque verbiage of absolutely
no use if dialogue is really de
sider between the extremes, the
possibility of clearly raising and
effectively solving these prob
lems becomes impossible.
Rather than a community of
scholars and students, this scene
is more reminiscent of Petro
grad in the spring of 3917. So
far, the problem, clumsily de
fined even in the pamphlets and
fly-leaves of those who have
raised it, has been articulated
in the manner of peasant muni
tion workers, through slogans at
best, through shouting rallies in
the streets at worst.
And the problem has been
met by an administration unwill
ing to admit the gravity of the
situation, as yet unable to think
out the problem or to take ag
gressively positive measures to
assess the nature of the student
demands and to land on a pro
gram of action which will insure
that the university will not
have to depend on the delicacy
of crowds in White Plaza to
solve these involved and intri
cate issues.
The problem with the bread
riots in Petrograd in 1917 is not
that they were an ineffective
expression of workers' and peas
ants' extreme discontent, but
that they were able to express
only this negative sentiment in
the absence of other viable
channels of communication. And
the problem with the Russian
Provisional Government in 1917
is not that it was a bad govern
ment, but that it was no gov
ernment at all. What can we ex
pect from next October?

• 'If Its Pressed
Editor, The Daily:
Hooray for the emerging Stan
ford. Down with ambivalent dou
ble-standards, bumbling bureau
cracy, and the multiversity-in
dustrial-military behemoth. Since

the election of "artistic social
ist" Dave Harris, Stanford has
made radical progress in identi
fying and confronting the real
issues. First, that bastion of in
trigue, the Electrical Engineer
ing Department, was identified
as a cover, albeit in the open,
for the monstrous CIA. Tlien
came the revelation of the blood
thirsty anti-intelectuallism of
the ROTC. This week, finally,
we're getting to the basic issue,
elimination of the "parentis
pocis" routine with the need
made obvious by the Athletic De
partment. It should be readily
apparent that the length of one's
hair is a private matter and
doesn't even require the "mu
tual consent" of the SSRF.
Furthermore, this leads im
mediately to a more basic issue,
the rights of the Stanford Dollie.
The restrictions on "Quad
clothes," actual and imagined,
must be eliminated. What right
has the University to impose its
ideas of contemporary dress
when such regulations obviously
contribute nothing to intellectual
attainment. Each person should
be free, at least in a university,
to be comfortable, to experi
ment, and to investigate various
modes of thought and apparel.
To the comment that the dis
traction of the Stanford males
by bikini-clad or even topless
damsels would be destructive to
their intellectual endeavors, I
say that this is merely a chal
lenge to the teachers. If their
teaching is stimulating enough,
who need watch the girls. After
all, we're here for an education,
not an eyeful.
Besides, think of the health
benefits. What could be more
American than taking in a little
sun on the way to class. Why
the reduction of auto accidents
involving students rushing back
from northern beaches and bars
alone should make everyone
wish the immediate elimination
of this childish regulation!
In keeping with the campaign
a number of slogans have been
suggested. "If It's Pressed, Don't
Wear It." "Be Comfortable,
Stimulate a Professor." And of
course, you can make up your
own.
I urge one and all to take up
this issue because at the rate
we're going there won't be many
worthy issues left.

• Bad Influence
Editor, The Daily:
I agree with Terry Inch, class
of '61, (The Daily, May 23) that
it's highly unfortunate that only
40 percent of the student body
voted in the last election. How
ever, I feel sure that even if 100
percent had voted, Dave Harris
still would have won by a fair
margin.
To find the true reasons for
Dave's victory you will have to
look a little deeper than at just
the size of the electorate. You
will have to look at the forces
which led Stanford students to
vote for a rebel.
As a freshman I know that
one of the strongest influences
on my classmates is that of the
Wilbur Sponsors. I realize gen
eralizations are not always fair,
but the majority of the sponsors
I've met are radical, whether
outspoken like Dave or not.
What's more, because of admin
istration concessions, the Wil
bur Sponsors have remained a
self-perpetuating group; thus,
they will continue to impress
their radical ideas on freshmen.
This leads to the real ques
tion, who influences the spon
sors? More generally, who in
fluences Stanford students? Ob
viously the faculty, and many,
many members of the faculty
are radical. Again, I have to
speak from experience.
At the beginning of second
quarter, my mathematics class
was dismissed by Mr. Kowalski
because he refused to teach in
the ROTC building. Last Friday
I saw my first quarter English
TA, Mr. Addams, sitting on
President Sterling's window sill,
encouraging the anti-draft dem
onstrators,
Certainly these two examples
are extreme, but they suggest
what is often a more subtle radi
calism imposed on students by a
large section of the faculty. In
fact, I'm sure that many of the
"free thinkers" who voted for
Dave were merely reflecting
their instructors' ideas.
As an afterthought, contrary
to the recent article in Western
Politica, some intellectuals are
not liberal. If you want to see
a different kind of professor
molding (is there a better
word?) Stanford students, Mr.
Inch, it is your right and your
duty as a donating alumnus to
demand a change on The Farm,

• Development
Program
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to suggest that
the proposals of Dave Harris
et. al. be viewed as an attempted


"First, Premier Ky, you must learn the principles of democracy ..
community development pro
gram—an attempt at an altera
tion of the public culture of the
University with the intent of
transforming the way that the
members feel about themselves.
Cooperation and suggestions
in this attempt might focus
upon the evident need of increas
ing the opportunities of the
members of the community for
self-realization. This increased
opportunity should be available
to the students in their search
for life-models in a period of
transition, to the faculty in
their goal of transmitting the
excitement of intellecual discov
ery and of providing models of
another culture (subculture if
you will) and to the administra
tors in their role of providing
the resources and settings best
facilitating the attainment of
community goals.
The attempts to reformulate
student identity and to increase
the participation of students in
shaping a better order should
be recognized as legitimate ef
forts to deal with the frustra
tions of the present environ
ment. This normative position
rests ultimately on a personal
philosophy of education but
justification is offered in terms
of public goals and norms.
Present student frustrations
have their basis in the depart
mentalization of knowledge and
in the isolation of classroom
learning from personal develop
ment. (See Joseph Katz and
Nevitt Sanford for doubts on
this score.)
These are not by any means
the sole characteristics of uni
versity organization and opera

tion which contribute to the
process of turning excited, hope
ful freshmen into pragmatic,
other-directed, what-good-is-this
academic-crud upperclassmen.
What might lead one to ex
tend the participation hypothe
sis beyond the confines of the
psych lab to the larger commun
ity?
Dare we think that cultural
dynamics are not restricted to
primitive societies but operate
in the very Quad itself? Do we
recognize that the operation of
the present academic process
functions more to alert the sub
jects of the operations to the
idiosyncratic cues of high status
people — instilling a life-goal of
meeting environmental tests of
personal worth rather than to
invoke and inspire a search for
truth and a life-goal of self-ex
tending creativity?
If we can see past the wishful
thoughts and the socially ap
proved nice-things-to-say, per
haps we can recognize that a call
to a new identity is a legitimate
and reasonable response to exist
ing conditions.
But to be successful, "there
must be commitment to the
change, and others must accord
it recognition and do all the
things needed to reinforce and
consolidate it so that a sense of
new identity can actually be at
tained (Ward Goodenough, 1963,
p. 291.)

• A Dungeon ?
Editor, The Daily:
In response to Allan Christe
low's letter of May 20th, I be
lieve that Stanford is justified
in calling itself a university,

meaning that Stanford is at
least as much of a university as
Berkeley, Harvard, or Oxford.
Stanford may not measure up
to Mr. Christelows' "ideal"
standards, but then again, many
of us have different conceptions
of the ideal.
I do not feel that Stanford is
perfect, that Stanford should
be controlled Ry outside alumni
pressure, that students should
be made to conform to some
clean-cut image, or that ROTC
students should be coerced into
donating their blood. However,
simply because we have several
problems in the university, this
does not mean that Stanford is
leading American society "down
the road to infamy."
In previous years, Stanford
students have been active in civil
rights work, the Peace Corps,
the Ravenswood tutorial, num
erous work projects, Vista, and
assorted student political orga
nizations.
Mr. Christelow cannot fairly
argue that Stanford students are
apathetic and uncritical. Stu
dents do take an interest in the
"harsh reality of the outside
world," and they have made
honest attempts to improve it.
Some of the credit for motivat
ing student activity belongs to
Sanford University as it now
exists in its, admittedly, imper
fect form.
Stanford is not the stultify
ing dungeon that Mr. Christelow
describes, nor is it a factory for
the production of machine parts.
It has been used as a vantage
point from wihch students have
re-evaluated many aspects of
the "surrounding world."
Unfortunately, many students
often become frustrated, per
haps like Mr. Christelow, when
they realize that the really big
problem of our age—the possi
bility of world war and the wave
of revolution sweeping Africa,
Asia and South America — are
beyond student control and fre
quently beyond our still limited
understanding.

• Second-Rate School
Editor, The Daily:
Stanford University's 'leap to
greatness' would be better
termed 'stumbling mediocrity'.
The so-called 'Harvard of the
West' is guilty of the following
cardinal sins:
• Blatant religious discrimi
nation (for over seventy years):
for refusing (as recently as one
week ago) to let Jews hold ser
vices on campus other than in
a gaudy Christian church whose
symbology is offensive even to
many campus Christians.
• Obsequious kowtowing to
alumni criticism: for suspending
a Freshman athlete from the
track team because his hair was
too long and thus offended a
few well-heeled alumni.
• Giving academic credit for
soldier courses (ROTC), the aca
demic content of which has been
controversial at best.
• Having a sloppily cata
logued and even more sloppily
run main library. A first-class
library is the sine qua non of a
great university. There is no
question where that leaves Stan
ford.
Like some people, Stanford is
more concerned with its image
than with itself. Are not all of
these unmistakable signs of a
second-rate university?

•Arrive? Never!
Editor, The Dally:
The Freshman Daily (May 17)
was very interesting, but in
some ways disconcerting.
After reading about Wilbur,
Civ, the personal voice in En
glish and any number of other
editorials about how freshmen
look at things, two disturbing
comments stood out most in my
mind: first, that of the Roble
girl who said "I'd change no
thing . . . I'm crazy about every
aspect of this place," and even
more, the remarke from Art
Fisher's column entitled "Fresh
men: You Are Here—But When
Will You Arrive?" that "Kid,
you're just a little freshman and
you don't know what's happen
ing."
Despite the risk of sounding
like someone who is ready to
solve the world's problems at the
end of the freshman year, I
think that both these comments
miss one of the most vitally im
portant attitudes one can ever
hope to cultivate: that of con
sructive dissatisfaction.
No society, such as Stanford
University, is so good that every
aspect of it should remain un
changed; Mr. Fisher's article re
flects the same absence of con
structive dissatisfaction as the
freshman comment, but in a
much more serious way. I ques
tion whether the senior who
would say to a freshman or any
other student, silently or other
wise, that "Kid, you're just a
little freshman and don't know
what's happening'' doesn't have
a very good idea himself of the
changes he has undergone dur
ing his four years at Stanford.
"Freshmen: You Are Here—
But When Will You Arrive?" ex
horts Mr. Fisher. I don't want
to arrive, if that means that at
the end of my senior year, I'll
think that I realize all the im
plications of my college experi
ences. I'm glad to be a fresh
man, just as I'll be glad to be a
sophomore, junior, and senior.
Because for every mistake 1
make this year, there was some
thing learned about myself or
others that was so valuable that
I was glad to be wrong in the
learning, so long as I learned.
Mr. Fisher tells us freshmen
that when we are seniors, we
will have changed and when we
realize that, we "will have made
it." He says further that until
we have made this realization,
"It's all Frosh Week until then."
Does he mean that to imply that
when we are seniors, we will
know what it's all about?
I hope not, and I think not.
If my ideas are idealistic, they
do not ignore experience. If be
ing a freshman means a little
bungling through life and some
realizations of ignorance, I'm
glad to be a freshman. I'm hap
py to know that I still have a lot
to learn, and that I always will;
I'm happy to know that I'll
never arrive.

• Rewarding Seminar
Editor, The Daily:
Because the Freshman Semi
nar program (discussed in May
17's Freshman Edition of The
Daily) is made up of unique
groups of individuals studying
relatively unrelated topics, it is
practically impossible to make
general statements about the
program as a whole.
By taking part in one of these
groups ("Modern Ballads and
Their Backgrounds" with Profes
sor Claude Simpson), I enjoyed
a wide exchange of knowledge
injected with personal theories.
That is, I found a high level of
intra-group communication of
specialized educational value
which both illustrated back
ground research and opened wide
the gates for individual study.
I left the seminar with what
I feel is an enlightened curiosity,
a feeling of accomplishment and
potential, and a knowledge
which I have found both enjoy
able and practical. I consider
this participation in the Fresh
man Seminar program one of
my most rewarding experiences
at Stanford.

• Common Standards
Editor, The Daily:
So you received ten letters
backing the position of Pat Mor
rison, who refused to co-operate
with his track coach when asked
to have his lovely locks trimmed.
Well, here is one letter which
does not back either Pat or you.
To a grown man—it appears
as perfectly silly that such ac
tions are so important. Pat
must conform to some common
standards. He wears pants,
doesn't he?
I have had more friends who
never attended Stanford kid me
about the situation. They get
lots of laughs out of you "kids."
We Stanford alumni really take
a beating because of the child
ish antics of a very few stu
dents.
This is written in the thought
you might appreciate knowing
how most of we old timers feel.
Please, don't follow Berkeley's
example!
