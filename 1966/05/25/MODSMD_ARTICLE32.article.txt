# Leppert, Keating For Congress

/ tremble for my country when I reflect that
God is just.
Thomas Jefferson
We, too, tremble for our country as we view
the situation in Southeast Asia. And for mainly
that reason, The Daily is endorsing the candi
dacies of George Leppert and Edward Keating
in two Congressional races that are focusing
chiefly on American policy in Vietnam.
Keating, a resident of Atherton and editor
publisher of Ramparts, will face Johnson-liner
Mark Sullivan in the Democratic primary in the
11th Congressional District just to the north of
Stanford. Should he defeat Sullivan, Keating will
face septagenerian J. Arthur Younger, a hard
line conservative Republican, in the November
election.
Leppert, a Stanford professor of mechanical
engineering and long-time resident of Santa

Clara County, is unopposed for the 10th Con
gressional District nomination (the district in
cludes Stanford), but will face incumbent Re
publican Charles Gubser in the fall.
Both men have emphasized that they will en
courage all responsible efforts to end a vicious
war; both have said that the bombing of North
Vietnam must cease; both have called for nego
tiations with the National Liberation Front. In
short, both are endorsing a "reasonable opposi
tion" policy which would include de-escalation
of the war without unilateral withdrawal, and
an end to a foreign policy which militates
against the wishes of the peoples involved. A re
cent poll showed a majority of the Stanford stu
dent body favoring these same ends.
To elect such men to Congress would further
stimulate national debate over the war in Viet
nam, and would hasten a much-needed re-eval
uation of American foreign policy.
