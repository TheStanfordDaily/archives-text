# Big Daddy University And The Law

(Editor's Note: The following
is a condensed version of a
speech by Dr. William W. Van
Alstyne of the Duke University
Law faculty. Dr. Van Alstyne,
an active member of the AAUP
and the ACLU, is an authority
on the legal rights of students
and universities.)
The Collegiate Press Service
As courts have felt that they
would be mistaken to interfere
with the power of parents to
punish their children for playing
with matches, so they have felt
that they would be mistaken to
interfere with surrogate parents
—colleges and universities —
which deemed it wise to punish
their students for playing with
sex, tobacco, alcohol, politics,
race, or some other phenomenon
the responsible use of which
presumably required greater
maturity, experience, and wis
dom than feckless adolescents
possessed. . . .
The student has been regarded
as an infant, the college as an
extension of his parent whose
discretion is virtually unlimited,
and the legal rights of students
have been defined by contracts
which uniformly provide that
continued attendance at a col
lege or university is almost en
tirely a matter of sufferance or
privilege revocable at will and
without cause. . . . The heritage
of college law has stressed the
primary value of in loco paren
tis and the primary law of con
tract. . . .
No 'Age of Maturity'
It has been pointed out that
vast numbers of college stu
dents are of ages to which even
the traditional view of in loco
parentis has never applied in
law. . . . The law has never fixed
a uniform age of maturity in de
termining the dependence of a
person's actions upon the con
sent of his parents.
In most jurisdictions, one may
marry without his parents' con
sent by the age of 18. He may
secure a driver's license, take a
job, leave home, join political
bodies, associate with religious
assemblies, and pursue a variety
of other interests whether or not
his parents consent. Similarly,
he is often individually respon
sible under general law well be
fore he becomes 21. . . .
In short, even were colleges
presumed to absorb the power
of nonconsent of parents, we
would be obliged to recognize
that parental authority is not
unlimited even with respect to
teenagers.
But the principal failure of
the analogy is not a failure in
law. It is, rather, a failure in
function. I would suggest that
a university is not an automa
ton for the mechanical execu
tion of presumed parental de
sires. Indeed, if it is to merit
the dignity of being considered
a "university," it ought not de
termine either the necessity for
rules or the appropriateness of
not having certain rules simply
by trying to reflect the consen
sus of parental desires. . . .
Parental opinion respecting
non-academic matters such as
styles of dress, degrees of social
permissiveness, and the nature
of places which students choose
to attend ought not control uni
versity policy. A university is
not the extension of the parent
but an institution comitted to
ihe provision of educational op

portunities and the value of crit
ical inquiry.
Unless a rule can be shown
to be relevant to the conserva
tion of these concerns, it is ques
tionable whether the rule is
anything more than an act of
supererogation.
In short, the fact that a pro
posed rule might reflect or not
reflect parental will is unper
suasive either that the rule is
therefore right or wrong, or —
what is far more to the point
—that it is therefore relevant
or irrelevant to the college.
No Special Immunity
None of this is to assert, of
course, that the student absorbs
any special immunity from re
sponsibilities appropriately im
posed upon him elsewhere or by
others. . . . The student who
violates a valid law limiting sex
ual relations or regulating the
consumption of alcohol is not to
be preferred in court over a
non-student pursuing an identi
cal course of conduct.
The question is, however,
whether such persons should ad
ditionally have to answer to
their colleges. The answer in
each case depends, I believe, on
whether the student had sepa
rately offended some distinct
and independent interest of the
college as an academic enter
prise.
The question is not whether
he may have offended the in
terests of others, for a univer
sity is not properly the vassal
or agent or policemen of other
groups or associations who are

amply represented through
their own group influence and
through general legislation
equally applicable to all.
Inappropriate Formulation
It seems to me inappropriate,
therefore, for a college to for
mulate its standards purely and
simply to conform with an as
sumed consensus of the person
al and widely differing values
of parents. Correspondingly, it
seems to me to be doubtful that
it should attempt to justify its
authority over students on the
claim that it is acting as an
agent of the parents, in 1000
parentis.
The propriety of its rules is
based, rather, on the reasona
bleness of its independent judg
ment that its standards are es
sential to the protection of its
educational enterprise which
otherwise could not go forward.
There is, at heart, no one-to
one correlation either between
the powers of parents and the
powers of universities, nor the
legitimate interests of parents
and the legitimate interests of
universities. The rationale of in
loco parentis is neither a neces
sary nor sufficient justification
of college rules and collegiate
authority.
I would also suggest that we
and the courts have not been
fair in judging the proper scope
of university authority by cas
ual inspection of "contracts" of
matriculation, for these con
tracts lack nearly all of the es
sentials that entitle ordinary
contracts to respect as the best

basis for determining the legiti
mate prerogatives of the con
tracting parties. . . .
The appointment of rights and
powers by contract character
izes progressive societies, how
ever, only to the extent that in
dividuals possess a bargaining
power or the opportunity to ac
quire such power that their ne
gotiations with others may gen
erally operate under conditions
of equality. . . .
It is a rare student who is
properly advised of the rules he
"agrees" to observe before he
signs the "oontract" in which
he "consents" to those rules. . . .
Since handbooks typically con
tain an omnibus rule reserving
to the college the right to sus
pend or dismiss the student for
any reason satisfactory to the
college alone, the contract is
largely an illusory promise on
the part of the college.
More importantly, however, a
student is generally in no posi
tion to "bargain" with a college:
the contract he confronts is non
negotiable, and he lacks suffi
cient influence to determine its
terms. . . .
Under these circumstances, it
is really bordering on the i.ide
cent for colleges to chide stu
dents who oppose particular
rules by lecturing to them that
they freely accepted these rules
and ought not to have matricu
lated if they did not agree with
them.
In any case, these circum
stances do make clear why it is
that a college may not justify

the rules it maintains by the cir
cular persuasion that they are
precisely the rules to which the
students themselves subscribed
by contract.
Frank Reassessment
The legal reconciliation of stu
dent prerogatives and university
powers will involve, I believe, a
frank assessment of the dual
status of students and the dis
crete interests of universities.
I will acknowledge that those
who are sudents are simultane
ously individuals entertaining
an assortment of interests by no
means wholly of an academic
character.
It will recognize that t he s e
individuals may pursue their
non-academic interests subject
only to the same restraints as
society, peer groups, parents,
and others customarily attempt
to bring to bear through their
own separate connections with
individuals who offend them,
without gratuitous university
support.
It will also recognize that col
leges are primarily places of ed
ucational advancement, and not
the arbiters of general stand
ards. When the student defaults
on reasonable minimum educa
tional opportunities of others, he
may be disciplined by the in
stitutions whose busienss it is
to conserve and to administer
these things. . . .
Recognition will obtain, in
short, that a college is not a
surrogate parent, a surrogate
state, a surrogate draft board,
or a surrogate anything else.
