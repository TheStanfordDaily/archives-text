## Reflections On A Weekend Protest 
### Mike Couzens 
"You carry out a certain power that
has been delegated down to you step by
step, directed at us who had everything
to lose . . . whose only power was our
presence in this room."
Keith Lowe's voice was firm and meas
ured. Addressing these words to admin
istrators, he was explaining to the crowd
outside Building 10 why he and 26 others
had decided to leave.
"We had to persuade ourselves to
stand up against attrition under the
gun." Why did they "persuade them
selves?" And were their goals realized?
Levels of Debate
Debate within the group Friday and
Saturday took place on several levels.
No one spoke for anyone else until Keith
Lowe was selected to write their final
statement.
On a tactical level, discussion ranged
from departure to hunger strikes and a
call for support at other universities.
Someone inside arranged for the false
rumor at Paul Goodman's lecture on
Friday that the administrators were
ready to forcefully drag people from the
office. As the audience rushed over to
reassemble under the arches, they were
announced as a sudden expression of
support. Flagging spirits rose and talk
of leaving that night ended.
On an "issue" level, everything related
back, not to the draft, but to university
decision-making.
The Banic Goal
Said Barry Greenberg, a graduate stu
dent in political science, "The basic con
cern of most if not all of the students
who have sat in Is to gain for students
the right to participate in University

decisions which ultimately affect their
lives. That is the basic goal. It has be
come articulated over the past three days
rather than changed.
"There are targets—issues—which re
late to this question. We have lost on
the target, and we lost to an intransi
gent, unreasonable coercive power."
Bob Hass echoed this: "The primary
issue for me, although I'm appalled by
the discriminatory nature of Selective
Service, is decision making in the Uni
versity."
He felt the only way to express a stu
dent view effectively was "direct action.
I wasn't convinced of that when I came
in here, but I am now, because it's my
distinct impression that many of the
men I spoke with were well-meaning
and cowardly."
In AgTeeiment
Each member would emphasize that
he spoke for himself, but if there was
broad disagreement, it was never ex
pressed. Ira Arlook: "We've rarely had
to take votes as such. There isn't very
much disagreement. The final decision
we talked out until everyone said what
he had to say, and ended in basic agree
ment."
Discussion shifted from Thursday to
Saturday away from the draft and
toward students' role in the University.
This may be explained in two ways.
First, the draft exam took place on
schedule. The protesters' only action was
to organize picketers Friday night for
the next morning. As Lowe's statement
explained, they lost on that issue. He
was trying to turn a specific defeat into
a general victory. But it is unfair to dis

miss their argument on these grounds.
Concern with the broader issue was with
them from the beginning.
No Response
The second reason was their frustra
tion in attempts to gain a response from
the system over three days of protest.
Said English TA Igor Webb, "The
most shocking thing for me ... is the
complete lack of real response on the
part of the faculty. When it became
clear that we had reached an impasse
with President Sterling, we appealed to
the faculty, specifically the Executive
Committee of the Academic Council, to
intercede ...
"Although they expressed sympathy
with our position, they refused to com
mit themselves, personally or profes
sionally, to work toward a meeting.
"We saw very few members of the
faculty, and none were willing to sup
port us in our demands to the President.
This seems to me appalling."
This position shows an impatience
which, though often justified, leads to
misunderstanding. They were expecting
immediate action from people who, simi
larly, were "under the gun."
System Guilty Too
But to the extent that they failed or
refused to understand the system, the
system is equally guilty of having failed
to understand them.
While students are concerned about
educational issues, these issues are not
inflammatory enough to motivate dra
matic action.
The sit-in came close, by expressing
disappointment in the University which
refused to deal with them on more ordi

nary terms. To lose this complaint in
argument over Selective Service will do
the protesters a disservice now and the
University a disservice in the long run.
Above it all, the demonstrators are to
be commended for having pointed to a
crucial issue. The President is too iso
lated, with a buffer-staff, like Cerberus,
to guard the gate. Decisions are all too
often faits accompli*. And the faculty is
all too often mute.
Hopefully, the Subcommittee of the
Committee of Fifteen which is consider
ing the role of students on University
committees will recognize the depth of
feelitig manifest last weekend.
Concern and Responsibility
Hopefully, too, the community in gen
eral will not react to "challenges to their
authority," but will recognize this type
of action as part of a concern which
carries with it responsibility many stu
dents are prepared to take.
Dave Harris, who was a negotiator
through the week end, gave this inter
pretation Saturday afternoon:
"I think that those people who are
leaving now have demonstrated over the
past three day\s and are demonstrating
at the present moment, by their willing
ness to leave despite administrative in
transigence and faculty irresponsibility,
their concern for building a healthy aca
demic community to replace the one that
both they and I feel is considerably ail
ing.
"The question that remains in my
mind is whether President Sterling and
the faculty are willing and capable of
showing as much good will and concern."
"You carry out a certain power that
has been delegated down to you step by
step, directed at us who had everything
to lose . . . whose only power was our

schedule. The protesters' only action was
to organize picketers Friday night for
the next morning. As Lowe's statement
explained, they lost on that issue. He
was trying to turn a specific defeat into
a general victory. But it is unfair to dis

miss their argument on these grounds.
Concern with the broader issue was with
them from the beginning.
No Response
The second reason was their frustra
tion in attempts to gain a response from
the system over three days of protest.
Said English TA Igor Webb, "The
most shocking thing for me ... is the
complete lack of real response on the
part of the faculty. When it became
clear that we had reached an impasse
with President Sterling, we appealed to
the faculty, specifically the Executive
Committee of the Academic Council, to
intercede ...
"Although they expressed sympathy
with our position, they refused to com
mit themselves, personally or profes
sionally, to work toward a meeting.
"We saw very few members of the
faculty, and none were willing to sup
port us in our demands to the President.
This seems to me appalling."
This position shows an impatience
which, though often justified, leads to
misunderstanding. They were expecting
immediate action from people who, simi
larly, were "under the gun."
System Guilty Too
But to the extent that they failed or
refused to understand the system, the
system is equally guilty of having failed
to understand them.
While students are concerned about
educational issues, these issues are not
inflammatory enough to motivate dra
matic action.
The sit-in came close, by expressing
disappointment in the University which
refused to deal with them on more ordi

nary terms. To lose this complaint in
argument over Selective Service will do
the protesters a disservice now and the
University a disservice in the long run.
Above it all, the demonstrators are to
be commended for having pointed to a
crucial issue. The President is too iso
lated, with a buffer-staff, like Cerberus,
to guard the gate. Decisions are all too
often faits accompli*. And the faculty is
all too often mute.
Hopefully, the Subcommittee of the
Committee of Fifteen which is consider
ing the role of students on University
committees will recognize the depth of
feelitig manifest last weekend.
Concern and Responsibility
Hopefully, too, the community in gen
eral will not react to "challenges to their
authority," but will recognize this type
of action as part of a concern which
carries with it responsibility many stu
dents are prepared to take.
Dave Harris, who was a negotiator
through the week end, gave this inter
pretation Saturday afternoon:
"I think that those people who are
leaving now have demonstrated over the
past three day\s and are demonstrating
at the present moment, by their willing
ness to leave despite administrative in
transigence and faculty irresponsibility,
their concern for building a healthy aca
demic community to replace the one that
both they and I feel is considerably ail
ing.
"The question that remains in my
mind is whether President Sterling and
the faculty are willing and capable of
showing as much good will and concern."
"You carry out a certain power that
has been delegated down to you step by
step, directed at us who had everything
to lose . . . whose only power was our
presence in this room."
Keith Lowe's voice was firm and meas
ured. Addressing these words to admin
istrators, he was explaining to the crowd
outside Building 10 why he and 26 others
had decided to leave.
"We had to persuade ourselves to
stand up against attrition under the
gun." Why did they "persuade them
selves?" And were their goals realized?
Levels of Debate
Debate within the group Friday and
Saturday took place on several levels.
No one spoke for anyone else until Keith
Lowe was selected to write their final
statement.
On a tactical level, discussion ranged
from departure to hunger strikes and a
call for support at other universities.
Someone inside arranged for the false
rumor at Paul Goodman's lecture on
Friday that the administrators were
ready to forcefully drag people from the
office. As the audience rushed over to
reassemble under the arches, they were
announced as a sudden expression of
support. Flagging spirits rose and talk
of leaving that night ended.
On an "issue" level, everything related
back, not to the draft, but to university
decision-making.
The Banic Goal
Said Barry Greenberg, a graduate stu
dent in political science, "The basic con
cern of most if not all of the students
who have sat in Is to gain for students
the right to participate in University

decisions which ultimately affect their
lives. That is the basic goal. It has be
come articulated over the past three days
rather than changed.
"There are targets—issues—which re
late to this question. We have lost on
the target, and we lost to an intransi
gent, unreasonable coercive power."
Bob Hass echoed this: "The primary
issue for me, although I'm appalled by
the discriminatory nature of Selective
Service, is decision making in the Uni
versity."
He felt the only way to express a stu
dent view effectively was "direct action.
I wasn't convinced of that when I came
in here, but I am now, because it's my
distinct impression that many of the
men I spoke with were well-meaning
and cowardly."
In AgTeeiment
Each member would emphasize that
he spoke for himself, but if there was
broad disagreement, it was never ex
pressed. Ira Arlook: "We've rarely had
to take votes as such. There isn't very
much disagreement. The final decision
we talked out until everyone said what
he had to say, and ended in basic agree
ment."
Discussion shifted from Thursday to
Saturday away from the draft and
toward students' role in the University.

their concern for building a healthy aca
demic community to replace the one that
both they and I feel is considerably ail
ing.
"The question that remains in my
mind is whether President Sterling and
the faculty are willing and capable of
showing as much good will and concern."
"You carry out a certain power that
has been delegated down to you step by
step, directed at us who had everything
to lose . . . whose only power was our
presence in this room."
Keith Lowe's voice was firm and meas
ured. Addressing these words to admin
istrators, he was explaining to the crowd
outside Building 10 why he and 26 others
had decided to leave.
"We had to persuade ourselves to
stand up against attrition under the
gun." Why did they "persuade them
selves?" And were their goals realized?
Levels of Debate
Debate within the group Friday and
Saturday took place on several levels.
No one spoke for anyone else until Keith
Lowe was selected to write their final
statement.
On a tactical level, discussion ranged
from departure to hunger strikes and a
call for support at other universities.
Someone inside arranged for the false
rumor at Paul Goodman's lecture on
Friday that the administrators were
ready to forcefully drag people from the
office. As the audience rushed over to
reassemble under the arches, they were
announced as a sudden expression of
support. Flagging spirits rose and talk
of leaving that night ended.
On an "issue" level, everything related
back, not to the draft, but to university
decision-making.
The Banic Goal
Said Barry Greenberg, a graduate stu
dent in political science, "The basic con
cern of most if not all of the students
who have sat in Is to gain for students
the right to participate in University

decisions which ultimately affect their
lives. That is the basic goal. It has be
come articulated over the past three days
rather than changed.
"There are targets—issues—which re
late to this question. We have lost on
the target, and we lost to an intransi
gent, unreasonable coercive power."
Bob Hass echoed this: "The primary
issue for me, although I'm appalled by
the discriminatory nature of Selective
Service, is decision making in the Uni
versity."
He felt the only way to express a stu
dent view effectively was "direct action.
I wasn't convinced of that when I came
in here, but I am now, because it's my
distinct impression that many of the
men I spoke with were well-meaning
and cowardly."
In AgTeeiment
Each member would emphasize that
he spoke for himself, but if there was
broad disagreement, it was never ex
pressed. Ira Arlook: "We've rarely had
to take votes as such. There isn't very
much disagreement. The final decision
we talked out until everyone said what
he had to say, and ended in basic agree
ment."
Discussion shifted from Thursday to
Saturday away from the draft and
toward students' role in the University.
This may be explained in two ways.
First, the draft exam took place on
schedule. The protesters' only action was
to organize picketers Friday night for
the next morning. As Lowe's statement
explained, they lost on that issue. He
was trying to turn a specific defeat into
a general victory. But it is unfair to dis

miss their argument on these grounds.
Concern with the broader issue was with
them from the beginning.
No Response
The second reason was their frustra
tion in attempts to gain a response from
the system over three days of protest.
Said English TA Igor Webb, "The
most shocking thing for me ... is the
complete lack of real response on the
part of the faculty. When it became
clear that we had reached an impasse
with President Sterling, we appealed to
the faculty, specifically the Executive
Committee of the Academic Council, to
intercede ...
"Although they expressed sympathy
with our position, they refused to com
mit themselves, personally or profes
sionally, to work toward a meeting.
"We saw very few members of the
faculty, and none were willing to sup
port us in our demands to the President.
This seems to me appalling."
This position shows an impatience
which, though often justified, leads to
misunderstanding. They were expecting
immediate action from people who, simi
larly, were "under the gun."
System Guilty Too
But to the extent that they failed or
refused to understand the system, the
system is equally guilty of having failed
to understand them.
While students are concerned about
educational issues, these issues are not
inflammatory enough to motivate dra
matic action.
The sit-in came close, by expressing
disappointment in the University which
refused to deal with them on more ordi

nary terms. To lose this complaint in
argument over Selective Service will do
the protesters a disservice now and the
University a disservice in the long run.
Above it all, the demonstrators are to
be commended for having pointed to a
crucial issue. The President is too iso
lated, with a buffer-staff, like Cerberus,
to guard the gate. Decisions are all too
often faits accompli*. And the faculty is
all too often mute.
Hopefully, the Subcommittee of the
Committee of Fifteen which is consider
ing the role of students on University
committees will recognize the depth of
feelitig manifest last weekend.
Concern and Responsibility
Hopefully, too, the community in gen
eral will not react to "challenges to their
authority," but will recognize this type
of action as part of a concern which
carries with it responsibility many stu
dents are prepared to take.
Dave Harris, who was a negotiator
through the week end, gave this inter
pretation Saturday afternoon:
"I think that those people who are
leaving now have demonstrated over the
past three day\s and are demonstrating
at the present moment, by their willing
ness to leave despite administrative in
transigence and faculty irresponsibility,
their concern for building a healthy aca
demic community to replace the one that
both they and I feel is considerably ail
ing.
"The question that remains in my
mind is whether President Sterling and
the faculty are willing and capable of
showing as much good will and concern."
