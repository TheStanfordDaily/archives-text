# 4000 PROFS POLLED
## Cal Ranks First For Grad Study 
### DICK LIVINGSTON 
The Univereity of California at
Berkeley is "the best balanced distin
guished university in the country,"
according to a study of graduate edu
cation by Allan Cartter of the Ameri
can Council on Education. Harvard
and Stanford were ranked second and
third respectively.
The report, which has been two
years in preparation, is based on a
poll of more than 4,000 university de
partment chairmen and professors.
They were asked questions about the
scholarly reputations of departments
in 106 universities and the effective
ness of their Ph.D. programs.
UC
Berkeley appears in the leading
group in all five general subject
areas: humanities, social sciences, bio
logical sciences, physical sciences and
engineering.
Harvard and Stanford appear in
four divisions; Columbia, Illinois,
Yale, Princeton, Michigan and Cal
Tech in three, and MIT, Chicago and
Wisconsin in two.
Stanford was ranked first in over
all effectiveness in psychology and
electrical engineering. Faculty quality
was rated second i"n both cases. The
University placed third in biochemis
try, zoology, physios, civil engineering
and mechanical engineering.

If engineering had been omitted
from the survey, Harvard would have
emerged as first, the report said. Har
vard was rated weaker than most top
schools in engineering.
Dr. Cartter declined to name the
"top ten" graduate schools. "Univer
sities do not make commitments in
all fields," he said. "They should not
be judged on simple averages of their
departmental ratings.
"Many of the universities do not
offer work in all the fields under re
view. It seems unreasonable to penal
ize an instittuion for not having an
engineering school, classics depart
ment or doctoral program in astrono
my."
Need For Evaluation
The study came about, Dr. Cartter
wrote, because of the demand for"
better information on graduate and
professional education" and because
"university presidents and department
chairmen could benefit substantially
from having such assessments made
available periodically, even if the re
sults were not always flattering."
Cartter wrote that great diversity
exists among graduate schools. "In
undergraduate education our system
works fairly well because most stu
dents, parents and prospective em

ployers know that a bachelor's de
gree from Harvard, Stanford, Swarth
more or Reed is ordinarily better than
a degree from Melrose A and M or
Siwash College."
Such knowledge was not available
regarding graduate study, according
to the report. "Too much reliance was
being placed upon earlier and now
outdated studies, which had surveyed
only a limited number of universi
ties."
Subjective Perils
Rating by subjective judgment has
its perils, Cartter noted. But he re
ports only one scholar rated his own
department as "distinguished" and all
others "inadequate."

Some major differences between
overall programs and faculty quality
were reported. Stanford's physics
faculty rates fifth, but the graduate
program was judged third.
In an intensive study of economics
departments, Cartter found that the
"publish or perish" philosophy pre
vails only among the best depart
ments.
General Conclusions
The report reaches the following
general conclusions:
There is a close relationship be
tween faculty salaries and the quality
of graduate faculty. Universities re
ceiving the highest overall ratings for
high caliber faculty have an average
salary of $14,000. At the lowest rank
ing instittuions it was $9,500.
Institutions that are strong in all
areas invariably have major national
research libraries.
Distinguished graduate depart
ments are concentrated in 13 states
in the northeast and in California. No
southeastern, Rocky Mountain or
northwestern universities had a dis
tinguished department.
Cartter also challenged the notion
that the country faces a serious short
age of college professors. He noted
that more than 200 institutions now
grant the doctorate, turning out more
han 16,000 Ph.Ds a year.

The report, which has been two
years in preparation, is based on a
poll of more than 4,000 university de
partment chairmen and professors.
They were asked questions about the
scholarly reputations of departments
in 106 universities and the effective
ness of their Ph.D. programs.
UC
Berkeley appears in the leading
group in all five general subject
areas: humanities, social sciences, bio
logical sciences, physical sciences and
engineering.
Harvard and Stanford appear in
four divisions; Columbia, Illinois,
Yale, Princeton, Michigan and Cal
Tech in three, and MIT, Chicago and
Wisconsin in two.
Stanford was ranked first in over
all effectiveness in psychology and
electrical engineering. Faculty quality
was rated second i"n both cases. The
University placed third in biochemis
try, zoology, physios, civil engineering
and mechanical engineering.

If engineering had been omitted
from the survey, Harvard would have
emerged as first, the report said. Har
vard was rated weaker than most top
schools in engineering.
Dr. Cartter declined to name the
"top ten" graduate schools. "Univer
sities do not make commitments in
all fields," he said. "They should not
be judged on simple averages of their
departmental ratings.
"Many of the universities do not
offer work in all the fields under re
view. It seems unreasonable to penal
ize an instittuion for not having an
engineering school, classics depart
ment or doctoral program in astrono
my."
Need For Evaluation
The study came about, Dr. Cartter
wrote, because of the demand for"
better information on graduate and
professional education" and because
"university presidents and department
chairmen could benefit substantially
from having such assessments made
available periodically, even if the re
sults were not always flattering."
Cartter wrote that great diversity
exists among graduate schools. "In
undergraduate education our system
works fairly well because most stu
dents, parents and prospective em

ployers know that a bachelor's de
gree from Harvard, Stanford, Swarth
more or Reed is ordinarily better than
a degree from Melrose A and M or
Siwash College."
Such knowledge was not available
regarding graduate study, according
to the report. "Too much reliance was
being placed upon earlier and now
outdated studies, which had surveyed
only a limited number of universi
ties."
Subjective Perils
Rating by subjective judgment has
its perils, Cartter noted. But he re
ports only one scholar rated his own
department as "distinguished" and all
others "inadequate."

Some major differences between
overall programs and faculty quality
were reported. Stanford's physics
faculty rates fifth, but the graduate
program was judged third.
In an intensive study of economics
departments, Cartter found that the
"publish or perish" philosophy pre
vails only among the best depart
ments.
General Conclusions
The report reaches the following
general conclusions:
There is a close relationship be
tween faculty salaries and the quality
of graduate faculty. Universities re
ceiving the highest overall ratings for
high caliber faculty have an average
salary of $14,000. At the lowest rank
ing instittuions it was $9,500.
Institutions that are strong in all
areas invariably have major national
research libraries.
Distinguished graduate depart
ments are concentrated in 13 states
in the northeast and in California. No
southeastern, Rocky Mountain or
northwestern universities had a dis
tinguished department.
Cartter also challenged the notion
that the country faces a serious short
age of college professors. He noted
that more than 200 institutions now
grant the doctorate, turning out more
han 16,000 Ph.Ds a year.
The Univereity of California at
Berkeley is "the best balanced distin
guished university in the country,"
according to a study of graduate edu
cation by Allan Cartter of the Ameri
can Council on Education. Harvard
and Stanford were ranked second and
third respectively.
