# Judicial Council Considers Sit-Ins
## 
### ERIC MILLER 
Protesters who violated University
policy by demonstrating in President
Sterling's office last week-end will go
before Judicial Council tomorrow.
The Council has decided to hear
only the protesters who, by their
physical presence in the office, vio
lated the rule after Dean Robert
Wert's public interpretation of policy
at 11:45 a.m. Friday.
At that time, Building 10 was
closed so that no additional demon
strators could enter.
Thirty-three protesters have been
charged with infraction of rules con
cerning demonstrations which disrupt
University business.
Noon Bally
At present, 32 others have signed
a petition asking that they be tried
on the ground that hey would have
been in the building if it had not
been closed without warning.
They had presumably left the room
momentarily when Wert made his an
nouncement and had police bar the
door.
Administrators, faculty and stu
dents were invited yesterday to ap
pear at a rally this noon to discuss
the issues of Selective Service and
students' role in decision making.
President Sterling, Dean Wert, and
Dean Winbigler declined specific in
vitations to speak.
According to the Executive Assist
ant to the President, Sterling "con
sidered it inappropriate for him to
comment on a situation now under
review by the Executive Committee of
the Academic Council."
Winbigler made a similar statement.
The three administrators all have
other commitments for noon today.
Debate Form
The Executive Committee of the
Academic Council is sending a state
ment to be read by one of its mem
bers.
Carl Anderson will represent a
group of students which opposes the
demonstrations of last week-end, and
Larry Friedlander of the English De
partment has also asked to speak.
Speeches will be presented in the
form of a debate, according to Keith
Lowe, who participated in the demon
stration. He said that anyone who
wishes to get in line may talk, within
time liimitations.
