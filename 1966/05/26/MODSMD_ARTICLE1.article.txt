# Stanford Growth: How Much, How Soon?

"Leland Stanford Junior Multiversity"—is
it possible? Just how extensive are plans for
future University growth, and in what direc
tion is such extension headed?
Last January President Sterling stated the
problem in the annual "Stanford Today and
Tomorrow" convocation, emphasizing the need
for study of the undergraduate program and
examination of growth at the graduate level
in recent years.
Several aspects of these problems were
raised in recent interviews with Dr. Robert J.
Wert, dean of undergraduate education; Dr.
Virgil K. Whitaker, dean of the graduate di
vision; Dr. Ernest Hilgard, head of the com
mittee of re-evaluation of undergraduate edu
cation; and Dr. H. Donald Winbigler, dean of
students.
Limited Growth
At present, there is no prediction of growth
in enrollment to the extent that the nature
of the University would be changed drastically.
Dean Winbigler pointed out that there are al
most the same number of undergraduates now
as 20 years ago, and that "undergraduate!
growth has been primarily limited to the
growth of overseas campuses."

Dean Wert suggested that the time has
come for a closer look at undergraduate ex
pansion, since most growth in the past few
years has occurred at the graduate level. Wert
pointed out such dangers in expansion as un
controlled growth, a loss of direction, loss of
principle and the restriction of "too rigid a
system in an era of change."
Wert suggested that there is no "disposition
to change" the "maximum undergraduate en
rollment of 6,000" and that many of the prob
lems of the undergraduate program may be
cured through a re-evaluation of the General
Studies program.
Another view of the graduate-undergraduate
conflict comes from Dan Winbigler, who stated
the problem in terms of a "national obligation
at the graduate level." He said that any sub
stantial expansion in the undergraduate en
rollment would not contribute much to the na
tional problem of the undergraduate "popula
tion explosion."
How Big - ?
"What is the real size of the University?"
is an important question in determining the
direction of growth. "The count of 11,0(30
doesn't include everybody," said Professor Hil

gard. There are postgraduate fellows, medi
cal school residents, and a host of others not
included in the usual count using the "non
academic" facilities of the University.
Hilgard said that the big fear is that of
reaching a "step function." He explained this
term by the fact that growth "is not noticed
up to a certain point." However, after that
point has been passed, a sudden expansion in
physical facilities might be required. "Such
non-academic facilities as the bookstore and
Tresidder Union are operating at almost a
maximum capacity at the present time; an ad
dition of even 1,000 students would require
almost a totally new expansion," he said.
Another problem arising with expansion is
that of allocation of faculty members' time
among graduate and undergraduate students.
Would separate faculties for graduate and un
dergraduate division proivde the solution?
Separate Faculties
Hilgard claims that separate faculties are
"usually not successful," and that most profes
sors like to teach both graduate and under
graduates. Separate faculty programs were
tried at Yale and the University of Chicago,

but both failed. Columbia University separates
the undergraduate (Columbia College, men;
Barnard College, women) completely. "For
Stanford such a system would change its
character," said Hilgard.
Dean Wert argues that a great faculty in
crease would "probably not have enough ef
fect on undergraduate programs," but that
the time allocation problem should receive
more study.
'Supply And Demand'
In contrast, Dean Whitaker states the fac
ulty problem in "supply and demand" terms,
suggesting that an increase in undergraduate
enrollment would require departments to in
crease their capacities through an expansion
of faculty. In turn, this would provide room
for more graduate students.
Whitaker also suggests that the level of
graduate growth cannot be stated simply in
numbers. He pointed out that the number of
graduate students has risen and remained
stable in recent years, due to the longer
amount of time spent by Ph.D. candidates in
their areas of study.
"Our attrition has still been too high," he
said, referring to those not completing grad

uate programs. Whitaker suggested that the
graduate programs would bo more effective
through more selective admissions procedures
which would tend to reject possible graduate
"drop-outs."
1:1 Ratio
The present ratio of grad to undergrad
students being approximately 1:1, Hilgard
pointed out that continued graduate growth,
such as that planned by the Business School
expansion, may disrupt this balance. How
ever, control of the graduate population is not
directly controlled by the administration, as
is the undergraduate population, since the de
partments set their own quotas for graduate
enrollment.
The primary question concerning growth
now seems not to be how much, as officials
agree that the enrollment is to be "controlled"
not to greatly exceed its present level, but
rather in what dir«xrtion. Studies of undergrad
uate education, improvement in graduate
school selection processes, and efforts to bal
ance resources allocated among graduate and
undergraduate students all indicate a type
of growth and development which will keep
the University unified.
