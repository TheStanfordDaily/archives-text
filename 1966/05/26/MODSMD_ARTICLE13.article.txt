# Campus Poor Unite For Poverty Comm
## 
### PETE KNIGHT 
Broke? Your problem may be
poverty. If the poor of Stanford
unite, they can elect a represen
tative to the local poverty com
mission. But they must act
quickly, i.e. before June 15.
Poverty is a statistical fact of
life on the Stanford campus.
According to the Santa Clara
County Economic Opportunity
Commission, 20 per cent of the
families at Stanford, including
College Terrace are poor. Since
poverty has been defined for
families as $4000 or less total
gross family income annually
plus $500 per dependent above
four, and for single individuals
above the age of 18 as $3,000 or
less total annual income, Stan
ford and College Terrace consti
tute, in the eyes of officialdom,
a pocket of poverty.
Elect Representative
While some struggling grad
uate students and their wives
might agree with the definition,
the majority of students are in
clined to laugh at the blindness
of the statisticians and chalk up
one more boondoggle to the
bureaucrats of the poverty pro
gram. On second thought the
fact that the "poor" of Stanford
and College Terrace are entitled
to elect a low income representa
tive to sit on the Council of the
Area 9 (Palo Alto and Mountain
View) Economic Opportunity
Commission presents an oppor
tunity for meaningful service to

the community in which Stan
ford happens to be located.
Shape Programs
For, though the poverty of
Stanford students may be tem
porary or a statistical artifact,
their legal right to elect a rep
resentative to sit in the councils
of the poor means that an intel
ligent person with no vested in
terests in the the presently exist
ing welfare, educational, or so
cial establishment will be able
to help shape the programs into
which Federal money will flow
to combat the very real prob
lems of poverty found in Moun
tain View.
Such a student would also
have an excellent opportunity to
observe the workings of the War
on Poverty at the grass roots
level, with all its hopes, jeal
ousies, ambitions, conflicts, and
problems of apathy. He would
be able to see at first hand the
strengths and weaknesses of the
organizations which are being
set up and hopefully to use the
knowledge he acquires to the
benefit of society in the future.
June 15 Election
But if the Stanford commun
ity wishes to grasp this oppor
tunity, it must act quickly, for
the elections must be held by
June 15. To hold an election, at
least 30 of the "poor" must sign
vouchers certifying that they
meet the income requirements
cited above.
Anyone interested in running
for low income representative of
Sub-Area 1, Area 9 (Stanford
including Escondido Village and
College Terrace) of Santa Clara
County or able to help in can
vassing either here or in down
town Palo Alto (Sub-Area 2)
is urged to call Tracy Wright,
Area 9 Community Development
Specialist, at 961-6721 in Moun
tain View.
Mr. Wright's office is located
in Room 9 of the Adlai Steven
son School, 750 San Pierre Way,
Mountain View, and he would be
happy to discuss the program
with any interested persons.
