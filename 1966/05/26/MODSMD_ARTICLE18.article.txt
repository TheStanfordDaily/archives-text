## Student Addicts Tell Court Story Of Their Drug Habits 
### 
(CPS)—Two hooded students
set the cloak-and-dagger tone for
testimony last week as the Penn
sylvania legislature began a
promised investigation of the
use of drugs on Pennsylvania
college campuses.
The students, their faces cov
ered with blue hoods to prevent
identification, told the investi
gating committee of their in
volvement with narcotics. They
described in detail their experi
ences as they were introduced to
drug use on their college cam
puses.
The first student, identified

only as John, told the committee
he began to use marijuana as a
freshman at one of the Philadel
phia universities.
"I began in 1958 and I was
spending about $15 a week for
it. I used it for the feeling it
gave me, and it was that feel
ing that became a crutch," John
said.
He said the feeling he got was
different from drinking because
he never got sick after using
marijuana, but "afterwards al
ways felt like having a good
time."
Attempts by committee chair
man Benjamin R. Donolow (R-
Phila.) to have John identify
which of the two Philadephia
area universities (Temple or the
University of Pennsylvania) he
had attended failed.
The five-member joint legisla
tive panel and about 50 peo
ple who attended the open hear
ing heard a second student, iden
tified only as Robert.
Robert told the committee he
began taking excessive amounts

of cough syrup when he was 15.
He would not identify his school
either but told a story similar in
detail to that related earlier by
John.
From cough syrup he began
taking "amphetamines and bar
biturates every day." The drugs
made him "feel fine," he said,
and he took a part-time job as
a caddy to finance the $5 he was
spending each day to get his
supply.
Robert first came to the at
tention of the police when he
was arrested on a homosexual
charge. He said he had turned to
homosexual activity to finance
the growing cost of his drugs.
He was making $15 to $20 a
night, he said, and all of that
went for drugs.
The committee has not said
how long the investigation might
last nor indicated what it will
do, if anything, with the infor
mation it collects. It does plan,
however, to conduct hearings at
various universities and colleges
around the state.

various universities and colleges
around the state.
(CPS)—Two hooded students
set the cloak-and-dagger tone for
testimony last week as the Penn
sylvania legislature began a
promised investigation of the
use of drugs on Pennsylvania
college campuses.
The students, their faces cov
ered with blue hoods to prevent
identification, told the investi
gating committee of their in
volvement with narcotics. They
described in detail their experi
ences as they were introduced to
drug use on their college cam
puses.
The first student, identified

only as John, told the committee
he began to use marijuana as a
freshman at one of the Philadel
phia universities.
"I began in 1958 and I was
spending about $15 a week for
it. I used it for the feeling it
gave me, and it was that feel
ing that became a crutch," John
said.
He said the feeling he got was
different from drinking because
he never got sick after using
marijuana, but "afterwards al
ways felt like having a good
time."
Attempts by committee chair
man Benjamin R. Donolow (R-
Phila.) to have John identify
which of the two Philadephia
area universities (Temple or the
University of Pennsylvania) he
had attended failed.
The five-member joint legisla
tive panel and about 50 peo
ple who attended the open hear
ing heard a second student, iden
tified only as Robert.
Robert told the committee he
began taking excessive amounts

of cough syrup when he was 15.
He would not identify his school
either but told a story similar in
detail to that related earlier by
John.
From cough syrup he began
taking "amphetamines and bar
biturates every day." The drugs
made him "feel fine," he said,
and he took a part-time job as
a caddy to finance the $5 he was
spending each day to get his
supply.
Robert first came to the at
tention of the police when he
was arrested on a homosexual
charge. He said he had turned to
homosexual activity to finance
the growing cost of his drugs.
He was making $15 to $20 a
night, he said, and all of that
went for drugs.
The committee has not said
how long the investigation might
last nor indicated what it will
do, if anything, with the infor
mation it collects. It does plan,
however, to conduct hearings at
various universities and colleges
around the state.
