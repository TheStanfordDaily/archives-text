# Computer To Arrange Summer School Dates
## 
### 
Students attending summer
school at Stanford will have an
opportunity to date "for re
search purposes." Two graduate
students in psychology plan to
match 200 students of each sex
by computer and analyze the re
sults.
The purpose of the program is
to automate the "blind" out of
the blind date. "We think that
modern psychology and compu
ter technology can be combined
to help find potential dating
partners," Ronald Starr, co-spon
sor of the program, explained.
It Works
Donald Bamber, the other
psychology grad, is an enthus
iastic booster of the program: "I
know one of the nation-wide
computer matches worked for
me. I signed up last year and
the first girl on the list was the
nicest girl I've ever gone out
with."
This summer's participants
will fill out a questionnaire at

registration about their inter
ests and background and what
kind of dating partner they
would prefer. The computer will
then match the students and the
names will be sent to the stu
dents.
Evaluation
Near the end of the summer
quarter the students will be
asked to evaluate the program.
"They will fill out a question
naire on how many dates they
had and how well they liked the
people they were matched with,"
Starr said.
"We will see which questions
are most closely related to the
happiness scores. We might then
use only these good questions
for a match fall quarter."
Bamber added that "some peo
ple just won't get as close a
match as others —some people
are just particular. So we can
see if the people with higher
compatibility estimates are hap
pier with their dates."
