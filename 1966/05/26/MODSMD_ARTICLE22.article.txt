# Rush Total Down, Frats Still Thrive
## 
### 
Stanford fraternities have re
cruited fewer pledges this year
than in 1965, but they are still
prospering.
Some 432, about 50 per cent
of the freshmen, signed bid
cards as compared with the rec
ord-high 497 who pledged last
year. The number of pledges has
been growing in recent years.
In 1963 there were 400, and in
1964 there were 420.
Dean of Fraternities John
Hanson said the decline this year
resulted from the "fat rush"
last year. "Several fraternities
had an overflow this year left
over from last year's rush," he
said.
He said there was no evidence
that the interest in fraternities
at Stanford has declined.
IFC President Drennan Jones
noted in an interview yesterday
that fewer freshmen partici
pated in rush this spring than
usual.
"Fraternities didn't offer the
alternatives that they should
have," he said. "The impression
that a lot of freshmen got was
that fraternities were merely so
cial and that's it."
He said that distances from
Wilbur, unfavorable criticism

from Wilbur sponsors, and com
petition from the eating clubs
might have hurt some fratern
ities. At least three houses,
Jones said, are in critical need
of more members.
The growth of fraternities in
recent years, proportionately
larger than the growth in the
student body, has been stimu
lated in part by the larger ca
pacity of new "clusters."
The University has built two
such four-unit complexes—each
house accommodates 50 men and
a resident sponsor—and a third
cluster will be built next year.
In the clusters living costs have
sky-rocketed to $400 per quar
ter or more, which has put pres
sure on houses in the clusters to
maintain high membership to
avoid proportional increases in
rent per member.
To meet this problem, some
cluster fraternities have allowed
graduate students, non-affiliated
undergraduates and non - stu
dents to live in the house.
There are 23 fraternities at
Stanford with 1302 members. A
twenty-fourth, Zeta Psi, was sus
pended three years ago for mis
conduct, but will be reactivated
next year with 22 pledges.
