## Spring Sports Show Strength Near Finish 
### JIM WHITEHEAD 
Spring sports season over al
ready? Well, almost. With only
Friday's twilight track meet
against Cal remaining, it is per
haps a good time to review the
successes and failures of our
athletes this spring.
On the varsity level this was
a most disappointing period. The
baseball team let it be known
early in the campaign that they
would not challenge for the na
tional title as expected. It was
also obvious in April that the
track squad would have to de
pend more and more on the field
events and distance races as the
sprinters failed to reach top
form.
Things could have been
worse, of course; we might have
had to wait until the end of the
season to be disappointed. On
the contrary, the most recent
developments have been quite
encouraging. The golf team, for
example, finished strong with a
remarkable showing in the
AWU championships last week
end, losing by only three strokes
to heavily favored USC.
Card Nine Tough
The baseballers also finished

strong for a second place tie
with Cal. Their 18-0, 7-0 double
header sweep over the then
league-leading UCLA Bruins
late in the season was a good
measure of their potential
strength.
Final CIBA statistics revealed
that the Cards led the league in
both team batting and fielding,
while Steve Hovley, Frank Duf
fy and Jim Hibbs finished
among the top ten individual
batters. John Mason led Card
pitchers with a 2.01 ERA, while
Terry Docken, who blanked the
nation's top ranked USC Tro
jans on one hit in March, was
close behind at 2.60.
It seems fair to say that this
year's team was the best in the
conference by the end of the
year and possibly the best in
the country. It was simply a
case of jelling too late.
The varsity trackmen, on the
other hand, never quite lived
up to pre-season billing. Coach
Jordan boasted that this year's
sprinters were faster than the
quartet which set a world rec
ord of 39.7 in the 440 relay last
year, but they were never able
to crack the 40 second barrier

this spring. Their time of 40.5
is very commendable.
Trackmen Downed Spartans
Still, there were outstanding
team and individual efforts.
Notable among these was the
squad's spirited victory over San
Jose State the second of April,
when a little extra effort turned
the expected toss-up into an easy
20 point victory for the Tribe.
Jim Eshelman's tremendous
vault of 16W against UCLA
and his second place finish in
the AAWU meet were among
the most outstanding individual

performances.
Bud Walsh hurdled well all
year, and Craig Vaughn led the
league for several weeks with a
24'5" long jump. Dave Deub
ner's tremendous mile victory at
Cal, and Bob Stoecker's discus
win against A 1 Pemberton were
also memorable.
Even the tennis team showed
signs of life at the end of the
year with two victories over
Cal and a third place finish in
the league tourney. Peak efforts
by Jim Beste and Brian Leek
could even garner third place
for the unpredictable n e t m en
next month in the NCAAs,
which would match last year's
surprising finish.
The crew and lacrosse outfits
also finished successfully. The
crewmen swept all races against
Cal this spring for the first
time since 1916, while the lax
men finished second in penin
sula league play behind unde
feated Palo Alto.
Frosh Outstanding
What excitement there was
this spring could be attributed
largely to the frosh, though. The
Papoose baseball team was
Stanford's best ever, finishing
at 27-1-2 with a preseason vic
tory over the varsity. Bob
Boone led a balanced hitting at
tack, while moundmen Don

Rose and Sandy Vance blanked
all opposition.
The frosh track team also suf
fered but one loss. Impressive
victories over Hancock and San
ta Ana, which had previously
beaten both the USC and UCLA
frosh, established our thinclads
as one of the best, if not the
best, among frosh and JC
squads in the entire nation.
Many people overlook the
depth of the squad, assuming
the sole loss at Cal to have re
sulted from Pat Morrison's ab
sence. In fact, the frosh could
easily have won without him.
An unfortunate disqualification
of Tom Kommers, top frosh hur
dler in the school's history, ac
tually meant the difference.
Frosh Netrnen Best
The frosh tennis squad quiet
ly emerged as the mo<st success
ful team this spring with an un
defeated 9-0 slate. Included
among its accomplishments was
an impressive conquest of City
College of San Francisco, win
ners of the Nor Cal Intercol
legiates in the frosh and JC
division.
Perhaps the most significant
sports event this spring was the
Varsity-Alumni football game,
which emphasized most dramati
cally the effect that these frosh
athletes can have on the varsity
level next year.

Spring sports season over al
ready? Well, almost. With only
Friday's twilight track meet
against Cal remaining, it is per
haps a good time to review the
successes and failures of our
athletes this spring.
On the varsity level this was
a most disappointing period. The
baseball team let it be known
early in the campaign that they
would not challenge for the na
tional title as expected. It was
also obvious in April that the
track squad would have to de
pend more and more on the field
events and distance races as the
sprinters failed to reach top
form.
Things could have been
worse, of course; we might have
had to wait until the end of the
season to be disappointed. On
the contrary, the most recent
developments have been quite
encouraging. The golf team, for
example, finished strong with a
remarkable showing in the
AWU championships last week
end, losing by only three strokes
to heavily favored USC.
Card Nine Tough
The baseballers also finished

strong for a second place tie
with Cal. Their 18-0, 7-0 double
header sweep over the then
league-leading UCLA Bruins
late in the season was a good
measure of their potential
strength.
Final CIBA statistics revealed
that the Cards led the league in
both team batting and fielding,
while Steve Hovley, Frank Duf
fy and Jim Hibbs finished
among the top ten individual
batters. John Mason led Card
pitchers with a 2.01 ERA, while
Terry Docken, who blanked the
nation's top ranked USC Tro
jans on one hit in March, was
close behind at 2.60.
It seems fair to say that this
year's team was the best in the
conference by the end of the
year and possibly the best in
the country. It was simply a
case of jelling too late.
The varsity trackmen, on the
other hand, never quite lived
up to pre-season billing. Coach
Jordan boasted that this year's
sprinters were faster than the
quartet which set a world rec
ord of 39.7 in the 440 relay last
year, but they were never able
to crack the 40 second barrier

this spring. Their time of 40.5
is very commendable.
Trackmen Downed Spartans
Still, there were outstanding
team and individual efforts.
Notable among these was the
squad's spirited victory over San
Jose State the second of April,
when a little extra effort turned
the expected toss-up into an easy
20 point victory for the Tribe.
Jim Eshelman's tremendous
vault of 16W against UCLA
and his second place finish in
the AAWU meet were among
the most outstanding individual

performances.
Bud Walsh hurdled well all
year, and Craig Vaughn led the
league for several weeks with a
24'5" long jump. Dave Deub
ner's tremendous mile victory at
Cal, and Bob Stoecker's discus
win against A 1 Pemberton were
also memorable.
Even the tennis team showed
signs of life at the end of the
year with two victories over
Cal and a third place finish in
the league tourney. Peak efforts
by Jim Beste and Brian Leek
could even garner third place
for the unpredictable n e t m en
next month in the NCAAs,
which would match last year's
surprising finish.
The crew and lacrosse outfits
also finished successfully. The
crewmen swept all races against
Cal this spring for the first
time since 1916, while the lax
men finished second in penin
sula league play behind unde
feated Palo Alto.
Frosh Outstanding
What excitement there was
this spring could be attributed
largely to the frosh, though. The
Papoose baseball team was
Stanford's best ever, finishing
at 27-1-2 with a preseason vic
tory over the varsity. Bob
Boone led a balanced hitting at
tack, while moundmen Don

Rose and Sandy Vance blanked
all opposition.
The frosh track team also suf
fered but one loss. Impressive
victories over Hancock and San
ta Ana, which had previously
beaten both the USC and UCLA
frosh, established our thinclads
as one of the best, if not the
best, among frosh and JC
squads in the entire nation.
Many people overlook the
depth of the squad, assuming
the sole loss at Cal to have re
sulted from Pat Morrison's ab
sence. In fact, the frosh could
easily have won without him.
An unfortunate disqualification
of Tom Kommers, top frosh hur
dler in the school's history, ac
tually meant the difference.
Frosh Netrnen Best
The frosh tennis squad quiet
ly emerged as the mo<st success
ful team this spring with an un
defeated 9-0 slate. Included
among its accomplishments was
an impressive conquest of City
College of San Francisco, win
ners of the Nor Cal Intercol
legiates in the frosh and JC
division.
Perhaps the most significant
sports event this spring was the

sence. In fact, the frosh could
easily have won without him.
An unfortunate disqualification
of Tom Kommers, top frosh hur
dler in the school's history, ac
tually meant the difference.
Frosh Netrnen Best
The frosh tennis squad quiet
ly emerged as the mo<st success
ful team this spring with an un
defeated 9-0 slate. Included
among its accomplishments was
an impressive conquest of City
College of San Francisco, win
ners of the Nor Cal Intercol
legiates in the frosh and JC
division.
Perhaps the most significant
sports event this spring was the
Varsity-Alumni football game,
which emphasized most dramati
cally the effect that these frosh
athletes can have on the varsity
level next year.

Spring sports season over al
ready? Well, almost. With only
Friday's twilight track meet
against Cal remaining, it is per
haps a good time to review the
successes and failures of our
athletes this spring.
On the varsity level this was
a most disappointing period. The
baseball team let it be known
early in the campaign that they
would not challenge for the na
tional title as expected. It was
also obvious in April that the
track squad would have to de
pend more and more on the field
events and distance races as the
sprinters failed to reach top
form.
Things could have been
worse, of course; we might have
had to wait until the end of the
season to be disappointed. On
the contrary, the most recent
developments have been quite
encouraging. The golf team, for
example, finished strong with a
remarkable showing in the
AWU championships last week
end, losing by only three strokes
to heavily favored USC.
Card Nine Tough
The baseballers also finished

strong for a second place tie
with Cal. Their 18-0, 7-0 double
header sweep over the then
league-leading UCLA Bruins
late in the season was a good
measure of their potential
strength.
Final CIBA statistics revealed
that the Cards led the league in
both team batting and fielding,
while Steve Hovley, Frank Duf
fy and Jim Hibbs finished
among the top ten individual
batters. John Mason led Card
pitchers with a 2.01 ERA, while
Terry Docken, who blanked the
nation's top ranked USC Tro
jans on one hit in March, was
close behind at 2.60.
It seems fair to say that this
year's team was the best in the
conference by the end of the
year and possibly the best in
the country. It was simply a
case of jelling too late.
The varsity trackmen, on the
other hand, never quite lived
up to pre-season billing. Coach
Jordan boasted that this year's
sprinters were faster than the
quartet which set a world rec
ord of 39.7 in the 440 relay last
year, but they were never able
to crack the 40 second barrier

this spring. Their time of 40.5
is very commendable.
Trackmen Downed Spartans
Still, there were outstanding
team and individual efforts.
Notable among these was the
squad's spirited victory over San
Jose State the second of April,
when a little extra effort turned
the expected toss-up into an easy
20 point victory for the Tribe.
Jim Eshelman's tremendous
vault of 16W against UCLA
and his second place finish in
the AAWU meet were among
the most outstanding individual

performances.
Bud Walsh hurdled well all
year, and Craig Vaughn led the
league for several weeks with a
24'5" long jump. Dave Deub
ner's tremendous mile victory at
Cal, and Bob Stoecker's discus
win against A 1 Pemberton were
also memorable.
Even the tennis team showed
signs of life at the end of the
year with two victories over
Cal and a third place finish in
the league tourney. Peak efforts
by Jim Beste and Brian Leek
could even garner third place
for the unpredictable n e t m en
next month in the NCAAs,
which would match last year's
surprising finish.
The crew and lacrosse outfits
also finished successfully. The
crewmen swept all races against
Cal this spring for the first
time since 1916, while the lax
men finished second in penin
sula league play behind unde
feated Palo Alto.
Frosh Outstanding
What excitement there was
this spring could be attributed
largely to the frosh, though. The
Papoose baseball team was
Stanford's best ever, finishing
at 27-1-2 with a preseason vic
tory over the varsity. Bob
Boone led a balanced hitting at
tack, while moundmen Don

Rose and Sandy Vance blanked
all opposition.
The frosh track team also suf
fered but one loss. Impressive
victories over Hancock and San
ta Ana, which had previously
beaten both the USC and UCLA
frosh, established our thinclads
as one of the best, if not the
best, among frosh and JC
squads in the entire nation.
Many people overlook the
depth of the squad, assuming
the sole loss at Cal to have re
sulted from Pat Morrison's ab
sence. In fact, the frosh could
easily have won without him.
An unfortunate disqualification
of Tom Kommers, top frosh hur
dler in the school's history, ac
