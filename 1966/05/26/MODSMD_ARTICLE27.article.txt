### TOM EDISON Sports Editor 
The 1965-66 sports season
was unusual in many respects
especially in the AAWU. A
small, scrappy UCLA squad not
only won the conference cham
pionship in football but went
on to defeat unbeaten Michigan
State. The basketball crown was
won by an unheralded Ore
gon State team that led the
country in defense.
Stanford's fall and w 1 n te r
sports did fall on occasion but
it also had its winners. However,

the southern supremacy of
UCLA and USC still persisted;
a season was salvaged or a
championship was won with a
victory over the Trojans or
Bruins.
Predominantly through the ef
forts of Coach Jim Gaughran
Stanford evolved this year into
a national power in both swim
ming and water polo. This ac
claim results not only from the
success of Stanford's varsity
crews but also from the per
formance of the freshmen
squads.
Se<-ond In Nation
Stanford's varsity water polo

team produced a 17-4 record
and was ranked second in the
nation to UCLA. Seven Indians
were named to the All-Ameri
can squad with sophomore Gary
Sheerer being named to the first
team.
More impressive, however,
was the varsity swimmer's sixth
place finish in the NCAA Cham
pionships.
Not to be outdone, the fresh
men finished third place in the
AAU Indoor Swimming Cham
pionships. They competed
against varsity teams. The
freshman water polo team com
piled a 12-4 record.
Football Impressive?
Stanford's football team com
piled a relatively impressive
record of 6-3-1. However, losses
resulted from USC, UCLA, and
Washington — all conference
foes. The 14-0 loss to USC re
sulting from two fourth-quarter
touchdowns rates as one of the
top sports events of the year.
Nonetheless, the 30-13 loss to
UCLA and 41-8 trampling by the
Huskies were both humiliating.
Basketball proved to be the
most erratic sport of the fall
and winter season. They fin
ished third in the conference
with an 8-6 record.
The Indians began with an
impressive 81-78 victory over
USF and a dramatic 74-69 win
over UCLA ending the Bruins
35-game win streak. However, a
94-54 loss to Arizona was
one of the woret defeats in
Stanford's basketball history.
Stanford ended the season with
a 70-58 loss to the Bruins and

a 88-73 humiliation by Cal.
Rugby finishing the regular
season with a 4-3-2 record
placed third in the annual Mon
terey tournament.

Soccer, wrestling, gymnastics,
and boxing for the most had un
successful win-loss records but
outstanding athletes were still
present.
Kamel Kadi, although injured
in the middle of the season, still
demonstrated his All-America
style and lead the soccer team
to a 4-7 record.
Tom Jenks won the 172-pound
Conference Boxing Champion
ship while freshman Len Boreh
ers was champion at 154 at the
AAU Western Wrestling Cham
pionships.

The 1965-66 sports season
was unusual in many respects
especially in the AAWU. A
small, scrappy UCLA squad not
only won the conference cham
pionship in football but went
on to defeat unbeaten Michigan
State. The basketball crown was
won by an unheralded Ore
gon State team that led the
country in defense.
Stanford's fall and w 1 n te r
sports did fall on occasion but
it also had its winners. However,

the southern supremacy of
UCLA and USC still persisted;
a season was salvaged or a
championship was won with a
victory over the Trojans or
Bruins.
Predominantly through the ef
forts of Coach Jim Gaughran
Stanford evolved this year into
a national power in both swim
ming and water polo. This ac
claim results not only from the
success of Stanford's varsity
crews but also from the per
formance of the freshmen
squads.
Se<-ond In Nation
Stanford's varsity water polo

team produced a 17-4 record
and was ranked second in the
nation to UCLA. Seven Indians
were named to the All-Ameri
can squad with sophomore Gary
Sheerer being named to the first
team.
More impressive, however,
was the varsity swimmer's sixth
place finish in the NCAA Cham
pionships.
Not to be outdone, the fresh
men finished third place in the
AAU Indoor Swimming Cham
pionships. They competed
against varsity teams. The

piled a 12-4 record.
