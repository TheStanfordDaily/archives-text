# An Illogical Myth
## 
### 
Stanford women are disparaged beings. Angry
males write letters to The Daily accusing them
of arrogance, bookishness, frigidity, selfishness,
and cruelty. Other males, frustrated beyond
hope, abandon them and go elsewhere for their
social lives. And on top of this, the women often
feel that many a Stanford prof will not accept
them as intellectual equals.
The fault, of course, is not entirely with the
women. The lopsided Ratio creates a super
ficial situation in which Stanford women are
exalted and — at the same time — deprecated,
for they are the object of a demand which, be
cause of their small numbers, they cannot fill.
And then there are the social regulations.
Special rules for undergraduate women at
Stanford seem to be premised on the antiquated
belief that the female of the species is somehow
inherently inferior to the male. She is not capa
ble, the social regulations infer, of making de
cisions for herself —even though almost every
freshman woman is of legal age to marry with
out her parents' consent.
Other areas of University life make no dis
tinction between men and women. There are no
academic policies discriminating against women.
They participate freely in honors programs. Just
last autumn the Dean of Students Office was
reorganized so as to eliminate separate deans of
men and women, in recognition of the fact that
as members of an academic corrynunity men and
women have problems which have more simi
larities than differences. And yet the social Reg
ulations continue to exist.
The main reason? Most undergraduate women
continue to feel that they are necessary. A re
cent poll sheds some light on this feeling.
The poll, taken by the Social Regulations
Committee, shows that better than 60 per cent
of Stanford s undergraduate women feel social
regulations should be abolished for juniors. The

figure for abolishing senior regulations is even
higher: almost 75 per cent. But for sophomores,
60 per cent of the women feel the regulations
should be retained. And 90 per cent believe that
freshmen should live under the rules. Thus, the
women seem to reason that with academic ma
turity should come greater control over one's
own social behavior. Logical, perhaps.
But the women were also asked what possible
purposes they thought social regulations had,
and in their answers to this, the logic seems to
break down. For instance, the most popular
reason given for retaining the rules was that they
provide a means of contacting a woman in case
of an emergency—in spite of the fact that every
one of the almost 300 women polled said the
University has never used sign-out information
to contact them in such a situation. Other oft
given reasons were that the regulations provide
safety, protection, a structure for developing
good judgment and social maturity, and a struc
ture for the woman who may need one—yet 30
per cent of the women say that the regulations
are of no use to them, and almost 85 per cent
find them of no more than moderate usefulness.
The conclusion to be drawn from this is that
the average woman trusts herself more than she
does her compatriots. She is sure of herself, but
unsure of others, and therefore, she reasons, the
regulations must be maintained.
The women of Stanford, we must therefore
conclude, have been caught up in their own
myth—they accept the inferiority of the female
sex, believing that women in general are not
capable of taking care of themselves, but insist
upon making an exception for their individual
lives. They preach one set of values, and be
lieve in another. Like the Pharisees, they wash
the outside of the cup and ignore the inside.
Such an approach, we feel, is ill-befitting the
Stanford woman.

lieve in another. Like the Pharisees, they wash
the outside of the cup and ignore the inside.
Such an approach, we feel, is ill-befitting the
Stanford woman.
Stanford women are disparaged beings. Angry
males write letters to The Daily accusing them
of arrogance, bookishness, frigidity, selfishness,
and cruelty. Other males, frustrated beyond
hope, abandon them and go elsewhere for their
social lives. And on top of this, the women often
feel that many a Stanford prof will not accept
them as intellectual equals.
The fault, of course, is not entirely with the
women. The lopsided Ratio creates a super
ficial situation in which Stanford women are
exalted and — at the same time — deprecated,
for they are the object of a demand which, be
cause of their small numbers, they cannot fill.
And then there are the social regulations.
Special rules for undergraduate women at
Stanford seem to be premised on the antiquated
belief that the female of the species is somehow
inherently inferior to the male. She is not capa
ble, the social regulations infer, of making de
cisions for herself —even though almost every
freshman woman is of legal age to marry with
out her parents' consent.
Other areas of University life make no dis
tinction between men and women. There are no
academic policies discriminating against women.
They participate freely in honors programs. Just
last autumn the Dean of Students Office was
reorganized so as to eliminate separate deans of
men and women, in recognition of the fact that
as members of an academic corrynunity men and
women have problems which have more simi
larities than differences. And yet the social Reg
ulations continue to exist.
The main reason? Most undergraduate women
continue to feel that they are necessary. A re
cent poll sheds some light on this feeling.
The poll, taken by the Social Regulations
Committee, shows that better than 60 per cent
of Stanford s undergraduate women feel social
regulations should be abolished for juniors. The

figure for abolishing senior regulations is even
higher: almost 75 per cent. But for sophomores,
60 per cent of the women feel the regulations
should be retained. And 90 per cent believe that
freshmen should live under the rules. Thus, the
women seem to reason that with academic ma
turity should come greater control over one's
own social behavior. Logical, perhaps.
But the women were also asked what possible
purposes they thought social regulations had,
and in their answers to this, the logic seems to
break down. For instance, the most popular
reason given for retaining the rules was that they
provide a means of contacting a woman in case
of an emergency—in spite of the fact that every
one of the almost 300 women polled said the
University has never used sign-out information
to contact them in such a situation. Other oft
given reasons were that the regulations provide
safety, protection, a structure for developing
good judgment and social maturity, and a struc
ture for the woman who may need one—yet 30
per cent of the women say that the regulations
are of no use to them, and almost 85 per cent
find them of no more than moderate usefulness.
The conclusion to be drawn from this is that
the average woman trusts herself more than she
does her compatriots. She is sure of herself, but
unsure of others, and therefore, she reasons, the
regulations must be maintained.
The women of Stanford, we must therefore
conclude, have been caught up in their own
myth—they accept the inferiority of the female
sex, believing that women in general are not
capable of taking care of themselves, but insist
upon making an exception for their individual
lives. They preach one set of values, and be
lieve in another. Like the Pharisees, they wash
the outside of the cup and ignore the inside.
