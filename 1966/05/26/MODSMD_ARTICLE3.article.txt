# ASSU Appoints New Committee To Evaluate Academic Programs
## 
### BOB FISHMAN Senior Staff Writer 
To evaluate education at Stanford
today and to propose changes for
Stanford tomorrow is the task of the
newly-formed ASSU Education Com
mission.
Under the chairmanship of junior
Rick Stearns, the 12 members of the
Commission are investigating topics
ranging from the philosophy of edu
cation to coed dorms.
Senior Colloquia
Most important of the projects un
dertaken so far is a evaluation of
the Senior Colloquia by Lars Gantzel
and Peggy McFaddcn. They have dis
tributed questionnaires to professors
asking if they would be willing to
teach a student-initiated colloquia and
if they would be willing to teach it to
members of other classes as well as
to seniors.
At the request of LASSU, the Com
mission has begun a project to define
the criteria for granting academic
credit and to determine if any courses
now given do not meet these stan
dards. The members working on this
project, David Cornberg, Chris Harte,
and .Rick Stearns, have already met
with representatives of the Military
Science and Athletics departments.
Student Advisers
Academic advising is also a topic of
concern to the Commission. A student
advisory program is planned to sup

plement the work now done exclu
sively by the faculty.
According to their plan, each de
partment will nominate a few of its
more outstanding seniors to serve as
student advisers. The seniors would
then be available to counsel under
classmen who are interested in their
departments.
Another proposal now before the
Commission involves instituting a
"Liberal Acts Conference" similar to
one held this year at the University
of Chicago. Classes were suspended
for four days as students attended
instead guest lectures and seminars
dealing with the aims of a liberal
arts education.
University Scholar
A program already established at
Yale which the Commission would
like to see at Stanford too is the Uni
versity Scholar program. Seniors
named as University Scholars would
be relieved of all classroom require
ments and would instead pursue in
dividual research.
Encouraging discussion of the prob
lems of education is the responsibility
of junior David Cornberg. He hopes to
establish a quarterly report for arti
cles dealing with University educa
tion and for informing, the student
body of the work of the Commission.
In addition, he hopes to begin a series

of open forums at which members
of the University Commission can air
their grievances or make known their
proposals for change.
Doctor of Arts Degree
The Commission is interested in
graduate education as well as under
graduate programs. Members have
proposed that a degree of Doctor of
Arts be established for students who
have completed all Ph.D. require
ments except the dissertation.
Members of the Commission are
also expected to form and chair sub
committees. The members and their
committees are Johnathan Ketchum,
Philosophy of Education; David Corn
berg, Educational Programs; Barry
Sokolik .Policy Making Structures;
Tracy Taft, Residential Education;
Kathy Hansen, Advising; Kurt Moses,
Education and the Communitv; Chris
Harte, Freshman Year; Bob Irishman,
Undergraduate Curriculum Evalua
tion; Lars Gantzel, Graduate Curric
ulum Evaluation; and Tim Haight,
Grades and Degree Requirements.
Fred Johnson is in charge of Ad
ministrative Details.
