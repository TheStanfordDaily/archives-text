## Making A Napalm Scrapbook 
### Eric Prokosch 
Mr. Aaron J. Manganiello, for
mer Daily jazz critic, entered
his third day of fast at the Red
wood City napalm plant today,
and Bay area peace groups were
busy preparing for Saturday's
rally. In the meantime, United
Technology Center, producers
of napalm, have accumulated
quite a store of information
about the protesters.
Photographers
When members of the Stan
ford Committee for Peace in
Vietnam picketed UTC installa
tions in Sunnyvale and Coyote
earlier this year, men were at
hand to photograph any worker
who stopped to take literature
from the demonstrators. This
activity soon put a stop to any
communication at the plant
gate, but at Coyote the photog
raphers neglected to cover the
spot where the entrance road to
the plant joins U. S. 101, and
demonstrators were able to
hand out a number of leaflets
there.
In late March, when SCPV
members asked their usual
printer to print a leaflet on

napalm, he refused to take the
job. A security agent from UTC
had been to see him, and he
does a good deal of work for
them.
On May 6, when dissatisfied
protesters began a 24-hour vigil
at the napalm plant in Redwood
City, a man in plain clothes was
there to take pictures of (hem.
Since then, protesters have re
ported, the plant security guards
have carried on the task. A uni
formed guard sits in a booth by
the gate and looks through a
large scrapbook having about
20 photographs per page. When
he sees someone at the vigil
who is not in the book, he takes
a picture of him.
License Plates
Besides taking photographs,
the guards have recorded license
numbers of cars parked near
the plant. Enquiry of this sort
extends to activities away from
the plant, and it has recently
been reported that the Redwood
Ciy Police Department indig
nantly turned down a request
by UTC to supply the license
"numbers of cars parked outside

Sequoia High School during a
public meeting of the Redwood
City Committee Against Na
palm May 17.
Mr. Theodore Moudakas, Dep
uty Chief of Police, told The
Daily that many people attend
night classes as well as meetings
at the high school; however, he
was unable to confirm the story
personally, and a spokesman for
UTC also refused to comment.
By one means or another the
security guards have aparently
learned a great deal about the
protesters. One person at the
vigil was startled when some
one in the plant began calling
him by his first name. During
an earlier picketing operation,
an SCPV member was greeted
with the words, "Sorry I missed
your birthday yesterday, Jeff."
It is still not known how such
information is obtained.
When the vigil began May 6,
a reporter from the Redwood
City Tribune tried in vain to
discover why the photographs
were being taken and how they
might be used.
Questions Unanswered
A similar course of frustra
tion was experienced by this re
porter. A security guard at the
plant told me to call UTC head
quarters in Sunnyvale. When I
attempted at the plant to inter
view Robert Donovan, head of
plant security and a well-known
figure among SCPV demonstra
tors, the reporter was greeted
affably—"Oh, yes, I've read
your articles"—but again, ques
tions were referred to Sunny
vale. Yesterday, however, a pub
lic relations official at the UTC
Sunnyvale office was unable to
answer most of my questions.
"Is it true that security guards
have taken pictures of all the
people at the vigil?"
"No."
"Have they taken pictures of
some of the people?"
"I don't believe so, but I am
not there all the time."
"What about a book of photo
graphs?"
"I couldn't comment."
"How might UTC use photo
graphs and other information?"
"I don't know what benefit it
would be to us to have names of
the demonstrators. The demon
strating groups have been very

cooperative. We have nothing to
do with what happens off our
property" (i.e., outside the plant
gate).
Normal Practice
With reference to the picket
ing at Sunnyvale and Coyote,
the official said: "We were tak
ing pictures of events happening
in front of our property. This
is a normal practice; it was not
done to find out who the em
ployee is. Our employees are en
titled to do anything they want
off the property."
Asked whether UTC might
use its information to intimidate
the protesters, the official re
plied, "I would know nothing
about it, but I am doubtful if
the company would do such a
thing."
However, The Daily has been
informed that a member of the
Stanford Research Institute
was recently approached by a
man from UTC who wanted to
point out that an SRI employee
had attended the vigil.
Confronted with this report,
the UTC official yesterday re
fused to confirm or deny it, but
said that even if it wa6 true,
he could still make no state
ment. He explained: "I can give
only information, not reasons.
This policy is laid down by the
management. As I see it, we
don't live in the jungle; we live
in a land of laws.
"When the government,
through democratic processes,
reaches a decision and then
calls on a company to carry it
out, the citizens must follow the
government's instructions."
Limited Information
The information which he
could divulge is also limited,
though: "If you asked me wheth
er the napalm plant was in Red
wood City, I would say yes. If
you asked me 'Where is it?" I
would say I don't know."
Protesters at the vigil have
expressed anger and annoyance
at being photographed, but
there is apparently little they
can do about it. Thus far no
one has discovered that any il
legal act has been committed.
If the protesters finally suc
ceed in chasing the napalm plant
from their city, the UTC people
will have a large file of infor
mation to take along with them.

hand to photograph any worker
who stopped to take literature
from the demonstrators. This
activity soon put a stop to any
communication at the plant
gate, but at Coyote the photog
raphers neglected to cover the
spot where the entrance road to
the plant joins U. S. 101, and
demonstrators were able to
hand out a number of leaflets
there.
In late March, when SCPV
members asked their usual
printer to print a leaflet on

napalm, he refused to take the
job. A security agent from UTC
had been to see him, and he
does a good deal of work for
them.
On May 6, when dissatisfied
protesters began a 24-hour vigil
at the napalm plant in Redwood
City, a man in plain clothes was
there to take pictures of (hem.
Since then, protesters have re
ported, the plant security guards
have carried on the task. A uni
formed guard sits in a booth by
the gate and looks through a
large scrapbook having about
20 photographs per page. When
he sees someone at the vigil
who is not in the book, he takes
a picture of him.
License Plates
Besides taking photographs,
the guards have recorded license
numbers of cars parked near
the plant. Enquiry of this sort
extends to activities away from
the plant, and it has recently
been reported that the Redwood
Ciy Police Department indig
nantly turned down a request
by UTC to supply the license
"numbers of cars parked outside

Sequoia High School during a
public meeting of the Redwood
City Committee Against Na
palm May 17.
Mr. Theodore Moudakas, Dep
uty Chief of Police, told The
Daily that many people attend
night classes as well as meetings
at the high school; however, he
was unable to confirm the story
personally, and a spokesman for
UTC also refused to comment.
By one means or another the
security guards have aparently
learned a great deal about the
protesters. One person at the
vigil was startled when some
one in the plant began calling
him by his first name. During
an earlier picketing operation,
an SCPV member was greeted
with the words, "Sorry I missed
your birthday yesterday, Jeff."
It is still not known how such
information is obtained.
When the vigil began May 6,
a reporter from the Redwood
City Tribune tried in vain to
discover why the photographs
were being taken and how they
might be used.
Questions Unanswered
A similar course of frustra
tion was experienced by this re
porter. A security guard at the
plant told me to call UTC head
quarters in Sunnyvale. When I
attempted at the plant to inter
view Robert Donovan, head of
plant security and a well-known
figure among SCPV demonstra
tors, the reporter was greeted
affably—"Oh, yes, I've read
your articles"—but again, ques
tions were referred to Sunny
vale. Yesterday, however, a pub
lic relations official at the UTC
Sunnyvale office was unable to
answer most of my questions.
"Is it true that security guards
have taken pictures of all the
people at the vigil?"
"No."
"Have they taken pictures of
some of the people?"
"I don't believe so, but I am
not there all the time."
"What about a book of photo
graphs?"
"I couldn't comment."
"How might UTC use photo
graphs and other information?"
"I don't know what benefit it
would be to us to have names of
the demonstrators. The demon
strating groups have been very

cooperative. We have nothing to
do with what happens off our
property" (i.e., outside the plant
gate).
Normal Practice
With reference to the picket
ing at Sunnyvale and Coyote,
the official said: "We were tak
ing pictures of events happening
in front of our property. This
is a normal practice; it was not
done to find out who the em
ployee is. Our employees are en
titled to do anything they want
off the property."
Asked whether UTC might
use its information to intimidate
the protesters, the official re
plied, "I would know nothing
about it, but I am doubtful if
the company would do such a
thing."
However, The Daily has been
informed that a member of the
Stanford Research Institute
was recently approached by a
man from UTC who wanted to
point out that an SRI employee
had attended the vigil.
Confronted with this report,
the UTC official yesterday re
fused to confirm or deny it, but
said that even if it wa6 true,
he could still make no state
ment. He explained: "I can give
only information, not reasons.
This policy is laid down by the
management. As I see it, we
don't live in the jungle; we live
in a land of laws.
"When the government,
through democratic processes,
reaches a decision and then
calls on a company to carry it
out, the citizens must follow the
government's instructions."
Limited Information
The information which he
could divulge is also limited,
though: "If you asked me wheth
er the napalm plant was in Red
wood City, I would say yes. If
you asked me 'Where is it?" I
would say I don't know."
Protesters at the vigil have
expressed anger and annoyance
at being photographed, but
there is apparently little they
can do about it. Thus far no
one has discovered that any il
legal act has been committed.
If the protesters finally suc
ceed in chasing the napalm plant
from their city, the UTC people
will have a large file of infor
mation to take along with them.


"Excuse mo ... I thought. that sort of thing was unconstitutional!"
Mr. Aaron J. Manganiello, for
mer Daily jazz critic, entered
his third day of fast at the Red
wood City napalm plant today,
and Bay area peace groups were
busy preparing for Saturday's
rally. In the meantime, United

of napalm, have accumulated
quite a store of information
about the protesters.

had been to see him, and he
does a good deal of work for
them.
On May 6, when dissatisfied
protesters began a 24-hour vigil
at the napalm plant in Redwood
City, a man in plain clothes was
there to take pictures of (hem.
Since then, protesters have re
ported, the plant security guards
have carried on the task. A uni
formed guard sits in a booth by
the gate and looks through a
large scrapbook having about
20 photographs per page. When
he sees someone at the vigil
who is not in the book, he takes
a picture of him.
License Plates
Besides taking photographs,
the guards have recorded license
numbers of cars parked near
the plant. Enquiry of this sort
extends to activities away from
the plant, and it has recently
been reported that the Redwood
Ciy Police Department indig
nantly turned down a request
by UTC to supply the license
"numbers of cars parked outside

Sequoia High School during a
public meeting of the Redwood
City Committee Against Na
palm May 17.
Mr. Theodore Moudakas, Dep
uty Chief of Police, told The
Daily that many people attend
night classes as well as meetings
at the high school; however, he
was unable to confirm the story
personally, and a spokesman for
UTC also refused to comment.
By one means or another the
security guards have aparently
learned a great deal about the
protesters. One person at the
vigil was startled when some
one in the plant began calling
him by his first name. During
an earlier picketing operation,
an SCPV member was greeted
with the words, "Sorry I missed
your birthday yesterday, Jeff."
It is still not known how such
information is obtained.
When the vigil began May 6,
a reporter from the Redwood
City Tribune tried in vain to
discover why the photographs
were being taken and how they
might be used.
Questions Unanswered
A similar course of frustra
tion was experienced by this re
porter. A security guard at the
plant told me to call UTC head
quarters in Sunnyvale. When I
attempted at the plant to inter
view Robert Donovan, head of
plant security and a well-known
figure among SCPV demonstra
tors, the reporter was greeted
affably—"Oh, yes, I've read
your articles"—but again, ques
tions were referred to Sunny
vale. Yesterday, however, a pub
lic relations official at the UTC
Sunnyvale office was unable to
answer most of my questions.
"Is it true that security guards
have taken pictures of all the
people at the vigil?"
"No."
"Have they taken pictures of
some of the people?"
"I don't believe so, but I am
not there all the time."
"What about a book of photo
graphs?"
"I couldn't comment."
"How might UTC use photo
graphs and other information?"
"I don't know what benefit it
would be to us to have names of
the demonstrators. The demon
strating groups have been very

cooperative. We have nothing to
do with what happens off our
property" (i.e., outside the plant
gate).
Normal Practice
With reference to the picket
ing at Sunnyvale and Coyote,
the official said: "We were tak
ing pictures of events happening
in front of our property. This
is a normal practice; it was not
done to find out who the em
ployee is. Our employees are en
titled to do anything they want
off the property."
Asked whether UTC might
use its information to intimidate
the protesters, the official re
plied, "I would know nothing
about it, but I am doubtful if
the company would do such a
thing."
However, The Daily has been
informed that a member of the
Stanford Research Institute
was recently approached by a
man from UTC who wanted to
point out that an SRI employee
had attended the vigil.
Confronted with this report,
the UTC official yesterday re
fused to confirm or deny it, but
said that even if it wa6 true,
he could still make no state
ment. He explained: "I can give
only information, not reasons.
This policy is laid down by the
management. As I see it, we
don't live in the jungle; we live
in a land of laws.
"When the government,
through democratic processes,
reaches a decision and then
calls on a company to carry it
out, the citizens must follow the
government's instructions."
Limited Information
The information which he
could divulge is also limited,
though: "If you asked me wheth
er the napalm plant was in Red
wood City, I would say yes. If
you asked me 'Where is it?" I
would say I don't know."
Protesters at the vigil have
expressed anger and annoyance
at being photographed, but
there is apparently little they
can do about it. Thus far no
one has discovered that any il
legal act has been committed.
If the protesters finally suc
ceed in chasing the napalm plant
from their city, the UTC people
will have a large file of infor
mation to take along with them.


"Excuse mo ... I thought. that sort of thing was unconstitutional!"
Mr. Aaron J. Manganiello, for
mer Daily jazz critic, entered
his third day of fast at the Red
wood City napalm plant today,
and Bay area peace groups were
busy preparing for Saturday's
rally. In the meantime, United
Technology Center, producers
of napalm, have accumulated
quite a store of information
about the protesters.
Photographers
When members of the Stan
ford Committee for Peace in
Vietnam picketed UTC installa
tions in Sunnyvale and Coyote
earlier this year, men were at
hand to photograph any worker
who stopped to take literature
from the demonstrators. This
activity soon put a stop to any
communication at the plant
gate, but at Coyote the photog
raphers neglected to cover the
spot where the entrance road to
the plant joins U. S. 101, and
demonstrators were able to
hand out a number of leaflets
there.
In late March, when SCPV
members asked their usual
printer to print a leaflet on

napalm, he refused to take the
job. A security agent from UTC
had been to see him, and he
does a good deal of work for
them.
