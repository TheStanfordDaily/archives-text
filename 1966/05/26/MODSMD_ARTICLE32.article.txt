# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## Wert Replies To The Sit-Iners 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
It seems important to me that
the students of this University
understand that it was not a
failure in communication be
tween the President's Office and
the SCPV that led to the recent
sit-in. It seems even more im
portant that students under
stand that communication be
tween them and the President,
the faculty, and the officers of
the University is not only possi
ble, it is also being actively
sought. Efforts to communicate
with student members of the
Stanford Committee for Peace
in Vietnam prior to and during
the sit-in are a case in point.
On Tuesday afternoon, May
17, when President Sterling was
attending the Academic Council
Meeting, a letter addressed to
him from the Steering Commit
tee of the SCPV was hand-de
livered by Randolf Bonner to
the President's Executive As
sistant, Frederic Glover. This
letter announced that the SCPV
was calling a special meeting of
the "entire community of schol
ars" at noon on Thursday, May
19, and invited President Ster
ling to speak at this meeting.
Mr. Glover read the letter and
informed Mr. Bonner that it
would be impossible for the
President to speak at such a
meeting because he would be
attending meetings of the Board
of Trustees all day on Thurs
day. Mr. Glover also told Mr.
Bonner that the Committee
would receive a response direct
ly from the President.
On Wednesday, May 18, the
following letter was addressed
to the Stanford Committee for

Peace in Vietnam, Box 2684,
Stanford, California:
Gentlemen:
Thank you for your letters
of May 16 and 17.
University policy towards
Selective Service procedures
is under review by the Aca
demic Council. When the Aca
demic Council has acted on
this matter and recommenda
tions have been made to Uni
versity officers who are
charged with responsibility of
administering' University pol
icy, I shall be glad to discuss
the decision with representa
tives of your Committee or to
see that this is done by appro
priate officers of the Univer
sity.
May I point out to you that
those members of the Stan
ford Committee for Peace in
Viet Nam who are also mem
bers of the Academic Council
are free to participate, in the
Council's discussion; it is pos
sible therefore that your Com
mittee's point of view will be
represented there.
Sincerely,
J. E. Wallace Sterling
Also late on Wednesday after
noon, Dean of Students Donald
Winbigler and Associate Dean
of Students Joel Smith met with
Keith Lowe, David Ransom, and
Craig Laudon of the SCPV. This
meeting had been initiated by
Dean Smith. He had done so in
the hope that accurate informa
tion about the University's rela
tion to the Selective Service
System and the reasons for of
fering the use of Stanford fa
cilities for the Selective Service
tests would remove any misun
derstanding about this relation
ship and the tests.
The matter of the SCPV's in
vitation to President Sterling to
address the Thursday noon
meeting was brought into the
discussion. It was pointed out
that the President would not be
able to come because he would
be at the Board of Trustees
meeting. Asked if he might
speak in place of the President,
Dean Winbigler said that he
also had a prior obligation (to
attend the Board of Trustees
meeting).
Shortly after the sit-in group
arrived in the President's Office,
I informed them that President
Sterling would be willing to
meet with representatives of
their group in a private discus
sion, but that the President
would not agree to such a meet
ing under conditions of duress.
This offer of direct communica
tion with President Sterling was
rejected by the spokesman for
the sit-in group.
The President's offer to meet
with delegates of the group was
left open throughout the sit-in
period and the group was re
minded that the offer stood by
Dean Smith as well as by me.
Moreover, the previous offer to
discuss made by President Ster
ling in his letter of May 18 is
still open and has not received a
direct response, written or other
wise, from SCPV.

• Unnerving
Editor, The Daily:
Miss Charyn's letter (The
Daily, May 24) if not written
unthinkingly in a moment of
anger, contains a very unnerv
ing line of thought. If a ma
jority of the people on campus
viewed her "tired protestors"
with the same narrowness of
mind that she condemns the fra
ternity system, water balloons
would have been the least of the
protestors' worries.
The actions she deplores may
have been irrational and unpar
donable, but no more so than
her own unwarranted generali
zation denouncing the entire
fraternity system, and probably
in her own mind, all the Stan
ford houses and the people in
them.
The incident is trivial, and I
don't wish to magnify it here,
nor to go into an elaborate de
fense of the Stanford fraternity:
it does, however, seem a shame
that someone who, as I would
gather from her stand, professes
a liberal view and wants open
minded discussion should be so
limited in her outlook.
With all the issues that have
faced and are facing the Stan
ford community at this time,
I think we all could stand to
examine our own thinking and
try to discover just how liberal
and just how open-minded we
really are.

• A Bigger Rally
Editor, The Daily:
I was disturbed by the inac
curacy on Saturday's protest
against napalm in Redwood
City, at which Senator Wayne
Morse will speak (Daily, May
25).
The story implied, inadvert
antly I am sure, that the protest
is being organized by and might
primarily include members of
the Stanford-Faculty-Staff Com
mittee for Peace in Vietnam.
This is not the case.
The protest, part of "National
Anti-Napalm Day" has been or
ganized by the Bay Area Coor
dinating Committee for Peace
in Vietnam, of which the Facul
ty-Staff Committee may be a
member. (I don't believe they
have taken much part in the
planning of the rally.)
Members of the Coordinating
Committee include the Vietnam
Day committees at Berkeley,
San Francisco State, and San
Jose State, the Haight-Ashbury
Committee in San Francisco,
Concerned Citizens of San Ma
teo, Concerned Citizens of Palo
Alto, the Redwood City Commit
tee Against Napalm, the San
Jose Peace Center, and the Stan
ford Committee for Peace in
Vietnam (SCPV).
Other demonstrations against
napalm Saturday will occur in
Brooklyn, N. Y., Torrence, Cal.,
and West Hartford, Conn.
The SCPV began Bay Area
action against napalm in Janu
ary, and we have been joined
since then by the San Jose
groups, the Concerned Citizens
groups, and the Redwood City
Committee. I am glad the Stan
ford Faculty-Staff Committee
plans to take part Saturday.

• A Fine Letter
Editor, The Daily:
Phil O'Donnell's letter in Tues
day's Daily was one of the fin
est, most thoughtful statements
I have ever read.
For those of us who desire
greater and more meaningful
student participation in the de
velopment of the university, but
who question the use of certain
methods in pursuit of that end,
Mr. O'Donnell's candid and pen
etrating criticism of the recent
sit-in (in which he too partici
pated) represents a significant
forward step in the movement
towards student rights and re
sponsibilities.
I urge everyone associated
with Stanford — students, fac
ulty, administration, alumni,
parents—to read Mr. O'Donnell's
letter. If all of us could be as
objective and self-searching as
he appears to be, the so-called
student movement would both
regain some of its lost luster
and also proceed With greater
speed and determination.

•Who's Arrogant?
Editor, The Daily:
Tuesday's editorial referred to
the "arrogant refusal" of the
President or a representative to
participate in an open meeting
on the selective service issue.
May I suggest that the real ar
rogance was the disdainful re
fusal of the sit-ins to agree first
to a private meeting; to attempt,
as it were, to settle the case out
of court.
That the protestors may have
been in error (Heaven forbid)
was conceded, after more ma
ture consideration, by at least
one fair - minded participant,
Phil O'Donnell, whose Letter to
the Editor appeared alongside
the editorial referred to.
The letter states: "Our initial
rejection of President Sterling's
offer for a closed meeting was
most regrettable as it gave the
impression that we were totally
unwilling to compromise." It
certainly did. How else could
this disdainful refusal be inter
preted but as unacceptable arro
gance on the part of the sit-ins.
May I suggest that the edito
rial itself revealed anything but
an open mind. Perhaps we need
a competitive newspaper on the
campus.
ARTHUR D. HOWARD
Professor of Geology
(Editor's note: Prof. Howard,
by using the old trick of quoting
out of context, twists the mean
ing of Mr. O'Donnell's state
ment, and in the process con
trives a nonexistent conflict be
tween Mr. O'Donnell and The
Daily.
Mr. O'Donnel wrote:
"Our initial rejection of Presi
dent Sterling's offer for a closed
meeting was most regrettable as
it gave the impression that we,
were totally unwilling to com
promise. Such was not the case.
Our feeling was that those few
chosen by us to stick their necks
out, would be singled out for
harsher punishment."
Prof. Howard will note that
The Daily expressed a not unre
lated sentiment: that, the Presi
dent, when meeting with stu
dents behind closed doors, often
exhibits "little genuine under
standing" and "not a little an
ger."
The editorial further men
tinned that by Friday, the sit

iners had dropped all their de
mands, with the exception of a
very reasonable request that ei
ther President Sterling or his
representative participate in an
open meeting- to discuss decision
making at Stanford.
If that isn't compromise, pray
tell what is?)
• More Hurt Than Help
Editor, The Daily:
Although we favor liberaliza
tion of University policy con
cerning open houses, we object
to LASSU's tactics in forcing
the issue through their resolu
tion calling for non-enforcement
of present policy by the Judicial
and Women's Councils.
LASSU has justified their
stand by saying that the Com
mittee of Affairs and Services
failed to act on a proposal they
set before them last January.
This may be true, but during
that time the Committee was in
volved with the final stages of
the new liquor policy. Also
LASSU claims their resolution is
aimed at gaining more resopnsi
bility for students and yet they
have relinquished student re
sponsibility and punitive power
to those members of the faculty
and staff who will now enforce
University policy.
We suggest that LASSU's
rash tactics have hurt far more
than helped the Open House is
sue.

•What's His Story?
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to thank Mr.
George Porter for his informa
tive litter of Monday, May 23.
I have been interested in Amer
ican studies for seven or eight
years and have never realized
that "competitive athletics char
acterized by the principles of
Christian morality and ethical
behavior" were "the principles
upon which this country was
founded."
I would like to see Mr. Porter's
sources, and I further wonder if
he could answer a couple of
questions that have been bother
ing me lately. What was Jona
than Edward's best time in the
100 yard dash, and was it better
than Cotton Mather's? Also,
who were the also-rans behind
George Washington in the 1754
Rappahannock Silver Dollar
Throw?

• What Price Victory ?
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Porter's skill in varsity
track is surpassed only by his
lack of understanding of the
goals of athletics. In the past
athletics have aspired to develop
the man, not destroy him.
Mr. Porter's demands for "to
tal loyalty, total respect, and to
tal obedience" not only under
mine the individual but athletics
itself.
Should these be the "price" of
victory?

• Save Us From Alums
Editor, The Daily:
Monday we read a letter in
The Daily from the alumnus.
We were so irritated that we
promptly wrote a letter which
pointed out some of his ridicu
lous notions. We basically
thought it was cute aside from
being intensely sarcastic.
But the letter was very imma
ture in the sense that in was
only griping, and what good will
mere griping do? It is only too
obvious from the other letters
of the last two or three weeks
that many of our alumni are
making value judgments on the
basis of events which they admit
they know nothing about.
How does the alumni find out
what is really happening on
campus? Does he read the ac
count of how Stanford is sick
written by a yellow press jour
nalist, does he keep an ear out
for the gossip from other
equally poorly informed alumni,
or can he ever hope to assimilate
even a trace of the actual feel
ings that exist on campus from
The Daily?
After all this Ls a student pa
per, not an alumni paper. Then
how can we protect ourselves
from people who call us sinful
for electing a president which
they know nothing about?
We ask the administration,
faculty, students, and alumni if
there is a way that we can keep
alumni informed, to let them
know what is really happening
on campus, and to let them
know what the majority of the
students who do care about their
education actually think?

• Retroactive Pill
Editor, The Daily:
In his letter, in regard to the
recommendation that all male

fortune, and anguish: birth con

Stanford, California:
Gentlemen:
Thank you for your letters
of May 16 and 17.
University policy towards
Selective Service procedures
is under review by the Aca
demic Council. When the Aca
demic Council has acted on
this matter and recommenda
tions have been made to Uni
versity officers who are
charged with responsibility of
administering' University pol
icy, I shall be glad to discuss
the decision with representa
tives of your Committee or to
see that this is done by appro
priate officers of the Univer
sity.
May I point out to you that
those members of the Stan
ford Committee for Peace in
Viet Nam who are also mem
bers of the Academic Council
are free to participate, in the
Council's discussion; it is pos
sible therefore that your Com
mittee's point of view will be
represented there.
Sincerely,
J. E. Wallace Sterling
Also late on Wednesday after
noon, Dean of Students Donald
Winbigler and Associate Dean
of Students Joel Smith met with
Keith Lowe, David Ransom, and
Craig Laudon of the SCPV. This
meeting had been initiated by
Dean Smith. He had done so in
the hope that accurate informa
tion about the University's rela
tion to the Selective Service
System and the reasons for of
fering the use of Stanford fa
cilities for the Selective Service
tests would remove any misun
derstanding about this relation
ship and the tests.
The matter of the SCPV's in
vitation to President Sterling to
address the Thursday noon
meeting was brought into the
discussion. It was pointed out
that the President would not be
able to come because he would
be at the Board of Trustees
meeting. Asked if he might
speak in place of the President,
Dean Winbigler said that he
also had a prior obligation (to
attend the Board of Trustees
meeting).
Shortly after the sit-in group
arrived in the President's Office,
I informed them that President
Sterling would be willing to
meet with representatives of
their group in a private discus
sion, but that the President
would not agree to such a meet
ing under conditions of duress.
This offer of direct communica
tion with President Sterling was
rejected by the spokesman for
the sit-in group.
The President's offer to meet
with delegates of the group was
left open throughout the sit-in
period and the group was re
minded that the offer stood by
Dean Smith as well as by me.
Moreover, the previous offer to
discuss made by President Ster
ling in his letter of May 18 is
still open and has not received a
direct response, written or other
wise, from SCPV.

• Unnerving
Editor, The Daily:
Miss Charyn's letter (The
Daily, May 24) if not written
unthinkingly in a moment of
anger, contains a very unnerv
ing line of thought. If a ma
jority of the people on campus
viewed her "tired protestors"
with the same narrowness of
mind that she condemns the fra
ternity system, water balloons
would have been the least of the
protestors' worries.
The actions she deplores may
have been irrational and unpar
donable, but no more so than
her own unwarranted generali
zation denouncing the entire
fraternity system, and probably
in her own mind, all the Stan
ford houses and the people in
them.
The incident is trivial, and I
don't wish to magnify it here,
nor to go into an elaborate de
fense of the Stanford fraternity:
it does, however, seem a shame
that someone who, as I would
gather from her stand, professes
a liberal view and wants open
minded discussion should be so
limited in her outlook.
With all the issues that have
faced and are facing the Stan
ford community at this time,
I think we all could stand to
examine our own thinking and
try to discover just how liberal
and just how open-minded we
really are.

• A Bigger Rally
Editor, The Daily:
I was disturbed by the inac
curacy on Saturday's protest
against napalm in Redwood
City, at which Senator Wayne
Morse will speak (Daily, May
25).
The story implied, inadvert
antly I am sure, that the protest
is being organized by and might
primarily include members of
the Stanford-Faculty-Staff Com
mittee for Peace in Vietnam.
This is not the case.
The protest, part of "National
Anti-Napalm Day" has been or
ganized by the Bay Area Coor
dinating Committee for Peace
in Vietnam, of which the Facul
ty-Staff Committee may be a
member. (I don't believe they
have taken much part in the
planning of the rally.)
Members of the Coordinating
Committee include the Vietnam
Day committees at Berkeley,
San Francisco State, and San
Jose State, the Haight-Ashbury
Committee in San Francisco,
Concerned Citizens of San Ma
teo, Concerned Citizens of Palo
Alto, the Redwood City Commit
tee Against Napalm, the San
Jose Peace Center, and the Stan
ford Committee for Peace in
Vietnam (SCPV).
Other demonstrations against
napalm Saturday will occur in
Brooklyn, N. Y., Torrence, Cal.,
and West Hartford, Conn.
The SCPV began Bay Area
action against napalm in Janu
ary, and we have been joined
since then by the San Jose
groups, the Concerned Citizens
groups, and the Redwood City
Committee. I am glad the Stan
ford Faculty-Staff Committee
plans to take part Saturday.

• A Fine Letter
Editor, The Daily:
Phil O'Donnell's letter in Tues
day's Daily was one of the fin
est, most thoughtful statements
I have ever read.
For those of us who desire
greater and more meaningful
student participation in the de
velopment of the university, but
who question the use of certain
methods in pursuit of that end,
Mr. O'Donnell's candid and pen
etrating criticism of the recent
sit-in (in which he too partici
pated) represents a significant
forward step in the movement
towards student rights and re
sponsibilities.
I urge everyone associated
with Stanford — students, fac
ulty, administration, alumni,
parents—to read Mr. O'Donnell's
letter. If all of us could be as
objective and self-searching as
he appears to be, the so-called
student movement would both
regain some of its lost luster
and also proceed With greater
speed and determination.

•Who's Arrogant?
Editor, The Daily:
Tuesday's editorial referred to
the "arrogant refusal" of the
President or a representative to
participate in an open meeting
on the selective service issue.
May I suggest that the real ar
rogance was the disdainful re
fusal of the sit-ins to agree first
to a private meeting; to attempt,
as it were, to settle the case out
of court.
That the protestors may have
been in error (Heaven forbid)
was conceded, after more ma
ture consideration, by at least
one fair - minded participant,
Phil O'Donnell, whose Letter to
the Editor appeared alongside
the editorial referred to.
The letter states: "Our initial
rejection of President Sterling's
offer for a closed meeting was
most regrettable as it gave the
impression that we were totally
unwilling to compromise." It
certainly did. How else could
this disdainful refusal be inter
preted but as unacceptable arro
gance on the part of the sit-ins.
May I suggest that the edito
rial itself revealed anything but
an open mind. Perhaps we need
a competitive newspaper on the
campus.
ARTHUR D. HOWARD
Professor of Geology
(Editor's note: Prof. Howard,
by using the old trick of quoting
out of context, twists the mean
ing of Mr. O'Donnell's state
ment, and in the process con
trives a nonexistent conflict be
tween Mr. O'Donnell and The
Daily.
Mr. O'Donnel wrote:
"Our initial rejection of Presi
dent Sterling's offer for a closed
meeting was most regrettable as
it gave the impression that we,
were totally unwilling to com
promise. Such was not the case.
Our feeling was that those few
chosen by us to stick their necks
out, would be singled out for
harsher punishment."
Prof. Howard will note that
The Daily expressed a not unre
lated sentiment: that, the Presi
dent, when meeting with stu
dents behind closed doors, often
exhibits "little genuine under
standing" and "not a little an
ger."
The editorial further men
tinned that by Friday, the sit

iners had dropped all their de
mands, with the exception of a
very reasonable request that ei
ther President Sterling or his
representative participate in an
open meeting- to discuss decision
making at Stanford.
If that isn't compromise, pray
tell what is?)
• More Hurt Than Help
Editor, The Daily:
Although we favor liberaliza
tion of University policy con
cerning open houses, we object
to LASSU's tactics in forcing
the issue through their resolu
tion calling for non-enforcement
of present policy by the Judicial
and Women's Councils.
LASSU has justified their
stand by saying that the Com
mittee of Affairs and Services
failed to act on a proposal they
set before them last January.
This may be true, but during
that time the Committee was in
volved with the final stages of
the new liquor policy. Also
LASSU claims their resolution is
aimed at gaining more resopnsi
bility for students and yet they
have relinquished student re
sponsibility and punitive power
to those members of the faculty
and staff who will now enforce
University policy.
We suggest that LASSU's
rash tactics have hurt far more
than helped the Open House is
sue.

•What's His Story?
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to thank Mr.
George Porter for his informa
tive litter of Monday, May 23.
I have been interested in Amer
ican studies for seven or eight
years and have never realized
that "competitive athletics char
acterized by the principles of
Christian morality and ethical
behavior" were "the principles
upon which this country was
founded."
I would like to see Mr. Porter's
sources, and I further wonder if
he could answer a couple of
questions that have been bother
ing me lately. What was Jona
than Edward's best time in the
100 yard dash, and was it better
than Cotton Mather's? Also,
who were the also-rans behind
George Washington in the 1754
Rappahannock Silver Dollar
Throw?

• What Price Victory ?
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Porter's skill in varsity
track is surpassed only by his
lack of understanding of the
goals of athletics. In the past
athletics have aspired to develop
the man, not destroy him.
Mr. Porter's demands for "to
tal loyalty, total respect, and to
tal obedience" not only under
mine the individual but athletics
itself.
Should these be the "price" of
victory?

• Save Us From Alums
Editor, The Daily:
Monday we read a letter in
The Daily from the alumnus.
We were so irritated that we
promptly wrote a letter which
pointed out some of his ridicu
lous notions. We basically
thought it was cute aside from
being intensely sarcastic.
But the letter was very imma
ture in the sense that in was
only griping, and what good will
mere griping do? It is only too
obvious from the other letters
of the last two or three weeks
that many of our alumni are
making value judgments on the
basis of events which they admit
they know nothing about.
How does the alumni find out
what is really happening on
campus? Does he read the ac
count of how Stanford is sick
written by a yellow press jour
nalist, does he keep an ear out
for the gossip from other
equally poorly informed alumni,
or can he ever hope to assimilate
even a trace of the actual feel
ings that exist on campus from
The Daily?
After all this Ls a student pa
per, not an alumni paper. Then
how can we protect ourselves
from people who call us sinful
for electing a president which
they know nothing about?
We ask the administration,
faculty, students, and alumni if
there is a way that we can keep
alumni informed, to let them
know what is really happening
on campus, and to let them
know what the majority of the
students who do care about their
education actually think?

• Retroactive Pill
Editor, The Daily:
In his letter, in regard to the
recommendation that all male
students have vasectomies (The
Dally, May 23.) Mr. Gedman un
wittingly points to an even
greater area of dilemma, mis
fortune, and anguish: birth con
trol cannot be made retroactive!
JAMES A. PAULSEN, M.D.
Health Service
Editor, The Daily:
It seems important to me that
the students of this University
understand that it was not a
failure in communication be
tween the President's Office and
the SCPV that led to the recent
sit-in. It seems even more im
portant that students under
stand that communication be
tween them and the President,
the faculty, and the officers of
the University is not only possi
ble, it is also being actively
sought. Efforts to communicate
with student members of the
Stanford Committee for Peace
in Vietnam prior to and during
the sit-in are a case in point.
On Tuesday afternoon, May
17, when President Sterling was
attending the Academic Council
Meeting, a letter addressed to
him from the Steering Commit
tee of the SCPV was hand-de
livered by Randolf Bonner to
the President's Executive As
sistant, Frederic Glover. This
letter announced that the SCPV
was calling a special meeting of
the "entire community of schol
ars" at noon on Thursday, May
19, and invited President Ster
ling to speak at this meeting.
Mr. Glover read the letter and
informed Mr. Bonner that it
would be impossible for the
President to speak at such a
meeting because he would be
attending meetings of the Board
of Trustees all day on Thurs
day. Mr. Glover also told Mr.
Bonner that the Committee
would receive a response direct
ly from the President.
On Wednesday, May 18, the
following letter was addressed
to the Stanford Committee for

Peace in Vietnam, Box 2684,
Stanford, California:

meeting was brought into the
discussion. It was pointed out
that the President would not be
able to come because he would
be at the Board of Trustees
meeting. Asked if he might
speak in place of the President,
Dean Winbigler said that he
also had a prior obligation (to
attend the Board of Trustees
meeting).
Shortly after the sit-in group
arrived in the President's Office,
I informed them that President
Sterling would be willing to
meet with representatives of
their group in a private discus
sion, but that the President
would not agree to such a meet
ing under conditions of duress.
This offer of direct communica
tion with President Sterling was
rejected by the spokesman for
the sit-in group.
The President's offer to meet
with delegates of the group was
left open throughout the sit-in
period and the group was re
minded that the offer stood by
Dean Smith as well as by me.
Moreover, the previous offer to
discuss made by President Ster
ling in his letter of May 18 is
still open and has not received a
direct response, written or other
wise, from SCPV.

• Unnerving
Editor, The Daily:
Miss Charyn's letter (The
Daily, May 24) if not written
unthinkingly in a moment of
anger, contains a very unnerv
ing line of thought. If a ma
jority of the people on campus
viewed her "tired protestors"
with the same narrowness of
mind that she condemns the fra
ternity system, water balloons
would have been the least of the
protestors' worries.
The actions she deplores may
have been irrational and unpar
donable, but no more so than
her own unwarranted generali
zation denouncing the entire
fraternity system, and probably
in her own mind, all the Stan
ford houses and the people in
them.
The incident is trivial, and I
don't wish to magnify it here,
nor to go into an elaborate de
fense of the Stanford fraternity:
it does, however, seem a shame
that someone who, as I would
gather from her stand, professes
a liberal view and wants open
minded discussion should be so
limited in her outlook.
With all the issues that have
faced and are facing the Stan
ford community at this time,
I think we all could stand to
examine our own thinking and
try to discover just how liberal
and just how open-minded we
really are.

• A Bigger Rally
Editor, The Daily:
I was disturbed by the inac
curacy on Saturday's protest
against napalm in Redwood
City, at which Senator Wayne
Morse will speak (Daily, May
25).
The story implied, inadvert
antly I am sure, that the protest
is being organized by and might
primarily include members of
the Stanford-Faculty-Staff Com
mittee for Peace in Vietnam.
This is not the case.
The protest, part of "National
Anti-Napalm Day" has been or
ganized by the Bay Area Coor
dinating Committee for Peace
in Vietnam, of which the Facul
ty-Staff Committee may be a
member. (I don't believe they
have taken much part in the
planning of the rally.)
Members of the Coordinating
Committee include the Vietnam
Day committees at Berkeley,
San Francisco State, and San
Jose State, the Haight-Ashbury
Committee in San Francisco,
Concerned Citizens of San Ma
teo, Concerned Citizens of Palo
Alto, the Redwood City Commit
tee Against Napalm, the San
Jose Peace Center, and the Stan
ford Committee for Peace in
Vietnam (SCPV).
Other demonstrations against
napalm Saturday will occur in
Brooklyn, N. Y., Torrence, Cal.,
and West Hartford, Conn.
The SCPV began Bay Area
action against napalm in Janu
ary, and we have been joined
since then by the San Jose
groups, the Concerned Citizens
groups, and the Redwood City
Committee. I am glad the Stan
ford Faculty-Staff Committee
plans to take part Saturday.

• A Fine Letter
Editor, The Daily:
Phil O'Donnell's letter in Tues
day's Daily was one of the fin
est, most thoughtful statements
I have ever read.
For those of us who desire
greater and more meaningful
student participation in the de
velopment of the university, but
who question the use of certain
methods in pursuit of that end,
Mr. O'Donnell's candid and pen
etrating criticism of the recent
sit-in (in which he too partici
pated) represents a significant
forward step in the movement
towards student rights and re
sponsibilities.
I urge everyone associated
with Stanford — students, fac
ulty, administration, alumni,
parents—to read Mr. O'Donnell's
letter. If all of us could be as
objective and self-searching as
he appears to be, the so-called
student movement would both
regain some of its lost luster
and also proceed With greater
speed and determination.

•Who's Arrogant?
Editor, The Daily:
Tuesday's editorial referred to
the "arrogant refusal" of the
President or a representative to
participate in an open meeting
on the selective service issue.
May I suggest that the real ar
rogance was the disdainful re
fusal of the sit-ins to agree first
to a private meeting; to attempt,
as it were, to settle the case out
of court.
That the protestors may have
been in error (Heaven forbid)
was conceded, after more ma
ture consideration, by at least
one fair - minded participant,
Phil O'Donnell, whose Letter to
the Editor appeared alongside
the editorial referred to.
The letter states: "Our initial
rejection of President Sterling's
offer for a closed meeting was
most regrettable as it gave the
impression that we were totally
unwilling to compromise." It
certainly did. How else could
this disdainful refusal be inter
preted but as unacceptable arro
gance on the part of the sit-ins.
May I suggest that the edito
rial itself revealed anything but
an open mind. Perhaps we need
a competitive newspaper on the
campus.
ARTHUR D. HOWARD
Professor of Geology
(Editor's note: Prof. Howard,
by using the old trick of quoting
out of context, twists the mean
ing of Mr. O'Donnell's state
ment, and in the process con
trives a nonexistent conflict be
tween Mr. O'Donnell and The
Daily.
Mr. O'Donnel wrote:
"Our initial rejection of Presi
dent Sterling's offer for a closed
meeting was most regrettable as
it gave the impression that we,
were totally unwilling to com
promise. Such was not the case.
Our feeling was that those few
chosen by us to stick their necks
out, would be singled out for
harsher punishment."
Prof. Howard will note that
The Daily expressed a not unre
lated sentiment: that, the Presi
dent, when meeting with stu
dents behind closed doors, often
exhibits "little genuine under
standing" and "not a little an
ger."
The editorial further men
tinned that by Friday, the sit

iners had dropped all their de

very reasonable request that ei
ther President Sterling or his
representative participate in an
open meeting- to discuss decision

If that isn't compromise, pray

• More Hurt Than Help
Editor, The Daily:
Although we favor liberaliza
tion of University policy con
cerning open houses, we object
to LASSU's tactics in forcing
the issue through their resolu
tion calling for non-enforcement
of present policy by the Judicial
and Women's Councils.
LASSU has justified their
stand by saying that the Com
mittee of Affairs and Services
failed to act on a proposal they
set before them last January.
This may be true, but during
that time the Committee was in
volved with the final stages of
the new liquor policy. Also
LASSU claims their resolution is
aimed at gaining more resopnsi
bility for students and yet they
have relinquished student re
sponsibility and punitive power
to those members of the faculty
and staff who will now enforce
University policy.
We suggest that LASSU's
rash tactics have hurt far more
than helped the Open House is

•What's His Story?
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to thank Mr.
George Porter for his informa
tive litter of Monday, May 23.
I have been interested in Amer
ican studies for seven or eight
years and have never realized
that "competitive athletics char
acterized by the principles of
Christian morality and ethical
behavior" were "the principles
upon which this country was
founded."
I would like to see Mr. Porter's
sources, and I further wonder if
he could answer a couple of
questions that have been bother
ing me lately. What was Jona
than Edward's best time in the
100 yard dash, and was it better
than Cotton Mather's? Also,
who were the also-rans behind
George Washington in the 1754

• What Price Victory ?
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Porter's skill in varsity
track is surpassed only by his
lack of understanding of the
goals of athletics. In the past
athletics have aspired to develop
the man, not destroy him.
Mr. Porter's demands for "to
tal loyalty, total respect, and to
tal obedience" not only under
mine the individual but athletics
itself.
Should these be the "price" of
victory?

• Save Us From Alums
Editor, The Daily:
Monday we read a letter in
The Daily from the alumnus.
We were so irritated that we
promptly wrote a letter which
pointed out some of his ridicu
lous notions. We basically
thought it was cute aside from
being intensely sarcastic.
But the letter was very imma
ture in the sense that in was
only griping, and what good will
mere griping do? It is only too
obvious from the other letters
of the last two or three weeks
that many of our alumni are
making value judgments on the
basis of events which they admit
they know nothing about.
How does the alumni find out
what is really happening on
campus? Does he read the ac
count of how Stanford is sick
written by a yellow press jour
nalist, does he keep an ear out
for the gossip from other
equally poorly informed alumni,
or can he ever hope to assimilate
even a trace of the actual feel
ings that exist on campus from
The Daily?
After all this Ls a student pa
per, not an alumni paper. Then
how can we protect ourselves
from people who call us sinful
for electing a president which
they know nothing about?
We ask the administration,
faculty, students, and alumni if
there is a way that we can keep
alumni informed, to let them
know what is really happening
on campus, and to let them
know what the majority of the
students who do care about their
education actually think?

Health Service
Editor, The Daily:
It seems important to me that
the students of this University
understand that it was not a
failure in communication be
tween the President's Office and
the SCPV that led to the recent
sit-in. It seems even more im
portant that students under
stand that communication be

the faculty, and the officers of
the University is not only possi
ble, it is also being actively
sought. Efforts to communicate
with student members of the
Stanford Committee for Peace
in Vietnam prior to and during
the sit-in are a case in point.
On Tuesday afternoon, May
17, when President Sterling was
attending the Academic Council
Meeting, a letter addressed to
him from the Steering Commit
tee of the SCPV was hand-de
livered by Randolf Bonner to
the President's Executive As
sistant, Frederic Glover. This
letter announced that the SCPV
was calling a special meeting of
the "entire community of schol
ars" at noon on Thursday, May
19, and invited President Ster

Mr. Glover read the letter and
informed Mr. Bonner that it
would be impossible for the
President to speak at such a
meeting because he would be
attending meetings of the Board
of Trustees all day on Thurs
day. Mr. Glover also told Mr.
Bonner that the Committee
would receive a response direct

On Wednesday, May 18, the

to the Stanford Committee for

Peace in Vietnam, Box 2684,
Stanford, California:
Gentlemen:
Thank you for your letters
of May 16 and 17.
University policy towards
Selective Service procedures
is under review by the Aca

this matter and recommenda

May I point out to you that
those members of the Stan

are free to participate, in the
Council's discussion; it is pos

Also late on Wednesday after

of Students Joel Smith met with
Keith Lowe, David Ransom, and

would have been the least of the
protestors' worries.
The actions she deplores may
have been irrational and unpar
donable, but no more so than
her own unwarranted generali
zation denouncing the entire
fraternity system, and probably
in her own mind, all the Stan
ford houses and the people in
them.
The incident is trivial, and I
don't wish to magnify it here,
nor to go into an elaborate de
fense of the Stanford fraternity:
it does, however, seem a shame
that someone who, as I would
gather from her stand, professes
a liberal view and wants open
minded discussion should be so
limited in her outlook.
With all the issues that have
faced and are facing the Stan
ford community at this time,
I think we all could stand to
examine our own thinking and
try to discover just how liberal
and just how open-minded we
really are.

• A Bigger Rally
Editor, The Daily:
I was disturbed by the inac
curacy on Saturday's protest
against napalm in Redwood
City, at which Senator Wayne
Morse will speak (Daily, May
25).
The story implied, inadvert
antly I am sure, that the protest
is being organized by and might
primarily include members of
the Stanford-Faculty-Staff Com
mittee for Peace in Vietnam.
This is not the case.
The protest, part of "National
Anti-Napalm Day" has been or
ganized by the Bay Area Coor
dinating Committee for Peace
in Vietnam, of which the Facul
ty-Staff Committee may be a
member. (I don't believe they
have taken much part in the
planning of the rally.)
Members of the Coordinating
Committee include the Vietnam
Day committees at Berkeley,
San Francisco State, and San
Jose State, the Haight-Ashbury
Committee in San Francisco,
Concerned Citizens of San Ma
teo, Concerned Citizens of Palo
Alto, the Redwood City Commit
tee Against Napalm, the San
Jose Peace Center, and the Stan
ford Committee for Peace in
Vietnam (SCPV).
Other demonstrations against
napalm Saturday will occur in
Brooklyn, N. Y., Torrence, Cal.,
and West Hartford, Conn.
The SCPV began Bay Area
action against napalm in Janu
ary, and we have been joined
since then by the San Jose
groups, the Concerned Citizens
groups, and the Redwood City
Committee. I am glad the Stan
ford Faculty-Staff Committee
plans to take part Saturday.

• A Fine Letter
Editor, The Daily:
Phil O'Donnell's letter in Tues
day's Daily was one of the fin
est, most thoughtful statements
I have ever read.
For those of us who desire
greater and more meaningful
student participation in the de
velopment of the university, but
who question the use of certain
methods in pursuit of that end,
Mr. O'Donnell's candid and pen
etrating criticism of the recent
sit-in (in which he too partici
pated) represents a significant
forward step in the movement
towards student rights and re
sponsibilities.
I urge everyone associated
with Stanford — students, fac
ulty, administration, alumni,
parents—to read Mr. O'Donnell's
letter. If all of us could be as
objective and self-searching as
he appears to be, the so-called
student movement would both
regain some of its lost luster
and also proceed With greater
speed and determination.

•Who's Arrogant?
Editor, The Daily:
Tuesday's editorial referred to
the "arrogant refusal" of the
President or a representative to
participate in an open meeting
on the selective service issue.
May I suggest that the real ar
rogance was the disdainful re
fusal of the sit-ins to agree first
to a private meeting; to attempt,
as it were, to settle the case out
of court.
That the protestors may have
been in error (Heaven forbid)
was conceded, after more ma
ture consideration, by at least
one fair - minded participant,
Phil O'Donnell, whose Letter to
the Editor appeared alongside
the editorial referred to.
The letter states: "Our initial
rejection of President Sterling's
offer for a closed meeting was
most regrettable as it gave the
impression that we were totally
unwilling to compromise." It
certainly did. How else could
this disdainful refusal be inter
preted but as unacceptable arro
gance on the part of the sit-ins.
May I suggest that the edito
rial itself revealed anything but
an open mind. Perhaps we need
a competitive newspaper on the
campus.
ARTHUR D. HOWARD
Professor of Geology
(Editor's note: Prof. Howard,
by using the old trick of quoting
out of context, twists the mean
ing of Mr. O'Donnell's state
ment, and in the process con
trives a nonexistent conflict be
tween Mr. O'Donnell and The
Daily.
Mr. O'Donnel wrote:
"Our initial rejection of Presi
dent Sterling's offer for a closed
meeting was most regrettable as
it gave the impression that we,
were totally unwilling to com
promise. Such was not the case.
Our feeling was that those few
chosen by us to stick their necks
out, would be singled out for
harsher punishment."
Prof. Howard will note that
The Daily expressed a not unre
lated sentiment: that, the Presi
dent, when meeting with stu
dents behind closed doors, often
exhibits "little genuine under
standing" and "not a little an
ger."
The editorial further men
tinned that by Friday, the sit

iners had dropped all their de
mands, with the exception of a
very reasonable request that ei
ther President Sterling or his
representative participate in an
open meeting- to discuss decision

If that isn't compromise, pray

• More Hurt Than Help
Editor, The Daily:
Although we favor liberaliza
tion of University policy con
cerning open houses, we object
to LASSU's tactics in forcing
the issue through their resolu
tion calling for non-enforcement
of present policy by the Judicial
and Women's Councils.
LASSU has justified their
stand by saying that the Com
mittee of Affairs and Services
failed to act on a proposal they
set before them last January.
This may be true, but during
that time the Committee was in
volved with the final stages of
the new liquor policy. Also
LASSU claims their resolution is
aimed at gaining more resopnsi
bility for students and yet they
have relinquished student re
sponsibility and punitive power
to those members of the faculty
and staff who will now enforce
University policy.
We suggest that LASSU's
rash tactics have hurt far more
than helped the Open House is

•What's His Story?
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to thank Mr.
George Porter for his informa
tive litter of Monday, May 23.
I have been interested in Amer
ican studies for seven or eight
years and have never realized
that "competitive athletics char
acterized by the principles of
Christian morality and ethical
behavior" were "the principles
upon which this country was
founded."
I would like to see Mr. Porter's
sources, and I further wonder if
he could answer a couple of
questions that have been bother
ing me lately. What was Jona
than Edward's best time in the
100 yard dash, and was it better
than Cotton Mather's? Also,
who were the also-rans behind
George Washington in the 1754

• What Price Victory ?
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Porter's skill in varsity
track is surpassed only by his
lack of understanding of the
goals of athletics. In the past
athletics have aspired to develop
the man, not destroy him.
Mr. Porter's demands for "to
tal loyalty, total respect, and to
tal obedience" not only under
mine the individual but athletics
itself.
Should these be the "price" of
victory?

• Save Us From Alums
Editor, The Daily:
Monday we read a letter in
The Daily from the alumnus.
We were so irritated that we
promptly wrote a letter which
pointed out some of his ridicu
lous notions. We basically
thought it was cute aside from
being intensely sarcastic.
But the letter was very imma
ture in the sense that in was
only griping, and what good will
mere griping do? It is only too
obvious from the other letters
of the last two or three weeks
that many of our alumni are
making value judgments on the
basis of events which they admit
they know nothing about.
How does the alumni find out
what is really happening on
campus? Does he read the ac
count of how Stanford is sick
written by a yellow press jour
nalist, does he keep an ear out
for the gossip from other
equally poorly informed alumni,
or can he ever hope to assimilate
even a trace of the actual feel
ings that exist on campus from
The Daily?
After all this Ls a student pa
per, not an alumni paper. Then
how can we protect ourselves
from people who call us sinful
for electing a president which
they know nothing about?
We ask the administration,
faculty, students, and alumni if
there is a way that we can keep
alumni informed, to let them
know what is really happening
on campus, and to let them
know what the majority of the
students who do care about their
education actually think?

In his letter, in regard to the
recommendation that all male

fortune, and anguish: birth con

JAMES A. PAULSEN, M.D.
Health Service
Editor, The Daily:
It seems important to me that
the students of this University
understand that it was not a
failure in communication be
tween the President's Office and
the SCPV that led to the recent
sit-in. It seems even more im
portant that students under
stand that communication be
tween them and the President,
the faculty, and the officers of
the University is not only possi
ble, it is also being actively
sought. Efforts to communicate
with student members of the
Stanford Committee for Peace
in Vietnam prior to and during
the sit-in are a case in point.
On Tuesday afternoon, May
17, when President Sterling was
attending the Academic Council
Meeting, a letter addressed to
him from the Steering Commit
tee of the SCPV was hand-de
livered by Randolf Bonner to
the President's Executive As
sistant, Frederic Glover. This
letter announced that the SCPV
was calling a special meeting of
the "entire community of schol
ars" at noon on Thursday, May
19, and invited President Ster
ling to speak at this meeting.
Mr. Glover read the letter and
informed Mr. Bonner that it
would be impossible for the
President to speak at such a
meeting because he would be
attending meetings of the Board
of Trustees all day on Thurs
day. Mr. Glover also told Mr.
Bonner that the Committee
would receive a response direct
ly from the President.
On Wednesday, May 18, the
following letter was addressed
to the Stanford Committee for

Peace in Vietnam, Box 2684,
Stanford, California:
Gentlemen:
Thank you for your letters
of May 16 and 17.
University policy towards
Selective Service procedures
is under review by the Aca
demic Council. When the Aca
demic Council has acted on
this matter and recommenda
tions have been made to Uni
versity officers who are
charged with responsibility of
administering' University pol
icy, I shall be glad to discuss
the decision with representa
tives of your Committee or to
see that this is done by appro
priate officers of the Univer
sity.
May I point out to you that
those members of the Stan
ford Committee for Peace in
Viet Nam who are also mem
bers of the Academic Council
are free to participate, in the
Council's discussion; it is pos
sible therefore that your Com
mittee's point of view will be
represented there.
Sincerely,
J. E. Wallace Sterling
Also late on Wednesday after
noon, Dean of Students Donald
Winbigler and Associate Dean
of Students Joel Smith met with
Keith Lowe, David Ransom, and
Craig Laudon of the SCPV. This
meeting had been initiated by
Dean Smith. He had done so in
the hope that accurate informa
tion about the University's rela
tion to the Selective Service
System and the reasons for of
fering the use of Stanford fa
cilities for the Selective Service
tests would remove any misun
derstanding about this relation
ship and the tests.
The matter of the SCPV's in
vitation to President Sterling to
address the Thursday noon
meeting was brought into the
discussion. It was pointed out
that the President would not be
able to come because he would
be at the Board of Trustees
meeting. Asked if he might
speak in place of the President,
Dean Winbigler said that he
also had a prior obligation (to
attend the Board of Trustees
meeting).
Shortly after the sit-in group
arrived in the President's Office,
I informed them that President
Sterling would be willing to
meet with representatives of
their group in a private discus
sion, but that the President
would not agree to such a meet
ing under conditions of duress.
This offer of direct communica
tion with President Sterling was
rejected by the spokesman for
the sit-in group.
The President's offer to meet
with delegates of the group was
left open throughout the sit-in
period and the group was re
minded that the offer stood by
Dean Smith as well as by me.
Moreover, the previous offer to
discuss made by President Ster
ling in his letter of May 18 is
still open and has not received a
direct response, written or other
wise, from SCPV.

• A Fine Letter
Editor, The Daily:
Phil O'Donnell's letter in Tues
day's Daily was one of the fin
est, most thoughtful statements
I have ever read.
For those of us who desire
greater and more meaningful
student participation in the de
velopment of the university, but
who question the use of certain
methods in pursuit of that end,
Mr. O'Donnell's candid and pen
etrating criticism of the recent
sit-in (in which he too partici
pated) represents a significant
forward step in the movement
towards student rights and re
sponsibilities.
I urge everyone associated
with Stanford — students, fac
ulty, administration, alumni,
parents—to read Mr. O'Donnell's
letter. If all of us could be as
objective and self-searching as
he appears to be, the so-called
student movement would both
regain some of its lost luster
and also proceed With greater
speed and determination.

•Who's Arrogant?
Editor, The Daily:
Tuesday's editorial referred to
the "arrogant refusal" of the
President or a representative to
participate in an open meeting
on the selective service issue.
May I suggest that the real ar
rogance was the disdainful re
fusal of the sit-ins to agree first
to a private meeting; to attempt,
as it were, to settle the case out
of court.
That the protestors may have
been in error (Heaven forbid)
was conceded, after more ma
ture consideration, by at least
one fair - minded participant,
Phil O'Donnell, whose Letter to
the Editor appeared alongside
the editorial referred to.
The letter states: "Our initial
rejection of President Sterling's
offer for a closed meeting was
most regrettable as it gave the
impression that we were totally
unwilling to compromise." It
certainly did. How else could
this disdainful refusal be inter
preted but as unacceptable arro
gance on the part of the sit-ins.
May I suggest that the edito
rial itself revealed anything but
an open mind. Perhaps we need
a competitive newspaper on the
campus.
ARTHUR D. HOWARD
Professor of Geology
(Editor's note: Prof. Howard,
by using the old trick of quoting
out of context, twists the mean
ing of Mr. O'Donnell's state
ment, and in the process con
trives a nonexistent conflict be
tween Mr. O'Donnell and The
Daily.
Mr. O'Donnel wrote:
"Our initial rejection of Presi
dent Sterling's offer for a closed
meeting was most regrettable as
it gave the impression that we,
were totally unwilling to com
promise. Such was not the case.
Our feeling was that those few
chosen by us to stick their necks
out, would be singled out for
harsher punishment."
Prof. Howard will note that
The Daily expressed a not unre
lated sentiment: that, the Presi
dent, when meeting with stu
dents behind closed doors, often
exhibits "little genuine under
standing" and "not a little an
ger."
The editorial further men
tinned that by Friday, the sit

iners had dropped all their de
mands, with the exception of a
very reasonable request that ei
ther President Sterling or his
representative participate in an
open meeting- to discuss decision
making at Stanford.
If that isn't compromise, pray
tell what is?)
• More Hurt Than Help
Editor, The Daily:
Although we favor liberaliza
tion of University policy con
cerning open houses, we object
to LASSU's tactics in forcing
the issue through their resolu
tion calling for non-enforcement
of present policy by the Judicial
and Women's Councils.
LASSU has justified their
stand by saying that the Com
mittee of Affairs and Services
failed to act on a proposal they
set before them last January.
This may be true, but during
that time the Committee was in
volved with the final stages of
the new liquor policy. Also
LASSU claims their resolution is
aimed at gaining more resopnsi
bility for students and yet they
have relinquished student re
sponsibility and punitive power
to those members of the faculty
and staff who will now enforce
University policy.
We suggest that LASSU's
rash tactics have hurt far more
than helped the Open House is
sue.

•What's His Story?
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to thank Mr.
George Porter for his informa
tive litter of Monday, May 23.
I have been interested in Amer
ican studies for seven or eight
years and have never realized
that "competitive athletics char
acterized by the principles of
Christian morality and ethical
behavior" were "the principles
upon which this country was
founded."
I would like to see Mr. Porter's
sources, and I further wonder if
he could answer a couple of
questions that have been bother
ing me lately. What was Jona
than Edward's best time in the
100 yard dash, and was it better
than Cotton Mather's? Also,
who were the also-rans behind
George Washington in the 1754

• What Price Victory ?
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Porter's skill in varsity
track is surpassed only by his
lack of understanding of the
goals of athletics. In the past
athletics have aspired to develop
the man, not destroy him.
Mr. Porter's demands for "to
tal loyalty, total respect, and to
tal obedience" not only under
mine the individual but athletics
itself.
Should these be the "price" of
victory?

• Save Us From Alums
Editor, The Daily:
Monday we read a letter in
The Daily from the alumnus.
We were so irritated that we
promptly wrote a letter which
pointed out some of his ridicu
lous notions. We basically
thought it was cute aside from
being intensely sarcastic.
But the letter was very imma
ture in the sense that in was
only griping, and what good will
mere griping do? It is only too
obvious from the other letters
of the last two or three weeks
that many of our alumni are
making value judgments on the
basis of events which they admit
they know nothing about.
How does the alumni find out
what is really happening on
campus? Does he read the ac
count of how Stanford is sick
written by a yellow press jour
nalist, does he keep an ear out
for the gossip from other
equally poorly informed alumni,
or can he ever hope to assimilate
even a trace of the actual feel
ings that exist on campus from
The Daily?
After all this Ls a student pa
per, not an alumni paper. Then
how can we protect ourselves
from people who call us sinful
for electing a president which
they know nothing about?
We ask the administration,
faculty, students, and alumni if
there is a way that we can keep
alumni informed, to let them
know what is really happening
on campus, and to let them
know what the majority of the
students who do care about their
education actually think?

• Retroactive Pill
Editor, The Daily:
In his letter, in regard to the
recommendation that all male
students have vasectomies (The

wittingly points to an even
greater area of dilemma, mis
fortune, and anguish: birth con
trol cannot be made retroactive!
JAMES A. PAULSEN, M.D.
Health Service
Editor, The Daily:
It seems important to me that
the students of this University
understand that it was not a
failure in communication be
tween the President's Office and
the SCPV that led to the recent
sit-in. It seems even more im
portant that students under
stand that communication be
tween them and the President,
the faculty, and the officers of
the University is not only possi
ble, it is also being actively
sought. Efforts to communicate
with student members of the
Stanford Committee for Peace
in Vietnam prior to and during
the sit-in are a case in point.
On Tuesday afternoon, May
17, when President Sterling was
attending the Academic Council
Meeting, a letter addressed to
him from the Steering Commit
tee of the SCPV was hand-de
livered by Randolf Bonner to
the President's Executive As
sistant, Frederic Glover. This
letter announced that the SCPV
was calling a special meeting of
the "entire community of schol
ars" at noon on Thursday, May
19, and invited President Ster
ling to speak at this meeting.
Mr. Glover read the letter and
informed Mr. Bonner that it
would be impossible for the
President to speak at such a
meeting because he would be
attending meetings of the Board
of Trustees all day on Thurs
day. Mr. Glover also told Mr.
Bonner that the Committee
would receive a response direct
ly from the President.
On Wednesday, May 18, the
following letter was addressed
to the Stanford Committee for

Peace in Vietnam, Box 2684,
Stanford, California:
Gentlemen:
Thank you for your letters
of May 16 and 17.
University policy towards
Selective Service procedures
is under review by the Aca
demic Council. When the Aca
demic Council has acted on
this matter and recommenda
tions have been made to Uni
versity officers who are
charged with responsibility of
administering' University pol
icy, I shall be glad to discuss
the decision with representa
tives of your Committee or to
see that this is done by appro
priate officers of the Univer
sity.
May I point out to you that
those members of the Stan
ford Committee for Peace in
Viet Nam who are also mem
bers of the Academic Council
are free to participate, in the
Council's discussion; it is pos
sible therefore that your Com
mittee's point of view will be
represented there.
Sincerely,
J. E. Wallace Sterling
Also late on Wednesday after
noon, Dean of Students Donald
Winbigler and Associate Dean
of Students Joel Smith met with
Keith Lowe, David Ransom, and
Craig Laudon of the SCPV. This
meeting had been initiated by
Dean Smith. He had done so in
the hope that accurate informa
tion about the University's rela
tion to the Selective Service
System and the reasons for of
fering the use of Stanford fa
cilities for the Selective Service
tests would remove any misun
derstanding about this relation
ship and the tests.
The matter of the SCPV's in
vitation to President Sterling to
address the Thursday noon
meeting was brought into the
discussion. It was pointed out
that the President would not be
able to come because he would
be at the Board of Trustees
meeting. Asked if he might
speak in place of the President,
Dean Winbigler said that he
also had a prior obligation (to
attend the Board of Trustees
meeting).
Shortly after the sit-in group
arrived in the President's Office,
I informed them that President
Sterling would be willing to
meet with representatives of
their group in a private discus
sion, but that the President
would not agree to such a meet
ing under conditions of duress.
This offer of direct communica
tion with President Sterling was
rejected by the spokesman for
the sit-in group.
The President's offer to meet
with delegates of the group was
left open throughout the sit-in
period and the group was re
minded that the offer stood by
Dean Smith as well as by me.
Moreover, the previous offer to
discuss made by President Ster
ling in his letter of May 18 is
still open and has not received a
direct response, written or other
wise, from SCPV.

• Unnerving
Editor, The Daily:
Miss Charyn's letter (The
Daily, May 24) if not written
unthinkingly in a moment of
anger, contains a very unnerv
ing line of thought. If a ma
jority of the people on campus
viewed her "tired protestors"
with the same narrowness of
mind that she condemns the fra
ternity system, water balloons
would have been the least of the
protestors' worries.
The actions she deplores may
have been irrational and unpar
donable, but no more so than
her own unwarranted generali
zation denouncing the entire
fraternity system, and probably
in her own mind, all the Stan
ford houses and the people in
them.
The incident is trivial, and I
don't wish to magnify it here,
nor to go into an elaborate de
fense of the Stanford fraternity:
it does, however, seem a shame
that someone who, as I would
gather from her stand, professes
a liberal view and wants open
minded discussion should be so
limited in her outlook.
With all the issues that have
faced and are facing the Stan
ford community at this time,
I think we all could stand to
examine our own thinking and
try to discover just how liberal
and just how open-minded we
really are.

•Who's Arrogant?
Editor, The Daily:
Tuesday's editorial referred to
the "arrogant refusal" of the
President or a representative to
participate in an open meeting
on the selective service issue.
May I suggest that the real ar
rogance was the disdainful re
fusal of the sit-ins to agree first
to a private meeting; to attempt,
as it were, to settle the case out
of court.
That the protestors may have
been in error (Heaven forbid)
was conceded, after more ma
ture consideration, by at least
one fair - minded participant,
Phil O'Donnell, whose Letter to
the Editor appeared alongside
the editorial referred to.
The letter states: "Our initial
rejection of President Sterling's
offer for a closed meeting was
most regrettable as it gave the
impression that we were totally
unwilling to compromise." It
certainly did. How else could
this disdainful refusal be inter
preted but as unacceptable arro
gance on the part of the sit-ins.
May I suggest that the edito
rial itself revealed anything but
an open mind. Perhaps we need
a competitive newspaper on the
campus.

(Editor's note: Prof. Howard,
by using the old trick of quoting

Mr. O'Donnel wrote:
"Our initial rejection of Presi

Our feeling was that those few

harsher punishment."
Prof. Howard will note that
The Daily expressed a not unre

dents behind closed doors, often
exhibits "little genuine under
standing" and "not a little an

The editorial further men
tinned that by Friday, the sit

very reasonable request that ei

• More Hurt Than Help
Editor, The Daily:
Although we favor liberaliza
tion of University policy con
cerning open houses, we object
to LASSU's tactics in forcing
the issue through their resolu
tion calling for non-enforcement
of present policy by the Judicial
and Women's Councils.
LASSU has justified their
stand by saying that the Com
mittee of Affairs and Services
failed to act on a proposal they
set before them last January.
This may be true, but during
that time the Committee was in
volved with the final stages of
the new liquor policy. Also
LASSU claims their resolution is
aimed at gaining more resopnsi
bility for students and yet they
have relinquished student re
sponsibility and punitive power
to those members of the faculty
and staff who will now enforce
University policy.
We suggest that LASSU's
rash tactics have hurt far more
than helped the Open House is
sue.

•What's His Story?
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to thank Mr.
George Porter for his informa
tive litter of Monday, May 23.
I have been interested in Amer
ican studies for seven or eight
years and have never realized
that "competitive athletics char
acterized by the principles of
Christian morality and ethical
behavior" were "the principles
upon which this country was
founded."
I would like to see Mr. Porter's
sources, and I further wonder if
he could answer a couple of
questions that have been bother
ing me lately. What was Jona
than Edward's best time in the
100 yard dash, and was it better
than Cotton Mather's? Also,
who were the also-rans behind
George Washington in the 1754

• What Price Victory ?
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Porter's skill in varsity
track is surpassed only by his
lack of understanding of the
goals of athletics. In the past
athletics have aspired to develop
the man, not destroy him.
Mr. Porter's demands for "to
tal loyalty, total respect, and to
tal obedience" not only under
mine the individual but athletics
itself.
Should these be the "price" of
victory?

• Save Us From Alums
Editor, The Daily:
Monday we read a letter in
The Daily from the alumnus.
We were so irritated that we
promptly wrote a letter which
pointed out some of his ridicu
lous notions. We basically
thought it was cute aside from
being intensely sarcastic.
But the letter was very imma
ture in the sense that in was
only griping, and what good will
mere griping do? It is only too
obvious from the other letters
of the last two or three weeks
that many of our alumni are
making value judgments on the
basis of events which they admit
they know nothing about.
How does the alumni find out
what is really happening on
campus? Does he read the ac
count of how Stanford is sick
written by a yellow press jour
nalist, does he keep an ear out
for the gossip from other
equally poorly informed alumni,
or can he ever hope to assimilate
even a trace of the actual feel
ings that exist on campus from
The Daily?
After all this Ls a student pa
per, not an alumni paper. Then
how can we protect ourselves
from people who call us sinful
for electing a president which
they know nothing about?
We ask the administration,
faculty, students, and alumni if
there is a way that we can keep
alumni informed, to let them
know what is really happening
on campus, and to let them
know what the majority of the
students who do care about their
education actually think?

Editor, The Daily:
In his letter, in regard to the
recommendation that all male
students have vasectomies (The

wittingly points to an even
greater area of dilemma, mis
fortune, and anguish: birth con
trol cannot be made retroactive!
JAMES A. PAULSEN, M.D.
Health Service
Editor, The Daily:
It seems important to me that
the students of this University
understand that it was not a
failure in communication be
tween the President's Office and
the SCPV that led to the recent
sit-in. It seems even more im
portant that students under
stand that communication be
tween them and the President,
the faculty, and the officers of
the University is not only possi
ble, it is also being actively
sought. Efforts to communicate
with student members of the
Stanford Committee for Peace
in Vietnam prior to and during
the sit-in are a case in point.
On Tuesday afternoon, May
17, when President Sterling was
attending the Academic Council
Meeting, a letter addressed to
him from the Steering Commit
tee of the SCPV was hand-de
livered by Randolf Bonner to
the President's Executive As
sistant, Frederic Glover. This
letter announced that the SCPV
was calling a special meeting of
the "entire community of schol
ars" at noon on Thursday, May
19, and invited President Ster
ling to speak at this meeting.
Mr. Glover read the letter and
informed Mr. Bonner that it
would be impossible for the
President to speak at such a
meeting because he would be
attending meetings of the Board
of Trustees all day on Thurs
day. Mr. Glover also told Mr.
Bonner that the Committee
would receive a response direct
ly from the President.
On Wednesday, May 18, the
following letter was addressed
to the Stanford Committee for

Peace in Vietnam, Box 2684,
Stanford, California:
Gentlemen:
Thank you for your letters
of May 16 and 17.
University policy towards
Selective Service procedures
is under review by the Aca
demic Council. When the Aca
demic Council has acted on
this matter and recommenda
tions have been made to Uni
versity officers who are
charged with responsibility of
administering' University pol
icy, I shall be glad to discuss
the decision with representa
tives of your Committee or to
see that this is done by appro
priate officers of the Univer
sity.
May I point out to you that
those members of the Stan
ford Committee for Peace in
Viet Nam who are also mem
bers of the Academic Council
are free to participate, in the
Council's discussion; it is pos
sible therefore that your Com
mittee's point of view will be
represented there.
Sincerely,
J. E. Wallace Sterling
Also late on Wednesday after
noon, Dean of Students Donald
Winbigler and Associate Dean
of Students Joel Smith met with
Keith Lowe, David Ransom, and
Craig Laudon of the SCPV. This
meeting had been initiated by
Dean Smith. He had done so in
the hope that accurate informa
tion about the University's rela
tion to the Selective Service
System and the reasons for of
fering the use of Stanford fa
cilities for the Selective Service
tests would remove any misun
derstanding about this relation
ship and the tests.
The matter of the SCPV's in
vitation to President Sterling to
address the Thursday noon
meeting was brought into the
discussion. It was pointed out
that the President would not be
able to come because he would
be at the Board of Trustees
meeting. Asked if he might
speak in place of the President,
Dean Winbigler said that he
also had a prior obligation (to
attend the Board of Trustees
meeting).
Shortly after the sit-in group
arrived in the President's Office,
I informed them that President
Sterling would be willing to
meet with representatives of
their group in a private discus
sion, but that the President
would not agree to such a meet
ing under conditions of duress.
This offer of direct communica
tion with President Sterling was
rejected by the spokesman for
the sit-in group.
The President's offer to meet
with delegates of the group was
left open throughout the sit-in
period and the group was re
minded that the offer stood by
Dean Smith as well as by me.
Moreover, the previous offer to
discuss made by President Ster
ling in his letter of May 18 is
still open and has not received a
direct response, written or other
wise, from SCPV.

• Unnerving
Editor, The Daily:
Miss Charyn's letter (The
Daily, May 24) if not written
unthinkingly in a moment of
anger, contains a very unnerv
ing line of thought. If a ma
jority of the people on campus
viewed her "tired protestors"
with the same narrowness of
mind that she condemns the fra
ternity system, water balloons
would have been the least of the
protestors' worries.
The actions she deplores may
have been irrational and unpar
donable, but no more so than
her own unwarranted generali
zation denouncing the entire
fraternity system, and probably
in her own mind, all the Stan
ford houses and the people in
them.
The incident is trivial, and I
don't wish to magnify it here,
nor to go into an elaborate de
fense of the Stanford fraternity:
it does, however, seem a shame
that someone who, as I would
gather from her stand, professes
a liberal view and wants open
minded discussion should be so
limited in her outlook.
With all the issues that have
faced and are facing the Stan
ford community at this time,
I think we all could stand to
examine our own thinking and
try to discover just how liberal
and just how open-minded we
really are.

• A Bigger Rally
Editor, The Daily:
I was disturbed by the inac

against napalm in Redwood
City, at which Senator Wayne
Morse will speak (Daily, May
25).
The story implied, inadvert
antly I am sure, that the protest
is being organized by and might
primarily include members of
the Stanford-Faculty-Staff Com
mittee for Peace in Vietnam.
This is not the case.
The protest, part of "National
Anti-Napalm Day" has been or
ganized by the Bay Area Coor
dinating Committee for Peace
in Vietnam, of which the Facul
ty-Staff Committee may be a
member. (I don't believe they
have taken much part in the
planning of the rally.)
Members of the Coordinating
Committee include the Vietnam
Day committees at Berkeley,
San Francisco State, and San
Jose State, the Haight-Ashbury
Committee in San Francisco,
Concerned Citizens of San Ma

Jose Peace Center, and the Stan

Vietnam (SCPV).
Other demonstrations against
napalm Saturday will occur in
Brooklyn, N. Y., Torrence, Cal.,
and West Hartford, Conn.
The SCPV began Bay Area
action against napalm in Janu

• More Hurt Than Help
Editor, The Daily:
Although we favor liberaliza
tion of University policy con
cerning open houses, we object
to LASSU's tactics in forcing
the issue through their resolu
tion calling for non-enforcement
of present policy by the Judicial
and Women's Councils.
LASSU has justified their
stand by saying that the Com
mittee of Affairs and Services
failed to act on a proposal they
set before them last January.
This may be true, but during
that time the Committee was in
volved with the final stages of
the new liquor policy. Also
LASSU claims their resolution is
aimed at gaining more resopnsi
bility for students and yet they
have relinquished student re
sponsibility and punitive power
to those members of the faculty
and staff who will now enforce
University policy.
We suggest that LASSU's
rash tactics have hurt far more
than helped the Open House is

•What's His Story?
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to thank Mr.
George Porter for his informa
tive litter of Monday, May 23.
I have been interested in Amer
ican studies for seven or eight
years and have never realized
that "competitive athletics char
acterized by the principles of
Christian morality and ethical
behavior" were "the principles
upon which this country was
founded."
I would like to see Mr. Porter's
sources, and I further wonder if
he could answer a couple of
questions that have been bother
ing me lately. What was Jona
than Edward's best time in the
100 yard dash, and was it better
than Cotton Mather's? Also,
who were the also-rans behind
George Washington in the 1754

• What Price Victory ?
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Porter's skill in varsity
track is surpassed only by his
lack of understanding of the
goals of athletics. In the past
athletics have aspired to develop
the man, not destroy him.
Mr. Porter's demands for "to
tal loyalty, total respect, and to
tal obedience" not only under
mine the individual but athletics
itself.
Should these be the "price" of
victory?

• Save Us From Alums
Editor, The Daily:
Monday we read a letter in
The Daily from the alumnus.
We were so irritated that we
promptly wrote a letter which
pointed out some of his ridicu
lous notions. We basically
thought it was cute aside from
being intensely sarcastic.
But the letter was very imma
ture in the sense that in was
only griping, and what good will
mere griping do? It is only too
obvious from the other letters
of the last two or three weeks
that many of our alumni are
making value judgments on the
basis of events which they admit
they know nothing about.
How does the alumni find out
what is really happening on
campus? Does he read the ac
count of how Stanford is sick
written by a yellow press jour
nalist, does he keep an ear out
for the gossip from other
equally poorly informed alumni,
or can he ever hope to assimilate
even a trace of the actual feel
ings that exist on campus from
The Daily?
After all this Ls a student pa
per, not an alumni paper. Then
how can we protect ourselves
from people who call us sinful
for electing a president which
they know nothing about?
We ask the administration,
faculty, students, and alumni if
there is a way that we can keep
alumni informed, to let them
know what is really happening
on campus, and to let them
know what the majority of the
students who do care about their
education actually think?

Editor, The Daily:
In his letter, in regard to the
recommendation that all male
students have vasectomies (The

wittingly points to an even
greater area of dilemma, mis
fortune, and anguish: birth con
trol cannot be made retroactive!
JAMES A. PAULSEN, M.D.
Health Service
Editor, The Daily:
It seems important to me that
the students of this University
understand that it was not a
failure in communication be
tween the President's Office and
the SCPV that led to the recent
sit-in. It seems even more im
portant that students under
stand that communication be
tween them and the President,
the faculty, and the officers of
the University is not only possi
ble, it is also being actively
sought. Efforts to communicate
with student members of the
Stanford Committee for Peace
in Vietnam prior to and during
the sit-in are a case in point.
On Tuesday afternoon, May
17, when President Sterling was
attending the Academic Council
Meeting, a letter addressed to
him from the Steering Commit
tee of the SCPV was hand-de
livered by Randolf Bonner to
the President's Executive As
sistant, Frederic Glover. This
letter announced that the SCPV
was calling a special meeting of
the "entire community of schol
ars" at noon on Thursday, May
19, and invited President Ster
ling to speak at this meeting.
Mr. Glover read the letter and
informed Mr. Bonner that it
would be impossible for the
President to speak at such a
meeting because he would be
attending meetings of the Board
of Trustees all day on Thurs
day. Mr. Glover also told Mr.
Bonner that the Committee
would receive a response direct
ly from the President.
On Wednesday, May 18, the
following letter was addressed
to the Stanford Committee for

Peace in Vietnam, Box 2684,
Stanford, California:
Gentlemen:
Thank you for your letters
of May 16 and 17.
University policy towards
Selective Service procedures
is under review by the Aca
demic Council. When the Aca
demic Council has acted on
this matter and recommenda
tions have been made to Uni
versity officers who are
charged with responsibility of
administering' University pol
icy, I shall be glad to discuss
the decision with representa
tives of your Committee or to
see that this is done by appro
priate officers of the Univer
sity.
May I point out to you that
those members of the Stan
ford Committee for Peace in
Viet Nam who are also mem
bers of the Academic Council
are free to participate, in the
Council's discussion; it is pos
sible therefore that your Com
mittee's point of view will be
represented there.
Sincerely,
J. E. Wallace Sterling
Also late on Wednesday after
noon, Dean of Students Donald
Winbigler and Associate Dean
of Students Joel Smith met with
Keith Lowe, David Ransom, and
Craig Laudon of the SCPV. This
meeting had been initiated by
Dean Smith. He had done so in
the hope that accurate informa
tion about the University's rela
tion to the Selective Service
System and the reasons for of
fering the use of Stanford fa
cilities for the Selective Service
tests would remove any misun
derstanding about this relation
ship and the tests.
The matter of the SCPV's in
vitation to President Sterling to
address the Thursday noon
meeting was brought into the
discussion. It was pointed out
that the President would not be
able to come because he would
be at the Board of Trustees
meeting. Asked if he might
speak in place of the President,
Dean Winbigler said that he
also had a prior obligation (to
attend the Board of Trustees
meeting).
Shortly after the sit-in group
arrived in the President's Office,
I informed them that President
Sterling would be willing to
meet with representatives of
their group in a private discus
sion, but that the President
would not agree to such a meet
ing under conditions of duress.
This offer of direct communica
tion with President Sterling was
rejected by the spokesman for
the sit-in group.
The President's offer to meet
with delegates of the group was
left open throughout the sit-in
period and the group was re
minded that the offer stood by
Dean Smith as well as by me.
Moreover, the previous offer to
discuss made by President Ster
ling in his letter of May 18 is
still open and has not received a
direct response, written or other
wise, from SCPV.

• Unnerving
Editor, The Daily:
Miss Charyn's letter (The
Daily, May 24) if not written
unthinkingly in a moment of
anger, contains a very unnerv
ing line of thought. If a ma
jority of the people on campus
viewed her "tired protestors"
with the same narrowness of
mind that she condemns the fra
ternity system, water balloons
would have been the least of the
protestors' worries.
The actions she deplores may
have been irrational and unpar
donable, but no more so than
her own unwarranted generali
zation denouncing the entire
fraternity system, and probably
in her own mind, all the Stan
ford houses and the people in
them.
The incident is trivial, and I
don't wish to magnify it here,
nor to go into an elaborate de
fense of the Stanford fraternity:
it does, however, seem a shame
that someone who, as I would
gather from her stand, professes
a liberal view and wants open
minded discussion should be so
limited in her outlook.
With all the issues that have
faced and are facing the Stan
ford community at this time,
I think we all could stand to
examine our own thinking and
try to discover just how liberal
and just how open-minded we
really are.

• A Bigger Rally
Editor, The Daily:
I was disturbed by the inac
curacy on Saturday's protest
against napalm in Redwood
City, at which Senator Wayne
Morse will speak (Daily, May
25).
The story implied, inadvert
antly I am sure, that the protest
is being organized by and might
primarily include members of
the Stanford-Faculty-Staff Com
mittee for Peace in Vietnam.
This is not the case.
The protest, part of "National
Anti-Napalm Day" has been or
ganized by the Bay Area Coor
dinating Committee for Peace
in Vietnam, of which the Facul
ty-Staff Committee may be a
member. (I don't believe they
have taken much part in the
planning of the rally.)
Members of the Coordinating
Committee include the Vietnam
Day committees at Berkeley,
San Francisco State, and San
Jose State, the Haight-Ashbury
Committee in San Francisco,
Concerned Citizens of San Ma
teo, Concerned Citizens of Palo
Alto, the Redwood City Commit
tee Against Napalm, the San
Jose Peace Center, and the Stan
ford Committee for Peace in
Vietnam (SCPV).
Other demonstrations against
napalm Saturday will occur in
Brooklyn, N. Y., Torrence, Cal.,
and West Hartford, Conn.
The SCPV began Bay Area
action against napalm in Janu
ary, and we have been joined
since then by the San Jose

Committee. I am glad the Stan

• A Fine Letter
Editor, The Daily:
Phil O'Donnell's letter in Tues
day's Daily was one of the fin
est, most thoughtful statements
I have ever read.
For those of us who desire
greater and more meaningful
student participation in the de
velopment of the university, but
who question the use of certain
methods in pursuit of that end,
Mr. O'Donnell's candid and pen
etrating criticism of the recent
sit-in (in which he too partici
pated) represents a significant
forward step in the movement
towards student rights and re
sponsibilities.
I urge everyone associated
with Stanford — students, fac
ulty, administration, alumni,
parents—to read Mr. O'Donnell's
letter. If all of us could be as
objective and self-searching as
he appears to be, the so-called
student movement would both
regain some of its lost luster
and also proceed With greater
speed and determination.

•Who's Arrogant?
Editor, The Daily:
Tuesday's editorial referred to
the "arrogant refusal" of the
President or a representative to
participate in an open meeting
on the selective service issue.
May I suggest that the real ar
rogance was the disdainful re
fusal of the sit-ins to agree first
to a private meeting; to attempt,
as it were, to settle the case out
of court.
That the protestors may have
been in error (Heaven forbid)
was conceded, after more ma
ture consideration, by at least
one fair - minded participant,
Phil O'Donnell, whose Letter to
the Editor appeared alongside
the editorial referred to.
The letter states: "Our initial
rejection of President Sterling's
offer for a closed meeting was
most regrettable as it gave the
impression that we were totally
unwilling to compromise." It
certainly did. How else could
this disdainful refusal be inter
preted but as unacceptable arro

and Women's Councils.
LASSU has justified their
stand by saying that the Com
mittee of Affairs and Services
failed to act on a proposal they
set before them last January.
This may be true, but during
that time the Committee was in
volved with the final stages of
the new liquor policy. Also
LASSU claims their resolution is
aimed at gaining more resopnsi
bility for students and yet they
have relinquished student re
sponsibility and punitive power
to those members of the faculty
and staff who will now enforce
University policy.
We suggest that LASSU's
rash tactics have hurt far more
than helped the Open House is
sue.

•What's His Story?
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to thank Mr.
George Porter for his informa
tive litter of Monday, May 23.
I have been interested in Amer
ican studies for seven or eight
years and have never realized
that "competitive athletics char
acterized by the principles of
Christian morality and ethical
behavior" were "the principles
upon which this country was
founded."
I would like to see Mr. Porter's
sources, and I further wonder if
he could answer a couple of
questions that have been bother
ing me lately. What was Jona
than Edward's best time in the
100 yard dash, and was it better
than Cotton Mather's? Also,
who were the also-rans behind
George Washington in the 1754
Rappahannock Silver Dollar
Throw?

• What Price Victory ?
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Porter's skill in varsity
track is surpassed only by his
lack of understanding of the
goals of athletics. In the past
athletics have aspired to develop
the man, not destroy him.
Mr. Porter's demands for "to
tal loyalty, total respect, and to
tal obedience" not only under
mine the individual but athletics
itself.
Should these be the "price" of
victory?

• Save Us From Alums
Editor, The Daily:
Monday we read a letter in
The Daily from the alumnus.
We were so irritated that we
promptly wrote a letter which
pointed out some of his ridicu
lous notions. We basically
thought it was cute aside from
being intensely sarcastic.
But the letter was very imma
ture in the sense that in was
only griping, and what good will
mere griping do? It is only too
obvious from the other letters
of the last two or three weeks
that many of our alumni are
making value judgments on the
basis of events which they admit
they know nothing about.
How does the alumni find out
what is really happening on
campus? Does he read the ac
count of how Stanford is sick
written by a yellow press jour
nalist, does he keep an ear out
for the gossip from other
equally poorly informed alumni,
or can he ever hope to assimilate
even a trace of the actual feel
ings that exist on campus from
The Daily?
After all this Ls a student pa
per, not an alumni paper. Then
how can we protect ourselves
from people who call us sinful
for electing a president which
they know nothing about?
We ask the administration,
faculty, students, and alumni if
there is a way that we can keep
alumni informed, to let them
know what is really happening
on campus, and to let them
know what the majority of the
students who do care about their
education actually think?

• Retroactive Pill
Editor, The Daily:
In his letter, in regard to the
recommendation that all male
students have vasectomies (The
Dally, May 23.) Mr. Gedman un
wittingly points to an even
greater area of dilemma, mis
fortune, and anguish: birth con
trol cannot be made retroactive!
