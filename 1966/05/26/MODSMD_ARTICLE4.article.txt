# Beard Today— Gone Tomorrow
## 
### 
(CPS) — Several members of the
University of Texas chapter of the
Students for a Democratic Society
visited Southwestern Texas Univer
sity in Georgetown last week to talk
with students and gain sympathy
for their anti-war policies.
Upon entering the student union,
they saw a likely group of bearded
faces at a nearby table and went over
to introduce themselves and their
cause. Sure enough, they were well
received and were asked to speak to
the group to which their hosts be
longed.
Monday night they returned to
Georgetown for their scheduled talk
and again were well received. How
ever, this tim° their friends were
beardless.
The explanation: Old South Week
was over and all the members of
Kappa Alpha fraternity had shaved
off their beards.
Now even SDS knows you can't
judge a man by his beard.
