facilities for the national selective
service student deferment tests con
ducted by Science Reseach Associates.
Emphasizing that he spoke only as
an individual, Black said that the
University first learned of the tests
through news accounts in February.
At that time, it was estimated that
up to 5,000 Sanford students might
decide to take the exams, and he felt
an obligation to those students.
Black stressed individual decision
on these moral issues instead of Uni
versity policy. He went on to say that

the tests, as an alternative to class
standing, might actually reduce the
inevitable unjustness of the draft sys
tem and partially eliminate grade
grubbing.
Faculty Response
Herbert L. Packer attended the rally
in response to an invitation from the
rally leaders, and on behalf of the
Executive Committee, explained to
those present the failure of the Com
mittee to take part in the debate.
1. The rally concerned the sit-in, a
Judicial Council problem, and not the
University's policy; therefore, the
Committee's participation in a debate
would have been inappropriate.
2. Since the Committee will discuss
the University's policies in an open
hearing next week, it was "obliged to
refrain from debate on them" at this
time.
Packer went on to say that his pur
pose in attending the rally was to lis
ten and gain insight. He closed with
the Committee's statement, the text
of which appears on page 3 of today's

Emphasizing that he spoke only as
an individual, Black said that the
University first learned of the tests
through news accounts in February.
At that time, it was estimated that
up to 5,000 Sanford students might
decide to take the exams, and he felt
an obligation to those students.
Black stressed individual decision
on these moral issues instead of Uni
versity policy. He went on to say that

the tests, as an alternative to class
standing, might actually reduce the
inevitable unjustness of the draft sys
tem and partially eliminate grade
grubbing.
Faculty Response
Herbert L. Packer attended the rally
in response to an invitation from the
rally leaders, and on behalf of the
Executive Committee, explained to
those present the failure of the Com
mittee to take part in the debate.
1. The rally concerned the sit-in, a
Judicial Council problem, and not the
University's policy; therefore, the
Committee's participation in a debate
would have been inappropriate.
2. Since the Committee will discuss
the University's policies in an open
hearing next week, it was "obliged to
refrain from debate on them" at this
time.
Packer went on to say that his pur
pose in attending the rally was to lis
ten and gain insight. He closed with
the Committee's statement, the text
of which appears on page 3 of today's
