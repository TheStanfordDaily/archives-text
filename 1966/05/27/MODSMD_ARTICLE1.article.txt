# Activist Focus Shifts To Academic Issues
## 
### JIM SELNA Associate Editor 
Stanford's first year of intensive
student activism is drawing to a close,
but few campus leaders believe the
long summer will stem the fresh tide
of student awareness.
Students have made substantial
progress in impressing two things
upon the University, Associate Dean
Joel Smith recently commented.
"They very much want to lead their
own lives," he noted. Secondly, Smith
cited strong student demands to be
heard before basic policy decisions
which have direct impact upon stu
dents are made.
Shifting Focus
"Reaction of students against Uni
versity regulations does not mean stu
dents want to live in some abject or
lascivious way," the Dean observed.
In fact, some student leaders, includ
ing ASSU President Sandy Mackenzie,
believe the University recognition of
student liberties has helped to shift
the focus of student activism to the
question of education.

"The trend is away from the battle
for student liberties," Mackenzie esti
mates. Speaker of the Legislature Jay
Kadane has sighted last year's revi
sion of social regulations as "the first
change that affected peoples lives.
Students have begun to think about
what the rules ought to be."
Toward Academic
While Kadane had hoped the ques
tion of student liberties could be sub
stantially resolved this year, he never
theless maintains "the shift is going
toward academic problems."
Both Mackenzie and Kadane have
pointed out a sharp change in the out
look of the present student from the
views of his predecessor just five
years ago. Students are taking more
seriously the fact that they only have
four years to spend as undergradu
ates, and hence are asking how im
portant their education will be in later
life.
Mackenzie admits student effort to
find a more meaningful education is
a "loose concept, but it is the type of
issue with which people are con

cerned." Some students feel short
changed by the education they are
getting, Kadane asserts.
"Many students are looking for pro
fessors who are not themselves bored
by the classes they teach." In short,
the LASSU Speaker feels students
want "a more fruitful academic at
mosphere."
The question of how to create such
an atmosphere has caused sharp dis
agreement. Last night Kadane told
the final session of the Legislature,
"It is left to the student body to en
courage, to prod, to cajole, to lead,
and sometimes to push (the Adminis
tration and faculty) toward a new and
better Stanford."
Kadane told Tile Daily yesterday
the recent draft protesters could have
chosen their tactics more carefully.
However, he found himself in sym
pathy with the basic feeling of frus
tration which many of the protestors
expressed. "Frustration of their at
tempts to talk with the Administra
tion led to a non-productive regres
sion," he said.

While maintaining the students'
duty to prod the University, Kadane
expressed the necessity for the faculty
to enter into student effort to improve
the quality of education as well as
efforts to gain a greater voice in other
decision-making areas.
Existing Structures
Mackenzie prefers to de-emphasize
recent attempts for change which
have ignored existing structures. Both
the SCVP sit-in and LASSU's enact
ment of a conflict in law raised prob
lems "which could have been solved
in numerous other ways."
If student government is to do more
than simply react to various protests
by campus groups, the outgoing stu
dent body president believes his suc
cessor, David Harris, must concen
trate on a well-defined program bring
ing the main issues into light for an
intelligent discussion.
"The Harris victory showed there
were many people who cared about
the question of education," Mackenzie
noted. The student body, now "much
more aware of its role in the com

munity," has guaranteed that these
issues will be raised and discussed
with Harris in office.
Harris has already begun to heed
Mackenzie's advice to select the major
issues for the year, and then to docu
ment the student case.
However, Dean Smith observes, "We
have not made very much progress—
which we are going to have to make—
in encouraging students to have more
tolerance for other constituencies."
Those other constituencies, the facul
ty, Administration, and Board of Trus
tees, have come under heavy fire dur
ing the past week's protest, but the
uneasy tension has long been building.
Smith admits the constituencies,
viewing the rapid changes in the cur
rent student generation, have to find
a new flexibility. While sit-in demon
strators and long hair have caught
the eye of the press, Smith under
scores the silent revolution which has
taken place in attitude of the -Average
student.
The large increase in student mem
bership on University committees has

been a "measurable" addition to stu
dent attempts to participate in deci
sion which affect them, yet student
demands are far from satisfied, as the
draft protest demonstrated.
Accelerate The Pace
The tempo of student activism has
risen sharply this year, and Smith be
lieves the shift into educational areas
will accelerate its pace. Mackenzie
agrees, "Educational policy is a lot
closer to home for most ' students."
But he adds there is no reason not to
believe thr present systems can bring
about the needed changes.
Smith, Kadane, and Mackenzie share
the belief that Stanford has come to
a turning point and faces .a challenge
which it must tackle successfully. The
new spirit of awareness, and not the
picket, exemplifies the challenge.
Yet as Dean Smith suceincty noted,
Administration and faculty cannot
successfully answer the student chal
lenge by "wishing away" the new gen
eration and their desires for improv
ing their education. Nor can it be met
without student tolerance.

intelligent discussion.
"The Harris victory showed there
were many people who cared about
the question of education," Mackenzie
noted. The student body, now "much
more aware of its role in the com

munity," has guaranteed that these
issues will be raised and discussed
with Harris in office.
Harris has already begun to heed
Mackenzie's advice to select the major
issues for the year, and then to docu
ment the student case.
However, Dean Smith observes, "We
have not made very much progress—
which we are going to have to make—
in encouraging students to have more
tolerance for other constituencies."
Those other constituencies, the facul
ty, Administration, and Board of Trus
tees, have come under heavy fire dur
ing the past week's protest, but the
uneasy tension has long been building.
Smith admits the constituencies,
viewing the rapid changes in the cur
rent student generation, have to find
a new flexibility. While sit-in demon
strators and long hair have caught
the eye of the press, Smith under
scores the silent revolution which has
taken place in attitude of the -Average
student.
The large increase in student mem
bership on University committees has

been a "measurable" addition to stu
dent attempts to participate in deci
sion which affect them, yet student
demands are far from satisfied, as the
draft protest demonstrated.
Accelerate The Pace
The tempo of student activism has
risen sharply this year, and Smith be
lieves the shift into educational areas
will accelerate its pace. Mackenzie
agrees, "Educational policy is a lot
closer to home for most ' students."
But he adds there is no reason not to
believe thr present systems can bring
about the needed changes.
Smith, Kadane, and Mackenzie share
the belief that Stanford has come to
a turning point and faces .a challenge
which it must tackle successfully. The
new spirit of awareness, and not the
picket, exemplifies the challenge.
Yet as Dean Smith suceincty noted,
Administration and faculty cannot
successfully answer the student chal
lenge by "wishing away" the new gen
eration and their desires for improv
ing their education. Nor can it be met
without student tolerance.
Stanford's first year of intensive
student activism is drawing to a close,
but few campus leaders believe the
long summer will stem the fresh tide
of student awareness.
Students have made substantial
progress in impressing two things
upon the University, Associate Dean
Joel Smith recently commented.
"They very much want to lead their
own lives," he noted. Secondly, Smith
cited strong student demands to be
heard before basic policy decisions
which have direct impact upon stu
dents are made.
Shifting Focus
"Reaction of students against Uni
versity regulations does not mean stu
dents want to live in some abject or
lascivious way," the Dean observed.
In fact, some student leaders, includ
ing ASSU President Sandy Mackenzie,
believe the University recognition of
student liberties has helped to shift
the focus of student activism to the
question of education.

"The trend is away from the battle
for student liberties," Mackenzie esti
mates. Speaker of the Legislature Jay
Kadane has sighted last year's revi
sion of social regulations as "the first
change that affected peoples lives.
Students have begun to think about
what the rules ought to be."
Toward Academic
While Kadane had hoped the ques
tion of student liberties could be sub
stantially resolved this year, he never
theless maintains "the shift is going
toward academic problems."
Both Mackenzie and Kadane have
pointed out a sharp change in the out
look of the present student from the
views of his predecessor just five
years ago. Students are taking more
seriously the fact that they only have
four years to spend as undergradu
ates, and hence are asking how im
portant their education will be in later
life.
Mackenzie admits student effort to
find a more meaningful education is
a "loose concept, but it is the type of
issue with which people are con

cerned." Some students feel short
changed by the education they are
getting, Kadane asserts.
"Many students are looking for pro
fessors who are not themselves bored
by the classes they teach." In short,
the LASSU Speaker feels students
want "a more fruitful academic at
mosphere."
The question of how to create such
an atmosphere has caused sharp dis
agreement. Last night Kadane told
the final session of the Legislature,
"It is left to the student body to en
courage, to prod, to cajole, to lead,
and sometimes to push (the Adminis
tration and faculty) toward a new and
better Stanford."
Kadane told Tile Daily yesterday
the recent draft protesters could have
chosen their tactics more carefully.
However, he found himself in sym
pathy with the basic feeling of frus
tration which many of the protestors
expressed. "Frustration of their at
tempts to talk with the Administra
tion led to a non-productive regres
sion," he said.

While maintaining the students'
duty to prod the University, Kadane
expressed the necessity for the faculty
to enter into student effort to improve
the quality of education as well as
efforts to gain a greater voice in other
decision-making areas.
Existing Structures
Mackenzie prefers to de-emphasize
recent attempts for change which
have ignored existing structures. Both
the SCVP sit-in and LASSU's enact
ment of a conflict in law raised prob
lems "which could have been solved
in numerous other ways."
If student government is to do more
than simply react to various protests
by campus groups, the outgoing stu
dent body president believes his suc
cessor, David Harris, must concen
trate on a well-defined program bring
ing the main issues into light for an
intelligent discussion.

views of his predecessor just five
years ago. Students are taking more
seriously the fact that they only have
four years to spend as undergradu
ates, and hence are asking how im
portant their education will be in later
life.
Mackenzie admits student effort to
find a more meaningful education is
a "loose concept, but it is the type of
issue with which people are con

cerned." Some students feel short
changed by the education they are
getting, Kadane asserts.
"Many students are looking for pro
fessors who are not themselves bored
by the classes they teach." In short,
the LASSU Speaker feels students
want "a more fruitful academic at
mosphere."
The question of how to create such
an atmosphere has caused sharp dis
agreement. Last night Kadane told
the final session of the Legislature,
"It is left to the student body to en
courage, to prod, to cajole, to lead,
and sometimes to push (the Adminis
tration and faculty) toward a new and
better Stanford."
Kadane told Tile Daily yesterday
the recent draft protesters could have
chosen their tactics more carefully.
However, he found himself in sym
pathy with the basic feeling of frus
tration which many of the protestors
expressed. "Frustration of their at
tempts to talk with the Administra
tion led to a non-productive regres
sion," he said.

While maintaining the students'
duty to prod the University, Kadane
expressed the necessity for the faculty
to enter into student effort to improve
the quality of education as well as
efforts to gain a greater voice in other
decision-making areas.
Existing Structures
Mackenzie prefers to de-emphasize
recent attempts for change which
have ignored existing structures. Both
the SCVP sit-in and LASSU's enact
ment of a conflict in law raised prob
lems "which could have been solved
in numerous other ways."
If student government is to do more
than simply react to various protests
by campus groups, the outgoing stu
dent body president believes his suc
cessor, David Harris, must concen
trate on a well-defined program bring
ing the main issues into light for an
intelligent discussion.
"The Harris victory showed there
were many people who cared about
the question of education," Mackenzie
noted. The student body, now "much
more aware of its role in the com

munity," has guaranteed that these
issues will be raised and discussed
with Harris in office.
Harris has already begun to heed
Mackenzie's advice to select the major
issues for the year, and then to docu
ment the student case.
However, Dean Smith observes, "We
have not made very much progress—
which we are going to have to make—
in encouraging students to have more
tolerance for other constituencies."
Those other constituencies, the facul
ty, Administration, and Board of Trus
tees, have come under heavy fire dur
ing the past week's protest, but the
uneasy tension has long been building.
Smith admits the constituencies,
viewing the rapid changes in the cur
rent student generation, have to find
a new flexibility. While sit-in demon
strators and long hair have caught
the eye of the press, Smith under
scores the silent revolution which has
taken place in attitude of the -Average
student.
The large increase in student mem
bership on University committees has

been a "measurable" addition to stu
dent attempts to participate in deci
sion which affect them, yet student
demands are far from satisfied, as the
draft protest demonstrated.
Accelerate The Pace
The tempo of student activism has
risen sharply this year, and Smith be
lieves the shift into educational areas
will accelerate its pace. Mackenzie
agrees, "Educational policy is a lot
closer to home for most ' students."
But he adds there is no reason not to
believe thr present systems can bring
about the needed changes.
Smith, Kadane, and Mackenzie share
the belief that Stanford has come to
a turning point and faces .a challenge
which it must tackle successfully. The
new spirit of awareness, and not the
picket, exemplifies the challenge.
Yet as Dean Smith suceincty noted,
Administration and faculty cannot
successfully answer the student chal
lenge by "wishing away" the new gen
eration and their desires for improv
ing their education. Nor can it be met
without student tolerance.
Stanford's first year of intensive
student activism is drawing to a close,
but few campus leaders believe the
long summer will stem the fresh tide
of student awareness.
Students have made substantial
progress in impressing two things
upon the University, Associate Dean
Joel Smith recently commented.
"They very much want to lead their
own lives," he noted. Secondly, Smith
cited strong student demands to be
heard before basic policy decisions
which have direct impact upon stu
dents are made.
Shifting Focus
"Reaction of students against Uni
versity regulations does not mean stu
dents want to live in some abject or
lascivious way," the Dean observed.
In fact, some student leaders, includ
ing ASSU President Sandy Mackenzie,
believe the University recognition of
student liberties has helped to shift
the focus of student activism to the
question of education.

"The trend is away from the battle
for student liberties," Mackenzie esti
mates. Speaker of the Legislature Jay
Kadane has sighted last year's revi
sion of social regulations as "the first
change that affected peoples lives.
Students have begun to think about
what the rules ought to be."
Toward Academic
While Kadane had hoped the ques
tion of student liberties could be sub
stantially resolved this year, he never
theless maintains "the shift is going
toward academic problems."
Both Mackenzie and Kadane have
pointed out a sharp change in the out
look of the present student from the
views of his predecessor just five

seriously the fact that they only have
four years to spend as undergradu
