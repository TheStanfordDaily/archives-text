THEATER
Two one-act dramas, Noel Coward's RED PEPPERS and Chekhov's
THE MARRIAGE PROPOSAL, will be performed in the Nitery to
night and tomorrow evening at 8:30. Paul E. Richards will be in
charge of "Red Peppers" and Gerald Hiken will direct "Proposal".
The Tangent looks big this weekend with ACCENT ON YOUTH,
dramatic readings by actor Phillip Schultz at 8:30 tonight. To
morrow night the ILLEGITIMATE THEATRE, the Tangent's own
improvisational troupe, will be in full swing. Also featured will be
guitarist Randy Conger.
THE INSECT COMEDY, starring Bob Paterson as an ant war
correspondent, is the fourth and final production of the season by
the Foothill College Drama Department. Four performances will be
played this and next weekend at Foothill.
lonesco's RHINOCEROS opens tonight at 8:30 at The Playhouse
on Beach and Hyde Streets, S.F. Better get your tickets right away
for this unique peice of drama, you wouldn't want to be one of the
multitude of rhinoceri (sick) trying to horn in at the last minute.
Good ol' Ern himself will head the TENNESSEE ERNIE FORD
SHOW, due at the Circle Star Theater in San Carlos for one week
starting this Tuesday. America's number one Pea Picker, Minnie
Pearl, will be there with good ol' Ern.
FILMS
Dead week, sigh-wretch-moan-foam-trip out, is upon us with its
attendant censure of Tresidder and Sunday flicks; BUT (and I know
that this is going to be hard to believe) we will be drenched in
films this weekend. On Sunday and Monday at 8:00 p.m. the STAN
FORD STUDENT-FILM FESTIVAL will unreel its fantasmagora
of film fun. Actually these films are often more exciting and, yes,
even better produced than many of the jnes currently hopping
around the Bay. I mean, give a Stanford nut a camera, let his
diabolical little mind go to work and anything can turn up.
OTHER
The Stanford Committee for Peace in Vietnam is sponsoring
what, to hold back the emphasis, is a must for everybodyâ€”man,
woman, and child. Attention FRAT MEN: you too can have fun
at this party, I'm sure. Oh yes, the name of the game: PEACE
TRIP ROCK PARAMILITARY-FESTIVAL-BALL, to be held at
3938-A Magnolia (behind Ernie's Liquor Store on El Camino). See
article on this page.
