# Ye Sons Of Stanford Resist Hanky-Panky
## 
### TIM HAIGHT 
The Stanford Committee for
Peace in Vietnam, long recog
nized by the clearer heads on
campus as an organization dedi
cated to the overthrow of almost
everything we on the Farm hold
closest to our hearts, is build
ing toward an epic climax of
their so-called "Peace - Trip -
Rock - Paramilitary - Festival •
Ball."
We all know what happened
at Cal. Thousands of nubile fe
males and glazed-eyed youths
crowded into the Harmon gym
nasium to participate in what
certain of our State legislators
have called an "orgy." Dancing,
evidence of drinking, the sweet
smell of (dare I say it? No!).
Many of us looked on the re
ports of that display with a mix
ture of fascination and revul
sion. This was going on right
across the bay. License, free
wheeling association, dissent. It
was enough to make the strong
er of us want to throw up. But
I digress.
Cancerous Red Smear
Now this cancer is spreading
like a red smear across the map
of the Peninsula and infecting
the sons of Stanford. They in
tend to brainwash our youth
with a combination of "psyched
elic" lights (on the order of the
torture chamber in "The Ipcress
File", pulsating electric rhythms
of the erstwhile "Blind Man's
Blues Band" (they used to be
called the Acid Grapefruit, but
apparently contact with halucin
ogens drove one of their mem
bers to criminally assault a fe
male pizza chef, who defended
herself by hurling red-hot onions
into her assailant's eyes, hence
the new name,) and liquid re
freshments of a nature more
threatening » tW? opinion of
many than n»d.Jj ana — LI
QUOR!
Needless to say any right
minded, clean-living, clean-liv
ered, upstanding, patriotic, 110
per cent American will stay
away from the debauch. But. we
all know that there are those
on this campus who will do
much on a Friday night (of all
nights) for what they naively
call, "Fun." It is this marginal
group that is the target of this
apepal.
Weltanschanng!
Don't go to the paramilitary
festival-ball! You might lose
your mind. We must all be on
guard against those probes into
our lives that can upset the
delicious harmony of our wqltan
schaung. Once the camel gets
his nose into the tent he is not
satisfied until the entire tent
is over his hump. Can you hon
estly trust yourself in such a
surrounding? It's not part of the
spirit of a University.
Many of us feel that the fact
that this saturnalian romp is
off-campus is no reason for our

faculty and administration, the
guardians of our morals, to per
mit it. They should decree emer
gency social regulations for men,
to provide an element of control
in the evening. They should send
our trusty student police to be
chaperones. They should outlaw
the sale of liquor to anyone not
married who requests it at
Ernies.
Pickets Perhaps?
The propagandists of the SC
PV are inviting everybody, and
charging a minimal $1.50 for ad
mission and all the refreshments
one can drink. Obviously there
is no student too pure for them.
They will suck anybody into
their web. Perhaps only a picket
line outside the door of 3938-A
Magnolia (Behind Ernies— El
Camino) at nine o'clock, will
rouse the consciences of the
sheep being led to the slaughter.
I won't see you there, myself,
however. Some of us must bore
from within. Some clear-headed,
right-thinking witness must be
there when they go mad, when
they have "fun," when they . . .
But I digress. Stanford students
unite!
