# 'Shop, Mainstreet': Tale Of War
## 
### LOREN KIEVE 
"THE SHOP ON MAIN
STREET." This rueful, Oscar
winning tragedy about the
friendship between an Aryan
carpenter (Josef Kroner) and an
old Jewish shopkeeper (Ida Ka
minski) in Nazi • dominated
Czechoslovkia incisively depicts
the ravages of war and prejudice
on one man's conscience.
Tono Britka, the simple car
penter, comes home from a tink
er's task to a litter-strewn yard
filled with hens and a hen-pick
ing wife. That evening his broth
er-in-law, replete in his quasi-
Nazi uniform and bearing food
and drink as well as his buxom
wife, comes for dinner and in
the ensuing revelry informs
Tono that he has been appointed
an Aryan Controller for a shop
on main street.
An Agreement Struck
Tono, attired in his Sunday
shirt, freshiy-ironed by his so
cially aspiring spouse, confronts
Mrs. Lautmann in her sewing
goods shop the next morning. He
is in the midst of trying to tell
her that he has come to take

over her shop when Kuchar, an
affluent Jewish sympathizer,
comes in and interprets to the
somewhat deaf, old woman that
Tono has come to help her run
the shop. He also informs Tono
that Mrs. Lautman has been
supported by the other mem
bers of the Jewish community
and is not the hoarder of any
secret cache of money or gold;
in fact, her store stock is prac
tically nil. Kuchar arranges an
agreement between Tono and
the Jewish leaders whereby Tono
receives a weekly payment for
"helping Mrs. Lautman in the
store."
Tono's wife, seeing the re
wards of this agreement while
believing that they are the re
sult of Tono's busines acumen, is
ecstatic thinking about their
prospective future. Meanwhile,
the switchman tells Tono that
they have brought in cattle-cars
in which to deport the Jews.
Guilty Conscience
The ensuing deportation, com
bined with Tono's newly de
veloepd affection for Mrs. Laut
mann as a result of her kindness
to him, plays havoc with Tono's

conscience.
In an emotionally charged
scene, with the Czech Nazi
trucks outside the shop window,
preparing to take away the Jew
ish townsfolk to the train sta
tion, and the voice of his brother
in-law blaring out over a loud
speaker, Tono wavers between
trying to hide the old woman
and turning her over to be taken
away with the rest.
When, in an hysterical out
burst, Tono finnally tells Mrs.
Lautmann what is happening
and then, regretting his action,
he pushes her into a closet to
hide her from the Nazis outside.
After the trucks have left, he
discovers that he has killed her
and takes his own life.
Mystical Promenade
The film closes with an idyllic,
dreamlike scene where Tono,
dressed in a suit which Mrs.
Lautmann had given him, and
Mrs. Lautmann, looking like a
picture of herself in the back
room of the shop, flow hand in
hand in slow motion down the
main street.
The film itself is a portrait of
small town Czechoslovakian life
vividly and realistically photo
graphed, but more than that, it
is a perceptive analysis of the
absurdity of the ideas of the
Nazi regime. In the midst of the
deportation scene between Tono
and Mrs. Lautmann she asks,
"Am I going mad—or is it the
world" There can be no doubt
as to the answer.
The expert photography
switches from the town scenes
and those of Mrs. Lautmann and

Tono to those depicting the Nazi
dominated officialdom. The con
struction of a Czech-Nazi "Tow
er of Victory" permeates the
story; its actual and final com
pletion being finished the night
before the Jews are to be de
ported, a Nazi leader organizes
a march from the tavern in
which Tono is pondering how to
save Mrs. Lautmann from being
taken away to thp newly-fin
ished pyramid and, amid Mc-
Donald's Hamburger-type flash
ing lights, orates on the glories
and freedom of the new regime,
while at the same time chroni
cling the deportation of the
Jews. The contrast between the
two types of scenes is evident.
Director's Sentiments
Such subtle and not so subtle
sequences as the numerous
scenes of the house cranes atop
the chimneys and the cuckooing
of the clock when Tono's brother
is glorifying Naziism at the din
ner gathering as well as the
dreamlike sequences with Tono
and Mrs. Lautmann promenad
ing down Main Street clearly
show the director's sentiment to
ward his subject.
While we have never heard of
Josef Kroner or Ida Kaminski,
we think we will in the future;
their parts are expertly and emo
tionally portrayed. Mrs. Laut
mann's innocence and Tono's
simplicity combine to condemn
the barbarism of the Nazi rule
and the warped ideology on
which it is based. Tono's death
is the ultimate rebutal of the
prejudicial leanings of his con
science.

er-in-law, replete in his quasi-
Nazi uniform and bearing food
and drink as well as his buxom
wife, comes for dinner and in
the ensuing revelry informs
Tono that he has been appointed
an Aryan Controller for a shop
on main street.
An Agreement Struck
Tono, attired in his Sunday
shirt, freshiy-ironed by his so
cially aspiring spouse, confronts
Mrs. Lautmann in her sewing
goods shop the next morning. He
is in the midst of trying to tell
her that he has come to take

over her shop when Kuchar, an
affluent Jewish sympathizer,
comes in and interprets to the
somewhat deaf, old woman that
Tono has come to help her run
the shop. He also informs Tono
that Mrs. Lautman has been
supported by the other mem
bers of the Jewish community
and is not the hoarder of any
secret cache of money or gold;
in fact, her store stock is prac
tically nil. Kuchar arranges an
agreement between Tono and
the Jewish leaders whereby Tono
receives a weekly payment for
"helping Mrs. Lautman in the
store."
Tono's wife, seeing the re
wards of this agreement while
believing that they are the re
sult of Tono's busines acumen, is
ecstatic thinking about their
prospective future. Meanwhile,
the switchman tells Tono that
they have brought in cattle-cars
in which to deport the Jews.
Guilty Conscience
The ensuing deportation, com
bined with Tono's newly de
veloepd affection for Mrs. Laut
mann as a result of her kindness
to him, plays havoc with Tono's

conscience.
In an emotionally charged
scene, with the Czech Nazi
trucks outside the shop window,
preparing to take away the Jew
ish townsfolk to the train sta
tion, and the voice of his brother
in-law blaring out over a loud
speaker, Tono wavers between
trying to hide the old woman
and turning her over to be taken
away with the rest.
When, in an hysterical out
burst, Tono finnally tells Mrs.
Lautmann what is happening
and then, regretting his action,
he pushes her into a closet to
hide her from the Nazis outside.
After the trucks have left, he
discovers that he has killed her
and takes his own life.
Mystical Promenade
The film closes with an idyllic,
dreamlike scene where Tono,
dressed in a suit which Mrs.
Lautmann had given him, and
Mrs. Lautmann, looking like a
picture of herself in the back
room of the shop, flow hand in
hand in slow motion down the
main street.
The film itself is a portrait of
small town Czechoslovakian life
vividly and realistically photo
graphed, but more than that, it
is a perceptive analysis of the
absurdity of the ideas of the
Nazi regime. In the midst of the
deportation scene between Tono
and Mrs. Lautmann she asks,
"Am I going mad—or is it the
world" There can be no doubt
as to the answer.
The expert photography
switches from the town scenes
and those of Mrs. Lautmann and

Tono to those depicting the Nazi
dominated officialdom. The con
struction of a Czech-Nazi "Tow
er of Victory" permeates the
story; its actual and final com
pletion being finished the night
before the Jews are to be de
ported, a Nazi leader organizes
a march from the tavern in
which Tono is pondering how to
save Mrs. Lautmann from being
taken away to thp newly-fin
ished pyramid and, amid Mc-
Donald's Hamburger-type flash
ing lights, orates on the glories
and freedom of the new regime,
while at the same time chroni
cling the deportation of the
Jews. The contrast between the
two types of scenes is evident.
Director's Sentiments
Such subtle and not so subtle
sequences as the numerous
scenes of the house cranes atop
the chimneys and the cuckooing
of the clock when Tono's brother
is glorifying Naziism at the din
ner gathering as well as the
dreamlike sequences with Tono
and Mrs. Lautmann promenad
ing down Main Street clearly
show the director's sentiment to
ward his subject.
While we have never heard of
Josef Kroner or Ida Kaminski,
we think we will in the future;
their parts are expertly and emo
tionally portrayed. Mrs. Laut
mann's innocence and Tono's
simplicity combine to condemn
the barbarism of the Nazi rule
and the warped ideology on
which it is based. Tono's death
is the ultimate rebutal of the
prejudicial leanings of his con
science.

over her shop when Kuchar, an
affluent Jewish sympathizer,
comes in and interprets to the
somewhat deaf, old woman that
Tono has come to help her run
the shop. He also informs Tono
that Mrs. Lautman has been
supported by the other mem
bers of the Jewish community
and is not the hoarder of any
secret cache of money or gold;
in fact, her store stock is prac
tically nil. Kuchar arranges an
agreement between Tono and
the Jewish leaders whereby Tono
receives a weekly payment for
"helping Mrs. Lautman in the
store."
Tono's wife, seeing the re
wards of this agreement while
believing that they are the re
sult of Tono's busines acumen, is
ecstatic thinking about their
prospective future. Meanwhile,
the switchman tells Tono that
they have brought in cattle-cars
in which to deport the Jews.
Guilty Conscience
The ensuing deportation, com
bined with Tono's newly de
veloepd affection for Mrs. Laut
mann as a result of her kindness
to him, plays havoc with Tono's

conscience.
In an emotionally charged
scene, with the Czech Nazi
trucks outside the shop window,
preparing to take away the Jew
ish townsfolk to the train sta
tion, and the voice of his brother
in-law blaring out over a loud
speaker, Tono wavers between
trying to hide the old woman
and turning her over to be taken
away with the rest.
When, in an hysterical out
burst, Tono finnally tells Mrs.
Lautmann what is happening
and then, regretting his action,
he pushes her into a closet to
hide her from the Nazis outside.
After the trucks have left, he
discovers that he has killed her
and takes his own life.
Mystical Promenade
The film closes with an idyllic,
dreamlike scene where Tono,
dressed in a suit which Mrs.
Lautmann had given him, and
Mrs. Lautmann, looking like a
picture of herself in the back
room of the shop, flow hand in
hand in slow motion down the
main street.
The film itself is a portrait of
small town Czechoslovakian life
vividly and realistically photo
graphed, but more than that, it
is a perceptive analysis of the
absurdity of the ideas of the
Nazi regime. In the midst of the
deportation scene between Tono
and Mrs. Lautmann she asks,
"Am I going mad—or is it the
world" There can be no doubt
as to the answer.
The expert photography
switches from the town scenes
and those of Mrs. Lautmann and

Tono to those depicting the Nazi
dominated officialdom. The con
struction of a Czech-Nazi "Tow
er of Victory" permeates the
story; its actual and final com
pletion being finished the night
before the Jews are to be de
ported, a Nazi leader organizes
a march from the tavern in
which Tono is pondering how to
save Mrs. Lautmann from being
taken away to thp newly-fin
ished pyramid and, amid Mc-
Donald's Hamburger-type flash
ing lights, orates on the glories
and freedom of the new regime,
while at the same time chroni
cling the deportation of the
Jews. The contrast between the
two types of scenes is evident.
Director's Sentiments
Such subtle and not so subtle
sequences as the numerous
scenes of the house cranes atop
the chimneys and the cuckooing
of the clock when Tono's brother
is glorifying Naziism at the din
ner gathering as well as the
dreamlike sequences with Tono
and Mrs. Lautmann promenad
ing down Main Street clearly
show the director's sentiment to
ward his subject.
While we have never heard of
Josef Kroner or Ida Kaminski,
we think we will in the future;
their parts are expertly and emo
tionally portrayed. Mrs. Laut
mann's innocence and Tono's
simplicity combine to condemn
the barbarism of the Nazi rule
and the warped ideology on
which it is based. Tono's death
is the ultimate rebutal of the
prejudicial leanings of his con
science.
"THE SHOP ON MAIN
STREET." This rueful, Oscar
winning tragedy about the
friendship between an Aryan
carpenter (Josef Kroner) and an
old Jewish shopkeeper (Ida Ka
minski) in Nazi • dominated
Czechoslovkia incisively depicts
the ravages of war and prejudice
on one man's conscience.
Tono Britka, the simple car
penter, comes home from a tink
er's task to a litter-strewn yard
filled with hens and a hen-pick
ing wife. That evening his broth
er-in-law, replete in his quasi-
Nazi uniform and bearing food
and drink as well as his buxom
wife, comes for dinner and in
the ensuing revelry informs
Tono that he has been appointed
an Aryan Controller for a shop
on main street.
An Agreement Struck
Tono, attired in his Sunday
shirt, freshiy-ironed by his so
cially aspiring spouse, confronts
Mrs. Lautmann in her sewing
goods shop the next morning. He
is in the midst of trying to tell
her that he has come to take

over her shop when Kuchar, an
