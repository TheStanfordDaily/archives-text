# Anserment And 'Orchestra' Highlight Summer Festival
## 
### 
One of the world's most ex
tensively recorded orchestras
and its internationally-famous
conductor — L'Ochestre de la
Suisse Romande with Ernest An
sermet —will make its American
debut, from June 22 to July 5,
opening Stanford's third annual
Summer Festival of the Arts.
Theme and title for the 1966
Stanford Summer Festival is
"20th Century Innovations." The
seven-week program will focus
on the important changes in
style and form within the arts
during the period 1900-1939.
"No other orchestra and no
other conductor," Festival Di
rector Virgil K. Whitaker men
tioned, "fit our theme so perfect
ly. This group has continually
distinguished itself for brilliant
performances of the 20th cen
tury repertory, not to mention
the fact that it premiered many
of he outstanding works from
this period.
"Of Maestro Ernest Ansermet,
I think one can correctly and
quite literally say that he led

the musical charge into the 20th
century."
Founder and conductor of L.'-
Orchestre de la Suisse Romande
and pioneer of modern music in
the early 20th century, Anser
met is a world-respected philos
opher of music.
As a conductor, the 82-year-old
Swiss is known as a master of
subtlety — not particularly a
showman. He is recognized as
one of the finest interpreters of
Stravinsky. But, although he is
linked with the Impressionists,
he also is considered among the
best current expositors of
Haydn or, for that matter, all
music defined as "refined" or
"fatidious."
A Psychic Entity
Although a trained mathemat
ical logician, Ansermet believes
an orchestra is "first and fore
most a psychic entity." He sees
the conductor's task as one of
bringing out both the rational
order and the inner impulse of
a composition.
