"Succesful progress creeps from
point to point, testing each step."—
Whitehead.
The academic year 1965-66 was one
of student unrest. It was a year of
Vietnam and napalm; of liberalized
rules over worship; of sexual rights;
and the election of David Harris as
student body president.
Here are some of the high and low
points of Stanford University in its
74th year.
BLOOD FOR VlETNAM—Conflict
in Southeast Asia was a major theme
of national and campus news through
out the year. Protest came to the fore
front when a student committee
sought blood for victims of the Viet
Cong, and Stanford drew national at
tention for its first bleed-in.
NEW CAMPUS DEDICATED—A
resort hotel in Semmering, Austria,
became Stanford's fourth European
study center. A quarter later, Harlax
ton Manor in England was dedicated,
and students found a greater lan
guage barrier there than at any other
campus.
ANOTHER FRATERNITY GOES
LOCAL—Members of Alpha Kappa
Lambda, after a survey of alumni,
voted to leave their national organi
zation. The national then put them
on suspension. Renamed Lambda Nu,
the house became Stanford's third
local fraternity.

A NOISELESS COUP—While park
ing problems increased, many stu
dents (and faculty) took to the motor
cycle. Police reported 300 cycles reg
istered for the year, a 500 per cent
increase over former years.
GO, GO, FIVE IN A ROW An In
dian triumph over Cal, 9-7, gave the
Tribe its fifth straight Big Game
victory. Cal was ahead in the last
quarter, 7-3, but Stanford gained 70
yards in 11 plays for its winning
touchdown.
FONDLE IT—Although few took
them seriously at first, the Stanford
Sexual Rights Forum (SSRF)
emerged during dead week of fall
quarter. It later gained student sup
port, and a spring referendum re
sulted in a student request for free
distribution of contraceptives by the
Health Service. Student-Administra
tion discussion began, but contracep
tives which once were given out sud
denly weren't.
LOSS OF UNlON—Despite protest
from students, Union residence was
closed down to provide space for a
students' services center. Residents
bitterly criticized their displacement
to the sterile high rises, but soon
found their new quarters quite accept
able.
. A WORD FROM THE SPONSORS
—Winter quarter saw the beginning
of controversy over sponsor selection.
All 25 Wilbur sponsors originally re
fused Faculty Master Eric Hutchinson
the right of veto, and compromise was
slow in coming. Decisions seem
ed to change day by day, and
final selection was postponed
until dead week five months
later. Meanwhile, freshmen got
along just as always.
AND THEN THERE WERE
FIVE — Student members of the
Committee of Fifteen faced
problems of communication, and
an issue-minded Legislature de
cided it was time for a change.
But then some people yelled
"foul" and a student referendum
proved to be inconclusive. A
compromise was reached, and
the students were replaced.
"STANFORD IS NON-DE
NOMINATIONAL . . The
Board of Trustees approved use
of worship facilities by varying
faiths, thereby permitting ex
pansion of religious activities
on campus. Later, B. Davie Na
pier of Yale Divinity School was
made Dean of the Chapel.
JAZZ full year pro
gram presented lectures and dis
cussion on aspects of jazz.
Included in special concerts were
Ray Charles, Ella Fitzgerald,
Louis Armstrong and Miles
Davis.
. .AT THE REP— Repertory
Theater completed its first year
on campus with performances
of "Prometheus Bound," "Good
woman of Setzuan," "All's Well
(That Ends Well," and other
plays. An expanded schedule
was announced for next year.
THE BOYS FROM FRESNO
—Final candidates for ASSU
Presidency were two juniors
from Fresno: David Harris and
Robert Klein. Harris won by a
600-vote margin in a record turn
out. Alumni reaction to his plat
form of student activism was
swift and negative.
NEW RULES FOR BOOZE—
A decision by the Board of Trus
tees legalized alcoholic beverages
for students over 21 in campus
residences. Said President Ster
ling: "Individual responsibility
and respect for law will be en

hanced by entrusting to the stu
dents a greater responsibility
for compliance with State law
and by the removal of complete
prohibitions which are not en
forceable in practice."
WHERE THE GIRLS ARE —
Social regulations became an
other major area of student-Uni
versity conflict, and the Social
Regulations Committee voted it
self out of existence. Regula
tions remain.
THE HAIR AFFAlR—Fresh
man Pat Morrison set new track
records for his team, but some
people found his long hair im
proper. The British runner was
excluded from the season's last
meet. Letters in the Daily
argued the issue on both sides,
but Morrison kept his hair the
way he liked it. Meanwhile, the
team lost to Cal.
CLASSIFIED CONTRACTS
The University announced it

held limited contracts with the
CIA following national stories
about that organization's activi
ties at other campuses. Involve
ment in secret research was
questioned by students and fac
ulty, although no settlement
was reached. A special meeting
open to all members of the Uni
versity community was called
for dead week, spring quarter,
to discuss research as well as
Selective Service pressures.
STUDENT SIT-IN—Some stu
dents, dissatisfied with the Uni
versity's handling of Selective
Service tests and other involve
ment with the Vietnam war,
staged a sit-in at President Ster
ling's office. The President pro
posed a private meeting with
the protesters, but they insisted
on open, community-wide meet
ings. After 50 hours, the stu
dents left and are now being
tried by student judicial coun
cils.

. .AT THE REP— Repertory
Theater completed its first year
on campus with performances
of "Prometheus Bound," "Good
woman of Setzuan," "All's Well

plays. An expanded schedule
was announced for next year.
THE BOYS FROM FRESNO
—Final candidates for ASSU
Presidency were two juniors
from Fresno: David Harris and
Robert Klein. Harris won by a
600-vote margin in a record turn
out. Alumni reaction to his plat
form of student activism was
swift and negative.
NEW RULES FOR BOOZE—
A decision by the Board of Trus
tees legalized alcoholic beverages
for students over 21 in campus
residences. Said President Ster
ling: "Individual responsibility
and respect for law will be en

hanced by entrusting to the stu
dents a greater responsibility
for compliance with State law
and by the removal of complete
prohibitions which are not en
forceable in practice."
WHERE THE GIRLS ARE —
Social regulations became an
other major area of student-Uni

THE HAIR AFFAlR—Fresh
man Pat Morrison set new track
records for his team, but some
people found his long hair im
proper. The British runner was
excluded from the season's last
meet. Letters in the Daily
argued the issue on both sides,
but Morrison kept his hair the
way he liked it. Meanwhile, the
team lost to Cal.
CLASSIFIED CONTRACTS
The University announced it

held limited contracts with the
CIA following national stories
about that organization's activi
ties at other campuses. Involve
ment in secret research was
questioned by students and fac
ulty, although no settlement
was reached. A special meeting
open to all members of the Uni
versity community was called
for dead week, spring quarter,
to discuss research as well as
Selective Service pressures.
STUDENT SIT-IN—Some stu
dents, dissatisfied with the Uni
versity's handling of Selective
Service tests and other involve
ment with the Vietnam war,
staged a sit-in at President Ster
ling's office. The President pro
posed a private meeting with
the protesters, but they insisted
on open, community-wide meet
ings. After 50 hours, the stu
dents left and are now being
tried by student judicial coun
cils.

Whitehead.
The academic year 1965-66 was one
of student unrest. It was a year of
Vietnam and napalm; of liberalized
rules over worship; of sexual rights;
and the election of David Harris as
student body president.
Here are some of the high and low
points of Stanford University in its
74th year.
BLOOD FOR VlETNAM—Conflict
in Southeast Asia was a major theme
of national and campus news through
out the year. Protest came to the fore
front when a student committee
sought blood for victims of the Viet
Cong, and Stanford drew national at
tention for its first bleed-in.
NEW CAMPUS DEDICATED—A
resort hotel in Semmering, Austria,
became Stanford's fourth European
study center. A quarter later, Harlax
ton Manor in England was dedicated,
and students found a greater lan
guage barrier there than at any other
campus.
ANOTHER FRATERNITY GOES
LOCAL—Members of Alpha Kappa
Lambda, after a survey of alumni,
voted to leave their national organi
zation. The national then put them
on suspension. Renamed Lambda Nu,
the house became Stanford's third
local fraternity.

A NOISELESS COUP—While park
ing problems increased, many stu
dents (and faculty) took to the motor
cycle. Police reported 300 cycles reg
istered for the year, a 500 per cent
increase over former years.
GO, GO, FIVE IN A ROW An In
dian triumph over Cal, 9-7, gave the
Tribe its fifth straight Big Game
victory. Cal was ahead in the last
quarter, 7-3, but Stanford gained 70
yards in 11 plays for its winning
touchdown.
FONDLE IT—Although few took
them seriously at first, the Stanford
Sexual Rights Forum (SSRF)
emerged during dead week of fall
quarter. It later gained student sup
port, and a spring referendum re
sulted in a student request for free
distribution of contraceptives by the
Health Service. Student-Administra
tion discussion began, but contracep
tives which once were given out sud
denly weren't.
LOSS OF UNlON—Despite protest
from students, Union residence was
closed down to provide space for a
students' services center. Residents
bitterly criticized their displacement
to the sterile high rises, but soon
found their new quarters quite accept
able.
. A WORD FROM THE SPONSORS
—Winter quarter saw the beginning
of controversy over sponsor selection.
All 25 Wilbur sponsors originally re
fused Faculty Master Eric Hutchinson
the right of veto, and compromise was
slow in coming. Decisions seem
ed to change day by day, and
final selection was postponed
until dead week five months
later. Meanwhile, freshmen got
along just as always.
AND THEN THERE WERE
FIVE — Student members of the
Committee of Fifteen faced
problems of communication, and
an issue-minded Legislature de
cided it was time for a change.
But then some people yelled
"foul" and a student referendum
proved to be inconclusive. A
compromise was reached, and
the students were replaced.
