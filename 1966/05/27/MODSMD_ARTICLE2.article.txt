The academic year 1965-66 was one
of student unrest. It was a year of
Vietnam and napalm; of liberalized
rules over worship; of sexual rights;
and the election of David Harris as
student body president.
Here are some of the high and low
points of Stanford University in its
74th year.
BLOOD FOR VlETNAM—Conflict
in Southeast Asia was a major theme
of national and campus news through
out the year. Protest came to the fore
front when a student committee
sought blood for victims of the Viet
Cong, and Stanford drew national at
tention for its first bleed-in.
NEW CAMPUS DEDICATED—A
resort hotel in Semmering, Austria,
became Stanford's fourth European
study center. A quarter later, Harlax
ton Manor in England was dedicated,
and students found a greater lan
guage barrier there than at any other
campus.
ANOTHER FRATERNITY GOES
LOCAL—Members of Alpha Kappa
Lambda, after a survey of alumni,
voted to leave their national organi
zation. The national then put them
on suspension. Renamed Lambda Nu,
the house became Stanford's third
local fraternity.

A NOISELESS COUP—While park
ing problems increased, many stu
dents (and faculty) took to the motor
cycle. Police reported 300 cycles reg
istered for the year, a 500 per cent
increase over former years.
GO, GO, FIVE IN A ROW An In
dian triumph over Cal, 9-7, gave the
Tribe its fifth straight Big Game
victory. Cal was ahead in the last
quarter, 7-3, but Stanford gained 70
yards in 11 plays for its winning
touchdown.
FONDLE IT—Although few took
them seriously at first, the Stanford
Sexual Rights Forum (SSRF)
emerged during dead week of fall
quarter. It later gained student sup
port, and a spring referendum re
sulted in a student request for free
distribution of contraceptives by the
Health Service. Student-Administra
tion discussion began, but contracep
tives which once were given out sud
denly weren't.
LOSS OF UNlON—Despite protest
from students, Union residence was
closed down to provide space for a
students' services center. Residents
bitterly criticized their displacement
to the sterile high rises, but soon
found their new quarters quite accept
able.
. A WORD FROM THE SPONSORS
—Winter quarter saw the beginning
of controversy over sponsor selection.
All 25 Wilbur sponsors originally re
