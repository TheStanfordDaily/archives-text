# Harris' Heroics, Jenks' Title Year's Best
## Harris Leads Stanford To Victory Over UCLA 
### BOB EGELKO 
They carried Art Harris off
the Pavilion floor on a Satur
day afternoon in January. They
poured down from the walls of
the ancient gym and covered the
floor, and moments later Harris,
a lithe sophomore from South
Los Angeles, was bobbing up
and down on their shoulders.
What Harris had just done
was to dazzle a TV audience, a
hoarsely partisan crowd, and the
UCLA defense for 40 minutes;
he had spun and leaped his way
to 24 points, and the Stanford
basketball team had beaten the
national champs from Westwood
for the first time, and probably

the last time, in a long while.
The 73 and 69 figures on the
scoreboard cost Stanford fans
an anxious afternoon as the
Cards, after a Bruin-style blitz
of their own, had to frustrate
repeated UCLA comeback at
tempts to come out on top.
It looked easy at the start.
Harris or Gary Petersmeyer
would pick off an uncertain
Bruin pass, dribble away from
the defenders themselves or hit
Bob Bedell or Howard Hassen
with a lead pass, and it was 21-7,
Stanford.
Then came the inevitable
UCLA surge. The full-court
press, which had carried the
Bruins to two straight national
titles, started forcing Stanford
mistakes as it had always done
in the past; Mike Warren, the
Bruins' newest gun, started to
find the range; and at 27-29,
UCLA was almost there.
They never made it, as they
never were to make it, largely
because Bedell, Hassen and Ray
Kosanke were only giving them
one shot on offense, and starting
to work the boards at the other

end; and there was always Har
ris, coming of age defensively
too, then moving down for a
soft 15-footer or snapping a sud
den pass to an open man.
It was 38-31 at the half, then
quickly 46-33 after the break,
and an unexpected Stanford
zone was stifling the visitors.
Then, as if they'd been saving
it for the end, the Bruins started
to shoot over the zone, and the
lead began to dissolve.
20-footers by Warren and
Freddie Goss, a couple of steals
by Kenny Washington and a few
"prayer" tip-ins, and all of a
sudden it was 60-58 and just a
matter of time.
Again it was the big men who
held them off, Bedell and Has
sen smothering UCLA inside,
Kosanke with continual pressure
on the offensive board, and the
lead swelled to six, then down
to two again and the defenders
swarming on Harris as he drib
bled upcourt.
Mike L.ynn made the big play,
the steal that should have won
it; but the Stanford guard had
position and the referee's
whistle signaled the foul to
shouts of disbelief from the
UCLA bench.
Harris coolly made the free
throws; moments later Peters
meyer hit two more in the
Bruins' desperation press; and
the exultant countdown, which
only accompanies a victory, had
already started when Harris hit
the last one-pointer to make it
73-69.
It didn't really matter that
UCLA turned out to be a sec
ond-place team this year, nor
that the Bruins took ample re
venge on Stanford later on in
Los Angeles, nor really that the
Cards' tenure on first place in
the conference was to be a short
one.
At least to the mob who car
ried Art Harris off the Pavilion
floor that afternoon it didn't
matter. They'd had their season.
