# Gaughran Named Coach Of The Year
## 
### ART SNYDER 
What is a coach? To know
Mr. James Gaughran is to come
into close contact with the mean
ing of "coach." He works hard,
is dedicated, gives inspiration,
and perhaps most importantly,
is willing to learn. He's not just
a "buddy," because he believes
that an athlete has an obliga
tion to himself, to his studies,
and to his own self-maturity.
Coach Gaughran is not new to
Stanford. He graduated from
Stanford in 1954 and went on to
graduate from Stanford Law in
1958. After passing the Califor
nia Bar that year, Jim went into
practice for two years before
starting to coach. At first he
tried coaching on a part time
basis in 1960. But he decided that
he must give up his practice
to coach full time.
Besides his personal accom
plishments in law, Jim went to
the 1956 Olympics in water polo.
In 1963, Coach Gaughran was
Assistant Coach for the Pan
American Games in water polo.
He was also selected in 1965 and

1966 to the United States Olym
pic Water Polo Committee.
Starting almost from scratch,
Coach Gaughran has built and
recruited both the water polo
and swimming teams to national
prominence. Next year's varsity
swim team should prove to be
the number one team in the na
tion.
The freshman team this year
came in third in the National
AAU's, only ten points behind
Yale's varsity. Such outstanding
swimmers as Dick Roth, Greg

Buckingham, Mark Parmely,
Luis Nicolao, Jim Laney, et al,
should fill the All-American
roster next year.
Roth presently holds the
world record in the 400 meter
individual medley for which he
won a gold medal at the Tokyo
Olympics. Nicolao last year be
came the National AAU butter
fly champ at 100 yards indoor
and 100 meters outdoors for
which he, too, set a world rec
ord.
Besides coaching the swim and
water polo teams, Coach Gaugh
ran has a summer swim school,
coaches at Chuck Taylor's
Mountain Camp, and has ini
tiated a program in skin and
scuba diving both for the sum
mer and during the regular
school year.
In the way of public service
Jim has taken the swim and
water polo teams to Hawaii dur
ing the winters of 1963 and 1964.
Here the team well represented
Stanford, training at Barber's
Point NAS, giving clinics for the
public schools in swimming and
water polo, and putting on a
water show for the Navy.
Some of Coach Gaughran's
past greats and Ail-Americans
include Peter Pettigrew (water
polo), Marty Hull (swimming
and water polo), Olympic cham
pion Ilka Suvanto (swimming),
Mike Eshleman (water polo),
Bill Ready (water polo), and
many others.
Water Polo Improved
In water polo, Stanford has
come a long way. In 1964 the
water polo team was among the
best in the nation, only four
short years since Jim took over
coaching.
Next year promises to be one
of the most promising seasons
in the history of Stanford swim
ming and water polo. It's only
been six years, and Coach
Gaughran has pushed and
coached his teams to the top.

that an athlete has an obliga
tion to himself, to his studies,
and to his own self-maturity.
Coach Gaughran is not new to
Stanford. He graduated from
Stanford in 1954 and went on to
graduate from Stanford Law in
1958. After passing the Califor
nia Bar that year, Jim went into
practice for two years before
starting to coach. At first he
tried coaching on a part time
basis in 1960. But he decided that
he must give up his practice
to coach full time.
Besides his personal accom
plishments in law, Jim went to
the 1956 Olympics in water polo.
In 1963, Coach Gaughran was
Assistant Coach for the Pan
American Games in water polo.
He was also selected in 1965 and

1966 to the United States Olym
pic Water Polo Committee.
Starting almost from scratch,
Coach Gaughran has built and
recruited both the water polo
and swimming teams to national
prominence. Next year's varsity
swim team should prove to be
the number one team in the na
tion.
The freshman team this year
came in third in the National
AAU's, only ten points behind
Yale's varsity. Such outstanding
swimmers as Dick Roth, Greg

Buckingham, Mark Parmely,
Luis Nicolao, Jim Laney, et al,
should fill the All-American
roster next year.
Roth presently holds the
world record in the 400 meter
individual medley for which he
won a gold medal at the Tokyo
Olympics. Nicolao last year be
came the National AAU butter
fly champ at 100 yards indoor
and 100 meters outdoors for
which he, too, set a world rec
ord.
Besides coaching the swim and
water polo teams, Coach Gaugh
ran has a summer swim school,
coaches at Chuck Taylor's
Mountain Camp, and has ini
tiated a program in skin and
scuba diving both for the sum
mer and during the regular
school year.
In the way of public service
Jim has taken the swim and
water polo teams to Hawaii dur
ing the winters of 1963 and 1964.
Here the team well represented
Stanford, training at Barber's
Point NAS, giving clinics for the
public schools in swimming and
water polo, and putting on a
water show for the Navy.
Some of Coach Gaughran's
past greats and Ail-Americans
include Peter Pettigrew (water
polo), Marty Hull (swimming
and water polo), Olympic cham
pion Ilka Suvanto (swimming),
Mike Eshleman (water polo),
Bill Ready (water polo), and
many others.
Water Polo Improved
In water polo, Stanford has
come a long way. In 1964 the
water polo team was among the
best in the nation, only four
short years since Jim took over
coaching.
Next year promises to be one
of the most promising seasons
in the history of Stanford swim
ming and water polo. It's only
been six years, and Coach
Gaughran has pushed and
coached his teams to the top.


JIM GAUGHRAN, COACH OF THE YEAR
What is a coach? To know
Mr. James Gaughran is to come
into close contact with the mean
ing of "coach." He works hard,
is dedicated, gives inspiration,
and perhaps most importantly,
is willing to learn. He's not just
a "buddy," because he believes
that an athlete has an obliga
tion to himself, to his studies,
and to his own self-maturity.
