# Boxer Captures Crown In First Varsity Season
## Daily Sports 
### TOM EDISON Sports Editor 
A good boxer must possess
speed, agility, and strength—
common attributes of any ath
lete. But more important is
his intensive desire to win and
supreme confidence in his com
petitive ability.
Stanford's boxer Tom Jenks
has all these traits.
Under the careful guidance of
his veteran coach, Ray Lunny,
Jenks has masterfully combined
these traits and through dedica
tion to training refined them
into a virtually unbeatable
fighting style.
Champ First Year
Jenks won the conference
championship this year — his
first year of college boxing. He
defeated Cal's Dave Archibald
and defending champ Raley
Beckett of Nevada to capture
the 172-pound division crown.
Jenks was impressive through
out the season although a nov
ice to the ringed sport.
In route to the conference
championship he won five of his
six bouts during the regular
season, losing only to Beckett
whom he later defeated in a title

bout. Sweet revenge for Stan
ford's sophomore scrapper.
Jenks is aggressive on offense
while employing his bobbing,
back-peddling style of attack to
ward off opposing blows.
His fighting tactics are to
work inside and harass his foe
with sharp, crisp shots to the
head and body. His first two
varsity bouts were won by
knockouts illustrating the power
and effectiveness of his punch
es.
In his initial bout in the con
ference boxing championships
he used right crosses and jabs

to keep Archibald on the defen
sive throughout the bout. Arch
ibald, who holds Cal's 440 record
with a 46.3 time, came into the
fight undefeated. Jenks sent his
Cal opponent to the mat in the
final round for a nine count and
won by an unanimous decision.
Tom was just as effective in
his final bout against Beckett.
Again Jenks brought his foe to
his knees for a nine count, this
time in the second round. Jenks
was awarded another unanimous
victory by the Nevada judges.
