# Civ Committee Poll Indicates Frosh Uncertain About Course
## 
### CHARLOTTE ACKERLEY Civ Comm 
Stanford freshmen do not seem to
agree on what the purposes of West
ern Civilization should be, nor are
they sure of what a year of Civ has
done for them.
In fact, the results of a recent poll
distributed to freshmen indicates that
the only thing they're certain about is
that Western Civ is worth taking
sometime.

The poll, sponsored by a newly
formed Committee to Evaluate Civ,
was designed to determine overall
freshman attitudes toward the course.
"We couldn't agree ourselves on
what the purposes or accomplish
ments of Civ are," said Pat McCone
ghy, chairman of the group. "This poll
was meant to find out what other
people thought they were."
Students were almost equally di
vided on what they considered the
most important purpose of an ideal
Civ course.
Forty-three percent indicated that
it should provide a broad background
of knowledge in history, philos.ophy
and politics, and 41 percent thought
its primary purpose was "to make the
student think about himself and his
relation to others."
A small number thought that Civ
should ideally acquaint students with

important names and ideas "which
will be studied in depth later," and a
few thought it should "shock the stu
dent out of pre-college ideas and stan
dards to make him receptive to new
ideas."
Broad Background
They were not, however, so defi
nitely divided on what they thought
were the main purposes of the present
Civ program.
One third agreed that it succeeded
in providing a broad background of
knowledge, and one fourth indicated
that they were "not sure" about pres
ent aims.
Sixteen percent thought it was de
signed to acquaint students with im
portant names and ideas to be con
sidered in depth at some later time;
fifteen percent believed it was to
"make the student think about him
self and his relation to others; twelve
percent thought the department in
tended to "shock students out of pre
college ideas and standards in order
to make him receptive to new ideas."
According to a member of the Civ
Comm, the group will draw up a re
port over the summer which will in
clude its recommendations and com
ments.
