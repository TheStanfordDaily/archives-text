# Education, Anyone?

### 
The latest rumblings from Inner Quad epit
omize what is slowly and painfully being re
vealed as the most difficult hurdle in Stanford's
leap toward greatness.
It appears as if certain members of the ad
ministration are preparing for a show-down over
the conflict in open-house hours regulations. The
Legislature, after an extensive study, passed a
liberalized set of rules on May 12. After the new
regulations went into effect last Friday, the
Dean's Office issued a statement reasserting the
University's version of open-house policy. Resi
dents assistants were told that "if individual stu
dent assistants were told that "if individual stu
for this University policy, the burden of respon
sibility must fall directly to residence staff mem
bers." The emerging message: the good deans
aren't about to let the students get away with
this one.
The conflict is essentially a petty one. It con
cerns an issue in which few students have any
deep interest, an issue which is highly peripheral
to the purpose of attendance at Stanford. And
yet, it is the issue upon which certain administra
tors, worried about a reactionary Board of Trus
tees, are choosing to take their stand.
It is this type of administrative mentality that
leads us to ask what is proving to be for many
an embarrassing question: does anybody in the
upper echelons of this University where more
money is spent for research than instruction
really care about education?
The answer, a cursory glance will show, is a
sorrowful "no." The President has done a com
mendable job garnering monies to raise salaries
and improve Stanford's physical plant. But he
is also occupied with placating parents, alumni,
Trustees, and the general public, and has had
little time to concern himself with the nuances
of education. The same is true of the Dean of
Students, who spends his time fending off stu
dents' demands that they be treated as adults.
And the Dean of Undergraduate Education, ob
livious to his title, is busy jostling with sponsors
and sit-iners. The list goes on —grown men quib
bling over haircuts, supposedly mature adults
crying over unspilt blood—ad nauseum.
Of course, students too indulge in the jostling.
But for them, it is not by choice. They don't
make the rules of the game, the administrators
and faculty do. They implore and beseech their
elders to rise above pettiness, to look beyond de
partmental rivalries and administrative politics,
to examine the larger issues, to take an overview
of Stanford as an academic institution. But their
pleas go unheeded. The vast majority of the stu
dents sits back to watch the game and laugh
at the players. And a small band of activists,
their senses of dedication out-weighing their
frustrations, spend the year chipping away bit
by bit at the sandstone wall, preferring to play
by the University's rules to not playing at all.
In the meanwhile the University makes some
changes. It modernizes an anachronistic liquor
policy and does away with discriminatory re
strictions on freedom of worship, and for weeks
administrators are seen slapping each other on
the back and relating jokes about their days in
the old Delt House. But the revisions are 10 to
70 years too late in coming, and the problems of

today, the problems of making Stanford into a
first-class educational institution, are ignored.
Naturally, there are reasons for this pettiness
of progress. "We have to live with the decisions
we make," one high administrator explained re
cently. "You kids are out of here after four years,
and then these things no longer concern you."
True, perhaps, but what this administrator
doesn't realize is that during those four years
students must live and learn not just with, but
under his decisions.
He reflects, we think, an over-concern with
the University's relation to society. For Stanford
to slip over "the edge of greatness," it is rea
soned, the University must have the financial
and moral backing of the Outer City. To gain
tliis support, the University must fulfill society's
definition of what an institution of higher educa
tion should be. But society being what it is, this
definition all too often means that the University
is asked to embody in its soul the prevailing so
cial norms: its rules and regulations must reflect
middle class values. "Students are expected to
show both within and without the University
such respect for order, morality, personal honor,
and the rights of others as is demanded of good
citizens," the Fundamental Standard reads. Short
haircuts and proper social hours are required for
the preservation of the Stanford image.
All too often, the decisions made in this con
text mitigate against the creation of a better at
mosphere for living and learning in Academe.
The University, by its nature, will always serve
society — its students will become tomorrow's
leaders, its knowledge will produce a better stan
dard of living and improved ethical values—but
such service, we feel, should only be a by-prod
uct of the education and enlightenment of the
individual.
The real tragedy, then, is in the loss of direc
tion. Decision-making at Stanford wavers from
the goal of excellence of education. The upper
echelons of the administration set nonacademic
policy in accordance with the dictates of society,
while paying only cursory attention to the aca
demic needs of an educational community. The
true purpose of the University is pushed aside
as administrators worry over rules and regula
tions.
It is doubtful, we think, that the "image syn
drome" of the current administrative generation
can be cured during its lifetime. The administra
tor's concern for the student's behavior is part of
an ingrained paternalism that does not die easily.
Two of the top academic posts in the adminis
tration are now falling vacant, and the Presi
dent's chair may be empty in a few years too, but
it is only a wild hope that these positions wall be
filled with true educators who are walling to de
vote themselves to education and leave the form
ulation of nonacademic regulations to the stu
dents. Perhaps genuine change will come only
when today's students become tomorrow's ad
ministrators.
In the meanwhile, the student body during
the past two years has shown its willingness both
to participate in an overhaul of the educational
process and to take over responsibility for the
details of student conduct. The University's lead
ership would be wise to take the students up on
their offer.
