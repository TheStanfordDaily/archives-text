## The 						Press Club In Number 10 
### Robert E. Stone 
As it passed on quietly into
the night very few members of
the Stanford community were
aware of the demise of the
\videly acclaimed Stanford Press
Club. Many people probably did
not know of the club's existence,
but it is befitting for this col
umn to take a moment to eulo
gize the passing of a dear and
respected friend.
President's Office
The Stanford Press Club was
established last weekend in the
office of the President of the
university. For a period of 50
hours it enjoyed an open exist
ence which afforded to its mem
bers, tired newsmen all, a place
to relax, and let them escape
from the reality of deadlines
and editorial judgements.
Among the many forms of re
laxation available to the press
in their beloved club were free
food, free drink, a quality radio
station, free telephone service,
and an exciting floor show. Ad
mission to the club was by press
card only.
Everything seemed to be prog
ressing smoothly, and it ap
peared that the Stanford Facul
ty Club was going to have some

severe competition when, with
out notice, and certainly without
invitation, the Stanford Police
raided the club. The raid was
ostensibly carried out to protect
the club's users from attack by
the hundreds of jealous students
and faculty that had gathered
outside.
Investigations
By Saturday morning it had
become clear that the police had
not come to the club to protect
its members, but instead to in
vestigate a complaint that the
club's floorshow was lewd and
lascivious. It seems that a group
of students, faculty, and admin
istrators had fallen victim to the
same type of moralist propa
ganda that caused the "topless
scandal" in San Francisco last
fall.
The officers of the club met
in a closed meeting to evaluate
the situation and see what
could be done. It was finally de
cided that voluntarily closing
the club would strengthen its
position when the case came to
trial and in negotiations for re
opening the establishment. At
2:30 p.m. Saturday afternoon

the Stanford Press Club closed
its doors for the last time. The
story of the club, however, is
not quite over.
Thirty on Trial
More than thirty employees
and entertainers of the club
were brought to trial yesterday
on charges of outraging public
decency. At the request of the
officers of the club, the trial
was open to the public, for it
was felt that if the public real
ly knew the situation the judges
could only dismiss the case.
Nothing was decided at the
trial yesterday, but it soon be
came evident that the real issue
in question was going to become
lost in the wall of verbiage that
was taken as testimony. There
is no way of knowing what the
final outcome will be, but it is
evident that the Stanford Press
Club will not be re-opened.
The loss of our club is being
sorely felt by every pressman
who had the good luck to be
able to enjoy its facilities. We
ask you to join with us in a mo
ment of silence for the demise
of what could have been another
step closer to the edge of great
ness.
