# Kadane: No More Baby-Sitting
## 
### 
(Editor's note: The following'
is the text of remarks by LASSU
Speaker Jay Kadane prepared
for delivery at last night's Legis
lature meeting.)
The issues brought up in the
past tumultuous weeks all re
late to one central question:
what should be the standards of
a great educational institution?
Student interest and pressure
in the last two years has sue
ceeded in raising the standard
of social maturity of a Stanford
student. No longer can the Uni
versity think of itself as baby-sit
ing for its students. This is the
meaning of the changes in liquor
rules and women's social regula
tions, and this is why the open
house hours question is being
pursued.
Increasingly in the past quar
ter, student attention and criti
cism is being directed against
the questionable quality of some
academic courses. If you look at
the Scratch Sheet, the most
damning thing they think of to
say is that a course is "Mickey
Mouse," a waste of time, not
enough content, not hard
enough.
Getting By
The reason many students feel
that few R.O.T.C. courses and
no athletic courses should re
ceive academic credit is that it
allows getting by too easily,
and we don't want that. Stu
dents are beginning to insist
that Stanford raise its academic
standards.
If student criticism is directed
at standards which are too low,
what then of standards of dress,
an alumnus might ask. Stan
dards of dress are at best an out
ward sign of an inwardly con
siderate person, and at worst a
superficial norm used to dis
tract attention from the serious
questions. Many of those at
Stanford who choose to reject
conventional standards of dress
do so in order to affirm their
deeper commitments to the
things one cannot judge so
quickly. To dismiss such people
as "beatniks" does injustice to
both the student and the on
looker.
Similarly, the question of the
University's standards in dealing
with the Federal government
have been a problem this quar
ter. Shall Stanford join Harvard
and MIT in rejecting on-campus
classified research, as incom
patible with the atmosphere of
free knowledge and debate a
campus should have?
The University has in the past
declined contracts which in
volved censorship of reports by
the sponsoring agency, and has
insisted that SLAC be an open
scientific facility.
Alums And Athletics
The University also has some
problems with its alumni in the
area of athletics. To most stu
dents, and I believe most ath
letes, the point of athletics is to
play one's best, and to maintain
a standard of sportsmanship.
But it is not appropriate for
the University to hire pseudo
student gladiators with lower
academic standards in order to
put on a show for former stu
dents who have no other contact
with Stanford.

This is a fault in Stanford's
program for its alumni. The
Alumni Conferences are valu
able in that they evoke memories
of when the alumnus was a stu
dent. But to be a student at
Stanford is a very different ex
perience now than it was three
years ago, let alone fifteen or
thirty years ago.
In order to acquaint interested
alumni with academic Stanford,
perhaps it would be possible to
allow alumni to come to Stan
ford and live and eat in a dormi
tory for a few days. Such visit
ing alumni should each have a
student host, be encouraged to
attend classes and extracurric
ular meetings, and participate in
student life. Perhaps in this way
these alumni could come to un
derstand the enormous potential
of the student movement at
Stanford.
Over Commitment
If our generation has a fault,
it is not detachment but over
commitment. We are told to be
come independent responsible
citizens, and insist on being al
lowed to develop our own in
dividuality. We are told we are
at Stanford to learn, and become
angry when there aren't suffi
cient opportunities for learning.
We are told to believe in democ
racy and want to know why the
University has such an authori
tarian structure.
A university becomes great
when a large group within it
comes to insist on nothing less.

In many places, it is the Admin
istration leading a school to
ward greatness. In others, the
faculty is leading the way.
At Stanford, the Administra
tion seems intent on giving way
to the future as slowly as it can
reasonably manage, and the fac
ulty, struggling to meet its
teaching and research respon
sibilities, has not yet begun to
meet its responsibilities toward
government at Stanford. It is
left then, to the student body
to encourage, prod, cajole, lead,
and sometimes push the other
groups toward a new and better
Stanford.
This fact, combined with the
lack of any legal justification for
a student voice in University af
fairs, gives rise to dangerous
possibilities, which increasingly
seem to be coming to pass.
Frustrations
Frustrations have built up this
past year because even when a
question appears easy to solve,
its solution takes much too long.
As a case in point, it took con
sideration at three separate
Board of Trustees meetings to
achieve what we have on free
dom of worship, and we still
have unanswered exactly what a
"major non-Christian faith" is
and why Christian groups that
prefer to use facilities other
than Memorial Church may not
do so.
The recent sit-in was a token
of the failure of student-faculty
administration dialogue ade

quately to provide a place for
groups to argue their cases and
try to persuade the community
of the justice of their cause.
We have far too many non
public committees moving too
slowly. In fact the whole Uni
versity seems to be suffering
from an acute case of "commit
teeitis." Committees are useful
in working out details once the
"general will" has become evi
dent, but are rarely useful in
shaping the "general will."
Town Meeting
Perhaps it would be useful to
have a town-meeting style for
um, having at first only what
ever moral authority it can mus
ter, and taking sense-of-the-meet
ing votes. If administrators and
faculty, as well as students,
were willing to participate in
such a forum, perhaps we could
all use it to try to reexamine at
titudes toward Stanford and
each other, free from the legalis
tic considerations.
Looking toward next year,
Stanford faces more opportunity
and greater danger than perhaps
it ever has. With an administra
tion that wishes to expedite and
fulfill the changes that are oc
curing, Stanford could become
one of America's most exciting
educational institutions.
With an administration intent
only on holding back the clock,
on maintaining face at the price
of progress, the confrontation
everyone wishes to avoid could
be forced upon us.
