## Student Activism A Monster? 
### Tim Haight 
What with the recent trends
in student activism, many have
come to perceive the acceptance
of a new mythology. The admin
istration is seen by the students
as a monolithic structure dedi
cated to their coercion; the stu
dents are seen by the adminis
tration and the alumni as san
dal-wearing, FSM-loving, beard
growing radicals. Everybody is
generalizing about everybody
else.
It is, however, hardly new to
say, "The majority of Stanford
students aren't active." Nor is
it really a sign of insight to de
clare that there are individuals
in the faculty and administra
tion who have very differing
views on how a university
should be set up.
Real Division
What is surprising, however,
is that there is so much real
opposition all along the line, so
much division. We have often
considered it sort of the "natu
ral function" of administration
to be conservative, and the nor
mal state of things for students
to be radical.
But to a large degree, we are
the creations of the administra
tion. We are the products of the
education which we have ac
quired here. When Dr. Walker
worries about how much criti
cism students make about the
university, he should remember

that it is his office that sent
them overseas. That experience
is one that has liberalized many
a student.
And when the Committee on
General Studies debates to what
extent it can exclude students
from confidential parts of its
meetings, the Committee might
remember that part of the oppo
sition by the students is a hand
me-down from the examples of
Socrates, Abelard, or Voltaire
that students picked up in that
General Studies course, Western
Civ.
In fact, President Sterling,
who has so significantly raised
the standards of the University
in the last fifteen years, 6hould
realize that a change from a
relatively provincial instittuion
to a great university is bound to
bring along some really respon
sible student-initiated action for
change.
He has in fact intimated this.
At the Alumni conference last
weekend he said, to the best of
my recollection, "If we tell the
6tudents they are bright often
enough, we cannot be surprised
if some of them start believing
it." He does fear irresponsibility,
however. That is a just fear.
Lines Unclear
But the lines between what
may and may not be irresponsi
ble are not always clear. They
require definition through inten

sive contact and frank discus
sion.
One of the factors that seems
to be intimidating this contact
is the need for money from the
alumni. This is obvious. Only
about 40 per cent of the general
operating costs of the Univer
sity are covered by tuition. We
are a gift-supported University.
But we must realize that the
strides that we have made in
the last fifteen years have
created a gap in the type of edu
cation students have received.
And the alumni of today were
the students of that other Stan
ford. They are not the products
of the overseas campus system,
the general studies program, or
of contact with such a great
faculty in such a rapidly-improv
ing plant. Yet, probably because
of the money, the administra
tion and faculty cannot side
with those who are the products
of its aspirations for improve
ment but must defer to the type
of student we are trying to re
place.
The science-fiction cliche of
the monster turning on Frank
enstein is too prevalent in our
culture. The administration may
see the activists of today as the
malfunctions of their efforts for
change. But they are the crea
tions, an'l they should bp worked
with as an aciva-io-ment, not a
runaway monster.
