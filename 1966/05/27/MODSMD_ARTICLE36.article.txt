# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## Try Again, Mister McGinn 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Robert McGinn's letter in
May 20's Daily is a knee-jerk re
action on the basis of (1) a mis
quote and (2) a failure to read
the original article by Professor
Drachkovitch on the "New Left"
which is in question.
Dr. Drachkovitch did not sug
gest in his essay in Western
Politica that anyone who op
poses U. S. Vietnam policy is
pro-Communist. He would be the
first to disavow such an asser
tion.
The article in the Daily on
May 10 misquoted the essay (un
doubtedly unintentionally), com
bining phrases from pages 7 and
14 into a single sentence. (I un
derstand the article was a Uni
versity News Service release,
not a Daily article.)
What Drachkovitch found to
be "symbolic" of the ease of
slipping merely neutral "a-Com
munism" to "pro-Communism"
was not opposition to U. S. pol
icy (p. 7).
Rather what was symbolic
was the evident support for the
Viet Cong and the ignoring of
their atrocities, shown by Lynd's
statements and his trip to Ha
noi and other Communist capi
tals with the leading theoreti
cian of the U.S. Communist
Party, Herbert Aptheker (p. 14).
Mr. McGinn's rude letter and
reference to "muddle - headed
reasoning" evidence the fact,
however, that he has not read
the Drachkovitch essay in the
original. In commenting before
doing so he is derelict in his
duties as a scholar.
Several hundred copies of
Western POHtlca were distrib
uted to faculty and students a
week ago; Mr. McGinn may ob
tain one from me if he does not
have a copy, yet cares to read
and think before further insult
ing professors.

• A Changing World
Editor, The Daily:
Mrs. Rosamond Clarke Ba
con's letter which appeared in
the Daily on May 25 appears to
be the creation of an archaic
mind. Mrs. Bacon suffers from
an acute case of Babbitry.
She is upset by the fact that
the appearance of certain Stan
ford students does not coincide
with her model of middleclass
values. Their "dirty feet" and
the dirt in their ears offend her.
She seems to threaten 6tudent
activists and tells us not to un
derestimate the power of a wom
an—especially a woman who is
a faculty wife. She also accuses
graduate Teaching Assistants of
attempting "to wreck" the uni
versity.
Most Stanford students do not
underestimate the power of a
woman. But most Stanford stu
dents realize that a woman's
place is not at White Memorial
Plaza reprimanding students for
not washing their feet and ears!
May I point out that Mrs. Ba
con, who has devoted most of
her life to Stanford students, is
not helping her cause any by
writing letters condemning
"beatniks", T.A.'s and rebellious
youths. Furthermore, Mrs. Ba
con ought to face up to the fact
that the world is forever chang
ing and so are the people in it.

• Reply On Beye
Editor, The Daily:
In reply to Mr. Kugelmass
and Mr. Fox, The Dally, May
23, I feel compelled to say that
anyone who never has the
chance to meet Charlie Beye
should consider himself very for
tunate indeed.
Dr. Beye is without doubt one
of the most destructive forces
on campus. He has willfully and
maliciously caused many inno
cent students to think. And what
is worse, he staunchly refuses to

tell them just how they ought
to think.
His favorite refrain is "Just
be happy." And he means it
quite literally (literally, but not
superficially). If you care, it
gives you a lot to wonder about.
But don't for a moment get
lost in your own meditation. No
body belongs in a corner—not if
they know Dr. Beye. It's very
important, and a little frighten
ing, and beautiful.
May the plague of Athens
take him. As he himself said,
thinking is on the way out.

• A New Center
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to make a sug
gestion to which I hope the
University will give serious con
sideration: that Stanford estab
lish a center for the formal
study of parapsychological phe
nomena — psychological events
alleged to have occurred, for
which current theory offers no
explanation.
To dismiss a set of data a
priori is to abandon all possi
bility of understanding it. If
parapsychological phenomena,
such as those discussed in the
Tresidder lecture series last
year, actually occur, it is only
through rigorous investigation
that scientific theories can be
developed to explain their na
ture and cause.
Were such an investigation to
demonstrate the existence of
these phenomena, man would
have gained further insight into
his nature. If, however, investi
gation proved their non-exist
ence, he would nonetheless have
increased his knowledge, and
could then pass on to other
areas of inquiry.
I do not believe that any mat
ter potentially relevant to an
understanding of the nature of
man can be taken lightly, for
man's knowledge of himself is
perhaps as limited as the appre

hension of a clipper ship cap
tain approaching an iceberg.
And, as Jung points out, when
man realizes that he will find
no ultimate satisfaction in the
externalities of technology and
material achievement, he will
be compelled to seek a deeper
understanding of his own na
ture.
Thu6, Stanford could make a
monumental contribution to
man's knowledge, were the Uni
versity to establish such a cen
ter. To do so would be entirely
within University tradition.
Near the turn of the century,
Thomas Stanford gavj the Uni
versity a grant ox $50,(XX) to en
dow a chair for psychical re
search.
As a result, experiments in
parapsychology were performed
and reported; an additional gift
established a collection of books
on the subject.

• Review Slip-Ups
Editor, The Daily:
I wish to record my disap
pointment in the inadequate
coverage given to certain
courses in the "Stanford Course
Review."
With the exception of a first
year survey series, the French
Department has been over
looked in one of its major func
tions: giving courses in French
majors. This is the second year
in which this omission has oc
curred.
If this student publication is
to give an unbiased and repre
sentative view of our depart
ments, it must r ' restrict itself
to a small segmm' of offerings.
The typographical .>r~ors are in
deed unfortunate, and I particu
larly regret being rof rred to as
