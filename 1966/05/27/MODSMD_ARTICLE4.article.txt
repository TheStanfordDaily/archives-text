# Judicial Council Hears Protesters; Accepts Plea Of 'Nolo Contendere'
## 
### ROBERT E. STONE WILLIAM E. WILLIAMS 
Judicial Council adjourned early
this morning after hearing testimony
from several students accused of
violating the Fundamental Standard
during the sit-in at the President's
Office last weekend. The Council is
tentatively scheduled to reconvene in
Room E-2 at 4 this afternoon to an
nounce its verdict.
During yesterday's marathon eight
hour session, the Council accepted
pleas of nolo contendere from the 36
accused students.
While the demonstrators admitted
that they were, in fact, in the Presi

dent's Office at the time in question,
they contended that this did not con
stitute a violation of the Fundamental
Standard.
In a review of the facts of the dem
onstration, the Council established
the following points:
• University functions were indeed
disrupted.
• The students in the office at the
time names were taken were fully
aware of the University regulations.
• There was no intimidation of the
demonstrators by police or adminis
trators.
• There was no threat of forcible
eviction.

Associate Dean of Students Joel
Smith referred to the demonstrators'
testimony as a "systematic miscon
struction of the events of Saturday
morning.
The opening of the evening session
brought a shift from concern with the
ocurences during the sit-in to concern
with the motives and feelings of the
participants—both administrators and
demonstrators. The thoughts of the
demonstrators, most of which have
been expressed before in leaflets and
White Plaza rallies, centered around
the "inequity" of the selective service
system and the "unilateral" decision
of the administration to permit Stan

ford's facilities to be used for the
draft test. Dean Winbigler spoke to
the Council, saying that since no one
was being forced to take the test and
since he had no knowledge of what
was in the test, the "social and moral"
question was not part of the issue
facing the Council. He called for a
decision on more relevant grounds.
Dave Harris, President-elect of the
Associated Students, testified that he
was in sympathy with the demonstra
tors' views, and until late Friday he
believed there might be a compromise.
But when no moves toward discussion
were forthcoming, he decided "no
compromise could be worked out, so
I felt the tactic was dead."
If the Judicial Council returns a
verdict of 4 'Not Guilty," the case may
be appealed to a faculty committee.
This committee could charge the de
fendants with two offenses: breaking
University regulations and violating
the Fundamental Standard. It is the
current oplicy of the Judicial Councils
that a violation of University regula
tions is a violation of the Funda
mental Standard. The Council may
only try violations of the Fundamen
tal Standard.

fendants with two offenses: breaking
University regulations and violating
the Fundamental Standard. It is the
current oplicy of the Judicial Councils
that a violation of University regula
tions is a violation of the Funda
mental Standard. The Council may
only try violations of the Fundamen
tal Standard.
Judicial Council adjourned early
this morning after hearing testimony
from several students accused of
violating the Fundamental Standard
during the sit-in at the President's
Office last weekend. The Council is
tentatively scheduled to reconvene in
Room E-2 at 4 this afternoon to an
nounce its verdict.
During yesterday's marathon eight
hour session, the Council accepted
pleas of nolo contendere from the 36
accused students.
While the demonstrators admitted
that they were, in fact, in the Presi

dent's Office at the time in question,
they contended that this did not con
stitute a violation of the Fundamental
Standard.
In a review of the facts of the dem
onstration, the Council established
the following points:
• University functions were indeed
disrupted.
• The students in the office at the
time names were taken were fully
aware of the University regulations.
• There was no intimidation of the
demonstrators by police or adminis
trators.
• There was no threat of forcible
eviction.

Associate Dean of Students Joel
Smith referred to the demonstrators'
testimony as a "systematic miscon
struction of the events of Saturday
morning.
The opening of the evening session
brought a shift from concern with the
ocurences during the sit-in to concern
with the motives and feelings of the
participants—both administrators and
demonstrators. The thoughts of the
demonstrators, most of which have
been expressed before in leaflets and
White Plaza rallies, centered around
the "inequity" of the selective service
system and the "unilateral" decision
of the administration to permit Stan

ford's facilities to be used for the
draft test. Dean Winbigler spoke to
the Council, saying that since no one
was being forced to take the test and
since he had no knowledge of what
was in the test, the "social and moral"
question was not part of the issue
facing the Council. He called for a
decision on more relevant grounds.
Dave Harris, President-elect of the
Associated Students, testified that he
was in sympathy with the demonstra
tors' views, and until late Friday he
believed there might be a compromise.
But when no moves toward discussion
were forthcoming, he decided "no
compromise could be worked out, so
I felt the tactic was dead."
If the Judicial Council returns a
verdict of 4 'Not Guilty," the case may
be appealed to a faculty committee.
This committee could charge the de
fendants with two offenses: breaking
University regulations and violating
the Fundamental Standard. It is the
current oplicy of the Judicial Councils
that a violation of University regula
tions is a violation of the Funda
mental Standard. The Council may
only try violations of the Fundamen
tal Standard.
