### JOE ROSENBLOOM 
In its final meeting of Ihe school
year, the Legislature last night ap
proved a $127,500 ASSU budget for
next year.
Its general bent was to reduce allo
cations to traditional, social activi
ties in favor of increased educational
and political expenditures.

It reduced the allocation for the
President Wallace Sterling's tea dur
ing pre-registration from the usual
$105 to $75, while it allocated no funds
at all to the Axe Commission for its
traditional "Cal Breakfast."
But the Legislature substantially in
creased its allocation to the Political
Union from a budgeted $3,950 to

$4,950 to encourage more political
speakers on campus.
It also provided an additional $1,000
to the Institute for International Re
lations for various projects, although
no appropriations were given for the
lIR-sponsored Stanford United Na
tions and Model United Nations.
Instead, funds were provided for a
Southeast Asian Cultural Conference,
for a Brazilian, student-exchange pro
gram, and for the Vagabond, a for
eign-travel guide.
At the end of the five-hour, budget
hashing session about $8,700 remained
in the ASSU contingency fund for
next year.
In other action the Legislature ap
propriated $300 to the Speaker's Ac
count to be used for a special issue
of The Daily if needed, during the re
mainder of this year. The move was
to protect the students against sur
prise action by the administration af
ter The Daily has ceased publication.
Also, the Legislature unanimously
commended Speaker Jay Kadane for
his contribution to student govern
ment this year.
