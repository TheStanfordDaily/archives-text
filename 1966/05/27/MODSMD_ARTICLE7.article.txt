## Layout Doesn't Reflect Content 
### JANIE ARIES 
The spring edition of Sequoia, edited
by Susan Jackson, combines a very
unconventional layout with more se
riously artistic literary content.
The unconventionality of the layout
is not totally reflective of the content,
however. The Sequoia contains two
essays, two short stories and the usual
abundance of poetry. Of the thirteen
contributors, only four are under
graduates, the rest being graduate
students and faculty.
The only generality one might make
about the content is that one is always
conscious of the style. In many of the
pieces, one has the feeling that the
authors are playing with words for
their own sake, for the pleasure of
combining them in unique ways. The
content is subordinated to the form.
This is especially evident in the two
short stories.
Story Witty
Rob Ashford in his story called
"One's a Crowd," about a man who

rejoices in the unity of a crowd, has
long lisls of synonyms to describe
things. The story is not overwhelmed
by the style, however, and emerges
witty and revealing.
The other story, "Pebblemen on
Wire." by Albert Selgirts, is less suc
cessful. In his attempt to describe the
strained relationship between a girl
and a boy seeking reality, the theme
tends to get lost in the images and
metaphors. The beginning of the
story, a description evoking the ir
reality of the night, is excellent, how
ever.
The essays are probably the best
selections. The first by H. Bruce
Franklin deals with how the United
States started the war against North
Vietnam. Although the author has a
definite position, he does not get car
ried away with it but presents a con
cise, well documented description of
the events leading to the present
bombing raids.
The other essay on Brecht, by Ken

neth Mills of the philosophy depart
ment, would probably be most inter
esting to those familiar with Brecht's
writing, yet it is comprehensible even
if one is not. Mills deals with the im
portance of Marxist ideology in
Brecht, and how pertinent a knowl
edge of Marx is to understanding
Brecht.
Poet ry Forma)
All the poetry is more or less for
mally structured, rather than being
free verse where one wonders if it is a
bunch of words or a brilliant esoteric
creation.
"Reality, Beautiful Bully" by Eliza
beth Yount., a senior English major,
deftly captures the futility of words
to describe beauty. "Sed Tu Mortua,
Non Vetula Es" a characterization of
the Latin poet Hortensius by Kenneth
Fields is reminiscent of Robert Frost
in its dry sensitive humor.
David Ransom and Igor Webb are
also creative and original in their
poems.
