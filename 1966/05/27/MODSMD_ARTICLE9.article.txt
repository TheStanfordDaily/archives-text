tor, was not presented to President
Wallace Sterling yesterday as had

while disapproving of the tactics used,
was intended to show community sup
port for the demonstrators.
Herschberg explained that he had
only received 100 signatures prior to
the Judicial Council proceedings yes
terday. However, this figure does not
include the petitions from the various
departments nor from the living
groups.
"I would be surprised if the total
exceeds 250," Herschberg continuad.
"Apathy about the issue was apparent
among members of the student body."
Herschberg said, "The reason given
by individuals who bothered to com
ment on why they would not sign the
petition was that the petition was not
sympahetic enough to those who par
ticipated in the demonstration."
Herschberg, who expressed his own
personal belief that the demonstrators
acted in good faith, felt that lack of
organization and publicity may have
influenced the results.
