# HUTCHINSON RESIGNS!!!
## 
### 
Dr. Eric Hutchinson, the
first faculty-master of Wil
bur Hall, resigned last week
after a controversy that
lasted ten months.
The University announc
ed that Joe Higgins, former
faculty resident at Wilbur,
would replace Hutchinson.
Hutchinson, a professor or
chemistry, took the job last
summer. In an interview for

The Stanford Daily, he said
that the overall purpose of
the p -ogram was "to foster
a sch<Jarly intellectual at
mosphei 11 in the living
groups."
The facui' y - master pro
gram was intended to make
Wilbur Hall an autonomous
unit. According to Dean of
Undergraduate Education
Robert Wert, quoted by The
Daily on September 24, 1965,
"The faculty - master will
have wide perogatives with
few guidelines laid down by
the administration."
By March 1, 1966, The Dai
ly was editorializing, "The
autonomy myth surround
ing the faculty-master plan
is dead. An autopsy shows
that Eric Hutchinson has no
more control over Wilbur
Hall than the Sailing Club
over the weeds in Lake Lag.
The biggest problem was
centered around the selec
tion of the next group of
Wilbur sponsors. In the past,
the sponsors, who act as ad
visors to the freshmen, have
chosen their own successors.
As early as August 9, 1965,
in a release to Wie sponsors,

Hutchinson said, "Presum
ing at this time that spon
sors will continue to be an
important component of the
House structure, I am sure
that there will have to be
changes in the process of
sponsor selection."
Hutchinson and the spon
sors met head-on over- the
question, "Should the facul
ty-master have a veto over
the decisions of the sponsor
selection committee?"
This question was debated
by the Committee of Under
graduate Education and the
student legislature. In early
May, just before the selec
tion of sponsors was sched
uled to begin, a solution was
reached.
At press time it was not
apparent if the faculty
master program would be
continued. "Hutchinson's re
placement, Joe Higgins, told
The Weekly that he is not
sure that the term "faculty
master" will be used again
and that he expects to as
sume the duties of director
of Wilbur Hall. Higgins has
been a faculty resident for
two years and was program
director last year.
