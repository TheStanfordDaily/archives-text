# Brown: Three Words
## 
### 
Stanford's class of '66,
hopefully, will take three
key words with them when
they leave the University,
Prof. Robert McAfee Brown
told a Class Day audience
Saturday afternoon, June
11, in Memorial Auditorium.
"The first is a fighting
word — commitment," the
Stanford theologian told
them. "The second is a mis
understood word — integri
ty — and the third is a for
gotten word — wonder.
"Commitment," he said,
"is a fighting word because
it seems to involve a sellout
of the purpose of the uni
versity as the place for the
cultivation of an open mind.
To talk about commitment

within the university, so the
charge runs, is to substitute
indoctrination for investiga
tion, propaganda for scru
tiny.
"To be blunt, it's a battle
field of commitments, and
let's not ever forget it. If it
is a place to question past
commitments, it is also a
place to question past com
mitments, it is also a place
to test new ones, to engage
not only in the willing su
spension of belief but of dis
belief as well.
"You'll have to clarify
your own priorities, to dis
cover what your real com
mitments are, so that hope
fully thought and action
can become more nearly

one," he told the seniors.
"I nt e g,r i t y," he said
"means wholeness or undi
videdness ,the state of be
ing whole.
"We have obligations be
yond just our Own individu
ality per se; we have obli
gations and responsibilities
to the very structures that
sustain us even as we revolt
against them, to those
things that make our com
munal life possible.
"The voice of protest must
seek dialogue and not sim
ply disruption if it is to be a
responsible voice, and as we
seek for deeper levels of in
tegrity we will find them, I
suggest, in those things that
relate us more fully to oth
ers, rather than disengag
ing us from them.
"Wonder," he said, "means
in Rabbi Abraham Heschel's
words, 'a renaissance of
wonder' — for the recovery
of a sense of mystery, for a
recognition that we have
not begun to explore
Prof. Brown quoted a sci
entific friend who divides
scientists into two groups,
the "so what" and the "gee
whiz."
"I'm pleading for more of
the latter in every field of
human inquiry." he told the
seniors.
