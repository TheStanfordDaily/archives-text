# Draft Protesters Discuss Policy At Faculty Hearing
## 
### 
Students protesting draft
examinations waited more
than six weeks before mak
ing their concerns known to
the University, a Stanford
faculty hearing on selective
service was told.
John D. Black, director of
the University's Counseling
and Testing Center, which
administered the ?xams,
said refusal to give tne tests
at the last minute would
have comprised a >'mild
form of civil disobedience"
by the University and de
prived 850 students of a
chance to take the tests.
"I still find it difficult to
understand why a demand
so coercive and so heedless
of the rights of others was
pressed with such fervor,"
Black told members of the
Academic Council Executive
Committee.
In all the Committee
heard 17 witnesses in the
orderly, two - hour session,
which was attended by 100
persons in Cubberley Audi
torium. The largest single
group there were students
who had participated in the
recent sit-in at the Presi
dential Office Building.
John S. Shippee, graduate
student in political science,
said the University's Na
tional Service Office dis
criminated against consci
entious objectors. While it
refers students who express
an interest in C.O. status to
the American Friends Serv
ice Committee in San Fran
cisco, it has refused to post
notices of where this coun
seling may be obtained on
campus or allow C.O. spokes
men to participate in panels
on military service, he char
ged.
David Harris, student bo
dy president-elect, said the
draft "is another element of
fear which pushes (the stu
dent) in his attempt to find
knowledge."
He said events leading to
the sit-in had shown that
the University's decision
making process was "woe
fully inadequate" and in
need of complete reorganiz
ation.
He called for the Univers
ity to refuse its facilities for
selective service tests, elimi
nate the national servilee

adviser, decline to give
grades or class standing ev
en if requested by the stu
dent, and stop providing
academic credit and facili
ties for ROTC.
Robert Clark, freshman
ROTC cadet, noted that the
attitudes of the draft pro
test group toward a student
referendum on the tests
contrast markedly with the
views of most of the same
students toward the recent
campus poll on contracep
tive policy.
Keith Lowe, spokesman
for the sit-in group, told the
executive committee: "Giv
en your position in the Aca
demic Council and the pow
er structure of this Univers
ity, (I question) whether
you understand the distinc
tion between democratic
procedure and real, substan
tive democracy."
"There's a chain of com
mand" at the University,
running from the trustees
through the administration
and faculty, with "students
at the bottom," he added.
"That's clear to us.
"We're not in any volun
tary position. Decisions have
been made for us, and for
you."

torium. The largest single
group there were students
who had participated in the
recent sit-in at the Presi
dential Office Building.
John S. Shippee, graduate
student in political science,
said the University's Na
tional Service Office dis
criminated against consci
entious objectors. While it
refers students who express
an interest in C.O. status to
the American Friends Serv
ice Committee in San Fran
cisco, it has refused to post
notices of where this coun
seling may be obtained on
campus or allow C.O. spokes
men to participate in panels
on military service, he char
ged.
David Harris, student bo
dy president-elect, said the
draft "is another element of
fear which pushes (the stu
dent) in his attempt to find
knowledge."
He said events leading to
the sit-in had shown that
the University's decision
making process was "woe
fully inadequate" and in
need of complete reorganiz
ation.
He called for the Univers
ity to refuse its facilities for
selective service tests, elimi
nate the national servilee

adviser, decline to give
grades or class standing ev
en if requested by the stu
dent, and stop providing
academic credit and facili
ties for ROTC.
Robert Clark, freshman
ROTC cadet, noted that the
attitudes of the draft pro
test group toward a student
referendum on the tests
contrast markedly with the
views of most of the same
students toward the recent
campus poll on contracep
tive policy.
Keith Lowe, spokesman
for the sit-in group, told the
executive committee: "Giv
en your position in the Aca
demic Council and the pow
er structure of this Univers
ity, (I question) whether
you understand the distinc
tion between democratic
procedure and real, substan
tive democracy."
"There's a chain of com
mand" at the University,
running from the trustees
through the administration
and faculty, with "students
at the bottom," he added.
"That's clear to us.
"We're not in any volun
tary position. Decisions have
been made for us, and for
you."
Students protesting draft
examinations waited more
than six weeks before mak
ing their concerns known to
the University, a Stanford
faculty hearing on selective
service was told.
John D. Black, director of
the University's Counseling
and Testing Center, which
administered the ?xams,
said refusal to give tne tests
at the last minute would
have comprised a >'mild
form of civil disobedience"
by the University and de
prived 850 students of a
chance to take the tests.
"I still find it difficult to
understand why a demand
so coercive and so heedless
of the rights of others was
pressed with such fervor,"
Black told members of the
Academic Council Executive
Committee.
In all the Committee
heard 17 witnesses in the
orderly, two - hour session,
