Hoover Tower.
Yes, that's the tallest building on campus and you may not
go up to the fourteenth floor where the observation tower is
located.
That's because two people jumped off the tower last
year.
The administration is refusing to let anyone else go to
the top of the tower and this ban has been in effect since
last August.
At first we were told that the observation platform
would be closed until a fence or some other means could be
installed to prevent future suicides.
But that was ten months ago.
One would think that the administration could have de
vised some way of preventing suicides but also allowing visitors
to the tower. Hoover Tower has been ignored.
Even if the administration were to use something as
simple as chicken wire, visitors could be allowed to take the
elevator ride to the top.
Apparently we can't even afford chicken wire.
No sir.
The money is being used to build libraries that will
hold only 100,000 books. The main library has over 1,500,000
volumes.
The money is being used to build new qu?rters for one
of the largest trade schools in the country, the Graduate
School of Business.
Hie money is being used to build parking lots to destroy
the beauty of the campus.
The money is being used to support the fiasco of the
athletic department.
That's why you will never get to the top of Hoover Tower
this quarter.
