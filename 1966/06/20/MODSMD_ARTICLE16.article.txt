To the Editor:
Now that all the other
alumni have been heard
from, may I weigh in with
my own paean of praise to
the architect of victory in
the Battle of Morrison's
locks?
First off, and four
square, I yield to no one,
man or boy, honored alum
nus or callow undergrad,
bald or beattle-cut, in my
admiration of the gratitude
for this well-Taylored, this
Sterling display of adminis
trative grace. I am wont to
suggest that henceforth, as
lovingly our thoughts trend
back to the true alma mater,
we think of it not as The
Farm, but as Peyton's Place.
It is comforting to know
that nestled at the foot of
the foothills we call our own,
resides a public relations
genius hitherto uni/evealed
— but evermore poised to
the occasion.
Only one thing bugs me:
What if a future generation
ever names as its student
leader a Stan ford-enrollee
who also delights in the un
conventional, whose hirsute
ways are strange?
Won't we hear from the'
old administration then!
And the old grad! And
won't the old scissors snip
and the old comments rip in
Peyton's Place! Zap! Zowie!

Responsible?

To the Editor:
When will the so-called
"responsible adult popula
lation" stop making an issue
out of long hair, beards, san
dals and other standard
non-conformist attire?
To sling the term "beat
nik" or "Vietnik" at anyone
who does not conform to the

well-scrubbed norm is but to
label, and to label is to some
people synonomous with
possession. Once the rubric
applied, the name - caller
can relax: he has neatly
paced another human being
into one of his tight little
categories.
Those who label him
"beatnik" are, on the other
hand, content to stop at the
superficial level of appear
ance: the word obviates the
discomforting process of
facing he real issues that lie
behind mere physical de
meanor. The "beatnik's"
beard and long hair make
him necessarily immoral.
Fine, but the person who
confuses superficial ques
tions such as dress with the
grave issues which confront
the U.S. has prevented the
basis for dialogue. He has
further forced the non-con
formist into what was al
ready a desperate position.
Physical appearance is at
best a matter of fashion and
should be recognized as
such. It retains no necessary
link with morality, any more
than do the "Mothers for a
Moral America" whose film
about pornography was ban
ned by Barry Goldwater, or
jthe American Nazi Party
[with their crewcuts and
well-polished SS boots.
Christ, after all, was the
archetypal "beatnik," and
no one in those times even
bugged him about the way
he looked So wake up "re
sponsible ones" to the fact
that appearance is a matter
of individual taste aaid by
no means permits you to
look the other way when the
true issues of morality arise.

PROTEST?

To the Editor:
"Say kids let's have a pro
test. We don't really know
what we're protesting, but I
don't like tests. Tests are an
insult to my intelligence.
Anyway, can caucus af
ter the protest and dream
up some goals. Maybe we
should have protested last
month so that we could de
termine our goals and stop
the test before it starts.
Well, a protest, no matter
how untimely and undefin
ed, is better than no protest
at all."
These thoughts seem to be
the central issues surround
ing the recent draft protest.
However, one of the aims of
this University and most
others is to make men out
of irrational children. I view
the recent protest as an or
ganized temper tantrum. It
is one thing to think out
your views and go through

the channels organized to
administer policy to voice
dissent, and it is another to
create a civil disobedience
for the sake of having your
childishness recognized by
your peers.
These facts become very
apparent to the Men of ATO
when one of the showered
protestors, shouting invec
tives, ran up to a group of
us and explained to us that
he wasn't protesting. He
stated that he merely want
ed to find out what the pro
test was about, assuming (I
believe) that protests were
supposed to have defined
purposes. He was sorrowful
ly disappointed.
It is my fervent hope that,
in the future, our discon
tented fellow students will
think before they act. If
they don't think, then they
have reason to fear the
draft test, although they
may choose not to take it.

PROTEST?

To the Editor:
"Say kids let's have a pro
test. We don't really know
what we're protesting, but I
don't like tests. Tests are an
insult to my intelligence.
Anyway, can caucus af
ter the protest and dream
up some goals. Maybe we
should have protested last
month so that we could de
termine our goals and stop
the test before it starts.
Well, a protest, no matter
how untimely and undefin
ed, is better than no protest
at all."
These thoughts seem to be
the central issues surround
ing the recent draft protest.
However, one of the aims of
this University and most
others is to make men out
of irrational children. I view
the recent protest as an or
ganized temper tantrum. It
is one thing to think out
your views and go through

the channels organized to
administer policy to voice
dissent, and it is another to
create a civil disobedience
for the sake of having your
childishness recognized by
your peers.
These facts become very
apparent to the Men of ATO
when one of the showered
protestors, shouting invec
tives, ran up to a group of
us and explained to us that
he wasn't protesting. He
stated that he merely want
ed to find out what the pro
test was about, assuming (I
believe) that protests were
supposed to have defined
purposes. He was sorrowful
ly disappointed.
It is my fervent hope that,
in the future, our discon

think before they act. If
they don't think, then they
have reason to fear the
draft test, although they
may choose not to take it.

Responsible?

To the Editor:
When will the so-called
"responsible adult popula
lation" stop making an issue
out of long hair, beards, san
dals and other standard
non-conformist attire?
To sling the term "beat
nik" or "Vietnik" at anyone
who does not conform to the

well-scrubbed norm is but to
label, and to label is to some
people synonomous with
possession. Once the rubric
applied, the name - caller
can relax: he has neatly
paced another human being
into one of his tight little
categories.
Those who label him
"beatnik" are, on the other
hand, content to stop at the
superficial level of appear
ance: the word obviates the
discomforting process of
facing he real issues that lie
behind mere physical de
meanor. The "beatnik's"
beard and long hair make
him necessarily immoral.
Fine, but the person who
confuses superficial ques
tions such as dress with the
grave issues which confront
the U.S. has prevented the
basis for dialogue. He has
further forced the non-con
formist into what was al
ready a desperate position.
Physical appearance is at
best a matter of fashion and
should be recognized as
such. It retains no necessary
link with morality, any more
than do the "Mothers for a
Moral America" whose film

To the Editor:
Now that all the other
alumni have been heard
from, may I weigh in with
my own paean of praise to
the architect of victory in
the Battle of Morrison's
locks?
First off, and four
square, I yield to no one,
man or boy, honored alum
nus or callow undergrad,
bald or beattle-cut, in my
admiration of the gratitude
for this well-Taylored, this
Sterling display of adminis
trative grace. I am wont to
suggest that henceforth, as
lovingly our thoughts trend
back to the true alma mater,
we think of it not as The
Farm, but as Peyton's Place.
It is comforting to know
that nestled at the foot of
the foothills we call our own,
resides a public relations
genius hitherto uni/evealed
— but evermore poised to
the occasion.
Only one thing bugs me:
What if a future generation
ever names as its student
leader a Stan ford-enrollee
who also delights in the un
conventional, whose hirsute
ways are strange?
Won't we hear from the'
old administration then!
And the old grad! And
won't the old scissors snip
and the old comments rip in
Peyton's Place! Zap! Zowie!

Responsible?

To the Editor:
When will the so-called
"responsible adult popula
lation" stop making an issue
out of long hair, beards, san
dals and other standard
non-conformist attire?
To sling the term "beat
nik" or "Vietnik" at anyone
who does not conform to the

well-scrubbed norm is but to
label, and to label is to some
people synonomous with
possession. Once the rubric
applied, the name - caller
can relax: he has neatly
paced another human being
into one of his tight little
categories.
Those who label him
"beatnik" are, on the other
hand, content to stop at the
superficial level of appear
ance: the word obviates the
discomforting process of
facing he real issues that lie
behind mere physical de
meanor. The "beatnik's"
beard and long hair make
him necessarily immoral.
Fine, but the person who
confuses superficial ques
tions such as dress with the
grave issues which confront
the U.S. has prevented the
basis for dialogue. He has
further forced the non-con
formist into what was al
ready a desperate position.
Physical appearance is at
best a matter of fashion and
should be recognized as
such. It retains no necessary
link with morality, any more
than do the "Mothers for a
Moral America" whose film
about pornography was ban
ned by Barry Goldwater, or
jthe American Nazi Party
[with their crewcuts and
well-polished SS boots.
Christ, after all, was the
archetypal "beatnik," and
no one in those times even
bugged him about the way
he looked So wake up "re
sponsible ones" to the fact
that appearance is a matter
of individual taste aaid by
no means permits you to
look the other way when the
true issues of morality arise.

PROTEST?

To the Editor:
"Say kids let's have a pro
test. We don't really know
what we're protesting, but I
don't like tests. Tests are an
insult to my intelligence.
Anyway, can caucus af
ter the protest and dream
up some goals. Maybe we
should have protested last
month so that we could de
termine our goals and stop
the test before it starts.
Well, a protest, no matter
how untimely and undefin
ed, is better than no protest
at all."
These thoughts seem to be
the central issues surround
ing the recent draft protest.
However, one of the aims of
this University and most
others is to make men out
of irrational children. I view
the recent protest as an or
ganized temper tantrum. It
is one thing to think out
your views and go through

the channels organized to
administer policy to voice
dissent, and it is another to
create a civil disobedience
for the sake of having your
childishness recognized by
your peers.
These facts become very
apparent to the Men of ATO
when one of the showered
protestors, shouting invec
tives, ran up to a group of
us and explained to us that
he wasn't protesting. He
stated that he merely want
ed to find out what the pro
test was about, assuming (I
believe) that protests were
supposed to have defined
purposes. He was sorrowful
ly disappointed.
It is my fervent hope that,
in the future, our discon
tented fellow students will
think before they act. If
they don't think, then they
have reason to fear the
draft test, although they
may choose not to take it.
