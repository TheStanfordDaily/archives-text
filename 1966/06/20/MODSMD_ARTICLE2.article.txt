# Date Experiment At Pavilion
## 
### 
For the second consecu
tive summer quarter, Stan
ford will have computer
dating.
Last year "Stanford
Match" matched 350 people
for dates. This year The
Stanford Computer Date
Experiment hopes to bring
together 450 students, facul
ty, and staff members.
The experiment is being
run by Ronald Starr and
Donald Bamber, graduate
students in the psychology
department.
According to Starr, "We
hope to take the "blind" out
of blind dating."
"Last summer's Stanford
Match had some bugs in it
which we hope to eliminate,"
Starr continued. "A girl I
know was matched with 73
boys. She actually went out
with 32, while her room
mates sat around green with
envy. We will limit the num
ber of matches to 10, after
all, the participants have to
study sometime, don't
they?"
The Computer Date Ex
periment will have a booth
at the pavilion today. The
cost is $1.99 for males and
$1.75 for females. Neither
Starr nor Bamber will make
any profit from the venture.
There have been several
other nationwide computer
dating operations in the last
year, the most famous of
which was Operation Match
run by Harvard students.
Last summer ,the men
were sent postcards with the
names of three girls who
were their "perfect dates."
The girls were also sent
three "perfect dates." In a
few rare instances the
names were the same in
both cases.
Starr and Bamber hope to
correct this by sending 4 to
10 names to the men. They
will also mail the names of
the men to women so they
will know who they are
matched with.
Some faculty and staif

members — mainly secre
taries — have already sign
ed up for the match.
The promoters of the
Computer Date Experiment
promise to have the names
of the dates sent out within
one week. They have a con
tract with a computer pro
grammer to start running
the match tomorrow.
Starr told The Weekly,
"People seem enthusiastic
about the project — more
so than about most psychol
ogy experiments. But since
it is an experiment we are
n't guaranteeing any wed
dings."
Donald Bamber, the other
graduate student involved
in the project, commented,
"I can't think of a better ex
cuse to call up a girl."


Graduates file into Frost Amphitheatre to take their seats for the 75th annual commence

know was matched with 73
boys. She actually went out
with 32, while her room
mates sat around green with
envy. We will limit the num
ber of matches to 10, after
all, the participants have to
study sometime, don't
they?"
The Computer Date Ex
periment will have a booth
at the pavilion today. The
cost is $1.99 for males and
$1.75 for females. Neither
Starr nor Bamber will make
any profit from the venture.
There have been several
other nationwide computer
dating operations in the last
year, the most famous of
which was Operation Match
run by Harvard students.
Last summer ,the men
were sent postcards with the
names of three girls who
were their "perfect dates."
The girls were also sent
three "perfect dates." In a
few rare instances the
names were the same in
both cases.
Starr and Bamber hope to
correct this by sending 4 to
10 names to the men. They
will also mail the names of
the men to women so they
will know who they are
matched with.
Some faculty and staif

members — mainly secre
taries — have already sign
ed up for the match.
The promoters of the
Computer Date Experiment
promise to have the names
of the dates sent out within
one week. They have a con
tract with a computer pro
grammer to start running
the match tomorrow.
Starr told The Weekly,
"People seem enthusiastic
about the project — more
so than about most psychol
ogy experiments. But since
it is an experiment we are
n't guaranteeing any wed
dings."
Donald Bamber, the other
graduate student involved
in the project, commented,
"I can't think of a better ex
cuse to call up a girl."


Graduates file into Frost Amphitheatre to take their seats for the 75th annual commence
ment ceremonies.
For the second consecu
tive summer quarter, Stan
ford will have computer
dating.
Last year "Stanford
Match" matched 350 people
for dates. This year The
Stanford Computer Date
Experiment hopes to bring
together 450 students, facul
ty, and staff members.
The experiment is being
run by Ronald Starr and
Donald Bamber, graduate
students in the psychology
department.
According to Starr, "We
hope to take the "blind" out
of blind dating."
"Last summer's Stanford
Match had some bugs in it
which we hope to eliminate,"
Starr continued. "A girl I
know was matched with 73
boys. She actually went out
with 32, while her room
mates sat around green with
