# Alumni gather to think, drink

Alumni reunions are not a
new thing at Stanford.
But they are being held in
a new way this year.
The classes of 1921, '26, '31,
'36 ami '41 met last week on
campus in a much different
setting than their previous
reunions. The setting was
the Stanford campus.
Each class holds a reunion
at five year intervals. Up
until now, the reunion was
held in San Francisco dur
ing the weekend of the
Stanford - Berkeley football
game.. Usually the reunion
amounted to no more than
a gocd cocktail party and a
football game. Meaningful
contact was limited. The
alums had little opportunity
to meet the students or fac
ulty.
The 1966 Stanford Class
Reunion Program brought
together approximately 700
alumni for a thrc2 day
schedule of lectures, panel
discussions, and, of course,
cocktail parties.
Most alums agreed that
they would rather partici
pate in a program of this
type. Bob Love, class of '11,
who came to the reunion
from Green River, Wyom
ing, commented, "This is a
good idea, but more people
would have participated if it
had been held at Big Game
time."
Participants chccked into
Wilbur Hall on Friday after
noon and the first round of
the program started with
tours of the Quad and the
new linear accelerator.
Friday night saw a series
of barbeques for each of the
classes. For example, the
class of 1941 met at the
Woodside home of Paul
"Red" Fay, former underse
cretary of the Navy. This
meeting had the largest at
tendance. President Sterling
dropped in on the gathering
in the early evening, stop
ping long enough to speak
to several alumni indivdu
ally and also to give a short
talk to the entire group.
Sterling visited all five re
unions in the space of two
hours.

In 1961, the class of '36
held its reunion at the Men
lo Circus Club during the
Bg Game weekend. Virello
said that he thought the
University was to be prais
ed for attempting to have
reunions which were more
significant than Big Game
get-togethers.
The Alpine Hills Country
Club was the scene of the
class of '21 reunion. Donald
Irving of San Francisco,
who worked on the Daily
Palo Alto (later The Stan
ford Daily) when he was at
Stanford, commented he
preferred a reunion without
the rush of the Big Game.
The Saturday morning
programs were the most
controversial among the old
grads. At 9:30, three differ
ent lectures were available.
Piofessor Jacdicke spoke on
"Decision Making and the
Businessman." Assistant
Professor of Religion Mi
chatl Novak lectured on
"Belief and Unbelief," and a
panel on student life fea
turing Judith Stiriing, Ken
nth Jernstcdt, and Frank
Morris was offered for the
children of the alumni.
Bill Boyd, '36, of Portland,
attended Novak's lecture. "It
was too analytical and did-

An eight member panel,
mc derated by Professor
James T. Watkins, discussed
"If I Were President Ster
ling," at 10:45. Student ac
tivism was the main topic.
The sit-in at President Ster
ling's office, sprinter Pat
Morrison's hair, and the
Stanford Sexual Rights For
um wcr; brought into the
discussion.
"Maybe there really is a
difference between the stu
dents of 1966 and the stu
dents of 1941," said Hob
Love, of the class of 1941.
"Certainly a small minority
of I lie student body is get
ting the most publicity, but
there are issues today that
didn't exist 25 years ago ."
John A. Houston, '36, said
that he had not formed an
opinion on the subject of stu
dent activism. "I live in
Galesburg, Illinois, and the
press doesn't play up the
West Coast stories."
Houston also told The
Weekly that he did not
know about the sit-ins until
he came to the reunion.
"However," he added. "If
the situation didn't exist
here, something, would be
wrong with Stanford."
