# Suffer, Little Frankensteins

### Perry Lee Birchard 
The world is a mess. Not,
that it hasn't always been
that way. People have been
saying for centuries that the
younger generation has gone
to pot and the world will
end very soon — or so adults
toll us in school.
Yet, peering across the in
terminable abyss that sep
arates Them and Us, youth
sees that the older gener
ation is deteriorating, and
unfortunately <at least for
Thtm) ,the world will be
with us for a very long time.
It isn't that we don't trust
anyone over thirty. Or that
we think that only the
young a,re virtuous, wise,
and good. our image of
adults Is easily derived by
looking at the ones we deal
with, watching their rt>ac
ions and listening to their
comments to us.
Take our Alumni, for ex
ample.
Or our supporters in Palo
Alto.
In the tumult and shout
ing that ensues when youth
expresses doubts, it becomes
obvious that the only tangi
ble result is the complica
tion of an already confused
adult world. On tbe one
hand, the adults are not
happy or secure with their
world. They feel it could be
better. And maybe some of
them even 1 cel guilty about
the present state of affairs.
On the other hand, when
adults are challenged by
youth, they feel forced to
defend a world that they do

not necessarily believe in.
This is all too vague, von
say. But what of Stanford's
Great Crises like the SSRF',
Dave Harris, and the SCI'V
demonstrations?
Implicit in the SSRF is the
idea that adults are hypo
critical and that some
younger people are tired
enough of the situation to
do something. It doesn't
mean, as some middle class
moralists would believe
that Stanford has an insti
tutionalized free love cult
that encourages innocent
young girls to be deflowered,
or that the members rape
and pillage Palo Alto every
night.
That our new "leftist"
president was easily elected
in Stanford's biggest voter
turnout does not moan that
307* of the student body is
Communist and 1000 homo
sexuals walk our campus
(despite the sex ratio). Har
ris' election was our state
ment that whether or not
he is more genuine and, less
fallible than others, the re
fresh ingnrs.s of a non-Es
tablishment viewpoint is de
sired and his presence in
that office is not a mere
fluke None of us can hon
estly expect Immediate or
far-reaching reforms as a
result of Harris' election. In
fact, we will not be surpris
ed if he goes sour.
My only reassurance to
the adults is that we have
not gone to hell any more
than they have. Nor are we
going to.

ed if he goes sour.
My only reassurance to
the adults is that we have
not gone to hell any more
than they have. Nor are we
going to.
The world is a mess. Not,
that it hasn't always been
that way. People have been
saying for centuries that the
younger generation has gone
to pot and the world will
end very soon — or so adults
toll us in school.
Yet, peering across the in
terminable abyss that sep
arates Them and Us, youth
sees that the older gener
ation is deteriorating, and
unfortunately <at least for
Thtm) ,the world will be
with us for a very long time.
It isn't that we don't trust
anyone over thirty. Or that
we think that only the
young a,re virtuous, wise,
and good. our image of
adults Is easily derived by
looking at the ones we deal
with, watching their rt>ac
ions and listening to their
comments to us.
Take our Alumni, for ex
ample.
Or our supporters in Palo
Alto.
In the tumult and shout
ing that ensues when youth
expresses doubts, it becomes
obvious that the only tangi
ble result is the complica
tion of an already confused
adult world. On tbe one
hand, the adults are not
happy or secure with their
world. They feel it could be
better. And maybe some of
them even 1 cel guilty about
the present state of affairs.
On the other hand, when
adults are challenged by
youth, they feel forced to
defend a world that they do

not necessarily believe in.
This is all too vague, von
say. But what of Stanford's
Great Crises like the SSRF',
Dave Harris, and the SCI'V
demonstrations?
Implicit in the SSRF is the
idea that adults are hypo
critical and that some
younger people are tired
enough of the situation to
do something. It doesn't
mean, as some middle class
moralists would believe
that Stanford has an insti
tutionalized free love cult
that encourages innocent
young girls to be deflowered,
or that the members rape
and pillage Palo Alto every
night.
That our new "leftist"
president was easily elected
in Stanford's biggest voter
turnout does not moan that
307* of the student body is
Communist and 1000 homo
sexuals walk our campus
(despite the sex ratio). Har
ris' election was our state
ment that whether or not
he is more genuine and, less
fallible than others, the re
fresh ingnrs.s of a non-Es
tablishment viewpoint is de
sired and his presence in
that office is not a mere
fluke None of us can hon
estly expect Immediate or
far-reaching reforms as a
result of Harris' election. In
fact, we will not be surpris
ed if he goes sour.
