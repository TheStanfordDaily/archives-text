## 
### 
President Wallace Ster
ling awarded 3651 degrees at
the 75th annual commence
ment exercises in Frost am
phitheater Sunday, June 12.
The graduating class was
the largest in Stanford his
tory. Of the total, 1483 re
ceived - bachelor of arts or
science degrees, and 2168
were awarded advanced de
grees.
Featured speaker Dr. Mon
roe E. Spaght, managing di
rector of Royal Dutch Shell
International, warned the
graduates that today's stu
dent rebels are facing their
moment of truth at this
year's commencement exer
cises.
"They must realize that
they are passing from critic
to actor," Spaght continued.
Spaght, whose son is a
Stanford student, said, "We
all applaud and encourage
the privilege of free inquiry
and are not too shattered by
seeing it take novel forms in
college years."
"W hi 1 e the revolution
seems simple at 20, there is
a day when one learns that
it may be better to live with
a durable non - aggression
pact, hopefully involving no
major sacrifices of princi
ple."
Educated through the doc
torate in chemstry at Stan
ford, and a former member
of the University's board of
trustees, Dr. Spaght remind
ed the graduates that they
face a world full of awesome
responsibilities and sober
ing problems: the popula
tion explosion, food for the
hungry, military aid, and
"the rudiments of capabili
ty" — and that most of the
world's countries look to the

United States for that help.
President Sterling's ad
dress centered on the con
flict between those under
and over 30.
"There is concern about
the stability of the national
economy, about the un
checked rise in the rate of
crime and juvenile delin
quency, about the civil
right movement, and, not
least of all, about Vietnam,"
he said.
"In a society which is on
edge, the appeal to emotion
is apt to be stronger than
the appeal to reason, and
the easy luxury of sweeping
generalization is more invit
ing than the rigors of rea
soned analysis and evalua
tion."
Sterling noted that "some
of your generation have
seen fit to indict your elders
with uncommon sharpness
— illustrated by the slogan
that no one over 30 can be
trusted.
"Your elders are reacting
to this, their questions about
you are increasing in num
ber and in acuteness. Just
as the sharp critics among
your generation have tend
ed to lump everyone over 30
into one inflexible, unwise
and somewhat stuffy mass,
so now the critics among
your elders are tempted to
lump all of you into a group
of insurgents who would ra
ther repair to the barricades
than repair a poor grade.
"I have interest in and
applause for the fine work
performed by most of to
day's students: work in the
classroom, volunteer work in
aid of the handicapped and
underprivileged.
