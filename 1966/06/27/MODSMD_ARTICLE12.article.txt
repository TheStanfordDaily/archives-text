# Argument for the Absurd
## 
### Perry Lee Birchard 
One of the present arguments
being used against the draft
is that it discriminates against
the socio-economicilly I*.
prived. Proposed solutions to
this "problem" include having
a universal draft of all 18
year-olds and submit; i.ig draft
age men to selection by lottery.
Imagine for a moment an
army that is nearly half males
and half females.
It would eliminate--in places
like Vietnamâ€”the need for
army to support local brothels.
But that would end an ideal
method of foreign aid.
The armed service would be
come our society's courtship
and marriage service.
But that would mean in
creased expenditures by the
army for more doctors -- par
ticularly gynecologists -- and
marriage counselors.
On the other hand, that means

increase;! employment, at least
for some people. And that keeps
our economy moving.
A co-ed army would also be
a boon to the younger gener
ation because it would help
destroy the anachronistic val
ues which interfere with male
female relationships. It might
even develop into a post-pu
berty ceremony.
But what of THAT monthly
problem? Especially, say, in
the jungles of Vietnam?
The army could probably get
every girl on the same schocl lie
using birth control pills (nec
essary to a co-ed army any
way).
On the other hand, a selective
draft biased against the poor
is essential to our extant socio
politico-economic system.
Let's face it. That system
is un-equalitarian no matter
what words we mouth to the
contrary.
Our economy is based upon
induced consumption by the

public and waste of economic
surplus and natural resources
by the government. Our space
and military programs are ex
amples of the latter.
Essential to consumption is
the ability to purchase --which
the lower class hasn't got. In
creasingly, these people and
others will be automated out
of their potential jobs. Their
only source of money then is de
pendent wealth.
But that is bad for our econ
omy.
Certainly, it is advantageous
for the government to support
these non-consumers by em
ploying them in the army.
