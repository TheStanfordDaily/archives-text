# New Co-ed Dorms Built By Fall '68
## 
### 
Two new student residences,
described by qualified obser
vers as "the finest collegiate
undergraduate housing west of
the Mississippi," will be con
structed on the campus starting
in May, 1967.
The residences, designed to
carry the teaching program to
the students, will be coedu
cational for the first time in
Stanford history,. They will
house 560 students.
Men and wome.i will occupy
different wings and sections,
share jjimnjn dining, lounges,
and seminal 1 rooms, and jointly
attend a good many of their
classes in the living units.
The buildings, called
"houses" as a general term,
will actually consist of four
sub-units of 70 students each:
two for men, two for women.
The buildings will be named for
the major donors, Robert s.
Moore and David and Margaret
Jacks. Each complex will house
280 students.
Jacks House, fronting on
Campus Drive and Lasuen St.,
will total 113,000 square feet
gross. It will adjoin Florence
Moore Hall.
Two older fraternity houses,
Delta Kappa Epsilon and Phi
Gamma Delta, which front on
Lasuen St., will be removed
to make way for Jacks House.
They will be relocated on Cam
pus Drive near the Cowell Stu

dent Health Center in a faturej
third cluster of fraternities.
Moore House, totaling 90,000
square feet gross, will front on
Mny'ield Ave. at the foot of The
Knoll. It will be separated from
Jacks House by a group of four
existing fraternities.
Estimated cost of the two new
houses will be more than $7
million, including furnishings,
utilities, and landscaping. They
are expected to be ready for
occupancy by fall quarter, 1968.
Of the total, $1,190,000 comos
from the PACE Program, and
$2,280,000 in a loan from the
U. S. Housing and Home Finance
Agency, which will be repaid
from rentals.
The idea behind the Jacks
complex, according to Univer
sity planning officials is a con
temporary rendering of a med
ieval village street. Stairways
will be semi-enclosed, with
open landings, to provide ver
tical circulation.
At the we.\::ern end of thej
Jacks complex will be a sep
arate building with a large
dining room or commons and an
administration building for the
director and his staff, as well
as a faculty master's home.
The men's and women's units
will fa:s i'acii other across the
wide pedistrian mall. Tradit
ional Stanford design details--
arches of varying heights, tile
roofs and buff exterior walis--
will be carried out.


Registration day is also moving day and 350 virtuous
young maidens checked into Lagunita last week. Lagunita
will sponsor an all-campus dance Friday night at 8 PM.
