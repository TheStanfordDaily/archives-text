# Upward Bound Brings Poverty War Here
## 
### 
The distance between Stan
ford and East Palo Alto is
only three miles as the middle
class flies.
The road is much longer
if you have to fight de facto
segregation, a poor education,
and the stratification system
on the way.
But the Office of Economic
Opportunity (OEO), also known
as the War on Poverty, is
making the way easier this
summer with project Upward
Bound.
Now in its second year na
tionally, Upward Bound, is
attempting to bring high school
sophomores and juniors to a
higher academic level.
Forty-one high school stu
dents from East Palo Alto and
Menlo Park will spend eight
weeks here this summer. The
girls will live at the phi Delt
house; the boys will live at the
SAE house.

The program will operate
on a $57,000 budget, financed
by the OEO with the cooper
ation of the University.
Led by Professor Lawrence
Ryan, of the English Depart
ment, the project will have 21
staffers. Stanford graduate stu
dents, San Mateo College stu
dents, and public school tea
chers are included in the total.
Academic work in reading,
mathematics, English, and the
social sciences will be offered
in the mornings. Students will
participate in a diversified cul
tural program at other times
during the day. Optional courses
in drama and the fine arts
will be offered.
This year 202 universities
and colleges will sponsor Up
ward Bound. According to Sar
gent Shriver, director of the
OEO, "I think of this program
as one of the most promising
ways of taking people out. of
povertyâ€”and it is a complete
ly American way of doing it--
by giving young people a chance
to help themselves through ed
ucation."
A booklet published by the
OEO states that the program
"seeks to rescue the young
ster whose brains and ability
may be lost to society, or worse
yet, be directed against society,
unless he can be motivated to
apply his talents and energies
constructively."
One of the Universities in
the program, ColumbiaUniver

sity, will accept only students
whose chances for college with
out Upward Bound are zero.
Other programs are geared to
those students who do superior
school work but will not be
able to hold their own in col
lege due to inadequate secon
dary schooling.
The project centers around
small groups designed to bring
the students into the discus
sions. Teachers try to spend
as much time as possible with
the students outside of class
room hours. Tutors are avail
able for everyone in every sub
ject.
According to Upward Bound
spokesmen, the eight weeks the
students spend at Stanford will
not be their only contact with
the program. The follow-up
program, in cooperation with
the Ravenswood Tutorial Pro
gram, will arrange weekly
meetings with these students
throughout the year.
Counseling will also be con
tinued. The academic program
will be supplemented by Sat
urday activities and occasional
nvening excursions.
"Our hope is to pick up the
student when his present pat
terns are building up imped
iments to higher education, help
him remove those impediments,
give him a real appetite for
learning, and perhaps most im
portant of all, a conviction that
he can secure the education he
wants," according to Upward
Bound spokesmen.


Two of the participants in project Upward Bound relax at the piano after classes. The
boys are living at the SAE house and the girls are at the Phi Delt house. Upward Bound
is sponsored by the War on Poverty.
