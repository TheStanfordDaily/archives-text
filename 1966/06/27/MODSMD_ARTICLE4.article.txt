# Bridge, But No Water
## 
### Judy Sklar 
lii the middle of a field in
the south corner of the campus
by Frenchman's Road, on per
fectly level ground, there stands
an old brick bridge.
It has several steps going up
on one side of it, several steps
going down on the other side
and an arch underneath as any
sensible bridge has. Only one
detail is missing; there is no
water anywhere in the vicinity,
and there is no sign that there
ever was any.
The bridge by Frenchman's
Road is now a gathering place
for art students, tourists, and
couples on study dates, but there
was a time when it was the
center of a sunken garden, com
plete with lake, islands, and
simulated ruins.
The garden was surrounded
by a six-foot stone wall, where
homes now stand. The water
for it was piped in from a
stream on the othpr siHo nt tho
hill. The entire lake was built
by "The Frenchman," afamous
character of Santa Clara County
in the 1870's. It was meant
to be a French landscape, de
signed to go with his chateau
to be built on the Foothill Road
hill.
The Frenchman arrived from
France in 1874 and established
a farm, a part of which is now
Stanford. He built an elaborate
irrigation system with six tun
nels cutting through a hill; he
began a library; and constructed
a lake. He registered all his
property under his governess's
name. This puzzled the people
on the peninsula, so this ex
planation arose.
It was rumored that the
Frenchman had been a pay
master in the French army at
the outbreak of the Franco-
Prussian War, when he suddenly
disappeared with a 500 million
franc payroll. He escaped to
the United States.
When he left here in 1880
for Europe, it was said that he
didn't leave—he was hiding out
from the French police in the
tunnels of his irrigation sys
tem.
