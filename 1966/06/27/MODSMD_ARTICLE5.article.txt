# Orange Co. Comments On Harris Election
## 
### Mike Couzens 
Just beyond the underbelly I 1
of Los Angeles, sheltered byj
the Santa Ana Mountains, lies!
a potpourri of Mugwumps, mo- j
ie stars and sunbathers unique,
even in Southern California cul
ture.
Orange County is an anomaly
from anyone's point of view.
Its southern extremity is a
beach, including Newport, Bal
boa and Laguna. At its northern|
extremity is Yorba Linda, the
birthplace (a billboard anndun
ces) of Richard M. Nixon.
In between are rapidly pro
liferating tract homes and a
few rows of the soon-to-be
extinct orange trees.
Other attractions are Disney
land, the Movieland Wax Mu
seum, and famous "Berry Farm
and Ghost Town." Gene Autry
recently brought his American
League team into the county.
But the amazing thing about
Orange County is not its op
portunities for leisure. Orange
County does not defy description
until one considers its politics, i
In the recent primary election
Gov. Edmund G. Brown re
putedly got three votes; from a
deceased couple and their Lab
rador retriever. Ronald Reagan
is chief minion for the whole
territory.
The county's patron saint is
Rep. James B. Utt, who ranks
435 th on anyone's scale of Con
gressmen (moving from left
to right).
A favori.e table topic in
Orange County recently is the
election of David Victor Harris
as Stanford Student Body Pres
ident. Discussion usually begins
with Beard! . . . SANDALS!!!",
and ends with speculation as to|
whether or rul David Harris is
a communist.
Guessing at how many Stan
ford alumni are among the dis
cussants is a sinister pastime at
best. It is clear, though, that
the response is pronounced and
reactionary. People in Orange
County are REACTING to Har-j
ris — as much to the AP wire-1
photo as to what they read.
A series of three articles
on Stanford appeared last week

in the Los Angeles Times. The
series, by William Trombley,
The Times' highly competent
education editor, ended with an
article on Harris (and his
photo).
Monday's Times carried a
column by Jack Smith, who usu
ally uses the space to des
cribe his son's experiences at
camp.
Under the headline, "How're
You Gonna Keep 'Em Down
on the Farm?" Smith called to
mind a 1940 movie, "The
Spirit of Stanford," starring
Frankie Albert. From the nar
rative at the beginning he
quotes:
"Stanford men always fight
hard and clean. When they leave
here, they all take with them
a certain spirit -- the spirit
of Stanford.
They become useful men in our
American way of life and
football is an integral part of
our American way of life."
Smith then muses at how
fine it would be if David Har
ris and Pat Morrison could
see the movie.
"If only these lads could have
a talk with Barnie Nevers,"
intones Smith. Surely the great
All-American fullback would
set them straight*
"Alter all, there's alot more
to Stanford than just protest."
Ah, yes, but the trick is to
communicate that to the world
outside.
