# Brucker: Significant Trend In Reporting
## 
### 
"Today's news isn't just the
gee-whizz event that happened
a moment ago. It is also the
significant fact or trend that is
revealed only when dug out by
informed professionals who can
write," Herbert Brucker, em
eritus editor of the Hartford
Courant, reminded tiie Califor
nia Editors Conference here
June 17.
Brucker, who directs Stan
ford's new graduate fellowship
program in communication, ad
dressed editors from all over
the state at a banquet marking
the mid-point of the 28th annual
two-day conference.
Quoting Bernard Kilgore of
the Wall Street Journal, Bruc
ker said, "The newspaper ed
itor of tomorrow will be an
egghead...the newspaper of the
future must become an instru
ment of educational leadership,
an institution of intellectual de
velopment --a center of lear
ning."
"What all this means to jour
nalism," Brucker continued,
"is that we are past the point
at which even the best liberal
arts educatiDn is inadequate
preparation for a career.
"At some point, those who
hope to succeed in newf work
will have to go back to school—
perhaps more than once —
to catch up with subjects and
values they missed the first
time around.
"Or else they must go so
that they can undersiind new
areas of knowledge developed
since they were students."
