# Inside S.U.F.D.

### Perry Lee Birchard 
The next time that you hear
the noon horn that echoes
across campus, remember that
it used to summon Stanford's
volunteer fire department. The
volunteers--all students
aided a staff of three firemen
in emergencies.
Today, Stanford has two fire
houses. Thirty-three regular
men and twelve students are
on its staff.
The newest fire station is at
SLAC. It employs 10 of the
regular men. At their disposal
are two engines. A third is on
order at the present time.
The fire station that most of
us are more familiar with is
located behind Tresidder. This
old wooden building, denoted
only by its red doors and SUFD,
houses the remainder of the
regular firemen and all of the
students. Their emergency
equipment includes 2 engines
(one which is used for pumping
and rescue work, the other being
used solely for pumping), one
aerial ladder truck that carries
an 85 foot long ladder, one
tanker, and one rescue truck.
Stanford's recently renovated
rescue truck is the only one of
its kind in the bay area. It
carries nearly every conceiv
able piece of rescue equipment
from axes to resuscitators.
Our fire department can also
boast of its mighty pumper
engines and the speed with which
they use them. When a pumper
arrives at a fire, it normally

takes two minutes for the fire
men to hook into a hydrant and
get the pumper into operation.
The Standord pumpers acti
vate in twenty seconds. While
one pumper is using the 500
gallons of water it carries to
put out the fire, feed lines
are connected to it from a hy
drant. At the same time, the
other engine can be put to
work.
For the brush fires that fre
quently occur in the Stanford
area, there is a 19 ton (when
loaded) renovated army truck
that holds 1000 gallons of water.

But most of us are familiar
with the fire department be
cuase it handles all emergency
calls and diverts appropriate
ones to the police department.
The firemen estimate that fifty
per cent of all calls that they
respond to are for first aid.
Usually they are construction
accidents, or what firemen

sometimes consider to be stu
dent stupidity.
It is a wonder, noted Lieu- 1
tenant Jerry Loscutoff, that we
don't have more accidents and
conflagerations, and more ser
ious ones on campus. This is
because of the old, dry houses
and the way people—particu
larly fraternity boys--keep
them in filth and squalor.
To be apprised of emergen-.
cies on campus and in the
surrounding areas, the depart
ment has an elaborate commun
ications system. In the
communications room proper
are monitors of the Palo Alto
Police and Fire, San Mateo
County Forestry and Sheriff,
Menlo, Woodside, and Santa
Clara County Fire Depart
ments, and the Highway Patrol.
Also, every fire box on cam
pus is tied into the system.
Whenever an alarm is pulled
(if it's false you might pay
$500 and spend six months in
jail), its number is registered
and punched out four times in
paper. The code corresponds:
to a particular box in a series
of boxes. These are easily lo
cated on the department's map
, of Stanford.
There have never been any
fatalaties among Stanford's
firefighters. They have had no
major firefighting accidents
(like overturning the 85 foot
, aerial ladder truck). But the
firemen view most lucky the
fact that they have never run
over an unwary student as they

rumble at a maximum of 35
m.p.h. through campus.
In some senses, the Stanford
fireman's life is restrictive.
Everyone—including the stu
dents—must live in the fire
house. And no women are
allowed upstairs. Besides, fire
men "work" 69.7 hours per
week, they also spend much
of their time off going to classes
in local junior colleges and
studying.
The SLAC facilities have four
men on assignment each day.
At the Campus firehouse, there
are usually 10 men and 6 stu
dents on duty.
Because of the fire depart
ment's quick work, there have
been few memorable fires on
campus.

Male subjects needed for psyc
experiment. $1.50 per half hr.
and opportunity to win more.

The Firehouse


Stanford's Communications Center in the Firehouse
The next time that you hear
the noon horn that echoes
across campus, remember that
it used to summon Stanford's
volunteer fire department. The
volunteers--all students
aided a staff of three firemen
in emergencies.
Today, Stanford has two fire
houses. Thirty-three regular
men and twelve students are
on its staff.
The newest fire station is at
SLAC. It employs 10 of the
regular men. At their disposal
are two engines. A third is on
order at the present time.
The fire station that most of
us are more familiar with is
located behind Tresidder. This
old wooden building, denoted
only by its red doors and SUFD,
houses the remainder of the
regular firemen and all of the
students. Their emergency
equipment includes 2 engines
(one which is used for pumping
and rescue work, the other being
used solely for pumping), one
aerial ladder truck that carries
an 85 foot long ladder, one
tanker, and one rescue truck.
Stanford's recently renovated
rescue truck is the only one of
its kind in the bay area. It
carries nearly every conceiv
able piece of rescue equipment
from axes to resuscitators.
Our fire department can also
boast of its mighty pumper
engines and the speed with which
they use them. When a pumper
arrives at a fire, it normally

takes two minutes for the fire
men to hook into a hydrant and
get the pumper into operation.
The Standord pumpers acti
vate in twenty seconds. While
one pumper is using the 500
gallons of water it carries to
put out the fire, feed lines
are connected to it from a hy
drant. At the same time, the
other engine can be put to
work.
For the brush fires that fre
quently occur in the Stanford
area, there is a 19 ton (when
loaded) renovated army truck
that holds 1000 gallons of water.

But most of us are familiar
with the fire department be
cuase it handles all emergency
calls and diverts appropriate
ones to the police department.
The firemen estimate that fifty
per cent of all calls that they
respond to are for first aid.
Usually they are construction
accidents, or what firemen

sometimes consider to be stu
dent stupidity.
It is a wonder, noted Lieu- 1
tenant Jerry Loscutoff, that we
don't have more accidents and
conflagerations, and more ser
ious ones on campus. This is
because of the old, dry houses
and the way people—particu
larly fraternity boys--keep
them in filth and squalor.
To be apprised of emergen-.
cies on campus and in the
surrounding areas, the depart
ment has an elaborate commun
ications system. In the
communications room proper
are monitors of the Palo Alto
Police and Fire, San Mateo
County Forestry and Sheriff,
Menlo, Woodside, and Santa
Clara County Fire Depart
ments, and the Highway Patrol.
Also, every fire box on cam
pus is tied into the system.
Whenever an alarm is pulled
(if it's false you might pay
$500 and spend six months in
jail), its number is registered
and punched out four times in
paper. The code corresponds:
to a particular box in a series
of boxes. These are easily lo
cated on the department's map
, of Stanford.
There have never been any
fatalaties among Stanford's
firefighters. They have had no
major firefighting accidents
(like overturning the 85 foot
, aerial ladder truck). But the
firemen view most lucky the
fact that they have never run
over an unwary student as they

rumble at a maximum of 35
m.p.h. through campus.
In some senses, the Stanford
fireman's life is restrictive.

$500 and spend six months in

There have never been any
fatalaties among Stanford's
firefighters. They have had no
major firefighting accidents
(like overturning the 85 foot

fact that they have never run
over an unwary student as they

rumble at a maximum of 35
m.p.h. through campus.

The SLAC facilities have four

The Firehouse


Stanford's Communications Center in the Firehouse
The next time that you hear
the noon horn that echoes
across campus, remember that
it used to summon Stanford's
volunteer fire department. The
volunteers--all students
aided a staff of three firemen
in emergencies.
Today, Stanford has two fire
houses. Thirty-three regular
men and twelve students are
on its staff.
The newest fire station is at
SLAC. It employs 10 of the
regular men. At their disposal
are two engines. A third is on
order at the present time.
The fire station that most of
us are more familiar with is
located behind Tresidder. This
old wooden building, denoted
only by its red doors and SUFD,
houses the remainder of the
regular firemen and all of the
students. Their emergency
equipment includes 2 engines
(one which is used for pumping
and rescue work, the other being
used solely for pumping), one
aerial ladder truck that carries
an 85 foot long ladder, one
tanker, and one rescue truck.
Stanford's recently renovated
rescue truck is the only one of
its kind in the bay area. It
carries nearly every conceiv
able piece of rescue equipment
from axes to resuscitators.
Our fire department can also
boast of its mighty pumper
engines and the speed with which
they use them. When a pumper
arrives at a fire, it normally

takes two minutes for the fire
men to hook into a hydrant and
get the pumper into operation.
The Standord pumpers acti
vate in twenty seconds. While
one pumper is using the 500
gallons of water it carries to
put out the fire, feed lines
are connected to it from a hy
drant. At the same time, the
other engine can be put to
work.
For the brush fires that fre
quently occur in the Stanford
area, there is a 19 ton (when
loaded) renovated army truck
that holds 1000 gallons of water.

But most of us are familiar
with the fire department be
cuase it handles all emergency
calls and diverts appropriate
ones to the police department.
The firemen estimate that fifty
per cent of all calls that they
respond to are for first aid.
Usually they are construction
accidents, or what firemen

sometimes consider to be stu
dent stupidity.
It is a wonder, noted Lieu- 1
tenant Jerry Loscutoff, that we
don't have more accidents and
conflagerations, and more ser
ious ones on campus. This is
because of the old, dry houses
and the way people—particu
larly fraternity boys--keep
them in filth and squalor.
To be apprised of emergen-.
cies on campus and in the
surrounding areas, the depart
ment has an elaborate commun
ications system. In the
communications room proper
are monitors of the Palo Alto
Police and Fire, San Mateo
County Forestry and Sheriff,
Menlo, Woodside, and Santa
Clara County Fire Depart
ments, and the Highway Patrol.
Also, every fire box on cam
pus is tied into the system.
Whenever an alarm is pulled
(if it's false you might pay
$500 and spend six months in
jail), its number is registered
and punched out four times in
paper. The code corresponds:
to a particular box in a series
of boxes. These are easily lo
