In the course of a summer we will receive many re
leases from the News and Publications office of the University.
None have been quite so disturbing as the one we got last
week. It announced a seminar to be held at the Graduate
School of Business on the seemingly harmless topic "the
teaching of economics."
According to the release, "Topics covered will include:
TV and films as communications media; programmed in
struction and teaching machines; programmed texts; classroom
experiments, computers; and the use of mathematics, ec
onometrics, and statistics."
This release has already been thrown away by leading
newspapers in all parts of the country. But deep in the
confines of the Storke Building there lurks an editor who
is still reading it with disgust and dismay.
The problem is that we used a "program" last summer
quarter in an economics 1 class.
And the same professor, Keith Lumsden, who taught
that course, is now leading this teaching seminar.
Last year, when Lumsden first presented the idea,
he met strenuous objection from the students. After all,
their grades depended on the experiment. If the program
did not work, then the students who had used it (one-third
of the class) would be, to use their terminology, "screwed."
Finally, Lumsden agreed to make allowances in the
grading for those students using the program.
So the problem was solved. Almost.
Apparently this was not an experiment with college
students to be used at the elementary school level. We
believe that these programs are intern ed for use at the
college level.
When Lumsden 'ntroduced the program last year he
said that one of the reasons it might be used in the future
would be to free professors from teaching basic courses.
That's right. They wouldn't have to do a thing to teach
economics 1, or sociology 1, or possibly, Problems of Good
and Evil. The textbooks would be programmed, the homework
would be programmed, the tests would be programmed,
and the students would know plenty of facts about economics
1.
And that's all that they would know.
The advantage is in the professor's favor. No longer
will he have to teach classes in an elementary subject that
bores him. He won't have to try to answer students' questions
some of which he can't answer.
He can lock himself in his office and do research that
will establish him in his field. He will be able to think without
interruption for weeks at a time.
And what about the students?
They can sit at home and converse with their teaching
machines.

leases from the News and Publications office of the University.
None have been quite so disturbing as the one we got last
week. It announced a seminar to be held at the Graduate
School of Business on the seemingly harmless topic "the
teaching of economics."
According to the release, "Topics covered will include:
TV and films as communications media; programmed in
struction and teaching machines; programmed texts; classroom
experiments, computers; and the use of mathematics, ec
onometrics, and statistics."
This release has already been thrown away by leading
newspapers in all parts of the country. But deep in the
confines of the Storke Building there lurks an editor who
is still reading it with disgust and dismay.
The problem is that we used a "program" last summer
quarter in an economics 1 class.
And the same professor, Keith Lumsden, who taught
that course, is now leading this teaching seminar.
Last year, when Lumsden first presented the idea,
he met strenuous objection from the students. After all,
their grades depended on the experiment. If the program
did not work, then the students who had used it (one-third
of the class) would be, to use their terminology, "screwed."
Finally, Lumsden agreed to make allowances in the
grading for those students using the program.
So the problem was solved. Almost.
Apparently this was not an experiment with college
students to be used at the elementary school level. We
believe that these programs are intern ed for use at the
college level.
When Lumsden 'ntroduced the program last year he
said that one of the reasons it might be used in the future
would be to free professors from teaching basic courses.
That's right. They wouldn't have to do a thing to teach
economics 1, or sociology 1, or possibly, Problems of Good
and Evil. The textbooks would be programmed, the homework
would be programmed, the tests would be programmed,
and the students would know plenty of facts about economics
1.
And that's all that they would know.
The advantage is in the professor's favor. No longer
will he have to teach classes in an elementary subject that
bores him. He won't have to try to answer students' questions
some of which he can't answer.
He can lock himself in his office and do research that
will establish him in his field. He will be able to think without
interruption for weeks at a time.
And what about the students?
They can sit at home and converse with their teaching
machines.
In the course of a summer we will receive many re
leases from the News and Publications office of the University.
