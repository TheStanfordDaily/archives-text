## Synanon Philosophy Anything Is Possible 
### Mike McDermott 
On the evening of Saturday,
June 25, some thirty Stanford
students met behind the cam
pus bookstore to make a trip,
arranged by the Ecumenical Co
ordinating Committee, whose
purpose was to attend the
weekly open house held by Syn
anon -- an organization dedi
cated to curing narcotics ad
dicts with no n - professional
means employed by non -pro
fessionals, themselves usually
former addicts.
Since there is considerable
cor*roversy associated with
this organization's practices,
all departed for San Francisco
with something less than the
blase indifference usually at
tributed to StanforditeS.
As we arrived on the top
floor of the renovated ware
house used by Synanon, two
things were readily apparent;
the austere cleanliness of the
area, and the well-mannered,
neat appearance of the members
(coats and ties for the men,
dresses and high heels for the
women), which rendered most
virtually indistinguishable from
the visiting doctors, lawyers,
and others gathered in the large
room.

Only occasionally was there
an individual whose personal
ity and facial expression ap
peared to be irreparably scar
red by his experience as an
addict. On the whole, it was dif
ficult to believe that those with

whom we shoke were other
than persons of conventional
experience. The regional dir
ector, Jack Hurst, is very per
sonable, highly articulate, and
a former addict. If one is
looking for stereotyped "ex
junkie," Synanon is the wrong
place.
The general meeting began
with a reading of the Synanon
Philosophy, which is an affir
mation that an individual, no
matter how undisciplined and
depraved, can live productively
if he wants to. All present
were then invited to comment
on a characteristically vague
quotation from Emerson;
"Everything good is the re
sult of antagonism."
The ostensible purpose of the
inconclusive exchange of plati
tudes said in response to this
gem of Emersonia was to en
courage visitors to feel at ease
by having some of their num
ber say a word or two; Synan
on members did most of the
talking, however.
Next, two "birthdays" (an
niversaries) were comemor
ated by having the celebrants
tell of their former lives as
addicts, contrasting these with
their far superior lot as re
sidents at Synanon House. The
meeting was concluded with an
invitation to remain for a sym
posium, during which questions
of visitors would be answered.
In the meantime, we were ush
ered into the art gallery, which

contains works by residents.
Virtually everything was im
itatively modern. Most of the
painting was a la Picasso,
while the sculpture was after
the manner of Giacometti. Ti
tles tended to suggest the art
ists' narcotic past: "Half and
Half, Other Self," etc.
As the symposium pro
gressed, Synanon's general
method became clear; an ad

required to stop using anything
that might impair his thinking
and judgement, such as al
cohol, chemicals, and, of
course, drugs.
It is an axiom of Synanon
belief that an addict is emotion
ally a child; otherwise, he would
not have sought refuge from
life in narcotics. He is given
no responsibility, and is as
signed the most menial of tasks.
As he gradually begins to act
and think as an adult, he is
given more meaningful tasks
to perform; in addition, he is
treated with more respect.
Throughout the three year
period in which the transition
is made, the ex-addict is re
quired to behave as an adult,
even if he has not fully at
tained that state--except, of
course, when he is participat
ing in the thrice-weekly Syn
anon Game.
This "game " is the core of
the Synanon method of rehab
ilitation. It consists of a group
meeting of eight to ten mem
bers who discuss each other's
character flaws, often with ex
cruciating frankness. The
meeting is usually noisy, but
it provides a catharsis—
a means of verbally releasing
agressions which, because they
were formerly given no outlet,
might have caused the quest
for sanctuary in drugs. Pain
fully, the new member is forced
by his fellows to come to a real
ization of what he is, and how
he may improve himself. The
emphasis, to use the official
term, is on "emotional edu
cation." It is not, strictly
speaking, group therapy.
It sounds a bit cruel, but the
Synanon Game and related
stringent discipline bring re
sults; public hospitals and pri
sons hope at best for a ten
percent permanent "cure" rate
while Synanon's actual average
tops fifty percent. This ap
proach toward amelioration of
addiction is successful pro
bably because it is administered
by former addicts; "a junkie
can't con an ex-junkie," a
resident told me. The Synanon
initiate is given no sympathy,
or gradually reduced regimen
of drugs, as he is in conven
tional institutions—he is told
how "stupid" he is for be
coming an addict, and that he
had better get his withdrawal
period concluded, so he can be
gin to be a human, possibly
for the first time in his life.
Controversial as the Synanon
Game remains, it is now em

ployed in various institutions
outside Synanon; there is an
active chapter in the Nevada
State Prison, for example.
The most strident criticism
levied against Synanon by its
detractors is the valid obser
vation that once a resident is
cured he tends to remain within
the organization, rather than
returning to life on the "out
side." In short, Synanon is seen
by some to be a crutch, a sub
stitute for dope. But all of us
employ crutches every day
eating, drinking, smoking, sex,
general hell-raising—to help us
escape life's oppressions. Per
haps the individuals in Synanon
are only partially "cur6d, and
perhaps they need a strong or
ganization to keep them from
becoming addicts again. Even if,
for the sake of argument, they
have traded subservience to the
needle for subservience to the
group, the members of Syn
anon have rejoined the human
race, and this is an advan
tageous trade.
In addition, Synanon is be
coming a "way of life, " in
itself; persons who have never
been addicts are joining this
communal society, simply be
cause they find it exciting, and
are inspired by its noble pur
pose, Synanon industries,
(operation of a chain of Tex
aco stations, distribution of
ball-point pens) shows promise
of becoming a large-scale bus
iness venture. The purpose of
these recent commercial ac
tivities is to make Synanon
"self-reliant." (Emerson is
used freely in the official
rationale.)
But Emerson spoke of the
self-reliance of the individual,
not the society. How does the
individual, as an individual, fare
in Synanon? Probably as well
as he wants to. It must be
remembered that all residents,
having been transformed into
worthwhile citizens during their
years in Synanon, develop a
strong loyalty to the organi
zation itself, and a feeling of
comaderie for their fellows.
There is thus a strong motive
to desire a fulfillment of the
organization's goals, which, in
this case, requires teamwork
and a minimum of dissent. A
singlemindedness of purpose
readily emerges as a common
goal; let us use this society
to help other addicts, thereby
aiding society as a whole, and
providing a sense of meaning
for ourselves, the Synanon
"graduates."

On the evening of Saturday,
June 25, some thirty Stanford
students met behind the cam
pus bookstore to make a trip,
arranged by the Ecumenical Co
ordinating Committee, whose
purpose was to attend the
weekly open house held by Syn
anon -- an organization dedi
cated to curing narcotics ad
dicts with no n - professional
means employed by non -pro
fessionals, themselves usually
former addicts.
Since there is considerable
cor*roversy associated with
this organization's practices,
all departed for San Francisco
with something less than the
blase indifference usually at
tributed to StanforditeS.
As we arrived on the top
floor of the renovated ware
house used by Synanon, two
things were readily apparent;
the austere cleanliness of the
area, and the well-mannered,
neat appearance of the members
(coats and ties for the men,
dresses and high heels for the
women), which rendered most
virtually indistinguishable from
the visiting doctors, lawyers,
and others gathered in the large
room.

Only occasionally was there
an individual whose personal
ity and facial expression ap
peared to be irreparably scar
red by his experience as an
addict. On the whole, it was dif
ficult to believe that those with

whom we shoke were other
than persons of conventional
experience. The regional dir
ector, Jack Hurst, is very per
sonable, highly articulate, and
a former addict. If one is
looking for stereotyped "ex
junkie," Synanon is the wrong
place.
The general meeting began
with a reading of the Synanon
Philosophy, which is an affir
mation that an individual, no
matter how undisciplined and
depraved, can live productively
if he wants to. All present
were then invited to comment
on a characteristically vague
quotation from Emerson;
"Everything good is the re
sult of antagonism."
The ostensible purpose of the
inconclusive exchange of plati
tudes said in response to this
gem of Emersonia was to en
courage visitors to feel at ease
by having some of their num
ber say a word or two; Synan
on members did most of the
talking, however.
Next, two "birthdays" (an
niversaries) were comemor
ated by having the celebrants
tell of their former lives as
addicts, contrasting these with
their far superior lot as re
sidents at Synanon House. The
meeting was concluded with an
invitation to remain for a sym
posium, during which questions
of visitors would be answered.
In the meantime, we were ush
ered into the art gallery, which

contains works by residents.
Virtually everything was im
itatively modern. Most of the
painting was a la Picasso,
while the sculpture was after
the manner of Giacometti. Ti
tles tended to suggest the art
ists' narcotic past: "Half and
Half, Other Self," etc.
As the symposium pro
gressed, Synanon's general
method became clear; an ad

required to stop using anything
that might impair his thinking
and judgement, such as al
cohol, chemicals, and, of
course, drugs.
It is an axiom of Synanon
belief that an addict is emotion
ally a child; otherwise, he would
not have sought refuge from
life in narcotics. He is given
no responsibility, and is as
signed the most menial of tasks.
As he gradually begins to act
and think as an adult, he is
given more meaningful tasks
to perform; in addition, he is
treated with more respect.
Throughout the three year
period in which the transition
is made, the ex-addict is re
quired to behave as an adult,
even if he has not fully at
tained that state--except, of
course, when he is participat
ing in the thrice-weekly Syn
anon Game.
This "game " is the core of
the Synanon method of rehab
ilitation. It consists of a group
meeting of eight to ten mem
bers who discuss each other's
character flaws, often with ex
cruciating frankness. The
meeting is usually noisy, but
it provides a catharsis—
a means of verbally releasing
agressions which, because they
were formerly given no outlet,
might have caused the quest
for sanctuary in drugs. Pain
fully, the new member is forced
by his fellows to come to a real
ization of what he is, and how
he may improve himself. The
emphasis, to use the official
term, is on "emotional edu
cation." It is not, strictly
speaking, group therapy.
It sounds a bit cruel, but the
Synanon Game and related
stringent discipline bring re
sults; public hospitals and pri
sons hope at best for a ten
percent permanent "cure" rate
while Synanon's actual average
tops fifty percent. This ap
proach toward amelioration of
addiction is successful pro
bably because it is administered
by former addicts; "a junkie
can't con an ex-junkie," a
resident told me. The Synanon
initiate is given no sympathy,
or gradually reduced regimen
of drugs, as he is in conven
tional institutions—he is told
how "stupid" he is for be
coming an addict, and that he
had better get his withdrawal
period concluded, so he can be
gin to be a human, possibly
for the first time in his life.
Controversial as the Synanon
Game remains, it is now em

ployed in various institutions
outside Synanon; there is an
active chapter in the Nevada
State Prison, for example.
The most strident criticism
levied against Synanon by its
detractors is the valid obser
vation that once a resident is
cured he tends to remain within
the organization, rather than
returning to life on the "out
side." In short, Synanon is seen
by some to be a crutch, a sub
stitute for dope. But all of us
employ crutches every day
eating, drinking, smoking, sex,
general hell-raising—to help us
escape life's oppressions. Per
haps the individuals in Synanon
are only partially "cur6d, and
perhaps they need a strong or
ganization to keep them from
becoming addicts again. Even if,
for the sake of argument, they
have traded subservience to the
needle for subservience to the
group, the members of Syn
anon have rejoined the human
race, and this is an advan
tageous trade.
In addition, Synanon is be
coming a "way of life, " in
itself; persons who have never
been addicts are joining this
communal society, simply be
cause they find it exciting, and
are inspired by its noble pur
pose, Synanon industries,
(operation of a chain of Tex
aco stations, distribution of
ball-point pens) shows promise
of becoming a large-scale bus
iness venture. The purpose of
these recent commercial ac
tivities is to make Synanon
"self-reliant." (Emerson is
used freely in the official
rationale.)
But Emerson spoke of the
self-reliance of the individual,
not the society. How does the
individual, as an individual, fare
in Synanon? Probably as well
as he wants to. It must be
remembered that all residents,
having been transformed into
worthwhile citizens during their
years in Synanon, develop a
strong loyalty to the organi
zation itself, and a feeling of
comaderie for their fellows.
There is thus a strong motive
to desire a fulfillment of the
organization's goals, which, in
this case, requires teamwork
and a minimum of dissent. A
singlemindedness of purpose
readily emerges as a common
goal; let us use this society
to help other addicts, thereby
aiding society as a whole, and

On the evening of Saturday,
June 25, some thirty Stanford
students met behind the cam
pus bookstore to make a trip,
arranged by the Ecumenical Co
ordinating Committee, whose
purpose was to attend the
weekly open house held by Syn
anon -- an organization dedi
cated to curing narcotics ad
dicts with no n - professional
means employed by non -pro
fessionals, themselves usually
former addicts.
Since there is considerable
cor*roversy associated with
this organization's practices,
all departed for San Francisco
with something less than the
blase indifference usually at
tributed to StanforditeS.
As we arrived on the top
floor of the renovated ware
house used by Synanon, two
things were readily apparent;
the austere cleanliness of the
area, and the well-mannered,
neat appearance of the members
(coats and ties for the men,
dresses and high heels for the
women), which rendered most
virtually indistinguishable from
the visiting doctors, lawyers,
and others gathered in the large
room.

Only occasionally was there
an individual whose personal
ity and facial expression ap
peared to be irreparably scar
red by his experience as an
addict. On the whole, it was dif
ficult to believe that those with

whom we shoke were other
than persons of conventional
experience. The regional dir
ector, Jack Hurst, is very per
sonable, highly articulate, and
a former addict. If one is
looking for stereotyped "ex
junkie," Synanon is the wrong
place.
The general meeting began
with a reading of the Synanon
Philosophy, which is an affir
mation that an individual, no
matter how undisciplined and
depraved, can live productively
if he wants to. All present
were then invited to comment
on a characteristically vague
quotation from Emerson;
"Everything good is the re
sult of antagonism."
The ostensible purpose of the
inconclusive exchange of plati
tudes said in response to this
gem of Emersonia was to en
courage visitors to feel at ease
by having some of their num
ber say a word or two; Synan
on members did most of the
talking, however.
Next, two "birthdays" (an
niversaries) were comemor
ated by having the celebrants
tell of their former lives as
addicts, contrasting these with
their far superior lot as re
sidents at Synanon House. The
meeting was concluded with an
invitation to remain for a sym
posium, during which questions
of visitors would be answered.
In the meantime, we were ush
ered into the art gallery, which

contains works by residents.
Virtually everything was im
itatively modern. Most of the
painting was a la Picasso,
while the sculpture was after
the manner of Giacometti. Ti
tles tended to suggest the art
ists' narcotic past: "Half and
Half, Other Self," etc.
As the symposium pro
gressed, Synanon's general
method became clear; an ad

required to stop using anything
that might impair his thinking
and judgement, such as al
cohol, chemicals, and, of
course, drugs.
It is an axiom of Synanon
belief that an addict is emotion
ally a child; otherwise, he would
not have sought refuge from
life in narcotics. He is given
no responsibility, and is as
signed the most menial of tasks.
As he gradually begins to act
and think as an adult, he is
given more meaningful tasks
to perform; in addition, he is
treated with more respect.
Throughout the three year
period in which the transition
is made, the ex-addict is re
quired to behave as an adult,
even if he has not fully at
tained that state--except, of
course, when he is participat
ing in the thrice-weekly Syn
anon Game.
This "game " is the core of
the Synanon method of rehab
ilitation. It consists of a group
meeting of eight to ten mem
bers who discuss each other's
character flaws, often with ex
cruciating frankness. The
meeting is usually noisy, but
it provides a catharsis—
a means of verbally releasing
agressions which, because they
were formerly given no outlet,
might have caused the quest
for sanctuary in drugs. Pain
fully, the new member is forced
by his fellows to come to a real
ization of what he is, and how
he may improve himself. The
emphasis, to use the official
term, is on "emotional edu
cation." It is not, strictly
speaking, group therapy.
It sounds a bit cruel, but the
Synanon Game and related
stringent discipline bring re
sults; public hospitals and pri
sons hope at best for a ten
percent permanent "cure" rate
while Synanon's actual average
tops fifty percent. This ap
proach toward amelioration of
addiction is successful pro
bably because it is administered
by former addicts; "a junkie
can't con an ex-junkie," a
resident told me. The Synanon
initiate is given no sympathy,
or gradually reduced regimen
of drugs, as he is in conven
tional institutions—he is told
how "stupid" he is for be
coming an addict, and that he
had better get his withdrawal
period concluded, so he can be
gin to be a human, possibly
for the first time in his life.
Controversial as the Synanon
Game remains, it is now em

ployed in various institutions
outside Synanon; there is an
active chapter in the Nevada
State Prison, for example.
The most strident criticism
levied against Synanon by its
detractors is the valid obser
vation that once a resident is
cured he tends to remain within
the organization, rather than
returning to life on the "out
side." In short, Synanon is seen
by some to be a crutch, a sub
stitute for dope. But all of us
employ crutches every day
eating, drinking, smoking, sex,
general hell-raising—to help us
escape life's oppressions. Per
haps the individuals in Synanon
are only partially "cur6d, and
perhaps they need a strong or
ganization to keep them from
becoming addicts again. Even if,
for the sake of argument, they
have traded subservience to the
needle for subservience to the
group, the members of Syn
anon have rejoined the human
race, and this is an advan
tageous trade.
In addition, Synanon is be
coming a "way of life, " in
itself; persons who have never
been addicts are joining this
communal society, simply be
cause they find it exciting, and
are inspired by its noble pur
pose, Synanon industries,
(operation of a chain of Tex
aco stations, distribution of
ball-point pens) shows promise
of becoming a large-scale bus
iness venture. The purpose of
these recent commercial ac
tivities is to make Synanon
"self-reliant." (Emerson is
used freely in the official
rationale.)
But Emerson spoke of the
self-reliance of the individual,
not the society. How does the
individual, as an individual, fare
in Synanon? Probably as well
as he wants to. It must be
remembered that all residents,
having been transformed into
worthwhile citizens during their
years in Synanon, develop a
strong loyalty to the organi
zation itself, and a feeling of
comaderie for their fellows.
There is thus a strong motive
to desire a fulfillment of the

On the evening of Saturday,
June 25, some thirty Stanford
students met behind the cam
pus bookstore to make a trip,
arranged by the Ecumenical Co
ordinating Committee, whose
purpose was to attend the
weekly open house held by Syn
anon -- an organization dedi
cated to curing narcotics ad
dicts with no n - professional
means employed by non -pro
fessionals, themselves usually
former addicts.
Since there is considerable
cor*roversy associated with
this organization's practices,
all departed for San Francisco
with something less than the
blase indifference usually at
tributed to StanforditeS.
As we arrived on the top
floor of the renovated ware
house used by Synanon, two
things were readily apparent;
the austere cleanliness of the
area, and the well-mannered,
neat appearance of the members
(coats and ties for the men,
dresses and high heels for the
women), which rendered most
virtually indistinguishable from
the visiting doctors, lawyers,
and others gathered in the large
room.

Only occasionally was there
an individual whose personal
ity and facial expression ap
peared to be irreparably scar
red by his experience as an
addict. On the whole, it was dif
ficult to believe that those with

whom we shoke were other
than persons of conventional
experience. The regional dir
ector, Jack Hurst, is very per
sonable, highly articulate, and
a former addict. If one is
looking for stereotyped "ex
junkie," Synanon is the wrong
place.
The general meeting began
with a reading of the Synanon
Philosophy, which is an affir
mation that an individual, no
matter how undisciplined and
depraved, can live productively
if he wants to. All present
were then invited to comment
on a characteristically vague
quotation from Emerson;
"Everything good is the re
sult of antagonism."
The ostensible purpose of the
inconclusive exchange of plati
tudes said in response to this
gem of Emersonia was to en
courage visitors to feel at ease
by having some of their num
ber say a word or two; Synan
on members did most of the
talking, however.
Next, two "birthdays" (an
niversaries) were comemor
ated by having the celebrants
tell of their former lives as
addicts, contrasting these with
their far superior lot as re
sidents at Synanon House. The
meeting was concluded with an
invitation to remain for a sym
posium, during which questions
of visitors would be answered.
In the meantime, we were ush
ered into the art gallery, which

contains works by residents.
Virtually everything was im
itatively modern. Most of the
painting was a la Picasso,
while the sculpture was after
the manner of Giacometti. Ti
tles tended to suggest the art
ists' narcotic past: "Half and
Half, Other Self," etc.
As the symposium pro
gressed, Synanon's general
method became clear; an ad

required to stop using anything
that might impair his thinking
and judgement, such as al
cohol, chemicals, and, of
course, drugs.
It is an axiom of Synanon
belief that an addict is emotion
ally a child; otherwise, he would
not have sought refuge from
life in narcotics. He is given
no responsibility, and is as
signed the most menial of tasks.
As he gradually begins to act
and think as an adult, he is
given more meaningful tasks
to perform; in addition, he is
treated with more respect.
Throughout the three year
period in which the transition
is made, the ex-addict is re
quired to behave as an adult,
even if he has not fully at
tained that state--except, of
course, when he is participat
ing in the thrice-weekly Syn
anon Game.
This "game " is the core of
the Synanon method of rehab
ilitation. It consists of a group
meeting of eight to ten mem
bers who discuss each other's
character flaws, often with ex
cruciating frankness. The
meeting is usually noisy, but
it provides a catharsis—
a means of verbally releasing
agressions which, because they
were formerly given no outlet,
might have caused the quest
for sanctuary in drugs. Pain
fully, the new member is forced
by his fellows to come to a real
ization of what he is, and how
he may improve himself. The
emphasis, to use the official
term, is on "emotional edu
cation." It is not, strictly
speaking, group therapy.
It sounds a bit cruel, but the
Synanon Game and related
stringent discipline bring re
sults; public hospitals and pri
sons hope at best for a ten
percent permanent "cure" rate
while Synanon's actual average
tops fifty percent. This ap
proach toward amelioration of
addiction is successful pro
bably because it is administered
by former addicts; "a junkie
can't con an ex-junkie," a
resident told me. The Synanon
initiate is given no sympathy,
or gradually reduced regimen
of drugs, as he is in conven
tional institutions—he is told
how "stupid" he is for be
coming an addict, and that he
had better get his withdrawal
period concluded, so he can be
gin to be a human, possibly
for the first time in his life.
Controversial as the Synanon
Game remains, it is now em

ployed in various institutions
outside Synanon; there is an
active chapter in the Nevada
State Prison, for example.
The most strident criticism
levied against Synanon by its
detractors is the valid obser
vation that once a resident is
cured he tends to remain within
the organization, rather than
returning to life on the "out
side." In short, Synanon is seen
by some to be a crutch, a sub
stitute for dope. But all of us
employ crutches every day
eating, drinking, smoking, sex,
general hell-raising—to help us
escape life's oppressions. Per
haps the individuals in Synanon
are only partially "cur6d, and
perhaps they need a strong or
ganization to keep them from
becoming addicts again. Even if,
for the sake of argument, they
have traded subservience to the
needle for subservience to the
group, the members of Syn
anon have rejoined the human
race, and this is an advan
tageous trade.
In addition, Synanon is be
coming a "way of life, " in
itself; persons who have never
been addicts are joining this
communal society, simply be
cause they find it exciting, and
are inspired by its noble pur
pose, Synanon industries,
(operation of a chain of Tex
aco stations, distribution of
ball-point pens) shows promise
of becoming a large-scale bus
iness venture. The purpose of
these recent commercial ac
tivities is to make Synanon
"self-reliant." (Emerson is
used freely in the official
rationale.)
But Emerson spoke of the
self-reliance of the individual,
not the society. How does the
individual, as an individual, fare
in Synanon? Probably as well
as he wants to. It must be
remembered that all residents,
having been transformed into
