## Synanon Philosophy Anything Is Possible 
### Mike McDermott 
On the evening of Saturday,
June 25, some thirty Stanford
students met behind the cam
pus bookstore to make a trip,
arranged by the Ecumenical Co
ordinating Committee, whose
purpose was to attend the
weekly open house held by Syn
anon -- an organization dedi
cated to curing narcotics ad
dicts with no n - professional
means employed by non -pro
fessionals, themselves usually
former addicts.
Since there is considerable
cor*roversy associated with
this organization's practices,
all departed for San Francisco
with something less than the
blase indifference usually at
tributed to StanforditeS.
As we arrived on the top
floor of the renovated ware
house used by Synanon, two
things were readily apparent;
the austere cleanliness of the
area, and the well-mannered,
neat appearance of the members
(coats and ties for the men,
dresses and high heels for the
women), which rendered most
virtually indistinguishable from
the visiting doctors, lawyers,
and others gathered in the large
room.

Only occasionally was there
an individual whose personal
ity and facial expression ap
peared to be irreparably scar
red by his experience as an
addict. On the whole, it was dif
ficult to believe that those with

whom we shoke were other
than persons of conventional
experience. The regional dir
ector, Jack Hurst, is very per
sonable, highly articulate, and
a former addict. If one is
looking for stereotyped "ex
junkie," Synanon is the wrong
place.
The general meeting began
with a reading of the Synanon
Philosophy, which is an affir
mation that an individual, no
matter how undisciplined and
depraved, can live productively
if he wants to. All present
were then invited to comment
on a characteristically vague
quotation from Emerson;
"Everything good is the re
sult of antagonism."
The ostensible purpose of the
inconclusive exchange of plati
tudes said in response to this
gem of Emersonia was to en
courage visitors to feel at ease
by having some of their num
ber say a word or two; Synan
on members did most of the
talking, however.
Next, two "birthdays" (an
niversaries) were comemor
ated by having the celebrants
tell of their former lives as
addicts, contrasting these with
their far superior lot as re
sidents at Synanon House. The
meeting was concluded with an
invitation to remain for a sym
posium, during which questions
of visitors would be answered.
In the meantime, we were ush
ered into the art gallery, which

contains works by residents.
Virtually everything was im
itatively modern. Most of the
painting was a la Picasso,
while the sculpture was after
the manner of Giacometti. Ti
tles tended to suggest the art
ists' narcotic past: "Half and
Half, Other Self," etc.
As the symposium pro
gressed, Synanon's general
method became clear; an ad
