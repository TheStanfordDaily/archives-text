# First 'Weekly' Tour: Napa Valley
## 
### Steve Gruber 
Only 90 minutes from Palo
Alto is one of the finest wine
producing areas in California.
A leisurely tour can be made
of the Napa Valley in a half
day. It is an uncluttered area,
replete with miles of vineyards,
and wine-tasting rooms.
With roadmap in hand, drive
up Bayshore, across the Bay
Bridge, and through Vallejo.
Your destination is somewhere
around St. Helena, the center
of the wineries.

Just before you reach St. Hel
ena, on highway 29, you will
come to a small town, Ruther
ford. On your right will be your
first stop, the Beaulieu Vine
yard Winery.
Beaulieu is what this writer
would term, "a friendly win
ery." Visitors are invited to
drink nearly as much free wine
as they want, the management
is informative, and their winery
tour is optional. However, the
tasting room is small and visi
tors would be wise to stop
there either early or late in

the day.
Now that you have been able
to relax after the long drive
from Stanford, travel to St, Hel
ena. On the northern edge of
the city you will find the Ber
ringer Brothers Winery, al
ledgedly the only winery in the
area that has been in constant
operation since it was built in
1879. Don't forget that this time
span includes the 1906 earth
quake and prohibition. During
prohibition the Berringer
Brothers stayed in existence by
selling altar wine to religious
groups.
Berringer Brothers have
tours leaving everyfifteen min
utes from the "Rhine House."
Note that there is no other way
to get to the tasting room, ex
cept by going on the tour. It
will take about thirty minutes
and caji prove to be interest
ing.
Once you do get to the tast
ing room, you will be allowed
three glasses of wine, if your
hands are quicker than their
eyes, you can probably get six
glasses of wine. Remember,
too, that these glasses are ap
proximately half the size of
[the glasses at Beaulieu.
After soaking up Berringer
Brothers' booze, drive about
a half mile up the road and
you will find the Charles Krug
winery on the left and the
the right. It is one of the fin
the legt. It is one of the fin
est intersections in the entire

state.
Both Krug and Christian
Brothers demand tours before
the wine tasting can begin. In
both cases the wait is worth
while. One note here; don't
start buying everything you see
unless there is substantial dif
ference in prices between their
shops and your neighborhood
liquor store. Both brands are
sold in nearly every corner of
the state, it might be wise
to check Palo Alto wine prices
before leaving.
If you can still drive, go

further north until you see a
sign to your right for th Hans
Kornell Champagne winery. No,
they won't serve you any cham
pagne. To do so, according to
the lady who owns the place,
would be to invite the whole
Bay Area to drop in once a
week. Their wine is good, how
ever. The winery tour is option
al, but more interesting than
most.
If you can remember which
way is south, or for that mat
ter, how to start your car,
head back through St. Helena

and Rutherford. You might stop
in at Beaulieu ior a few more
snorts if you have a large
capacity.
Take route 12-121 at Napa
and drive west toward Schel
lville and Sonoma. Just out
side of Sonoma you will see
the Sebastiani v/inery and if
you still have a thirst for wine,
they may be able to help you.
Continue over highway 116
to Petaluma and turn left onto
101. Keep driving south until
you find Palo Alto, you can't
miss it.

Take route 12-121 at Napa

Rutherford, California


The proprietor smiles at Beaulieu Winery as the visitors come to sample his wine.
Only 90 minutes from Palo
Alto is one of the finest wine
producing areas in California.
A leisurely tour can be made
of the Napa Valley in a half
day. It is an uncluttered area,
replete with miles of vineyards,
and wine-tasting rooms.
With roadmap in hand, drive
up Bayshore, across the Bay
Bridge, and through Vallejo.
Your destination is somewhere
around St. Helena, the center
of the wineries.

Just before you reach St. Hel
ena, on highway 29, you will
come to a small town, Ruther
ford. On your right will be your
first stop, the Beaulieu Vine
yard Winery.
Beaulieu is what this writer
would term, "a friendly win
ery." Visitors are invited to
drink nearly as much free wine
as they want, the management
is informative, and their winery
tour is optional. However, the
tasting room is small and visi
tors would be wise to stop
there either early or late in

the day.
Now that you have been able
to relax after the long drive
from Stanford, travel to St, Hel
ena. On the northern edge of
the city you will find the Ber
ringer Brothers Winery, al
ledgedly the only winery in the
area that has been in constant
operation since it was built in
1879. Don't forget that this time
span includes the 1906 earth
quake and prohibition. During
prohibition the Berringer
Brothers stayed in existence by
selling altar wine to religious
groups.
Berringer Brothers have
tours leaving everyfifteen min
utes from the "Rhine House."
Note that there is no other way
to get to the tasting room, ex
cept by going on the tour. It
will take about thirty minutes
and caji prove to be interest
ing.
Once you do get to the tast
ing room, you will be allowed
three glasses of wine, if your
hands are quicker than their
eyes, you can probably get six
glasses of wine. Remember,
too, that these glasses are ap
proximately half the size of
[the glasses at Beaulieu.
After soaking up Berringer
Brothers' booze, drive about
a half mile up the road and
you will find the Charles Krug
winery on the left and the
the right. It is one of the fin
the legt. It is one of the fin
est intersections in the entire

state.
Both Krug and Christian
Brothers demand tours before
the wine tasting can begin. In
both cases the wait is worth
while. One note here; don't
start buying everything you see
unless there is substantial dif
ference in prices between their
shops and your neighborhood
liquor store. Both brands are
sold in nearly every corner of
the state, it might be wise
to check Palo Alto wine prices
before leaving.
If you can still drive, go

further north until you see a
sign to your right for th Hans
Kornell Champagne winery. No,
they won't serve you any cham
pagne. To do so, according to
the lady who owns the place,
would be to invite the whole
Bay Area to drop in once a
week. Their wine is good, how
ever. The winery tour is option
al, but more interesting than
most.
If you can remember which
way is south, or for that mat
ter, how to start your car,
head back through St. Helena

and Rutherford. You might stop
in at Beaulieu ior a few more
snorts if you have a large
capacity.
