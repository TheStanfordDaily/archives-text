### Gordon Piper 
Easily recognizable by his
sparkling blue eyes, white hair,
and Assyrian beard, conductor
Ernest Ansermet is a fascin
ating and delightful little man.
Despite his age (he is 82),
Ansermet is still amazingly
agile. He walks with a smooth
steady pace and can often be
seen scurrying to and from
meetings and rehearsals here
on campus.
On the concert stage at Frost
Amphitheater the maestro is
literally animated. His hands
vibrate with feeling and emo
tion, as his eyes dance over
the notes set down by Bar
tok, Debussy, or Stravinsky.
In a private conversation, one
can almost see Ansermet's tre
mendous mind working. He can
recall almost any musical piece
written and its composer in an
instant, then without a moment's
hesitation tell when and where
he has heard it performed or
has performed it himself.
The conductor's mind is

equally quick when it comes to
remembering an amusing in
cident or anecdote. Beneath his
rather aristocratic, all-busi
ness exterior lies the heart
of a true comedian. His subtle
humor makes everyone feel re
laxed in his presence.
Home for Ansermet is nearly
half way around the world in
Geneva, Switzerland. He re
sides there with his wife Juli
ette. They have one married
daughter and a grandson. But,
as Ansermet says with a smile,
"Regretfully, there are no more
musicians in the family."
In his leisure time Ansermet
enjoys reading philosphy, and he
considers this his only real
hobby. Occasionally, however,
the maestro returns to his first
love which is composing music.
As Ansermet told reporters
at a press conference last week,
he began his career with the
hope of being a composer. But,
after a few years he decided
instead to devote himself to con
ducting.

To support himself until he
established himself as a con
ductor, Ansermet trained pro
fessionally as a mathematician
and taught for several years.
Explaining how he developed

his technique as a conductor,
Ansermet said, <<i followed the
great conductors and tried to
do what they were doing."
In 1912, at the age of 29,
Ansermet made his conducting

debut in Lausanne, Switzerland.
Only six years later the young
conductor struck out to found
an orchestra of his own in
Geneva, the Orchestre de la
Suisse Romande. The orchestra
and Ansermet were almost an
immediate success, attracting
world-wide attention.
Over the years Ansermet has
conducted hundreds of concerts
and has had many unusual ex
periences. One of the more
interesting performances was
as a guest conductor in musi
cally conservative Viennaâ€”a
city that appreciates a good old
fashioned waltze.
As Ansermet recalled, "I
directed an unusual new piece
that night that was somewhat
unorthodox for the time. When
the orchestra finished, there
was not a single hand clap!"
At another time in another
city, Ansermet decided that his
audience should hear a certain
piece through twice, if they

really were to appreciate it.
"During the second presenta
tion," Ansermet said, "I
heard a loud shuffling noise
behind me in the audience."
"When I turned around at the
conclusion of the number," he
continued with a slight grin,
"not a sole remained in the
whole auditorium."
With these two performances
as exceptions, Ansermet gen
erally enjoys his work as the
head conductor of a famous
orchestra. It has occupied the
major portion of his time and
attention for almost 50 years.
Until recently, Ansermet was
responsible for all the finan
cial affairs of the orchestra.
These have now been delegated
to an able assistant. But, he
still insists on arranging all
the orchestra's appearances,
selecting its music, and per
forming numerous other un
thanked tasks.
Since Ansermet founded his
own orchestra, he has always
had the problem of setting his
own salary. At the start, An
sermet insists, he was pro
bably "the least paid of all
conductors." As for his finan
cial condition today, he is non
commital, saying only, "with
the records (the orchestra
has recorded), I have made
more."
Explaining why he continues
to conduct after so many years,
the aging maestro said last
week, "I am conducting because
I love music and not because
I love conducting."
Ansermet has shared this
love for music with many peo
ple in many countries. He has
been all over Europe and made
visits to North and South Am
erica, as well as to Asia. Need
less to say, Ansermet loves to
travel.
Ansermet has visited the
United States many times and
his reaction to it is always the
same. As he says,"it gives
me new vigor."
