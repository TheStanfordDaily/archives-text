# Swiss Orchestra In U.S. Debut
## 
### David R. Denby 
Although L'Orchestre de la
Suisse Romande had never ap
peared in the United States
before its debut at the Stan
ford Summer Festival on June
22, neither the sound of the
Geneva orchestra nor the work
of its long-time master, Ernest
Ansermet, was unfamiliar. This
has become one of the most
frequently recorded orchestras
in the world, particularly in
the repertory of the impres
sionists and neo-classicists of
the twentieth century. For years
Ansermet was an important
force in contemporary music.
He was friends with Debussy,
Stravinsky and Ravel, among
others, and premiered many of
their works, although he dis
liked the composers of the
atonal school, banning their
works from the concert hall
and writing polemics against
them. With the exception of a
single piece by Alban Berg,
one will not hear anything in
the orchestra's concerts of mo
dern music by the atonal com

posers, which is an extraor
dinary omission.
Judging the orchestra's play
ing in the open-air Frost Am
phitheater is not quite fair (the
players reportedly had dif
ficulty hearing each other), but
still, after the first two con
certs certain conclusions could
be drawn. Like most European
orchestras, the Suisse Romande
does not try for the nervous
brilliance that is typical of the
best American orchestras. The
winds play with great accuracy
and beautiful phrasing in very
light, dry timbres, the best
section in the orchestra. The
strings struck me as undis
tinguished, with neither the
military precision of the Amer
ican orchestras of the warmth
of the great European ones.
The brasses were cautious,
really unwilling to blow hard;
they probably had been in
structed not to cover the rest
of the orchestra (brass instru
ments, of course, carry well
in the open air.)
Both orchestra and conductor
were at their best in music
of restricted dynamic scale.
In Debussy's "Jeux," in the
second movement of his "La
Mer" and in the Allegretto of
the Bartok "Concerto for Orch

estra," one heard playing that
was relaxed and free-floating,
beautifully tempered and sha
ded. But where was the drama
in the last movement of "La
Mer"? And except for its se
ond movement, the Bartok work
is not a gracious and soft
edged piece. The third move
ment is anguished, the finale
assertive and gay almost to the
point of hysteria. Ansermet was
too intent on making pretty
sounds to play this music as
it must be played; Bartok with
out anguish and the suggestion
of hysteria is not worth the
trouble.
The performance of Stravin
shy's "Petrouchka," although
it never went slack, was with
out the rhythmic precision, the
hard angularity that its best
interpreters have given it.
Arthur Honegger's music is
very ambitious in its spiritual
claims, but it has never con
veyed more to me than a kind
of harrassed sincerity. His
Symphony No* 3 f subtitled "Lit
urgical," which opened the first
concert had several sternly
impressive moments in the hec
tic first movement and some
shapely, soft melody in the
second, but the finale, despite
a crescendo of imposing disson
ance, failed to resolve the work
satisfactorily.
The "Sonanta da Camera"
of the late Czech composer
Bohuslav Martinu received its
American premier at the se
cond concert and turned out
to be a mild, rather aimless
piece that went on much too
long.
I should report that the atten
dance at the second concert
on June 24 was very small,
amounting to no more than a
thousand people. The more ex
pensive seats were almost en
tirely empty, perhaps the Fes
tival directors should as them
selves if $5.25 is not too much
for a decent seat at a concert
held outdoors.
