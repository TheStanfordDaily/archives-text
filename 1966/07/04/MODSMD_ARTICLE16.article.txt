# Prisoners Stretch

By Terri Seibert
Most publications seek to in
form. They may be directed
to a particular socio-economic,
ethnic or political sect, yet
their prime feature is news.
STRETCH is no exception.
With a definite slanted view
point, this monthly publication
of the Kansas State Penitenti
ary relates the news of pri
son life.
In addition to book reviews,
prison statistics, listings of fu
ture entertainment events, and
other regular columns,
STRETCH also contains timely
editorials and features.
One editorial voices the need
for prison lawyers. The edi
tor maintains that guidance
from legal counsel is a human
right that should be available
to the criminal who believes that
they have been imprisoned un
justly.
The editor notes that the pri
soner who seeks his own re
lease faces several handicaps.
First, he must resort to trial
and error or self taught legal
procedures in court. Secondly,
the prisoner who must rely on
his own inadequate legal train
ing cannot expect impartial
treatment of his case in a
court.
Not only are the inmates con- 1
cerned about legal matters,
some are worried about the
psychological implications of
prison life, too. One writer
states that the notion that the
criminal is rejected and ignored
by society is merely a feeling,
pense in an isolated recluse
from society.

which should be eliminated with
positive thinking. Somebody out
| there does care about inmate
i 007. To support his statement,
the writer adds that ambas
sadors, judges, professors,
ministers, and citizens have
written and expressed concern
about prison life.
Another article questions
I whether prison life cures or
coddles the criminal. The auth
or states that while some claim
that today's penal institutions
pamper prisoners, statistics
prove that a recently inaugur
ated rehabilitation program has
been beneficial. The new pro
gram provides intensive ses
sions for inmates with bankers,
merchants, sociologists and
psychologists, who offer tips for
success-re-entry into society.
The article points out that
recent statistics have verified
the success of the rehabilita
tion project. During the past
three years, of the 3000 prison
ers who participated inthepre
gram in Kansas, only 10% re
turned to prison, a decrease
from the normal.
