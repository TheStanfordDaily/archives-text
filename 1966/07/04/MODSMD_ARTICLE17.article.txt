The first amendment guarantees freedom of the press.
The Oregon state laws guarantee a speedy trial and fine
for journalists who refuse to name their sources.
And last week, Annette Buchanan was fined $300 after
conviction of contempt of court for refusing to name her
sources to the County Grand Jury for an article on marijuana
smoking in the University of Oregon paper.
Oregon is one of the 38 states without laws to protect jour
nalists when they strive for something better in their articles
than just public relations handouts. In contrast to this, California
has had laws protecting confidentiality of news sources for 35
years.
Newspapermen often have better contacts with the criminal
world than many police officers. To reveal these contacts would
mean fewer insights into activities that are hidden from the
view of society. To reveal these contacts would convert the
Fourth Estate into a group of policemen with press cards.
We applaud Miss Buchanan's courage for not revealing
her sources to the County Grand Jury who called her to name
names.
