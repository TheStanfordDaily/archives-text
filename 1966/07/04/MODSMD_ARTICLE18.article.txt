# Notes By The Underground

### 
For sometimes obvious rea
sons, mass media that present
stories specifically regarding
marijuana, hallucenogenic and
other 'dangerous" drugs rarely
give the full picture.
Sensationalism is seen as a
means of selling the media to
the public* The pictures pre
sented also reflect and enhance
the public's fear of what these
drugs may do to themselves
and their society.
Also, drug, alcohol, and to
bacco manufacturers have
vested and powerful interests
in keeping certain drugs illegal
and unavailable to the public.
But, more important, if the
full story were known to the
public, it would not support the
present Establishment. And the
Establishment wishes to sur
vive.
In fact, the bureaucracies
concerned might be said to exist
for their own sake. They would
do almost anything to perpetu
ate f hemselves regardless of
the effects that they have
on the people that they were
originally designed to protect.
If the drugs were legalized,
of if all of the major black
market manufacturers and dis
tributors were put out of Bus
iness, then the drug-controlling
bureaucracies would have no
raison d'etre—and no reason
for getting all of the money
that they are appropriated every
year.
It would be relatively simple
for the drug-controlling
agencies to "catch" all of the
major distributors of LSD and
marijuana.
Instead, as in San Jose, they
tend to play hide-and-seek.

They might make a.show-and
tell arrest of an individual well -
traveled in drug circles. He
reports back to those concerned
that the authorities have threa
tened to arrest them if they
don't 'unload' within x days.
One can always tell when an
area is feeling "the heat".
The local drug market goes wild
with the prices jumping and
dropping from day to day. And
the rat labs are filled with
happy rats as the remaining
drugs are carefully being stored
by users.
At the same time, mass media
run Banner headline-type stor
ies on "dope raids" although
marijuana and LSD are not dope.
Legislators and constituents
(most of whom are ignorant)
become alarmed and react ac
cordingly.
The drug user is hurt by all
of this. That he must "make
contacts" at all may ruin his
self-image so that he conceives
of himself as "bad" or "crim
inal". His "contacts" and/or
need of money for these high
priced drugs may also drive
him in the direction of crimin
ality.
But even if the user is a
well - heeled Stanford student
with a positive self - image, he
is subjected to the dangers of
an uncertain source.
That is , the student will not
have a consistent contact. Thus,
he cannot be guaranteed of con
sistent type, quality, and do
seage of the drug because his
source and his sources's source
are unstable.
This paricularly affects LSD
users. Black market LSD has
contaminants from incomplete

and improper processing. The
after- effects. As a result, the
user does not know what his
"trip" is going to be like, or
what ?.ts aftermath will be.
In Stanford's case, the closing
off of good, reliable sources in
San Jose has forcedsomeusers
to turn to Berkeley. Unfor
tunately, much of Berkeley's
LSD is loaded with naethadrine.
"Meth" is a psychologically
habit-forming drug that may be
harmful in the context of other
drugs.
But the mass media do not
tell us all of these things.
Rather, because the truth
about the use and potential uses
of marijuana and LSD (like
drug-addiction and alcoholism
therapy using LSD and DMSO)
would threaten the present or
der, the lives of many people
are being jeopardised.
Man has forgotten that bur
eaucracies were made to pro
tect men, and not men to pro
tect bureaucracies.

For sometimes obvious rea

Sensationalism is seen as a

Also, drug, alcohol, and to

But, more important, if the
full story were known to the

In fact, the bureaucracies
concerned might be said to exist

do almost anything to perpetu

the effects that they have
on the people that they were

If the drugs were legalized,
of if all of the major black
market manufacturers and dis
tributors were put out of Bus

bureaucracies would have no
raison d'etre—and no reason
for getting all of the money
that they are appropriated every
year.
It would be relatively simple
for the drug-controlling
agencies to "catch" all of the
major distributors of LSD and
marijuana.
Instead, as in San Jose, they
tend to play hide-and-seek.

The local drug market goes wild

marijuana and LSD are not dope.
Legislators and constituents

The drug user is hurt by all
of this. That he must "make
contacts" at all may ruin his
self-image so that he conceives
of himself as "bad" or "crim
inal". His "contacts" and/or
need of money for these high
priced drugs may also drive
him in the direction of crimin
ality.
But even if the user is a
well - heeled Stanford student
with a positive self - image, he
is subjected to the dangers of
an uncertain source.
That is , the student will not
have a consistent contact. Thus,
he cannot be guaranteed of con
sistent type, quality, and do
seage of the drug because his
source and his sources's source
are unstable.
This paricularly affects LSD
users. Black market LSD has
contaminants from incomplete

and improper processing. The
after- effects. As a result, the
user does not know what his
"trip" is going to be like, or

drug-addiction and alcoholism
