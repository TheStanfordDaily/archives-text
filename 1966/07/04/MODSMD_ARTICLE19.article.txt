# Stanford-A High School?
## 
### 
To the Editor;
I am a regular Stanford
student, but this is the first
time Ihave attended the summer
session. In the first couple of
weeks I have noticed several
major differences between the
atmosphere of the summer ses
sion and that of the normal
school year. I hate to see such
a great university deteriorate
just because it is summer, so
I would like to bring them to
the attention of the community
in the hope that something can
be done in the future if not
this summer.
First, I would like to know why
the University community lacks

meeting places in the summer.
The summer session attracts,
so many students who do not;
attend Stanford during the year,
that it is more essential for'
there to be campus meeting
places during the summer.
Many of the students do not have
transportation or do not know
the surrounding area and there
fore have no place to go but
back to their dorms when the
Union closes at 10:30. This
problem is even more serious
on weekends without benefit of
residences having parties. What!
the summer session needs most j
at this point is some casual'
meeting place with the coffee
house or similar atmosphere
to remain open late in the
evening, especially on week
ends.
Secondly, I would like to know
why the summer seems to;
trigger a general degradation
of the teaching level in most
courses. Many people I have
talked to have been genuinely
surprised at the almost "high
school" approach the summer
teachers seem to be taking in
running their courses. The
' major symptom of this slip
is the large number of classes
which require daily homework.
The summer quarter is not so
substantially shorter than reg
ular quarters that weekly or
semi-weekly assignments
would not suffice. These busy
work homework assignments
not only keep the students busy,
but take unnecessary time when
some complain about the bre
vity of the quarter. A teacher,
should be able to gain enough
information on the students
given 8 weeks of 4 classes
a-week with one homework as
-1 signment-a-week as the teacher
who only requires one assign

ment a week when teaching 9
weeks of three classes-a-week.
There seems no reason for
the summer session to work
from a lower base than the
rest of the year. Perhaps the
offering of a greater number
of regular year courses would
help by raising the academic
level. The teacher should real
ize that they are able to oper
ate with the same teaching for
mat in the summer. Then some
responsible members of the
community could remedy the
social problem, and perhaps the
Stanford of Summer could be
recognized as a kin to that of
the regular year.
