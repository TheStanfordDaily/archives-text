# SCPV Teach-in At Tresidder
## 
### Carol Weinstock 
The Stanford Committee for
Peace in Vietnam will hold
a teach-in Thursday and Fri
day, July 7 and 8 in the Tre
sidder large lounge.
The teach-in will last from
2 through 5:30 p.m. both days,
featuring about 5 different
speakers each day.
On Thursday, a member of
Wilfred Stone's group of faculty
and graduate students will give
a general background of the
war. This will be followed by
Stanford professor Bruce
Franklin's talk about peace of
fensives, Congressional candi
date George Leppert speaking
on U.S. domestic political as
pects of the war, and Cyril
Sia, former chairman of the
SCPV, will discuss the legal
position of the U.S. in Viet
nam.
On Friday, Dick Newlin, of
the SCPV will speak on con
scientious objectors. Lieu
tenant Howe, who claimed to
be a conscientious objector
while in the army, will tell of
his experiences, professor Ken
Mills of Stanford will discuss
the moral aspects of Vietnam,
and Keith Lowe will speak on
insurgency in Vietnam.
There may also be speeches
by Don Duncan, military edi
tor of Ramparts magazine, or
retired Admiral True. Details
of Friday night will be an
nounced later in the week.
the SCPV is a group or
ganized at Stanford in the past
year to protest U.S. policy in
Vietnam. Through the Vietnam
Newsletter, published at Stan
ford, rallies, and teach-ins, the

group tries to inform people of
the background of the war, the
current situation and possible
alternatives to current U.S. pol
icy.
Other activities include en
dorsement of bay area peace
candidates, and letter and tele
gram campaigns to Congress
men and to the president.
During the regular school
year there are about 700 mem
bers
Bob Cronbach, a member of
the SCPV steering committee,
says that many people are very
uniformed about what is hap
pening in Vietnam. During a
referendum drive to protest
napalm production in Redwood
City, a housewife, when asked
for her signature, replied, "But
I don't use napalm. I use Tide."
Cronbach feels that a summer
teach-in has the possibility of
influencing a different kind of
group than would regularly be
reached at Stanford.
"During the summer," he
said; "We can reach high school
teachers and students, as well
as students from other areas
not ordinarily exposed to this
kind of information."
The members of the SCPV
differ over exactly what they
feel the U.S. should do in Viet
nam to end the war.
All agree that the U.S.should
negotiate with the North Viet
namese and the Viet Cong.
Some, however, would favor
complete U.S. withdrawal from
Vietnam, while Cronbach, for
instance, thinks that we should
maintain defensive enclaves in
the country, but cease all of
fensive activity.

Some, however, would favor
complete U.S. withdrawal from
Vietnam, while Cronbach, for
instance, thinks that we should
maintain defensive enclaves in
the country, but cease all of
fensive activity.

The Stanford Committee for
Peace in Vietnam will hold
a teach-in Thursday and Fri
day, July 7 and 8 in the Tre
sidder large lounge.
The teach-in will last from
2 through 5:30 p.m. both days,
featuring about 5 different
speakers each day.
On Thursday, a member of
Wilfred Stone's group of faculty
and graduate students will give
a general background of the
war. This will be followed by
Stanford professor Bruce
Franklin's talk about peace of
fensives, Congressional candi
date George Leppert speaking
on U.S. domestic political as
pects of the war, and Cyril
Sia, former chairman of the
SCPV, will discuss the legal
position of the U.S. in Viet
nam.
On Friday, Dick Newlin, of
the SCPV will speak on con
scientious objectors. Lieu
tenant Howe, who claimed to
be a conscientious objector
while in the army, will tell of
his experiences, professor Ken
Mills of Stanford will discuss
the moral aspects of Vietnam,
and Keith Lowe will speak on
insurgency in Vietnam.
There may also be speeches
by Don Duncan, military edi
tor of Ramparts magazine, or
retired Admiral True. Details
of Friday night will be an
nounced later in the week.
the SCPV is a group or
ganized at Stanford in the past
year to protest U.S. policy in
Vietnam. Through the Vietnam
Newsletter, published at Stan
ford, rallies, and teach-ins, the

group tries to inform people of
the background of the war, the
current situation and possible
alternatives to current U.S. pol

Other activities include en

candidates, and letter and tele

men and to the president.

Bob Cronbach, a member of
the SCPV steering committee,
says that many people are very
uniformed about what is hap
pening in Vietnam. During a
referendum drive to protest
napalm production in Redwood
City, a housewife, when asked
for her signature, replied, "But
I don't use napalm. I use Tide."
Cronbach feels that a summer
teach-in has the possibility of
influencing a different kind of
group than would regularly be
reached at Stanford.
"During the summer," he
said; "We can reach high school
teachers and students, as well
as students from other areas
not ordinarily exposed to this
kind of information."
The members of the SCPV
differ over exactly what they
feel the U.S. should do in Viet
nam to end the war.
All agree that the U.S.should
negotiate with the North Viet
namese and the Viet Cong.
