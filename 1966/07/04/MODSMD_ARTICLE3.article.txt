# PARIS, 1900

Film may be the only truly
innovative art form produced
by the twentieth century. This
statement is a truism on its
way to becoming a cliche. Every
film student discovers it with
joy early in his study of film.
The development of film gave
the creative person a new and
distinctive way of saying some
thing.
"Paris, 1900," the first
presentation in the Summer
Festival Film Series is a 75
minute exploration into the be
ginnings of movies. The film,
made in 1948, is a portrait
of Paris between 1900 and 1914
using film shot during these
years.
The film's interest for the
social and political historian
lies in WHAT was shot. For the
film historina the excitement
of this film is in the HOW and
the WHY.
"Paris, 1900," is composed
of news clips (or more prop
erly, what we would now call
news clips), excerpts from
comic films and long cinema
verite-like sequences woven to
gether by skillful editing and a
witty narration spoken by Monty
Wooly.

The anonymous men behind
the cameras are just discov
ering—or have just seen some
body else discover the elemen
tary possibilities of the camera.,
The camera moves, zooms in
for close-ups, gets mounted
on a bi-plane and shoots over
the shoulder of the pilot. The
early comic films are begin
ning to show the techniques
which are basic to animation.
More interesting even than
the minutae of technique in
this film is the understanding
of these early cameramen of
one of the most basic and power
ful possibilities of film—its
ability to record and also to
dissect reality.
It is probably a mistake to
think of these men as poets
cleverly disguised behind their
tripods--much skillful editing
went into this film. How many
hours of footage was shot, I
wonder; and how many hours
was edited out to leave a mar
velous 10 second sequence in
which one over-stuffed, over
dressed equally grand dame who
has just stepped on her train?
Throughout the film one is
caught up in the joy and ex
citement of the work done. The
camera slides lovingly over the
arches of the Eiffel Tower. The
camera is set up in a huge
market place and records the
shy fascination of the market
women with the machine. The
camera records riots, police
chases, scientific experiments.
It's there. On the spot. Where
it was happening.


The fine furnishings and splendid Spanish architecture of
Lagunita Court are hardly noticed during visiting hours.
