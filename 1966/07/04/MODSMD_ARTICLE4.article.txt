First free day in San Fran
cisco, wanted something unus
ual to do. So, checked the pos
ters and announcements hung
abundantly on the walls at City
Lights on Columbus Street, the
most complete bookstore
around and also one of the

unrecognizable soup, which
looked like muddy water, tasted

couldn't get any African spec

Friendly waiters, and spotted
Connie, an ominously propor

more exclusive restaurants
where you never see any of
the cooks. They might as well
be robots throwing vegetables

weren't bad, either —about
$2.50 apiece for a four-course
dinner...

North Beach. The first, stuck
in amongst the "topless mother
of eight," the "all-topless

the "Bocce Bowl." An Italian
place, it specializes in Viennese
coffee (with brandy and whip
ped cream) for $1.25, supple
mented by three fully-clothed
entertainers who sing operatic
arias and popular songs on
request, accompanied by piano
or accordion. Scenes from
"Carmen," "Don Giovanni,"
etc. decorated the walls, in
formal atmosphere, with the
tenor leaving the stage for a
