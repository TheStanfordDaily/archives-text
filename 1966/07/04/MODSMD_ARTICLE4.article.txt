# First Free Day In City
## 
### Jane Dotson 
Sunday, June 12
First free day in San Fran
cisco, wanted something unus
ual to do. So, checked the pos
ters and announcements hung
abundantly on the walls at City
Lights on Columbus Street, the
most complete bookstore
around and also one of the
best places to find out what's
happening in the City—the
ater, music, art exhibits, Fill
more Auditorium dances, sem
inars, sessons in every phase
of the creative arts, even cats
for sale.
Decided on the Marc Wilde
Ballet Company recital at the
Harding Theater—excellent
modern choreography in two
of the four numbers—then ate
dinner at Connie's, 1466Haight.
Curry, gumbo, in wooden bowls
to pour over rice or eat with
a spoon; fantastic homemade
bread of some sort, New Or
leans coffee laced with chicory,
unrecognizable soup, which
looked like muddy water, tasted
great.
The window advertised West
Indian and African cuisine, but
couldn't get any African spec
ialities—found out they had to
be ordered a day in advance.
Friendly waiters, and spotted
Connie, an ominously propor
tioned Negress, giving orders
out in the kitchen—sort of a
cozy feeling compared to the
more exclusive restaurants
where you never see any of
the cooks. They might as well
be robots throwing vegetables
into a pot. Connie's prices
weren't bad, either —about
$2.50 apiece for a four-course
dinner...
Friday, June 17
Found two great places on
North Beach. The first, stuck
in amongst the "topless mother
of eight," the "all-topless
band,' and the "genuine top
less coed" night clubs, is called
the "Bocce Bowl." An Italian
place, it specializes in Viennese
coffee (with brandy and whip
ped cream) for $1.25, supple
mented by three fully-clothed
entertainers who sing operatic
arias and popular songs on
request, accompanied by piano
or accordion. Scenes from
"Carmen," "Don Giovanni,"
etc. decorated the walls, in
formal atmosphere, with the
tenor leaving the stage for a
drink, the soprano humming
along with the accordion play
er's redition of "I Left My
Heart in San Francisco." Was
almost tempted to sing along
with her.
Stopped in at Mike's Pool
Hall to find out why a dingy
hangout had drawn more cus
tomers than Oscar Feterson
at Basin Street West on the cor
ner. Could be the mammoth
80<? torpedo sandwiches, or the
ringside seats to the parade
of boisterous Rotary Clubbers
on convention, scurry mid
dle-aged couples, and elabor
ately-dressed women suspen
ded for a moment between bars.
And Mike's late-night crowd
was in itself fascinating —
young girls in bell-bottoms,
derelicts, groups of young men
drinking beer and talking, wo
men in mink, pool hustlers,
an unexpected conglomeration..
Saturday, June 18
Bought some wine, rented a
bicycle for $1.50 per hour at
a Stanyan Street shop, and took
off through Golden Gate Park in
search of an antidote to the
Saturday confusion of the City.
I don't know if it was the
glories of Nature or the wine,
but it worked. Found a bench
in the Shakespeare Gardens
there, and spent two hours en
joying the quiet and reading the
Shakespearean quotations which
inspired this garden limited
to plants mentioned in his wri
ting. I wanted to see some of the

more unusual ones, like pease
blossom, cowslips, and fennel,
but unfortunately the only
flowers in bloom this time of
year were the more common
columbines, lilies, andpansies.
A magnificent holly tree grow
ing in one corner of the garden
far-outshone the flowers.
Rode slowly back to the bike
shop, wishing for a little more
time to explore the Japanese
tea gardens, the museum and
planetarium. Some other
time....
Thursday, June 23
Found an extraordinary book
store, the Metaphysical Town-
Hall Book Shop, on the sec
ond floor at 435 Powell. Fol
lowed a lady in a black feath
ered hat who vaguely resem
bled one of the modern-day
witches in Bell, Book and Can
dle, into a gilt elevator which
was built around the turn of
the century, stepped out of it
into the world of the occult.
This shop specializes in "all
American and English Meta
physical literature, English and
Indian i imports on Oriental
philosophy and religion, books
in the psychic and spiritulistic
fields, astrology, tarot, and kin
dred subjects." Wild. I arrived
shortly after the 9 p.m. clos
ing hour and talked to the man
ager briefly about death and
reincarnation, and the com
plexity of astrological horo
scopes. He was quite learned
in these out-of-the-way fields,
and seemed sincere in his con
victions. Plan to attend one of
the Friday night astrology les
sons he teaches, maybe next
week...

of the four numbers—then ate
dinner at Connie's, 1466Haight.
Curry, gumbo, in wooden bowls
to pour over rice or eat with
a spoon; fantastic homemade
bread of some sort, New Or
leans coffee laced with chicory,
unrecognizable soup, which
looked like muddy water, tasted
great.
The window advertised West
Indian and African cuisine, but
couldn't get any African spec
ialities—found out they had to
be ordered a day in advance.
Friendly waiters, and spotted
Connie, an ominously propor
tioned Negress, giving orders
out in the kitchen—sort of a
cozy feeling compared to the
more exclusive restaurants
where you never see any of
the cooks. They might as well
be robots throwing vegetables
into a pot. Connie's prices
weren't bad, either —about
$2.50 apiece for a four-course
dinner...
Friday, June 17
Found two great places on
North Beach. The first, stuck
in amongst the "topless mother
of eight," the "all-topless
band,' and the "genuine top
less coed" night clubs, is called
the "Bocce Bowl." An Italian
place, it specializes in Viennese
coffee (with brandy and whip
ped cream) for $1.25, supple
mented by three fully-clothed
entertainers who sing operatic
arias and popular songs on
request, accompanied by piano
or accordion. Scenes from
"Carmen," "Don Giovanni,"
etc. decorated the walls, in
formal atmosphere, with the
tenor leaving the stage for a
drink, the soprano humming
along with the accordion play
er's redition of "I Left My
Heart in San Francisco." Was
almost tempted to sing along
with her.
Stopped in at Mike's Pool
Hall to find out why a dingy
hangout had drawn more cus
tomers than Oscar Feterson
at Basin Street West on the cor
ner. Could be the mammoth
80<? torpedo sandwiches, or the
ringside seats to the parade
of boisterous Rotary Clubbers
on convention, scurry mid
dle-aged couples, and elabor
ately-dressed women suspen
ded for a moment between bars.
And Mike's late-night crowd
was in itself fascinating —
young girls in bell-bottoms,
derelicts, groups of young men
drinking beer and talking, wo
men in mink, pool hustlers,
an unexpected conglomeration..
Saturday, June 18
Bought some wine, rented a
bicycle for $1.50 per hour at
a Stanyan Street shop, and took
off through Golden Gate Park in
search of an antidote to the
Saturday confusion of the City.
I don't know if it was the
glories of Nature or the wine,
but it worked. Found a bench
in the Shakespeare Gardens
there, and spent two hours en
joying the quiet and reading the
Shakespearean quotations which
inspired this garden limited
to plants mentioned in his wri
ting. I wanted to see some of the

more unusual ones, like pease
blossom, cowslips, and fennel,
but unfortunately the only
flowers in bloom this time of
year were the more common
columbines, lilies, andpansies.
A magnificent holly tree grow
ing in one corner of the garden
far-outshone the flowers.
Rode slowly back to the bike
shop, wishing for a little more
time to explore the Japanese
tea gardens, the museum and
planetarium. Some other
time....

Found an extraordinary book
store, the Metaphysical Town-
Hall Book Shop, on the sec
ond floor at 435 Powell. Fol
lowed a lady in a black feath
ered hat who vaguely resem
bled one of the modern-day
witches in Bell, Book and Can
dle, into a gilt elevator which
was built around the turn of
the century, stepped out of it
into the world of the occult.
This shop specializes in "all
American and English Meta
physical literature, English and
Indian i imports on Oriental
philosophy and religion, books
in the psychic and spiritulistic
fields, astrology, tarot, and kin
dred subjects." Wild. I arrived
shortly after the 9 p.m. clos
ing hour and talked to the man
ager briefly about death and
reincarnation, and the com
plexity of astrological horo
scopes. He was quite learned
in these out-of-the-way fields,
and seemed sincere in his con
victions. Plan to attend one of
the Friday night astrology les
sons he teaches, maybe next
week...
Sunday, June 12
First free day in San Fran
cisco, wanted something unus
ual to do. So, checked the pos
ters and announcements hung
abundantly on the walls at City
Lights on Columbus Street, the
most complete bookstore
around and also one of the
best places to find out what's
happening in the City—the
ater, music, art exhibits, Fill
more Auditorium dances, sem
inars, sessons in every phase
of the creative arts, even cats
for sale.

cozy feeling compared to the
more exclusive restaurants
where you never see any of
the cooks. They might as well
be robots throwing vegetables
into a pot. Connie's prices
weren't bad, either —about
$2.50 apiece for a four-course
dinner...

Found two great places on
North Beach. The first, stuck
in amongst the "topless mother
of eight," the "all-topless
band,' and the "genuine top
less coed" night clubs, is called
the "Bocce Bowl." An Italian
place, it specializes in Viennese
coffee (with brandy and whip
ped cream) for $1.25, supple
mented by three fully-clothed
entertainers who sing operatic
arias and popular songs on
request, accompanied by piano
or accordion. Scenes from
"Carmen," "Don Giovanni,"
etc. decorated the walls, in
formal atmosphere, with the
tenor leaving the stage for a
drink, the soprano humming
along with the accordion play
er's redition of "I Left My
Heart in San Francisco." Was
almost tempted to sing along
with her.
Stopped in at Mike's Pool
Hall to find out why a dingy
hangout had drawn more cus
tomers than Oscar Feterson
at Basin Street West on the cor
ner. Could be the mammoth
80<? torpedo sandwiches, or the
ringside seats to the parade
of boisterous Rotary Clubbers
on convention, scurry mid
dle-aged couples, and elabor
ately-dressed women suspen
ded for a moment between bars.
And Mike's late-night crowd
was in itself fascinating —
young girls in bell-bottoms,
derelicts, groups of young men
drinking beer and talking, wo
men in mink, pool hustlers,
an unexpected conglomeration..
Saturday, June 18
Bought some wine, rented a
bicycle for $1.50 per hour at
a Stanyan Street shop, and took
off through Golden Gate Park in
search of an antidote to the
Saturday confusion of the City.
I don't know if it was the
glories of Nature or the wine,
but it worked. Found a bench
in the Shakespeare Gardens
there, and spent two hours en
joying the quiet and reading the
Shakespearean quotations which
inspired this garden limited
to plants mentioned in his wri
ting. I wanted to see some of the

more unusual ones, like pease
blossom, cowslips, and fennel,
but unfortunately the only
flowers in bloom this time of
year were the more common
columbines, lilies, andpansies.
A magnificent holly tree grow
ing in one corner of the garden
far-outshone the flowers.
Rode slowly back to the bike
shop, wishing for a little more
time to explore the Japanese
tea gardens, the museum and
planetarium. Some other
time....

Found an extraordinary book
store, the Metaphysical Town-
Hall Book Shop, on the sec
ond floor at 435 Powell. Fol
lowed a lady in a black feath
ered hat who vaguely resem
bled one of the modern-day
witches in Bell, Book and Can
dle, into a gilt elevator which
was built around the turn of
the century, stepped out of it
into the world of the occult.
This shop specializes in "all
American and English Meta
physical literature, English and
Indian i imports on Oriental
philosophy and religion, books
in the psychic and spiritulistic
fields, astrology, tarot, and kin
dred subjects." Wild. I arrived
shortly after the 9 p.m. clos
ing hour and talked to the man
ager briefly about death and
reincarnation, and the com
plexity of astrological horo
scopes. He was quite learned
in these out-of-the-way fields,
and seemed sincere in his con
victions. Plan to attend one of
the Friday night astrology les
sons he teaches, maybe next
week...
Sunday, June 12
First free day in San Fran
cisco, wanted something unus
ual to do. So, checked the pos
ters and announcements hung
abundantly on the walls at City
Lights on Columbus Street, the
most complete bookstore
around and also one of the
best places to find out what's
happening in the City—the
ater, music, art exhibits, Fill
more Auditorium dances, sem
inars, sessons in every phase
of the creative arts, even cats
for sale.
Decided on the Marc Wilde
Ballet Company recital at the
Harding Theater—excellent
modern choreography in two
of the four numbers—then ate
dinner at Connie's, 1466Haight.
Curry, gumbo, in wooden bowls
to pour over rice or eat with
a spoon; fantastic homemade
bread of some sort, New Or
leans coffee laced with chicory,
unrecognizable soup, which
looked like muddy water, tasted
great.
The window advertised West
Indian and African cuisine, but
couldn't get any African spec
ialities—found out they had to
be ordered a day in advance.
Friendly waiters, and spotted
Connie, an ominously propor
tioned Negress, giving orders
out in the kitchen—sort of a
cozy feeling compared to the
more exclusive restaurants
where you never see any of
the cooks. They might as well
be robots throwing vegetables
