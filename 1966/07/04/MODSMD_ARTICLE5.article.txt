# LASSU Coffee Debate
## 
### 
Legislature members
debated a campus coffee house
last Tuesday afternoon.
Tresidder's earlier closing
time, 10:30 PM and its dorm
itory-like atmosphere were
main causes for the debate.
Optimism was expressed that
the Associated Students would
be able to find a building on
campus to house the ratskeller
like operation for the summer.
During the past year--and
also last summer--the New
Celler in the Women's
Clubhouse was used for this
purpose on Friday nights.
No formal actions were taken
by the Legislature, but several
individuals were assigned to
investigate the possible use of
the Storle Publications Build
ing, the Band Shack, The In
ternational Center and Wilbur
Hall as sites for the coffee
house. Detailed cost estimates
were to be submitted at a
scheduled Thursday meeting.
Terry Murphy, ASSU Fin
ancial Manager, expressed
doubts that the Storke Building
could be used. It belongs to
the University and the publica
tions pay for maintenance. Steve
Gruber, editor of the SUMMER
WEEKLY, also opposed use of
the Storke Building.
The Jester coffee house in
Wilbur Hall, is being used as
a storage area this summer.
Some interest was expressed by
the Legislature in using the
Soto lounge.
