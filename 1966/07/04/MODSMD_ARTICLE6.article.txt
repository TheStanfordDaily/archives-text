# Rhinoceros Reviewed

### Mark Ciabattri 
The Playhouse Theater at
Beach and Hyde is currently
featuring "Rhinoceros" by Eu
gene lonesco. The playhouse it
self, with its sparse, intimate
seating, complements lonesco's
aim of "putting the audience
on stage."
His audience is randomly
comprised of individuals who
have experienced the psychol
ogical realities of despair,
anxiety, and alienation. Ad
hering to the idea that the psy
chological is reality, lonesco
succeeded in making dramatic
situations projected states of
mind. The play is, in a sense,
a psychological progression
building to a near paroxysm of
intensity and an inconclusive
ending , tragic in that it isolates
two existential states of being
anxiety and alienation.

The play is a tragic farce
and by definition its subject,
the metamorphoses, cannot be
treated solely as parody. This
performance lacked a tragic
element tantamount to the comic
Chaplinesque humor clothed the
nightmare.
The 1938 play, witten in Ru
mania, mirrors lonesco's own
feeling of isolation and grow
ing concern, for many of his
friends were fast becoming vo
taries of Fascism. Although
apolitical, the play illustrates
the contagious effect of fan
aticism.
Fanatics undergo a mental
mutation. "When you no longer
make yourself understood by
them one has the impression of
being confronted bymonstors--
rhinos, for example."
"Rhinoceros"' protagonist,
Berenger, was played by Da
vid Lindeman, who also por
duced the play. He was a help
less witness, as virtually every
other human being, including his
friend Jean, played by Bruce
0. Bishop, and finally even his
girlfriend Daisy, Billie Jo
Burns, succomb to "rhin
oceritis" during the course of
the play's three acts.
David Lindeman's perfor
mance as a caricatured hero,
the last human making a de
fiant stand for humanity, is
equivocal. His is a dual role,
and when the call is for a car
icature who does not know he
is a caricature to convey the
absurdity of defiance con
fronted with immutable iso
lation, humorously demon
strates fear at a world gone
mad. But when the demand is
for a subtle change of mood
and a dissolved caricature, to

make effective the idea of a
meaningless life in a world void
of people or God, the actor is
flat and unconvincing.
Burlesque versions of grace,
beauty and cavoir-faire are re
quired of Dillie Jo Burns, a
too-young actress with an aton
al voice who plays the doting
office girl. Her love for Ber
enger, even as parody, is never
conveyed with the force that
would manifest to Berenger the
effect of her desertion of him
in favor of conformity.
The redeeming factor of the
performance is the other major
role which calls for an on
stage metamorphosis without
costume. Bruce O. Bishop ef
fects this transformation in a
manner surely tantamount to
the New York performance of
Zero Moster. Masterful and
even brilliant at times is his
entire performance as the wit
ty yet somber, duty-bound real
ist Jean.
Of the smaller but impor
tant roles, Doug Johnston por

trays Dudard, the law firm
co-worker of the hero. His
erratic performance, forced at
the start, is more convincing
of Aristotelian logic.
The direction (David Linde
man again) lacks the acceler
ation with condensation and in
tensification of action nec
essary to make the last scene
a brilliant tour de force.
The set, by Ron Hildebrand,
altered somewhat from the
playwright's specifications, is
nevertheless well-done. It
transmits forcefully, by
heightened darkness and nar
rowed space, the progression
from the freedom of the French
town square in Act I to the
claustrophobia of Berenger's
room in Act 111. Also comple
menting this effect is the flaw
less lighting by Dave Altwater.
