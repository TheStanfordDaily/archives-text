# Beach, But No Clothes
## 
### Perry Lee Birchard 
Two and one-half miles north
of San Gregorio Beach, the bay
area is blessed with a beach
unusual to American culture.
Beneath the crumbling cliffs
men, women, and children gat
her to share the delights of sun
bathing and beach play en nu.
The beach is outstanding not
just because of this, but be
cause there is no club or colony
involved.
Unlike some of the European
nudist beaches, no one is really
pressured into taking his
clothes off. But the people who
do undress normally either
cluster together or stay in lit
tle barriers which keep out
both the wind and other people.
The beach, open to the pub
lic (although gawkers are dis
couraged) has been the gather
ing place of nudists from all
walks of life and all sexual
inclinations for almost two
years. Over that period of time
it has undergone a number of
changes.
The land being used is at the
bottom of two private holdings.
One of the property owners
is receptive to the nudists to
the point where he charges
$1.00 admiss' to an access
road.
The other owner is extremely
unhappy with the nudist* pre
sence and has asked police
to enforce no parking or tres
passing regulations on his
property.
Thus, there are only two i
approaches to the beach. One
involves a two and one-half
mile hike over terrain that is
covered during high tide. The
other is the toll road.
The beach itself is aesthe
tically pleasing while most of
the people are not. Sprinkled
on the sand amidst the drift
wood barriers are vaguely ideal
human forms that are a strange
contrast to the waves crashing
on the rocks and the sleek
ships that pass by.
Many of the people who ar
rive on the weekends are re-
SDectable men in their mid
40's and -50's who have large
midriffs to prove it. Many of
their wives have lost their
youthful figures. They could

hardly be called beautiful or
pleasing.
On the weekdays, the lessened
beach population is dominated
by younger beachcombers.
Several groups
begun to harass the hsMp.rs.
One is the motorcyclists ejid
drifters who get vicanp'iS en
joyment out of tearing through
beaches full of unclothed people.
Another group of gawkers
is made up of small plane
pilots. They make a sport of
buzzing the beach at levels
which would make the F.A.A.
turn green.
These sources of harassment
are usually easily dealt with
or ignored. On the other hand,
the recent arrival of the Sex
ual Freedom League is not.
Legally, at least until the
advent of the League, the beach
has stood very well. Habitues
report that the sheriff has vis
ited the beach sans clothing
and has found nothing wrong
Socially, although they run
against the grain of society,
these people tend to be less
rigid and better adjusted to
their environment, according
to Dr. Herbert Casler, a psy
chologist at the City University

of New York. He has found in
studies of nudist colonies that
particularly the children at
these places are markedly less
maladjusted than are "normal"
children. From this, perpet
uation rather than closure of
these beaches seems desirable.
Certainly, nudism can be of
fending, particularly if the nude
involved is not overly beaut
iful. And most people can hardly
be called attractive. But the
nudists at the beach keep to
themselves, and do not wander
onto other beaches to offend
less liberal people.
If there comes a time when
someone tries to close the
beach, one can only observe that
he had to purposefully go to
that beach to be offended.
If you are planning to partake
of this beach's tradition, bring
a date who is not reluctant to
face the world without his or
her mask. And additional ad
vice to the co-eds is don't de
cide to go just before you take
a trip home. Unfortunately, it
is still very difficult to ex
plain to the outsider that you
don't want to sit down because
you've been to the beach.

Gee, Wurlitzer, it's a dad!
Two and one-half miles north
of San Gregorio Beach, the bay
area is blessed with a beach
unusual to American culture.
Beneath the crumbling cliffs
men, women, and children gat
her to share the delights of sun
bathing and beach play en nu.
The beach is outstanding not
just because of this, but be
cause there is no club or colony
involved.
Unlike some of the European
nudist beaches, no one is really
pressured into taking his
clothes off. But the people who
do undress normally either
cluster together or stay in lit
tle barriers which keep out
both the wind and other people.
The beach, open to the pub
lic (although gawkers are dis
couraged) has been the gather
ing place of nudists from all
walks of life and all sexual
inclinations for almost two
years. Over that period of time
it has undergone a number of
changes.
The land being used is at the
bottom of two private holdings.
One of the property owners
is receptive to the nudists to
the point where he charges
$1.00 admiss' to an access
road.
The other owner is extremely
unhappy with the nudist* pre
sence and has asked police
to enforce no parking or tres
passing regulations on his
property.
Thus, there are only two i
approaches to the beach. One
involves a two and one-half
mile hike over terrain that is
covered during high tide. The
other is the toll road.
The beach itself is aesthe
tically pleasing while most of
the people are not. Sprinkled
on the sand amidst the drift
wood barriers are vaguely ideal
human forms that are a strange
contrast to the waves crashing
on the rocks and the sleek
ships that pass by.

someone tries to close the
beach, one can only observe that
he had to purposefully go to
that beach to be offended.
If you are planning to partake
of this beach's tradition, bring
a date who is not reluctant to
face the world without his or
her mask. And additional ad
vice to the co-eds is don't de
cide to go just before you take
a trip home. Unfortunately, it
is still very difficult to ex
plain to the outsider that you
don't want to sit down because
you've been to the beach.


Gee, Wurlitzer, it's a dad!
