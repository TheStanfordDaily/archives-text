Twenty Mexican-American high school juniors will live on
campus for the last four weeksof the summer quarter, starting
a year-long Stanford program designed to entice them into
college ambitions.
Ten Stanford summer quarter undergraduates are now being
sought to live with these students during their one month resi
dence on fraternity row.
This program, the poverty war Upward Bound project,
and the Medical School's Ravenswood commuting program
compose Stanford's effort in the battle to broaden America's
collegiate base. The physics department is concentrating
on Mexican-Americans, by far California's largest ethnic
minority, and traditionally the most aloof from the "Anglo"
educational world.
No other group produces proportionately fewer high
school graduates. Negro undergraduates at Stanford are
relatively few, but still outnumber Mexican-Americans ten
to one. Yet in Santa Clara County, home of both Stanford and
the twenty Physics summer students, Mexican-Americans
outnumber Negroes 14 to 1.
Few from the summer group are likely to become
"Stanford material". They are "underachievers", selected for
these disproportionate abilities and academic production. But
if their four weeks here and forty or so subsequent weeks of
tutoring metamorphize as designed, they will produce respect
able junior year records with which to approach college
admissions officers in the following fall.
Alumni of this program now are registered both at
Hollister Junior College, and at Harvard. So far Stanford has
none
All students are likely to have serious language problems.
All are bi-lingual, most speak Spanish at home. The typical
Mexican-American child first encounters English the day he
enters kindergarten. Except in school, reinforcement of his
English language efforts may be limited. The most direct
academic thrust in the Physics program wij.l be extensive
language tutorials.
