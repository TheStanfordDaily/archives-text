# Higher Tuition Effective Fall '67
## 
### 
Undergraduate tuition will increase from $1575 to $1770
per academic year, starting in the fall of 1967.
Tuition for the Graduate School of Business will advance
from $1710 to $1965 at that time, while Law School rates

will increase from $1575 to
$1875.
President Sterling said the
Stanford increase will permit
the University to continue to
raise faculty and staff salaries.
Through scholarships, loans
and jobs, every effort will be
made to assure that no student
is denied an opportunity to
attend Stanford solely for lack
of funds, he added.
In recent years, he noted,
tuition has covered only about
42 per cent of the University's
operating costs which now ex
ceed $3500 per student per
year. Of the remainder, 27
per cent comes from gifts,
15 per cent comes from en
dowment, 4 per cent from land
development, 13 per cent from
special funds (outside scholar
ships, fees, conferences, etc.),
and other sources.
During the past decade,
student financial aid at Stan
ford has increased dramat
ically, rising from $4G0,000
in 1952 to $5.9 million in 1964-
65. About four out of ten fresh
men receive assistance averag
ing more than $1200 per re
cipient.
Basic costs for a year's study

I at Stanford now total approx
imately $3200 excluding trans
portation to and from the cam
pus. Besides tuition, this fi
gure includes room and board,
books and supplies, laundry and
cleaning, and recreational ex
penses. It does not reflect the
1967 tuition increase.
Stanford levied no formal tu
ition until 1920, when the truste
es approved a $40 quarterly
figure. However, the Univer
sity charged an "incidental fee"
of $15 per quarter from the
day it opened its doors (in 1891)
until that time.
Stanford tuition has been in
creased seven times since
World War II, averaging about
five per cent annually. Rates
are set by the Board of Trust
ees, which reviews tuition every
two years. The present rate
took effect in 1965.
The undergraduate increase
amounts to $65 each for the
autumn, winter, and spring
quarters. Summer quarter tu
ition will be increased, but
will remain substantially be
low the rate for the rest of
the academic year.

imately $3200 excluding trans
portation to and from the cam
pus. Besides tuition, this fi
gure includes room and board,
books and supplies, laundry and

Stanford levied no formal tu
ition until 1920, when the truste
es approved a $40 quarterly
figure. However, the Univer
sity charged an "incidental fee"
of $15 per quarter from the
day it opened its doors (in 1891)
until that time.
Stanford tuition has been in
creased seven times since
World War II, averaging about
five per cent annually. Rates
are set by the Board of Trust
ees, which reviews tuition every
two years. The present rate
took effect in 1965.
The undergraduate increase
amounts to $65 each for the
autumn, winter, and spring
quarters. Summer quarter tu
ition will be increased, but
will remain substantially be
low the rate for the rest of
the academic year.

Undergraduate tuition will increase from $1575 to $1770
per academic year, starting in the fall of 1967.
Tuition for the Graduate School of Business will advance
from $1710 to $1965 at that time, while Law School rates

will increase from $1575 to
$1875.
President Sterling said the
Stanford increase will permit
the University to continue to
raise faculty and staff salaries.
Through scholarships, loans
and jobs, every effort will be
made to assure that no student
is denied an opportunity to
attend Stanford solely for lack
of funds, he added.
In recent years, he noted,
tuition has covered only about
42 per cent of the University's
operating costs which now ex
ceed $3500 per student per
year. Of the remainder, 27
per cent comes from gifts,
15 per cent comes from en
dowment, 4 per cent from land
development, 13 per cent from
special funds (outside scholar
ships, fees, conferences, etc.),
and other sources.
During the past decade,
student financial aid at Stan
ford has increased dramat
ically, rising from $4G0,000
in 1952 to $5.9 million in 1964-
65. About four out of ten fresh
men receive assistance averag
ing more than $1200 per re
cipient.
