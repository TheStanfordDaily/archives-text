# Another SF Visit

The unmistakable and in most
cases unwelcome presence of
Rotary Clubbers from all over
the United States in San Fran
cisco compounded the unbear
ably crowded atmosphere of the
Fourth of July weekend. Rotari
ans were to be seen in any bar
in town, giving impromptu band
"concerts" on several street
corners in the downtown area,
riding en masse in brightly
painted open carts, blasting at
passers-by with their horns,
and pouring helter-skelter into
all San Francisco's landmarks.
A waitress at David's de
licatessan, across the street
from the Curran Theater, told
me with evident relief that few
of the conventioneers had
stopped in there for their
famous highly-priced Kosher
food and pastries.
The Wintersteen Collection
at the Palace of the Legion of
Honor drew quite a crowd and
rightly so; the gallery there
is conspicuously lacking in con
temporary representation, and
this collection is predominately
late nineteenth and twentieth
century. It includes paintings
from Picasso's realist, cubist
and classical periods, an
Andrew Wyeth watercolor, and
samples of Matisse, Roualt,
Toulouse-Lautrec, Degas,
Renoir, Benjamin West, and
several contemporary
American painters. I was drawn
to the gallery primarily by this
collection, but the view from
the Palace is also noteworthy,
as well as the quiet, tastefully
decorated coffee shop in the
basement and Rodin's "The
Thinker" in the front court
yard.
July 3
A beautiful, sunny Sunday.
Drove down to Stern Grove
at Sloat and Nineteenth for the
Lola Montes Dance Concert, one
presentation of the Stern Grove
Midsummer Festival. The
grove provides numerous
sheltered picnic spots, as well
as free concerts on Sunday
afternoons at 2 o'clock. The
stage is built into one corner
of a huge, grassy depression
slightly reminiscent of Frost
Amphitheatre. We came late
and perched precariously on
the hillside, casting envious
glances at the more punctual
members of the audience seated
on benches or blankets spread
on the ground. This is not the
place for dressy clothes, I
found, after ruining a pair of
heels on the muddy trail down
to the concert.
Making the most of the balmy
afternoon, we headed for the
Japanese tea gardens at Golden
Gate Park. These gardens fea
ture Japanese landscaping with
terracing and streams, a minia
ture, man-made waterfall, pa
godas, a rainbow bridge, a
9,000-pound lantern presented
to the United States by the
children of Japan and specified
for placement in San Francisco,
a gift shop with souvenirs and J
Japanese imports, and a tea-'
house designed to give its cus
tomers the fullest benefit of
the scenic gardens.

Stopped in at the Aquarium
in Golden Gate for a quick
look at the alligators, the newly
arrived young dolphin, and the
piranhas, octopi, eels, sharks,
etc. requisite to any well
stocked aquarium.
July 4
Shopped around a little at
Ghirardelli Square, was es
pecially taken with the Tak
ahashi store there. It special
izes in brightly-colored lacquer
and enamel pots and pans,
dishes, rings, bracelets,
earrings, beads from Germany,
crocheted purses, glassware,
jewelry boxes--quite a sel
ection of gifts in modern colors
and designs. It's on the first
floor of the Mustard Building.
Upsairs on the second floor
is a fine coffee house, the
Portofino Caffe, which serves
sandwiches (including the Port
ofino special; Russian bologna,
smoked beef, turkey and Swiss
cheese on a choice of breads,
the best being Siberian Soldier
bread; and the Ghirardelli spec
ial; Italian salami, pepperoni,
ham and Swiss cheese), pastries
and ice cream concoctions, and,
of course, coffee; Mexican,
Brazilian, Cclimbian,
Kona, Mocha-Java, Viennese,
New Orleans, French Roast,
Guatamalan, Peruvian by the
cup or the pound, or in numerous
combinations with steamed
milk, whipped cream, choco
late, spices, and chicory. Ta
bles inside the Portofino are
small and cozy; outside there
is a balcony which overlooks
a courtyard with a fountain
which is illuminated by colored
lights at night.
The Drinking Gourd at 1898
Union is a comfortable little
candelit bar with a casual, young
crowd, red and white checked
tablecloths, hand-painted men
us on the wall, as well as
humorous modern proverbs
(example; "Rationalization is
the secret of happiness") posted
above the bar. Steve Elvin, a
young Bay area artist, displays
his work there, and on Monday
nights there's a Hootenanny.
Anyone is welcome to present
three - song sets from the stage,
and the crowd is usually near
capacity and receptive. Other
nights from 9;30 on the music
is by local folk singers and
folk-rock bands. The Drinking
Gourd was started six years
ago by two Stanford graduates;
it offers imported beer, cheese
and crackers, peanuts, do
mestic and imported wine, and
an atmosphere which beats any
place on North Beach for in
formality.

place on North Beach for in

The unmistakable and in most
cases unwelcome presence of
Rotary Clubbers from all over
the United States in San Fran
cisco compounded the unbear
ably crowded atmosphere of the
Fourth of July weekend. Rotari
ans were to be seen in any bar
in town, giving impromptu band
"concerts" on several street
corners in the downtown area,
riding en masse in brightly
painted open carts, blasting at
passers-by with their horns,
and pouring helter-skelter into
all San Francisco's landmarks.
A waitress at David's de
licatessan, across the street
from the Curran Theater, told
me with evident relief that few
of the conventioneers had
stopped in there for their
famous highly-priced Kosher
food and pastries.
The Wintersteen Collection
at the Palace of the Legion of
Honor drew quite a crowd and
rightly so; the gallery there
is conspicuously lacking in con
temporary representation, and
this collection is predominately
late nineteenth and twentieth
century. It includes paintings
from Picasso's realist, cubist
and classical periods, an
Andrew Wyeth watercolor, and
samples of Matisse, Roualt,
Toulouse-Lautrec, Degas,
Renoir, Benjamin West, and
several contemporary
American painters. I was drawn
to the gallery primarily by this
collection, but the view from
the Palace is also noteworthy,
as well as the quiet, tastefully
decorated coffee shop in the
basement and Rodin's "The
Thinker" in the front court
yard.
July 3
A beautiful, sunny Sunday.
Drove down to Stern Grove
at Sloat and Nineteenth for the
Lola Montes Dance Concert, one
presentation of the Stern Grove
Midsummer Festival. The
grove provides numerous
sheltered picnic spots, as well
as free concerts on Sunday
afternoons at 2 o'clock. The
stage is built into one corner
of a huge, grassy depression
slightly reminiscent of Frost
Amphitheatre. We came late
and perched precariously on
the hillside, casting envious
glances at the more punctual
members of the audience seated
on benches or blankets spread
on the ground. This is not the
place for dressy clothes, I
found, after ruining a pair of
heels on the muddy trail down
to the concert.
Making the most of the balmy
afternoon, we headed for the
Japanese tea gardens at Golden
Gate Park. These gardens fea
ture Japanese landscaping with
terracing and streams, a minia
ture, man-made waterfall, pa
godas, a rainbow bridge, a
9,000-pound lantern presented
to the United States by the
children of Japan and specified
for placement in San Francisco,
a gift shop with souvenirs and J
Japanese imports, and a tea-'
house designed to give its cus
tomers the fullest benefit of
the scenic gardens.

Stopped in at the Aquarium
in Golden Gate for a quick
look at the alligators, the newly
arrived young dolphin, and the
piranhas, octopi, eels, sharks,
etc. requisite to any well
stocked aquarium.
July 4
Shopped around a little at
Ghirardelli Square, was es
pecially taken with the Tak
ahashi store there. It special
izes in brightly-colored lacquer
and enamel pots and pans,
dishes, rings, bracelets,
earrings, beads from Germany,
crocheted purses, glassware,
jewelry boxes--quite a sel
ection of gifts in modern colors
and designs. It's on the first
floor of the Mustard Building.
Upsairs on the second floor
is a fine coffee house, the
Portofino Caffe, which serves
sandwiches (including the Port
ofino special; Russian bologna,
smoked beef, turkey and Swiss
cheese on a choice of breads,
the best being Siberian Soldier
bread; and the Ghirardelli spec
ial; Italian salami, pepperoni,
ham and Swiss cheese), pastries
and ice cream concoctions, and,
of course, coffee; Mexican,
Brazilian, Cclimbian,
Kona, Mocha-Java, Viennese,
New Orleans, French Roast,
Guatamalan, Peruvian by the
cup or the pound, or in numerous
combinations with steamed
milk, whipped cream, choco
late, spices, and chicory. Ta
bles inside the Portofino are
small and cozy; outside there
is a balcony which overlooks
a courtyard with a fountain
which is illuminated by colored
lights at night.
The Drinking Gourd at 1898
Union is a comfortable little
candelit bar with a casual, young
crowd, red and white checked
tablecloths, hand-painted men
us on the wall, as well as
humorous modern proverbs
(example; "Rationalization is
the secret of happiness") posted
above the bar. Steve Elvin, a
young Bay area artist, displays
his work there, and on Monday
nights there's a Hootenanny.
Anyone is welcome to present
three - song sets from the stage,
and the crowd is usually near
capacity and receptive. Other
nights from 9;30 on the music
is by local folk singers and
folk-rock bands. The Drinking
Gourd was started six years
ago by two Stanford graduates;
it offers imported beer, cheese
and crackers, peanuts, do
mestic and imported wine, and
an atmosphere which beats any
place on North Beach for in
formality.

an atmosphere which beats any
place on North Beach for in

The unmistakable and in most
cases unwelcome presence of
Rotary Clubbers from all over
the United States in San Fran
cisco compounded the unbear
ably crowded atmosphere of the
Fourth of July weekend. Rotari
ans were to be seen in any bar
in town, giving impromptu band
"concerts" on several street
corners in the downtown area,
riding en masse in brightly
painted open carts, blasting at
passers-by with their horns,
and pouring helter-skelter into
all San Francisco's landmarks.
A waitress at David's de
licatessan, across the street
from the Curran Theater, told
me with evident relief that few
of the conventioneers had
stopped in there for their
famous highly-priced Kosher
food and pastries.
The Wintersteen Collection
at the Palace of the Legion of
Honor drew quite a crowd and
rightly so; the gallery there
is conspicuously lacking in con
temporary representation, and
this collection is predominately
late nineteenth and twentieth
century. It includes paintings
from Picasso's realist, cubist
and classical periods, an
Andrew Wyeth watercolor, and
samples of Matisse, Roualt,
Toulouse-Lautrec, Degas,
Renoir, Benjamin West, and
several contemporary
American painters. I was drawn
to the gallery primarily by this
collection, but the view from
the Palace is also noteworthy,
as well as the quiet, tastefully
decorated coffee shop in the
basement and Rodin's "The
Thinker" in the front court
yard.
July 3
A beautiful, sunny Sunday.
Drove down to Stern Grove
at Sloat and Nineteenth for the
Lola Montes Dance Concert, one
presentation of the Stern Grove
Midsummer Festival. The
grove provides numerous
sheltered picnic spots, as well
as free concerts on Sunday
afternoons at 2 o'clock. The
stage is built into one corner
of a huge, grassy depression
slightly reminiscent of Frost
Amphitheatre. We came late
and perched precariously on
the hillside, casting envious
glances at the more punctual
members of the audience seated
on benches or blankets spread
on the ground. This is not the
place for dressy clothes, I
found, after ruining a pair of
heels on the muddy trail down
to the concert.
Making the most of the balmy
afternoon, we headed for the
Japanese tea gardens at Golden
Gate Park. These gardens fea
ture Japanese landscaping with
terracing and streams, a minia
ture, man-made waterfall, pa
godas, a rainbow bridge, a
9,000-pound lantern presented
to the United States by the
children of Japan and specified
for placement in San Francisco,
a gift shop with souvenirs and J
Japanese imports, and a tea-'
house designed to give its cus
tomers the fullest benefit of
the scenic gardens.

Stopped in at the Aquarium
in Golden Gate for a quick
look at the alligators, the newly
arrived young dolphin, and the
piranhas, octopi, eels, sharks,
etc. requisite to any well
stocked aquarium.
July 4
Shopped around a little at
Ghirardelli Square, was es
pecially taken with the Tak
ahashi store there. It special
izes in brightly-colored lacquer
and enamel pots and pans,
dishes, rings, bracelets,
earrings, beads from Germany,
crocheted purses, glassware,
jewelry boxes--quite a sel
ection of gifts in modern colors
and designs. It's on the first
floor of the Mustard Building.
Upsairs on the second floor
is a fine coffee house, the
Portofino Caffe, which serves
sandwiches (including the Port
ofino special; Russian bologna,
smoked beef, turkey and Swiss
cheese on a choice of breads,
the best being Siberian Soldier
bread; and the Ghirardelli spec
ial; Italian salami, pepperoni,
ham and Swiss cheese), pastries
and ice cream concoctions, and,
of course, coffee; Mexican,
Brazilian, Cclimbian,
Kona, Mocha-Java, Viennese,
New Orleans, French Roast,
Guatamalan, Peruvian by the
cup or the pound, or in numerous
combinations with steamed
milk, whipped cream, choco
late, spices, and chicory. Ta
bles inside the Portofino are
small and cozy; outside there
is a balcony which overlooks
a courtyard with a fountain
which is illuminated by colored
lights at night.
The Drinking Gourd at 1898
Union is a comfortable little
candelit bar with a casual, young
crowd, red and white checked
tablecloths, hand-painted men
us on the wall, as well as
humorous modern proverbs
(example; "Rationalization is
the secret of happiness") posted
above the bar. Steve Elvin, a
young Bay area artist, displays
his work there, and on Monday
nights there's a Hootenanny.
Anyone is welcome to present
three - song sets from the stage,
and the crowd is usually near
capacity and receptive. Other
nights from 9;30 on the music
is by local folk singers and
folk-rock bands. The Drinking
Gourd was started six years
ago by two Stanford graduates;
it offers imported beer, cheese
and crackers, peanuts, do
mestic and imported wine, and
an atmosphere which beats any
place on North Beach for in
formality.
