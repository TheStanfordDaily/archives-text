# Keating Statement
## 
### Edward Keating 
I wish to personally congratu
late Mr. Sullivan on his victory
in the primary last week. Look
ing ahead to the election in
November, it is my hope that
he will defeat Mr. Younger.
I say this, not merely because
Mr. Younger is a Republican,
but because his record shows
where he stands on the great
issues of the day. My opposition
to Mr. Younger is based pri
marily on issues, not party
affiliations.
The recent primary election
clearly demonstrates that
voters are concerned with
issues oriented candidates.
The political middle is crumbl
ing. On the right is Mr. Reagan
who ran an issues oriented
campaign—issues such as the
University of California, wel
fare, property rights and Mr.
Christopher's difficulties a
number of years ago. He gave
the people a choice and they
responded overwhelmingly.
On the left, there was myself.
Also issues oriented. I spoke
on Vietnam, capital punishment,
napalm, racial prejudice, and
the war on poverty. 47% of
the voters supported my stand
on these vital issues.
Governor Brown, along with
many other Democrats, face
the very real possibility of
defeat this November since they
occupy the political middle from
which no issues emanate.
Democratic candidates are go
ing t*. be forced to look to the
right they will see Mr. Reagan
or the lingering shadow of Mr.
Yorty. If Democratic candidates
move to the right, they will
not only do violence to Dem
ocratic ideals, they will find
the area already occupied by
issues oriented supporters of
Mr. Reagan. In this direction
lies certain defeat.
If Democratic candidates look to
the left, they will find a large
force of voters who will not
only support them at the polls,
but provide a great many work
ers. This way not only means
victory, it also means active
reassertion of Democratic
principles.
We can learn an important les
son from the right, even though
we disagree with them almost
entirely. The successes in this
state of Mr. Goldwater and Mr.
Reagan largely rest on dedi
cated workers.
My strong showing, along with

the strong showing of Mr.
Scheer and Mr. Drath, was
based almost entirely on the
vigorous efforts of dedicated
workers.
why, then, the didicated work
ers on iae right and on the
left? On boih sides of the mid
dle we addressed ourselves to
the issues and we did so with
out equivocation. T.ils political
courage attracted enthusiastic
supporters who worked long and
hard for victory.
The workers on the right were
successful, so much so, that
there is the grave possibility
that the State as a whole will
move significantly to the right,
providing Californians with a
bleak future. Adademic free
dom will be imperiled, racism
will be intensified. Povertypro
| grams will be cancelled as be
!ing equivalent to "welfare give
aways." In short, everything
Democrats traditionally believe
in and work for will be denied
the people of California.
The right gives answers—loud
and clear. Answers, I might
add, that frighten me and I
am sure, millions of other A
mericans.
The middle remains silent or
if not silent, it vainly mumbles
antiquated rhetoric that is to
tally irrelevant to the questions
being asked.
Only the left supplies the
answers that clearly contradict
and replace the false answers
from the right. And the voice
of the left is a strong minority—
and very close to a majority,
I might point out. Therefore
it must be listened to. It has
something very significant to
say.
It says that universal justice
must replace privilege based
on power. If says that racism,
whether subtle or overt, must
go. It says that the war in
Vietnam is both immoral and
illegal. It ways that in the
world's richest nation wide
spread poverty is a scandal.
Finally, it says, to quote Pres
ident Kennedy, that man must
end war or war will end man.
Therefore, Democratic candi
dates, without this state as
well as within, must turn to
the left where they belong if
they are to have any prospect
of victory. But , in a sense,
victory should not be the sole
ahjpctive. There is a larger
issue at stake; it concerns con
srlence.

ing t*. be forced to look to the
right they will see Mr. Reagan
or the lingering shadow of Mr.
Yorty. If Democratic candidates
move to the right, they will
not only do violence to Dem
ocratic ideals, they will find
the area already occupied by
issues oriented supporters of
Mr. Reagan. In this direction
lies certain defeat.
If Democratic candidates look to
the left, they will find a large
force of voters who will not
only support them at the polls,
but provide a great many work
ers. This way not only means
victory, it also means active
reassertion of Democratic
principles.
We can learn an important les
son from the right, even though
we disagree with them almost
entirely. The successes in this
state of Mr. Goldwater and Mr.
Reagan largely rest on dedi
cated workers.
My strong showing, along with

the strong showing of Mr.
Scheer and Mr. Drath, was
based almost entirely on the
vigorous efforts of dedicated
workers.
why, then, the didicated work
ers on iae right and on the
left? On boih sides of the mid
dle we addressed ourselves to
the issues and we did so with
out equivocation. T.ils political
courage attracted enthusiastic
supporters who worked long and
hard for victory.
The workers on the right were
successful, so much so, that
there is the grave possibility
that the State as a whole will
move significantly to the right,
providing Californians with a
bleak future. Adademic free
dom will be imperiled, racism
will be intensified. Povertypro
| grams will be cancelled as be
!ing equivalent to "welfare give
aways." In short, everything
Democrats traditionally believe
in and work for will be denied
the people of California.
The right gives answers—loud
and clear. Answers, I might
add, that frighten me and I
am sure, millions of other A
mericans.
The middle remains silent or
if not silent, it vainly mumbles
antiquated rhetoric that is to
tally irrelevant to the questions
being asked.
Only the left supplies the
answers that clearly contradict
and replace the false answers
from the right. And the voice
of the left is a strong minority—
and very close to a majority,
I might point out. Therefore
it must be listened to. It has
something very significant to
say.
It says that universal justice
must replace privilege based
on power. If says that racism,
whether subtle or overt, must
go. It says that the war in
Vietnam is both immoral and
illegal. It ways that in the
world's richest nation wide
spread poverty is a scandal.
Finally, it says, to quote Pres
ident Kennedy, that man must
end war or war will end man.
Therefore, Democratic candi
dates, without this state as
well as within, must turn to
the left where they belong if
they are to have any prospect
of victory. But , in a sense,
victory should not be the sole
ahjpctive. There is a larger
issue at stake; it concerns con
srlence.
I wish to personally congratu
late Mr. Sullivan on his victory
in the primary last week. Look
ing ahead to the election in
November, it is my hope that
he will defeat Mr. Younger.
I say this, not merely because
Mr. Younger is a Republican,
but because his record shows
where he stands on the great
issues of the day. My opposition
to Mr. Younger is based pri
marily on issues, not party
affiliations.
The recent primary election
clearly demonstrates that
voters are concerned with
issues oriented candidates.
The political middle is crumbl
ing. On the right is Mr. Reagan
who ran an issues oriented
campaign—issues such as the
University of California, wel
fare, property rights and Mr.
Christopher's difficulties a
number of years ago. He gave
the people a choice and they
responded overwhelmingly.
On the left, there was myself.
Also issues oriented. I spoke
on Vietnam, capital punishment,
napalm, racial prejudice, and
the war on poverty. 47% of
the voters supported my stand
on these vital issues.
Governor Brown, along with
many other Democrats, face
the very real possibility of
defeat this November since they
occupy the political middle from

The workers on the right were
successful, so much so, that
there is the grave possibility
that the State as a whole will
move significantly to the right,
providing Californians with a
bleak future. Adademic free
dom will be imperiled, racism
will be intensified. Povertypro
| grams will be cancelled as be
!ing equivalent to "welfare give
aways." In short, everything
Democrats traditionally believe
in and work for will be denied
the people of California.
The right gives answers—loud
and clear. Answers, I might
add, that frighten me and I
am sure, millions of other A
mericans.
The middle remains silent or
if not silent, it vainly mumbles
antiquated rhetoric that is to
tally irrelevant to the questions
being asked.
Only the left supplies the
answers that clearly contradict
and replace the false answers
from the right. And the voice
of the left is a strong minority—
and very close to a majority,
I might point out. Therefore
it must be listened to. It has
something very significant to
say.
It says that universal justice
must replace privilege based
on power. If says that racism,
whether subtle or overt, must
go. It says that the war in
Vietnam is both immoral and
illegal. It ways that in the
world's richest nation wide
spread poverty is a scandal.
Finally, it says, to quote Pres
ident Kennedy, that man must
end war or war will end man.
Therefore, Democratic candi
dates, without this state as
well as within, must turn to
the left where they belong if
they are to have any prospect
of victory. But , in a sense,
victory should not be the sole
ahjpctive. There is a larger
issue at stake; it concerns con
srlence.
