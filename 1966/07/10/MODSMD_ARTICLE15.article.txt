To the editor:
The editorial of Monday June
27th contained several errors
concerning the use ofprogram

med materials in the Econo
mics 1 class at Stanford dur
ing the Summer of 1965. It would
require a very vivid imagin
ation, for instance, to state that
I met strenuous objections from
the students; indeed a number
of students who were not chosen
for the programmed section ex
pressed regret and asked to
1#? placed in this section.
This does not imply that tech
nological innovations will not be
met with resistance by both stu
dents and faculty.
Students did point out that
inequities in grading could arise
if the programmed materials
were unsuccessful or "too suc
cessful" if all students were
graded on the same curve in
the mid-term examination,
fears were alloyed when it was
pointed out that students woald
be graded within their section
this was no compromise, this
was the invention. So much for
the factual errors in the edi
torial; what about bias? The
editor failed to mention that,
on average, the students in the
section using only programmed
materials performed better on
the mid-term examination than
students taught by conventional
methods. (Students in the class
were studying the basic tools
and analysis of microecono
mics-appr oxim ately three
weeks).
Objections to the editoral
such as those stated are mar
ginal and do not warrant this
letter. My principal objective
is to respond to the errone
ous argument which implicitly
underlies this editorial and
most other ill-tempered, ill
informed criticisms of pro
grammed instructions. This ar
gument might be paraphrased
as follows: - Programmed in
struction is simply another de
vice that serves to dehuman
ize the student in our com
puterized, conformist, mass
educational system. It acts to
isolate students from faculty.
It leads to a forced feeding
of a rigid diet of analytic ma
terial. It reduces the probalil
ity that individual needs will
be met in the educational pre
cess. Programmed instruction
is the instrument of the devil."
The idea of beginning students
maintaining such a position is
less unhealthy than reaching
faculty holding such a view
point. Of course, nothing could
be further from the truth.
A programmed test is es
sentially an exposition in which
analysis proceeds by gradual
degrees. Continuous student
participation takes the form of
written responses. In contrast
to the conventional lecture-me
thod of instruction each student,

learning from a programmea
test, can preceed at the pace
most comfortable for his in
dividual capacities. When the
student has completed a para
graph, or frame, he compares
his written response with the
correct responses. The studen 1
can im led.ately see if he is
grasping the material with re
sponses agreeing - the learning
process thus becomes re
inforced - he does not have to
wait several days to have an
assignment returned to check
how well lie is learning, though
even this system of reinforce
ment would have more merit
if students paid more attention
to corrected horn-work assign
ments. On the other hand if
responses do not agree the
student can reread the rele
vant frames until his under
standing is clear. If the stu
dent remains confused the pro
grammed text is badly written.
True, not only does the stu
dent know if he is grasp ; ng

doing not by reading-but the
rate of learning is determined
by the student not by the pro
fessor lecturing to the top two
thirds of the class, and, in
many elementary courses, lec
turing on material contained in
a textbook.
If the student can grasp the
fundamentals and analytical
tools from a programmed text,
and experiments performed so
far substantiate such a posi
tion, the professor can spend
his valuable time much more
efficiently dealing with indivi
dual needs of the students, and
also can cover more material
in a basic course with the re
assurance that the student has
grasped the fundamentals. Pro
gamming is a means whereby
students can have more indivi
dual contact with their profes
sor on a meaningful level, not
less. If one omits the days im
mediately preceeding examin
ations, one observes very few
queues outside the professor's
office. If the students know more

about the subject matter queues
miglit appear. Programming
forces the student to learn at
an early date; there is no ob
vious reason why a student must
know he is learning. In writ
ing responses he doas learn,
whereas in reading a conven
tional text or listening to a
lecture there is no guarantee
he will learn.
Despite the flavor of the edi
torial, students are not the pro
fessor's enemy to be avoided
at all costs. We, who are teach
ing economics, would like to
see students cross the ponsas
see students cross the pons
assinorum of Elementary Econ
omics as soon as possible. I
believe, with considerable em
pirical support, that pro
gramming techniques will go
a considerable way in helping
achieve this goal. V s pro
fessors and regular texi , pro
grams are complements, not
substitutes.

To the editor:
The editorial of Monday June
27th contained several errors
concerning the use ofprogram

med materials in the Econo
mics 1 class at Stanford dur
ing the Summer of 1965. It would
require a very vivid imagin
ation, for instance, to state that
I met strenuous objections from
the students; indeed a number
of students who were not chosen
for the programmed section ex
pressed regret and asked to
1#? placed in this section.
This does not imply that tech
nological innovations will not be
met with resistance by both stu
dents and faculty.
Students did point out that
inequities in grading could arise
if the programmed materials
were unsuccessful or "too suc
cessful" if all students were
graded on the same curve in
the mid-term examination,
fears were alloyed when it was
pointed out that students woald
be graded within their section
this was no compromise, this
was the invention. So much for
the factual errors in the edi
torial; what about bias? The
editor failed to mention that,
on average, the students in the
section using only programmed
materials performed better on
the mid-term examination than
students taught by conventional
methods. (Students in the class
were studying the basic tools
and analysis of microecono
mics-appr oxim ately three
weeks).
Objections to the editoral
such as those stated are mar
ginal and do not warrant this
letter. My principal objective
is to respond to the errone
ous argument which implicitly
underlies this editorial and
most other ill-tempered, ill
informed criticisms of pro
grammed instructions. This ar
gument might be paraphrased
as follows: - Programmed in
struction is simply another de
vice that serves to dehuman
ize the student in our com
puterized, conformist, mass
educational system. It acts to
isolate students from faculty.
It leads to a forced feeding
of a rigid diet of analytic ma
terial. It reduces the probalil
ity that individual needs will
be met in the educational pre
cess. Programmed instruction
is the instrument of the devil."
The idea of beginning students
maintaining such a position is
less unhealthy than reaching
faculty holding such a view
point. Of course, nothing could
be further from the truth.
A programmed test is es
sentially an exposition in which
analysis proceeds by gradual
degrees. Continuous student
participation takes the form of
written responses. In contrast
to the conventional lecture-me
thod of instruction each student,

learning from a programmea
test, can preceed at the pace
most comfortable for his in
dividual capacities. When the
student has completed a para
graph, or frame, he compares
his written response with the
correct responses. The studen 1
can im led.ately see if he is
grasping the material with re
sponses agreeing - the learning
process thus becomes re
inforced - he does not have to
wait several days to have an
assignment returned to check
how well lie is learning, though
even this system of reinforce
ment would have more merit
if students paid more attention
to corrected horn-work assign
ments. On the other hand if
responses do not agree the
student can reread the rele
vant frames until his under
standing is clear. If the stu
dent remains confused the pro
grammed text is badly written.
True, not only does the stu
dent know if he is grasp ; ng

doing not by reading-but the
rate of learning is determined
by the student not by the pro
fessor lecturing to the top two
thirds of the class, and, in
many elementary courses, lec
turing on material contained in
a textbook.
If the student can grasp the
fundamentals and analytical
tools from a programmed text,
and experiments performed so
far substantiate such a posi
tion, the professor can spend
his valuable time much more
efficiently dealing with indivi
dual needs of the students, and
also can cover more material
in a basic course with the re
assurance that the student has
grasped the fundamentals. Pro
gamming is a means whereby
students can have more indivi
dual contact with their profes
sor on a meaningful level, not
less. If one omits the days im
mediately preceeding examin
ations, one observes very few
queues outside the professor's
office. If the students know more

about the subject matter queues
miglit appear. Programming
forces the student to learn at
an early date; there is no ob
vious reason why a student must
know he is learning. In writ
ing responses he doas learn,
whereas in reading a conven
tional text or listening to a
lecture there is no guarantee
he will learn.
Despite the flavor of the edi
torial, students are not the pro
fessor's enemy to be avoided
at all costs. We, who are teach
ing economics, would like to
see students cross the ponsas

To the editor:
The editorial of Monday June
27th contained several errors
concerning the use ofprogram

med materials in the Econo
mics 1 class at Stanford dur
ing the Summer of 1965. It would
require a very vivid imagin
ation, for instance, to state that
I met strenuous objections from
the students; indeed a number
of students who were not chosen
for the programmed section ex
pressed regret and asked to
1#? placed in this section.
This does not imply that tech
nological innovations will not be
met with resistance by both stu
dents and faculty.
Students did point out that
inequities in grading could arise
if the programmed materials
were unsuccessful or "too suc
cessful" if all students were
graded on the same curve in
the mid-term examination,
fears were alloyed when it was
pointed out that students woald
be graded within their section
this was no compromise, this
was the invention. So much for
the factual errors in the edi
torial; what about bias? The
editor failed to mention that,
on average, the students in the
section using only programmed
materials performed better on
the mid-term examination than
students taught by conventional
methods. (Students in the class
were studying the basic tools
and analysis of microecono
mics-appr oxim ately three
weeks).
Objections to the editoral
such as those stated are mar
ginal and do not warrant this
letter. My principal objective
is to respond to the errone
ous argument which implicitly
underlies this editorial and
most other ill-tempered, ill
informed criticisms of pro
grammed instructions. This ar
gument might be paraphrased
as follows: - Programmed in
struction is simply another de
vice that serves to dehuman
ize the student in our com
puterized, conformist, mass
educational system. It acts to
isolate students from faculty.
It leads to a forced feeding
of a rigid diet of analytic ma
terial. It reduces the probalil
ity that individual needs will
be met in the educational pre
cess. Programmed instruction
is the instrument of the devil."
The idea of beginning students
maintaining such a position is
less unhealthy than reaching
faculty holding such a view
point. Of course, nothing could
be further from the truth.
A programmed test is es
sentially an exposition in which
analysis proceeds by gradual
degrees. Continuous student
participation takes the form of
written responses. In contrast
to the conventional lecture-me
thod of instruction each student,

learning from a programmea
test, can preceed at the pace
most comfortable for his in
dividual capacities. When the
student has completed a para
graph, or frame, he compares
his written response with the
correct responses. The studen 1
can im led.ately see if he is
grasping the material with re
sponses agreeing - the learning
process thus becomes re
inforced - he does not have to
wait several days to have an
assignment returned to check
how well lie is learning, though
even this system of reinforce
ment would have more merit
if students paid more attention
to corrected horn-work assign
ments. On the other hand if
responses do not agree the
student can reread the rele
vant frames until his under
standing is clear. If the stu
dent remains confused the pro
grammed text is badly written.
True, not only does the stu
dent know if he is grasp ; ng

doing not by reading-but the
rate of learning is determined
by the student not by the pro
fessor lecturing to the top two
thirds of the class, and, in
many elementary courses, lec
turing on material contained in
a textbook.
If the student can grasp the
fundamentals and analytical
tools from a programmed text,
and experiments performed so
far substantiate such a posi
tion, the professor can spend
his valuable time much more
efficiently dealing with indivi
dual needs of the students, and
also can cover more material
in a basic course with the re
assurance that the student has
grasped the fundamentals. Pro
gamming is a means whereby
students can have more indivi
dual contact with their profes
sor on a meaningful level, not
less. If one omits the days im
mediately preceeding examin
ations, one observes very few
queues outside the professor's
office. If the students know more

about the subject matter queues
miglit appear. Programming
forces the student to learn at
an early date; there is no ob
vious reason why a student must
know he is learning. In writ
ing responses he doas learn,
whereas in reading a conven
tional text or listening to a
lecture there is no guarantee
he will learn.
