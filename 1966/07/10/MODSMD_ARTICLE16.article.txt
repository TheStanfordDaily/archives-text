Three dozen Stanford Univer
sity student volunteers depar
ted San Francisco recently on
a Japan Air Lines jetliner en
route to the Orient to tackle
civilian service projects for
the summer. They are parti
cipating, at their own expense,
in projects in Hong Kong, Ma-

cao, Korea and Vietnam under
the auspices of the new non
profit Stanford based corpora
tion, Volunteers in Asia (VIA).
The volunteers will teach Eng
lish, work with refugee relief
teams and private "peace
corps" groups and in mountain
clinics. VIA is directed by

Dwight Clark, former dean of
freshman men at Stanford. It
is an outgrowth of the World
University Service who has sent
Stanford students to Hong Kong
every summer for the past three
years under the direction of
Clark.
