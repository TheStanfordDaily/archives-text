# Gruber Speaks
## 
### Steve Gruber 
Crank letters.
Sometimes I wonder what
newspaper editors, public of
ficials, and TV personalities
would do without them.
Even the Summer Weekly has
a few crank fans.
I got a letter from one of them
the other day. At the top of the
page was the mimeograph quo
tation, "Nature is cruel--She
brings LIFE into this world
plays with it--and then—with
a smirk—kills it!" Apparently
this crank sends out plenty of
letters and needs a letterhead
so we can recognize his "work."
The letter starts off with a
real attention getter;
"To editor Steve Gruber,
"Yeah boy, but are you a
crud?
"Putting a corner caption
as you did, in your Vol. 150—
#3 that you are ashamed of
yourself--because your mind
is in the gutter. . . When
any Edider (sic), has to lean
over so far and dig so low
as you have, using such a par
agraph—he sould be investi
gated by Congress.
"If you are to REPRESENT
respect and decency, Chum
get with it—and let's have no
further reference to gutter
snipe talk. Showing ones (sic)
ignorance, as most of us do,
at any early age, as you are

doing—is not above repairing;
but the longer you let your
mind lay down there someplace,
it's going to take longer to
get up and stand straight up
again.
"No doubt before you were
born, I'd served in two wars
and learned something about
respect for law & order. Why
dont (sic) you join up and get
someplace besides where you
are?"
The letter was signed "Any-
Mousey," which I imagine is
another way of writing anonym
ous if you can't sppll,
I find this crank's ability
to drag his military service
into his letter interesting. I
think I'll drag my military ser
vice into the argument too-I
joined the Navy Reserve in
September 19G2, am currently
a petty officer third class, and
have an excellent service re
cord. What do you think about
that, crank?
Probably the thing that wor
ries me the most about this
letter is that it was unsigned.
I claim that if you can't write
something that you are willing
to sign your name to, then
don't write it at all.
I suspect that this crank also
sent The Daily a letter about
two months ago. In it were
several pages of an article

on Oliver Twist that he had
torn from a magazine. This
time he wrote, "If you boys
think that you are activists,
then look at what they were do
ing in England, over 300 years
ago." Confusing, to say the
least.
In his most recent letter,
the crank enclosed a copy of
the May, 1962, Faculty Staff
newsletter which featured the
75th anniversary of the laying
of the University's cornerstone.
Across the top he had written,
"The MEN who BUILT Stanford
didn't expect such guys as you
to come along and make mon
keys out of the place."
One observation here; The
men who built Stanford were
Chinese coolies and Italian
stone carvers. They probably
didn't expect anybody to show
up at this Victorian edifice built
so far from civilization.
As a finishing touch, the crank
sent along a reprint form the
Stanford Review of December,
19C4. The article is "SLAC's
Tiny Universe." The crank's
comment is "And these fellows
here—dont (sic) care for your
attitude, either. . ."
Can't please everybody.
If the crank who wrote me the
letter or any other cranks are
reading this, allow me to en
courage you to keep up the
good work.
Perhaps I can even make a
deal with you. If you will
promise to sign your name
next time, I'll publish a really
offensive newspaper to give you
some more material to write
about.

"The MEN who BUILT Stanford
didn't expect such guys as you
to come along and make mon

One observation here; The
men who built Stanford were
Chinese coolies and Italian
stone carvers. They probably
didn't expect anybody to show
up at this Victorian edifice built
so far from civilization.
As a finishing touch, the crank
sent along a reprint form the

Can't please everybody.
If the crank who wrote me the
letter or any other cranks are
reading this, allow me to en
courage you to keep up the
good work.
Perhaps I can even make a
deal with you. If you will
promise to sign your name
next time, I'll publish a really

How does that grab you?
Crank letters.
Sometimes I wonder what
newspaper editors, public of
ficials, and TV personalities
would do without them.
Even the Summer Weekly has
a few crank fans.
I got a letter from one of them
the other day. At the top of the
page was the mimeograph quo
tation, "Nature is cruel--She
brings LIFE into this world
plays with it--and then—with
a smirk—kills it!" Apparently
this crank sends out plenty of
letters and needs a letterhead
so we can recognize his "work."
The letter starts off with a
real attention getter;
"To editor Steve Gruber,
"Yeah boy, but are you a
crud?
"Putting a corner caption
as you did, in your Vol. 150—
#3 that you are ashamed of
yourself--because your mind
is in the gutter. . . When
any Edider (sic), has to lean
over so far and dig so low
as you have, using such a par
agraph—he sould be investi
gated by Congress.
"If you are to REPRESENT
respect and decency, Chum
get with it—and let's have no
further reference to gutter
snipe talk. Showing ones (sic)
ignorance, as most of us do,
at any early age, as you are

doing—is not above repairing;
but the longer you let your
mind lay down there someplace,
it's going to take longer to
get up and stand straight up
again.
"No doubt before you were
born, I'd served in two wars
and learned something about
respect for law & order. Why
dont (sic) you join up and get
someplace besides where you
are?"
The letter was signed "Any-
Mousey," which I imagine is
another way of writing anonym
ous if you can't sppll,
I find this crank's ability
to drag his military service
into his letter interesting. I
think I'll drag my military ser
vice into the argument too-I
joined the Navy Reserve in
September 19G2, am currently
a petty officer third class, and
have an excellent service re
cord. What do you think about
that, crank?
Probably the thing that wor

letter is that it was unsigned.
I claim that if you can't write
something that you are willing
to sign your name to, then
don't write it at all.
I suspect that this crank also
sent The Daily a letter about
two months ago. In it were
several pages of an article

on Oliver Twist that he had
torn from a magazine. This
time he wrote, "If you boys
think that you are activists,
then look at what they were do
ing in England, over 300 years
