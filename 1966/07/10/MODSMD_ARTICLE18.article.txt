phone to the Dean of Students
that "salacious films" were
being shown. The Dean called
the director of the International
Center and the director called
the Center. It was the under
standing of the students present
that the Dean did not want the
films shown, so rather than
cause embarassment to the
leadership of the International
Center, the films were shown
in the part of Tresidder Union
rented to the ASSU.
Now all the events of the
past days are being considered
by President Sterling, who has
not consulted any students for
their views or for any informa
tion.
First, we feel that student
consultation in this event has
been unfortunately at a mini
mum. We feel that in two in
stances administrators acted
solely on their own initiative to,
in effect, censor our activities—
when the signs were taken down
and when the pressure was
applied to stop the showing of
films at the Internation.il
Center. Former member of the
Committee on Public Fxcer
cises has said that what films
are to be shown at the Interna
tional Center is not a decision
to be made by the Dean of

Students.
When decisions were made
in the Committee on Public Ex
cercises, no students were
present. Prior to the first
meeting they were not even
consulted.
Further, the banning of the
film series is, in fact, censor
ship, whether it it done in re
lation to the advertising or to
the individual films. In an Ac
ademic Community, what busi
ness does a committee have
deciding what films ire to be
shown? A logical extension of
such a policy would have the
books on the shelves of the book
store subject to committee
review.
Are students, using student
money, to be allowed to show
films to fellow students, or is
a committee with no student
representation going to make
that decision?
It is the feeling of the Sum
mer Social Committee that we
have been and will remain open
to consultation with the faculty
and iministration on this issue.
So often we are categorized as
"never trusting anybody over
thirty." We would hope that
some people would trust
enough to ask us what our in
tentions and ideas are before
action was taken, and we would
even hope that if President
Sterling has any unresolved
luesiians that .ie "vx-l 1 get in
touch before he makes a deci
sion.
