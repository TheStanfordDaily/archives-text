that "salacious films" were
being shown. The Dean called
the director of the International
Center and the director called
the Center. It was the under
standing of the students present
that the Dean did not want the
films shown, so rather than
cause embarassment to the
leadership of the International
Center, the films were shown
in the part of Tresidder Union
rented to the ASSU.
Now all the events of the
past days are being considered
by President Sterling, who has
not consulted any students for
their views or for any informa
tion.
First, we feel that student
consultation in this event has
been unfortunately at a mini
mum. We feel that in two in
stances administrators acted
solely on their own initiative to,
in effect, censor our activities—
when the signs were taken down
and when the pressure was
applied to stop the showing of
films at the Internation.il
Center. Former member of the
Committee on Public Fxcer
cises has said that what films
are to be shown at the Interna
tional Center is not a decision
to be made by the Dean of

Students.
When decisions were made
in the Committee on Public Ex
cercises, no students were
present. Prior to the first
meeting they were not even
consulted.
Further, the banning of the
film series is, in fact, censor
ship, whether it it done in re
lation to the advertising or to
the individual films. In an Ac
ademic Community, what busi
ness does a committee have
deciding what films ire to be
shown? A logical extension of
such a policy would have the
books on the shelves of the book
store subject to committee
review.
Are students, using student
money, to be allowed to show
films to fellow students, or is
a committee with no student
representation going to make
that decision?
It is the feeling of the Sum
mer Social Committee that we
have been and will remain open
to consultation with the faculty
and iministration on this issue.
So often we are categorized as
"never trusting anybody over
thirty." We would hope that
some people would trust
enough to ask us what our in
tentions and ideas are before
action was taken, and we would
even hope that if President
Sterling has any unresolved
luesiians that .ie "vx-l 1 get in
touch before he makes a deci
sion.
On June 30, members of the
ASSU Summer Social Commit
tee pat up posters advertising
a Summer Film Series of clas
sic American Comedy exper
imental films. Almost as soon
as those posters were put up,
two members of the administra
tion, acting apparently com
pletely on their won initiative,
started taking thern down. On
July first, the Committee of
Public Excerises called a meet
ing to discuss this advertis
ing and the film series.
Although there are student
members of this committee
daring the school year none
are at Stanford this summer;
two have graduated, in fact.
No students were invited to
the meeting to explain the
promotion. In fact, to this point
no attempt had been made to
consult the ASSU or the Summer
Social Committee.
At this meeting, the Com
m'ttee decided to cancel the
series, even though only the
advertising had raised any
questions. Before the posters
had been put up, the Summer
Social Committee had cleared
the presentation of the series
with all necessary authorities,
specifically Dr. Chester A.
Berry, the Director of Tresid
der Union, where the films were
to be shown. It was, and is,
the Social Commi under
standing that usual procedure
for presentation of films at
Tresidder does not directly
involve the Committee on Public
Excercises.
Feeling that the decision of
the Committee was one of
excessive reaction to the ad
vertising, the ASSU decided to
ask the Committe to meet again,

this time with students, to
discuss how the film series,
or a slightly modified one
could be presented at Stanford.
That meeting was held, and the
recommendation of the Com
mitte is now in the hands of
President Sterling, to whom f he
Committee is advisory.
The Social Committee no
tices, in this turn of events,
a certain apparent irregularity
in that the Committe on Public
excercise seemed to feel autho
rized to act on behalf of the
President in banning the film
series, but cannot accept that
authority in deciding whether to
reinstate it. Since the President
has not made a decision to date,
the proceedings of that meeting
are confidential and their re
commendation unknown. The
students were asked to leave the
meeting after making their
proposals for a new series, and
the decision was made without
student members.
Because of the abrupt ban on
the series, several films which
had been ordered arrived with
out a series in which to show
them. Since several students
wanted to see the films, which
in fact was the reason for the
series in the first place, they
were shown, free of charge, to
a group of students on the night
of July 6. One was shown at
the International Center and the
other at the ASSU office by in
vitation of the Student Body
President. About 100 students,
faculty, and staff members at
tended the showing of each film.
While one of the films, "Gold
Diggers of 1933," was being
shown at the International Cen
er, someone complained by
phone to the Dean of Students
that "salacious films" were
being shown. The Dean called
the director of the International
Center and the director called

in that the Committe on Public
excercise seemed to feel autho
rized to act on behalf of the
President in banning the film
series, but cannot accept that
authority in deciding whether to
reinstate it. Since the President
has not made a decision to date,
the proceedings of that meeting
are confidential and their re
commendation unknown. The
students were asked to leave the
meeting after making their
proposals for a new series, and
the decision was made without
student members.
Because of the abrupt ban on
the series, several films which
had been ordered arrived with
out a series in which to show
them. Since several students
wanted to see the films, which
in fact was the reason for the
series in the first place, they
were shown, free of charge, to
a group of students on the night
of July 6. One was shown at
the International Center and the
other at the ASSU office by in
vitation of the Student Body
President. About 100 students,
faculty, and staff members at
tended the showing of each film.
While one of the films, "Gold
Diggers of 1933," was being
shown at the International Cen
er, someone complained by
phone to the Dean of Students
that "salacious films" were
being shown. The Dean called
the director of the International
Center and the director called
the Center. It was the under
standing of the students present
that the Dean did not want the
films shown, so rather than
cause embarassment to the
leadership of the International
Center, the films were shown
in the part of Tresidder Union
rented to the ASSU.
Now all the events of the
past days are being considered
by President Sterling, who has
not consulted any students for
their views or for any informa
tion.
First, we feel that student
consultation in this event has
been unfortunately at a mini
mum. We feel that in two in
stances administrators acted
solely on their own initiative to,
in effect, censor our activities—
when the signs were taken down
and when the pressure was
applied to stop the showing of
films at the Internation.il
Center. Former member of the
Committee on Public Fxcer
cises has said that what films
are to be shown at the Interna
tional Center is not a decision
to be made by the Dean of

Students.
When decisions were made
in the Committee on Public Ex
cercises, no students were
present. Prior to the first
meeting they were not even
consulted.
Further, the banning of the
film series is, in fact, censor
ship, whether it it done in re
lation to the advertising or to
the individual films. In an Ac
ademic Community, what busi
ness does a committee have
deciding what films ire to be
shown? A logical extension of
such a policy would have the
books on the shelves of the book
store subject to committee
review.
Are students, using student
money, to be allowed to show
films to fellow students, or is
a committee with no student
representation going to make
that decision?
It is the feeling of the Sum
mer Social Committee that we
have been and will remain open
to consultation with the faculty
and iministration on this issue.
So often we are categorized as
"never trusting anybody over
thirty." We would hope that
some people would trust
enough to ask us what our in
tentions and ideas are before
action was taken, and we would
even hope that if President
Sterling has any unresolved
luesiians that .ie "vx-l 1 get in

On June 30, members of the
ASSU Summer Social Commit
tee pat up posters advertising
a Summer Film Series of clas
sic American Comedy exper
imental films. Almost as soon
as those posters were put up,
two members of the administra
tion, acting apparently com
pletely on their won initiative,
started taking thern down. On
July first, the Committee of
Public Excerises called a meet
ing to discuss this advertis
ing and the film series.
Although there are student
members of this committee
daring the school year none
are at Stanford this summer;
two have graduated, in fact.
No students were invited to
the meeting to explain the
promotion. In fact, to this point
no attempt had been made to
consult the ASSU or the Summer
Social Committee.
At this meeting, the Com
m'ttee decided to cancel the
series, even though only the
advertising had raised any
questions. Before the posters
had been put up, the Summer
Social Committee had cleared
the presentation of the series
with all necessary authorities,
specifically Dr. Chester A.
Berry, the Director of Tresid
der Union, where the films were
to be shown. It was, and is,
the Social Commi under
standing that usual procedure
for presentation of films at
Tresidder does not directly
involve the Committee on Public
Excercises.
Feeling that the decision of
the Committee was one of
excessive reaction to the ad
vertising, the ASSU decided to
ask the Committe to meet again,

this time with students, to
discuss how the film series,
or a slightly modified one
could be presented at Stanford.
That meeting was held, and the
recommendation of the Com
mitte is now in the hands of
President Sterling, to whom f he
Committee is advisory.

promotion. In fact, to this point
no attempt had been made to
consult the ASSU or the Summer
Social Committee.
At this meeting, the Com
m'ttee decided to cancel the
series, even though only the
advertising had raised any
questions. Before the posters
had been put up, the Summer
Social Committee had cleared
the presentation of the series
with all necessary authorities,
specifically Dr. Chester A.
Berry, the Director of Tresid
der Union, where the films were
to be shown. It was, and is,
the Social Commi under
standing that usual procedure
for presentation of films at
Tresidder does not directly
involve the Committee on Public
Excercises.
Feeling that the decision of
the Committee was one of
excessive reaction to the ad
vertising, the ASSU decided to
ask the Committe to meet again,

this time with students, to
discuss how the film series,
or a slightly modified one
could be presented at Stanford.
That meeting was held, and the
recommendation of the Com
mitte is now in the hands of
President Sterling, to whom f he
Committee is advisory.
The Social Committee no
tices, in this turn of events,
a certain apparent irregularity
in that the Committe on Public
excercise seemed to feel autho
rized to act on behalf of the
President in banning the film
series, but cannot accept that
authority in deciding whether to
reinstate it. Since the President
has not made a decision to date,
the proceedings of that meeting
are confidential and their re
commendation unknown. The
students were asked to leave the
meeting after making their
proposals for a new series, and
the decision was made without
student members.
Because of the abrupt ban on
the series, several films which
had been ordered arrived with
out a series in which to show
them. Since several students
wanted to see the films, which
in fact was the reason for the
series in the first place, they
were shown, free of charge, to
a group of students on the night
of July 6. One was shown at
the International Center and the
other at the ASSU office by in
vitation of the Student Body
President. About 100 students,
faculty, and staff members at
tended the showing of each film.
While one of the films, "Gold
Diggers of 1933," was being
shown at the International Cen
er, someone complained by
phone to the Dean of Students
that "salacious films" were
being shown. The Dean called
the director of the International
Center and the director called
the Center. It was the under
standing of the students present
that the Dean did not want the
films shown, so rather than
cause embarassment to the
leadership of the International
Center, the films were shown
in the part of Tresidder Union
rented to the ASSU.
Now all the events of the
past days are being considered
by President Sterling, who has
not consulted any students for
their views or for any informa
tion.
First, we feel that student
consultation in this event has
been unfortunately at a mini
mum. We feel that in two in
stances administrators acted
solely on their own initiative to,
in effect, censor our activities—
when the signs were taken down
and when the pressure was
applied to stop the showing of
films at the Internation.il
Center. Former member of the
Committee on Public Fxcer
cises has said that what films
are to be shown at the Interna
tional Center is not a decision
to be made by the Dean of

Students.
When decisions were made
in the Committee on Public Ex
cercises, no students were
present. Prior to the first
meeting they were not even
consulted.
Further, the banning of the
film series is, in fact, censor
ship, whether it it done in re
lation to the advertising or to
the individual films. In an Ac
ademic Community, what busi
ness does a committee have
deciding what films ire to be
shown? A logical extension of
such a policy would have the
books on the shelves of the book
store subject to committee
review.
Are students, using student
money, to be allowed to show
films to fellow students, or is
a committee with no student
representation going to make
that decision?
It is the feeling of the Sum
mer Social Committee that we
have been and will remain open
to consultation with the faculty
and iministration on this issue.
So often we are categorized as
"never trusting anybody over
thirty." We would hope that
some people would trust
enough to ask us what our in
tentions and ideas are before
action was taken, and we would
even hope that if President
Sterling has any unresolved
luesiians that .ie "vx-l 1 get in
touch before he makes a deci
sion.
On June 30, members of the
ASSU Summer Social Commit
tee pat up posters advertising
a Summer Film Series of clas

as those posters were put up,
two members of the administra

pletely on their won initiative,
started taking thern down. On
July first, the Committee of
Public Excerises called a meet

are at Stanford this summer;
