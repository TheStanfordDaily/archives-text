probably too long to print)the

the FDA hasn't thought of this
yet?
The loss of the more whole
some San Jose market, forcing
users to go to Berkeley sup
pliers, is surely lamentable.
But the blame for this is wron
ly placed: to be specific, on
mass media, the Establishment,
and bureaucracies. The most
obvious culprit, though, is sure
ly the Berkeley supplier, who
probably blew the whistle on
his friendly competitor across
the Bay. If the Justice Dapart
ment were aware of this type
of competition, its anti-trust
division would certainly like to
get the trade legalized so it
could get in on the act, too.
Add one more bureaucracy to
the side of legalization.
As far as threats to the
Establishment go, the writer is
correct. As she says,"the
truth about the use and poten
tial uses of marijuana and LSD
(like drug addiction and alcohol
ism therapy using LSD and
DMSO) would threaten the pre
sent order," particularly Es
tablishments like Synanon (see
page one story last week) and
Alcoholics Anonymous.
A couple of serious comments
are in order. The article errs
in logic in claiming legalized
indiscriminate use of these
drugs as a condition for fur
ther progress in research into
positive uses of the drugs--
treatment of psychiatric prob
elms, of alcoholism, etc. Such
uses are not going to be dis
covered in "trip pads" in S.F.
or Palo Alto.
Secondly, the problem of re
gulation of LSD invites discus
sion of the basic questions of
public policy behind regulation
of any drugs--in this case,
two rationales for prohibition
of use of drugs are inbolved:
the full consequences to public
health of use of the particular
drug is not known (Poet Gins
burg is not a medical expert);
and there are claimed effects
of the drug harmful to society.
Arguments on these points
would be approptiate, but, of
course, being less sensational,
make it harder to sell Stan
ford Weeklys.
