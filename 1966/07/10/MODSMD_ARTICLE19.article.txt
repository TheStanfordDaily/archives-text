To the editor:
It was a revelation to read
comment, "Notes from the Un
derground," in last week's
Weekly, and have exposed there
the interests in society that
are keeping marijuana and LSD
on the black market, to the
detriment of the user of these
drugs.
The article makes interesting
use of the traditional economic
self-interest analysis of human
motivation in explaining why
various interests want these
drugs kept illegal—magazines
(more sensational stories),
bureaucracies (what would they
do without it?) and the Estab
lishment (basic survival). In my
opinion the article did not go
far enough in examining pos
sible application of the con
spiracy theory to the collusion
behind all of these seemingly
independent actions, but worse,
it did not expose alloftheecon
mic self-interests that are the
real culprits here.

The black market m.rnu
facturers should be primary
suspects in wanting the stuff
kept only on the black market.
If these drugs went legit, these
manufacturers could not hope
to compete with the McKesson-
Fobbins and Smith, Kline &
French labs, marketing through
the local Rexall Drugstore.
Furthermore, they could not
possibly get past the FDA, which
would have jursidiction over any
legal production of marijuana
and LSD.
Indeed, this point raises the
question of which side the bur
eaucracies are really on. The
FDA, certainly, would like to
get its regulatory fingers into
the potentially large flow of
legalized marijuana and LSD,
and thereby qualify for more
funds. If there are other
agencies that survive only be
cause these drugs are illegal
(a list of these agencies is
probably too long to print)the
more powerful FDAcouldover

cedence. Is it possible that

As far as threats to the
Establishment go, the writer is
correct. As she says,"the

tial uses of marijuana and LSD

ism therapy using LSD and
DMSO) would threaten the pre

tablishments like Synanon (see
page one story last week) and
Alcoholics Anonymous.
A couple of serious comments
are in order. The article errs
in logic in claiming legalized
indiscriminate use of these
drugs as a condition for fur
ther progress in research into
positive uses of the drugs--
treatment of psychiatric prob
elms, of alcoholism, etc. Such
uses are not going to be dis
covered in "trip pads" in S.F.
or Palo Alto.
Secondly, the problem of re
gulation of LSD invites discus
sion of the basic questions of
public policy behind regulation
of any drugs--in this case,
two rationales for prohibition
of use of drugs are inbolved:
the full consequences to public
health of use of the particular
drug is not known (Poet Gins
burg is not a medical expert);
and there are claimed effects
of the drug harmful to society.
Arguments on these points
would be approptiate, but, of

To the editor:
It was a revelation to read
comment, "Notes from the Un
derground," in last week's
Weekly, and have exposed there
the interests in society that
are keeping marijuana and LSD
on the black market, to the
detriment of the user of these
drugs.
The article makes interesting
use of the traditional economic
self-interest analysis of human
motivation in explaining why
various interests want these
drugs kept illegal—magazines
(more sensational stories),
bureaucracies (what would they
do without it?) and the Estab
lishment (basic survival). In my
opinion the article did not go
far enough in examining pos
sible application of the con
spiracy theory to the collusion
behind all of these seemingly
independent actions, but worse,
it did not expose alloftheecon
mic self-interests that are the
real culprits here.

The black market m.rnu
facturers should be primary
suspects in wanting the stuff
kept only on the black market.
If these drugs went legit, these
manufacturers could not hope
to compete with the McKesson-
Fobbins and Smith, Kline &
French labs, marketing through
the local Rexall Drugstore.
Furthermore, they could not
possibly get past the FDA, which
would have jursidiction over any
legal production of marijuana
and LSD.
Indeed, this point raises the
question of which side the bur
eaucracies are really on. The
FDA, certainly, would like to
get its regulatory fingers into

legalized marijuana and LSD,

funds. If there are other
