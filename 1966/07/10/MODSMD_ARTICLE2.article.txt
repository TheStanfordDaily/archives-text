# University Halts ASSU Film Series
## 
### Steve Gruber 
In spite of a University ruling
prohibiting the ASSU film ser
ies, the legislature voted Fri
day to show two of the films
next week.
"Chumps at Oxford," and
"Scorpio Rising" will be shown
at the Nitery at 8 PM July 18.
On July 1, the Committee
on Public Exercises unani
mously cancelled the showing
of the proposed film series.
The Committee objected to the
nature of the films and the pos
ters used to advertise the ser
ies.
Weber said the committee
would not permit showing of the
series "in whole or in part on
campus this summer."
Weber could not be contacted
concerning the ASSU decision
because he left for a month
long vacation last week.
However, last Wednesday two
films, "Gold Diggers of 1933"
and "Flaming Creatures" were
shown to over 100 students,
faculty, and staff members in
the ASSU offices.
According to a statement by
the Summer Social Committee,
"While one of the films, "Gold
Diggers of 1933," was being
shown at the International Cen
ter, someone comolained by
phone to the Dean of Students
(H. Donald Winbigler) that "Sal
acious films" were being
shown. The Dean called the
director of the International
Center and the director called
the Center."
Student Body President David
Harris then invited the audience
of "Gold Diggers" to come to
a newly-created seminar on
pornography to be led by Pro
fessor Bruce Franklin at the
ASSU office. During the semi
nar, Franklin used "Flaming
Creatures" as an example of
pornography.
The Committee on Public Ex
ercises allegedly made a new
film series recommendation
Thursday and sent it to presi
dent Sterling for his approval.
Sterling is expected to make
his lecision today, according
to Professor Mark Franklin,
acting head of the Committee
on Public Exercises.
The legislature resolution
was passed 5 to 1, with one
abstention. Discussion centered
around the $115 lost on the
first two films of the series
because admission was not
charged. The films planned for
July 18 will cost $62 and are
expected to pay for themselves.
One of the legislature mem
bers pointed out that "Scorpio
Rising" had been shown on
campus before as part of a
film series in the Physics Tank.
One of the movies scheduled
in the original series was "Un
Chant d'Amour", ruled obscene
by the Superior Court of Ala
meda County on March 31. The
verdict is being appealed.
Informed sources say that
the Santa Clara County Dis
trict Attorney will arrest ASSU
officers if "Un Chant d'Amour"
is shown at Stanford.

the Center."
Student Body President David
Harris then invited the audience
of "Gold Diggers" to come to
a newly-created seminar on
pornography to be led by Pro
fessor Bruce Franklin at the
ASSU office. During the semi
nar, Franklin used "Flaming
Creatures" as an example of
pornography.
The Committee on Public Ex
ercises allegedly made a new
film series recommendation
Thursday and sent it to presi
dent Sterling for his approval.
Sterling is expected to make
his lecision today, according
to Professor Mark Franklin,
acting head of the Committee
on Public Exercises.
The legislature resolution
was passed 5 to 1, with one
abstention. Discussion centered
around the $115 lost on the
first two films of the series
because admission was not
charged. The films planned for
July 18 will cost $62 and are
expected to pay for themselves.
One of the legislature mem
bers pointed out that "Scorpio
Rising" had been shown on
campus before as part of a
film series in the Physics Tank.
One of the movies scheduled
in the original series was "Un
Chant d'Amour", ruled obscene
by the Superior Court of Ala
meda County on March 31. The
verdict is being appealed.
Informed sources say that
the Santa Clara County Dis
trict Attorney will arrest ASSU
officers if "Un Chant d'Amour"
is shown at Stanford.
In spite of a University ruling
prohibiting the ASSU film ser
ies, the legislature voted Fri
day to show two of the films
next week.
"Chumps at Oxford," and
"Scorpio Rising" will be shown
at the Nitery at 8 PM July 18.
On July 1, the Committee
on Public Exercises unani
mously cancelled the showing
of the proposed film series.
The Committee objected to the
nature of the films and the pos
ters used to advertise the ser
ies.
Weber said the committee
would not permit showing of the
series "in whole or in part on
campus this summer."
Weber could not be contacted
concerning the ASSU decision
because he left for a month
long vacation last week.
However, last Wednesday two
films, "Gold Diggers of 1933"
and "Flaming Creatures" were
shown to over 100 students,
faculty, and staff members in
the ASSU offices.
According to a statement by
the Summer Social Committee,
"While one of the films, "Gold
Diggers of 1933," was being
shown at the International Cen
ter, someone comolained by
phone to the Dean of Students
(H. Donald Winbigler) that "Sal
acious films" were being
shown. The Dean called the
director of the International
Center and the director called
the Center."
