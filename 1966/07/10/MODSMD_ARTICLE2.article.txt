# University Halts ASSU Film Series
## 
### Steve Gruber 
In spite of a University ruling
prohibiting the ASSU film ser
ies, the legislature voted Fri
day to show two of the films
next week.
"Chumps at Oxford," and
"Scorpio Rising" will be shown
at the Nitery at 8 PM July 18.
On July 1, the Committee
on Public Exercises unani
mously cancelled the showing
of the proposed film series.
The Committee objected to the
nature of the films and the pos
ters used to advertise the ser
ies.
Weber said the committee
would not permit showing of the
series "in whole or in part on
campus this summer."
Weber could not be contacted
concerning the ASSU decision
because he left for a month
long vacation last week.
