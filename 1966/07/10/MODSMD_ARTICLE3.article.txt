# Observer To Attempt Undistorted Picture
##

"New Monthly Newspaper
Will Tell Story of Stanford in
Diversity, Depth," says the bold
headline on the front page of
Stanford's latest literary ven
ture—The Stanford Observer.
Published last month for the
first time by the University's
News and Publications Service,
The Stanford Observer as
clearly stated in the introduct
ory article is designed "to con
vey an undistorted picture of
Stanford to the People most
interested in knowing what goes
on here and why."
Depending on reader re
sponse to the first eight-page
issue and also on the avail
ability of funds to finance the
newspaper, "The Observer" is
expected to have a circulation
of nearly 100,000 among Sta
nford alumni, students parents,
faculty, and friends (all of wnom
received a free copy of the
pilot edition).
The Observer needs the ap
proval of tne Board of Trus
tees and foundation funds must
be found before it can begin
publishing on a regular month
ly basis from September to
June.
The originator of the idea
for the new publication was Ro
bert Pierce, head of the Alum
ni Association. He saw The Ob
server as a mean of improv
ing relations between the Uni

versity and alumni.
Observer Editor Harry
Press, former city editor of
the San Francisco News-Call-
Bulletin, and a Neiman Fel
low says there will be no edi
torializing in The Observer,
just "an honest and complete
report of what is going on
in the university community."
Press was quick to deny that
the Stanford Daily's approach
has been objectionable or too
"liberal" for the tastes of Stan
ford alumni. "The Daily," he
said, "because it is a student
newspaper, necessarily has a
student approach."
"They give limited treatment
to topics such as President
Sterling's recent aid-to-cor
porate-education speech which
alumni would like to hear more
about, " Press concluded.
The staff of the Observer will
not include students, and the
main source of its informs -
tion will be the Stanford N°ws
Service.
Although the Stanford News
Service sends out more than
1000 stories per year to local
and national papers, the re
cipients frequently do not print
all this news, or print it in
the same form as it is re
ceived.
An example of an unfortunate
distortion of news, according
to Press, was the recent S.F.
Chronicle article on Dave Har
ris. He called it "inaccurate"
and "slanted."

To enlighten all those inter
ested in Stanford's new stu
dent body president, Press as
signed Dan Endsley, editor of
the Stanford Review and the
Alumni Almanac, to do a spec
ial feature story on Harris
which appeared in last month's
issue. In addition, there was
a special two-page center
spread on student activism at
Stanford.
The Stanford Observer, ac
cording to Press, is designed
neither to compete with the
Stanford Daily nor to replace
Stanford Today, the Univer
sity's quarterly."
