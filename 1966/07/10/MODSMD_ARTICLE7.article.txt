# Workshop Trouble
## 
### 
Shock tactics are necessary
for the realization that Los
Angeles, a young, opulent giant,
might in the near future eclipse
the cultural attributes of San
Francisco.
The Actor's Workshop, a non
profit, professional resident
theater, was issued an ultima
tum on June 30. If $159,000,
one half in funds and the other
in pledges, is not raised by
July 15th and thereafter guar
anteed annually, the group and
its literal thousands of Bay
area supporters, will witness
its demise.
The Ford Fundation and the
Rockefeller Institute
have agreed to contribute but
only if corporations indigenous
to the community match their
aid. The Workshop was a for
mer recipient of a Ford Grant
for excellence in theatrical
achievement.
At present, the Workshop,
with its brilliant young direc
tors, Ken Kitch and John Han
cock, imbues the potential for
even greater heights. Play
wright Tennessee Williams
speaks highly of Artistic Dir

ector Hancock; "Working with
John Hancock on 'Milk Train'
was an exciting and happy ex
perience. He has a bold or
iginality, a plastic sense of
theatre that I haven't seen since
the Berliner Ensemble of
Brecht." Hancock will remain
with the Workshop if sufficient
funds are raised to meet its
functioning budget.
prospective presentations
for the Workshop's coming sea
son (October 12 through April
29) would be Chekhov's "The
Seagull," Miller's "Death of
a Salesman," Ibsen's "The Wild
Duck," Brecht's "St. Joan of
the Stockyards," and Peter
Weiss "Marat/De Sade."
