# Creative Camp

Grade school is out for the summer, but sixteen child
ren, five to seven years old, eagerly participate in a Crea
tive Thinking Day Camp run under the auspices of Stan
ford's psychology department. The location; Bing Nursery
School, on Escondido Road.
The children look a bit out of place on the Lilliputian
furniture, designed for two and three year-olds (the school's
usual clientele), but any physical discomfort is more than
compensated for by the minimal restrictions imposed on
each child's movements.
"So often," says Mrs. Miriam Lidster, the Camp's dir
ectress, "children are told 'don't or be careful.'" Under
careful supervision, the children are allowed to play freely
and spontaneously; they are forbidden only to do anything
that would endanger them physically.
Monday through Thursday, they come for three hours of
afternoon exploring— via a "magic carpet" of imagination.
Foreign lands, chosen by the children themselves, are the
subjects of these free-wheeling quests for adventure.
Last week's topic was Mexico, and the first day's session
began with a story about that country, to which the child
ren responded with appropriate movements and sounds. Af
ter this, the music and dance of Mexico were demonstrated
and then acted out, to the delight of the young participants.
After a bit of singing led by Miss Judy Johnson (who holds
a Stanfore M.A.), the children went outdoors for another
experience—paint blowing. Painting with a brush has been
ancient history since Jackson Pollack gave all of his away,
so Bernardo Pedere, a teacher from the Philippines, intro
duced his willing cherubs to this new mode of artistic ex
pression, in which one spatters a few drops of watercolor
on paper, leans Uown, and blows the paint over the surface
in all sorts of esthetically significant directions...(the floor,
one's shirt and face, etc. etc.)
But the kids love it, even if their mothers don't. They
went far beyond Mr. Pedere's prefatory suggestions that
they make representations of Fourth of July fireworks; many
individualistic patterns emerged, some of them highly imagin
ative.
The purpose of this camp is not to train future Rembrandts,
(although some of the children appear to have artistic talent),
but to help them find new interests. It is emphasized to the
children that no one way exists to do anything; they are
encouraged to find their own solutions, in artistic expres
sion, and as a carryover—in life.
The camp was founded on the premise it is absurd for a
child to stop learning and growing intellectually merely be
cause school is not in session. "Children are naturally crea
tive, rhythmic and inventive," according to Mrs. Lidster.
The Creative Thinking Day Camp gives them an opportunity
to develop these native urges, that they might become more
productive adults.
