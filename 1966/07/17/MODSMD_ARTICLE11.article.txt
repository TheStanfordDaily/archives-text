# Festival:
## Gelber Termed Boring and Oppressive 
### David Denby 
The young Brazilian pianist Bruno-Leonardo Gelber made
his American debut at Memorial Auditorium on July 9in a
Summer Festival event. It is embarrassing to report, in
view of the reception that Mr. Gelber has received in Europe,
that he played badly almost the entire evening.
The poor quality was not simply a ma!ter of interpreta
tions that did not jell; it was a matter of melodic lines
that lacked clarity and shape, of sudden melodramatic shifts
in emphasis and tempo, of garbled scale passages and great
rumbles of sound in the bass line. At first I thought I was
sitting too close so I moved back, but it made no difference:
Mr. Gelber's tone was hard, percussive and unpleasant no
matter where you sat, and he gave his Steinway as complete
a pounding as any piano has received in a single recital.
Only one piece, Debussy's "La Fille auxCheveuxde Lin,"
emerged with the necessary clarity of articulation to make
its effect. Beethoven's great Sonata No. 26, "Les Adieux,"
which opened the very ambitious program, was given a
tense, driving performance, capped by an ungainly rush of
sound in the coda of the finale, that imposed a mood of
unwarranted urgency on the piece; after all, this sonata is
not the "Appassionata." Schumann's "Carnaval" lacked grace
and ease; its gorgeous melodies sounded as if they were
being held by the neck.
Chopin's Sonata in B minor, Op. 58, went better, perhaps
because its turbulent heroism is more suited to Mr. Gelber's
disposition. But again the many moments of relentless ham
mering made for a performance that was, on the whole,
boring and oppressive.
