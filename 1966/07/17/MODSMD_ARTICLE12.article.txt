# Dylan- Six Months At City Theater
## 
### Janie Dotson Mark Ciabattari 
Actor-director Jack Aranson
is currently appearing as Welsh
poet Dylan Thomas in Sidney
Michaels' Dylan now in its sixth
month at the City Theater in
San Francisco. In a recent in
terview Aranson moved com
fortably around in his cluttered
dressing room - office, inter
rupting only to fetch ashtrays
and answer the telephone. He
wore a white shirt open at the
neck, a wide tie decorated with
a crescent design, and his
trousers hung precariously
from his hips. His dark hair
looked as if it had been combed
with his fingers, and his com
plexion was ruddy. In short, he
looked like Dylan Thomas.
Aranson settled back in his
chair to answer serious ques
tions about drams, delivering
without condescension beauti
fully-phrased and intoned com
ments on the theater and then,
changing tone and expression,
sat forward to answer lighter
questions, displaying at the
same time a captivating person
al wit and a sharp, thorough
grasp of his "craft and sullen
art" which is evident in the
following excerpts from the in
terview:
Art Forms
Q. I've heard it said that
the technical qualities of one
art form can be transferred to
another. Do you agree?
A. An artist is concerned
with finding the shape of what
he is doing. The arts are re
lated, of course, and in each
form one finds rhythm, tone,
balance, and shape. They come
together in the theater: it is
the tempo of the arts.
Q. You have both directed
and acted in plays. Have you
ever tried writing one?
A. No, I haven't except some
things for class when I was
studying acting. I think the hard
est thing in the world is to
write a play.
Director - Conductor
Q. A director is sometimes
compared to a conductor in his
need to avoid domination of one
particular aspect of the pro
duction. In directing a play
have you ever felt this?
A. Any good play has a bal
ance of soprano, tenor, bass,
baritone, alto, like in music.
The orchestration is important.
That's what I find to be so
great bout Shaw, his orchestra
tion.
Q. Do you have any particular
method of acting? Must you
feel an emotion when you ex
press it on stage?
A. I try to be detached and
relaxed. This is something I

was taught when I studied act
ing and I have come to realize
its importance. One should
strive to express intensity but
not tenseness. If something
feels too real it ceases to be
theatrically real. I don't be
lieve in the method of acting
only what one has experienced;
I find imagination to be es
sential. I could play the part of
a murderer without committing
the crime.
Q. Dylan is a realistic play.
Is realism the pervading mode
of the theater today?
Off - Beat
A. Today there is a tendency
for the off-beat. The off - beat,
the avant-grade, have never
really had the depth I wanted.
I have done a play by Brecht,
"St. Joan of the Stockyards."
What appealed to me about a
big play by Brecht is that it
was so big, nearly Homeric.
There is not much room for
characterization, no time to
develop a scene or a charac
ter. I was mainly concerned
with the sweep of Brecht's
thought.
Q. What do you think of
dramatists who use the stage
as a forum for their social
views?

A. Theater today is going
in a social -conscious direc
tion, and getting away from
art. Any great play has social
significance—Shakespeare did,
but he had human things, too.
A social play is limiting; it
has no depth.
What Survives?
Q. Plays based on an idea
rather than a personality seem
to survive the years best. Do
you think Michaels saw Dylan
merely as a play about the
last few years of a great poet's
life?
A. For Michaels Dylan Thom
as is the idea. Michaels has
a good feeling for words and
the stage. I hope the play will
have lasting appeal.

Q. Do you think Dylan is a
tragedy, despite its predomin
ance of the comic?
A. No, it has to be clas
sified as a chronicle play. It's
tragic insofar that Dylan died
young. One must fight against
the tragedy through the comedy.
In Romeo and Juliet, for in
stance, there was much com
edy—in the balcony scene, in
their young love. Shakespeare
let the tragedy take care of it
self, and that is what we must
do with Dylan. Comedy is essen
tial to the play because it is so
long and unrelenting. Besides,
there was much comedy in Dylan
Thomas. He used to imperson
ate Harpo Marx when he was
a young man. He resembled
Marx, with a mop of golden
curls. There is also a great
similarity between Dylan and
Charlie Chaplin. Both were
poets of movement and ex
pression. In fact, that's a good
descriptive word for Michael's
play—Chaplinesque.
Tragedy?
Q. Couldn't it be a tragedy
in the Oedipal sense, with Dy
lan a man driven by fate?
A. Dylan used to go around
talking of his fate, but in a
romantic sort of way. He com
pared himself to other poets
who died young— Shelley, Keats,
Rimbaud. He didn't have to die
in New York. His death resulted
from a combination of drink
and drugs he was taking for his
health. He didn't actually drink
himself to death in the White
Horse Tavern as was implied
in the last scene. He didn't
drink eighteen straight whis
keys, as he claimed, more like
ly it was four or five. But it
wasn't this that killed him,
Dylan died of pneumonia. Any
man that gets away from his
roots, that is what destroys
him.
Religious Significance
Q. You me Uioned the scene
in the White Horse Tavern.
Did Dylan's action of pyramid
ing the whiskey glasses have
religious significa. V- p.
A. Dylan was Tjious
man, but not in hied
,n J °

sense, although I believe he was
a conscientious objector. He
was socialistically inclined.
Besides, I couldn't imagine Dy
lan in uniform! The pyramid
of glasses had reference to the
pyramids and the Bible. But
by too much delving into sym
bolism one runs the danger
of losing the essence of the
magic.
Hand-picked
Q. Judging on the enthusiasm
and fine quality of your perfor
mance as Dylan, I would guess
that this was a play you hand
picked.
A. We chose Dylan because it
had never played on the West
Coast, and I had been considered
for the role in the road show
from New York. The show didn't
go on the road and I was given
the rights out here. And we did
have a feeling for it! We do
plays of the heart and humanity
and poetry, and that is the
sort of play Dylan is.

only what one has experienced;
I find imagination to be es
sential. I could play the part of
a murderer without committing
the crime.
Q. Dylan is a realistic play.
Is realism the pervading mode
of the theater today?
Off - Beat
A. Today there is a tendency
for the off-beat. The off - beat,
the avant-grade, have never
really had the depth I wanted.
I have done a play by Brecht,
"St. Joan of the Stockyards."
What appealed to me about a
big play by Brecht is that it
was so big, nearly Homeric.
There is not much room for
characterization, no time to
develop a scene or a charac
ter. I was mainly concerned
with the sweep of Brecht's
thought.
Q. What do you think of
dramatists who use the stage
as a forum for their social
views?

A. Theater today is going
in a social -conscious direc
tion, and getting away from
art. Any great play has social
significance—Shakespeare did,
but he had human things, too.
A social play is limiting; it
has no depth.
What Survives?
Q. Plays based on an idea
rather than a personality seem
to survive the years best. Do
you think Michaels saw Dylan
merely as a play about the
last few years of a great poet's
life?
A. For Michaels Dylan Thom
as is the idea. Michaels has
a good feeling for words and
the stage. I hope the play will
have lasting appeal.

Q. Do you think Dylan is a
tragedy, despite its predomin
ance of the comic?
A. No, it has to be clas
sified as a chronicle play. It's
tragic insofar that Dylan died
young. One must fight against
the tragedy through the comedy.
In Romeo and Juliet, for in
stance, there was much com
edy—in the balcony scene, in
their young love. Shakespeare
let the tragedy take care of it
self, and that is what we must
do with Dylan. Comedy is essen
tial to the play because it is so
long and unrelenting. Besides,
there was much comedy in Dylan
Thomas. He used to imperson
ate Harpo Marx when he was
a young man. He resembled
Marx, with a mop of golden
curls. There is also a great
similarity between Dylan and
Charlie Chaplin. Both were
poets of movement and ex
pression. In fact, that's a good
descriptive word for Michael's
play—Chaplinesque.
Tragedy?
Q. Couldn't it be a tragedy
in the Oedipal sense, with Dy
lan a man driven by fate?
A. Dylan used to go around
talking of his fate, but in a
romantic sort of way. He com
pared himself to other poets
who died young— Shelley, Keats,
Rimbaud. He didn't have to die
in New York. His death resulted
from a combination of drink
and drugs he was taking for his
health. He didn't actually drink
himself to death in the White
Horse Tavern as was implied
in the last scene. He didn't
drink eighteen straight whis
keys, as he claimed, more like
ly it was four or five. But it
wasn't this that killed him,
Dylan died of pneumonia. Any
man that gets away from his
roots, that is what destroys
him.
Religious Significance
Q. You me Uioned the scene
in the White Horse Tavern.
Did Dylan's action of pyramid
ing the whiskey glasses have
religious significa. V- p.
A. Dylan was Tjious
man, but not in hied
,n J °

sense, although I believe he was
a conscientious objector. He
was socialistically inclined.
Besides, I couldn't imagine Dy
lan in uniform! The pyramid
of glasses had reference to the
pyramids and the Bible. But
by too much delving into sym
bolism one runs the danger
of losing the essence of the
magic.
Hand-picked
Q. Judging on the enthusiasm
and fine quality of your perfor
mance as Dylan, I would guess
that this was a play you hand
picked.
A. We chose Dylan because it
had never played on the West
Coast, and I had been considered
for the role in the road show
from New York. The show didn't
go on the road and I was given
the rights out here. And we did
have a feeling for it! We do
plays of the heart and humanity
and poetry, and that is the
sort of play Dylan is.


Jack Aranson
Actor-director Jack Aranson
is currently appearing as Welsh
poet Dylan Thomas in Sidney
Michaels' Dylan now in its sixth
month at the City Theater in
San Francisco. In a recent in
terview Aranson moved com
fortably around in his cluttered
dressing room - office, inter
rupting only to fetch ashtrays
and answer the telephone. He
wore a white shirt open at the
neck, a wide tie decorated with
a crescent design, and his
trousers hung precariously
from his hips. His dark hair
looked as if it had been combed
with his fingers, and his com
plexion was ruddy. In short, he
looked like Dylan Thomas.
Aranson settled back in his
chair to answer serious ques
tions about drams, delivering
without condescension beauti
fully-phrased and intoned com
ments on the theater and then,
changing tone and expression,
sat forward to answer lighter
questions, displaying at the
same time a captivating person
al wit and a sharp, thorough
grasp of his "craft and sullen
art" which is evident in the
following excerpts from the in
terview:
Art Forms
Q. I've heard it said that
the technical qualities of one
art form can be transferred to
another. Do you agree?
A. An artist is concerned
with finding the shape of what
he is doing. The arts are re
lated, of course, and in each
form one finds rhythm, tone,
balance, and shape. They come
together in the theater: it is
the tempo of the arts.
Q. You have both directed
and acted in plays. Have you
ever tried writing one?
A. No, I haven't except some
things for class when I was
studying acting. I think the hard
est thing in the world is to
write a play.
Director - Conductor
Q. A director is sometimes
compared to a conductor in his
need to avoid domination of one
particular aspect of the pro
duction. In directing a play
have you ever felt this?
A. Any good play has a bal
ance of soprano, tenor, bass,
baritone, alto, like in music.
The orchestration is important.
That's what I find to be so
great bout Shaw, his orchestra
tion.
Q. Do you have any particular
method of acting? Must you
feel an emotion when you ex
press it on stage?
A. I try to be detached and
relaxed. This is something I

was taught when I studied act
ing and I have come to realize
its importance. One should
strive to express intensity but
not tenseness. If something
feels too real it ceases to be
theatrically real. I don't be
lieve in the method of acting
only what one has experienced;
I find imagination to be es
sential. I could play the part of
a murderer without committing
the crime.

talking of his fate, but in a
romantic sort of way. He com
pared himself to other poets
who died young— Shelley, Keats,
Rimbaud. He didn't have to die
in New York. His death resulted
from a combination of drink
and drugs he was taking for his
health. He didn't actually drink
himself to death in the White
Horse Tavern as was implied
in the last scene. He didn't
drink eighteen straight whis
keys, as he claimed, more like
ly it was four or five. But it
wasn't this that killed him,
Dylan died of pneumonia. Any
man that gets away from his
roots, that is what destroys
him.
Religious Significance
Q. You me Uioned the scene
in the White Horse Tavern.
Did Dylan's action of pyramid
ing the whiskey glasses have
religious significa. V- p.
A. Dylan was Tjious
man, but not in hied
,n J °

sense, although I believe he was
a conscientious objector. He
was socialistically inclined.
Besides, I couldn't imagine Dy
lan in uniform! The pyramid
of glasses had reference to the
pyramids and the Bible. But
by too much delving into sym
bolism one runs the danger
of losing the essence of the
magic.
Hand-picked
Q. Judging on the enthusiasm
and fine quality of your perfor
mance as Dylan, I would guess
that this was a play you hand
picked.
A. We chose Dylan because it
had never played on the West
Coast, and I had been considered
for the role in the road show
from New York. The show didn't
go on the road and I was given
the rights out here. And we did
have a feeling for it! We do
plays of the heart and humanity
and poetry, and that is the
sort of play Dylan is.


Jack Aranson
Actor-director Jack Aranson
is currently appearing as Welsh
poet Dylan Thomas in Sidney
Michaels' Dylan now in its sixth
month at the City Theater in
San Francisco. In a recent in
terview Aranson moved com
fortably around in his cluttered
dressing room - office, inter
rupting only to fetch ashtrays
and answer the telephone. He
wore a white shirt open at the
neck, a wide tie decorated with
a crescent design, and his
trousers hung precariously
from his hips. His dark hair
looked as if it had been combed
with his fingers, and his com
plexion was ruddy. In short, he
looked like Dylan Thomas.
Aranson settled back in his
chair to answer serious ques
tions about drams, delivering
without condescension beauti
fully-phrased and intoned com
ments on the theater and then,
changing tone and expression,
sat forward to answer lighter
questions, displaying at the
same time a captivating person
al wit and a sharp, thorough
grasp of his "craft and sullen
art" which is evident in the
following excerpts from the in
terview:
Art Forms
Q. I've heard it said that
the technical qualities of one
art form can be transferred to
another. Do you agree?
A. An artist is concerned
with finding the shape of what
he is doing. The arts are re
lated, of course, and in each
form one finds rhythm, tone,
balance, and shape. They come
together in the theater: it is
the tempo of the arts.
Q. You have both directed
and acted in plays. Have you
ever tried writing one?
A. No, I haven't except some
things for class when I was
studying acting. I think the hard
est thing in the world is to
write a play.
Director - Conductor
Q. A director is sometimes
compared to a conductor in his
need to avoid domination of one
particular aspect of the pro
duction. In directing a play
have you ever felt this?
A. Any good play has a bal
ance of soprano, tenor, bass,
baritone, alto, like in music.
The orchestration is important.
That's what I find to be so
great bout Shaw, his orchestra
tion.
Q. Do you have any particular
method of acting? Must you
feel an emotion when you ex
press it on stage?
A. I try to be detached and
relaxed. This is something I

was taught when I studied act
ing and I have come to realize
its importance. One should
strive to express intensity but
not tenseness. If something
feels too real it ceases to be
theatrically real. I don't be
lieve in the method of acting
only what one has experienced;
I find imagination to be es
sential. I could play the part of
a murderer without committing
the crime.
Q. Dylan is a realistic play.
Is realism the pervading mode
of the theater today?
Off - Beat
A. Today there is a tendency
for the off-beat. The off - beat,
the avant-grade, have never
really had the depth I wanted.
I have done a play by Brecht,
"St. Joan of the Stockyards."
What appealed to me about a
big play by Brecht is that it
was so big, nearly Homeric.
There is not much room for
characterization, no time to
develop a scene or a charac
ter. I was mainly concerned
with the sweep of Brecht's
thought.
Q. What do you think of
dramatists who use the stage
as a forum for their social
views?

A. Theater today is going
in a social -conscious direc
tion, and getting away from
art. Any great play has social
significance—Shakespeare did,
but he had human things, too.
A social play is limiting; it
has no depth.
What Survives?
Q. Plays based on an idea
rather than a personality seem
to survive the years best. Do
you think Michaels saw Dylan
merely as a play about the
last few years of a great poet's
life?
A. For Michaels Dylan Thom
as is the idea. Michaels has
a good feeling for words and
the stage. I hope the play will
have lasting appeal.

Q. Do you think Dylan is a
tragedy, despite its predomin
ance of the comic?
A. No, it has to be clas
sified as a chronicle play. It's
tragic insofar that Dylan died
young. One must fight against
the tragedy through the comedy.
In Romeo and Juliet, for in
stance, there was much com
edy—in the balcony scene, in
their young love. Shakespeare
let the tragedy take care of it
self, and that is what we must
do with Dylan. Comedy is essen
tial to the play because it is so
long and unrelenting. Besides,
there was much comedy in Dylan
Thomas. He used to imperson
ate Harpo Marx when he was
a young man. He resembled
Marx, with a mop of golden
curls. There is also a great
similarity between Dylan and
Charlie Chaplin. Both were
poets of movement and ex
pression. In fact, that's a good
descriptive word for Michael's
play—Chaplinesque.
Tragedy?
Q. Couldn't it be a tragedy
in the Oedipal sense, with Dy
lan a man driven by fate?
A. Dylan used to go around
talking of his fate, but in a
romantic sort of way. He com
pared himself to other poets
who died young— Shelley, Keats,
Rimbaud. He didn't have to die
in New York. His death resulted

sat forward to answer lighter
questions, displaying at the
same time a captivating person
al wit and a sharp, thorough
grasp of his "craft and sullen
art" which is evident in the
following excerpts from the in
terview:
Art Forms
Q. I've heard it said that
the technical qualities of one
art form can be transferred to
another. Do you agree?
A. An artist is concerned
with finding the shape of what
he is doing. The arts are re
lated, of course, and in each
form one finds rhythm, tone,
balance, and shape. They come
together in the theater: it is
the tempo of the arts.
Q. You have both directed
and acted in plays. Have you
ever tried writing one?
A. No, I haven't except some
things for class when I was
studying acting. I think the hard
est thing in the world is to
write a play.
Director - Conductor
Q. A director is sometimes
compared to a conductor in his
need to avoid domination of one
particular aspect of the pro
duction. In directing a play
have you ever felt this?
A. Any good play has a bal
ance of soprano, tenor, bass,
baritone, alto, like in music.
The orchestration is important.
That's what I find to be so
great bout Shaw, his orchestra
tion.
Q. Do you have any particular
method of acting? Must you
feel an emotion when you ex
press it on stage?
A. I try to be detached and
relaxed. This is something I

was taught when I studied act
ing and I have come to realize
its importance. One should
strive to express intensity but
not tenseness. If something
feels too real it ceases to be
theatrically real. I don't be
lieve in the method of acting
only what one has experienced;
I find imagination to be es
sential. I could play the part of
a murderer without committing
the crime.
Q. Dylan is a realistic play.
Is realism the pervading mode
of the theater today?
Off - Beat
A. Today there is a tendency
for the off-beat. The off - beat,
the avant-grade, have never
really had the depth I wanted.
I have done a play by Brecht,
"St. Joan of the Stockyards."
What appealed to me about a
big play by Brecht is that it
was so big, nearly Homeric.
There is not much room for
characterization, no time to
develop a scene or a charac
ter. I was mainly concerned
with the sweep of Brecht's
thought.
Q. What do you think of
dramatists who use the stage
as a forum for their social
views?

A. Theater today is going
in a social -conscious direc
tion, and getting away from
art. Any great play has social
significance—Shakespeare did,
but he had human things, too.
A social play is limiting; it
has no depth.
What Survives?
Q. Plays based on an idea
rather than a personality seem
to survive the years best. Do
you think Michaels saw Dylan
merely as a play about the
last few years of a great poet's
life?
A. For Michaels Dylan Thom
as is the idea. Michaels has
a good feeling for words and
the stage. I hope the play will
have lasting appeal.

Q. Do you think Dylan is a
tragedy, despite its predomin
ance of the comic?
A. No, it has to be clas
sified as a chronicle play. It's
tragic insofar that Dylan died
young. One must fight against
the tragedy through the comedy.
In Romeo and Juliet, for in
stance, there was much com
edy—in the balcony scene, in
their young love. Shakespeare
let the tragedy take care of it
self, and that is what we must
do with Dylan. Comedy is essen
tial to the play because it is so
long and unrelenting. Besides,
there was much comedy in Dylan
Thomas. He used to imperson
ate Harpo Marx when he was
a young man. He resembled
Marx, with a mop of golden
curls. There is also a great
similarity between Dylan and
Charlie Chaplin. Both were
poets of movement and ex
pression. In fact, that's a good
descriptive word for Michael's
play—Chaplinesque.
Tragedy?
Q. Couldn't it be a tragedy
in the Oedipal sense, with Dy
lan a man driven by fate?
A. Dylan used to go around
talking of his fate, but in a
romantic sort of way. He com
pared himself to other poets
who died young— Shelley, Keats,
Rimbaud. He didn't have to die
in New York. His death resulted
from a combination of drink
and drugs he was taking for his
health. He didn't actually drink
himself to death in the White
Horse Tavern as was implied
in the last scene. He didn't
drink eighteen straight whis
keys, as he claimed, more like
ly it was four or five. But it
wasn't this that killed him,
Dylan died of pneumonia. Any
man that gets away from his
roots, that is what destroys
him.
Religious Significance
Q. You me Uioned the scene
in the White Horse Tavern.
Did Dylan's action of pyramid
ing the whiskey glasses have
religious significa. V- p.
A. Dylan was Tjious
man, but not in hied
,n J °

sense, although I believe he was
a conscientious objector. He
was socialistically inclined.
Besides, I couldn't imagine Dy
lan in uniform! The pyramid
of glasses had reference to the
pyramids and the Bible. But
by too much delving into sym
bolism one runs the danger
of losing the essence of the
magic.
Hand-picked
Q. Judging on the enthusiasm
and fine quality of your perfor
mance as Dylan, I would guess
that this was a play you hand
picked.
A. We chose Dylan because it
had never played on the West
Coast, and I had been considered
for the role in the road show
from New York. The show didn't
go on the road and I was given
the rights out here. And we did
have a feeling for it! We do
plays of the heart and humanity
and poetry, and that is the
sort of play Dylan is.


Jack Aranson
Actor-director Jack Aranson
is currently appearing as Welsh
poet Dylan Thomas in Sidney
Michaels' Dylan now in its sixth
month at the City Theater in
San Francisco. In a recent in
terview Aranson moved com
fortably around in his cluttered
dressing room - office, inter
rupting only to fetch ashtrays
and answer the telephone. He
wore a white shirt open at the
neck, a wide tie decorated with
a crescent design, and his
trousers hung precariously
from his hips. His dark hair
looked as if it had been combed
with his fingers, and his com
plexion was ruddy. In short, he
looked like Dylan Thomas.
Aranson settled back in his
chair to answer serious ques
tions about drams, delivering
without condescension beauti
fully-phrased and intoned com
ments on the theater and then,
changing tone and expression,
sat forward to answer lighter
questions, displaying at the

al wit and a sharp, thorough
grasp of his "craft and sullen
