The American Conservatory
Theatre, (ACT), opens the four
week drama phase of the 1966
Stanford Summer Festival with
its production of Edward Al
bee's controversial "Tiny
Alice" at 8 p.m. Monday (JULY
18) in Memorial Auditorium.
In all, the ACT will present
37 performances of nine dif
ferent plays nightly at Stanford
through Aug. 13.
The first week of the ACT
repertory will also include Dy
lan Thomas' "Under Milkwood"
Tuesday, July 19, and Satur
day, July 23; Arthur Miller's
"Endgame" at two special 11
p.m. showings Friday, July 21,
and Saturday.
The company will also pre
sent "Six Characters in Search
of an Author," "Uncle Vanya,"
"Misalliance," "Charley's
Aunt," and "Beyond the
Fringe" at Stanford theaters
through Aug. 13.
Generally the plays locus
on the basic festival theme per
iod ,1900-1940, presenting major
playwrights from both America
and Europe. "Tiny Alice," is
the tour de force of the year
old acting company, and is in
cluded as a contemporary in
novation in theatrical style.
The special "after shows,
"Endgame" and "Beyond the
Fringe," are also extensions
of the theme. The concept of
the "late show" was created
for the Edinburgh Festival with
the British revue.
ACT was founded in the spring
of 1965 by Ball as a combin
ation performing and training

includes 21 plays. It operated
