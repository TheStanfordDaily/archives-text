## 'I Was Thrown Out' 
### 
Editor, The Summer Weekly:
On July 13 I was thrown out
of the Guild Theatre in Meilo
Park, for the offense of having
objected to the manager about
the practice of taking charity
collections from a captive audi
ence inside a movie theater.
The manager did not tempor
ize in any way but threw me
out angrily the moment I made
the complaint. In my opinion

his readiness to throw out in
stantly and belligerently a pa
tron who makes a peaceful com
plaint (however unpalatable to
him personally) justifies some
serious reserve in any good
feeling one may have toward
his theater.
