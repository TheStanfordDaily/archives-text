# 'Virginia Woolf' Faithful To Albee
## 
### David Denby 
The first thing to be said about "Who's Afraid of Vir
ginia Woolf" is that it is a very good movie. I want to make
that clear in light of what follows. Edward Albee's play,
you recall, takes place entirely in a single set and has
only four characters*, a history professor and his wife,
both in their 40's and a young biology instructor and his
wife, both in their 20's and new to the New England uni
versity community. ,

Director Mike Nichols moves
out of the older couple's liv
ing room and uses a restaur
ant, a parking lot and the front
lawn to break the monotony.
In all other respects the film
is faithful to the play, and Al
bee is reportedly quite pleased
with it.
Steady
Mike Nichol's direction is
very sure and steady; there are
no waste motions no dead mom
ents; every scene comes off.
He has concentrated on direct
ing actor's and building sit
uations, and it is a pleasure,
in the current period of gim
mickry and intense stylization,
to see a job in the old straight
forward, literal style done so
well.
As George, the history pro
fessor, Richard Burton gives
us another of his intellectual
men struggling against some
disadtrous failure of nerve. He
has played this kind of role
many times, and finally he has
internalized its tensions and
passions, doing away with the
declamatory and overemphatic
style that has marred some of
his screen work in the past.
Liz
Elizabeth Taylor has found a
fine part for her strong but
severely limited talent. As
Cleopatra--or anyone grand
she was laughable because she
could never suggest any emo
tion larger than petulance. But
the tragedy of Martha's life is
its failure to rise to the le
vel of grandeur or dignity, and
Miss Taylor plays the part with
a passionate commitment to
Martha's mediocraty.ln

her moments of sad reflection
over the waste of her life and
marriage to George she is actu
ally quite moving.
As Nick, the young biology
insturctor on the make, George
Segal has much improved his
ability to portray boorishness
since his "Ship of Fools" dis
aster. The note of stupid self
satisfaction is just right; "I'm
better," he says, moving into
the slime.
Sandy Dennis
Sandy Dennis has the diffi
cult part of Honey, Nick's wife,
and she must suggest an ap
pearance of small-town sweet
ness and innocence that covers
an imbecile selfishness and 1
fear. Miss Dennis convinces us
that although Honey is harm
less, she is so far removed
from the truth about herself
that she is as lost as the
others, who are destructive.
Of course, the relationship
of George and Martha is Al
bee's central concern. It is part
of their selfishness to involve
everything and everyone in their
battles. Nick and Honey are
only weapons they use on each
other and cast aside; so is the
mythical son they have created
to patch over their barren mar
riage.
Structure
Their relationship deter
mines the structure of the film.
Together they are involved in
a single project; to punish them
selves and each other for all
their failures and weaknesses,
the chief failure and weakness
of each being the love he can
not help feeling for the other.
To this end they have invented

an elaborate series of games,
each designed to expose and
rasp. First one partner takes
the lead while the other pre
tends to protest, feigning bore
dom or fatigue, but really fas
cinated and anticipatory. They
are both "hooked" on these
games. The game progresses,
reaches its climax of punish
ment and pain and then ends.
A rest period follows, a time
for retanking at the bar and
taunts, then the other begins
a new game, raising the ante
of malice a bit, and the whole
thing is repeated. Finally Mar
tha "breaks the rules" by re
vealing more to Nick about
George's failures than she has
ever done before. When the
rules are really broken and
smashed, George destroys the
game altogether by killing off
the illusory son (this is sup
posed to have the force of real
death and Martha is shattered.)
Dialectic
This murderous dialectic
continues until dawn and ex
haustion, stretching backwards
and forewards into time for
ever. But we are meant to ac

cept two paradoxes about
George and Martha; first, that
they really need and love each
other, and second, that hope
less as it is, their life to
gether is better than that of
most couples (i.e. Honey and
Nick) because they have had
the courage to really get to
the roots of things, they have
had the rare courage to en
counter their existence in dis
gust, whereas Nick and Honey
are incapable of encountering
it at all.
Strained
I find these paradoxes too
strained to believe. Martha and
George are really too far ad
vanced in viciousness to be
redeemed this way. Their des
tructiveness is too great, their
lack of resistance to horror
too slight, their eagerness to
drag others into their rituals
too overwhelming. There is a
ritualistic, obsessive character
about their relationship; it is
the character of fantasy. This
quality of fantasy is inseparable
from the nature of the play it
self. To put it bluntly, the dram
atic structure of "Virginia

Woolf" turns out to be the most
convenient way of organizing an
immense and only partially con
trolled discharge of malice
(what is the point of the scene
where George turns cruelly on
nick and Honey?); it is a struc
ture built on a series of mu
tual interlocking cruelties, each
provoking, sustaining and justi
fying the next.
If Albee failed to control his
own fantasies enough to sustain
them through a work of art,
he certainly was successful in
engaging those of the audience.
The air in the theater was
charged with the release of old
hostilities and frustrations.
"Now he's really giong to get
her," a man behind me said
at one point as George readied
an insult, and each put-down
was greeted with gasps and gig
gles of pleasure. At the end,
everyone left the theater as ex
hausted as George and Martha,
full of the satisfaction of see
ing a particularly vicious box
ing match.


Beyond the Fringe with Rene Auberjonois will be presented by the
American Conservatory Theatre as a late show.
