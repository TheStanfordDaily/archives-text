## Stanford Summer Needs A Daily 
### Steve Gruber 
Until twelve years ago, the
student newspaper for summer
quarter was published twice a
week and called The Stanford
Daily.
Then, for reasons still mys
terious to me, The Stanford
Simmer Weekly was born. In
dependent of The Daily, the
Weekly has done its best, but
failed.
A weekly publication cannot
inform or communicate as well
as a daily publication. Is sum
mer quarter so substantially
different that it requires only
a small tabloid newspaper once
a week?
The first eleven volumes of
The Summer Weekly were only
two pages for each edition. The
eight page editions of this
volume are possible only
through advertising. Conveni
ently enough, advertising was
prohibited in the other volumes
by a Daily sponsored A3SU
constitutional amendment in
1954.
The point is that The Weekly
is making money. Apparently,
no matter what we do, we will
be able to give $500 back to
the ASSU out of a total budget
of $1400.
However, we cannot avoid
the fact that we are missing
important news stories. Com
munication between students,
faculty, staff, and the outside
world is seriously hindered.
And there's really nothing
we can do about it.
Except publish a daily news
paper.
I believe that The Stanford
Daily should publish this sum
mer daily: it has avoided its
responsibilities to the student
body during summer quarter
for twelve years.
This is a recent decision
on my part, stemming from my
experiences last year on The
Weekly.
Last year no one even got
around to deciding on who was

to be the editor until several
days after the quarter had
started. Finally Bob Bjoring
was found and coerced into the
job. He later appointed me exe
cutive editor, a postion that I
was equally unwilling to take.
We took a long look at The
Weekly and decided to print
it at the Menlo Park Record
er. The Stanford Press was
indignant. But we could not
avoid the fact that their prices
were out of the question. Our
decision led The Daily to start
printing at the Recorder in Jan
uary of this year.
Another long look at The
Weekly proved to us that it
was useless to the campus as
a newspaper. Our reaction was
to not print anything even vague
ly resembling news. Instead,
we wrote the best feature stor
ies we could find. Our photo
grapher used the best pictures
he had taken. In fact, when a
man jumped off Hoover Tower,
we refused to print the story,
considering it "Too gory."
We always tried to have a
semi-clothed maiden on the
front page. This was to pro
mote readership. Which was ex
actly what it did.
The only difference between
last year's Weekly and the
Chaparral was that you had to
pay for the Chaparral.
We had no cause. The paper
printed no editorials, it was
received critically as a "very
conservative college weekly."
It was also a very bad college
weekly.
Suddenly it was late May,
1966. And The Daily was look
ing for another editor for The
Weekly. They opened the file
and found me under "G", still
hiding from the Dean of Stu
dents. I was elected by ac
clamation.
They expected another placic
two page Weekly.
But someone fouled up some
where line. Little did
they |v5- they had found
an editcr wanted more than
a small tabloid.
The Weekly is now eight
pages, it has an excellent staff
of writers and photographers.
Its circulation is 6000, for
a student body of only 4000.
(The Daily publishes only 10,000
copies for a student body of
11,000.)
Furthermore, the 1966 Sum
mer Weekly has proven that a
summer newspaper can make
money. It has also proven that
much more communication is
needed during the summer.
Stanford University does not
need to cease its progress dur
ing July and August. Student
[activity does not need to sud
denly quit on June 8.
What this place does need is
a daily newspaper for the sum
mer.
We have proven that it can
be done. It is up to The Stan
ford Daily now to produce the
summer daily.

of $1400.
However, we cannot avoid
the fact that we are missing
important news stories. Com
munication between students,
faculty, staff, and the outside
world is seriously hindered.
And there's really nothing
we can do about it.
Except publish a daily news
paper.
I believe that The Stanford
Daily should publish this sum
mer daily: it has avoided its
responsibilities to the student
body during summer quarter
for twelve years.
This is a recent decision
on my part, stemming from my
experiences last year on The
Weekly.
Last year no one even got
around to deciding on who was

to be the editor until several
days after the quarter had
started. Finally Bob Bjoring
was found and coerced into the
job. He later appointed me exe
cutive editor, a postion that I
was equally unwilling to take.
We took a long look at The
Weekly and decided to print
it at the Menlo Park Record
er. The Stanford Press was
indignant. But we could not
avoid the fact that their prices
were out of the question. Our
decision led The Daily to start
printing at the Recorder in Jan
uary of this year.
Another long look at The
Weekly proved to us that it
was useless to the campus as
a newspaper. Our reaction was
to not print anything even vague
ly resembling news. Instead,
we wrote the best feature stor
ies we could find. Our photo
grapher used the best pictures
he had taken. In fact, when a
man jumped off Hoover Tower,
we refused to print the story,
considering it "Too gory."
We always tried to have a
semi-clothed maiden on the
front page. This was to pro
mote readership. Which was ex
actly what it did.
The only difference between
last year's Weekly and the
Chaparral was that you had to
pay for the Chaparral.
We had no cause. The paper
printed no editorials, it was
received critically as a "very
conservative college weekly."
It was also a very bad college
weekly.
Suddenly it was late May,
1966. And The Daily was look
ing for another editor for The
Weekly. They opened the file
and found me under "G", still
hiding from the Dean of Stu
dents. I was elected by ac
clamation.
They expected another placic
two page Weekly.
But someone fouled up some
where line. Little did
they |v5- they had found
an editcr wanted more than
a small tabloid.
The Weekly is now eight
pages, it has an excellent staff
of writers and photographers.
Its circulation is 6000, for
a student body of only 4000.
(The Daily publishes only 10,000
copies for a student body of
11,000.)
Furthermore, the 1966 Sum
mer Weekly has proven that a
summer newspaper can make
money. It has also proven that
much more communication is
needed during the summer.
Stanford University does not
need to cease its progress dur
ing July and August. Student
[activity does not need to sud
denly quit on June 8.
What this place does need is
a daily newspaper for the sum
mer.
We have proven that it can
be done. It is up to The Stan
ford Daily now to produce the
summer daily.
Until twelve years ago, the
student newspaper for summer
quarter was published twice a
week and called The Stanford
Daily.
Then, for reasons still mys
terious to me, The Stanford
Simmer Weekly was born. In
dependent of The Daily, the
Weekly has done its best, but
failed.
A weekly publication cannot
inform or communicate as well
as a daily publication. Is sum
mer quarter so substantially
different that it requires only
a small tabloid newspaper once
a week?
The first eleven volumes of
The Summer Weekly were only
two pages for each edition. The
eight page editions of this
volume are possible only
through advertising. Conveni
ently enough, advertising was
prohibited in the other volumes
by a Daily sponsored A3SU
constitutional amendment in
1954.
The point is that The Weekly
is making money. Apparently,
no matter what we do, we will
be able to give $500 back to
the ASSU out of a total budget
of $1400.

er. The Stanford Press was
indignant. But we could not
avoid the fact that their prices
were out of the question. Our
decision led The Daily to start
printing at the Recorder in Jan
uary of this year.
Another long look at The
Weekly proved to us that it
was useless to the campus as
a newspaper. Our reaction was
to not print anything even vague
ly resembling news. Instead,
we wrote the best feature stor
ies we could find. Our photo
grapher used the best pictures
he had taken. In fact, when a
man jumped off Hoover Tower,
we refused to print the story,
considering it "Too gory."
We always tried to have a
semi-clothed maiden on the
front page. This was to pro
mote readership. Which was ex
actly what it did.
The only difference between
last year's Weekly and the
Chaparral was that you had to
pay for the Chaparral.
We had no cause. The paper
printed no editorials, it was
received critically as a "very
conservative college weekly."
It was also a very bad college
weekly.
Suddenly it was late May,
1966. And The Daily was look
ing for another editor for The
Weekly. They opened the file
and found me under "G", still
hiding from the Dean of Stu
dents. I was elected by ac
clamation.
They expected another placic
two page Weekly.
But someone fouled up some
where line. Little did
they |v5- they had found
an editcr wanted more than
a small tabloid.
The Weekly is now eight
pages, it has an excellent staff
of writers and photographers.
Its circulation is 6000, for
a student body of only 4000.
(The Daily publishes only 10,000
copies for a student body of
11,000.)
Furthermore, the 1966 Sum
mer Weekly has proven that a
summer newspaper can make
money. It has also proven that
much more communication is
needed during the summer.
Stanford University does not
need to cease its progress dur
ing July and August. Student
[activity does not need to sud
denly quit on June 8.
What this place does need is
a daily newspaper for the sum
mer.
We have proven that it can
be done. It is up to The Stan
ford Daily now to produce the
summer daily.
