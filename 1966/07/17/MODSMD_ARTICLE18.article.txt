# Smash The Idol Of Greatness
## 
### Perry Lee Birchard 
President Johnson is trying
to be the great president of a
Great Society.
President Sterling is trying
to be the great president of a
Great University.
Will either succeed? Con
sidering the present course of
each, attainment of Greatness is
not likely.
Greatness is not something
one obtains merely by trying
hard or by having lots of money
with which to buy facades.
Greatness is inherited or it
is achieved.
Relics
Stanford's heritage, like that
of the United States, is not
culturally rich. There is a cer
tain lack of couthness about
each. There is a consciousness
on the part of the members
that this is so, and the seeking
of Greatness is an admission
of mediocritv.
In Stanford's case, the things
which are preserved within the
hallowed walls of the Stanford
Museum indicate the lack of
social grace and cultural her
itage of our founders. This
is also true of the disgusting
dedication which once garnished
the facade of Memorial Church.
Since our heritage is not
of the highest calibre, we at
tempt to achieve greatness.
Changing goals
Greatness is not achieved
through mimicry. Second-rate
showmen know that. And con
sciously seeking greatness is
as hollow and hopeless as try
ing to find religion.

Concentrating on trying to
be great is concentrating on
an outcome of acceptance by
others. If we forgot this crass
goal and explored our universe
to explore it rather than seeking
things which would make us
look good, we might make cul
tural and academic contribu
tions which would cause others
to deem us Great.
What are presently standards
for greatness (like having two
thirds of the faculty in the :
air at all times) are transcient,
superficial standards. The act
of gullibly playing the game,
of setting out to achieve this
kind of goal, causes observors
to lose respect for us.
Stanford's road to greatness
is blocked by its monastic at
titude towards the world. It
exists as an island, cut off
from the mainland and from the
world which—particularly in
the humanities and the arts
it seeks to describe and deal
with. Some of the departments
seem to be tiny sects, cut
off even from their own disci
pline.
This is a problem not only
amongst faculty members, but
with the student body as well.
Despite an activist minority
that seeks to know and to deal
with its total environment,
lethergy dominates Stanford.
This is reinforced not only
by the physical location and
qualities of Stanford, but by
the thoughts of the financial
contributors to the University.
The Price of Money
A Great University need not

worry about its constituents.
They become its patrons be
cause it has been deemed great.
A University TRYING to be
great is tied down trying to
please people who the Univer
sity thinks might make good
patrons. But to truly become
great, the University must
wrench itself from being so
dependent upon representatives
of the present powers that be
often representatives who re
flect the lack of culturedness
and awareness of our founders
and many of our alumni (who
are often the constiments).
The exploration of one's en
vironment, the seeking of new
solutions to old problems, the
formulation of new problems—
the elements that could make
us great--are the very things
which run against the grain
of the people we feel we must
please.
No matter what the University
does, it cannot please or even
appease everyone.
Facing Ourselves
What we need is a catholic
student body and faculty inter
ested in academics and not in
rituals or in merely making
our immediate constituents
happy. Money alone will not
achieve our goal, nor will rit
uals and facades. Greatness
involves the sacrifice of some
of these things.
We must be true to ourselves.
We must be honest with our
selves.
The question is, do we have
enough intestinal fortitude to
do this, to be Great?
