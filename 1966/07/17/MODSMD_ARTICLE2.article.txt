# I-Center Swings As Such
## 
### Carole Weinstock 
The gaudy sign over the side
entrance of the I-Center
As-Such. That's an artier way
of saying the ASSU coffee house,
open for business every night
from 8 through 2 am.
When I stuck my head in the
door, the first thing I saw
was either a midget beatnik or
a beat 12-year-old in a tiger
striped beret, painting a mural
on the wall of a little room I
didn't even know existed in
the I-Center. The mural looks
like a magnified close-up view
of the Union Jack, which, they
tell me, will have a huge, blood
shot eye in the middle. God
Save The ASSU.
Miniature Artist
No one was in the room
besides the miniature artist,
and a bigger Stanford student
eyeing the eye-less mural cri
tically. There were a couple
of tables set up, but the whole
thing looked pretty empty. I
asked where I could find some
coffee, and the artist (he said
his name was Bruce, and he
really is 12 years old) led me
to a counter made by a table
drawn across the entrance to
the I -Center kitchen. There
I met Wendy, proprietress and
originator of the As-Such.
Wendy gives the place
character. She's a little blonde
with big hoop earrings and a
throaty voice. That voice does
more than ask for orders. If
there's anyone around to play
accompaniment she sings, too.
And when Wendy's not singing
the shiny new juke box is blar
ing out a Beatles or Rolling

Stones record.
I-Center Film
The I-Center was showing a
film Friday night, so not much
was doing when I got there.
The juke box wasn't on, and
the usual crowd wasn't milling
around. The calm didn't last
long, though.
At intermission a troop of

Algerians, Swiss, Egyptians,
Indians and Ethiopians crowded
in from all sides for the As-
Such specials—capuccino, hot
cinnamon-stick cider, or a fab
ulous sandwich made with
pastrami and monterey jack
cheese on rye (or bagels for
the New Yorkers), toasted in


"You better eat it, it's coming out of your tuition money."

melon feed held last Sunday at Lagunita.
the oven until the cheese melts,
then sprinkled with chopped let
tuce and spread with mustard
and mayonnaise. Next to that,
a T-burger looks anemic.
Taking Orders
By this time I was on Wendy's
side of the counter, madly tak
ing orders, and learning to make
capuccino au rhum. Shortly
after that the union closed, the
folk-dancers danced their last
hora, and the movie ended. The
crowd flowed out onto the ter
race and courtyard of the cen
ter, now adorned by a female
statue resembling a papier
mache dress form, standing
guard over a huge basket of
unshelled roasted peanuts.
After two handfuls of peanuts
it's time to go back for another
cup of hot cider.
Someone started the jukebox,
people started talking to the
people around them, the tables
in the courtyard were filling
up, Friday night at the As-
Such, 11:30 P.M., was in full

When I stuck my head in the
door, the first thing I saw
was either a midget beatnik or
a beat 12-year-old in a tiger
striped beret, painting a mural
on the wall of a little room I
didn't even know existed in
the I-Center. The mural looks
like a magnified close-up view
of the Union Jack, which, they
tell me, will have a huge, blood
shot eye in the middle. God
Save The ASSU.
Miniature Artist
No one was in the room
besides the miniature artist,
and a bigger Stanford student
eyeing the eye-less mural cri
tically. There were a couple
of tables set up, but the whole
thing looked pretty empty. I
asked where I could find some
coffee, and the artist (he said
his name was Bruce, and he
really is 12 years old) led me
to a counter made by a table
drawn across the entrance to
the I -Center kitchen. There
I met Wendy, proprietress and
originator of the As-Such.
Wendy gives the place
character. She's a little blonde
with big hoop earrings and a
throaty voice. That voice does
more than ask for orders. If
there's anyone around to play
accompaniment she sings, too.
And when Wendy's not singing
the shiny new juke box is blar
ing out a Beatles or Rolling

Stones record.
I-Center Film
The I-Center was showing a
film Friday night, so not much

The juke box wasn't on, and
the usual crowd wasn't milling
around. The calm didn't last
long, though.
At intermission a troop of

Algerians, Swiss, Egyptians,
Indians and Ethiopians crowded
in from all sides for the As-
Such specials—capuccino, hot
cinnamon-stick cider, or a fab

pastrami and monterey jack
cheese on rye (or bagels for
the New Yorkers), toasted in


"You better eat it, it's coming out of your tuition money."
