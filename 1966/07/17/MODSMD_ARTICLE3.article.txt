Interview of Cesar Chavez, di
rector of the National Farm
Workers Association in Delano,
Calif., by Jim Morrell. At a
July 4 rally of farm workers
in Hanford, Calif.
(Cesar Chavez had just been
released from the San Diego
jail after having been arrested
on the property of a large
grape growing corporation near
Borrego, Calif.)
Q. On what charges were you
arrested last week and how
were you treated?
A. We were charged with
trespassing on Di Giorgio fields
with intent to disrupt business.
The arrest was made by Di
Giorgio armed guards.
35 workers who had been
fired for supporting the grape
pickers' strike wanted to pick
up their belongings which were
at their camp on Di Giorgio
property. They knew Di Giorgio
armed guards with police dogs
were there waiting for them
and wanted me to go along with

them, along with a local priest
and Rev. Hartmire (of the United
Church Migrant Ministry). So
eight of us got into a station
wagon and, as expected, about
150 yards inside Di Giorgio
property we encountered a bar
ricade manned by the Di Giorgio
guards and were arrested. We
had to wait five hours under
this "citizen's arrest" until
the deputy sheriff came. They
locked me inside a truck for
five hours. This I consider
outright kidnapping. Then we
were taken to the sheriff's office
in Borrego, searched and strip
ped naked. The San Diego sheriff
finally came and chained all
of us inside his truck for the
ride to San Diego. I was bailed
out Thursday.
Q. Do you think your case
will be thrown out of court?
A. I don't know what they will
do, but I think this practice
of keeping men in camps as
prisoners has to be tested in

non-union workers to join In Delano, California, last week.
