Interview of Cesar Chavez, di
rector of the National Farm
Workers Association in Delano,
Calif., by Jim Morrell. At a
July 4 rally of farm workers
in Hanford, Calif.
(Cesar Chavez had just been
released from the San Diego
jail after having been arrested
on the property of a large
grape growing corporation near
Borrego, Calif.)
Q. On what charges were you
arrested last week and how
were you treated?
A. We were charged with
trespassing on Di Giorgio fields
with intent to disrupt business.
The arrest was made by Di
Giorgio armed guards.
35 workers who had been
fired for supporting the grape
pickers' strike wanted to pick
up their belongings which were
at their camp on Di Giorgio
property. They knew Di Giorgio
armed guards with police dogs
were there waiting for them
and wanted me to go along with

them, along with a local priest
and Rev. Hartmire (of the United
Church Migrant Ministry). So
eight of us got into a station
wagon and, as expected, about
150 yards inside Di Giorgio
property we encountered a bar
ricade manned by the Di Giorgio
guards and were arrested. We
had to wait five hours under
this "citizen's arrest" until
the deputy sheriff came. They
locked me inside a truck for
five hours. This I consider
outright kidnapping. Then we
were taken to the sheriff's office
in Borrego, searched and strip
ped naked. The San Diego sheriff
finally came and chained all
of us inside his truck for the
ride to San Diego. I was bailed
out Thursday.
Q. Do you think your case
will be thrown out of court?
A. I don't know what they will
do, but I think this practice
of keeping men in camps as
prisoners has to be tested in

court. That is the significance
of this case.
Q. How did the recent union
elections of Di Giorgio
employees come about?
A. We had been in constant
contact with Di Giorgio, hoping
to agree on terms for an
election. We told their rep
resentatives that we had to go
to Los Angeles for a few days
to negotiate the Schenley con
tract. In Los Angeles we were
surprised when Di Giorgio sud
denly called an election after
ten months of denying that the
workers even wanted a union.
Q. Why did the NFWA and
AWOC (Agricultural Workers
Organizing Committee, ap
pointed by the AFL-CIO) tell
the workers not to vote in the
election?
A. After ten difficult months
of applying economic pressure
through the strike and boycott
we could not think of partici
pating in a rigged election. Di
Giorgio tried to confuse things
by putting the Teamsters on the
ballot, hanging out a sign saying
"Teamsters Forever", threat
ening workers with loss of their
jobs if they didn't vote in the
election. Despite all this only
10 per cent of the Di Giorgio
grape pickers voted in the elec
tion. Most of the people that
voted were not even farm
workers.
Q. As for the Teamsters, do
you think their participation
was an opportunistic move on
their part or were they drawn
in unwittingly?
I think they were brought
in unwittingly. They are out
of their element here among
the farm workers. We'll beat
them 5 to 1 in a fair election.
Until we get that we'll just
continue applying economic
pressure and the pressure of
public opinion of people around
the state.
Q. What are your criteria.for
a fair election and on what
basis do you expect to win so
overwhelmingly?
A. Checking the cards of the
workers who have signed NFWA
cards against the Di Giorgio
payroll lists shows a great
majority of the grape pickers
on our side. The Di Giorgio

workers had a meeting at which
they gave the majority to NFWA
and decided not to participate
in an election where the polls
were rigged by Di Giorgio. The
election must be carried out
by a qualified, disinterested
third party.
Q. What is the situation after
the election?
Governor Brown has ap
pointed a distinguished, well
qualified representative to in
vestigate the election and arbi
trate. This will increase the
pressure on Di Giorgio to agree
to a new election.
Q. Moving on to more general
questions, when I came down
here I had an impression of the
strike as primarily a civil
rights movement. What ele
ments of a civil rights struggle
do you see in your movement?
A. Well, we are not protected
by the Wagner Act, and we had
to have the march to Sacra
mento, borrowing a tactic from
civil rights, in order to drama
tize our need for legal protec
tion. The strike in the Valley
is like a civil rights struggle
in that the workers' civil li
berties are trampled upon; it
is also similar in that 99 per
cent of the people we are or
ganizing belong to various
minorities.
Q. What do you think of the
recent turn in SNCC (Student
Nonviolent Coordinating Com
mittee) toward the slogan of
"black power" and excluding
white civil rights workers? Do
you see any possibility of the
same thing happening in NFWA?
A. Our union is open to every
one. Mexicans, Negros, Fili
pinos, and whites are welcome
and are all already active in
it. As forSNCC, I have no com
ment; Pm sure they can take
care of themselves.
Q. Do you have any comment
on recent events in Vietnam,
the bombing of Hanoi and Hai
phong and so forth?
A. No comment. Naturally, I
have my personal feelings about
it.

pating in a rigged election. Di
Giorgio tried to confuse things
by putting the Teamsters on the
ballot, hanging out a sign saying
"Teamsters Forever", threat
ening workers with loss of their
jobs if they didn't vote in the
election. Despite all this only
10 per cent of the Di Giorgio
grape pickers voted in the elec
tion. Most of the people that
voted were not even farm
workers.
Q. As for the Teamsters, do
you think their participation
was an opportunistic move on
their part or were they drawn
in unwittingly?
I think they were brought
in unwittingly. They are out
of their element here among
the farm workers. We'll beat
them 5 to 1 in a fair election.
Until we get that we'll just
continue applying economic
pressure and the pressure of
public opinion of people around
the state.
Q. What are your criteria.for
a fair election and on what
basis do you expect to win so
overwhelmingly?
A. Checking the cards of the
workers who have signed NFWA
cards against the Di Giorgio
payroll lists shows a great
majority of the grape pickers
on our side. The Di Giorgio

workers had a meeting at which
they gave the majority to NFWA
and decided not to participate
in an election where the polls
were rigged by Di Giorgio. The
election must be carried out
by a qualified, disinterested
third party.
Q. What is the situation after
the election?
Governor Brown has ap
pointed a distinguished, well
qualified representative to in
vestigate the election and arbi
trate. This will increase the
pressure on Di Giorgio to agree
to a new election.
Q. Moving on to more general
questions, when I came down
here I had an impression of the
strike as primarily a civil
rights movement. What ele
ments of a civil rights struggle
do you see in your movement?
A. Well, we are not protected
by the Wagner Act, and we had
to have the march to Sacra
mento, borrowing a tactic from
civil rights, in order to drama
tize our need for legal protec
tion. The strike in the Valley
is like a civil rights struggle
in that the workers' civil li
berties are trampled upon; it
is also similar in that 99 per
cent of the people we are or
ganizing belong to various
minorities.
Q. What do you think of the
recent turn in SNCC (Student
Nonviolent Coordinating Com
mittee) toward the slogan of
"black power" and excluding
white civil rights workers? Do
you see any possibility of the
same thing happening in NFWA?
A. Our union is open to every
one. Mexicans, Negros, Fili
pinos, and whites are welcome
and are all already active in
it. As forSNCC, I have no com
ment; Pm sure they can take
care of themselves.
Q. Do you have any comment
on recent events in Vietnam,
the bombing of Hanoi and Hai
phong and so forth?
A. No comment. Naturally, I
have my personal feelings about
it.
Interview of Cesar Chavez, di
rector of the National Farm
Workers Association in Delano,
Calif., by Jim Morrell. At a
July 4 rally of farm workers
in Hanford, Calif.
(Cesar Chavez had just been
released from the San Diego
jail after having been arrested
on the property of a large
grape growing corporation near
Borrego, Calif.)
Q. On what charges were you
arrested last week and how
were you treated?
A. We were charged with
trespassing on Di Giorgio fields
with intent to disrupt business.
The arrest was made by Di
Giorgio armed guards.
35 workers who had been
fired for supporting the grape
pickers' strike wanted to pick
up their belongings which were
at their camp on Di Giorgio
property. They knew Di Giorgio
armed guards with police dogs
were there waiting for them
and wanted me to go along with

them, along with a local priest
and Rev. Hartmire (of the United
Church Migrant Ministry). So
eight of us got into a station
wagon and, as expected, about
150 yards inside Di Giorgio
property we encountered a bar
ricade manned by the Di Giorgio
guards and were arrested. We
had to wait five hours under
this "citizen's arrest" until
the deputy sheriff came. They
locked me inside a truck for
five hours. This I consider
outright kidnapping. Then we
were taken to the sheriff's office
in Borrego, searched and strip
ped naked. The San Diego sheriff
finally came and chained all
of us inside his truck for the
ride to San Diego. I was bailed
out Thursday.
Q. Do you think your case
will be thrown out of court?
A. I don't know what they will
do, but I think this practice
of keeping men in camps as
prisoners has to be tested in

court. That is the significance
of this case.
Q. How did the recent union
elections of Di Giorgio
employees come about?
A. We had been in constant
contact with Di Giorgio, hoping
to agree on terms for an
election. We told their rep
resentatives that we had to go
to Los Angeles for a few days
to negotiate the Schenley con
tract. In Los Angeles we were
surprised when Di Giorgio sud
denly called an election after
ten months of denying that the
workers even wanted a union.
Q. Why did the NFWA and
AWOC (Agricultural Workers
Organizing Committee, ap
pointed by the AFL-CIO) tell
the workers not to vote in the
election?
A. After ten difficult months
of applying economic pressure
through the strike and boycott

and are all already active in
it. As forSNCC, I have no com
ment; Pm sure they can take
care of themselves.
Q. Do you have any comment
on recent events in Vietnam,
the bombing of Hanoi and Hai
phong and so forth?
A. No comment. Naturally, I
have my personal feelings about
it.
Interview of Cesar Chavez, di
rector of the National Farm
Workers Association in Delano,
Calif., by Jim Morrell. At a
July 4 rally of farm workers
in Hanford, Calif.
(Cesar Chavez had just been
released from the San Diego
jail after having been arrested
on the property of a large
grape growing corporation near
Borrego, Calif.)
Q. On what charges were you
arrested last week and how
were you treated?
A. We were charged with
trespassing on Di Giorgio fields
with intent to disrupt business.
The arrest was made by Di
Giorgio armed guards.
35 workers who had been
fired for supporting the grape
pickers' strike wanted to pick
up their belongings which were
at their camp on Di Giorgio
property. They knew Di Giorgio
armed guards with police dogs
were there waiting for them
and wanted me to go along with

them, along with a local priest
and Rev. Hartmire (of the United
Church Migrant Ministry). So
eight of us got into a station
wagon and, as expected, about
150 yards inside Di Giorgio
property we encountered a bar
ricade manned by the Di Giorgio
guards and were arrested. We
had to wait five hours under
this "citizen's arrest" until
the deputy sheriff came. They
locked me inside a truck for
five hours. This I consider
outright kidnapping. Then we
were taken to the sheriff's office
in Borrego, searched and strip
ped naked. The San Diego sheriff
finally came and chained all
of us inside his truck for the
ride to San Diego. I was bailed
out Thursday.
Q. Do you think your case
will be thrown out of court?
A. I don't know what they will
do, but I think this practice
of keeping men in camps as
prisoners has to be tested in

court. That is the significance
of this case.
Q. How did the recent union
elections of Di Giorgio
employees come about?
A. We had been in constant
contact with Di Giorgio, hoping
to agree on terms for an
election. We told their rep
resentatives that we had to go
to Los Angeles for a few days
to negotiate the Schenley con
tract. In Los Angeles we were
surprised when Di Giorgio sud
denly called an election after
ten months of denying that the
workers even wanted a union.
Q. Why did the NFWA and
AWOC (Agricultural Workers
Organizing Committee, ap
pointed by the AFL-CIO) tell
the workers not to vote in the
election?
A. After ten difficult months
of applying economic pressure
through the strike and boycott
we could not think of partici
pating in a rigged election. Di
Giorgio tried to confuse things
by putting the Teamsters on the
ballot, hanging out a sign saying
"Teamsters Forever", threat
ening workers with loss of their
jobs if they didn't vote in the
election. Despite all this only
10 per cent of the Di Giorgio
grape pickers voted in the elec
tion. Most of the people that
voted were not even farm
workers.
Q. As for the Teamsters, do
you think their participation
was an opportunistic move on
their part or were they drawn
in unwittingly?
I think they were brought
in unwittingly. They are out
of their element here among
the farm workers. We'll beat
them 5 to 1 in a fair election.
Until we get that we'll just
continue applying economic
pressure and the pressure of
public opinion of people around
the state.
Q. What are your criteria.for
a fair election and on what
basis do you expect to win so
overwhelmingly?
A. Checking the cards of the
workers who have signed NFWA
cards against the Di Giorgio
payroll lists shows a great
majority of the grape pickers
on our side. The Di Giorgio

workers had a meeting at which
they gave the majority to NFWA
and decided not to participate
in an election where the polls
were rigged by Di Giorgio. The
election must be carried out
by a qualified, disinterested
third party.
Q. What is the situation after
the election?
Governor Brown has ap
pointed a distinguished, well
qualified representative to in
vestigate the election and arbi
trate. This will increase the
pressure on Di Giorgio to agree
to a new election.
Q. Moving on to more general
questions, when I came down
here I had an impression of the
strike as primarily a civil
rights movement. What ele
ments of a civil rights struggle
do you see in your movement?
A. Well, we are not protected
by the Wagner Act, and we had
to have the march to Sacra
mento, borrowing a tactic from
civil rights, in order to drama
tize our need for legal protec
tion. The strike in the Valley
is like a civil rights struggle
in that the workers' civil li
berties are trampled upon; it
is also similar in that 99 per
cent of the people we are or
ganizing belong to various
minorities.
Q. What do you think of the
recent turn in SNCC (Student
Nonviolent Coordinating Com
mittee) toward the slogan of
"black power" and excluding
white civil rights workers? Do
you see any possibility of the
same thing happening in NFWA?
A. Our union is open to every
one. Mexicans, Negros, Fili
pinos, and whites are welcome
and are all already active in
it. As forSNCC, I have no com
ment; Pm sure they can take
care of themselves.
Q. Do you have any comment
on recent events in Vietnam,
the bombing of Hanoi and Hai
phong and so forth?
A. No comment. Naturally, I
