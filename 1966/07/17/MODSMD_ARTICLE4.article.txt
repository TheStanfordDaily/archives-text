period, highlighted the three
and one half hour sessions.

ford to protest the United States
position in Vietnam.
Christian Bay
Christian Bay, a lecturer in
political science, began Thurs
day's session giving a general
background and history of Viet
nam. After tracing the history
of Vietnam from 1940 to the
present, Bay discussed the U.
S. position in the Vietnam war.
Bay explained that United
States withdrawal from Vietnam
is based on what the U. S.
hopes to achieve there. He list
ed the terms of the National
Liberation Front as the key
to sucess in Vietnam. The terms
include electing a new national
assembly, granting amnesty to
political prisoners, revitalizing
agriculture, organizing social
welfare, guaranteeing property
rights, establishing diplomatic
relations with all countries re

gardless of their political
status, plus other measures.
Withdrawal
Bay stated that U. S. refusal
to accept the principles of the
National Liberation Front is
keeping this country from with
drawing from Vietnam.
His speech was followed by
former SCPC Chairman Cyril
Sia's discussion of the legal
history of Vietnam.
Also on Thursday, Bruce
Franklin, Stanford professor of
English, talked on peace feelers
and offensives. Stanford Ken
Mills ended the session quest
ioning the philosophy in
structor moral aspect of the
Vietnam war.
Keith Lowe
Graduate student Keith Lowe
talked on insurgency in Vietnam
Friday. Arthur Driessel, Stan
ford instructor of speech and
drama, discussed alternatives
and withdrawal possibilities.
SCPV member Dick Newlin
lectured on consciencious ob
jection. He stated that presently
only "those who are convinced
by their religious beliefs that
they are forbidden to kill a
nother are consider con-
sciencious objectors. Newlin
stated that philosophical
grounds are not considered
to be significant for objecting
to government policy.
In discussing the war, Newlin
explained that the U. S. involve
ment in Vietnam is based on
economics. He cited the cost
of the war and the profit that
business is making from
government contracts for war
materials. "Our reasons foi
being in Vietnam are not princi
ples of democracy." Newlin
projected that if war profit
was eliminated, the war might
end soon.
Draft Mentioned
Newlin also discussed the
draft. He claimed that the pre
sent draft system is unbalanced,
and it unjustly discriminates
against the lower classes. He
proposed that both men and
women should be drafted, and
that they should be allowed
to enter either military or civ
ilian service.
Commenting on the public's
role in the war, Newlin cited
recent polls that show the gen
eral disapproval of the admin
istration's policy. He claimed
that most disapproval ends with
polls. "Either conform or you
are disobedient. Yet it is this
habit of obedience that keeps
the war going." Newling urged
that "one should cease being
disappointed in Vietnam, and
actively resist it."
Following Newlin's talk, Mrs.
Lisa Kalvelage, a San Jose
housewife, reported on her pro
test of the use of napalm.
Convicted
Last month Mrs. Kalvelage
was convicted for civil dis
obedience and given a $100 fine
and a 90 day jail sentence.
A member of the Women's
International League for Peace
and Freedom of San Jose, Mrs.
Kavelage was arrested last May
for attempting to stop shipment
of napalm.
Reflecting on why she and
three others protested, Mrs.
Kavelage stated that her actions
were prompted partly by
"thinking about our children
and the children in Vietnam."
She added that her former life
in West Germany also in
fluenced her position.

SCPV member Dick Newlin
lectured on consciencious ob
jection. He stated that presently
only "those who are convinced
by their religious beliefs that
they are forbidden to kill a
nother are consider con-
sciencious objectors. Newlin
stated that philosophical
grounds are not considered
to be significant for objecting
to government policy.
In discussing the war, Newlin
explained that the U. S. involve
ment in Vietnam is based on
economics. He cited the cost
of the war and the profit that
business is making from
government contracts for war
materials. "Our reasons foi
being in Vietnam are not princi
ples of democracy." Newlin
projected that if war profit
was eliminated, the war might
end soon.
Draft Mentioned
Newlin also discussed the
draft. He claimed that the pre
sent draft system is unbalanced,
and it unjustly discriminates
against the lower classes. He
proposed that both men and
women should be drafted, and
that they should be allowed
to enter either military or civ
ilian service.
Commenting on the public's
role in the war, Newlin cited
recent polls that show the gen
eral disapproval of the admin
istration's policy. He claimed
that most disapproval ends with
polls. "Either conform or you
are disobedient. Yet it is this
habit of obedience that keeps
the war going." Newling urged
that "one should cease being
disappointed in Vietnam, and
actively resist it."
Following Newlin's talk, Mrs.
Lisa Kalvelage, a San Jose
housewife, reported on her pro
test of the use of napalm.
Convicted
Last month Mrs. Kalvelage
was convicted for civil dis
obedience and given a $100 fine
and a 90 day jail sentence.
