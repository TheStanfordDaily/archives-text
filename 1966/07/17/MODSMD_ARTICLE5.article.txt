### Steve Gruber 
Mrs. Dorothy 0. Bell, campus
Food Service Director, will re- j
tire in September after 30 years '
at Stanford.
"Yes, there have been a few
problem over the years," com
mented Mrs. Bell, "but I've
loved every minute of it." She
remembers when Chuck Taylor,
now head of the Athletic De
partment, and Pete Kmetovic,
now assistant operations man
ager for student affairs, once
hashed for her.
Started in 1936
Mrs. Bell began her career
at Stanford as the Dining Hall
Director of Encina Commons
in 1936. She was also in charge
of the dining hall for Union
Residence.
In 1940, she was appointed
Administrative Assistant to the
University Food Service Direc
tor. She assumed her present
duties in 1959.
Several important changes
have been instituted under her
leadership. The most recent
was the open meal transfer
program, in which any student
paying board at one residence
may eat, without additional
charge, at any other residence.
Each residence has a sign-up
sheet posted outside the dining
room and all that a student
needs do is sign to transfer
his meal. "The students have
been wild about it, and all of,

the quotas have been filled,"
Mrs. Bell added.
550 Hashers
Over 550 hashers are em
ployed by the University's din
ing halls and each one is in
terviewed personally by Mrs.
Bell. "Every hasher goes
through this office," she said,
"So I've interviewed about
16,500 hashers."
Feeding the 3800 students
who live on campus is a major
operation. For example, last
year the Food Service served
1.3 million pounds of meat at
a total cost of a half million
dollars. 280 tons of canned
fruit and vegetables were put
on the tables of the various

dining halls.
According to Mrs. Bell, "The
larger the dining hall, the more
efficient it is." For example,
Wilbur Hall, the largest, has
very little difficulty running
in the black, but Stillman House
has trouble staying out of the
red.
lowa State
Mrs. Bell is a graduate of
lowa State University where
she earned a bachelor of sci
ence degree in institutional
management and dietetics. Of
the 29 people working in the
food service office, 21 have
similar degrees. All 29 belong
to the American Dietetic As
sociation.

"Yes, there have been a few
problem over the years," com
mented Mrs. Bell, "but I've
loved every minute of it." She
remembers when Chuck Taylor,
now head of the Athletic De
partment, and Pete Kmetovic,
now assistant operations man
ager for student affairs, once
hashed for her.
Started in 1936
Mrs. Bell began her career
at Stanford as the Dining Hall
Director of Encina Commons
in 1936. She was also in charge
of the dining hall for Union
Residence.
In 1940, she was appointed
Administrative Assistant to the
University Food Service Direc
tor. She assumed her present
duties in 1959.
Several important changes
have been instituted under her
leadership. The most recent
was the open meal transfer
program, in which any student
paying board at one residence
may eat, without additional
charge, at any other residence.
Each residence has a sign-up
sheet posted outside the dining
room and all that a student
needs do is sign to transfer
his meal. "The students have
been wild about it, and all of,

the quotas have been filled,"
Mrs. Bell added.
550 Hashers
Over 550 hashers are em
ployed by the University's din
ing halls and each one is in
terviewed personally by Mrs.
Bell. "Every hasher goes
through this office," she said,
"So I've interviewed about
16,500 hashers."
Feeding the 3800 students
who live on campus is a major
operation. For example, last
year the Food Service served
1.3 million pounds of meat at
a total cost of a half million
dollars. 280 tons of canned
fruit and vegetables were put
on the tables of the various

dining halls.
According to Mrs. Bell, "The
larger the dining hall, the more
efficient it is." For example,
Wilbur Hall, the largest, has
very little difficulty running
in the black, but Stillman House
has trouble staying out of the
red.
