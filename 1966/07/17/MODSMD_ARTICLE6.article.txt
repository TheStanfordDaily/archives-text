# Students Design For Handicapped
## 
### Pat McMahon Daily Science Editor 
Crutches? What could be new
about crutches? Except for rub
ber padding, they haven't chang
ed much since the time of Jesus.
But a Stanford engineering
student recently set a new speed
record on crutches--down 23
steps in 20 seconds. His
secret--a significantly differ
ent crutch designed by a team
of student engineers here as
a design engineering course
project.
The improved crutch features
a six - inch extension from the
side which rests upon the upper
step as the user descends to the
next lower one, and it allows
one necessary balance to avoid
tumbling down the stairs.
Safe Descent
Previously, to descend stairs
safely, a crippled person would
either have to maintain pre
cision balance, or discard the
aid and grapple with railings
sometimes equally ineffective.
The crutch also has an ad
justable handle which the user
can move up or down, thus
avoiding his leaning forward
and down to reach the handle
as he sets the crutch on each
lower step.
The team of student engineers
who designed this new crutch
were taking part in a design
engineering project. Another
team of such engineers also
produced an innovation in med
ical care aids with a wheelchair
for hemiplegics. Hemiplegics
are persons with one side of
their body paralyzed.
Manipulating a wheelchair is

extremely difficult for them
because, in order to steer, they
must first turn one wheel and
then the other with the same
hand. This proved extremely
cumbersome for thehemiplegic
and confined him to uncrowded
areas.
Small Wheels
The students solved the pro
blem by attaching one of the
chair's small front wheels to the
foot rest of the patient's func
tional side. Then using his good
arm to propel the chair and foot
to steer the chair by guiding
the small wheel using the foot
rest, the hemiplegic can suces
sfully cope with crowds.
Christened by the five team
members as "Hemisteer," the
device will entail only an in
expensive addition to be built
into wheelchairs with separate
footrests, and will soon be on
the market.
The two groups focused on
the problems of aid for the
disabled under the direction
of their professor, Dr. Peter
Z. Bulkeley, head of the Design
Division of the Mechanical En
gineering Department. The stu
dents were helped and advised
by doctors, patients, and staff
members of the Stanford Re
habilitation Center and the
Crystal Springs Rehabilitation
Center in San Mateo.
Final Exam
At the close of winter quarter,
each group reported its work
and demonstrated models be
fore a "jury" of physicians and
engineers. This presentation
replaced the usual final exam,
and the jury did the grading.


Tom Speer demonstrates a safe descent of a stairway
on specially designed crutches. Speer was a member of a
team of engineers that developed the new device. Support
ing arms that unfold from the crutches at stair height en
able him to lean back as he swings his feet out and down
to the next step, thus eliminating the usual danger of fall
ing forward. Under his other arm Speer uses an old-style
crutch with a stair-height support attached to it for tests.

ing arms that unfold from the crutches at stair height en
able him to lean back as he swings his feet out and down
to the next step, thus eliminating the usual danger of fall
ing forward. Under his other arm Speer uses an old-style
crutch with a stair-height support attached to it for tests.
Crutches? What could be new
about crutches? Except for rub
ber padding, they haven't chang
ed much since the time of Jesus.
But a Stanford engineering
student recently set a new speed
record on crutches--down 23
steps in 20 seconds. His
secret--a significantly differ
ent crutch designed by a team
of student engineers here as
a design engineering course
project.
The improved crutch features
a six - inch extension from the
side which rests upon the upper
step as the user descends to the
next lower one, and it allows
one necessary balance to avoid
tumbling down the stairs.
Safe Descent
Previously, to descend stairs
safely, a crippled person would
either have to maintain pre
cision balance, or discard the
aid and grapple with railings
sometimes equally ineffective.
The crutch also has an ad
justable handle which the user
can move up or down, thus
avoiding his leaning forward
and down to reach the handle
as he sets the crutch on each
lower step.
The team of student engineers
who designed this new crutch
were taking part in a design
engineering project. Another
team of such engineers also
produced an innovation in med
ical care aids with a wheelchair
for hemiplegics. Hemiplegics
are persons with one side of
their body paralyzed.
Manipulating a wheelchair is

extremely difficult for them
because, in order to steer, they
must first turn one wheel and
then the other with the same
hand. This proved extremely
cumbersome for thehemiplegic
and confined him to uncrowded
areas.
Small Wheels
The students solved the pro
blem by attaching one of the
chair's small front wheels to the
foot rest of the patient's func
tional side. Then using his good
arm to propel the chair and foot
to steer the chair by guiding
the small wheel using the foot
rest, the hemiplegic can suces
sfully cope with crowds.
Christened by the five team
members as "Hemisteer," the
device will entail only an in
expensive addition to be built
into wheelchairs with separate
footrests, and will soon be on
the market.
The two groups focused on
the problems of aid for the
disabled under the direction
of their professor, Dr. Peter
Z. Bulkeley, head of the Design
Division of the Mechanical En
gineering Department. The stu
dents were helped and advised
by doctors, patients, and staff
members of the Stanford Re
habilitation Center and the
Crystal Springs Rehabilitation
Center in San Mateo.
Final Exam
At the close of winter quarter,
each group reported its work
and demonstrated models be
fore a "jury" of physicians and
engineers. This presentation
replaced the usual final exam,
and the jury did the grading.
