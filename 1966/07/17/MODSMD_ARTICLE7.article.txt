The Bechtel International
Student Center is one place on
campus where a foreign digni
tary, a scholar or a student
will first be directed to make
his way to the rest of the cam
pus or into American life, for
that matter.
Gertrude S. Williams, who is
resigning her post as Foreign
Students Adviser, knows much
about this institution.
She speaks about the history
of the I-Center with some emo
tion. It was begun about ten
years ago in an old faculty house
next to the post office. That
burned down and for a couple
of years the I-Center was a
refugee, she said. Then Steph
en Bechtel, head of the Bech
tel Coorporation at San Fran
cisco, gave the Center some
money.
With the addition of the Uni

versity's fund and community
contributions the C en t e r be
came what it is . Bechtel is
not an alumunus but has pro
fessional and individual inter
est in in international affairs.
Alex E. Post
Another important individual
who contributed to the growth

of the Center was Alex E. Post,
an alumunus and old member
of Zeta Psi fraternity. He sug
gested the old fraternity house
should be the Center.
One of the benefactors of the
Center is the CCIS (Commun
ity Committee for International
Students) which was started by
faculty wives, alumuni of the
University and people inter
ested in meeting foreign stu
dents. This a volunteer group.
They assist the Foreign Stu
dents Adviser Office by serving
as liaison between Stanford stu
dents from abroad and the inter
national - minded residents of
communities near the campus.
At the beginning of the school
year, for instance, they arrange
for newly arrived foreign stu
dents a ten-day homestay and
orientation. The orientation
program is assisted by the
IIR (Institute of International
Relations) of the ASSU.


Located near the Faculty Club, the Bechtel International
Student Center provides a meeting place for the foreign
students on campus.
