Dear Steve (Sorry that I can't,
with conscience, apply the ti
tle):
Hank, Hank, turn the crank—
UP--and I (oh, powerful, ego
biggo, little I) will really pub
lish a paper. Stevie, is the
quality of the newspaper con
tingent upon a signed name?
If so—mine will be below al
though I am not your pet crank
who has been trying to tell
you something—to put it in
a simple vernacular which the
quality of your paper leads me
to believe you would under
stand—your paper STINKS. Or,
more cogently, it's the epitome
of the puerile mind—this mind
being exposed through writing
styles wnich no doubt have used
the local shopping quides as
paragons.
Take another look at your
"edtions"—peruse them. YOU
might, even then, send them

home, but I couldn't or
wouldn't--back home Stanford
means something.
Not only am I going to sign
my name to prove I am not
a crank, but to show you that
I am truly interested in see
ing that the Stanford rag is
a top-notch paper, I volunteer
ME. lam ready and willing to
toddle over—to knock you on
the knuckles, to help you edit,
to revise the articles into pieces
of writing that reflect, and lead
in, the scholarship that Stan
ford means.
