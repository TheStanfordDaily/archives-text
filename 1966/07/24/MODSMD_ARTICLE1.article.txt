# FILM SERIES:
## University Says Little About Films 
### Gordon piper 
Stanford University admin
istrators have been strangely
quiet in the three weeks follow
ing the Committee on Public
Excercises (CPE) decision to
ban the ASSU film series for
this summer. Officially, they
have neither openly stated their
support of the committee's ver
dict, nor acted against the stu
dents who violated the CPE film
ban by showing "Gold Diggers
of 1933" and "Flaming Crea
tures" on July 6.
When contacted this week by
the Stanford Weekly, however,
two administrative leaders did
make statements concerning the
film series.
Donald Carlson, Associate
Director of University Rela
tions, commented that he hoped
students would just drop the
idea of a film series for "this
summer session" and peTliaps
try planning another one for
the fall.
Carlson explained; "The
ASSU film series for this sum
mer was probably designed to
be shown to an adult audience.
However, the series was made
open to the entire university
community, which includes
many high school students and
Upward Bound participants dur
ing the summer."
"The situation is a diffi
cult one," he concluded. "Per
sonally, I hope the whole thing
is dropped. The students can
try presenting another film ser
ies in the fall."
Another university spokes
man, Dean Joel Smith, asserted
that the CPE was acting per-ti
fectly within its rights when
it banned the ASSU film series
on July 1. He stated: "The Com
mittee on Public Excercises is
in charge of scheduling school
events throughout the year, and
they were perfectly free to act
as they did."
Dean Smith indicated that uni
versity officials have met with
student leaders a number of
times privately to discuss the
film series suspension by the
CPE.
"Some sort of a statement
on the film series should be
issued this week by president
Sterling," he said.
When contacted this week,
President Sterling refused to
comment on the results of the
student-administration discus
sions. The Stanford Weekly did
learn however from other
sources that no sanctions were
planned against students who
defied the CPE ruling by show
ing the first two movies in
the ASSU film series. Their
showing was supposedly accept
able under the new circum
stances, since these films had
been ordered before the CPE
ban.

ASSU film series for this sum
mer was probably designed to
be shown to an adult audience.
However, the series was made
open to the entire university
community, which includes
many high school students and
Upward Bound participants dur
ing the summer."
"The situation is a diffi
cult one," he concluded. "Per
sonally, I hope the whole thing
is dropped. The students can
try presenting another film ser
ies in the fall."
Another university spokes
man, Dean Joel Smith, asserted
that the CPE was acting per-ti
fectly within its rights when
it banned the ASSU film series
on July 1. He stated: "The Com
mittee on Public Excercises is
in charge of scheduling school
events throughout the year, and
they were perfectly free to act
as they did."
Dean Smith indicated that uni
versity officials have met with
student leaders a number of
times privately to discuss the
film series suspension by the
CPE.
"Some sort of a statement
on the film series should be
issued this week by president
Sterling," he said.
When contacted this week,
President Sterling refused to
comment on the results of the
student-administration discus
sions. The Stanford Weekly did
learn however from other
sources that no sanctions were
planned against students who
defied the CPE ruling by show
ing the first two movies in
the ASSU film series. Their
showing was supposedly accept
able under the new circum
stances, since these films had
been ordered before the CPE
ban.
Stanford University admin
istrators have been strangely
quiet in the three weeks follow
ing the Committee on Public
Excercises (CPE) decision to
ban the ASSU film series for
this summer. Officially, they
have neither openly stated their
support of the committee's ver
dict, nor acted against the stu
dents who violated the CPE film
ban by showing "Gold Diggers
of 1933" and "Flaming Crea
tures" on July 6.
When contacted this week by
the Stanford Weekly, however,
two administrative leaders did
make statements concerning the
film series.
Donald Carlson, Associate
Director of University Rela
tions, commented that he hoped
students would just drop the
idea of a film series for "this
summer session" and peTliaps
try planning another one for
the fall.
Carlson explained; "The
