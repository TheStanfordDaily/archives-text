On July 1 the Committee on Public Exercises met to
ban the ASSU Summer Film Series. As usual its deliberations
were secret. When the Committee met again the next week
to consider student proposals for a revised series, students
were excluded from the meeting and minutes of the meeting
may not be printed in this paper. Public Exercises also
made some recommendations to President Sterling. The
recommendations have been kept secret on the grounds
that the Committee is Sterling's private advisory commit
tee
* Emphasizing that the Presidential Committees are only
advisory is to ignore the realities of the way policies are
made at Stanford. The recommendations of the Presidential
Committees are usually acepted.
It is argued that the student representatives convey the
student viewpoint—if there are any students on the com
mittee at all.
This is usually not the case because the students sit
ting on the committees are frequently not student leaders
and even if they are, they are severely limited in what they
may report to the student body.
The controversial issues of recent times are not so sensi
tive that they could not be subject to open scrutiny. The ef
fect of secrecy is not to allow freedom of expression but
to free these committees from the kind of open critical
debate which is supposed to characterize a university.
Certain faculty and administration members respected
by students are exploited to reassure students that all is
going well. The administration then acts surprised when
conflicts arise.
Until most of the secrecy in the formal deliberations of j
the Stanford University administration on issues related to
students is lifted , the administration may expect confron
tations—or what appear to be confrontations to them. Pri
vate deals and conferences with one, two or even four stu
dents will not be adequate to avoid conflict.
