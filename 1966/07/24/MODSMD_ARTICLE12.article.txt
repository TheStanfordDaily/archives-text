# Drinking Men Arise
## 
### 
Turning 21 and receiving my
majority provided me with a
minor but unexpected pro
blem. After I dispensed of my
false but neverfailing identi
fication, I sashayed down to
the local liquor emporium to
use my new found power. Al
though I had my draft regis
tration card and a Federal Pi
lot's license, both stating my
age, and other identification
with a picture to prove au
thenticity, I was denied my
right to buy alcoholic beverages

(at two different places).
Both counter jockeys claimed
I needed a drivers license.
Even If my license hadn't been
revoked, the intonation was that
it would be useless because
it is out-of-state. Although I
have always heard that drinking
and driving don't mix, the afore
mentioned discrimination a
gainst me because I am a non
driver indicates that the op
posite is true.
While there is clearly no
danger of events like this cur

tailing my drinking activities,
such occurrences are intem
perate, uncalled-for, and most
importantly, unbecoming to
Palo Alto and the state of Cal
ifornia. No self-re spec t
ing drinking man can rest easy
while this condition exists.
