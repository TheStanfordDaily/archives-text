# Bruce Franklin:
## "Winbigler Had No Right To Protest Film Series" 
### Steve Gruber 
Prof. Bruce Franklin, a
former member of the Commit
tee on Public Exercises (CPE)
claimed last week that the CPE
should not be involved in the
ASSU film series dispute.
Franklin also said "Dean
Winbigler had absolutely no
right in the world to be calling
up the I-Center to stop the show
ing of "Flaming Creatures.' "
Winbigler called the I-Center
after an anonymous student had
phoned him, protesting the film.

As a member of the CPE frorr
1961 to 1964, Franklin helped
write a new policy manual for
the committee. The new man
ual stated that the approval of
public events was to be based
on space limitations, not on con
tent. "The CPE was not act
ing within the limitations that
had been put on their discre
tionary powers," according to
Franklin.
"The CPE has never, in my
knowledge, referred any de
cision like this to the president.

"The Summer Festival lost
a quarter million dollars last
year, " Franklin continued,
"and it seems a real possibi
lity that the Universtiy is stop
ping the ASSU film series to
prevent competition. The ASSU
series is much better than the
Festival films.
"Some administrators were
saying in late Spring Quarter
that they were glad the students
had turned awayfrom secondary
issues and were concentrating
on education. But now the Uni
versity has brought up an is
sue-censorship that we had re
solved five years ago. And all
this while a Summer Festival
called "Twentieth Century In
novations" is going on."
Franklin told The Weekly that
"Flaming Creatures" has re
ceived good reviews. One of
them was by Susan Sonntag in
the "Partisan Review."
He also expresses a desire
to see Genet's "Un Chant d'
Amour", one of the banned
films. "A University like Stan
ford has an obligation to put
it on instead of knuckling under
to Alameda County," he com
mented. "Un Chant d'Amour"
had previously been banned by
the Alameda County Superior
Court.
Rumors that the Santa Clara
County District Attorney would
stop the showing of "Un Chant
d'Amour" at Stanford are false,
according to Franklin. He said
that CPE claimed this in order
to provide a basis for halting
the film series, "it was an
out and out lie," he concluded.

Prof. Bruce Franklin, a
former member of the Commit
tee on Public Exercises (CPE)
claimed last week that the CPE
should not be involved in the
ASSU film series dispute.
Franklin also said "Dean
Winbigler had absolutely no
right in the world to be calling
up the I-Center to stop the show
ing of "Flaming Creatures.' "
Winbigler called the I-Center
after an anonymous student had
phoned him, protesting the film.

As a member of the CPE frorr
1961 to 1964, Franklin helped
write a new policy manual for
the committee. The new man
ual stated that the approval of
public events was to be based
on space limitations, not on con
tent. "The CPE was not act
ing within the limitations that
had been put on their discre
tionary powers," according to
Franklin.
"The CPE has never, in my
knowledge, referred any de
cision like this to the president.

"The Summer Festival lost
a quarter million dollars last
year, " Franklin continued,
"and it seems a real possibi
lity that the Universtiy is stop
ping the ASSU film series to
prevent competition. The ASSU
series is much better than the
Festival films.
"Some administrators were
saying in late Spring Quarter
that they were glad the students
had turned awayfrom secondary
issues and were concentrating
on education. But now the Uni
versity has brought up an is
sue-censorship that we had re
solved five years ago. And all
this while a Summer Festival
called "Twentieth Century In
novations" is going on."
Franklin told The Weekly that
"Flaming Creatures" has re
ceived good reviews. One of
them was by Susan Sonntag in
the "Partisan Review."
He also expresses a desire
to see Genet's "Un Chant d'
Amour", one of the banned
films. "A University like Stan
ford has an obligation to put
it on instead of knuckling under
to Alameda County," he com
mented. "Un Chant d'Amour"
had previously been banned by
the Alameda County Superior
Court.
Rumors that the Santa Clara
County District Attorney would
stop the showing of "Un Chant
d'Amour" at Stanford are false,
according to Franklin. He said
that CPE claimed this in order
to provide a basis for halting
the film series, "it was an
out and out lie," he concluded.
