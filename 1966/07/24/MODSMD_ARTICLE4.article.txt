# Students Back Down
## Legislature Passes New Resolution 
### Herbie Hinks 
The Legislature unanimously
agreed to postpone the contro
versial ASSU film series last
week.
The decision came after two
meetings between students and
University President Wallace
Sterling.
In a resolution, the Legis
lature said "Be it resolved by
the Legislature of the Associ
ated Students here assembled
that the Summer Film Series
be temporarily postponed,
pending the action by President
Sterling on the recommendation
of*the Committee on Public Ex
ercises."
The Committee sent its re
commendation to Sterling's of
fice approximately two weeks
ago.
The Legislature voted on July
8 to show two of the films
despite a University ban. How
ever, no one in the ASSU ever
ordered either of the films.
According to Summer Student
Body President Cyril Sia, "I
thought that Jeff Lewin had
ordered the films on Monday
(July 11) . When I found that
he had not ordered them, I
tried to get them on Tuesday,
but was told that the airlines
strike would prevent them from
getting here in time."
The first meeting between
President Sterling and the stu
dents was held Friday, July 15.
The ASSU was represented by
David Harris, Tim Haight, Cy
ril Sia, and Jeff Lewin.
Sterling told the students that
the University is in favor of
all kinds of films, but in the
interests of the whole Univer
sity, the ASSU should withdraw
the film series.
The same group met on Mon
day and summarized Friday's
meeting. It was also mentioned
that the Santa Clara County Dis
trict Attorney had no interest
in banning the films as had been
previously reported.
Since those two meetings four
outside groups have offered to
show two of the films, "Un
Chant d'Amour" and "Scorpio
Rising." Friends of the Free
University, Stanford Friends of
Free Film, the Faculty Com
mittee for Freedom of the Arts,
and the Graduate Coordinating
Committee have volunteered to
sponsor the films.
The Legislature resolution is
reproduced in full below :
Whereas; The ASSU has tried
tu present a series of films for
presentation to the Stanford
community, and
Whereas; This film series
was cancelled by the Committee
on Public Exercises without
any consultation beforehand
with the ASSU, and
Whereas; The ASSU at
tempted to reinstate the series
by going before the Committee
on Public Exercises after the
series had been banned, and
that Committee made a recom
mendation to the President of
the University—a decision that
has not been acted upon by the
President, and
Whereas: The ASSU recog
nizes that some of the actions
of its officers, specifically with
regard to the advertising of the
series and the showing of two
of the films have been inter
preted by some persons as ex
amples of "student irresponsi
bility," and,
Whereas; The ASSU does not
wish this series of events to
be seen in the light of a
"student - administration con
flict" or of an unwillingness
on our part to participate in
consultation and discussion with
all interested parties,
Therefore; Be it resolved
by the Legislature of the As
sociated Students here as
sembled that the Summer Film
Series be temporarily post
poned, pending the action by
President Sterling on the re
commendation of the Committee
on Public Exercises, and
Be it further resolved that
the ASSU urges President Ster
ling to act quickly in making
this decision, so as to leave
time for films to be shown
this quarter if his decision
permits the films, and
Be it further resolved that
the ASSU urges President Ster
ling to seek and present a state
ment of University policy re
affirming the rights of free
expression in the University,
and
Be it further resolved that
the ASSU stands ready to
cooperate in what ever way
possible to insure a complete
understanding of the issues and
to overcome whatever ob

stacles have been made by pos
sibly inappropriate handling of
the series by members of var
ious constituencies of the Uni
versity.

The Legislature unanimously
agreed to postpone the contro

week.
The decision came after two
meetings between students and
University President Wallace
Sterling.
In a resolution, the Legis

the Legislature of the Associ

that the Summer Film Series
be temporarily postponed,
pending the action by President
Sterling on the recommendation
of*the Committee on Public Ex

The Committee sent its re

fice approximately two weeks
ago.
The Legislature voted on July
8 to show two of the films
despite a University ban. How
ever, no one in the ASSU ever
ordered either of the films.
According to Summer Student
Body President Cyril Sia, "I
thought that Jeff Lewin had
ordered the films on Monday
(July 11) . When I found that
he had not ordered them, I
tried to get them on Tuesday,
but was told that the airlines
strike would prevent them from
getting here in time."
The first meeting between
President Sterling and the stu
dents was held Friday, July 15.
The ASSU was represented by
David Harris, Tim Haight, Cy
ril Sia, and Jeff Lewin.
Sterling told the students that
the University is in favor of
all kinds of films, but in the
interests of the whole Univer
sity, the ASSU should withdraw
the film series.
The same group met on Mon
day and summarized Friday's
meeting. It was also mentioned
that the Santa Clara County Dis
trict Attorney had no interest
in banning the films as had been
previously reported.
Since those two meetings four
outside groups have offered to
show two of the films, "Un
Chant d'Amour" and "Scorpio
Rising." Friends of the Free
University, Stanford Friends of
Free Film, the Faculty Com
mittee for Freedom of the Arts,
and the Graduate Coordinating
Committee have volunteered to
sponsor the films.
