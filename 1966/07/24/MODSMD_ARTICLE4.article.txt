# Students Back Down
## Legislature Passes New Resolution 
### Herbie Hinks 
The Legislature unanimously
agreed to postpone the contro
versial ASSU film series last
week.
The decision came after two
meetings between students and
University President Wallace
Sterling.
In a resolution, the Legis
lature said "Be it resolved by
the Legislature of the Associ
ated Students here assembled
that the Summer Film Series
be temporarily postponed,
pending the action by President
Sterling on the recommendation
of*the Committee on Public Ex
ercises."
The Committee sent its re
commendation to Sterling's of
fice approximately two weeks
ago.
The Legislature voted on July
8 to show two of the films
despite a University ban. How
ever, no one in the ASSU ever
ordered either of the films.
According to Summer Student
Body President Cyril Sia, "I
thought that Jeff Lewin had
ordered the films on Monday
(July 11) . When I found that
he had not ordered them, I
tried to get them on Tuesday,
but was told that the airlines
strike would prevent them from
getting here in time."
The first meeting between
President Sterling and the stu
dents was held Friday, July 15.
The ASSU was represented by
David Harris, Tim Haight, Cy
ril Sia, and Jeff Lewin.
Sterling told the students that
the University is in favor of
all kinds of films, but in the
interests of the whole Univer
sity, the ASSU should withdraw
the film series.
The same group met on Mon
day and summarized Friday's
meeting. It was also mentioned
that the Santa Clara County Dis
trict Attorney had no interest
in banning the films as had been
previously reported.
Since those two meetings four
outside groups have offered to
show two of the films, "Un
Chant d'Amour" and "Scorpio
Rising." Friends of the Free
University, Stanford Friends of
Free Film, the Faculty Com
mittee for Freedom of the Arts,
and the Graduate Coordinating
Committee have volunteered to
sponsor the films.
The Legislature resolution is
reproduced in full below :

tu present a series of films for
presentation to the Stanford

Whereas; This film series

on Public Exercises without
any consultation beforehand
with the ASSU, and

tempted to reinstate the series
by going before the Committee
