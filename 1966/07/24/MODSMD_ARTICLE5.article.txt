# Variety Published By Press

Behind the modest facade of
the building which houses the
Stanford University Press is
an enterprise engaged in pub
lishing a great variety of sign
ificant, and sometimes esoter
ic, scholarly books.
Last year's sales volume
(two million dollars) is small
when compared to the endeavors
of the publishing arms of Har
vard, Yale, et al. but Stan
ford's press has many
distinguishing features which
compensate for its relatively
small size.
The Stanford University
Press does its own printing
and binding, for example. Most
university presses merely ar
range and edit, leaving the ac
tual production of the books
themselves to a printer who may
be hundreds of miles away.
Stanford, then, is in a position
to save time and sales in get
ting out an additional run of a
suddenly popular book by doing
this itself, and on its own pri
orities--not those of a printer
who has other clients to serve.
The paperback edition of Don
ald Frame's translation of Mon
taigne's Essays (#1 of Stanford's
new paperbound series) is a
case in point. A run of 5,000
copies was made last summer.
Despite the fine critical
response to the translation,
sales were small. Other tran
slations existed, and were al
ready well known. In addition,
Stanford's one volume paper
back edition of the Essays is
formidable, and so is its priceâ€”
$3.95. Thus the initial slowness
of sales.
Recently, Comumbia Univer
sity (whose press, ironically,
turned down Columbia scholar
Frame's translation because of
its redundancy) order 1,000 co
pies for its humanities course;
other colleges are now falling
in line, and the book appears
to have a secure future. Filled
with nervous optimism, Leon
Seltzer, the Press'director, has
ordered a run of 5,000 additional
copies.
Sales of 10,000 copies, which
would not be worth the bother
to Random House or Houghton
Mifflin, are a godsend to a
university press, which mea
sures total sales of a book in
terms of first (and usually final)
press runs of two or three
thousand. Despite the apparent
success of the Montaigne vol
ume, Stanford is not reaching
for the best-seller lists.
