## Lenox Quartet Scores 
### David Denby 
The Lenox String Quartet be
gan its series of six concerts
at Dinkelspiel Auditorium Wed
nesday with brilliant perfor
mances of three difficult works:
Bartok's Quartet No. 1, We
bern's Five Movements, Op. 5
and Bethoven's Quartet No. 8,
Op. 59, No. 2.
I last heard the Quartet four
years ago in New York, and in
that time they have come very
far. The Quartet's tone is full
and warm, but not thick or un
balanced; intonation is sure,
rhythms are taut and the arti- I
culation of rapid or tricky
phrases is clean. It is a vir
tuouso group of the front rank.
Why is it that Bartok's quar
tets are always called "aus
tere"? Severe, yes, harsh, oc
casionally, but never rigid
never without passion, never
without, in fact, an emotional
fullness and variety that have
been achieved before only by
Beethoven and Schubert. The
performance of Bartok's First
Quartet by the Lenox Quartet
was without the ultimate elec
tric sizzle that the Juilliard
Quartet always gives it, but
it was energetic enough to give
the agitated passages their
proper effect, and in the Lento
movement that opens the piece,
it was as beautiful and poignant
as any performance, bar none.
The Webern piece that fol
lowed was characterized, as all '
his music is, by extreme con- !

centration of expression (the
longest movement is 55 bars)
and by extraordinary shifts in
texture and sonority. For me,
Webern's compositions con
tinue to be collections of re
markable sounds, interesting in
[themselves, but without that
quality of internal organization
that produces any great plea
sure or emotion in listening.
But many people find his short
pieces very moving, and his
influence on contemporary
composers is immense. The
Quartet was standing on its toes
for this piece, and its pre
cision and agility drew sus
tained applause.
Precision and agility were al
so in evidence in the first and
last movements of Beethoven's
i Quartet No. 8 In addidtion, one
heard powerfully inflected play
ing in the Adagio that linked its
long phrases in a progression
of melody that was moving In
its total effect.

movement that opens the piece,
it was as beautiful and poignant
as any performance, bar none.
The Webern piece that fol
lowed was characterized, as all '
his music is, by extreme con- !

centration of expression (the
longest movement is 55 bars)
and by extraordinary shifts in
texture and sonority. For me,
Webern's compositions con
tinue to be collections of re
markable sounds, interesting in
[themselves, but without that
quality of internal organization
that produces any great plea
sure or emotion in listening.
But many people find his short
pieces very moving, and his
influence on contemporary
composers is immense. The
Quartet was standing on its toes
for this piece, and its pre
cision and agility drew sus
tained applause.
Precision and agility were al
so in evidence in the first and
last movements of Beethoven's
i Quartet No. 8 In addidtion, one
heard powerfully inflected play
ing in the Adagio that linked its
long phrases in a progression
of melody that was moving In
its total effect.
The Lenox String Quartet be
gan its series of six concerts
at Dinkelspiel Auditorium Wed
nesday with brilliant perfor
mances of three difficult works:
Bartok's Quartet No. 1, We
bern's Five Movements, Op. 5
and Bethoven's Quartet No. 8,
Op. 59, No. 2.
I last heard the Quartet four
years ago in New York, and in
that time they have come very
far. The Quartet's tone is full
and warm, but not thick or un
balanced; intonation is sure,
rhythms are taut and the arti- I
culation of rapid or tricky
phrases is clean. It is a vir
tuouso group of the front rank.
Why is it that Bartok's quar
tets are always called "aus
tere"? Severe, yes, harsh, oc
casionally, but never rigid
never without passion, never
without, in fact, an emotional
fullness and variety that have
been achieved before only by
Beethoven and Schubert. The
performance of Bartok's First
Quartet by the Lenox Quartet
was without the ultimate elec
tric sizzle that the Juilliard
Quartet always gives it, but
it was energetic enough to give
the agitated passages their
proper effect, and in the Lento
movement that opens the piece,
it was as beautiful and poignant
as any performance, bar none.
