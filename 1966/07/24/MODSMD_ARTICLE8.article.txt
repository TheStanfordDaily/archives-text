# Gelber Disputed
## 
### 
To the editor,
I was extremely shocked by
the obtuse, naive ingenuity, with
which a self-appointed psuedo
musical expert demolished the
last performance of the great
pianist Bruno Gelber.
The comment is full of in
exactitudes; first of all Mr.
Gelber is not a Brazilian, but
an Argentinian; second he did
not make his debut the 9th of
July; this is to ignore system
atically his unanimously ac
claimed debut of the 3rd of July
with the Orchestra of the Suisse
Romande.
...We are confronted with
poor and biased appreciations
on a pianist who has achieved
at an early age one of the most
difficult things a young pianist
can dream of; ESTABLISHED
RECOGNITION IN EUROPE.
But I still think the problem
is more acute than that; I just
wonder if the critic was so
extremely gifted to concentrate
in such subtle remarks in the
middle of a concert that looked
more as an outdoor picnic than
a recital; airplanes continually
buzzing over our heads; dogs
walking into the stage and pro
voking the general hilarity, peo
ple eating popcorn or drinking
coffee.
Miguel A. Milo
I apologize for my stupid
mistakes about Mr. Gelber's
birthplace and the date of his
American debut. In the latter
case I was misled by the pro
gram handed out at the reci
tal and the Festival Calendar.
What airplanes, dogs and pop
corn is Mr. Milo fulminating
about? My review was of the
Memorial Hall concert, where
Mr. Gelber had sole possession
of the stage and played with
out distraction.
What I heard that night in
Memorial Hall was bad play
ing, plain and simple. It was
imprecise, overdriven and
tonally unpleasant. I was sent
to the concert to report on Mr.
Gelber's playing that night, not
on his reception by the Euro
pean press (which was gen
erously quoted in the program,
press-agent style). Mr. Milo
does not take up a single one
of my criticisms.
