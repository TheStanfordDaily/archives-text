"Un Chant d' Amour'" and
"The Rules of the Game" will
be shown this week under the
sponsorship of the Departments
of French and Italian, and
Speech and Drama. The show
ings will be Aug. 4 and 5
(Thursday and Friday) at 8:00
pm in Cubberley Auditorium.
Only members of the Stanford
Community (with ID) 18 yrs. or
older will be admitted and there
will be no charge.
Prof. JohnC. Lapp, Executive
Head of French and Italian, said,
"I think these films ought to be
shown. This Department be
lieves in showing films of cine
matic, literary and artistic
merit."
Prof. Robert B. Loper, Exec
utive Head of Speech and Drama
said, "Our Department is happy
to sponsor the showings."
The intermediary between the
President's office and groups
desiring to show "Un Chant
d' Amour" and "Scorpio Ris
ing" (which is not available)
was Prof. Albert J. Guerard
(English). Guerard explained
that, "The essential change is
that the showings are now part
of an educational enterprise
rather than being offered as
public entertainment." The ar
rangements were nearly com
plete on Thursday afternoon
(July 28).
Joel Smith, Associate Dean
of Students announced the show
ings on Friday after four vol
untary groups including the
Stanford Faculty Committee for
Freedom in the Arts withdrew
their sponsorship in favor of
French and Italian, and Speech
and Drama. Prof. Bruce Frank
lin, who had applied to the Com
mittee on Public Exercises
(CPE) on behalf of the groups
for permission to use Cubberley
to show "Un Chant d' Amour"
and "Scorpio Rising" said, "I
think this is a fine solution to
the problem." Apparently his
application was sent to the
President's Office rather than
to CPE. Miss Agnes Norhnberg,
Dir. of Public Events said it
had been set to CPE. David
Weber, Chairman of CPE said
it was not sent to CPE.
In clarifying his remarks of
last week Franklin said that he
had not said that the CPE should
not have been involved in the
ASSU film series question but
rather that the problem never
should have been sent to other

days are left.
The application, as reprinted
in Broadcasting magazine, stat
ed that construction costs will
be $2310 and first year operat
ing costs will be $5735. The
FM station will be financially
supported by allocations from
the Regents and students' funds.
It will be administered by the
Board of Regents.
In a statement issued through
the University Relations office,
KZSU officials said, "The an
nouncement of the University
of California's application for
the FM freguency of 90.1 Mc.
came as a complete surprise
to KZSU. For several years
KZSU, in its capacity as the
flagship station for IBS West
(Intercollegiate Broadcasting
System - -West), has assisted
various college stations in their
investigation of FM broadcast
ing.
The statement concluded
with, "This situation has also
required the University to seri
ously consider its plans for
KZSU's future. We have always
received excellent co-operation
for the University, in all of
our work and projects. Stan
ford's support was invaluable
in obtaining the FM license,
and recently the administration
has been discussing with us the
various possibilities and plans
for expansion of our facilities
and services. We are confident
that some arrangement will be
made to the advantage of both
universities and radio sta
tions."
