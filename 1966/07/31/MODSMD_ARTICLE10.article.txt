# ACT's Endqame: 'Intriguing'
## 
### 
By Mark Ciabattari
Endgame by Samuel Beckett,
a late show presented by the
American Conservatory Thea
ter, is a play concerning four
pitiful people who survive a
holcaust and the ensuing de
vastation of an external hell
which threatens at every mo
ment to pervade their hell of
togetherness.
Time is running out, and there
are no more "painkillers."
A flea, a rat, and a myster
ious boy seen from the window
all threaten to renew Life. But
hope dissolves, and all that re
mains is Endgame, a reference
to a term in chess in which
play proceeds with few remain
ing pieces on the board.
All we can be sure of is the
waiting for nothing that is cen
tral to Beckett's Godot. The
waiting takes place in a mire
of irony and black humor;

Clov; Do you believe in the
life to come?
Hamm; Mine was always
that.
Time is passed by idle games

and stories.
The two main characters,
Hamm (Rene Auberjonios) and
Clov (Robin Gammel) embody
the human relationship of mas

ter and slave. Auberjonois pre
sents a worthwhile portrayal
of Hamm, the blind, insensi
tive, egocentric who is unable
to use his legs to stand up

from a chair which lie insists
must occupy the exact center
of the gray shack, their world.
This selfish man completely
dominates Clov, who wants to

leave him but must obey him.
Will Clov have the power to
leave Hamm? This is the source
of dramatic tension in the play.
As the servant, Gammel is
both amusing and pitiful. Yet
permeating this characteriza
tion are his efforts to muster
the will to leave his master.
Gammel's portrayal is convinc
ing and warrants acclaim.
However, the most intriguing
characters in the play are the
elderly man and woman who
find themselves locked in gar
bage cans only to appear in
termittantly at the whim of their
son, Hamm, who despises them.
The legless two are Nell (Joan
Croydon) and Nag (Jay Doyle.)
Canned man is man as gar
bage and a can, like the room
itself, is a closed system. El
ders in garbage cans imply can
ned memory, and the two cans
represent isolation even in
marriage.. .alone yet paired.
Although minor roles, these
two parts are well done and add
to the general excellence of the
performance.

tion are his efforts to muster
the will to leave his master.
Gammel's portrayal is convinc
ing and warrants acclaim.
However, the most intriguing
characters in the play are the
elderly man and woman who
find themselves locked in gar
bage cans only to appear in
termittantly at the whim of their
son, Hamm, who despises them.
The legless two are Nell (Joan
Croydon) and Nag (Jay Doyle.)
Canned man is man as gar
bage and a can, like the room
itself, is a closed system. El
ders in garbage cans imply can
ned memory, and the two cans
represent isolation even in
marriage.. .alone yet paired.
Although minor roles, these
two parts are well done and add
to the general excellence of the
performance.

By Mark Ciabattari
Endgame by Samuel Beckett,
a late show presented by the
American Conservatory Thea
ter, is a play concerning four
pitiful people who survive a
holcaust and the ensuing de
vastation of an external hell
which threatens at every mo
ment to pervade their hell of
togetherness.
Time is running out, and there
are no more "painkillers."
A flea, a rat, and a myster
ious boy seen from the window
all threaten to renew Life. But
hope dissolves, and all that re
mains is Endgame, a reference
to a term in chess in which
play proceeds with few remain
ing pieces on the board.
All we can be sure of is the
waiting for nothing that is cen
tral to Beckett's Godot. The
waiting takes place in a mire
of irony and black humor;

Clov; Do you believe in the
life to come?
Hamm; Mine was always
that.
Time is passed by idle games

and stories.
The two main characters,
Hamm (Rene Auberjonios) and
Clov (Robin Gammel) embody
the human relationship of mas

ter and slave. Auberjonois pre
sents a worthwhile portrayal
of Hamm, the blind, insensi
tive, egocentric who is unable
to use his legs to stand up

from a chair which lie insists
must occupy the exact center
of the gray shack, their world.
This selfish man completely
dominates Clov, who wants to

leave him but must obey him.
Will Clov have the power to
leave Hamm? This is the source
of dramatic tension in the play.
As the servant, Gammel is
both amusing and pitiful. Yet
permeating this characteriza
tion are his efforts to muster
the will to leave his master.
Gammel's portrayal is convinc
ing and warrants acclaim.
