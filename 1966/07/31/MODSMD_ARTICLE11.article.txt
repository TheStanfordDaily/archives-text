# Theatre Of The Absurd Is Seen In Albee Play
## 
### Mark Ciabattari 
One sees in "Tiny Alice,"
presented by the American Con
servatory Theater as part of
the Stanford Summer Festival,
America's greatest progress
towards a true theater of the
absurd. Playwright Edward Al
bee, with his customary force
fullness and bitter irony, has
succeeded in undermining the
premiseâ€”to believe is to know.
"Tiny Alice" is a play which
ending search for the unattain
abel. The believer never suc
combs to disillusionment be
cause the verity of his belief
will never be ascertained.
During the three acts of the
play, the viewer witnesses the
destiny of a humble, servile
lay brother unfold in a frame
work of twentieth century hell.
Each character is forced to ac
knowledge disillusionment in
futilely striving to attain a
"silent and remote" end. Be
cause we "know nothing," how
are we capable of determining
abstract ends worthy of our ef
fort? It is mere choice, itself
an invention of man, which helps
to isolate the illusory end.

The Cardinal, Harry Frazier,
is prey to selfishness and greed.
Human sentiment and "dedica
tion" undermine th e imperson
al, perfunctory task of Satan
personified, the Lawyer, played
by Ray Reinhart. The image
of the Divine, Alice (Deann
Mears) finds herself an imper
sonal puppet, unworthy of the
respect due her. Julian, (Paul
Schenar), the lay secretary to
the Cardinal, is nearly cajoled
into martyrdom. He finally
realizes that the tangible is
worthier of his sacrifice than
the spiritual.
Ironically the Butler (Al Alu),
appropriately named Butler, is
the only character who does
not transcend self to become
victim to disillusionment. Per
forming his task within a dom
estic framework, he follows in
the wake of the Lawyer and gives
advice only when asked.
Performances of the two main
roles, Julian and Miss Alice,
are excellent and mutually
spearhead the play's progres
sion. The former is at first
attentive to detail and later
ginds the foundation stones of

his faith hammered to mortar.
When this occurs, Shenar, out
of disbelief and frustration, at
tains dramatic heights in his
protest and final acquiensance.
The fleeting Miss Alice is at
once real and imaginary. As
an image, she seems heartless
and cold but only because she
personifies the impossible and
illusory end. When real, she
is a pawn of the Lawyer, but
upon occasion, at the beckon
ing of the playwright, she con
veys beautifully the human e
motions of grief, sorrow, and
despair.
Harry Frazier, the Cardinal,
convincingly personifies a re
ligious force which, through
bureaucracy, dogma, and idola
try, has foresaken its spiritual
essence.
Churlish, cruel, and yet
human to the point of self
pity, Reinhart evokes both hate
and sympathy in the viewer.
The direction is excellent and
the progression towards the
dramatic final scene is well
augmented by timely ingredi
ents which add force, emo
tion, and acceleration.
