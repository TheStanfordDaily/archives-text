# Kennedy's Farm Visit Inaccurate
## 
### Mike McDermott 
Articles and books about John
Kennedy are in super-abun
dance these days, and it is not
surprising to find that the Aug
ust issue of Esquire magazine
contains a brief reminiscence
of some events that occurred
during the fall quarter of 1940,
when Kennedy was a student at
Stanford.
Having graduated from Har
vard with a major in political
science. His future plans were
uncertain: his interest in poli
tics were undiminished, but he
appeared at the time to be head
ed for a career in business,
rather than public service.
Thomas S. Barclay, now Pro
fessor Emeritus of political
science, knew Mr. Kennedy well
at that time, probably better
than anyone else connected with
Stanford: Kennedy was a neigh
bor with whom he spoke daily,
and a student who regularly
attended his seminar on poli
tics. Professor Barclay rem
embers Kennedy as an "alert,
intelligent, well-read, and
charming" man who made
meaningful contributions to
class discussions.
An attractive and personable
young man, Kennedy had what
might be called an average
social life. The Esquire article,
written by Harry Muheim, a
Stanford junior at the time,
concerns itself mainly with this
aspect of Kennedy's stay here.
Mr. Muheim's article, how
ever, is marredby three things:
a drawing of questionable taste
appearing on the page opposite
the one on which his article
begins, for which he cannot be
held responsible; and inaccur
acies and improper statements
in the article itself, for which
only Mr. Muheim can answer.
The article pictures John
Kennedy enthralling various
students and faculty members
with his knowledge and wit at
an informal gathering held at
the home of Edgar Eugene
Robinson, a distinguished Pro

fessor of history, now Emeri
tus. All present are said to be
alternately laughing at Ken
nedy's clever remarks, and
nodding their heads in agree
ment to his astute observations.
He was, after all, an author of
national stature. At one point,
Mr. Muheim notes"...and I got
the feeling that even Edgar
Eugene Robinson was picking
up a couple of points."
Perhaps the least appropri
ate memtion of Professor Rob
inson's name occurs when Mr.
Muheim relates the chance en
counter between Kennedy and
an attractive co-ed, a Miss
Harriet Price. This section
reads, in part: "She stood on
the curb next to the car. Like
Edgar Eugene Robinson, she
was laughing delightedly at
something Jack Kennedy had
said."
Professor Robinson has told
this writer that he did not
entertain Mr. Kennedy at his
home during the latter's stay
here; in fact, he insists, he
never met Kennedy. The Es
quire article, then, has been
a source of great embarrass
ment to him, especially be
cause of the second passage
from the article quoted above.
In the interest of courtesv.

Mr. Muheim should have se
cured Professor Robinson's
permission to mention the
gathering (assuming that it had
in fact taken place in the Pro
fessor's home) before mention
ing it in his article. Such
gatherings are, after all, pri
vateâ€”not public.
Finally, in the interest of
journalistic truth, Mr. Muheim
should have telephoned Pro
fessor Robinson and others who
might remember pertinent facts
about an event that occurred st
long ago. An intelligent reader
gives full belief to very little
of what he reads, and remini
scences of this kind are of dub
ious value at best. But the
conscientious writer must take
the effort to come as close to
the truth as possible.
In a telephone discussion with
Mr. Muheim, this writer was
assured that there was "no
intention of being inaccurate
or unkind." He went on to say
that he "wrote the memoir with
a sense of responsibility, and...
attempted to be as accurate as
possible." There is no reason
to doubt any of this. In writing
this article, Mr. Muheim was
attempting to show a part of
John Kennedy's life that the
reading public probably did not
know of, and in essence, he
has succeeded. But in doing
so, he should have taken a few
prudent steps to verify the ac
curacy of his memory, in ad
dition to determining whether
the persons mentioned wanted
nationwide publicity.
