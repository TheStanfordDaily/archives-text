# Prof. Calin Claims Power Misplaced
## 
### Gordon Piper 
In just two words--misplaced
power--the feelings of Stanford
Professor William C. Calin on
the active role of the "ad
visory" Committee on Public
Excercises this summer and the
inactive role of the "autono
mous" Faculty Academic Coun
cil can be summarized.
When contacted early this
week by the Stanford Weekly,
Calin stated that the Committee
on Public Excercises had no
right to ban the ASSU film series
and he urged that university
officials pay more heed to fac
ulty opinions on this and other
matters via the Academic Coun
cil.
Calin, a distinguished mem
ber of the French Department
at Stanford, is a graduate of
Yale University. He has taught
at Dartmouth, Harvard, and
Berkely.
"The Committee on Public
Excercises has absolutely no
business censoring films,"
Calin said at the start of the
interview. "The summer film
festival is a student affair."
"I wanted to see the Genet
film, " he continued, "and
neither the Committee on Public
Excercises nor the administra
tion is qualified aesthetically
to judge artistic merit."
"If the advertisements were

in bad taste, why didn't they
just ask that the advertising
alone be modified?" Calin
asked.
"Because this was not done,"
he concluded, "the committee
interfered with the academic
freedom of students and pro
fessors."
"Whenever the academic
freedom of students a nd pro
freedom of students is infringed
on, the academic freedom of
professors is also infringed
on," Calin said.
To put an end to similar vio
lations of student and faculty
rights, Calin suggested that the
position of the Faculty Academ
ic Committee be changed. His
main criticism is that the
faculty does not have a strong
enough voice in how the univer
sity is to be run.
"Under the present system
the faculty has only advisory
power," Calin asserted.
"I consider this to be very
unfortunate," he said. "Only
thf President and the Board
of Trustees have power. If the
faculty had voted to forbid clas
sified research, the trustees
could have simply disregarded
their decision."
"I feel that the students and
faculty should make more of
the decisions," Calin con
cluded.
In improving the faculty's
influence on university matters,
a number of internal changes
would have to be made in the
organization of the Academic
Council itself, Calin stated.
The council meetings accord
ing to Calin are characterized
by inadequate debate and atten
dance. Many professors are too
busy with teaching or publishing
to come to the council meet
ings, Calin said.

unfortunate," he said. "Only
thf President and the Board
of Trustees have power. If the
faculty had voted to forbid clas
sified research, the trustees
could have simply disregarded
their decision."
"I feel that the students and
faculty should make more of
the decisions," Calin con
cluded.
In improving the faculty's
influence on university matters,
a number of internal changes
would have to be made in the
organization of the Academic
Council itself, Calin stated.
The council meetings accord
ing to Calin are characterized
by inadequate debate and atten
dance. Many professors are too
busy with teaching or publishing
to come to the council meet
ings, Calin said.
In just two words--misplaced
power--the feelings of Stanford
Professor William C. Calin on
the active role of the "ad
visory" Committee on Public
Excercises this summer and the
inactive role of the "autono
mous" Faculty Academic Coun
cil can be summarized.
When contacted early this
week by the Stanford Weekly,
Calin stated that the Committee
on Public Excercises had no
right to ban the ASSU film series
and he urged that university
officials pay more heed to fac
ulty opinions on this and other
matters via the Academic Coun
cil.
Calin, a distinguished mem
ber of the French Department
at Stanford, is a graduate of
Yale University. He has taught
at Dartmouth, Harvard, and
Berkely.
"The Committee on Public
Excercises has absolutely no
business censoring films,"
Calin said at the start of the
interview. "The summer film
festival is a student affair."
"I wanted to see the Genet
film, " he continued, "and
neither the Committee on Public
Excercises nor the administra
tion is qualified aesthetically
to judge artistic merit."
"If the advertisements were

in bad taste, why didn't they
just ask that the advertising
alone be modified?" Calin
asked.
"Because this was not done,"
he concluded, "the committee
interfered with the academic
freedom of students and pro
fessors."
"Whenever the academic
freedom of students a nd pro
freedom of students is infringed
on, the academic freedom of
professors is also infringed
on," Calin said.
To put an end to similar vio
lations of student and faculty
rights, Calin suggested that the
position of the Faculty Academ
ic Committee be changed. His
main criticism is that the
faculty does not have a strong
enough voice in how the univer
sity is to be run.
"Under the present system
the faculty has only advisory
power," Calin asserted.
"I consider this to be very
unfortunate," he said. "Only
thf President and the Board
of Trustees have power. If the
faculty had voted to forbid clas
sified research, the trustees
could have simply disregarded
their decision."
"I feel that the students and
faculty should make more of
