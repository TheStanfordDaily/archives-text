# DOTSON AND CIABATTARI ROAM GALLERIES IN S.F. AND SAUSALITO

### Jane Dotson Mark Ciabattari 
We set aside the afternoon
for a preliminary gallery tour
of the quaint Union Street area,
stopping first at the old
fashioned Rumpelstiltskin ice
cream parlor at 1980 Union for
a luncheon special—thick
chowder, a sandwich, and a rich
ice cream parfait. The ice
cream concoctions are like
those at Blum's on the Stan
ford Shopping Center. Rumpel
stilskin is open from noon un
til after midnight, and features
classic guitar recitals on Tues
day nights, as well as afternoon
snacks and late evening re
freshment.
First we saw the exhibit of
Picasso and Chagall graphics
at the Little Gallery, 1980 Un
ion, then the antiques at the
Talisman Galleries at 1906 Un
ion. The Winblad Galleries at
1814 Union were exhibiting
works by Jean Dufy and an ex
traordinary collection of Ori
ental sand painting — sea
scapes, mountain scenes, snow
and water, abstracts---all ted
iously formed from grains of
fine sand, and affixed to an
unbroken black background with
a glossy overcoat. The colors
were stark—white sand, black
background; the effect was pure,
the workmanship exquisite.
The Pantechnicon at 1849 Un
ion specializes in English an
tiques, furniture and knick
knacks. We found the Cloutier

et Cie Gallery at 1878 Union
much more appealing than the
Talisman Galleries. The Clou
tier et Cie exhibits contempor
ary folk art, and shirts, dresses
and accessories hand-woven on
the looms set up in the center
of the gallery, giving it a more
informal atmosphere than the
other Union Street galleries.
Our last stop on Union Street
was the Artists' Cooperative at
2224 Union, which shows paint
ings by local artists, many of
whom paint familiar bay area
scenes in watercolor or oil.
There was a dynamic mood to
this gallery, produced bv the ex
citement and vitality of the sel
ection of paintings, and by the
subtle side-by-side arguement
of the styles and colors of the
different artists.
For dinner we went to the
Cairo, an Armenian restaurant
at 77 Fourth Street. Our waiter
suggested leg of lamb, which
was served with stuffed cabbage
and grape leaves and for des
sert, a rich pastry with honey
and almonds and strong, bitter
Armenian coffee. The decor of
the Cairo is simple yet roman
tic—the enclosed booths are
painted black, and the table
arrangements of candles and
daisies are reflected in mirrors
on the wall. The complete din
ner was $2.25 apiece.

Saturday, July 23

Crossed the bay toSausalito
for brunch on the waterfront
at the Trident on Bridgeway
Avenue. The eggs Benedict and
the view of the yacht harbor
were equally fine. We strolled
along Bridgeway and visited a
cooperative for local artists.
The manager explained that art
ists brought their work in for
approval (few were turned down)
and stated the price they wanted
for each drawing, painting, or
sculpture. The co-op marks this
figure up one third to save the
artist a display price while
keeping the shop in business.
The price range here is from
$15 to $150, and I saw several
drawings for as little as $25
that would look good in m y
apartment.
In the center of a grassy
"town square" at the end of
Bridgeway, we saw a group of
Negro bongo drummers, drip
ping in the afternoon heat as
they increased in volume and
accelerated their drumbeats.
The notes followed one after
another so rapidly that they
merged into a merciless cres
cendo. Some of the drummers
had removed their shirts, and
each one seemed to be im
mersed in a personal rhythm,
oblivious to the large, casually
dressed audience they had at
tracted.

Next we stopped in at the
Tides bookstore (also on
Bridgeway)long enough to by
Bridgeway) long enough to buy
a few novels, listen to the owner
exchange several tongue-in
cheek remarks with a middle
aged tourist, and buy a cup
of coffee at a little stand just
inside the door.
Suddenly it was six o'clock,
and it was as if the whole town
had run down. An unexpected
calm filled the streets, most
of the shops and little coffee
places closed, and I could al
most hear the ocean. Most of
the tourists had filed into the
larger, more expensive bars
and restaurants. We stopped at
a liquor store and a delicates
san, settled at an outdoor table
on the third floor of the Vil
lage Fair shopping center,
drank champagne out of paper
cups and enjoyed a quiet view
of the ocean.
