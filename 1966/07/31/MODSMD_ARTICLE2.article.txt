# No Action Taken On Open House Rules
## 
### 
The recommendation from
the Committee of Fifteen on
open house hours will not be
acted on this quarter.
The report was submitted
to President Wallace Sterling
after the Committee's June 15
meeting. According to Donald
Carlson, the assistant to the
president, there has been no
action on the report because
"The president has been ex
ceedingly busy this summer."
Earlier this year the Legis
lature passed new open house
hours. Visiting hours in men's
and women's dormitories were
set from noon to midnight Mon
day through Friday and noon to
2:30 a.m. on the weekends with
the provision that each living
group may restrict these hours.
However, the University will
officially recognize only its own
hours, 7 to 11 p.m. on Wed
nesday and Friday and 1 to 5
p.m. Sunday.
The Committee of Fifteen
also selected a subcommittee to
study the open house hours when
the report was made available.
One member of the sub
committee, Prof. John R. Mc-
Donough, told Hie Weekly, "I
have never received a copy of
the report."
Action is also pending on the
open house hours violation by
two students, Mike Couzens and
Charlotte Ackerly. The two vio
lated the University's rules,
while staying within the ASSU

rules, in order to create a test
case.
In a special telephone inter
view, Couzens said that he will
plead not guilty when the case
is tried in September—if it is
tried at all. "I don't think that
the case will ever come up.
It appears now that the policy

will be changed," he said.
"Anachronistic seems to be the
favorite word for describing the
University's open house regula
tions," Couzens continued. He
backs the ASSU open house
rules, saying, "They're well
thought out and documented with
a hefty report."
