# Berkeley FM Station Discussed
## 
### Daniel C. Smith 
While it is clear that the
application of the University of
California for an FM station in
Berkeley jeopardizes plans for
KZSU to raise power, Cal is
legally and technically entitled
to the proposed station.
KZSU now serves Stanford,
and parts of Palo Alto, Menlo
Park and Atherton with a usually
reliable signal. Within this area
a 10-watt station in Berkeley
(even if its effective power were
50 watts) would not cause any
interference because the nature
of FM reception is such that an
interfering station must be at
least one quarter as strong as
the desired station before any
destructive interference can be
noted.
Within the limited(3-smiles)
primary coverage area, sta
tions in Berkeley and at Stanford
would cause each other no inter
ference. Arguments for or
against broadcast licenses can
not be made on the basis of
freak reception in areas well
removed from the primary cov
erage area, especially when this
reception is made by only a very
few listeners who often have un
usual equipment.
If KZSU had been designed to
cover Berkeley, a much bigger
transmitter and better antenna
and location would have been
selected. A licensee cannot op
pose a station on the grounds
that it may prevent a later in
crease in power by an existing
station.
At the time of the KZSU appli
cation, the possibility of a Bay
Area conference of educational
broadcasters was proposed.
This conference would have at
tempted to arange the FM
spectrum in such a way that the
present Cal-Stanford situation
would not have occurred.
It was known at the time that
sooner or later Cal-Berkeley
would apply for a station since
there were interested students
and Cal-Santa Barbara had an
application on file.
Now would be an appropriate
time to try to arrange a con
ference to deal with frequency
allocation. It is also only a
matter of time before KPFB
(operated by KPFA as a filler
transmitter) must be given up
by Pacifica Foundation. Owner
ship of two FM stations in a
major market would probably
not be upheld if contested with
the FCC.
Regardless of how correct
Cal may have been in filing for
a 10-watt license, the fact that
they did not inform Stanford
suggests an attempt to sneak
something through in the sum
mer.
Other institutions in the Bay
Area want FM stations, too.
Unless thp educational broad
casters of the B?.y Area get
together soon, much ill-feeling
will develop between them. If a
shuffling of frequency assign
ments could be made, there will
be room for more stations and
at high power levels.
