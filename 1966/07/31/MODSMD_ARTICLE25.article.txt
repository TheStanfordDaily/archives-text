# $5 Million Program Planned For Hoover
## 
### 
The start of a $5 million
program for long-term
financial support of the Hoover
Institution on War, Revolution
and Peace was announced Wed
nesday at a meeting of the In
stitution's Advisory Board on
campus.

The program was authorized
by the University's Board of
Trustees in March of this year.
Stressing the timeliness of
the new fund, Allan Hoover and
Herbert Hoover Jr., sons of
former President Hoover,
stated that the present obscur
ity of "common elements from
which to build a lasting peace
and order among nations ...
makes more important than
ever the Hoover Institution's
essential task of maintaining
historical perspective in the
scholarly study of current
national and international
problems."
Stanford President J. E. Wal
lace Sterling, who presided at
the Advisory Board's meeting,
added that the Institution "is
justly renowned as a treasure
house of records and informa
tion for those who would study
and ponder the movements and
'isms' of this century. There

is both need and opportunity
further to enhance its work;
it is to meet the need and to
seize the opportunity that ad
ditional financial support is now,
being sought."
Institution Director Dr. Glenn
Campbell disclosed that
amounts "in excess of;
$G00,000" are already in hand
and would "form the nucleus of
the new fund." Of these sums,
Campbell said, $500,000 rep
resents an earlier, undesig
nated grant to the Institution
from the University's Board
pf Trustees.
