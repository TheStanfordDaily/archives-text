# 3 Year Eng. Experiment
## 
### 
The English department will
sponsor a radical new three
year experiment in freshman
English this fall, involving 100
freshmen to be taught in groups
of 20 by professional writers
who are also teachers.
This experimental program,
known as the "Voice Project,"
is unique in two ways-.
It brings an inter-university
group of teachers to a single
university, and it brings teach
ers who are professional wri
ters to the freshman English
course rather than to advanced
creative writing classes.
Each writer will devote his
entire teaching time to 20 fresh
men. Five Stanford graduate
students, several of them also
creative writers, will assist
with the program.
The Voice Project will study
ways of teaching writing more
effectively by making students
more aware of the relationship
between the speaking voice and
the "voice " that one finds
in the work of most good
writers.
