# Student Designs Pogo-Prop
## 
### 
Starting from an idea for a
one-man submarine, a Stanford
engineering student stripped it
to bare essentials and designed
the "Pogo-Prop," a handy new
underwater propulsion unit for
skin divers.
"The SCUBA diver needs an
inexpensive, lightweight and ef
ficient means of propelling him
self to extend his time, range,
and maneuverability under
water," says designer Stephen
K. Rush.
His Pogo-Prop, which works
something like an underwater
pogo stick, should do the job.
He has proved its efficiency
with a simplified working mo
del, and has built a mock-up
model showing how the finished
gear would look.
It consists of a small tank
from which a long propeller
protrudes. Opposite sides of the
tank are indented to fit snugly
between the diver's calves, and
a wide strap binds legs and tank
together. Foot rests and a pro
peller guard complete the unit.
The tank houses a small elec
tric motor, and power comes
from a belt of compact wet
cell batteries around the diver's
waist.
"This gear can propel a man
underwater at 2.5 miles per
hour for as long as an hour
and 15 minutes," said Rush.
"He can change his speed by
means of a variable switch."
With the Pogo-Prop, both the
diver's hands remain free.
Many lightweight propulsion
units require the diver to hold
on with one or both hands, Rush
pointed out. Others, usually at
tached to his back, throw the
diver off-balance and are ex
tremely awkward to handle
out of water.
"Since the diver generally

wades through the surf to get
in, it is important to be able
to handle the equipment easily
without danger of the surf
throwing it or him about," the
student engineer added.
Rush thinks his Pogo-Prop
could be manufactured and sold
for about $200, considerably
under the $350 to $1000 price
tags of other propulsion sy
stems. Tank unit and battery
belt would each weigh around
30 pounds, and their total of
about 60 pounds makes Pogo
prop about the lightest system
yet.
Dividing the weight between
waist and legs improves the

diver's underwater form and
maneuverability, Rush claims.
His is the first system to sep
arate motor and power supply,
which he connects with standard
waterproof cable and plugs.
Nearly all the unit's parts are
stock items, in fact, which the
young engineer says keeps the
cost down. He is still hunting
for a one-third horsepower mo
tor that will operate on a 12-
volt current, however, which he
believes would comprise the
ideal system.
So far Rush has made no
manufacturing plans for his
Pogo-Prop system, but he has
met strong interest and re-

ceived encouragement from
diving and underwater experts
with whom he has discussed it.
He developed the system for
a class in product design taught
by Design Prof. Robert Mc-
Kim, Engineering Prof. Henry
Fuchs, and Art Prof. Matt Kahn.
Rush expects to complete his
work for a master's degree in
mechanical engineering next
fall before being called to active
duty as a Navy ensign. In the
meantime he is a researchas
sistant in medical electronics
at the Palo Alto Medical Re
search Foundation.

and 15 minutes," said Rush.
"He can change his speed by
means of a variable switch."
With the Pogo-Prop, both the
diver's hands remain free.
Many lightweight propulsion
units require the diver to hold
on with one or both hands, Rush
pointed out. Others, usually at
tached to his back, throw the
diver off-balance and are ex
tremely awkward to handle
out of water.
"Since the diver generally

wades through the surf to get
in, it is important to be able
to handle the equipment easily
without danger of the surf
throwing it or him about," the
student engineer added.
Rush thinks his Pogo-Prop
could be manufactured and sold
for about $200, considerably
under the $350 to $1000 price
tags of other propulsion sy
stems. Tank unit and battery
belt would each weigh around
30 pounds, and their total of
about 60 pounds makes Pogo
prop about the lightest system
yet.
Dividing the weight between
waist and legs improves the

diver's underwater form and
maneuverability, Rush claims.
His is the first system to sep
arate motor and power supply,
which he connects with standard
waterproof cable and plugs.
Nearly all the unit's parts are
stock items, in fact, which the
young engineer says keeps the
cost down. He is still hunting
for a one-third horsepower mo
tor that will operate on a 12-
volt current, however, which he
believes would comprise the
ideal system.
So far Rush has made no
manufacturing plans for his
Pogo-Prop system, but he has
met strong interest and re-

ceived encouragement from
diving and underwater experts
with whom he has discussed it.
He developed the system for
a class in product design taught
by Design Prof. Robert Mc-
Kim, Engineering Prof. Henry
Fuchs, and Art Prof. Matt Kahn.
Rush expects to complete his
work for a master's degree in
mechanical engineering next
fall before being called to active
duty as a Navy ensign. In the
meantime he is a researchas
sistant in medical electronics
at the Palo Alto Medical Re
search Foundation.


POGO-PROP underwater propulsion unit for skin divers is
shown off by its skin-diving inventor, Stanford Engineering
student Stephen K. Rush. Design model shown is a mock-up,
but Rush has proved its efficiency with a simpler working
model. Production model of the Pogo-Prop would weigh about
60 pounds, could propel a man underwater at 2.5 mph for 75
minutes, and cost about $200, Rush believes.
Starting from an idea for a
one-man submarine, a Stanford
engineering student stripped it
to bare essentials and designed
the "Pogo-Prop," a handy new
underwater propulsion unit for
skin divers.
"The SCUBA diver needs an
inexpensive, lightweight and ef
ficient means of propelling him
self to extend his time, range,
and maneuverability under
water," says designer Stephen
K. Rush.
His Pogo-Prop, which works
something like an underwater
pogo stick, should do the job.
He has proved its efficiency
with a simplified working mo
del, and has built a mock-up
model showing how the finished
gear would look.
It consists of a small tank
from which a long propeller
protrudes. Opposite sides of the
tank are indented to fit snugly
between the diver's calves, and
a wide strap binds legs and tank
together. Foot rests and a pro
peller guard complete the unit.
The tank houses a small elec
tric motor, and power comes
from a belt of compact wet
cell batteries around the diver's
waist.
"This gear can propel a man
underwater at 2.5 miles per
hour for as long as an hour
and 15 minutes," said Rush.
