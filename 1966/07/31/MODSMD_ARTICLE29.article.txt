# Birchard's Diatribe
## 
### Perry Lee Birchard 
During this Summer quarter,
this column has steadily main
tained a near-nihilistic tone.
But all good (or bad) things
must come to an end, and the
terminus is here. A cup of
chocolat au rhum has mellowed
us.
The Summer ASSU has opened
the AS SUCH Coffee House. It
is not the kind of horrendous
den of inequity (may Sally Stan
ford save us) that'coffeehouse'
normally connotes.
Tresidder is notorious for
having a little food for a lot,
and for closing at unhuman
hours so they can make their
doughnuts in peace. Tresidder,
because it is 'controlled' by
a benevolent university, is not
subject to student whims like
the hours it stays open. It is
also like much of the rest of
Stanford; dull and alienating.
As Such is a relaxed. Infor
mal place with REAL music
and people, a place to dance,

and cozy places to sit inside
and out.
Workers are student volun
teers who get a sandwich and
whatever they can drink as
wages for four hours of labor
(and the farm laborers com
plain!). This is because As
Such is having a rough time
getting started. Getting pub
licity is difficult and expensive.
Word of mouth is a slow way
to dray crowds in an institu
tion where people rarely say
even 'Please, thank you, you're
welcome, I'm sorry, do you
like to make love?'. And where
the first thing people seem
to need to be able to social
ize is a glass (or bottle) of
liquor or a Huxley's Happy Pill.
Will we take advantage of it,
or are we—as this column has
suggested all along-- too de
humanized to know what being
human is and to androidic to
desire humanity?
