# Frequency Sought By Berkeley
## 
### Steve Gruber 
KAL, the campus radio sta
tion at Berkeley, has applied
for the same frequency as the
Stanford radio station, KZSU,
a radio - television trade jour
nal, Broadcasting, revealed last
week.
The announcement may bring
a protest to the FCC from
University officials.
KAL applied for an FM li
cense on 90.1 megacycles, pre
sently KZSU's frequency. Both
stations would have ten watts
of power and neither would
interfere with the other,
according to the KAL applica
tion.
However, Don Piatt, acting
station manager for KZSU,dis
agrees, "Due to 'skip condi
tions' on the bay, our signal
reaches as far as Berkeley,
Oakland, and other East Bay
locations that are in line of sight
across the bay," Piatt claimed.
In an exclusive interview with
The Weekly, R. A. Isberg, a
communications engineer for
the University of California,
said, "There will be no de
structive interference with
KZSU. We informally ap
proached the FCC about pos
sible interference and they said
that there would be none."
Piatt says that this is not
the case. "If all that you do is
work out the statistics, you will
find that there is no inter
ference. But is you consider the
actual range of our transmitter
and antenna, you will come to
a different conclusion.
"Letters have been received
from listeners in San Jase,
Oakland, and Berkeley, saying
that they are picking up KZSU,"
Piatt added.
Isberg said that KAL's pro
posed FM transmitter will be
located in Dwinelle Hall and
the antenna will be on the roof.
It will be under the control
of the Chancellor, who will be
responsible for programming
and technical standards.
KAL could have applied for
KPFB's frequency, Isberg re
vealed, but Berkeley did not
want to get involved in a public
hearing.
Iron;cally, Berkeley could be
the principle participant in a
FCC hearing if Stanford goes
through with its protest.
Lyle Nelson, Director of Un
iversity Relations for Stanford,
said that he will make a re
commendation to the University
attorneys that they file a pro -
test.
"KAL applied for 90.1 mega
cycles because it was the only
frequency available," Nelson
said, "But the skip conditions
will cause interference with
KZSU."
The protest must be filed
within 90 days of the date of
the application and must show
parts of the administration. He
further stated he did not mean
to attribute CPE decisions to
rumors of Santa Clara County
action.
Earlier in the week LASSU
met to pass a resolution pro
testing the delay in President
Sterling's approval of an ASSU
film series minus "Un Chant
d' Amour". The delay left
too little time for a series.
Sterling informally announced
on July 22 his approval of an
unofficial student proposal
made to CPE on July 6. Don
Carlson, acting Asst. to the
President said, "The second
student proposal might have
been acted upon sooner had not
the films been shown at the I-
Center and ASSU Office."
The Board of Trustees heard
a report on the film question but
took no action in their meeting
of Jily 21.

KAL, the campus radio sta
tion at Berkeley, has applied
for the same frequency as the
Stanford radio station, KZSU,
a radio - television trade jour
nal, Broadcasting, revealed last
week.
The announcement may bring
a protest to the FCC from
University officials.
KAL applied for an FM li
cense on 90.1 megacycles, pre
sently KZSU's frequency. Both
stations would have ten watts
of power and neither would
interfere with the other,
according to the KAL applica
tion.
However, Don Piatt, acting
station manager for KZSU,dis
agrees, "Due to 'skip condi
tions' on the bay, our signal
reaches as far as Berkeley,
Oakland, and other East Bay
locations that are in line of sight
across the bay," Piatt claimed.
In an exclusive interview with
The Weekly, R. A. Isberg, a
communications engineer for
the University of California,
said, "There will be no de
structive interference with
KZSU. We informally ap
proached the FCC about pos
sible interference and they said
that there would be none."
Piatt says that this is not
the case. "If all that you do is
work out the statistics, you will
find that there is no inter
ference. But is you consider the
actual range of our transmitter
and antenna, you will come to
a different conclusion.
"Letters have been received
from listeners in San Jase,
Oakland, and Berkeley, saying
that they are picking up KZSU,"
Piatt added.
Isberg said that KAL's pro
posed FM transmitter will be
located in Dwinelle Hall and
the antenna will be on the roof.
It will be under the control
of the Chancellor, who will be
responsible for programming
and technical standards.
KAL could have applied for
KPFB's frequency, Isberg re
vealed, but Berkeley did not
want to get involved in a public
hearing.
Iron;cally, Berkeley could be
the principle participant in a
FCC hearing if Stanford goes
through with its protest.
Lyle Nelson, Director of Un
iversity Relations for Stanford,
said that he will make a re
commendation to the University
attorneys that they file a pro -
test.
"KAL applied for 90.1 mega
cycles because it was the only
frequency available," Nelson
said, "But the skip conditions
will cause interference with
KZSU."
The protest must be filed
within 90 days of the date of
the application and must show
parts of the administration. He
further stated he did not mean
to attribute CPE decisions to
rumors of Santa Clara County
action.
