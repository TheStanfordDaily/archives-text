# Comic Collector Says Batman TV Show Has Had "Terrible Effect"
## 
### Steve Gruber Editor 
"The effect of the Batman television show on the Batman
comic book has been terrible," according to Jack Marchese,
comic book collector and 1960 Stanford graduate.
Marchese does not claim to be the authority on comic
books, but his credentials are impressive. He has approxi
mately 1000 comic books in his collection (300 of which are
Marval comics), he has been seriously studying comics for
four years, and he was president of the Stanford chapter of

the Merry Marval Marching
Society.
He is an avid fan of the
Marval comics, claiming that
they attempt to appeal more to
the college age group. "The
Marval age started in 1962 with
The Fantastic Four," Marchese
said, "Marval comic books are
comic books in the same sense
as in the old days."
"The Batman comic book is
no longer worth buying or read
ing," Marchese continued.
"Donald Duck was not worth
reading past 1957. Uncle Scro
oge was not worthwhile after
1961."
Marchese explained that, at
one time, Donald Duck comics
were educational in the sense
that Donald made trips to
foreign countries. "It was a
good geography lesson," lie
said.
He calculates that, in the right
circles, his collection would be
worth about $1500. Marchese
and his comic books have been
mentioned in the National Ob
server. They will also appear

in a picture in the September
edition of Esquire magazine.
According to Mirchese, Mar
val comics do not aim toward
the eight year old audience.
"Much of the stuff in Marval
comics is too subtle for eight
year olds," he said.
Marval features such biz
zarre characters as the Incred
ible Hulk, The Fantastic Four
(The Thing, The Human Torch,
The Invisible Girl, Mr. Fantas
tic), Spider-Man, Sergeant Fury
and His Howling Commandos,
Dr. Strange. The Mighty Thor,
and The X-Men. Marchese's
favorite is The Amazing Spider-
Man.
He says that Marval is so
popular with college students
because it takes a tongue-in
cheek approach to super
heroes. "The characters have
real problems and they are also
college students," Marchese
added. Interestingly enough,
started out as a
high school student. Now he is
attending college.
