Rand makes them
...but you've made them classics! 4
If there are All-Ameriean college classics
in men's shoes, they include the styles
you're looking at: the long-wing brogue, JLJÂ®
from $16-$25, and the handsewn-vamp |KT3P
Trujuns, from $ 15-$ 18. A wardrobe with
out them is hardly a wardrobe, especially
on campus. (Take it from Rand!)
