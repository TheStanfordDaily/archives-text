# In Wilbur: Only The Names Have Changed
## 
### STEVE GRUBER 
It was a big day for freshman Jeff
Pendergraft Wednesday.
It was the day that he officially
started his work at Stanford which he
hopes will lead to a Political Science
degree in June, 1970.
Pendergraft and 1200 of his class
mates flooded the campus Wednesday,
moving into Wilbur, Stern, Branner,
and Roble. Pre-reg committee mem
bers scurried around, carrying bags
and helping the confused.
Clearly not frightened by the ap
parent chaos, Pendergraft drove in
from his home town, San Jose, at
about 9:15 a.m. As he walked through
the door of Soto House, his home for
the next nine months, he was met by
Dr. John Chowning, the faculty resi
dent, Scott Soames, the Wilbur Head
Sponsor, and this reporter—in that
order.
Following that reception, Pender

graft met two more upperclassmen,
Gene Borkan, his first floor sponsor,
and Bob Rosen, the Graduate Tutor
for Soto. He must have been wonder
ing where the other freshmen were.
He quickly found some, though, as he
walked down the hall to his room.
New Locks
As part of the Wilbur Hall refur
nishing program, new locks had been
installed in several of the doors, and
naturally Jeff's key was not able to
open the door. Rosen quickly came to
his rescue, unlocking the door to re
veal the typical Wilbur room. Four
walls, two beds, two desks, and two
chairs —what more could you want?
His roommate was nowhere to be
seen. But his name, Dave Stevens,
was hanging on the door.
Pendergraft started the job of un
packing by bringing in his bags, set
ting them in the middle of the room,
and sitting down and staring at them.

"I think I'll leave it for later," he
said.
He turned to the time schedule
which had been left on his desk by
the Wilbur Hall staff. The lists of de
partments and odd-looking symbols
do not lend themselves to instant
comprehension, however, and he left
the time schedule until Sunday when
he will have to pre-register with his
advisor.
This was not his first contact with
a college environment. He attended
the University of California at Santa
Barbara this summer, taking intro
ductory English and psychology.
Clark Jorden, one of Jeff's fellow
Soto residents, walked in and intro
duced himself. Jorden had just driven
from Fullerton, in Southern Califor
nia.
After Jorden left, Pendergraft de
cided to face his luggage. After a few
minutes, his roommate, Dave Stevens
came in, holding the stack of mimeo

graphed information that the Wilbur
office gives each frwhman.
Trunk Hunt
The always-present sponsor, Gene
Borkan, followed Stevens into the
room, and introduced himself. Then
the three of them started the search
for Stevens' trunk which had arrived
at Wilbur several days before from
Massachusetts. They found it in the
lounge and the two new roommates
carried back to their room.
Wilbur Hall maintains a policy of
attempting to match roommates with
different backgrounds. For example,
Pendergraft is from California, Stev
ens is from out of state. Pendergraft
went to a public school (Lee High
School in San Jose) and Stevens at
tended a prep school (Governor Dum
mer in Massachusetts.)
Harris
This reporter asked both freshmen
if they knew who Dave Harris was.
Pendergraft had heard of Har
ris and obviously disliked him,
saying, "I won't tell you what
I think of him if you're going
to print it in The Daily." Stev
ens did not recognize the name
until he was reminded that Har
ris will be the student body
president this year. "Oh, you
mean the guy with the beard,"
he said. He had seen his picture
and an article about him in a
recent edition of Time maga
zine.
The unpacking continued.
Most of the floor space was
taken up by the trunk and suit
cases now. Pendergraft seemed
surprised at the amount of
space available in the closets,
but he managed to get every
thing into them.
Borkan came in again and
mentioned to Pendergraft that
having his picture in The Daily
would make him famous and
enrich his dating life at Stan

ford. Pendergraft doesn't plan
to jump headfirst into the fresh
man social program, however,
because he has a steady date in
San Jose and a car with which
to get there.
He thumbed through the list
of freshmen in Soto, stopping at
Richard Fink's name. "I think I
know that guy," he said. A few
minutes later he went upstairs
and found that he did know
Fink, having gone to school
with him nine years ago.
Pendergraft and Stevens went
outside to a table set up in the
courtyard where coffee and
doughnuts were being served
and talked to their tutor, Bob
Rosen. He told them about the
activities planned for the day,
including convocation at 5 p.m.
and a house meeting after din
ner. When they asked him why
the house meeting would be
held, he explained its purpose
as mainly an introduction to the
University's rules and regula
tions.
Lunch was served and both
freshmen forgot their meal

tickets. After going back to
their rooms to retrieve the
tickets, they went through the
line and were greeted by a typi
cal Wilbur lunch, coldcuts. As
this reporter left them, they
seemed to be enjoying it.

was hanging on the door.
Pendergraft started the job of un
packing by bringing in his bags, set
ting them in the middle of the room,
and sitting down and staring at them.

"I think I'll leave it for later," he
said.
He turned to the time schedule
which had been left on his desk by
the Wilbur Hall staff. The lists of de
partments and odd-looking symbols
do not lend themselves to instant
comprehension, however, and he left
the time schedule until Sunday when
he will have to pre-register with his
advisor.
This was not his first contact with
a college environment. He attended
the University of California at Santa
Barbara this summer, taking intro
ductory English and psychology.
Clark Jorden, one of Jeff's fellow
Soto residents, walked in and intro
duced himself. Jorden had just driven
from Fullerton, in Southern Califor
nia.
After Jorden left, Pendergraft de
cided to face his luggage. After a few
minutes, his roommate, Dave Stevens
came in, holding the stack of mimeo

graphed information that the Wilbur
office gives each frwhman.
Trunk Hunt
The always-present sponsor, Gene
Borkan, followed Stevens into the
room, and introduced himself. Then
the three of them started the search
for Stevens' trunk which had arrived
at Wilbur several days before from
Massachusetts. They found it in the
lounge and the two new roommates
carried back to their room.
Wilbur Hall maintains a policy of
attempting to match roommates with
different backgrounds. For example,
Pendergraft is from California, Stev
ens is from out of state. Pendergraft
went to a public school (Lee High
School in San Jose) and Stevens at
tended a prep school (Governor Dum
mer in Massachusetts.)
Harris
This reporter asked both freshmen
if they knew who Dave Harris was.
Pendergraft had heard of Har
ris and obviously disliked him,
saying, "I won't tell you what
I think of him if you're going
to print it in The Daily." Stev
ens did not recognize the name
until he was reminded that Har
ris will be the student body
president this year. "Oh, you
mean the guy with the beard,"
he said. He had seen his picture
and an article about him in a
recent edition of Time maga
zine.
The unpacking continued.
Most of the floor space was
taken up by the trunk and suit
cases now. Pendergraft seemed
surprised at the amount of
space available in the closets,
but he managed to get every
thing into them.
Borkan came in again and
mentioned to Pendergraft that
having his picture in The Daily
would make him famous and
enrich his dating life at Stan

ford. Pendergraft doesn't plan
to jump headfirst into the fresh
man social program, however,
because he has a steady date in
San Jose and a car with which
to get there.
He thumbed through the list
of freshmen in Soto, stopping at
Richard Fink's name. "I think I
know that guy," he said. A few
minutes later he went upstairs
and found that he did know
Fink, having gone to school
with him nine years ago.
Pendergraft and Stevens went
outside to a table set up in the
courtyard where coffee and
doughnuts were being served
and talked to their tutor, Bob
Rosen. He told them about the
activities planned for the day,
including convocation at 5 p.m.
and a house meeting after din
ner. When they asked him why
the house meeting would be
held, he explained its purpose
as mainly an introduction to the
University's rules and regula
tions.
Lunch was served and both
freshmen forgot their meal

tickets. After going back to
their rooms to retrieve the
tickets, they went through the
line and were greeted by a typi
cal Wilbur lunch, coldcuts. As
this reporter left them, they
seemed to be enjoying it.

ens is from out of state. Pendergraft
went to a public school (Lee High
School in San Jose) and Stevens at
tended a prep school (Governor Dum
mer in Massachusetts.)
Harris
This reporter asked both freshmen
if they knew who Dave Harris was.
Pendergraft had heard of Har
ris and obviously disliked him,
saying, "I won't tell you what
I think of him if you're going
to print it in The Daily." Stev
ens did not recognize the name
until he was reminded that Har
ris will be the student body
president this year. "Oh, you
mean the guy with the beard,"
he said. He had seen his picture
and an article about him in a
recent edition of Time maga
zine.
The unpacking continued.
Most of the floor space was
taken up by the trunk and suit
cases now. Pendergraft seemed
surprised at the amount of
space available in the closets,
but he managed to get every
thing into them.
Borkan came in again and
mentioned to Pendergraft that
having his picture in The Daily
would make him famous and
enrich his dating life at Stan

ford. Pendergraft doesn't plan
to jump headfirst into the fresh
man social program, however,
because he has a steady date in
San Jose and a car with which
to get there.
He thumbed through the list
of freshmen in Soto, stopping at
Richard Fink's name. "I think I
know that guy," he said. A few
minutes later he went upstairs
and found that he did know
Fink, having gone to school
with him nine years ago.
Pendergraft and Stevens went
outside to a table set up in the
courtyard where coffee and
doughnuts were being served
and talked to their tutor, Bob
Rosen. He told them about the
activities planned for the day,
including convocation at 5 p.m.
and a house meeting after din
ner. When they asked him why
the house meeting would be
held, he explained its purpose
as mainly an introduction to the
University's rules and regula
tions.
Lunch was served and both
freshmen forgot their meal

tickets. After going back to
their rooms to retrieve the
tickets, they went through the
line and were greeted by a typi
cal Wilbur lunch, coldcuts. As
this reporter left them, they
seemed to be enjoying it.

It was a big day for freshman Jeff
Pendergraft Wednesday.
It was the day that he officially
started his work at Stanford which he
hopes will lead to a Political Science
degree in June, 1970.
Pendergraft and 1200 of his class
mates flooded the campus Wednesday,
moving into Wilbur, Stern, Branner,
and Roble. Pre-reg committee mem
bers scurried around, carrying bags
and helping the confused.
Clearly not frightened by the ap
parent chaos, Pendergraft drove in
from his home town, San Jose, at
about 9:15 a.m. As he walked through
the door of Soto House, his home for
the next nine months, he was met by
Dr. John Chowning, the faculty resi
dent, Scott Soames, the Wilbur Head
Sponsor, and this reporter—in that
order.
Following that reception, Pender

graft met two more upperclassmen,
Gene Borkan, his first floor sponsor,
and Bob Rosen, the Graduate Tutor
for Soto. He must have been wonder
ing where the other freshmen were.
He quickly found some, though, as he
walked down the hall to his room.
New Locks
As part of the Wilbur Hall refur
nishing program, new locks had been
installed in several of the doors, and
naturally Jeff's key was not able to
open the door. Rosen quickly came to
his rescue, unlocking the door to re
veal the typical Wilbur room. Four
walls, two beds, two desks, and two
chairs —what more could you want?
His roommate was nowhere to be
seen. But his name, Dave Stevens,
was hanging on the door.
Pendergraft started the job of un
packing by bringing in his bags, set
ting them in the middle of the room,
and sitting down and staring at them.

"I think I'll leave it for later," he
said.
He turned to the time schedule
which had been left on his desk by
the Wilbur Hall staff. The lists of de
partments and odd-looking symbols
do not lend themselves to instant
comprehension, however, and he left
the time schedule until Sunday when
he will have to pre-register with his
advisor.
This was not his first contact with
a college environment. He attended
the University of California at Santa
Barbara this summer, taking intro
ductory English and psychology.
Clark Jorden, one of Jeff's fellow
Soto residents, walked in and intro
duced himself. Jorden had just driven
from Fullerton, in Southern Califor
nia.
After Jorden left, Pendergraft de
cided to face his luggage. After a few
minutes, his roommate, Dave Stevens
came in, holding the stack of mimeo

graphed information that the Wilbur
office gives each frwhman.
Trunk Hunt
The always-present sponsor, Gene
Borkan, followed Stevens into the
room, and introduced himself. Then
the three of them started the search
for Stevens' trunk which had arrived
at Wilbur several days before from
Massachusetts. They found it in the
lounge and the two new roommates
carried back to their room.
Wilbur Hall maintains a policy of
attempting to match roommates with
different backgrounds. For example,
Pendergraft is from California, Stev
ens is from out of state. Pendergraft
went to a public school (Lee High
School in San Jose) and Stevens at
tended a prep school (Governor Dum
