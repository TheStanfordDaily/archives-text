# Novelist John Hawkes Heads 'Voice Project' For Frosh
## 
### DICK LIVINGSTON Asst. Managing Editor 
One hundred members of the
Class of '70 have been selected
to participate hi what the Eng
lish Department calls "a radical
new experiment in freshman
English this fall."
"Voice Project" is unique in
two ways: first, it brings to
Stanford an inter-university
group of teachers cooperating in
a common program; second, it
brings noted professional writ
ers to a freshman course rather
than to advanced creative writ
ing classes.
The first year of the project
is supported by a $177,000 con
tract with the U.S. Office of Ed
ucation.
Central to the "Voice Project"
will be the study of ways of
teaching writing more effective

ly by making students more
aware of the relationship be
tween the speaking voice and
the "voice" one finds in the
work of most good writers.
The 100 freshmen chosen for
the "Voice Program" were se
lected at random from the more
than 50C who expressed interest
in the program.
Director of the project is John
Hawkes, a novelist from Brown
University. Among his works
are The Cannibal, The Beetle
Leg, The Lime Twig and Goose
on the Grave. His latest novel,
Second Skin, was nominated for
the National Book Award.
Teaching Time
Each of five writers will de
vote his entire teaching time to
a section of 20 freshmen.
Joining Hawkes on the fall
quarter staff will be Sylvia
Berkman, a short story writer
from Wellesley College; Jerome
Charyn, a novelist and short
story writer from Stanford; Leo
Litwak, a novelist and short
story writer from San Francisco
State and Clive Miller a novelist
from Stanford.
Other writer-teachers this year
will be William Alfred, Harvard;
Mitchell Goodman, City College
of New York and Mark Mirsky,
Stanford and formerly of the
City College of New York. Shir
ley Clark is the Administrative
Assistant for the project.
Advice from "New Math"
The "Voice Project" developed
as the result of discussions
among writer-teachers and has
benefited by the advice of those
associated with the "new math"
and "new physics" programs.
Members of the "Voice" proj
ect will also serve as members
of the freshman English staff.
They will be regularly available
for consultation by students who
are not enrolled in the program.
The program will also con
sider the relationship of "voice"
and style to personality, role,
subject and audience, according
to Albert Guerard, director of
the freshman English program
and one of the originators of the
experimental program.
Another feature of "Voice"
will be seminars with the pro
gram's consultants. The Univer
sity will sponsor the sessions
in the evening and open them
to the public. Hawkes said.
Initial consultants are novelist
John Barth and Jerome Bruner,
a Harvard psychologist.
Semi-Tutorial
Students enrolled in "Voice"
will not take regular freshman
English. The small sections are
designed to develop a "semi-tu
torial" relationship between the
writer-teacher and the student,
Hawkes explained. He added
that grading will be on a de
ferred basis.
Writing in the classes will be
based in a large part on the in
terests and activities of the stu
dent. "Many students have tu
toring experience and we hope
this involvement will serve as a
basis for writing and learning,"
Hawkes said.

Specifically, some freshmen
will be allowed to work in "semi
teaching" situations in local
schools. They will study the de
velopment of creativity in
younger students and the rela
tionship of the speaking to writ
ing voice in these students.
With the Underprivileged
Other students are expected
to work with underprivileged
children who do not use stan
dard English. Work in a chil
dren's center in East Palo Alto
is also anticipated.
Members of the Stanford Rep
ertory Theater may also partici
pate in an experiment which in
volves reading aloud, and the
tape-recording of both student
speech and student writing.
Classes for the program will
be upstairs in the Stanford
Press building. The area housed
the Institute for Communica
tion Research last year.
Teaching Assistants assigned
to the program are Zeese Papa
nikolas, Darel Baylor, Robert
Weston, Stephan Dixon, Fran
celia Mason, Charlotte Morse
and Willare Wyman.
"The project was originally
developed to cover several
years," Hawkes said. "Our con
tracts are for the first year only
but we would like to continue
the program at Stanford for a
second year."
