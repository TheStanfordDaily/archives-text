# Transfers Facing Housing Shortage
## 
### DICK LIVINGSTON Asst. Managing Editor 
An aggregation of 260 trans
fer men arrived on campus this
,wpek with a common concern:
the need for housing in the im
. mediate vicinity of the Univer
sity.
~ Off-campus living units are
harder than ever to find this fall
with the construction of apart
ments down and the demand for
space up. University housing, as
is always the case fall quarter,
is full with long waiting lists.
The transfer student arrives
at Stanford and is greeted by a
-friendly transfer Pre-Reg Corn
emission member who under
stands his problem but doesn't
! really have the answer.
Biggest Problem
"Of course, housing is the
biggest initial problem," Fred
Horning, a member of the Com
mission, laments. "It seems
about twice as bad this year as
• previously."
! One helpful innovation initi
ated this year by Chairman Bob
Harvey has been housing trans
fers in Stern Hall this week
while they look for permanent
; housing. Some 70 transfers have
taken advantage of the service.
"Providing this temporary
| housing has worked out real
; well," Horning explains. "It al
lows the new students to meet
: prospective roommates and
; keeps them from having to stay
' in motels."
Information
The Commission has also been
providing a housing clearing
house in Tresidder Union to ex
; plain the housing situation in
; the area.
A check with the Housing Of
! fice indicates rooms and apart
; ments are available, but most
■ require a car for transporta
! tion to the campus. The office
; maintains an up-to-date file of
> both rooms and apartments and
! still had a large selection at
; press time.
- Information on rooms in pro
fessors' homes on campus is also
available at the Housing Office.
Goal: Integration
"Besides helping the transfer
find a place to live, we are in
terested in seeing that he is in
tegrated into campus life,"
Horning said. This is a year
long job. We can't really do this
for the student—we're just here
to provide ideas, information
and introductions."
Chairman Harvey emphasized
the importance of getting in
volved in some activity like Axe
Comm or The Daily.

To begin the task of inte
grating the transfer, the Com
mission has arranged a three
day program specifically de
signed for students with at least
one year of college. The pro
gram will be different than the
longer freshman orientation,
though some common events
have been scheduled.
The 260 men will be joined
by 40 transfer women this morn
ing in an initial orientation ses
sion and campus tour. To
morrow the transfers will be ad
dressed by President Sterling
and Philip H. Rhinelander, pro
fessor of Philosophy.
A Sports Day and Barbecue
on the lawn adjacent to the
Women's Gym are also sched
uled Saturday from 3 to 7 p.m.

Horning said. This is a year
long job. We can't really do this
for the student—we're just here
to provide ideas, information
and introductions."
Chairman Harvey emphasized
the importance of getting in
volved in some activity like Axe
Comm or The Daily.

To begin the task of inte
grating the transfer, the Com
mission has arranged a three
day program specifically de
signed for students with at least
one year of college. The pro
gram will be different than the
longer freshman orientation,
though some common events
have been scheduled.
The 260 men will be joined
by 40 transfer women this morn
ing in an initial orientation ses
sion and campus tour. To
morrow the transfers will be ad
dressed by President Sterling
and Philip H. Rhinelander, pro
fessor of Philosophy.
A Sports Day and Barbecue
on the lawn adjacent to the
Women's Gym are also sched
uled Saturday from 3 to 7 p.m.
An aggregation of 260 trans
fer men arrived on campus this
,wpek with a common concern:
the need for housing in the im
. mediate vicinity of the Univer
sity.
~ Off-campus living units are
harder than ever to find this fall
with the construction of apart
ments down and the demand for
space up. University housing, as
is always the case fall quarter,
is full with long waiting lists.
The transfer student arrives
at Stanford and is greeted by a
-friendly transfer Pre-Reg Corn
emission member who under
stands his problem but doesn't
! really have the answer.
Biggest Problem
"Of course, housing is the
biggest initial problem," Fred
Horning, a member of the Com
mission, laments. "It seems
about twice as bad this year as
• previously."
! One helpful innovation initi
ated this year by Chairman Bob
Harvey has been housing trans
fers in Stern Hall this week
while they look for permanent
; housing. Some 70 transfers have
taken advantage of the service.
"Providing this temporary
| housing has worked out real
; well," Horning explains. "It al
lows the new students to meet
: prospective roommates and
; keeps them from having to stay
' in motels."
Information
The Commission has also been
providing a housing clearing
house in Tresidder Union to ex
; plain the housing situation in
; the area.
A check with the Housing Of
! fice indicates rooms and apart
; ments are available, but most
■ require a car for transporta
! tion to the campus. The office
; maintains an up-to-date file of
> both rooms and apartments and
! still had a large selection at
; press time.
- Information on rooms in pro
fessors' homes on campus is also
available at the Housing Office.
Goal: Integration
"Besides helping the transfer
find a place to live, we are in
terested in seeing that he is in
tegrated into campus life,"
Horning said. This is a year
long job. We can't really do this
