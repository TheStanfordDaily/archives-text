# Students Work To Combat Rising Costs
## 
### 
University tuition was raised
$55 per quarter last year and
room and board will go up
$65 per quarter next year. These
are not isolated increases, but
reflect the mounting costs of
higher education which are like
ly to go still higher.
Although grants and scholar
ships are usually increased com
mensurate with an increase in
fees, a growing number of stu
dents have turned to part-time
jobs to meet the financial bur
dens of higher education.
In the last three years the
price tag on an undergraduate
degree has increased from $9,960
to $10,680 at next year's rates,
excluding books and personal ex
penses, which the University es
timates at $300 per year. In the

course of a student's undergrad
uate stay he can expect an in
crease in fees at least every
other year. Despite the increases,
student fees by themselves meet
only forty percent of University
operating expenses.
An Honored Institution
Twenty years ago if a student
worked his way through college,
he probably spent his under
graduate days hashing. Modern
technology and the post-war
population boom have not elimi
nated the time-honored student
institution.
What the swell in college en
rollments has brought in an in
crease in the number of students
who earn part of their expenses
and an amazing variety of
schemes to accomplish the task.
One of the new student-entre
preneurs is Jim Binns, a poli
tical science major, who works
as Auto-Europe's campus rep
resentative. Binns makes ar
rangements for European-bound
travelers who want to order a
foreign car in the United States
and pick them up at the Euro
pean factory.
Jack-of-AII-Trades
"It's a very challenging job
because I'm my own boss,"
Binns remarked. Binns is a jack
of-all trades in the one-man op
eration. He writes his own ad

vertising, runs mail campaigns,
contacts customers, and hope
fully wraps up a deal in the
process.
Most of Binns' customers are
students who will be attending
one of Stanford's five over-seas
campuses. Having purchased a
car while he was at Stanford-in-
France, Binns sends each pros
pective overseas campus student
a brochure outlining the bene
fits of having a car during their
stay in Europe. He estimates be
tween 10 and 20 members in
each group purchase a foreign
car, and he plans to get a good
slice of this market.
Binns works on a commission
basis. He admits his pay is
probably no better than the av
erage part-time job, but he en
joys the work and is getting ex
perience from running his "own
little company."
More Glamour
Binn's job is more glamorous
than most, but Barbara Cochran
of the Student Employment Ser
vice estimates more than half
the student body are earning
part of their college expenses.
Actual employment figures are
hard to obtain since there is
no central office which handles
all student employment.
Most of the major airlines
have campus representatives to
promote travel-card programs
and organize vacation charter
service. Like Binns they are con
nected with Sequoia Travel Ser

vice, though paid by the air
lines.
The University Food Service
handles the hiring of hashers
for all residences. Presently
there are around 500 hashers
employed. The Athletic depart
ment as well as the various aca
demic departments also do their
hiring independently.
For Big-Drawing Games
The athletic department em
ploys students as ushers .ticket
takers, and program sellers at
University athletic contests. Ro
bert M. Butler, Business Man
ager of the athletic department,
estimates that more than a
thousand students are hired for
the big-drawing football games.
Students are paid between $1.25
and $2.25 depending upon their
responsibility at the game.
The most intriguing collection
of jobs is handled by Barbara
Cochran of the Student Employ
ment Service. The service is run
by the University on a non-profit
basis at no cost to students. Var
ious on- and off-campus employ
ers place job requests with Mrs.
Cochran. Each request is re
corded in a job file for students
to page through. Students select
a job from the listing and con
tact the prospective employer.
Most jobs are short-term, such
as baby-sitting, gardening, the
ses typing, and tutoring. How
ever there are many jobs which
turn out to be lasting and lucra
tive.

Last year 2,390 students regi
stered at the Student Employ
ment Service. Of the 6,240 re
quest for help, Mrs. Cochran
filled over 4,900. Some students
were placed more than one time,
others not all. She noted some
students come in each Thursday
to pick out a job for the week
end.
Like any organization, the ser
vice gets its share of strange re
quests, but it does its best to fill
them all. Some of the more un
usual requests filled recently
have been:
* Dog-sitter. A graduate stu
dent earned $30 for petting, feed
ing and brushing a Palo Alto

family's trust hound for a week
during the Christmas break.
• Human alarm-clock. A stu
dent wife has been hired to
make sure that an off-campus
student makes his 8 o'clock. She
rousts him out of bed, makes a
cup of coffee, and departs.
• Model airplane flyer. One up
perclassman was hired to teach
a boy's club how to fly gas
engine models.
• Stock boy. Junior A 1 Tam
many was hired by lon-Tech, a
local maker of vacuum pumps,
as a stock room assistant. He
wound up building the stock
room, organizing it, and arrang
ing the merchandise. Now lon-

Tech has him actually assembl
ing vacuum pumps.
There are many Jobs which
students get on their own
through personal contacts or
because of special background
training. Bill Moore, a graduate
student in journalism and form
er editor of The Dally covers
the campus for The Chronicle.
With rising tuition costs the
trends of the working student
are sure to progress even furth
er. A recent national survey
showed two out of three college
students earn part of their own
expense. Student indebtedness is
also on the rise to meet ever
increasing tuition costs.

There are many Jobs which
students get on their own
through personal contacts or
because of special background
training. Bill Moore, a graduate

the campus for The Chronicle.
With rising tuition costs the
trends of the working student
are sure to progress even furth
er. A recent national survey
showed two out of three college
students earn part of their own
expense. Student indebtedness is
also on the rise to meet ever
increasing tuition costs.
University tuition was raised
$55 per quarter last year and
room and board will go up
$65 per quarter next year. These
are not isolated increases, but
reflect the mounting costs of
higher education which are like
ly to go still higher.
Although grants and scholar
ships are usually increased com
mensurate with an increase in
fees, a growing number of stu
dents have turned to part-time
jobs to meet the financial bur
dens of higher education.
In the last three years the
price tag on an undergraduate
degree has increased from $9,960
to $10,680 at next year's rates,
excluding books and personal ex
penses, which the University es
timates at $300 per year. In the

course of a student's undergrad
uate stay he can expect an in
crease in fees at least every
other year. Despite the increases,
student fees by themselves meet
only forty percent of University
operating expenses.
An Honored Institution
Twenty years ago if a student
worked his way through college,
he probably spent his under
graduate days hashing. Modern
technology and the post-war
population boom have not elimi
nated the time-honored student
institution.
What the swell in college en
rollments has brought in an in
crease in the number of students
who earn part of their expenses
and an amazing variety of
schemes to accomplish the task.
One of the new student-entre
preneurs is Jim Binns, a poli
tical science major, who works
as Auto-Europe's campus rep
resentative. Binns makes ar
rangements for European-bound
travelers who want to order a
foreign car in the United States
and pick them up at the Euro
pean factory.
Jack-of-AII-Trades
"It's a very challenging job
because I'm my own boss,"
Binns remarked. Binns is a jack
of-all trades in the one-man op
eration. He writes his own ad

vertising, runs mail campaigns,
contacts customers, and hope
fully wraps up a deal in the
process.
Most of Binns' customers are
students who will be attending
one of Stanford's five over-seas
campuses. Having purchased a
car while he was at Stanford-in-
France, Binns sends each pros
pective overseas campus student
a brochure outlining the bene
fits of having a car during their
stay in Europe. He estimates be
tween 10 and 20 members in
each group purchase a foreign
car, and he plans to get a good
slice of this market.
Binns works on a commission
basis. He admits his pay is
probably no better than the av
erage part-time job, but he en
joys the work and is getting ex
perience from running his "own
little company."
More Glamour
Binn's job is more glamorous
than most, but Barbara Cochran
of the Student Employment Ser
vice estimates more than half
the student body are earning
part of their college expenses.
Actual employment figures are
hard to obtain since there is
no central office which handles
all student employment.
Most of the major airlines
have campus representatives to
promote travel-card programs
and organize vacation charter
service. Like Binns they are con
nected with Sequoia Travel Ser

vice, though paid by the air
lines.
The University Food Service
handles the hiring of hashers
for all residences. Presently
there are around 500 hashers
employed. The Athletic depart
ment as well as the various aca

For Big-Drawing Games
The athletic department em
ploys students as ushers .ticket
takers, and program sellers at
University athletic contests. Ro
bert M. Butler, Business Man
ager of the athletic department,
estimates that more than a
thousand students are hired for
the big-drawing football games.
Students are paid between $1.25
and $2.25 depending upon their
responsibility at the game.
The most intriguing collection
of jobs is handled by Barbara
Cochran of the Student Employ
ment Service. The service is run
by the University on a non-profit
basis at no cost to students. Var
ious on- and off-campus employ
ers place job requests with Mrs.
Cochran. Each request is re
corded in a job file for students
to page through. Students select
a job from the listing and con
tact the prospective employer.
Most jobs are short-term, such
as baby-sitting, gardening, the
ses typing, and tutoring. How
ever there are many jobs which
turn out to be lasting and lucra
tive.

Last year 2,390 students regi
stered at the Student Employ
ment Service. Of the 6,240 re
quest for help, Mrs. Cochran
filled over 4,900. Some students
were placed more than one time,
others not all. She noted some
students come in each Thursday
to pick out a job for the week
end.
Like any organization, the ser
vice gets its share of strange re
quests, but it does its best to fill
them all. Some of the more un
usual requests filled recently
have been:
* Dog-sitter. A graduate stu
dent earned $30 for petting, feed
ing and brushing a Palo Alto

family's trust hound for a week
during the Christmas break.
• Human alarm-clock. A stu
dent wife has been hired to
make sure that an off-campus
student makes his 8 o'clock. She
rousts him out of bed, makes a

stered at the Student Employ
ment Service. Of the 6,240 re
quest for help, Mrs. Cochran
filled over 4,900. Some students
were placed more than one time,
others not all. She noted some
students come in each Thursday
to pick out a job for the week
end.
Like any organization, the ser
vice gets its share of strange re
quests, but it does its best to fill
them all. Some of the more un
usual requests filled recently
have been:
* Dog-sitter. A graduate stu
dent earned $30 for petting, feed
ing and brushing a Palo Alto

family's trust hound for a week
during the Christmas break.
• Human alarm-clock. A stu
dent wife has been hired to
make sure that an off-campus
student makes his 8 o'clock. She
rousts him out of bed, makes a
cup of coffee, and departs.
• Model airplane flyer. One up
perclassman was hired to teach
a boy's club how to fly gas
engine models.
• Stock boy. Junior A 1 Tam
many was hired by lon-Tech, a
local maker of vacuum pumps,
as a stock room assistant. He
wound up building the stock
room, organizing it, and arrang
ing the merchandise. Now lon-

Tech has him actually assembl
ing vacuum pumps.
There are many Jobs which
students get on their own
through personal contacts or
because of special background
training. Bill Moore, a graduate
student in journalism and form
er editor of The Dally covers
the campus for The Chronicle.
With rising tuition costs the
trends of the working student
are sure to progress even furth
er. A recent national survey
showed two out of three college
students earn part of their own
expense. Student indebtedness is
also on the rise to meet ever
increasing tuition costs.
University tuition was raised
$55 per quarter last year and
room and board will go up
$65 per quarter next year. These
are not isolated increases, but
reflect the mounting costs of
higher education which are like
ly to go still higher.
Although grants and scholar
ships are usually increased com
mensurate with an increase in
fees, a growing number of stu
dents have turned to part-time
jobs to meet the financial bur
dens of higher education.
In the last three years the
price tag on an undergraduate
degree has increased from $9,960
to $10,680 at next year's rates,
excluding books and personal ex
penses, which the University es
timates at $300 per year. In the

course of a student's undergrad
uate stay he can expect an in
crease in fees at least every
other year. Despite the increases,
student fees by themselves meet
only forty percent of University
operating expenses.
An Honored Institution
Twenty years ago if a student
worked his way through college,
he probably spent his under
graduate days hashing. Modern
technology and the post-war
population boom have not elimi
nated the time-honored student
institution.
What the swell in college en
rollments has brought in an in
crease in the number of students
who earn part of their expenses
and an amazing variety of
schemes to accomplish the task.
One of the new student-entre
preneurs is Jim Binns, a poli
tical science major, who works
as Auto-Europe's campus rep
resentative. Binns makes ar
rangements for European-bound
travelers who want to order a
foreign car in the United States
and pick them up at the Euro
pean factory.
Jack-of-AII-Trades
"It's a very challenging job
because I'm my own boss,"
Binns remarked. Binns is a jack
of-all trades in the one-man op
eration. He writes his own ad

vertising, runs mail campaigns,
contacts customers, and hope
fully wraps up a deal in the
process.
Most of Binns' customers are
students who will be attending
one of Stanford's five over-seas
campuses. Having purchased a
car while he was at Stanford-in-
France, Binns sends each pros
pective overseas campus student
a brochure outlining the bene
fits of having a car during their
stay in Europe. He estimates be
tween 10 and 20 members in
each group purchase a foreign
car, and he plans to get a good
slice of this market.
Binns works on a commission
basis. He admits his pay is
probably no better than the av
erage part-time job, but he en
joys the work and is getting ex
perience from running his "own
little company."
More Glamour
Binn's job is more glamorous
than most, but Barbara Cochran
of the Student Employment Ser
vice estimates more than half
the student body are earning
part of their college expenses.
Actual employment figures are
hard to obtain since there is
no central office which handles
all student employment.
Most of the major airlines
have campus representatives to
promote travel-card programs
and organize vacation charter
service. Like Binns they are con
nected with Sequoia Travel Ser

vice, though paid by the air
lines.
The University Food Service
handles the hiring of hashers
for all residences. Presently
there are around 500 hashers
employed. The Athletic depart
ment as well as the various aca
demic departments also do their
hiring independently.
For Big-Drawing Games
The athletic department em
ploys students as ushers .ticket
takers, and program sellers at
University athletic contests. Ro
bert M. Butler, Business Man
ager of the athletic department,
estimates that more than a
thousand students are hired for
the big-drawing football games.
Students are paid between $1.25
and $2.25 depending upon their
responsibility at the game.
The most intriguing collection
of jobs is handled by Barbara
Cochran of the Student Employ
ment Service. The service is run
by the University on a non-profit
basis at no cost to students. Var
ious on- and off-campus employ
ers place job requests with Mrs.
Cochran. Each request is re
corded in a job file for students
to page through. Students select
a job from the listing and con
tact the prospective employer.
Most jobs are short-term, such
as baby-sitting, gardening, the
ses typing, and tutoring. How
ever there are many jobs which
turn out to be lasting and lucra
tive.

ager of the athletic department,
estimates that more than a
thousand students are hired for
the big-drawing football games.
Students are paid between $1.25
and $2.25 depending upon their
responsibility at the game.
The most intriguing collection
of jobs is handled by Barbara
Cochran of the Student Employ
ment Service. The service is run
by the University on a non-profit
basis at no cost to students. Var
ious on- and off-campus employ
ers place job requests with Mrs.
Cochran. Each request is re
corded in a job file for students
to page through. Students select
a job from the listing and con
tact the prospective employer.
Most jobs are short-term, such
as baby-sitting, gardening, the
ses typing, and tutoring. How
ever there are many jobs which
turn out to be lasting and lucra
tive.

Last year 2,390 students regi
stered at the Student Employ
ment Service. Of the 6,240 re
quest for help, Mrs. Cochran
filled over 4,900. Some students
were placed more than one time,
others not all. She noted some
students come in each Thursday
to pick out a job for the week
end.
Like any organization, the ser
vice gets its share of strange re
quests, but it does its best to fill
them all. Some of the more un
usual requests filled recently
have been:
* Dog-sitter. A graduate stu
dent earned $30 for petting, feed
ing and brushing a Palo Alto

family's trust hound for a week
during the Christmas break.
• Human alarm-clock. A stu
dent wife has been hired to
make sure that an off-campus
student makes his 8 o'clock. She
rousts him out of bed, makes a
cup of coffee, and departs.
• Model airplane flyer. One up
perclassman was hired to teach
a boy's club how to fly gas
engine models.
• Stock boy. Junior A 1 Tam
many was hired by lon-Tech, a
local maker of vacuum pumps,
as a stock room assistant. He
wound up building the stock
room, organizing it, and arrang
ing the merchandise. Now lon-

Tech has him actually assembl
ing vacuum pumps.
There are many Jobs which
students get on their own
through personal contacts or
because of special background
training. Bill Moore, a graduate
student in journalism and form
er editor of The Dally covers
the campus for The Chronicle.
With rising tuition costs the
trends of the working student
are sure to progress even furth
er. A recent national survey
showed two out of three college
students earn part of their own
expense. Student indebtedness is
also on the rise to meet ever
increasing tuition costs.
