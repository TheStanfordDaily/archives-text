Bicyclists who go zipping
down University Avenue dressed
in their Masked Avenger black
leather outfits after dark are
"increasing their chances of be
coming a statistic," the Stan
ford Police Dept. warns.
All bicycles should have a
white light on the front and a
reflector and red light on the
rear, and riders should wear
light colored clothing for night
riding, cautions the dept. Bi
cycle paths should be used when
available.
In addition, riders running
stop signs, weaving through traf
fic, or riding inside the arcades
of Quad may find themselves
heading another list of statistics
—as the latest contributors to
the University's most unpopular
fund - raising program, traffic
tickets.
