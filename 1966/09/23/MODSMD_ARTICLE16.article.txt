# Curtain Up On Ram's Head!
## Martini? 
### ROBERT E. STONE 
An international businessman
is gunned down in the Union
during Dead Week; a group of
12th century peasants in clerical
dress march through the Union
chanting obscene prayers; the
Israeli delegate is assassinated
during the Stanford United Na
tions by two Arabs shouting
ALLAH AKBAR.
These seemingly unrelated
events all have one thing in
common—they were all Ram's
Head productions.
Ram's Head, Stanford's stu
dent drama organization, pro
vides interested students with
the opportunity to participate in
all phases of the theatre. The
genius behind the organization
comes from a powerful trium
virate Which includes a frus
trated mountain climber, a

scheming Shylock, and a little
slave girl with a whip. This
triumvirate, with the help of a
lot of semi-sane membens of the
Ram's Head Board, manages to
stage three major productions
each year.
Gaieties
Ram's Head's addition to the
frenzy of Big Game Week is
GAIETIES, an original, full
length musical with a cast of
thousands. This year's
GA IT IE S, modestly titled
AAAUGHHH! deals with the in
ternational intrigue surround
ing a "cultural exchange."
AAAUGHHH is a tale of spon
sors, sex, squares, and suspense.
Its diverse sets include the Se
quoia Travel Service, The Jester,
and Red Immemorial Plaza.
Mata Hariovitch, members of
the Insecurity Council, and

Agents C., 1., A.,!., clash in at
tempts to crack the "Big Game
Code."
During the long, cold winter,
Ram's Head considers it to be
its obligation to warm up the
campus. A musical is the usual
bill of fare, but the winter pro
ductions are not always "stan
dard" musicals. Last winter's
production, Aristophanes "Lysis
trata," combined classic verse
score sung by a twenty voice
naked Greek chorus. "Lysistra
ta's" deception by the Stanford
community can only be de
scribed as unique.
Spring Quarter, Ram's Head
moves into the Nitery, Stan
ford's most intimate theater.
Under the direction of three can
didates from the Speech and
Drama Department's new Mas
ter of Fine Arts Program, the
organization usually produces
three one act plays. Scripts for
these plays are solicited from
the entire campus. In the Nitery
where actor and audience are an
arm's length apart, the actor
gets to take out all of his frus

trations upon the audience and
makes the theater goer almost
one of the cast.
Nerve-center
The Ram's Head Office, In the
Union is the nerve-center of the
organization. The office is never
quiet, and it is within its con
fines that the interminable cri
ses of staging a show are met,
discussed, and ignored.
The men and women who
comprise Ram's Head take fierce
pride in the organization's
achievements. Few people know
about the Ram's Heal scholar
ship or that the follow spots in
Memorial Auditorium were a
Ram's Head gift to the Univer
sity. Even fewer are aware of
the long hours spent during the
summer writing and designing
GAIETIES. Even the slapdash
pranks Ram's Head is famous
for are the products of many
long houns of detailed rehearsal.
The members of Ram's Head
are serious only when preparing
a production. Above all the fun
and frolic of the organization
comes a desire to produce good
theatre. There is no fooling
around when there is work to
be done—well only a little. There
are very few people in the or
ganization who want a set to
collapse on them or a number to
be bad because they were fool
ing around when they should
have been listening.
Ram's Head is dependent on
one vital substance for its sur
vival—new people. Nobody who
wants to work is ever turned
away, and nobody who wants to
become part of the organization,
to help plan its future, to will
their soul to Ram's Head, is ever
refused the opportunity. There
is a position for everybody, and
a sense of comraderie that is not
often found on this campus.


Ram's Head added Its own unique touch to the James Bond legend
In last year's Big Game Galtles, "Blue and Goldflnger." Here timid
Harry Byrd attempts the seduction of voluptlous Anita Leigh In
Stanford agent Jim Bond's lush ofT-campus pad.

during Dead Week; a group of
12th century peasants in clerical
dress march through the Union
chanting obscene prayers; the
Israeli delegate is assassinated
during the Stanford United Na
tions by two Arabs shouting
ALLAH AKBAR.
These seemingly unrelated
events all have one thing in
common—they were all Ram's
Head productions.
Ram's Head, Stanford's stu
dent drama organization, pro
vides interested students with
the opportunity to participate in
all phases of the theatre. The
genius behind the organization
comes from a powerful trium
virate Which includes a frus
trated mountain climber, a

scheming Shylock, and a little
slave girl with a whip. This
triumvirate, with the help of a
lot of semi-sane membens of the
Ram's Head Board, manages to
stage three major productions
each year.
Gaieties
Ram's Head's addition to the
frenzy of Big Game Week is
GAIETIES, an original, full
length musical with a cast of
thousands. This year's
GA IT IE S, modestly titled
AAAUGHHH! deals with the in
ternational intrigue surround
ing a "cultural exchange."
AAAUGHHH is a tale of spon
sors, sex, squares, and suspense.
Its diverse sets include the Se
quoia Travel Service, The Jester,
and Red Immemorial Plaza.

the Insecurity Council, and

Agents C., 1., A.,!., clash in at

Code."
During the long, cold winter,
Ram's Head considers it to be
its obligation to warm up the
campus. A musical is the usual
bill of fare, but the winter pro
ductions are not always "stan
dard" musicals. Last winter's
production, Aristophanes "Lysis
trata," combined classic verse
score sung by a twenty voice
naked Greek chorus. "Lysistra
ta's" deception by the Stanford
community can only be de
scribed as unique.
Spring Quarter, Ram's Head
moves into the Nitery, Stan
ford's most intimate theater.
Under the direction of three can
didates from the Speech and
Drama Department's new Mas
ter of Fine Arts Program, the
organization usually produces
three one act plays. Scripts for
these plays are solicited from
the entire campus. In the Nitery
where actor and audience are an
arm's length apart, the actor
gets to take out all of his frus

trations upon the audience and
makes the theater goer almost
one of the cast.
Nerve-center
The Ram's Head Office, In the
Union is the nerve-center of the
organization. The office is never
quiet, and it is within its con
fines that the interminable cri
ses of staging a show are met,
discussed, and ignored.
The men and women who
comprise Ram's Head take fierce
pride in the organization's
achievements. Few people know
about the Ram's Heal scholar
ship or that the follow spots in
Memorial Auditorium were a
Ram's Head gift to the Univer
sity. Even fewer are aware of
the long hours spent during the
summer writing and designing
GAIETIES. Even the slapdash
pranks Ram's Head is famous
for are the products of many
long houns of detailed rehearsal.
The members of Ram's Head
are serious only when preparing
a production. Above all the fun
and frolic of the organization
comes a desire to produce good
theatre. There is no fooling
around when there is work to
be done—well only a little. There
are very few people in the or
ganization who want a set to
collapse on them or a number to
be bad because they were fool
ing around when they should
have been listening.
Ram's Head is dependent on
one vital substance for its sur
vival—new people. Nobody who
wants to work is ever turned
away, and nobody who wants to
become part of the organization,
to help plan its future, to will
their soul to Ram's Head, is ever
refused the opportunity. There
is a position for everybody, and
a sense of comraderie that is not
often found on this campus.


Ram's Head added Its own unique touch to the James Bond legend
In last year's Big Game Galtles, "Blue and Goldflnger." Here timid

chanting obscene prayers; the
Israeli delegate is assassinated
during the Stanford United Na
tions by two Arabs shouting
ALLAH AKBAR.
These seemingly unrelated
events all have one thing in
common—they were all Ram's
Head productions.
Ram's Head, Stanford's stu
dent drama organization, pro
vides interested students with
the opportunity to participate in
all phases of the theatre. The
genius behind the organization
comes from a powerful trium
virate Which includes a frus
trated mountain climber, a

scheming Shylock, and a little
slave girl with a whip. This
triumvirate, with the help of a
lot of semi-sane membens of the
Ram's Head Board, manages to
stage three major productions
each year.
Gaieties
Ram's Head's addition to the
frenzy of Big Game Week is
GAIETIES, an original, full
length musical with a cast of
thousands. This year's
GA IT IE S, modestly titled
AAAUGHHH! deals with the in
ternational intrigue surround
ing a "cultural exchange."
AAAUGHHH is a tale of spon
sors, sex, squares, and suspense.
Its diverse sets include the Se
quoia Travel Service, The Jester,
and Red Immemorial Plaza.
Mata Hariovitch, members of
the Insecurity Council, and

Agents C., 1., A.,!., clash in at
tempts to crack the "Big Game
Code."
During the long, cold winter,
Ram's Head considers it to be
its obligation to warm up the
campus. A musical is the usual
bill of fare, but the winter pro
ductions are not always "stan
dard" musicals. Last winter's
production, Aristophanes "Lysis
trata," combined classic verse
score sung by a twenty voice
naked Greek chorus. "Lysistra
ta's" deception by the Stanford
community can only be de
scribed as unique.
Spring Quarter, Ram's Head
moves into the Nitery, Stan
ford's most intimate theater.
Under the direction of three can
didates from the Speech and
Drama Department's new Mas
ter of Fine Arts Program, the
organization usually produces
three one act plays. Scripts for
these plays are solicited from
the entire campus. In the Nitery
where actor and audience are an
arm's length apart, the actor
gets to take out all of his frus

trations upon the audience and
makes the theater goer almost
one of the cast.
Nerve-center
The Ram's Head Office, In the
Union is the nerve-center of the
organization. The office is never
quiet, and it is within its con
fines that the interminable cri
ses of staging a show are met,
discussed, and ignored.
The men and women who
comprise Ram's Head take fierce
pride in the organization's
achievements. Few people know
about the Ram's Heal scholar
ship or that the follow spots in
Memorial Auditorium were a
Ram's Head gift to the Univer
sity. Even fewer are aware of
the long hours spent during the
summer writing and designing
GAIETIES. Even the slapdash
pranks Ram's Head is famous
for are the products of many
long houns of detailed rehearsal.
The members of Ram's Head
are serious only when preparing
a production. Above all the fun
and frolic of the organization
comes a desire to produce good
theatre. There is no fooling
around when there is work to
be done—well only a little. There
are very few people in the or
ganization who want a set to
collapse on them or a number to
be bad because they were fool
ing around when they should
have been listening.
Ram's Head is dependent on
one vital substance for its sur
vival—new people. Nobody who
wants to work is ever turned
away, and nobody who wants to
become part of the organization,
to help plan its future, to will
their soul to Ram's Head, is ever
refused the opportunity. There
is a position for everybody, and
a sense of comraderie that is not
often found on this campus.


Ram's Head added Its own unique touch to the James Bond legend
In last year's Big Game Galtles, "Blue and Goldflnger." Here timid
Harry Byrd attempts the seduction of voluptlous Anita Leigh In
Stanford agent Jim Bond's lush ofT-campus pad.
