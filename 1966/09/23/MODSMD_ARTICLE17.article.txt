The Stanford Dally begins its
75th year of publication today
with the largest Freshman Edi
tion ever produced—lB pages.
The campus newspaper was
founded in 1892 as the Dally
Palo Alto, or, as old timers still
call it, The Dippy. The present
name was adopted in 1926.
Today The Daily is a $100,000
business operated entirely by
undergraduates. The function of
the newspaper, as always, is to
completely cover the news of the
Stanford community. Highlights
of national and international
news are also carried through
the facilities of Associated
Press.
Large Readership
With a press run of more than
12,000 copies each day, The
Daily enjoys a large student,
faculty and subscription reader
ship.
Always needing more stafT
members, The Daily will hold an
open house Sunday from 3 to
6 p.m. in the Storke Student
Publications Building.
All prospective staffers begin
at the trainee level. Past experi
ence is valuable but not re
quired. Staff positions are avail
able in the advertising, secre
tarial, photo, news and feature
and sports departments.
Editor for Volume 150 is Jim
Selna, a veteran of three years
on The Daiiy staff. Business

Roster. He is considered an ex

quarter while Briscoe was over
seas.
