By PHILIP H. RHINELANDER
Attributing recent student dis
orders to "sinister outside in
fluences" or to "Red agitators"
is much too easy; it is a way of
denying that any special prob
lem exists, a way of saying that
no reforms are needed, a way of
advocating a "get tough" pol
icy without having to listen to
the students' complaints; a way

of reasserting the supremacy
of exisiting authority and giving
students the brush-off. The
trouble is that this attitude tends
to be self-defeating.
A get-tough policy is appro
priate in dealing with prankish
or irresponsible hell-raising, but
the irony is that in such cases,
administrators are apt to relent
and to become forgiving if the
students confess error. On the
other hand, where the students
have a real complaint—or think
they have —refusal to listen to
it only intensifies the initial
grievance and adds fuel to the
fire. And here, those who take
a "get-tough" line, are apt to be
unrelenting and intransigent,
just when they ought not to be.

I would argue that to dismiss
the current student unrest as a
symptom of the Communist con
spiracy—as some of our right
wing politicians seem to be do
ing—is to play into the hands of
the very agitators whom they
wish to defeat. Of course there
are agitators; there always are.
But if you know there is a pyro
maniac in the neighborhood, you
don't leave matches and a can
of kerosene lying about in your
front yard for him to use.
By the same token, since we
know that agitators of all kinds
feed on unrest, the best defense
is to remove the cause of unrest
on which they profit, not to leave
them standing. There is a maxim
in chess that you should never
drive your opponent where he
wants to go. The same principle
applies, I think in dealing with
student firebrands. If you con
vert them into martyrs, you in
crease their power in the stu
dent community, which is pre
cisely what you should try to
prevent.
Students of the "new left"
seem to be more influenced by
the civil rights movement than
by specific doctrines of Maoism
or Marxism. And behind the civil
rights movement is the figure of
Ghandi. But the model here is,
thus far, tactical rather than
ideological, and the result is a
kind of negativism. For the posi
tive ideas of the civil rights
movement, namely integration
and equal opportunity for mi
nority groups, have no im
mediate analogue on the campus
except on the theory that the en
tire student population constitu
tes an underprivileged group—a
position which some of the lead
ers of the "new left" seem to be
trying to establish.
Tactically, the influence of the
civil rights movement is clear—
protest rallies, picketing, pa
rades, meetings, marches, the sit
in and other recognized forms of
civil disobendience. But what
are the objectives which these
tactics are used to attain? I am
not concerned here with the
non-educational, off-campus ob
jectives to which the campus ac
tivists often devote themselves,
such as civil rights, peace or op
position to war in Vietnam, but
with their on-campus objectives
within the University itself.
These are, I believe, largely
negative.
Impersonality
There is, fundamentally, a ba
sic opposition to the imperson
ality and machine-like aspects
of existence, especially in the
larger Universities. We might
note that in this respect, the stu
dents are reflecting an attitude
found in much modern literature
and philosophy — a protest
against the dehumanization of a
technological society in which
ment tend to become units, num
bers, performers of functions
rather than individual persons.
The IBM card becomes here the
symbol of anonymity and deper

sonalization. It represents the op
pression of the student by the
system.
There is also a distrust of the
authority which operates the
system. And I would note that
the student activists here some
times seems to reflect the very
tendencies against which they
rebel, in that their own rejection
of authority may tend to be quite
machine-like and impersonal.
They may claim to have no
animus against Clark Kerr (or
here at Stanford against Wally
Sterling) as an individual. They
see the President primarily as a
functionary, an authority figure,
the operator of the University
machine. And the same seems
to be true of some attitudes
toward the Regents, or in our
case the Trustees.
The more extreme student ac
tivists do not seem to discrimi
nate among particular individ
uals according to their individ
ual views; they do not declare
for liberal administrators as
against reactionary administra
tors. The opposition, as publicly
formulated, is impersonal and
sweeping: "Abolish the Re
gents," or "You can't trust any
one over thirty." Everything is
seen in abstract terms of posi
tion and status; everything is
black and white; there is' no re
spect of persons.
Paradox
As I have said, this is para
doxical, since students of this
type exhibit toward the Univer
sity the same depersonalized
attitude which they condemn.
But this does not dispose of the
problem; in my view it makes
it all the more serious. The pro
cess of depersonalization has
gone so far that some of those
who protest it have been caught
up in it, and they may exemplify
in their own attitudes the very
tendencies which they decry.
This aspect of the matter re
serves more attention than it
has received; it is, to my mind,
the most alarming feature of
the situation. May it not exhibit
a failure in the educational pro
cess which needs to be cor
rected ?
It has been asserted that the
protesting students are more
sophisticated in their condemna
tions than their proposals. The
most consistent demand of the
new ' 'left" is that students
should be given a larger share
in decision-making, on a wide
variety of subjects, but these de
mands are sometimes made for
symbolic reasons — for the sake
of status — not for the sake of
achieving a particular end or
forwarding a definite policy.
I get the impression that the
activist students today want
more authority, not because
they value it but because they
distrust it. They have no clear
program — or at least none has
yet emerged. They have com
plaints, some of them well-justi
fied. They are quick to see
errors, short-comings, and defi
ciences both in the University
and in society.
And they want two things:
one is protection against arbi
trary regulations and the other
is recognition. I do not say this
in criticism. I think these two
demands are natural.
Negativism
And I believe also, that the
situation would be much worse
if the activists were all raving
Marxists — which most of them
are not. Of course, there are
some Marxists, and some exhi
bitionists, and some campus po
liticos with personal ambitions,
but on the whole, my impres
sion is that student activism to
day is ideologically negative
rather than positive. It is fairly
specific in its condemnations but
vague in its affirmations.
There appears to be a general
distrust of all traditional sys
tems of value and all fixed insti
tutions. If there is an ideology
here ,it is an ideology of non
ideology or anti-ideology.
In this aspect current student

activism seems to reflect an at
titude which has already ap
peared in our literature, art,
philosophy and religion. In the
modern theater, we have the so
called Theater of the Absurd, a
kind of anti-theater. In modern
literature, we have anti litera
ture and the cult of the anti
hero. In art, we have anti-art,
which purports to reject aesthe
tic values. In philosophy, we
have modern schools which tell
us that philosophy is impossible.
In religion, we have advocates
of a "religionless religion — of
belief in a God beyond God, or
a kind of non-God.
In all this, there is a com
mon overtone — the sense of a
void at the center of things.
There is a search for a stable
heirarchy of values, which be
comes all the more intense as no
firm foundation for a stable
heirarchy of values is discover
ed. The values of traditional re
ligion, with its moral rigidities,
are questioned. Rationality is
quetioned. The values of a tech
nological society, with its mass
culture, its machines, its imper
sonality, are questioned. Science
is questioned. Civil authority
is questioned. And finally, even
the stability of the ego — the
inner, personal self is ques
tioned.
And there is left an image of
life as a sort of meaningless
whirlpool with a void at the
center into which everything is
eventually sucked down. Of
course, this is all very avant
garde, and perhaps far removed
from the practical attitudes of
every day existence. But stu
dents, particularly the more in
tellectual students, are typically
associated in any era with the
avant garde of the period, and
I think this is the case today.
The Origins
If this analysis is correct, the
origins of current student un
-rest do not lie solely within the
universities, but extend into so
ciety itself. The students reflect
and respond to the malaise of
their elders, the effect being in
tensified by the familiar inse
curities of adolescence. Dean
Martin Meyerson, who served as
Acting Chancellor at Berkeley
last spring, has written:
Devoid of a coherent interpre
tation of the world, protesting

students at Berkeley often form
a loose coalition on specific Is
sues. They reject hierarchy
within their own organizations
and scorn the hierarchy of other
organization. They like to think
that each member is totally
committed to the cause . . .
There is a tendency to overesti
mate the power of the admini
stration, seeing all Issues In
terms of polar viewpoints, and
regarding any supporter of stu
dent protest who happens to
side with the administration on
a particular issue as a 'sell-out'
Professors Katz and Sanford
of Stanford, who have examined
student unrest as it appears in
various universities across the
nation, have this to say about
the ground of the student de
mand for greater participation
in the formulation of University
policies.
This demand for participation
does not stem from any desire

to make college life easier.
Rather it springs from a pro
found attempt to seek answers
to so how one might achieve
such ends as a reliable person
al identity, community with
other people, and social objec
tives that will bring comfort
and justice to those largely
bereft of them In our socity.
Again we have the search for
a stable hierarchy of values, in
terms of which the student can
find an identity for himself and
an effective outlet for his natu
ral idealism and his human
concern. Katz and Sanford also
report,
It is no accident that the re
volutionary student puts great
emphasis on community — what
he calls "communitarianism."
It springs from his wish that to
declare that development of
warm, intimate relationships is
not easy in college today.
This is the undergraduate ver


Philip H. Rhinelander
sion of a recurrent theme that
runs through most modern lit
erature; the need and the diffi
culty of establishing fruitful
personal relationships in a so
ciety which is increasingly de
personalized, where one encoun
ters more and more people
simply as performers of func
tions or actors of roles, not as
real individuals. The students
are experiencing and enacting
svhat our authors, playwrights
and poets have been pointing to
for twenty years or more.
If we view the situation with
alarm, we ought not to view it
with surprise. And our concern
— if we feel concerned — ought
to be less for the student, as
\.uch, than for society itself.
My strong conviction is that
students ought always to be
listened to — and I mean really
listened to — even, or especially,
when their demands appear
most unreasonable.
This is not to say that they
hould be agreed with or that
the administration should "run
scared", for the students are
quick to scent this sort of weak
ness and try to take advant
age of it. It is rather to say that
what galls students is not being
disagreed with, but being talk
vll down to.
All of us are sensitive on this
score, but college students par
ticularly so, since many of them
tend to be sensitive about being
treated as "mature" individuals.
If student activists can claim
that they have not been able
i? get a hearing for their views,
they have a rallying cry quite
independent of whether their
views are sound.
The wise administrator, then,
will see to it that there is a
convenient and known avenue
by which student complaints can
"iways be entertained and look
ed into. If complaints are well
founded, he may then be able to
take corrective action before
violence occurs. If they are not
well founded, he may be able to
explain why.
In either case, he treats the
complaining students as indivi
duals, which is often the most
important thing of all. This may
be easier said than done. It re
take a great deal of valuable
time. But such time, I believe, is
time well spent.
Forestalled
Good administration should
Je measured, in my opinion, not
simply by the crises which are
forestalled — by the disorders
which never happen.
It is my opinion, based partly
on my own experience and part
ly on what I have learned about
student disorders at other Uni
'ersities, that most outbreaks
not all of them, but most of
them — could have been pre
vented or at least mitigated, by
a little foresight, — by attention
paid in advance to incipient
causes of unrest.
Beyond such considerations
here is the simple fact that stu

dents are students. Katz and
Sanford conclude their survey
with the following estimate:
College authorities for their
part, feel threatened when the
bases of their power are at
tacked. Those of us who have
worked or talked with students
in the movement find how
ever, that for all their apparent
ferociousness and rebelliousness
—and even the more extreme
anarchism of some of them —
underneath they are still reason
ably pliable. Their search is for
Identity, meaning, community,
and by no means least, a re
sponse from the adult world.
When this response is forth
coming, most of the rebellious
ness vanishes, and in Its place
there is often an almost touch
ing desire for adult leadership.
Far from presenting a threat,
these students actually repre
sent to college authorities a uni
que opportunity. At one time
it looked like a hard fight to get
either graduate or undergradu
ate students involved on their
own, even at the expense of per
sonal safrifice. These students
are asking to be educated and
to be one with the Intellectual
community if only we show
them the way. ...
This observation calls atten
tion to one most important
point, namely that rebellious
ness and activism is, for many
students, a kind of defense
mechanism.
Again we are brought to the
conclusion that for most of
them, there is no positive sys
tematic ideology involved; in
stead, there is a strong desire
for recognition, and a sense of
frustration results when this is
denied. Hence, their activism is,
in part, a device for obtaining
the recognition which they have
failed to secure through regular
channels.
Middle Course
There is need for a middle
course between impatient tough
ness, on the one hand, and su
pine weakness on the other. Be
hind the student demonstrations,
there is a legitimate desire for
recognition and for the right to
be heard on matters affecting
student welfare, including edu
cational welfare.
I see no reason why these de
sires cannot be satisfied to the
benefit of all concerned, includ
ing the University itself. And
this is the direction in which af
fairs seem now to be moving.
I would add, however, that
behind rules and systems there
is always the matter of person
alities and attitudes. Rules and
systems of any sort can become
formal and mechanical, and if
they do, the impersonality of the
institutional machine, which is
a main cause of the trouble, is
perpetuated. The machine is a
good servant but a bad master.
When the University becomes
a vast teaching machine, it turns
out robots or rebels — or some
of both.
