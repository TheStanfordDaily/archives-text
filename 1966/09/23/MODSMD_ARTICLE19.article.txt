# Student Protests Mark Busy Year

Successful progress creeps
from point to point, testing each
step."—Whitehead.
The academic year 1965-66
was one of student unrest. It
was a year of Vietnam and na
palm; of liberalized rules over
worship; of sexual rights; and
the election of David Harris as
student body president.
Here are some of the high
and low points of Stanford Uni
versity in its 74th year.
BLOOD FOR VIETNAM —
Conflict in Southeast Asia was
a major theme of national and
campus news throughout the
year. Protest came to the for
front when a student committee
sought blood for victims of the
Viet Cong, and Stanford drew
national attention for its first
bleed-in.
NEW CAMPUS DEDICATED
—A resort hotel in Semmering,
Austria, became Stanford's
fourth European study center. A
quarter later, Harlaxton Manor
in England was dedicated, and
students found a greater lan
guage barrier there than at any
other campus.
GO, GO, FIVE IN A ROW—
An Indian triumph over Cal, 9-7,
gave the Tribe its fifth straight
Big Game victory. Cal was
ahead in the last quarter, 7-3,
but Stanford gained 70 yards in
11 plays for its winning touch
down.
FONDLE IT— Although few
took them seriously at first, the
Stanford Sexual Rights Forum
(SSRF) emerged during dead
week of fall quarter. It later
gained student support, and a
spring referendum resulted in a
student request for free distri
bution of contraceptives by the
Health Service. Student-Admin
istration discussion began, but
contraceptives which once were
given out suddenly weren't.
LOSS OF UNlON—Despite
protest from Students, Union
residence was closed down to
provide space for a students'
services center. Residents bitter
ly criticized their displacement
to the sterile high rises, but soon
found their new quarters quite
acceptable.
A WORD FROM THE SPON
SORS—Winter quarter saw the
beginning of controversy over
sponsor selection. All 25 Wilbur
sponsors originally refused Fac
ulty Master Eric Hutchinson the
right of veto, and compromise
was slow in coming. Decisions
seemed to change day, by day,
and final selection was post

poned until dead week five mon
ths later. Meanwhile, freshmen
got along just as always.
AND THEN THERE WERE
FIVE— Student members of the
Committee of Fifteen faced
problems of communication, and
an issue-minded Legislature de
cided it was time for a change.
But then some people yelled
"foul" and a student referendum
proved to be inconclusive. A
compromise was reached, and
the students were replaced.
"STANFORD IS NON DE
NOMINATIONAL . . The
Board of Trustees approved use
of worship facilities by varying
faiths, thereby permitting ex
pansion of religious activities
on campus. Later, B. Davie Na
pier of Yale Divinity School was
made Dean of the Chapel.
THE BOYS FROM FRESNO
—Final candidates for ASSU
Presidency were two juniors
from Fresno: David Harris and
Robert Klein. Harris won by a
600-vote margin in a record turn
out. Alumni reactions to his
platform of student activism
was swift and negative.
NEW RULES FOR BOOZE—
A decision by the Board of Trus
tees legalized alcoholic bever
ages for students over 21 in
campus residences. Said Presi
dent Sterling: "Individual re
sponsibility and respect for law
will be enhanced by entrusting
to the students a greater respon
sibility for compliance with
State law and by the removal of
complete prohibitions which are
not enforceable in practice."
WHERE THE GIRLS ARE
Social regulations became an
other major area of student-Uni
versity conflict, and the Social
Regulations Committee voted it
self out of existence. Regula
tions remain.
THE HAIR AFFAIR—Fresh
man Pat Morrison set new track
records for his team, but some
people found his long hair im
proper. The British runner was
excluded from the season's last
meet. Letters in the Daily ar
gued the issue on both sides,
but Morrison kept his hair the
way he liked it. Meanwhile, the
team lost to Cal.
CLASSIFIED CONTRACTS—
The University announced it
held limited contracts with the
CIA following national stories
about that organization's activi
ties at other campuses. Involve
ment in secret research was
questioned b* students and fac
ulty, although no settlement
was reached. A special meeting
open to all members of the Uni

versity community was called
for dead week, spring quarter,
to discuss research as well as
Selective Service pressures.
STUDENT SIT-IN—Some stu
dents, dissatisfied with the Uni
versity's handling of Selective
Service tests and other involve
ment with the Vietnam war,
staged a sit-in at President Ster
ling's office. The President pro
posed a private meeting with
the protesters, but they insisted
on open, community-wide meet
ings. After 50 hours, the stu
dents left and are now being
tried by student judicial coun
cils.
