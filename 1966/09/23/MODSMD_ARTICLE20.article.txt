# BECAUSE OF DRAFT
## More ROTC Interest Seen 
### 
ROTC Departments on cam
pus foresee an increase in in
terest in ROTC programs this
academic year. According to
ROTC faculty members, this in
crease reflects the stimulus of
ROTC Vitalization Act of 1964
and pressures of the draft. This
Act increased retainer pay for
Advanced Course Cadets and
made available a Two Year Pro
gram for all services.
Colonel David Y. Nanney, Pro
fessor of Military Science, feels
that the increased Selective Ser
vice calls have made young peo
ple more conscious of the need
for planning their futures. He
points out that the education
received in college is basically
officer education and that the
person who avails himself of
ROTC expends only a small in
vestment of time compared with
the long range advantages of
military service as an officer.
Army is Recruiting
Colonel Nanney stated that
openings are available for fresh
men and, in certain cases, soph
omores for enrollment in the
Army ROTC Four Year Pro
gram. This program, which
leads to commissioning as a
Second Lieutenant consists of
the Basic Course during the
Freshman and Sophomore years
and an Advanced Course during
the Junior and Senior years. A
six week Summer Camp is at
tended as part of the Advanced
Course. Colonel Nanney expects
a large freshman enrollment in
the Army program.
The Air Force is concentra

ting on the two year route to a
commission, according to Ma
jor Matthews, Professor of
Aerospace Studies. "Entry to
our course has become very
competitive with a limit of 21
new members this year," he
said. High academic standing in
the University is necessary and
Freshmen and Sophomores have
no AFROTC classroom work to
interfere with this objective.
An extracurricular organiza
tion, the Mitchell Flight, has
been formed to familiarize men
waiting entry to the regular
course with the Air Force and
the local AFROTC program.
Several functions, including jet
orientation rides, are planned
each month bringing General
Studies activity credits for ac
tive Freshmen and Sophomores.
Graduate students are also now
eligible for the two year course
and related activities. Applica
tion a year in advance of actual
class enrollment is necessary to
complete the selection process.
Many Vacancies Exist
The Angel Flight, the girl's
auxiliary to the Air Force ROTC
and also a General Studies ac
tivities credit group, is now
signing up undergraduates for
its Air Force oriented service
program.
Captain C. W. Brigham, Pro

feasor of Naval Science, an
nounced that there are still va
cancies in the NROTC Contract
program. The NROTC Contract
program exists for those college
students who wish to be avail
able to serve their country for
a specified period as reserve of
ficers in the Navy or Marine
Corps.
There are no restrictions on
the courses in which a contract
student may enroll. Active duty
may be deferred to permit grad
uate studies. The contract stu
dent upon graduation is com
missioned Ensign in the U.S.
Navy Reserve or as Second
Lieutenant in the U.S. Marine
Corps Reserve. He will serve on
active duty for three years.
