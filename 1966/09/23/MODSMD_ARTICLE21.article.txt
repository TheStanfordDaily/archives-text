# KZSU On The Air
## 
### RICH TOWER 
Something is going on under
neath Memorial Auditorium:
speeches, classical concerts, foot
ball games, folk music, jazz.
What is it? KZSU, Stanford's
student-operated radio station,
is back on the air. Broadcasting
to Stanford dormitories at 880
on the AM dial and to the sur
rounding community at 90.1
FM, KZSU offers diverse pro
gramming in music and public
affairs.
It's no simple job to operate a
radio station. This one takes the
efforts of 170 students and costs
some five thousand dollars a
year to keep on the air. Pro
grams must be planned, news
must be prepared, equipment
kept in repair, continuity pre
served. All this takes the special
talents of many people.
The station was not always
this big. KZSU began shortly
after World War II as a small,
student-oriented station and re
mained as such for a number of
years. However, in the pasi
three years the station's staff
has increased six-fold, and in
1964, with the start of FM
broadcasting, KZSU gained an
estimated potential audience of
200,000.
Run by Students
The station is owned by the
trustees of the University, but
the responsibility of running It
is entirely the students'. No out
side help, other than the print
ing of the program guide, is
used. Expenses are paid for en
tirely by advertising revenue,
and money for capital improve
ments is raised by public con
certs and tape recording services
offered by the station.
KZSU draws its programming
from the vast resources of the
University, a unique advantage.
Every program is narrated by a
student interested in the field,
and since weekly programs are
the rule, every night has a dif
ferent—and personal sound.
Variety In Programming
During the public affairs
show, important speeches given

on the campus are rebroadca6t
and special programs of Univer
sity interest are given, while
the news programs feature
comments and clarifications of
current events by Stanford pro
fessors and students. On Satur
days, home football games are
broadcast live, while on Sun
days, programming includes the
Memorial Church service at
eleven.
The station now broadcasts
off the campus over its FM
channel. KZSU is now heard on
the lower peninsula, the Oak
land hills, and the top of Mt.
Tamalpias, sixty miles to the

north. The station, attempts to
prensent suitable programming
in its role as a University volet
to the outlying community.
The station is run by ama
teurs; in fact, there is only one
communications major anion?
the officers. Some mistakes ar<
made. Even so, the station cor
sistently presents a slate of vita
and interesting programs. Per
haps former manager Penny 1 «i
land best sums up the staff"
feelings: "There are man>
places where a person can g<
on the dial if he wants to tun
his mind off. I don't see why wt
should be one of them."
