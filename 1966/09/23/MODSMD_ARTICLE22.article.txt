# Rep Theater Opens Second Season of Pro, Grad Drama
## 
### CRAIG LUBBOCK Staff Editor 
The Stanford Repertory Com
pany (Rep) is entering its sec
ond season as a pioneer in resi
dent theater combining top
caliber professional productions

with a graduate training pro
gram in the theater arts.
While bringing both classical
and contemporary drama to the
Stanford - Bay Area community,
the Rep is providing "a more
realistic situation" for the gra

duate study of drama, according
to Robert Heller, manager of
publicity and promotion for the
Company.
In a recent interview with the
Daily, Heller drew an analogy
to field work research and noted
that the Stanford-initiated pro
gram was being adopted at the
University of Michigan and
Chapel Hill.
Working with a $300,000 grant
from the Rockefeller Founda
tion, Stanford's Repertory The
ater established itself on two
largely untested premises. Ac
cording to Robert Loper, pro
ducing director, the basic as
sumption is "that the profession
al artist can bring to the Univer
sity community a new challenge
and excitement; that the Uni
versity, in turn, can provide a
working atmosphere and an
audience that will stimulate the
best achievement from the
theater artist." As a result the
Rep turned in some very fine
and stimulating performances—
novel in their approach and
artistically challenging.
The premiere season offered
Moliere's farce "That Scoundrel
Scapin," a Thornton Wilder com
edy "The Skin of our Teeth,"
"Prometheus Bound," a classical
tragedy by Aeschylus, Shake
speare's "All's Well That Ends
Well," and finally Bertolt
Brecht's "The Goodwoman of
Setzuan," a fable of morality.
1966-67
Plans for the 1966-67 season
call for an expansion of the Com
pany's function in the Univer
sity and the community. Accord
ing to Heller, the Rep will be
"stressing the image of a re
spected professional organiza
tion capable of Broadway qual
ity showmanship." Heller point
ed out the Stanford group con
sists of top salaried performers,
all but one of whom has starred
on Broadway.
Many of the actors have been
and still are involved in national
television and movies: Gerald
Hiken, "T.H.E. Cat," Loretta
Leversee, movie version of "Bel
Kaufman's best selling novel,
Up the Down Staircase, Paul
Winfield, "The Milton Berle
Show" and the film comedy
"Who's Minding the Mint?,"
Morgan Sterne, "The Doctors,"
and Gilbert Green, "Get Smart"
and the MGM production "Don't
Make Waves."
Five of the performers are
members of the famed Actor's
Studio in New York City. Heller
expressed the hope of drawing
some exceptional talent to the
Stanford area in terms of criti
cism as well as acting through
this association.
In promoting its role in the
University and community, and
to some extent in the national
dramatic scene, Heller sketched
some ideas which would bring
the Rep to the local high schools
and grade schools in some sort
of regional troupe work. He also
mentioned the possibility of
guest work in such professional
centers as Chicago, U.C.L.A.,

and Lincoln Center in New
York..
New Student Rates
As far as the Rep's relation to
the campus, the high cost of
tickets which discouraged stu
dents last year has been reduced.
Student rates will be $8.00 for a
season subscription (4 shows)
for weekend performances and
$6.00 for the weeknights. Single
tickets will be $2.00 and $1.50,
but the best choice of seats will
go to the subscription holders,
emphasized Peter Troxell, man
aging director.
New this year is the Reper
tory box office in Memorial Au
ditorium. Hours are 10-6 nor
maliy, 10-9 during production.
Best bet from Troxell is to pur
chase tickets at the Auditorium
rather than Tresidder box office.
Antony and Cleopatra
The second season will open
with a new production of Shake
speare's "Antony and Cleopat
ra." Erik Vos, the imaginative
Dutch director whose startling
"Prometheus Bound" and "That
Scoundrel Scapin" were pre
miere season highlights, will di
rect the tragedy, scheduled for
an Oct. 19 opening. Troxell
hinted at new and exciting
things from Vos who looks at
the play not so much historical
ly in terms of Egypt and Rome
and the leaders which ruled
them, but as the study of An
tony, the Man, and what moti
vates him.
Consequently many scenes
and famous lines have been cut.
The stage in Memorial Audi
torium is being reconstructed
with a thrust, ramps and a re
volve and will extend into the
audience as in "Prometheus."
The set has been designed as
an abstraction of the muscular
vascular system of man and the
music simulates his biological
inner workings.
John Gay's 18th century musi
cal play "The Beggar's Opera,"
perhaps better known in its
famous modern adaption "The
Threepenny Opera," will be the
second offering. Third-year
graduate student John Wright
will direct. Wright is a candidate
in the Master of Fine Arts
(M.F.A.) program.
Chekhov >
Anton Chekhov's "The Cherry
Orchard" will open in March.
This play will be directed by Mel
Shapiro, on leave from New
York University for the pro
duction. He directed two plays
last season at Stanford.

season subscription (4 shows)
for weekend performances and
$6.00 for the weeknights. Single
tickets will be $2.00 and $1.50,
but the best choice of seats will
go to the subscription holders,
emphasized Peter Troxell, man
aging director.
New this year is the Reper
tory box office in Memorial Au
ditorium. Hours are 10-6 nor
maliy, 10-9 during production.
Best bet from Troxell is to pur
chase tickets at the Auditorium
rather than Tresidder box office.
Antony and Cleopatra
The second season will open
with a new production of Shake
speare's "Antony and Cleopat
ra." Erik Vos, the imaginative
Dutch director whose startling
"Prometheus Bound" and "That
Scoundrel Scapin" were pre
miere season highlights, will di
rect the tragedy, scheduled for
an Oct. 19 opening. Troxell
hinted at new and exciting
things from Vos who looks at
the play not so much historical
ly in terms of Egypt and Rome
and the leaders which ruled
them, but as the study of An
tony, the Man, and what moti
vates him.
Consequently many scenes
and famous lines have been cut.
The stage in Memorial Audi
torium is being reconstructed
with a thrust, ramps and a re
volve and will extend into the
audience as in "Prometheus."
The set has been designed as
an abstraction of the muscular
vascular system of man and the
music simulates his biological
inner workings.
John Gay's 18th century musi
cal play "The Beggar's Opera,"
perhaps better known in its
famous modern adaption "The
Threepenny Opera," will be the
second offering. Third-year
graduate student John Wright
will direct. Wright is a candidate
in the Master of Fine Arts
(M.F.A.) program.
Chekhov >
Anton Chekhov's "The Cherry
Orchard" will open in March.
This play will be directed by Mel
Shapiro, on leave from New
York University for the pro
duction. He directed two plays
last season at Stanford.
The Stanford Repertory Com
pany (Rep) is entering its sec
ond season as a pioneer in resi
dent theater combining top
caliber professional productions

with a graduate training pro
gram in the theater arts.
While bringing both classical
and contemporary drama to the
Stanford - Bay Area community,
the Rep is providing "a more
realistic situation" for the gra

duate study of drama, according
to Robert Heller, manager of
publicity and promotion for the
Company.
In a recent interview with the
Daily, Heller drew an analogy
to field work research and noted
that the Stanford-initiated pro
gram was being adopted at the
University of Michigan and
Chapel Hill.
Working with a $300,000 grant
from the Rockefeller Founda
tion, Stanford's Repertory The
ater established itself on two
largely untested premises. Ac
cording to Robert Loper, pro
ducing director, the basic as
sumption is "that the profession
al artist can bring to the Univer
sity community a new challenge
and excitement; that the Uni
versity, in turn, can provide a
working atmosphere and an
audience that will stimulate the
best achievement from the
theater artist." As a result the
Rep turned in some very fine
and stimulating performances—
novel in their approach and
artistically challenging.
The premiere season offered
Moliere's farce "That Scoundrel
Scapin," a Thornton Wilder com
edy "The Skin of our Teeth,"
"Prometheus Bound," a classical
tragedy by Aeschylus, Shake
speare's "All's Well That Ends
Well," and finally Bertolt
Brecht's "The Goodwoman of
Setzuan," a fable of morality.
1966-67
Plans for the 1966-67 season
call for an expansion of the Com
pany's function in the Univer
sity and the community. Accord
ing to Heller, the Rep will be
"stressing the image of a re
spected professional organiza
tion capable of Broadway qual
ity showmanship." Heller point
ed out the Stanford group con
sists of top salaried performers,
all but one of whom has starred
on Broadway.
Many of the actors have been
and still are involved in national
television and movies: Gerald
Hiken, "T.H.E. Cat," Loretta
Leversee, movie version of "Bel
Kaufman's best selling novel,
Up the Down Staircase, Paul
Winfield, "The Milton Berle
Show" and the film comedy
"Who's Minding the Mint?,"
Morgan Sterne, "The Doctors,"
and Gilbert Green, "Get Smart"
and the MGM production "Don't
Make Waves."
Five of the performers are
members of the famed Actor's
Studio in New York City. Heller
expressed the hope of drawing
some exceptional talent to the
Stanford area in terms of criti
cism as well as acting through
this association.
In promoting its role in the
University and community, and
to some extent in the national
dramatic scene, Heller sketched
some ideas which would bring
the Rep to the local high schools
and grade schools in some sort
of regional troupe work. He also
mentioned the possibility of
guest work in such professional
centers as Chicago, U.C.L.A.,

and Lincoln Center in New
York..

Scapin," a Thornton Wilder com
edy "The Skin of our Teeth,"
"Prometheus Bound," a classical
tragedy by Aeschylus, Shake
speare's "All's Well That Ends
Well," and finally Bertolt
Brecht's "The Goodwoman of
Setzuan," a fable of morality.
1966-67
Plans for the 1966-67 season
call for an expansion of the Com
pany's function in the Univer
sity and the community. Accord
ing to Heller, the Rep will be
"stressing the image of a re
spected professional organiza
tion capable of Broadway qual
ity showmanship." Heller point
ed out the Stanford group con
sists of top salaried performers,
all but one of whom has starred
on Broadway.
Many of the actors have been
and still are involved in national
television and movies: Gerald
Hiken, "T.H.E. Cat," Loretta
Leversee, movie version of "Bel
Kaufman's best selling novel,
Up the Down Staircase, Paul
Winfield, "The Milton Berle
Show" and the film comedy
"Who's Minding the Mint?,"
Morgan Sterne, "The Doctors,"
and Gilbert Green, "Get Smart"
and the MGM production "Don't
Make Waves."
Five of the performers are
members of the famed Actor's
Studio in New York City. Heller
expressed the hope of drawing
some exceptional talent to the
Stanford area in terms of criti
cism as well as acting through
this association.
In promoting its role in the
University and community, and
to some extent in the national
dramatic scene, Heller sketched
some ideas which would bring
the Rep to the local high schools
and grade schools in some sort
of regional troupe work. He also
mentioned the possibility of
guest work in such professional
centers as Chicago, U.C.L.A.,

and Lincoln Center in New
York..
New Student Rates
As far as the Rep's relation to
the campus, the high cost of
tickets which discouraged stu
dents last year has been reduced.
Student rates will be $8.00 for a
season subscription (4 shows)
for weekend performances and
$6.00 for the weeknights. Single
tickets will be $2.00 and $1.50,
but the best choice of seats will
go to the subscription holders,
emphasized Peter Troxell, man
aging director.
New this year is the Reper
tory box office in Memorial Au
ditorium. Hours are 10-6 nor
maliy, 10-9 during production.
Best bet from Troxell is to pur
chase tickets at the Auditorium
rather than Tresidder box office.
Antony and Cleopatra
The second season will open
with a new production of Shake
speare's "Antony and Cleopat
ra." Erik Vos, the imaginative
Dutch director whose startling
"Prometheus Bound" and "That
Scoundrel Scapin" were pre
miere season highlights, will di
rect the tragedy, scheduled for
an Oct. 19 opening. Troxell
hinted at new and exciting
things from Vos who looks at
the play not so much historical
ly in terms of Egypt and Rome
and the leaders which ruled
them, but as the study of An
tony, the Man, and what moti
vates him.
Consequently many scenes
and famous lines have been cut.
The stage in Memorial Audi
torium is being reconstructed
with a thrust, ramps and a re
volve and will extend into the
audience as in "Prometheus."
The set has been designed as
an abstraction of the muscular
vascular system of man and the
music simulates his biological
inner workings.
John Gay's 18th century musi
cal play "The Beggar's Opera,"
perhaps better known in its
famous modern adaption "The
Threepenny Opera," will be the
second offering. Third-year
graduate student John Wright
will direct. Wright is a candidate
in the Master of Fine Arts
(M.F.A.) program.
Chekhov >
Anton Chekhov's "The Cherry
Orchard" will open in March.
This play will be directed by Mel
Shapiro, on leave from New
York University for the pro
duction. He directed two plays
last season at Stanford.
The Stanford Repertory Com
pany (Rep) is entering its sec
ond season as a pioneer in resi
dent theater combining top
caliber professional productions

with a graduate training pro
gram in the theater arts.
While bringing both classical
and contemporary drama to the
Stanford - Bay Area community,
the Rep is providing "a more
realistic situation" for the gra

duate study of drama, according
to Robert Heller, manager of
publicity and promotion for the
Company.
In a recent interview with the
Daily, Heller drew an analogy
to field work research and noted
that the Stanford-initiated pro
gram was being adopted at the
University of Michigan and
Chapel Hill.
Working with a $300,000 grant
from the Rockefeller Founda
tion, Stanford's Repertory The
ater established itself on two
largely untested premises. Ac
cording to Robert Loper, pro
ducing director, the basic as
sumption is "that the profession
al artist can bring to the Univer
sity community a new challenge
and excitement; that the Uni
versity, in turn, can provide a
working atmosphere and an
audience that will stimulate the
best achievement from the
theater artist." As a result the
Rep turned in some very fine
and stimulating performances—
novel in their approach and
artistically challenging.
