# Antony... Cleopatra
## 
### 
As the final event of the 1966-
â€¢67 season, the Stanford Reper
tory Theater will present George
S. Kaufman and Moss Hart's
"Once in a Lifetime," a comic
view of Hollywood in the '20s.
Edward Parone, editor, critic
and Off-Broadway director, will

stage the farce. This will be the
first American play by the Rep
and Heller promises more to
come.
Also on the season schedule
are a pair of one-acts for the
Little Theater: Tennessee Wil
liams' "Gnadige Fraulein" in
its West Coast premiere and

"Out at Sea," a new play from
Poland by Slawomir Mrozek be
ing staged professionally for the
first time in this country.
The second Little Theater pro
duction will be "Inadinissable
Evidence," by England's John
Osborne. Professor Loper will
direct the drama.


Morgan Sterne and Loretta Leversee rehearse opening lines In the
lead roles of Antony and Cleopatra. The dramatic prominence of
Antony captured in this picture suggests Vos' Interest in the Man
rather than In the history. This is a concept which promises to
underlie the whole Vos interpretation of the Shakespsearean classic.
