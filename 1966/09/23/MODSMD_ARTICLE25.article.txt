# The 						Compleat Entertainer

### CURT KECK Entertainment Editor 
Worthy of note to all fledgling
freshmen In the nadir of ac
quaintance with Stanford—land
of the tall, lean tree and the
squat, bushy pomegranate
plant: STANFORD HAS AR
RIVED ON THE ENTERTAIN
MENT SCENE. This year should
be really exciting around camp
us with Stanford Repertory The
atre and the Speech and Drama
Department's productions,
Ram's Head musicals and one
acts, ASSU concert series, and
Tresidder films and dances.
Theater at Stanford is on the
up and will hopefully, and al
most assuredly, reach new
heights of excellence in coming
productions. The Stanford Rep
ertory Theatre, comprised most
ly of graduate students and resi
dent professionals, will stage
"Antony and Cleopatra" in Me
morial Auditorium to run from
October 19 to November 5. The
summons is out for white and
fiegro students to play the parts
of Roman and Egyptian soldiers
in the production.
The Repertory Theatre will
swing back into action in the
Winter Quarter with "Beggar's
Opera" and Anton Chekhov's
"The Cherry Orchard." Moss
Hart and George S. Kaufman's
comic view of Hollywood in the
1920'5, "Once Upon A Lifetime,"
in the springtime should be
worthwhile as well.
Repertory Theatre
The Repertory Theatre is also
scheduling two productions for
the Little Theater: a double bill
of one-acts, "Gnadiges Fraulein"
by Tennessee Williams and a new
play from Poland, "Out at Sea."
The English smash, "Inadmis
sable Evidence" by the accom
plished young English play
wright John Osborne, will be
staged latter.
The name "Gaieties" shoots a
tingle of rapt anticipation up and

down the spines of Stanford
theater-goers in the Fall Quar
ter much in the same manner
that its calendar coeval, "Big
Game," excites the fraternity
bears and freshman ladies. Sooo,
why not combine them? That's
just what Ram's Head, that mys
terious and exclusive cult of
thespian moguls, is going to do
in their fall production of
"AAAUGHHH or Why Yellow
Bellied Sapsuckers Eat Rasp
berry Licorice or even Hario
vitch Versus The Red Machine."
Ram's Head Gaities will open for
a three day run November 16, 17,
18. Try-outs for "AAUGHHH"
will be on Tuesday, Wednesday,
and Thursday of next week in
the Little Theater.
Blc Game Hanky Panky
"AAAUGHHH" is the original
recountal of high Russian coun
ter-counter-espionage, fiendishly
conceived in the dank chambers
of the Soviet Insecurity
Council, to trade the United
States sundry Soviet cultural
affects like the Ballet, Opera,
etc., for Big Game. Somehow
the Russians have stumbled
across the revelation that Big
Game is a tool for transmitting
coded information to American
agents. The skinny and the fat
of the caper is to bring Big
Game to Russia and thereby
break the code destroying that
sinister Hydra of American
hanky-panky.
The other student drama or
ganization on campus — and a
very prominent corps of top
notch actors judging from last
year's productions — is the
Speech and Drama Department's
Undergraduate Drama Guild.
"The Beaux' Stratagem" by
George Sarquar will be the kick
off production running Novem
ber 9-12 and will be followed dur
ing the year by "Playboy of the
Western World" and Molliere's
"Don Juan" (if any of you frosh
fellows consider yourself such
and haven't been disillusioned
by Spring Quarter, you might
try-out for the lead role.) Try
outs for "Beaux' Stratagem" will
be on September 28 and 29 at
7:30 in the Nitery.
Big things are happening at
Tresidder this year. The film
selection for the Friday and Sat
urday night movies is something
just less than fantastic and
something a lot more than the
run-of-the-reel, cinematic refuse
that kick around college camp
uses. If you are an Ingmar Berg
man fan, and afterall who isn't

v xmmumss&tmisx?.
these days, the Tresidder film
font will bless you with a flock
of his flicks. And then, of course,
there is the incomparable Hum
phrey Bogart, and afterall who
is there these days that doesn't
love old Bogey. Tresidder will
intersperse the Bogart films with
the Bergman ones and maybe, if
the rumor rot is true, we might
have a film series of that actor
turned oleaginous orator, Ron
nie Reagan.
Guitars In Tresidder
Tresidder also will sponsor
several campus dances. The first
of these famed bacchanalia will
"work it on out" on October 6
to the groove notes of the Paul
Butterfield Blues Band, specially
imported from San Francisco's
Fillmore Auditorium. There will
be another dance on October 14
featuring the two rock groups,
The Grateful Dead and The Wild
Flower.
Tonight in Memorial Auditori
um Jon Hendrick's, one of the
profession's most respected
blues and swing jazz singers,
will perform along with Glenn
Cannon from the Stanford Rep
ertory Theatre. Cannon will pre
sent a short one-act play as an
introduction to the Repertory
Theatre's scheduled productions.
The String Quartet from the
San Francisco Symphony and
Stanford's very own singing
group — of virtuoso accomplish
ments, I might add — the Mendi
cants, will highlight the re
mainder of the program.
Another feature of tSanford
entertainment is the student con
cert. These programs are given
by the orchestra, the band, the
chorus, and the choir and al
most always are excellent per
formances.
So there you have a sketchy
run-down of a few of the "hap
penings" around campus. The
portals of Stanford entertain
ment are open. Walk in. Look
around. Sit back, unlax, and en
joy yourself.

fiegro students to play the parts
of Roman and Egyptian soldiers
in the production.
The Repertory Theatre will
swing back into action in the
Winter Quarter with "Beggar's
Opera" and Anton Chekhov's
"The Cherry Orchard." Moss
Hart and George S. Kaufman's
comic view of Hollywood in the
1920'5, "Once Upon A Lifetime,"
in the springtime should be
worthwhile as well.
Repertory Theatre
The Repertory Theatre is also
scheduling two productions for
the Little Theater: a double bill
of one-acts, "Gnadiges Fraulein"
by Tennessee Williams and a new
play from Poland, "Out at Sea."
The English smash, "Inadmis
sable Evidence" by the accom
plished young English play
wright John Osborne, will be
staged latter.
The name "Gaieties" shoots a
tingle of rapt anticipation up and

down the spines of Stanford
theater-goers in the Fall Quar
ter much in the same manner
that its calendar coeval, "Big
Game," excites the fraternity
bears and freshman ladies. Sooo,
why not combine them? That's
just what Ram's Head, that mys
terious and exclusive cult of
thespian moguls, is going to do
in their fall production of
"AAAUGHHH or Why Yellow
Bellied Sapsuckers Eat Rasp
berry Licorice or even Hario
vitch Versus The Red Machine."
Ram's Head Gaities will open for
a three day run November 16, 17,
18. Try-outs for "AAUGHHH"
will be on Tuesday, Wednesday,
and Thursday of next week in
the Little Theater.
Blc Game Hanky Panky
"AAAUGHHH" is the original
recountal of high Russian coun
ter-counter-espionage, fiendishly
conceived in the dank chambers
of the Soviet Insecurity
Council, to trade the United
States sundry Soviet cultural
affects like the Ballet, Opera,
etc., for Big Game. Somehow
the Russians have stumbled
across the revelation that Big
Game is a tool for transmitting
coded information to American
agents. The skinny and the fat
of the caper is to bring Big
Game to Russia and thereby
break the code destroying that
sinister Hydra of American
hanky-panky.
The other student drama or
ganization on campus — and a
very prominent corps of top
notch actors judging from last
year's productions — is the
Speech and Drama Department's
Undergraduate Drama Guild.
"The Beaux' Stratagem" by
George Sarquar will be the kick
off production running Novem
ber 9-12 and will be followed dur
ing the year by "Playboy of the
Western World" and Molliere's
"Don Juan" (if any of you frosh
fellows consider yourself such
and haven't been disillusioned
by Spring Quarter, you might
try-out for the lead role.) Try
outs for "Beaux' Stratagem" will
be on September 28 and 29 at
7:30 in the Nitery.
Big things are happening at
Tresidder this year. The film
selection for the Friday and Sat
urday night movies is something
just less than fantastic and
something a lot more than the
run-of-the-reel, cinematic refuse
that kick around college camp
uses. If you are an Ingmar Berg
man fan, and afterall who isn't

v xmmumss&tmisx?.
these days, the Tresidder film
font will bless you with a flock
of his flicks. And then, of course,
there is the incomparable Hum
phrey Bogart, and afterall who
is there these days that doesn't
love old Bogey. Tresidder will
intersperse the Bogart films with
the Bergman ones and maybe, if
the rumor rot is true, we might
have a film series of that actor
turned oleaginous orator, Ron
nie Reagan.
Guitars In Tresidder
Tresidder also will sponsor
several campus dances. The first
of these famed bacchanalia will
"work it on out" on October 6
to the groove notes of the Paul
Butterfield Blues Band, specially
imported from San Francisco's
Fillmore Auditorium. There will
be another dance on October 14
featuring the two rock groups,
The Grateful Dead and The Wild
Flower.
Tonight in Memorial Auditori
um Jon Hendrick's, one of the
profession's most respected
blues and swing jazz singers,
will perform along with Glenn
Cannon from the Stanford Rep
ertory Theatre. Cannon will pre
sent a short one-act play as an
introduction to the Repertory
Theatre's scheduled productions.
The String Quartet from the
San Francisco Symphony and
Stanford's very own singing
group — of virtuoso accomplish
ments, I might add — the Mendi
cants, will highlight the re
mainder of the program.
Another feature of tSanford
entertainment is the student con
cert. These programs are given
by the orchestra, the band, the
chorus, and the choir and al
most always are excellent per
formances.
So there you have a sketchy
run-down of a few of the "hap
penings" around campus. The
portals of Stanford entertain
ment are open. Walk in. Look
around. Sit back, unlax, and en
joy yourself.

tingle of rapt anticipation up and

down the spines of Stanford
theater-goers in the Fall Quar
ter much in the same manner
that its calendar coeval, "Big

why not combine them? That's
just what Ram's Head, that mys

thespian moguls, is going to do
in their fall production of
"AAAUGHHH or Why Yellow
Bellied Sapsuckers Eat Rasp

Blc Game Hanky Panky
"AAAUGHHH" is the original
recountal of high Russian coun
ter-counter-espionage, fiendishly
conceived in the dank chambers
of the Soviet Insecurity
Council, to trade the United
States sundry Soviet cultural
affects like the Ballet, Opera,
etc., for Big Game. Somehow
the Russians have stumbled
across the revelation that Big
Game is a tool for transmitting
coded information to American
agents. The skinny and the fat
of the caper is to bring Big
Game to Russia and thereby
break the code destroying that
sinister Hydra of American
hanky-panky.
The other student drama or
ganization on campus — and a
very prominent corps of top
notch actors judging from last
year's productions — is the
Speech and Drama Department's
Undergraduate Drama Guild.
"The Beaux' Stratagem" by
George Sarquar will be the kick
off production running Novem
ber 9-12 and will be followed dur
ing the year by "Playboy of the
Western World" and Molliere's
"Don Juan" (if any of you frosh
fellows consider yourself such
and haven't been disillusioned
by Spring Quarter, you might
try-out for the lead role.) Try
outs for "Beaux' Stratagem" will
be on September 28 and 29 at
7:30 in the Nitery.
Big things are happening at
Tresidder this year. The film
selection for the Friday and Sat
urday night movies is something
just less than fantastic and
something a lot more than the
run-of-the-reel, cinematic refuse
that kick around college camp
uses. If you are an Ingmar Berg
man fan, and afterall who isn't

v xmmumss&tmisx?.
these days, the Tresidder film
font will bless you with a flock
of his flicks. And then, of course,
there is the incomparable Hum
phrey Bogart, and afterall who
is there these days that doesn't
love old Bogey. Tresidder will
intersperse the Bogart films with
the Bergman ones and maybe, if
the rumor rot is true, we might
have a film series of that actor
turned oleaginous orator, Ron
nie Reagan.
Guitars In Tresidder
Tresidder also will sponsor
several campus dances. The first
of these famed bacchanalia will
"work it on out" on October 6
to the groove notes of the Paul
Butterfield Blues Band, specially
imported from San Francisco's
Fillmore Auditorium. There will
be another dance on October 14
featuring the two rock groups,
The Grateful Dead and The Wild
Flower.
Tonight in Memorial Auditori
um Jon Hendrick's, one of the
profession's most respected
blues and swing jazz singers,
will perform along with Glenn
Cannon from the Stanford Rep
ertory Theatre. Cannon will pre
sent a short one-act play as an
introduction to the Repertory
Theatre's scheduled productions.
The String Quartet from the
San Francisco Symphony and
Stanford's very own singing
group — of virtuoso accomplish
ments, I might add — the Mendi
cants, will highlight the re
mainder of the program.
Another feature of tSanford
entertainment is the student con
cert. These programs are given
by the orchestra, the band, the
chorus, and the choir and al
most always are excellent per
formances.
So there you have a sketchy
run-down of a few of the "hap
penings" around campus. The
portals of Stanford entertain
ment are open. Walk in. Look
around. Sit back, unlax, and en
joy yourself.
Worthy of note to all fledgling
freshmen In the nadir of ac
quaintance with Stanford—land
of the tall, lean tree and the
squat, bushy pomegranate
plant: STANFORD HAS AR
RIVED ON THE ENTERTAIN
MENT SCENE. This year should
be really exciting around camp
us with Stanford Repertory The
atre and the Speech and Drama
Department's productions,
Ram's Head musicals and one
acts, ASSU concert series, and
Tresidder films and dances.
Theater at Stanford is on the
up and will hopefully, and al
most assuredly, reach new
heights of excellence in coming
productions. The Stanford Rep
ertory Theatre, comprised most
ly of graduate students and resi
dent professionals, will stage
"Antony and Cleopatra" in Me
morial Auditorium to run from
October 19 to November 5. The
summons is out for white and
fiegro students to play the parts
of Roman and Egyptian soldiers
in the production.
The Repertory Theatre will
swing back into action in the
Winter Quarter with "Beggar's
Opera" and Anton Chekhov's
"The Cherry Orchard." Moss
Hart and George S. Kaufman's
comic view of Hollywood in the
1920'5, "Once Upon A Lifetime,"
in the springtime should be
worthwhile as well.
Repertory Theatre
The Repertory Theatre is also
scheduling two productions for
the Little Theater: a double bill
of one-acts, "Gnadiges Fraulein"

play from Poland, "Out at Sea."

sable Evidence" by the accom

wright John Osborne, will be
staged latter.
