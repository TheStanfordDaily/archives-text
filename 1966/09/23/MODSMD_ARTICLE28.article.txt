# Indians Win 25-21, Face Gophers Next
## 
### Gene Washington 
The Stanford Ret! travels to
Minnesota tomorrow to battle
against the Minnesota Gophers
in an intersectional game. After
a close 25-21 victory over San
Jose last week. Coach John
Ralston's boys are looking for
win number two against the
Gophers who were defeated last
week 24 0.
Both the Indians and the
Gophers have youthful teams
although the Indians have eight
more returning lettermen. Soph
omore quarterback Gene Wash
ington is expected to lead the
team again, and Ralston said he
hopes that the San Jose game
gave Washington enough ex
perience so that many mistakes
caused by Inexperience will not
be repeated.
Pass Defense
Stanford's big weakness in
the San Jo6e game was its pass
defense. Much of this week's
practice was spent in trying to
close the holes that Spartan end
Steve Cox so regularly found.
Closing these holes is a must
since the Gophers have a lead
ing All Star candidate in flank
erback Ken Last who is already
the greatest pass receiver in Go
pher history.
Washington lived up to little
of his advance notice until the
fourth quarter when the Cards
were down 21-10. Then, show
ing great poise, Washington ran
for a TD from the four and min
utes later threaded the needle
from 31 yards out to Bob Con
rad in the end zone.
Dave Lewis, last year's start
ing signal caller played most of
the game at flanker not only to
give Washington experience at
the quarterback spot, but also
because of a shoulder injury
that limited his throwing abil
ity.

Lewis was also back at his
old spot as the Indians' number
one punter. Against the Spar
tans he had three kicks and an
average of 44 yards.
Shoemaker Hits Placement
One of the more cheerful
points in last Saturday's duel
with the Spartans was the place
ment kicking of Bill Shoemaker.
After narrowly missing one at
tempt from over 40 yards out,
Shoemaker split the uprights
from 31 yards. He contributed
two more points with PAT place
ments and kicked off five times

for an average of 56.4 yards per
try.
The Tribe shows great poten
tial for a highly successful sea
son, but all facets of the Red at
tack need polishing. The game
against the Gophers, although it
is not a conference game, is tre
mendously important in terms
of the experience it will provide
the young team.

that limited his throwing abil
ity.

Lewis was also back at his
old spot as the Indians' number
one punter. Against the Spar
tans he had three kicks and an
average of 44 yards.
Shoemaker Hits Placement
One of the more cheerful
points in last Saturday's duel
with the Spartans was the place
ment kicking of Bill Shoemaker.
After narrowly missing one at
tempt from over 40 yards out,
Shoemaker split the uprights
from 31 yards. He contributed
two more points with PAT place
ments and kicked off five times

for an average of 56.4 yards per
try.
The Tribe shows great poten
tial for a highly successful sea
son, but all facets of the Red at
tack need polishing. The game
against the Gophers, although it
is not a conference game, is tre
mendously important in terms
of the experience it will provide
the young team.

The Stanford Ret! travels to
Minnesota tomorrow to battle
against the Minnesota Gophers
in an intersectional game. After
a close 25-21 victory over San
Jose last week. Coach John
Ralston's boys are looking for
win number two against the
Gophers who were defeated last
week 24 0.
Both the Indians and the
Gophers have youthful teams
although the Indians have eight
more returning lettermen. Soph
omore quarterback Gene Wash
ington is expected to lead the
team again, and Ralston said he
hopes that the San Jose game
gave Washington enough ex
perience so that many mistakes
caused by Inexperience will not
be repeated.
Pass Defense
Stanford's big weakness in
the San Jo6e game was its pass
defense. Much of this week's
practice was spent in trying to
close the holes that Spartan end
Steve Cox so regularly found.
Closing these holes is a must
since the Gophers have a lead
ing All Star candidate in flank
erback Ken Last who is already
the greatest pass receiver in Go
pher history.
Washington lived up to little
of his advance notice until the
fourth quarter when the Cards
were down 21-10. Then, show
ing great poise, Washington ran
for a TD from the four and min
utes later threaded the needle
from 31 yards out to Bob Con
rad in the end zone.
Dave Lewis, last year's start
ing signal caller played most of
the game at flanker not only to
give Washington experience at
the quarterback spot, but also
because of a shoulder injury
that limited his throwing abil
ity.
