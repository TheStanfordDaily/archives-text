The Stanford football team
squeaked by a weaker, but spir
ited San Jose State team last
Saturday, 25-21. The Indians, 20
point pre-game favorites, were
plagued by mistakes, and the
Spartans went into the final
quarter leading 21-10.
Then Gene Washington, the
highly touted sophomore quar
terback for the Indians, man
aged to shake off the jitters
and capped a drive with a four
yard run for the TD. Just six
minutes later, Washington
added the final margin with a
31 yard toss to end Bob Conrad.
With 2:33 left in the game the
Trojans were still in there try
ing, when reserve signal caller
Russ Munson's pass was inter
cepted by tackle A 1 Wilburn on
the Stanford 10.
Pass Defense
The Big Red pass defense was
in trouble all afternoon. Spartan
quarterback Danny Holman rid
dled the seccondary, alternating
flanker Walt Blackledge. Hol
man went 19 for 27 and 208
between end Steve Cox and
yards. Washington could only
put together six for 20 and 96
yards, although two of the six
went for touchdowns.
The Indians playing at home
before a crowd of 36,000 hardy

souls who sweltered in the 85
degree heat, took the opportun
ity to unveil a new play. The
play, known as "Fumble, kick,
and pray," was revealed late in
the second quarter when, on an
option around right end, Stan
ford flanker Dave Lewis bob
bled the pitch out from Wash

ington and then kicked the ball
10 yards downfield where it was
pounced upon by an alert In
dian lineman. The play resulted
in a first down.
One of the highpoints of the
afternoon was the kicking of
Bill Shoemaker. Shoemaker, a
placement specialist added five

points to the Big Red cause with
a 31 yard field goal and two
PAT's. In addition he kicked off
five times for an average of 56.4
yards per kick.
Minnesota Next
The Indians travel to Minne
sota tomorrow far an intersec
tional game against the Mine
sota Gophers. The next home
game for the Big Red is next
Saturday at 1:30 against Tulane
of the Southeast Conference.

Coach John Ralston expressed
c on si d e rable disappointment
with the overall performance of
his players in their first effort.
"We've got a long way to go,"
said Ralston, "but we'll get
there. We have the tools and we
intend to make the most- of
them."
