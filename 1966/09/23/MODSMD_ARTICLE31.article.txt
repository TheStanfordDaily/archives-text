# Eastern Invasion:
## Rowers 7th In Intercollegiates 
### CARL MUNDT 
Stanford's Varsity Crew fin
ished its most successful season
in a decade by sending two boats
to the Intercollegiate Rowing
Association Regatta held in
Syracuse, New York in June.
This marked the first time in
history that Stanford had at
tended the event with both Var
sity and Junior Varsity crews.
In the J.V. race the Indians
found themselves in last place
after one mile due to a poor
start. Then, however, the boat
caught fire and moved through
the field of 13 to challenge Wash
ington for 4th place by the end
of the race at the three mile
mark.
Stanford's powerful Varsity
boat approached the starting
line at Syracuse with revenge
In mind. Earlier in the season
Washington's Husk ie s had
nipped the Indians at the finish
line of the Western Sprints in
Vallejo, California for Stan
ford's only regular season de
feat.
Waters of Lake Onandoga
In the Varsity finals Stanford
started slowly keeping a wary
eye on Washington. At the end

of a mile they were 15th in a
field of 16. Then the Indians be
gan to singe the waters of Lake
Onandoga and moved up to 7th
place by the end of three miles
beating Washington by a whop
ping 27 seconds.
The IRA proved the East to
be faster than the western
schools but Stanford was with
out a doubt the best in the West
by finishing 7th behind Wiscon
sin, Navy, Princeton, Brown,
Cornell and Penn. California was
Bth, Washington 11th and UCLA
13th.
Coach Will Condon said after
the race: "Although our spirit
was tremendous, we were not in

as good shape as we thought.
On the average we were prob
ably 10 pounds heavy per man.
Next year even more emphasis
will be placed on achieving su
perb physical conditioning."
Sinking the Bears
Throughout the regular sea
son Stanford had enjoyed spec
tacular success. During the Big
Row with Cal five boatloads of
Golden Bears 6unk under Stan
ford's axe for the first time in
50 years. The Indians also swept
the Harbach Cup from UCLA
and Southern California for the
first time in 6 years. Undefeat
ed 3rd Varsity, 2nd Frosh and
3rd Frosh boats added to the
winning record.
Coach Condon expects another

fine year with five men from
last year's Varsity boat return
ing. Led by captain and stroke
Bill Stump, these include Larry
Mc√üride, Tim Cowles, John Stitt
and Rick Dawkins.
Also returning are four out
standing sophomores from the
J.V. boat. Of these Jim Madden,
who subsequently became a
member of the United States
Rowing team which competed in
the World Rowing Champion
ships at Bled, Jugoslavia earlier
thi6 month, is almost certain to
win a varsity seat. The others
are Bucky Westphall, Russ Bar
to and John Wilbor.
Perennial Letterman
In addition, seven out of eight
members of last year's unde

feated 3rd Varsity boat are re
turning. Larry Title and Gary
Anderson are expected to chal
lenge for Varsity positions. Not
to be discounted entirely is Rog
er Sullivan, perennial letter
winner and utility man, and
Sophomores Bob Thomas and
Steve Crossland.
The schedule for 1966-1967
season should be the toughest
one yet and includes Washing
ton with its entire Varsity boat
back, UCLA and arch-rivals Cal
ifornia. If the Indians' ever-im
proving oarsmen can make good
use of their experience and en
thusiasm, the coming season
will be even more successful
than last year's record-breaking
campaign.
