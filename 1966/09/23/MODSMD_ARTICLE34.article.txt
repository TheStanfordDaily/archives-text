# The 						Common Goal
## 
### 
Stanford is a much different place than it was
a year ago. A year of intensive student activism
has shaken the timbers of the University, and the
results have been both gratifying and dis
couraging.
The approval of on-campus denominational
worship, the liberalization of social regulations,
and the modification of University liquor policy
represent administration responses to long
standing demands. While these responses have
not been entirely satisfying, the goal can no
longer be questioned. In principle few would
contest a student's right to lead his own life,
hound only by his commitment to the Funda
mental Standard. It is frustrating, but not neces
sary, that principle lags behind reality.
More significant, however, than any of these
causes is the wide-scale student criticism of the
quality and style of Stanford education. As the
focus of student activism has shifted to a re
evaluation of higher education, the extent of
student commitment, in number and intensity,
has grown considerably. For the basic concern
about education is the one uniting tie in the aca
demic community which transcends its many
divisive crusades.
Having grasped the central issue in the life of
a university, student activism has proved that
students are willing to offer positive contribu
tions for the University's-betterment.
Education is the single consideration which

will dominate the academic year. Yet if the Uni
versity is to enjoy the cooperation of students,
faculty, and administration, rather than vacant
utterances by isolated leaders, each segment
must put education at the head of its agenda.
With President Sterling rests the responsibili
ty of initiating the detailed reappraisal of under
graduate education promised in January. How
ever any such study is necessarily handicapped
with the Provost's position vacant and the un
certain status of the empty Dean of Under
graduate Education post.
With the faculty rests the responsibility for
an approach to education which places the em
phasis on the independent and critical judgment
of the individual.
With Student Body President David Harris
rests the responsibility to articulate student
goals and to define what a Stanford education
should be. We commend his Education and
Housing Commissions as steps toward well
documented statements to be considered openly
by the entire academic community.
Academic year 1966-67 can be more than a
beginning. The time is ripe in all sectors of the
University community to examine the methods
and goals of Stanford education. Working to
gether as vitally concerned members of the same
community, students, faculty and administration
offer a significant contribution to the future of
the University.

More significant, however, than any of these
causes is the wide-scale student criticism of the
quality and style of Stanford education. As the
focus of student activism has shifted to a re
evaluation of higher education, the extent of
student commitment, in number and intensity,
has grown considerably. For the basic concern
about education is the one uniting tie in the aca
demic community which transcends its many
divisive crusades.
Having grasped the central issue in the life of
a university, student activism has proved that
students are willing to offer positive contribu
tions for the University's-betterment.
Education is the single consideration which

will dominate the academic year. Yet if the Uni
versity is to enjoy the cooperation of students,
faculty, and administration, rather than vacant
utterances by isolated leaders, each segment
must put education at the head of its agenda.
With President Sterling rests the responsibili
ty of initiating the detailed reappraisal of under
graduate education promised in January. How
ever any such study is necessarily handicapped
with the Provost's position vacant and the un
certain status of the empty Dean of Under
graduate Education post.
With the faculty rests the responsibility for
an approach to education which places the em
phasis on the independent and critical judgment
of the individual.
With Student Body President David Harris
rests the responsibility to articulate student
goals and to define what a Stanford education
should be. We commend his Education and
Housing Commissions as steps toward well
documented statements to be considered openly
by the entire academic community.
Academic year 1966-67 can be more than a
beginning. The time is ripe in all sectors of the
University community to examine the methods
and goals of Stanford education. Working to
gether as vitally concerned members of the same
community, students, faculty and administration
offer a significant contribution to the future of
the University.
Stanford is a much different place than it was
a year ago. A year of intensive student activism
has shaken the timbers of the University, and the
results have been both gratifying and dis
couraging.
The approval of on-campus denominational
worship, the liberalization of social regulations,
and the modification of University liquor policy
represent administration responses to long
standing demands. While these responses have
not been entirely satisfying, the goal can no
longer be questioned. In principle few would
contest a student's right to lead his own life,
hound only by his commitment to the Funda
mental Standard. It is frustrating, but not neces
sary, that principle lags behind reality.
