## Frosh Bring Enthusiasm Into Staid Upperclass Life 
### 
A fad so new that not even
LIFE magazine has heard of it
is sweeping college campuses.
It's called "freshman year."
Upperclass politicians, beauty
queens, athletes, and Phi Betes
are now as out as the Beatles.
The freshman class is the new
in-crowd.
In a nation that worships
youth, it is not altogether sur
prising that college campuses
should look up to their most
youthful members. There are,
however, several reasons why
this fad is especially widespread
at Stanford.
Designers and Dropouts
The days are long gone when
Stanford freshmen looked to up
perclassmen for guidance in col
legiate mores and fashions. As
everyone knows, "collegiate"
styles are now set by a select
editors and high school drop
outs. This means that high
schools are, on the average,
twice as collegiate as colleges.
And freshmen — the closest
ones to high school — emerge
as university trend-setters.
Moreover, the admissions of
fice has been assuring us for so
many years that the present
freshman class has sharper
minds, higher Board scores, and
brighter smiles than any other
class in Stanford's history.
This implies, of course, that
the sophomores — last year's
whiz kids — are now second
best at best, and the juniors are
even worse. As for the seniors,
one is surprised that they can
tie their own shoelaces.
The Only Hope
This vast infusion of talent
does not go unnoticed by the
campus Establishment (what
ever that is). In fact, most or

ganizations look upon the incom
ing-freshmen as their only hope.
Upperclassmen, it seems, are
too preoccupied with such meta
physical problems as the nature
of reality and the price of a new
car to bother with student activ
ities.
Freshmen, however, combine
initiative, industry, and inno
cence — the perfect Organiza
tion Men and Women.
Status Relationships
Those students of human so
ciety who believe that sexual at
traction lies at the heart of all
status relationships will find
comfort from the situation here
at Stanford. A primary cause of
freshman status is the attrac
tion between upperclass men
and frosh dollies.
Every upperclassman who
isn't either married or senile be
lieves that somewhere in the
freshman class there exists a
girl who will at last fully appre
ciate his special uniqueness.
And, as the status of fresh
men in general has risen, so has
the number of freshmen men
dating upperclass girls. This,
however, is still an avant-garde
pursuit, a little like reading Tol
kien or smoking pot.
A Godlike Creature
For all the6e reasons, there
fore, the average freshman is
universally looked up to as a
rare blend of the noble savage
and the Uebermensch, a godlike
creature who will singlehanded
ly make Stanford the greatest
educational institution since
Plato's Academy.
But if, in June, Stanford turns
out to be only a little better than
it was in September, one conso
lation remains. There's always
next year.

youth, it is not altogether sur
prising that college campuses
should look up to their most
youthful members. There are,
however, several reasons why
this fad is especially widespread
at Stanford.
Designers and Dropouts
The days are long gone when
Stanford freshmen looked to up
perclassmen for guidance in col
legiate mores and fashions. As
everyone knows, "collegiate"
styles are now set by a select
editors and high school drop
outs. This means that high
schools are, on the average,
twice as collegiate as colleges.
And freshmen — the closest
ones to high school — emerge
as university trend-setters.
Moreover, the admissions of
fice has been assuring us for so
many years that the present
freshman class has sharper
minds, higher Board scores, and
brighter smiles than any other
class in Stanford's history.
This implies, of course, that
the sophomores — last year's
whiz kids — are now second
best at best, and the juniors are
even worse. As for the seniors,
one is surprised that they can
tie their own shoelaces.
The Only Hope
This vast infusion of talent
does not go unnoticed by the
campus Establishment (what
ever that is). In fact, most or

ganizations look upon the incom
ing-freshmen as their only hope.
Upperclassmen, it seems, are
too preoccupied with such meta
physical problems as the nature
of reality and the price of a new
car to bother with student activ
ities.
Freshmen, however, combine
initiative, industry, and inno
cence — the perfect Organiza
tion Men and Women.
Status Relationships
Those students of human so
ciety who believe that sexual at
traction lies at the heart of all
status relationships will find
comfort from the situation here
at Stanford. A primary cause of
freshman status is the attrac
tion between upperclass men
and frosh dollies.
Every upperclassman who
isn't either married or senile be
lieves that somewhere in the
freshman class there exists a
girl who will at last fully appre
ciate his special uniqueness.
And, as the status of fresh
men in general has risen, so has
the number of freshmen men
dating upperclass girls. This,
however, is still an avant-garde
pursuit, a little like reading Tol
kien or smoking pot.
A Godlike Creature
For all the6e reasons, there
fore, the average freshman is
universally looked up to as a
rare blend of the noble savage
and the Uebermensch, a godlike
creature who will singlehanded
ly make Stanford the greatest
educational institution since
Plato's Academy.
But if, in June, Stanford turns
out to be only a little better than
it was in September, one conso
lation remains. There's always
next year.
A fad so new that not even
LIFE magazine has heard of it
is sweeping college campuses.
It's called "freshman year."
Upperclass politicians, beauty
queens, athletes, and Phi Betes
are now as out as the Beatles.
The freshman class is the new
in-crowd.
In a nation that worships
youth, it is not altogether sur
prising that college campuses
should look up to their most
youthful members. There are,
however, several reasons why
this fad is especially widespread
at Stanford.
