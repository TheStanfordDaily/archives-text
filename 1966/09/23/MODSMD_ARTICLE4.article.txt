# Frosh Applaud Napier's People-Centered Gospel
## 
### CRAIG LUBBOCK Staff Editor 
B. Davie Napier, Stanford's new
"Dean of the Chapel," drew a stand
ing ovation yesterday following his
welcoming address to the freshmen
in Memorial Auditorium.
Giving his topic as "Personally
Speaking," Napier commented that
his experience in writing sermons
made him search for a text for any
talk and chose the "new gospel" of
the Beatles, "E'leanor Rigby" and "We
All Live in a Yellow Submarine."
He explained his belief that the
first obligation of the church and the
university is to minister to "the lone

ly people," and expressed his interest,
both as an individual and as a rep
resentative of the church and the
university, in restoring whole persons
in an age when people are regarded
as objects to be manipulated, ex
ploited, and fractionalized.
Education and Religion
The problem faced by religion and
education is that in their institution
alized forms they become submerged
in their "yellow submarines" and are
unable to reach sources of frustration
within individuals or in the rest of
society.
Napier finds love, or rather love
lessnese, at the base of our inability

to cope with our frustrations. As far
as the church, "God is love and if love
is lost then God is dead. God is noth
ing else if he is not love."
Reflecting on learning, Napier con
cluded it would be a monstrosity with
out love. He admitted that there is
a certain tension between the student
mind and the administrative mind
but that that tension could be healthy
and constructive. However, he warned
of "unqualified disaster" if the ten
sion were allowed to exist in a love
less environment. Both students and
faculty, he cautioned must not retreat
into a "yellow submarine." All must
retreat from"the image of a closed
man."
Watts Riots
Napier alluded to the Watts riots of
a summer ago as an epitome of "hard
lovelessness" where the church, edu
cation, justice and political govern
ment had all been prostituted. In
short, what happened in Watts to
Napier represents "the total collapse
of the American Dream," stemming
from too many living too long in a
submarine, isolated from lonely
people.
"I think sex is here to stay," stated
the former Yale professor of Old Test
ament studies, but he deplored the
"Psychopathically frenetic" search for
self-gratification that results in the
complete depersonalization of indivi
duals. Drawing from the Apostle
Paul's description of love and its im
portance in I Corinthians 13, the new
dean voiced hope that conflicts be
tween individuals and between stu
dents and administrators as groups
will be met with openness and under
standing.
