# Civ, English Increase Student-Prof Contacts
## 
### 
Continuing the trend toward a more
personalized freshman year, both the
English and History Depts. have re
vised their freshman programs to in
crease still further contacts between
faculty and students.
English sections will meet only one
hour a week in regular class sessions,
breaking into seminar discussion
groups for the rest of (he week. The
program was instituted on an experi
mental basis last spring and met con
considerable enthusiasm from the stu
dents.
"The move today is out of the class
room," Albert Guerard, program di
rector, notes, "students want to be in
a lounge, in a faculty home, around
a seminar table, anywhere but the
classroom."
All To Study Berkeley
As a "stimulating introduction to
the university," all English sections
will read Beyond Berkeley, a series
of essays on the modern university
written in the light of the Berkeley
crisis. Many freshmen sponsors also
plan to conduct discussion groups on
the essays.
Students will also be allowed much
greater flexibility in choosing course
material Spring Quarter.
In consultation with students, seven
or eight general topics will be selected
and each topic taught in five to eight
sections. Students may choose the
topic which most interests them.
Many of the topics will be cross-dis
ciplinary including possibly, "Politics
in the Novel." "The Literature of
Social Protest" and "Philosophical Is
sues in Drama and Poetry."
Boys And Girls Together
To help make "living a part of learn
ing" freshmen have been assigned to
History and English classes by house
unit this year. Each men's house will
be combined with a wing in a women's
residence and eight to ten sections of
Civ and English will be designated
for each group.
' Says David Savage, a director of the
History program: "A generation ago
the emphasis was on class spirit. Now
the class is too large a unit, and we

have to look toward the smaller living
group.
"What we're really after," Savage
concludes, "is the ideal of one-to-one
student-faculty contact."
Last year, half the freshman class
was assigned to sections by house or
corridor. A questionnaire passed out
at the end of the year showed a ma
jority of the students favored the
program.
Reasons for liking the program in
cluded "opportunity for discussion
outside class," "it made class more in
formal and facilitated discussion,"
and"it developed group spirit."
Flexibility in grading is another
development this year with the
option to "defer" grades in En
glish and Civ until spring.
Some 390 students elected for
deferred grades in English. In
addition, the 100 students par
ticipating in the English De
partment's "Voice" program will
automatically have their grades
deferred.
The very popular freshman
Seminar Program will be con
tinued in an expanded form this
fall. Forty-seven seminars,
taught by professors from 25 de
partments will be offered to
about 220 students. The stu
dents were chosen at random
from some 560 applicants, Mrs.
Alfred Appel, program director,
reported.
The program also has funds
available to sponsor new publi
cations of merit, Mrs. Appel
said, and will again sponsor a
contest designed to promote cre
ative endeavors in a number of
fields including, literature,
music, art, engineering, and
mathematics.

To help make "living a part of learn
ing" freshmen have been assigned to
History and English classes by house
unit this year. Each men's house will
be combined with a wing in a women's
residence and eight to ten sections of
Civ and English will be designated
for each group.
' Says David Savage, a director of the
History program: "A generation ago
the emphasis was on class spirit. Now
the class is too large a unit, and we

have to look toward the smaller living
group.
"What we're really after," Savage
concludes, "is the ideal of one-to-one
student-faculty contact."
Last year, half the freshman class
was assigned to sections by house or
corridor. A questionnaire passed out
at the end of the year showed a ma
jority of the students favored the
program.
Reasons for liking the program in
cluded "opportunity for discussion
outside class," "it made class more in
formal and facilitated discussion,"
and"it developed group spirit."
Flexibility in grading is another
development this year with the
option to "defer" grades in En
glish and Civ until spring.
Some 390 students elected for
deferred grades in English. In
addition, the 100 students par
ticipating in the English De
partment's "Voice" program will
automatically have their grades
deferred.
The very popular freshman
Seminar Program will be con
tinued in an expanded form this
fall. Forty-seven seminars,
taught by professors from 25 de
partments will be offered to
about 220 students. The stu
dents were chosen at random
from some 560 applicants, Mrs.
Alfred Appel, program director,
reported.
The program also has funds
available to sponsor new publi
cations of merit, Mrs. Appel
said, and will again sponsor a
contest designed to promote cre
ative endeavors in a number of
fields including, literature,
music, art, engineering, and
mathematics.
Continuing the trend toward a more
personalized freshman year, both the
English and History Depts. have re
vised their freshman programs to in
crease still further contacts between
faculty and students.
English sections will meet only one
hour a week in regular class sessions,
breaking into seminar discussion
groups for the rest of (he week. The
program was instituted on an experi
mental basis last spring and met con
considerable enthusiasm from the stu
dents.
"The move today is out of the class
room," Albert Guerard, program di
rector, notes, "students want to be in
a lounge, in a faculty home, around
a seminar table, anywhere but the
classroom."
All To Study Berkeley
As a "stimulating introduction to
the university," all English sections
will read Beyond Berkeley, a series
of essays on the modern university
written in the light of the Berkeley
crisis. Many freshmen sponsors also
plan to conduct discussion groups on
the essays.
Students will also be allowed much
greater flexibility in choosing course
material Spring Quarter.
In consultation with students, seven
or eight general topics will be selected
and each topic taught in five to eight
sections. Students may choose the
topic which most interests them.
Many of the topics will be cross-dis
ciplinary including possibly, "Politics
in the Novel." "The Literature of
Social Protest" and "Philosophical Is
sues in Drama and Poetry."
