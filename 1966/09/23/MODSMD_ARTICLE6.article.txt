# Dorms 'Confusing Conglomerate'
## 
### CHRIS HARTE Associate Editor 
Freshman residences at Stanford
are a confusing conglomerate of seg
regation and integration.
Almost ninety per cent of the class
lives in all-freshman housing, but the
other ten per cent lives as a minority
in a primarily upperclass residence,
Stern.
Eighty per cent of the class, the
1100 men and women in Branner,
Stern and Wilbur, live close together
to the East of the campus, far from
the activity centered at the Quad,
White Plaza and the Union.
Roble, where the other 250 fresh
men live, is less isolated from upper
classmen but across campus from
the center of freshman activity.
Tutor Program
And in all four residences, upper
classmen, graduates and teachers are
imported in an attempt to integrate
the freshmen into the University.
They come in all forms, from the tu
tors and sponsors who live with the
freshmen to the faculty associates
who eat a meal in the house about
once a week.
Tutors, new this year, are advanced

graduate students in disciplines rang
ing from English to Physics. There
are a total of twelve in Wilbur, Bran
ner and Roble, or about one for every
eighty students.
The program is expected to add a
third perspective to those already
present in the sponsors and faculty
residents. Some of the tutors have
indicated they will do informal or
formal teaching, but there are no as
signed duties for the twelve.
There are almost fifty sponsors in
the three all-freshman halls, most of
them seniors. They have been de
scribed by Joseph R. Higgins, Direc
tor of Wilbur, as "committed, con
cerned, and exceptionally talented
persons who will be catalysts or stim
ulants to the freshmen."
Higgins considers his own position
will place him in the roles of coun
selor and resource person. He will
eat as many meals as possible in the
various houses in Wilbur and will
host freshmen for informal gather
ings in his apartment above the Wil
bur office.
Higgins, who was program director
in Wilbur last year, replaces Dr. Eric
Hutchinson, who resigned soon after

spring quarter ended following a year
of constant controversy.
Over the summer there was exten
sive renovation of the houses in Wil
bur, including carpeting and sound
paned lobbies. This was an attempt
to improve an architectural style that
Dean Bob Gordon calls "academic San
Quentin."
The change, it is hoped, will im
prove the atmosphere of Wilbur and
make it more conducive to study. But
Mr. Higgins warns that more than
this is necessary.
He hopes that a "tone of responsi
bility" will be established, admonish
ing that "this has to come largely
through the houses and from the in
dividuals in them, and is not some
thing that can be administrated or
legislated."
Faculty Residents
The faculty residents in Wilbur are
the only direct faculty contact in any
of the freshman residences.
"We are simply faculty people liv
ing in close proximity to the fresh
hen," according to Norman Fiering,
a Western Civ instructor in his sec
ond year as Junipero faculty resi
dent.

Among the many roles a faculty
resident will play are advisor and
counselor, teacher, friend, and men
tor.
Each faculty resident has an enter
tainment and counseling fund, to use
as he sees fit for these purposes.
Typical uses include taking students
to theater or concerts and inviting
students into their homes for good
food.
Stern Hall
Stern Hall houses the 160 freshman
men who cannot fit into Wilbur. They
live in all eight Stern houses, with a
freshman coordinator in each house.
Miss Patricia Preuss is the new Di
rector of Roble, replacing Miss Sally
Mahoney. Miss Mahoney is now an
Assistant Dean of Students ( and one
of her principal duties will be coor
dinating various freshman activities
in the three residences.
Plans call for Biweekly meetings
for the directors and head sponsors
of the three freshman residences, plus
the director of and head coordinator
for Stern.
Miss Cora Lee Mack is starting her
second year as Director of Branner.

Stern Hall houses the 160 freshman
men who cannot fit into Wilbur. They
live in all eight Stern houses, with a
freshman coordinator in each house.
Miss Patricia Preuss is the new Di
rector of Roble, replacing Miss Sally
Mahoney. Miss Mahoney is now an
Assistant Dean of Students ( and one
of her principal duties will be coor
dinating various freshman activities
in the three residences.
Plans call for Biweekly meetings
for the directors and head sponsors
of the three freshman residences, plus
the director of and head coordinator
for Stern.
Miss Cora Lee Mack is starting her
second year as Director of Branner.
Freshman residences at Stanford
are a confusing conglomerate of seg
regation and integration.
Almost ninety per cent of the class
lives in all-freshman housing, but the
other ten per cent lives as a minority
in a primarily upperclass residence,
Stern.
Eighty per cent of the class, the
1100 men and women in Branner,
Stern and Wilbur, live close together
to the East of the campus, far from
the activity centered at the Quad,
White Plaza and the Union.
Roble, where the other 250 fresh
men live, is less isolated from upper
classmen but across campus from
the center of freshman activity.
Tutor Program
And in all four residences, upper
classmen, graduates and teachers are
imported in an attempt to integrate
the freshmen into the University.
They come in all forms, from the tu
tors and sponsors who live with the
freshmen to the faculty associates
who eat a meal in the house about
once a week.
Tutors, new this year, are advanced

graduate students in disciplines rang
ing from English to Physics. There
are a total of twelve in Wilbur, Bran
ner and Roble, or about one for every
eighty students.
The program is expected to add a
third perspective to those already
present in the sponsors and faculty
residents. Some of the tutors have
indicated they will do informal or
formal teaching, but there are no as
signed duties for the twelve.
There are almost fifty sponsors in
the three all-freshman halls, most of
them seniors. They have been de
scribed by Joseph R. Higgins, Direc
tor of Wilbur, as "committed, con
cerned, and exceptionally talented
persons who will be catalysts or stim
ulants to the freshmen."
Higgins considers his own position
will place him in the roles of coun
selor and resource person. He will
eat as many meals as possible in the
various houses in Wilbur and will
host freshmen for informal gather
ings in his apartment above the Wil
bur office.
Higgins, who was program director
in Wilbur last year, replaces Dr. Eric
Hutchinson, who resigned soon after

spring quarter ended following a year
of constant controversy.
Over the summer there was exten
sive renovation of the houses in Wil
bur, including carpeting and sound
paned lobbies. This was an attempt
to improve an architectural style that
Dean Bob Gordon calls "academic San
Quentin."
The change, it is hoped, will im
prove the atmosphere of Wilbur and
make it more conducive to study. But
Mr. Higgins warns that more than
this is necessary.
He hopes that a "tone of responsi
bility" will be established, admonish
ing that "this has to come largely
through the houses and from the in
dividuals in them, and is not some
thing that can be administrated or
legislated."
Faculty Residents
The faculty residents in Wilbur are
the only direct faculty contact in any
of the freshman residences.
"We are simply faculty people liv
ing in close proximity to the fresh
hen," according to Norman Fiering,
a Western Civ instructor in his sec
ond year as Junipero faculty resi
dent.

Among the many roles a faculty
resident will play are advisor and
counselor, teacher, friend, and men
tor.
Each faculty resident has an enter
tainment and counseling fund, to use
as he sees fit for these purposes.
Typical uses include taking students
to theater or concerts and inviting
students into their homes for good
food.
