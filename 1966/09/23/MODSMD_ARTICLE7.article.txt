# Real Education From People, Not University, Harris Says
## 
### 
Student Body President David Har
ris Thursday urged Stanford fresh
men to "build a university for people,
instead of people for a university."
Addressing nearly 1300 entering
students in Memorial Auditorium,
Harris said: "You've all been taught
that education is something that
someone does for you, that teachers
educate.

"A better way of understanding it
is that education is something that
takes place in your own mind, and
things outside of that serve only as
stimuli."

"What this means is that the uni
versity exists around students, that
without students there is no univers
ity. . . .
"Universities must see themselves
as large apparatuses which are large
ly sideshows to education. Real educa
tion is taking place among students.
"The university," he continued, "be
longs to students. Anyone who main
tains a hold on this university must
justify his position in the face of
students.
"Anyone from the lowest teaching
assistant to the president . . . has to
be able to stand up to students and
explain what he's doing, how he's do
ing it, and how this affects education
Harris' Yardstick
"This is the yardstick that any uni
versity must be run by, but very few
universites are," he said.
"You're not going to find yourselves
structures which have all told you
up to this point that you don't have
the right to inflict yourself upon that
structure, that the structure exists
above and beyond you. I'm saying
that's not true.
"This is your university. If there is
anyone who has the right to speak
out in this university, that has the
right to examine this university, it's
the student."
Independence
Harris criticized Stanford for "in
culcating dependence" among stu
dents. "The University is asking you
to be dependent upon it. I'm saying
that education is fundamentally based
on independence.
"You're not going to find yourself
free until you find yourselves in a
position where you can stand up to

the University and tell it to chuck
itself into the lake.
"None of you is going to start be
ing educated until you're in a position
where you could just as easily drop
out of this university."
Personal Beliefs
Students should not view them
selves simply as critics, he added, but
should act out of affirmation for
their personal beliefs.
"All of us here have a magnificent
opportunity—and it's not just an op
portunity—and its not just an oppor
tunity for some kind of political ac
tion, it's much, much more than that,"
he declared. "You have a decision
about how you want to live your
lives."
A senior history major from Fres
no, Harris said he would not ask stu
dents to become involved in the uni
versity "on any other grounds than
what it can do for you."
Get Involved
"By involving yourselves, you're
going to find better lives, you're going
to find a way of realizing your dreams
you've all had, those things that you
want for yourself."
James Selna, editor of The Stanford
Daily, told t+ie freshmen a key char
acteristic of students today is the de

sire to "participate in education, in
the formulation of educational policy,
not just in the classroom, but in per
sonal life as well."
In both academic and personal
areas, he said "Stanford has made a
beginning." The University faculty
and administration has shown "signs
of receptiveness" to well formulated
jstudent suggestions in curriculum
and housing, for example.
Faith and Respect
"The compact which governs our
conduct (the Fundamental Standard)
is far freer than any other society I
know of today," Selna said. "It places
great respect and faith in the indi
vidual student."
The fact that "today's student asks
to live his own life does not mean he
«ants tb live in depravity," he added.
' Choice can be a very healthy process.
Students are capable of acting re
sponsibly."
He said it was a "misconstruction"
for outsiders "to view the student
body as a political force pitted in a
tripartite battle with the faculty and
administration."
Freedom and Opportunity
Selna said "we have an excellent
faculty, and we enjoy (a major) op
portunity for self-education." The
principal challenge to students is how
to use their personal freedom and
academic opportunities as well.
Dean of Students H. Donald Win
bigler said "everyone who comes has
the intellectual capacity to succeed
at Stanford.
"No one needs to fail—and few
will," he added.
In a series of questions, Dean Win
bigler urged students to think about
the personal values and standard of
conduct they wished to set and follow
for the next four years.
"Next week you'll feel you own the
place," he concluded. "You'll want to
reform it. And that's as it should be."

culcating dependence" among stu
dents. "The University is asking you
to be dependent upon it. I'm saying
that education is fundamentally based
on independence.
"You're not going to find yourself
free until you find yourselves in a
position where you can stand up to

the University and tell it to chuck
itself into the lake.
"None of you is going to start be
ing educated until you're in a position
where you could just as easily drop
out of this university."
Personal Beliefs
Students should not view them
selves simply as critics, he added, but
should act out of affirmation for
their personal beliefs.
"All of us here have a magnificent
opportunity—and it's not just an op
portunity—and its not just an oppor
tunity for some kind of political ac
tion, it's much, much more than that,"
he declared. "You have a decision
about how you want to live your
lives."
A senior history major from Fres
no, Harris said he would not ask stu
dents to become involved in the uni
versity "on any other grounds than
what it can do for you."
Get Involved
"By involving yourselves, you're
going to find better lives, you're going
to find a way of realizing your dreams
you've all had, those things that you
want for yourself."
James Selna, editor of The Stanford
Daily, told t+ie freshmen a key char
acteristic of students today is the de

sire to "participate in education, in
the formulation of educational policy,
not just in the classroom, but in per
sonal life as well."
In both academic and personal
areas, he said "Stanford has made a
beginning." The University faculty
and administration has shown "signs
of receptiveness" to well formulated
jstudent suggestions in curriculum
and housing, for example.
Faith and Respect
"The compact which governs our
conduct (the Fundamental Standard)
is far freer than any other society I
know of today," Selna said. "It places
great respect and faith in the indi
vidual student."
The fact that "today's student asks
to live his own life does not mean he
«ants tb live in depravity," he added.
' Choice can be a very healthy process.
Students are capable of acting re
sponsibly."
He said it was a "misconstruction"
for outsiders "to view the student
body as a political force pitted in a
tripartite battle with the faculty and
administration."
Freedom and Opportunity
Selna said "we have an excellent
faculty, and we enjoy (a major) op
portunity for self-education." The
principal challenge to students is how
to use their personal freedom and
academic opportunities as well.
Dean of Students H. Donald Win
bigler said "everyone who comes has
the intellectual capacity to succeed
at Stanford.
"No one needs to fail—and few
will," he added.
In a series of questions, Dean Win
bigler urged students to think about
the personal values and standard of
conduct they wished to set and follow
for the next four years.
"Next week you'll feel you own the
place," he concluded. "You'll want to
reform it. And that's as it should be."


DAVE HARRIS
Student Body President David Har
ris Thursday urged Stanford fresh
men to "build a university for people,
instead of people for a university."
Addressing nearly 1300 entering
students in Memorial Auditorium,
Harris said: "You've all been taught
that education is something that
someone does for you, that teachers
educate.

"A better way of understanding it
is that education is something that
takes place in your own mind, and
things outside of that serve only as
stimuli."
Students Control
"What this means is that the uni
versity exists around students, that
without students there is no univers
ity. . . .
"Universities must see themselves
as large apparatuses which are large
ly sideshows to education. Real educa
tion is taking place among students.
"The university," he continued, "be
longs to students. Anyone who main
tains a hold on this university must
justify his position in the face of
students.
"Anyone from the lowest teaching
assistant to the president . . . has to
be able to stand up to students and
explain what he's doing, how he's do
ing it, and how this affects education
Harris' Yardstick
"This is the yardstick that any uni
versity must be run by, but very few
universites are," he said.
"You're not going to find yourselves

structure, that the structure exists
above and beyond you. I'm saying
that's not true.

and housing, for example.
Faith and Respect
"The compact which governs our
conduct (the Fundamental Standard)
is far freer than any other society I
know of today," Selna said. "It places
great respect and faith in the indi
vidual student."
The fact that "today's student asks
to live his own life does not mean he
«ants tb live in depravity," he added.
' Choice can be a very healthy process.
Students are capable of acting re
sponsibly."
He said it was a "misconstruction"
for outsiders "to view the student
body as a political force pitted in a
tripartite battle with the faculty and
administration."
Freedom and Opportunity
Selna said "we have an excellent
faculty, and we enjoy (a major) op
portunity for self-education." The
principal challenge to students is how
to use their personal freedom and
academic opportunities as well.
Dean of Students H. Donald Win
bigler said "everyone who comes has
the intellectual capacity to succeed
at Stanford.
"No one needs to fail—and few
will," he added.
In a series of questions, Dean Win
bigler urged students to think about
the personal values and standard of
conduct they wished to set and follow
for the next four years.
"Next week you'll feel you own the
place," he concluded. "You'll want to
reform it. And that's as it should be."


DAVE HARRIS
Student Body President David Har
ris Thursday urged Stanford fresh
men to "build a university for people,
instead of people for a university."
Addressing nearly 1300 entering
students in Memorial Auditorium,
Harris said: "You've all been taught
that education is something that
someone does for you, that teachers
educate.

"A better way of understanding it
is that education is something that
takes place in your own mind, and
things outside of that serve only as
stimuli."
Students Control
"What this means is that the uni
versity exists around students, that
without students there is no univers
ity. . . .
"Universities must see themselves
as large apparatuses which are large
ly sideshows to education. Real educa
tion is taking place among students.
"The university," he continued, "be
longs to students. Anyone who main
tains a hold on this university must
justify his position in the face of
students.
"Anyone from the lowest teaching
assistant to the president . . . has to
be able to stand up to students and
explain what he's doing, how he's do
ing it, and how this affects education
Harris' Yardstick
"This is the yardstick that any uni
versity must be run by, but very few
universites are," he said.
"You're not going to find yourselves
structures which have all told you
up to this point that you don't have
the right to inflict yourself upon that
structure, that the structure exists
above and beyond you. I'm saying
that's not true.
"This is your university. If there is
anyone who has the right to speak
out in this university, that has the
right to examine this university, it's
the student."
Independence
Harris criticized Stanford for "in
culcating dependence" among stu
dents. "The University is asking you
to be dependent upon it. I'm saying
that education is fundamentally based
on independence.
"You're not going to find yourself
free until you find yourselves in a
position where you can stand up to

the University and tell it to chuck
itself into the lake.
"None of you is going to start be
ing educated until you're in a position
where you could just as easily drop
out of this university."
Personal Beliefs
Students should not view them
selves simply as critics, he added, but
should act out of affirmation for
their personal beliefs.
"All of us here have a magnificent
opportunity—and it's not just an op
portunity—and its not just an oppor
tunity for some kind of political ac
tion, it's much, much more than that,"
he declared. "You have a decision
about how you want to live your
lives."
A senior history major from Fres
no, Harris said he would not ask stu
dents to become involved in the uni
versity "on any other grounds than
what it can do for you."
Get Involved
"By involving yourselves, you're
going to find better lives, you're going
to find a way of realizing your dreams
you've all had, those things that you
want for yourself."
James Selna, editor of The Stanford
Daily, told t+ie freshmen a key char
acteristic of students today is the de

sire to "participate in education, in
the formulation of educational policy,
not just in the classroom, but in per
sonal life as well."
In both academic and personal
areas, he said "Stanford has made a
beginning." The University faculty
and administration has shown "signs
of receptiveness" to well formulated
jstudent suggestions in curriculum
and housing, for example.
