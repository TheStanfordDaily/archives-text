# Sterling Cites Pressures

### HENRY MULLER News Editor 
In Wednesday's address to the Class
of '70, President Wallace Sterling
spoke to the freshman class and en
couraged students to heed to the law,
"the most effective and important in
strument of social reform," in order
to achieve the changes they seek.
Speaking at the University's annual
freshman convocation, Sterling em

phasized that "ardor and impulse are
not viable substitutes for analysis and
judgment."
He said that "the greatest crimes
against men have been committed by
men who cared not what means they
employed to achieve their ends."
Sterling pointed out to the fresh
men that they should think seriously
about the alternative between simply
violating laws they do not approve of

and "participating deliberatively in
the democratic proccss to bring about
change."
Obligation
Sterling said that students have an
obligation and an indebtedness to pre
sent institutions. "You cannot by some
selfish whim or some impulsive act or
some indulgent egotism bring disre
pute on your family or your univer
sity, and do so with impunity," he
added. "You will do injury to some
one, possibly to yourself."
Sterling predicted that we were en
tering an era which will be marked by
"strong, even bitter, advocacy of so
cial change." He warned that none of
the problems like Vietnam, civil
rights, or slums will be easily solved.'
Despite his continued insistence
that the ends of social protest can
never be independent of means, he
emphasized that criticism and protest
are "vital to society."
Increasing Pressures
Sterling observed that students are
continually subject to increasing pres
sures. The principal of these is the
pressure to enter college and later to
do graduate work, he said.
"On top of these academic pres
sures, there are additional ones â€”
there is the possibility of military ser
vice for young men; there is the urg
ing to participate in aid to the under
privileged; and there is the psycho
logical pressure of beginning your
adult life under the threat of nuclear
war."
Sterling said that this was not a
new phenomenon. "Pressures . . .
may change in character and dimen
sion, but not in fact. Others have cop
ed with pressure and so will you."
He concluded by discouraging stu
dents from indulging in self-pity be
cause of these pressures. "It will
bring you little, if any, relief and no
benefit," he said.
