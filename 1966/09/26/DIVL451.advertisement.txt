While he was writing it, John Barth described his new
novel, Giles Goat-Boy as "a longish story about a
young man who is raised as a goat, later learns he's
human and commits himself to the heroic project of
discovering the secret of things."
When Giles Goat-Boy was published last month, the
critics displayed none of Barth's restraint. Giles
Goat-Boy has become one of the most celebrated liter
ary events of the new publishing season, and John
Barth has l>een variously described as:
"//if most prodigally gifted comic novelist writing in
English today . . . Who else but Barth would dare create a hero
who was sired by a computer out of a virgin ? . . .
"No summary, no excerpting can possibly convey the fantastic
richness of the novel, its profligate bounty. Barth could have cut
it by a third (though one would hate to see a line of it go) and
made the reputation of a dozen novelists by distributing the
pieces among them." —Newsweek Magazine
"clearly a genius ...
"What is one to do about John Barth? Is he - as so many people
interested in original, funny, creative, and brilliant writing
agree h is — the most original, funny, creative, and brilliant
writer working in the English language today? Or merely, as
these same people hasten to add, the most impertinent and long
winded? Is Giles Goat-Boy the great American novel, come at
last into being, or just a long, though expert, shaggy-goat story ?
And if so — or indeed, if not so, or both - whose beard is being
pulled? Mr. Barth is clearly a genius . . . but what does that
mean? Intoxicated by Giles Goat-Boy, I would suggest it ap
plies to someone who by force of will and wild connections in the
mind, intoxicates ...
"What is one to do about John Barth? Well, first of all, partake,
eat, quaff, enjoy. Whatever the doubts and recriminations, they
will keep till morning; I'm not sure they matter in the slightest."
—ELIOT fremont-smith, New York Times
"like Mephistopheles — or perhaps Hatman.
"(Giles Goat-Boy is) a gothic fun-house fantasy of theology,
sociology, and sex, leaping across great tracts of human history
. . . Prodigious . . . Reading Giles Goat-Boy, and debating its
meaning, will be one of the most bracing literary exercises of
1966 and beyond. It is a satire of major import."-Time Magazine
"a rarity among American novelists i n having a bril
liant mind ... a mind that invents ideas only to flout them . . .
"With this fourth novel, John Barth at 36 increases the likeli
hood that the years since World War II are among the most
rewarding in the history of American fiction."—richard poirier,
Washington I'ost Book Week
"the best writer of fiction we have at present a nd one
of the best we have ever had . ..
"His audience must be that same audience whose capacities have
been extended and prepared by Joyce, Proust, Mann and Faulkner.
"For some time we have been wondering what to do with the
training given us by those giants of modern fiction . . . The
answer now seems clear. The difference between competence and
genius can hardly be made clearer. And Barth is a comic genius
of the highest order." —ROBERT scholes,
front page New York Times Book Review
