# Higgins Replaces Hutchinson As Wilbur Director
## 
### CHRIS HARTE Associate Editor 
A new director, significant physical
improvements, and a program of
graduate student tutors mark the
changes over the summer in Stan
ford's largest and most controversial
residence, Wilbur Hall.
Joseph R. Higgins, a faculty resi
dent for two years and program di
rector last year, became director of
Wilbur in mid-June when Dr. Eric
Hutchinson, faculty master last year,
resigned. Higgins becomes the third

man in as many years to hold the top
post in Wilbur.
Higgins will have no responsibilities
other than his Wilbur position.
He plans to work toward eliminat
ing two of the most common criti
cisms of Wilbur last year, that there
was too much concern for Wilbur as a
segregated living unit and that its at
mosphere was not conducive to study
or thought.
He believes the installation of rugs
and soundproofing in the halls and
lobbies of the houses will help greatly
in keeping the noise down, but warns
that "a tone of responsibility" must
be set by the residents of each house.
Tutors
Higgins sees the tutor program as
adding a third perspective, that of
the advanced graduate student, to the
two with which the freshman is al
ready placed in contact through spon
sors and faculty residents.
The eight tutors, one in each house,
have no assigned duties, though sev
eral have indicated they will do some
teaching in the houses.
When the idea for the tutor pro
gram was first proposed it met signi
ficant student oppostiion because it
was felt that the tutors would be no
more than Resident Assistants with
glorified names. Thus far, however,
there has been no attempt to assign
the tutors any of the chores which
RA's perform.
While the tr.tors and sponsors are
generally enthusiastic about the new
program, several expressed some
doubt. They feared that the program
would be seen as an answer to the
problems of Wilbur and freshman
residence rather than simply a small
step in the direction of those answers.
Faculty Master System
The personnel change leaves some
question about the future of the facul
ty master concept at Stanford. Ac
cording to informed sources, Dr.
Hutchinson was to have held the po
sition for four or five years as a trial
of the system, which then was to
have been instituted in the new Moore
and Jacks residences and possibly
other residences.
Most observers agree that the fail
ure to achieve a more educational cli
mate in Wilbur last year was due not
to the faculty master system so much
as to the conflict between the faculty
master and a large segment of the
Wilbur population, particularly the
sponsors.
There is no presently hint of any
conflict resembling last year's, which
was already well-formed by this time.
