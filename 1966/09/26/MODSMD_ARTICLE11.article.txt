# Undergraduate Library Opening Postponed Until Early November
## 
### PAT McMAHON 
The new Undergraduate Library
opening scheduled for September, will
be delayed until early November, said
Warren B. Kuhn, director of the li
brary, as rising economy and the war
in Vietnam have prevented manufac
turers from filling the library's re
quests for furnishings:
However, noted the new director,
the seminar rooms and the language
labs are nearly ready for ull time use
this quarter. Two of the seminar
rooms will be open for late evening
study from 7:00 p.m. until 2:30 a.m.

The new library, Kuhn pointed out,
has several highlights, some new to
Stanford libraries. Among these fea
tures, he listed:
• Air-conditioning. The cooled air
in the new library is piped into the
rooms through narrow slits in the
ceiling to avoid excessive noise and
cold drafts.
• A new audio library. A listening
room with over 50 booths will be pro
vided on the main floor with a large
library of music and the spoken
word. Hopefully, it will be ready by
February, 1967.

• Four outdoor study decks. On the
fourth floor are four decks, which
will have furniture similar to the out
door furniture at Tresidder.
• A book catalogue, replacing a
card catalogue. Every book will be
recorded on IBM cards, which will be
catalogued into a book both by author
and by title. There will be at least
four of these books on each floor of
the library, and 50 copies available on
campus, in total.
• A snack lounge. Vending ma
chines and lounge furniture will pro
vide a smoking and eating area near
the main vestibule on the first floor.
• Six full time reference librarians.
Four reference areas located near the
four corners of each floor will have
book catalogues, other reference ma
terials, and a house phone direct to
the reference librarian on the second
floor.
• Series of pamphlets explaining
how to get the most out of reference
materials. The booklets will deal more
with what books are appropriate for
what uses than how these books are
used.
• Reserve book desk. Reserve
books at the Civ library will be moved
to the reserve desk on the second
floor. The two-hour books will be at
the desk and the one-day and one
\yeek books will be on the shelves.
• More seating, carrels. 1500 seats
will be scattered throughout the li
brary in interesting and stylish ar
rangements. On the edge of each sec
tion will be carrels for the use of all
students. Also, on each floor will be
glassed-in rooms with carrels that can
be checked out to individuals for two
week periods. These carrels have a
locked cabinet beside them for stu
dents to store books they have
checked out, and can be used for typ
ing.
Director Kuhn also noted that the
library is always open to change that
would facilitate the student's best
usage of library materials.

will be scattered throughout the li
brary in interesting and stylish ar
rangements. On the edge of each sec
tion will be carrels for the use of all
students. Also, on each floor will be
glassed-in rooms with carrels that can
be checked out to individuals for two
week periods. These carrels have a
locked cabinet beside them for stu
dents to store books they have
checked out, and can be used for typ
ing.
Director Kuhn also noted that the
library is always open to change that
would facilitate the student's best
usage of library materials.
The new Undergraduate Library
opening scheduled for September, will
be delayed until early November, said
Warren B. Kuhn, director of the li
brary, as rising economy and the war
in Vietnam have prevented manufac
turers from filling the library's re
quests for furnishings:
However, noted the new director,
the seminar rooms and the language
labs are nearly ready for ull time use
this quarter. Two of the seminar
rooms will be open for late evening
study from 7:00 p.m. until 2:30 a.m.

The new library, Kuhn pointed out,
has several highlights, some new to
Stanford libraries. Among these fea
tures, he listed:
• Air-conditioning. The cooled air
in the new library is piped into the
rooms through narrow slits in the
ceiling to avoid excessive noise and
cold drafts.
• A new audio library. A listening
room with over 50 booths will be pro
vided on the main floor with a large
library of music and the spoken
word. Hopefully, it will be ready by
February, 1967.

• Four outdoor study decks. On the
fourth floor are four decks, which
will have furniture similar to the out
door furniture at Tresidder.
• A book catalogue, replacing a
card catalogue. Every book will be
recorded on IBM cards, which will be
catalogued into a book both by author
and by title. There will be at least
four of these books on each floor of
the library, and 50 copies available on
campus, in total.
• A snack lounge. Vending ma
chines and lounge furniture will pro
vide a smoking and eating area near
the main vestibule on the first floor.
• Six full time reference librarians.
Four reference areas located near the
four corners of each floor will have
book catalogues, other reference ma
terials, and a house phone direct to
the reference librarian on the second
floor.
• Series of pamphlets explaining
how to get the most out of reference
materials. The booklets will deal more
with what books are appropriate for
what uses than how these books are
used.
• Reserve book desk. Reserve
books at the Civ library will be moved
to the reserve desk on the second
floor. The two-hour books will be at
the desk and the one-day and one
\yeek books will be on the shelves.
• More seating, carrels. 1500 seats
will be scattered throughout the li
brary in interesting and stylish ar
rangements. On the edge of each sec
tion will be carrels for the use of all
students. Also, on each floor will be
glassed-in rooms with carrels that can
