# Physics Department Head Abdicates 18-Year Position
## 
### 
To devote more of his time
to teaching and research, Leon
ard I. Schiff, professor of phys
ics, has stepped down from head
of the Physics Department, a
Dost he has held for 18 years.
Professor Arthur Schawlow, co
inventor of the laser, has suc
ceeded him.
Schawlow is best known as
the co-author of the 1958 scien
tific paper which provided the
theoretical blueprints for build
ing the first laser. He has been
at Stanford since 1961 having
previously taught at Columbia
and been a research physicist
with Bell Telephone Laborator
ies.
' During Professor Schiff's 18
year term, the Physics Depart
ment had some of its most pro
ductive years. Three members
of the faculty received Nobel
prizes during this time, and all
but the first of the linear elec
tron accelerators were planned
or built. The department was
recently rated "most distinguish
ed" in a survey taken by the
American Council on Education.
The SrliifT Test
- The "Schiff Test of General
Relativity" an attempt to prove

Einstein's postulates is among
the work that has established
him in theoretical physics spe
cializing in high energy nuclear
processes and gravitation. The
test is an extremely delicate ex
periment involving l/500th-de
gree-per-year precession of a
near perfect, earth-orbiting gyro
scope.
Earlier this year Professor
Schiff received the Oersted Me
dal of the American Association
of Physics Teachers for his
"notable contributions to the
teaching of physics." He also
won the Dinkelspiel Award,
Stanford's highest honor for un
dergraduate teaching.
Schawlow has received nu
merous honors recognizing his
contributions to optical and mi
crowave spectroscopy, nuclear
quadrupole resonance, super
conductivity, and lasers.
Schawlow succeeded Profes
sor Schiff September Ist.
