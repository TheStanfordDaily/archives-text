# Stanford's Cohen Earns World's Top Math Prize
## 
### 
Paul J. Cohen, 32-year old
professor of mathematics, was
awarded the world's top mathe
matics prize - the Fields Medal
at the opening of a 10-day
International Congress of Math
ematicians in Moscow last Au
gust.
The Fields Medal is considered
at least as prestigious as the
Nobel Prize by mathematicians,
who are not eligible for the
latter. A small monetary award
accompanies the medal, which is
presented every four years
when the congress meets.
The award recognizes Prof.
Cohen's highly original work of
1963 which answered a fun
damental question that had puz
zled mathematicians for nearly
half a century. He showed that
the "continuum hypothesis" is
independent of the axioms of set
theory; therefore the hypothesis
can't be proved until new
axioms are formulated.
