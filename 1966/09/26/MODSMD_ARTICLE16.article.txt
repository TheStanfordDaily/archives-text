# LYMAN TELLS FROSH
## Honor Programs Explained 
### DICK LIVINGSTON Asst. Managing Editor 
Richard W. Lyman, professor
of history, told a group of fresh
men interested in honors pro
grams yesterday that they will
have to concentrate on planning
ahead to combine all the special
advantages of a Stanford educa
tion.
â€¢ Speaking to 100 students in
Tresidder, Lyman said honors
program are designed for people
t with extra motivation. "We
hope they will keep the under
graduate from getting lost in the
shuffle," he added.
Honors programs should add
flexibility and intensity to a stu
dent's program in a variety of
ways, Lyman said.
Lyman indicated most Stan

ford honors programs have two
things in common: stress on
small group discussions and in
dividual attention. "They should
give the student a more per
sonal connection with the busi
ness of scholarship," he ex
plained.
Lyman warned that advance
planning is a necessity in get
ting into many of the programs
and suggested looking into hon
ors programs early.
The professor outlined the
basics of three types of honors
programs: departmental honors,
inter-disciplinary programs and
honors sections in individual
programs.
Super Civ
Commenting on special civ, or
"super civ" as the freshmen are

foi.d of calling it, Lyman said
course content often depends a
great deal on the individual in
structor. He told the students to
watch for special sections in all
their courses.
Lyman said there has been a
strong trend toward departmen
tal honors programs during the
last few years. Stanford pro
grams vary in duration, struc
ture and application dates, he
said.
Interdisciplinary programs are
often the best developed and
most interesting, Lyman said.
He explained the basics of these
programs by using' the behav
ioral sciences, humanities and
social thought programs and in
stitutions as examples.
Application
The Behavioral Sciences pro
gram allows the student to ap
ply the tools of the discipline to
his other classes, Lyman ex
plained.
The Humanities set up is de
signed to synthesize work in sev
eral areas, he said.
Lyman concluded by calling
on the members of the Class of
'70 to be on the look out for pro
grams that will allow them to
get more out of their education
than just traditional class room
work.
