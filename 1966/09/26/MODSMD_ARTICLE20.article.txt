# That Was The Summer Quarter That Was
## KZSU Threatened By Berkeley Radio KAL 
### 
A dispute involving KZSU,
Stanford's radio station, and
KAL, the Berkeley campus sta
tion, was settled in early Aug
ust.
The debate between the stu
dent stations arose over the uge
of FM frequency 90.1 mega
cycles. To avoid further conflict,
the Berkeley station decided to
switch to a different frequency.
During the summer, KAL ap
plied to the Federal Communica
tions Commission for a FM li
cense on 90.1 megacycles,the fre
quency which KZSU has used
for more than a year. The Berk
eley group maintained that this
channel was the only frequency
available in the Bay Area.
Don Piatt, program director
for KZSU, protested the applica
tion and appealed to Stanford
University officials for support.
He contended that the signals
from the two stations would in
terfere with each other.
R. A. Isberg, a communica
tions engineer from Berkeley,
disagreed: "There will be no de
structive interference with
KZSU." It was felt that the dis
tance between the stations and
the relatively low power of each
would sufficiently preclude such
interference. KZSU operates at
10-watts, and the proposed sta
tion would have had a power of
13-watts.
In a statement to the Summer
Weekly, Piatt explained that the
"skip conditions" on the bay
strengthened the KZSU signal
and increased its coverage area.
He presented technical evidence
to support the theory 'to the Uni
versity Relations Office at Stan
ford.
He also stressed the necessity
of considering the future plans
which the University has for
KZSU. He said, "Recently the
administration had been discus
sing various possibilities and
plans for expansion of our fa
cilities." He seemed to feel that
the interference from KAL
would not allow such improve
ments.

Following this action, Lyle
Nelson, Director of University
Relations, filed an official objec
tion with the FCC. It was neces
sary for the administration to
protest because the Board of
Trustees legally hold the FM
license with the FCC. A protest
of this variety must be made
within ninety days of the appli
cation date, and there were, at
that time, sixty days left.
However, upon receiving the
Stanford objection, KAL with
drew its application. Berkeley
officials have indicated that an
other request for an education
station at 91.1 megacycles on
the FM dial will be made at a
later date.
