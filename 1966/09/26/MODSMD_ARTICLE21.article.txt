# Volunteers Aid Asia Project
## 
### 
Three dozen Stanford student
Kong, Macao, Korea, and Viet
nam this summer to help with
civilian service projects.
The volunteers taught Eng
lish worked with refugee relief
teams, and private "peace
corps" groups and in mountain
clinics. Their trip was under the
auspices of a new non-profit
Stanford based corporation, Vol
unteers in Asia, directed by
Dwight Clark, former dean of
freshmen men at Stanford. It is
an outgrowth of the World Uni
versity Service which has sent
Stanford students to Hong
Kong every summer for the
past three years under the direc
tion of Clark.
