# Tuition Will Jump To $590 Next Fall
## 
### 
The cost of higher education
at Stanford continues to rise,
with tuition scheduled to in
crease to $590 a quArter in the
fall of 1967.
In announcing the increase in
July, President Wallace Sterling
indicated the new figure will
allow the University to continue
to raise faculty and staff
salaries.
Scholarships, loans and jobs
will still be available assuring
that no student is denied an op
portunity to attend Stanford
solely for lack of funds, Sterling
added.
Operating Costs
Tuition will still only cover
about 40 per cent of the Univer
sity's operating costs which now
exceed $3500 per student per
year.
And despite the regular in
creases in tuition, this gap be
tween the cost to the student
and the cost to the University
continues to widen.
In 1952, tuition was $660 per
academic year, approximately
$350 short of actual costs. Ten
years later, the figure was

$1260, but the gap had increased
to $1450.
Cap Widens
Tuition this year is $1575, ap
proximately $2000 short of a
year's expenses at Stanford.
The University expects the
new tuition charge to cover 41
per cent of costs. Of the re
mainder, 27 per cent comes
from gifts, 15 per cent from
endowment, 4 per cent from
land development and 13 per
cent from special funds and
other sources.
Student financial aid has more
than kept pace with increasing
costs since 1950 when $460,000
was available to students. The
figure had jumped Po $5.9 mil
lion in 1964. Four out of ten
freshmen now receive assistance
averaging more than $1200 per
recipient.
Graduate Increase
Tuition for the Graduate
School of Business will increase
from $1710 to $1965 next fall,
while Law School rates go to
$1875.
A University spokesman last
spring indicated graduate stu
dies cost from four to eight

times as much per student as a
year of undergraduate work.
When Stanford opened in
1891, an "incidental fee" of $15
a quarter was charged. The first
tuition fee in 1920 was $40.
Annual Increase
The University's tuition has
been increased seven times since
World War 11, averaging about
5 per cent annually. The rate is
set by the Board of Trustees,
which reviews the tuition every
two years. The present rate took
effect in 1965.
Tuition for the summer quar
ter of 1967 will be increased, but
remains substantially below the
rate for the rest of the academic
year.
Figures released last spring
by the Life Insurance Manage
ment Association show 60 insti
tutions iiave higher tuition than
Stanford's current $1575. Of
1020 colleges and universities,
Hollins College tuition of $2900
tops the list. This figure includes
room and board, however.
The Leaders
Finch College has the highest
combined room-board and tuition
cost at $3630.

A cross section of other tui
tion costs include Sarah Lawr
ence, $2400; Cal Tech, $1800;
Yale, $1800; Princeton, $1770;
Harvard and Radcliffe, $1760;
Reed, $1,700 and NYU, $1,000.
Board and room fees have also
been increased, effective this
quarter. The University now
charges $160 for room and $220
for board each quarter. The
new rates represent an increase
of $20 in each area.
The increased cost of food,
higher staff salaries and recent
remodeling of most living units
all have contributed to the high
er room-board rate.
