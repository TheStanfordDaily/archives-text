# 1966 'Upward Bound' Brought Poverty War To Stanford
## 
### STEVE GRUBER 
The distance between Stan
ford and East Palo Alto is only
three miles as the middle class
flies.
The road is much longer if
you have to fight de facto segre
gation, a poor education, and the
stratification system on the
way.
But the Office of Economic
Opportunity, also known as the
War on Poverty, made the way
easier this summer with project
Upward Bound.
In its second year, Upward

Bound attempted to bring high
school sophomores and juniors
to a higher academic level.
Forty-one high school stu
dents from East Palo Alto and
Menlo Park spent eight weeks
at Stanford last summer. The
girls stayed at the Phi Delt
house; the boys lived at the Sig
ma Alpha Epsilon house.
The program operated on a
$57,000 budget, financed by the
OEO with the cooperation of the
University.
Led by Professor Lawrence
Ryan of the English Depart

ment, the project had 21 staf
fers. Stanford graduate stu
dents, San Mateo College stu
dents, and public school teachers
were included in the total.
Academic work in reading,
mathematics, English, and the
social sciences was offered in the
mornings. Students participated
in a diversified cultural program
at other times during the day.
Optional courses in drama and
the fine arts were also offered.
This year 202 Universities and
colleges sponsored project Up
ward Bound. According to Sar
gent Shriver, director of the
OEO, "I think of this program
as one of the most promising
ways of taking people out of
poverty- and it is a completely
American way of doing it—by
giving young people a chance
to help themselves through edu
cation."
The project centered around
small groups designed to bring
the students into discussions.
Teachers tried to spend as much
time as possible with the stu
dents outside of classroom
hours. Tutors were available for
everyone in every subject.
According to Upward Bound
spokesmen, the eight weeks the
students spent at Stanford will
not be their only contact with
the program. The follow-up pro
gram, in cooperation with the
Ravenswood Tutorial Program,
will arrange weekly meetings
with these students throughout
the year.
Counseling will also be con
tinued. The academic program
will be supplemented by Satur
day activities and occasional eve
ning excursions.
A booklet published by the
OEO states that the program
"seeks to rescue the youngster
whose brains and ability may
be lost to society, or worse yet,
be directed against society, un
less he can be motivated to ap
ply his talents and energies
constructively."
One of the Universities in the
program, Columbia, will accept
only students whose chances for
college without Upward Bound
are zero. Other programs are
geared to those students who do
superior school work but will
not be able to hold their own in
college due to inadequate sec
ondary schooling.
"Our hope is to pick up the
student when his present pat
terns are building up impedi
ments to higher education, help
him remove those impediments,
give him a real appetite for
learning, and perhaps most im
portant of all, a conviction that
he can secure the education he
wants," according to Upward
Bound spokesmen.

whose brains and ability may
be lost to society, or worse yet,
be directed against society, un
less he can be motivated to ap
ply his talents and energies
constructively."
One of the Universities in the
program, Columbia, will accept
only students whose chances for
college without Upward Bound
are zero. Other programs are
geared to those students who do
superior school work but will
not be able to hold their own in
college due to inadequate sec
ondary schooling.
"Our hope is to pick up the
student when his present pat
terns are building up impedi
ments to higher education, help
him remove those impediments,
give him a real appetite for
learning, and perhaps most im
portant of all, a conviction that
he can secure the education he
wants," according to Upward
Bound spokesmen.
The distance between Stan
ford and East Palo Alto is only
three miles as the middle class
flies.
The road is much longer if
you have to fight de facto segre
gation, a poor education, and the
stratification system on the
way.
But the Office of Economic
Opportunity, also known as the
War on Poverty, made the way
easier this summer with project
Upward Bound.
In its second year, Upward

Bound attempted to bring high
school sophomores and juniors
to a higher academic level.
Forty-one high school stu
dents from East Palo Alto and
Menlo Park spent eight weeks
at Stanford last summer. The
girls stayed at the Phi Delt
house; the boys lived at the Sig
ma Alpha Epsilon house.
The program operated on a
$57,000 budget, financed by the
OEO with the cooperation of the
University.
Led by Professor Lawrence
Ryan of the English Depart

ment, the project had 21 staf
fers. Stanford graduate stu
dents, San Mateo College stu
dents, and public school teachers
were included in the total.
Academic work in reading,
mathematics, English, and the
social sciences was offered in the
mornings. Students participated
in a diversified cultural program
at other times during the day.
Optional courses in drama and
the fine arts were also offered.
This year 202 Universities and
colleges sponsored project Up
ward Bound. According to Sar
gent Shriver, director of the
OEO, "I think of this program
as one of the most promising
ways of taking people out of
poverty- and it is a completely
American way of doing it—by
giving young people a chance
to help themselves through edu
cation."
The project centered around
small groups designed to bring
the students into discussions.
Teachers tried to spend as much
time as possible with the stu
dents outside of classroom
hours. Tutors were available for
everyone in every subject.
According to Upward Bound
spokesmen, the eight weeks the
students spent at Stanford will
not be their only contact with
the program. The follow-up pro
gram, in cooperation with the
Ravenswood Tutorial Program,
will arrange weekly meetings
with these students throughout
the year.
Counseling will also be con
tinued. The academic program
will be supplemented by Satur
day activities and occasional eve
ning excursions.
A booklet published by the
OEO states that the program
"seeks to rescue the youngster
whose brains and ability may
be lost to society, or worse yet,
be directed against society, un
less he can be motivated to ap
ply his talents and energies
