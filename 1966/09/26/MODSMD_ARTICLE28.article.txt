# Student Films Banned
## 
### 
In a controversy that lasted
nearly all of summer quarter,
the ASSU art film series was
first banned, then reinstated by
University officials.
The series would have shown
12 different films on six nights
through out the quarter. As
originally planned by the sum
mer Legislature, it included Un
Chant d'Amour, Scorpio Rising
I was a 90 Pound Weakling, and
to L.A. . . . With Lust, among
others.
On June 30, ASSU officials
hung up several posters adver
tising the new series. Within
two hours, they had been de
stroyed by representatives of the
University, who claimed the pos
ters were unsuitable.
The next day, the Committee
on Public Exercises unanimous
ly voted to cancel the film se
ries. It objected to the nature of
the films and posters.
The ASSU was stunned. The
first two films, "Gold Diggers of
1933" and "Flaming Creatures,"
had already been rented at a
cost of approximately $100. As
long as they had paid for the
films, student leaders figured
they had a right to show ihem.
"Gold Diggers of 1933" and
"Flaming Creatures" were
scheduled to be shown at the I-
Center on July 6. The screening
took place next to the ASSU
Coffee House (ASSUCH) which
had just been opened that night.
While "Gold Diggers" was be
ing shown, an anonymous stu-

the most newsworthy summer
quarters in the history of
Stanford University.

dent called Dean Winbigler and
reported that fact to him. Win
bigler immediately phoned the
director of the I-Center and told
him to stop the film.
Winbigler's action did not halt
the showing of "Flaming Crea
tures," however. After the phone
call to the I-Center, student body
president-elect David Harris in
vited the audience to come to a
"newly-created seminar" on por
nography to be held at the ASSU
offices. Professor Bruce Frank
lin "taught" the seminar and
managed to show "Flaming
Creatures" as an example of
pornography.
The Committee on Public
Exercises (CPE) met again
later that week, made another
recommendation on the film se
ries and sent it to President
Sterling. The recommendation
was never made public.
Although the CPE officially
has three student members, no
students were involved in their
decisions. The three student
members of the CPE spring
quarter were unavailable; two
had graduated and the other was
in New York. No students were
invited to join the CPE during
the summer. Three ASSU rep
resentatives spoke to the Com
mittee before the recommenda
tion was sent to Sterling, but all
three were asked to leave before
the vote took place.
On July 8, the six member
summer legislature met and
voted to show two more of the
films in spite of the ban.
"Chumps at Oxford," a Laurel
and Hardy movie, and "Scorpio
Rising," were scheduled to be
shown at the Nitery on July 18.
The legislature's move was cal
culated to recoup some of the
losses on the first movies and
provide a showdown with the
administration.

However, no one in the ASSU
ordered the lilms, hut this was
not announced until a week later
at the next legislature meeting.
After a meeting between Pres
ident Sterling and students Da
vid Harris, Tim Ilaight, Cyril
Sia, and Jeff Lewin on July 15,
the legislature passed a new
resolution. In it, the film series
was canceled, pending action by
Sterling on the recommendation
of the Committee on Public Ex
ercises.
Then four outside groups, the
Friends of the Free University,
the Stanford Friends of Free
Film, the Faculty Committee for
Freedom of the Arts, and the
Graduate Cooridnating Commit
tee, volunteered to show "Scor
pio Rising" and "Un Chant
d'Amour",
The c four groups withdrew
their sponsorship of the films
on July 22, in order to let two
University departments, Speech
and Drama and French and
Italian, assume the responsibili
ty. The University quickly ca
pitulated and "Un Chant
d'Amour" was shown in Cubber
ly Auditorium on August 4
and 5.
The film scandal of summer
quarter, 19fiG, was over, but
neither side could say that they
were glad that it had happened.
