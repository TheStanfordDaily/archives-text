# Schmidt Out, Forstenzer In As Speaker
## 
### BARBARA WARREN 
Carl Schmidt, elected Speaker of
the Legislature last spring, has re
signed his post.
Tom Forstenzer, elected to the new
ly-created position of Legislature Lia
son Officer at the same time, will
succeed Schmidt.
Schmidt was active in student gov
ernment last year and was the only
major carryover from the Mackenzie
Administration. Candidate Schmidt
ran third in the ASSU Presidential
primary last spring missing the run
off.
Schmidt had not been heard from
this summer by any student govern
ment people until Student Body Presi
dent Dave Harris received Schmidt's
official resignation by letter. Schmidt
had been expected to serve as a
Stanford representative to the Na
tional Student's Congress in late
August but never showed.
At the NSA Congress, Rick Sterns,
another Stanford student, was elected
International Vice President. Sterns
and Schmidt have positions that will
take them touring through Europe
this fall for NSA.
Schmidt will probably be back for
winter quarter at Stanford. According
to Mike Collins, ASSU Vice President,
"Schmidt has indicated no particular
plans for participating when he re
turns." Collins later commented that
tery."
Forstenzer, who willt replace
Schmidt, stressed he will "take the
position on a temporary basis, until
the body can choose again. I do not
think it was the intent of the law to
have that position (legislative liason
officer) serve as an automatic perma
nent replacement." The bylaw passed
last spring creating the new post spe
cified that the liason officer "shall be
come Speaker if the Speaker is re
moved or no longer eligible for the
office." He added that if elected later
he would accept the office permanent
ly-
Forstenzer was not sure when the
new liason officer would be elected,
but indicated "the functions of the
new office probably should be
studied more fully before it was
refilled."
Forstenzer, asked about his
plans for the legislature, em
phasized there is a great deal to
continue like the work of the
Committee of Fifteen. He stres
sed more student involvement
in student policies as he hoped
to make them "less intitutional
matters and more student mat
ters." He wanted to bring in
more articulate student opinion.
Another important aim he
cited is to "make the representa
tives more than just legally re
sponsible to constituents." Col

lins supported this aim by stat
ing that "there will be more del
egation of authority this year."
When questioned about the
present conflict of law over open
house hours between University
and LASSU regulations, For
stenzer commented, "We cer
tainly do not intend to ignore it.
We meant it." The Student Af
fairs and Services Committees'
recommendations on open house
hours has not yet drawn public
response from the administra
tion.
Forsten/.er is a graduate and
teaching assistant in History.
As Student Body President of
Reed College he participated in
the first successful joint student
faculty government.
The first LASSU (Legislature
of the Associated Students of
Stanford University) will take
place a week from Thursday.
All student living groups should
elect their representatives by
that time.

Tom Forstenzer, elected to the new
ly-created position of Legislature Lia
son Officer at the same time, will
succeed Schmidt.
Schmidt was active in student gov
ernment last year and was the only
major carryover from the Mackenzie
Administration. Candidate Schmidt
ran third in the ASSU Presidential
primary last spring missing the run
off.
Schmidt had not been heard from
this summer by any student govern
ment people until Student Body Presi
dent Dave Harris received Schmidt's
official resignation by letter. Schmidt
had been expected to serve as a
Stanford representative to the Na
tional Student's Congress in late
August but never showed.
At the NSA Congress, Rick Sterns,
another Stanford student, was elected
International Vice President. Sterns
and Schmidt have positions that will
take them touring through Europe
this fall for NSA.
Schmidt will probably be back for
winter quarter at Stanford. According
to Mike Collins, ASSU Vice President,
"Schmidt has indicated no particular
plans for participating when he re
turns." Collins later commented that
tery."
Forstenzer, who willt replace
Schmidt, stressed he will "take the
position on a temporary basis, until
the body can choose again. I do not
think it was the intent of the law to
have that position (legislative liason
officer) serve as an automatic perma
nent replacement." The bylaw passed
last spring creating the new post spe
cified that the liason officer "shall be
come Speaker if the Speaker is re
moved or no longer eligible for the
office." He added that if elected later
he would accept the office permanent
ly-
Forstenzer was not sure when the
new liason officer would be elected,
but indicated "the functions of the
new office probably should be
studied more fully before it was
refilled."
Forstenzer, asked about his
plans for the legislature, em
phasized there is a great deal to
continue like the work of the
Committee of Fifteen. He stres
sed more student involvement
in student policies as he hoped
to make them "less intitutional
matters and more student mat
ters." He wanted to bring in
more articulate student opinion.
Another important aim he
cited is to "make the representa
tives more than just legally re
sponsible to constituents." Col

lins supported this aim by stat
ing that "there will be more del
egation of authority this year."
When questioned about the
present conflict of law over open
house hours between University
and LASSU regulations, For
stenzer commented, "We cer
tainly do not intend to ignore it.
We meant it." The Student Af
fairs and Services Committees'
recommendations on open house
hours has not yet drawn public
response from the administra
tion.
Forsten/.er is a graduate and
teaching assistant in History.
As Student Body President of
Reed College he participated in
the first successful joint student
faculty government.
The first LASSU (Legislature
of the Associated Students of
Stanford University) will take
place a week from Thursday.
All student living groups should
elect their representatives by
that time.
