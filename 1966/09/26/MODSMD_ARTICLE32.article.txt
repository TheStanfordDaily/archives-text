## Observer To Attempt ‘Undistorted Picture' 
### GORDON PIPER 
"New Monthly Neswpaper
Will Tell Story of Stanford in
Diversity, Depth," says the bold
headline on the front page of
Stanford's latest literary ven
ture — The Stanford Observer.
Published last June for the
first time by the University's
News and Publications Service
The Stanford Observer as
clearly stated in the introduct
ory article is designed "to con
vey an undistorted picture of
Stanford to the people most

interested in knowing what goes
on here and why."
Depending on reader response
to the first eight-page issue and
also on the availability of funds
to finance the newspaper, "The
Observer" is expected to have
a circulation of nearly 100,000
among Stanford alumni, stu
dents parents, faculty, and
friends (all of whom received a
free copy of the pilot edition.)
The originator of the idea
for the new publication was Ro
bert Pierce, head of the Alumni

Association. He saw The Obser
ver as a mean of improving re
lations between the University
and alumni.
Observer Editor Harry Press,
former city editor of the San
Francisco News-Call-Bulletin,
and a Neiman Fellow says there
will be no editorializing in The
Observer, just "an honest and
complete report of what is go
ing on in the university commu
nity."
Press was quick to deny that
the Stanford Daily's approach
has been objectionable or too
"liberal" for the tastes of Stan
ford alumni. "The Daily," he
said, "because it is a student
newspaper, necessarily has a
student approach."
"They give limited treatment
to topics such as President Ster
ling's recent aid-to-corporate-ed
ucation speech which alumni
would like to hear more about,"
Press concluded.
The staff of the Observer will
not include students, and the
main source of its information
will be the Stanford News Ser
vice.
Although the Stanford News
Service sends out more thrin
1000 stories per year to local
and national paperfc ,the re
cipients frequently do not print
all this news, or print it in the
same form as it is received.
To enlighten all those inter
ested in Stanford's new student
body president, Press assigned
Dan Endsley, editor of the Stan
ford Review and the Alumni Al
manac, to do a special feature
story on Harris which appeared
in last month's issue. In addi
tion, there was a special two
page center spread on student
activism at Stanford.
The Stanford Observer, ac
cording to Press, is designed
neither to compete with the
Stanford Daily nor to replace
Stanford Today, the Univer
sity's quarterly."

Dan Endsley, editor of the Stan
ford Review and the Alumni Al
manac, to do a special feature
story on Harris which appeared
in last month's issue. In addi
tion, there was a special two
page center spread on student
activism at Stanford.
The Stanford Observer, ac
cording to Press, is designed
neither to compete with the
Stanford Daily nor to replace
Stanford Today, the Univer
sity's quarterly."
"New Monthly Neswpaper
Will Tell Story of Stanford in
Diversity, Depth," says the bold
headline on the front page of
Stanford's latest literary ven
ture — The Stanford Observer.
Published last June for the
first time by the University's
News and Publications Service
The Stanford Observer as
clearly stated in the introduct
ory article is designed "to con
vey an undistorted picture of
Stanford to the people most

interested in knowing what goes
on here and why."
Depending on reader response
to the first eight-page issue and
also on the availability of funds
to finance the newspaper, "The
Observer" is expected to have
a circulation of nearly 100,000
among Stanford alumni, stu
dents parents, faculty, and
friends (all of whom received a
free copy of the pilot edition.)
The originator of the idea
for the new publication was Ro
bert Pierce, head of the Alumni

Association. He saw The Obser
ver as a mean of improving re
lations between the University
and alumni.
Observer Editor Harry Press,
former city editor of the San
Francisco News-Call-Bulletin,
and a Neiman Fellow says there
will be no editorializing in The
Observer, just "an honest and
complete report of what is go
ing on in the university commu
nity."
Press was quick to deny that
the Stanford Daily's approach
has been objectionable or too
"liberal" for the tastes of Stan
ford alumni. "The Daily," he
said, "because it is a student
newspaper, necessarily has a
student approach."
"They give limited treatment
to topics such as President Ster
ling's recent aid-to-corporate-ed
ucation speech which alumni
would like to hear more about,"
Press concluded.
The staff of the Observer will
not include students, and the
main source of its information
will be the Stanford News Ser
vice.
Although the Stanford News
Service sends out more thrin
1000 stories per year to local
and national paperfc ,the re
cipients frequently do not print
all this news, or print it in the
same form as it is received.
