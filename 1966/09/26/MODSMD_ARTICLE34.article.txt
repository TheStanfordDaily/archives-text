The SCPV is a Stanford group
organized last year to protest
the United States position in
Vietnam.
Bruce Franklin, Professor of
English, began the July 7 ses
sion with a general background
and history of Vietnam. After
tracing the country's history
from 1940 to the present, Frank
lin discussed the U.S. position
in the Vietnam wah
Franklin explained that Uni
ted States policy on withdrawal
from Vietnam is based on what
the U.S. hopes to achieve there.

He listed the terms of the Na
tional Liberation Front as the
key to success in the Southeast
Asian country.
The terms include electing a
new national assembly, grant
ing emnesty to political prison
ers, revitalizing agriculture, or
ganizing social welfare, guaran
tees property rights, establish
ing diplomatic relations with all
countries regardless of their po
litical status, and other mea
sures.
Franklin stated that U.S. re
fusal to accept the principles of
the National Liberation Front is
keeping this country from with
drawing from Vietnam.
His speech was followed by
former SCPV chairman Cyril
Sia's discussion of the legal his
tory of Vietnam.
He also talked of peace feel
ers and peace offensives in his
speech.
Philosophy Instructor Ken
Mills ended the session question
ing the moral aspect of the war.
Graduate student Keith Lowe
talked on Vietnamese insur
gency the following day. Arthur
Driessel, Stanford instructor in

ternatives and withdrawal pos
sibilities.
SCPV member Dick Newlin
jection. He stated that presently
only "those who are convinced
by their religious beliefs that
they are forbidden to kill an
other are considered conscien
tious objectors." He stated that
philosophical grounds are not
considered significant for object
ing to government policy.
In discussing the war, Newlin
explained that the U.S. involve
ment in Vietnam is based on
economics. He cited the cost of
the war and profit that business
is making from government con
tracts for war materials.
"Our reasons for being in
Vietnam are not principles of
democracy," Newlin said. He
projected that if war profit were
eliminated, the war might end
soon.
Newlin discussed the draft.
He claimed that the present
draft system is unbalanced, and

that it unjustly discriminates
against the lower classes.
He proposed that both men
and women be drafted, and that
they should be allowed to enter
either military or civilian ser
vice.
Commenting on the public's
role in the war, Newlin cited re
cent polls that show the general
disapproval of the administra
tion policy. He claimed that
most disapproval ends with
polls.
"Either conform or you are
disobedient. Yet it is this habit
of obedience that keeps the war
going," he 6aid. "One should
cease being disappointed in Viet
nam ,and actively resist it."
Following Newlin's speech,
Mrs. Lisa Kalvelage, a San Jose
housewift, reported on her pro
test of the use of napalm. She

was convicted in June of civil
disobedience and given a $100
fine and a 90-day jail sentence.
A member of the Women's In
ternational League for Peace
and Freedom, Mrs. Kalvelage
was arrested laet May for at
tempting to stop shipment of
napalm.
Reflecting on why she and
Kalvelage stated that her ac
tions were prompted partly by
"thinking about our children
and the children in Vietnam."
She added that her West Ger
man background also influenced
her position.
