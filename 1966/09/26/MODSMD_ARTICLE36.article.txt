# PROBLEMS OLD AS GREEKS
## ‘Elektra’ Doesn’t Electrify 
### JEFF BINGAMAN 
In commenting on the San
Francisco Opera's production of
Elektra by Richard Strauss, the
temptation is to say that all
those involved—the librettist,
the composer, the conductor,
and the individual cast members
—did an excellent job consider
ing what they had to work with.

But the blame must be placed
somewhere, and to place its full
weight on the Greeks who are
already unduly criticized for
several of opera's major short
ening just because they con
cocted the original legend would
be both unfair and inaccurate.
The production is good and
even excellent in parts, but the

problems inherent in the opera
and largely inherent in the
Greek tragedy from which the
opera originates, are not com
pletely resolved.
Elektra, the first of the
Strauss-Hofmannsthal operas, is
possibly the greatest of Strauss'
operatic works, but is almost
certainly the most difficult to

produce. The entire opera de
mands a level of dramatic ten
sion which most operas aspire
to only for short periods. Except
for the recognition by Elektra
of her brother Orestes, the omi
nous depraved nature of the
story is always in the forefront.
Deranged Sub human
The lead role is superbly por
trayed by Amy Shuard. From
her initial cowering entrance un
til the last of numerous dying
breaths, the image of a de
ranged, perverted sub-human is
forcefully brought home. Shu
ard's powerful performance and
voice are complemented by the
American debut of Enriqueta
Tarres as Elektra's compassion
ate sister Chrysothemis. Tarres
does an excellent job of portray
ing the passive, self-effacing sis
ter who gazes in horror at the
plotting and deception around
her. The voices of Shuard and
Tarres are well matched and
serve as a constant reminder of
the intimacy which these two
characters share in spite of their
radically different natures.
Klytemnestra, the mother of
Elektra and the accomplice to
the assassination of Agamem
non, is perhaps the least com
plex of the major characters in
the opera. Hegina Resnik is ex
tremely convincing as this ma
tronly embodiment of evil. The
relish with which she receives
the news of Orestes' death and
the exit which follows combine
into what is undoubtedly one of
the high points of the produc
tion.
Blah Performance
Thomas Stewart as Orestes j
fails to make much of an im
pression either favorable or un
favorable. Some of this failing
is due to the part which is too
minor to allow for much devel
opment, but most of the failing
results from his voice being
overwhelmed by those of Shu
ard and Tarres. Richard Cassilly
who makes his debut with the
San Francisco Opera in the role
of Aegisthus, the King and lover
of Klytemnestra, is to be com
mended for a fine performance
in a small but crucial part.
The orchestra under the direc
tion of Horst Stein is deserving
of special praise for a near flaw
less performance. The technical
aspects of the production were
likewise quite good with the ex
ception of a few stray spotlights
which diverted attention from
the performers.
Elektra will again be produced
by the San Francisco Opera
September 30 and October 6.
