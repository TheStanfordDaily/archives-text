of the Arts next year and what might
be offered are twin problems now un
der discussion, according to Virgil K.

If the festival is held, its theme will
center around America's contribution
to the arts. All this is contingent upon
analysis of attendance and expenses
for this year, the figures for which
are not fully tabulated.
One estimate of the cost of the 196(5
festival is around $40,000.
"As a university," said Whitaker,
"our goal is to bring new cultural in
terests to those who need them."

seen in the response to the American
Conservatory Theatre, a repertory
group which drew the best attendance
of any festival event ($28,000).
San Francisco was negotiating this
week end with the repertory company
to split its time between there and
Chicago.
