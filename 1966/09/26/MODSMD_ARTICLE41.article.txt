# Water Polo Team Aims For Collegiate Crown
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER Sports Editor 
The strongest and deepest
water polo team in Stanford his
tory opens its season Thursday
afternoon at 3:30, hoping to
make San Francisco State the
first rung on the slippery ladder
to the NCAA summit.
Coach Jim Gaughran's squad
placed second in the country be
hind UCLA last year. Only two
seniors have been lost from that
team and nine lettermen, includ
ing four of last year's top five
scorers, are returning.
Two powerful transfer stu
dents and five players from last
season's successful freshman
squad will put the cutting edge
on what will be the sharpest
college water polo offense the
Encina pool has ever seen.
Stanford's 1965 squad put
forth an offense that was a feat
to contain. Five Indians scored
in the vicinity of 30 goals for the
20 game season, giving oppo
nents no one or two men to fo
cus upon.
Four of Five Return
Four of these five players are
now juniors. Three times All
Conference Mike Eshelman has
graduated, but Gary Sheerer,
Pete Ready, Mark Parmely, and
Bi'l Meyer have two more years
to do their damage.
Foothill transfer John Parker
and Stanford's Greg Bucking
ham add two high powered
charges to the Stanford maga
zine.
Sophomores Pete Siebert and
Luis Nicolao will be vying for
starting spots.
Seniors Bill Derrig and Doug
Jensen and juniors Walt Poter

bin and Doug Mac Lean return
with varsity letters.
Mike Sorem, a senior, will take
the crucial position in front of
the Stanford goal. Sophomore
Doug Chapin will back up Sor
em.
Junior Craig Brown and soph
omores Morgan Manning and
JefT Hammett stretch Stanford's
depth to two full teams.
"As Good, If Not..
Gaughran sees his squad this
year as man for man as tough
as or tougher than any team in
the AAWU, which means ef
fectively, in the nation.
Stanford's great depth this
year will enable the Tribe to
keep its head above water vir
tually untouched when other
teams begin to feel the bite after
three or four men have fouled
out in a tight game.
Stanford should present once
again a balanced scoring threat
with dangerous potential from
every corner. Picking 7 starters
from a group of players so even
ly matched will be a pleasantly
difficult chore for Gaughran.
Gary Sheerer earned first
team All-American honors last
season despite a broken hand
that kept him out a third of the
season. The deciding factor was
an eight goal, two and a half
quarter spree against USC.
Most Outstanding Player
Sheerer's star shone brighter
last summer. His Foothill Aqua
tic Club AAU team won the na
tional championship and Sheerer
was picked as the "Outstanding
Player" of the National Tourna
ment. Sheerer toured Yugoslavia
and Italy with the team after
the tournament.
Pete Ready topped the list of
Stanford scorers last year with
a total of 33 goals. Ready's
patented array of powerful
backhands and sweep shots have
made the back of his head as
ominous a sight as the front to
an opposing goalie.
Mark' Parmely started water
polo as a Stanford freshman and
was named Outstanding Player

at the Nor Cal Open Tourna
ment at the end of his sopho
more season. Parmely played on
the Foothill AAU team with
Sheerer all summer and looks
forward to his best season yet.
Bill Meyer was second to
Ready in Stanford scoring last
year, blossoming in the second
half of the season. After a bout
with mono last summer, Meyer
is regaining lost time and will
be ready to fire in the season
opener Thursday.
Sorem Guards Net
Mike Sorem, one of three
seniors on the squad, will take
his place in front of the Stan
ford goal. Sorem came on strong
towards the end of last season
and played with Foothill last
summer.
John Parker played as Sheer
er's teammate on the national
champion Foothill Aquatic Club
first string. Parker will become
a sore point for Stanford oppo
nents.
Greg Buckingham played for
the San Francisco Olympic Club
last Fall, but is now eligible for
the Stanford varsity. Bucking
ham diverted himself last sum
mer setting world records (200
meter individual medley).
Buckingham will find a place in
the Tribe's solid forward wall.
Sophs Impressive
Pete Siebert, freshman team
captain last year, has been im
pressive in pre-season practice
and will be vying for a starting
position.
Luis Nicolao, high freshman
scorer last year, has been put
ting forth top notch teamwork
play in the pre season practices,
and will find a prominent place
in the Indians' united front.
Bill Derrig played during the
summer with Southern Califor
nia's Inland Nu-Pike team, and
appears headed toward the best
of his three years of varsity
polo.
Doug Jensen, a consistent and
aggressive player last season, is
up to form in the first weeks of
practice. The ornery Oxnardian
will be tought to contain.
