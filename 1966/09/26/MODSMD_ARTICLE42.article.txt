### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
A brown-clad Stanford man
sat head in hand beside Mem.
Aud. this morning, wistfully re
garding an unpretentious IBM
processed slip of paper.
He had survived three years
with never a mark below a B- to
smear his 3.74 array of grade
points.
Now a disgustingly curved,
perniciously hyphenated, un
usually heavily stamped C
leered ominously upwards from
the red and white citation.
Saline sympathy welled up in
two forlorn eyes, while the tiny
semi-circle sneered.
"What's on your mind, Char
lie boy" piped out an assembly
of mocassins, blue vi's, white T
shirt, and blue wind breaker.
"I blew it, Joe" was the plain
tive response.
"Blew what?"
• Sandwich in the Sky
"I took a big bite from that
big sandwich in the sky," sighed
Charle, licking his wisdom teeth.
"Oh, really? I didn't know
there was any left up there — I
just ate a hearty meal," replied
a satiated Joe.
"Yeah, it took three years, but
I finally landed a C."
"C plus?"
"No. Minus."
Then it could have been
worse. Smile' What'd you sat it
in?"
"Bowling."
"Bowling! Are you kidding
me? And after an A+ in organ
ic. ... "
"Yeah, I had a 133 average,
and that's where it fell on the
curve," sighed Charlie, painfully
contorting his face.
"That's a shame, Charlie boy.
I took it the quarter before you
did, rolled 131 overall, and got
a B."
