# Karate Club Begins Year, Expands Instruction Slate
## 
### 
The Stanford Karate Club will
begin its third year of activity
this fall with a program offering
karate instruction to students at
all levels of proficiency. Karate
is one of the oldest known sys
tems of unarmed self-defense
and, in the past few years, it
has become a very popular com
petitive sport.
While many styles of karate
exist at the present time, the
Stanford club studies a Chinese
style called Kenpo which has
proven to be very effective in
competitive tournaments. This
style is like other forms of ka
rate in that the hands and feet
are converted into weapons of
sufficient power to break boards
and bricks as well as to inflict
serious or fatal damage on a hu
man attacker.
Sticks and Stones
The Stanford club does not
emphasize the spectacular
breaking feats, but rather con
centrates on the more funda
mental purposes of karate: self
defense, competition, and physi
cal conditioning.
In learning to defend himself,
the student is taught to deliver
kicks and punches to his oppo
nent's vital organs with a com
bination of speed and power. He
also learns to block the kicks
and punches of his opponent so
that he may effectively counter
the attack.
For example, one defense
against a right punch to the
face involves a left vertical out
ward block which serves to de
flect the attacker's blow. This
enables the karate man to then
counter with a combination ka
rate punch to the face or throat
and a snapping kick to the groin
followed by any additional

moves necessary to stop the at
tacker.
Specific responses to various
types of attack are taught so
that the student is able to suc
cessfully defend himself against
not only one but several oppo
nents.
Teach Sparring
Free-style sparring, which is
the basis for competitive karate,
is also taught. Before he begins
to engage in sparring, or kumite,
the student learns to pull his
kicks and punches short of con
tact so that the possibility of in
jury is ruled out.
No student is allowed to spar
until the instructor considers his
self-control sufficient to prevent
injury. Since the Stanford Ka
rate Club was formed, its mem
bers have participated in more
than ten major karate tourna
ments including the Interna
tional Karate Championships
held annually in Long Beach.
The possibility of holding a tour
nament at Stanford this year is
being considered.
SF Instructor
A qualified instructor who is a
member of the teaching staff of
a San Francisco Kenpo Karate
studio will head this year's pro
gram. Because the club is a
member of the International
Kenpo Karate Association, pro
motions in rank are granted
which are recognized interna
tionally.
The organizational meeting of
the club will be held on Thurs
day, September 29, at 7:00 p.m.
in the men's gym and regular
meetings will be held every
Tuesday and Thursday thereaf
ter. Everyone (men and women)
is welcome to join, undergradu
ates, grad students, faculty and
staff. Experience is not required.

nent's vital organs with a com
bination of speed and power. He
also learns to block the kicks
and punches of his opponent so
that he may effectively counter
the attack.
For example, one defense
against a right punch to the
face involves a left vertical out
ward block which serves to de
flect the attacker's blow. This
enables the karate man to then
counter with a combination ka
rate punch to the face or throat
and a snapping kick to the groin
followed by any additional

moves necessary to stop the at
tacker.
Specific responses to various
types of attack are taught so
that the student is able to suc
cessfully defend himself against
not only one but several oppo
nents.
Teach Sparring
Free-style sparring, which is
the basis for competitive karate,
is also taught. Before he begins
to engage in sparring, or kumite,
the student learns to pull his
kicks and punches short of con
tact so that the possibility of in
jury is ruled out.
No student is allowed to spar
until the instructor considers his
self-control sufficient to prevent
injury. Since the Stanford Ka
rate Club was formed, its mem
bers have participated in more
than ten major karate tourna
ments including the Interna
tional Karate Championships
held annually in Long Beach.
The possibility of holding a tour
nament at Stanford this year is
being considered.
SF Instructor
A qualified instructor who is a
member of the teaching staff of
a San Francisco Kenpo Karate
studio will head this year's pro
gram. Because the club is a
member of the International
Kenpo Karate Association, pro
motions in rank are granted
which are recognized interna
tionally.
The organizational meeting of
the club will be held on Thurs
day, September 29, at 7:00 p.m.
in the men's gym and regular
meetings will be held every
Tuesday and Thursday thereaf
ter. Everyone (men and women)
is welcome to join, undergradu
ates, grad students, faculty and
staff. Experience is not required.
The Stanford Karate Club will
begin its third year of activity
this fall with a program offering
karate instruction to students at
all levels of proficiency. Karate
is one of the oldest known sys
tems of unarmed self-defense
and, in the past few years, it
has become a very popular com
petitive sport.
While many styles of karate
exist at the present time, the
Stanford club studies a Chinese
style called Kenpo which has
proven to be very effective in
competitive tournaments. This
style is like other forms of ka
rate in that the hands and feet
are converted into weapons of
sufficient power to break boards
and bricks as well as to inflict
serious or fatal damage on a hu
man attacker.
Sticks and Stones
The Stanford club does not
emphasize the spectacular
breaking feats, but rather con
centrates on the more funda
mental purposes of karate: self
defense, competition, and physi
cal conditioning.
