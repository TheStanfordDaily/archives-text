# FUMBLES & FOIBLES
## Gophers Trample Tribe 
### TOM EDISON 
Four fumbles and four inter
ceptions led Stanford to a 35-21
humiliation at Minnesota last
Saturday.
The Indians attempted to re
peat last week's come-from-be
hind victory over San Jose by
scoring 14 points in the final
quarter while holding the Go
phers scoreless. The Indians,
however, could not undo the
working over that they had re
ceived in the first half. Minne
sota led 21-0 after two periods.
The Gophers' first score re
sulted from a pass interception
after Stanford had put together
a consistent drive during the
early minutes of the contest.
Minnesota scored eight plays la
ter when the Gophers' lighten

ing-quick quarterback Curtis
Wilson bolted in from four
yards out. Wilson fumbled in
the end zone but end Chet An
derson pounced on the ball for
a touchdown. After a successful
PAT Minnesota led 7-0.
65-Yard March
In the second quarter the Go
phers again dug in for a 65-
yard march to pay-dirt. The
score came on a pitch-out from
Wilson to half Dick Peterson
from 15 yards out. Jerry Bev
an's extra point boot was good.
A fumble by the Indians' Gene
Washington just before half
time on the Indians' 14 yard line
made Stanford's chances for re
covery extremely difficult.
Wilson once again wheeled the

Minnesota crew in for a score
on three bursts through Stan
ford's porous defense.
Gene Washington turned a
Gopher fumble into a score
early in the third period when
he escaped a massive defensive
rush and flipped a 16-yard touch
down pass to flanker Dave
Lewis.
However, Bill Shoemaker cut
the margin to 21-7 with a one
point conversion. Before Stan
ford even had time to believe
that they could get back into
the game, Ray Whitlow return
ed the kickofT 81 yards before
being hog-tied by Donn Renwick

on the 16. Once again Wilson
ploughed over, this time from
the one.
Wilson Passes For Score
Stanford's final humiliation
resulted from a Jon Huss
fumble that was turned into a
touchdown. Wilson passed 10

yards to Chip Litten for the
score. This fifth and final Go
pher touchdown extended their
lead to 28 points.
Gene Washington attempted
a miraculous come back in the
final quarter while extending
his passing statistics to nine
completions out of 21 tries for
171 yards.
A partially united Stanford
chorus followed a bouncing ball
early in the fourth quarter that
resulted in a fumble recovery
and a score. The tribe went 61
yards on the arm of Washington
and into for a score on the bul
wark of fullback Jack Root.
Lewis rambled over for the two
point conversion.
Chuck Williams, a transfer to
Stanford from Centura JC, guid
ed the Indians to the final scor
ing effort on a 13-yard pass to
Bob Blunt. Williams was suc
cessful on three of his five pass
ing attempts which netted 52
yards.
Stats Favor Stanford
Final statistics show Stanford
out gaining the Gophers on total
offensive yardage by 30 yards.

Fumbles and interceptions, how
ever, took the hurt out of the
Indian's punch.
Bob Conrad was responsible
for 102 yards of Stanford's total
yardage. He caught six passes,
one for 25 which set up Stan
ford's second score.
The Indians play host to Tu
lane next weekend in their third
consecutive non - conference
game. The Green Wave is hot
from two straight victories. The
latest a 21-13 upset over Texas
A&M. Stanford's first confer
ence game is against Oregon at
Portland on October 8.
