# Stanford Crew Sends Six Men To Jugoslavian Meet
## 
### CARL MUNDT 
Stanford's Varsity Crew con
tinued its amazing surge to the
forefront of national rowing
prominence by dominating the
American team which competed
in the World Rowing Champion
ships in Bled, Jugoslavia from
September 8 to 11.
The road to Bled began in
Palo Alto in June with the im
plementation of an experiment
al rowing program for varsity
oarsmen.
After weeks of grueling prep
aration Larry Hough, Bill
Stump, John Stitt, and Jim Mad
den — members of last year's
varsity — teamed up with Dick
Lyon and John Kiely, graduate
students in Engineering, and
Ted Mittet and Geza Berger,
Bay Area Olympians, to race in
the Northwest Invitational Re
gatta in Seattle, Washington *m
July 16.
Overwater Demolition
Guilded by Coxswain Kent
Mitchell, Stanford '61 and Olym
pic gold medal winner, the eight
oarsmen devastated everything
in sight in Seattle and won
every race they entered by
stunning margins.
When the waves subsided, the
Indians had coasted to victories
over 2 Canadian entries and a
boat composed of University of
Washington oarsmen in the
eight-oared final, the four wilh
coxswain and the four without
coxswain.
Fresh from Seattle, the eight
Stanford oarsmen ventured east
to the National Rowing Cham
pionships in Philadelphia, Pen
nsylvania at the end of August.
There the Indians ran into a
stiff wall of competion from
boats from Australia, New Zea
land, Canada and America's
1964 Olympic gold medal win
ner, the Vesper Boat Club eight.
All Boats Reach Finals
Once again Stanford entered
two fours and an eight. All
three boats got into the finals
after mounting impressive qual
ifying times. Only the four with
out coxswain, however, man
aged to win an American title
beating the Potomac Boat Club
by 2y 2 lengths. The eight finish
ed third and the four with cox
swain was fifth.
Due to Stanford's strong
showing in the nationals, Kent
Mitchell, the Indian coxswain,
was selected as a coach of the
U. S. team bound for Jugoslavia.
In addition Stanford's four-with
out was rewarded with berths
on the team.
Larry Hough, last year's cap
tain and Jim Madden, a Junior
Varsity oarsman in the '65 cam
paign, were chosen as alternates
and also accompanied the team
to Bled.
Boats from all over the world
including West Germany,
U.S.S.R., Italy, Australia and
East Germany assembled in
Bled on September Bth to de
cide the world rowing ehjimpion.
Six Indians Participate
Six Stanford oarsmen rowed
or coxed in these races and cer
tainly were impressed by the
speed of the East Germans who
dominated the program. The
four-without finished 9th and
four-with finished sixth as last
year's captain Larry Hough
moved up from alternate to
bowman.
Indian oarsmen will have
much to aim for next summer
also. An American team will be
sent to the Pan American
games, the North American

Rowing Championships and the
European Championships in
Vichy, France. Stanford's coach
ing staff is confident that a large
number of undergraduates will
be on that team.
Consequently, an expanded
rowing program will be offered
on the Farm this autumn. In
addition to the regular Frosh
and varsity turnout, the coaches
hope that a large number of in
experienced upper classmen and
transfers will learn to row this
year.
The fall schedule includes
great emphasis on acquiring the
fundamentals of rowing tech
nique. Led by captain Bill
Stump the Indian boats should
be tough to beat by racing sea
son next spring.

When the waves subsided, the
Indians had coasted to victories
over 2 Canadian entries and a
boat composed of University of
Washington oarsmen in the
eight-oared final, the four wilh
coxswain and the four without
coxswain.
Fresh from Seattle, the eight
Stanford oarsmen ventured east
to the National Rowing Cham
pionships in Philadelphia, Pen
nsylvania at the end of August.
There the Indians ran into a
stiff wall of competion from
boats from Australia, New Zea
land, Canada and America's
1964 Olympic gold medal win
ner, the Vesper Boat Club eight.
All Boats Reach Finals
Once again Stanford entered
two fours and an eight. All
three boats got into the finals
after mounting impressive qual
ifying times. Only the four with
out coxswain, however, man
aged to win an American title
beating the Potomac Boat Club
by 2y 2 lengths. The eight finish
ed third and the four with cox
swain was fifth.
Due to Stanford's strong
showing in the nationals, Kent
Mitchell, the Indian coxswain,
was selected as a coach of the
U. S. team bound for Jugoslavia.
In addition Stanford's four-with
out was rewarded with berths
on the team.
Larry Hough, last year's cap
tain and Jim Madden, a Junior
Varsity oarsman in the '65 cam
paign, were chosen as alternates
and also accompanied the team
to Bled.
Boats from all over the world
including West Germany,
U.S.S.R., Italy, Australia and
East Germany assembled in
Bled on September Bth to de
cide the world rowing ehjimpion.
Six Indians Participate
Six Stanford oarsmen rowed
or coxed in these races and cer
tainly were impressed by the
speed of the East Germans who
dominated the program. The
four-without finished 9th and
four-with finished sixth as last
year's captain Larry Hough
moved up from alternate to
bowman.
Indian oarsmen will have
much to aim for next summer
also. An American team will be
sent to the Pan American
games, the North American

Rowing Championships and the
European Championships in
Vichy, France. Stanford's coach
ing staff is confident that a large
number of undergraduates will
be on that team.
Consequently, an expanded
rowing program will be offered
on the Farm this autumn. In
addition to the regular Frosh
and varsity turnout, the coaches
hope that a large number of in
experienced upper classmen and
transfers will learn to row this
year.
The fall schedule includes
great emphasis on acquiring the
fundamentals of rowing tech
nique. Led by captain Bill
Stump the Indian boats should
be tough to beat by racing sea
son next spring.
Stanford's Varsity Crew con
tinued its amazing surge to the
forefront of national rowing
prominence by dominating the
American team which competed
in the World Rowing Champion
ships in Bled, Jugoslavia from
September 8 to 11.
The road to Bled began in
Palo Alto in June with the im
plementation of an experiment
al rowing program for varsity
oarsmen.
After weeks of grueling prep
aration Larry Hough, Bill
Stump, John Stitt, and Jim Mad
den — members of last year's
varsity — teamed up with Dick
Lyon and John Kiely, graduate
students in Engineering, and
Ted Mittet and Geza Berger,
Bay Area Olympians, to race in
the Northwest Invitational Re
