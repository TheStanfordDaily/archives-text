## Give The Rascals A Chance! 
### MIKE COUZENS 
Administrative rascals and
student rascals have drawn the
lines of battle. Though classes
have not yet begun, traditional
factions have already found rea
sons to view one another at
sword point.
This is happening too fast.
Those who hasten it by attack
ing freshmen ebullience with de
mythologization should consider
the contradiction in their atti
tude. They defend a student
viewpoint for its freshness. This
atones for the lack of expertise
which more barnackled mem
bers of the community can
claim.
But the freshest viewpoint is
the freshman's. Even if cyni
cism is the "right" attitude, he
should get it through experi
ence, not as an heirloom.
Factionalism also reflects a
"cause consciousness" persisting
from past year. Each admini
strative maneuver, malignant or
benign, is already being inter
preted in terms of its potential
for being whipped into a cru
sade.
Administrators foment fac
tionalism whenever they label
students. Worse yet are recur
ring signs that the expected
new approach this year will be
met with the old responses.
Sometimes it is the difference

between openness and a refusal
to negotiate. At others, it is the
difference between attacking an
advocate and attacking his ar
guments. Some of the Stanford
beards are among the commu
nity's most astute members.
Stanford needs openness, and
a willingness to give the other
rascals a chance. It also needs
to remember that it is a com
munity before housing, open
hours, curricular atrocities and
all the other old saws force us
into an idiom which ends with
thrust and parry.
Signs of Hope
Two hopeful signs may be
found: within the vestry of Me
morial Church and without. In
side, the old partition enclosing
an office has been removed by
Buildings and Grounds. B. Davie
Napier, the new Dean, is clearly
set on breaking down more bar
riers in the year ahead.
Outside the vestry is a large
circle of resplendent yellow and
orange marigolds. The marigold
has itself been enough to break
down factions in the United
States Senate each year, when
Everett McKinley Dirksen finds
himself moved to speak about
flowers. From the 1963 Congres
sional Record:
"Two or three years ago, I
introduced a joint resolution to
make the marigold the national

flower. That stirred quite a con
troversy ,and, as a result, the
corn tassel and the rose and
other flowers were advanced as
candidates for our national flor
al emblem.
Wedded to Marigold
"But I still find myself wed
ded to the marigold â€” robust,
rugged, bright, stately, single
colored and multi colored, some
how able to resist the onslaught
of insects; it takes in its stride
extreme changes in tempera
ture, and fights back the scorch
ing sun in summer and the chill
of early spffng evenings. What
a flower the marigold is ... "
When Sen. Aiken of Vermont
objected that phlox were a more
American flower ,this exchange
followed:

"My trouble with phlox is as
follows: the rabbits will let the
salvia alone, and they will not
bother the pansies. They will not
bother the petunias. But the rab
bit is a discriminating animal.
He always nibbles off my
phlox."
Mr. Aiken: "But the rabbit
does not nibble the marigold.
He does not like its flavor."
Mr. Dirksen: "It has* a dis
tinctive flavor."
Mr. Aiken: "It has a distinc
tive smell, too."
Mr. Dirksen: "It has a dis
tinctive fragrance all its own."
The marigolds outside the
vestry are of unusual size and
brilliance. The community and
we rascals should take them in
to account.
