## LBJ Vs. The Intellectual – Not Such A Losing Battle? 
### William F. Buckley, Jr 
It is said that President John
son is losing the support of the
truth that relies for its cogency
on the unfortunate coincidence
between ultra-liberalism and
ultra-articulateness.
After all, if you can get, say,
Richard Rovere, Arthur Schle
singer, Dwight Macdonald,
James Reston, and Walter Lipp
man to agree on something,
and when can you not, the read
ing public has just about had it,
considering the leverage of
these gentlemen and their api
gones on public opinion, and
their extraordinary capacity to
fill the nation's libraries, maga
zines, and newspapers with
their thoughts. Indeed, when
ever they belch synchronically,
the lava flows, and one knows
what were the thoughts of the
wretched men of Pompeii as
they saw their approaching fate.
Lost Support
Now it happens that there are
an awful lot of intellectuals who
are free of the gravitational pull
of the eastern seaboard liberal
constellation; but it is the few
who generally make the head
lines, as when Professor Eric
Goldman recently resigned from
the White House, announcing
apocalyptically that the Presi
dent had lost the support of the
"intellectuals," and that inci
dentally he was going to write
a book about it, which will prob
ably net that intellectual about a
hundred gees; well worth a
break with the White House.
Professor Goldman's predec
sor was none other than the übi
quitous Mr. Schlesinger whose
glossolalia in behalf of contemp
orary liberalism is a 20th cen
tury phenomenon.
His problem is that John Ken
nedy — whom the Professor
worshipped beginning on the
day he was hired by him — ap
pointed Dean Rusk as Secretary
of State and Robert McNamara

as Secretary of Defense, and
both Rusk and McNamara ar
dently back President Johnson's
conduct of the war in Vietnam.
How to criticize Rusk and Mc-
Namara without treading on
sainted toes? Could Paul have
criticized Matthew and Mark?
Johnson's pursuit of the Viet
namese war, says Schlesinger,
has ended any possibility of his
going down in history as a great
President. It is assumed that a
landslide will follow.
Much Worry
Mr. Schlesinger's analyses are
so full of inconsistencies and ca
price as to cause as much worry
about the condition of the intel
lectuals in this country as about
the beleagured peasants in
South Vietnam.
What to single out as an ex
ample? There is his notion that
in Asia and in Africa and in
Latin America things will go as
they go quite unrelated to the
activity of the United States.
"The destruction of the Commu
nist Party in Indonesia" — one
of the "heaviest blows reor*tly
suffered by Peking" — "took
place without benefit of Ameri
can patronage or rhetoric."
Two days before Schlesinger's
apodictic utterance on the mat
ter, President Marcos of the
Philippines, who may be pre
sumed to know something about
Southeast Asia, stated at the
National Press Club that he
"personally knew for a fact that
the American presence in Viet
nam provided . . . encourage
ment and support to those who
sucessfully resisted the attempt
ed Communist takeover in In
donesia."
Flexible Response
Then the historian Schlesing
er certifies James Reston's gen
erality of two months ago that
"there is now hot a single na
tion in the world that supports
Mr. Johnson's latest adventure
in Hanoi and Haiphong."
The ideal response, says Schle
singer, is the flexible response.
"The triumph of this discrimi
nate employment of power was,
of course, the Cuban missle cri
sis." An English M.P. a month
ago wrote to the New York
Times agreeing with Reston
that Prime Minister Wilson was
opposed to bombing Hanoi and
Haiphong.
"The last notable occasion on
which Mr. Wilson dissociated
Mmself from vigorous Ameri
can action came at the time of
President Kennedy's confronta
tion with Fidel Castro in the
autumn of 1962."
Schlesinger's central conten
tion is that the effort to stop the
revolutionaries is bound to fail,
and along with it .great histori
cal opportunities to spoon with
Russia, and eliminate the last
American ghetto.
If there is any concern by
Mr. Schlesinger for the fate of
those we are, in effect, to aban
don, it is presumably beneath
the dignity of an intellectual to
express it.
