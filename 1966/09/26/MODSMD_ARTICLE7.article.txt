# PA Still Reticent On Hospital Sale
## 
### KIRK HANEN Associate Editor 
University officials yesterday re
ported no new action by the City of
Palo Alto regarding Stanford's offer
to buy that city's half of the jointly
owned Palo Alto-Stanford Hospital.
The matter is currently under study
by the Finance Committee of the
Palo Alto City Council. The Commit
tee's next scheduled meeting is in
three weeks.
Formal Offer
President J. E. Wallace Sterling
formalized the University's desire to
end joint ownership in a letter to Mrs.
Frances Dias, mayor of Palo Alto,
Aug. 8. Negotiations were begun last
January.
The Sterling letter placed the mar
ket value of the City's holdings at ap
proximately $5 million, "based on a
very preliminary analysis."
Several Palo Alto groups feel the
sum should be in the area of $7 mil
lion.
Palo Alto's original investment in
the facility was some $4.2 million.
The Alternatives
If the City were to sell out, it would
most likely concentrate on the ex
pansion of Hoover Pavilion to handle
hospital needs. Preliminary studies
have stressed the feasibility of this
move.
Hoover Pavilion is located on land
adjoining Palo Alto-Stanford Hospital
between Palm Drive and Stanford

Shopping Center. The facility is cur
rently used only for bedding down
patients.
Stanford's Board of Trustees has
agreed, in the terms of the offer,
to sell the City enough of the univer
sity-owned land surrounding Hoover
Pavilion to make such expansion pos
sible.
Separation
Otherwise, Stanford will proceed
with plans for expansion of its own
facility, designed as an "independent
unit, both administratively and func
tionally."
However, Sterling made it clear
that no changes in the basic structure
of the working agreement governing
the hospital would be made "until ad
ditional beds are available in the com
munity."
Under the present arrangement,
one wing of the three-wing hospital is
used by Palo Alto physicians, a second
by Stanford Medical School, and the
third houses offices and equipment.
No Agreement in Sight
Kenneth Cuthbertson, University
Vice President in charge of Finance,
described the proposed acquisition as
necessary "for the good of the medi
cal school. The University must have
full control of its facilities."
As for the chances of the proposal,
Cuthbertson sees no quick and simple
solution forthcoming because the mat
ter would spend considerable time in
committees.

move.
Hoover Pavilion is located on land
adjoining Palo Alto-Stanford Hospital
between Palm Drive and Stanford

Shopping Center. The facility is cur
rently used only for bedding down
patients.
Stanford's Board of Trustees has
agreed, in the terms of the offer,
to sell the City enough of the univer
sity-owned land surrounding Hoover
Pavilion to make such expansion pos
sible.
Separation
Otherwise, Stanford will proceed
with plans for expansion of its own
facility, designed as an "independent
unit, both administratively and func
tionally."
However, Sterling made it clear
that no changes in the basic structure
of the working agreement governing
the hospital would be made "until ad
ditional beds are available in the com
munity."
Under the present arrangement,
one wing of the three-wing hospital is
used by Palo Alto physicians, a second
by Stanford Medical School, and the
third houses offices and equipment.
No Agreement in Sight
Kenneth Cuthbertson, University
Vice President in charge of Finance,
described the proposed acquisition as
necessary "for the good of the medi
cal school. The University must have
full control of its facilities."
As for the chances of the proposal,
Cuthbertson sees no quick and simple
solution forthcoming because the mat
ter would spend considerable time in
committees.
University officials yesterday re
ported no new action by the City of
Palo Alto regarding Stanford's offer
to buy that city's half of the jointly
owned Palo Alto-Stanford Hospital.
The matter is currently under study
by the Finance Committee of the
Palo Alto City Council. The Commit
tee's next scheduled meeting is in
three weeks.
Formal Offer
President J. E. Wallace Sterling
formalized the University's desire to
end joint ownership in a letter to Mrs.
Frances Dias, mayor of Palo Alto,
Aug. 8. Negotiations were begun last
January.
The Sterling letter placed the mar
ket value of the City's holdings at ap
proximately $5 million, "based on a
very preliminary analysis."
Several Palo Alto groups feel the
sum should be in the area of $7 mil
lion.
Palo Alto's original investment in
the facility was some $4.2 million.
The Alternatives
If the City were to sell out, it would
most likely concentrate on the ex
pansion of Hoover Pavilion to handle
hospital needs. Preliminary studies
have stressed the feasibility of this
move.
