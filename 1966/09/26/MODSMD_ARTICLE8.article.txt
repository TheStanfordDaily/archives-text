# 'THE CHAPEL IS EVERYBODY'S'
## Yale's Napier Appointed Dean Of Chapel 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL 
Religion is coming on campus this
fall and leading the forces into the
Promised Land is B. Davie Papier,
Old Testament scholar and newly-ap
pointed Dean of the Chapel.
Napier comes her? from Yale where
he was a faculty master and profes
sor in the divinity school. He will be
in charge of Memorial Church and all
non-academic religious programs and
activities.
His responsibilities are considerably
greater than they would have been a
year ago because of a number of im
portant changes in religious policy
made last year.
Trustees Decision
Primary among these was the deci
sion of the Board of Trustees last Feb
ruary to allow sectarian worship ser
vices to be held on campus. (Previous
ly, a clause in the Founding Grant of
the University had been interpreted to

prohibit all worship services on cam
pus except the "non-sectarian" ser
vices in Memorial Church.)
The Trustee decision followed sev
eral years of efforts by students, min
isters, and faculty to get the worship
policy changed. Among the reasons
given for recommending the change
was that forcing students to worship
off campus was to force them to make
the central witness to their faith in a
community with which they did not
identify. It created a fragmentation
between a person's religious commit
ment and the university environment
in which he lives.
Expanded Services
Napier is planning a vastly expand
ed number of worship services, and he
is also concerned with working to al
leviate what he feels is the most con
spicuous problem at Stanford: the
lack of wholeness in a person's life.
The philosophy of worship services,

as well as the number, is being
changed by Napier. Both Napier and
his assistant, Gordon Verplank, be
lieve that there is no such thing as a
"non-sectarian" service. Worship,
therefore, will be conducted according
to various traditions and even new
forms. But the emphasis will be not
on the liturgy's being from a certain
sect but that it is a worship oppor
tunity for the whole campus conduct
ed in a certain tradition.
Thus, for example, the Sunday ser
vice at 5 p.m. will be "according to the
Roman Catholic liturgy; Tuesday
noon according to the book of Com
mon Prayer." In addition to the Ro
man rite service Sunday afternoon
and the weekday services according
to various Protestant traditions, the
all-university worship service will
continue to be held at 11 a.m.
Outstanding Reputation
Napier was brought to Stanford

largely on the basis of his outstand
ing reputation as a university preach
er and he expects to do most of the
preaching himself. This practice will
replace the old system which Napier
characterizes as "a series of visiting
firemen."
The important thing about the ex
pansion of worship opportunities to
Napier is that "the Chapel is every
body's." It will get far more use than
in the past. "The only requirements
for its use," he says, "are that it be
used for a legitimate purpose and that
the services be open to the public."
He is presently proceeding with
plans to convert the east transcept of
the Church into a chapel which will
seat 150-180. It will be furnished with
church chairs and will have a small
permanent altar. The area already has
its own lighting and heating, so that
the only other change planned is to
