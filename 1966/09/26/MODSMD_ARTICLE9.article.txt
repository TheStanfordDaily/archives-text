# NEW THIS YEAR
## One Less Sr. Colloq; Pass-Fail Grading 
### 
Reduced Senior Colloquim require
ments and "pass-fail" grades are two
major changes that go into effect this
quarter.
In its June meeting last spring, the
Academic Council dropped the num
ber of Senior Colloquia required for
graduation from two to one. Accord
ing to Dr. Harvey Hall, registrar, B.S.
candidates will be permitted to enroll
on the same priority basis as B.A.
candidates.
Under the new grading system, each

student is permitted to elect courses
to be graded "pass or fail" instead of
under the conventional A-F scale. A
maximum of twenty-seven units may
be taken pass-fail in a student's four
undergraduate years.
Courses Restricted
Courses taken in a student's major
department and General Studies re
quirements may not be taken pass
fail, and a student is limited to only
one pass-fail course a quarter.

"The decision to elect the pass-fail
option should be set at the time of en
rollment in the course," said Hall. "A
student might change his option, how
ever, within the time set for dropping
or adding a course."
Hall noted that an instructor might
close his course to students choosing
the pass-fail option.
The criteria for a "pass" will nor
mally be the same as those for earn
ing a D or higher in the course.
Transcripts will note whether a stu

dent passed or failed a course, and
hours successfully completed will
count as credits for graduation.
Not For GPA
"Hours graded pass or fail," Hall
said, "will not be included in computa
tion of a student's grade point aver
age."
The grading system is a three-year
experiment that will be reviewed by
the Committee on Undergraduate Ed
ucation at the end of the third year.
Abolition of activity credits has
been recommended by the General
Studies Committee in addition to the
Senior Colloquia change. The Academ
ic Council will reportedly review the
activity credit revision sometime this
year.
When Stanford opened 75 years ago,
the entire University operated under
a system virtually without grades.
Under the initial system, students'
work was evaluated by four adjec
tives: excellent, passed, conditional
and failed.
Burdensome Chore
According to some historical stud
ies, the faculty believed students
"should not work for marks." Profes
sors also thought it a burdensome
chore to discriminate among students
of comparable ability.
The registrar, however, found the
system inefficient, and in 1903 the
Academic Council conceded that con
ventional A, B, C, D, and F marks
might be used on records.
Five years later—again faced with
administrative pressures—the Council
agreed that the letter grades could be
sent on transcripts to other universi
ties and that the students could see
the grades. By 1911, student report
cards were also based on letters.
Other schools across the country
have been experimenting with grade
system, too. Cal Tech has abolished
grades in the freshman year, and
Princeton adopted a modified pass-fail
system last spring.
Pomona presently pertnits students
to take a total of four courses on a
pass-fail basis during their junior and
senior years.
