# Computers Will Work As Tireless Tutors
## Revolution 
### 
In a few more years, millions of
school children will have access to the
personal services of a tutor as well
informed and responsive as Aristotle,
Prof. Patrick Suppes of Stanford pre
dicts in the current (September, 19G6)
issue of Scientific American maga
zine.
Computer-assisted instruction offers
"truly revolutionary" changes and im
piovements in education, which are
rapidly being realized, he indicates.
Director of the Stanford Institute of
Mathematical Studies in the Social
Sciences, Prof. Suppes is one of the
developers of the nation's first com
puterized classrooms, which opened
this month at Brentwood School in
Last Palo Alto.
Hlghtly Individualized
Highly individualized programs are
"the single most powerful argument"
favoring computer-assisted instruction
(CAI), he declares.
The principal bottleneck now is "not
t. chnological but pedagogical—how to
devise way\s of individualizing instruc
tion and designing a curriculum . . .
suited to individuals instead of
groups."
Computers can help crack this prob
lem by providing daily information on
how students perform in each seg
ment of the curriculum as it is pre
sented—evaluating not only individ
ual pages of a workbook, for example,
but also individual exercises.
The resulting improvements will
benefit not only those directly in

volved in CAI but millions who use
conventional textbooks.
Dialogue Systems
Prof. Suppes describes three kinds
of CAI: drills-and-practice systems,
tutorial systems, and "dialogue sys
tems."
Preliminary analysist of improve
ment in mathematical skills and con
cepts using CAI drill-and-practice ses
sions "look impressive," he reports.
In one six-day drill on fourth-grade
arithmetic, covering 48 different con
cepts, the per cent of correct answers
doubled while response time for the
entire exercise was halved from 10 to
five minutes.
Technically, he notes, after provid
ing cathode raytube display screens
and keyboards for communication
with computers, appropriate sound
devices are important for CAI,
Ears and Eyes
"Children, especially the younger
ones, learn at least as much by ear
as they do by eye," he comments.
"The effectiveness of the spoken word
is probably stronger than any visual
stimulus, not only for children, but
also most of the time for adults.
"It is particularly significant that
elementary school children, whose
reading skills are comparatively unde
veloped, comprehend rather compli
cated spoken messages."
Well structured subjects such as
reading and mathematics "can be
easily handled by tutorial systems,"
where "the aim is to take over from
the classroom teacher the main re

sponsibility for instruction," he adds.
"(These) are the subjects we best
understand how to teach, and we
should be able to use computer con
trolled tutorial systems to carry the
main load of teaching (them)."
Teacher Call
"It should be emphasized, however,
that no tutorial program designed in
the near future will be able to handle
every kind of problem that arises in
student learning."
Stanford's CAI programs have a
"teacher call" for use when a student
has been through all branches of a
concept and still does not fully under
stand it. In these cases, the computer
advises teachers proctoring the class
room who needs their personalized
attention.
"It is important to keep the (cul
turally) deprived child from develop
ing a sense of failure or defeat at the
start of his schooling," Suppes writes.
"Tutorial 'branches' must be provided
that move downward to very simple
presentations, just as a good tutor will
use an increasingly simplified ap
proach when he realizes his pupil fails
to understand what is being said. . . .
Stiff Criterion
"We have found it best that each
pupil progress from one concept in
the curriculum to another only after
he passes a reasonably stiff criterion
of performance.
"The rate at which the bright ebii
dren advance may be five to ten times
faster than that of the slowest."
At the third and deepest level of

student-computer relations, "dialog,"
two major problems emerge—1) get
ting computers to understand the
meaning of a sentence, and 2) de
veloping ways for computers to rec
ognize the spoken words of children.
"A child in first grade will prob
ably not be able to type even a sim
ple question, but he can voice quite
complex ones," Suppes explains.
Central Problem
The central technological problem
facing CAI is the reliability of the
computers involved, he declares.
"Computer systems in education must
work with a much higher degree of
reliability than is expected in com
puter centers, where the users are
sophisticated scientists, or even in
factory-control systems, where the
users are experienced engineers.
"If . . . young people are put at com
puter terminals for sustained periods
and the program and the machines do
not perform as they should, the result
is chaos."
Behavioral problems encountered
at CAI include how to organize the
curriculum, when and how to correct
student errors and encourage dis
covery of correct answers, what time
to allow for review, etc.
"Those of us who are faced with
making these decisions are aware of
the inadequacy of our knowledge,"
Suppes says."The power of the com
puter to assemble and provide data as
a basis for decisions will perhaps be
the most powerful imputus to educa
tional theory yet to appear."


Pour students at the Brentwood Ele
mentary School in East Palo Alto
learn to use the tools of an educa
tional revolution. Seated at individual
terminals, they are learning to read
with the assistance of a computer.
