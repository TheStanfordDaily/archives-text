# FEW HIGH POINTS
## Indians' Statistics Decline 
### 
Last week's fiasco in Minne
sota dropped Stanford to dismal
depths in the AAWU's compara
tive statistics. UCLA and USC
dominate the team standings.
Individually, however, Stan
ford boasts a few bright spots.
Gene Washington leads the
AAWU in total offense, and
Dave Lewis holds the top spot
among the league's punters.
The most painful statistic of
the week was Stanford's rushing
defense. The Tribe has allowed
an average of 184 yards a game
in its first two encounters, plac
ing it dead last in the Pacific
Eight. First place UCLA has
given up only 75 a game.
Stanford now stands only one
step above last in total defense.
The offensive statistics are
slightly more encouraging. Stan
ford places fourth in total de
fense with a 315 yard average.
Stanford's passing attack has
netted the Tribe a third ranking
offense, although the Stanford
percentage is a not-so-hot .383.

Washington Leads Offense
Gene Washington, with 262
yards passing and 134 rushing
has netted 396 yards total of
fense. UCLA's Gary Beban rests
uneasily in second place with
365.
Dave Lewis has lost none of
his league-leading form from the
last two years, punting 44.4
yards a shot. Stanford did not
make it to a fourth down punt
ing situation often last week
end, and Lewis has kicked only
5 times this year.
Jack Root's 79 yards rushing
at Minnesota boosted his total to
159, fourth in the league.
UCLA's Mel Farr leads the
AAWU groundgainers with 165
yards.
Washington's 134 total places
his fifth among the conference
rushers. He ranks fourth in
passing.
Bob Conrad's nine receptions
for 147 yards place the Stanford
end in fourth place. WSU's

Flansburg tops the list with 209
yards on 17 receptions.

Dave Lewis has lost none of
his league-leading form from the
last two years, punting 44.4
yards a shot. Stanford did not
make it to a fourth down punt
ing situation often last week
end, and Lewis has kicked only
5 times this year.
Jack Root's 79 yards rushing
at Minnesota boosted his total to
159, fourth in the league.
UCLA's Mel Farr leads the
AAWU groundgainers with 165
yards.
Washington's 134 total places
his fifth among the conference
rushers. He ranks fourth in
passing.
Bob Conrad's nine receptions
for 147 yards place the Stanford
end in fourth place. WSU's

Flansburg tops the list with 209
yards on 17 receptions.

Last week's fiasco in Minne
sota dropped Stanford to dismal
depths in the AAWU's compara
tive statistics. UCLA and USC
dominate the team standings.
Individually, however, Stan
ford boasts a few bright spots.
Gene Washington leads the
AAWU in total offense, and
Dave Lewis holds the top spot
among the league's punters.
The most painful statistic of
the week was Stanford's rushing
defense. The Tribe has allowed
an average of 184 yards a game
in its first two encounters, plac
ing it dead last in the Pacific
Eight. First place UCLA has
given up only 75 a game.
Stanford now stands only one
step above last in total defense.
The offensive statistics are
slightly more encouraging. Stan
ford places fourth in total de
fense with a 315 yard average.
Stanford's passing attack has
netted the Tribe a third ranking
offense, although the Stanford
percentage is a not-so-hot .383.

Washington Leads Offense
Gene Washington, with 262
yards passing and 134 rushing
has netted 396 yards total of
fense. UCLA's Gary Beban rests
uneasily in second place with
365.

Last week's fiasco in Minne
sota dropped Stanford to dismal
depths in the AAWU's compara
tive statistics. UCLA and USC
dominate the team standings.
Individually, however, Stan
ford boasts a few bright spots.
Gene Washington leads the
AAWU in total offense, and
Dave Lewis holds the top spot
among the league's punters.
The most painful statistic of
the week was Stanford's rushing
defense. The Tribe has allowed
an average of 184 yards a game
in its first two encounters, plac
ing it dead last in the Pacific
Eight. First place UCLA has
given up only 75 a game.
Stanford now stands only one
step above last in total defense.
The offensive statistics are
slightly more encouraging. Stan
ford places fourth in total de
fense with a 315 yard average.
Stanford's passing attack has
netted the Tribe a third ranking
offense, although the Stanford
percentage is a not-so-hot .383.

Washington Leads Offense
Gene Washington, with 262
yards passing and 134 rushing
has netted 396 yards total of
fense. UCLA's Gary Beban rests
uneasily in second place with
365.
Dave Lewis has lost none of
his league-leading form from the
last two years, punting 44.4
yards a shot. Stanford did not
make it to a fourth down punt
ing situation often last week
end, and Lewis has kicked only
5 times this year.
Jack Root's 79 yards rushing
at Minnesota boosted his total to
159, fourth in the league.
UCLA's Mel Farr leads the
AAWU groundgainers with 165
yards.
Washington's 134 total places
his fifth among the conference
rushers. He ranks fourth in
passing.
Bob Conrad's nine receptions
for 147 yards place the Stanford
end in fourth place. WSU's

Flansburg tops the list with 209
yards on 17 receptions.
