# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## NEW ANGLES 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
You have to hand it to the
Planning Office. When it solves
a problem it doesn't go half
way.
Take the Stern Hall parking
lot for instance.
The problem was simple:
there was not enough parking
space for all the cars belonging
to Stern residents. Now more
mundane minds (like mine)
would conclude that more park

ing space would be the answer.
Not the Planning Office. In a fit
of ingenuity they found that by
substituting straight-in for the
old slant-in lines they could gain
more parking spaces. Would
you believe 60 brand-new
spaces? Another smashing suc
cess.
Smashing is right. The spaces
are shorter, the entrance lanes
are narrower, and everything is
crowded. If you have anything
larger than a VW you'll need a
pilot's license just to park your
car. And if you've had a beer or
two you'll need a co-pilot and
Godspeed. Those with cars long
er than 12' would be well-ad
vised to review their insurance
policies.
I complained about the park
ing last year (just after my car
was anonymously dented)â€”and
look what I get. I'm afraid if I
complain again I'll have to trade
my MGB in on a motorcycle!
What irks me most is that the
Planning Office probably thinks
it has actually solved the 'Stern
parking problem.' You have to
be pretty clever to pull 60 spaces
out of thin air. I just hope the
Planners don't suffer the illu
sion that Stern residents will
benefit from their handiwork.
The real beneficiaries are the
body shops over on Alma.
