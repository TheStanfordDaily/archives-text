# PASS-FAIL
## 
### 
Although the University's grading system has
remained consistent over the past thirty years,
Stanford's history has seen the rise and fall of
graded and ungraded systems, and most of the
nuances in between the two.
Increased academic pressure and the rising
caliber of students caused the Academic Council
to examine grading methods in 1961-62. While
the Council's actions, changing the designation
of letter grades, carried greater significance on
paper than in fact, the attitude of the faculty re
flected the changing needs of undergraduate
education.
This year in a more concrete manner the Aca
demic Council has faced the problems of in
creased academic competition with the intro
duction of the pass-fail option. Under a proposal
adopted last June, undergraduates may take up
to twenty-seven units of ungraded work outside
General Studies and their major field.
While a student may take only one ungraded
course per quarter, such courses provide new
found freedom for exploring areas of individual
interest with less emphasis on the required ma
terial. "Education is something that takes place
in your mind, (while) things outside of that
serve only as stimuli," Mr. Harris recently told
the freshman class. The pass-fail option clearly

does shift the burden of education to the stu
dent. Faculty and students have long realized
that grades are not always the measure of all a
student derives from a course. In an ungraded
course, the mastery of academic gamesmanship
will pay no dividends: the individual, rather
than his grade, will measure progress.
Although we believe that it is both unrealistic
and impractical to adopt a complete pass-fail
system, there are additional opportunities for re
ducing academic pressure while allowing the
student greater responsibility for his education.
Introductory language and mathematics courses
are two areas in which emphasis might be placed
of gaining a working knowledge for use in fur
ther study rather than on immediate technical
proficiency.
Pass-fail courses would ease much of the
pressure on students not accustomed to Stan
ford's audio-langual methods and brisk calculus
series. Yet no lessening in the quality of teaching
nor in the quality of student performance need
result.
The pass-fail experiment will add intellectual
excitement to the often staid undergraduate cur
riculum. However, the final judge of the experi
ment's value must be its benefactors, the stu
dents.
