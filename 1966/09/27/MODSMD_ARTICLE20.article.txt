## Beatles And The Bible: Their Rise And Fall? 
### William F. Buckley, Jr 
Mr. John Lennon, 0.8. E., the
concert master of the Beatles,
got himself and his cartel into
very serious difficulty which, in
economed terms, only re-affirm
ed the international pessimism
about the fate of the British
pound. Scores upon scores of
radio stations, and dozens upon
dozens of disc jockeys, declared
at least a temporary embargo
on the Beatles. Mr. Lennon's of
fense said that "the Beatles are
more popular than Jesus."
The reaction appeared to be
based on the assumption that
Mr. Lennon had been comparing
not the relative popularity of
himself and Jesus, but their re
lated virtues. And this was of
course to miscomprehend what
Mr. Lennon said which was cer
tainly untactful, and indubitably
accurate.
There are, one supposes, a
few—Christians?—who clamor
for the crucifixion, mutatis mu
tandis, of the Beatles; but they
are a minority. I myself ven
tured two years ago in this space
to write critically of—not the
Beatles, but the Beatles' "mu
sic"; and received a hundred
times as many letters in pro
test as I ever received before or
since. More numerous, by far,
one infers from Holy Writ, than
the protests addressed two thou
sand years ago to the execu
tioners of Our Blessed Lord.
Coarse Truth
Mr. Lennon's rather coarse
ejaculation was to be sure the
plain truth, hardly shocking to
students of the Bible, who know
the relative attractions of mam
mon over God. Secular deities
always have it over just plain
Deity, and one would think that
inasmuch as the Bible confronts

this commonplace with some
fortitude, so might the disc
jockeys even in the Bible belt.
The question of taste arises.
Mr. Lennon's comparison of the
divine and the profane suggest
ed a certain self-elevation. It
was this public shock that un
questionably drove the Beatles
into a prolonged conference with
their public relations experts,
from whose deliberations
emerged Mr. Lennon's dumb
founding exegesis of what-it
was-he-actually-meant.
Comparison With Christ
At a press conference in Chi
cago he explained to the press
of course he had not of course
intended of course to compare
himself with Christ. He had
merely ventured an historical
truism. And then he added: "Of
course, it is true that Chris
tianity is on the wane." Now
this ,it appeans to me, was, un
elaborated, gratuitous even more
than the original observation. It
is true that Christianity is on
the wane.
It is also true that the world
is on the wane. And if Mr. Len
non ventures to project an ob
servation in which both he and
Christ are involved, into another
observation in which they are
still both involved,to the dam
age of the latter rather than the
former, it is only fair game to
speculate on whether the decline
of the one might not somehow
or other be related to the ad
vancement of the other.
That is to say ,the Beatles,
who have more lavishly nourish
ed their flock than ever the pro
fiteers of Lourdes nourished the
pilgrims to that sacred shrine,
are .however inadvertently, self

anointed substitutes for rather
more meaningful objects of
adulation.
The Beatles do not, let us re
call, peddle merely their rec
ords. They sit still for columns,
articles, magazines, books, en
cyclopedias, which prey on the
reserves of veneration in young
people, which in healthier ages
would be directed at objects
more venerable than the Beatles.
After rny last foray in sacrilege,
I engaged in a correspondence
with a young lady who finally
sent me after a half dozen let
ters and an amorous epistolary
reconciliation, a registered letter
at Christmas.
It contained a square inch, her
affectionate note breathlessly
advised me, of a bed sheet upon
which one of the Beatles had
slept in San Francisco while
there to commit non-music; and
it was exactly one-half of her
most treasured possession,
which she had secured at a
semi-public auction conducted
no doubt by an enterprising pub
lican at a local hotel. Of course,
I acknowledged the gift with
profuse exclamations of grati
tude, and indeed bartered it to
seduce the eternal servility of a
beloved 10 year-old niece.
But it is, I judge, not alto
gether stuffy to observe that
someone who remarks on the
diminution of Christianity ought
probably to go on to evaluate
the suitability of some of Chris
tianity's successors to fill the
void. No doubt poor Mr. Lennon
wishes at this point that he had
never opened his mouth except
to emit music, or rather non
music; but now that he had
done so, one can only ask for
more more more.
