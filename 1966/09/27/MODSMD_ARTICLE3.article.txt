construction and outfiting of the 109,-
000 sq. ft. structure.
The three largest contributions to
the project which began last Pall,
were $1 million from the family of
the late William P. Roth, $1 million
from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation,
and $1,330,000 from the U.S. Dept. of
Health, Education and Welfare.
The new Business School three ma
jor compoents are the William P.
Roth Center for Advanced Manage
ment, the Alfred P. Sloan Center for
Management Education, and the J.
Hugh Jackson Library. Included in
these three are 11 classrooms, with a

combined capacity of 813; an auditor
ium, seating 347 ; 65 Ph.D. study car
rels to accommodate 100 students; 3
faculty conference rooms; 10 seminar
rooms; and 10 student conference
rooms for case discussion.
Soaring Costs
Operating expenses for the business
program have risen nearly 500 per
cent since 1958, last year topping $3.4
million. Causing this jump was a
doubling in enrollment during this
same period from 400 to 725 includ
ing 120 international programs.


Students conduct a preliminary in
spection of the recently completed
quarters of the Graduate School of
Business. The $5.5 million structure
was begun last Fall. Dedication cere
monies are scheduled for Oct. 7.
