# Academic Council Urges End To Standing Reports
## 
### JAMES BRISCOE Associate Editor 
Dr. Wallace Sterling will deliver p
report on the University's efforts
to bring about an alteration of pres
ent Selective Service procedures at
Friday's meeting of the Academic
Council, it was learned yesterday.
The Academic Council, at its June
10 meeting, adopted a resolution urg
ing that the selective service "should
not call upon universities for indices
of academic performance," and ask
ing that the President seek to coop

eration of other universities in taking
"multilateral action" to alter this pro
cedure.
Lyle Nelson, Director of University
Relations, said that no universities
were asked to participate in the House
Armed Forces Committee hearings on
the draft. However, Kingman Brew
ster, President of Yale, has been
named to the President's special ad
visory board on the draft, and Stan
ford will register its feelings on the
matter through him, Nelson added.
The Academic Council also recom

mended that the University continue
to notify local draft boards of a stu
dent's academic standing if the stu
dent so requests, and also continue
to provide facilities for the adminis
tration of the Selective Service Col
lege Qualification Test.
Student Sit-in
Last Spring, a group of students
"sat in" President Sterling's office to
protest the use of University facilities
for the test.
The Council urged that the National
Service Office provide all relevant in
formation to draft-eligible students,
including information as to the 6tatus
of conscientious objection.
Service Office advisor, Walter Fin
deisen reports Professor Paul Seaver
of the History Dept. is acting as ad
visor for prospective CO's.
Reflecting the concern of many
students that they are being given no
voice in determining a policy which
primarily affects them, the Academic
Council adopted a "sense of the Coun
cil" resolution that student views if
expressed through the ASSU, should
be accorded substantial weight in
shaping University practices," includ
ing those concerning the draft.
Council Resolution
The Council also took up the ques
tion of classified contracts at their
June meeting, and adopted a resolu
tion that Faculty members under
taking classified projects have an "af
firmative obligation":
• "To exercise their best judgment
as to whether classification is justi
fied,"
• "to attempt to persuade the po
tential contracting agency not to in
sist upon classification when it ap
pears unjustified,"
• "to refuse to enter into contracts
involving classification when they
view the government's action insist
ing on classification as unreasonable."
A Committee on Research Policy
was set up to further review the pres
ent policy. It will report its findings
to the Academic Council by January
1.

not call upon universities for indices
of academic performance," and ask
ing that the President seek to coop

eration of other universities in taking
"multilateral action" to alter this pro
cedure.
Lyle Nelson, Director of University
Relations, said that no universities
were asked to participate in the House
Armed Forces Committee hearings on
the draft. However, Kingman Brew
ster, President of Yale, has been
named to the President's special ad
visory board on the draft, and Stan
ford will register its feelings on the
matter through him, Nelson added.
The Academic Council also recom

mended that the University continue
to notify local draft boards of a stu
dent's academic standing if the stu
dent so requests, and also continue
to provide facilities for the adminis
tration of the Selective Service Col
lege Qualification Test.
Student Sit-in
Last Spring, a group of students
"sat in" President Sterling's office to
protest the use of University facilities
for the test.
The Council urged that the National
Service Office provide all relevant in
formation to draft-eligible students,
including information as to the 6tatus
of conscientious objection.
Service Office advisor, Walter Fin
deisen reports Professor Paul Seaver
of the History Dept. is acting as ad
visor for prospective CO's.
Reflecting the concern of many
students that they are being given no
voice in determining a policy which
primarily affects them, the Academic
Council adopted a "sense of the Coun
cil" resolution that student views if
expressed through the ASSU, should
be accorded substantial weight in
shaping University practices," includ
ing those concerning the draft.
Council Resolution
The Council also took up the ques
tion of classified contracts at their
June meeting, and adopted a resolu
tion that Faculty members under
taking classified projects have an "af
firmative obligation":
• "To exercise their best judgment
as to whether classification is justi
fied,"
• "to attempt to persuade the po
tential contracting agency not to in
sist upon classification when it ap
pears unjustified,"
• "to refuse to enter into contracts
involving classification when they
view the government's action insist
ing on classification as unreasonable."
A Committee on Research Policy
was set up to further review the pres
ent policy. It will report its findings
to the Academic Council by January
1.
Dr. Wallace Sterling will deliver p
report on the University's efforts
