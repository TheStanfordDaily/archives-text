# Harris Wants Institutions To Stress Education, Not Degree
## 
### 
Speaking before a jam-packed audi
ence of freshmen in Branner Hall last
night, Student Body President Dave
Harris said that, ideally, a university
should be a four-year leave of absence
from society. Unfortunately, he added,
Stanford is not very different from
society and does not fulfill this ideal.
Along with Wendy Weiner, Paul
Rupert, and Judy Bader, Harris was
on a student panel discussing "Edu
cation at Stanford."
Controversy
The freshmen were most interested
in obtaining specific commitments
from Harris in certain controversial
areas. When asked when he would
abolish fraternities, Harris replied
that he only favored the creation of
an atmosphere of complete re-evalua
tion, rather than immediate dissolu
tion of the existing institutions.
The present problem with them, he
said, was that "they limit people's
potentialities, rather than further
them." "They are small worlds func
tioning around pre-established ideas,"
he added.
Harris emphasized the difference be

tween coming to a university for a
degree or an education. "Getting a de
gree is strictly a business proposi
tion," he said. "It has nothing to do
with education."
Business Proposition
Following this argument, he added
that general studies and major re
quirements were only part of the
mechanics of the "business proposi
tion" and were only barriers to a
broad education.
Rupert, a sponsor, was asked about
Harris's claim to knowing more about
education than President Sterling.
He said that this was probably
not' true, but that he was in a better
position to recognize a bad course
and that, in this sense, he knew as
much about education as anyone. "I
feel a personal commitment to com
plain against a bad course," he em
phasized.
Harris concluded by stating his ob
jections to grading. "Grades make
education an external realization in
stead of an internal one," he said.
"They are excuses for limiting
thought and are solely based on fear."
