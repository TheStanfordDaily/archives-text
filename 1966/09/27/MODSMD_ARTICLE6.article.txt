# Smith: 'Bright Idealism Sours'
## 
### 
The bright idealism of college stu
dent activists has begun to sour, a
Stanford expert feels.
Associate Dean of Students Joel P.
Smith, a Marshall scholar highly re
garded by many student leaders on
his home campus, believes the trend is
nation-wide in scope.
"The wonderful, thrilling idealism
that has predominated on many cam
puses is beginning to curdle in im
portant ways," he says.
Smith cites four reasons for this
new trend:
National leadership: "You simply
can't exaggerate the impact of Presi
dent Kennedy's assassination on the
young idealists now in college. Presi
dent Johnson, for all his abilities, sim
ply does not appeal to activists. They
resent him."
Vietnam: "Most activists find the
war ultimately obnoxious."
Civil rights: "Students feel they're
being elbowed out of the movement,"
both by the massive intervention of
new federal programs and by the rise
of "black power."
Economic aflluence: "Activists see
American society as disproportionate
ly preoccupied with economic success.
They see a working relationship be
tween higher education and 'the good
life,' as defined by society. They re
sent the notion that the reason to go
to coLlege is to make more money."

These four factors coalesce, he be
lieves, leading some students to act
out their concerns in personally irre
sponsible ways.
These include increased consump
tion of drugs, sexual promiscuity, and
impulsive acts against the draft.
Smith distinguishes sharply be
tween those students who use every
legitimate means of protesting Ameri
can involvement in Vietnam and seri
ously think about becoming consci
entious objectors, and those who
simply walk into their local draft
board and tear up their card in a fit of
rage.
He considers it ironic that some of
the same students who criticize the
economic preoccupations of society
withdraw into drugs and a private
emotional world devoid of social con
cern.
Indignation
"There is a wallowing indignation
that just isn't productive at all," he
observes. "Students are taking a per
sonal edlight in disaffaction. They find
comraderie in this attitude."
To retreat into a private, sensual
world "is really just another kind of
selfishness," he adds.
"It is extremely selfish to be so
alienated from the rest of society that
you make no contribution to it a all."
Increasingly frustrated in some of
their attempts at social reform at

the national level, student activists
are particularly incensed when "col
leges and universities refuse to accept
their good faith in trying to make sug
gestions for educational change,"
Smith comments.
Sensible C hanges
"Administrators have got to under
stand that these people really have
something to say and hear them out,
not in the usual condescending way
hut with a clear intent to pay atten
-tion and make changes that are sen
sible."
Smith does not dismiss activists as
an insignificant minority of today's
students. He feels their appeal is
much broader than their numbers,
and their concerns are relevant to
modern society.
His major reservation is that "in
their drive to redress social inequities,
the activists may try to push the uni
versities as institutions into positions
where they are no longer disinterest
ed and objective."
Among those deeply disturbed by
Vietnam and civil rights, "it is pre
cisely this objectivity which annoys
and provokes students," he concludes.
Trained as an attorney, Smith has
been actively involved with Stan
ford student groups for a year. His
views were outlined in talks with
Peace Corps recruiters in Washington
and in a campus nows interview.

Smith does not dismiss activists as
an insignificant minority of today's
students. He feels their appeal is
much broader than their numbers,
and their concerns are relevant to
modern society.
His major reservation is that "in
their drive to redress social inequities,
the activists may try to push the uni
versities as institutions into positions
where they are no longer disinterest
ed and objective."
Among those deeply disturbed by
Vietnam and civil rights, "it is pre
cisely this objectivity which annoys
and provokes students," he concludes.
Trained as an attorney, Smith has
been actively involved with Stan
ford student groups for a year. His
views were outlined in talks with
Peace Corps recruiters in Washington
and in a campus nows interview.
The bright idealism of college stu
dent activists has begun to sour, a
Stanford expert feels.
Associate Dean of Students Joel P.
Smith, a Marshall scholar highly re
garded by many student leaders on
his home campus, believes the trend is
nation-wide in scope.
"The wonderful, thrilling idealism
that has predominated on many cam
puses is beginning to curdle in im
portant ways," he says.
Smith cites four reasons for this
new trend:
National leadership: "You simply
can't exaggerate the impact of Presi
dent Kennedy's assassination on the
young idealists now in college. Presi
dent Johnson, for all his abilities, sim
ply does not appeal to activists. They
resent him."
Vietnam: "Most activists find the
war ultimately obnoxious."
Civil rights: "Students feel they're
being elbowed out of the movement,"
both by the massive intervention of
new federal programs and by the rise
of "black power."
Economic aflluence: "Activists see
American society as disproportionate
ly preoccupied with economic success.
They see a working relationship be
tween higher education and 'the good
life,' as defined by society. They re
sent the notion that the reason to go
to coLlege is to make more money."

These four factors coalesce, he be
lieves, leading some students to act
out their concerns in personally irre
sponsible ways.
These include increased consump
tion of drugs, sexual promiscuity, and
impulsive acts against the draft.
Smith distinguishes sharply be
tween those students who use every
legitimate means of protesting Ameri
can involvement in Vietnam and seri
ously think about becoming consci
entious objectors, and those who
simply walk into their local draft
board and tear up their card in a fit of
rage.
He considers it ironic that some of
the same students who criticize the
economic preoccupations of society
withdraw into drugs and a private
emotional world devoid of social con
cern.
Indignation
"There is a wallowing indignation
that just isn't productive at all," he
observes. "Students are taking a per
sonal edlight in disaffaction. They find
comraderie in this attitude."
To retreat into a private, sensual
world "is really just another kind of
selfishness," he adds.
"It is extremely selfish to be so
alienated from the rest of society that
you make no contribution to it a all."
Increasingly frustrated in some of
their attempts at social reform at

the national level, student activists
are particularly incensed when "col
leges and universities refuse to accept
their good faith in trying to make sug
gestions for educational change,"
Smith comments.
Sensible C hanges
"Administrators have got to under
stand that these people really have
something to say and hear them out,
not in the usual condescending way
hut with a clear intent to pay atten
-tion and make changes that are sen
sible."
