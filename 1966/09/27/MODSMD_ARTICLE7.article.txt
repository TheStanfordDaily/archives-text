# 1-A Greeting
## 
### 
"Great numbers" of students have
returned to campus this week to find
1-A greetings from their local draft
boards waiting in the mailbox.
According to Walter Findeisen, head
of Stanford's National Service Office,
all Freshmen in the lower half, Sopho
mores in the lower third, and Juniors
and Seniors in the lower quarter of
their class face possible reclassifica
tion.
Scores on the controversial draft
tests given nationally last spring are
also taken into account, but these
scores "are being considered only
negatively, not possitively by many
boards," Findeisen noted. "If a stu
dent hasn't taken the tests, he is con
sidered presumptuous to protest his
reclassification," he continued, "yet,
when he has taken the tests, he is
told they are of secondary importance
in determining his status."
Selective Service Test
The test will again be administered
on campus on November 18 and 19,
and Findeisen urged all students
whose standing is in question to take
the exam.
"The most disturbing feature of the
siutation is that too many young men
have been so blase about sending in
formation to their draft boards," he
said.
