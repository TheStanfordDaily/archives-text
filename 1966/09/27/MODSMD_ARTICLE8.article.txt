# Folk-Rock Slated For Sr. Benefit
## 
### 
Stanford University seniors
will present two of the most pop
ular attractions on the current
folk-rock circuit, The Jefferson
Airplane and the Paul Butter
field Blues Band, in a benefit
concert Thursday, Oct. 6, at 8
p.m. in the Basketball Pavilion.
Tickets are on sale at Tresid
der box office. Proceeds will
be used to support the senior
class budget for the year, ac
cording to Jim Binns, senior
class president.
The Jefferson Airplane, a new
and popular combo which got
its start at a San Francisco
night club, specializes in folk
rock and has had enthusiastic
support from Jazz Critic Ralph
Gleason.
The Butterfield Blues Band,
Chicago group, specializes in
"sound and soul, where folk
blues-rock and jazz unite." The
six-piece band utilizes electronic
amplification for its "big-beat"
effect and consists of two gui
tars, harmonica, organ, bass and
drums. National recognition was
accorded the Butterfield aggre
gation during the summer of
1965, when the Newport Folk
Festival relaxed its ban against
electronic instruments to let
them appear.
The seniors also plan faculty
student seminars, a handbook
for postgraduate guidance, and a
series of career lectures with
guest speakers from a variety
of professions.
