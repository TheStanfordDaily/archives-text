# Council Plans Secret Meeting
## 
### 
A Thursday evening meeting be
tween the finance Committee of the
Palo Alto City Council and the city
representative on the Palo Alto-
Stanford Hospital Board has been
switched from a closed to an open
session.
When he announced the change,
Committee Chairman Robert Cooley
indicated that some of the board
members might not be present at the
7:30 p.m. meeting.
The committee must deal with
Stanford University's offer to buy out
the city's share of the hospital. A
"summit conference" session was held
last week between the committee
members and represntativs of all me
dical groups in Palo Alto, including
Stanford Medical School, the Palo Al
to Medical Clinic, and independent
physicians who are not affiliated with
the clinic. The independents oppose
accepting Stanford's bid of $5 million
and want the city hospital to remain
as it is.
