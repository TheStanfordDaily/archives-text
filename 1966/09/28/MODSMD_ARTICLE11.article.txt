# POLICE BEAT
## Registration—A Busy Time For SU Police 
### JOHN A. HODGES 
Registration and money, the two
top considerations of most students
this week, are also the top problems
of Stanford Police Chief Gordon R.
Davis.
Registration—in this case the tag
ging of motor vehicles to be parked
on campus has kept the police de
partment busiest. And despite a sur
prising decrease in Monday registra
tion from last year, six lines of stu
dents were kept moving at the Pa
vilion both Monday and yesterday
waiting to register cars and motor
cycles.
Over 1800 vehicles were registered
last September on the first day of
registration, as opposed to 1736 Mon
day. The department had anticipated
a slight increase.
A similar number of registrations
was expected for yesterday, but exact
figures were not available.
Tuition Fees Guarded
Thousands of students each dropped
$525 into Stanford's coffers this week,
but, according to Davis, there was
never a great accumulation of money
at the Pavilion at any time. Only suf
ficient amounts for change were kept
on hand.
The Chief, naturally hesitant to
comment on details of guarding such
large sums, said only that 1 he money
does not accumulate through the day.
and that the department provides ;i
heavy security guard.
He did have strong suggestions for

students who have not yet registered
their vehicles, however. "There is no
fee for late registration," he said, "and
we allow three extra days of grace.
But students should have parking
stickers on their cars before Mon
day." Patrolmen will begin ticketing
stickerless vehicles on that day.
Davis warned students also against
the misconception that they may wait
until they receive a citation before
they register their automobiles. "We
would like to help the student to avoid
paying a fine on top of his registra
tion fee," he said.
The regular fine for unregistered
vehicles is $2, but the Rules provide
for a fine of up to the cost of regular
registration. Occasionally a driver of
an unregistered vehicle ignores his
citations and is faced with having to
pay a $10 fine.
Parking Space Available
Jumping from strictly registration
type problems to the regular duties
of Stanford's police department, Da
vis expressed a lack of sympathy for
students who complain about "no
parking spaces."
"There were paved, off-street park
ing lots empty all last year," he said.
Davis admitted that the spaces were
"perhaps two blocks from Quad," hut
ho added that leaving home five to
ton minutes early would solve tho
problem of a sludent, faced with being
late, being forced to park illegally.
"We have a parking lot between the
Microwave Lab and Panama Street

that we couldn't fill last year" he said.
"From 50 to 100 spaces were vacant
every day, and yet we had many
problems with illegal parking only a
half block away."
"It's just impossible to put 7000
cars around the Quad," he added.
Preferenee for Commuters
Some students who live in the fac
ulty residence area have complained

about being unable to park their auto
mobiles closer to Quad. The Chief
pointed out that there are over 3000
commuting students with cars, and
that these students must be given
preference.

Only half of the Wilbur parking lot
was used last year, the chief said
"Wilbur Hall residents walked to
Quad without much trouble — why
can't anyone else? Half of the Wilbur
parking lot is open to any student
who wants to use it."
Chief Davis admitted that parking
has moved away from Quad recently.
The site of the Undergraduate Li
brary, for instance, was once used for
parking. "But for every parking space
lost to construction," he said, "two
new ones are developed in a different
location. We have actually gained in
stead of losing parking facilities!"
Campus Patrolled
Another problem that concerns the
department is theft and vandalism.
Two patrolmen on foot are assigned
to men's dormitories on night beats,
and two are assigned to the academic
complex. In addition, there are three
mobile patrol beats which cover the
campus around the clock.
"But the department can't do much
without the help of students," Davis
said. "There was a time when you
could leave windows open with valu
ables on the seat, but you can't any
more," he said.
Citing recent cases where expensive
cameras and an entire wardrobe were
stolen from parked cars, he cautioned
students to lock their automobiles.
Valuables should be hidden even if
the doors are locked, he suggested
"Why invite someone to steal?"
