• Crowd Jeers Humphrey
PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) —A crowd of about 150 chanting young
people blocked traffic and the entrance to the Sheraton Motor Inn
last night as Vice President Hubert Humphrey's car arrived from
the Portland International Airport.
Humphrey's car, however, entered the hotel parking lot from a
different entrance, and the crowd was kept away from him.
They chanted, "Stop the War, Bring the Troops Home."
Hotel employes tried to keep them back as they surged toward
the hotel, shouting "Nazis, Nazis!"
Some sat on the parking lot and on the entrance steps.
Police dragged away three carloads. One boy fell to the sidewalk,
holding his head with hands covered by blood.
• Torpedo Boats Sunk
SAIGON (AP)—U.S. Navy jets pounced on four North Vietna
mese torpedo boats in the Gulf of Tonkin yesterday. Pilots reported
sinking two and damaging the other two vessels.

intelligence experts said are feeding more North Vietnamese troops
than ever before into the jungle war in the south.
• G.E. Antitrust Suit Filed
NEW YORK (AP) —General Electric Co. was accused in a federal
court antitrust suit yesterday of fixing prices on light bulbs through
agency agreements with distributors and retailers.

opinion that the earlier cases were decided erroneously.
• Liuzzo Case Continues

against a Ku Klux Klansman yesterday without calling an FBI
undercover agent who had testified in three previous trials that he
was an eye-witness to the nightrider killing of Civil Rights worker
Viola Gregg Liuzzo.
Instead, the prosecution directed by Atty. Gen. Richmond Flowers,
v elied chiefly on the testimony of FBI agents that the bullet which
killed Mrs. Liuzzo was fired from a .38 caliber revolver identified
as one owned by the Klansman, Eugene Thomas.

at the morning hearing, complained that a quorum had not been
present when the committee acted.
