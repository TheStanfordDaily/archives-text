# Michigan Sit-In Students Lose Appeal
## 
### 
ANN ARBOR, Mich. (CPS)â€”
Six University of Michigan stu
dents who sat-in at the Ann Ar
bor draft board last fall and
were thereupon declared 1-A
have lost their final appeal.
The Presidential draft appeal
board announced last week
(Sept. 19) that the six men are
eligible for induction as a direct
result of their protest, which al
legedly violated Selective Ser
vice law. The students were pro
testing United States policy in
Viet Nam.

A restraining order will prob
ably be sought in the courts to
prevent their induction, how
ever, a spokesman for the Amer
ican Civil Liberties Union, which
is representing the students,
said later.
"We think the courts will take
the use of Selective Service Sys
tem to punish dissenters more
seriously than Gen. Hershey
does," he added. Lt. Gen. Lewis
B. Hershey is the National Di
rector of the Selective Service
System.

After the sit-in at the Ann Ar
bor draft board, thirteen Michi
gan students were reclassified.
Five won back their student de
ferments through appeals. The
cases of two others are still
pending.
Michigan Selective Service Di
rector Col. Arthur Holmes said
that the six probably would not
be drafted as long as they have
legal action pending in the
courts.
Col. Holmes was not very op

timistic about their chances,
however. "They have a right to
the suit, but I don't know what
it would be about," he said.
"The courts have never ordered
a draft board to hold up induc
tion."
But Col. Holmes contended,
"They've been given all their
rights and benefits. Somebody
has got to go into the service. I
don't feel these individuals arp
any different than anybody
else."
