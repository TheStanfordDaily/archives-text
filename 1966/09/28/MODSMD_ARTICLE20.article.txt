## Timothy Leary Creates LSD Religious Group 
### Colorado Daily Univ. of Colorado 
Dr. Tim Leary, noted pro
ponent of LSD in the home, has
founded a new religion on the
precepts that the sacramental
use of peyote, marijuana, and
LSD lead to spiritual enlight
ment.
Monikered the League for
Spiritual Discovery, Leary plans
to test the constitutional rights
section covenants within the
shrines in their homes.
Leary said that he is seek
ing a declaratory judgment to
rule "that the laws presently in
effect in respect to psychedelic
drugs be ruled not applicable
to members of this new religi
ous organization, who use them
at specific times, in designated
religious shrines."
The League now has 411
members, who manifest "no re
liance on priesthood, dogma,
stereotyped rituals or socio-poli
tical sponsorship." However, he
noted that for prospective mem

bers, "friends will initiate, teach,
prepare and guide the uninitiat
ed into a spiritual under
ground."
"Like very great religions of
the past," Leary commented,
"we seek to find the divinity
within and to express this rev
elation in a life of glorification
and worship of God."
Living with Leary in his home
at Millbrook, N.Y., is the Lea
gue's Board of Guides. These
venerables are a 15-member
body, all of whom "have resign
ed from the jobs and are dedi
cating their lives to the re
ligion." He also noted that he
expects a membership increase
of more than a million in the
next two or three years.
The league's first "public wor
ship service, a psychedelic cele
bration" will be held tonight at
the Village Theatre, in New
York. Following that, services
will be held each Tuesday eve
ning with seats costing three
dollars each. No drugs will be
administered at this time.

Prospective members will be
required to donate on their ap
plication blanks a specific room
in their house in which the
shrine would be located. He ex
plained that this would protect
them from arrest if the drugs
were taken in that predeter
mined place.
The cants of this religion
dictate that every member
would turn on with LSD every
seven days since it isn't effec
tive if taken more frequently;
however, marijuana sessions
will occur for an hour a day.
Queried on reactions to
Leary's innovations, student
Betsy Sheets said she felt that
this was an "attempt to put
back into religious dogma some
thing that shouldn't even be
there and seems to have final
ly been eradicated."
Leader of the campus group
"Where's the Spirit of '56?", Bill
Vail elucidated his opinion of
Dr. Leary as "asterisk-asterisk
asterisk-K."
