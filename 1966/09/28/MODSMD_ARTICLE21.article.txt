A group of Colorado Springs
citizens have formed a Colora
do Springs Citizens Council "to

protect state and individual
rights."
Rudy Fahl, one of the group's
organizers, said the council is
similar to those formed in Den
ver and other cities around the
country.
It's objectives are the same
as those set forward by a
group of civic leaders in Mis
sissippi following the U.S. Su
preme Court's 1954 desegrega
tion decision.
Fahl said former Mississip
pians living in Colorado Springs
have been asked to join the or
ganization.
"There hasn't been arty
trouble so far but we're organiz
ing the council before there is
any," he said.
The organizers sent a letter
and application for membership
to about 1000 area residents
which expressed concern about
"destruction of individual free
dom by the increasing erosion
of states' rights and adoption of
civil rights laws."
The letter said these "forced
integration measures will bring
government coercion into every
local community and will de
stroy property rights and free
dom of choice."
Eight questions were asked in
the letter:
• Are you positively dedicated
to the principle of social separa
tion of the races?
• Do you believe Communist
forces are behind the campaign
to force the white people of this
country to amalgamate with the
Negro race?
• Do you believe forced inte

gration and racial inbreeding
threaten the integrity of both
races and endanger Western civ
ization?
• Do you believe left-wing agi
tation groups are inciting racial
tension to cause federal inter
vention to establish a police
state under martial law?
• Do you believe in rights of
sovereign states to handle their
own internal affairs?
• Do you realize that indiffer
ence, apathy and the inclination
of some to accept collectivism
as inevitable . . . are our great
est enemies?
• Are you ready and willing
to do something positive about
this very serious and present
problem ?
• Do you believe in the princi
ple of local self government and
the strengthening of local and
state governments to protect cit
izens from federal meddling?
