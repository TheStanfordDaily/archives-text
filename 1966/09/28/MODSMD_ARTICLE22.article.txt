Some 150 residents of the low
rent married students commu
nity met Wednesday night to
voice opposition to an admini
stration project. The project to
relocate the maintenance yard
would remove 60 of the 100
apartments in Spartan City
West.
Members of the Seventh
Street community gathered to
hear their spokesman, Jim Mar
chello, and his four-man commit
tee speak out on the issue of
economical married student
housing on state college camp
uses, especially at SJS.
Marchello said, "SJS housing
director Robert Baron informed
us that buildings one through
six would be removed during
the summer of 1967. We at
tempted to talk with the college
to negotiate an alternative," he
said, "but the housing director
said it was out of his hands."
Housing Director Baron stat
ed, "there will be a big enough
turnover next year to provide
housing for returning married
students."
Marchello said he and his com
mittee then went to see Pres.
Robert Clark who, in turn, re
ferred him to Executive Dean
C. Grant Burton who heads the
Campus Planning Committee.
Marchello said, "We invited Mr.
Murphy of the housing office
(Richard Murphy, housing man
ager) and Vice President Dusel
(SJS Vice Pres. William J. Du
sel) was there. We talked with
them, and they said they would
report back to us in two weeks
with an alternative to the prob
lem. They never reported back
to us, and, when we did contact
them, they reported that they
had found no alternative."
Marchello's committee had
gathered statistics on the prob
lem of the increasing rate of
married students at SJS. "The
rate of married couples at the
college has increased from 27.3
percent in 1962, to 28.6 percent
in 1964, and even more this year.
These students, plus the incom
ing foreign students and re
