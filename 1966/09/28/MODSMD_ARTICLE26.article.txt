# Highly Rated 'Marat/Sade' Here In Coastal Premiere
## 
### 
Hailed by the New York Times
as "the most exciting theatrical
event of the 20th century," Peter
Weiss' 'Marat/Sade" ("The Per
secution and Assassination of
Jean-Paul Marat as Performed
by the Inmates of the Asylum of
Charenton under the Direction
of Marquis de Sade") will have
its West Coast premiere Tues
day, September 20, at the Circle
Star Theater in San Carlos.
The shocking, stunning show,
which won the "Best Play of
1966" award by the New York
Drama Critics, in addition to
four Tony Awards, will open

Circle Star's fall season, which
will also include "Can Can,"
with Patrice Munsel and Bob
Wright; "The Subject Was
Roses," with Maureen O'Sulli
van and Chester Morris; "How
to Succeed in Business Without
Really Trying," with Rick Nel
son and Rudy Vallee; "Gypsy,"
with Gisele MacKenzie, and
"Funny Girl," with a star yet to
be announced. All shows will
run for two weeks.
The entire action of the play
takes place in the Bath Hall of
the Asylum at Charenton in
1808. Between 1797 and 1811, the
director of the asylum, Monsieur
Coulmier, established regular
theatrical entertainments in his
clinic of the therapeutic treat
ment of his patients. Dp Sade,
an inmate of Charenton from
1803 until his death in 1814,
wrote and directed many of
these entertainments, and it be
came fashionable in Paris to

visit the asylum, as much to
watch the antics of the lunatics
as to watch the performance.
These facts are the starting
point of Peter Weiss' play,
which first opened in London
August 20, 1964, following its
German world premiere at the
Schiller Theater in Berlin in
April of that year.
The company coming to the
Circle Star consists of an all-
New York cast, directed by Ben
Janney and Nelle Nugent who
had been working with Brook,
John Devlin, last seen on Broad
way in "Poor Bitos," will play
Marat.
Performances of "Marat/Sade"
will be Tuesdays through Satur
days at 8:30; Sundays at 8 p.m.,
with matinees Saturdays and
Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets are
available at the Circle Star box
office; Macy's, Sears, Grey
