# Upward Bound Tutorial Plans To Seek Volunteers Tomorrow
## 
### SHELLEY MUSER 
The Stanford Area and Upward
Bound tutorial programs will spon
sor a general information meeting at
8:15 p.m. Thursday in Tresidder room
270 to recruit volunteers to work with
peninsula high school students.
Opportunities for volunteers in

clude tutoring, administrative work,
teacher's aide and cultural enrich
ment programs.
Sponsored by the National Student
Association, the Stanford Area Tu
torial provides help for less motivated
students at Ravenswood High School
in East Palo Alto, an unincorporated,

low-income community of 22,000
people, 45 per cent Negro, 10 per cent
Oriental, and 45 per cent white.
Tutors are driven to the school to
work with students on a one-to-one
basis. Tutoring usually involves two
one and one-half hour sessions on
either Monday and Wednesday after
noons or Tuesday and Thursday eve
nings. Schedules, however, are flex
ible and can be re-arranged between
tutor and tutee.
The Upward Bound program is de
signed to help disadvantaged stu
dents who have potential for college
or other educational training beyond
high school. In addition, UB attempts
to help students with placement and
financial assistance.
Funded by the Office of Economic
Opportunity, Upward Bound at Stan
ford stresses extra-curricular as well
as academic education and so requires
more time than the Area Tutorial.
Upward Bound receives stipends to
provide students with cultural oppor
tunities — theatre, music, museums,
"know-your community" and science
field trips, lectures and sports.
The program began work with for
ty area high school students last sum
mer and will attempt to follow
through the full-time, eight-week ses
sion with part-time academic-year tu
toring and counseling.
The Area Tutorial will continue the
work begun three years ago at Ra
venswood with improved techniques
of matching tutors with tutees, more
reference materials, and a larger
staff.
Both programs need Stanford stu
dents interested in tutoring any sub
ject — math, English, foreign lang
uages, sciences, history, geography;
artists, dancers, and musicians can be
placed, too.
Applications for both programs will
be available at the meeting. Graduate
as well as undergraduate students are
encouraged to attend.
