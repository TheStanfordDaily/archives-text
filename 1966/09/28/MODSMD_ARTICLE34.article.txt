# ATHLETES' SUMMER PARADISE
## Sports Camp Develops Young Talent 
### TOM EDISON 
Youngsters find Stanford vir
tually a paradise during the hot,
idyll ic summer months. What
other impression could they
form while playing baseball in
the massive Sunken Diamond,
swimming in one of three ad
j.. cent pools, or just staring up
at gigantic Hoover Tower.
Stanford's athletic department
for the last ten years has spon
sored a six-week coaching camp
and has employed the unique
features of Stanford to build an
immensely popular and finan
c'nlly successful institution here
at Stanford during the summer.
Under the direction of varsity
basketball coach Howie Dall
mar, sixteen coaches are in
charge of sending 200 boys from
9-14 years of age through two
weeks of concentrated athletic
d "ills. Each boy receives daily
instruction in the major sports

of basebaLl, football, and basket
ball, and divide part of their
time among other minor sports.
Varing Accomplishments
The main purpose of the camp
as stated by Chuck Taylor, Di
rector of Stanford Athletics who
originated the camp in 1956, is
to teach the youngsters "the

successful competitor â€” confi
dence in himself and in his own
abilit ios.
Of course the camp has many
other effects on the youngsters.
Howie Dallmar pointed out that
in the brief stay at the camp the
boys are probably receiving
their first introduction to college

life and by their visits to other
parts of the campus and talking
with their counselors who are
Stanford students realize the
importance of a college educa
tion.
The camp co6ts around $150
for two weeks which includes
meals, guidance, and a room at

Toyon Hall with unlimited use
of all the physical education fa
cilities at Stanford. The entire
camp lasts six weeks. It consists
of three two week sessions with
each boy limited to one two
week session. There are 170
campens who live the entire two
weeks on campus and 30 partici
pants who live in the surround
ing area and commute to the
camp every morning. The com
muters pay about half as much
as the resident campers.
In its ten year history the

camp has had boys from as far
away as Hong Kong and Argen
tina attend a two-week session.
However, most of the campers
come from southern California
while about twenty-five per cent
of the boys come from out of
the state.
Although the coaches hope
that they are developing poten
tial Stanford athletes during the
summer camp, there are only
two athletes presently enrolled
at Stanford who have attended
the camp. They are golfer Bob
Riddell and football player
John Mason.
The camp also provides Stan
ford's coaches additional income
during the summer, boosting
Stanford's athletic fund from

the profits gained from the
camp, and provides 20 Stanford
students with room and board
while serving as counselors for
the camp.
A Typical Day: Lon#
The campers spend three
hours in the morning and after
noon with the coaches, while the
remaining hours of the day are

spent relaxing from their ex
hausting athletic training.
The entire camp is run on an
extremely competitive basis,
with age division vying for the
"top camper" award.
Bedtime comes early for some
of the older boys with the light
out arriving at 9:15. However,
the day begins at 7:00, early for

some but there are always those
to be found who are up at 5:00
in the morning, running
through the halls, full of youth
ful enthusiasm.
Homesickness oceassionally
pops up in every session, but an
attentive belly-rub by head
counselor Phil Wagner usually
cures any thing.
