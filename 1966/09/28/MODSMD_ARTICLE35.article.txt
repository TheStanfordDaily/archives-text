# Stanford's Boxing Classes Yield Top Varsity Pugilists
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER Sports Editor 
Some fifty men registered for
one of Staniord's most colorful
Men's Physical Education cours
es, Elementary Boxing a la Ray
Lunny. From MPE 12 spring
some of Stanford's most color
ful athletes, the Indian boxers.
No previous experience is ne
cessary to enter the course, and
indeed it is the men with "no
previous experience" that have
formed the core of Stanford's
successful intercollegiate boxing
squad.
Torn Jenks, 172 pound junior
ring standout, started boxing in
PE class during his freshman
year. As a sophomore last sea
son, Jenks won 8 of 9 matches
and reversed his only loss to
pound out a conference cham
pionship.
Stress Fundamentals
The two elementary classes
usually contain around 20 stu
dents. Lunny stresses the fun
damentals: footwork, on guard
defense, the basic punches, and
conditioning. After one or two
quarters of the elementary
class, boxers move on to the ad
vanced class.
Since intercollegiate rules dis
qualify any boxer with more
than slight pre-college boxing
experience, all members of the
boxing team have punched their
way out of the PE classes.
Coach Lunny, now starting
his 20th year as Stanford's king
of the ring, believes in a plea
surable approach to learning
boxing skills. Neophyte boxers
spar against their peers, build
ing confidence and ability
through experience.
No Gladiators Here
Gone is the era when a novice
boxer would be thrown into the
arena with the biggest heavy
weight around to test the new
comer for his "guts". In those
black ages, too many guts too
often resulted in too few brain
cells in proper working order.
Lunny's enthusiasm for devel
oping new boxers and molding a
team has only become more in
tense after 20 years.
Lunny holds great expecta
tions for next year's varsity
which is starting workouts now.
Jenks must rate as the Big man
on the squad after his meteoric

successes as a sophomore last
season.
Jenks, a 172 pounder, will
have some Big company among
the Tribe heavyweights. Re
turning from last year's team
will be 245 pound Dave Oswald
and Eric DeGooyer, 225. Lunny
expects big things from this
crew.
Gene MofTett, 212 pound
tackle on the football team, will
box heavyweight this winter,
promising exciting things in the
Encina ring.
John Price, boxing 165, beat
the eventual conference champ
in the Nevada meet last year..
Lunny expects Price to be a
top contender in the 1967 inter
collegiate championships.
Marlar To The Fore
Jim Marlar had a highly suc
cessful season in 1966, boxing
in the 156 pound division. Lunny
looks for Marlar's right hand
to push the Phoenix junior to
the top in 1967.
The Indian's weak spots lie
in the 125 and 132 pound divi
sions. Perhaps PE 12 will pro
duce a title contender in one of
these slots.
Stanford boxes against Ne
vada, Cal, and Chico State, the
only remaining boxing schools.
The Tribe also takes on the 12th
Navy District squad from Trea
sure Island.
Gentle Touch
Lunny, who has put a career
of professional boxing behind
him, steps into the ring in his
gym classes and with the team.
He gently points out where his
protegee's weak points lie and
takes his lumps where he finds
their strong points.
In Lunny's well qualified

opinion, there is no boxing more
exciting to watch than inter
collegiate matches. As Stanford
spectators can verify, college
bouts have a liveliness that
makes professional boxing look
dull by comparison.
Indian varsity boxers will
start sparring in about two
weeks, and spectators will be
welcome.

Lunny, who has put a career
of professional boxing behind
him, steps into the ring in his
gym classes and with the team.
He gently points out where his
protegee's weak points lie and
takes his lumps where he finds
their strong points.
In Lunny's well qualified

opinion, there is no boxing more
exciting to watch than inter
collegiate matches. As Stanford
spectators can verify, college
bouts have a liveliness that
makes professional boxing look
dull by comparison.
Indian varsity boxers will
start sparring in about two
weeks, and spectators will be
welcome.
Some fifty men registered for
one of Staniord's most colorful
Men's Physical Education cours
es, Elementary Boxing a la Ray
Lunny. From MPE 12 spring
some of Stanford's most color
ful athletes, the Indian boxers.
No previous experience is ne
cessary to enter the course, and
indeed it is the men with "no
previous experience" that have
formed the core of Stanford's
successful intercollegiate boxing
squad.
Torn Jenks, 172 pound junior
ring standout, started boxing in
PE class during his freshman
year. As a sophomore last sea
son, Jenks won 8 of 9 matches
and reversed his only loss to
pound out a conference cham
pionship.
Stress Fundamentals
The two elementary classes
usually contain around 20 stu
dents. Lunny stresses the fun
damentals: footwork, on guard
defense, the basic punches, and
conditioning. After one or two
quarters of the elementary
class, boxers move on to the ad
vanced class.
Since intercollegiate rules dis
qualify any boxer with more
than slight pre-college boxing
experience, all members of the
boxing team have punched their
way out of the PE classes.
Coach Lunny, now starting
his 20th year as Stanford's king
of the ring, believes in a plea
surable approach to learning
boxing skills. Neophyte boxers
spar against their peers, build
ing confidence and ability
through experience.
No Gladiators Here
Gone is the era when a novice
boxer would be thrown into the
arena with the biggest heavy
weight around to test the new
comer for his "guts". In those
black ages, too many guts too
often resulted in too few brain
cells in proper working order.
Lunny's enthusiasm for devel
oping new boxers and molding a
team has only become more in
tense after 20 years.
Lunny holds great expecta
tions for next year's varsity
which is starting workouts now.
Jenks must rate as the Big man
on the squad after his meteoric

successes as a sophomore last
season.
Jenks, a 172 pounder, will
have some Big company among
the Tribe heavyweights. Re
turning from last year's team
will be 245 pound Dave Oswald
and Eric DeGooyer, 225. Lunny
expects big things from this
crew.
Gene MofTett, 212 pound
tackle on the football team, will
box heavyweight this winter,
promising exciting things in the
Encina ring.
John Price, boxing 165, beat
the eventual conference champ
in the Nevada meet last year..
Lunny expects Price to be a
top contender in the 1967 inter
collegiate championships.
Marlar To The Fore
Jim Marlar had a highly suc
cessful season in 1966, boxing
in the 156 pound division. Lunny
looks for Marlar's right hand
to push the Phoenix junior to
the top in 1967.
The Indian's weak spots lie
in the 125 and 132 pound divi
sions. Perhaps PE 12 will pro
duce a title contender in one of
these slots.
