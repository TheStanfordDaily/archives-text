By VERNON E. WEDIN, Jr.
Education at Stanford is exemplary of a pri
mary failing of American education today: au
thentic scholarship and learning has been sacri
ficed for ihe sake of training and craftsmanship,
which is marketable in the Great Society.
Stanford's breathless ascent toward technical
brilliance has met with considerable success and
now we are "trembling on the edge of greatness."
Unlike Faust us who sold his soul to the devil for
more honorable reasons, Stanford has aligned
itself with the biases and norms of the techno
logical society for want of any soul at all. In
fact, that which we might be said to possess has
been nourished by this very technological atti
tude.
In the wake of this development it proves
difficult to gain an accurate perspective on the
state of education at Stanford and easy to mis
place proficiency and skills for real education.
Obsession With 'Greatness'
This condition stems in no small part from
our obsession with the image of "greatness"
coupled with the lack of any proper standard for
judging what is great.
Certainly we cannot invoke our own history
and tradition, for there is little "greatness" to be
found therein. Neither do we seem prone to take
as our standard the tradition of the European
centers of learning.
Rather, we interpret "greatness" within the
very parochial framework of the here and now
of modern American society. Hence, we have
been extremely sensitive to the demands of this
society and have been duly rewarded for our
sensitivity.
I would like to suggest, however, that the
standard for academic "greatness" lies in the
concept of the university itself and that our mis
understanding of this concept has precluded the
possibility of achieving real greatness. We are
wont to employ the term "academic" to describe
that process which occurs in a university.
We are less inclined, however, to ask why the
university ought to be called "academic", and
contently assume that the "academic" is synony
mous with the university or automatically a con
tingency of it. It is this assumption which lies
at the bottom of the hollowness of much of Stan
ford and American education.
Origin Of The University
The term "academic" precedes by several cen
turies the term "university".
The origin of the university might be traced
to Bologna, where in 1158 Frederick I granted
an official charter to the University of Bologna.
At that time the term "universitas" denoted the
body of professors and students in a city, con
stituted by a charter as a corporation possessing
definite statutes and rights.
Yet the term "academic" extends much further
into history and is the antecedent of the univer
sity. It comes down to us from Plato's school in
the grove of Akademos and has come to refer
neither to the physical character nor to the or
ganizational nature of the school, but rather to
the essential nature of the activity which went
on there.
Thus, we speak of the "academic" spirit.
In Plato's academy this spirit manifested itself
as the spirit of inquiring philosophically, which
meant inquiring without restriction or regard
to practice, application, utilization or power.
Necessary for the nuturing and preservation
of this "academic" spirit is complete not merely
and freedom, openness and freedom not merely
to express points of view and investigate without
fear, but openness and freedom from bias and
dogma.
In a real sense universities are competent in
their pursuit only when they force or help the
individual to provide himself with an account of
the ultimate meaning of his own conduct.
This, in turn, demands a commitment to and
perseverance in the search for truth and under
standing, both of which are alien to even the

slightest bias or utility. What is required here
is less the courage of one's convictions than the
courage to attack one's convictions.
Hence the authentic "academic" spirit militates
against complacency and the falacy of mistak
ing the convenient and pragmatic for the true.
In other words, the cliche "if it works" has no
place within the "academic."
The Void In 'Academic Spirit'
My point is quite simple: At Stanford we have
forgotten about or, more precisely, we have
failed to cultivate this "academic" spirit.
In lieu of it, we are left with a notion of the
"university" which manifests itself in measura
ble quantities such as test scores of incoming
classes, annual output of Ph.D. degrees, federal
grants, and campus building projects. Someday
we may even speak of a "great" football team.
Indeed, in the haste to build we seem increas
ingly to have lost sight of what is really impor
tant in the university.
In the words of Dean of Admissions and Pro
fessor of History Rixford K. Snyder, "In my
judgment, the Pavilion is the single most impor
tant piece of building construction for under
graduate education at Stanford at this time. I
can think of no other project in which I have
more interest." So it appears that we may even
have a great basketball team someday.
This pre-occupation with "results" and
"achievement" may indeed be a substantial cause
for Stanford's "greatness-complex."
More serious, however, than this is our drift
away from the spirit of the "academic" in the
face of our growing response to a broad environ
mental nexus, which we might aptly call "social
power."
* The sole response to this social power is one
which produces something of "use" to society.
In the technological society utility and results
are championed, and the emphasis is placed on
productivity. Thereby, technology comes to re
place thought as the primary mark of the uni
versity.
With the denigration of thought the "aca
demic" is lost, avid with it the spirit of the uni
versity itself withers, leaving a hollow shell that
is traced out on organizational flow charts and
buried in financial ledgers.
At Odds With Extant Theories
The "academic" is lost because it is basically
at odds with all production-oriented and skill
producing theories of education. The "academic"
is lost because it requires freedom from the
immediacy and nearness of contemporary pre
vailing values.
It offers the past as equal worth in academic
inquiry and proceeds on the basis of its own
integrity and understanding, tending, thereby, to
transcend the narrowness and fascination with
the present and to resist the influence of social
power.
It rejects the thought of an "other-directed"
university, which reputation Stanford seems to
have acquired.
It encourages experimentation, but it does not
see in experimentation the key to education.
Neither does it encourage experimenting solely
with the "proven results" of other institutions.
Inherent, in other words, in the "academic" is
the courage to serve one's own understanding
and to withstand the pressure of "consensus".
The Return To Learning
What does it mean, then, when someone says
that Stanford is "trembling on the edge of great
ness?"
It cannot mean that we are a great university,
for we are still shaking at the prospect.
Great universities are historical entities, not
mere centers of training which skillfully adapt
to and fulfill the demands spawned from their
particular social millieu. They are homes for the
"academic", the foundation of the history of
thought and ideas.
To effect the transition from a highly skillful
university to a great university, it is not enough
merely to overcome the influence of "social
power." We must commit ourselves to restoring
the idea of a university.
This we can do only by returning to the great
traditional concerns of learning, concerns which
can be inspired only be reviving the spirit of the
"academic."

our obsession with the image of "greatness"
coupled with the lack of any proper standard for
judging what is great.
Certainly we cannot invoke our own history
and tradition, for there is little "greatness" to be
found therein. Neither do we seem prone to take
as our standard the tradition of the European
centers of learning.
Rather, we interpret "greatness" within the
very parochial framework of the here and now
of modern American society. Hence, we have
been extremely sensitive to the demands of this
society and have been duly rewarded for our
sensitivity.
I would like to suggest, however, that the
standard for academic "greatness" lies in the
concept of the university itself and that our mis
understanding of this concept has precluded the
possibility of achieving real greatness. We are
wont to employ the term "academic" to describe
that process which occurs in a university.
We are less inclined, however, to ask why the
university ought to be called "academic", and
contently assume that the "academic" is synony
mous with the university or automatically a con
tingency of it. It is this assumption which lies
at the bottom of the hollowness of much of Stan
ford and American education.
Origin Of The University
The term "academic" precedes by several cen
turies the term "university".
The origin of the university might be traced
to Bologna, where in 1158 Frederick I granted
an official charter to the University of Bologna.
At that time the term "universitas" denoted the
body of professors and students in a city, con
stituted by a charter as a corporation possessing
definite statutes and rights.
Yet the term "academic" extends much further
into history and is the antecedent of the univer
sity. It comes down to us from Plato's school in
the grove of Akademos and has come to refer
neither to the physical character nor to the or
ganizational nature of the school, but rather to
the essential nature of the activity which went
on there.
Thus, we speak of the "academic" spirit.
In Plato's academy this spirit manifested itself
as the spirit of inquiring philosophically, which
meant inquiring without restriction or regard
to practice, application, utilization or power.
Necessary for the nuturing and preservation
of this "academic" spirit is complete not merely
and freedom, openness and freedom not merely
to express points of view and investigate without
fear, but openness and freedom from bias and
dogma.
In a real sense universities are competent in
their pursuit only when they force or help the
individual to provide himself with an account of
the ultimate meaning of his own conduct.
This, in turn, demands a commitment to and
perseverance in the search for truth and under
standing, both of which are alien to even the

slightest bias or utility. What is required here
is less the courage of one's convictions than the
courage to attack one's convictions.
Hence the authentic "academic" spirit militates
against complacency and the falacy of mistak
ing the convenient and pragmatic for the true.
In other words, the cliche "if it works" has no
place within the "academic."
The Void In 'Academic Spirit'
My point is quite simple: At Stanford we have
forgotten about or, more precisely, we have
failed to cultivate this "academic" spirit.
In lieu of it, we are left with a notion of the
"university" which manifests itself in measura
ble quantities such as test scores of incoming
classes, annual output of Ph.D. degrees, federal
grants, and campus building projects. Someday
we may even speak of a "great" football team.
Indeed, in the haste to build we seem increas
ingly to have lost sight of what is really impor
tant in the university.
In the words of Dean of Admissions and Pro
fessor of History Rixford K. Snyder, "In my
judgment, the Pavilion is the single most impor
tant piece of building construction for under
graduate education at Stanford at this time. I
can think of no other project in which I have
more interest." So it appears that we may even
have a great basketball team someday.
This pre-occupation with "results" and
"achievement" may indeed be a substantial cause
for Stanford's "greatness-complex."
More serious, however, than this is our drift
away from the spirit of the "academic" in the
face of our growing response to a broad environ
mental nexus, which we might aptly call "social
power."
* The sole response to this social power is one
which produces something of "use" to society.
In the technological society utility and results
are championed, and the emphasis is placed on
productivity. Thereby, technology comes to re
place thought as the primary mark of the uni
versity.
With the denigration of thought the "aca
demic" is lost, avid with it the spirit of the uni
versity itself withers, leaving a hollow shell that
is traced out on organizational flow charts and
buried in financial ledgers.
At Odds With Extant Theories
The "academic" is lost because it is basically
at odds with all production-oriented and skill
producing theories of education. The "academic"
is lost because it requires freedom from the
immediacy and nearness of contemporary pre
vailing values.
It offers the past as equal worth in academic
inquiry and proceeds on the basis of its own
integrity and understanding, tending, thereby, to
transcend the narrowness and fascination with
the present and to resist the influence of social
power.
It rejects the thought of an "other-directed"
university, which reputation Stanford seems to
have acquired.
It encourages experimentation, but it does not
see in experimentation the key to education.
Neither does it encourage experimenting solely
with the "proven results" of other institutions.
Inherent, in other words, in the "academic" is
the courage to serve one's own understanding
and to withstand the pressure of "consensus".
The Return To Learning
What does it mean, then, when someone says
that Stanford is "trembling on the edge of great
ness?"
It cannot mean that we are a great university,
for we are still shaking at the prospect.
Great universities are historical entities, not
mere centers of training which skillfully adapt
to and fulfill the demands spawned from their
particular social millieu. They are homes for the
"academic", the foundation of the history of
thought and ideas.
To effect the transition from a highly skillful
university to a great university, it is not enough
merely to overcome the influence of "social
power." We must commit ourselves to restoring
the idea of a university.
This we can do only by returning to the great
traditional concerns of learning, concerns which
can be inspired only be reviving the spirit of the
"academic."

turies the term "university".
The origin of the university might be traced
to Bologna, where in 1158 Frederick I granted
an official charter to the University of Bologna.
At that time the term "universitas" denoted the
body of professors and students in a city, con
stituted by a charter as a corporation possessing
definite statutes and rights.
Yet the term "academic" extends much further
into history and is the antecedent of the univer
sity. It comes down to us from Plato's school in
the grove of Akademos and has come to refer
neither to the physical character nor to the or
ganizational nature of the school, but rather to
the essential nature of the activity which went
on there.
Thus, we speak of the "academic" spirit.
In Plato's academy this spirit manifested itself
as the spirit of inquiring philosophically, which
meant inquiring without restriction or regard
to practice, application, utilization or power.
Necessary for the nuturing and preservation
of this "academic" spirit is complete not merely
and freedom, openness and freedom not merely
to express points of view and investigate without
fear, but openness and freedom from bias and
dogma.
In a real sense universities are competent in
their pursuit only when they force or help the
individual to provide himself with an account of
the ultimate meaning of his own conduct.
This, in turn, demands a commitment to and
perseverance in the search for truth and under
standing, both of which are alien to even the

slightest bias or utility. What is required here
is less the courage of one's convictions than the
courage to attack one's convictions.
Hence the authentic "academic" spirit militates
against complacency and the falacy of mistak
ing the convenient and pragmatic for the true.
In other words, the cliche "if it works" has no
place within the "academic."
The Void In 'Academic Spirit'
My point is quite simple: At Stanford we have
forgotten about or, more precisely, we have
failed to cultivate this "academic" spirit.
In lieu of it, we are left with a notion of the
"university" which manifests itself in measura
ble quantities such as test scores of incoming
classes, annual output of Ph.D. degrees, federal
grants, and campus building projects. Someday
we may even speak of a "great" football team.
Indeed, in the haste to build we seem increas
ingly to have lost sight of what is really impor
tant in the university.
In the words of Dean of Admissions and Pro
fessor of History Rixford K. Snyder, "In my
judgment, the Pavilion is the single most impor
tant piece of building construction for under
graduate education at Stanford at this time. I
can think of no other project in which I have
more interest." So it appears that we may even
have a great basketball team someday.
This pre-occupation with "results" and
"achievement" may indeed be a substantial cause
for Stanford's "greatness-complex."
More serious, however, than this is our drift
away from the spirit of the "academic" in the
face of our growing response to a broad environ
mental nexus, which we might aptly call "social
power."
* The sole response to this social power is one
which produces something of "use" to society.
In the technological society utility and results
are championed, and the emphasis is placed on
productivity. Thereby, technology comes to re
place thought as the primary mark of the uni
versity.
With the denigration of thought the "aca
demic" is lost, avid with it the spirit of the uni
versity itself withers, leaving a hollow shell that
is traced out on organizational flow charts and
buried in financial ledgers.
At Odds With Extant Theories
The "academic" is lost because it is basically
at odds with all production-oriented and skill
producing theories of education. The "academic"
is lost because it requires freedom from the
immediacy and nearness of contemporary pre
vailing values.
It offers the past as equal worth in academic
inquiry and proceeds on the basis of its own
integrity and understanding, tending, thereby, to
transcend the narrowness and fascination with
the present and to resist the influence of social
power.
It rejects the thought of an "other-directed"
university, which reputation Stanford seems to
have acquired.
It encourages experimentation, but it does not
see in experimentation the key to education.
Neither does it encourage experimenting solely
with the "proven results" of other institutions.
Inherent, in other words, in the "academic" is
the courage to serve one's own understanding
and to withstand the pressure of "consensus".
The Return To Learning
What does it mean, then, when someone says
that Stanford is "trembling on the edge of great
ness?"
It cannot mean that we are a great university,
for we are still shaking at the prospect.
Great universities are historical entities, not
mere centers of training which skillfully adapt
to and fulfill the demands spawned from their
particular social millieu. They are homes for the
"academic", the foundation of the history of
thought and ideas.
To effect the transition from a highly skillful
university to a great university, it is not enough
merely to overcome the influence of "social
power." We must commit ourselves to restoring
the idea of a university.
This we can do only by returning to the great
traditional concerns of learning, concerns which
can be inspired only be reviving the spirit of the
"academic."

pured for The Daily last spring by former stu
dent body president Vernon (Bud) Wedin. Wedin

commitment to the academic spirit.)
By VERNON E. WEDIN, Jr.
Education at Stanford is exemplary of a pri
mary failing of American education today: au
thentic scholarship and learning has been sacri
ficed for ihe sake of training and craftsmanship,
which is marketable in the Great Society.
Stanford's breathless ascent toward technical
brilliance has met with considerable success and
now we are "trembling on the edge of greatness."
Unlike Faust us who sold his soul to the devil for
more honorable reasons, Stanford has aligned
itself with the biases and norms of the techno
logical society for want of any soul at all. In
fact, that which we might be said to possess has
been nourished by this very technological atti
tude.
In the wake of this development it proves
difficult to gain an accurate perspective on the
state of education at Stanford and easy to mis
place proficiency and skills for real education.
Obsession With 'Greatness'
This condition stems in no small part from
our obsession with the image of "greatness"
coupled with the lack of any proper standard for
judging what is great.
Certainly we cannot invoke our own history
and tradition, for there is little "greatness" to be
found therein. Neither do we seem prone to take
as our standard the tradition of the European
centers of learning.
Rather, we interpret "greatness" within the
very parochial framework of the here and now
of modern American society. Hence, we have
been extremely sensitive to the demands of this
society and have been duly rewarded for our
sensitivity.
I would like to suggest, however, that the
standard for academic "greatness" lies in the
concept of the university itself and that our mis
understanding of this concept has precluded the
possibility of achieving real greatness. We are
wont to employ the term "academic" to describe
that process which occurs in a university.
We are less inclined, however, to ask why the
university ought to be called "academic", and
contently assume that the "academic" is synony
mous with the university or automatically a con
tingency of it. It is this assumption which lies
at the bottom of the hollowness of much of Stan
ford and American education.

the ultimate meaning of his own conduct.
This, in turn, demands a commitment to and
perseverance in the search for truth and under
standing, both of which are alien to even the

slightest bias or utility. What is required here
is less the courage of one's convictions than the
courage to attack one's convictions.
Hence the authentic "academic" spirit militates
against complacency and the falacy of mistak
ing the convenient and pragmatic for the true.
In other words, the cliche "if it works" has no
place within the "academic."
The Void In 'Academic Spirit'
My point is quite simple: At Stanford we have
forgotten about or, more precisely, we have
failed to cultivate this "academic" spirit.
In lieu of it, we are left with a notion of the
"university" which manifests itself in measura
ble quantities such as test scores of incoming
classes, annual output of Ph.D. degrees, federal
grants, and campus building projects. Someday
we may even speak of a "great" football team.
Indeed, in the haste to build we seem increas
ingly to have lost sight of what is really impor
tant in the university.
In the words of Dean of Admissions and Pro
fessor of History Rixford K. Snyder, "In my
judgment, the Pavilion is the single most impor
tant piece of building construction for under
graduate education at Stanford at this time. I
can think of no other project in which I have
more interest." So it appears that we may even
have a great basketball team someday.
This pre-occupation with "results" and
"achievement" may indeed be a substantial cause
for Stanford's "greatness-complex."
More serious, however, than this is our drift
away from the spirit of the "academic" in the
face of our growing response to a broad environ
mental nexus, which we might aptly call "social
power."
* The sole response to this social power is one
which produces something of "use" to society.
In the technological society utility and results
are championed, and the emphasis is placed on
productivity. Thereby, technology comes to re
place thought as the primary mark of the uni
versity.
With the denigration of thought the "aca
demic" is lost, avid with it the spirit of the uni
versity itself withers, leaving a hollow shell that
is traced out on organizational flow charts and
buried in financial ledgers.
At Odds With Extant Theories
The "academic" is lost because it is basically
at odds with all production-oriented and skill
producing theories of education. The "academic"
is lost because it requires freedom from the
immediacy and nearness of contemporary pre
vailing values.
It offers the past as equal worth in academic
inquiry and proceeds on the basis of its own
integrity and understanding, tending, thereby, to
transcend the narrowness and fascination with
the present and to resist the influence of social
power.
It rejects the thought of an "other-directed"
university, which reputation Stanford seems to
have acquired.
It encourages experimentation, but it does not
see in experimentation the key to education.
Neither does it encourage experimenting solely
with the "proven results" of other institutions.
Inherent, in other words, in the "academic" is
the courage to serve one's own understanding
and to withstand the pressure of "consensus".
The Return To Learning
What does it mean, then, when someone says
that Stanford is "trembling on the edge of great
ness?"
It cannot mean that we are a great university,
for we are still shaking at the prospect.
Great universities are historical entities, not
mere centers of training which skillfully adapt
to and fulfill the demands spawned from their
particular social millieu. They are homes for the
"academic", the foundation of the history of
thought and ideas.
To effect the transition from a highly skillful
university to a great university, it is not enough
merely to overcome the influence of "social
power." We must commit ourselves to restoring
the idea of a university.
This we can do only by returning to the great
traditional concerns of learning, concerns which
can be inspired only be reviving the spirit of the
"academic."

By VERNON E. WEDIN, Jr.
Education at Stanford is exemplary of a pri
mary failing of American education today: au
thentic scholarship and learning has been sacri
ficed for ihe sake of training and craftsmanship,
which is marketable in the Great Society.
Stanford's breathless ascent toward technical
brilliance has met with considerable success and
now we are "trembling on the edge of greatness."
Unlike Faust us who sold his soul to the devil for
more honorable reasons, Stanford has aligned
itself with the biases and norms of the techno
logical society for want of any soul at all. In
fact, that which we might be said to possess has
been nourished by this very technological atti
tude.
In the wake of this development it proves
difficult to gain an accurate perspective on the
state of education at Stanford and easy to mis
place proficiency and skills for real education.
Obsession With 'Greatness'
This condition stems in no small part from
our obsession with the image of "greatness"
coupled with the lack of any proper standard for
judging what is great.
Certainly we cannot invoke our own history
and tradition, for there is little "greatness" to be
found therein. Neither do we seem prone to take
as our standard the tradition of the European
centers of learning.
Rather, we interpret "greatness" within the
very parochial framework of the here and now
of modern American society. Hence, we have
been extremely sensitive to the demands of this
society and have been duly rewarded for our
sensitivity.
I would like to suggest, however, that the
standard for academic "greatness" lies in the
concept of the university itself and that our mis
understanding of this concept has precluded the
possibility of achieving real greatness. We are
wont to employ the term "academic" to describe
that process which occurs in a university.
We are less inclined, however, to ask why the
university ought to be called "academic", and
contently assume that the "academic" is synony
mous with the university or automatically a con
tingency of it. It is this assumption which lies
at the bottom of the hollowness of much of Stan
ford and American education.
Origin Of The University
The term "academic" precedes by several cen
turies the term "university".
The origin of the university might be traced
to Bologna, where in 1158 Frederick I granted
an official charter to the University of Bologna.
At that time the term "universitas" denoted the
body of professors and students in a city, con
stituted by a charter as a corporation possessing
definite statutes and rights.
Yet the term "academic" extends much further
into history and is the antecedent of the univer
sity. It comes down to us from Plato's school in
the grove of Akademos and has come to refer
neither to the physical character nor to the or
ganizational nature of the school, but rather to
the essential nature of the activity which went
on there.
Thus, we speak of the "academic" spirit.
In Plato's academy this spirit manifested itself
as the spirit of inquiring philosophically, which
meant inquiring without restriction or regard
to practice, application, utilization or power.
Necessary for the nuturing and preservation
of this "academic" spirit is complete not merely
and freedom, openness and freedom not merely
to express points of view and investigate without
fear, but openness and freedom from bias and
dogma.
In a real sense universities are competent in
their pursuit only when they force or help the
individual to provide himself with an account of
the ultimate meaning of his own conduct.
This, in turn, demands a commitment to and
perseverance in the search for truth and under
standing, both of which are alien to even the

slightest bias or utility. What is required here
is less the courage of one's convictions than the
courage to attack one's convictions.
