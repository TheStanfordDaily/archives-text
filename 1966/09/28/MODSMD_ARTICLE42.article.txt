## Out-Guessing LBJ—Or How To Choose Attorney General 
### Art Buchwald 
WASHINGTON—The method
used by President Johnson in
announcing Atty. Gen. Nicholas
Katzenbach's appointment as
Undersecretary of State has
Washington very worried.
You may recall the President
did not make the announcement
until a reporter asked the ques
tion at a press conference.
The fear here is that if the
President decides to break the
news of all his appointments in
this manner, and no one asks
him the right question at a press
conference, many important va
cancies in the government may
never be filled.
Less Likelihood
This was compounded by the
President's statement that the
more the press speculated about
a certain individual for a job
the less likelihood that person
would have of getting the ap
pointment.
If this is the case, perhaps we
may never have an attorney
general again.
Suppose the President is meet
ing with advisers to discuss Kat
zenbach's replacement in the
Justice Department.
"Mr. President, I don't like to
push you, but it's been a year
now and you still haven't an
nounced who the attorney gen
eral is going to be."
Not My Fault
"It's not my fault. If the news
papers would stop speculating I
could decide on somebody. But
every time I think I've got some
one they haven't heard of the
name pops up in a column and
then I've got to eliminate him. I
thought I had them when I de
cided to appoint Sandy Koufax
to the job, but somehow Sports
Illustrated got wind of it."
"We hadn't thought anyone
would be on to Koufax," one of
the advisers admitted. "What
happened to Dr. Spock?"
"Drew Pearson had it in one
of his predictions, and I was
darned if I was going to give
him the satisfaction of being
right," the President replied.
George Hamilton
Another aide said, "I see
where Evans and Novak said
you would appoint George Ham
ilton."
"I was sorry about that.
George might have made a good
attorney general."
"Mr. President, don't you
think we ought to appoint some
one as attorney general with le
gal experience?"
"I'd like to, but you know as
well as I do that every lawyer
we could possibly think of has
already been suggested for the
job by either a column or a
newspaper. The more they spec
ulate the harder it gets for me."

"Why couldn't we forget about
the press and just appoint some
body to the job?"
"Not as long as I'm President.
I'm not going to have anyone
tell me who to appoint and who
not to appoint. Besides, you lose
the element of surprise."
"The President's right," an
aide said. "We should be able to
think of somebody that the press
hasn't thought of."
"It's easier said than done,"
another aide said. "Remember
when we were going to appoint
Ed Sullivan and Variety heard
about it?"
"There must be someone that
no one has thought of."
It's Hubert
Just then the phone rings. An
aide picks it up and listens.
Then he says to the President,
"It's Hubert Humphrey. He
wants to know if you still think
highly of him."
The President snaps his fin
gers. "Why didn't we think of it
before?"
The aide says,"It was right
under our very noses."
The President picks up the
phone. "Hubert I've got a job
for you. No, I can't tell you what
it is, but tune in on my press
conference this afternoon. I
think you'll be in for a real sur
prise."
