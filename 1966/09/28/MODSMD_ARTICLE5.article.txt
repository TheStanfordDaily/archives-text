Ram's Head Board presents a good
show for interested students. After
the seasonal success of Gaieties, the
group's winter show is a highlight of

the quarter. Last year, "Lysistrata"
was presented in the Little Theater in
a production combining Aristophanes'
lyric verse with an original rock-and
roll score. Spring quarter, .Ram's Head
moves to The Nitery. Under the di
rection of three candidates from the
Speech and Drama Department's Mas
ter of Fine Arts Program, a trio of
one-acts teamed Tennessee Williams'

"10 Blocks on the Camino Real" with
two student-written plays in premiere
performance. "The Importance of Be
ing Earnest" was the surprise bonus
hit of the summer quarter as visiting
students from throughout the United
States and Canada who joined the
cast for the production took advan
tage of the impact of the Nitery's
three-quarter staging.
Tryouts for 1966 Big Game Gaieties,
"AAAUUGH! or Why Yellow-bellied
Sapsuckers Eat Raspberry Licorice,"
continues tonight at 7:30 in the Little
Theater.
A cast of 30 augmented off-stage by
a pit chorus and full orchestra wail
through 12 lavish production num
bers. The musical "extravaganza"
spoofs sex, suspense and squares as
Mata Hariovitch takes on the Red
Machine, Insecurity Council and Spe
c' tf Agents C.I.A. In a clash to un

Cal's team.
As varied as the action are the sets
which span continents, from Sequoia
Travel Desk and The Jester to Red
I Plaza and the practice
room of Moscow's Bolshoi Ballet.
Backstage offers a show in itself,
as the production is whipped together
for its November 16 opening. Sets
and flats are designed and painted in
mammoth all-night runs. Sewing ma
chines whir in the costume rooms as
filings and make-up techniques com
pete for the attention of the cast.
