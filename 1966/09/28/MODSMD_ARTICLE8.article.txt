# 'Experiment' Started; Will Offer Education Beyond Classrooms
## 
### JAMES BRISCOE Associate Editor 
A program conducted mainly by
graduate students and aimed at
"bringing the personal element back
into education" is being initiated on
campus this fall.
Titled simply "The Exeriment," its
courses will be primarily of the work
shop and seminar variety.
Approximately 70 students had
signed up to attend one or more of the
seminars by the end of registration
yesterday.
Course offerings for the fall include
seminars on the "American Youth in
Revolt," "Contemporary Education,"
"Black Power," and "Existentialism
and Political Commitment," as well
as workshops in photography, sculp
ture and poetry.
Single Requirement
"The only requirement for our
seminars is a belief that everything
is not all right in our society today,"
Barry Greenberg, one of the founders
of the program noted. Greenberg, who
turned down an assistant professor
ship at Michigan State University to
work on The Experiment, continued,
"VVe will be asking questions about
contemporary issues, not, I hope, pro
viding domatic answers."
The primary purose of The Experi
ment, according to its publication
Commitment, is "to offer students an
opportunity to integrate their educa
tional experience with the questions,
issues, atid choices which deeply af
fect their lives ..."
The curriculum is based on two be
liefs:
• "Knowledge and the educational
experience should not be used to open
doors to social acceptability and se
curity, but rather ... to open doors to
an understanding of one's self, one's
society, and the relationship between
the two.
• "An excellent way to integrate
the educational experience with this
search for self and social understand
ing is to take the acquisition of
knowledge out of a purely academic
atmosphere."
New Campus Publication
The Experiment hopes to publish
Commitment on a bi-weekly basis dur
ing the school year.
The group is registered as a vol
untary student organization and
hopes to be allowed to hold classes
in university facilities.
At present, no academic credit is
given for work done in the seminars
of The Experiment, however several
professors have indicated that they

may give directed reading credit to
students involved in the program.
Albert Guerard of the English Dept.
noted that The Experiment could be
a very valuable supplement to the
current educational offerings at Stan
ford. "They can offer courses dealing
with contemporary issues such as
black power, and East Palo Alto, that
can't possibly be offered by the uni
versity," he said.
"And, quite possibly, if some of
their seminars prove very successful
they might be later offered by the uni
versity," he added.
Continuation of Seminar
The gensis of The Experiment was
a seminar in existential thought at
the Free University of Palo Alto last
year. Founders of The Experiment
view it as a practical continuation of
that seminar.
"In a sense, we're trying to put in
to effect some of the ideas on edu
cation that have been suggested by
Dave Harris and others during the
last year," Greenberg says.
Chief among these ideas is the be
lief that "everything is basically all
wrong with American society," and
that American universities are play
ing a major role in preserving that
society.
"The university's major function is
to prepare you for a social role, and
this preparation primarily involves
the mastering of socially useful . . .
skills," The Experiment's publication
says. "In fact, many major universi
ties are actively engaged in support
ing and propagating the status quo."
The Question of Why
The Experiment hopes to bring the
question of why to the forefront, and
its catalogue of course offerings notes,
"it is our society's failure to concern
itself with the question of why that
leads many of us to criticize what
America is doing."
The Experiment hopes to maintain
a relatively unstructured approach to
education, viewing its curriculum as
"fluid becoming rather than static be
ing."
"Courses are not rigidly defined en
tities. Teacher and learner proceed to
gether, not in a heirarchical relation
ship."
A completely democratic structure
is planned for The Experiment. A
student coordinating committee of
elected representatives will make ad
ministrative but not policy decisions.
Questions concerning policy will be
determined by the entire membership.
Another committee will review all
seminars and recommend changes
when necessary.

in university facilities.
At present, no academic credit is
given for work done in the seminars
of The Experiment, however several
professors have indicated that they

may give directed reading credit to
students involved in the program.
Albert Guerard of the English Dept.
noted that The Experiment could be
a very valuable supplement to the
current educational offerings at Stan
ford. "They can offer courses dealing
with contemporary issues such as
black power, and East Palo Alto, that
can't possibly be offered by the uni
versity," he said.
"And, quite possibly, if some of
their seminars prove very successful
they might be later offered by the uni
versity," he added.
Continuation of Seminar
The gensis of The Experiment was
a seminar in existential thought at
the Free University of Palo Alto last
year. Founders of The Experiment
view it as a practical continuation of
that seminar.
"In a sense, we're trying to put in
to effect some of the ideas on edu
cation that have been suggested by
Dave Harris and others during the
last year," Greenberg says.
Chief among these ideas is the be
lief that "everything is basically all
wrong with American society," and
that American universities are play
ing a major role in preserving that
society.
"The university's major function is
to prepare you for a social role, and
this preparation primarily involves
the mastering of socially useful . . .
skills," The Experiment's publication
says. "In fact, many major universi
ties are actively engaged in support
ing and propagating the status quo."
The Question of Why
The Experiment hopes to bring the
question of why to the forefront, and
its catalogue of course offerings notes,
"it is our society's failure to concern
itself with the question of why that
leads many of us to criticize what
America is doing."
The Experiment hopes to maintain
a relatively unstructured approach to
education, viewing its curriculum as
"fluid becoming rather than static be
ing."
"Courses are not rigidly defined en
tities. Teacher and learner proceed to
gether, not in a heirarchical relation
ship."
A completely democratic structure
is planned for The Experiment. A
student coordinating committee of
elected representatives will make ad
ministrative but not policy decisions.
Questions concerning policy will be
determined by the entire membership.
Another committee will review all
seminars and recommend changes
when necessary.
A program conducted mainly by
graduate students and aimed at
"bringing the personal element back
into education" is being initiated on
campus this fall.
Titled simply "The Exeriment," its
courses will be primarily of the work
shop and seminar variety.
Approximately 70 students had
signed up to attend one or more of the
seminars by the end of registration
yesterday.
Course offerings for the fall include
seminars on the "American Youth in
Revolt," "Contemporary Education,"
"Black Power," and "Existentialism
and Political Commitment," as well
as workshops in photography, sculp
ture and poetry.
Single Requirement
"The only requirement for our
seminars is a belief that everything
is not all right in our society today,"
Barry Greenberg, one of the founders
of the program noted. Greenberg, who
turned down an assistant professor
ship at Michigan State University to
work on The Experiment, continued,
"VVe will be asking questions about
contemporary issues, not, I hope, pro
viding domatic answers."
The primary purose of The Experi
ment, according to its publication
Commitment, is "to offer students an
opportunity to integrate their educa
tional experience with the questions,
issues, atid choices which deeply af
fect their lives ..."
The curriculum is based on two be
liefs:
• "Knowledge and the educational
experience should not be used to open
doors to social acceptability and se
curity, but rather ... to open doors to
an understanding of one's self, one's
society, and the relationship between
the two.
• "An excellent way to integrate
the educational experience with this
search for self and social understand
ing is to take the acquisition of
knowledge out of a purely academic
atmosphere."
New Campus Publication
The Experiment hopes to publish
Commitment on a bi-weekly basis dur

The group is registered as a vol
