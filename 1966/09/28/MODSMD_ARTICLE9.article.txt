# Post Office Road Due For Completion Soon
## 
### STEVE GRUBER 
The road leading to the Post Office
from Stern Hall will be completed in
three weeks.
Workmen started digging trenches
for the curbs today and the paving
will begin in about two weeks. The
road orginally ran through the pres
ent Undergraduate Library site, but
was torn up in December, 1964. It
was replaced by a dirt road that even
tually became famous for its potholes.
Ray Benton, superintendent for the
library project, said yesterday that
the library will be finished on Oc
tober 28. He estimated that the Uni
versity would officially open the huild
ing on November 1.
Finished Friday
According to Benton, all of the
Engstrum and Nourse employees will
finish their work this Friday, with the
exception of the workers in the base
ment. Plans for the basement were
changed a few months ago to include
two tiers of bookshelves. The change
will hold up total completion of the
library for a few weeks.
Most of the work has been com
pleted on the upper flooiis. Carpets

have been laid, and the turnstiles in
stalled, but most of the electronic
equipment for the listening rooms is
not finished.
Paving will start Friday on the
asphalt walkways that surround the
building. It will be done by a sub
contractor, as will the landscaping.
Landscaping
The landscaping will extend out
from the front of the library approxi
mately 100 feet. The rest of the land
to the street will be used a<s a park
ing lot.
Nearly 160 feet of Galvez Street at
the intersection of Escondido Road
will be repaved within three weeks.
The sidewalk will be extended 10 feet
into the street directly in front of
the library.
The Undergraduate Library was
started on December 7, 1964 and was
originally scheduled to be completed
last July. The completion date had to
be extended to November due to the
scarcity of some materials.
Engstrum and Nour.se, the contrac
tor, has built one other campus struc
ture, the Graduate School of Business.
They have also completed buildings at
Berkeley and Hayward State.
Fifth Floor
Benton said that provision has been
made to add a fifth floor if the Un
dergraduate Library outgrows its
present four floors and basement. The
tile roof can he removed and the next
floor built around the skylight, as are
the third and fourth floors.
The fourth floor has four sundecks,
one at each corner. The sundecks will
have tables and chairs and are ex
pected to become a favorite place to
study during spring quarter.

two tiers of bookshelves. The change
will hold up total completion of the
library for a few weeks.
Most of the work has been com
pleted on the upper flooiis. Carpets

have been laid, and the turnstiles in
stalled, but most of the electronic
equipment for the listening rooms is
not finished.
Paving will start Friday on the
asphalt walkways that surround the
building. It will be done by a sub
contractor, as will the landscaping.
Landscaping
The landscaping will extend out
from the front of the library approxi
mately 100 feet. The rest of the land
to the street will be used a<s a park
ing lot.
Nearly 160 feet of Galvez Street at
the intersection of Escondido Road
will be repaved within three weeks.
The sidewalk will be extended 10 feet
into the street directly in front of
the library.
The Undergraduate Library was
started on December 7, 1964 and was
originally scheduled to be completed
last July. The completion date had to
be extended to November due to the
scarcity of some materials.
Engstrum and Nour.se, the contrac
tor, has built one other campus struc
ture, the Graduate School of Business.
They have also completed buildings at
Berkeley and Hayward State.
Fifth Floor
Benton said that provision has been
made to add a fifth floor if the Un
dergraduate Library outgrows its
present four floors and basement. The
tile roof can he removed and the next
floor built around the skylight, as are
the third and fourth floors.
The fourth floor has four sundecks,
one at each corner. The sundecks will
have tables and chairs and are ex
pected to become a favorite place to
study during spring quarter.
The road leading to the Post Office
from Stern Hall will be completed in
three weeks.
Workmen started digging trenches
for the curbs today and the paving
will begin in about two weeks. The
road orginally ran through the pres
ent Undergraduate Library site, but
was torn up in December, 1964. It
was replaced by a dirt road that even
tually became famous for its potholes.
Ray Benton, superintendent for the
library project, said yesterday that
the library will be finished on Oc
tober 28. He estimated that the Uni
versity would officially open the huild
ing on November 1.
Finished Friday
According to Benton, all of the
Engstrum and Nourse employees will
finish their work this Friday, with the
exception of the workers in the base
ment. Plans for the basement were
changed a few months ago to include
two tiers of bookshelves. The change
will hold up total completion of the
library for a few weeks.
