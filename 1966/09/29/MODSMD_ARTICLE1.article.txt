# Satisfaction, Discontent Shown By Overseas Poll
## 
### KIRK HANSON Managing Editor 
first Stanford Daily Overseas
Poll, taken two weeks ago at Stan
ford-in-Italy and Stanford-in-France
has revealed general enthusiasm for
the overseas program but also has
shown widespread dissatisfaction with
many aspects of curriculum and regu
lations.
The poll was administered to Italy
XII and France XII at the end of the
summer quarter, the end of their
overseas experience. Such a poll of
student feelings concerning the over
seas program had never been taken
before. The questionnaire sought stu
dent sentiment on facilities, programs,
courses, regulations, and expenses,
using an "excellent-good-fair-poor" rat
ing system.
Italy XII reported 90 per cent rat
ing the location of the campus as ex
cellent while the Tours location re
ceived a rating of good from a pre
dominate 63 per cent. The poll re
ceived inconclusive results from ques
tions on the facilities of the campuses.
However both campuses did uniformly
criticize facilities for study. On the
crucial and much discussed question

of food, France XII showed a fair to
poor rating while Italy responded
good to excellent.
Meeting Local People
Great difference of reaction was re
ceived by a question on contact with
the local people. France responded
that almost 70 per cent had contact
either often or very often. In Italy
nearly 70 per cent stated they had
contact with the Florentines seldom
or never.
Reaction to the culture courses
taught at the campuses was mixed,
as were ratings of the courses taught
by American professors. Language
courses were generally reported at
both campuses as good to excellent.
On the question of academic load,
over 70 per cent of the students in
France XII replied that it was too
heavy while in Italy only 40 per cent
replied in this way. Asked what was
the ideal number of units to be taken
overseas, 77 per cent in Italy and 78
per cent in France stated 14, to re
place the present sixteen.
Regulations Seen Too Restrictive
Campus regulations stimulated much

comment on the questionnaires and
were the topic of group discussions in
both Italy and France during the six
month6. One poll question asked each
student to rate the regulations as
much too restrictive, too restrictive,
just right, or too permissive. France
showed the greatest dissatisfaction in
this area as 90 per cent rated the reg
ulations as too restrictive or much too
restrictive. In Italy this same ex
pression came to almost 60 per cent.
Five per cent in Italy and zero per
cent in France thought the regula
tions too permissive.
Figures provided to The Dally con
cerning expenses conflicted greatly
with the established Overseas cam
pus figure of $600 for expenses ex
cluding room, board, tuition, and
flight home. The students in Italy re
ported an average figure of $1051
while those in France spent an aver
age $916 each.
Of the 136 polled only twenty-four
reported that they had been to Europe
before. Thirty-nine stated they were
remaining in Europe this fall for ex
tended travel or work. During the reg
ular six months fourteen of the stu
dents polled purchased cars.

Reform Action In Question
The dissatisfaction evident in the
results of the poll is very much con
sistent with the criticisms leveled last
6pring by the Martindale Report on
the overseas campus program. How
ever, since that time no reforms have
been implemented. A meeting of all
the directors of the overseas cam
puses is scheduled for Stanford-in-
Italy in November and it is speculated
that reforms will be discussed then.
One question on the poll dealt with
academic performance overseas re
lated to academic performance at the
home campus. In spite of general
sentiment expressed of dissatisfaction
with course load, 33 per cent in France
and 39 per cent in Italy reported
higher grades than they had been re
ceiving here. Only 5 per cent in
France and 8 per cent in Italy stated
their grades were generally lower.
General enthusiasm for the pro
gram was indicated in the final ques
tion asking if the students would
come again to their respective cam
puses if they had it to do over again.
Almost 95 per cent in Italy XII and
85 per cent in France responded "yes."

the ideal number of units to be taken
overseas, 77 per cent in Italy and 78
per cent in France stated 14, to re
place the present sixteen.
Regulations Seen Too Restrictive
Campus regulations stimulated much

comment on the questionnaires and
were the topic of group discussions in
both Italy and France during the six
month6. One poll question asked each
student to rate the regulations as
much too restrictive, too restrictive,
just right, or too permissive. France
showed the greatest dissatisfaction in
this area as 90 per cent rated the reg
ulations as too restrictive or much too
restrictive. In Italy this same ex
pression came to almost 60 per cent.
Five per cent in Italy and zero per
cent in France thought the regula
tions too permissive.
Figures provided to The Dally con
cerning expenses conflicted greatly
with the established Overseas cam
pus figure of $600 for expenses ex
cluding room, board, tuition, and
flight home. The students in Italy re
ported an average figure of $1051
while those in France spent an aver
age $916 each.
Of the 136 polled only twenty-four
reported that they had been to Europe
before. Thirty-nine stated they were
remaining in Europe this fall for ex
tended travel or work. During the reg
ular six months fourteen of the stu
dents polled purchased cars.

Reform Action In Question
The dissatisfaction evident in the
results of the poll is very much con
sistent with the criticisms leveled last
6pring by the Martindale Report on
the overseas campus program. How
ever, since that time no reforms have
been implemented. A meeting of all
the directors of the overseas cam
puses is scheduled for Stanford-in-
Italy in November and it is speculated
that reforms will be discussed then.
One question on the poll dealt with
academic performance overseas re
lated to academic performance at the
home campus. In spite of general
sentiment expressed of dissatisfaction
with course load, 33 per cent in France
and 39 per cent in Italy reported
higher grades than they had been re
ceiving here. Only 5 per cent in
France and 8 per cent in Italy stated
their grades were generally lower.
General enthusiasm for the pro
gram was indicated in the final ques
tion asking if the students would
come again to their respective cam
puses if they had it to do over again.
Almost 95 per cent in Italy XII and
85 per cent in France responded "yes."


FLORENCE: DUOMO AND PALAZZO VECCHIO
first Stanford Daily Overseas
Poll, taken two weeks ago at Stan
ford-in-Italy and Stanford-in-France
has revealed general enthusiasm for
the overseas program but also has
shown widespread dissatisfaction with
many aspects of curriculum and regu
lations.
The poll was administered to Italy
XII and France XII at the end of the
summer quarter, the end of their
overseas experience. Such a poll of
student feelings concerning the over
seas program had never been taken
before. The questionnaire sought stu
dent sentiment on facilities, programs,
courses, regulations, and expenses,
using an "excellent-good-fair-poor" rat
ing system.
Italy XII reported 90 per cent rat
ing the location of the campus as ex
cellent while the Tours location re
ceived a rating of good from a pre
dominate 63 per cent. The poll re
ceived inconclusive results from ques
tions on the facilities of the campuses.
However both campuses did uniformly
criticize facilities for study. On the
crucial and much discussed question

of food, France XII showed a fair to
poor rating while Italy responded
good to excellent.
Meeting Local People
Great difference of reaction was re
ceived by a question on contact with
the local people. France responded
that almost 70 per cent had contact
either often or very often. In Italy
nearly 70 per cent stated they had
contact with the Florentines seldom
or never.
Reaction to the culture courses
taught at the campuses was mixed,
as were ratings of the courses taught
by American professors. Language
courses were generally reported at
both campuses as good to excellent.
On the question of academic load,
over 70 per cent of the students in
France XII replied that it was too
heavy while in Italy only 40 per cent
replied in this way. Asked what was
the ideal number of units to be taken
overseas, 77 per cent in Italy and 78
per cent in France stated 14, to re
place the present sixteen.
