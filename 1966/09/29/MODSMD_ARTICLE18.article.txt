# Polo Team Plays SFS In Opener
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Stanford's water polo team,
the deepest and most explosive
ever to play in the Farm Pond,
opens what it hopes to be a na
tional championship season this
afternoon. The swimming In
dians take the court at 3:30
against San Francisco State, in
Stanford's Encina Pool.
Saturday morning at 11:00,
the poloists face a severe early
season test against an All Star
Stanford alumni squad.
The varsity will have to con
vince five members of Stan
ford's 1963 national champion
polo team, twice Olympic
swimmer George Harrison, and
standouts from the 1964 varsity
that this year's contingent really
is Stanford's best ever.
San Francisco State has al
ways fielded solid water polo
teams, but has never pushed the
Indians into a tight spot. SFS
should give the Indians a good
game, but Stanford should
chalk up its first 1966 win with
out straining to the limits.
Ten Men Could Start
Stanford's starting line-up is
not decided yet. Coach Jim
Gaughran must make a decision
between some ten field players
of nearly equally outstanding
ability.
Mark Parmely, chosen as the
Most Valuable Player in the Nor
Cal Open Tournament last sea
son, played all summer with na
tional champion Foothill Aquatic
Club, and will have Bome new
tricks In the bag for 1966.
Bill Meyer, who ran second to
Ready in scoring last season,
will be working to retain his
position this season.
Sorem Keeps Goal
Mike Sorem returns as the In
dians' goal tender. The senior
veteran played with Foothill AC
during the summer, and is ready
to play impregnable.
Transfer John Parker played
first string with Sheerer on
Foothill's AAU squad last sum
mer, and will do considerable
damage to the San Francisco
State goal.
Doug Jensen and Bill Derrig',
both with two years of varsity
experience tucked into their

suits, will be two bastions of the
Tribe's forward wall.
Greg- Bucking-ham, world 200
meter individual medley record
holdre, will be hard to keep
away from a starting position.
Sophs Vie For Top Spot*
Pete Siebert and Luis Nioolao
—captain and high scorer of last
year's Papoo6e squad, respec
tively—have proven their ability
to play with the best of the var
sity in pre-season practices.
Doug Mac Lean and Walt Pot
©rbin earned letters as sopho
mores last season ,and are back
ready to fire this season. Graig
Brown completes this trio of
juniors that will add crucial
weight to Stanford's deep var
sity.
Morgan Manning and Jeff
Hammett and goalie Doug Chap
in are sophomores on the way
up in the lineup.
After the Alumni game, the
Cards lurch into a tough week,
meeting a potentially pesky San
Jose State team, a powerful,
star-packed Cal squad, and Long
Beach City College.
