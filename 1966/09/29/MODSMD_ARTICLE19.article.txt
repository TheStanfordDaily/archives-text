## Why Bucs And SF Did Not Take NL Pennant 
### Bob Thieriot 
The Los Angeles Dodgers are on the verge of winning the 1966
National League pennant and will be the first team to win consecu
tive NL pennants since the 1957-58 Braves. Many baseball fans, in
cluding most Dodger followers, feel that the Bums are not really
the best team in the league. They have no outstanding stars other
that Koufax, no .300 hitters, only one twenty game winner. The
Giants have two twenty game winners, four stars (Marichal, Mays,
McCovey, and Perry), and the Priates have six starters who bat over
.300. But the Dodgers are winning the flag.
The Pirates have great hitters, and the best double play combo
in baseball with Alley and Mazeroski. They have great power
and tremendous run scoring ability. What they lack is a pitcher who
can consistently pitch nine respectable innings. Most of their
pitchers can work six good innings, and then they crumble. By the
seventh inning the Pirate bullpen parade begins. A fan who enjoys
seeing a variety of pitchers should go to a Pirate game. The Pirates
have better speed, fielding, and hitting than the Dodgers, but they
need a man like Koufax or Marichal who will pitch over twenty
complete games per year. They just don't have anyone who they
can count on to win one particular game.
Giant Problems
The Giants have problems all over the place. Without the four
stars, the team from San Francisco would pulmet to the depths of
the basement. The Giants have only adequate fielding except in
center field. The double play team of Lanier and Fuentes is miser
able. If the Giants make a double play, it can usually be attributed
to lousy base running by the opponent or an accident. Herman
Franks played Ollie Brown in right field because of his fielding
until the manager got indigestion over Ollie's sub.23o batting aver
age. Fuentes is kept in the lineup for his hitting (.250), but he
makes errors as frequently as Mays catches fly balls.
The Giants depend on home runs fo r their offense. Hart, Mays,
and McCovey (sometimes Jesus Alou because his twitch distracts
the pitchers) are the only dependable hitters. The Giants are ninth
in the league in hitting, ahead of only the Mets. The Giants do have
three good starting pitchers—Bolin, Perry, and Marichal. In "the
Trade of the Year" they acquired Ray Sadecki, who has pitched one
(1) good game for them all year. He has won three games, but in
two of them the Giants won 8-4 and 9-5. The irony of the situation
is that he pitched a 5-1 game against the Giants early in the year.
The relief pitching is poor. Linzy is having a poor year; Lindy
McDanield has done well. But the relief corps also boasts two ex
tremely ancient relics Billy Hoeft and Bill Henry. Hoeft has lost all
three games he has pitched in; Henry has pitched less than 50
innings. A team made up of Giant castoffs who are now playing
for other teams would include—Stu Miller, Eddie Fisher, Matty and
Felipe Alou, Manny Mota, Jack Sanford, Jose Cardenal, Bill White,
Randy Hundley, Orlando Cepeda, all who are having superior years
in the major leagues. The Giants are hurting.
A Pennant Flag Without Stars
The Dodgers do not present any formidable batting heroes. But
they have virtually no weak links. Every player on the Dodger
roster is there because he is serving a real purpose; not because
the player limit is 25 and it seems stylish to carry that many play
ers, even if some are totally useless. They have a four man pitching
rotation. The Giants have five (Herbel, Sodecki, Marichal, Perry,
and Bolin), but they rotate rather wobbily; and the Pirates are adl
confused. The Dodgers have a good fielding team, a sound lineup
with all batters between .240 and .290, with most hitting above .250.
The pitching is dependable with four starters and two good relievers
in Regan and Perranoski. But all the pitchers are used consistently
except Jim Brewer, who went one month without throwing a ball
in competition, and then pitched when the Dodgers were 6 runs
behind.
The Dodgers have only one prospective candidate for the Hall
of Fame—Koufax, but they have balance. Their ballpark is tailor
made to their type of play—singles, doubles, and triples. They peck
pitchers to death. Their opponents, used to their own ballparks, con
stantly hit fiy balls to the warning track which Willie Davis gathers
in—balls which would be homers in most other parks.
The Dodgers will win the World Series because Baltimore (who
won their first pennant in 69 years) is built in the Pittsburg tradi
tion—great hitting, adequate pitching for six innings. If Baltimore
wins it will come from the bullpen; the Birds have better relief
hurling than the Pirates; at least, against the American League
they did.
