# Kung Headlines Lecture Series
## 
### 
Stanford students will have an op
portunity to hear a large number of
speakers on campus this fall, but none
will speak at the Tuesday Evening
Series. This lecture program, the old
est on campus, no longer exists.
Actually, only the name is gone,
Agnes Nohrnberg, Director of Public
Events, noted, that the Stanford Lec
ture Committee will continue to bring
many noted speakers to campus this
quarter, but their lectures will not
necessarily be on Tuesday night.
"If anything, the number of lec
tures is greater this year than previ
ously," she commented, "it's just that
it proved impractical to regularly
schedule them on Tuesday night."
The Reverend Hans Kung, Swiss
bom international leader in the ecu
menical movement, heads the list of
speakers coming to Stanford in Oc
tober.
