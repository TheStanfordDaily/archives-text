## Liberals In Ripon Society Just Imitation Democrats? 
### William F. Buckley, Jr 
Congressman John Ashbrook,
who is by all odds the most ex
citing young man in the Repub
lic'-i'! Party, has completed a
Study for the American Con
servative Union on the activities
and interests of The Ripon So
ciety, an organization of liberal
eastern seaboard intellectuals
which will not rest until the Re
publican Party becomes an ex
act duplicate of the Democratic
Party, give or take a shadow
here or there.
The study is particularly in
teresting reading midway
through the congressional cam
paign, which reminds us of the
fracture within the Republican
1 rty and its consequent inca
pacity to strike out with a
single voice against the deficien

cies of the present Administra
tion. The reason for the prevail
ing impotence is less a lack of
imagination by Republican con
servatives or the strength of Re
publican liberals, than the fact
of the Republican torment issu
ing out of the defeat of 1964: the
great fear to speak out as Barry
Goldwater did lest, like Barry
Goldwater, the Republicans
should once again be over
whelmed.
Great Handle
That is the great handle of
The Ripon Society and Repub
lican liberals throughout the
country, the disastrous conse
quences of the Goldwater nomi
nation. Congressman Ashbrook
looks at the figures for 1964 and
furnishes a moderate historical
context which serves to put
them in focus; after which he
draws a significant conclusion.
In the year of the Great De
feat under the leadership of
Goldwater, the GOP lost: 2 gov
ernors — but on the other hand
elected 3, for a net gain of 1.
The GOP also lost 2 senators,
and 38 congressmen.
But go back to 1948, when the
Party was being led by Thomas
E. Dewey, a 24-karat representa
tive of the liberal wing of the
GOP. The GOP lost: 7 gover
nors; 9 senators; 75 congress
men.
Progressive Moderation
Nineteen hundred and fifty
eight was late in the golden
summer of the Eisenhower Ad
ministration — six years for the
country to bask in progressive
moderation, as President Eisen
hower triumphantly called it.
That November the GOP lost:
5 governors, 13 senators, 48
congressmen.
What happened to the GOP
nation-wide, Congressman Ash
brook suggests, cannot then so
easily be blamed on Goldwater,
unless we are also to blame
Dewey and Eisenhower for loss
es more spectacular—in which
case what have we learned from
this conscientious allocation of
blame?
The Big 1 Thinkers
What is happening, says Ash
brook bluntly, is that the Repub
lican Party is losing strength a3
a national party. Yet what is re
markable—Ashbrook goes on to
show—is that although liberal
Republicans here and there
score publicized victories, little
by little, state by state, congres
sional district by congressional
district, the grass-roots GOP
voters are emphatically indica
ting their preference for a con
servative politics, as against
such a politics as the bigthink
ers of The Ripon Society are en
dorsing in the name of the fu
ture of the Republican Party.
Mr. Ashbrook analyzes in de
tail the various alliances and
commitments of The Ripon So
ciety and its affiliates. Their
magazine, Advance, folded—for
lack of support. The Republican
Governors Association was pro
grammed as the great instru
ment of liberal Governor Smy
lie of Idaho. Only Governor
Smylie was beaten by a conser
vative in the primary.
Melancholy Public
Mr. Ashbrook further points
out... the prospects of taking
over the Young Republican or
ganization, which will climax at
the biennial meeting in Omaha
next year, already look forlorn
. . . the melancholy public ad
mission by the Council of Re
publican Organizations that as
things now look, the Republican
Convention in 1968 will be domi
nated by the same people who
dominated the Convention of
1964 . . . the strange and feline
behavior of representatives of
the liberal groups—e.g. . . . The
Ripon Society's scolding of GOP
House Leader Gerald Ford for
attending the 10th Anniversary
Dinner of National Review last
fall, though they'd have wel
comed him at the fund-raiser
for The Ripon Society's organ,
Advance, in 1963.
There is a great deal of inter
esting material in the report, a
fair summary of which is a) the
Republican Party is diminishing
in strength, but the convictions
of the majority of Republicans
are not altering; and b) the re
form-Republicans have shown
neither that the Party would in
crease in strength by becoming
more liberal, nor in allure to
young voters or activists or even
intellectuals. The Ripon people
have in effect proved only that
if the whole lot of them went
over to the Democratic Party,
the Republican Party would not
oven feel the tremor.

quences of the Goldwater nomi
nation. Congressman Ashbrook
looks at the figures for 1964 and
furnishes a moderate historical
context which serves to put
them in focus; after which he
draws a significant conclusion.
In the year of the Great De
feat under the leadership of
Goldwater, the GOP lost: 2 gov
ernors — but on the other hand
elected 3, for a net gain of 1.
The GOP also lost 2 senators,
and 38 congressmen.
But go back to 1948, when the
Party was being led by Thomas
E. Dewey, a 24-karat representa
tive of the liberal wing of the
GOP. The GOP lost: 7 gover
nors; 9 senators; 75 congress
men.
Progressive Moderation
Nineteen hundred and fifty
eight was late in the golden
summer of the Eisenhower Ad
ministration — six years for the
country to bask in progressive
moderation, as President Eisen
hower triumphantly called it.
That November the GOP lost:
5 governors, 13 senators, 48
congressmen.
What happened to the GOP
nation-wide, Congressman Ash
brook suggests, cannot then so
easily be blamed on Goldwater,
unless we are also to blame
Dewey and Eisenhower for loss
es more spectacular—in which
case what have we learned from
this conscientious allocation of
blame?
The Big 1 Thinkers
What is happening, says Ash
brook bluntly, is that the Repub
lican Party is losing strength a3
a national party. Yet what is re
markable—Ashbrook goes on to
show—is that although liberal
Republicans here and there
score publicized victories, little
by little, state by state, congres
sional district by congressional
district, the grass-roots GOP
voters are emphatically indica
ting their preference for a con
servative politics, as against
such a politics as the bigthink
ers of The Ripon Society are en
dorsing in the name of the fu
ture of the Republican Party.
Mr. Ashbrook analyzes in de
tail the various alliances and
commitments of The Ripon So
ciety and its affiliates. Their
magazine, Advance, folded—for
lack of support. The Republican
Governors Association was pro
grammed as the great instru
ment of liberal Governor Smy
lie of Idaho. Only Governor
Smylie was beaten by a conser
vative in the primary.
Melancholy Public
Mr. Ashbrook further points
out... the prospects of taking
over the Young Republican or
ganization, which will climax at
the biennial meeting in Omaha
next year, already look forlorn
. . . the melancholy public ad
mission by the Council of Re
publican Organizations that as
things now look, the Republican
Convention in 1968 will be domi
nated by the same people who
dominated the Convention of
1964 . . . the strange and feline
behavior of representatives of
the liberal groups—e.g. . . . The
Ripon Society's scolding of GOP
House Leader Gerald Ford for
attending the 10th Anniversary
Dinner of National Review last
fall, though they'd have wel
comed him at the fund-raiser
for The Ripon Society's organ,
Advance, in 1963.
There is a great deal of inter
esting material in the report, a
fair summary of which is a) the
Republican Party is diminishing
in strength, but the convictions
of the majority of Republicans
are not altering; and b) the re
form-Republicans have shown
neither that the Party would in
crease in strength by becoming
more liberal, nor in allure to
young voters or activists or even
intellectuals. The Ripon people
have in effect proved only that
if the whole lot of them went
over to the Democratic Party,
the Republican Party would not
oven feel the tremor.
Congressman John Ashbrook,
who is by all odds the most ex
citing young man in the Repub
lic'-i'! Party, has completed a
Study for the American Con
servative Union on the activities
and interests of The Ripon So
ciety, an organization of liberal
eastern seaboard intellectuals
which will not rest until the Re
publican Party becomes an ex
act duplicate of the Democratic
Party, give or take a shadow
here or there.
The study is particularly in
teresting reading midway
through the congressional cam
paign, which reminds us of the
fracture within the Republican
1 rty and its consequent inca
pacity to strike out with a
single voice against the deficien

cies of the present Administra
tion. The reason for the prevail
ing impotence is less a lack of
imagination by Republican con
servatives or the strength of Re
publican liberals, than the fact
of the Republican torment issu
ing out of the defeat of 1964: the
great fear to speak out as Barry
Goldwater did lest, like Barry
Goldwater, the Republicans
should once again be over
whelmed.

case what have we learned from
this conscientious allocation of
blame?
The Big 1 Thinkers
What is happening, says Ash
brook bluntly, is that the Repub
lican Party is losing strength a3
a national party. Yet what is re
markable—Ashbrook goes on to
show—is that although liberal
Republicans here and there
score publicized victories, little
by little, state by state, congres
sional district by congressional
district, the grass-roots GOP
voters are emphatically indica
ting their preference for a con
servative politics, as against
such a politics as the bigthink
ers of The Ripon Society are en
dorsing in the name of the fu
ture of the Republican Party.
Mr. Ashbrook analyzes in de
tail the various alliances and
commitments of The Ripon So
ciety and its affiliates. Their
magazine, Advance, folded—for
lack of support. The Republican
Governors Association was pro
grammed as the great instru
ment of liberal Governor Smy
lie of Idaho. Only Governor
Smylie was beaten by a conser
vative in the primary.
Melancholy Public
Mr. Ashbrook further points
out... the prospects of taking
over the Young Republican or
ganization, which will climax at
the biennial meeting in Omaha
next year, already look forlorn
. . . the melancholy public ad
mission by the Council of Re
publican Organizations that as
things now look, the Republican
Convention in 1968 will be domi
nated by the same people who
dominated the Convention of
1964 . . . the strange and feline
behavior of representatives of
the liberal groups—e.g. . . . The
Ripon Society's scolding of GOP
House Leader Gerald Ford for
attending the 10th Anniversary
Dinner of National Review last
fall, though they'd have wel
comed him at the fund-raiser
for The Ripon Society's organ,
Advance, in 1963.
There is a great deal of inter
esting material in the report, a
fair summary of which is a) the
Republican Party is diminishing
in strength, but the convictions
of the majority of Republicans
are not altering; and b) the re
form-Republicans have shown
neither that the Party would in
crease in strength by becoming
more liberal, nor in allure to
young voters or activists or even
intellectuals. The Ripon people
have in effect proved only that
if the whole lot of them went
over to the Democratic Party,
the Republican Party would not
oven feel the tremor.
Congressman John Ashbrook,
who is by all odds the most ex
citing young man in the Repub
lic'-i'! Party, has completed a
Study for the American Con
servative Union on the activities
and interests of The Ripon So
ciety, an organization of liberal
eastern seaboard intellectuals
which will not rest until the Re
publican Party becomes an ex
act duplicate of the Democratic
Party, give or take a shadow
here or there.
The study is particularly in
teresting reading midway
through the congressional cam
paign, which reminds us of the
fracture within the Republican
1 rty and its consequent inca
pacity to strike out with a
single voice against the deficien

cies of the present Administra
tion. The reason for the prevail
ing impotence is less a lack of
imagination by Republican con
servatives or the strength of Re
publican liberals, than the fact
of the Republican torment issu
ing out of the defeat of 1964: the
great fear to speak out as Barry
Goldwater did lest, like Barry
Goldwater, the Republicans
should once again be over
whelmed.
Great Handle
That is the great handle of
The Ripon Society and Repub
lican liberals throughout the
country, the disastrous conse
quences of the Goldwater nomi
nation. Congressman Ashbrook
looks at the figures for 1964 and
furnishes a moderate historical
context which serves to put
them in focus; after which he
draws a significant conclusion.
In the year of the Great De
feat under the leadership of
Goldwater, the GOP lost: 2 gov
ernors — but on the other hand
elected 3, for a net gain of 1.
The GOP also lost 2 senators,
and 38 congressmen.
But go back to 1948, when the
Party was being led by Thomas
E. Dewey, a 24-karat representa
tive of the liberal wing of the
GOP. The GOP lost: 7 gover
nors; 9 senators; 75 congress
men.
Progressive Moderation
Nineteen hundred and fifty
eight was late in the golden
summer of the Eisenhower Ad
ministration — six years for the
country to bask in progressive
moderation, as President Eisen
hower triumphantly called it.
That November the GOP lost:
5 governors, 13 senators, 48
congressmen.
What happened to the GOP
nation-wide, Congressman Ash
brook suggests, cannot then so
easily be blamed on Goldwater,
unless we are also to blame
Dewey and Eisenhower for loss
es more spectacular—in which
case what have we learned from
this conscientious allocation of
blame?
