# Flames Drowned By Fire Fighters
## 
### 
A small brush fire broke late yes
terday in the eucalyptus grove ad
jacent to the football stadium. No
damage to property resulted.
Two pumpers responded to a call
from an unidentified passer-by about
4 p.m. The fire burned less than a
quarter of an acre before firemen ar
rived.
Fire officials discounted the possi
bility of spontaneous combustion. The
brush fire may have been started by
a cigarette butt left by a motorist
parking in the grove.
The fire came within thirty feet of
restroom facilities located on the west
side on Embarcadero, near the sta
dium parking area, but no damage
was done.
A police officer on the scene empha
sized the high fire hazard due to high
temperature and dry countryside pres
ently prevailing in the fields and hills
hurrounding the campus.
