# Japanese No Drama To Show
## 
### 
A highly unusual form of entertain
ment, a complete Japanese No drama,
will be presented tonight at 8:G0 p.m.
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
The Hosho No troupe, on tour in
America, will present the 500-year old
classic "Sumidagawa." The story deals
with a middle-aged widow of Kyoto,
whose only son is kidnaped and taken
to Northern Japan. Her lengthy
search for him concludes with her ar
rival on the banks of the Sumida
River, where funeral services are be
ing held for her boy.
Drama Adapted
"Sumidagawa," written early in the
1400's, has been adapted for the Ka
buki stage and recently it was made
into a new opera, "Curlew River," by
Benjamin Britten. All the parts are
played either by men or boys, who
perform with masks and lavish cos
tumes. Music is provided by a flute
and a variety of drums.
The Hosho School of No, one of the
four Japanese schools of traditional
No drama, was established in the
fourteenth century. Fusao Hosho, cur
rent head of the company and princi
pal actor, is a lineal descendent of the
original founder of the company.
The No troupe's Stanford appear
ance is co-sponsored by the Depart
ments of Asian Languages, Speech
and Drama, the Committee on Pub
lic Exercises and the Committee on
East Asian Studies.
