# Registrar Harvey Hall Explains New 'Pass-Fail' Grading System
## 
### 
"Pass-fail" grading, to a limited
extent, has come to Stanford. By a re
cent ruling of the Academic Council,
students will be able to receive marks
of "pass" or "fail" instead of the
conventional "A" through "F" grades
in a restricted number of classes,
starting this quarter.
In his four undergraduate years, a
student may elect as many as twenty
seven units to be graded "pass-fail."
General Studies and courses in a stu
dent's major subject may not be in
cluded in the new system. Only one
"pass-fail" course may be chosen each
quarter.
According to Dr. Harvey Hall, reg
istrar, grades equivalent to a "D" or
better would be labled "pass." Hours
graded "pass" or "fail" will count to
wards graduation but will not be in
cluded in the computation of grade
point averages.
Consult Instructor
Dr. Hall explained that this quarter
a student wishing to be graded "pass"
or "fail" in a course should consult
the instructor, who will report the de
cision on his mid-quarter report. Next
quarter, added Dr. Hall, the Univer
-sity will probably provide "pass-fail"
declaration forms to be signed by the
student and instructor at the begin
ning of the quarter.
Numerous questions involving in
terpretations of the new ruling have
been directed to the registrar's office,
reported Dr. Hall. One of the most fre
quent concerns courses which can be
included in general studies but are
taken after a student has fulfilled his
requirement. These, he said, were defi
nitely eligible for "pass-fail." "It is
not the course but the way a student
used it that determines its eligibility."
The eligibility of courses taken to
fulfill requirements for a minor has
not been completely resolved, Dr. Hall
stated. He explained that since
"courses required for graduation by
the major department" are ineligible,
the present interpretation is that

minors may not be taken "pass" or
"fail."
Some Confusion
Citing a third area of confusion, Dr.
Hall mentioned that if a student takes
a "pass-fail" course and later declares
his major in that department, "the
department concerned will determine
if the course may be used for the
major.
The purpose of the new system is to
give a student an increased amount
of freedom in choosing courses out
side his major. One junior economics
major, for example, stated that he
would now be able to take a math

series without endangering his grade
point average.
Reaction Favorable
According to Dr. Hall, both student
and faculty reaction has been com
pletely favorable. The extent to which
students are electing to take courses
"pass-fail" will not be known until
mid-quarter, however, when faculty
reports are submitted.
The innovation is a three-year ex
periment that will be reviewed by the
Committee on Undergraduate Educa
tion at the end of the third year. Dr.
Hall predicts that it will be "indeed a
success."
