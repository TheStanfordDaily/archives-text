helping the International Red Cross
was somewho Un-American," he said.
"Our strategy was to rely on the
First Amendment," said Anton. He ex

plained that witnesses told the Com

lated nothing which violated the prin
ciple of the right of free association.
"McRae wouldn't name names on
the grounds that the question nauseat

smart-alecky, but showed that the
Committee deserved no respect," he
said.

of SCPV members to the Committee.
Stuart McRae summarized HUAC's
strategy:
"HUCA has attacked all protest

people in any movement, and if they
can find Communists, that's good," he
said.
