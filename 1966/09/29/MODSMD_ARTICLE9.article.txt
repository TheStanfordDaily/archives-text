## 
### 
Enrollment at Stanford University
approached the 11,000 mark at the
close of the two day registration per
iod, according to Registrar Harvey
Hall.
The statistics show 10,974, an In
crease of 353 students over last year.
The number of men increased 296
to a total of 8524 and the number of
women rose by 57 to a total of 2450.
Students registered for their final
quarter of graduate work totaled 388,
an increase of 106. The grand total
includes 450 students in the School of
Law, who registered and began stu
dies on September 7.
The figure includes both graduate

Students have until October 18 to
register, and Dr. Hall said that he ex
pected registration to reach 11,500 by
that time.
Some of the increased enrollment
comes from the opening of two new
overseas campuses in England and in
Austria. These two campuses can
house an additional 160 students.
Another year at Stanford begins as
thousands of students fight the lines
giving up their $525 in tuition to fill
Stanford coffers.
One Stanford student, Alpha sort

day once a quarter reminded him
that sometimes he was not a Stanford
student but a Stanford statistic.
