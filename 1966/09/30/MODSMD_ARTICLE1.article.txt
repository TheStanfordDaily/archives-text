• House Passes Poverty Bill
WASHINGTON — The House passed the
Administration's $1.75-billion anti-poverty bill
last night but tightened Congressional control
over the program and added curbs on spend
ing.
Passage came after Republicans, rebuffed
in their efforts to make any major changes
in the bill, tried to kill it outright and almost
succeeded. The bill now goes to the senate.
• Senate Dumps Defense Bill
WASHINGTON—The Senate fired the huge
$58 billion defense appropriation bill—and its
reserves call-up hot potato—back to the House
yesterday.
By a voice vote the Senate approved a mo
tion by Sen. Richard B. Russell, D-Ga., to re
ject a House-passed compromise version of
the defense bill and send it back into coffer-

Russell said he aimed to insist that the
House have a record vote on his amendment,
which was included in the Senate version of
the big appropriation bill, that would give the
President power to call into active duty in
dividual reservists and national guardsmen
whose only active service has been for train
ing.
• JSetv Cabinet Post Okayed
WASHINGTON —A bill to set up a Depart
ment of Transportation—the 12th Cabinet
level department—passed the Senate yester
day, 64 to 2.
Somewhat rewritten from the form pro
posed by President Johnson, the measure was
sent to conference with the House, which
passed a substantially similar bill Aug. 30.
Leaders expect quick agreement on the Sen
ate-House differences.

incidents, which were squelched by about 600
law officers patrolling in squad cars, four men
to a vehicle.
• St. Negroes Protest

about, but that there had been no repeat of
vandalism that broke out last night after a
march on the headquarters.
