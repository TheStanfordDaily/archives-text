# Phi Sigs Feature Go-Go Girls For Post-Game Entertainment
## 
### 
The second annual Battle of
the Go-Go Girls, sponsored by
Phi Sigma Kappa, will be held
at an all-campus dance following
the Tulane game Saturday.
The dance, to be held on the
Phi Sig lawn, will feature music
by William Penn and his Pals
and dancing by six go-go girls
from the Tiger a Go-Go, Whis
key a Go-Go, Brass Rail, and El
Cid.
The girls were carefully se
lected by a Phi Sig committee
headed by Gene Mazenko, Rust,

Mason, and Joe Kinsella. Each
girl was rated according to pre
cise standards for selection in
eluding intellectual outlook and
world view, congeniality in a
strained group situation, ability
to adapt spontaneously, and per
sonal characteristics, such as
a winning smile or attractive
eyes, which could hold the audi
ence's attention.
The winner of the Battle of
the Go-Go Girls will be selected
by audience reaction.
