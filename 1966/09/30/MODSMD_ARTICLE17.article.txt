Stanford Medical School phy
sicians searching for new meth
ods of treatment for patients
with acute respiratory problems
recently received a three-vear

grant of $248,000 to continue
their efforts.
The grant to a team of an
esthesiologists headed by Dr.
John P. Bunker, professor and
head of the Department of An
esthesia, comes from the John A.
Hartford Foundation, Inc. of
New York. It brings to more than
half a million dollars the amount
that Stanford has received from
the foundation for research in
the management of acute dis
turbances in respiration since
1963.
In a progress report on the re
search, Dr. Bunker said that sci
entists are finally beginning to
understand some of the causes
and the course of respiratory
complications that follow di
sease, accidents, and surgery.
There are three general areas
of investigation:
• Respiratory problems result
ing from mechanical limitations
of breathing—due to surgery
of the upper abdomen, chest,
injuries, and such diseases as
polio, tetanus, and myathenia
gravis.
• The effect of drugs and cer
tain metabolic diseases on the
brain's respiratory center.
• The course of infections
that is a frequent complication
of low level lung ventilation—
and the question whether the
microorganims are the patient's
own or from other sources.
Dr. Grant Fletcher, assistant
professor of anesthesia, is in
direct charge of the program in
the intensive care ward hospital
where the clinical research is
being conducted. The third mem
ber of the team is Dr. J. Weldon
Bellville, professor of anesthesia,
who is directing the research
into the role of drugs and di
ease in the nervous system's
control of breathing.
