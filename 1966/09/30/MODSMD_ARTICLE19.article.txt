The Jefferson Airplane, a new
and popular combo which got
its start at a San Francisco
night club, specializes in folk
rock and has had enthusiastic

support from Jazz Critic Ralph
Gleason.
The Butterfield Blues Band,
a Chicago group, specializes in
"sound and soul, where folk
blues-rock and jazz unite."
The six-piece band utilizes
electronic amplification for its
"big-beat" effect and consists of
two guitars, harmonica, organ,
bass, and drums.
National recognition was ac
corded the Rutterfield aggrega
tion during the summer of
1965, when the Newport Folk
Festival relaxed its ban against
electronic instruments to let
them appear.
Both groups also scored a hit
at the Monterey Jazz Festival,
Sept. 17-18.
