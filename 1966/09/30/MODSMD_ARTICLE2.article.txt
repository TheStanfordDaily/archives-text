# Girls Protest Necessity Of Dorm Living
## 
### BOB FISHMAN 
Stanford women are hard to satis
fy-
First, they wanted—and won—new
social regs. Now they are petitioning
to share in the ultimate male privi
lege—the right to move off-campus.
Janet Howell, a senior English ma
jor and leader of the movement, has
drawn up an "Undergraduate Wom
en's Bill of Rights" to protest this
"discrimination."
"This is not a grim student rebel
lion or a protest against dorms. We
just want the same rights men have."
Miss Howell pointed out that "a tra
ditional prejudice at Stanford is
against its most popular minority—
the Undergraduate Women."
"Only a Male ..
"The basic issue," she adds, "is that
women should not be forced to live
on campus for four years while men
must only one year. Why should be
ing a woman cancel your option to
choose where you want to live? Only
a male supremacist or a little old
> ady would try to argue that you are
in need of confinement to campus be
cause you could not cope with life in
the big city- Palo Alto."
In addition, Miss Howell comment
ed that the "protection" a dorm of
fers is "by and large unnecessary."
She charged, moreover, that "cam
pus dorms are sterile."
"With the completion of Moore-
Jacks Hall," she said, "women will be
given the choice of three sterile, mod
ern dorms in which to live. The .Row
Houses are programmed by the Plan
ning Office to be closed down when
the new dorm is finished. Individual
hoice of dwelling would then be to
tally limited."
Dorms Sterile
The movement claims that campus
dorms are more costly as well as
sterile.
"Women pay for much more than
heir accomodations are worth be
cause they must live in University
Housing," said Miss Howell.
She claimed that women could cut
their expenses by a third if they move
off-campus.
"Dorm life," she added, "can be a
great experience, but it should be
ours by choice, not imposition."
Miss Howell cautioned that "sign
ing the petition means you agree that
women should be treated equally in
this matter, not that you wish to
move off campus or protest dorm
life."
The movement has placed copies of
the petition in strategic places
throughout the campus. A copy is in
each house of Florence Moore, La
gunita, and the Row.
Freshman Cooperation
Miss Howell pointed out that fresh
man cooperation is especially impor
tant if the movement is to succeed.
"After all," she remarked, "they
have the largest stake in the whole
thing."
She requested that freshmen who
are interested in the movement con
tact her at 321-8969.
On Friday, members of the move
ment will roam the campus armed
vith petitions. A table will also be
set up at noon in front of the Post
Office.
The movement has also stationed
supporters in the dorms. Peggy
Tonkogon is in Lagunita and Judy
Ancel in Florence Moore. Representa
tives are still needed for the Row
Houses and the freshman dorms.
"Creative tactics are welcome from
anyone," said Miss Howell, "even
from men."
