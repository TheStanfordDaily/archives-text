# What Hath Watts Wrought--Hunter's Point?
## Careful, Boy 
### 
(Editor's Note: The following
is Associate Editor Kirk Han
en's account of what lie saw ami
heard last night in the Hunter's
Point district, of San Francisco.)
By KIRK HAN EN
"Better not take no pictures,
you white bastard or we'll come
back and take care of you, here!
And you better be gone when we
come back."
Those are words a reporter
takes seriously when the speak
er has four apparently drunk
friends to back him up.

Insults
It's typical of the insults vis
ited upon the white newsman—
especially when he carries a
camera at Third and Newcomb
streets in the heart of the "trou
bled" Hunter's Point district of
San Francisco.
What I saw in Hunter's Point
last night make me glad I wasn't
there when both sides were
shooting for keeps. Bullet holes,
broken glass, and hastily
boarded-up store fronts were
everywhere.

I parked my car in front of a
beauty salon on Third street
about a block north of New
comb and immediately noticed a
sign on its door: "SOUL SIS
TERS and Blood Brother." I
asked the ladies inside if I could
take a picture of it and th<?y
very cordially agreed.
Worst Over
I asked the proprietor, Mrs.
y/.i r nr> Reed, if she thought the
worst was over:
"We never know when it's
gonna come again. Last night
the police shot it out wilh them
for 15 minutes over there (she
pointed to the Bayview Com
munity Center). We saw the
whole thing."
I thanked Mrs. Reed and her
companions and hurried out the
door towards the Center which
by then was filling up. I got
halfway flown the block when I
heard the ladies yelling at me
to come back into the safety of
the shop.
Their advise was sound and
timely:
Camera
"You'd better keep your dis
tance with that camera. They

hate people to take pictures of
them. They'll stomp you and
your camera into the ground and
ask questions later. We all saw
it happen yesterday."
As I crossed the street I saw
two car loads of police and High
way Patrol officers talking with
the approximately 50 Negroes
who hadn't gone inside the bul
let-riddled Bayview Community
Center.
Ann Band
A young Negro wearing a
white arm band shouted a warn
ing to all within earshot to get
off the streets, adding "Shelley's
threatened to haul us all in."
The arm band signified mem
bership in a sort of ad hoe po
lice force. I asked one of the
members who its sponsor was:
"The Community."
Which Community?
"Why, you know . . . ah . . .
the community of us people."
'Cool It'
Another member came by and
said simply, "Cool it, Baby," and
my interviewee became suddenly
reticent.
Over on the next block, a

group of milling youths was
forming near two police cars.
Along with three other photog
raphers I crossed the street to
get a better look at what was
going on.
Black Beanie
A young Negro wearing a
black leather beanie sauntered
toward us, yelling:
"You come up here, and you're
gonna get whupped."
It seemed I'd heard those
words before in a similar situa
tion, only the location was dif
ferent. A white sheriff in Gre
nada, Mississippi was the speak
er, and I was in the more com
fortable position of watching
Walter Cronkite describe the ac
tion on the televoid.
Thankfully the youth's re
marks were only for show. He
walked past us without event.
Reaching the police cars, I
heard what in retrospect seems
to be a common gripe among the
youth of Hunter's Point:
"Trouble with you cats is you
don't give a f— about the little
man's problems. You're only
here to make a buck." (I al

most told him about my $25 a
month salary.)
Newsmen
You can always spot a news
man at one of these events
even if he's not carrying a cam
era or tape recorder. Chances
are he'll be sporting a shiner,
or a couple of stitches on his
face.
One of these unlucky mem
bers of the San Francisco press
corps was Lance Brisson of
KGO-TV. He was cornered by a
group of Negro youths Tuesday
night, kneed in the groin and
punched in the face with brass
kunckles.
Fred Kaplan
Another casualty was Fred
Kaplan, a transplanted Boston
ian free-lancer who is covering
the Hunter's Point "situation"
for Time and Life. Kaplan view
ed the riot scene without inci
dent Tuesday night from a low
hovering helicopter, only to be
struck on the head by one of
the chopper's blades as he was
disembarking.
As I was talking with Kaplan,
a tall red-haired youth from
San Francisco State appeared on
the street corner carting a sign
protesting the Negroes' method
of handling their grievances.
Ultimatum
He wasn't th.*re 30 second be
fore Negro youths from the
Community Center meeting
across the street delivered an ul
timatum: leave or they'd tear up
the sign. It didn't take him long
to make up his mind. He headed
south on Third street apparent
ly out of danger.
I followed along to ask a few
questions. As he got to the mid
dle of the block and before I
had reached him, he was ac
costed by a Negro priest, whom
I later identified as Father
Charles Loe of the Hunter's
Point-Bayview Ministry.
As I got within hearing dis

tance, I clearly heard him say:
"Please put away the sign."
The youth resisted.
Non-Violent?
"Put away that sign or I'll
put somebody on you," he warn
ed again. Since men of God are
not violent, it seemed only fa,'»•
that he would enlist someone
else to do the dirty deed.
The priest was becoming less
and less non-violent each sec
ond and I pictured him beating
the youth with his white clerical
collar. In another few seconds I
might have had to intervene.
Just then the police arrived 10
take the protestor into protec
tive custody.
This was a distinct relief. In
a few more minutes the sign
incident could have triggered
more serious difficulty.
What Was Objection?
I stopped Father Lee and
asked him what he particularly
objected to. Again the non-vio
lent side appeared as he replied
softly:
"He was in the wrong place
at the wrong time."
How true, I thought, as Ire
membered it was after dark ar.*i
my car was three blocks away.
I excused myself and headed for
my Volkswagen. Three blocks
and I never saw a white face, all
the time cursing myself for hav
ing a "PRESS" sticker on my
front window.


An unidentified youth is about to be rescued by police after he
tried to picket a Negro meeting in Hunter's Point.

the community of us people."
'Cool It'
Another member came by and
said simply, "Cool it, Baby," and
my interviewee became suddenly
reticent.
Over on the next block, a

group of milling youths was
forming near two police cars.
Along with three other photog
raphers I crossed the street to
get a better look at what was
going on.
Black Beanie
A young Negro wearing a
black leather beanie sauntered
toward us, yelling:
"You come up here, and you're
gonna get whupped."
It seemed I'd heard those
words before in a similar situa
tion, only the location was dif
ferent. A white sheriff in Gre
nada, Mississippi was the speak
er, and I was in the more com
fortable position of watching
Walter Cronkite describe the ac
tion on the televoid.
Thankfully the youth's re
marks were only for show. He
walked past us without event.
Reaching the police cars, I
heard what in retrospect seems
to be a common gripe among the
youth of Hunter's Point:
"Trouble with you cats is you
don't give a f— about the little
man's problems. You're only
here to make a buck." (I al

most told him about my $25 a
month salary.)
Newsmen
You can always spot a news
man at one of these events
even if he's not carrying a cam
era or tape recorder. Chances
are he'll be sporting a shiner,
or a couple of stitches on his
face.
One of these unlucky mem
bers of the San Francisco press
corps was Lance Brisson of
KGO-TV. He was cornered by a
group of Negro youths Tuesday
night, kneed in the groin and
punched in the face with brass
kunckles.
Fred Kaplan
Another casualty was Fred
Kaplan, a transplanted Boston
ian free-lancer who is covering
the Hunter's Point "situation"
for Time and Life. Kaplan view
ed the riot scene without inci
dent Tuesday night from a low
hovering helicopter, only to be
struck on the head by one of
the chopper's blades as he was
disembarking.
As I was talking with Kaplan,
a tall red-haired youth from
San Francisco State appeared on
the street corner carting a sign
protesting the Negroes' method
of handling their grievances.
Ultimatum
He wasn't th.*re 30 second be
fore Negro youths from the
Community Center meeting
across the street delivered an ul
timatum: leave or they'd tear up
the sign. It didn't take him long
to make up his mind. He headed
south on Third street apparent
ly out of danger.
I followed along to ask a few
questions. As he got to the mid
dle of the block and before I
had reached him, he was ac
costed by a Negro priest, whom
I later identified as Father
Charles Loe of the Hunter's
Point-Bayview Ministry.
As I got within hearing dis

tance, I clearly heard him say:
"Please put away the sign."
The youth resisted.
Non-Violent?
"Put away that sign or I'll
put somebody on you," he warn
ed again. Since men of God are
not violent, it seemed only fa,'»•
that he would enlist someone
else to do the dirty deed.
The priest was becoming less
and less non-violent each sec
ond and I pictured him beating
the youth with his white clerical
collar. In another few seconds I
might have had to intervene.
Just then the police arrived 10
take the protestor into protec
tive custody.
This was a distinct relief. In
a few more minutes the sign
incident could have triggered
more serious difficulty.
What Was Objection?
I stopped Father Lee and
asked him what he particularly
objected to. Again the non-vio
lent side appeared as he replied
softly:
"He was in the wrong place
at the wrong time."
How true, I thought, as Ire
membered it was after dark ar.*i
my car was three blocks away.
I excused myself and headed for
my Volkswagen. Three blocks
and I never saw a white face, all
the time cursing myself for hav
ing a "PRESS" sticker on my
front window.


An unidentified youth is about to be rescued by police after he
tried to picket a Negro meeting in Hunter's Point.
(Editor's Note: The following
is Associate Editor Kirk Han
en's account of what lie saw ami
heard last night in the Hunter's
Point district, of San Francisco.)
By KIRK HAN EN
"Better not take no pictures,
you white bastard or we'll come
back and take care of you, here!
And you better be gone when we
come back."
Those are words a reporter
takes seriously when the speak
er has four apparently drunk
friends to back him up.

Insults
It's typical of the insults vis
ited upon the white newsman—
especially when he carries a
camera at Third and Newcomb
streets in the heart of the "trou
bled" Hunter's Point district of
San Francisco.
What I saw in Hunter's Point
last night make me glad I wasn't
there when both sides were
shooting for keeps. Bullet holes,
broken glass, and hastily
boarded-up store fronts were
everywhere.

I parked my car in front of a
beauty salon on Third street
about a block north of New
comb and immediately noticed a
sign on its door: "SOUL SIS
TERS and Blood Brother." I
asked the ladies inside if I could
take a picture of it and th<?y
very cordially agreed.
Worst Over
I asked the proprietor, Mrs.
y/.i r nr> Reed, if she thought the
worst was over:
"We never know when it's
gonna come again. Last night
the police shot it out wilh them
for 15 minutes over there (she
pointed to the Bayview Com
munity Center). We saw the
whole thing."
I thanked Mrs. Reed and her
companions and hurried out the
door towards the Center which
by then was filling up. I got
halfway flown the block when I
heard the ladies yelling at me
to come back into the safety of
the shop.
Their advise was sound and
timely:
Camera
"You'd better keep your dis
tance with that camera. They

hate people to take pictures of
them. They'll stomp you and
your camera into the ground and
ask questions later. We all saw
it happen yesterday."
As I crossed the street I saw
two car loads of police and High
way Patrol officers talking with
the approximately 50 Negroes
who hadn't gone inside the bul
let-riddled Bayview Community
Center.
Ann Band
A young Negro wearing a
white arm band shouted a warn
ing to all within earshot to get
off the streets, adding "Shelley's
threatened to haul us all in."
The arm band signified mem
bership in a sort of ad hoe po
lice force. I asked one of the
members who its sponsor was:
"The Community."
Which Community?
"Why, you know . . . ah . . .
the community of us people."

had reached him, he was ac
costed by a Negro priest, whom
I later identified as Father
Charles Loe of the Hunter's
Point-Bayview Ministry.
As I got within hearing dis

tance, I clearly heard him say:
"Please put away the sign."
The youth resisted.
Non-Violent?
"Put away that sign or I'll
put somebody on you," he warn
ed again. Since men of God are
not violent, it seemed only fa,'»•
that he would enlist someone
else to do the dirty deed.
The priest was becoming less
and less non-violent each sec
ond and I pictured him beating
the youth with his white clerical
collar. In another few seconds I
might have had to intervene.
Just then the police arrived 10
take the protestor into protec
tive custody.
This was a distinct relief. In
a few more minutes the sign
incident could have triggered
more serious difficulty.
What Was Objection?
I stopped Father Lee and
asked him what he particularly
objected to. Again the non-vio
lent side appeared as he replied
softly:
"He was in the wrong place
at the wrong time."
How true, I thought, as Ire
membered it was after dark ar.*i
my car was three blocks away.
I excused myself and headed for
my Volkswagen. Three blocks
and I never saw a white face, all
the time cursing myself for hav
ing a "PRESS" sticker on my
front window.


An unidentified youth is about to be rescued by police after he
tried to picket a Negro meeting in Hunter's Point.
(Editor's Note: The following
is Associate Editor Kirk Han
en's account of what lie saw ami
heard last night in the Hunter's
Point district, of San Francisco.)
By KIRK HAN EN
"Better not take no pictures,
you white bastard or we'll come
back and take care of you, here!
And you better be gone when we
come back."
Those are words a reporter
takes seriously when the speak
er has four apparently drunk
friends to back him up.

Insults
It's typical of the insults vis
ited upon the white newsman—
especially when he carries a
camera at Third and Newcomb
streets in the heart of the "trou
bled" Hunter's Point district of
San Francisco.
What I saw in Hunter's Point
last night make me glad I wasn't
there when both sides were
shooting for keeps. Bullet holes,
broken glass, and hastily
boarded-up store fronts were
everywhere.

I parked my car in front of a
beauty salon on Third street
about a block north of New
comb and immediately noticed a
sign on its door: "SOUL SIS
TERS and Blood Brother." I
asked the ladies inside if I could
take a picture of it and th<?y
very cordially agreed.
Worst Over
I asked the proprietor, Mrs.
y/.i r nr> Reed, if she thought the
worst was over:
"We never know when it's
gonna come again. Last night
the police shot it out wilh them
for 15 minutes over there (she
pointed to the Bayview Com
munity Center). We saw the
whole thing."
I thanked Mrs. Reed and her
companions and hurried out the
door towards the Center which
by then was filling up. I got
halfway flown the block when I
heard the ladies yelling at me
to come back into the safety of
the shop.
Their advise was sound and
timely:
Camera
"You'd better keep your dis
tance with that camera. They

hate people to take pictures of
them. They'll stomp you and
your camera into the ground and
ask questions later. We all saw
it happen yesterday."
As I crossed the street I saw
two car loads of police and High
way Patrol officers talking with
the approximately 50 Negroes
who hadn't gone inside the bul
let-riddled Bayview Community
Center.
Ann Band
A young Negro wearing a
white arm band shouted a warn
ing to all within earshot to get
off the streets, adding "Shelley's
threatened to haul us all in."
The arm band signified mem
bership in a sort of ad hoe po
lice force. I asked one of the
members who its sponsor was:
"The Community."
Which Community?
"Why, you know . . . ah . . .
the community of us people."
'Cool It'
Another member came by and
said simply, "Cool it, Baby," and
my interviewee became suddenly
reticent.
Over on the next block, a

group of milling youths was
forming near two police cars.
Along with three other photog
raphers I crossed the street to
get a better look at what was
going on.
Black Beanie
A young Negro wearing a
black leather beanie sauntered
toward us, yelling:
"You come up here, and you're
gonna get whupped."
It seemed I'd heard those
words before in a similar situa
tion, only the location was dif
ferent. A white sheriff in Gre
nada, Mississippi was the speak
er, and I was in the more com
fortable position of watching
Walter Cronkite describe the ac
tion on the televoid.
Thankfully the youth's re
marks were only for show. He
walked past us without event.
Reaching the police cars, I
heard what in retrospect seems
to be a common gripe among the
youth of Hunter's Point:
"Trouble with you cats is you
don't give a f— about the little
man's problems. You're only
here to make a buck." (I al

most told him about my $25 a
month salary.)
Newsmen
You can always spot a news
man at one of these events
even if he's not carrying a cam
era or tape recorder. Chances
are he'll be sporting a shiner,
or a couple of stitches on his
face.
One of these unlucky mem
bers of the San Francisco press
corps was Lance Brisson of
KGO-TV. He was cornered by a
group of Negro youths Tuesday
night, kneed in the groin and
punched in the face with brass
kunckles.
Fred Kaplan
Another casualty was Fred
Kaplan, a transplanted Boston
ian free-lancer who is covering
the Hunter's Point "situation"
for Time and Life. Kaplan view
ed the riot scene without inci
dent Tuesday night from a low
hovering helicopter, only to be
struck on the head by one of
the chopper's blades as he was
disembarking.
As I was talking with Kaplan,
a tall red-haired youth from
San Francisco State appeared on
the street corner carting a sign
protesting the Negroes' method
of handling their grievances.
Ultimatum
He wasn't th.*re 30 second be
fore Negro youths from the
Community Center meeting
across the street delivered an ul
timatum: leave or they'd tear up
the sign. It didn't take him long
to make up his mind. He headed
south on Third street apparent
ly out of danger.
I followed along to ask a few
questions. As he got to the mid
dle of the block and before I
had reached him, he was ac
costed by a Negro priest, whom
I later identified as Father
Charles Loe of the Hunter's

very cordially agreed.
Worst Over
I asked the proprietor, Mrs.
y/.i r nr> Reed, if she thought the
worst was over:
"We never know when it's
gonna come again. Last night
the police shot it out wilh them
for 15 minutes over there (she
pointed to the Bayview Com
munity Center). We saw the
whole thing."
I thanked Mrs. Reed and her
companions and hurried out the
door towards the Center which
by then was filling up. I got
halfway flown the block when I
heard the ladies yelling at me
to come back into the safety of
the shop.
Their advise was sound and
timely:
Camera
"You'd better keep your dis
tance with that camera. They

hate people to take pictures of
them. They'll stomp you and
your camera into the ground and
ask questions later. We all saw
it happen yesterday."
As I crossed the street I saw
two car loads of police and High
way Patrol officers talking with
the approximately 50 Negroes
who hadn't gone inside the bul
let-riddled Bayview Community
Center.
Ann Band
A young Negro wearing a
white arm band shouted a warn
ing to all within earshot to get
off the streets, adding "Shelley's
threatened to haul us all in."
The arm band signified mem
bership in a sort of ad hoe po
lice force. I asked one of the
members who its sponsor was:
"The Community."
Which Community?
"Why, you know . . . ah . . .
the community of us people."
'Cool It'
Another member came by and
said simply, "Cool it, Baby," and
my interviewee became suddenly
reticent.
Over on the next block, a

group of milling youths was
forming near two police cars.
Along with three other photog
raphers I crossed the street to
get a better look at what was
going on.
Black Beanie
A young Negro wearing a
black leather beanie sauntered
toward us, yelling:
"You come up here, and you're
gonna get whupped."
It seemed I'd heard those
words before in a similar situa
tion, only the location was dif
ferent. A white sheriff in Gre
nada, Mississippi was the speak
er, and I was in the more com
fortable position of watching
Walter Cronkite describe the ac
tion on the televoid.
Thankfully the youth's re
marks were only for show. He
walked past us without event.
Reaching the police cars, I
heard what in retrospect seems
to be a common gripe among the
youth of Hunter's Point:
"Trouble with you cats is you
don't give a f— about the little
man's problems. You're only
here to make a buck." (I al

most told him about my $25 a
month salary.)
Newsmen
You can always spot a news
man at one of these events
even if he's not carrying a cam
era or tape recorder. Chances
are he'll be sporting a shiner,
or a couple of stitches on his
face.
One of these unlucky mem
bers of the San Francisco press
corps was Lance Brisson of
KGO-TV. He was cornered by a
group of Negro youths Tuesday
night, kneed in the groin and
punched in the face with brass
kunckles.
Fred Kaplan
Another casualty was Fred
Kaplan, a transplanted Boston
ian free-lancer who is covering
the Hunter's Point "situation"
for Time and Life. Kaplan view
ed the riot scene without inci
dent Tuesday night from a low
hovering helicopter, only to be
struck on the head by one of
the chopper's blades as he was
disembarking.
As I was talking with Kaplan,
a tall red-haired youth from
San Francisco State appeared on
the street corner carting a sign
protesting the Negroes' method
of handling their grievances.
Ultimatum
He wasn't th.*re 30 second be
fore Negro youths from the
Community Center meeting
across the street delivered an ul
timatum: leave or they'd tear up
the sign. It didn't take him long
to make up his mind. He headed
south on Third street apparent
ly out of danger.
I followed along to ask a few
questions. As he got to the mid
dle of the block and before I
had reached him, he was ac
costed by a Negro priest, whom
I later identified as Father
Charles Loe of the Hunter's
Point-Bayview Ministry.
As I got within hearing dis

tance, I clearly heard him say:
"Please put away the sign."
The youth resisted.
Non-Violent?
"Put away that sign or I'll
put somebody on you," he warn
ed again. Since men of God are
not violent, it seemed only fa,'»•
that he would enlist someone
else to do the dirty deed.
The priest was becoming less
and less non-violent each sec
ond and I pictured him beating
the youth with his white clerical
collar. In another few seconds I
might have had to intervene.
Just then the police arrived 10
take the protestor into protec
tive custody.
This was a distinct relief. In
a few more minutes the sign
incident could have triggered
more serious difficulty.
What Was Objection?
I stopped Father Lee and
asked him what he particularly
objected to. Again the non-vio
lent side appeared as he replied
softly:
"He was in the wrong place
at the wrong time."
How true, I thought, as Ire
membered it was after dark ar.*i
my car was three blocks away.
I excused myself and headed for
my Volkswagen. Three blocks
and I never saw a white face, all
the time cursing myself for hav
ing a "PRESS" sticker on my
front window.


An unidentified youth is about to be rescued by police after he
tried to picket a Negro meeting in Hunter's Point.
(Editor's Note: The following
is Associate Editor Kirk Han
en's account of what lie saw ami
heard last night in the Hunter's
Point district, of San Francisco.)
By KIRK HAN EN
"Better not take no pictures,
you white bastard or we'll come
back and take care of you, here!
And you better be gone when we
come back."
Those are words a reporter
takes seriously when the speak
er has four apparently drunk
friends to back him up.

Insults
It's typical of the insults vis
ited upon the white newsman—
especially when he carries a
camera at Third and Newcomb
streets in the heart of the "trou
bled" Hunter's Point district of
San Francisco.
What I saw in Hunter's Point
last night make me glad I wasn't
there when both sides were
shooting for keeps. Bullet holes,
broken glass, and hastily
boarded-up store fronts were
everywhere.

I parked my car in front of a
beauty salon on Third street
about a block north of New
comb and immediately noticed a
sign on its door: "SOUL SIS
TERS and Blood Brother." I
asked the ladies inside if I could
take a picture of it and th<?y
very cordially agreed.
Worst Over
I asked the proprietor, Mrs.
