# NO TEAM SPIRIT
## Why Is The Tribe Blowing It In '66? 
### Wells Shoemaker 
Why is the Stanford football team taking gas in 1966?
Sports Illustrated picked Stanford as the one team that could
stop the UCLA ground-gobbling machine. LOOK predicted an
8-2 record for the Tribe. This is the second year in a row that
Stanford has been tagged as the AAWU's big treat.

So far, any threat Stanford can
offer can't be taken too seriously.
The Cards fell in to a 35-7 hole at
one point in Stanford's humili
ating 35-21 defeat at the hands
of the Minnesota Gophers.
It took a two touchdown
fourth quarter rally to slip the
Indians past "second division"
San Jose State.
Mitigating Factors
Sure, San Jose was stronger
than any one predicted, and Big
Ten Minnesota got five players
back from injuries who couldn't
play in the Gophers' first game.
So, they were good. Stanford was
supposed to be good, too.
Stanford's dismal season cer
tainly can't be attributed to lack
of talent. A 1 Wilburn, Mike Hib
ler, Dave Lewis, John Guillory,
and Monty Mohrman return with
two years of AAWU veteranship.
Tribe juniors are bristling
with talent. Jack Root and Blaine
Nye have hurt opponents this
year. Don Swartz, Marty Brill,
and Tim Abena should be hurt
ing opponents in any man's
game.
Godlike Frosh
Any football coach in the coun
try would have given his right
hand for Stanford's freshman
football squad last year. The Pa
pooses crushed UCLA's frosh,
49-13, murdered San Jose 50-0,
handled USC, 24-13, and axed the
Cal Cubs, 28-13.
The freshman squad did not do
their damage with one or two
players. Coach Dick Vermeil
played a full third string for sub
stantial chunks of every game.
So Why â€” Why isn't Stanford
running over anyone they come
up against?
Are the ever-present "early
season jitters" plaguing the
Tribe. Quite possibly. After to
morrow, Stanford will be one
third through its season.

Team Spirit Absent
But perhaps a bigger factor is
Stanford football team spirit. In
dividually, on offense and de
fense, there have been a number
of outstanding performances.
But what about the team?
There appears to be no unified
team spirit among the Indians,
no driving desire to win, no de
dicated concern how Stanford
fares in 1966.
Hopefully, the Cards will dem
onstrate a switch in attitude in
tomorrow's game against small
but potentially damaging Tulane.
Let's hope so. Otherwise, Stan
ford football fans will have much
crying and little yelling in 1966.
UCLA, Illinois, and USC don't
play touch football.
