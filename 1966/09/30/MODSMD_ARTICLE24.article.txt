# FACE RUGGED ALUMNI NEXT
## Tribe Poloists Victorious, 34-1 Parmely Scores 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER Sports Editor 
Stanford's red hot water polo
squad opened its season with a
smash yesterday, obliterating
San Francisco State 34-1. Eleven
Indians shared in the scoring,
shooting an incredible 81 per
cent, contributing to the highest
point total in Stanford history.
The Indians will have a rough
er go of it tomorrow morning
at 11:00 a.m. in the Encina Pool
against the most rugged Stan
ford alumni team yet assembled.
Five members of Stanford's na
tional champion 1963 squad will
hit the water along with stand
outs from successful Tribe
squads of 1952, 1964, and 1965.
The Stanford varsity, hailed
as the best in Stanford history,
will have to convince such char
acters as Marty Hull, Bill Ready,
Peter Pettigrew, Bob Lorton,
and Jack Lorton from the 1963
varsity.
Hidl All-Time Best
Hull, All-American AAU and
All-Conference for two years,
has recovered from an eye in
fection that cut short his college
career. Hull, who played all last
summer with the San Francisco
Olympic Club, is "the best water
polo player Stanford has ever
had until now," in the words of
Jim Gaughran, Stanford varsity
coach.
Bill Ready became captain of
the Stanford team in 1964, earn
ing All-Conference honors three
times. Both Ready and Hull spe
cialize in smashing shots in from
the "hole" in front of the goal.
Ready and Hull are going to
give a good show for the audi
ence, and a good set of fits for
Stanford goalies.
Pete Pettigrew, Ail-American
AAU and three year All-Confer
ence ace, returns from the Navy
Air Force to nail little Indians.
Lorton Plays Goalie
Bob Lorton, Olympic Club
goalie since he got out of school,
will be harder to pentrate than
anything the Cards are likely to
see this year.
Jack Lorton, after three years
with Stanford and a national

championship share, will be dif
ficult to avoid.
George Harrison, twice an
Olympic swimmer, will prove
his merit as a polo player, pos
sibly to Stanford's dismay.
Ash Jones, Stanford varsity
captain in 1952-53 will be on
hand with much experience.

Jeff Beck, steady varsity play
er of 1965 who shot 50 per cent
for the season, will go against
his former teammates. Tom
Chalberg, from the 1964 varsity,
will see the 1964 freshman team
in a new light.
Pan Am team veteran Boyd
Miekley may play, along with
Dave Gildea, erstwhile Stanford
breaststroker.
Flawless Offense
Stanford's present varsity
could do no wrong yesterday.
The Indians hit better than four
of every five shots, and com
mitted only five fouls in the
entire game.
The Cards opened with a wal
loping 13 points in the first quar
ter. Mark Parmely slammed in
five of his seven goals with the
assistance of picture perfect set
up passes.
Stanford widened the margin
to 17-1 at halftime, Luis Nicolao
taking the initiative with 3 goals
in the period. The sophomore
butterfly world record holder

scored three more in the final
quarter.
Everybody Got 'Dibs'
Throughout the game Stan
ford coach Jim Gaughran kept
up a constant influx of Stan
ford players. All seventeen var
sity members played equal
amounts in the walk away romp.
Stanford scored 10 in the third
period. All-American and Na
tional AAU Outstanding Player
Gay Sheerer scored his fourth
goal in this period. Sheerer had
four assists.
Morgan Manning, not an over
anxious shooter by nature,
tallied his fourth goal in Stan
ford's 7 goal final quarter. Sen
ior Doug Jerlsen and junior
Bill Meyer each shot in three
scores in the game.
Newly elected varsity captain
Mike Sorem made 5 saves from
his goalie's position. Sophomore
goalie Doug Chapin made 7
saves against SFS. SFS, how
ever, rarely got the ball deep
enough in Indian territory to
seriously threaten.


Mark Parmely chucks one of his
seven goals past San Francisco
State's beleaguered goalie. Par
mely, a junior, was named Most
Outstanding Player In the Nor
Cal Open Tournament last year.
Eleven Indians made it into the
"coring column yesterday.
