# UCLA Is Statistical Giant; Indians Don't Fly So High
## Daily Sports 
### 
An example of the disparity
between supposedly equal teams
is 6hown in the difference be
tween UCLA's season statistics
and Stanford's season statistics.
Both the Bruins and the In
dians have had comparable
schedules. Pittsburgh, UCLA's
first foe was no Notre Dame as
the Uclans rang up some fifty
odd points. However, San Jose
State can hardly be classed a
titan of intercollegiate football
either.
In their second contest the
Bruins dismantled a good Syra
cuse team, 31-12, Meanwhile,
Stanford was losing to an aver
age to good Minnesota team,
35-21.
Statistics don't win games in
themselves, yet a concerted ef
fort on any football team's part
to march to the end zone (with
the ball) will result in both
points and yards (note that
UCLA has not lost the ball on
downs yet this season.
