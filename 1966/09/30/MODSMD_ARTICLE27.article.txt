# TRIBE 3-0 VS. TULANE
## Green Wave Inundates Farm Riding Atop Successful Crest 
### TOM EDISON 
Stanford is favored in to
morrow's game with Tulane but
the Indians have a lot of prov
ing to do after suffering a 35-21
defeat to Minnesota last week
while barely knocking over San
Jose in the season opener.
Stanford will also go into the
game with a series edge of three
victories in as many contests.
Past contests, which date back
to 1961, have been extremely
close. In their first meeting the
Indians won 9-7, in 1962 they
won 6-3, and last year they
bumped the Green Wave 16-0.
The tide, however, seems to
have changed for the Green
Wave after finishing 2-8 last

year. They have left the South
eastern Conference and also
have a new coach, Jim Pittman,
who was an assistant for Dar
rel Royal.
Things at Stanford have also
changed a little. Dave Lewis,
last year's starting quarterback,
has recovered from his shoulder
injury and will be used at the
running back spot. Junior Blaine
Nye and senior John Read will
be playing defense after spend
ing most of last year on of
fense. Although certainly not
unknown but for the most part
untested, sophomore Gene
Washington will be starting at
quarterback.
While Stanford's start has

been dismal, Tulane's has been
impressive. The Green Wave,
noted for starting slow in a
strong southern conference, has
won two straight games. Their
latest an upset over Texas A&M,
21-13. Their initial win was 13-0
over Virginia Tech.
Throwing out of the port-side
for the Green Wave will be
Bobby Duhon. Last year he be
came the first Tulane player in
over a decade to top 1,000 yards
when he amassed 1,019 yards In
total offense. He is off and sail
ing again this year, compiling
245 yards in the first two games,
evenly balanced between run
ning and passing. He has 133 on
the ground and 112 in the air.
Three Top Receivers
Among 28 returning letter
men for Tulane will be two 190-
pound ends, Lanis O'Steen and
Jerry Colquette, who will serve
as tri-captains along with tail
back Pete Johns. All three will
serve as receivers for Duhon.
Uwe Pontius will also aid Tu
lane in its scoring ways. He is
four-for-four in extra point
tries and two-for-three in field
goals with 35 and 29-yarders to
his credit.
If Saturday's game is as close
as they have been in the past,
Stanford's place-kicker Bill
Shoemaker should also be an
asset to the Indians. He has
kicked a 39-yard goal already
this yea;.
Both Trams Similar
Stanford's personnel resembles
Tulane's in many ways.
The Indians strength also
rests in its potent backfield.
Stanford has a talented quar-

terback in Gene Washington
who leads the conference in to
tal yardage with 396, 262 pass
ing and 134 rushing. Bob Blunt
along with Lewis are vgry able
receivers. Blunt has caught six
passes for 125 yards and a
touchdown.
Jack Root is Stanford's top
rusher in an unfraternal sense.
He has picked up 159 yards by
evading aggressive rushees,
averaging 4.7 yards per carry.


A 1 WLlburn luis made 10 tackles
from his defensive end position.
Wilburn, who has spet'd to
match his height and weight, has
made the only Interception for
the Indians thus far this M-ason.
