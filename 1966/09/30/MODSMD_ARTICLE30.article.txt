# Red Soccer Team Plays San Quentin
## 
### BILL GRAHAM 
Stanford's varsity soccer team
travels to San Quentin for its
first game of the season, Sun
day, October 1.
Stanford has never lost to
San Quentin in six years of
play. However, Coach Priddle
expects a "rough, tough game"
from the inmates, some of
whom have been around for a
long time.
With only nine lettermen re
turning, Priddle is worried about
his players' inexperience. He
notes hopefully that "We have
pretty good depth," and he pre
dicts the Cards will do "pretty
well" on Sunday.
The booters will have a
chance to prove their depth im
mediately. The Indians go into
Sunday's game missing three
starters. Left-inside Kenney Ny
strom and center-forward Dan
Deschert have been injured, and
fullback Chris Canlis is side
lined with mononucleosis.
Spilt Two Scrimmages
Coach Priddle's booters split
their two scrimmages, romping
over Woodside Priory, 11-1, in
the first and succumbing to San
Mateo, 7-0.
San Mateo played largely a
defensive game, and the In
dians' failure to follow up their
shots to the goal led to the
whitewash. Priddle noted tha*
the team was hurt by inexperi
ence, which caused two penal
ties to be called against the
Cards.
Douhleheader
Coach Priddle declined to
comment on the team's chance
in the Western Inter-Colleglate
Soccer Conference until he sees
the results of the first game.
However, the Cards will be up
against stiff competition in a
doubleheader against Oregon
State and San Francisco City
College, October 8.
Oregon State, a club team
which plays in an amateur
league, has already soundly
beaten San Mateo. San Francis
co was champion of the
WICSC's junior college division
last year.
Next, the Cards battle San
Jose State, October 12, in their
first league game. Priddle de
scribes the Spartans as "loaded,"
noting they have a number of
foreign students on the team.


Monty IVfohrman, a hip defen
sive tackle, has been elected co
captain for the Tulane game,
alonp with Tim Shechan and
Jack Root.

Next, the Cards battle San
Jose State, October 12, in their
first league game. Priddle de
scribes the Spartans as "loaded,"
noting they have a number of
foreign students on the team.

Stanford's varsity soccer team
travels to San Quentin for its
first game of the season, Sun
day, October 1.
Stanford has never lost to
San Quentin in six years of
play. However, Coach Priddle
expects a "rough, tough game"
from the inmates, some of
whom have been around for a
long time.
With only nine lettermen re
turning, Priddle is worried about
his players' inexperience. He
notes hopefully that "We have
pretty good depth," and he pre
dicts the Cards will do "pretty
well" on Sunday.
The booters will have a
chance to prove their depth im
mediately. The Indians go into
Sunday's game missing three
starters. Left-inside Kenney Ny
strom and center-forward Dan
Deschert have been injured, and
fullback Chris Canlis is side
lined with mononucleosis.
Spilt Two Scrimmages
Coach Priddle's booters split
their two scrimmages, romping
over Woodside Priory, 11-1, in
the first and succumbing to San
Mateo, 7-0.
San Mateo played largely a
defensive game, and the In
dians' failure to follow up their
shots to the goal led to the
whitewash. Priddle noted tha*
the team was hurt by inexperi
ence, which caused two penal
ties to be called against the
Cards.
Douhleheader
Coach Priddle declined to
comment on the team's chance
in the Western Inter-Colleglate
Soccer Conference until he sees
the results of the first game.
However, the Cards will be up
against stiff competition in a
doubleheader against Oregon
State and San Francisco City
College, October 8.
Oregon State, a club team
which plays in an amateur
league, has already soundly
beaten San Mateo. San Francis
co was champion of the
WICSC's junior college division
last year.
