THEATER
Most of the theater at Stanford is now behind the scenes filing
off the rough edges and polishing the finished product with pumice
powder. However Peter Weiss' dramatic tornado, MARAT/SADE,
described as part circus, part madness, but totally distinguished
theater, will continue at the Circle Star in San Carlos through Sun
day night.
For a change of pace, Cole Porter's frothy and saucy musical,
CAN-CAN, is scheduled to follow "Marat/Sade" for a two weeks'
engagement, opening this Tuesday. Abe Burrows wrote the book
for "Can-Can," which tells the tale about a cabaret owner who in
troduces a sensational new dance, the Can-Can, to her patrons and
gets tossed into the bastille by an over-zealous young judge.
THE IMAGINARY INVALID by Molliere also continues Fridays
and Saturday evenings, 8:30, at the Playhouse, Beach and Hyde
Streets, San Francisco. "Invalid," directed by Henry Stein, man
aging Director of the Playhouse, is a seventeenth century comedy
worth seeing.
FILMS
At the Bijou, THE RUSSIANS ARE COMING, that brilliant and
copiously funny film about a Russian invasion of America's North
east coastline, fortunately overshadows the second billing, WHAT'S
NEW PUSSY CAT. Although "Pussy" has some harried scenes
with Sellers, O'Toole, Ursula Andress, Capucine, Woody Allen and
others, the humor comes out somewhat less than a strungout
hodge-podge of quarter-wit, half-drag, and total chaos.
Have you seen DEAR JOHN yet. No? No! Nooooo. Ha Ha Haaa,
you slay me. Yes, I've seen "Dear John" and I want you to see it.
It's wonderful—dramatic, tender, exciting, wow. I loved it. So will
you. Subtitles though . . . THE LOVED ONE sharing the marquee
with "Dear John" isn't especially worth the time or mental frus
tration of sitting through.
The Tresidder film for Friday is Ingmar Bergman's classic,
THROUGH A GLASS DARKLY. Saturday night, Tresidder will
present THE MOUSE THAT ROARED in brilliant, wide-screened
laugh-a-vision. The comedy of Peter Sellers added to the raucous
plot of a tiny nation's efforts to invade the United States takes a
turn for the funnier when Sellers inadvertently captures a plu
tonium bomb that could destroy the world.
Sunday night flicks has invested in THE MOON IS BLUE for
this weeks entertainment. "Moon" is the story of a girl (Barbara
Bel Gedes) who takes every painstaking step imaginable to main
tain her virginity. This is the script in which the phrase "profes
sional virgin" first took flare and gave women the world over a flag
to rally around.
CONCERTS
ALI AKBAR KHAN, India's master musician and sarod virtuoso,
is in town. Highly acclaimed at Newport and Philharmonic Hall,
Ali Akbar will appear in his final Bay Area concert tonight at 8:30
at the Masonic Auditorium in San Francisco.

powder. However Peter Weiss' dramatic tornado, MARAT/SADE,
described as part circus, part madness, but totally distinguished
theater, will continue at the Circle Star in San Carlos through Sun
day night.
For a change of pace, Cole Porter's frothy and saucy musical,
CAN-CAN, is scheduled to follow "Marat/Sade" for a two weeks'
engagement, opening this Tuesday. Abe Burrows wrote the book
for "Can-Can," which tells the tale about a cabaret owner who in
troduces a sensational new dance, the Can-Can, to her patrons and
gets tossed into the bastille by an over-zealous young judge.
THE IMAGINARY INVALID by Molliere also continues Fridays
and Saturday evenings, 8:30, at the Playhouse, Beach and Hyde
Streets, San Francisco. "Invalid," directed by Henry Stein, man
aging Director of the Playhouse, is a seventeenth century comedy
worth seeing.
FILMS
At the Bijou, THE RUSSIANS ARE COMING, that brilliant and
copiously funny film about a Russian invasion of America's North
east coastline, fortunately overshadows the second billing, WHAT'S
NEW PUSSY CAT. Although "Pussy" has some harried scenes
with Sellers, O'Toole, Ursula Andress, Capucine, Woody Allen and
others, the humor comes out somewhat less than a strungout
hodge-podge of quarter-wit, half-drag, and total chaos.
Have you seen DEAR JOHN yet. No? No! Nooooo. Ha Ha Haaa,
you slay me. Yes, I've seen "Dear John" and I want you to see it.
It's wonderful—dramatic, tender, exciting, wow. I loved it. So will
you. Subtitles though . . . THE LOVED ONE sharing the marquee
with "Dear John" isn't especially worth the time or mental frus
tration of sitting through.
The Tresidder film for Friday is Ingmar Bergman's classic,
THROUGH A GLASS DARKLY. Saturday night, Tresidder will
present THE MOUSE THAT ROARED in brilliant, wide-screened
laugh-a-vision. The comedy of Peter Sellers added to the raucous
plot of a tiny nation's efforts to invade the United States takes a
turn for the funnier when Sellers inadvertently captures a plu
tonium bomb that could destroy the world.
Sunday night flicks has invested in THE MOON IS BLUE for
this weeks entertainment. "Moon" is the story of a girl (Barbara
Bel Gedes) who takes every painstaking step imaginable to main
tain her virginity. This is the script in which the phrase "profes
sional virgin" first took flare and gave women the world over a flag
to rally around.
CONCERTS
ALI AKBAR KHAN, India's master musician and sarod virtuoso,
is in town. Highly acclaimed at Newport and Philharmonic Hall,
Ali Akbar will appear in his final Bay Area concert tonight at 8:30
at the Masonic Auditorium in San Francisco.
THEATER
Most of the theater at Stanford is now behind the scenes filing
off the rough edges and polishing the finished product with pumice
powder. However Peter Weiss' dramatic tornado, MARAT/SADE,
described as part circus, part madness, but totally distinguished
theater, will continue at the Circle Star in San Carlos through Sun
