# From Belleville, I11. With Poitier, Steiger
## On Location 
### ANDREW WILSON 
Behind the technicolor dazzle
of the names Rod Steiger and
Sidney Poitier stand two down
to-earth men, or so it seemed to
me after Interviewing the movie
6tars between rehearsals for
their movie, "In the Heat of the
Night," on location in Belleville,
Illinois.
Mr. Steiger, whose beefy ro
tundity is mounted on a square
frame and carried with agility,
seemed more in character with
the brawny, tough-minded police
chief he is to play in the upcom
ing movie than whatever one
might expect from one of film
dom's most powerful and versa
tile dramatic actors.
Asked for an impression of
"Dr. Zhivago," in which he
played a wicked old lecher, Mr.
Steigner paused and smiled
broadly. "I liked it. For once in
my acting career I end up get
ting thp girl and damned if she
wasn't Julie Christie."
No Hesitation
He needed no hesitation to
name his favorite role.
" 'The Pawnbroker.' This was
the kind of a role an actor falls
across once in a decade if he's
lucky. We accomplished some
thing which had never been tried
before. The movie was quite a
moral victory to me because
everybody had been saying it
would be too bitter and depress
ing to ever make t*he grade. Then,
of course, it turned out to be a
great success."
As to whether after 'The
Pawnbroker" he suffered the
mental cave-in said to set some
actors awash upon completion of
a highly demanding role, Mr.
Steiger said, "Too much of this
cave-in talk is sheer bunk. Sure,
there's a let-down, but after a
couple of hours you find some
thing else to do and forget it."
Man Of Many Parts
Going into the interview I
thought that Mr. Poitier would
seem off-screen much the same
as on, which cannot be neatly
summed for he appears, and no
doubt is, a man of many contrary
parts—warm and bitter, brood
ing and stoic, easy-going and
electric.
And I found the prior impres
sion true enough, but the deep
sense of mystery which Mr. Poi
tier radiates was not cleared—
only made personally immediate.
With the exception of one sore
point which I rubbed twice and
then avoided, Mr. Poitier spoke
easily and expansively over a
range of questions.

His favorite roles, Baid Mr. Poi
tier, were "the ballsy kind where
the character must rise and meet
the challenges hurled his way.
"Lilies of the Field" (for which
he won an Academy Award) and
"Patch of Blue" are two of my
own movies which I like best.
The characters in these movies
meant something and stood up
for it."
As did Steiger, Poitier dis
counted Promethean strain in
big-time acting, saying that like
other professions it was hard but
its wear-and-tear would not any
way be the cause of his retire
ment.
"Acting is something I do be
cause it stimulates me, chal
lenges me and, ultimately, ful
fills me. When I no longer derive
this satisfaction, that's when I
stop and start hunting for some
thing new."
Sacrosanct Taciturnity
Looking ahead to his role as a
Philadelphia detective who col
laborates with a police chief
(Steiger) to solve a murder in a
deep South town, Mr. Poitier ex
claimed the movie would be "the
most tense, intense melodrama
of my career."
Asked, however, the signifi
cance which the movie intended
to draw through having a Negro
investigate the rabid confines of
a small Southern community, Mr.
Poitier refused, heatedly, to elab
orate.
Earlier Mr. Poitier would not
express his views on race rela
tions in general, saying "This is
not something you would ask a
white actor, so why do you ask
me?"
Less Mait, More Negro
This time he enthused in angry
tones how inqueries angled at
him specificly because he was
Negro would "pigeon-hole" him,
treating him as less of a man be
cause they focused on one aspect
of his person to the exclusion of
all else.
But this said, the storm sub
sided completely, as suddenly as
it had arisen. The conversation
became friendly once more and
I was sorry that, once warned, I
had not paid heed. And after
wards I thought with some
sympathy how often Mr. Poitier,
a sensitive man and much-ac
claimed Negro, must have faced
the patented questions on his
feelings concerning race.
So be it. In any case it should
be interesting to watch the con
frontation between Messrs. Poi
tier and Steiger in "In the Heat
of the Night," to be released this
summer. < ' '
