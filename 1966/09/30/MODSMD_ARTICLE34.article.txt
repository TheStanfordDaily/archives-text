# Burton Is Excellent In 'Virginia Woolf'
## 
### ANDREW WILSON 
Life is not always the way
you feel it ought to be, which
may sound like an obvious and
pointless observation, but it is a
good thing to keep in mind
when approaching criticism and
the hollowed grounds of right
reason.
So, too, with life on the giant
screen.
Seeing "Who's Afraid of Vir
ginia Woolf?" I had my enthusi
asm dampened by the feeling
that that movie was, in essence,
swollen and distended as the
egos of the four characters. And
it shared, intententionally or no,
their strangulated obsession over
concerns which were gratitous
at best.
Movie Follows Play
I mean this of the movie, not
the play, though the former
faithfully follows dialogue and
incident in Edward Albee's bi
bulous masterpiece.
To give a brief action rehash.
Two couples on a small college
faculty, George (Richard Bur
ton) and Martha (Elizabeth Tay
lor), and Nick (George Segal)
and Honey (sorry), stage an all
night orgy professorial style in
which the profanation of all that
is sacred seems the only pur
pose
Perhaps the most telling bal
ance between the movie's
strength and weakness accrued
in the unique way which the
dialogue was used. Rather than
drawing out and illuminating
the characters from a back
stage position, it was allowed to
outdo and overshadow them,
with the strange result that con
versation was sharper, more in
cisive and in its own right alto
gether more interesting than the
persons concerned (with the ex
ception of Richard Burton).
Sense Of Ridicule
When the knock-down, drag
out, drunken-mess effect was de
manded, the movie shone with
the marvelous sense of ridicule
which created moments truely
to be relished out of a scream
ing and bashing of personalities.
The "Up, yours!" mentality was
infectious and left me wishing

some of the barbed gems were
mine to drop in appropriate
times and circumstances.
Unfortunately for the greater
success of the movie, however,
once the characters had, with
damning precision, made shred
ded wheat of each others' foi
bles, little more was added. The
suggestion made that vulnera
bility did remain in the battle
fatigued relationship of George
and Martha sounded a note of
anguish too remote and flat to
lift the movie into the play's
realm of low tragedy.
The deficit was glaring, to my
mind, when in humility brought
of recent frustration Martha told
the young up start Nick—who
had recently seduced her and
then failed—that of all the peo
ple in her unhappy life only
George had ever made her feel a
whole person.
Strain»-d Sympathy
The admission, which should
have been a truth painfully
wretched from a miserable life,
sounded phony and out of char
acter. Martha, who otherwise
played a good lusty, lushy wind
bag, simply lacked the depth cf
character to strain much sym
pathy from and for her frus
trated martial life. Her face
seemed sad and ridiculous, but
never tragic or even particuliar
ly depressing from an audience
viewpoint.
But her deficiencies were
made-up for, and perhaps ac
counted for, by the strength of
Burton's performance as George.
Supposedly an intellectual en
nervated through a prolonged
power struggle with a domineer
ing wife, Burton was easily the
most magnetic character. Most
of the movie's deeper suggestion
and emotion was drawn through
him.
This was a real departure from
the manner of Albee's play
which interwove the lives of a
balanced cast of characters with
such precision that every strand
of conflict fell effortlessly and
perfectly to place.
Disjointed Relationships
Contrary to the play and con
trary even to the dialogue in
the movie, it was impossible to
see much connection between
George's failures and those of
Martha. Their relationship never
gelled on the screen and left the
wierd impression that something
loose and disjointed was created
from what should have been a
tight unity.
Which is far from saying the
movie was a failure. Dialogue
that crackles and Burton's over
whelming performance make it
something just short of a great
movie. In its own way the movie
mirrors life. And if the image is
not completely clear or the way
you feel it ought to be, it might
be remembered that life holds
up few mirrors.

pointless observation, but it is a

faithfully follows dialogue and
incident in Edward Albee's bi
bulous masterpiece.
To give a brief action rehash.
Two couples on a small college
faculty, George (Richard Bur
ton) and Martha (Elizabeth Tay
lor), and Nick (George Segal)
and Honey (sorry), stage an all
night orgy professorial style in
which the profanation of all that
is sacred seems the only pur
pose
Perhaps the most telling bal
ance between the movie's
strength and weakness accrued
in the unique way which the
dialogue was used. Rather than
drawing out and illuminating
the characters from a back
stage position, it was allowed to
outdo and overshadow them,
with the strange result that con
versation was sharper, more in
cisive and in its own right alto
gether more interesting than the
persons concerned (with the ex
ception of Richard Burton).
Sense Of Ridicule
When the knock-down, drag
out, drunken-mess effect was de
manded, the movie shone with
the marvelous sense of ridicule
which created moments truely
to be relished out of a scream
ing and bashing of personalities.
The "Up, yours!" mentality was
infectious and left me wishing

some of the barbed gems were
mine to drop in appropriate
times and circumstances.
Unfortunately for the greater
success of the movie, however,
once the characters had, with
damning precision, made shred
ded wheat of each others' foi
bles, little more was added. The
suggestion made that vulnera
bility did remain in the battle
fatigued relationship of George
and Martha sounded a note of
anguish too remote and flat to
lift the movie into the play's
realm of low tragedy.
The deficit was glaring, to my
mind, when in humility brought
of recent frustration Martha told
the young up start Nick—who
had recently seduced her and
then failed—that of all the peo
ple in her unhappy life only
George had ever made her feel a
whole person.
Strain»-d Sympathy
The admission, which should
have been a truth painfully
wretched from a miserable life,
sounded phony and out of char
acter. Martha, who otherwise
played a good lusty, lushy wind
bag, simply lacked the depth cf
character to strain much sym
pathy from and for her frus
trated martial life. Her face
seemed sad and ridiculous, but
never tragic or even particuliar
ly depressing from an audience
viewpoint.
But her deficiencies were
made-up for, and perhaps ac
counted for, by the strength of
Burton's performance as George.
Supposedly an intellectual en
nervated through a prolonged
power struggle with a domineer
ing wife, Burton was easily the
most magnetic character. Most
of the movie's deeper suggestion
and emotion was drawn through
him.
This was a real departure from
the manner of Albee's play
which interwove the lives of a
balanced cast of characters with
such precision that every strand
of conflict fell effortlessly and
perfectly to place.
Disjointed Relationships
Contrary to the play and con
trary even to the dialogue in
the movie, it was impossible to
see much connection between
George's failures and those of
Martha. Their relationship never
gelled on the screen and left the
wierd impression that something
loose and disjointed was created
from what should have been a
tight unity.
Which is far from saying the
movie was a failure. Dialogue
that crackles and Burton's over
whelming performance make it
something just short of a great
movie. In its own way the movie
mirrors life. And if the image is
not completely clear or the way
you feel it ought to be, it might
be remembered that life holds
up few mirrors.
Life is not always the way
you feel it ought to be, which
may sound like an obvious and
pointless observation, but it is a
good thing to keep in mind
when approaching criticism and
the hollowed grounds of right
reason.
So, too, with life on the giant
screen.
Seeing "Who's Afraid of Vir
ginia Woolf?" I had my enthusi
asm dampened by the feeling
that that movie was, in essence,
swollen and distended as the
egos of the four characters. And
it shared, intententionally or no,
their strangulated obsession over
concerns which were gratitous
at best.

cisive and in its own right alto
gether more interesting than the
persons concerned (with the ex
ception of Richard Burton).
Sense Of Ridicule
When the knock-down, drag
out, drunken-mess effect was de
manded, the movie shone with
the marvelous sense of ridicule
which created moments truely
to be relished out of a scream
ing and bashing of personalities.
The "Up, yours!" mentality was
infectious and left me wishing

some of the barbed gems were
mine to drop in appropriate
times and circumstances.
Unfortunately for the greater
success of the movie, however,
once the characters had, with
damning precision, made shred
ded wheat of each others' foi
bles, little more was added. The
suggestion made that vulnera
bility did remain in the battle
fatigued relationship of George
and Martha sounded a note of
anguish too remote and flat to
lift the movie into the play's
realm of low tragedy.
The deficit was glaring, to my
mind, when in humility brought
of recent frustration Martha told
the young up start Nick—who
had recently seduced her and
then failed—that of all the peo
ple in her unhappy life only
George had ever made her feel a
whole person.
Strain»-d Sympathy
The admission, which should
have been a truth painfully
wretched from a miserable life,
sounded phony and out of char
acter. Martha, who otherwise
played a good lusty, lushy wind
bag, simply lacked the depth cf
character to strain much sym
pathy from and for her frus
trated martial life. Her face
seemed sad and ridiculous, but
never tragic or even particuliar
ly depressing from an audience
viewpoint.
But her deficiencies were
made-up for, and perhaps ac
counted for, by the strength of
Burton's performance as George.
Supposedly an intellectual en
nervated through a prolonged
power struggle with a domineer
ing wife, Burton was easily the
most magnetic character. Most
of the movie's deeper suggestion
and emotion was drawn through
him.
This was a real departure from
the manner of Albee's play
which interwove the lives of a
balanced cast of characters with
such precision that every strand
of conflict fell effortlessly and
perfectly to place.
Disjointed Relationships
Contrary to the play and con
trary even to the dialogue in
the movie, it was impossible to
see much connection between
George's failures and those of
Martha. Their relationship never
gelled on the screen and left the
wierd impression that something
loose and disjointed was created
from what should have been a
tight unity.
Which is far from saying the
movie was a failure. Dialogue
that crackles and Burton's over
whelming performance make it
something just short of a great
movie. In its own way the movie
mirrors life. And if the image is
not completely clear or the way
you feel it ought to be, it might
be remembered that life holds
up few mirrors.
