# Letters To The Editor
## History, Mr. Harris 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
After reading Harris' delerium
it appears to some of us that
he wants no rewards for efforts
expended!
Under HIS idea, everyone
would work hard for something
—but never have anything to
show for it—i.e., a diploma or
Degree.
Harris is certainly—presump
tious to assume anyone in his
right mind would go for his so
called "philosophies" that only
affect one's self and to hell with
anything or anyone else.
Age and experience would be
nullified and negated and youth
would assume full POWER, to
dictate, abuse or use — as
URGES arose.
His "system" eliminates logic
and becomes mindlessness, per
sonified! Period!
Suberfuge such as Harris'
shows a rare and distinct tinge
of Hitlerism and if he doesn't
think so — read back in HIS
TORY — and find it has been
the thoughtless and the foolish
that bring WARS to us.
Dictators, at age 21 are a
dime a dozen and even though
we hear so much about the
youth revolution, where does it
stand on being humane and
kind?

Freedom of sex, freedom of
leisure, freedom of work, free
dom of big mouth!
Is that all there is, to live
and living, truly living?
The guidance students re
ceive from the profs that are
human beings as well as hon
ored teachers, should be re
spected — and not villified and
reproached. And management
by those selected by a BOARD
and by LAW must be abided.
Dignity of person, dignity of
approach and dignity of re
s p e c t in g self and others, as
criterion established over a time
of much brain washing and edu
cation, should well be estab
lished here at Stanford.
Welchers, even when given
full publicity as Harris gets, in
a news sheet that seldom is cen
sored is not a LICENSED medi
um of blowing off steam.
A young man, with not only
a budding future but a boom
ing opportunity to conform, not
to mediocrity but to social de
mands, should find himself a
niche beholden to responsibility
and duty—not to just sounding
off a lot of poppy cock.
Get with it, Mr. Harris, and
grow up. You can't lead where
kids do not wish to go.
