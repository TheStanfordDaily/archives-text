## ASSU Coffee House Hits Snare Over Drug Issue 
### Tim Haight 
Can Stanford students have a
student-run coffee house on
campus? Associate Dean of Stu
dents Joel Smith says no. And
that seems to be the only rea
son.
The reasons do not include
space, regulations, Tresidder
Union, personnel, or even mon
ey. Space is available in the
soon - to - be-vacated Western
Civilization library. A coffee
house, the AS-SUCH, existed
this summer at the Internation
al Center, proving that there is
no regulation against coffee
houses.
Tresidder Union cooperated
with the AS-SUCH and declared
that it would be agreeable to
another facility on-campus.
They're overcrowded as it is.
Tresidder has no monopoly.
Students from many organiza
tions have volunteered to run
the coffe house—groups ranging
from the Ecuminical Coordina
ting Committee to the ASSU
President's office.
Faculty Donations
Money has been offered from
the Office of Undergraduate Ed
ucation and more could be so
licited from the ASSU and from
faculty donations.
What, then, is Dean Smith's
rationale for vetoing the coffee
house? It is pathologically sim
ple. Smith told this writer ear
lier in the week, "The coffee
house would provide an attrac
tive meeting place for a variety
of students, but including stu
dents for whom the taking of
drugs is an accepted part of
their lives . . . (this) becomes
an invitation for these people
to collect, the consequences be
ing troublesome."
Another reason for opposing
the coffee house is "the increas
ing collection of off-campus peo
ple on campus," including high
school students and other non
members of the Stanford com
munity. This and the "drug
problem" argument seem to be
the only objections to the coffee
house.
Camaraderie
Dean Smith admits the need
for meeting places to encourage
"student camaraderie" and he
believes "Stanford has not pro
vided imaginatively for the in
tellectual student, many of
whom live off-campus, for
whom conversation is an im
portant part of their education/'
But he feels sufficient threat of

outside police investigation at
the proposed coffee house that
a public incident might occur.
When asked if there is now
outside police activity in this
field on-campus, Dean Smith
says,"I have no 'hard' informa
tion on that subject ... I don't
know."
Student Assurances
In previous meetings with in
terested faculty and students,
Dean Smith has discussed the
question of whether his concern
is primarily about the public
consequences of such an investi
gation or about the personal
consequences to students who
meet other students who take
drugs. In the case of the coffee
house, he said this week that he
was "prepared to make almost
that admission" that "essential
ly but not exclusively" his con
cern was for the public conse
quences.
Dean Smith mentions that stu
dents have given him assur
ances that the problem could
be controlled, if it was indeed a
problem, but he notes, "I don't
want to accept this student
guarantee and then have to
monitor them to see if they're
delivering on their guarantee."
Asked if this attitude showed
a lack of faith in students on his
part, he said, "I categorically
reject that there is a lack of
faith." He believed that such
promises would be made in good
faith but doubts "whether stu
dents could have the informa
tion necessary" to capably con
trol the problem.
Absurd Fear
Dave Harris, who has been
meeting with Dean Smith about
the coffee house, feels that
this fear is absurd and plans to
bring the issue before the Com
mittee of Fifteen. One student
has commented, "What self-re
specting pot head or acid freak
would be dumb enough to hold
in a place that could so obvious
ly be a bust?"
But the next time you write
home to Mummy and Daddy
about why Stanford can't have
a coffee house you can tell them
a reason: The Dean of Students
office fears the junkies enough
to deprive the whole campus
and doubts the students' ability
to control the problem, even
when the problem is currently
one of the most difficult to de
fine. At least Dean Smith is can
did.

ing collection of off-campus peo
ple on campus," including high
school students and other non
members of the Stanford com
munity. This and the "drug
problem" argument seem to be
the only objections to the coffee
house.
Camaraderie
Dean Smith admits the need
for meeting places to encourage
"student camaraderie" and he
believes "Stanford has not pro
vided imaginatively for the in
tellectual student, many of
whom live off-campus, for
whom conversation is an im
portant part of their education/'
But he feels sufficient threat of

outside police investigation at
the proposed coffee house that
a public incident might occur.
When asked if there is now
outside police activity in this
field on-campus, Dean Smith
says,"I have no 'hard' informa
tion on that subject ... I don't
know."
Student Assurances
In previous meetings with in
terested faculty and students,
Dean Smith has discussed the
question of whether his concern
is primarily about the public
consequences of such an investi
gation or about the personal
consequences to students who
meet other students who take
drugs. In the case of the coffee
house, he said this week that he
was "prepared to make almost
that admission" that "essential
ly but not exclusively" his con
cern was for the public conse
quences.
Dean Smith mentions that stu
dents have given him assur
ances that the problem could
be controlled, if it was indeed a
problem, but he notes, "I don't
want to accept this student
guarantee and then have to
monitor them to see if they're
delivering on their guarantee."
Asked if this attitude showed
a lack of faith in students on his
part, he said, "I categorically
reject that there is a lack of
faith." He believed that such
promises would be made in good
faith but doubts "whether stu
dents could have the informa
tion necessary" to capably con
trol the problem.
Absurd Fear
Dave Harris, who has been
meeting with Dean Smith about
the coffee house, feels that
this fear is absurd and plans to
bring the issue before the Com
mittee of Fifteen. One student
has commented, "What self-re
specting pot head or acid freak
would be dumb enough to hold
in a place that could so obvious
ly be a bust?"
But the next time you write
home to Mummy and Daddy
about why Stanford can't have
a coffee house you can tell them
a reason: The Dean of Students
office fears the junkies enough
to deprive the whole campus
and doubts the students' ability
to control the problem, even
when the problem is currently
one of the most difficult to de
fine. At least Dean Smith is can
did.
Can Stanford students have a
student-run coffee house on
campus? Associate Dean of Stu
dents Joel Smith says no. And
that seems to be the only rea
son.
The reasons do not include
space, regulations, Tresidder
Union, personnel, or even mon
ey. Space is available in the
soon - to - be-vacated Western
Civilization library. A coffee
house, the AS-SUCH, existed
this summer at the Internation
al Center, proving that there is
no regulation against coffee
houses.
Tresidder Union cooperated
with the AS-SUCH and declared
that it would be agreeable to
another facility on-campus.
They're overcrowded as it is.
Tresidder has no monopoly.
Students from many organiza
tions have volunteered to run
the coffe house—groups ranging
from the Ecuminical Coordina
ting Committee to the ASSU
President's office.
Faculty Donations
Money has been offered from
the Office of Undergraduate Ed
ucation and more could be so
licited from the ASSU and from
faculty donations.
What, then, is Dean Smith's
rationale for vetoing the coffee
house? It is pathologically sim
ple. Smith told this writer ear
lier in the week, "The coffee
house would provide an attrac
tive meeting place for a variety
of students, but including stu
dents for whom the taking of
drugs is an accepted part of
their lives . . . (this) becomes
an invitation for these people
to collect, the consequences be
ing troublesome."
Another reason for opposing
the coffee house is "the increas

members of the Stanford com

a lack of faith in students on his
part, he said, "I categorically
reject that there is a lack of
faith." He believed that such
promises would be made in good
faith but doubts "whether stu
dents could have the informa
tion necessary" to capably con
trol the problem.
Absurd Fear
Dave Harris, who has been
meeting with Dean Smith about
the coffee house, feels that
this fear is absurd and plans to
bring the issue before the Com
mittee of Fifteen. One student
has commented, "What self-re
specting pot head or acid freak
would be dumb enough to hold
in a place that could so obvious
ly be a bust?"
But the next time you write
home to Mummy and Daddy
about why Stanford can't have
a coffee house you can tell them
a reason: The Dean of Students
office fears the junkies enough
to deprive the whole campus
and doubts the students' ability
to control the problem, even
when the problem is currently
one of the most difficult to de
fine. At least Dean Smith is can
did.
