## Vietnam Stay Reinforces Students' War Protests 
### WENDY WEINER 
Strong opposition to the war in
Vietnam is not uncommon at Stan
ford. What is unusual is to find stu
dents who can base their reactions
on first-hand experience with the
South Vietnamese people.
Six Stanford students received such
an opportunity this summer, living
and working in South Vietnam. The
six were part of the Volunteers in
Asia program, an independent organi
zation sponsoring social action proj
ects in the Far East.
At a press conference yesterday
three of the students, Holt Ruffin,
Doug Ohmans, and Kit Anderton, dis
cussed the evolution of their anti-war
sentiment during the summer. "My
conclusions remained the same," Ruf
fin said. "My attitude changed. I was
skeptical, at best critical of the war,
but my opposition was intellectual.
My concern now is more personalized
and I'm also more aware of the com
plexity of the war."
'Empathy'
The other two agreed with Ruffin.
"I met the people who would be di
rectly influenced by our decisions in
the war and I could empathize with
them," Ohmans stated.
Anderton admitted to having been
"pretty irrational about the war when
I left. I favored immediate withdraw
al. I didn't think the administration
was telling us the truth—l still don't.
But I no longer feel that we can with
draw immediately," he said. "After
12 years we've created too great a
cleavage between North and South
Vietnam."
The reaction of the Vietnamese to
the presence of Americans in Viet
nam vacillates between one of indif
ference toward U.S. escalation In the
North to violent opposition to the idea
of any bombing of the dykes, they
said.
On a personal level, Ruffin men
tioned the tension between American
and Vietnamese troops in South
Vietnam. The Vietnamese troops are
resentful of the difference between
their own living conditions and those
of the Americans. The American
troops combat the resentment by re
ferring to the Vietnamese troops as
"white mice."
When asked about their impression
of the present trend of the war, Ruf
fin commented that he feels "Ameri
cans are getting carried away with
the idea of a military victory" and
giving less and less attention to the
Vietnam. They mentioned that there
was only a very limited amount of
Vietnamese economy and internal
conditions. "The Vietnamese I talked
to were very upset by this attitude."
Ohmans said he noted that the peo

pie have very little faith that "we
will arrive at an actual one-step ne
gotiated peace." They seem to feel
that the war will eventually end as
troops slowly dribble away.
Ruffln felt that this lack of hope,
so strong among the youth, is sym
bolized by the fact that most "mar
riages are being postponed because of
the uncertainty of the future."
The conference became especially
interesting when the three students
gave their impressions of the much
publicized "free election" in South
time for campaigning, and speculated
that this factor contributed in part to
the lack of enthusiasm for the elec
tion.
Voters Screened
Voters and candidates were all

screened by the South Vietnamese
government. Many candidates were
disqualified, including neutrals, Com
munists, and those who had relatives
in North Vietnam.
Voters had to present voting cards
at the polls. According to Ruffin, huge
amounts of red tape were involved
with attaining such a card.
Only about one third of the people
actually participated in the election
according to the students. This figure
differs significantly from the estimate
of 80 per cent released in the U.S.
press.
The final result of their individual
experiences in Vietnam? "I'm going
back," stated Anderton. Both Ohmans
and Ruffin are seriously considering
doing the same.


Firemen battle it out with a fire that just won't quit. This flareup occurred on
the south side of the Itec Corporation in the Stanford industrial complex. Yes
terday's fire ruined 200 acres of grassland, including 50 acres of Stanford land.

Strong opposition to the war in
Vietnam is not uncommon at Stan
ford. What is unusual is to find stu
dents who can base their reactions
on first-hand experience with the
South Vietnamese people.
Six Stanford students received such
an opportunity this summer, living
and working in South Vietnam. The
six were part of the Volunteers in
Asia program, an independent organi
zation sponsoring social action proj
ects in the Far East.
At a press conference yesterday
three of the students, Holt Ruffin,
Doug Ohmans, and Kit Anderton, dis
cussed the evolution of their anti-war
sentiment during the summer. "My
conclusions remained the same," Ruf
fin said. "My attitude changed. I was
skeptical, at best critical of the war,
but my opposition was intellectual.
My concern now is more personalized
and I'm also more aware of the com
plexity of the war."
'Empathy'
The other two agreed with Ruffin.
"I met the people who would be di
rectly influenced by our decisions in
the war and I could empathize with
them," Ohmans stated.
Anderton admitted to having been
"pretty irrational about the war when
I left. I favored immediate withdraw
al. I didn't think the administration
was telling us the truth—l still don't.
But I no longer feel that we can with
draw immediately," he said. "After
12 years we've created too great a
cleavage between North and South
Vietnam."
The reaction of the Vietnamese to
the presence of Americans in Viet
nam vacillates between one of indif
ference toward U.S. escalation In the
North to violent opposition to the idea
of any bombing of the dykes, they
said.
On a personal level, Ruffin men
tioned the tension between American
and Vietnamese troops in South
Vietnam. The Vietnamese troops are
resentful of the difference between
their own living conditions and those
of the Americans. The American
troops combat the resentment by re
ferring to the Vietnamese troops as
"white mice."
When asked about their impression
of the present trend of the war, Ruf
fin commented that he feels "Ameri
cans are getting carried away with
the idea of a military victory" and
giving less and less attention to the
Vietnam. They mentioned that there
was only a very limited amount of
Vietnamese economy and internal
conditions. "The Vietnamese I talked
to were very upset by this attitude."
Ohmans said he noted that the peo

pie have very little faith that "we
will arrive at an actual one-step ne
gotiated peace." They seem to feel
that the war will eventually end as
troops slowly dribble away.
Ruffln felt that this lack of hope,
so strong among the youth, is sym
bolized by the fact that most "mar
riages are being postponed because of
the uncertainty of the future."
The conference became especially
interesting when the three students
gave their impressions of the much
publicized "free election" in South
time for campaigning, and speculated
that this factor contributed in part to
the lack of enthusiasm for the elec
tion.
Voters Screened
Voters and candidates were all

screened by the South Vietnamese
government. Many candidates were
disqualified, including neutrals, Com
munists, and those who had relatives
in North Vietnam.
Voters had to present voting cards
at the polls. According to Ruffin, huge
amounts of red tape were involved
with attaining such a card.
Only about one third of the people
actually participated in the election
according to the students. This figure
differs significantly from the estimate
of 80 per cent released in the U.S.
press.
The final result of their individual
experiences in Vietnam? "I'm going
