Seventy-five prospective members of
the Tresidder Union Divisions met last
night for orientation talks.
The group, made up largely of
freshmen, listened to a discussion of
the general philosophy of the Union.
Dr. Chester Berry, Director of Tresid
der, considered the Union's history in
addition to its future goals.
Mike Collins, Chairman of the Union
Board, told the students that imagina
tive freshmen could plan and orga
nize programs as well as upper-class
men. Collins said that the seniority
system is not in effect.
Rick Bale, of the Union Board, com
mended the large attendance at the
meeting. "If past experience is any in
dication," he said, "there will be even
more students turning out next week."
The Cultural Arts Division will meet
on Tuesday at 5 p.m. in the Union, the
Program Division Wednesday at 5
p.m., the Social Division Thursday at
5 p.m., and the Publicity Division
plans to hold a meeting soon.
