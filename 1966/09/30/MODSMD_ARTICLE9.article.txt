The University will subdivide "Ryan
Hill" for its third unit of faculty-staff
housing beginning next summer.
The University's Board of Trustees
has approved a request from the Plan

the $1.5 million project. Funds will be
recovered through individual lot de
velopment charges.
The 140-acre site is bounded by Ju

College Terrace, and Page Mill Rd.
It will be divided into 191 single
family residential lots, ranging in size
from one-fourth to four-tenths of an
acre.
The area already contains a reser

Alto and the Ryan Laboratory, which
contains facilities for the Department
of Engineering's thermo-sclences di

To be reserved is a nine-acre site
for a future elementary school for the
Palo Alto Unified School District.
