# Negro Civil Rights: Power Push Stalled

Washington â€” Stokely Car
michael, though never clear
about it, shouts "Black Power"
in a country where Negroes are
only about 10 per cent of a popu
lation now numbering around
200 million.
So far this year at elast 39
cities have been hit by racial
violence. What good does this
do Negroes In some cases the
riots may induce federal, state
or city governments to do more
about Negro housing and em
ployment.
But at the same time it antag
onizes a lot of whites, many of
whom have been sympathetic to
the problems of Negroes. What
ever kind of power Carmichael
has in mind, it's still a dream.
The whites have the real power.
Moderate-Radical Split
And this year, amid growing

white antagonism, the civil
rights cause has been hurt.
Moderate-minded Negro leaders,
like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.,
take a dim view of Negro vio
lence.
King said this month the civil
rights movement has made too
much progress through non
violence to resort to violence
now.
Yet, this week on a CBS tele
vision program, with Mike Wal
lace interviewing a number of
Negro leaders, one of them,
Daniel Watts, editor of Harlem's
"Liberator" Paper, spoke con
tempuously of moderate Negro
leaders.
"House niggers," he called
them.
Positions Enigmatic
He said he meant Roy Wil
kins, Executive secretary of the
National Association for the Ad
vancement of Colored People

(NAACP); King, head of the
Southern Christian Leadership
Conference; and Whitney M.
Young, executive director of
The National Urban League.
Watts talked pi forcing the
white community to negotiate
with Negroes. He didn't explain
that. But how 10 percent of the
population can force the other
90 per cent to do anything it
doesn't want to do was also left
unclear.
Carmichael, head of the Stu
dent Nonviolent Coordinating
Committee, is always vague on
what he means by "Black
Power," what it would consist
of and how it could be obtained.
Backlash Reactions
He was present Sept. 6 when
Negroes rioted in Atlanta and
dumped the Mayor off an auto
mobile. Later he was charged
with inciting a riot.
There can be little doubt the
white reaction this month in
fluenced Senators who killed
this year's civil rights bill. And
this week turned the clock back
a bit on civil rights by approv
ing a measure allowing doctors
to keep white Medicare patients
separate from Negroes when
they think it helpful.
Segregationists Picked
And in the past few weeks
politicians must have been stun
ned by what happened in Mary
land and Georgia where voters
in the Democratic primaries
picked their candidates for gov
ernor.
In Georgia it was a one-time
restaurant owner and segrega
tionist without political experi
ence, Lester G. Maddox, who
closed his restaurant rather
than serve Negroes. And in
Maryland it was George P. Ma
honey who has had wretched
political luck but this year had
as his main theme opposition to
open housing.
NAACP Progress Underrated
There is grim irony in the con
tempt shown by extremists like
Watts for Negro leaders like
Wilkins, King and Young. It
wa6 particularly ironic in the
case of Wilkins whose NAACP
has been the greatest force in
obtaining civil rights for Ne
groes.
For more than a quarter of a
century the NAACP has been
intensively fighting the Negroes'
cause, and with steady success,
led by Walter White, Wilkins's
predecessor, and then Wilkins,
Thurgood Marshall, the NAA
CP's attorney but now U.S.
solicitor general, and Clarence
Mitchell, the NAACP's Wash
ington representative.
