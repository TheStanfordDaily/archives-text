INTERNATIONAL
• Cuba's Youth Mobilized
HAVANA—Criticizing lack of interest, Cu
ban Communist leaders are conducting an in
tensive recruiting campaign for more young
people to perform what are called the tasks of
the revolution.
Party bosses want more youths to join the
Young Communists Union, to volunteer for
farm labor, to join the Armed Forces, become
Pioneers—in short, to "produce." The move
men is aimed at those age 7-27.
As Prime Minister Fidel Castro puts it, "we
want more of a revolutionary spirit in our
young people . . ."
Young Communists' head Jaime Crombet
has threatened to "mobilize every last one of
our youths who isn't studying or working."
Mobilize means to send groups off to farm
camps, or put them to work in factories and
construction projects.
Their direct participation in agriculture is
considered a key factor in the education of
Cuba's leaders of tomorrow, since 80 per cent
of Cuba's labor effort is henceforth to be dedi
cated to agriculture. Everyone that can be
spared is to be thrown into the job—men,
women and children.
Castro has announced pains to mobilize
100,000-150,000 students—boys and girls—for
six weeks of farm work during the present
school year.
The largely agricultural province of Cama
quey will get about 50,000. The rest will scatter
throughout the country, including the Isle of
Pines. Robert Louis Stevenson's "Treasure

Island" has been unofficially renamed the Isle
of Youth because of the large number of
youngsters said to be transforming it into a
huge farm. Most people know the island as the
site of the country's largest political prison.
• China Has Its Day
TOKYO—A Soviet bloc walkout, a stampede
by young Red Guards overzealous to see Mao
Tse-tung, and a strong military note marked
Communist China's most spectular National
Day celebrations in Peking last Saturday.
Defense Minister and Mao's new heir-appar
ent, Lin Pioa's 15-minute speech before a
throng, estimated to number more than 1.5
million Red Guards, troops and others, caused
the walkout from the celebrations at Tien An
Men (Heavely Peace) Square by diplomats
from the Soviet Union and six other Com
munist countries.
Lin Pioa had bluntly assailed the leadership
of the Soviet Union, charging it was in collu
sion with "U.S. imperialism" for Vietnamese
Peace talk swindles."
• Teachers-Professors Strike
YUGOSLAVIA — Educators strike: All 500
teachers and professors in the Serbian indus
trial city of Titovo Uzice refused Sunday to
accept their salaries for October, demanding
a 30 per cent increase.
The educators first decided to strike but,
because they did not want their pupils to suf
fer, recided to refuse salaries until their de
mands has been met.
The city council says it just does not have
the money.

The mayor said half the city budget goes
for education, but is still not enough. He
promised urgent measures to find a solution.
It was the first such case ever published in
Yugoslavia.
• Vietnamese "Participate"
SAIGON —The South Vietnamese Air Force
is flying one "show-the-flag" strike about every
two weeks against Communist North Vietnam,
informed sources said recently.
The semimonthly strike totals about eight
sorties (a sortie is a single flight by one plane),
a miniscule part of the air war against the
North. The much bigged U.S. Air Force flies
about 400 sorties a day against targets in
North Vietnam.
The sources said the South Vietnamese are
given this token role in the air war against
the North because It is "considered proper
that they participate."

• New Secretary Named
WASHINGTON —President Johnson appears
sure to have a 12th cabinet officer soon—a
Secretary of Transportation with fewer pow
ers than the President recommpnded.
The Senate approved creation of a Depart

ment of Transportation 64 to 2 Friday.
The House passed similar legislation 336 to
42 on August 30. Leaders said they expect no
difficulty in working out a compromise al
though the Senate version includes the Fed
eral Maritime Administration in the depart
ment and the House bill does not.
The bill would bring into one department,
government policies, functions and operations
now carried on by almost 100,000 employes in
35 separate units. At present levels, it would
have a $6.3 billion budget, fifth largest in the
Federal establishment.
The President has not indicated whom he
might name to the expected new cabinet post.
A key authority for the secretary to carry
out his responsibility of trying to coordinate
the nation's tangled transportation policies
was heavily watered down in the Senate. The
House struck it completely.
The section asked by Johnson would allow
the secretray to fix standards and criteria for
Federal spending on stransportation facilities.
• Election Issues Named,
NEW YORK —Vice President Hubert H.
Humphrey and former Sen. Barry Goldwater
agreed that Vietnam will not be the crucial
issue in this year's Congressional elections.
Goldwater said the increased cost of living
and "morality—crime on the street" will both
be more important issues.
Humphrey said most of the issues "will be
somewhat of a local nature." Ahead of Viet
nam as a national issue he ranked "the quality
and extent of the administration's program,"
and "so-called inflation."

• Riverside Supports Brown
RIVERSIDE — The Riverside Press-Enter
prise, supporting a Democratic candidate for
governor for the first time in its history, rec
ommended yesterday the re-election of Gov.
Edmund G. Brown.
An editorial in the newspaper says that
while the electorate may be weary of Brown
after his eight years in office, "California can
not afford the luxury of change for change's
sake."
Describing Brown's Republican opponent,
actor Ronald Reagan, as "just too much to
swallow," the editorial says: "We are, after
all, supposed to be electing a governor of
California, not an image, not a face, not a
personality."

• Inez Threatens Mainland
MIAMI—Inez, a compact storm as fickle as
any and at times a ferocious killer, regained
her punch southeast of the U.S. mainland to
day and spread perial to the Bahamas Isles.
"Inez should intensify slowly, bringing the
threat of hurrican-force winds to the extreme
western Bahamas tonight," forecase Arnold
Sugg of the Miami Weather Bureau.
The storm that killed hundreds in the Carib

• Cuba's Youth Mobilized
HAVANA—Criticizing lack of interest, Cu
ban Communist leaders are conducting an in
tensive recruiting campaign for more young
people to perform what are called the tasks of
the revolution.
Party bosses want more youths to join the
Young Communists Union, to volunteer for
farm labor, to join the Armed Forces, become
Pioneers—in short, to "produce." The move
men is aimed at those age 7-27.
As Prime Minister Fidel Castro puts it, "we
want more of a revolutionary spirit in our
young people . . ."
Young Communists' head Jaime Crombet
has threatened to "mobilize every last one of
our youths who isn't studying or working."
Mobilize means to send groups off to farm
camps, or put them to work in factories and
construction projects.
Their direct participation in agriculture is
considered a key factor in the education of
Cuba's leaders of tomorrow, since 80 per cent
of Cuba's labor effort is henceforth to be dedi
cated to agriculture. Everyone that can be
spared is to be thrown into the job—men,
women and children.
Castro has announced pains to mobilize
100,000-150,000 students—boys and girls—for
six weeks of farm work during the present
school year.
The largely agricultural province of Cama
quey will get about 50,000. The rest will scatter
throughout the country, including the Isle of
Pines. Robert Louis Stevenson's "Treasure

Island" has been unofficially renamed the Isle
of Youth because of the large number of
youngsters said to be transforming it into a
huge farm. Most people know the island as the
site of the country's largest political prison.
• China Has Its Day
TOKYO—A Soviet bloc walkout, a stampede
by young Red Guards overzealous to see Mao
Tse-tung, and a strong military note marked
Communist China's most spectular National
Day celebrations in Peking last Saturday.
Defense Minister and Mao's new heir-appar
ent, Lin Pioa's 15-minute speech before a
throng, estimated to number more than 1.5
million Red Guards, troops and others, caused
the walkout from the celebrations at Tien An
Men (Heavely Peace) Square by diplomats
from the Soviet Union and six other Com
munist countries.
Lin Pioa had bluntly assailed the leadership
of the Soviet Union, charging it was in collu

Peace talk swindles."
• Teachers-Professors Strike
YUGOSLAVIA — Educators strike: All 500

The educators first decided to strike but,
because they did not want their pupils to suf

The mayor said half the city budget goes

promised urgent measures to find a solution.
It was the first such case ever published in

• Vietnamese "Participate"
SAIGON —The South Vietnamese Air Force

The semimonthly strike totals about eight

a miniscule part of the air war against the
North. The much bigged U.S. Air Force flies
about 400 sorties a day against targets in
North Vietnam.

• New Secretary Named
WASHINGTON —President Johnson appears

The Senate approved creation of a Depart

The House passed similar legislation 336 to
42 on August 30. Leaders said they expect no
difficulty in working out a compromise al
though the Senate version includes the Fed

The bill would bring into one department,
government policies, functions and operations
now carried on by almost 100,000 employes in
35 separate units. At present levels, it would
have a $6.3 billion budget, fifth largest in the
Federal establishment.
The President has not indicated whom he
might name to the expected new cabinet post.
A key authority for the secretary to carry
out his responsibility of trying to coordinate

• New Secretary Named
WASHINGTON —President Johnson appears
sure to have a 12th cabinet officer soon—a
Secretary of Transportation with fewer pow
ers than the President recommpnded.
The Senate approved creation of a Depart

ment of Transportation 64 to 2 Friday.
The House passed similar legislation 336 to
42 on August 30. Leaders said they expect no
difficulty in working out a compromise al
though the Senate version includes the Fed
eral Maritime Administration in the depart
ment and the House bill does not.
The bill would bring into one department,
government policies, functions and operations
now carried on by almost 100,000 employes in
35 separate units. At present levels, it would
have a $6.3 billion budget, fifth largest in the
Federal establishment.
The President has not indicated whom he
might name to the expected new cabinet post.
A key authority for the secretary to carry
out his responsibility of trying to coordinate
the nation's tangled transportation policies
was heavily watered down in the Senate. The
House struck it completely.
The section asked by Johnson would allow
the secretray to fix standards and criteria for

• Election Issues Named,
NEW YORK —Vice President Hubert H.
Humphrey and former Sen. Barry Goldwater
agreed that Vietnam will not be the crucial
issue in this year's Congressional elections.
Goldwater said the increased cost of living
and "morality—crime on the street" will both
be more important issues.
Humphrey said most of the issues "will be
somewhat of a local nature." Ahead of Viet
nam as a national issue he ranked "the quality

and "so-called inflation."

• Riverside Supports Brown
RIVERSIDE — The Riverside Press-Enter

governor for the first time in its history, rec
ommended yesterday the re-election of Gov.
Edmund G. Brown.
An editorial in the newspaper says that
while the electorate may be weary of Brown
after his eight years in office, "California can
not afford the luxury of change for change's
sake."
Describing Brown's Republican opponent,
actor Ronald Reagan, as "just too much to
swallow," the editorial says: "We are, after
all, supposed to be electing a governor of
California, not an image, not a face, not a

• Inez Threatens Mainland
MIAMI—Inez, a compact storm as fickle as

"Inez should intensify slowly, bringing the
threat of hurrican-force winds to the extreme

• Cuba's Youth Mobilized
HAVANA—Criticizing lack of interest, Cu
ban Communist leaders are conducting an in
tensive recruiting campaign for more young
people to perform what are called the tasks of
the revolution.
Party bosses want more youths to join the
Young Communists Union, to volunteer for
farm labor, to join the Armed Forces, become
Pioneers—in short, to "produce." The move
men is aimed at those age 7-27.
As Prime Minister Fidel Castro puts it, "we
want more of a revolutionary spirit in our
young people . . ."
Young Communists' head Jaime Crombet
has threatened to "mobilize every last one of
our youths who isn't studying or working."
Mobilize means to send groups off to farm
camps, or put them to work in factories and
construction projects.
Their direct participation in agriculture is
considered a key factor in the education of
Cuba's leaders of tomorrow, since 80 per cent
of Cuba's labor effort is henceforth to be dedi
cated to agriculture. Everyone that can be
spared is to be thrown into the job—men,
women and children.
Castro has announced pains to mobilize
100,000-150,000 students—boys and girls—for
six weeks of farm work during the present
school year.
The largely agricultural province of Cama
quey will get about 50,000. The rest will scatter
throughout the country, including the Isle of
Pines. Robert Louis Stevenson's "Treasure

Island" has been unofficially renamed the Isle
of Youth because of the large number of
youngsters said to be transforming it into a
huge farm. Most people know the island as the
site of the country's largest political prison.

teachers and professors in the Serbian indus
trial city of Titovo Uzice refused Sunday to

• Vietnamese "Participate"
SAIGON —The South Vietnamese Air Force
is flying one "show-the-flag" strike about every
two weeks against Communist North Vietnam,
informed sources said recently.
The semimonthly strike totals about eight
sorties (a sortie is a single flight by one plane),
a miniscule part of the air war against the
North. The much bigged U.S. Air Force flies
about 400 sorties a day against targets in
North Vietnam.
The sources said the South Vietnamese are
given this token role in the air war against
the North because It is "considered proper
that they participate."

• New Secretary Named
WASHINGTON —President Johnson appears
sure to have a 12th cabinet officer soon—a
Secretary of Transportation with fewer pow
ers than the President recommpnded.
The Senate approved creation of a Depart

ment of Transportation 64 to 2 Friday.
The House passed similar legislation 336 to
42 on August 30. Leaders said they expect no
difficulty in working out a compromise al
though the Senate version includes the Fed
eral Maritime Administration in the depart
ment and the House bill does not.
The bill would bring into one department,
government policies, functions and operations
now carried on by almost 100,000 employes in
35 separate units. At present levels, it would
have a $6.3 billion budget, fifth largest in the
Federal establishment.
The President has not indicated whom he
might name to the expected new cabinet post.
A key authority for the secretary to carry
out his responsibility of trying to coordinate
the nation's tangled transportation policies
was heavily watered down in the Senate. The
House struck it completely.
The section asked by Johnson would allow
the secretray to fix standards and criteria for
Federal spending on stransportation facilities.
• Election Issues Named,
NEW YORK —Vice President Hubert H.

and "morality—crime on the street" will both
be more important issues.
Humphrey said most of the issues "will be
somewhat of a local nature." Ahead of Viet
nam as a national issue he ranked "the quality
and extent of the administration's program,"
and "so-called inflation."

• Inez Threatens Mainland
MIAMI—Inez, a compact storm as fickle as
any and at times a ferocious killer, regained
her punch southeast of the U.S. mainland to
day and spread perial to the Bahamas Isles.
"Inez should intensify slowly, bringing the
threat of hurrican-force winds to the extreme
western Bahamas tonight," forecase Arnold
Sugg of the Miami Weather Bureau.
The storm that killed hundreds in the Carib
bean showed signs of strength and better orga

INTERNATIONAL
• Cuba's Youth Mobilized
HAVANA—Criticizing lack of interest, Cu
ban Communist leaders are conducting an in
tensive recruiting campaign for more young
people to perform what are called the tasks of
the revolution.
Party bosses want more youths to join the
Young Communists Union, to volunteer for
farm labor, to join the Armed Forces, become
Pioneers—in short, to "produce." The move
men is aimed at those age 7-27.
As Prime Minister Fidel Castro puts it, "we
want more of a revolutionary spirit in our
young people . . ."
Young Communists' head Jaime Crombet
has threatened to "mobilize every last one of
our youths who isn't studying or working."
Mobilize means to send groups off to farm
camps, or put them to work in factories and
construction projects.
Their direct participation in agriculture is
considered a key factor in the education of
Cuba's leaders of tomorrow, since 80 per cent
of Cuba's labor effort is henceforth to be dedi
cated to agriculture. Everyone that can be
spared is to be thrown into the job—men,
women and children.
Castro has announced pains to mobilize
100,000-150,000 students—boys and girls—for
six weeks of farm work during the present
school year.
The largely agricultural province of Cama
quey will get about 50,000. The rest will scatter
throughout the country, including the Isle of
Pines. Robert Louis Stevenson's "Treasure

Island" has been unofficially renamed the Isle
of Youth because of the large number of
youngsters said to be transforming it into a
huge farm. Most people know the island as the
site of the country's largest political prison.
• China Has Its Day
TOKYO—A Soviet bloc walkout, a stampede
