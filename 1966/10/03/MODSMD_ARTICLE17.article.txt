# Frosh Miss Goal
## 
### MARK KYGER 
It did not take the male seg
ment of the new frosh class long
to realize that freshman women
are much more easily "turned
on" by upperclassment than by
members of their own class.
Furthermore, it took the new
freshmen even less time to con
clude that this situation was in
tolerable. With this in mind, the
residents of Junipero decided to
do somthing to change both
their image, and, hopefully, the
attitude of some of the frosh
women.
After 10 days of intricate
planning, the lounge in Junipero
became a living reprint of a re
cent PLAYBOY spread on "Ann-
Margret as Art." Women from
Branner and Roble were present
in numbers armed with paint
brushes, rollers, hands, and
anything else available that
could be used to paint with. Soon
a dance began in the midst of a
maze of ladders and buckets
containing every imaginable
color of paint.
'Fracas' Evolves
The party progressed, and the
men of Junipero were jubilant
as the women began to go ber
serk and completely ignore the
intricate patterns chalked on the
wall. Soon, the women decided
that the walls had had enough,
so they began to paint each
other and everything in sight.
From here the party moved to
Mem Claw where the painters
calmly washed the paint off of
themselves in the fountain.
So they had done it! The men
of Junipero were overjoyed.
They had actually gotten the
freshmen women to notice them.
They had really changed their
image.
A Groan
But the story does not end
until the next day. It seems that
the party was only partially suc
cessful, judging from comments
from girls in Branner and Roble.
One girl volunteered that the
party had been 'a good idea, but
it got a little out of hand." An
other coed commented that the
party was "kicky until it became
a groan," and a third summed
everything up by saying, "It
really wasn't enjoyable."

So, alas, the freshmen men
are back where they started, and
the men of Junipero have a
new problem. Now that they
have a new redecorated lounge,
they, as expressed by house
sponsor John Trimbur, "don't
quite know what to do with it."
