# Kiss Disease Could Strike

The student health service
will be faced with dozens of
young men and women com
plaining of feeling tired and
listless and having other diffl
cult-to-pin-down symptoms.
Some students will simply be
suffering from laziness. But
many others will have a legiti
mate reason for 'back-to-echool
slump'—infectious mononucleo
sis — a common back-to-school
disease which in the past has
been more difficult to diagnose
than to treat.
A theory that "mono" is trans
mitted by close personal contact
has led college students to ro
mantically call it the "kissing di
sease." Yet, when it strikes, in
fectious mononucleosis can be
one of the most miserable ex
periences in a student's life. Re
covery can be slow and every
day lost from school can en
danger marks and play havoc
with education plans.
Now, experts have found that
it can be an indicator of emo
tional stress. Recent studies con
ducted by the Tulane University
School of Social Work in New
Orleans revealed that high
school and college students who
were being treated for mono
were momentarily depressed at
the time they became ill. Thus,
mono becomes a trigger for
drop-outs, an excuse for failing
to repeat a year, a last straw for
requesting medical excuses for
postponement of examinations.
