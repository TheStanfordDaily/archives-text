# Funk: Students Have Rights!
## 
### 
Students today want a "sort of exis
tential democracy on campus, some
thing very hard to achieve and some
thing very important to traffic with."
Robert N. Funk, recently named as
sistant to the dean of the School of
Education, and now working for a
doctorate in higher education, defines
existential democracy as a "milieu of
freedom in which the student retains
his own identity, values and mode of
action, despite the unresponsiveness
and occasional inhumanity of th 3 sys
tems which enmesh him."
Funk's article appearing in the fall
issue of Old Oregon, quarterly publi
cation of the University of Oregon
Alumni Association stresses how the
universities should look more at high
er education in terms of the individual
student. Funk received his law degree
from Oregon in 1955. "Students do
have rights and grievances, and Amer
ican colleges and universities have
been both negligent and condescend
ing in performing their apparent duty
to hear the grievances and enforce the
rights."
The current student political attack
on the universities, which has resulted
in increased student participation in
academic government working for
those rights at Stanford and else
where, is all well and good, Funk
writes, "but representation and pol
icies enacted by majorities will not
meet the needs of existential democ
racy, nor will they achieve individual
education for the individual student."
Funk's chief suggestion for produc
ing the desired change within the

present system is to "shift the nature
of our demands on professors, giving
them more time to work with stu
dents separately."
This can be done by reducing lec
turing responsibility, employing ad
vanced students as advisers and tu
tors, eliminating overlapping courses
and "professor's choice" subjects, he
suggests.
We should also demand more of stu
dents, Funk believes, by lessening the
number of routine tests and papers,
stop "politely ignoring student indif
ference and mediocre performance,"
encouraging students tc examine
themselves in the context of the uni
versity, and requiring students to de
fend their attitudes and actions with
logical rationals.
Praticing what he believes, in ac
tions and print, compliments Funks
philosophy on education. While help
ing to teach two educational law
courses, Funk tried to cut down on
papers and tests. And last year, as as
sistant to Dean Wert in the Office of
Undergradute Education, rather than
give a faculty resident position to
someone with different educational
beliefs, Funk took the position him
self. He was, and is this quarter, fac
ulty resident in Holliday House at
Stern.
He conceded that all of these ideas
have been suggested before, in the
form of honors programs, indepen
dent study and experimental subdivi
sions of the parent campus, but he
pointed out ,this doesn't get to the
heart of the problem—"unfortunately,

many students who might benefit
from this type of education do not
qualify for admission to these pro
grams."
"Students may not be ready for
lives of independent scholarship and
intellectual excitement derived from
the library rather than beer cans,"
Funk continues, "but this does not ex
cuse the university's willingness to

perpetuate stale compromises (in
place of) excellence.
"The life of the university should
proceed somewhat above the level of
political elbowing, however, and pro
fessors and administrators should be
gin their own campaign to pitch the
sound of higher erucation to the ear
of the individual student."

rights."
The current student political attack
on the universities, which has resulted
in increased student participation in
academic government working for
those rights at Stanford and else
where, is all well and good, Funk
writes, "but representation and pol
icies enacted by majorities will not
meet the needs of existential democ
racy, nor will they achieve individual
education for the individual student."
Funk's chief suggestion for produc
ing the desired change within the

present system is to "shift the nature
of our demands on professors, giving
them more time to work with stu
dents separately."
This can be done by reducing lec
turing responsibility, employing ad
vanced students as advisers and tu
tors, eliminating overlapping courses
and "professor's choice" subjects, he
suggests.
We should also demand more of stu
dents, Funk believes, by lessening the
number of routine tests and papers,
stop "politely ignoring student indif
ference and mediocre performance,"
encouraging students tc examine
themselves in the context of the uni
versity, and requiring students to de
fend their attitudes and actions with
logical rationals.
Praticing what he believes, in ac
tions and print, compliments Funks
philosophy on education. While help
ing to teach two educational law
courses, Funk tried to cut down on
papers and tests. And last year, as as
sistant to Dean Wert in the Office of
Undergradute Education, rather than
give a faculty resident position to
someone with different educational
beliefs, Funk took the position him
self. He was, and is this quarter, fac
ulty resident in Holliday House at
Stern.
He conceded that all of these ideas
have been suggested before, in the
form of honors programs, indepen
dent study and experimental subdivi
sions of the parent campus, but he
pointed out ,this doesn't get to the
heart of the problem—"unfortunately,

many students who might benefit
from this type of education do not
qualify for admission to these pro
grams."
"Students may not be ready for
lives of independent scholarship and
intellectual excitement derived from
the library rather than beer cans,"
Funk continues, "but this does not ex
cuse the university's willingness to

perpetuate stale compromises (in
place of) excellence.
"The life of the university should
proceed somewhat above the level of
political elbowing, however, and pro
fessors and administrators should be
gin their own campaign to pitch the
sound of higher erucation to the ear
of the individual student."
Students today want a "sort of exis
tential democracy on campus, some
thing very hard to achieve and some
thing very important to traffic with."
Robert N. Funk, recently named as
sistant to the dean of the School of
Education, and now working for a
doctorate in higher education, defines
existential democracy as a "milieu of
freedom in which the student retains
his own identity, values and mode of
action, despite the unresponsiveness
and occasional inhumanity of th 3 sys
tems which enmesh him."
Funk's article appearing in the fall
issue of Old Oregon, quarterly publi
cation of the University of Oregon
Alumni Association stresses how the
universities should look more at high
er education in terms of the individual
student. Funk received his law degree
from Oregon in 1955. "Students do
have rights and grievances, and Amer
ican colleges and universities have
been both negligent and condescend
ing in performing their apparent duty
to hear the grievances and enforce the
rights."
