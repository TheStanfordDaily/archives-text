# Flurry Shadows Superior Opera

### JEFF BINGAMAN 
During the last few weeks,
the San Francisco Opera's open
ing night production of I Purl
tani by Bellini has served as
home base for journalistic ex
cursions into almost everything
—Ladybird's beautification tour
(of the country that is), anti
war demonstrations, detailed de
scriptions of the coiffure or cum
merbund of some member of
the local hoi polloi, etc. Before
letting the occasion fade into
history as the biggest social
event of the season—for both
beat and elite—perhaps some
attention should be directed at
the professional performers.
To describe Joan Sutherland's
performance as anything less
than superb would be original,
but certainly inaccurate. In the
part of Elvira who wavers be
tween sanity and lack thereof,
Miss Sutherland combines an in
comparable voice with a grace
which prevades the entire per
formance.
Exceptional Clarity
Miss Sutherland's outstanding
performance meets its near
match in Alfredo Kraus' por
trayal of Lord Arturo Talbot.
One of the main reasons for the
infrequency with which this
opera is performed is the scar
city of tenors who can reach the
numerous high D's, which the
part demands, with sufficient

force to make them effective.
When the occasion arises Kraus
leaves no doubt that he is equal
to it. He sings even the highest
notes in natural voice and with
exceptional clarity.
Raymond Wolansky distin
quishes himself in the role of
Sir Riccardo Forth, as does Ni
cola Ghiuselev in the role of Sir
Giorgio Walton. Dorothy Cole,
C. S. Grant, and L. D. Clements
perform admirably in the parts
of Enrichetta, Lord Gualtiero,
and Sir Bruno, respectively, but
are somewhat overshadowed by
the performances of Miss Suth
erland and Kraus.
Well Controlled
Richard Bonynge, Joan Suth
erland's spouse, does an excel
lent job of fitting the orchestra
and voice parts together. He
talks Bellini's long melodies and
by a masterful control of tempo
allows the voices to enter and
exit with a minimum of inter
ruption.
Rer.zo Frusca whom some may
remember for his previous ef
forts as an Olympic sprinter,
makes his debut with the San
Francisco Opera as stage direc
tor.
1 Puritani will be produced for
the last time this season on Sat
urday, October 8. It is highly
recommended even without the
additional attraction which the
opening night afforded, a chance
to discuss it with Ladybird.
