# Cards Break Green Wave, 33-14
## 
### RAFAEL PALACIO 
Bouncing back from last
week's debacle at Minnesota, the
Stanford Indians trounced the
£reen wave of Tulane, 33-14, be
hind the running of Dave Lewis
find the kicking of Sophomore
Bill Shoemaker.
Lewis, who was voted the
back of the game by the scribes,
has finally found his position.
Playing halfback, he rushed for
166 yards, and averaged 11.8
Jyards per carry.
>;• It was Lewis' electrifing 90
yard burst through the right
«ide of the line which accounted

for the Indians' first score.
Handling the kicking end of
the game with poise and com
petence, Bill Shoemaker broke
two Stanford records en route
to a 15 point scoring perform
ance
Blasts Record
Shoemaker broke the old rec
ord of three field goals in one
game with four. His longest
field goal, which was 50 yards,
broke the record set by Braden
Black in the 1963 Big Game,
which was 48 yards.
Handing Tulane their first de
feat of the young season, the In

dians scored early and often,
putting twenty points on the
board at the end of the first
half.
Root Powers
After an exchange of punts,
which left the Indians with
the ball on their own two
yard line, Jack Root ripped up
the middle of the Tulane line for
eight yards. On the next play,
Lewis took a pitch-out from
Washington, cut back and trav
elled 90 yards for the first score
of the game.
Lewis received an assist from
the hustling end Bob Conrad,
who raced from behind to catch
the last Tulane defender and cut
him out of the play with a clean
block.
The next time Stanford got
the ball, the Indians drove down
to the Tulane 23 where the at-

tack stalled. But kicker Bill
Shoemaker came in and booted
a 40 yard field goal to make the
score 10-0 at the end of the first
quarter.
Fumble In End Zone
In the second quarter the In
dians went in for an apparent
score, but Lewis fumbled in the
end zone and Tulane recovered.
Getting the ball back, the In
diants missed a field goal at
tempt from 50 yards out. Shoe
maker came right back to split
the uprights with a 25 yard
field goal, putting Stanford
ahead 13-0.
Closing out the half, Junior
defensive half-back Donn Ren
wick picked off a pass by Tulane
quarterback Warren Bankston
and sprinted to the 4 yard line
before being dropped.

Break For The Tribe
The Indians took advantage
of this break and scored on a
tackle eligible pass play from
Washington to Shore, leaving
the field at half-time with a com
fortable 20-0 edge.
Not losing heart in the battle
at hand, a very game Tulane
team came out to start the sec
ond half, and moving the ball on
passes and keeper plays by quar
terback Bobby Duhon, the Green
Wave put up a sustained 67
yard march to score.
With the score 20-7, neither
side could get an attack mount
ed, and punts were exchanged.
Charles Williams came In at
quarterback for Gene Washing
ton, and Williams moved the In
dians to the Tulane 33, where
Shoemaker kicked his historic 50
yard field goal.
Indians Score Again
In the final quarter, the In
dians started by scoring another
field goal, this one good from 28
yards out.
Tulane bounced back, and
driving behind quarterback War
ren Bankston, took the ball from
their own 16 yard line into the
Stanford end zone for their sec
ond score.
Charles Williams, a Junior
transfer from Ventura, came in
for Stanford's brilliant Sopho
more quarterback Gene Wash
ington with the score 26-14.
Williams engineered a drive
highlighted by the power run
ning of Junior fullback Greg
Boughton. The drive ended in
the end zone as Williams ran in
for the score on a keeper play
from 2 yards out.
Washington Cool
Quarterback Gene Washington
was cool under pressure and
moved well in the backfield.
With a little more playing ex
perience he will become one of
the best in the country.
End Bob Conrad, who was
voted the lineman of the game,
played an outstanding game
and looks like a good bet to
make the all-coast selections.
Another bright spot was the de
fensive work of the mammoth

defensive guard Mike Hibler.
Another very encouraging
aspect was the showing of the
second string offensive backfield.
Charles Williams, Greg Bough
ton, and Bill Shoemaker dis
played talent and confidence in
manufacturing Stanford's last
touchdown.
Rough Spots Still
Overall, there were a few
rough spots, which coach John
Ralston hopes to smooth out be
fore AAWU play.
The pass defense, though in

tercepting three passes, was
especially vulnerable. It must be
shored up before the Indians
face passing whizzes Gary Be
ban of UCLA and Troy Winslow
of USC.
But coach Ralston is not wor
ried. He says that last year the
Indians were not learning from
their pre-season games, and
therefore got hurt in AAWU
play.
This year he says that the
squad is pointing towards
AAWU play and learning from
their pre-season mistakes.
