the varsity goal from 12 yards
out.
John Parker scored two in the
period, taking an assist from
Gary Sheerer, who tallied once.
Varsity Breaks Free
The conditioning differential
between the varsity and the
alumni began to take its toll in
the second quarter, as the junior
Indians began to spring more
and more men open for the free
shot.
Sheerer scored two in the sec
ond period and Bill Meyer fired
in his first goal to give Stan
ford's present varsity an 6-1
half time lead.
Despite the efforts of tough
alumni defenders Jack Lorton,
Jeff Beck, and Tom Chalberg,

the varsity widened its lead in
the third period to 9-1 on the
total, leaving the score 15-4 at
the gun.
The alumni broke loose with
three scores in the last quar
ter. Bill Ready, 1964 team cap
tain and three times All-Confer
ence forward, chucked two goals
into the varsity net.

Hull, who had been effectively
contained through the game in
his "hole" position in front of
the goal, broke loose from his
defender for an instant and
chalked up his second goal.
Meanwhile, paced by a three
goal burst by Bill Meyer, the
varsity added six more to their
strength of two goals by Parker

and one score by Greg Buck
ingham.
Thursday at 3:30, here, the
varsity plays what could be a
very difficult San Jose State
club. Friday at 4:30 in the En
cina Pool, Stanford faces what
will be the most serious threat
to the Indians' national cham
pionship aspirations: Cal.
Hard Core For Cal
The Bears put Barry Weitzen
and Mike Turner into their po
tent first string. All have exper
ience with the Foothill Aquatic
Club, AAU national champ last
summer.
Sheerer and Parker will be
painfully watching the Cal game
from the bench, nursing car-ac
cident injuries incurred last Sat
urday. Stanford's great depth,
hailed as the Tribe's most con
vincing weapon, will face its
toughest test Friday.
Jim Gaughran, Stanford coach,
said earlier this year that he had
ten men equally qualified to
start —time will tell.
Saturday morning at 11:00,
the varsity plays Long Beach
City College in the Farm Pond.


Gary Sheerer (25) looks for a
free man as he picks up water
polo ball In recent game against
SF State. Mark Parmely (29)
looks on. Stanford won, 34-1.
Sheerer and teammate John
Parker suffered injuries Satur
day that will keep them out 3
and 2 weeks, respectively.

will be the most serious threat
to the Indians' national cham
pionship aspirations: Cal.
Hard Core For Cal
The Bears put Barry Weitzen
and Mike Turner into their po
tent first string. All have exper
ience with the Foothill Aquatic
Club, AAU national champ last
summer.
Sheerer and Parker will be
painfully watching the Cal game
from the bench, nursing car-ac
cident injuries incurred last Sat
urday. Stanford's great depth,
hailed as the Tribe's most con
vincing weapon, will face its
toughest test Friday.
Jim Gaughran, Stanford coach,
said earlier this year that he had
ten men equally qualified to
start —time will tell.
Saturday morning at 11:00,
the varsity plays Long Beach
City College in the Farm Pond.

John Parker scored two in the
period, taking an assist from
Gary Sheerer, who tallied once.
Varsity Breaks Free
The conditioning differential
between the varsity and the
alumni began to take its toll in
the second quarter, as the junior
Indians began to spring more
and more men open for the free
shot.
Sheerer scored two in the sec
ond period and Bill Meyer fired
in his first goal to give Stan
ford's present varsity an 6-1
half time lead.
Despite the efforts of tough
alumni defenders Jack Lorton,
Jeff Beck, and Tom Chalberg,

the varsity widened its lead in
the third period to 9-1 on the
total, leaving the score 15-4 at
the gun.
The alumni broke loose with
three scores in the last quar
ter. Bill Ready, 1964 team cap
tain and three times All-Confer
ence forward, chucked two goals
into the varsity net.

Hull, who had been effectively
contained through the game in
his "hole" position in front of
the goal, broke loose from his
defender for an instant and
chalked up his second goal.
Meanwhile, paced by a three
goal burst by Bill Meyer, the
varsity added six more to their
strength of two goals by Parker

and one score by Greg Buck
ingham.
Thursday at 3:30, here, the
varsity plays what could be a
