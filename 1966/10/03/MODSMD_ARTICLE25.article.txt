# Sheerer, Parker Hurt In Accident
## 
### 
Ace Stanford water poloists Gary Sheerer and John Parker
were injured in a car accident in Sunnyvale late last Saturday
night.
Sheerer suffered a "green stick" ankle fracture and facial
cuts and bruises. Parker's head was severely gushed as he
hit the windshield.
Parker evidently fell asleep at the wheel and hit a parked
car. Sheerer, in the hack seat, jumped to protect his date and
caught his foot under the front seat, wrenching it sharpiy upon
collision. The two Stanford juniors had taken Parker's date
home when the accident occured.
Parker's head gash will need two weeks to heal. Sheerer will
be out for at least three weeks, according to doctors.
Gary Sheerer, the spark and the spirit of Stanford water
polo for the past three seasons, broke his left hand early last
season against San Jose State.
UNDAUNTED SHEERER BOBS BACK
Though he was supposedly out for three and a half weeks,
Sheerer (a southpaw) was back in the water in ten days,
working out and perfecting his right-handed goalie-bafflers.
Sheerer assisted coach Jim Gaughran every afternoon until
he could scrimmage again.
Sheerer, a graduate of Await High School, earned First Team
All-American honors last year despite his injury. Last summer,
the nation's AAU coaches selected Sheerer as the Outstanding
Player in the National Championship Tournament.
Parker and Sheerer were teammates on the Foothill Aquatic
Club squad that won the AAU championship last July and
toured Europe! in August.
Parker transferred to Stanford this year after two impressive
seasons at Foothill Colege. In those two years, Foothill got the
best of the series against the Indians, 4-2.
Parker scored four times against the alumni Saturday morn
ing, but will miss this week's tough game with San Jose State
and crucial contest against championship-geared Cal.
