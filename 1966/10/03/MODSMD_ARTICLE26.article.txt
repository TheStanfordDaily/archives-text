# CARD'S LOCKER REPORT
## Ralston Sees Giant Step 
### NICK SELBY 
"We have made a giant step
forward." So spoke Stanford
football coach John Ralston to
his players immediately after
the team's 33-14 victory over
Tulane.
with his team's per
formance, he continued: "But,
we still lack the overall cohe
siveness we need. We're still not
a unit. We need to improve."
Ralston was disappointed that
Tulane was allowed to
score at the start of the second
h> ;f: "There's no reason that a
team leading by 20-0 should al
low a drive, much less a 37 yard
run. When you've got a team on
the run, pour It on. Never let
up."
Shouting to his team from a
bench in the clubhouse at Stan
ford Stadium, Ralston said,
"We've got the club to go all
the way. Now I know that we
can do it. Our defense was much
better. We had no big weak
nesses. Our first conference
game is next week, and let's
think about nothing but win
ning that one."
The Stanford team, obviously
fired up, yelled and ran out of
the clubhouse toward the locker
room in Encina Gymnasium.
The heroes of the game, Dave
Lewis, Gene Washington, and
Bill Shoemaker, were stopped
by hordes of young autograph
se«kers as they made their way
up Sam Mac Donald Road.
Ball Control Strategy
Ralston relaxed after the
team left and risked a smile as
he answered questions for this
reporter. Concerning ball con
trol in the first half, when the
C.n'ds ran twice as many plays

as the Green Wave, he said,
"Well, of couse, we like to con
trol the ball. Our game strategy
was to move the ball steadily
on the ground." The strategy
worked well — the Cards gained
416 yards rushing.
The main ground gainers were
Dave Lewis and Gene Wash
ington, with 168 and 100 yards
respectively.
Washington, who used his ex
ceptional speed on numerous
roll outs around right end, com
mented: "We planned to run
Tulane's ends, who we felt were
not real tough. They came
straight in or crashed real fast,
and we just ran inside (Lewis's
90 yard score) or outside of
them (on the roll outs)."
Great Blocking
Lewis commented that the
reason for his performance was
the great blocking. Asked if he
was afraid of being caught as
he broke into the open, Lewis
said he wasn't, but joked that
he was worried he might tight
en up.
Part of the excitement of
Lewis's run was provided by
split end Bob Conrad, who raced
up to cut down Tulane's last
pursuer Mike Fitzpatrick with
a neat block on the five yard
line. Conrad said that he told
himself not to clip, that he was
thinking about it the entire run.
Spirit Spoils Holes
A key factor in the Card's
ground game was the offensive
line. Coach Mike White claimed
that the huge holes were due
to the Card's spirit, not to their
slight weight advantage.
White praised Tom Weingart
ner, right end, and Bob Blunt,
flanker, for their blocks on

Lewis's 90 yard run. Washing
ton and Jack Root also drew
mention from White for the way
they lead Lewis off tackle.
"Our blocking was very good
the first half, but disappointing
the second half," White con
cluded.
Praises Washington
Coach Ralston had nothing
but praise for quarterback Gene
Washington."I think Gene's
over his early season jitters
now. He took his time in select
ing receivers and showed real
poise in the pocket."
Washington commented that
the reason he didn't pass as
much as in previous games was
only because the ground game
was working so well: "I was
not worried about intercep
tions."
One Cardinal score came on
a pass from Washington to
tackle Bob Shore. The tackle eli
gible play garnered a touch
down with only six seconds left
in the first half. "It was Gene's
idea," Ralston said. "It's the
first time we've used it this sea
son."
The score was set up by Donn
Renwick's interception of Tu
lane quarterback Warren Bank
ston's pass. "I should have gone
all the way. I had blockers out
in front of me." Renwick con
tinued, "I was ready to inter
cept the pass. We'd studied the
films and practiced it all week."
Back at Encina gymnasium,
the Stanford band played the
Stanford fight song outside the
locker room. Captains Tim Shee
han and Jack Root left the
lockerroom to thank band lead
er Chris Kanny for the band's
support.

he broke into the open, Lewis
said he wasn't, but joked that
he was worried he might tight
en up.
Part of the excitement of
Lewis's run was provided by
split end Bob Conrad, who raced
up to cut down Tulane's last
pursuer Mike Fitzpatrick with
a neat block on the five yard
line. Conrad said that he told
himself not to clip, that he was
thinking about it the entire run.
Spirit Spoils Holes
A key factor in the Card's
ground game was the offensive
line. Coach Mike White claimed
that the huge holes were due
to the Card's spirit, not to their
slight weight advantage.
White praised Tom Weingart
ner, right end, and Bob Blunt,
flanker, for their blocks on

Lewis's 90 yard run. Washing
ton and Jack Root also drew
mention from White for the way
they lead Lewis off tackle.
"Our blocking was very good
the first half, but disappointing
the second half," White con
cluded.
Praises Washington
Coach Ralston had nothing
but praise for quarterback Gene
Washington."I think Gene's
over his early season jitters
now. He took his time in select
ing receivers and showed real
poise in the pocket."
Washington commented that
the reason he didn't pass as
much as in previous games was
only because the ground game
was working so well: "I was
not worried about intercep
tions."
One Cardinal score came on
a pass from Washington to
tackle Bob Shore. The tackle eli
gible play garnered a touch
down with only six seconds left
in the first half. "It was Gene's
idea," Ralston said. "It's the
first time we've used it this sea
son."
The score was set up by Donn
Renwick's interception of Tu
lane quarterback Warren Bank
ston's pass. "I should have gone
all the way. I had blockers out
in front of me." Renwick con
tinued, "I was ready to inter
cept the pass. We'd studied the
films and practiced it all week."
Back at Encina gymnasium,
the Stanford band played the
Stanford fight song outside the
locker room. Captains Tim Shee
han and Jack Root left the
lockerroom to thank band lead
er Chris Kanny for the band's
support.
"We have made a giant step
forward." So spoke Stanford
football coach John Ralston to
his players immediately after
the team's 33-14 victory over
Tulane.
with his team's per
formance, he continued: "But,
we still lack the overall cohe
siveness we need. We're still not
a unit. We need to improve."
Ralston was disappointed that
Tulane was allowed to
score at the start of the second
h> ;f: "There's no reason that a
team leading by 20-0 should al
low a drive, much less a 37 yard
run. When you've got a team on
the run, pour It on. Never let
up."
Shouting to his team from a
bench in the clubhouse at Stan
ford Stadium, Ralston said,
"We've got the club to go all
the way. Now I know that we
can do it. Our defense was much
better. We had no big weak
nesses. Our first conference
game is next week, and let's
think about nothing but win
ning that one."
The Stanford team, obviously
fired up, yelled and ran out of
the clubhouse toward the locker
room in Encina Gymnasium.
The heroes of the game, Dave
Lewis, Gene Washington, and
Bill Shoemaker, were stopped
by hordes of young autograph
se«kers as they made their way
up Sam Mac Donald Road.
Ball Control Strategy
Ralston relaxed after the
team left and risked a smile as
he answered questions for this
reporter. Concerning ball con
trol in the first half, when the
C.n'ds ran twice as many plays

as the Green Wave, he said,
"Well, of couse, we like to con
trol the ball. Our game strategy
was to move the ball steadily
on the ground." The strategy
worked well — the Cards gained
416 yards rushing.
The main ground gainers were
Dave Lewis and Gene Wash
ington, with 168 and 100 yards
respectively.
Washington, who used his ex
ceptional speed on numerous
roll outs around right end, com
mented: "We planned to run
Tulane's ends, who we felt were
not real tough. They came
straight in or crashed real fast,
and we just ran inside (Lewis's
90 yard score) or outside of
them (on the roll outs)."
Great Blocking
Lewis commented that the
reason for his performance was
the great blocking. Asked if he

formance, he continued: "But,
we still lack the overall cohe
siveness we need. We're still not
a unit. We need to improve."
Ralston was disappointed that
Tulane was allowed to
score at the start of the second
h> ;f: "There's no reason that a
team leading by 20-0 should al
low a drive, much less a 37 yard
run. When you've got a team on
the run, pour It on. Never let
up."
Shouting to his team from a
bench in the clubhouse at Stan
ford Stadium, Ralston said,
"We've got the club to go all
the way. Now I know that we
can do it. Our defense was much
better. We had no big weak
nesses. Our first conference
game is next week, and let's
think about nothing but win
ning that one."
The Stanford team, obviously
fired up, yelled and ran out of
the clubhouse toward the locker
room in Encina Gymnasium.
The heroes of the game, Dave
Lewis, Gene Washington, and
Bill Shoemaker, were stopped
by hordes of young autograph
se«kers as they made their way
up Sam Mac Donald Road.
Ball Control Strategy
Ralston relaxed after the
team left and risked a smile as
he answered questions for this
reporter. Concerning ball con
trol in the first half, when the
C.n'ds ran twice as many plays

as the Green Wave, he said,
"Well, of couse, we like to con
trol the ball. Our game strategy
was to move the ball steadily
on the ground." The strategy
worked well — the Cards gained
416 yards rushing.
The main ground gainers were
Dave Lewis and Gene Wash
ington, with 168 and 100 yards
respectively.
Washington, who used his ex
ceptional speed on numerous
roll outs around right end, com
mented: "We planned to run
Tulane's ends, who we felt were
not real tough. They came
straight in or crashed real fast,
and we just ran inside (Lewis's
90 yard score) or outside of
them (on the roll outs)."
Great Blocking
Lewis commented that the
reason for his performance was
the great blocking. Asked if he
was afraid of being caught as
he broke into the open, Lewis
said he wasn't, but joked that
he was worried he might tight
en up.
Part of the excitement of
Lewis's run was provided by
split end Bob Conrad, who raced
up to cut down Tulane's last
pursuer Mike Fitzpatrick with
a neat block on the five yard
line. Conrad said that he told
himself not to clip, that he was
thinking about it the entire run.
Spirit Spoils Holes
A key factor in the Card's
ground game was the offensive
line. Coach Mike White claimed
that the huge holes were due
to the Card's spirit, not to their
slight weight advantage.
White praised Tom Weingart
ner, right end, and Bob Blunt,
flanker, for their blocks on

Lewis's 90 yard run. Washing
ton and Jack Root also drew
mention from White for the way
they lead Lewis off tackle.
"Our blocking was very good
the first half, but disappointing
the second half," White con
cluded.
Praises Washington
Coach Ralston had nothing
but praise for quarterback Gene
Washington."I think Gene's
over his early season jitters
now. He took his time in select
ing receivers and showed real
poise in the pocket."
Washington commented that
the reason he didn't pass as
much as in previous games was
only because the ground game
was working so well: "I was
not worried about intercep
tions."
One Cardinal score came on
a pass from Washington to
tackle Bob Shore. The tackle eli
gible play garnered a touch
down with only six seconds left
in the first half. "It was Gene's
idea," Ralston said. "It's the
first time we've used it this sea
son."
The score was set up by Donn
Renwick's interception of Tu
lane quarterback Warren Bank
ston's pass. "I should have gone
all the way. I had blockers out
in front of me." Renwick con
tinued, "I was ready to inter
cept the pass. We'd studied the
films and practiced it all week."
Back at Encina gymnasium,
the Stanford band played the
Stanford fight song outside the
locker room. Captains Tim Shee
han and Jack Root left the
lockerroom to thank band lead
er Chris Kanny for the band's
support.
"We have made a giant step
forward." So spoke Stanford
football coach John Ralston to
his players immediately after
the team's 33-14 victory over
Tulane.

formance, he continued: "But,
