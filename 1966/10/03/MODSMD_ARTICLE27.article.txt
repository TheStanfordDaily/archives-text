# Stanford Runners Set For Season Opener
## 
### 
"Optimistic" is the term used
by cross country coach Jerry
Barland following the intra
squad time trial meet Saturday
at the Stanford golf course.
Barland's runners open their
season Saturday at the Sacra
mento Invitational.
Competing for Stanford's var
sity will be (in order of finish in
the time trial) Jim Letterer
(21:15), Randy Hyvonen, John
John Boeschan, Fred Tohrsen,
Bob Anchondo, Bob Kelly and
Mike Jacobs.
For the freshmen, Chuck
Menz (21:30), Greg Brock, Tom
Ross, Sterling Speirn, David
Redwine, Steve Carpenios and
Bob Reed will run. Stanford's
freshman team won their divi
sion of the Sacramento meet
last year.
"We should have a good,
solid team this season," Barland
commented. "We had some good
times, considering this was the

first time some of these boys
had ever ran a 4 mile race."
Stanford's course, which is 4.2
miles, is located on the Stanford
golf course with the start and
finish at the second tee.
