# AWS Desires Valid Function In Serving Stanford's Women
## 
### 
Associated Women Students, the
official representative body of Stan
ford women, Is nov in the throes of
change. Sharon Kniss, current presi
dent of AWS, sees this year as a real
survival test for her organization. If,
at the end of the year, she and the
other officers do not feel that AWS is
performing a valid and useful func
tion, they will be compelled to vote it
out of existence.
AWS was originally founded at a
time when women definitely needed
their own representative organization,
but in the past few years it has, in
fact, had very little to do. It con
tinues to manage the house drawing,
and, until last spring, also managed
the women's social regulations. How
ever, at that time, in view of the
changing nature of these codes, the
social regulations committee found
itself somewhat anachronistic and de
cided tc vote itself out of existence.
Enforcement of social regs is now
the responsibility of the judicial and
auxiliary councils.
According to iMss Kniss, the orig
inal function of AWS was that of a
regulatory body. However, she now
hopes that it will avoid this function
as much as possible in favor of be
coming a center of communication
among Stanford girls and thus work
to serve rather than dominate them.
Miss Kniss feels that all girls have
unique and individual difficulties and,
because of this, sees the need for a
truly representative organization.
These difficulties will embrace a spec
trum ranging from such trivial fem
inine concerns as diet bread at din
ner to issues which question such
university policy as the rule against
off-campus housing for women.
Miss Kniss favors the allowance of
off-campus housing, but she sees her
election as AWS president not as a
mandate to carry out her personal
goals and convictions but as a dis
tinct responsibility to see that AWS
expresses a consensus. With this in
mind, she will work actively for off
campus housing only if supported by

a majority of Stanford women.
Another issue which Miss Kniss
sees as specifically relevant to girls
is the construction of the new dormi
tories. She deplores the demise of row
house living, which this program
could easily engender, seeing that it
will leave girls with no choice as to
the type of housing available to them.
Again, if enough girls express a de
sire to preserve the house atmosphere
in the new dorms, AWS will reflect
their wishes and work for this.
In addition to these tentative pro
grams, AWS will this year sponsor
a number of other projects. There
will be a panel to discuss career pos
sibilities for women who find them
selves unmarried after four years; as
Miss Kniss says, they have to do
something. AWS will also work to ex
tend to a much fuller degree contact
and communication between fresh
man and upper class women. The pur
pose here is to allow freshman girls
to expand their world beyond Bran
ner and Roble before spring quarter.
AWS will also sponsor a fashion show
somewhat later in the year.
Miss Kniss did not envision closer
ties between AWS and ASSU this
year, since AWS is designed as a
service rather than a political orga
nization. Officially, AWS is a non
voting member of LASSU; however,
the fact remains that LASSU could
decide unilaterally to abolish AWS.
Therefore, not oniy must AWS prove
its necessity to itspi f 4V,<p venr, but
also to a possibly hostile LASSU.
