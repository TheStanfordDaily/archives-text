# The 						Experiment

A recent study of the New Left by Paul
Jacobs and Saul Landau highlights the present
development of radical thinking among Ameri
can youth and stresses the crisis of ideology
that the leaders of the New Left are weather
ing. In The New Radicals Jacobs and Landau
contend that "those in The Movement now
restlessly seek to find a new politics and a new
ideology that will link extenstential humanism
with morally acceptable modes of achieving
radical social change."
This state of uncertainty, in part, explains
the drastic changes in personnel, "from poets
to generals," and the stiffening of philosophy
that have taken place in such organizations
as SNCC.
The impact of the New Left arrived on
American colleges only after it had demon
strated its commitment in the South. Despite
its tardy advent in the academic community,
the university may well provide the basis for
crystalizing the New Left's ideology far better
than action-oriented expressions in the rest of
society.
Stanford's n e w, student-organized experi
mental college, The Experiment, is a case in
point. The Experiment, beginning its program
this month, shares a common questioning of
contemporary societal values. In a recent news
letter, Experiment Coordinator Barry Green
berg asked his readers to put aside the euphoric
"corporate-liberal ideology of today's society,
and suggested that "Every Thing Is Basically
Wrong."
With heavy emphasis on the existential ele
ments of the New Left, The Experiment shows
the capability of meeting the dilemma of a new
philosophy where purely political expressions
of the New Left have failed. Seeking "to inte
grate (student's) educational experience with

questions, issues, and choices which deeply
affect their lives," The Experiment's goal is
educational rather than political. It has culled
from the New Left its critical approach and
broadened the context of its discussions con
siderably.
Laying aside for a moment The Experiment's
role as a philosophical synthisizer, we can
describe its educational possibilities as no less
than exciting. A glance at The Experiment's
fall catalogue leaves no doubt of the group's
commitment to a more personal, fuller educa
tional experience. With courses such as "Exis
tentialism and Political Commitment," "Higher
Education and the Great Society," and work
shops in the arts, The Experiment is far ahead
of the University in fulfilling student desires
for "relevant" courses.
In fact The Experiment may offer several
lessons for University Administrators. The Ex
periment has committed itself to presenting
a formal statement of its philosophy and a con
crete plan to attain its aims. Admittedly this
is a difficult task, but we can only admire The
Experiment's efforts while an institution seven
ty-five years its senior has shown great reluc
tance to take up the same task. The continuing
reevaluation of courses proposed by The Ex
periment might well be heeded by many de
partments in the University.
In the organization of the experimental col
lege, student and faculty will have equal mem
bership, and Greenberg expects faculty mem
bers to be active both as participants and as
leaders.
The Experiment will deserve much study this
year: both for its implications for Stanford's cur
riculum and for its efforts to ground the dilemma
of the New Left in the constructive methods of
an academic community.
