# Letters To The Editor
## The 						Inner City's Position: Insulated or Investigated 
### 
Editor, The Daily,
Just for the record, I want to
point out that I was misquoted
in your news story about last
Thursday night's kick-off meet
ing of the S.C.P.V. In reporting
to the meeting about the recent
H.U.A.C. hearings, I said that
the Y.S.A. (Youth Socialist Al
liance), not the S.C.P.V., orga
nization list was voluntarily
turned over to H.U.A.C. investi
gators by the Stanford adminis
tration. Since we know that the
lists were turned over voluntar
ily, not subpoenaed as at the
University of California and the
University of Michigan, there is
every reason to believe that
Stanford supplied H.U.A.C. with
every organization list in which
the Committee was interested.
But highly plausible conjecture
is conjecture nonetheless.
Also, I'd like to mention an
important part of my report that
your story neglected to include. I
asked S.C.P.V. to raise the de
mand that these lists be put en
tirely under the authority of the
student body president, who is
directly responsible to the stu
dents. My reason for so doing is
that the administration demon
strated bad faith of the most ob
jectionable kind in collaborating
with this latest H.U.A.C. witch

hunt. Students are asked by the
administration to furnish lists
for the limited purpose of estab
lishing an identity for an organi
zation and a source of respon
sibility for its activities, not in
order to be policed by H.U.A.C.,
the F. 8.1., the C.I.A. and other
such. H.U.A.C.'s demanding
these lists for the purpose of ex
posure poisons our First Amend
ment right of free association.
Stanford's turning the lists over
to H.U.A.C. poisons whatever
academic freedom exists in "the
inner city," which it seems is
not merely of the world, but in it
as well. Should students have to
include in their decision to spon
sor or join an organization con
sideration of the damage
H.U.A.C., the F. 8.1., or the C.I.A.
can do them in later years?
That's a rhetorical question,
President Sterling.

Editor, The Daily;
Vernon Wedin (Sept. 28) is
much too limiting in ascribing
his dissatisfaction and restless
ness (as well as ours) with Stan
ford's "preoccupation with re
sults and achievements." He, in

effect, bites the hand that feeds
us, because in our American so
ciety today, the university is the
one place where we can be hu
man (the most permissive par
ent won't let his child appear in
public in bare feet). And the
Stanford campus is an oasis of
beauty in a country where
beauty doesn't matter much.
The culprit, as usual, has to
be "society", of which Stanford
is admittedly a most responsi
ble servant, or it couldn't exist.
But never mind "Society", be
cause we can't get our hands
on it and wring its neck. The
culprits are we, the Wedins, the
Wolzes, the "individuals," who,
when the choice has to be made
between "the pursuit of happi
ness" and "making a good liv
ing," naturally choose the latter.
Making a good living in
America has long ago parted
company with the pursuit of
happiness. For happiness de
pends on the nurture of infinite
human resources, which the
making of a good living in cer
tain stages (especially at the
exposed "Top" where considera
tions of Power and Prestige
have one over a barrel) cannot
tolerate.

your story neglected to include. I
asked S.C.P.V. to raise the de

directly responsible to the stu

that the administration demon
strated bad faith of the most ob
jectionable kind in collaborating
with this latest H.U.A.C. witch

hunt. Students are asked by the
administration to furnish lists
for the limited purpose of estab

zation and a source of respon

order to be policed by H.U.A.C.,
the F. 8.1., the C.I.A. and other

these lists for the purpose of ex

Stanford's turning the lists over
to H.U.A.C. poisons whatever
academic freedom exists in "the
inner city," which it seems is
not merely of the world, but in it

Vernon Wedin (Sept. 28) is
much too limiting in ascribing
his dissatisfaction and restless
ness (as well as ours) with Stan
ford's "preoccupation with re
sults and achievements." He, in

effect, bites the hand that feeds
us, because in our American so
ciety today, the university is the
one place where we can be hu
man (the most permissive par
ent won't let his child appear in
public in bare feet). And the
Stanford campus is an oasis of
beauty in a country where
beauty doesn't matter much.
The culprit, as usual, has to
be "society", of which Stanford
is admittedly a most responsi
ble servant, or it couldn't exist.
But never mind "Society", be
cause we can't get our hands
on it and wring its neck. The
culprits are we, the Wedins, the
Wolzes, the "individuals," who,
when the choice has to be made
between "the pursuit of happi
ness" and "making a good liv
ing," naturally choose the latter.
Making a good living in
America has long ago parted
company with the pursuit of
happiness. For happiness de
pends on the nurture of infinite
human resources, which the
making of a good living in cer
tain stages (especially at the
exposed "Top" where considera
tions of Power and Prestige
have one over a barrel) cannot
tolerate.
