## His Greatness Was More Than Relative 
### William F. Buckley, Jr 
The death of George Skakel
Jr. in Idaho was announced to
the world via his prominent con
nection with Senator Robert
Kennedy; and indeed Mr. Skak
el's sister is Mrs. Robert Ken
nedy. One wonders whether, ab
sent that connection, his death
would have been noticed on the
front pages.
No doubt the answer is no—
his qualifications for public at
tention depending, by the rules
of journalistic commerce on his
closeness, by marriage, to politi
cal glamor. He otherwise
emered, in the obituary notices,
as a young tycoon and sports
man; but he was, it is the pur
pose of his particular obituary
to note, something rather spe
cial; someone whose death is
worth the mourning beyond his
immediate circle of family and
friends.
Skakel was in the tradition of
the total American man, whose
principal complaint against the
cosmos is that we are destined
some day to die, which no mat
ter at what age it happens,
means the abortion of a career
of life-loving that ideally should
go on forever anr ever.
Jaded Age
The range of his interests was
phenomenal, his capacity to live
and exploit the pleasures of the
earth extraordinary—they call it
a "lust for life," the kind of
thing great artists and writers
and statesman have had —
Michelangelo and Victor Hugo,
Thomas Jefferson and Winston
Churchill. Skakel had it, and
brought an energy to his life
which, in this jaded age of a
general fatigue and instant en
nui, of philosophical Welt
schemrz and 40-hour weeks and
unconditional surrender to tele
vision sets and the passive life,
made him seem almost the ec
centric, out of harmony with the
rhythm of a senescent world.
Made him, too, impulsive, in mis
chievous and irresistable ways.
He grew up knowing John
Kennedy, and one time when
they were racing together in
Martha's Vineyard Sound on
Kennedy's sailboat, when the
skipper was a mere senator,
Skakel, adjusting the sails ac
cording to the autocratic whims
of his competitive friend, re
flected suddenly on an irony,
namely, that he was just now
adjusting a sail in a way which,
he knew, would make the racing
boat lose, rather than gain,
speed.
In The Cockpit
He turned to Kennedy and said
in the tough-talk accents that
came so naturally to him, "Look,
Jack, are you going to keep
screaming at me how to trim
this sail, when I know damned
well better than you do how it

ought to be trimmed?" Kennedy
told him to shut, up and do as he
was told. Whereupon George
Skakel Jr. rose up in the cock
pit and dived off the boat to
swim two miles to shore, leav
ing the skipper breathless with
impotent rage and, incidentally,
crewless.
After the inauguration cere
monies in 1961, Skakel con
cluded that the young Presi
dent's staff was behaving a little
pompously in the Capitol recep
tion room where the President
ial party had repaired, prior to
going to the reviewing stand.
Whereupon he took the seating
pass of an august Cabinet mem
ber and conferred it ceremon
iously on a Negro porter, throw
ing protocol into utter panic.
Loved Danger
He liked that sort of thing,
and it was tolerated by servants
and presidents because it was a
part of a personality of someone
worth knowing, a man of enorm
ous competence, curiosity,
charm. He loved danger not
merely social and political (he
never disguised his adamant Re
publicanism from his friend in
the White House), but physical.
Every sport that involves any
personal risk, he devotedly culti
vated, shrewdly sizing up the
odds, and pressing close to the
brink; so close, last Saturday,
that the wing-tip of his private
airplane caught the face of the
canyon and sent him to death.
The tension, when the pilot
overshot the attempted landing
and rose to try, unsuccessfully
again, could not have been dif
ferent, or more acute, than
dangers Skakel frequently ex
posed himself to.
With Gusto
Though no, as it happens, for
long. His spirited father and
mother died in a private plane
crash a dozen years ago, leaving
young Skakel president of one
of the largest family owned
companies in the United States,
from whose offices in New York
City he directed with gusto and
determination the minutiae of
the sprawling business, and
plotted his pleasures, deep under
the sea, on horseback, hunting,
skiing, reading, collecting. I sat
with him there on one occasion
talking about this and that when
a secretary interrupted him to
give him the news that Albert
Einstein had, according to the
radio, just died.
"Well," Skakel said, "now he
knows." Knows, Skakel meant,
what eluded the greatest cosmo
logist of the century while he
was alive, namely, that God de
signed the whole intricate, in
finite business; and no doubt is
now engaged in explaining to
one of His most argumentative
creations, why the tragedy at
Idaho was a godsend.
