## 
### PAT McMAHON 
The Palo Alto City Council will
meet tonight to consider the city's fi
nance committee recommendation
that their share of the Palo Alto-Stan
ford Hospital be declared "not for
sale."
The committee made the recom
mendation after considering a joint
statement from the six city repre
sentatives on the hospital board of
trustees. The statement termed the
present hospital situation a "distinct
advantage to the Palo Alto resident."
"The magnet of 200 modern beds
under our control at Hoover Pavilion
—two or more yeans hence—does not
pull as strongly as continuing with
what we have and know, even though
future liason and cooperation appar

ently cannot be as close as it has been
in the past," reasoned a two-page pre
pared motion.
This evening's city council decision
will be in answer to Stanford's pro
posal, formalized in an August 8 let
ter from President Sterling to the
mayor of Palo Alto, to purchase the
city's interest in the Hospital and
make additional land available con
tiguous to the Herbert Hoover Pavil
ion for expansion of a community
hospital.
The University's actions in this re
gard was originally at the request
of the City of Palo Alto in a request
dated May 10, 1965, when they asked
Stanford to consider the possibilities
of obtaining Palo Alto's share of the
hospital.
Dr. Robert J. Glaser, Vice-Presi
dent for Medical Affairs and Dean
of the Medical School contacted yes
terday by the Daily commented that
Palo Alto's decision (to remain at
their present location) would be their
prerogative of course." He expalined
that, in that case, Stanford would
commence plans to build additional
facilities.
Sterling said in his letter to the
mayor of Palo Alto that he had now
been authorized by the Board of
Trustees to offer the city a "defini
tive" proposal. He wrote, "The Uni
versity is prepared to pay the City
a sum of money equivalent to the fair
market value of the City's share in
the building and equipment of the
Palo Alto-Stanford Hospital in order
to acquire such share.

"Based on a very preliminary an
alysis, we estimate this sum to be of
the order of $5 million; as soon as we
have that figure refined, we shall in
form you of it."
The decision to incorporate Palo
Alto's share of the Hospital was based
on a report prepared by the Medical
School administration and faculty,
headed by Dr. Glaser.
The faculty report stated that Stan,,
ford must have a University Hospital
with 450 to 500 beds and the usual
supporting facilities such as operat
ing rooms and laboratories to sup
port its major effort in medical edu
cation, patient care, and research.
The report noted that if the Uni
versity did acquire the Hospital, mem
bers of the volunteer faculty, many of
whom also serve on the Palo Alto
medical staff, would continue to have
access to the University's facility for
hospitalization of patients from ths
community.
The Stanford Medical Center is a
complex of eight interconnected
buildings of which the Palo Alto-Stan
ford Hospital Center occupies three
buildings at the north end. Of these
three, Stanford and Palo Alto each
have one building or "pavilion," and
they share the third "core" building
of which Stanford owns 65 percent
to Palo Alto's 35 per cent.
The Center cost more than $27 miK
lion to build and equip. The architect
was Edward Durell Stone, who also
designed the U.S. Embassy in New
Delhi and the U.S. Pavilion at the
1958 Brussels World's Fair.

The faculty report stated that Stan,,
ford must have a University Hospital
with 450 to 500 beds and the usual
supporting facilities such as operat
ing rooms and laboratories to sup
port its major effort in medical edu
cation, patient care, and research.
The report noted that if the Uni
versity did acquire the Hospital, mem
bers of the volunteer faculty, many of
whom also serve on the Palo Alto
medical staff, would continue to have
access to the University's facility for
hospitalization of patients from ths
community.
The Stanford Medical Center is a
complex of eight interconnected
buildings of which the Palo Alto-Stan
ford Hospital Center occupies three
buildings at the north end. Of these
three, Stanford and Palo Alto each
have one building or "pavilion," and
they share the third "core" building
of which Stanford owns 65 percent
to Palo Alto's 35 per cent.
The Center cost more than $27 miK
lion to build and equip. The architect
was Edward Durell Stone, who also
designed the U.S. Embassy in New
Delhi and the U.S. Pavilion at the
1958 Brussels World's Fair.
The Palo Alto City Council will
meet tonight to consider the city's fi
nance committee recommendation
that their share of the Palo Alto-Stan
ford Hospital be declared "not for
sale."
The committee made the recom
mendation after considering a joint
statement from the six city repre
sentatives on the hospital board of
trustees. The statement termed the
present hospital situation a "distinct
advantage to the Palo Alto resident."
"The magnet of 200 modern beds
under our control at Hoover Pavilion
—two or more yeans hence—does not
pull as strongly as continuing with
what we have and know, even though
future liason and cooperation appar

ently cannot be as close as it has been
in the past," reasoned a two-page pre
pared motion.
This evening's city council decision
will be in answer to Stanford's pro
posal, formalized in an August 8 let
ter from President Sterling to the
mayor of Palo Alto, to purchase the
city's interest in the Hospital and
make additional land available con
tiguous to the Herbert Hoover Pavil
ion for expansion of a community
hospital.
The University's actions in this re
gard was originally at the request
of the City of Palo Alto in a request
dated May 10, 1965, when they asked
Stanford to consider the possibilities
of obtaining Palo Alto's share of the
hospital.
Dr. Robert J. Glaser, Vice-Presi
dent for Medical Affairs and Dean
of the Medical School contacted yes
terday by the Daily commented that
Palo Alto's decision (to remain at
their present location) would be their
prerogative of course." He expalined
that, in that case, Stanford would
commence plans to build additional
facilities.
Sterling said in his letter to the
mayor of Palo Alto that he had now
been authorized by the Board of
Trustees to offer the city a "defini
tive" proposal. He wrote, "The Uni
versity is prepared to pay the City
a sum of money equivalent to the fair
market value of the City's share in
the building and equipment of the
Palo Alto-Stanford Hospital in order
to acquire such share.

"Based on a very preliminary an
alysis, we estimate this sum to be of
the order of $5 million; as soon as we
have that figure refined, we shall in
form you of it."
The decision to incorporate Palo
Alto's share of the Hospital was based
