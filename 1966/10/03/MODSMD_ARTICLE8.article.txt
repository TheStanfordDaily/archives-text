# STUDENT INTERVIEWS SET
## Overseas Subcommittee To Be Proposed 
### KIRK HANSON Managing Editor 
The Overseas Campus Board has
announced interviews Thursday and
Friday afternoons for a proposed Gen
eral Studies subcommittee on Over
seas Campuses. Such a subcommittee
was one of the proposals of the Mar
tindale Report last spring and will be
proposed to the General Studies Com
mittee at their meeting October 12
by Dr. Robert Walker, Chairman of
the General Studies Committee and
Director of the Overseas Campus Pro
gram.
The interviews will be held to
choose three students members of
the proposed permanent subcommit
tee. They will serve with four mem
bers from the faculty and administra
tion. The students are to be alumni of
the overseas campuses.
The primary responsibility of the

committee will be to consider and
act upon recommendations concern
ing academic affairs at the overseas
campuses. The names of three stu
dents to serve are to be proposed
with the plan for the subcommittee at
the General Studies Committee, meet
ing next week.
Bob Vestal, present chairman of the
Overseas Campus Board, said yester
day that the new subcommittee would
not replace the Board, which has per
formed a generally administrative
function since its creation.
The Board has operated the hostels
and aided in the orientation of new
groups, but has had little part in the
consideration of reforms in the Over
seas Campus program. Last year, an
Ad-Hoc Committee on Overseas Cam
puses was formed under Steve Martin
dale and in the spring issued its rec
ommendations for the program.
Besides the establishment of a sub

committee under the General Studies
Committee, the report advocated re
ducing the minimum number of units
to fourteen and at the same time of
fering a number of two-unit elective
courses to be taught by capable for
eign professors and instructors, and
allowing students more opportunity
to follow courses in directed reading.
The first Stanford Daily Overseas Poll
last week revealed that over 77 per
cent of the students in Italy XII and
France XII favored the reduction of
required units to fourteen.
Vestal pointed out that the new
subcommittee might place in doubt
the function of the continued Ad-Hoc
Committee, which is now under the
chairmanship of Sheldon Shaeffer.
Shaeffer told The Dally that he
thought the Ad-Hoc Committee would
still have a function preparing reports
and recommendations for the Gen
eral Studies subcommittee to consider.

It is speculated that the subcommit
tee, once adopted, would be given the
job of reviewing the Martindale Re
port and its proposals. Other specula
tion sees the November meeting at
Stanford-in-Italy of the directors oi
all the campuses as being crucial for
reform proposals.
The Overseas Campus Board is en-i
couraging alumni of the overseas
campuses to sign up for interviews
in the Overseas Campus Office early
this week. The Board seeks alumni
v.-ho are not in their last year at Stan-"
ford to serve on the new subcommit-"
tee.

consideration of reforms in the Over

Ad-Hoc Committee on Overseas Cam

dale and in the spring issued its rec
ommendations for the program.
Besides the establishment of a sub

committee under the General Studies
Committee, the report advocated re
ducing the minimum number of units
to fourteen and at the same time of
fering a number of two-unit elective
courses to be taught by capable for

allowing students more opportunity
to follow courses in directed reading.
The first Stanford Daily Overseas Poll
last week revealed that over 77 per
cent of the students in Italy XII and
France XII favored the reduction of
required units to fourteen.
Vestal pointed out that the new
subcommittee might place in doubt
the function of the continued Ad-Hoc
Committee, which is now under the
chairmanship of Sheldon Shaeffer.
Shaeffer told The Dally that he
thought the Ad-Hoc Committee would
still have a function preparing reports
and recommendations for the Gen
eral Studies subcommittee to consider.

It is speculated that the subcommit
tee, once adopted, would be given the
job of reviewing the Martindale Re
port and its proposals. Other specula
tion sees the November meeting at
Stanford-in-Italy of the directors oi
all the campuses as being crucial for
reform proposals.
The Overseas Campus Board is en-i

The Overseas Campus Board has
announced interviews Thursday and
Friday afternoons for a proposed Gen
eral Studies subcommittee on Over
seas Campuses. Such a subcommittee
was one of the proposals of the Mar
tindale Report last spring and will be
proposed to the General Studies Com
mittee at their meeting October 12
by Dr. Robert Walker, Chairman of
the General Studies Committee and
Director of the Overseas Campus Pro
gram.
The interviews will be held to
choose three students members of
the proposed permanent subcommit
tee. They will serve with four mem
bers from the faculty and administra
tion. The students are to be alumni of
the overseas campuses.
The primary responsibility of the

committee will be to consider and
act upon recommendations concern
ing academic affairs at the overseas
campuses. The names of three stu
dents to serve are to be proposed
with the plan for the subcommittee at
the General Studies Committee, meet
ing next week.
Bob Vestal, present chairman of the
Overseas Campus Board, said yester
day that the new subcommittee would
not replace the Board, which has per
formed a generally administrative
function since its creation.
