# McCarthyites Forced To Subpoena Names
## 
### BOB FISHMAN Senior Staff Writer 
The House Committee on Un-Ameri
can Activities asked for—and got
the University's list of officers in four
campus peace organizations.
But the Dean's Office divulged the
names only after the records had been
subpoenaed.
The four organizations involved
were the Stanford Committee for
1 eace in Vietnam, the Medical Aid
Committee, the Young Socialist Alli
ance, and the May Second Movement.
The names were used in connection

with HUAC hearings held August 16-
18 in Washington investigating alleged
Smith said.
aid to the North Vietnamese and the
Viet Cong. Two Stanford student,
Stuart Mcßae and Anatole Anton
were summoned to appear at the hear
ings.
Anton charged in Monday's Dally
that the Dean's Office had given
HUAC the complete membership list
of the four groups, and that this in
formation had been given "volun
tarily."
Associate Dean of Students Joel P.

Smith replied yesterday than Anton
was "categorically wrong."
"We have no complete membership
list of any student organization,"
He commented that staff members
of the House Committee had written
to the Dean's Office early in July ask
ing for a list of the officers and a
copy of the constitution of the peace
groups.
"Our usual policy in cases like this,"
Smith remarked, "is to refer all in
quiries about the membership of any
organization to the president ot the
organization."

According to Smith, "the Commit
tee concluded from our responses that
a subpoena would be necessary to
obtain the information."
The subjoena was not long in com
ing. On July 26 the Dean's Office re
ceived one calling for the list of stu
dent officers and a copy of the con
stitutions of the four groups.
"We sent in the information only
after receiving advice that the sub
poena compelled us to release it," said
Smith. "HUAC got nothing voluntar
ily."
In addition to the names and con

stitutions, Stanford officials also pro
vided under subpoena a photostatic
copy of a check for approximately
250 dollars from the student organiza
tions fund to Stuart Mcßae. This re
imbursed him for funds collected by
the Medical Aid Committee, which
were merged with a similar amount
from Berkeley and sent to the In
ternational Red Cross in Geneva,
designated for civilian use in North
Vietnam.
After several weeks delay, the Red
Cross accepted the check.
Anton, who never went to washing

ton to testify, asserted that the Uni
versity should never havp surrendered
the information even under threat of
subpoena.
"To do so," he said, "is to allow
the Committee to violate academic
freedom. Besides, there are good legal
grounds for not giving up the records.
The Suprome Court has already ruled
that a hearing held merely for the
purpose of exposing witnesses to bad
publicity is unconstitutional. And that,
I believe, was the real purpose of
the hearings."
