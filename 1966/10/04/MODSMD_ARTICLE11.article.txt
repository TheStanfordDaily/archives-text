# German Theater Group To Stage Bigotry Drama
## 
### 
A Gorman drama of eighteonth cen
tury bigotry, Nathan (lor Weise, will
be presented by a touring group of
professional German actors, Die
Bruecke.
The performance will be staged
Monday, October 17, in the Palo Alto
High School auditorium at 8:00 p.m.
Written by G. E. Lessing in 1779,
Nathan der Weise tells the story of
a Christian girl whose parents were
killed while she was still young.
Brought up by a Jewish merchant, the
girl gradually realizes that she was
born Christian. The play centers on
this conflict.
Plea For Tolerance
"Lessing pleads for religious toler
ance and understanding," explained
A. Peter Foulkes, Assistant Profes
sor of German and coordinator of the
program. "The author asserts that no
religion is superior to another and
that brotherhood between men is far
more important."
Because of passages condemning
bigotry and particularly antisemitism,
the play was banned by the Nazis dur
ing World War 11. "Several critics con

sider it the precursor of Hochhuth's
controversial drama, The Deputy."
Foulkes added.
Die Bruocke is on its first American
tour that will include Chicago, Phil
adelphia, Santa Barbara, and Harvard
in addition to Stanford. Past tours
have included performances in Tehe
ran, Tokyo, Melbourne, and Seoul.
Critics have termed the group "one
of West Germany's leading theatrical
groups."
Cast
The acting company includes sev
eral well-known German performers.
Peter Luhr, as Nathan, the wise and
shrewd Jewish merchant; and Dieter
Brammer, as the Patriarch of Jeru
salem, have received specific acclaim
from critics.
The Modern European Languages
Department is sponsoring the com
pany's visit to Stanford. Financial sup
port for the tour was given by the
Goethe-Institute in Munich.
Tickets, on sale at the Tresidder Box
