# YWCA Program Aids Friendships
## 
### 
An organizational meeting will be
held at the Clubhouse basement to
night at 7:30 for students interested
in participating in the 19G6-G7 "Ad
ventures in Friendship" program.
"Adventures in Friendship" was
started last year as a YWCA project
designed to bring elementary school
children and university students to
gether. According to YWCA director
Carol Young, the program is intended
to help children from an East Palo
Alto school who need personal con
tact with older persons.
Director Chris Elms said that all
eighty children involved last year
were in the fourth grade at Kava
naugh school. 24 Stanford students
participated in the program.
"Last year," said Mrs. Young, "we
intended to expose the children to new
experiences and take them to places
around the bay area we supposed they
had never seen."
"However," she said, "we found thai
most of them had already been on
school field trips to points of interest
in San Francisco. Many had older
brothers and sisters with cars, and
had already seen the places we in
tended to take them."
Change Of Emphasis
"This year," she said, "the emphasis
will be on personal contact and friend
ship with an older student, rather
than on exposure to new experiences."
"We're more interested in building
their self-confidence than opening
their eyes," commented Elms.
Those participating in the program
will be divided into small groups of
three students and nine children. The
individual groups may plan their own
activities such as games, picnics, and
story-telling sessions; groups will
meet three or four Saturdays a quar
ter, and one field trip will be planned
for each quarter.
"Everyone is invited to participate
in 'Adventures in Friendship,' " said
Elms. "We particularly need men be
cause many of these boys have no
father fiinire at home."
