## Dodgers Look Big Despite 3rd Base 
### BOB THIERIOT 
The World Series, which as usual will be somewhat anticlimatic
after the National League pennant race, begins this Wednesday
in Los Angeles. The LA Dodgers have never lost a World Series
in three attempts. The Baltimore Orioles, who won their first pen
nant in sixty-nine years, have never played in one. The National
League has dominated the baseball classic since 1959. The Orioles
though have some National League imports on the team, including
Stu Miller, Eddie Fisher, Moe Drabowsky, and the ever-present
Frank Robinson.
Believers and Robinsons
The World Series is so short that the teams must be viewed
on the basis of their short term abilities. Pitching becomes most
important because pitchers must pitch with little or no rest.
Each game is so vital that managers cannot sacrifice a game to
avoid chewing his bullpen into shreds. Other players must play
with racked legs, sore arms, and the flu. Other players must play
with his best lineup each game. Bad days (such as Sandy Koufax
getting bombed) and slumps (Frank Robinson not getting a hit
for seven games) can destroy a team's series hopes.
The Orioles' difficulties lie in weak starting pitchers and depen
dence on four big hitters. The two Robinsons, Boog Powell, and Curt
Blefary, must do well to give the Orioles any chance. The Birds are
definitely not noted for their complete games, and, in fact man
ager Hank Bauer never plans on one of his pitchers going nine
innings The bullpen, though, is very deep, and tremendously capable
of taking over for beraggled starting pitchers. The Orioles' defense
is excellent in the infield, but only adequate in the outfield. Brooks
Robinson is the best third baseman in the game. Baltimore presents
a formidable lineup with great homerun potential, led by Frank
Robinson, who was the most powerful offensive weapon in the
Major Leagues this year. If he continues his heroics, the Orioles
could bury the Dodgers. In Baltimore's Memorial Stadium which
has nearby friendly walls, he should have a field day, but in spacious
Dodger Stadium he might be lost.
Third Base?
The Dodgers have to be favored. Four games are scheduled for
Los Angeles. The Dodgers have a good lineup of consistant hitters.
If one is in a slump, there are many others who can pick up the
slack. The Dodger speed, not as devastating as in former years,
can still run the Orioles into confusion and fielding miscues. The
Dodgers defense is generally good, though not spectacular. If Ron
Fairly plays right field, his lack of speed is a liability. The Dodgers'
worst problem is third base, as it has been since the retirement of
Billy Cox. John Kennedy is a standout fielder, but a miserable hitter.
Dick Schofield is a good shortstop, not much at third base, and less
with the bat. Jim Gilliam is slow at third, slow with the bat, and
slow on the bases.
The Dogers pitching completely overshadows the Orioles'. Even
if the Birds can beat Sandy Koufax once, they have to face Claude
Osteen, which is no vacation, and Don Drysdale, who down the
stretch pitched great ball. If the Orioles can knock out the starter,
they then will have to combat long-men Bob Miller and Joe Moeller.
In the late innings manager Walt Alston has Phil Regan, a castoff
from the American League, and Ron Perronoski at his disposal.
Many Bills
The Dodgers also have the advantage in World Series experience.
Only three front line Orioles—Frank Robinson, Stu Miller, and Luis
Aparicio—have played in the World Series. Most of the Dodgers,
including recent acquisitions, have played in at least one. The
greater part of the LA starters have played in either two or three.
The pressure is not on the players to win just because it is th»»
World Series; the pressure is caused by the World Series paycheck,
which is considerably larger for the winners. The Dodgers are used
to close tense ballgames; most of the games they play are decided
by less than three runs. The Orioles, though, are used to destroying
their feeble American League opposition. The Birds will have to pull
off a heroic upset to tumble the high-flying Dodgers. They will have
to ruffle some very good pitchers, put down a constant flow of dis
turbing batters, and overcome the jitters.
The Dodgers look good enough to win; the Orioles? Would you
believe the Dodgers in six?


Donn Renwick was responsible
for the Indian 20-0 lead at half
time in Stanford's win against
Tnlane last Saturday. The de
fensive halfback intercepted a
Green Wave pass and scrambled
to the Tulane four yard line to
set up the Indian's second touch
down.
