# Committees Propose Definitive University Housing Investigation
## 
### MICHAEL COUZENS 
A major study of campus housing
is being organized by the ASSU which
"'ill include specific surveys of Stan
ford residences and will make recom
mendations based on a view of what
future housing should be.
Co-chaired by Wilbur sponsor Jan
Jacobi and Barrio Ramsay, the ASSU
Housing Committee will do most of
its work through six subcommittees
• rganized around present housing op
tions.
The Commission will sponsor a
Housing Conference November 1-2
with a guest speaker and seminars
open to the University community.
'Hie Housing Commission's formal
subcommittees are likewise open and
welcome participation by interested
students, faculty and staff.
Though the Commission will make
recommendations, it does not know
presently the form they will take.
According to Jacobi, "Although
members of the Housing Commission
have strong views on how Stanford
housing should be altered, we expect
to see these views modified as the
problems are studied.
"The Housing Commission will have
no party line, but will depend upon
the research of its individual subcom
mittees in order to formulate recom
mendations."
Jacobi hopes, nevertheless, that the
Lommission's report, which will be
submitted to the President and Legis
lature, February 15, can be based
upon educational goals.
"We must work to define the ideal,
our ideal of what system or systems
of housing would work best at Stan
ford in terms of the educational com
munity that we are seeking to estab
lish, and then we must outline plans

of how we can translate that ideal
into reality."

Commission, the Housing Commis

supercedes plans for a housing section
in the Education Commission, with the
same goal of sutdy and recommenda
tion.
