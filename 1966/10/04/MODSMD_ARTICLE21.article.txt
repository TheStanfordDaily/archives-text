# Stripes Beat Cards 5-3 In Initial Match
## 
### 
"If you score three goals, you
ought to win," soccer Coach
Fred Priddle commented after
Stanford's game at San Quen
tin last Sunday. But the Indians'
defense had too many leaks and
San Quentin triumphed, 5-3.
The Cards controlled the ball
almost 90 per cent of the time
and outshot their opponents
about 3-1. But San Quentin's
goalie, a big end from their foot
ball team, whom Priddle de
scribed as "fantastic," made one
save after another to bring the
inmates out of the game vic
torious.
Bill Palmer drew first blood
for the Cards, driving down the
left side of the field for a score
in the first period. But aided by
some sloppy Stanford goal-tend
ing, San Quentin, who had their
strongest team since the series
began, drove in two goals late in
the same period to take the
lead.
Co-captain John Cox tied it up
with a goal in the second period,
before the inmates scored again
to regain the lead. Cox, who was
commended by Priddle for out
standing play throughout the
game, tallied a second time with

ten minutes gone in the fourth
period, to tie the score, 3-3.
The Indian defense, however,
weakened by the loss of Dave
Wytock and Steve Spittler, the
starting fullbacks, was unable to
hold the lead. San Quentin drove
down the right side of the field
for the go-ahead goal and added
another for good measure In
the quarter.
Priddle was not discouraged
by the outcome of the game. He
singled out halfbacks John
Brandt, Pete Mooch and Roger
Goodan along with Cox for
special praise and noted that the
offense had done a good job.
