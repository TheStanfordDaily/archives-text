# The 						Coffee House
## 
### 
When Associate Dean of Students Joel Smith
came to Stanford last year, he admitted his sur
prise in finding so little cohesiveness in the stu
dent community. This was one of Smith s cen
-tral themes in supporting the changes in Uni
versity liquor regulations.
In spite of his sincere commitment to the
creation of a stronger academic and social com
munity among the student body, Smith is pres
ently siding against students in the controversy
over the ASSU Coffee House, AS-SUCH. As
Associate Dean of Students for Student Or
ganizations, he has blocked the Hams Adminis
tration's effort to operate AS-SUCH in the Civ
Library, which will soon be vacated.
AS-SUCH was opened this summer with the
support of the Legislature and operated in the
International Center. The coffee house met the
need for a student gathering place with more
privacy and atmosphere than the Union. With
a later closing hour than Tresidder, AS-SUCH
filled much the same role as the New Cellar
which operated on weekends last year in the
Women's Clubouse. Presently AS-SUCH is
homeless.
Much of Smith's opposition stems from his
fear of drug usage and passage in the coffee
house. Yet there is more to the administration
case than this. As a report by psychologist Mer
vin Freedman notes, no large cosmopolital cam
pus in America is immune from the drug prob
lem â€”with or without coffffe house.
The campus has come under the increasing at

tention of the local authorities with the passage
of stiffer state drug laws and the relaxation of
University liquor regulations. Apparently Smith
has weighed the possibile reaction of an already
anxious board of trustee and an increasingly
critical public in the event of a well-publicized
violation in the coffee house.
However we frankly wonder if Dean Smith s
decision does anything to increase the trust of
the public, while it assuredly offers no increase
in trust among students-administration relations.
Smith has suggested residence coffee houses
in the various dorms as a realistic alternative.
Yet with most graduate students and many un
dergraduates living off campus, it seems unwise
to tie the concept to a living group. In addition
any one coffee house could not provide the
flavor of an all-campus meeting place and
would only reflect the fractious divisions in the
University living system.
Currently the debate over AS-SUCH has
reached a stalemate. Smith is not yielding and
student leaders are clearly not satisfied with
alternatives. A student-administration confron
tation over the issue is inappropriate, and the
bitter consequences could add little to the over
all goals of student government. Logically the
next step in the controversy is referral to the
Committee of Fifteen. Although the body of
faculty, student and administrators has only ad
visory capacity, it successfully demonstrated its
ability last year to handle seeming impasses
while preserving trust among the disputants.
