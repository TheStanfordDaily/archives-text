## Wilbur And Branner Unite; Kick Kyger's View Of Goal 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
We are afraid that the article,
"Frosh Miss Goal" in Monday's
Dally says more about Mr. Mark
Kyger than it does about Juni
pero House, or, to use Mr. Kry
ger's words, "the male segment
of the new frosh class." Just
what is the goal which Mr. Kry
ger is telling the freshman that
they had, and in which they

failed last Saturday night? He
seems to think that the fellows
are trying to "change their im
age, and the attitudes of some of
the frosh women." But we ask,
what image and what attitude?
Apparently the attitude and im
age which Mr. Kryger wishes
freshmen to take is that fresh
men are "more turned on by
upperclassmen." I suppose it
would be nice for Mr. Kryger if
his article so intimidated the
freshmen that they would hide
and leave all the frosh women to
the upperclassmen.
No, this is neither a question
of Mr. Kryger's attitude and
image for freshmen nor it is a
question of changing images at
all. How can the freshmen have
strong images of and attitudes
about themselves? They have
been here two weeks.
Let us talk about goals of that
Junipero lounge painting party
for a minute. To create a master
piece of art, the party was not
intended. It was intended to give
the atmosphere of the lounge a
spirit instead of the four sterile
walls it had previously. This it
did without question. It was in
tended to be a refreshing change
from the band-in-one-corner,
booze-in-another (with which to

get the girls drunk) Searsville
grovel; it was intended to en
courage originality and person
ality, and to be a mixer requir
ing neither snow lines nor talk
about the weather. It was, as
such functions usually are, of
course, bordering on chaos.
But how successful was it? We
think if Mr. Kyger had obtained
a representative sample of fresh
man women who were present
he would have found that the
large majority of the women
(and most of the men) present
liked the function.
If Mr. Kyger is really bent on
attracting the freshman women
to upperclassmen, to the exclu
sion of freshman men, why does
n't he think up something new
rather than trying to write de
structive comments about what
someone else is doing.
But rather than simply grip
ing about an opinionated, de
structive article which really
mi6sed the point, we want to end
this comment affirmatively:
hereby inviting the freshmen of
Branner and Roble, and Mr. Ky
ger, to the Junipero kite-flying,
and bath-tub barbecue party.
Sunday afternoon, the 16th.
The fellows of Junipero
(All of us)
