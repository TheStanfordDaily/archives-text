# The 						Capitol Scenes
## Troops, Tanks, And The Gold Flow 
### Art Buchwald 
WASHINGTON — One of the
subjects brought up for discus
sion between American and
West German officials during
Chancellor Ludwig Erhard's
visit to Washington was the pur
chase of American arms. It
seems, in order to bridge the
balance of payments gap, the
United States wants the West
Germans to buy more American
arms.
The West Germans don't
really want to buy arms as they
feel they can't use them The
Americans maintain that if the
West Germans don't buy our
arms we'll have to cut down the
size of our troops in West Ger
many.
Let us listen in on a discussion
between an American diplomat
and a German diplomat that
probably never took place—or
then again probably did.
"Mr. Spiegal, my government
is very concerned about the cut
back in your ammunition and
armaments order for 1966."
"Herr Jones, I have explained
to you we don't need any more
American guns and ammunition.
We don't know what to do with
the stuff we have already."
"Mr. Spiegal, it is not for us to
tell you what to do with the
guns we sell you, but my gov
ernment is concerned with the
flow of gold from this country.
It's your duty as a free Western
nation to buy as much arms

from an ally as you possibly
can."
"But Great Britain wants to
sell us arms, too."
"Great Britain? Who defeated
you in World War II? The
Americans."
"But Great Britain held out all
along until you came into the
war. We owe her something."
"We've had American troops
stationed in Germany for 21
years. The least you can do is
buy a few lousy tanks and air
planes."

"We're a peaceful nation, Herr
Jones. We love everybody. Be
sides, those last American planes
we bought from you kept
crashing all the time."
"Mr. Spiegal, we have a brand
new plane that would be just up
your alley. It flies three times
the speed of sound, has aJr-to
air missiles and is perfect for
Jungle warfare."
"Herr Jones, why should we
need a plane for Jungle war
fare?"
"You never can tell when
you'll get back one of your Afri
can colonies."
"Why couldn't we buy some
thing else, a space rocket or a
communication satellite? Why
does it always have to be
arms?"
"Because we must have a
strong Germany if we're to keep
peace in Europe."
"That's what pot us in trouble

the last time. Maybe we should
buy LSD capsules instead?"
"Mr. Spiegal, I don't like to
use the hard sell, but how are
you fixed in chemical warfare?"
"We can't give it away. Herr
Jones, do you realize we have
enough rifles and machine gun«
now to arm every man, woman
and child in West Germany?"
"Ah, but have you thought
about the population explo
sion?"
"Couldn't we buy color tele
vision sets?"
"Mr. Spiegal, I must warn you
that if you refuse to buy armo
from us we will have to pull all
our troops out of Europe, and
you will be forced to become a
military nation."
"How could you do that to us?
We wouldn't even know where
to start."

arms.
The West Germans don't
really want to buy arms as they
feel they can't use them The
Americans maintain that if the
West Germans don't buy our
arms we'll have to cut down the
size of our troops in West Ger
many.
Let us listen in on a discussion
between an American diplomat
and a German diplomat that
probably never took place—or
then again probably did.
"Mr. Spiegal, my government
is very concerned about the cut
back in your ammunition and
armaments order for 1966."
"Herr Jones, I have explained
to you we don't need any more
American guns and ammunition.
We don't know what to do with
the stuff we have already."
"Mr. Spiegal, it is not for us to
tell you what to do with the
guns we sell you, but my gov
ernment is concerned with the
flow of gold from this country.
It's your duty as a free Western
nation to buy as much arms

from an ally as you possibly
can."
"But Great Britain wants to
sell us arms, too."
"Great Britain? Who defeated
you in World War II? The
Americans."
"But Great Britain held out all
along until you came into the
war. We owe her something."
"We've had American troops
stationed in Germany for 21
years. The least you can do is
buy a few lousy tanks and air
planes."

"We're a peaceful nation, Herr
Jones. We love everybody. Be
sides, those last American planes
we bought from you kept
crashing all the time."
"Mr. Spiegal, we have a brand
new plane that would be just up
your alley. It flies three times
the speed of sound, has aJr-to
air missiles and is perfect for
Jungle warfare."
"Herr Jones, why should we
need a plane for Jungle war
fare?"
"You never can tell when
you'll get back one of your Afri
can colonies."
"Why couldn't we buy some
thing else, a space rocket or a
communication satellite? Why
does it always have to be
arms?"
"Because we must have a
strong Germany if we're to keep
peace in Europe."
"That's what pot us in trouble

the last time. Maybe we should
buy LSD capsules instead?"
"Mr. Spiegal, I don't like to
use the hard sell, but how are
you fixed in chemical warfare?"
"We can't give it away. Herr
Jones, do you realize we have
enough rifles and machine gun«
now to arm every man, woman
and child in West Germany?"
"Ah, but have you thought
about the population explo
sion?"
"Couldn't we buy color tele
vision sets?"
"Mr. Spiegal, I must warn you
that if you refuse to buy armo
from us we will have to pull all
our troops out of Europe, and
you will be forced to become a
military nation."
"How could you do that to us?
We wouldn't even know where
to start."
