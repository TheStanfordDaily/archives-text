## 
### DICK LIVINGSTON Asst. Managing Editor 
The Institute of International Rela
tions (IIR) is looking for students who
arc interested in getting involved in
the study and practice of international
relations.
At the meeting of the Institute's Pol
icy Board yesterday afternoon in Tre
sidder, recruitment of personnel and
the role of the lIR at Stanford were
discussed at length.
A meeting for students interested in
the organization has been scheduled
for tomorrow at 4 p.m. in Tresidder.
An explanation of the functions of the
lIR will be given by President Stef
Halper.

At yesterday's Board meeting, Ad
ministrative Assistant Bill Meyer dis
cussed efforts by the Institute to "get
more substance into the llR's contri
bution to the University community."
He proposed clubs in areas of inter
national interest in an attempt to get
more students involved in the study
of foreign affairs. Foreign students
from the countries being studied and
professors would be invited to the in
formal sessions, Meyer explained.
"Last year our 'area weeks' lacked
real involvement with most campus
life," Meyer said. "We hope the club
idea will bring the lIR to more stu
dents."
Plans For 'Problems'
Richard Soja, lIR publicity chair
man, explained plans for conferences
this year on "Problems and the Future
of Asia" and "Guerilla Warfare and
Insurgency and American Policy."
Continuing the theme of involve
ment, Soja told the Board the lIR must
plan programs of "immediate value to
the Stanford student." He added that
students who participate in the Volun
teers in Asia program "get involved"
and said the lIR must bring that type
of involvement to other students.
Another innovation by the lIR this
year will be a conference on foreign
affairs for high school seniors this fall
on campus, Kurt Moses, a board mem
ber, explained.
Underdeveloped Countries
A conference on "Alternatives to
Revolution In Underdeveloped Coun
tries" and the annual "Asia Week" are
being planned for later in the academic
year, the board was told.
The Board also expressed interest in
helping foreign students arrange to
eat some meals with living groups,
eating clubs and fraternities on cam
pus. Information on this program is
available from the lIR.
In every area of discussion, Board
members strseesd the need for more
interested personnel. The information
session tomorrow is designed to help
students find the area in which they
would like to serve.

Halper.

At yesterday's Board meeting, Ad
ministrative Assistant Bill Meyer dis
cussed efforts by the Institute to "get
more substance into the llR's contri
bution to the University community."
He proposed clubs in areas of inter
national interest in an attempt to get
more students involved in the study
of foreign affairs. Foreign students
from the countries being studied and
professors would be invited to the in
formal sessions, Meyer explained.
"Last year our 'area weeks' lacked
real involvement with most campus
life," Meyer said. "We hope the club
idea will bring the lIR to more stu
dents."
Plans For 'Problems'
Richard Soja, lIR publicity chair
man, explained plans for conferences
this year on "Problems and the Future
of Asia" and "Guerilla Warfare and
Insurgency and American Policy."
Continuing the theme of involve
ment, Soja told the Board the lIR must
plan programs of "immediate value to
the Stanford student." He added that
students who participate in the Volun
teers in Asia program "get involved"
and said the lIR must bring that type
of involvement to other students.
Another innovation by the lIR this
year will be a conference on foreign
affairs for high school seniors this fall
on campus, Kurt Moses, a board mem
ber, explained.
