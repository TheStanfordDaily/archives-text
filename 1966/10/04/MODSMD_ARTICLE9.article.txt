# Sterling Appoints Board For Educational Probe
## 
### JAMES BRISCOE Associate Editor 
Dr. Wallace Sterling set in motion
a possible major review of Stanford's
educational program yesterday with
the appointment of an eight-man
planning committee.
Chaired by Dr. Sterling, the commit
tee will investigate how the study
"might be most effectively and im
aginatively carried out."
Consultation with the Deans of
Stanford's seven schools, the Aca
demic Council Executive Committee,
and the Faculty Advisory Board
showed "enthusiastic agreement" with
the need for a comprehensive review,
the first at Stanford since 1956.
Dr. Robert Wert, former Dean of
Undergraduate Education, and a mem
ber of the planning committee noted
that while Stanford already has sev
eral committees considering educa
tion, each is working in a relatively
narrow and bounded area. "I think
this study will be taking an overall
view of education at Stanford," he
said, "something that is beyond the
mandate of either the General Studies
Committee, or the Committee on Un
dergraduate Education."
Vice-Provost E. Howard Brooks, sec
retary of the planning committee,
commented that the committee will be
tackling at least three questions,
• Does anything need to be done?
• What areas need to be studied?
• What is the best way to study
these areas?
"A group which does not have any
operational responsibilities will be in
a better position to stand off and look
at these matters than present commit
tees," he added.
Dr. Sterling indicated that the plan
ning committee "should complete its

work as soon as possible, so that the
substantive review can begin."
Other members of the committee, in
addition to Sterling, Wert, and
Brooks include Herbert Parker,
School of Law; Ralph Smith, associate
executive head, Dept. of Electrical
Eng.; Mark Mancall, History Dept.;
Associate Provost Hubert Heffner;
and Student Body President Dave
Harris.
Harris expressed a certain skepti
cism concerning the study, comment
ing, "such committees frequently con
clude with substantially the same feel
ings they began with."
"I think the University can go right
on looking at itself at any time with
out calling a committee for that pur
pose," he added.

He also observed that there was "a
significant lack of students on the
committee."
Asked if his views would prevent
his working with the committee, he
said, "No, 1 think it will be helpful
to begin with frankness."
The last comparable review of edu
cation at Stanford took place between
19f>4 and 1956. However, that study
concerned itself only with undergrad
uate education, while the new review
will probably consider both graduate
and undergraduate programs, it was
learned.
A later review, completed in 1964 by
the General Studies Committee was
concerned only with the Freshman
year at Stanford.
