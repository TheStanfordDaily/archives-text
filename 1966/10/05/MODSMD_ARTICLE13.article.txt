# SDS To Establish Stanford Chapter
## 
### 
Students for a Democratic So
ciety, (SDS) one of the oldest
student activist organizations,
is establishing a Stanford chap
ter.
SDS has distinguished itself
nationally, and is known inter
nationally, for its work in pov
erty areas.
The University of Michigan is
the site of the original and still
most active chapter.
Michigan Students
SDS was founded when a
group of U. of M. students
dropped out of school and began
living in poverty areas, orga

nizing the communities, and
fighting unfair slum laws and
racial discrimination.
The organization grew rapid
ly in campuses all over the
country, and became involved
in many successful community
projects in the South, in Ap
palachia, and in Northern ghet
tos.
The purposes of the Stanford
SDS chapter will differ some
what from those of other radi
cal groups on campus. Terry
Horn, one SDS supporter states:
"We want to appeal to students
of many varying political be
liefs, even those who do not en
tirely support the position of
the New Left.

"We believe that there is
much to be gained by facing so
cial problems directly, rather
than viewing them in terms of
liberal ideologies or radical
cliches. We hope that SDS will
help repair rifts among stu
dents, and bring many factions
together," he explained.
"Our biggest difficulty," he
continued, "is communication.
Demonstrations and rallies have
made people aware that there
are differing ideas on such is
sues as the war, and civil rights,
but the demonstrations have
also caused people to distrust
our ideas.
"I think we must convince
people especially undergrade

ates, that student activism is
not subversive, but valuable
and necessary," he added.
No Preconceptions
Keith Lowe, one of five Stan
ford chapter co-foundens, agrees
that more students should be
come interested in an activism
free of preconceptions.
Lowe states that the first at
tempt of SDS to communicate
with the student body is a docu
mentary of the sit-ins last
spring, which wil go on sale
this week.
SDS members will be distribu
ting literature and discussing
their organization in White Pla
za tomorrow.

The purposes of the Stanford
SDS chapter will differ some
what from those of other radi
cal groups on campus. Terry
Horn, one SDS supporter states:
"We want to appeal to students
of many varying political be
liefs, even those who do not en
tirely support the position of
the New Left.

"We believe that there is
much to be gained by facing so
cial problems directly, rather
than viewing them in terms of
liberal ideologies or radical
cliches. We hope that SDS will
help repair rifts among stu
dents, and bring many factions
together," he explained.
"Our biggest difficulty," he
continued, "is communication.
Demonstrations and rallies have
made people aware that there
are differing ideas on such is
sues as the war, and civil rights,
but the demonstrations have
also caused people to distrust
our ideas.
"I think we must convince
people especially undergrade

ates, that student activism is
not subversive, but valuable
and necessary," he added.
No Preconceptions
Keith Lowe, one of five Stan
ford chapter co-foundens, agrees
that more students should be

Lowe states that the first at
tempt of SDS to communicate
with the student body is a docu
mentary of the sit-ins last
spring, which wil go on sale
this week.
SDS members will be distribu
ting literature and discussing
their organization in White Pla
