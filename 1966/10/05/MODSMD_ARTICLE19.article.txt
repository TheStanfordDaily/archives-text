# Weird Treasures Unearthed
## 
### GAIL ANDERSON 
"Exceedingly weird" is the
term used by Art Department
head Dr. Lorenz Eitner to de
scribe the collection of Victorian
momentos soon on display in the
Art Gallery under the name
"Treasures from Mrs. Stanford's
Basement."
The display, which runs from
Saturday through October 30,
could perhaps be better termed
"Treasures from the Museum
Basement." That was where the
items in the collection were un
earthed.
But after sampling the "weird"
conglomeration of bric-a-brac, ob
jects of vanity, and other me
morabilia, the Art Department
decided the first title to be more
appropriate. Dr. Eitner explained

the choice: "The personality of
Mrs. Stanford strongly pervades
the bizarrs miscellany."
Strange Victorian World
Objects in the collection came
to the museum from the dam
aged Stanford residence soon
after the earthquake of 1906.
They have lain in the museum
basement ever since, ignored or
unknown by all but a small
handful of people. In Dr. Eit
ner's words, they form "a buried
layer of Victorian life, preserved
in obscurity—a Pompeii of pre
earthquake California."
Only a fraction of Mrs. Stan
ford's surviving treasures, care
fully selected by the Art De
partment, will be housed in the
exhibit; most remain in the
basement. But the variety of ar

tides displayed presents a cross
section of the entire collection
and affords a glimpse into a
strange Victorian world.
It includes, besides glassware
and porcelain of
flamboyance, a selection of Gov
ernor Leland Stanford's walking
sticks and an astonishing array
of weapons, helmets and mili
tary gear—remnants of young
Leland's collection.
Objects Defy Identification
The dress uniform of General
Grant is also displayed, as are a
wide range of articles from toys
and games to objects of vanity
and fashion to implements of the
parlor, kitchen and stable. The
collection, according to Dr. Eit
ner, also includes a number o'
"objects so strange that thej
have defied all attempts at iden
tification."
The exhibition could be called
a sampling of un-modern design
The objects, which date for the
most part from about 1870 to
1900, exemplify nearly every
tendency of late-Victorian tast.
—solemn ostentation, whimsy,
sentimentality, and a touch of
the macabre.
