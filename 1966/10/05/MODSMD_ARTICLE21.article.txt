# Hammarskjold's 'Markings' Coming Out In Deluxe Edition
## 
### FRANCIE MARKS 
Dag Hammarskjold's Mark
ings will be issued in a deluxe
boxed edition Monday by Alfred
A Knopf, Inc. Since its first
American publication two years
ago, this extraordinary docu
ment has sold over 300,000
copies. It is now in its eighteenth
printing.
Markings records the inner
life of the former United Na
tions secretary general from
1925 to a few weeks before his
death in a plane crash in North
ern Rhodesia in 1961. Hammar
skjold described the manuscript
as a "sort of white book concern
ing my negotiations with myself
and with God."
The deluxe edition includes re
productions of two pages of the
original manuscript, in addition
to the notes and thoughts which
have moved readers for two
years.
Noble Self-Disclosure
The New York Times Book Re
view described the work as "the
noblest self-disclosure of spiri
tual struggle and triumph, per
haps the greatest testament of
personal devotion, published in
this century."
The volume is a collection
of personal notes from Hammar
skjold's diary. It .reveals the
character of a man who dedi
cated himself to God and to man
kind. Hammarskjofd felt that it
was his destiny to carry human
ity's burdens.
An obsession with self-sacrifice
dominates his writings. "He who
wills sacrifice will be sacrificed
—according to the measure of
his purity of heart."
Anguishing Loneliness
But Hammarskjold specified
that one must never "give him
self" with the expectation of be
ing admired for it. He said it

was "not I, but God in me" which
necessitated his painful self
surrender.
Hammarskjold's sense of per
sonal dedication kept him apart
from other men, and he felt an
anguishing loneliness. He wrote,
"The longest journey is the
journey inward—to the loneli
ness which is the final lot of all."
"The anguish of loneliness
brings blasts from the storm
center of death; only that can be
really yours which is another's,
for only what you have given,
be it only in the gratitude of ac
ceptance, is salvaged from the
nothing which some day will
have been your life."
Radiance Of A Wonder
Hammarskjold's religious phi
losophy stressed man's dedica
tion, rather than God's action.
"God does not die on the day
when we cease to believe in a
personal deity, but we die on the
day when our lives cease to be
illuminated by the steady radi
ance of a wonder, the source of
which is beyond all reason."
Markings is translated by
Leif Sjoberg and W. H. Auden
with a forward by Auden. The
deluxe edition was designed by
George Salter.

Noble Self-Disclosure
The New York Times Book Re
view described the work as "the
noblest self-disclosure of spiri
tual struggle and triumph, per
haps the greatest testament of
personal devotion, published in
this century."
The volume is a collection
of personal notes from Hammar
skjold's diary. It .reveals the
character of a man who dedi
cated himself to God and to man
kind. Hammarskjofd felt that it
was his destiny to carry human
ity's burdens.
An obsession with self-sacrifice
dominates his writings. "He who
wills sacrifice will be sacrificed
—according to the measure of
his purity of heart."
Anguishing Loneliness
But Hammarskjold specified
that one must never "give him
self" with the expectation of be
ing admired for it. He said it

was "not I, but God in me" which
necessitated his painful self
surrender.
Hammarskjold's sense of per
sonal dedication kept him apart
from other men, and he felt an
anguishing loneliness. He wrote,
"The longest journey is the
journey inward—to the loneli
ness which is the final lot of all."
"The anguish of loneliness
brings blasts from the storm
center of death; only that can be
really yours which is another's,
for only what you have given,
be it only in the gratitude of ac
ceptance, is salvaged from the
nothing which some day will
have been your life."
Radiance Of A Wonder
Hammarskjold's religious phi
losophy stressed man's dedica
tion, rather than God's action.
"God does not die on the day
when we cease to believe in a
personal deity, but we die on the
day when our lives cease to be
illuminated by the steady radi
ance of a wonder, the source of
which is beyond all reason."

life of the former United Na
tions secretary general from
1925 to a few weeks before his
