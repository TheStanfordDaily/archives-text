# ARNO POLO
## A
						Fetid Frolic In Firenze's Filthy Fly-Filled Fiume 
### Wells Shoemaker 
It was a sultry afternoon in
Florence as seven hardy Stan
ford students peered bravely
into a sluggish, vaguely green
ish Arno river.
"We're not really going to
play water polo in here, are
we? Tell me it's an RF. ..."
"Shut up and jump."
"Do cannon shots really raise
bodies?"
"Who cares, McGruff? Just
dive in. We'll get you back, that
is, if the eels leave anything."
First In
Laurence of Italia made the
initial plunge. The splash left a
gluey green mist suspended in
the thick summer air. The redo
lent essence of putrefied perch
commingled delicately with the
velvet fragrance of insalubrious
slime baking slowly under a lay
er of flies on the river bank.
The Shoe lurched in next,
greeting the viscous river with
a groan and a dull thud. Grit
ting their teeth, the Turk, Mc-
Gruff, Jason, Ab Norman and
Lorenzo il Magnifico soon fol
lowed.

Under the direction of the
Turk, 6carred and seasoned af
ter two years of Stanford var
sity water polo, the motley com
plement of pseudopoloists un
dertook an extensive warm-up
—consisting primarily of vigor
ous nose-holding.
National Champs
Then, behold! Rari Nantes
Florentia—ltalian National wa
ter polo champions — lined up
stiff-chested and firm-jawed on
the river bank. Resemblance to
a Mussolini firing squad was
perhaps more than coincidental.
The bronze and brawny Itali
ans entered the murk with ar
rogant indifference. The Floren
tines lurched rapidly to all cor
ners of the court attempting
with better than mild success to
snow their opponents with an
array of flashy shots and a va
riety of hungry grunts.
Perhaps as a symbol of what
lay ahead, the Italians substi
tuted Stanford's tame yellow
ball for a shiny, blood-red leath
er bomb.
Florence's coach blew his
whistle.
You Must Be Kidding
"Hey, I thought we were just
going to practice with these
buys," piped out McDruff.
"Yeah—nobody said anything
about a game," chirped Laur
ence of Italia.
"Grin and bear it," advised Ja
son sagely, "they're only human
beings."
"Bets," offered Ab Norman,
oddly.
"It can't hurt too bad — I

mean they'll play clean."
"In the Arno?" interrupted
Lorenzo il Magnigico.
"It's only a friendly game"
ventured McGruff, "They'll be
fair ..."
"Never mind — they're about
ready," stated the Shoe, lacing
up the issue.
The playing field, bounded by
a framework of floating boards,
measured a vast 20x30 meters
(BIG).
Cards Lose The Sprint
Italy won the sprint, a prece
dent establishing endeavor for
the afternoon's aqueous hu
mours. Stanford's squad was in

prime physical condition for
about five minutes of rugged,
international water polo. The
game lasted half an hour.
The Indians of Italy opened
strong. The Turk set up in the
dark hole and slammed a sweep
shot past il goli. Later, a Turk
roll-out blast gave Stanford two
tallies.
Meanwhile, the Italians man
aged to sneak eight shots past
the benevolent Tribe goalies.
Halftime left the Stanfordini
clinging to the boundary boards,
fagged but still hi g h-spirited.
That enthusiasm soon disap
peared. The super seven turned
around to gaze upon a veritable
conossieur's delight.
Conossieur's Delight
Floating upside-down in the
middle of the court were five
eyes-a-bulging, od o r-effulging
Arno carp. These gas-filled,
moss • covered beauties found
company with a soggy rat that
had ceased to struggle fifty
miles upstream.
A few rusty tin cans, a
broken doll's leg, and other as
sorted juicies added extra spice
to the field of play.
Ball Underwater!
Few penalties were called in
the second half, but one signifi
cant infraction was noted. A
Florentine pushed the ball be
neath the surface into the un
known. This ordinarily innocu
ous action delayed the game five
minutes until the official could
locate another ball to replace
the one lost, forever in the deep,
dank tarn.
As the final whistle blew,
Stanford's seven heroes had
achieved a walloping 3 -15
moral victory, and reluctantly
clambered from the turgid wa
ter. Most were happy to affirm
that their toes were still there,
not having seen them for quite
some time.
Florence thoughtfully sup
plied the Americans with steel
wool, wire brushes, and cold
chisels to assist with showers.
The valiant seven returned to
the Villa San Paolo amidst an
uproarious welcome and settled
down for a hearty Italian din
ner:
—marinated herring for hors
d'oevres, proceeded shortly by
—scallop shell pasta with anch
ovies, followed by a main
course of
—cold fish steak, served with
spinach and olive oil, with
—imported water cress for des
sert.
The boys weren't hungry.
