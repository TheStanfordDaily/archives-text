# Intramural Football Slate Begins Today
## 
### BOB EGELKO 
Stanford's second-most-partici
pated-in program—after General
Studies—will be renewed today
when eight touch football games
kick off the '66-'67 intramural
program.
Eight-four teams representing
sixty houses, fraternities, eating
clubs, graduate schools and mis
cellaneous groups begin first
round play this week, with thq
main targets being the campus
.football title, held by Phi Delta'
Theta, and the overall crown,
won last year by Donner House.
The IM program has a new di
dector, Gary Ness, replacing Joe
Higgins who is now director of
Wilbur Hall; a new field, the con
verted Harry Maloney soccer
field, which will become the cen
ter ring of the murals circus,
with plenty of room for specta
tors; and a new high in football
sign-ups.
Phi Delts Still Tough
One thing that may not be
new, though, is the football
champion. The Phi Delts, con
vincing vistors over Fremont
in last year's finals, have lost
only two men from that squad,
and have picked up enough tal
ent from frosh teams to be re
garded as definite preseason fav
orites.
First team with a shot at them
will be the Betas, this Saturday
at 11.
A number of the fraternity
powers will meet head-on in the
first round, with interest center
ing on the Theta Delt-Deke and
DU-Phi Kap clashes today, and
the KA-Delt game tomorrow, all
at 4:15.
Donner, whose Athenian intra
mural philosophy everybody
plays — won them a stunning
overall victory last year, will
meet Lassen tomorrow, while
Fremont, which lost the Stern
league title to Muir in its open
ing game and didn't lose again
until the University finals, takes
on Muir again at 10 Saturday.

A shortage of officials may
necessitate playing some games
on a self-policing basis, accord
ing to Ness. Several Eastern
schools that wore forced to take
a similar step with all their
games last year have written to
Stanford about the results, and,
says Ness, "It worked better
than anything they'd tried be
fore."
Another change concerns the
use of graduates with varsity
-letters playing in a related intra
mural sport. Allowed last year
on a trial basis, this practice
will be outlawed this year, due
to inequities that appeared when
it was permitted.
Sign-up deadlines for five
other intramural sports are ap
proaching.
Two-man volleyball, basket
ball free throws, and doubles
tennis teams must sign the lists
at Encina Gym by 5:00 today.
Bowling and pocket billiards
sign-up end at noon Friday.
Lists for Sigma Delta Psi, the
national honorary athletic fra
ternity, and cross-country will
be posted later in the quarter.
Murals schedules will appear
every day on The Daily sports
pages. Football games will be
gin at 4:15 Monday through
Thursday afternoons, and at 9,
10 and 11 on Saturday morn
ings.
