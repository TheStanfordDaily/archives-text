# The 						Legislature
## 
### 
Legislature begins anew tonight. Often pillo
ried in the past, it deserves a clean slate. The
only reasonable prediction to make about Leg
islature 1966-67 is that it will be different from
those of the years past.
Three years ago, Legislature was an amicable
chitchat club. But the past two years have seen
it assert its statutory powers. This is largely at
tributable* to two strong speakers: Ed Shaw, a
legend in his own time, and Jay Kadane, now an
assistant professor of statistics at Yale.
In accord with government textbook models,
Legislature is the policy-making body of the
Associated Students. The student body presi
dent, whether eloquent or mute, is obliged by
statute only to be its chief administrator. Leg
islature's policies control the student judiciary
and govern the disbursements of a $127,500
budget.
Two unfortunate extremes have characterized
the use of this power in the past. On one hand,
cataclysmic outbursts over specific issues have
left a history of reaction and inconsistency. On
the other, procedural difficulties have caused in
terminable sessions of what G. B. Shaw called
"parliamentary cockfighting." Legislature has
been too quick to express itself, or too slow.
There is reason to hope for something better
this year. Tom Forstenzer, the acting Speaker,
has wisely chosen to defer permanent commit
tee appointments until the body learns to feel
its way. He will also postpone the Speaker elec-

tion while new members acquaint themselves
with their responsibilities. This will help to miti
gate the cyclical convulsions in attitude which
yearly beset student government.
But the quality of Legislature must still rest
with its members, particularly the many new
ones. They must remember to he representative
and to maintain goals not tied to issues and
adversaries.
Perennial criticism that Legislature is not rep
resentative cannot be answered by procedural
juggling of constituencies. It is an ethical, not a
technical, matter. Any legislator from a campus
residence who does not use his position to trans
mit information between student government
and his constituents violates the trust with which
he accepted the office. A knowledge of both
ends is necessary if his decisions are to be con
structive.
Legislature must also develop goals beyond
the issues: coffee house, open hours, or what
ever they will be. These flare-ups are trival
when set against the necessity for Legislature to
define itself in relation to a strong executive
and to a university in need of thoughtful stu
dent viewpoints.
Without such goals, the issues which rise and
fall every year will be battled out instead of
thought out. With them, issues will fit into a
broader context which recognizes individuals
over causes and seeks to free their vitality in
an interacting community. M. C.
