# FORSTENZER, SPEAKER
## New Legislature To Open 
### STEVE GRUBER Political Editor 
The Legislature of the Associated
Students of Stanford University
(LASSU) will attempt to get settled
tonight for the coming year.
No important legislation is expected
to be passed, but Tom Forstenzer will
probably announce that he will not

continue as LASSU speaker.
' Forsternzer told The Daily that he
would rather fill the vacant liaison
officer position. He will not resign as
Speaker until LASSU gets organized,
however.
"The speakership is a technical posi
tion. It can be more than that if the
Speaker is willing to spend more

time," he commented. Forstenzer does
not think that he can devote an ade
quate amount of time to the job.
Other LASSU business will include
the submission of the Committee of
Fifteen members for approval.
An interim rules committee will
also be appointed. The permanent
committee will be established as soon
as all of the living groups have had
their elections. Wilbur Hall \\ ill not
have any representation at tonight's
meeting, due to the failure of the in
dividual houses to hold elections this
week.
Housing Commission
The new Housing Commission's by
laws will be read for the first time.
This measure would set up a group
of students, faculty, and possible staff
members to make an in-depth study
of the campus housing situation. It
will be similar to Education Commis
sion.
Six subcommittees will compose the
Housing Commissions and they will
be expected to report back to LASSU
by February 15.
Jan Jacobi and Barrie Ramsay will
chair the Commission.
Appointments to the regular Legis
lature committees are also expected to
be approved tonight.
