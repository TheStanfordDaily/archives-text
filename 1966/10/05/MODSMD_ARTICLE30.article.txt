## The 						Spirit Of Asilomar 
### Jan Jacobi 
"And it is a chant of the sea as
has never been chanted, and it
is the Sea in us that will chant
it . . . St. John Perse
Asilomar . . . "haven by the
sea" . . . where the wind off the
sea blows colder now and we
seek the warmth of the fire on
the beach . . . Dr. Wright speaks
softly of his days in Spain dur
ing the Civil War ... in his
voice there is a strength and
sadness that moves us deeply
. . . there is a spirit here that
has in a very short time come
to bind us all closely together
. . . perhaps it is the sea . . .
At the invitation of Dave Har
ris and Tim Haight, with the
support of Deans Funk and
Hind and the office of Under
graduate Education, thirty-four
faculty members, administra
tive officers, and students met
together at Asilomar on June
13 and 14 to discuss all aspects
of undergraduate education.
What occurred at Asilomar was
of great hope and promise for
us all—for a while there was
open disagreement oil two vital
issues, the Harris ideal of the
university and the role of the
student in the decision-making
process, there was agreement
on other important issues that
overshadowed these differences.
Perhaps most important of all
was not the agreement that was
reached but the way in which
it was achieved.
Refusal To Listen
The general session that
opened the conference on Mon
day morning remains as a grim
reminder to many of us of what
can happen when two sides in
any argument refuse to listen
to each other. As Prof. Drekme
ier remarked, it was apparent
that if the discussion continued
in the manner in which it was
proceeding, like all Gaul, we
would soon be split into three
parts. And so we might have
been if it had not been for lunch
and the meetings we had in
smaller groups in the early af
ternoon.
It was in these four separate
discussion groups that after
noon that the true possibilities
of the conference became clear
to us. For the protagonists on
both sides began to listen to

each other — there began to be
hope for some basis of agree
ment. That hope proved vain at
the general session on Monday
afternoon as the issue of stu
dent participation in decisions
stirred passionate, sometimes ir
rational, feelings on both sides
again. We would have to wait
for tomorrow.
Tuesday Brought Hope
Tuesday morning we again
separated into four smaller dis
cussion groups. The atmosphere
of these smaller groups, one of
friendship and cordialty, paved
the way for the highlight of the
conference, the general session
of Tuesday afternoon.
It was at this extraordinary
meeting that the participants of
the conference voted unani
mously to work for the institu
tion of a pass-fail grading sys
tem for the freshman year, for
alternatives to the grading sys
tem in general (in the belief
that grades inhibit the desire to
learn), for the end of segre
gated freshman housing, for
more honors programs and for
more imaginative programs of
independent study (possibly a
program paralleling the Yale pro
gram of "the scholar of the
house"), for the possibility of
using undergraduates as teach
ers, for the establishment and
unified support of an experi
mental college (now the Experi
ment), and for increasing the
efficiency of the quarter sys
tem.
Progress Toward Goal
To those of us present these
appeared to be significant steps
toward the ideal educational
community we all desire to see
established at Stanford. Truly
they seemed to be the first steps
of a journey that will be longer
than a thousand miles.
The lesson of Asilomar was
that while faculty, students, and
administrators could not agree
on a definition of an ideal edu
cational community, they could
come to an agreement on steps
that will lead to it. There are
unresolved issues and they will
loom larger as we progress
further, but at least we have
found a basis for and a method
that may lead to agreement on
even these problems.
