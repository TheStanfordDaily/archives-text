# Letters To The Editor
## Potpourri: Lists, Frosh, Coffee House 
### 
ft(11 tor, The Daily:
Since Stanford neither re
quests nor keeps lists of the
members for any voluntary orga
nization, it is difficult to under
stand how these could be turned
over to the House Committee on
Un-American Activities.
The only names submitted to
the committee were the officers
of voluntary organizations, as
stipulated in a subpoena. As at
Berkeley and Michigan, these
were furnished only after legal
consultation.
This information was prompt
ly reported by the University
and published in the press this
summer.

Editor, The Daily:
Mark Kyger's article, "Frosh
Miss Goal," is a complete mis
representation of the way most
freshman women feel. The idea
that we are "more easily turned
on by upperclassmen" than by
members of our own class is one
that the upperclassmen hold, not
the freshman women. To state
that we can be so easily swayed
by age and grade is an insult
to any Stanford "dollie."

We hope the freshman men
will realize that we are not as
impressionable as everyone
seems to think, that we like Wil
bur parties as much as frat par
ties, and that we enjoy fresh
man men as much as sopho
mores, juniors, and seniors. We
conclude that the frosh have
not missed their goal; rather, a
Daily reporter missed his.

• A Clarification
Editor, The Daily:
In reply to yesterday's letter
to the editor from the residents
of Junipero concerning an arti
cle appearing under my name
in the DAILY of October 3rd,
I would like to clarify a few
items which might set their
mind at ease.
First, I certainly would not
like to see the frosh females
abandon freshmen in favor of
upperclassmen, and my article
was not designed for this pur
pose.
Secondly, the letter from Ju
nipero states, "It was intended
to be a refreshing change from
the bandin-one-corner, booze-in
another (with which to get the
girls drunk) Searsville grovel;
it was intended to encourage
originality and personality, and
to be a mixer requiring neither
snow lines nor talk about the
weather." However, the distinct
impression that I got from my

interviews with several Branner
residents was that, although the
party started in this fashion, it
soon became exactly what it
was trying to avoid. Several of
the girls, whose names I have
in my notes, complained about
the possessiveness of the boys
which soon ruined the party as
an attempt to be a "mixer." The
girls also complained of the
drinking.
However, I personally en
joyed the party while I was
there Saturday night, and I felt
that it was a great Idea, and
certainly original. I also make
no attempt to deny that the
boys enjoyed the party im
mensely, at least judging from
the comments of the Junipero
residents that I interviewed be
fore writing my article. Further
more, the girls did enjoy the
party, at first.
In summary, I wish to «om
mend the men of Junipero for
their idea, and assure them that
my feature was not designed as
criticism of them. However, I
still feel that it is a shame that
the party did get out of hand to
the extent that it provoked
some of the comments which I
heard from the girls in Bran
ner. I do hope though that Juni
ptro, and some of the other
houses in Wilbur, will be able
to come up with other refresh
ing ideas for parties and mixers
because it will certainly make
our freshman year much more
enjoyable.
MARK KYGER

• First Rale Education
Editor, The Dally;
Stanford is attaining a No. 1
position again, but this time in
a category no less ignominous
than tuition cost.
I am a fifth year student at
Stanford, entering the first year
of grad school and I have never
received a dime from scholar
ship or grant. I have just put
out $570 for the first quarter of
a year that will cost $1710 in tui
tion. High? Yes. But wait. Next
year the price will go up $85 a
quarter for a grand total of
$1965. One year's tuition. That
will be exactly double the tui
tion rate of my freshman year.
The rise in tuition has been
going on for some time. Origi
nally, they promised that $500
would be the limit. True? No.
Later they said the PACE pro
gram would underwrite every
thing — and hit us undergrads
for funds.
I ask the administration for a
little restraint in their tuition
policies. They've given liquor to
the "partyboys" and political
power to the "beards". How
about aiding the legitimate?

Editor, The Daily:
Why is Dean Joel Smith
afraid? What is the fear that
has made him close down the
ASSU coffiee house, the most

significant and necessary addi
tion to the Stanford community
in years? He says he is afraid
of outside police investigation
of the drug users who will nec
essarily populate such a place.
But why isn't he afraid of the
CIA in the electrical engineering
department? And why wasn't he
afraid of the U.S. Army last
August? Isn't one qv>tside police
force as bad as anbthkr?
But maybe it is something
closer to home. Maybe Dean
Smith is afraid that students
talking in a coffee house will
eventually get around to talking
about the function of administra
tors. And maybe they will real
ize that he is here to serve
them, not they him, and that he
is just like the janitors and
switchboard operators, who are
also here to serve them. Maybe
Dean Smith thinks that he can
stop this kind of subversive talk
by forbidding the coffee house.
But I'll tell you something,
Dean Smith. It is going to hap
pen anyway. And pretty soon
there is going to be a big rally
in White Plaza, and all of the
junkies and beatniks and long
haired athletes are going to
march to your office and present
you with a broom. And while
you are out sweeping the Inner
Quad, they are going to set up a
coffee house in your office and
sit around and talk about other
ways of making Stanford a
more decent place to get an edu
cation.

has made him close down the
ASSU coffiee house, the most

significant and necessary addi
tion to the Stanford community
in years? He says he is afraid
of outside police investigation
of the drug users who will nec
essarily populate such a place.
But why isn't he afraid of the
CIA in the electrical engineering
department? And why wasn't he
afraid of the U.S. Army last
August? Isn't one qv>tside police
force as bad as anbthkr?
But maybe it is something
closer to home. Maybe Dean
Smith is afraid that students
talking in a coffee house will
eventually get around to talking
about the function of administra
tors. And maybe they will real
ize that he is here to serve
them, not they him, and that he
is just like the janitors and
switchboard operators, who are
also here to serve them. Maybe
Dean Smith thinks that he can
stop this kind of subversive talk
by forbidding the coffee house.
But I'll tell you something,
Dean Smith. It is going to hap
pen anyway. And pretty soon
there is going to be a big rally
in White Plaza, and all of the
junkies and beatniks and long
haired athletes are going to
march to your office and present
you with a broom. And while
you are out sweeping the Inner
Quad, they are going to set up a
coffee house in your office and
sit around and talk about other
ways of making Stanford a
more decent place to get an edu
cation.

Mark Kyger's article, "Frosh
Miss Goal," is a complete mis
representation of the way most
freshman women feel. The idea
that we are "more easily turned
on by upperclassmen" than by
members of our own class is one
that the upperclassmen hold, not
the freshman women. To state
that we can be so easily swayed
by age and grade is an insult
to any Stanford "dollie."

We hope the freshman men
will realize that we are not as
impressionable as everyone
seems to think, that we like Wil
bur parties as much as frat par
ties, and that we enjoy fresh
man men as much as sopho
mores, juniors, and seniors. We
conclude that the frosh have
not missed their goal; rather, a
Daily reporter missed his.

Editor, The Daily:
In reply to yesterday's letter
to the editor from the residents
of Junipero concerning an arti
cle appearing under my name
in the DAILY of October 3rd,
I would like to clarify a few
items which might set their
mind at ease.
First, I certainly would not
like to see the frosh females
abandon freshmen in favor of
upperclassmen, and my article
was not designed for this pur
pose.
Secondly, the letter from Ju
nipero states, "It was intended
to be a refreshing change from
the bandin-one-corner, booze-in
another (with which to get the
girls drunk) Searsville grovel;
it was intended to encourage
originality and personality, and
to be a mixer requiring neither
snow lines nor talk about the
weather." However, the distinct
impression that I got from my

interviews with several Branner
residents was that, although the
party started in this fashion, it
soon became exactly what it
was trying to avoid. Several of
the girls, whose names I have
in my notes, complained about
the possessiveness of the boys
which soon ruined the party as
an attempt to be a "mixer." The
girls also complained of the
drinking.
However, I personally en
joyed the party while I was
there Saturday night, and I felt
that it was a great Idea, and
certainly original. I also make
no attempt to deny that the
boys enjoyed the party im
mensely, at least judging from
the comments of the Junipero
residents that I interviewed be
fore writing my article. Further
more, the girls did enjoy the
party, at first.
In summary, I wish to «om
mend the men of Junipero for
their idea, and assure them that
my feature was not designed as
criticism of them. However, I
still feel that it is a shame that
the party did get out of hand to
the extent that it provoked
some of the comments which I
heard from the girls in Bran
ner. I do hope though that Juni
ptro, and some of the other
houses in Wilbur, will be able
to come up with other refresh
ing ideas for parties and mixers
because it will certainly make
our freshman year much more
enjoyable.

Editor, The Dally;
Stanford is attaining a No. 1
position again, but this time in
a category no less ignominous
than tuition cost.
I am a fifth year student at
Stanford, entering the first year
of grad school and I have never
received a dime from scholar
ship or grant. I have just put
out $570 for the first quarter of
a year that will cost $1710 in tui
tion. High? Yes. But wait. Next
year the price will go up $85 a
quarter for a grand total of
$1965. One year's tuition. That
will be exactly double the tui
tion rate of my freshman year.
The rise in tuition has been
going on for some time. Origi
nally, they promised that $500
would be the limit. True? No.
Later they said the PACE pro
gram would underwrite every
thing — and hit us undergrads
for funds.
I ask the administration for a
little restraint in their tuition
policies. They've given liquor to
the "partyboys" and political
power to the "beards". How
about aiding the legitimate?

Editor, The Dally;
Stanford is attaining a No. 1
position again, but this time in
a category no less ignominous
than tuition cost.
I am a fifth year student at
Stanford, entering the first year
of grad school and I have never
received a dime from scholar
ship or grant. I have just put
out $570 for the first quarter of
a year that will cost $1710 in tui
tion. High? Yes. But wait. Next
year the price will go up $85 a
quarter for a grand total of
$1965. One year's tuition. That
will be exactly double the tui
tion rate of my freshman year.
The rise in tuition has been
going on for some time. Origi
nally, they promised that $500
would be the limit. True? No.
Later they said the PACE pro
gram would underwrite every
thing — and hit us undergrads
for funds.
I ask the administration for a
little restraint in their tuition
policies. They've given liquor to
the "partyboys" and political
power to the "beards". How
about aiding the legitimate?

Why is Dean Joel Smith
afraid? What is the fear that
has made him close down the
ASSU coffiee house, the most

significant and necessary addi
tion to the Stanford community
in years? He says he is afraid
of outside police investigation
of the drug users who will nec
essarily populate such a place.
But why isn't he afraid of the
CIA in the electrical engineering
department? And why wasn't he
afraid of the U.S. Army last
August? Isn't one qv>tside police
force as bad as anbthkr?
But maybe it is something
closer to home. Maybe Dean
Smith is afraid that students
talking in a coffee house will
eventually get around to talking
about the function of administra
tors. And maybe they will real
ize that he is here to serve
them, not they him, and that he
is just like the janitors and
switchboard operators, who are
also here to serve them. Maybe
Dean Smith thinks that he can
stop this kind of subversive talk
by forbidding the coffee house.
But I'll tell you something,
Dean Smith. It is going to hap
pen anyway. And pretty soon
there is going to be a big rally
in White Plaza, and all of the
junkies and beatniks and long
haired athletes are going to
march to your office and present
you with a broom. And while
you are out sweeping the Inner
Quad, they are going to set up a
coffee house in your office and
sit around and talk about other
ways of making Stanford a
more decent place to get an edu
cation.

Mark Kyger's article, "Frosh
Miss Goal," is a complete mis
representation of the way most
freshman women feel. The idea
that we are "more easily turned
on by upperclassmen" than by
members of our own class is one
that the upperclassmen hold, not
the freshman women. To state
that we can be so easily swayed
by age and grade is an insult
to any Stanford "dollie."

We hope the freshman men
will realize that we are not as
impressionable as everyone
seems to think, that we like Wil
bur parties as much as frat par
ties, and that we enjoy fresh
man men as much as sopho
mores, juniors, and seniors. We
conclude that the frosh have
not missed their goal; rather, a

• A Clarification
Editor, The Daily:
In reply to yesterday's letter
to the editor from the residents
of Junipero concerning an arti
cle appearing under my name
in the DAILY of October 3rd,
I would like to clarify a few
items which might set their
mind at ease.
First, I certainly would not
like to see the frosh females
abandon freshmen in favor of
upperclassmen, and my article
was not designed for this pur
pose.
Secondly, the letter from Ju
nipero states, "It was intended
to be a refreshing change from
the bandin-one-corner, booze-in
another (with which to get the
girls drunk) Searsville grovel;
it was intended to encourage
originality and personality, and
to be a mixer requiring neither
snow lines nor talk about the
weather." However, the distinct
impression that I got from my

interviews with several Branner
residents was that, although the
party started in this fashion, it
soon became exactly what it
was trying to avoid. Several of
the girls, whose names I have
in my notes, complained about
the possessiveness of the boys
which soon ruined the party as
an attempt to be a "mixer." The
girls also complained of the
drinking.
However, I personally en
joyed the party while I was
there Saturday night, and I felt
that it was a great Idea, and
certainly original. I also make
no attempt to deny that the
boys enjoyed the party im
mensely, at least judging from
the comments of the Junipero
residents that I interviewed be
fore writing my article. Further
more, the girls did enjoy the
party, at first.
In summary, I wish to «om
mend the men of Junipero for
their idea, and assure them that
my feature was not designed as
criticism of them. However, I
still feel that it is a shame that
the party did get out of hand to
the extent that it provoked
some of the comments which I
heard from the girls in Bran
ner. I do hope though that Juni
ptro, and some of the other
houses in Wilbur, will be able
to come up with other refresh
ing ideas for parties and mixers
because it will certainly make

the bandin-one-corner, booze-in
another (with which to get the
girls drunk) Searsville grovel;
it was intended to encourage
originality and personality, and
to be a mixer requiring neither
snow lines nor talk about the
weather." However, the distinct
impression that I got from my

interviews with several Branner
residents was that, although the
party started in this fashion, it
soon became exactly what it
was trying to avoid. Several of
the girls, whose names I have
in my notes, complained about
the possessiveness of the boys
which soon ruined the party as
an attempt to be a "mixer." The
girls also complained of the
drinking.
However, I personally en
joyed the party while I was
there Saturday night, and I felt
that it was a great Idea, and
certainly original. I also make
no attempt to deny that the
boys enjoyed the party im
mensely, at least judging from
the comments of the Junipero
residents that I interviewed be
fore writing my article. Further
more, the girls did enjoy the
party, at first.
In summary, I wish to «om
mend the men of Junipero for
their idea, and assure them that
my feature was not designed as
criticism of them. However, I
still feel that it is a shame that
the party did get out of hand to
the extent that it provoked
some of the comments which I
heard from the girls in Bran
ner. I do hope though that Juni
ptro, and some of the other
houses in Wilbur, will be able
to come up with other refresh
ing ideas for parties and mixers
because it will certainly make
our freshman year much more
enjoyable.

Editor, The Dally;
Stanford is attaining a No. 1
position again, but this time in
a category no less ignominous
than tuition cost.
I am a fifth year student at
Stanford, entering the first year
of grad school and I have never
received a dime from scholar
ship or grant. I have just put
out $570 for the first quarter of
a year that will cost $1710 in tui
tion. High? Yes. But wait. Next
year the price will go up $85 a
quarter for a grand total of
$1965. One year's tuition. That
will be exactly double the tui
tion rate of my freshman year.
The rise in tuition has been
going on for some time. Origi
nally, they promised that $500
would be the limit. True? No.
Later they said the PACE pro
gram would underwrite every
thing — and hit us undergrads
for funds.
I ask the administration for a
little restraint in their tuition
policies. They've given liquor to
the "partyboys" and political
power to the "beards". How
about aiding the legitimate?

Editor, The Daily:
Why is Dean Joel Smith
afraid? What is the fear that
has made him close down the
ASSU coffiee house, the most

significant and necessary addi
tion to the Stanford community
in years? He says he is afraid
of outside police investigation
of the drug users who will nec
essarily populate such a place.
But why isn't he afraid of the
CIA in the electrical engineering
department? And why wasn't he
afraid of the U.S. Army last
August? Isn't one qv>tside police
force as bad as anbthkr?
But maybe it is something
closer to home. Maybe Dean
Smith is afraid that students
talking in a coffee house will
eventually get around to talking
about the function of administra
tors. And maybe they will real
ize that he is here to serve
them, not they him, and that he
is just like the janitors and
switchboard operators, who are
also here to serve them. Maybe
Dean Smith thinks that he can
stop this kind of subversive talk
by forbidding the coffee house.
But I'll tell you something,
Dean Smith. It is going to hap
pen anyway. And pretty soon
there is going to be a big rally
in White Plaza, and all of the
junkies and beatniks and long
haired athletes are going to
march to your office and present
you with a broom. And while
you are out sweeping the Inner
Quad, they are going to set up a
coffee house in your office and
sit around and talk about other
ways of making Stanford a
more decent place to get an edu
cation.

Since Stanford neither re
quests nor keeps lists of the
members for any voluntary orga
nization, it is difficult to under
stand how these could be turned
over to the House Committee on
Un-American Activities.
The only names submitted to
the committee were the officers
of voluntary organizations, as
stipulated in a subpoena. As at
Berkeley and Michigan, these
were furnished only after legal
consultation.
This information was prompt
ly reported by the University
and published in the press this
summer.

• Vote of Confidence
Editor, The Daily:
Mark Kyger's article, "Frosh
Miss Goal," is a complete mis
representation of the way most
freshman women feel. The idea
that we are "more easily turned
on by upperclassmen" than by
members of our own class is one
that the upperclassmen hold, not
the freshman women. To state
that we can be so easily swayed
by age and grade is an insult
to any Stanford "dollie."

We hope the freshman men
will realize that we are not as
impressionable as everyone
seems to think, that we like Wil
bur parties as much as frat par
ties, and that we enjoy fresh
man men as much as sopho
mores, juniors, and seniors. We
conclude that the frosh have
not missed their goal; rather, a
Daily reporter missed his.

• A Clarification
Editor, The Daily:
In reply to yesterday's letter
to the editor from the residents
of Junipero concerning an arti
cle appearing under my name
in the DAILY of October 3rd,
I would like to clarify a few
items which might set their
mind at ease.
First, I certainly would not
like to see the frosh females
abandon freshmen in favor of
upperclassmen, and my article
was not designed for this pur
pose.
Secondly, the letter from Ju
nipero states, "It was intended
to be a refreshing change from
the bandin-one-corner, booze-in
another (with which to get the
girls drunk) Searsville grovel;
it was intended to encourage
originality and personality, and
to be a mixer requiring neither
snow lines nor talk about the
weather." However, the distinct
impression that I got from my

interviews with several Branner
residents was that, although the
party started in this fashion, it
soon became exactly what it
was trying to avoid. Several of
the girls, whose names I have
