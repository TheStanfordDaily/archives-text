# 'OFF' Petition Still Circulates
## 
### 
Four-fifths of the residents of Hos
kins House have signed a petition
asking for the right to live off cam
pus, but their movement has not yet
elicited much response among other
upperelasswomen.
Janet Howell, a senior English ma
jor directing the elfort, said that 100
residents of the high-rise dormitory
now support her attempt to eliminate
one Stanford "double standard" by
giving nonfreshman women the priv
ilege of living off campus if they wish.

Her loosely-structured organization
will submit petitions to LASSU and
the administration Friday. The peti
tion is being circulated in two forms:
one in women's residence halls and in
the Row houses, and one in men's
dormitories and in front of Tresidder
Memorial Union for male students
and teachers.
No Rebellion
Though she does not foresee any
Berkeley-style rebellion arising from
the matter and says that this is "not a
grim issue," Miss Howell did not rule
out the possibility of a demonstration
if the administrators fail to heed the
women's desire for freedom of choice.
"These petitions must be signed,"
Miss Howell said, "because the peti
tions are the only concrete evidence
that this is a legitimate argument."
Miss Howell stressed that these peti
tions do not protest dorm living, they
protest the women students' lack of
choice in the matter of their housing.
Off!
Miss Howell's organization plans to
start distributing "OFF!" buttons
within two weeks. Her group will
sponsor a rally and dance with "Bene
dict Arnold and the Traitors" October
21.
There are several advantages to lib
eralizing the rules, she said. The lib
eralization would make more room in
University residences for men now on
waiting lists, and would give "greater
mobility" to University life.
The reason for the group's move
now is that with the closing of the
Row houses women will have less
choice than they now do about where
to live.
Miss Howell believes that the orga
nization will meet some opposition be
cause the University is making money
by having women live on campus. She
asserts, however, that "there is not
much chance the change in rules won't
happen soon" because of the lack of
logic she find in the present rules,
vey. Then our staff would return to
collect forms at the next three or four
classes," said Kane.

Miss Howell said, "because the peti
tions are the only concrete evidence
that this is a legitimate argument."
Miss Howell stressed that these peti
tions do not protest dorm living, they
protest the women students' lack of
choice in the matter of their housing.
Off!
Miss Howell's organization plans to
start distributing "OFF!" buttons
within two weeks. Her group will
sponsor a rally and dance with "Bene
dict Arnold and the Traitors" October
21.
There are several advantages to lib
eralizing the rules, she said. The lib
eralization would make more room in
University residences for men now on
waiting lists, and would give "greater
mobility" to University life.
The reason for the group's move
now is that with the closing of the
Row houses women will have less
choice than they now do about where
to live.
Miss Howell believes that the orga
nization will meet some opposition be
cause the University is making money
by having women live on campus. She
asserts, however, that "there is not
much chance the change in rules won't
happen soon" because of the lack of
logic she find in the present rules,
vey. Then our staff would return to
collect forms at the next three or four
classes," said Kane.
Four-fifths of the residents of Hos
kins House have signed a petition
asking for the right to live off cam
pus, but their movement has not yet
elicited much response among other
upperelasswomen.
Janet Howell, a senior English ma
jor directing the elfort, said that 100
residents of the high-rise dormitory
now support her attempt to eliminate
one Stanford "double standard" by
giving nonfreshman women the priv
ilege of living off campus if they wish.

Her loosely-structured organization
will submit petitions to LASSU and
the administration Friday. The peti
tion is being circulated in two forms:
one in women's residence halls and in
the Row houses, and one in men's
dormitories and in front of Tresidder
Memorial Union for male students
and teachers.
No Rebellion
Though she does not foresee any
Berkeley-style rebellion arising from
the matter and says that this is "not a
grim issue," Miss Howell did not rule
out the possibility of a demonstration
if the administrators fail to heed the
women's desire for freedom of choice.
"These petitions must be signed,"
Miss Howell said, "because the peti
tions are the only concrete evidence
that this is a legitimate argument."
