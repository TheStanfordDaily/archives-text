# Stanford's Law Society Enters Its Second Year
## 
### MIKE MORTON 
The Stanford Law International So
ciety will continue its program of ser
vice this year to students of the Law
School and to the University commu
nity in general. Under the leadership
of President David A. Gantz, a third
year law student, the Society will ex
plore various phases of international
law, attempting to find answers to the
questions and problems raised by this
study.
In 1962, Stanford law students, mo
tivated by the increasing relevance of
international law to a rapidly shrink
ing world, formed the International
Society. Enthusiastically supported by
faculty members, and especially by
Dean Bayless Manning of the Law
School, the Society took hold and has
now established a permanent place
for itself in the community.
The Society has the dual purpose of
bringing together faculty and students
in a congenial and constructive atmo
sphere and, more specifically, encour
aging the study of international law.
This study entails an initial acquain
tance with the problems at hand and
the provision of a working framework
for deeper research in specialized
fields.
Study And Discussion
As a corollary to their main aim of
study and discussion, the Society also
investigates employment and career
opportunities in international law,
both at home and abroad.
In the pursuit of study in depth, the
Society annually sponsors four main
activities to acquaint and interest both
the student and the general public
with international law.
The first of these activities is a
series of dinner meetings. These meet
ings combine a pleasant social atmo
sphere with a serious discussion of
different topics in international law.
In the past these meetings have fea
tured prominent authorities on inter
national law, such as the Honorable
Leonard C. Meeker, the Legal Adviser
to the Department of State, who ad
dressed the group and lead the discus
sion.
New Topics
Possible topics for this year's series
include the International Court of Jus
tice, the emerging and increasingly
important field of space law, interna
tional business agreements, treaties,
and relations between the United
States and other groups of nations.
The Society also sponsors the Philip
C. Jessup International Law Moot
Court Competition at Stanford. Here
students compete over a hypothetical
problem of current interest. Those
who do well may eventually advance
to tiie national finals of the competi
tion in Washington.
For later in the year, the Society
presents a symposium program for
the edification of any who are in

terested. Past conferences have been
co-sponsored with the Business School
and have presented a broad range of
topics.
Symposium
In 1965, the symposium was con
cerned with Trade, Aid, and Invest
ment in Latin America, and, earlier
this year, the Legal and Financial
Problems of East-West Trade were
discussed.
The next conference, scheduled for
March, 1967, will consider External
Aid to Developing Countries. In turn,
this topic will be broken down into the
four areas of foreign aid, international
monetary reform, commodity agree
ments, and trade preferences.
Lastly, the Society has a somewhat
informal research and writing pro
gram. This consists primarily of en
couragement to students to prepare
publishable articles on international
law. Students are aided in this en
deavor by the Law Review, which re
vises and cite-checks their articles.
MEMBERSHIP
Actual membership in the Society
is confined to students of the Law
School itself. However, nearly all the
Society's activities are open to all
members of the community who are
concerned about international law.
The activities of the Society will
commence for this year on Friday,
October 7, with a dinner-reception. The
speaker will be Dean Bayless Manning
on External Aid to Developing Coun
tries.
Society officers expect a large in
terest in this and other Society proj
ects, for international law has
achieved a tremendous relevance to
today's world, where friendly and rea
sonable international relations are a
necessity.

In 1962, Stanford law students, mo
tivated by the increasing relevance of
international law to a rapidly shrink
ing world, formed the International
Society. Enthusiastically supported by
faculty members, and especially by
Dean Bayless Manning of the Law
School, the Society took hold and has
now established a permanent place
for itself in the community.
The Society has the dual purpose of
bringing together faculty and students
in a congenial and constructive atmo
sphere and, more specifically, encour
aging the study of international law.
This study entails an initial acquain
tance with the problems at hand and
the provision of a working framework
for deeper research in specialized
fields.
Study And Discussion
As a corollary to their main aim of
study and discussion, the Society also
investigates employment and career
opportunities in international law,
both at home and abroad.
In the pursuit of study in depth, the
Society annually sponsors four main
activities to acquaint and interest both
the student and the general public
with international law.
The first of these activities is a
series of dinner meetings. These meet
ings combine a pleasant social atmo
sphere with a serious discussion of
different topics in international law.
In the past these meetings have fea
tured prominent authorities on inter
national law, such as the Honorable
Leonard C. Meeker, the Legal Adviser
to the Department of State, who ad
dressed the group and lead the discus
sion.
New Topics
Possible topics for this year's series
include the International Court of Jus
tice, the emerging and increasingly
important field of space law, interna
tional business agreements, treaties,
and relations between the United
States and other groups of nations.
The Society also sponsors the Philip
C. Jessup International Law Moot
Court Competition at Stanford. Here
students compete over a hypothetical
problem of current interest. Those
who do well may eventually advance
to tiie national finals of the competi
tion in Washington.
For later in the year, the Society
presents a symposium program for
the edification of any who are in

terested. Past conferences have been
co-sponsored with the Business School
and have presented a broad range of
topics.
Symposium
In 1965, the symposium was con
cerned with Trade, Aid, and Invest
ment in Latin America, and, earlier
this year, the Legal and Financial
Problems of East-West Trade were
discussed.
The next conference, scheduled for
March, 1967, will consider External
Aid to Developing Countries. In turn,
this topic will be broken down into the
four areas of foreign aid, international
monetary reform, commodity agree
ments, and trade preferences.
Lastly, the Society has a somewhat
informal research and writing pro
gram. This consists primarily of en
couragement to students to prepare
publishable articles on international
law. Students are aided in this en
deavor by the Law Review, which re
vises and cite-checks their articles.
MEMBERSHIP
Actual membership in the Society
is confined to students of the Law
School itself. However, nearly all the
Society's activities are open to all
members of the community who are
concerned about international law.
The activities of the Society will
commence for this year on Friday,
October 7, with a dinner-reception. The
speaker will be Dean Bayless Manning
on External Aid to Developing Coun
tries.
Society officers expect a large in
terest in this and other Society proj
ects, for international law has
achieved a tremendous relevance to
today's world, where friendly and rea
sonable international relations are a
necessity.
The Stanford Law International So
ciety will continue its program of ser
vice this year to students of the Law
School and to the University commu
nity in general. Under the leadership
of President David A. Gantz, a third
year law student, the Society will ex
plore various phases of international
law, attempting to find answers to the
questions and problems raised by this
study.
