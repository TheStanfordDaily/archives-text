# Greenberg Parodies Stanford Awareness
## 
### JAY BOSWORTH 
Barry Greenberg, Experiment co
ordinator, last night parodied Stan
ford's growing awareness of the out
side world in a "fairy-tale" about the
Inner and the Outer Cities.
Greenberg addressed a crowd of
several hundred as part of The Experi
ment's presentation "Flux: A Smy
posium on the New Student."
Speaking of the "dead fifties,"
Greenberg recalled the primary con
cern of college educators as the "eco
nomic activity of producing and trans
mitting knowledge." In this pre-1960's
era "linear thinking was 'in' while dia
lectic thinking was 'out,' " according
to Greenberg.
Speaking of the new revolution tak
ing place on campuses around the
country, Greenberg said, "It is hard to
tell about it because it is just begin
ning and we are on the inside."
Among the aspects of this rebellion
were, in Greenberg's words "rebellion
against all authority figures and an
attempt to grasp freedom autologi
cally."
Greenberg summed up the new stu
dent attitude with "All we are really
saying is 'hold it . . . where are we
going?' "
Robert Wert, former Dean of Un
dergraduate Education and newly ap
pointed professor of education spoke
about the historical background of the
present organization of American uni
versities. He traced the development
through three centuries of transition
and upheaval.
According to Professor Wert, "Fac

ulties have grasped more authority,
more delegation" since the creation
of higher education in this country.
Wert noted more recently "students
have begun to grasp more power."
"Now the question," posed Wert, "is
how much power shall the students
have and how shall it be used?"
Concerning the Stanford commu
nity, Wert predicted that student par
ticipation here will continue and prove
helpful in making decision in the
future.
Obligations
Dennis Sweeney, former SNCC
worker, criticized the admissions pro
cedure of the University and offered
quotations by prominent Stanford ad
ministrators on the value and results
of war to illustrate his argument that
the administration is not fulfilling its
obligation to the students.
In the question period that followed
Wert cited the decision to end the ban
on liquor, pass-fail grading, and fresh
man seminars as evidence that the
University can work together with
students to achieve many goals.
Greenberg replied that the adminis
tration should be concerned with a
concrete "why" and criticized Profes
sor Wert for dealing with the more
abstract "how."
Tonight at 8 o'clock the second dis
cussion in this "Experiment" series
will take place. The speakers will be
Robert Sears, Dean of Humanities and
Sciences, Victor Lovell of Counseling
and Testing, David Harris, ASSU
President, and Thomas Grissom, assis
ment."
