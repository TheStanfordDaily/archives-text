# COURSE REVIEW
## Editor Outlines Goals 
### SUE DONNELLY 
"We hope to write a critical analy
sis of each department in terms of the
type of education they deliver to stu
dents," Mark Kane, editor of the 1967
Stanford Course Review, told The
Daily yesterday.
The Student Course Review (or
Scratch Sheet), financed by the Stu
dent Academic Affairs Committee, has
appeared every spring quarter since
1962.
"The Course Review could be and
should be one of the effective vehicles
for communication between students,
faculty, and administration . . . more
than a waste of the time of those who
put it together, and a few laughs for
students," noted the introduction to
the 1966 edition.
"But last year's compiling group
was understaffed and disorganized,"
Kane said. "They reviewed courses,
but did not accomplish their aims."
The 1966 Scratch Sheet also en
countered other diffculties. According
to the introduction, "the faculty and
administration, to a great degree,
wanted to have as little to do with
the Course Review as possible, right
down to the Committee on General
Studies disallowing activity credits
for the staff."
Editor Kane endorsed and elaborated
upon the editorial philosophy of last
year's Course Review.

"This year we hope to carry out
much of what Bill Fisher (1966 edi
tor) suggested plus some of our own
ideas," he commented.
"To give unity to the Scratch Sheet
we will set up a standard of what edu
cational goals should be and evaluate
courses in relation to these goals.
"Basically, we think education
should liberate the mind, not imprison
it behind old theories and prejudices.
In effect, it should allow the student
to think for himself," he said.
"It can happen that a student finds

himself bound in by a web of theory
and fact, outside of which is a great
void. A course should suggest avenues
for moving outside or beyond," said
Kane.
Questionnaire
This year's Scratch Sheet will com
bine material from interviews with
professors and questionnaires com
pleted by students.
"We hope to include what the in
structors think they ought to achieve
in class; what they think they actually
do achieve; and, what students think
happens in class," Kane observed.
"We will try to integrate these
statements into our analysis of
courses and departments and account
for the discrepancies between profes
sors' statements and reality."
What's Wronsr
"The purpose of the Course Review
is not just to help students find and
choose courses, but to help the faculty
and administration see what is
wrong," explained Kane.
"This analysis is not just destruc
tive. We hope to dig out facts and to
suggest solutions," he said.
Last year, students returned dis
appointingly few completed Scratch
Sheet questionnaires, according to edi
tor Kane. He hopes to enlist the aid
of instructors to obtain a wider spec
trum of opinion this year.
"We would like to have five min
utes of class time to explain the sur-
Poll-Takers
In previous surveys, poll-takers dis
tributed forms at classroom doors, to
be completed and returned to boxes
around campus.
"To enlist professors' help, we will
offer either to give questionnaires
back to the instructor when we are
finished, or to summarize the con
tents for them.
"The Course Review may also con
sider the stand of athletics in educa
tion, usefulness of a residence uni
versity in regard to education, and,
conflict between in loco parentis and
goals of education," said Kane.
An informal organizational meeting
will be held Thursday at 8 p.m. un
stairs in the Storke Bulding. The staff
needs editorial, administrative and
clerical workers. For further informa
tion contact Mark Kane, Bob Nickel,
or Rick Brown at the Alpha Sig
