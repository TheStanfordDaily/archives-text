29 Selected Short Stories Published
"Twenty Years of Stanford Short Stories" has just been published
by the Stanford University Press.
The 29 stories it contains, in the judgment of the editors, Wallace
Stegner and Richard Scowcroft, "have been selected, not easily,
from 175 stories" written in creative writing classes during the two
decades of Stanford's Creative Writing Center which Prof. Stegner
directs.
"There is not a story among the 29 selected for this volume,"
Prof. Stegner writes in the introduction, "that I could not defend
strongly on artistic grounds, and for every story that made the an
niversary volume, there were at least two fine stories reluctantly
omitted."

the politics of sub-Saharan Africa, invites all students to a lunch
