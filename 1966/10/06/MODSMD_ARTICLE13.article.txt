Stanford's Outer Quadrangle hasn't changed too much since it was first completed. The heavy entrance arch, Memorial Church's
high tower, and the chimney of the Engineering building collapsed during the severe earthquake of 1906, but otherwise the Quad
remains much as it was when Mrs. Stanford finally completed it in 1904.
