# The 						Sun Shone On Stanford
## 
### PAMELA LANG 
A bright October sun streamed
down on the students and fac
ulty assembled at the west end
of Inner Quad for the dedication
of the new Leland Stanford Jun
ior University 75 years ago last
Saturday.
"It is our hope," pronounced
the University's founder, "that
the young women and the young
men who graduate from Palo
Alto shall not only be scholars,
but shall have a sound practical
idea of commonplace everyday
matters, a self-reliance that will
fit them in case of emergency."
Leland Stanford, one of his
era's most versatile men, had
needed "self-reliance" when his
only son died a few weeks be
fore his 16th birthday in 1884.
The California Senator and his
wife decided that a fitting me
morial to their son would be "a
university ... of the highest
grade" designed "to promote the
public welfare by exercising an
influence in behalf of humanity
and civilization, teaching the
blessings of liberty regulated by
law, and inculcating love and
reverence for the great princi
ples of government as derived
from the inalienable rights of
man."
Large Endowment
Their new school opened with
a larger endowment than any in
the country, with higher than
average salaries for its first pro
fessors, but many observers
still were dubious of its chances
for success.
A New York Mall and Express
editorial said that another West
ern university "is about as much
needed as an asylum for decayed
sea captains is needed in Swit
zerland. The professors for
years will lecture in marble halls
to empty benches."
"Our colleagues in Berkeley
were most cordial," wrote David
Starr Jordan, the University's
first president, "but they took
the same gloomy view of the
outlook."
But the 165 new students, many
of them already living in the
still-unfinished dormitories, En
cina and Roble Halls, were en
thusiastic. They quickly adopted
the motto "Die Lnft der Fleiheit
weht," which was quoted in
some early address, and threw
themselves into campus activi
ties.
"Fifth Ave. Hotel"
"Clean and varnishy Encina,
described in one boy's letters
home as "real Fifth Avenue
Hotel style," supplied red blank
ets monogrammed with "LSJU"
and full board for only $20 a
month. "The food is good and

plentiful," wrote another early
student, "although so far our
desserts have defied analysis."
The 72 residents in the orig
inal Roble Hall (since converted
to today's Sequoia Hall) had to
eat in Encina's dining room—
by themselves—until their's was
finished.
Boys would stand on chairs
outside the dining room win
dows so as to watch them eat
—a process they referred to as
"seeing the hens fed."
As the girls came out, walking
two by two in their long dresses,
the boys were still there, wait
ing to see how they would nego
tiate the step in front of the
door. "It is hard not to catch
your heel or something with all
those horrid eyes on one," com
plained a female letter-writer.
Invitation Declined
Toward the end of October,
the boys asked the girls to a re-

ception, with dancing to follow.
The girls decided that this would
be improper, and the boys with
drew their invitation.
But by February one girl was
able to say, "We have no rules
of action whatever, and we may
do just as we please, restricted
only by criticism and the sure
fact that if we overstepped the
bounds of propriety too far we
should have to go."
And Charles Kellogg Field of
the class of '95 wrote:

Dear Maid of mine, do you
recall
When first my heart you won,
There were no lights in Roble
Hall,
But, oh, such loads of fun?
The days of dark, the days of
spark,
The days of '91. . . .
Fraternities
Zeta Psi, Stanford's first fra
ternity, received its charter 75
years ago yesterday, and Phi
Delta Theta followed on October
22. Phi Kappa Sigma, Sigma Nu
(Beta Chi), Phi Gamma Delta,
Alpha Tau Omega, Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, and two sororities were
formerly organized on campus
during the first year.
But the students' spiritual and
intellectual lives were not ne
glected. Church services were
conducted on campus from the
first week of school, and classes
followed almost a normal pat
tern beginning on the second
day of the semester —although
four of the entering students
had registered in departments
which were as yet unstaffed.
Fully a third of the new stu
dents were from out of state.
The wind of freedom had drawn
them for many reasons. James
Freeman Jenness, '92, whose old
er brother received the very first
Stanford diploma, visited the
campus in July, 1981, and later
wrote, "We were greatly im
pressed by what we saw that
day—grounds, buildings, nature,
and the brain and hand of man
conspiring to create the marvel
lous institution which Stanford
University has come to be."
Those first students welcomed
the brave spirit of the pioneer
institution. As Jordan said in a
founder's day address in 1915,
"It was Mr. Stanford's hope to
leave the University free to
grow through the coming ages.
He would extend no dead hand
from the grave to limit its ac
tivities or control its move
ments."
