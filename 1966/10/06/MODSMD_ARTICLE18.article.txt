## Best Of The New Wave 
### Steven Lavine 
This column will be devoted
to anything concerning the cine
ma. It will contain comments on
local films, on-campus films,
films on TV, student film mak
ing, just miscellaneous films,
and occasionally a review of a
book on films. Contributions by
readers on any of these topics
or essays on anything relating
to films (from aesthetics to
Shirley Temple) will be wel
comed.
Morgan, A Suitable Case for
Treatment is playing now at the
Fine Arts in Palo Alto. Though
it fails in many ways, Morgan
is perhaps the best film to be
produced by the English new
wave since Lester's A Hard
Day's Night.
The tendency since Day's
Night has been to rejoice in
technical style or simply to ex
ploit an actor's presence on the
screen (which in the case of the
Beatles is a pleasure but in the
case of Julie Christie- Dariing-a
bore). With Morgan, several
steps forward have been taken.
Deceptively Simple
The plot of the film is decep
tively simple. Morgan (David
Warner) attempts to win back
the wife, Leonie (Vanessa Red
grave), who has just divorced
him. As his inventive and fran
tic efforts fail, he lapses in
creasingly into his own personal
fantasy world inhabited by
gorillas and other sundry jungle
beasts.
In the form of a gorilla, Mor
gan finds an ideal, a creature
who is king of his world and
lives in peace and freedom, a
creature who is effective.
At the beginning of the film
Morgan is sane; thus he chooses
to mimic the gorilla in the open
ing zoo scene. As the film pro
gresses, he becomes increasing
ly incapable of discerning be
tween fantasy and reality. Fi
nally, Morgan notes that he has
become furry while he is, in
fact, only wearing a gorilla
costume.
Harmless Lunatic
The visionary ends as a harm
less lunatic. The film suggests
that the alternative is Trotsky's
end, an ice pick in the head.
The Marxist material in the
film is largely ineffective. While
his mother is old enough to
have been indoctrinated with
Marxist views, Morgan is just
too young. He is not of the gen
eration that suffered with a
Marxist intellectual heritage
that could no longer help it cope
with the world.
Somewhere between Morgan
and his mother lies another
generation and as one critic has
pointed out, that is perhaps the
generation of the director. The
ultimate effect of the Marxist
material is to add a non-con
formist-for-its-own-sake element
to Morgan's character and this
weakens Morgan's impact as a
serious character.
Problem of Pain
Morgan deals with pain in a
way rarely seen in modern films
. . . free from cliches, :n-jokes,
and slick professionalism. There
is no more poweiful scene in
modern cinema than the shot of

MorganVs teary eyes through
the insane, circular eye-holes of
the gorilla mask.
When Morgan lies in the
trash heap trying desparately
to take off the gorilla mask, to
regain his sanity and freedom,
one is reminded of Luzhin's sui
cide in Nabokov's The Defense.
As he tries to jump from the
window he becomes trapped by
his own dumpy body. Both are
trapped by themselves for as
Luzhin finds only another chess
board in the pattern of the
street lights so Morgan lapses
into another fantasy.
Challenging
Despite certain blunders (like
the insistance on laughs where
none are called for) Morgan is
finely wrought, intellectually
challenging, and entirely worth
an evening at the theatre. Oth
er films of interest:
Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961)
starring Audrey Hepburn,
George Peppard, and Patricia
Neal will be on channel 5 at 9:00
tonight. If you like Miss Hep
burn you will love this film. Va
cant but vibrant, it is excellent
entertainment.
Winter Light (Bergman, 1962)
is the TMU film this Friday. It
is the story of one day in the
life of a village pastor who has
lost his faith. It is a good film
but not among Bergman's best.
Little Chickadee
Saturday My Little Chickadee
(1940) will be on channel 5 at
2:30 p.m. It is W. C. Fields' last
great film. His confrontation
with Mae West in this film is
one of the bright spots in Amer
ican film history.
High Sierra is this Saturday's
TMU film. The only comment
necessary is "Bogart!"
