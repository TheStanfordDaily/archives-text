# Student In Clash Wins

### 
MISSISSIPPI (CPS)â€”Millions
of university-issued parking
tickets across the country may
now be worthless. In a prece
dent-setting case, the prosecu
tion of a Mississippi State Uni
versity student for refusing to
pay his campus tickets has been
dismissed.
Leslie C. Cohen, a Canadian
political science student at MSU,
balked when the academic insti
tution imposed $20 in parking
fines without a hearing.
When the University threat
ened him with dismissal and
state court action unless fines
were paid, Cohen went to the
Lawyers Constitutional Defense
Committee of the American Civ
il Liberties Union.
Restraining Order
The LCDC secured a restrain
ing order to prevent MSU offi.
cials from impeding Cohen's ef
forts to gain admission to a
Canadian law school. Cohen
feared that the University would
delay sending his records, would
note the parking violations on
his record or would not allow
him to take a necessary summer
session course at Mississippi
State.
The LCDC subsequently chal
lenged the constitutionality of
the Mississippi statute un d e r
which the University justified
its regulations. The statute
granted to the State Board of
Institutions of Higher Learning
the power to create regulations
which are municipal in effect,
the LCDC charged.
Null and Void
While the case was before the
U.S. District Court, the State
Attorney General, representing
the University, conceded that
the regulations which were
promulgated by MSU and their
manner of enforcement were
null and void.
The University dropped its
charges against Cohen and the
Mississippi statute came under
the consideration of a three
judge federal court.
Although the law was even
tually ruled constitutional,
LCDC chief counsel Alvin Bron
stein said that this does not af
fect the due process precedenr
that had been raised over the
tickets themselves.
Bronstein said he has already
received requests for partiou
lars on the case from legal de
partments of several universi
ties.
