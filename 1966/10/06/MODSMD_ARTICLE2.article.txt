# Novak: Unity Of Belief, Unbelief
## 
### LONNIE TERRY 
Professor Michael Novak of Reli
gious Studios last night analyzed the
problems of "Belief and Unbelief" be
fore an audience of several hundred
persons gathered in Memorial Church.
The meeting, originally scheduled
for Tresidder Union, was moved to
the church when an overflow crowd
appeared .
Novak, addressing the group, ex
plained the historical background for
a world in which it is increasingly
difficult to recognize the difference be
tween the believer who is seriously
analyzing his beliefs and the non-be
liever who understands the funda
mental consequences of his unbelief.
An Evaluation
"It will help us to clarify exactly
what is going on among the young
people in this country during the last
few years" Novak emphasized. He ex
plained the conflict between belief and
unbelief arises from an evaluation,
since the two world wars, of the be
liefs, doubts, and traditions by which
one lives.
Novak considers that American re
ligion of the past has been basically
a "folk religion." He feels that Ameri
can religion has its strength in the
family and in local and national tra
ditions.
In this search for a meaningful
life, believer and non-believer alike
have found meaning from helping the
poor and helpless. He exemplified his
point by illustrating the recent inter
est in the poverty and civil rights pro
grams.
Principal Vision
Novak believes that the non-be
liever, who analyzes his participation
in such programs, will come to realize
that three points stand out:
First, he will have a principal of
vision. This is the belief that "a more
intelligent society could and should be
built and that it is worth paying a
price for."
Second, he will develop a principle
of resignation. He will recognize that
there is no such thing as a total vic
tory and that progress is inevitably
slow.

Finally, the non-believer will de
velop a principal of compassion. He
will come to really care about the suf
fering and pain he sees about him.
Similar Ideals
Novak then explained that it is dif
ficult for the young unbeliever to dis
tinguish himself from the believer
who had recognized that he could not
"see, feel, taste, or perceive God."
Such a believer, Novak stated, would
hold the nearly similar ideals of faith,
hope, and charity.
"What happens is that both the sin
cere believer and the non-believer
find themselves doing the same things
—they simply interpret the facts dif
ferently."
The non-believer takes his ideals of
vision, resignation, and compassion as
simple facts. He simply says that
"there is nothing else than this, noth
ing else he can do."
The believer, on the other hand, sees
this as a re-statement of his tenants.
It proves to him that human life is
an indication of God.
Novak said that "It is much more
important that we should do these
things than that we should interpret
them in the same way."
New Civilization
The re-evaluation of beliefs during
the past few years marks the develop
ment o fa "new form of civilization."
Three points were made about this
civilization.
First, it is more international be
cause of greatly increased speed of
communications.
Second, it is more technical. "The
lives of men change rapidly under the
pressure of technical advances so that
man comes under pressure and thinks
in subtly different ways."
Finally, it will be more secular.
There are many areas which in the
past were supported by the church
that no longer demand such support,
tin-intellectual America
Novak explained that it is an Amer
ican trait to "cover up or avoid"
troublesome questions about faith. He
stated that "religion in America, by
and large, is un-intellectual."
"There are relatively few theolo
gians," said Novak. "When people find

out what these theologians are doing
they are usually shocked and think
that what they are doing is heretical."
Novak emphasized that the weak
point of American religion is that "We
would like to shut these things up and
keep them away."
He explained that, in American so
ciety, those who ask questions are in
danger of having the things they in
quire about deemed unimportant by a
public that will not face the issues.
He emphasized that the mobility,
change in traditions, and changes in
American education have made the
"folk-religion" untenable in America
today.

liever, who analyzes his participation
in such programs, will come to realize
that three points stand out:
First, he will have a principal of
vision. This is the belief that "a more
intelligent society could and should be
built and that it is worth paying a
price for."
Second, he will develop a principle
of resignation. He will recognize that
there is no such thing as a total vic
tory and that progress is inevitably
slow.

Finally, the non-believer will de
velop a principal of compassion. He
will come to really care about the suf
fering and pain he sees about him.
Similar Ideals
Novak then explained that it is dif
ficult for the young unbeliever to dis
tinguish himself from the believer
who had recognized that he could not
"see, feel, taste, or perceive God."
Such a believer, Novak stated, would
hold the nearly similar ideals of faith,
hope, and charity.
"What happens is that both the sin
cere believer and the non-believer
find themselves doing the same things
—they simply interpret the facts dif
ferently."
The non-believer takes his ideals of
vision, resignation, and compassion as
simple facts. He simply says that
"there is nothing else than this, noth
ing else he can do."
The believer, on the other hand, sees
this as a re-statement of his tenants.
It proves to him that human life is
an indication of God.
Novak said that "It is much more
important that we should do these
things than that we should interpret
them in the same way."
New Civilization
The re-evaluation of beliefs during
the past few years marks the develop
ment o fa "new form of civilization."
Three points were made about this
civilization.
First, it is more international be
cause of greatly increased speed of
communications.
Second, it is more technical. "The
lives of men change rapidly under the
pressure of technical advances so that
man comes under pressure and thinks
in subtly different ways."
Finally, it will be more secular.
There are many areas which in the
past were supported by the church
that no longer demand such support,
tin-intellectual America
Novak explained that it is an Amer
ican trait to "cover up or avoid"
troublesome questions about faith. He
stated that "religion in America, by
and large, is un-intellectual."
"There are relatively few theolo
gians," said Novak. "When people find

out what these theologians are doing
they are usually shocked and think
that what they are doing is heretical."
Novak emphasized that the weak
point of American religion is that "We
would like to shut these things up and
keep them away."
He explained that, in American so
ciety, those who ask questions are in
danger of having the things they in
quire about deemed unimportant by a
public that will not face the issues.
He emphasized that the mobility,
change in traditions, and changes in
American education have made the
"folk-religion" untenable in America
today.
Professor Michael Novak of Reli
gious Studios last night analyzed the
problems of "Belief and Unbelief" be
fore an audience of several hundred
persons gathered in Memorial Church.
The meeting, originally scheduled
for Tresidder Union, was moved to
the church when an overflow crowd
appeared .
Novak, addressing the group, ex
plained the historical background for
a world in which it is increasingly
difficult to recognize the difference be
tween the believer who is seriously
analyzing his beliefs and the non-be
liever who understands the funda
mental consequences of his unbelief.
An Evaluation
"It will help us to clarify exactly
what is going on among the young
people in this country during the last
few years" Novak emphasized. He ex
plained the conflict between belief and
unbelief arises from an evaluation,
since the two world wars, of the be
liefs, doubts, and traditions by which
one lives.
Novak considers that American re
ligion of the past has been basically
a "folk religion." He feels that Ameri
can religion has its strength in the
family and in local and national tra
ditions.
In this search for a meaningful
life, believer and non-believer alike
have found meaning from helping the
poor and helpless. He exemplified his
point by illustrating the recent inter
est in the poverty and civil rights pro
grams.

an indication of God.
Novak said that "It is much more
important that we should do these
things than that we should interpret
them in the same way."
New Civilization
The re-evaluation of beliefs during
the past few years marks the develop
ment o fa "new form of civilization."
Three points were made about this
civilization.
First, it is more international be
cause of greatly increased speed of
communications.
Second, it is more technical. "The
lives of men change rapidly under the
pressure of technical advances so that
man comes under pressure and thinks
in subtly different ways."
Finally, it will be more secular.
There are many areas which in the
past were supported by the church
that no longer demand such support,
tin-intellectual America
Novak explained that it is an Amer
ican trait to "cover up or avoid"
troublesome questions about faith. He
stated that "religion in America, by
and large, is un-intellectual."
"There are relatively few theolo
gians," said Novak. "When people find

out what these theologians are doing
they are usually shocked and think
that what they are doing is heretical."
Novak emphasized that the weak
point of American religion is that "We
would like to shut these things up and
keep them away."
He explained that, in American so
ciety, those who ask questions are in
danger of having the things they in
quire about deemed unimportant by a
public that will not face the issues.
He emphasized that the mobility,
change in traditions, and changes in
American education have made the
"folk-religion" untenable in America
today.
Professor Michael Novak of Reli
gious Studios last night analyzed the
problems of "Belief and Unbelief" be
fore an audience of several hundred
persons gathered in Memorial Church.
The meeting, originally scheduled
for Tresidder Union, was moved to
the church when an overflow crowd
appeared .
Novak, addressing the group, ex
plained the historical background for
a world in which it is increasingly
difficult to recognize the difference be
tween the believer who is seriously
analyzing his beliefs and the non-be
liever who understands the funda
mental consequences of his unbelief.
An Evaluation
"It will help us to clarify exactly
what is going on among the young
people in this country during the last
few years" Novak emphasized. He ex
plained the conflict between belief and
unbelief arises from an evaluation,
since the two world wars, of the be
liefs, doubts, and traditions by which
one lives.
Novak considers that American re
ligion of the past has been basically
a "folk religion." He feels that Ameri
can religion has its strength in the
family and in local and national tra
ditions.
In this search for a meaningful
life, believer and non-believer alike
have found meaning from helping the
poor and helpless. He exemplified his
point by illustrating the recent inter
est in the poverty and civil rights pro
grams.
Principal Vision
Novak believes that the non-be
liever, who analyzes his participation
in such programs, will come to realize
that three points stand out:
First, he will have a principal of
vision. This is the belief that "a more
intelligent society could and should be
built and that it is worth paying a
price for."
Second, he will develop a principle
of resignation. He will recognize that
there is no such thing as a total vic
tory and that progress is inevitably
slow.

Finally, the non-believer will de
velop a principal of compassion. He
will come to really care about the suf
fering and pain he sees about him.
Similar Ideals
Novak then explained that it is dif
ficult for the young unbeliever to dis
tinguish himself from the believer
who had recognized that he could not
"see, feel, taste, or perceive God."
Such a believer, Novak stated, would
hold the nearly similar ideals of faith,
hope, and charity.
"What happens is that both the sin
cere believer and the non-believer
find themselves doing the same things
—they simply interpret the facts dif
ferently."
The non-believer takes his ideals of
vision, resignation, and compassion as
simple facts. He simply says that
"there is nothing else than this, noth
ing else he can do."
The believer, on the other hand, sees
this as a re-statement of his tenants.
It proves to him that human life is
an indication of God.
Novak said that "It is much more
important that we should do these
things than that we should interpret
them in the same way."
