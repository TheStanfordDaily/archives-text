# CARDS SEEK THIRD WIN
## Poloists Take On San Jose 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Stanford's varsity poloists
take on San Jose State at 3:30
this afternoon in the Encina
Pool. The Indians seek their
third win in the young 1966 sea
son.
Coach Jimmie Smith's fresh
man squad opens its schedule
against the San Jose frosh im
mediately following the varsity
game.
San Jose should give the var
sity a real sprint for its money,
especially in light of the injuries
that have sidelined first string
Indians John Parker and Gary
Sheerer.
San Jose has consistently
fielded strong teams character
ized by two or three outstanding

players and a deep bench. San
Jose's deep reserves have en
abled the Spartans to accrue ab
normally large numbers of per
sonal fouls without changing
significantly the caliber of the
personnel in the pool.
Costly Victory
Last season, Stanford won a
close (5-4) game at San Jose.
The victory proved a costly one
to the Tribe, as Ail-American
Gary Sheerer suffered a broken
wrist. Sheerer was lost for Stan
ford's crucial games with first
place UCLA and contending
Foothill.
The return match at Stanford
3 weeks later was a different
story on the scoreboard, as the
Tribe routed the Spartans, 11-2.

In the pool, however, the game
had not changed. San Jose lost
10 men to the four-foul limit.
After firing two goals, leading
Stanford scorer Pete Ready left
the game, his eye cut by a way
ward fingernail.
Short Change
San Jose got no relief, how
ever. Ready's substitute entered
the pool wearing a bandage on
his left hand. Gary Sheerer, hav
ing recovered from his three
week lay-off, scored three quick
goals, maintaining throughout
an irrepressible "Crime Doesn't
Pay" grin.
San Jose has the same deep
bench as in previous years, but
the Spartans have more class
among their frontline men.

Jack Likens and Foothill trans
fer Greg Hind will be continual
threats in the field. Bob Likens
is probably the best goalie in
Northern California.
Friday at 3:30, the Cards
meet Cal here. The Bears will
be as tough an opponent as the
Indians could hope to face. Cal
boasts a front line with four
veterans from the Foothill Aqua
tic Club, national AAU cham
pions.
Stanford's superior depth will
have to be the telling factor. The
question is whether it will be
superior enough after losing
Sheerer and Parker.
Saturday morning, the Cards
play Long Beach City College,
here, at 11:00.

Stanford's superior depth will
have to be the telling factor. The
question is whether it will be
superior enough after losing
Sheerer and Parker.
Saturday morning, the Cards
play Long Beach City College,
here, at 11:00.
Stanford's varsity poloists
take on San Jose State at 3:30
this afternoon in the Encina
Pool. The Indians seek their
third win in the young 1966 sea
son.
Coach Jimmie Smith's fresh
man squad opens its schedule
against the San Jose frosh im
mediately following the varsity
game.
San Jose should give the var
sity a real sprint for its money,
especially in light of the injuries
that have sidelined first string
Indians John Parker and Gary
Sheerer.
San Jose has consistently
fielded strong teams character
ized by two or three outstanding

players and a deep bench. San
Jose's deep reserves have en
abled the Spartans to accrue ab
normally large numbers of per
sonal fouls without changing
significantly the caliber of the
personnel in the pool.
Costly Victory
Last season, Stanford won a
close (5-4) game at San Jose.
The victory proved a costly one
to the Tribe, as Ail-American
Gary Sheerer suffered a broken
wrist. Sheerer was lost for Stan
ford's crucial games with first
place UCLA and contending
Foothill.
The return match at Stanford
3 weeks later was a different
story on the scoreboard, as the
Tribe routed the Spartans, 11-2.

In the pool, however, the game
had not changed. San Jose lost
10 men to the four-foul limit.
After firing two goals, leading
Stanford scorer Pete Ready left
the game, his eye cut by a way
ward fingernail.
Short Change
San Jose got no relief, how
ever. Ready's substitute entered
the pool wearing a bandage on
his left hand. Gary Sheerer, hav
ing recovered from his three
week lay-off, scored three quick
goals, maintaining throughout
an irrepressible "Crime Doesn't
Pay" grin.
San Jose has the same deep
bench as in previous years, but
the Spartans have more class
among their frontline men.

Jack Likens and Foothill trans
fer Greg Hind will be continual
threats in the field. Bob Likens
is probably the best goalie in
Northern California.
Friday at 3:30, the Cards
meet Cal here. The Bears will
be as tough an opponent as the
Indians could hope to face. Cal
boasts a front line with four
veterans from the Foothill Aqua
tic Club, national AAU cham
pions.
Stanford's superior depth will
have to be the telling factor. The
question is whether it will be
superior enough after losing
