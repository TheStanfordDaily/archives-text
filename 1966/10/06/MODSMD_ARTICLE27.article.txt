## AS-SUCH Menu Lists Dewey Decimal Coffee 
### Bob Fishman 
Proposing to put an "inti
mate" coffee house in the West
ern Civ Library is a little like
proposing to hold a seminar in
the Cow Palace.
Nonetheless, the coffee house
might provide a unique experi-
but only if the present li
brarians and procedures are re
tained.
Imagine, if you will, a student
despartely in need of nourish
ment wandering into the new
coffee house.
After waiting ten minutes to
attract the librarian's attention,
he announces, "I'd like a cup of
coffee and a roll."
"I'm sorry," she replies, "you'll
have to fill out a card first."
She directs him to a card cata
log where he attempts to look
up the Dewey decimal numbers
of coffee and a roll. His task is
complicated by the fact that
thirty other hunger-crazed peo
ple are looking for the same
card.
Maiden Name
He discovers from the catalog
that coffee is on two hour re
serve and that rolls may be bor
rowed for one week only.
After putting down on the
card his great-aunt's place of
birth, his second cousin's maid
en name and other relevant in
formation, he is now ready to
stand in line for another ten
minutes.
With a smirk of triumph, he
finally presents the card to the
librarian.
"I'm sorry," she says, "our
coffee and rolls are all out now.
Would you like to take a num
ber and wait?"
Reduced by hunger to docility,
our student meekly argues.
He then goes into the main
room. Of course, every chair is
taken. One room — where the
windows are closed — is stifling
ly hot. Ileat flows mysteriously
from the floors.
Ice Coating:
The other room — where the
windows are open — has a thin
layer of ice coating the floors,
tables, n?d chairs. The ice makes
walking hazardous and sitting
down dangerous.
While waiting for his food,
our student can amuse himself
by contemplating the other peo
ple in the room. Most are sleep
ing.
Those not sleeping would like

to, but find the chairs too hard.
A few people are surrounded
by impressive piles of books.
Books shut out the light and
make sleeping easier.
Meanwhile, our student has
been waiting so long that he has
begun to eye the leather bind
ings on books with something
like relish. He finally sees his
number — 1,867 — flash on the
screen.
Grab For Food
He runs to the main desk,
only to wait in line for another
ten minutes.
Finally, the librarian brings
him his coffee and roll. He grabs

for the food, but the librarian
hastily retracts it.
"Just a moment, sir," she
says. "I'll have to see your stu
dent body card first."
Our student reaches down to
his pocket. Suddenly his hand
freezes. With a moan of pure
horror seldom encountered out
side Edgar Allan Poe short
stories, he blurts out, "I forgot
it."
"I'm awfully sorry," the li
brarian says calmly. "But you
must remember that using the
Western Civ coffeehouse is a
privilege that's only open to
Stanford students."
