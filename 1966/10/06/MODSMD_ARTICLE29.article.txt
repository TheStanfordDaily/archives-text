# The 						Levin Spoonful
## A 						Few Paused To Notice The Passing Of A Friend 
### Barbara Levin 
There was a death on White
Plaza this week. A special friend
of many was—all of a sudden—
gone.
During the tragedy people
rushed by the scene on their
own hurried ways.
Crowds were unknowing or
uncaring; a few blinked—a
blink to express surprise, to
hide the horrible sight, perhaps
to hold back a tear. The demise
was slow and tortuous, and this
increased the pain for those
who were friends. "Mercy,"
they inwardly exclaimed, "mer
cy or speed." They wished for
a sudden transformation from
the original beauty to . . .
Bloom Of Memories
The peace of Old Union was
violated to convert the site into
the new Dean's office. It re
mains only as the fabric of love
ly remembrances. The bloom of
some memories is fresh and un
touched, unlike the setting. A
few mornings ago, as the tiny
plaza awoke in the warm, foggy
sun, a black mother cat and
four smaller balls of fur lay in
the grass. The mother had cap
tured one kitten between her
paws and was performing her
early morning chores. Her tiny
pink tongue pensistently ca
ressed the head of the squirm
ing offspring. Meanwhile t.he
other three rolled and wrestled
and chased the rainbow drops
from the central fountain.
Yesterday, another cat
crouched in the same area. A

yellow tractor hid where the
grass had been, waiting for the
start of the new day. The gray
light could not hide the effects
its lashing tongue had made the
day before; a layer of dust cov
ered the quiet, mourning foun
tain. Its active yester-year, its
recent quiet, and its possibility
for a bright future were lost in
the dismal present.
A Quite Pool
Last week the fountain sat in
the quiet of the "inner" Inner
City. The square was a quiet
pool, safe from the onrush of
the nearby flood. Its trees shel
tered a moment of introspec
tion, but did not completely
block out the bustle of the
"real" world. The shade, the
play of sunlight, the simpering
sounds of water: background
for a moment filled with every
thing ... or nothing.
Next week the limelight of
"official" business will focus
here, and no dimness nor shade
should cover the important mat
ters handled. The sounds will
be numerous and constant —
tinkering typewriters, clanking
heels, loud voices. New life will
come. A resurrection to earlier
greatness, perhaps. But the
peace of the plaza is the irre
coverable price for this glory,
one quality lost in its most re
cent transformation.
People will still pass along in
the flood. Most will never notice
the change, but a few friends—
a few who blinked—will find
"forgive-and-forget" hard.

Bloom Of Memories
The peace of Old Union was
violated to convert the site into
the new Dean's office. It re
mains only as the fabric of love
ly remembrances. The bloom of
some memories is fresh and un
touched, unlike the setting. A
few mornings ago, as the tiny
plaza awoke in the warm, foggy
sun, a black mother cat and
four smaller balls of fur lay in
the grass. The mother had cap
tured one kitten between her
paws and was performing her
early morning chores. Her tiny
pink tongue pensistently ca
ressed the head of the squirm
ing offspring. Meanwhile t.he
other three rolled and wrestled
and chased the rainbow drops
from the central fountain.
Yesterday, another cat
crouched in the same area. A

yellow tractor hid where the
grass had been, waiting for the
start of the new day. The gray
light could not hide the effects
its lashing tongue had made the
day before; a layer of dust cov
ered the quiet, mourning foun
tain. Its active yester-year, its
recent quiet, and its possibility
for a bright future were lost in
the dismal present.
A Quite Pool
Last week the fountain sat in
the quiet of the "inner" Inner
City. The square was a quiet
pool, safe from the onrush of
the nearby flood. Its trees shel
tered a moment of introspec
tion, but did not completely
block out the bustle of the
"real" world. The shade, the
play of sunlight, the simpering
sounds of water: background
for a moment filled with every
thing ... or nothing.
Next week the limelight of
"official" business will focus
here, and no dimness nor shade
should cover the important mat
ters handled. The sounds will
be numerous and constant —
tinkering typewriters, clanking
heels, loud voices. New life will
come. A resurrection to earlier
greatness, perhaps. But the
peace of the plaza is the irre
coverable price for this glory,
one quality lost in its most re
cent transformation.
People will still pass along in
the flood. Most will never notice
the change, but a few friends—
a few who blinked—will find
"forgive-and-forget" hard.
There was a death on White
Plaza this week. A special friend
of many was—all of a sudden—
gone.
During the tragedy people
rushed by the scene on their
own hurried ways.
Crowds were unknowing or
uncaring; a few blinked—a
blink to express surprise, to
hide the horrible sight, perhaps
to hold back a tear. The demise
was slow and tortuous, and this
increased the pain for those
who were friends. "Mercy,"
they inwardly exclaimed, "mer
cy or speed." They wished for
a sudden transformation from
the original beauty to . . .
