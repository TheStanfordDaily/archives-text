## HUAC Subpoena Causes Uproar 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
—Just wish Anatole Anton
would explain how HUAC's sub
poenas violated academic free
dom or just what he's got to
hide anyway. Could it be a ques
tion of civil responsibility?
That's just a rhetorical ques
tion, Mr. Anton.

• For Clarity
Editor, The Dally:
In the interest of clarity, I
want to reply immediately and
in detail to The Daily's account
of the membership list issue.
1) I don't now doubt Dean
Smith's claim that the lists
were in fact subpoenaed on July
26. However, there are good rea
sons to doubt the rest of what
he says. A member of the Medi
cal Aid Committee went to
Washington early in June for
an interview. He was urged by
the government interviewers,
"to talk" about a list of names
which coincided with "the char
ter lists" (I hope this phase is
unambigous) of several
groups. The point I want to
stress, is that it doesn't matter
whether HUAC got any infor
mation voluntarily, if organiza
tions like the FBI and the CIA
did get such lists. Or did they
subpoena the lists? We have a
right to be informed of these
things.
Furthermore, unlike the sub
poenaed witnesses from other
schools, we were not informed
that the lists had been sub
poenaed, this would have been
useful to know in preparing our
legad defense.
2) I was misrepresented in
your story in two ways. Your
staff writer said that I claimed
that the Dean's Office had given
HUAC "the complete list of the
four groups." Reading my letter
carefully would have made it
clear that I claimed that we
only knew that one "organiza
tion list," the YSA list, had been
given to HUAC. Also, it may be
that "organization lists" was a
poorly chosen phrase. It is un
derstandable that your reporter
interpreted that to mean "com
plete membership list." The is
sue remains exactly what it
was. Namely, the names of some
people which would not other
wise be public were given to
The Committee.
Secondly, it is just not true,
as your story asserts, that I
"never went to Washington to
testify." I was subpoenaed. I

traveled to Washington. I re
tained a lawyer. And I had
every reason to expect that I
would be asked to testify. The
fact that The Committee de
cided not to swear me in could
not have been predicted.
3) The central issue is aca
demic freedom. In order to pro
tect whatever freedom we have
at Stanford, I want to repeat
my proposal that all "charter
lists" be put under the authori
ty of the student body presi
dent. The legal decision about
whether or not to surrender
these lists could then be his and
that of the students he repre
sents. There are excellent legal
grounds as it is for refusing to
honor a HUAC subpoena.
But again, the main point is
that the administration has
demonstrated its reluctance to
fight for academic freedom.
Since even the administration
concedes that academic freedom
is important, why don't they
give authority over the lists to
tht students and let us fight
against HUAC's (and other) in
vasions of our freedom?

• Riot Tension
Editor, The Daily;
On Thursday evening Chan
nel 9 showed a film of a Negro
newsman talking to a man in
Hunter' 6 Point, who said, as
nearly as I can remember,
"Death; death. It'll all be over
in a little while now. We've got
nothing to live for. It's them or
us. They've got the guns —
that's all." Then he rain out of
the picture.
When there are men in such
a state of despair, when there
are men who are willing to die
just for the privilege of shout
ing one or two obscenities at
some cops, we do not need
stories about the little discom
forts of Kirk Hanen as he gawks
at people's misery. They are not
animals in a zoo, Mr. Hanen,
which may have something to
do with their not wanting to
smile and make funny faces for
your precious camera. The priest
you speak of had probably just
undergone the greatest mental
and physical strain of his life
trying to control the fury of his
friends and parishioners. To ac
cuse him of forgetting his non
violent creed shows either an al
most inconceivable lack of ima
gination or else an almost nau
seating degree of self-centered
ness.
