# 'Poppycock' To Expect Total Education From University
## 
### WILL HOBBS 
Robert Sears, Dean of Humanities
and Sciences, told his Experiment
audience last night that "to consider
that you get all the education there is
in a university is poppycock . . . non
sense."
He stressed that "a university is a
place of limited resources—useful for
some people for some purposes."
Speaking before an audience of sev
eral hundred at the second session
of "Flux: A Symposium on the New
Student," Dean Sears disclaimed the
notion of the university as a place to
work out one's feelings on authority.
He characterized himself as "sym
pathetic with Dave Harris' position

on education." Sears outlined his con
cept of a university's functions,
which, he noted, legitimately include
. . securing information for its own
sake, learning things for purely in
strumental reasons, and learning for
self-fulfillment."
Trial and Error
Sears stressed authority in a uni
versity as essential: "If you want to
learn by direct experience, without
authority ... go to the Library of
Congress; if you want to learn by
trial and error, go to Mississippi."
Thomas Grissom, a graduate stu
dent in philosophy and education, told
a story called "The Emperor's Uni
versity and Its Clothes," a story
which he prefaced as containing "too

much truth to be a fairy tale." The
tale was of a "super university," a
place with no classes (students didn't
like them) and no teachers (they did
n't like to teach), where "students
learned how to dress sharply, and
drink with moderation."
The Emperor's university was
clothed in " . . . smiles, suntans, sport
cars, sparkling faces—happiness."
Win or Droupout
Grissom stated that "People are
produced on the basis of other peo
ple's desires," that university stu
dents are preparing for roles stamped
out for them. He believed a strict sys
tem based on "aggression and role
playing" forces students to " . . . fight
it out and win, or become dropouts."

Grissom complained of "leaders,
like Joel Smith, who talk about stu
dents they don't even know." These
leaders "encourage the split between
what we think and what we do"; as a
result, "The Fundamental Standard
becomes a sham when applied to ad
ministrators."
Grissom sees The Experiment's aim
as "an attempt at selfishness, a hope
to get people to start choosing. He
criticized Dean Smith's choice to
"help persecute and prosecute Stan
ford students. Grfesom's parting
vision saw "... Stanford students
all on the verge of crying."
Pervading Culture
ASSU President David Harris spoke
of "a new way to look at the uni
versity—as a culture, a set of atti
tudes which pervade it as much as
its mechanics pervade it."
Harris scrutinized the University
environment as all-important in stu
dent education: he believes that a
university "can't purport to educate
and play the role of control" simul
taneously. He saw the social forms
created by the university as indefens
—that "... a basic condition for
education is independent involve
ment."
Harris stated that ,in his present en
vironment, the student has been con
ditioned to "go asking." "The first
thing that has to take place in this
university," Harris noted, "is the stu
dents going out and finding new
mechanilsms to educate."
He called "unfortunate" tht attitude
that "Dave Harris is going to make
Stanford an exciting place"—he view
ed student initiative as far more im
portant: 'When students organize
themselves to get what they want, it
will come."
In A Person's Head
Harris defined all education as self
education: "No one does education
to you—learning takes place in each
person's head." Consequently, he said,
a student is "something that exists
independently of faculty, administra
tion, or the university."
A personal look at Stanford educa
tion was exposed by Victor Lovell,
holder of three Stanford degrees and
an assistant professor of psychology
at San Francisco State. He spoke "as
a member of The Experiment and the
alumni." He criticized the university's
"set of conventions" which cramp a
student as "tools of scholarship." He
saw the professor as having "some
thing left, but not much" after per
sonal, vocational, and social commit
ments. He quoted one of his profes
sors as saying "I don't really know
what to do about it."
Advance Knowledge
Lovell established the thesis that a
university "advances knowledge, com
municates knowledge, and builds char
acter, but only certain kinds of char
acter for certain kinds of societies.
The university builds a man who does
what he is told, doesn't ask too many
questions."
He stressed the irony that his posi
tion seems a bit paranoid, for he did
not present it in the atmosphere of
the classroom. "It would sound like
a truism in sociology class."
Lovell viewed the need for "pro
grams in which students take the re
sponsibility of their own education—
design courses, teach courses, and not
only learn but apply to the society in
which they live." He struck down the
objection of student inexperience: "Ex
perience is not always enlightening,
but can be corrupting if it occurs in a
corrupt system." Lovell saw as most
important the need for student com
mitment; he looks for a "student plea
for home rule, a frank call for stu
dent power."
