# LASSU Approves Five Student Cl5 Nominations
## 
### CHRIS HARTE Associate Editor 
Five student members of the Com
mittee of Fifteen (Cl 5) were ap
proved in an historic LASSU session
last night.
Student Body President David Har
ris appointed himself, Tom Forsten

zer, Jan Handke, Martin Gerry, and
Charles Dupree to membership on the
University's highest arbitration com
mittee. LASSU quickly approved all
five, subject to reapproval next week
when they appear before the Legis
lature.
"Members simply had no face-to-face
contact with the appointees," Forsten
zer commented, "and I expect that
next week, once all five have appeared
before us and Dave has explained his
appointments, the body will approve
his choices."
Forstenzer also mentioned some of
the items that would come before the
Committee of Fifteen early this quar
ter, possibly at the first meeting, Fri
day. Open house hours and the re
establishment of the student coffee
house will undoubtedly be discussed,
"along with various other frictions
that may come up in the next few
weeks," he said.
Shortest Ever
The meeting, memorable because it
lasted less than an hour, was somber
and quiet by comparison to some of
last year's meetings when open house,
liquor regulations, JIOTC, Committee
of Fifteen recall and other contro

versial topics were considered.
Forstenzer made it clear that he
was speaker "only for the time being,"
and mentioned a desire to return to his
former position of liaison officer be
tween the Harris administration and
the Legislature.
"But no matter how charismatic the
president's office may seem to be," he
added, "this (LASSU) is the real
source of power ,and that's how I
plan to keep it."
The only important legislative ac
tion of the evening was the referral
of enabling legislation for the Hous
ing Commission to the temporary
Rules Committee. The bill will be re
ported out next week.
