Had a
unique
experience?
If , real or imaginary,
(ell us about it in a
limerick and we'll send
you a completely
unique token of our
appreciation. Here's an
example:
"A chemistry major
named Bleaker,
Drank his Colt 45
from a beaker,
He said, 'It's more *
fun! Â£
It holds two cans,
not one,
As an experience,
it's even uniquer.'"
Get the idea? Get it
down on a post card -
and send to:
Limerick Contest,
Box 45, Colt, Arkansas.
In the meantime, try ;i
this for inspiration!
