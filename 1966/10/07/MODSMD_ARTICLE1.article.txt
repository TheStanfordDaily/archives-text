The dedication will take place in

parents, and friends are expected to
attend.
Also participating in the program
are University President J. E. Wallace
Sterling, board chairman George G.
Montgomery, Richard Guggenhime,
president of the Board of Trustees,
and Business School Dean Ernest C.
Arbuckle. Arbuckle, according to Di
rector of Alumni Relations Paul John
son, "has given major impetus to the
building of the new school, since he
became Dean in 1958."
Gradual Expansion
Over seven years in planning and
almost two years in construction by
Engstrum and Nourse, the new build
ing will provide for gradual expan
sion. The number of master's degree
candidates, now 450, will increase to
650; in residence Ph.D. candidates,
now 82 in number, will increase to 100.
There will be a greater exchange
between degree candidates and the 56
professors of business from develop
ing countries in South America, Afri
ca, and Asia, participating in the
school's International Center for the
Advancement of Management Educa
tion, ICAME.
The school's component facilities,

which in the 40 years since the school
was established have been spread out
over six locations, will all be housed
in the one building, including the Wil
liam P. Roth Center for Advanced
Management, the Alfred P. Sloan Cen
ter for Management Education, and
the J. Hugh Jackson Library, with a
capacity of over 200,000 volumes.
The new building also provides for
the 347-seat Bishop Auditorium, 14
classrooms for 34-66 students each,
nine seminar rooms, 10 student con
ference rooms, 65 Ph.D. study carrels,
82 faculty offices, and three faculty
conference rooms.
500 Donors
The construction of the building was
financed by gifts from 500 donors,
notably $1 million both from the fam
ily of the late William P. Roth and the
Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. The De
partment of Health, Education, and
Welfare made a $1.3 million grant;
corporate donations amounted to ap
proximately $1 million, as did individ
ual gifts.
"The new Graduate School of Busi
ness building will consolidate 40 years
of widely scattered programs and fa
cilities under one roof and will em
body the teaching, research, and aspi
rations of a tremendously committed
faculty, administration, and group of
students," commented Samuel A.
Pond, Associate Dean, on the recently
completed school.
"It is more than another structure,"
stated Associate Dean Pond. "We have
had to determine much more than
its outward designâ€”the kind of grad
uate school we wanted, its size, cur
riculum, and policy. We have had to
rethink and construct the school as
well as the building that will house it."
