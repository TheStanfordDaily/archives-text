# Archivist Speaks Of SU's Youth
## 
### PAMELA LANG 
"Today young Americans are
rebellious and searching for
change — and change is in the
wind. As Stanford enters its
75th year it will face this chal
lenge with the same caliber of
human resources that saw it
through the difficult years of its
founding."
This was the conclusion of
University archivist Ralph W.
Hansen in a speech yesterday
afternoon in the Bender Room
of the Main Library. Entitled
"Trial and Triumph: The Early
Years of Stanford University,"
the talk marked the opening of
a special 75th anniversary exhi
bition of photographs and me
morabilia of the University and
its founders.
"Students who attended Stan
ford University during the life
time of the founders generally
had a great deal of respect and
admiration for the Stanfords,"

began Hansen, who is head of
the Stanford Collection, the Li
brary's manuscripts librarian,
and city historian of Palo Alto.
Founders Unknown
"Today," though, he contin
ued, "75 years after the found
ing of the University, the found
ers are to a vast majority of the
university family unknown and
are held in light regard."
Few undergraduates were
present to hear Hansen speak.
Many of the 100 persons crowd
ed into the Bender Room —
where the talk was briefly inter
rupted by the chiming of a large
grandfather clock—had received
special invitations to the public
lecture, which inaugurated the
Library's fall Intermezzo series.
Hansen first described the
founding of the University, tell
ing how the Stanfords came to
decide on a school for "the chil
dren of California" as a fitting
memorial for their son. He

quoted a story by President
Charles W. Eliot of Harvard,
who told the couple "that $5
million would be the. minimum
endowment for an institution
that charged no tuition."
!\lrs. Stanford Nodded
"A silence followed" this state
ment, wrote Eliot, "and Mrs.
Stanford looked grave; but after
an appreciable interval Mr.
Stanford said with a smile,
'Well, Jane, we could manage
that, couldn't we?' and Mrs.
Stanford nodded."
After Senator Stanford died on
June 21, 1893, his estate was tied
up in probate and Mrs. Stan
ford's attitude on matters of
University policy became quite
conservative.
After she forced President
Jordan to fire a popular young
professor of sociology who had
publicly endorsed a political
candidate (the Senator wanted
the University to be strictly tton

partisan), Mrs. Stanford and the
President were condemned for
"violating the principle of aca
demic freedom."
Jordan's Choice
According to Hansen, Jordan
"had a choice between the insti
tution he served and the ideal
of University teaching; he chose
the former, thus preserving the
institution from possible clo
sure."
Hansen ended his talk with a
description of the '06 earth
quake. "Almost to a man," he
said, "faculty, alumni, and stu
dents gave thanks that Mrs.
Stanford was spared seeing the
dreadful destruction."
"Stanford not only recovered"
from the earthquake; concluded
Hansen, but "it continued to
grow and prosper—as shown in
the high quality and the loyalty
of its faculty members and stu
dents."

Stanford said with a smile,
'Well, Jane, we could manage
that, couldn't we?' and Mrs.
Stanford nodded."
After Senator Stanford died on
June 21, 1893, his estate was tied
up in probate and Mrs. Stan
ford's attitude on matters of
University policy became quite
conservative.
After she forced President
Jordan to fire a popular young
professor of sociology who had
publicly endorsed a political
candidate (the Senator wanted
the University to be strictly tton

partisan), Mrs. Stanford and the
President were condemned for
"violating the principle of aca
demic freedom."
Jordan's Choice
According to Hansen, Jordan
"had a choice between the insti
tution he served and the ideal
of University teaching; he chose
the former, thus preserving the
institution from possible clo
sure."
Hansen ended his talk with a
description of the '06 earth
quake. "Almost to a man," he
said, "faculty, alumni, and stu
dents gave thanks that Mrs.
Stanford was spared seeing the
dreadful destruction."
"Stanford not only recovered"
from the earthquake; concluded
Hansen, but "it continued to
grow and prosper—as shown in
the high quality and the loyalty
of its faculty members and stu
dents."
"Today young Americans are
rebellious and searching for
change — and change is in the
wind. As Stanford enters its
75th year it will face this chal
lenge with the same caliber of
human resources that saw it
through the difficult years of its
founding."
This was the conclusion of
University archivist Ralph W.
Hansen in a speech yesterday
afternoon in the Bender Room
of the Main Library. Entitled
"Trial and Triumph: The Early
Years of Stanford University,"
the talk marked the opening of
a special 75th anniversary exhi
bition of photographs and me
morabilia of the University and
its founders.
"Students who attended Stan
ford University during the life
time of the founders generally
had a great deal of respect and
admiration for the Stanfords,"

began Hansen, who is head of
the Stanford Collection, the Li
brary's manuscripts librarian,
and city historian of Palo Alto.
Founders Unknown
"Today," though, he contin
ued, "75 years after the found
ing of the University, the found
ers are to a vast majority of the
university family unknown and
are held in light regard."
Few undergraduates were
present to hear Hansen speak.
Many of the 100 persons crowd
ed into the Bender Room —
where the talk was briefly inter
rupted by the chiming of a large
grandfather clock—had received
special invitations to the public
lecture, which inaugurated the
Library's fall Intermezzo series.
Hansen first described the
founding of the University, tell
ing how the Stanfords came to
decide on a school for "the chil
dren of California" as a fitting
memorial for their son. He

quoted a story by President
Charles W. Eliot of Harvard,
who told the couple "that $5
million would be the. minimum
endowment for an institution
that charged no tuition."
!\lrs. Stanford Nodded
"A silence followed" this state
ment, wrote Eliot, "and Mrs.
Stanford looked grave; but after
an appreciable interval Mr.
Stanford said with a smile,
'Well, Jane, we could manage
that, couldn't we?' and Mrs.
