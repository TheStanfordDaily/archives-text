• Johnson To Visit Far East
WASHINGTON—Lyndon B. Johnson con
firmed officially yesterday that his first presi
dential trip overseas will be the most exten
sive visit to the Far East ever launched by
an American chief executive.
It begins October 17 and winds up November
2 and in between Johnson will cover roughly
25,000 miles and visit the capitals of New Zea
land, Australia, the Philippines, Thailand, Ma
laysia and Korea.
The over-riding objective of the trip is to
help the cause of an honorable peace in Viet
nam. This will be a focal point of a conference
in Manila, which in turn will be the focal point
of the journey that will cover the distance
around the earth.
But as for visiting Vietnam itself, Johnson
said that:
"No consideration has been given at this
time to any such proposal or any such visit."
Vietnam is a combat area, of course, and
ordinarily Presidents stay out of them. None
has been in one since the late Franklin D.
Roosevelt went to North Africa after most of
the World War II fighting there had subsided.
Still, it would occasion no undue amount of
surprise should Johnson show up suddenly and
unannounced, under strictest security precau
tions, somewhere in Vietnam sometime during
the Pacific expedition.

• Hanai Charges Defoliation
TOKYO —North Vietnam charged yesterday
that the United States sprayed tons of toxic
chemicals on the western sector of the de
militarized zone on September 29 for the sec
ond time within 10 days.
In a message sent to the International Con
trol Commission (ICC), the Communists said
a number of civilians in three villages in the
northern part of the demilitarized zone were
affected and the vegetation and crops in the
area destroyed.
The message was broadcast by Hanoi's Viet
nam news agency and monitored in Tokyo.
The U.S. command in Saigon has acknowl
edged limited defoliation of areas south of the
demilitarized zone in efforts to deprive North
Vietnamese infiltrators of natural cover. The
U.S. command, however, previously has denied
reports that the zone itself was being de
foliated.
The message said that the United States has
been continuously conducting air and ground
operations in the 45-mile long, six-mile wide
strip set up by the 1954 Geneva agreements as
a military-free buffer zone between North and
South Vietnam.
• Congress Amends School Bill
WASHINGTON—Congress voted more fed
eral aid for the nation's schools yesterday but

the House added an ironclad prohibition
against any federal requirement for busing
school children to overcome racial imbalance.
The House also adopted an amendment that
would slow down efforts by U.S. Education
Commissioner Harold Howe II to speed up the
pace of school desegregation in the South.
In quick succession the Senate passed a bill
authorizing $6.4 billion and then the House
passed one for $5.7 billion—both to continue
for two more years the elementray and sec
ondary school programs launched last year.
• Government To Aid Addicts
WASHINGTON — The Senate approved a
new approach to the problem of drug addic
tion yesterday by passing a bill providing for
civil commitment and treatment.
The House has passed a similar bill and a
Senate-House conference committee is expect-

Ed to iron out the differences. The legislation
was urged by President Johnson as part of his
anti-crime program.
Under the bill an addict charged with a fed
eral crime other than crimes of violence could
be committed to the custody of the U.S. Sur
geon General for treatment and rehabilitation
rather than sent to prison.
• Scientists Perfect Fake Heart
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind.—A team of Indiana
University Medical School scientists an
nounced yesterday they have perfected a com
plete mechanical heart and are ready to im
plant it in a patient who otherwise would
certainly die.
It has performed efficiently, without bad
side effects, in short-term animal experiments.
The project was different from that of other
groups who have been designing and testing
devices or pumps to ease the load of a di
seased —but not hopelessly damaged—heart.
• Card Burner Gets Five Years
BOSTON —A federal court sentenced David
C. Benson, 18, of Cambridge, to five years in
prison yesterday for destroying his draft card.
Judge Anthony Julian said Benson i6 re
quired to undergo psychiatric study and the
sentence will be reviewed by the court after
the study.
Benson was convicted by a jury September

22 of burning his draft card and of destroying
his draft classification notice at pacifist dem
onstrations in March.
Benson told the court he is a pacifist and
that the selective service system "perpetuates
violence."
• Stock Market Falls Again
NEW YORK — The stock market skidded
again yesterday to the lowest mark in nearly
three years.
Trading was active.
The closely watched Dow Jones Average of
30 industrial stocks fell 5.84 to 749.61 at the
opening of trading Monday.
Stock brokers said the market was nervous
in anticipation of lower corporate earnings
and confusing news about the war In Viet
Nam.
• U.S.S.R. Prohibits Slander
MOSCOW — A new Russian law provides
stiff penalties for "spreading deliberately false
fabrications defaming the Soviet state and so
cial structure."
The new law was published in the most re
cent edition of the bulletin of the Supreme
Soviet (Parliament) of the Russian Federa
tion, the biggest and most important Soviet
Republic.
The crime may be punished by up to three
years imprisonment, up to one year at hard
labor or a fine of up to 100 rubles ($111).
