# SOMETHING TO DO
## Valley Wineries Offer Free Samples 
### STEVE GRUBER 
STANFORD—The wine flows
freely only a few minutes from
here.
There is no celebration going
on, no fiesta, no country fair.
It happens everyday at the four
wineries of the Santa Clara Val
ley.
Two of them, the Paul Mas
son Winery and the Almaden
Winery will offer you as much
as you can drink. The other
two, the San Martin Winery and
the Los Altos Winery, ration
their products.
The Masson Winery
Located near highway 85 in
Saratoga, the Paul Masson Win
ery looks like something out of
the fantasy world of Disneyland.
It stands next to part of Mas
son's vineyards, designated by a
sign reading "Registered Mother
Vineyard."
Walk up the circular ramp
and you reached the land of the
winetasters. Only in the wildest
dreams of a Market Street wino
would so much good wine be
found in the same place. But
first, a guide for Paul Masson
will show you through the win
ery with a twenty minute tour.
After the wine is stamped in
early Autumn, it is fermented
in huge oak casks, some of
which are over thirty feet high.
It is left there for periods from
six weeks to three months, de
pending on the wine.
little Old Wlnemaker
There are many jokes about
little old winemakers, but Mas
son actually employs one. He
didn't learn his trade at UCLA,
or even San Jose State. All that
he knows about wines was
passed down to him by his fath
er and grandfather. It is his job
to sample each cask to decide
when it is ready to leave the fer
menting stage. During the ag
ing process, he checks the casks
occasionally to see how they are
progressing.
The tour also includes a look
at the bottle-filling room and
the labeling machines. The en
tire winery is spotless and mod
ern.
A visit to the champagne

settling room marks the last
part of the tour. In an area as
large as a warehouse are ap
proximately three million bot
tles of Masson's champagne.
Exploding Bottles
While the tour is proceeding
through the champagne settling
room, one or two bottles may be
expected to explode. All of Mas
son's champagne is allowed fer
ment in the bottle, causing high
pressures to build up over the
months. Occasionally the pres
sure is more than the bottle can
take and the bottom will break
off, causing the neck to shoot
several feet away across the
rows of bottles.
At last the time comes to taste
the wine. Masson has twenty dif
ferent kinds to sample and vis
itors are welcome to try all
twenty. Each sample is about
two or three ounces and pink
champagne is included on the
wine list.
Visitors leaving the tasting
room are easily identifiable due
to their drunkenness. People
have been known to be unable
to find their cars for a few min
utes (located in a parking lot
less than a hundred yards
away) after tippling at Mas
son's.
San Martin Winery
The next stop on the Santa
Clara Valley wine tasting route
is the San Martin Winery, just
a mile south of the little town
of San Martin on highway 101.
The San Martin winery is
much more commercial than
Masson. Visitors are invited to
gather around a long bar at in
tervals of twenty minutes and
then the demonstration begins.
Ten to fifteen samples of wine
may be expected, however, the
sample sizes are smaller—about
one ounce. But it's free.
The Los Altos Winery is two
miles south of Gilroy, also on
Highway 101 Operated on a
much more informal basis than
the other two wineries, Los
Altos is staffed by one or two
people. The wine list is much
shorter, but it does feature Los
Altos' excellent May wine. Trhee
or four two ounce drinks is the

maximum at this tasting room.
San Juan Bautista
The small city of San Juan
Bautista appears to have been
bypassed by time. Much of the
old Spanish atmosphere is still
present. The Almaden vinery
blends in so well with the mis
sion and the town plaza that it
is actually difficult to find.
But the search will prove to
be rewarding. The tasting room
is strictly noncommercial and
the wine never stops flowing.
Ask for Alamden's most ex
pensive champagne, Blanc de
Blancs (over $5.50 a fifth) and
you'll get it. The bartenders

know their wines and the ex
perience can prove to be educa
tional as well as alcoholic.
Uncluttered
Even if you surpassed your
wine limit back in Gilroy, the
trip to San Juan Bautista is a
must. The Almaden winery over
looks a long valley that is un
cluttered by billboards and gas
stations. It is a sight seldom
seen in California these days.
And don't make the mistake
that this writer made after an
afternoon of winetasting in the
Santa Clara Valley—Stanford is
north of San Juan Bautista, not
south.
