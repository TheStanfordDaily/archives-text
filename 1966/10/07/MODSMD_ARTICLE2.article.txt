# C15 To Consider Open House
## 
### CHRIS HARTE Associate Editor 
The conflict of law over open house,
intensified yesterday when a student
who violated the administration's va
riety of regulations was summoned
to appear before the student Judicial
Council, goes before the Committee of
Fifteen (Cl 5) today.
According to Philip H Khinelander,
Professor of Philosophy and Humani
ties and chairman of the student-fac

ulty-administration committee last
year, "our first business will be the
election of new officers, and then we
have several carryover items from
last year, one of which is open house.
Then we are anxious to get on to edu
cational matters."
The committee meets at 4:30 this
afternoon.
The conflict of law arose last spring
when LASSU amended the ASSU By-
Laws to radically extend open house

hours. The administration did not fol
low the students' lead.
Administration rules maintain four
hours on each of two specified days as
the maximum amount of time a stu
dent may have a visitor of the opposite
sex in his room. ASSU allows each in
dividual living unit to determine its
own policy within the guideline of
noon to midnight on weekdays and r 0
a.m. to 2:30 a.m. Friday and Saturday.
While a committee of the Legisla

ture was conducting its study of the
open house situation and making rec
ommendations on the basis of the
study, a subcommittee of the advisory
committee to President Sterling on
Student Affairs and Services was also
deliberating the issue.
Its report, approved by the whole
committee, was given to Sterling
shortly after commencement, but he
has neither made any statement about
the recommendations nor made public
any of their details. High administra
tion officials have revealed, however,
that the report does not ask for much
change in regulations.
Judicial Procedure
In the case now before the Judicial
Council a student violated administra
tion open house regulations last
spring and then called the house di
rector to his room to create a test
case. The director reported the viola
tion to Associate Dean of Students
Bob Gordon, who referred the case to
the council.
The Council can only judge whether
a student has violated an ASSU reg
ulation or the fundamental standard.
In the present case the student was in
violation of administration dictates but
not of student rules.
