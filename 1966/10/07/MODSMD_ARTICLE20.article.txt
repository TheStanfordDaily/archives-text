# 'Russian's Are Coming': Arsenal Of Wit
## 
### LARRY BIEHL 
That a community perched on
■v the Eastern-most perimeter of
"our national boundary should
be alert to the possibilities of a
full-scale enemy invasion
against its cottaged shores is, of
course, understandable. For the
courage and valor exhibited in
clearing America of Red Coats,
Turn Coats, Waist Coats, assort
ed hobgobblins and witches are
-legendary. New England shall
always be the hot-bed of pa
triotism.

Little wonder it is, then, that
the inhabitants of Gloucester
Island, off the coast of Massa
chusetts, turn their efforts once
more to national defense when
a Russian submarine comman
der, eager to catch a view of
America, runs his ship aground.
Aware of possible international
implications, a small force is
sent ashore under the leadership
of Alan Arkin to secure a power
launch and therefore, a means
to extricate their sub from such
danger.

They first of all run into Mr.
Whitaker (Carl Reinner) whose
attempted heroics, meant to
stifle his son's accusation that
he is, in fact, Beendict Arnold,
wins but minor success as the
Russians steal his car and pro
ceed into town in search of a
boat. But, alas, the car runs out
of gas, and with the tune of "Its
a Long Way to Tipperary" soft
ly in the background, the land
ing force begins the trek into
town.
Invasionary Force
In West Village, they spot the
car of Murial, the Post Mistress.
Thinking them to be mischie
vous teenagers, Murial runs to
the defense of her Pierce Arrow.
Recognizing that they are in
fact not teenagers, but "Rus
kies," she runs to her phone to
sound the alarm before she is
caught and bound. But the dan
ger has been done. Seven men
in search of a boat become a So
viet invasionary force backed by
naval and air power of untold
quantity.
Finding comfort and leader
ship in their proud V.F.W. Unit
(Commanded by Paul Ford) and
inspired by the traditional
American love of the underdog,
the citizens of Gloucester Is
'land, armed with firearms of
Revolutionary, Civil War, Span
ish American, and World War I

vintage with an occasional long
bow and harpoon thrown in for
good measure, shoulder respon
sibility and run to protect their
most sacred shores. Even the
village lush (Ben Blue) is mel
lowed by visions of glory and
staggers to find his horse so
that he may recreate Paul Re
vere's wild ride.
Thus the Russian "invasion
ary forces" find themselves the
victims of a manhunt. All means
to ease out of a most embarras
sing situation have been thwart
ed.
Packed With Wit
No movie packed with such
wit: Jonathon Winters, Carl
Reimer, Paul Ford, and, the
most delightful surprise of all,
Alan Arkin — the Russian Char
lie Brown—can help but be fun
ny. The humor is neither forced
nor contrived, but simply
evolves from the natural reac
tions and responses of the New
England townspeople. Just as
the Russian language is main
tained throughout by the sub
marine's crew, so are the idio
syncrises and peculiarities of
the American seaboard ruthless
ly exploited. The movie moves
steadily from the serious, an ac
cident at sea—to the absurd, a
town in panic over a rumor.
The only weak spot in the
movie comes at the end when

the tone shifts once again back
to the semi-serious. The subma
rine has dislodged itself from
the sand bar, moved into the
harbor, and its captain (Theo
dore Beckell) has threatened to
destroy the town if his landing
force is not returned unharmed.
The city police chief (Brian
Keith) replies with everything
from a parking violation to ful]
arrest, but to no avail; a stale
mate sets in as guns on both
sides are aimed and cocked.

Then a small boy slips from
his perch on the church steeple,
slides down the roof and hangs
by his belt precariously from
atop a drain pipe. This draws
the two sides together in an ef
fort to save the boy and, of
course, a Russian becomes the
town's hero. This 'deus ex ma
cina" device is admittedly un
satisfactory, but "we've laughed
too hard for too long to judge
"The Russians Are Coming, the
Russians Are Coming" anything
but very clever and most amus
ing.
In an aura of mutual affection
and appreciation, the submarine
slips into the deep, and the
brave citizens, content that they
have once again rallied 'round
the flag in defense of their
homeland, paddle proudly back
to shore.

Finding comfort and leader

caught and bound. But the dan
ger has been done. Seven men
in search of a boat become a So
viet invasionary force backed by
naval and air power of untold
quantity.
Finding comfort and leader
ship in their proud V.F.W. Unit
(Commanded by Paul Ford) and
inspired by the traditional
American love of the underdog,
the citizens of Gloucester Is
'land, armed with firearms of
Revolutionary, Civil War, Span
ish American, and World War I

vintage with an occasional long
bow and harpoon thrown in for
good measure, shoulder respon
sibility and run to protect their
most sacred shores. Even the
village lush (Ben Blue) is mel
lowed by visions of glory and
staggers to find his horse so
that he may recreate Paul Re
vere's wild ride.
Thus the Russian "invasion
ary forces" find themselves the
victims of a manhunt. All means
to ease out of a most embarras
sing situation have been thwart
ed.
Packed With Wit
No movie packed with such
wit: Jonathon Winters, Carl
Reimer, Paul Ford, and, the
most delightful surprise of all,
Alan Arkin — the Russian Char
lie Brown—can help but be fun
ny. The humor is neither forced
nor contrived, but simply
evolves from the natural reac
tions and responses of the New
England townspeople. Just as
the Russian language is main
tained throughout by the sub
marine's crew, so are the idio
syncrises and peculiarities of
the American seaboard ruthless
ly exploited. The movie moves
steadily from the serious, an ac
cident at sea—to the absurd, a
town in panic over a rumor.
The only weak spot in the
movie comes at the end when

the tone shifts once again back
to the semi-serious. The subma
rine has dislodged itself from
the sand bar, moved into the
harbor, and its captain (Theo
dore Beckell) has threatened to
destroy the town if his landing
force is not returned unharmed.
The city police chief (Brian
Keith) replies with everything
from a parking violation to ful]
arrest, but to no avail; a stale
mate sets in as guns on both
sides are aimed and cocked.

Then a small boy slips from
his perch on the church steeple,
slides down the roof and hangs
by his belt precariously from
atop a drain pipe. This draws
the two sides together in an ef
fort to save the boy and, of
course, a Russian becomes the
town's hero. This 'deus ex ma
cina" device is admittedly un
satisfactory, but "we've laughed
too hard for too long to judge
"The Russians Are Coming, the
Russians Are Coming" anything
but very clever and most amus
ing.
In an aura of mutual affection
and appreciation, the submarine
slips into the deep, and the
brave citizens, content that they
have once again rallied 'round
the flag in defense of their
homeland, paddle proudly back
to shore.
That a community perched on
■v the Eastern-most perimeter of
"our national boundary should
be alert to the possibilities of a
full-scale enemy invasion
against its cottaged shores is, of
course, understandable. For the
courage and valor exhibited in
clearing America of Red Coats,
Turn Coats, Waist Coats, assort
ed hobgobblins and witches are
-legendary. New England shall
always be the hot-bed of pa
triotism.

Little wonder it is, then, that
the inhabitants of Gloucester
Island, off the coast of Massa
chusetts, turn their efforts once
more to national defense when
a Russian submarine comman
der, eager to catch a view of
America, runs his ship aground.
Aware of possible international
implications, a small force is
sent ashore under the leadership
of Alan Arkin to secure a power
launch and therefore, a means
to extricate their sub from such
danger.

They first of all run into Mr.
Whitaker (Carl Reinner) whose
attempted heroics, meant to
stifle his son's accusation that
he is, in fact, Beendict Arnold,
wins but minor success as the
Russians steal his car and pro
ceed into town in search of a
boat. But, alas, the car runs out
of gas, and with the tune of "Its
a Long Way to Tipperary" soft
ly in the background, the land
ing force begins the trek into
town.

In West Village, they spot the

Thinking them to be mischie

Recognizing that they are in

sound the alarm before she is
