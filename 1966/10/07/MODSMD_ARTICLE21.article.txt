# 'ALL MY SONS'
## Vigor, Ending In Greatness 
### BRUCE MERRY 
Arthur Miller: "All My Sons"
(Manhattan Playhouse, Palo
Alto).
Irish director Larry Jordan,
who produced Brendan Behan's
"Hostage" on Campus three
years ago, gave a stark and
vigorous reading of Miller's
tragedy last Saturday. He aims
to move his audiences, he de
clares—to mount a tragedy
which, as Aristotle laid down,
should purify the soul of the
spectator with the wind of
powerful passions. This Mr. Jor
dan achieves.
First we have a suburban
garden and a banal discussion
of the news in the Sunday pa
pers which John Osborne must
have remembered for his first
act badinage in "Look Back in
Anger." We hardly expect the

gentle boy in love with the "girl
next door", (the somewhat ideal
istic son who mumbles "I just
like to keep abreast of my ig
norance" over the book-page of
the newspaper) to beat his fa
ther in a horror of guilt, to cry
out with the stiflled rage of Ib
sen's heroes against pusillanimi
ty in the family group, or to
drive his father inexorably to
his end.
Mr. Angeloff carried off this
mingled piety and integrity
with growing confidence as the
play climbed out of the first
act. He and Mr. Bontempi, as
the father, showed a particular
ly good command of gesture
and movement on the stage.
As the father slides into ruin
his son grows to maturity. To
talk of social responsibility and
a cosmic sense of guilt is mis

leading: this is the parallel
drama of a growing son and a
declining father: "I'm sixty-one,
Chris, I'm sixty-one"—cries Joe
with the agony of age. This
diagonal development is sus
tained by the mother, who re
fuses to believe in the other
son's, in her Larry's death in
the war. But even she is sane,
and it is on her lap that Joe
will lean his sinking head when
his son begins to understand.
An Unworthy Technique?
Monti, a minor Italian play
wright around 1800, said that
the use of letters on the live
stage was a technique unwor
thy of true drama. Miss Daren,
as Annie, "Larry's girl", brought
off this device with fine his
tronic timing. And her brother's
entrance provoked the tensest
acting in the tragedy: in Mr.
Flath's George Deever, in fact,
we saw in twenty minutes the
whole gamut of resentment,
pride and loneliness. "My Fa
ther, ... he hates your guts
Joe" — he declares in mea
sured tones, and Mr. Bontempi
portrayed a Joe pulling on his
cigar with the steady conviction
of a tycoon hovering unwitting
ly over the black depths of an
abyss.
This i6 a play to be seen, and
for anyone who sits through the
first act, the second and third
will insinuate a thrill of great
ness.
