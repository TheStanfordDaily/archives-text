# Red Hat Reels To Hasty Tune

THE RED HAT: 321 California
Ave., Palo Alto (near the Fine
Arts Theatre).
A newly-organized night spot
catering specifically to the Stan
ford community, the Red Hat
features dancing, entertainment,
beer, and dinner. At the moment,
the Red Hat is presenting "The
Hasty Assembly," an R&R
group composed of the best from
several professional bands (in
cluding Rose Anne, formerly
the female singer with the Jef
ferson Airplane). They will also
play at an all-afternoon jam ses
sion this Sunday. The atmo
sphere is casual, and there is no
cover charge or minimum.
