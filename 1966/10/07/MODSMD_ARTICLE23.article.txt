# Trip Into T.V. 's Inner-World
## 
### BOB MENIFEE 
Hardly any of the people who
sit for hours in front of a tele
vision set fully realize the time
and money that is expended dur
ing the daily 18 broadcast hours
that keeps them alive. Not that
all of us regulate our eating and
bathroom habits to fit into the
3 minute commercial slots of
Petticoat Junction, Bonanza, or
the Late, Late Shows, but it's
the commercial that keeps the
industry alive.
The young bearded genera
tion, which has grown up with
television, almost takes the
magic tube for granted. Many
of us say we can live without
it . . . but who screams and
pounds when he turns on the
set and gets a lot of fuzzy lines
which don't look a thing like
Max Smart. And it isn't good
enough just to HEAR a pro
gram ... it is too frustrating
to have a picture tube without
a picture . . . for that we have
the radio.
Every new season many peo
ple gripe about the new shows,
which are just like last seasons
shows (the T. V. creed is "If
you can't get your own pro
gram, COPY Channel 3's"). They
gripe, yeah, but they also
watch. People also watch the
ads, and run out and buy thou
sands of tons of "Mr. Whipple,"
just because their kids saw an
ad with a mound of jiggling jel
lo talking to some other mound
of more jiggling jello.
The Unscathed Three
The only people who are real
ly tolerant of television are the
people who work for television,
or perhaps the people who sell
them. Of course, the three ma
jor T.V. networks are the
Apostheoses of Enlightenment
and cannot be criticized, after
all they support the local sta
tions with daily feed. Local sta
tions are forbidden to mooch
off the networks all day
long. The FCC (Federal Com
munications Control) says you
HAVE to have some shows of
your own. And so, local televi
sion becomes a gigantic opera
tion, employing hundreds of
people, and often putting some
of the worst junk on the air . . .
not that they don' t try hard . . .
it is just difficult to please
everyone.
The local television station is
usually in some old office build
ing, or even a warehouse, which
is starting off all wrong, like
buying your clothes at the Sal
vation Army . . . Whoever is
running the station hires a
switchboard girl, who sits in
front of a switchboard and says
"Good morning, this is channel
8, may I help you?", or worse,
"Good morning, this is channel
8, will you hold? click." After
you light your cigarette, you
rudely demand to speak to
someone, and she has the nerve
to cheerily say "Thank you,"
and plugs you in. (Why do
switchboard operators thank
YOU when YOU are the one
who should thank her?) Any
way, you gotta have a switch
board girl.
Secretaries Galore
You must also have a flock
of secretaries, the kind with rat
ted hair and sparks flying from
their spiked heels as they dig
up the linoleum. The secretaries
work around the office, helping
the president, the executive staff
(who are always very flashy,
with pinky rings), and the
salesmen.
The salesmen for T.V. sta
tions are the most important
people to the industry. They are
the ones who sell the time on

the air to advertisers. Anyone
will tell you that if you want
to rise, you should start out
as a salesman. Never, they say,
NEVER, get stuck in the News
Department.
I say, the News Department
is the best place to get stuck,
because it is the most fun place
. . . that is, if it's only for a
summer job. The News Depart
ment is really where the main
activity is. The news
show is popular with almost
everyone . . . it's easier than
reading a newspaper, and you
can still get up and run to the
refrigerator without missing
anything.
Everyone knows that news
paper people work day and
night, and suffer untold horrors
to scrape up news. TV newsmen
also work day and night, but
they can't broadcast all the
news that is fit to print.
Topless Mother of Eight
If Channel 8 ran a story
about the topless mother of
eight picketing in San Francis
co, every little old lady in red
tennis shoes would call the sta
tion and tell them that she
would NEVER watch Channel 8
again, NEVER! And even
though those same little old
ladies are not watching, they
will call again, as soon as you
make a mistake, to tell you they
will never watch Channel 8
again. Hundreds of little ol d
ladies have memorized Channel
B's number and will call at the
least mishap . . . And not be
cause you have edited the sex
out of the early show, but be
cause you left it in.
Anyone who works in a tele
vision station is familiar with
crank calls, mostly from women
who probably aren't sober
enough to iron. A woman called
one day, during the afternoon
kiddie show, with that lollie
pop-sucking-child-loving- funster
himself, Cowboy Clyde ("Hi
there, small fry!"), and 6 aid
that the cleavage on one of the
puppets (it was a puppet show)

had upset her son. She thought
it was a vulgar display of sex
planned by the communists to
upset her son. Well, there isn't
much you can do, so I asked her
how old her son was. "He's
Five . . Sharp kid.
And then another call, one
evening during the news broad
cast. "I really don't know how
to say this," she said. "It's kind
of embarassing, but I just got
upset when the weatherman
puts his hands on the sports
caster. I mean, I just can't help
it, he shouldn't touch him, or
anything." I think it was a wom
an. And then, since my sympa
thies were somewhat muted, she
yelled: "I think the weatherman
is a great big fairy." Etc., Etc.
Since I didn't really like the
weatherman anyway, I wrote
her comments down, as sort of
an extra service, and put it dis
creetly on his desk.
Tennis Shoes Fly
One of the other announcers,
who hosts the Early Show, likes
to play "See the switchboard
girl tear her hair." During his
broadcast, when all the gals
have their jugs of martinis, and
are watching Paul Muni escape
from the chain gang, the host
casually drops the hint that if
they want to know the answer
to a certain question, just call
him up at ol' Channel 8 (cue:
smile and wink). Tennis shoes
fly, it's Christmas in the lobby,
and that's how we got rid of Lu
cille, who couldn't answer the
phone anyway.
So the next time you turn
your T.V. on, have a little re
spect for the great efforts that
are behind all the junk you will
probably see. All except the
news, which some day will
realize the potential power it
has. And if you really want to
protest, go buy some red ten
nys, memorize the number, and
call whenever you feel the urge.
They will talk to you . . . they
HAVE to talk to you. Someday
you might really switch the
channel.
