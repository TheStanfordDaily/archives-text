# 'Illegitimate' Welcomes All
## 
### 
After a successful first year,
the Illegitimate Theater is back
at the Tangent in Palo Alto this
year every Friday and Saturday
evening.
More formal than The Com
mittee of San Francisco fame,
the Illegitimate Theater enter
tains through improvisation.
Half the skits are taken from
audience suggestions. The
troupe is comprised of five
teachers from the Bay Area plus
a secretary.
Shows start at 9 p.m. and
10:30 upstairs, and are enhanced
by the food and beer that are
served. Admission — minus re
freshment—is $1.50 for students,
$2 for others.
Director and co-producer Phil
Shultz, a former Stanford stu
dent, urges that reservations be
made by calling 325-8488.
