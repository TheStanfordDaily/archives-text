# Poloists Fall To Spartans, 9-8; Cal Hits Indian Water Today
## 
### 
San Joee dealt Stanford's wa
ter polo team a surprise 9-8 loss
yesterday afternoon, in Stan
ford's pool. It was a sloppy
game in which five men fouled
out from each team.
San Jose jumped out to a 3-0
first quarter lead, capitalizing
on Stanford miscues. The Spar
tans took the ball five times by
sloughing two men onto the
Stanford ball handler. Stanford
looked stronger after the first
period rockiness, but could not
come back far enough.

Stanford faces a Cal 6quad
this afternoon at 3:30 in the En
cina pool that will play a similar
style game to San Jose. Cal's
Barry Weitzenberg, John Shores,
and Mike Turner played on the
Foothill AC national AAU cham
pion team last summer.
Ken High and Mike Reeder
make the Cal first string a defi
nite obstacle to any opponent.
Stanford coach Jim Gaughran
was severely disappointed with
the Indians' performance yes
terday, but expects a reversal

this afternoon in terms of hus
tle and teamwork.
Pete Ready opened Stanford's
scoring yesterday with a 12 yard
shot in the second quarter, and
tallied another on a fierce back
hand. Luis Nicolao and Greg
Buckingham also hit two apiece.
