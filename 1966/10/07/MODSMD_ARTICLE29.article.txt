# INDIANS SEEK 3RD WIN
## Webfeet Test Stanford 
### RAFAEL PALACIO 
Tomorrow afternoon the Stan
ford Indians travel to Multno
mah Stadium in Portland, Ore
gon, to meet the University of
Oregon Ducks. Off their presea
son games, the Indians appear
to be fairly strong favorites.
1 Oregon has yet to win a game
, in three outings, and overall,
' have a string of five defeats.
The only common opponents
for the Indians and Ducks so
£ far this year has been San Jose
State. The Indians came from
behind to nip the Spartans 25-21,
while just last week, the Spar
tans trounced the Ducks 21-7.
Lack of Punch
The Ducks' problem this year,
has been a lack of scoring
* punch, and inability to move the
ball consistently. Coach Len
Casanova, who is the dean of
the AAWU coaches with 15
; years at Oregon behind him, is
* in a quandary as to who to play
at quarterback.
In co-captains Mike Brundage
and Tom Trovato, Casanova has
two seasoned quarterbacks. But

so far neither of the two has
been able to move the team con
sistently. The man that seems
to be stepping into the top spot
at the position is sophomore
Mike Barnes.
Barnes, who was originally
slated for defensive work, has
really come on strong. He
played a big role in the Ducks'
encounter with San Jose State
last week. As far as Coach
Casanova is concerned, he
doesn't care who plays the slot,
as long as the Ducks start win
ning.
Indians Injured
Though Stanford handled Tu
lane rather easily in last week's
game, the Indians did not escape
unscathed. Mike Hibler and
Marty Brill suffered slight in
juries, and starting linebacker
Mike Pavko appears to be
through for the season, having
suffered a knee injury. A 1 Wil*

burn has also been slowed down
due to a pinched nerve.
All of these injuries are in
the defensive personnel, and
this is where the Indians need
the most help. On the positive
side though, Coach John Ral
ston indicated that he was
pleased with the work of defen
sive tackle Bob Bittner. The Tu
lane game last week, was Bitt
ner's first starting assignment.
As far as the offense is con
cerned, the Indians are not real
ly too worried. With Dave Lew
is at Running back and Gene
Washington at quarterback, the
Indians have scored more than
any other team in the confer
ence. Unfortunately the Indians
have also given up more points
than any other team in the con
ference.
The kicking game will un
doubtedly play a big part in
Coach Ralston's strategy for the

rest of the season, and may play
a part tomorrow. Sophomore
Bill Shoemaker booted 4 field
goals last week against Tulane,
and should be ready for another
good day.
Besides being a kicker, Shoe
maker is a fine runner, with
good speed and power. As of
now, Shoemaker has been run
ning back kickofifs, and has
worked out. at the fullback and
halfback positions. But he may
get a crack at playing flanker
back, if Bob Blunt, who suffered
a slight injury last week, is un
able to go.
Indians Should Win
All in all, it looks a 6 if the
Indians should readily handle
the Ducks. Stanford has the
power up front, the good speed
in the backfield, and a strong
defense. The pass defense is still
weak in spots, but should be
adequate.

in the backfield, and a strong
defense. The pass defense is still
weak in spots, but should be
adequate.
Tomorrow afternoon the Stan
ford Indians travel to Multno
mah Stadium in Portland, Ore
gon, to meet the University of
Oregon Ducks. Off their presea
son games, the Indians appear
to be fairly strong favorites.
1 Oregon has yet to win a game
, in three outings, and overall,
' have a string of five defeats.
The only common opponents
for the Indians and Ducks so
£ far this year has been San Jose
State. The Indians came from
behind to nip the Spartans 25-21,
while just last week, the Spar
tans trounced the Ducks 21-7.
Lack of Punch
The Ducks' problem this year,
has been a lack of scoring
* punch, and inability to move the
ball consistently. Coach Len
Casanova, who is the dean of
the AAWU coaches with 15
; years at Oregon behind him, is
* in a quandary as to who to play
at quarterback.
In co-captains Mike Brundage
and Tom Trovato, Casanova has
two seasoned quarterbacks. But

so far neither of the two has
been able to move the team con
sistently. The man that seems
to be stepping into the top spot
at the position is sophomore
Mike Barnes.
Barnes, who was originally
slated for defensive work, has
really come on strong. He
played a big role in the Ducks'
encounter with San Jose State
last week. As far as Coach
Casanova is concerned, he
doesn't care who plays the slot,
as long as the Ducks start win
ning.
Indians Injured
Though Stanford handled Tu
lane rather easily in last week's
game, the Indians did not escape
unscathed. Mike Hibler and
Marty Brill suffered slight in
juries, and starting linebacker
Mike Pavko appears to be
through for the season, having
suffered a knee injury. A 1 Wil*

burn has also been slowed down
due to a pinched nerve.
All of these injuries are in
the defensive personnel, and
this is where the Indians need
the most help. On the positive
side though, Coach John Ral
ston indicated that he was
pleased with the work of defen
sive tackle Bob Bittner. The Tu
lane game last week, was Bitt
ner's first starting assignment.
As far as the offense is con
cerned, the Indians are not real
ly too worried. With Dave Lew
is at Running back and Gene
Washington at quarterback, the
Indians have scored more than
any other team in the confer
ence. Unfortunately the Indians
have also given up more points
than any other team in the con
ference.
The kicking game will un
doubtedly play a big part in
Coach Ralston's strategy for the

rest of the season, and may play
a part tomorrow. Sophomore
Bill Shoemaker booted 4 field
goals last week against Tulane,
and should be ready for another
good day.
Besides being a kicker, Shoe
maker is a fine runner, with
good speed and power. As of
now, Shoemaker has been run
ning back kickofifs, and has
worked out. at the fullback and
halfback positions. But he may
get a crack at playing flanker
back, if Bob Blunt, who suffered
a slight injury last week, is un
able to go.
Indians Should Win
All in all, it looks a 6 if the
Indians should readily handle
the Ducks. Stanford has the
power up front, the good speed
in the backfield, and a strong
defense. The pass defense is still
weak in spots, but should be
adequate.
