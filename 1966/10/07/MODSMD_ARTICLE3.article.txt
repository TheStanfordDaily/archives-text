# City Turns Down Hospital Sale; Parties To Proceed Separately
## 
### MARTHA HUMPHREY 
Palo Alto-Stanford Hospital will
continue under joint ownership, the
Palo Alto City Council decided unani
mously Monday night.
As a result, the University plans to
begin work on an addition to the hos
pital.
"We hope to move ahead in the con
struction plans with all possible
speed," commented Dr. Robert J.
Glaser, Dean of the Medical School
and Vice-President for Medical Af
fairs. Dr. Glaser headed a previous
report prepared by the medical school
administration and faculty which
stated that Stanford needed to ex
pand their facilities to include 450 to
500 beds.
"In the normal course of events,
we can expect two years of planning
and two years of building before
completion," estimated Kenneth Cuth
bertson, Vice-President in charge of
Finance.
Palo Alto's decision based on the
recommendation of the city's finance
committee marks the death of the
University's original offer of Aug. 8
to buy the city's 35 percent of the
hospital, housed in the Stanford Med
ical Center. The committee's sugges
tion was based on the advantages that
the Stanford Medical School facilities
offer the community.
"What we had hoped to work out
simply isn't going to," commented
Cuthbertson. "We're confident that
we can plan around the situation."
With refusal of the sale anticipated,
expansion plans were outlined in the
August request made to Palo Alto by
President J. E. Wallace Sterling.
"We had to assume that the city
might wish to stay where it is," ex
plained Cuthbertson.

The city owns one wing of the hos
pital complex and has access to both
laboratory and operating facilities.
Governing the hospital is a 12 mem
ber Board of Trustees, to which the
University and the city each appoint
six persons.

The plans for the addition are not
yet finalized. "The problem now fac
ing us is determining what kind of
agreement we will need to have with
the city to function separately," Cuth
bertson said.
