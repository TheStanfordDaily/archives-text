# Harriers Face Stiff Trial In Invitational
## 
### 
The cross-country squad, which
this year will undergo another
rebuilding season according to
Coach Jerry Barland, journeys
to the Sacramento Invitational
this weekend.
Last year the frosh finished
first in the Invitational, and
Coach Barland looks for this
year's frosh squad to success
fully defend their title.
Though the varsity squad did
not do as well as expected last
year, Barland thinks that this
year's squad has improved
enough to move well up the lad
der, and perhaps come close to
winning.
In sizing up both teams, Bar
land admits that both squads
lack a real top-notch runner,
but says that the close groupings
of the runners should produce
good results in team competi
tion.
