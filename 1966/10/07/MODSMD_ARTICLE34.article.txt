# Green Wave Hits Red Breakwater
## 
### 

Tom Hazelrlgg, Marty Brill, Mike Ilibler, Blaine
Nye, Monty Mohrman, et al pour over the Tulane
offense like a red wave. So far this year, Stanford's
rush defense is ranked second in the AAWU. The
Indians' tough defensive wall will be on display
tomorrow afternoon against the winless Oregon
Ducks.
