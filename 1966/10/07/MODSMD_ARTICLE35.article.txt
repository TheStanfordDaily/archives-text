# What's Up Front That Counts; Stanford's Front Five Have It
## 
### ART SNYDER 
Yes, sport's fans, it's another
Saturday afternoon, the sun's
blistering, and everyone down
on the farm is out for their
weekly sun burn. Everything
seems typical—the teams line
up, Shoemaker takes the open
ing kick-off and returns it to the
Stanford 22 amid the screams of
26,000 fans. Two plays later
Washington fumbles on his own
30 and the crowd begins to mum
ble. "Here we go again, fum
bling, stumbling, bungling." But
wait — something is different.
Yes, the defense intercepts 2
plays later, and after an ex
change of punts Lewis punches
off right tackle and scampers 90
yards for a TD.
What was the change? How
did the team undergo such a
metamorphosis? Well, perhaps
it was only hard work, but one
can honestly say that for the
first time this year Stanford was
a "team," and not a bunch of
individuals.
Line Stars
Sure there were "stars" —
Shoemaker's toe, Washington's
alert and well-balanced running
and passing, and Root and
Lewis' steady sharp running.
But the unglamorized stars of
Saturday's game against Tulane
were the men up front. Both
offensive line units jarred the
Tulane defense with huge hole^.
And the unit that happened t'
break Lewis open for his 90
yard TD gallop consisted mostl
of sophomores, thus indicating
the depth of the Stanford of
fensive line and the drive an'
determination of the younge:
members of the varsity squad.
Young Standouts
Soph. Bob Shore (LT), Sr.
Larry Volmert (LG), Sr. Tim
Sheehan (C), Soph. Phil Messer
(RG), and Soph. Mai Snider
(RT) have tremendous inter
squad competition and spirt with

Soph. George Buehler (LT), Sr.
Rick Derby (LG), Jr. Jim Mills
(C), Jr. Don Swart/ (RG), and
Jr. Brad Stark (RT).
Against Tulane both of these
units amassed a total of 434
yards rushing, not to mention a
524 yard total offense, which
was better than almost all other
collegiate teams in the nation.
Defensively, though giving up
14 points, Stanford held the
Green Wave to 175 yards rush
ing. These aren't the best defen
sive statistics in the world, but
the Tribes" defense finally jelled.
Mike Hibler, still suffering
from his injured knee, loosened
up somewhat and regained some
of the lateral movement that

made him such a standout last
year. He also led in the tackle.'
department with a total of 14.
Linebacker Marty Brill also to
taled 14 tackles.
The interesting thing about the"
tackle statistics is that they: arc
well distributed. Eight of the;
Tribe's defense totaled 7 tackles;
or more. Blaine Nye totaled 13,"
and Donn Renwick totaled 11
while making one of the game's!
key interceptions.
Most of the tackles werp '
sists, exhibiting much better pur-'
suit and "over-lap" than had!
been seen all season. And it's ef- J
forts like this that will beat the;
big names from the smog coun-*
try—USC and UCLA.
