"A dozen or fifteen years ago, business edu
cation was the resetless, uncertain giant of
higher education," James Howell, Associate
Dean of the Stanford Business School recently
commented. Nearly one fifth of all male college
graduates were earning their degrees in business
administrat'on, and yet academmically business
administration ranked "just about at the bottom
of the hierarchy within the university."
The subsequent revolution in business educa
tion has been an important part in the devel
opment of American universities. And Stan
ford's Graduate School of Business has played a
progressive role in shaping that revolution. The
new $5.5 million business school, which is being
dedicated this afternoon by Secretary of Health,
Education and Welfare John Gardner, is only a
symbol of the changes at Stanford.
When Dean Ernest Arbuckle came to Stan
ford in 1958, he found "quite a gulf" between
the Graduate School of Business and the aca
demic disciplines and some thinking in the
minds of University faculty that "business edu
cation was not entirely respectable." The devel
opment of the School during Arbuckle's tenure
has changed those views considerably.
The faculty of the School has been increased
by two-thirds and other departments of the Uni
versity are seeking to take advantage of the
School's distinguished faculty through joint ap
pointments in such areas as economics and
psychology. Enrollment has grown from 400 to
750, and the number of doctoral candidates has
trebled. The large percentage of students with

liberal arts backgrounds underlines the School's
awareness of society's need for men of action
as well as men of ideas, and that a businessman
must be both.
Behind the statistical advances, the School
has also seen a change in the type of student:
smarter and more concerned with society. Ar
buckle observes that today's business student,
much like his undergraduate counterpart, wants
"the assurance of important, meaningful work"
and"the ability to maintain his individuality
and integrity" in his career.
When preparations were being made for the
opening of the Business School in 1925, Herbert
Hoover declared that a business school could
succeed only to the extent that it found com
mon cooperation with the business community.
The School has enjoyed "constructive collabora
tion" between the academic and business worlds
through study projects and working contact
with various companies. In fact the business
community has supplied several outstanding
including Dean Arbuckle. However
the School has been quick to demand that its
relationship with business be free from pressure
and infringement of academic freedom.
American business is facing a society whose
problems are rapidly increasing in complexity
and whose young leaders place great value upon
the individual. We hope that the Graduate
School of Business will continue to serve so
ciety with graduates who possess the leadership
and understanding to meet the problems of a
growing America.

"the assurance of important, meaningful work"
and"the ability to maintain his individuality
and integrity" in his career.
When preparations were being made for the
opening of the Business School in 1925, Herbert
Hoover declared that a business school could
succeed only to the extent that it found com
mon cooperation with the business community.
The School has enjoyed "constructive collabora
tion" between the academic and business worlds
through study projects and working contact
with various companies. In fact the business
community has supplied several outstanding
including Dean Arbuckle. However
the School has been quick to demand that its
relationship with business be free from pressure
and infringement of academic freedom.
American business is facing a society whose
problems are rapidly increasing in complexity
and whose young leaders place great value upon
the individual. We hope that the Graduate
School of Business will continue to serve so
ciety with graduates who possess the leadership
and understanding to meet the problems of a
growing America.
"A dozen or fifteen years ago, business edu
cation was the resetless, uncertain giant of
higher education," James Howell, Associate
Dean of the Stanford Business School recently
commented. Nearly one fifth of all male college
graduates were earning their degrees in business
administrat'on, and yet academmically business
administration ranked "just about at the bottom
of the hierarchy within the university."
The subsequent revolution in business educa
tion has been an important part in the devel
opment of American universities. And Stan
ford's Graduate School of Business has played a
progressive role in shaping that revolution. The
new $5.5 million business school, which is being
dedicated this afternoon by Secretary of Health,
Education and Welfare John Gardner, is only a
symbol of the changes at Stanford.
When Dean Ernest Arbuckle came to Stan
ford in 1958, he found "quite a gulf" between
the Graduate School of Business and the aca
demic disciplines and some thinking in the
minds of University faculty that "business edu
cation was not entirely respectable." The devel
opment of the School during Arbuckle's tenure
has changed those views considerably.
The faculty of the School has been increased
by two-thirds and other departments of the Uni
versity are seeking to take advantage of the
School's distinguished faculty through joint ap
pointments in such areas as economics and
psychology. Enrollment has grown from 400 to
750, and the number of doctoral candidates has
trebled. The large percentage of students with

liberal arts backgrounds underlines the School's
awareness of society's need for men of action
as well as men of ideas, and that a businessman
must be both.
Behind the statistical advances, the School
has also seen a change in the type of student:
smarter and more concerned with society. Ar
buckle observes that today's business student,
much like his undergraduate counterpart, wants
"the assurance of important, meaningful work"
and"the ability to maintain his individuality
and integrity" in his career.
