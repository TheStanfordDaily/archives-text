## Cal Tech's Pass-Fail System Reduces Frosh Year Wrecks 
### Tim Haight 
This fall, the California In
stitute of Technology starts Its
third ungraded freshman year.
The program has been so suc
cessful that last year it was
voted in "permanently" by the
California Institute of Technolo
gy faculty.
According to Foster Strong,
Dean of Freshmen and Profes
sor of Physics at CalTech, al
most every result of the pro
gram recommended its perma
nent establishment. The cry
around campus, he said, is, "My
God! They're reading books
again."
As sophomores, the students
who had participated in the first
ungraded freshman year made
better grades than the usual
sophomore average. The aver
age was .1 better in the fall and
winter quarters and the same in
the spring.
More Confident

Further, when the upperclass
men at CalTech were called to
assess the interest, confidence,
and competence of the ungraded
freshmen, they replied that the
pass-fail students were more in-'
terested and confident. They also
said that (he students held at
least as good a basic knowledge
as the upperclassmen said they
had had.
The students who participated
in the program have been polled
as well, and they have over
whelmingly endorsed the pro
gram. They felt that the pass
fail system reduced the pressure
and competition and gave them a
chance to explore fields of in
terest.
The rate of attrition during

the freshman year dropped dur
ing the pass-fail period. There
were less failures, and drop-outs
for non-academic reasons de
clined.
One problem the faculty con
sidered before adopting the ex
perimental program was the ef
fect of the system on graduate
school admissions. After polling
a number of "good" graduate
schools, the Committee on the
Freshman Year found that the
freshman grades were not im
portant. Performance in upper
division major courses seemed
to be the main criterion.

"Pass" was defined as "D" or
above, but Dr. Strong mentioned
that in reality "curve" grading
disappeared almost entirely. The
change wasn't simply that a pro
fessor drew up his curve and
labelled "A" through "D" "pass"
and the rest "fail." It was ap
parently easy to tell who was
not doing the work when the end
of the year came around. The
students who were going to fail
usually knew so themselves, in
fact. It was therefore a simple

matter to fail the failures and
pass the rest.
Individual examinations and
papers were still graded — not
with letter grades but with num
bers for right-and-wrong or ex
tensive comments on the papers.
This allowed the students to
know how they were doing with
out making them wonder how
the final grade would turn out.
Some students, of course, did
tend to "ease off" in their studies,
but the majority of them used
this time in very productive
ways. A small minority did not
and were a cause for concern,
but a study of predicted grade
point averages put this fear to
rest.

Although CalTech does not
use predicted GPA's in its ad
missions procedure any more,
the committee computed such
figures for the study. According
to Dr. Strong, all the serious
cases of slacking off came from
the bottom of this ranking. At
the top of the ranking students
were doing more and better
work than before.

pass-fail students were more in-'
terested and confident. They also
said that (he students held at
least as good a basic knowledge
as the upperclassmen said they
had had.
The students who participated
in the program have been polled
as well, and they have over
whelmingly endorsed the pro
gram. They felt that the pass
fail system reduced the pressure
and competition and gave them a
chance to explore fields of in
terest.
The rate of attrition during

the freshman year dropped dur
ing the pass-fail period. There
were less failures, and drop-outs
for non-academic reasons de
clined.
One problem the faculty con
sidered before adopting the ex
perimental program was the ef
fect of the system on graduate
school admissions. After polling
a number of "good" graduate
schools, the Committee on the
Freshman Year found that the
freshman grades were not im
portant. Performance in upper
division major courses seemed
to be the main criterion.

"Pass" was defined as "D" or
above, but Dr. Strong mentioned
that in reality "curve" grading
disappeared almost entirely. The
change wasn't simply that a pro
fessor drew up his curve and
labelled "A" through "D" "pass"
and the rest "fail." It was ap
parently easy to tell who was
not doing the work when the end
of the year came around. The
students who were going to fail
usually knew so themselves, in
fact. It was therefore a simple

matter to fail the failures and
pass the rest.
Individual examinations and
papers were still graded — not
with letter grades but with num
bers for right-and-wrong or ex
tensive comments on the papers.
This allowed the students to
know how they were doing with
out making them wonder how
the final grade would turn out.
Some students, of course, did
tend to "ease off" in their studies,
but the majority of them used
this time in very productive
ways. A small minority did not
and were a cause for concern,
but a study of predicted grade
point averages put this fear to
rest.

Although CalTech does not
use predicted GPA's in its ad
missions procedure any more,
the committee computed such
figures for the study. According
to Dr. Strong, all the serious
cases of slacking off came from
the bottom of this ranking. At
the top of the ranking students
were doing more and better
work than before.
This fall, the California In
stitute of Technology starts Its
third ungraded freshman year.
The program has been so suc
cessful that last year it was
voted in "permanently" by the
California Institute of Technolo
gy faculty.
According to Foster Strong,
Dean of Freshmen and Profes
sor of Physics at CalTech, al
most every result of the pro
gram recommended its perma
nent establishment. The cry
around campus, he said, is, "My
God! They're reading books
again."
As sophomores, the students
who had participated in the first
ungraded freshman year made
better grades than the usual
sophomore average. The aver
age was .1 better in the fall and
winter quarters and the same in
the spring.

Further, when the upperclass
men at CalTech were called to
assess the interest, confidence,
