# Harris Clashes With Roster Over Need For Administrative Control
## 
### GAIL ANDERSON 
Student Body President Dave Har
ris and Stanford Today and To
morrow Chairman Mike Roster ex
pressed disagreement over the stu
dent role in the University decision
making process at an informal dis
cussion in Roble last night.
Harris contended that those who
determine policy should be the in
dividuals or groups directly affected,
and that "administrators should ad
ministrate." Roster supported admin
istrative controls and guidelines,
stressing that students could easily
change them in the present system.
Speaking first, Harris submitted
that "The real question in education
is how each of us singularly is going
to relate to the university."
"Education is in each of your
minds," he stated. He presented the
purpose of the university as "to build
an atmosphere in which minds can
develop freely."
Harris' basic thesis was each in
dividual mind's right to make deci
sions about its own life. Education
consists in choices, he contended; if
the university is to mean anything,
it must be in allowing decision-mak
ing.
The problem with the modern uni
versity, Harris stated is its paternal
attitude toward the student in allow
ing only limited decision-making and
mock government. "The university,"
he illustrated, "allows students to
make decisions in about the same
way that Boys' State allows them to
run the government."
The university atmosphere condi
tions the student to an attitude of
dependence, he continued, convincing
them that they are not capable of
making their own decisions. "Educa
tion begins with dignity," he said,
adding that the present situation
tends to keep this dignity suppressed.
Harris called for student support

and participation in their affairs. The
real goal of education, he emphasized,
is to bring home to each student the
issue of his environment and what he
can do to improve it.
Presenting his views on the sub
ject, Roster stated his belief that the
present structure is open to changes
and opportunities. "There are many
ways to structure a university," he
continued, "but administration of the
university must be competent. Per
haps the reason why students are not
in the power structure today is be
cause we have not proven our com
petence."
Creative ideas are necessary to
move the university, Roster contin
ued. "In the past, students have been
ahead of educators in discovering the
problems of education."
Roster contended that student par
ticipation can develop in the present
system. Speaking of student action,
he added that it is better to start with
changes in a particular program than
discussion of general ideas.
In a question-and-answer period
following the speeches. Roster and
Harris disagreed on the role of facul
ty, administration and students in the
power structure. Harris contended
that each constituency should have
sole power of decision over areas con
cerning itself. The role of the admin
istration, he added, should be limited
to actual administrating.
To Roster's reply that policy imple
mentation requires the consent, of all
groups concerned, Harris said that
community could only be built by
equality, not control. He said that the
inequality expressed in administra
tive control denied the spirit of com
munity.
Asked whether students were ma
ture enough to make their own deci
sions, Harris replied that education
begins with the right of decision
making, "You can't build people to

make decisions," he stated, "by not al
lowing them to do so."
Both speakers approached solutions
to specific problems at Stanford, but
from different angles. Harris empha
sized changes within the structure of
the university; Roster preferred
working within established guidelines.
"Structure can be modified with spe
cifics," he said; "from that we devel
op a far more flexible way of educa
tion."
