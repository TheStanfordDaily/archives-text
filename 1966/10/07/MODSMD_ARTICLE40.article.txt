Editor The Dally:
I would like to clarify a cou
ple of things in Jay Bosworth's
Oct. 5 coverage of The Experi
ment's Tuesday night symposi
um on flux and the new student.
First of all, the lead para
graph says that I "parodied
Stanford's awareness of the out
side world . . What I pre
sented in the first part of my
talk was not a parody but a
parable, and I was attempting
not to make fun of the present
day Stanford student's growing
awareness of the relationship
between his university and so
ciety but to see it as an integral
and encouraging aspect of the
student revolution of the sixties.
A little later Jay writes that,
in describing today's student
revolution, I say that one of its
aspects is "rebellion again6t all
authority figures and an at
tempt to grasp freedom auto
logically." I have no idea what
Jay thought I was trying to say
since there is no such word as
"autologically." I said "an at
tempt to grasp freedom ontolog
ically (which may not make any
more sense, but "ontologically"
at least is a word).
On the whole, I feel that any
one who read Jay's account and
who did not attend the sympo
sium could have little or no un
derstanding of what I and the
other two speakers were trying
to say and do.
On behalf of those who
worked this summer to move
The Experiment from idea to
reality, I wish to thank The
Daily for the amount of space
it has devoted to our initial ef
forts. On the other hand, I hope
that coverage of our future
events will be more accurate.

• Prof Bucks Buckley
Editor, The Dally:
Yesterday Buckley settled the
hash of Reston, Lippmann, Mc-
Donald and Schlesigner ("glosso
lalia"). Today he put Einstein
in his place. Buckley (like his de
ceased friend even better now)
knows who made the cosmos
which Einstein could merely de
scribe. There's nothing like hav
ing the right connections: God,
the in-bunch at Yale, the yacht
ing crowd, etc. Then, all you

have to do is dive off your yacht
in a squall or put your family
plane into a spin. . . . This can
put you in the company of
Michelangelo, Hugo, Jefferson
and Churchill—with luck, rather
quickly. Another good way is to
risk all in an atomic showdown:
the only important thing, as Ike
says, is to win. Lust for life?
Some, hopefully hung up on
their morality, will smell an un
bearable stench, the fast-spread
ing fumes of "necrophilia" (Ful
bright).
Seriously, it is ovbious that
a willingness to risk, including
one's life, is essential to living—
though some are less flamboy
ant about it than others—and
this extends at times to gratui
tous risk, the lark. But what
separates men like Jefferson and
Michelangelo (and also some in
valids who took their risks in a
room, like Proust) from charm
ing boys like Skakel is a subtle
instinct for survival, perhaps out
of a generous concern for others
or curiosity about what can be
made out of this one-time op
portunity.
Whatever smacks of trickery
—or unfair luck—in this is ex
piated by the harsh concerns of
talent or genius or "just going
on" (Camus), by years of hard
work in relative anonymity.
Buckley has clearly mastered
the subtle trickery part: all he
needs to do now is retire to his
Hudson Valley mansion for, say,
twenty years and do some real
thinking and work—maybe paint
the ceiling. A Michaelangelo he
probably won't be, but at least
something more than a witty,
publicity-seeking performer.

• A New FSM?
Editor, The Daily:
Stanford has at last wrested
the leadership of the Free
Speech movement away from
our rivals to the north. Indeed
we have invested it with a new
twist, the Filthy Mind or (a bet
ter title, perhaps) the New Cen
sorship.
The Sunday Night Flicks was
the perfect place for the unveil
ing, a fine way to link up this
old tradition with the realities
of the new Stanford image. As
I sat there, listening to the banal
ities from the screen being an

swered by the filth from the bal
cony, it did my heart good to
know I was among the van
guard of campus leaders for this
cause, leaders prepared to go to
any length to prevent others
from having to endure the likes
of "The Moon Is Blue."
Soon, if all goes well, we will
attract the attention of Time,
and the "newest" campus wis
dom, the Filthy Mind, will pre
vail. Campus "censors," shovel
ing load after load of dirt from
their burdened minds, will be
placed in power everywhere to
judge the unworthy and drown
out the bad with the worst ob
senities and loudest knowing
laughs.
Although it will take other top
schools some doing to beat the
record established Sunday night
of two hours straight worth of
leering material in a single
movie, we must not rest on our
laurels. Perhaps the powers that
be will see fit to offer us a double
feature next week so that we
can hone our minds a bit more.
But, pray, make it a bit more
difficult. We may one day be
forced to defend our title by
finding double meanings and
suggestive acts in an old Ma
and Pa Kettle movie!
In the interest of a swinging,
groovy campus.

Editor, The Daily:
Your headline of Tuesday,

Oct. 4 (McCarthyites Forced to
Subpoena Names) gives a new
meaning to the term "responsi
ble journalism."

• Eye Witness
Editor, The Dally:
As an intern in a Congres
sional office this summer in
Washington I was afforded the
opportunity to witness several
of the HUAC hearings. Mr. An
ton was indeed subpoenaed and
appeared before the committee,
and as he stated yesterday, he
was not sworn in. The reason
he was not sworn in was readily
apparent to those in the hearing
room.
As previous witnesses before
him, Mr. Anton lowered himself
to the level of HUAC itself (no
moan trick) and in the process
did a great disservice to the le
gitimate causes he purports to
represent. Fortunately for those
who are concerned about the
situation in Vietnam and about
the irresponsible and dangerous
actions of HUAC, Mr. Aanton
was followed by another Stan
ford student Stuart Macßae,
who, while showing his disgust
with the committee, did not
stoop, to the childish and redicu
lous behavior of those who pre
ceded him. His performance as
a witness was a credit to him
self and to others who share his
beliefs.
