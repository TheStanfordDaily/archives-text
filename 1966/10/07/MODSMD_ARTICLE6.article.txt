# THE 						OBSERVER
## In Depth-Monthly 
### KIRK HANSON Managing Editor 
The Stanford Observer, a new
monthly newspaper published by the
News and Publications Service,
makes its second trial appearance to
day, designed to present "the Univer
sity in action, with all its diversity
and depth, its aspiration and achieve
ment, its controversy and change."
The Observer originated late last
spring in the midst of outside pub
licity the University felt was some
what less than favorable. Observer
Editor Harry Press, former City edi
tor of the San Francisco News-Call
Bulletin, a Stanford graduate, and a
Neiman Fellow, told The Daily last
night "the Univereity felt a great
need for broader communication be
tween the entire University commu
nity: alumni, parents, and friends."
An example of an unfortunate dis
tortion of the news, according to
Press, was the recent San Francisco
Chronicle article on Dave Harris. He
told the Summer Weekly in July that
is was "inaccurate" and "slanted."
He said that the University took a
"long look at itself" and felt the true
story was not "really being told." The
idea for a monthly newspaper was
originated by Robert Pierce, head of
the Alumni Association. It received
approval from the Board of Trustees
and is paid for from general Univer
sity funds.
Only two days ago, the decision to
publish the Observer throughout this
year was made. It will appear month
ly through June and after a long
range study of its effects, the future
of the Observer and other alumni
publications will be decided.
Editor Press was insistent that the
Observer did not intend in any way
to compete with the Daily or Stan
ford Today. He said the Observer is a
monthly newspaper and will remain

so, taking no editorial viewpoint and
will always seek to present "the news
in depth."
Press further said there were vari
ous publications such as Stanford To
day, Alumni Almanac, and the Alum
ni Review all of which did a specific
job but none of which did the job a
monthly newspaper could do." The
first issue was published in June af
ter spring quarter had ended and was
mailed to all alumni, parents, and
friends of the University. Press re
ported yesterday that the reaction to
the pilot pdition was almost unani
mously favorable.
This month's issue, which is being
distributed to students at noon today
in the regular Daily distribution
points is an eight page presentation,
and like the first, attempts to present
in-depth coverage of recent campus
news. It has a circulation of 105,000,
again being mailed to all alumni, par
ents and friends of the University.
The new issue features a review of
Stanford Community Service and a
photo presentation of the "class of
1970." It also includes extensive re
marks from the Leadership Confer
ence held two weeks ago and entitled
"What is Happening at Stanford."
Large excerpts from the speeches
given to the freshman during Pre-
Reg week are another highlight.
The first edition in June featured
a two page report on Stanford activ
ism, including "The Case History of
a Campus Sit-in." Dan Endsley, Edi
tor of the Stanford Review and the
Alumni Almanac, wrote a special fea
ture story on the new student body
president entitled "A Discussion with
David Harris."
The October edition uses a slightly
different style of makeup than did the
pilot edition in June. Editor Press said
it makes the edition much more read
able and clear.

Observer did not intend in any way
to compete with the Daily or Stan
ford Today. He said the Observer is a
monthly newspaper and will remain

so, taking no editorial viewpoint and
will always seek to present "the news
in depth."
Press further said there were vari
ous publications such as Stanford To
day, Alumni Almanac, and the Alum
ni Review all of which did a specific
job but none of which did the job a
monthly newspaper could do." The
first issue was published in June af
ter spring quarter had ended and was
mailed to all alumni, parents, and
friends of the University. Press re
ported yesterday that the reaction to
the pilot pdition was almost unani
mously favorable.
This month's issue, which is being
distributed to students at noon today
in the regular Daily distribution
points is an eight page presentation,
and like the first, attempts to present
in-depth coverage of recent campus
news. It has a circulation of 105,000,
again being mailed to all alumni, par
ents and friends of the University.
The new issue features a review of
Stanford Community Service and a
photo presentation of the "class of
1970." It also includes extensive re
marks from the Leadership Confer
ence held two weeks ago and entitled
"What is Happening at Stanford."
Large excerpts from the speeches
given to the freshman during Pre-
Reg week are another highlight.
The first edition in June featured
a two page report on Stanford activ
ism, including "The Case History of
a Campus Sit-in." Dan Endsley, Edi
tor of the Stanford Review and the
Alumni Almanac, wrote a special fea
ture story on the new student body
president entitled "A Discussion with
David Harris."
The October edition uses a slightly
different style of makeup than did the
pilot edition in June. Editor Press said
it makes the edition much more read
able and clear.
The Stanford Observer, a new
monthly newspaper published by the
News and Publications Service,
makes its second trial appearance to
day, designed to present "the Univer
sity in action, with all its diversity
and depth, its aspiration and achieve
ment, its controversy and change."
The Observer originated late last
spring in the midst of outside pub
licity the University felt was some
what less than favorable. Observer
Editor Harry Press, former City edi
tor of the San Francisco News-Call
Bulletin, a Stanford graduate, and a
Neiman Fellow, told The Daily last
night "the Univereity felt a great
need for broader communication be
tween the entire University commu
nity: alumni, parents, and friends."
An example of an unfortunate dis
tortion of the news, according to
Press, was the recent San Francisco
Chronicle article on Dave Harris. He
told the Summer Weekly in July that
is was "inaccurate" and "slanted."
He said that the University took a
"long look at itself" and felt the true
story was not "really being told." The
idea for a monthly newspaper was
originated by Robert Pierce, head of
the Alumni Association. It received
approval from the Board of Trustees
and is paid for from general Univer
sity funds.
Only two days ago, the decision to
publish the Observer throughout this
year was made. It will appear month
ly through June and after a long
range study of its effects, the future
of the Observer and other alumni
publications will be decided.
