Jfiig Big Game period, Mr. Fin
deisen said, "Taking the test is
'frnportant for everyone who
Hrtmts a deferment. It can't hurt,
but it can help a lot."
The University Testing and
Counciling Service expects about

1,500 students will take the tests.
This would be 3,500 less than
last year. This drop is due to
the one-test-to-a-student policy of
the Selective Service. Most stu
dents from 18 to 26 took it last
year, leaving mainly the new
crop of 18 year-olds.
Protest marked the adminis
tration of the tests at Stanford
last year. During the summer,
the Academic Committee of the
University debated whether to
continue them this year. Mr.
Findeisen said the administra
tion could not predict if there
would be protests this year. If
there are any they are expected
to be mild.
Sample results of last year's
tests show that 81 per cent got
a passing score of 70 or hstter
Of the high school seniois who
took the test, 68 per cent got 70
or above. College freshmen did
better, 80 per cent scoring over
70.
