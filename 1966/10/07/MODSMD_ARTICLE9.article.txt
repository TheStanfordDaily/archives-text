"We continue to be deeply im
pressed with both the high cali
ber and the effectiveness of the
Hoover Institution. It is an intel
lectual resource greatly in need
today and thus a most fitting me
morial to its founder, former
President Herbert Hoover."
Since its establishment by Mr.
Hoover in 1919 as a center for
documentation of World War I,
the Institution has become both
a major research library and an
internationally-known center for
advanced study and scholarly
publication on political, econom
ic and social change in the 20th
century.
Dr.' Campbell paid tribute to
the Scaife family as "the cata
lytic agent for a great increase
in both the magnitude and the
effectiveness of our research and
publication programs" over the
past three years.
