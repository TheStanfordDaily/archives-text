# Harris Offers Opinions On Student Initiative
## 
### JAMES B. BRISCOE 
"Hectic."
That's how Dave Harris, ASSU
President and, in the opinion of some
alumni and perhaps a few administra
tors, arch-villain-on-campus, describes
his first three weeks in office.
For Harris is presently engaged in
trying to implement some of the pro
grams he proposed last year; pro
grams that brought loud cries of "im
practical" and "unworkable" from the
grandstands.
And he's going about it in a new
way.
"We're trying to involve the whole
student community, rather than hav
ing a few people playing power poli
tics," he says.
No Crusader
"Because I don't see myself as a
great organizer, going around leading
all the crusades, my job should be
more of an 'input' of ideas and sug
gestions.
"The petition on women's living re
strictions is a good example of people
getting out and helping themselves,"
he notes.

But there are plenty of problems,
none-the-less.
"One of the big difficulties right
now is creating a feeling of equality
of the students with the rest of the
members of the University commu
nity: the faculty and the administra
tors," Harris observes.
"Student problems are as real as
any; problems like student jobs for
example. One student came in last
week and told me he lost his student
job in Encina because some paper
shuffler decided it wasn't needed any
longer. These are the kinds of prob
lems that should be discussed at the
student level."
Outspoken Manner
There has been speculation that Har
ris' outspoken manner he reacted to
his appointment to the planning com
mittee on educational reforms last
week by noting that there was a sig
nificant lack of students besides him
self on it—would impair his relations
with the administration and particu
larly hinder communication between
Pres. Wallace Sterling and himself.
But Harris brushes off this worry.

"A lot of people thought what was
done last year—liquor and religion
and so forth—was done by talking to
Dr. Sterling. But there have to be a
lot of other things. In fact, sometimes
talking to Dr. Sterling has very little
to do with it.
"The important thing is to be in a
position of strength, to have the stu
dents and particularly the faculty be
hind you. Then you can talk to Dr.
Sterling."
Advisory Committee
Harris also doubts the value of the
Student Advisory Committee, of which
he is a member. The committee, com
posed of student leaders, is appointed
by Dr. Sterling to advise him on stu
dent questions. The committee meet
ings are considered confidential, how
ever, and the students involved are
asked not to discuss the proceedings
outside the committee.
"We should be ready to abondon
[the committee] if the talk is only
going to be in private," Harris says.
"There is already too much private
talk about the University going on be
hind closed committee doors, it's about

time for some of it to be made public.
Harris realizes that some of his
plans are going to have tough sled
ding. The ASSU Coffee House, for
which he is pressing very strongly, is
already the center of a growing con
troversy between the ASSU and the
Dean's Office, and for some of his
other programs, like the autonomous
"community of scholars" even the
starting point is not yet in sight.
With an almost imperceptible
chuckle, he notes, "I have a certain
tragic view of the role of students in
the university. I don't think there can
be real cooperation between the stu
dents and the other segments of the

community as long as students are
considered second-class citizens; as
long as we are appointed by others to
their committees. There can only be
cooperation among equals."
Student Coops
However, Harris sees many proj
ects in which students can work to
gether without involving administra
tor at all.
Heading his list are student run
cooperative stores, selling clothes,
food, school supplies, even books.
"I see no reason why we shouldn't
complete with the bookstore, if we
can sell more cheaply than they," he
noted.
"Students take it in the ear right
now, both inside the University and
outside, because of extremely high
overhead costs," he opines.
"All we need to get started is some
land on which to erect temporary
buildings, and the University certainly
has plenty of unused land," he added,
"for that matter, we could even set up
a flea market of tents on the Tresidder
Patio. In fact, if nothing else is avail

able, I'll even move out of my office
and let that be used."
Aud Dorms?
Although the idea sounds a little
fantastic, Harris doesn't rule out the
possibility of student run coop dorms
some day.
"We can certainly build dorms that
will rent for less than the University
now charges," he maintains. "Present
ly more than half of a student's room
and board bill goes for overhead and
interest."
"Our dorms might not be quite as
fancy," Harris adds, "but they'll sure
rent for a lot less. I don't think rugs
in the hall are really that important
when you consider how much they
cost, both to install, and maintain."
Nodding agreement with himself,
he continues, "the possibilities are
endless. Of course all this won't come
to pass this year, but we can make
a start."
And this "start" may indeed be
enough to justify the wide-spread
speculation that this will be 'a most
interesting year."

Any students interested In help
ing set up and/or running student
cooperative stores, selling food,
clothing and school supplies are
asked to contact the ASSU offices.
Suggestions and ideas are also
welcome.
