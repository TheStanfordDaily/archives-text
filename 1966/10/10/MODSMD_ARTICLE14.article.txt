# 'Year Of Change' To Put World Under Microscope
## 
### 
Sunday, November 6, at 4:00
p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditorium,
will mark the beginning of The
Year of Change, a program de
signed to help people under
stand themselves and the prob
lems they face.
The Year of Change will ex
amine the changes taking place
in our society and specifically
at Stanford. It will be a change
in itself in bringing together
students, faculty ,and adminis
tration members in a personal,
face-to-face manner.
Last year an ad hoc group of
students, concerned with the
seeming lack of understanding
on this campus and in the world
in general, sponsored two sym
posia—"A Deeper Look at Our
selves" last January and "A
Deeper Look at Education" in
April. This Symposium Commit
tee, now a part of the Student-
Faculty Board, hopes to move
the focus of the program to
even broader areas.
Confusing Challenge
This quarter the program will
attempt to examine the problem
which challenge and conluse us
and are increasing at an expo
nential rate while our under
standing of them is not.
The increasing number of peo
ple seems to be breeding a situa
tion in which there are more
and more people, but no one
knows anyone else. To cope with
this, people are generating new
modes of action based upon new
value systems to give them ar
identity in a system trying tr
drown them.
Conservative political candi
dates and "Little Old Ladies" arr
prone to talk about our "mora"
decay," and they are usuallj
scoffed at. Yet it's sobering to
realize that no domocracy in his
tory has lasted more than two
hundred years, all falling bo

cause of some form of internal
decay. Our time is up in ten
years.
Total Involvement
On campus, there seems ♦ *
exist a triplarity between stu
dents, faculty, and administra
tion. Each group is dedicated to
the same end—the continuation
and increase of knowledge and
understanding—but often each
group cannot understand the
role or duties of the others.
The symposia will follow the
successful format used last year
and adopted by the Freshman
Hostel held during Pre-Reg. The
Autumn segment, entitled "The
Challenge," will begin with a
series of speeches given by
three students and B. Davie Nr
pier, Dean of the Chapel.
After the speeches, the partici
pants will break up into groups
of twelve —five men, five women,
and a faculty or administration
couple—for dinner and a discus
sion at the home of the faculty
couple. After this initial mee'
ing of the group, the members
are free to decide the value of
future meetings. In all, fifty fac
ulty and administration couples
and five hundred students will
be involved.
Future Programs
Hopefully, many of the group
will wish to continue their meet
ing with "The Reaction" and
"The Direction" in the Winter
and Spring quarters. Students
will again be given the oppor
tunity to sign up and allowed to
continue with the same group
or change groups along witf
new members. Ftevitt Sanford
has agreed to speak at Winter
Quarter, but the speaker for
Spring Quarter has not yet been
set.
Signups Thru Wednesday
Signups began yesterday and
will continue through Wednei
day, at Tresidder on the front
patio with members of the Sym
posium Committee available to
answer questions. Students will
be around at dinner at all dormi
tories tonight conducting sign
ups. In addition, members of the
organization committee and theti
delegates scattered throughout
most on-campus residences will
conduct signups.
The Year of Change will be a
beginning to understanding be
tween students, faculty, and ad
ministration as to problems
which they individually and col
lectively face.
