one which he hopes can be some
how passed on to the Stanford
student body.
■ v ii The guard wore brown uni
forms with Dixie flags, storm

lethal flashlights which are men

helmets.
''1 If I closed my eyes, I could
- almost believe that we had come
to a park on this sunny October
afternoon. I could hear small
running and laughing,
transistor radios, and the pleas
ant murmur of a large crwod
relaxing on their day away from
iwork. But, if I opened my eyes,
, I saw the large, canvas drapped
cross, the hundreds of helmeted,
uniformed guards uneasily grip
ping metal flashlights filled with
>aiheavy buckshot rather than bat
teries, and the group of hooded
figures going through a secret
"naturalization" (initiation)
ceremony, and I remembered
' where I was.
I was with a group of about
twelve white graduate students
in sociology from Duke Univer
sity. We had come to observe an
open meeting of the Ku Klux
Klan, and to hear Robert Shel
ton speak. None of us were mili
tant leftists or civil rights work
ers—our concern was merely to
jearn first-hand about a move-

ment of which all of us had
heard. Since we were not plan
ning on agitating, we were
dressed casually and made no at
tempt to hide our identity as stu
dents.
Klan Guards
As soon as we drove into the
pasture which served as a park
ing lot, we picked up a small
retinue of walkie-talkie carry
ing Klan guards who followed
us at a distance of ten to twenty
feet, but did not interfere with
our free passage into the vast
meadow where the rally was to
be held. Most of us were nerv
ous, but the picnic atmosphere
of the group served to lessen
our tension.
Violence Begins
Soon after Shelton began to
speak, there was a disturbance
from behind where I was stand
ing. Looking around, I saw five
of our group being pushed and
shoved toward the edge of the
field. One student, a first-year
student from Harvard who had
scoffed at the fears which some
of us had expressed prior to the
start of the rally, was trying to
help his wife along when she
dropped her purse. He stooped
down to pick it up, and was
met with curses and kicks.
While he was still on the ground,
a hooded Klansman hit his wife
in the upper lip, knocking her to
her knees. As her hubsand
helped her up, I saw another
man, not in Klan garb, start

hitting both of them again. Then
the growd swelled up around
them, and I could see nothing
more.
A few minutes later, one of
the guards surrounding our
group told us to get moving,
"But don't touch any of us, you
fifthy white niggers." We were
shoved through the crowd, but
came through better than the
earlier group. Finally we reached
a barbed wire fense, which we
were ordered to climb. One girl
in our group had one leg over
the wires whpn a guard pushed
her other leg into the bards. Most
of the rest of us escaped with
torn clothes and kicks.

Incidents of Klan brutality are
not unusual, and I was not sur
prised to learn first-hand how
much hate is generated at a
Klan rally. However, I had never
realized that a person attending
an open rally in the relatively
progressive state of North Caro
lina who was not protesting or
acting in an aggressive manner
would be as subject to criminal
assault as a S.N.C.C. worker
in Alabama.
Perhaps it was the brutality
with which the guards attacked
the women in our group that im
pressed me most. I know that
I can no longer be a wishy
washy liberal; I can never act as
I did at Stanford, supporting
the fight against Southern reac
tionism in words but not in
deeds.

of our group being pushed and
shoved toward the edge of the
field. One student, a first-year
student from Harvard who had
scoffed at the fears which some
of us had expressed prior to the
start of the rally, was trying to
help his wife along when she
dropped her purse. He stooped
down to pick it up, and was
met with curses and kicks.
While he was still on the ground,
a hooded Klansman hit his wife
in the upper lip, knocking her to
her knees. As her hubsand
helped her up, I saw another
man, not in Klan garb, start

hitting both of them again. Then
the growd swelled up around
them, and I could see nothing
more.
A few minutes later, one of
the guards surrounding our
group told us to get moving,
"But don't touch any of us, you
fifthy white niggers." We were
shoved through the crowd, but
came through better than the
earlier group. Finally we reached
a barbed wire fense, which we
were ordered to climb. One girl
in our group had one leg over
the wires whpn a guard pushed
her other leg into the bards. Most
of the rest of us escaped with
torn clothes and kicks.

Incidents of Klan brutality are
not unusual, and I was not sur
prised to learn first-hand how
much hate is generated at a
Klan rally. However, I had never
realized that a person attending
an open rally in the relatively
progressive state of North Caro
lina who was not protesting or
acting in an aggressive manner
would be as subject to criminal
assault as a S.N.C.C. worker
in Alabama.
Perhaps it was the brutality
with which the guards attacked
the women in our group that im
pressed me most. I know that
I can no longer be a wishy
washy liberal; I can never act as
I did at Stanford, supporting
the fight against Southern reac
tionism in words but not in
deeds.

open meeting of the Ku Klux

heard. Since we were not plan

dressed casually and made no at

Klan Guards
As soon as we drove into the
pasture which served as a park

retinue of walkie-talkie carry

us at a distance of ten to twenty

our free passage into the vast

helmets.
''1 If I closed my eyes, I could
- almost believe that we had come
to a park on this sunny October
afternoon. I could hear small
running and laughing,
transistor radios, and the pleas
ant murmur of a large crwod
relaxing on their day away from
iwork. But, if I opened my eyes,
, I saw the large, canvas drapped
cross, the hundreds of helmeted,
uniformed guards uneasily grip
ping metal flashlights filled with
>aiheavy buckshot rather than bat
teries, and the group of hooded
figures going through a secret
"naturalization" (initiation)
ceremony, and I remembered
' where I was.
I was with a group of about
twelve white graduate students
in sociology from Duke Univer
sity. We had come to observe an
open meeting of the Ku Klux
Klan, and to hear Robert Shel
ton speak. None of us were mili
tant leftists or civil rights work
ers—our concern was merely to
jearn first-hand about a move-

ment of which all of us had
heard. Since we were not plan
ning on agitating, we were
dressed casually and made no at
tempt to hide our identity as stu
dents.
Klan Guards
As soon as we drove into the
pasture which served as a park
ing lot, we picked up a small
retinue of walkie-talkie carry
ing Klan guards who followed
us at a distance of ten to twenty
feet, but did not interfere with
our free passage into the vast
meadow where the rally was to
be held. Most of us were nerv
ous, but the picnic atmosphere
of the group served to lessen
our tension.
Violence Begins
Soon after Shelton began to
speak, there was a disturbance
from behind where I was stand
ing. Looking around, I saw five
of our group being pushed and
shoved toward the edge of the
field. One student, a first-year
student from Harvard who had
scoffed at the fears which some
of us had expressed prior to the
start of the rally, was trying to
help his wife along when she
dropped her purse. He stooped
down to pick it up, and was
met with curses and kicks.
While he was still on the ground,
a hooded Klansman hit his wife
in the upper lip, knocking her to
her knees. As her hubsand
helped her up, I saw another
man, not in Klan garb, start

hitting both of them again. Then
the growd swelled up around
them, and I could see nothing
more.
A few minutes later, one of
the guards surrounding our
group told us to get moving,
"But don't touch any of us, you
fifthy white niggers." We were
shoved through the crowd, but
came through better than the
earlier group. Finally we reached
a barbed wire fense, which we
were ordered to climb. One girl
in our group had one leg over
the wires whpn a guard pushed
her other leg into the bards. Most
of the rest of us escaped with
torn clothes and kicks.

Incidents of Klan brutality are
not unusual, and I was not sur
prised to learn first-hand how
much hate is generated at a
Klan rally. However, I had never
realized that a person attending
an open rally in the relatively
progressive state of North Caro
lina who was not protesting or
acting in an aggressive manner
would be as subject to criminal
assault as a S.N.C.C. worker
in Alabama.
Perhaps it was the brutality
with which the guards attacked
the women in our group that im
pressed me most. I know that
I can no longer be a wishy
washy liberal; I can never act as
I did at Stanford, supporting
the fight against Southern reac
tionism in words but not in
deeds.
