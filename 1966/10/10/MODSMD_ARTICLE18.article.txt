# Sailing Club Gains New Craft
## 
### 
The addition of two 30-foot
Shields Class sailing sloops
will highlight the Stanford Sail
ing Club's racing and recrea
tional activities this year. The
Sloops, valued at between $7-
.10,000 were the gifts of Cornel
lius Shields.
Besides the double bonus to
SSC, two other schools on the
west coast, USC and UC at Ir

vine, received similar boats from
Shields. Referred to as the
"Grand old man of sailing"
Shields helped in the design
(one mast, two sails) of the
boat, and has participated in the
American Cup racing series.
The new boats, which are ex
pected to arrive later this month,
will be moored at the San Fran
cisco Yacht Club at Tiburon,

north of Sausalito. The club's
own fleet of 100 Flying Dutch
men Juniors, similar in style to
the Shields' boat, but only 14-
feet long, will be used as per
last year on Lake Vasona near
Los Gatos in the fall quarter, and
on Lake Lagunita in the winter
and spring.
Both sets of boats will be
raced by the club. The new
sloops will be active in the SF
Yacht Club's Bay Series. And
although the new boats will be
unfamiliar to the SCC members,
Tom Gilbert, SSC vice-president,
stated confidently, "The sloops
shouldn't be too hard to race
effectively with a little practice,
and since all boats in a given
class are identical, the race de
pends on the ability of skipper
and crew."
The smaller, but more numer
ous, Flying Juniors might be
used for the Intercollegiate Na
tional Small Boat Champion
ships at Santa Cruz if the Stan

ford club is picked over Long
Beach State as host school.
Club members also travel to
invitational sailing meets if they
receive financial support. Last
April, five members of SSC jour
neyed to Annapolis for the John
F. Kennedy Memorial Regatta.
The group sailed the Academy's
44-foot yawl (i.e., mainmast
farther forward than in a sloop,
and a smaller mizzenmast far
aft) and captured fifth place out
of ten entries. The club hopes
to be invited to return this year.
A crew of four people will be
used with the new sloops when
racing, and will carry six in gen
earl use. The racing crews are
picked through intra-club com
petition and member experience.
The SSC depends entirely on
membership dues for expenses,
but receives support from Stan
ford Alumni. Donation sent the
group to Annapolis last year,
and purchased eight of the Fly
ing Juniors.
