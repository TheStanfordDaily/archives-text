# World Series Round Up
## Orioles Sweep Series; Dodgers Set Records 
### 
By PERRY LEE BIRCHARD
The Los Angeles Dodgers
gained fame yesterday, but not
the kind of fame that they had
wanted. While losing their
fourth straight World Series
game to the Baltimore Orioles,
they set records for the most
scoreless innings and fewest
base hits in a Series. They went
33 scoreless innings and accrued
but 17 base hits. Earlier, in the
second game, they tied a record
for the most errors in a World
Series game with 6. and Willie
Davis earned the odious distinc
tion of making 3 errors in one
game.
The fourth game, like the
third, was won by a one run
home run. In the fourth inning,
Frank Robinson hit a home run
off Don Drysdale, and Dave
McNally won the game despite
a rock finish.
Drysdale lost both the first
and last game for the Dodgers.
McNally faced him both times,
but was relieved after 2% in
nings in the first game by Moe
Drabowsky. The final score of
the first game was 5-2 and Dra
bowsky was given credit for the
win.
Sandy Koufax faced Jim Pal
mer in the second game and lost
6-0. He gave up but one earned
run. Claude Osteen battled Wal
ly Bunker in the third game and
lost 1-0 by giving up a home
run to Paul Blair.
The Dodgers' only hoped-for
strong point going into the se
ries was their pitching. They
are not a slugging ball club. Be
cause of Maury Will's ailing

legs, the Dodgers are no longer
a running team. On the other
hand, the Orioles have a young
pitching staff—one of the
youngest in World Series his
tory—but strong hitting led by
Frank Robinson, Brooks Robin
son, and Paul Blair. It was given
that Lf the Orioles could get
ahead of the Dodgers by a few
runs, the Dodgers would not
have the hitting power to catch
up. That is what the Orioles did
in the first and second games.
After the first two games,
history was against the Dodg
ers. No team that has lost the
first two games in its own home
territory has ever been able to
come back to take the Series.
Speculators may argue for
some time that the Dodgers lost
the Series before they played
the first inning. Walter Alston
used unrested pitching ace San
dy Koufax to pull out the last
game of the regular season
rather than chancing a play-off
with the San Francisco Giants.
This meant that Koufax was not
ready to pitch in the first and
fourth games.
While the speculators and
Dodger fans were buried in
thought and tears, reports of
near-r i o t in g exuberant fans
were coming from Baltimore.
What had begun as a victory
celebration for the first World
Series ever won by the Orioles
turned into a screaming mob.
Police called out their special
crowd control units, K-9 Corps
members, and fire trucks to
quell the crowds which roamed
Baltimore's streets. The mob

was swarming over cars, throw
Ing beer cans, and destroying
signs and property.
At last report, quietude hao
not yet returned to Mudville.
