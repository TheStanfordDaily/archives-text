# Gardner, Arbuckle Dedicate Biz School
## Dean: New Age For Grad School 
### HENRY MULLER News Editor 
At the dedication of the new Grad
uate School of Business last Friday,
Dean Ernest C. Arbuckle told a near
capacity audience that the new build
ing is "a symbol of the coming of age
of education for business administra
tion in competition with the older pro
fessional schools of medicine, law, and
engineering."
"It suggests a recognition that the
study of management involves a body
of knowledge of substantial intellect
ual content," he added.
Also participating in the ceremonies
was U.S. Secretary of Health, Educa
tion, and Welfare John W. Gardner,
who described the role of professional
schools as that of a "bridge between
the core of the university, the core of
science and scholarship in the univer
sity, and the world of practical af
fairs."
Knowledge vs. Applications
"They mediate between the idea and
its uses, between knowledge and its
applications," he said.
Gardner went on to praise the Stan
ford Business School for its recogni
tion that "in a free society, a primary
purpose of any organization is the en
hancement of the individual."
Arbuckle promised that the busi
ness school will establish a "higher,
tougher standard of quality that is
going to be necessary if our graduates
are to provide the leadership required
in business enterprise in the years
ahead." He said that he had set up a
Long Range Planning Committee of
the faculty to make recommendations
for improvement of the school in the
next ten years.
Arbuckle also mentioned that the
new building would permit a slight ex
pansion of the student body. "But we
seek to become a great school, not a
big school," he emphasized.
