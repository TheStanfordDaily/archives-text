# Duck Defense Upsets Stanford, 7-3
## 
### JOHN MERRILL 
Led by a pair of brilliant
sophomore backfield men, the
aroused Oregon Ducks handed
the surprised Stanford Indians
a 7-3 defeat in the first confer
ence game of the year for both
teams.
Though in the last two years
the Indians have come from be
hind to defeat the Ducks in the
fourth quarter, the underdog
Oregon team was able to keep
their halftime lead and relegate
the Indians to their half of the
field for most of the second half
to preserve the narrow victory.
The first half was truly all-
Oregon and, more than that, all-
Oregon-sophomore. Steve Jones
carried the ball 20 times from
the halfback position while
Mike Barnes handled the ball 20
times at quarterback. This ac
counted for all but two of the
Oregon plays. Jones ran for 100
yards in his 20 carries.
First Half Disaster
Stanford's first half was a
disaster for a team that had to
this point scored more points
than any other conference team.
The Indians could muster
only one first down and 39

yards of total offense. With 34
yards of penalties, that left the
Tribe with very little forward
progress in a dismal first half.
Stanford held the Ducks in
the early minutes of the game,
despite a costly defensive hold
ing penalty that gave the Ducks
their first first down.
Sophomore Barnes' first two
aerial attempts were almost in
tercepted and the Ducks were
forced to punt. Barnes had had
only two weeks at the quarter
back position, being touted as a
defensive back at the season's
beginning.
However both times that
Stanford got the ball in this
early going ended in three
downs and a punt. Tom Hazel
rigg gave the Cards their first
offensive chance when he re
covered a Webfoot pitchout on
the Oregon 24.
The Indians drove down to the
four yard line, which constituted
the only time that Stanford was
able to keep the ball for more
than four downs in the first
half. In this series Jack Root
collected the lone first down of
the half on an eight yard burst
up the middle.

As the drive stalled on the
four yard line, Coach Ralston
called on Mike Shoemaker, who
kicked four field goals last
week, and Shoemaker got the
three points to put Stanford in
the lead.
After the kickoff Stanford got
another opportunity to capi
talize on a Duck miscue as Mon
ty Mohrman recovered on the
Oregon 40. But two plays later
a Gene Washington pass was
intercepted and the quarter end
ed with Stanford holding a 3-0
lead.
The second quarter was com
pletely dominated by Oregon,
and by Steve Jones in particu
lar. Jones was in the Stanford
secondary repeatedly, and was
brought down by John Guillory
or John Read only after gains
of five or six yards.
The Ducks' first drive fea
tured the finest run of the game
as Mike Barnes scrambled for
49 yards through the Stanford
defense after being trapped for
a loss. However this drive was
stopped on the Indian 12 where
Donn Renwick made a spectacu
lar interception of a Barnes
pass.

Two Duck Breaks
But after four downs the
Ducks had the ball and were
driving again. This time Oregon
was aided by two key plays and
was able to score. A penalty for
grabbing the face mask placed
the ball in scoring position after
Jones had given the Webfeet a
first down on the Card 39.

Stanford then held Jones for
no-gain at left end, where A 1
Wilburn played well all after
noon. Barnes then launched a
badly thrown pass in the direc
tion of end Lynn Hendrickson
and linebacker for Stanford,
Marty Brill, got the first hand
on it.
Decision to Oregon
A spirited wrestling match
ensued but the referee awarded
the decision to Hendrickson and
Oregon, giving the Ducks first
down on the Stanford ten yard
line.
The Big Red line, anchored by
Brill and John Haygood, held
the Ducks for two plays, but

Jones finally hurtled into the
end zone from the one yard line.
Mike Brundage's kick was
good and the Webfeet had all
they needed as things turned
out. After the kickoff Stanford
ran another series of downs but
soon returned the ball to Ore
gon. The half ended with Mike
Brundage completing a 48 yard
play as the gun went off, and
the Indians retreated to the
locker room in an attempt to
solve their first half problems.
Different This Half?
After receiving the kickoff the
third quarter started off bright
ly for the Indians. Gene Wash
ington ran right end for the ini
tial first down and three plays
later Jack Root broke off left
tackle for his biggest gainer of
the day, 28 yards.
Root consistently bulled his
way through the tough, seven
man Oregon line, though his ex
cellent performance was some
what overshadowed by the play
of Oregon's Jones. This particu
lar long gain in the second min
ute of play pushed the second
half offensive yardage to a
greater total than the total first
half offense.
However this drive was ended
four plays later when Mike
Shoemaker's second field goal
attempt of the day was wide to
the left. At this point the Stan
ford defense put in its best ef
fort of the day.
Different This Time?
Despite another 15 yard pen
alty, the Indians forced the
Ducks to punt. Mark Marquess
called for a fair catch at his 21
and the Cards began to really

move the ball for the first, and
only time of the afternoon.
Jack Root collected three first
downs and Dave Lewis and Tim
Abena led the offensive drive.
The Indians were on the Oregon
29 when a bad pitch caused a
loss to the Duck 40 and created
a fourth down situation.
Chuck Williams, who handles
Stanford's short punt depart
ment, punted the ball dead on
the Oregon 14, but there was a
penalty tlag on the play.
Field Debate
Oregon was called for defen
sive holding and a debate fol
lowed the call as to the position
of the ball before the play. Af
ter the game, Coach RaLston
said he felt the play started
with fourth and 14 while the
referee, after three minutes of
hassling which saw both coach
es on the playing field, finally
decided that the situation was
fourth and 19. Thus the penalty
left the Indians four yards short
of the needed first down.
Mike Shoemaker came on to
try a field goal, which was
blocked. The Ducks took over on
the seven and the Indians' best
drive of the day ended without
scoring.
The fourth quarter saw both
Chuck Williams and Gene
Washington at quarterback, but
only a few flashes of a strong
offensive attack.
The Tribe unveiled a decep
tive Washington to Lewis to
Washington handoff and pass
play which was good for 13
yards. However Oregon back
Jim Smith, called by many the
best defensive back on the coast,

then picked off a Washington
pass and ended this rally.
The Indians again got the ball
with eight minutes, and then
with four minutes remaining,
but each series resulted in a
yardage loss that forced a punt.
As the final seconds ticked
away, Chuck Williams and Gene
Washington attempted long
passes to no avail, as Stanford
was "not able to get into Oregon
half of the field.
Final Try
At the final gun, Washington
made it into Oregon territory
taking a 48 yard pass from Dave
Lewis, but it was a case of too
littleâ€”too late.
The victory, Oregon's first in
four starts this season, was also
the first victory in the last eight
conference games for the Web
feet.
The loss puts Stanford in the
loss column for the conference
record and leaves the Indians
with an overall season record of
2-2-0. Next week the Indians
take on undefeated USC here in
the Stanford Stadium.
