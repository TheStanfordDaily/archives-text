# BOOTERS TIE S.F. CITY COLLEGE
## Soccer Team Dumps OSU 
### BILL GRAHAM 
Stanford's varsity soccer team
had a busy day Saturday, de
feating Oregon State, 9-3, in the
morning and coming back to tie
San Francisco City College, 2-2,
in the afternoon.
The Cards had an easy time
of it against Oregon State, con
trolling the ball for most of the
game and out-shooting their op
ponents by more than 2-1.
Against San Francisco, the In
dians found the going tougher,
however. The Tribe had to come
back with two goals in the last
quarter to gain the tie.
Co-captain John Cox started
the scoring for Stanford in the
first game when he booted one
in with only two minutes gone
in the finst period. Center-for
ward Knut Arneson added an
other later in the first period
and the game was never close
from then on.
Nystrom Tallies Twice
Oregon tallied once in the sec
ond period, but Kenney Nys
trom scored twice and Mike
Camp put one in to give the
Cards a 5-1 half-time lead.
Stanford added three goals in
the third period, two more by
Cox and one by Rusty Hall. Ore
gon State did not score again
until the final period when they
put in two against the Card's
second team.
Returning to the field after
only two hours of rest, Stan
ford was scored upon by San
Francisco after one minute in

the first period. But the Cards
tightened up and allowed no
more scoring in the first half.
Fourth Period Rally
San Francisco tallied again
about half way through the
third quarter to take a 2-0 lead.
But the Indians fought back in
the fourth period, their eighth
quarter of soccer in one day, as
Knut Arneson scored on a pen
alty kick and Cox, with an as
sist from Geoff Gray, contrib
uted his fourth goal of the day,
to give Stanford the tie.
Coach Fred Priddle noted that
the team "did exceptionally
well" all day, and felt that if
they had played San Francisco
in the morning, the outcome
might have been different. Sain
Francisco was champion of the
Western Inter-Collegiate Soccer
Conference's junior college divi
sion last year, and has a lot of
players back.
Stanford takes on San Jose
State in their next game,
Wednesday, at Stanford. The
Spartans are loaded with talent
this year. They have already
beaten Cal, 5-2, and have scored
34 points in their first four
games, as opposed to their oppo
nents' four.
Coach Priddle is optimistic
about his team's chances in the
WICSC, however. "We gave San
Francisco a very 6tiff battle and
I wouldn't be surprised if we
came out on top."
Freshmen Victorious
The freshmen soccer team
played its first game of the sea
son, defeating Balboa High
School, 4-2, Saturday. K irk
Brown scored three goals for
the Frosh and A 1 Jessup added
one, to give the team a success
ful opener.
The varsity's record so far is
2-1-1. San Jose will be the Card's
first league opponents. After

San Jose, the Indians face the
University of the Pacific, Octo
ber 15 and the University of
California at Davis, October 22.
