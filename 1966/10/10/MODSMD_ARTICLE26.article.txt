# Poloists Beat Long Beach, Drop Two Close Matches
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER Sports Editor 
Stanford hopes for a national
water polo championship were
dimmed last weekend but not
extinguished. The Indians lost
one-goal decisions to San Jose
State (9-8) and Cal (10-9) and
beat Long Beach City College,
12-6.
The Tribe should be back at
full strength next weekend
against Foothill and USC. Gary
Sheerer, first team All-Ameri
can and AAU Most Outstanding
Player, will be back in action
after an auto accident Septem
ber 30.
The Cards play perennially
dangerous Foothill, away, Fri
day, and meet USC with Roy
Saari, Dean Willeford, Bill John
son and company Saturday
morning at 10:00, at Stanford.
Slow Start
Stanford could not get mov
ing against San Jose last Thurs
day. The Spartans took an early
3-0 lead that the Indians whit
tled down to one, but the In
dians could not come up with
their old offensive punch to tie
the game.
Friday's game against Cal
saw a different Stanford team
but the Indians' opponents were
many notches above San Jose
in the water.
Cal, with Barry Weitzenberg,
Mike Turner and John Shores
from Foothill national
AAU champion team, must rate
among the nation's top three
teams. Weitzenberg scored six
of the Bears' ten goals.

Cal opened strong in the first
period, taking a 5-3 lead over
Stanford. Weitzenberg scored
four times for Cal in the quar
ter.
Stanford held even with the
powerful Bears in the second
quarter, both teams scoring
twice. The Indians pulled to
within one goal of Cal in the
third period as Mark Parmely
and Greg Buckingham scored
their second goals of the day.
Indians Rally
Behind 8-7 going into the last
quarter, Stanford fell two in the
hole as Shores scored for Cal.
The Cards surged back, Bill Ror
rig hit his second of the day.
Then, with 45 seconds remain
ing, Pete Ready slammed in the
tving goal. Ready scored two
goals in the game, and set up
three more with pinpoint assist
passes.
Stanford hopes soon dropped,
however, and Ken High scored
the winning goal for Cal with
15 seconds left.
Handle Long 1 Beach
The Indians brushed aside dis
appointment, and handled Long
Beach City College the next day,
12-6, in a game where every
Stanford player saw action.
The Tribe cruised to a 5-1 first
quarter lead, and controlled the
game decisively after that.
Mark Parmely led the Indian
scorers with one goal for each
of the four quarters.
Bill Meyer hit three for the
Cards, and Bill Derrig who had
two assists, scored twice. John

Parker set up two goals and
scored once. Ready and Doug
Mac Lean each hit one goal.
Mike Sorem, who made four
goalie saves, had an easy time
in the third quarter. The Stan
ford defnese did not permit a
single Long Beach shot.
Stanford will play Cal and
San Jose at least twice again
this season, and will have ample
chance to avenge the two close
defeats. National rankings are
compiled at the end of the sea
son, with the year-end tourna
ments playing a predominant
role in the ratings. Stanford's
1963 national champion squad
had a 21-2 record.
Frosh Water Polo
The Papoose poloists opened
their season in a sore way
against San Jose State last
Thursday, losing 23-9. Cal's
frosh inflicted an 18-9 defeat
upon the Stanford freshmen Fri
day.
Saturday, the Papooses once
again fell, 14-11, to Santa Ana
College. The three days of ex
perience taught the freshmen
much, however. The Papoose
squad that played Saturday
would hardly be recognized as
the same one that played San
Jose.
Wayne Wilson leads the Pa
pooses scorers, hitting 13 goals
in the first three games. Tom
Hill scored seven times, and
Tucker Stanwood 5.

Thursday, losing 23-9. Cal's
frosh inflicted an 18-9 defeat
upon the Stanford freshmen Fri
day.
Saturday, the Papooses once

many notches above San Jose
in the water.
Cal, with Barry Weitzenberg,
Mike Turner and John Shores
from Foothill national
AAU champion team, must rate
among the nation's top three
teams. Weitzenberg scored six
of the Bears' ten goals.

Cal opened strong in the first
period, taking a 5-3 lead over
Stanford. Weitzenberg scored
four times for Cal in the quar
ter.
Stanford held even with the
powerful Bears in the second
quarter, both teams scoring
twice. The Indians pulled to
within one goal of Cal in the
third period as Mark Parmely
and Greg Buckingham scored
their second goals of the day.
Indians Rally
Behind 8-7 going into the last
quarter, Stanford fell two in the
hole as Shores scored for Cal.
The Cards surged back, Bill Ror
rig hit his second of the day.
Then, with 45 seconds remain
ing, Pete Ready slammed in the
tving goal. Ready scored two
goals in the game, and set up
three more with pinpoint assist
passes.
Stanford hopes soon dropped,
however, and Ken High scored
the winning goal for Cal with
15 seconds left.
Handle Long 1 Beach
The Indians brushed aside dis
appointment, and handled Long
Beach City College the next day,
12-6, in a game where every
Stanford player saw action.
The Tribe cruised to a 5-1 first
quarter lead, and controlled the
game decisively after that.
Mark Parmely led the Indian
scorers with one goal for each
of the four quarters.
Bill Meyer hit three for the
Cards, and Bill Derrig who had
two assists, scored twice. John

Parker set up two goals and
scored once. Ready and Doug
Mac Lean each hit one goal.
Mike Sorem, who made four
goalie saves, had an easy time
in the third quarter. The Stan
ford defnese did not permit a
single Long Beach shot.
Stanford will play Cal and
San Jose at least twice again
this season, and will have ample
chance to avenge the two close
defeats. National rankings are
compiled at the end of the sea
son, with the year-end tourna
ments playing a predominant
role in the ratings. Stanford's
1963 national champion squad
had a 21-2 record.
Frosh Water Polo
The Papoose poloists opened
their season in a sore way
against San Jose State last
Thursday, losing 23-9. Cal's
frosh inflicted an 18-9 defeat
upon the Stanford freshmen Fri
day.
Saturday, the Papooses once
again fell, 14-11, to Santa Ana
College. The three days of ex
perience taught the freshmen
much, however. The Papoose
squad that played Saturday
would hardly be recognized as
the same one that played San
Jose.
Wayne Wilson leads the Pa
pooses scorers, hitting 13 goals
in the first three games. Tom
Hill scored seven times, and
Tucker Stanwood 5.
