# Women Off-Campus
## 
### 
The current petition for women's off-campus
living stands at the end of a series of similar
protests. Administrators have long failed to
discern that quality of a Stanford education
which renders men mature enough to enjoy off
campus living and which, curiously, does not
affect women.
We find it rather difficult to accept a serious
defense for denying upperelass women, who
have parental consent, the option of living off
campus. Rut the issue has deeper implications
for the campus than a belated recognition of
maturity in upperelass women. Although the or
ganizers of campaign declare, "This is not a
grim student rebellion against dorms," there is
more to their protest than the common cause
of feminine equality which has stirred the
Susan B. Anthony's of every era. For the option
to live off-campus would in no way affect the
problems in Stanford's living system, and it is
the shortcomings of the dorm as well as the issue
of equality which motivates the women's cam
paign.
It is correct to observe that the University
cannot afford a mass exodus of women, yet
there is no profit in maintaining residences. A
portion of student room fees is used to pay for
initial building costs of the newer dorms. Thus
when annual debt payments are figured into
room costs, income from some residences is not
adequate to meet expenses while other resi
dences show a surplus. While some students
may be paying for more than they receive in

immediate services, there is no overall profit.
Here the problem of the University, how to
achieve full capacity if women were allowed to
move off-campus, and the women's indictment,
that dorms are sterile places, merge into one
question: What is lacking in dorm life at Stan
ford? If the only recommendation for on-campus
living is an administrative fiat, we challenge
Stanford's claim to the use of the term "resi
dential university."
As an instrument of education, women's resi
dences are far behind men's living. The oppor
tunity to integrate classes into the residence life
is close to non-existant. No women's residence
is able to host a guest-in-residence for want of
facilities, nor are there any provisions for fac
ulty residents.
Last November Sandy Mackenzie, then stu
dent body president, issued a formal statement
requesting "a complete statement of the Univer
sity's residence philosophy." Unfortunately the
administration is now embarking upon a study
of freshman living only, and President Sterling
has not made known any plan to consider liv
ing systems as part of the general reappraisal
of education at Stanford. The sole point of en
couragement is the ASSU Housing Commission
which is under way on an extensive study of all
living options.
The women's case for living off-campus forms
an even stronger argument for a thorough ex
amination of the residential life Stanford is
providing.

achieve full capacity if women were allowed to
move off-campus, and the women's indictment,
that dorms are sterile places, merge into one
question: What is lacking in dorm life at Stan
ford? If the only recommendation for on-campus
living is an administrative fiat, we challenge
Stanford's claim to the use of the term "resi
dential university."
As an instrument of education, women's resi
dences are far behind men's living. The oppor
tunity to integrate classes into the residence life
is close to non-existant. No women's residence
is able to host a guest-in-residence for want of
facilities, nor are there any provisions for fac
ulty residents.
Last November Sandy Mackenzie, then stu
dent body president, issued a formal statement
requesting "a complete statement of the Univer
sity's residence philosophy." Unfortunately the
administration is now embarking upon a study
of freshman living only, and President Sterling
has not made known any plan to consider liv
ing systems as part of the general reappraisal
of education at Stanford. The sole point of en
couragement is the ASSU Housing Commission
which is under way on an extensive study of all
living options.
The women's case for living off-campus forms
an even stronger argument for a thorough ex
amination of the residential life Stanford is
providing.
The current petition for women's off-campus
living stands at the end of a series of similar
protests. Administrators have long failed to
discern that quality of a Stanford education
which renders men mature enough to enjoy off
campus living and which, curiously, does not
affect women.
We find it rather difficult to accept a serious
defense for denying upperelass women, who
have parental consent, the option of living off
campus. Rut the issue has deeper implications
for the campus than a belated recognition of
maturity in upperelass women. Although the or
ganizers of campaign declare, "This is not a
grim student rebellion against dorms," there is
more to their protest than the common cause
of feminine equality which has stirred the
Susan B. Anthony's of every era. For the option
to live off-campus would in no way affect the
problems in Stanford's living system, and it is
the shortcomings of the dorm as well as the issue
of equality which motivates the women's cam
paign.
It is correct to observe that the University
cannot afford a mass exodus of women, yet
there is no profit in maintaining residences. A
portion of student room fees is used to pay for
initial building costs of the newer dorms. Thus
when annual debt payments are figured into
room costs, income from some residences is not
adequate to meet expenses while other resi
dences show a surplus. While some students
may be paying for more than they receive in

immediate services, there is no overall profit.

achieve full capacity if women were allowed to
