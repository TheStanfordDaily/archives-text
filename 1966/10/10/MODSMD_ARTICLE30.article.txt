## Newest Defensive Strategy Is Bridging Vietnam's Gap 
### Art Buchwald 
WASHINGTON — Congress
man Thomas M. Rees of Cali
fornia raised this question in a
lecent newsletter that has been
bothering many people — How
many bridges does North Viet
nam really have?
He says that despite continu
ous bombing of North Viet
namese bridges the Ho govern
ment seems to be building them
much faster than we can destroy
'hem. In a recent two-week per
iod a military spokesman an
nounced that we had destroyed
33 bridges, which is a very im
pressive figure.
But what has Congressman
Rees worried is that during the
same period the U.S. military
innounced that infiltration into
South Vietnam had increased.
It seems the more targets we
knock out in North Vietnam the
more troops are sent into South
Vietnam.
Raw For Spans
Rees raises these questions:
Are the North Vietnamese win
ning the race for spans? Is the
United States suffering from a
bridge gap?
To find the answer to these
questions I interview the un
dersecretary of defense in
charge of destroying bridges.
He had a very simple explana
lon for the whole thing.
"You must remember," he
said, "when we started bomb
ing North Vietnam we expected
Hanoi to cave in immediately,
therefore, there was no effort

made to ration the country's
military targets over any period
of time. The bombers went in
there and destroyed everything
without thought to the future.
Short of Targets
"Much to everyone's surprise,
the bombing did not have the
effect we wanted. Instead of
giving in, North Vietnamese re
sistance stiffened, and suddenly
the United States found itself
with a shortage of bombing tar
gets."
"To paraphrase Churchill," I
said, "never had so much been
done by so few, so fast."
"Something like that," the
undersecretary 6aid. "Well, we
were caught flatfooted, so we
asked the administration to de
clare a temporary bombing ces
sation of North Vietnam. They
could announce the reason we
were doing it was to give Hanoi
a chance to seek peace negotia
tions, but in fact the pause
would give the North Vietna
mese a chance to repair their
bridges so we would have some
targets to bomb again."
"It was clever strategy," I ad
mitted.
Helluva Predicament
"Unfortunately our bombing
was so good that as soon as we
were permitted to fly over
North Vietnam again we de
stroyed all the bridges that had
been repaired. This left us in a
helluva predicament, so we de
cided to go after their oil

storage tanks and railroad
yards.
"But once again we knocked
them out in a few raids, and
the realization started to dawn
on us that the larger the raids
the less results we had to show
for it. In the beginning the de
struction of an oil storage tank
farm was a big event, but as
time went on we found our
selves happy to announce that
150 B-52s had knocked out two
jeeps and eight water buffalos."
Second Wave
"I remember that," I said.
"So we decided the only solu
tion to the problem was to drop
our own bridges on North Viet
nam and then destroy them
with our own planes. The first
wave of bombers would let go
with the bridges and the second
wave would come on a half
hour later and bomb them.
"In this way we could truth
fully say we had knocked out
more bridges than the North
Vietnamese had to start with."
"And it's working?" I asked.
"I should hope to tell you it's
working. We've got the Commu
nists completely confused be
cause they can't account for the
bridges we've destroyed. And
it's also played havoc with
North Vietnamese morale. The
soldiers there are very embit
tered. They want to know why,
if North Vietnam has that many
bridges, they have to swim
across so many dirty rivers all
the time."
