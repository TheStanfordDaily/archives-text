# Percolating Reflections On Summer As-Such
## 
### WENDY WEINER 
The coffeehouse controversy
bubbles on. I find Dean Smith's
reasons for dismissing the proj
ect very inadequate. Having
started this summer's As-Such I
feel strongly about the need for
a coffeehouse on the Stanford
campus. A coffeehouse is the
one instrument that could pro
vide integration of the many
fragments that comprise the
"Stanford educational experi
ence," a misnomer according to
a definition of education as a
constantly-occurring process. At
the present time, because Stan
ford refuses to provide a frame
work in which the student can
educate himself, it is not ful
filling its duty as a University.
It seems we may not have a
coffeehouse because some ad
ministrators are excessively
frightened about the drug situ
ation in and around the Stan
ford community. If this is the
case, perhaps these people
should try to approach the prob
lem using a more constructive
method than intimidation. For
instance, they could look at the
coffeehouse as an example of
preventive medicine. If students
are going underground and
turning to drugs, perhaps it is
because these experiences are
fulfilling needs that are not be
ing met by the environment in
which they are livingâ€”in this
case, the University.
Meeting Place
A coffeehouse would be a
meeting place which, unlike
Tresidder, would have an at
mosphere conducive to commu
nication among students, facul
ty, and administrators. It would
be a place where people could
go at all times, even after 11:30,
and as such (please excuse me),
could add a much needed sense
of community to life here.
A coffeehouse is essential now
when education is finally being
questioned by so many people.
It is disconcerting that adminis
trators should minimize the
positive values of this new spir
it of evaluation; questioning be
comes stagnant when it is lim
ited to separate living groups
and a barren Union. For discus

sion to achieve balance it needs
the participation of individuals
from all segments of the Uni
versity. But the University is re
fusing to provide a place where
such constructive interchange
can survive, let alone thrive.
Personal Experience
According to my experience
with the As-Such this summer,
the argument that a coffeehouse
would be "a den of iniquity and
a market place for area junk
ies" is not at all valid. To my
knowledge, and I was fairly
alert, there was no drug traffic
in the soffeehouse this summer.
The only incident concerning
drugs occurred outside of the
coffehouse between some high
school students, who, according
to the Stanford police, had
known each other long before
the advent of the As-Such.
Even that minor problem
would have been avoided if I
had been sensible and had exer
cised my right to keep the high
school hippies out. I'm sure that
a future venture would profit
from my mistakes.
Goal Reached
By the middle of the summer
the As-Such had actually be
come what both students and
administrators had hoped it
would be. Undergraduate and
graduate students, some profes
sors, and even a few administra
tors were coming over, casually
meeting each other, and infor
mally conversing. I know the
atmosphere didn't convey that
healthy sterility a Stanford
gathering place is supposed to
have. Still, I am convinced that
the As Such neither was nor
would be the house of ill repute
that some people envision.
I have too much respect for
the intellectual backgrounds of
Joel Smith and other adminis
trators to regard them as jani
tors (re. Letter to Ed., Oct. 5.).
But judging from their reaction
to this whole coffeehouse issue,
I am certain that they could
learn an important lesson from
that hardworking segment of
our "community." Every janitor
knows that you don't sweep
away a mess unless there's a
mess to sweep away.
