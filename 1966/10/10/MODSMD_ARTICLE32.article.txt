## Participation Implies Equal Responsibility 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Having read the coverage of
my discussion with Dave Harris
at Roble last week, I wish to
clarify some of my views that
were only partially reported.
Although Stanford has much
to offer as a university, no one
would call it the best of all pos
sible worlds. Harris has placed
the blame on an overly rigid ad
ministration; as I see it, the
problem lies with one that is
largely uncoordinated and often
falls short in its job of provid
ing leadership and innovation.
However, we will be hypo
crites if we only talk about what
is wrong, but shun the tedious
work that accompanies reform.
If we students believe we have
an equal part in the community,
we must also assume equal re
sponsibility. Too often 1 have
seen student-initiated projects
fail because we did not see them
to the end nor did we provide
for their continuation beyond a
year or two.
We students have much to
contribute to the university
through our ideas for better
teaching, residential education,
social reform, and many other
issues. Surely there are better
mechanisms for initiating our
ideas than the present autono
mous and often conflicting stu
dent, faculty, and administrative
committees.
The goal, then, is for us to
become a more effective part of
the planning and decision-mak
ing process. To achieve this, I
submit we must do two things.
First, we must demonstrate our
competence through ideas and
actions, using whatever mech

anisms already exist. Second,
we must transform our ideals
into a carefully outlined, work
able form of government that
actually can be implemented. To
talk of "real community" is one
thing; to establish a method of
government embodying such a
principle among groups of di
verse interests is another.
Dave Harris is doing a com
mendable job of stimulating
concern for education at Stan
ford. In my discussion with him,
I certainly did not mean that
change is not needed; but I fear
many of the statements he has
made are vague and, for our
own sake, should not be left
unchallenged. These questions
remain to be answered:
Specifically, what new mecha
nisms of government might we
implement at Stanford, embody
ing a principle of "community"?
Harris asserts each constitu
ency should have sole power in
deciding its own affairs. How
ever, is there a single education
al issue that affects one consti
tuency and no others?
Harris says "administrators
should administrate." What spe
cifically does that mean?
Ultimately, perhaps, the edu
cational process is "in a per
son's own mind," but what spe
cial resources does a university
provide that "no other institution
or community can provide as ef
fectively? How should we at
Stanford best utilize and reform
these resources?
These are questions I think
all of us should consider, and
perhaps Harris himself could
respond to them here in the
Daily. MICHAEL ROSTER

I certainly did not mean that
change is not needed; but I fear
many of the statements he has
made are vague and, for our
own sake, should not be left
unchallenged. These questions
remain to be answered:
Specifically, what new mecha
nisms of government might we
implement at Stanford, embody
ing a principle of "community"?
Harris asserts each constitu
ency should have sole power in
deciding its own affairs. How
ever, is there a single education
al issue that affects one consti
tuency and no others?
Harris says "administrators
should administrate." What spe
cifically does that mean?
Ultimately, perhaps, the edu
cational process is "in a per
son's own mind," but what spe
cial resources does a university
provide that "no other institution
or community can provide as ef
fectively? How should we at
Stanford best utilize and reform
these resources?
These are questions I think
all of us should consider, and
perhaps Harris himself could

Editor, The Daily:
Having read the coverage of
my discussion with Dave Harris
at Roble last week, I wish to
clarify some of my views that
were only partially reported.
Although Stanford has much
to offer as a university, no one
would call it the best of all pos
sible worlds. Harris has placed
the blame on an overly rigid ad
ministration; as I see it, the
problem lies with one that is
largely uncoordinated and often
falls short in its job of provid
ing leadership and innovation.
However, we will be hypo
crites if we only talk about what
is wrong, but shun the tedious
work that accompanies reform.
If we students believe we have
an equal part in the community,
we must also assume equal re
sponsibility. Too often 1 have
seen student-initiated projects
fail because we did not see them
to the end nor did we provide
for their continuation beyond a
year or two.
We students have much to
contribute to the university
through our ideas for better
teaching, residential education,
social reform, and many other
issues. Surely there are better
mechanisms for initiating our
ideas than the present autono
mous and often conflicting stu
dent, faculty, and administrative
committees.
The goal, then, is for us to
become a more effective part of
the planning and decision-mak
ing process. To achieve this, I
submit we must do two things.
First, we must demonstrate our
competence through ideas and
actions, using whatever mech

anisms already exist. Second,
we must transform our ideals
into a carefully outlined, work
able form of government that
actually can be implemented. To
talk of "real community" is one
thing; to establish a method of
government embodying such a
principle among groups of di
verse interests is another.
