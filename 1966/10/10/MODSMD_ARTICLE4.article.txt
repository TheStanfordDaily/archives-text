# Boyd Denies Traditional Religion
## 
### MICHAEL COUZENS 
"Hell is when you're not opened
up . . . Heaven is when you permit
yourself to be broken open."
Malcolm Boyd, iconoclast, show
man, polemicist—and priest, was an
swering questions on White Plaza Fri
day.
"I'm not strumming a sermon for
you. I don't play a guitar. I'm not
the singing nun." He wanted to em
phasize this "particularly after your
nice little local rag said I was com
ing out strumming."
Boyd said later in a press confer
ence that he always made sure to
say something outrageous to people
who think he is a nut. This lets them
prove it to their own satisfaction.
They made a mistake. True, Mal
colm Boyd says shocking things: "I'm
not at all hung up about finding God;

besides, she's Negro." And "Isn't ir
relevancy heresy?"
True, too, he is a showman. He left
a career in television, but retains a
staccato delivery and affair which
keeps him in the newsreels.
True, finally, he would not com
mand the audience he does were he
not an Episcopal Priest, wearing his
habit to readings he gives at the
hungri i.
Yes, but he still has something to
say: "I'm serious about what I'm do
ing just as I suppose you're serious
about what you're doing."
"I can't talk about God unless I'm
talking about people. I don't see God
as an IBM machine computing minor
sins.
"The church is not being itself
today. It's become a whore in many
ways. It's forgotten that its func

tion is to serve man, rather than to be
the lord of man. There's another Lord.
"I'm not anti-instituion. . . . I'm anti
an idolatry of organization. Every
organization needs a vice-president in
charge of revolution."
What about the after-life and the
resurrection? "I know nothing about
them. . . . We have to define life be
fore we can define after-life."
What about Jesus? "He is my par
ticular faith. Each of us has a faith
of whatever kind. And with the faith
comes a commitment. I'm more con
cerned with the commitment, really."
Boyd wants to break down the
breach between secular and sacred. "I
don't like the word layman and the
word clergyman. They're absurd. The
situation is absurd. . . . There is no
gulf between me as a man and me as
a clargyman."
He moves smoothly from discussion

of the church to what he saw in "the
Watts revolt" to his freedom ride in
Mississippi.
On black power: "I never heard any
thing about white power. Then I
started hearing all this about black
power." The answer is "not to moral
ize and give sermons about black pow
er, but to correct what is wrong with
black power."
Forty-three years old, short and
balding, Boyd gave no formal speech
—or songfest—but responded vigor
ously to questions for forty minutes.
He concluded with reading from his
book, Are You Running With Me,
Jesus?, and from a forthcoming one,
Free to Live, Free to Die.
Malcolm Boyd seems to combine the
virtues of being shocking and being
thoughtful. Said Dean of the Chapel,
B. Davie Napier, by manner of intro
duction, "I'm awfully glad he's here."
