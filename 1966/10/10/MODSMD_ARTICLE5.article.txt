# HEW Secretary Praises Stanford; Warns Of UC As Political Issue
## 
### 
John W. Gardner, Stanford grad
uate and Secretary of Health, Educa
tion, and Welfare, called the Univer
sity of California "one of the two or
three greatest universities in the
world" in a prepared statement at a
press conference here Friday.
Asked later where his own alma
mater ranked, he replied "Stanford is
right up there with the leaders now.
"He cited as evidence the study of
graduate instruction published la6t
spring.
Referring to the fact that Berkeley
has been made a major issue of the
gubernatorial campaign, Gardner

warned "If you make your university
a political football, its days of great
ness are over."
"It's quite possible that the most
significant single achievement of the
people of California since the state
was admitted to the Union is the crea
tion and bringing to maturity of this
great institution. It has had troubles.
But the last place to debate those
troubles or seek to solve them is in
the heat of a political campaign."
Much of the current criticism of
the University of California is an at
tempt to play on the fears and
anxieties of people, "which is po
litically motivated and regrettable"
he said.
Beards
Asked about student unrest and pos
sible communist involvement in the
Berkeley disturbances, Gardner said,
"I don't think that beards, long hair,
or other affectations of dress or man
ner are necessarily a clue to their
character, ability, or future conserva
tive leanings.
"Every campus has to have a cer
tain amount of ferment and it's never
going to take forms that the re
spectable community enjoys," he said.
"Some things that are done and said
on campus I disagree with bitterly.
But I'm not prepared to put labels on
students or categorize them."
"It is the business and tradition of
Communists to fish in troubled wa
ters" he said of Berkeley. "It would
be surprising if they weren't there."
But Gardner concluded he personal
ly has "no evidence" suggesting that
Communists were a decisive factor in
the campus disturbances.
He called California's system of
higher education a model for the en
tire country, and said "the state is
just about 25 years ahead of the rest
of the nation" in this respect.
