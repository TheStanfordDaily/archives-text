## 
### STEVE GRUBER Political Editor 
Ronald Reagan, Republican guber
natorial nominee, blasted Governor
Brown, the California Democratic
Council, the War on Poverty, and poli
ties at Berkeley in a policy speech at
the College of San Mateo Saturday.
Citing Brown's claim that Berkeley
was not an issue in this campaign,
Reagan said "It is an issue. The con
stitution does not allow political in
terference in the University."
He also accused Brown of injecting
politics into the running of Berkeley.
Scholarships
Tuition will have to be charged in
the future at state supported colleges
and universities, according to Reagan.
For students who could not afford
the tuition, Reagan proposed a schol
arship program and deferred pay
ments.
Reagan also criticized the Califor
nia Democratic Council (CDC) ac
cusing that group of taking over the
Democratic party machinery. He said
that most Democrats do not agree
with the CDC.
Reagan denied that he said "A tree
is a tree, once you've seen one you've
seen them all," in reference to the
proposed redwood national park.
Tourist*
A national park would be good be
cause it would bring the tourists Into
that area Reagan continued. "But
let's not have a national park for the
wrong reasons," he said.

California has already saved the
redwoods, Reagan claimed, and the
preservation of the trees is one of *he
greatest triumphs of the state.
Welfare
Welfare programs should be de
signed to eliminate themselves, Rea
gan said. 'They have not done this
and now we have third and fourth
generation Californians still living on
welfare," he said.
'We're attracting people to Califor
nia who don't want to work and they
would rather come here than some
place else," Reagan continued.
To illustrate his point, Reagan told
how a businessman in the Los An
geles area organized 268 other busi
nessmen into a group which has got
ten jobs for 12,000 Watts citizens.
Crime Rate
Governor Brown is responsible for
the recent jump in the crime rate,
ReagAn said. "The rise started when
Brown was elected Attorney Gen
eral," Reagan added.
Law Enforcement
According to Reagan, California
has the finest law enforcement in the
world, but the power of the communi
ties to pass statutes has been usurped.
"Police don't have the weapons they
need," he concluded.
"We should have a Creative Society
in which the government will turn to
the people. We will have a prairie fire
that will sweep across the state—and
we can do thte if we believe in our
selves," he said.

Reagan also criticized the Califor
nia Democratic Council (CDC) ac
cusing that group of taking over the
Democratic party machinery. He said
that most Democrats do not agree
with the CDC.
Reagan denied that he said "A tree
is a tree, once you've seen one you've
seen them all," in reference to the
proposed redwood national park.
Tourist*
A national park would be good be
cause it would bring the tourists Into
that area Reagan continued. "But
let's not have a national park for the
wrong reasons," he said.

California has already saved the
redwoods, Reagan claimed, and the
preservation of the trees is one of *he
greatest triumphs of the state.
Welfare
Welfare programs should be de
signed to eliminate themselves, Rea
gan said. 'They have not done this
and now we have third and fourth
generation Californians still living on
welfare," he said.
'We're attracting people to Califor
nia who don't want to work and they
would rather come here than some
place else," Reagan continued.
To illustrate his point, Reagan told
how a businessman in the Los An
geles area organized 268 other busi
nessmen into a group which has got
ten jobs for 12,000 Watts citizens.
Crime Rate
Governor Brown is responsible for
the recent jump in the crime rate,
ReagAn said. "The rise started when
Brown was elected Attorney Gen
eral," Reagan added.
Law Enforcement
According to Reagan, California
has the finest law enforcement in the
world, but the power of the communi
ties to pass statutes has been usurped.
"Police don't have the weapons they
need," he concluded.
"We should have a Creative Society
in which the government will turn to
the people. We will have a prairie fire
that will sweep across the state—and
we can do thte if we believe in our
selves," he said.

natorial nominee, blasted Governor
Brown, the California Democratic
Council, the War on Poverty, and poli
ties at Berkeley in a policy speech at

stitution does not allow political in
terference in the University."
He also accused Brown of injecting
politics into the running of Berkeley.
Scholarships
Tuition will have to be charged in

ments.
