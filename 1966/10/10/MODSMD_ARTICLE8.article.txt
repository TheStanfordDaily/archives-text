# Committee Of Fifteen Considers Reports On Open House Rules
## 
### CHRIS HARTE Associate Editor 
The Committee of Fifteen began its
study of open house regulations Fri
day and hopes to have a report ready
soon.
According to Professor Philip H.
Rhinelander, who was reelected chair
man of the committee, "We want to
get this done as quickly as we can, but
it's hard to say exactly how long it
will take."
The committee has not set up a sub-

committee to study the problem, as it
generally has in the past.
"As of now, we're going to discuss
this as a full committee," Rhinelander
said, stating that this issue was not
like many of the others because a
committee of the Legislature and a
presidential advisory committee have
both produced substantial reports and
recommendations.
The recommendations of both com
mittees were distributed at the first
meeting of the Committee of Fifteen,
and Rhinelander hopes to be able to

distribute the reports at the next
meeting, scheduled for Friday at 3:30
p.m.
Rhinelander indicated that a sub
committee would be formed only if
needed to study some aspect of the
problem not touched on by these re
ports.
In a related story, the student sum
moned to appear before Judicial
Council tonight on a charge of violat
ing the administration's open house
regulations last spring has been given
a stay, probably until early next week.
He has also asked that his hearing be
open to the public, in accordance with
his rights under Judicial Council pro
cedure.
Student members of the committee,
approved by Legislature Wednesday,
are David Harris, Tom Forstenzer,
Martin Gerry, Jan Handke, and
Charles Dupree.
Faculty members are Professor
Rhinelander; James M. Carlsmith, as
sistant professor of psychology; John
R. McDonough, professor of law;
Ralph Smith, professor of electrical
engineering; and Gordon Wright, pro
fessor of history. Smith was elected
secretary at Friday's meeting.
Administrators are E. Howard
Brooks, vice-provost; Robert Sears,
Dean of Humanities and Sciences;
Joel Smith, Associate Dean of Stu
dents; Robert Walker, director of
general studies and the overseas cam
pus program; and Virgil Whitaker,
Dean of the Graduate Division.

The Committee of Fifteen began its
study of open house regulations Fri
day and hopes to have a report ready
soon.
According to Professor Philip H.
Rhinelander, who was reelected chair
man of the committee, "We want to
get this done as quickly as we can, but
it's hard to say exactly how long it
will take."
The committee has not set up a sub-

committee to study the problem, as it
generally has in the past.
"As of now, we're going to discuss
this as a full committee," Rhinelander
said, stating that this issue was not
like many of the others because a
committee of the Legislature and a
presidential advisory committee have
both produced substantial reports and
recommendations.
The recommendations of both com
mittees were distributed at the first
meeting of the Committee of Fifteen,
and Rhinelander hopes to be able to

distribute the reports at the next
meeting, scheduled for Friday at 3:30
p.m.
Rhinelander indicated that a sub
committee would be formed only if
needed to study some aspect of the
problem not touched on by these re
ports.
