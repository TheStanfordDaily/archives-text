# Board Of Trustees: University Servant?
## 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL (First in a Series) 
(Editor's note. This Ls the first in a six part
series prepared by Stanford Graduate Bruce
Campbell. The series will examine boards of
trustees in A merit tan colleges, and focus on
the Stanford Board in the Latter part of the
series. Campbell's research stems from work
done last spring as part of a Stanford seminar
on higher education in America.)
"Servant of the servants of truth"—a verse
appropriated from ecclesiastical circles and
paraphrased—might provide a description of
a university board of trustees, for the phrase
tells something fundamental both about a
board of trustees and its relationship to a uni
versity.
A university is a group of scholars who
have agreed to engage their intellects over
various subject matters in order to further
the pursuit of truth. The board's task is to
create the environment in which scholarly
activity thrives.
Students of higher education usually list the
principal responsibilities of trustees as these
three: to select a president and having done
so let him run the university; to oversee and

approve the kind of education offered by the
university; to be the final ground of respon
sibility for the acquisition, conservation, and
management of the university's funds and
properties.
Quality of Education
But overriding all specific charges to the
a college, the organization of a learned and
effective faculty."
And Myron Wicke states that "the educa
tional work of the college is the sole reason
for its existence, not the balancing of budgets
nor the building of great plants, important as
these are."
Because the board of trustees can only be
understood in its relation to the university, a
study of the board must begin with an under
standing of the purposes of a university. The
university has a two-fold relation to society:
one of accommodation and the other of criti
cism.
Contract With Society
On one side, the university has entered into
a contract with society in which it preserves
and transmits to the new generation the ac
cumulated knowledge, skills, and values of the
society. The university accepts responsibility

for preparing the new generation to take
charge of running the society. This is the ac
commodating role.
But on the other hand, the university also
has a role in conflict with society; it is con
tinually evaluating the culture which it trans
mits and thus serves as a creative force for
bringing change in the society. This is its role
as critic.
The prevailing structure of boards of trus
tees in the United States tends to be one in
which the first of the two roles is in an over
bearing position relative to the second. The
reason for this is that, in contrast to most
European universities, American education in
stitutions are controlled by laymen.
Without Consent
"Almost without exception in this country,"
says Hubert Beck in Men Who Control Our
Universities, "governing boards exercise their
powers and functions without the consent of
the governed."
The significance of lay control is that, be
cause the dominant groups in society control
board is its general responsibility to assure
that the quality of education in the university
is the finest that the institution can provide.

In the words of a special committee of the
trustees of Columbia University: "Trustees
are a means to an end: in the establishment of
its institutions, universities are controlled by
"the modern representatives of orthodoxy and
authority," the Columbia study notes.
Because a dominant class is one favored by
the existing social arrangement, members of
boards of trustees "tend to be conservative,
to exaggerate the merits of the prevailing
order and to fear any agitation favoring fun
damental changes in the social structure."
To the extent that a university is controlled
by these forces, "its function will be defensive
and conservative, rather than creative and
progressive." In oth6r words, the occommoda
tion function will tend to be more emphasized
than the function of criticism.
Vicious Circles
Control by a lay board can lead to a vicious
circle. Because they are not experts on educa
tion, trustees must either make decisions
based on less-than-complete understandings of
situations or they must relinquish the respon
sibility to those directly involved. The second
is the usual practice, most observers contend.
One result of relinquishing responsibility

for educational policy-making in that this
practice tends to breed among trustees a view
of their role as principally one of administra
tion, rather than education, since they are
concerned mostly with "management" of the
university.
And, generally, administration puts a premi
um of efficiency, the smoothness with which a
system operates. In the university, this leads
to "commodity" education.
Producing - Trained Mind
"There is a cultural assumption in Ameri
ca," on observer has pointed out, "that institu
tions of society produce commodities." The
University produces trained minds, compo
nents for the assembly line of society.
In this type of education, emphasis is placed
on a passive process of preparation. This
leads to people who accept the culture passed
on to them and thus to reinforcement of the
existing structure of society.
Thus, when the university structure tends
to emphasize the accommodating role of the
university over its role as critic, "commodity"
education results, which in turn tends to lead
to further emphasis on accommodation.

standing of the purposes of a university. The
university has a two-fold relation to society:
one of accommodation and the other of criti
cism.
Contract With Society
On one side, the university has entered into
a contract with society in which it preserves
and transmits to the new generation the ac
cumulated knowledge, skills, and values of the
society. The university accepts responsibility

for preparing the new generation to take
charge of running the society. This is the ac
commodating role.
But on the other hand, the university also
has a role in conflict with society; it is con
tinually evaluating the culture which it trans
mits and thus serves as a creative force for
bringing change in the society. This is its role
as critic.
The prevailing structure of boards of trus
tees in the United States tends to be one in
which the first of the two roles is in an over
bearing position relative to the second. The
reason for this is that, in contrast to most
European universities, American education in
stitutions are controlled by laymen.
Without Consent
"Almost without exception in this country,"
says Hubert Beck in Men Who Control Our
Universities, "governing boards exercise their
powers and functions without the consent of
the governed."
The significance of lay control is that, be
cause the dominant groups in society control
board is its general responsibility to assure
that the quality of education in the university
is the finest that the institution can provide.

In the words of a special committee of the
trustees of Columbia University: "Trustees
are a means to an end: in the establishment of
its institutions, universities are controlled by
"the modern representatives of orthodoxy and
authority," the Columbia study notes.
Because a dominant class is one favored by
the existing social arrangement, members of
boards of trustees "tend to be conservative,
to exaggerate the merits of the prevailing
order and to fear any agitation favoring fun
damental changes in the social structure."
To the extent that a university is controlled
by these forces, "its function will be defensive
and conservative, rather than creative and
progressive." In oth6r words, the occommoda
tion function will tend to be more emphasized
than the function of criticism.
Vicious Circles
Control by a lay board can lead to a vicious
circle. Because they are not experts on educa
tion, trustees must either make decisions
based on less-than-complete understandings of
situations or they must relinquish the respon
sibility to those directly involved. The second
is the usual practice, most observers contend.
One result of relinquishing responsibility

for educational policy-making in that this
practice tends to breed among trustees a view
of their role as principally one of administra
tion, rather than education, since they are
concerned mostly with "management" of the
university.
And, generally, administration puts a premi
um of efficiency, the smoothness with which a
system operates. In the university, this leads
to "commodity" education.
Producing - Trained Mind
"There is a cultural assumption in Ameri
ca," on observer has pointed out, "that institu
tions of society produce commodities." The
University produces trained minds, compo
nents for the assembly line of society.
In this type of education, emphasis is placed
on a passive process of preparation. This
leads to people who accept the culture passed
on to them and thus to reinforcement of the
existing structure of society.
Thus, when the university structure tends
to emphasize the accommodating role of the
university over its role as critic, "commodity"
education results, which in turn tends to lead
to further emphasis on accommodation.

"Servant of the servants of truth"—a verse
appropriated from ecclesiastical circles and
paraphrased—might provide a description of
a university board of trustees, for the phrase
tells something fundamental both about a
board of trustees and its relationship to a uni
versity.
A university is a group of scholars who
have agreed to engage their intellects over
various subject matters in order to further
the pursuit of truth. The board's task is to
create the environment in which scholarly
activity thrives.
Students of higher education usually list the
principal responsibilities of trustees as these
three: to select a president and having done
so let him run the university; to oversee and

approve the kind of education offered by the
university; to be the final ground of respon
sibility for the acquisition, conservation, and
management of the university's funds and
properties.

Because a dominant class is one favored by
the existing social arrangement, members of
boards of trustees "tend to be conservative,
to exaggerate the merits of the prevailing
order and to fear any agitation favoring fun
damental changes in the social structure."
To the extent that a university is controlled
by these forces, "its function will be defensive
and conservative, rather than creative and
progressive." In oth6r words, the occommoda
tion function will tend to be more emphasized
than the function of criticism.
Vicious Circles
Control by a lay board can lead to a vicious
circle. Because they are not experts on educa
tion, trustees must either make decisions
based on less-than-complete understandings of
situations or they must relinquish the respon
sibility to those directly involved. The second
is the usual practice, most observers contend.
One result of relinquishing responsibility

for educational policy-making in that this
practice tends to breed among trustees a view
of their role as principally one of administra
tion, rather than education, since they are
concerned mostly with "management" of the
university.
And, generally, administration puts a premi
um of efficiency, the smoothness with which a
system operates. In the university, this leads
to "commodity" education.
Producing - Trained Mind
"There is a cultural assumption in Ameri
ca," on observer has pointed out, "that institu
tions of society produce commodities." The
University produces trained minds, compo
nents for the assembly line of society.
In this type of education, emphasis is placed
on a passive process of preparation. This
leads to people who accept the culture passed
on to them and thus to reinforcement of the
existing structure of society.
Thus, when the university structure tends
to emphasize the accommodating role of the
university over its role as critic, "commodity"
education results, which in turn tends to lead
to further emphasis on accommodation.

Campbell. The series will examine boards of

"Servant of the servants of truth"—a verse
appropriated from ecclesiastical circles and
paraphrased—might provide a description of
a university board of trustees, for the phrase
tells something fundamental both about a
board of trustees and its relationship to a uni
versity.
A university is a group of scholars who
have agreed to engage their intellects over
various subject matters in order to further
the pursuit of truth. The board's task is to
create the environment in which scholarly
activity thrives.
Students of higher education usually list the
principal responsibilities of trustees as these
three: to select a president and having done
so let him run the university; to oversee and

approve the kind of education offered by the
university; to be the final ground of respon
sibility for the acquisition, conservation, and
management of the university's funds and
properties.
Quality of Education
But overriding all specific charges to the
a college, the organization of a learned and
effective faculty."
And Myron Wicke states that "the educa
tional work of the college is the sole reason
for its existence, not the balancing of budgets
nor the building of great plants, important as
these are."
Because the board of trustees can only be
understood in its relation to the university, a
study of the board must begin with an under
standing of the purposes of a university. The
university has a two-fold relation to society:
one of accommodation and the other of criti
cism.
Contract With Society
On one side, the university has entered into
a contract with society in which it preserves
and transmits to the new generation the ac
cumulated knowledge, skills, and values of the
society. The university accepts responsibility

for preparing the new generation to take
charge of running the society. This is the ac
commodating role.
But on the other hand, the university also
has a role in conflict with society; it is con
tinually evaluating the culture which it trans
mits and thus serves as a creative force for
bringing change in the society. This is its role
as critic.
The prevailing structure of boards of trus
tees in the United States tends to be one in
which the first of the two roles is in an over
bearing position relative to the second. The
reason for this is that, in contrast to most
European universities, American education in
stitutions are controlled by laymen.
Without Consent
"Almost without exception in this country,"
says Hubert Beck in Men Who Control Our
Universities, "governing boards exercise their
powers and functions without the consent of
the governed."
The significance of lay control is that, be
cause the dominant groups in society control
board is its general responsibility to assure
that the quality of education in the university
is the finest that the institution can provide.

In the words of a special committee of the
trustees of Columbia University: "Trustees
are a means to an end: in the establishment of
its institutions, universities are controlled by
"the modern representatives of orthodoxy and
