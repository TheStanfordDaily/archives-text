# State Extremism To Be Explored By Alan Cranston
## 
### 
"Extremism in California Pol
itics" will be explored here to
day by Alan Cranston, Califor
nia State Controller since 1958.
Cranston will speak in a Po
litical Union sponsored presenta
tion at 4:15 p.m. in Tresidder's
large lounge. The current split
in California's Democratic Party
will also be covered in his ad
dress.
A Stanford alumnus, the Con
troller was one of the principal
founders and leaders of the con
troversial California Democratic
Council. He was also an unsuc
cessful candidate for the 1964
Democratic nomination for the
U.S. Senate seat now held by Re
publican George Murphy.
Cranston's 1962 re-election to
the Controller position was the
largest victory in California his
tory for a contested office. How
ever, he is usually associated
with his outspoken criticism of
the John Birch society and Its
role in California politics.
Cranston was the author of
the 1945 bestselling novel, "The
Killing of the Peace," and also a
play, "Big Story."
A review he wrote analyzing
the significance of "Mein Kampf"
sold 500,000 copies and prompted
a copyright suit by author
Adolph Hitler. Cranston is the
only American known to have
been sued by the German Fueh
rer.
He will follow his address with
a question and answer period.
