# Scholarship Rules Changed
## 
### 
WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass.
(CPS) â€” Williams College will
no longer base its scholarship
awards on student grade aver
ages, but on need.
For scholarships, freshmen
must complete the year in
"good standing," the Williams
financial aid office announced.
No minimum grade average is
required for freshmen. A soph
omore or junior must attain a
C- average.
Formerly, the higher a stu
dent's marks, the larger the
award.
