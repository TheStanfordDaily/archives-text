## Otto, Crane Battle For WCCL Lead 
### Bob Thieriot Perry Hackett 
Who the hell is Otto?
On January 5, 1964, prospective members of the Western Cali
fornia Casino League met to establish rules and to begin league
play. There had been 26 preliminary games druing the Fail of 1963.
The members agreed to follow the usual Casino regulations cards
are shuffled and cut, the lowest card having the choice of dealing.
Four cards are dealt to each participant and four face up on the
board. In turn each player attempts to get cards by either taking
ones which are on the board with a matching card from his hand—
or adding up combinations of cards on the board to equal the value
of one of the cards in his hand.
The Invisible Shield
Cards may be "built," adding cards on the board to one in the
hand to equal another card in the hand. Since only one card may
be played from the hand at one time, the opponent may "capture"
the build, if he has a matching card in his hand. The Invisible Shield
is said to "have fallen" when a player's build is captured by his
opponent.
If a player cannot make an offensive manuever, either taking a
card from the board or "building," he must discard. When each
player has played the four cards in turn, the dealer deals four ad
ditional cards to each player. The game continues until the deck of
cards runs out. The player to take the last trick is awarded all the
cards remaining on the board at the end of the hand.
Players earn points by: taking a majority of the cards (2 points),
taking a majority of the spades (2 points), or taking any of six
"point cards"—aces (one point apiece), Little Casino, 2 of Spades
(one point), or Big Casino, 10 of Diamonds (2 points). A game is
won when one of the players reaches 50 points.
WCCL Arrives
At the first meeting, all participants agreed that there would be
no set schedule, no admission for spectator attendance, and no
cheating. The convention made plans for an Archives Office
to record all results and tabulate records and standings, and issue
news releases.
The WCCL is the only recognized Casino League on the Stan
ford campus and holds the record for the most organized Casino
games played in one league on University beds.
Who Is Crane?
The infant league at this time has a grand total of two partici
pants—Otto and Crane. They have played 234 league games, with
Crane leading 121-113. There have been memorable days for the
WCCL- like the hand in which Otto got no spades; the day Crane
got only six cards in one deal, which is very difficult to do, but he
got two points (aces) in the process. The heaviest playing day oc
curred last September when the two played fourteen games—some
of them being "double games" with the first one to reach one-hun
dred points receiving credit for two games; the fourteen games con
sumed seven consecutive hours of grueling, tense, exciting, thrilling,
frustrating Casino.
Casino results have been known to provide an omen for unre
lated upcoming events —like final exams. Twice a player has been
wailing during "Dead Week" and continued his streak of luck
during exam week. Besides its recreational merits, Casino fills
those numerous half hour study "breaks."
Both Otto and Crane are Stanford students, who were most instru
mental in establishing the WCCL their freshman year. They have
brought a distinctness to the Stanford campus.
