# Ducks Keyed; Indians Look Toward USC
## 
### JOHN MERRILL 
"They were ready and we
weren't, and I'll take all the
blame for that. I was sure that
we were ready."
In these words, Stanford
Coach John Ralston summed up
the 7-3 defeat by Oregon in the
Stanford locker room after last
Saturday's game.
Ralston said he had to admit
that the Indians were "Out
spirited" though the Ducks pre
sented nothing different on the
field than his staff had expected.
Their Pass Defense
"We knew that they had fine
defensive backs who could react
well to the ball, but we hadn't
planned to pass the ball that
much unless we had to."
As for Stanford's running
game: "They did a good job on
our wide game and we just were
not consistent enough on our in
side attack. They didn't take
anything away from us In par
ticular."
When questioned about the In
dian offensive failures in the
first half particularly, Ralston
stated that Stanford had let Ore
gon get the jump at the outset,
and never did catch up in mo
mentum.
Did We Overlook Oregon?
Perhaps the Indians were look
ing ahead to USC next week?
"With just five games in our
league you don't look ahead. You
do build for certain things and
I thought we were on schedule.
When you bring a team along
like this, it is always hard to
take."
In striking contrast to Coach
Ralston, Len Casanova of Ore
gon, head coach for 16 years,
was ecstatic over the first Duck
victory of the season.
"This is a great bunch of
kids, they stay loose, alert, and
fought like the dickens the
whole game. I can't say enough
for them."
Oregon Was Ready
"We were ready for a good
win .especially after the last
two years of conference play.
You get tired and mad about be
ing called 'losers,' and I just
hope we can keep going now."
Casanova credited a variety of
things for the victory. "We
didn't change much. We taped
one boy's knee differently and
that helped, and a radio broad
cast calling us the 'Oregon
losers' helped, too."
Casanova was surprised that
Stanford didn't have a more po
tent offense, but was pleased at
the fine play of his pass de
fenders. Stanford did not com
plete a pass until the third
quarter.
He summed up the game, "We
were ready, the boys played tre
mendously in every respect."
Coach Ralston, when asked
about next week and the rest of
the season said, 'T'his was a real
setback, but we are looking for
ward to the rest of the confer
ence games. I have no doubt
that the team will be up for the
USC game."


Tom Hazelrigg recovered a fum
ble in last week's game against
Oregon. The 195 !h. defensive
right end captured the ball on
the Duck 24 yard line, and the
Indians moved it to the four.
Bill Shoemaker then kicked
Stanford onto the scoreboard
with a field goal.
