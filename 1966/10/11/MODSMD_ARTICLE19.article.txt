# COACH COMES
## Wrestlers Seek Championship 
### NICK SELBY 
"Maybe winning isn't every
thing, but it sure beats anything
that comes in second." This
statement, posted on the walls
of the wrestling room in Encina
gymnasium, reflects the new de
sire for wrestling prominence at
Stanford.
"We want to put Stanford on
the map as a wrestling power,"
claims new coach Jerry Budzik.
Budzik tells his grapplers not
to be satisfied with making the
Stanford team: "Be an NCAA
champion."
Team Lacks Depth
Budzik admits that he will
have some problems in achiev
-ing his desire. "We have a seri
ous shortage of boys. There are
only 27 out for the team, and
over half of these are fresh
man."
"We need varsity men at 130
lbs., 137 lbs., and 177 lbs. The
freshmen need men at 115 lbs.,
191 lbs., and heavyweight. Ill
nesses could really hurt us, but
we should pick up some football
players."
No Scholarships
Budzik also sees a problem in

the fact that Stanford has no
wrestling scholarships. "It can
be done, though," Budzik says.
"Michigan has developed great
teams under Cliff Keen on just
four scholarships a year."
"I want to prove that if the
boys have the right attitude and
work hard enough, they can be
come very good wrestlers." Bud
zik told his wrestlers that the
only difference between Stan
ford and Oklahoma State (last
year's National champ) was the
attitude of the boys.
"The boys there start wrestling
with the idea that they are na
tional champions."
Budzik is not unfamiliar with
the problem of building a win
ning tradition. When he coached
high school wrestlers in Michi
gan, Budzik started with a team
that had a losing record and
only a three year program. He
produced several state cham
pions.
Wants Winning Tradition
Budzik sees several ways to
start a winning tradition at
Stanford. "Obviously, if we can
establish a winning record with
a few conference champs, we'll

be able to get some momentum
and attract good wrestlers."
Budzik also hopes to have
most valuable wrestler and cap
tain plaques so future grapplers
will have something to emulate.
'Victory Is Sweat*
"Victory is sweat," another
sign proclaims, and the Stanford
wrestlers are fast finding this
out. "When I put you out on the
mat, you'll have two things go
ing for you: you'll be in great
shape and you'll know your
wrestling."
To achieve this end, Budzik
has had his boys hopping and
running up the steps of Stan
ford Stadium, running 15 second
wind sprints ,and doing various
strength building exercises. The
wrestlers drilled on moves,
mostly takedowns, repeatedly
last week.
Follow Oklahoma State
The youthful Budzik, once a
teammate of National Cham
pion coach Myron Roderick,
plans to follow the Oklahoma
State style of wrestling, which
emphazises takedowns and es
capes.
One of Budzik's desires is to

wrestle Oklahoma State, if only
in a quadrangular meet, in the
future. Another western power,
Brigham Young University, is
on the Indians' schedule for next
year.
Budzik sees wrestling as a
great developer of young men.
"It builds self-confidence and
self-discipline, for it takes real
courage to compete on your
own. It also provides extreme
satisfaction for a man."

gymnasium, reflects the new de
sire for wrestling prominence at
Stanford.
"We want to put Stanford on
the map as a wrestling power,"
claims new coach Jerry Budzik.
Budzik tells his grapplers not
to be satisfied with making the
Stanford team: "Be an NCAA
champion."
Team Lacks Depth
Budzik admits that he will
have some problems in achiev
-ing his desire. "We have a seri
ous shortage of boys. There are
only 27 out for the team, and
over half of these are fresh
man."
"We need varsity men at 130
lbs., 137 lbs., and 177 lbs. The
freshmen need men at 115 lbs.,
191 lbs., and heavyweight. Ill
nesses could really hurt us, but
we should pick up some football
players."
No Scholarships
Budzik also sees a problem in

the fact that Stanford has no
wrestling scholarships. "It can
be done, though," Budzik says.
"Michigan has developed great
teams under Cliff Keen on just
four scholarships a year."
"I want to prove that if the
boys have the right attitude and
work hard enough, they can be
come very good wrestlers." Bud
zik told his wrestlers that the
only difference between Stan
ford and Oklahoma State (last
year's National champ) was the
attitude of the boys.
"The boys there start wrestling
with the idea that they are na
tional champions."
Budzik is not unfamiliar with
the problem of building a win
ning tradition. When he coached
high school wrestlers in Michi
gan, Budzik started with a team
that had a losing record and
only a three year program. He
produced several state cham
pions.
Wants Winning Tradition
Budzik sees several ways to
start a winning tradition at
Stanford. "Obviously, if we can
establish a winning record with
a few conference champs, we'll

be able to get some momentum
and attract good wrestlers."
Budzik also hopes to have
most valuable wrestler and cap
tain plaques so future grapplers
will have something to emulate.
'Victory Is Sweat*
"Victory is sweat," another
sign proclaims, and the Stanford
wrestlers are fast finding this
out. "When I put you out on the
mat, you'll have two things go
ing for you: you'll be in great
shape and you'll know your
wrestling."
To achieve this end, Budzik
has had his boys hopping and
running up the steps of Stan
ford Stadium, running 15 second
wind sprints ,and doing various
strength building exercises. The
wrestlers drilled on moves,
mostly takedowns, repeatedly
last week.
Follow Oklahoma State
The youthful Budzik, once a
teammate of National Cham
pion coach Myron Roderick,
plans to follow the Oklahoma
State style of wrestling, which
emphazises takedowns and es
capes.
One of Budzik's desires is to

wrestle Oklahoma State, if only
in a quadrangular meet, in the
future. Another western power,
Brigham Young University, is
on the Indians' schedule for next
year.
Budzik sees wrestling as a
great developer of young men.
"It builds self-confidence and
self-discipline, for it takes real
courage to compete on your
own. It also provides extreme
satisfaction for a man."
"Maybe winning isn't every
thing, but it sure beats anything
that comes in second." This
statement, posted on the walls
of the wrestling room in Encina
gymnasium, reflects the new de
sire for wrestling prominence at
Stanford.
