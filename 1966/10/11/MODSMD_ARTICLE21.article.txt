# Board Of Trustees
## 
### 
For many years Stanford was considered a
center for apathy, and by contrast campus lead
ers are hailing the arrival of an era of committed
awareness, particularly among the student
body. However the current concern for under
graduate education might better be described
as a revival of the critical spirit essential to the
individual's education as well as the vitality of
the University.
President Sterling's announcement last week
provided an encouraging sign that the Univer
sity is formally beginning to implement a criti
cal analysis of undergraduate and graduate edu
cation. At the same time several major depart
ments have demonstrated their willingness to
scrutinize their curricula. Beneath the institu
tional reawakening runs a strong current of stu
dent reevaluation of their role in the University.
Almost untouched, however, by the wave of
self-examination has been the Board of Trus
tees, the University's legal governing body. The
self-perpetuating, twenty-three member body
is responsible for the naming of the President,
all fiduciary matters ,and the general policy of
the University.
The six part series which begins in today's
Daily studies the nature of boards of trustees in
American colleges and goes beyond what Mal
colm Cowley calls the half-truth that boards
are business-dominated instruments of plutoc
racy.
Focusing on Stanford's Board in the latter
parts of the series, Stanford Graduate Bruce
Campbell raises several criticisms of the prac
tices and methods of the Board of Trustees:
concentration of membership, frequency of
meetings, lack of visitors' boards in many areas,
and the overall structure of Board.
The Board presently operates under the com
mittee system and meets every month, except

August. Administrators are hardly finished with
the preparation for one monthly meeting before
they must begin to prepare for the following
session, while trustee agendas are often one
hundred pages thick. The result is often such
that the Board is involved in administrative
matters far beyond the line of broad policy de
cisions. The prolonged debate and trustee visits
which were required to settle the controversy
over Jewish worship on-campus highlight an
issue which might have been decided by the
administration within Board guidelines.
Although the Board has visitors" committees
for Stanford's professional schools, there are no
committees for Humanities and Scences whose
total enrollment numbers over 4500. Members
of the faculty appear regularly before the
Board's Academic Affairs Committee. Yet a sys
tem of visitors' committees, such as the one em
ployed by the Harvard Overseers ,is better able
to provide an account of educational develop
ments in the University.
Again, other universities have found it bene
ficial to diversitfy the membership of their
boards in terms of age, profession, and school
ties. Presently Stanford's Board is composed of
twenty alumni out of the twenty-two seats now
filled; the average age of Board members is
58.6.
During a period in which each segment of
the University is experiencing tremendous
growth and redefinition through critical anal
ysis, we believe it is imperative that the Board
of Trustees, particularly as a self-perpetuating
body, adopt a critical approach to its role in the
life of the University. A formal self-study, such
as the Columbia study which Campbell outlines
would provide the Board an opportunity to ex
amine its procedures and structures critically
in the light of Stanford's changing needs.

of Trustees, particularly as a self-perpetuating
body, adopt a critical approach to its role in the
life of the University. A formal self-study, such
as the Columbia study which Campbell outlines
would provide the Board an opportunity to ex
amine its procedures and structures critically
in the light of Stanford's changing needs.
For many years Stanford was considered a
center for apathy, and by contrast campus lead
ers are hailing the arrival of an era of committed
awareness, particularly among the student
body. However the current concern for under
graduate education might better be described
as a revival of the critical spirit essential to the
individual's education as well as the vitality of
the University.
President Sterling's announcement last week
provided an encouraging sign that the Univer
sity is formally beginning to implement a criti
cal analysis of undergraduate and graduate edu
cation. At the same time several major depart
ments have demonstrated their willingness to
scrutinize their curricula. Beneath the institu
tional reawakening runs a strong current of stu
dent reevaluation of their role in the University.
Almost untouched, however, by the wave of
self-examination has been the Board of Trus
tees, the University's legal governing body. The
self-perpetuating, twenty-three member body
is responsible for the naming of the President,
all fiduciary matters ,and the general policy of
the University.
The six part series which begins in today's
Daily studies the nature of boards of trustees in
American colleges and goes beyond what Mal
colm Cowley calls the half-truth that boards
are business-dominated instruments of plutoc
racy.
Focusing on Stanford's Board in the latter
parts of the series, Stanford Graduate Bruce
Campbell raises several criticisms of the prac
tices and methods of the Board of Trustees:
concentration of membership, frequency of
meetings, lack of visitors' boards in many areas,
and the overall structure of Board.
The Board presently operates under the com
mittee system and meets every month, except

August. Administrators are hardly finished with
the preparation for one monthly meeting before
they must begin to prepare for the following
session, while trustee agendas are often one
hundred pages thick. The result is often such
that the Board is involved in administrative
matters far beyond the line of broad policy de
cisions. The prolonged debate and trustee visits
which were required to settle the controversy
over Jewish worship on-campus highlight an
issue which might have been decided by the
administration within Board guidelines.
Although the Board has visitors" committees
for Stanford's professional schools, there are no
committees for Humanities and Scences whose
total enrollment numbers over 4500. Members
of the faculty appear regularly before the
Board's Academic Affairs Committee. Yet a sys
tem of visitors' committees, such as the one em
ployed by the Harvard Overseers ,is better able
to provide an account of educational develop
ments in the University.
Again, other universities have found it bene
ficial to diversitfy the membership of their
boards in terms of age, profession, and school
ties. Presently Stanford's Board is composed of
twenty alumni out of the twenty-two seats now
filled; the average age of Board members is
58.6.
During a period in which each segment of
the University is experiencing tremendous
growth and redefinition through critical anal
ysis, we believe it is imperative that the Board
of Trustees, particularly as a self-perpetuating
body, adopt a critical approach to its role in the
life of the University. A formal self-study, such
