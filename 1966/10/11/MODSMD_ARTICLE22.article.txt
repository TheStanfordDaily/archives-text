## Off-Campus Issue Rouses Coeds; Advantages Overshadow Equality 
### PELL FENDER Pell Fender 
Miss Janet Howell has finally
touched upon an issue which has
which is elementary to a ma
turely functioning female: the
option to live where one pleases.
The disadvantages of living at
Stanford's instituionalized rabbit
hutches are many: first of all,
one pays an exhorbitant amount
of money for a bevy of hired
help; after all one is probably
>id enough to clean her own
ioom properly.
.Secondly, the board bill, re
quired of all females who do not
hash, is an overpayment for
starchy, bland, Reader's Digest
recipes. Thirdly, any entertain
ment of a male, except for the
fhoughtfully planned Wednes
day night and Sunday afternoon
pen houses, is forced to occur
in sterile lounges which resem
ble waiting rooms more than
ozy living rooms.
Higher Plane
Objections on a slightly plane
are obvious. It is about time that
the privileges (rights?) granted
to males at this University, and
privileges granted to females in
other areas of university life
descend upon the choice of one's
housing. Certainly a girl can
function without an umbilical
chord somewhat under the age
of 23.
Hoskins House has provided
some relief (as evidenced by
probably the longest university
waiting list). Though the orig

inal girls thrown out of Union
Residence complained that the
benefits of their former resi
dence (one of the few examples
of a worthwhile dormitory ar
rangement) would be lost in
Hoskins House.
Indeed they were, but the re
sulting independence and rela
tive autonomy seem quite to
have corrected for the fears of
the ex-Union females. However,
the University cannot feasibly
replace Florence Moores with
Hosping Houses.
Sophisticated Cynics
The trouble is, no one knows
precisely why the University re
quires that females live on cam
pus until the age of 23. Cynics
will initially conclude that the
decision has a moral basis; this
is probably not the major objec
tion. More sophisticated cynics
will recall that Stanford is run
like a business, and so it must
be.
But Stanford has rarely con
sidered that the running of a
business should be geared to
student needs, which are often
unbusinesslike and not always
incorporative of Big Business.
Yes, Virginia, Stanford would
lose a helluva lot of money if
you move off campus, for each
one of you moving off, roughtly
$1000 (gross) per year less
would tumble into University
coffers. Jobs would be lost. We
could not construct a new build
ing in sanitation engineering,

and the daisies would go un
tended.
Nonetheless, as Jane Howell
understands, the thing is worth
a try. But, as was true of every
other accomplishment hammered
out over the past three years,
student pressure is a must; until
an outrage is made, the powers
that-be assume that Stanford
has an option on Harvard.
Cute And Polite
Here are some suggestions:
Kiss off the petitionsâ€”they are
thought to be cute and polite by
those who receive them, but
rarely convincing. Secondly,
force the administration to
specify all of its reasons for re
taining female feudalism on
campus. Thirdly, have a date-in
or sleep-out or some mechanism
by which student solidarity of a
rather serious purpose can be
made manifest.
Finally, Dave Harris, rage!
Make an issue which forces
everyone concerned both to
think and act. We may find
that some people in the adminis
tration are quite sympathetic
and and need only student pres
sure to release their own ideas.
This is a keenly important
matter. For those females who
cannot afford high prices, for
those females who value inter
action at a level somewhat high
er than the house meeting, and
for those females not overly im
pressed by campus life, Stan
ford's living alternatives are
wretchedly inadequate.
