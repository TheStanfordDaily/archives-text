## Rabine Confuses Goals With Gall 
### 
SB
Editor, The Daily:
If Stanford University is go
ing to exist in a relative amount
of greatness for years to come,
a few relationships must be
made more solid. Any letter,
such as Merle Rabine's, in which
dissention, a worthwhile and
useful tool, is replaced by unar
gumentable anger will accom
plish nothing but more friction.
Our administration may not be
flawless, but if it requires
change, why not attempt to se
cure it while recalling the basic
need for compatability. Too
many dissenters are living quite
selfishly for the present and
themselves. This may not be
your case, and, if so, use your
head and initiate more trust on
the students' part. This method
could lead to, not only solu
tions, but solutions from the stu
dents. Never give away your
trust. If all else fails you will
still have that bond.

Congratulations to Merle Ra

himself King of the Kinder
garten—meanwhile, back at the
University . . .

Editor, The Dally:
With respect to Merle Rabine's
letter in Wednesday's Dal If: I
am wholly in favor of having a
coffee house at Stanford, and in
sympathy with those who are
making a serious effort to estab
lish one. However, I seriously
doubt that gratuitiously insult
ing letters such as Mr. Rabine's
contribute much to this effort.
After all, until the Glorious Rev
olution that Mr. Rabine so con
fidently awaits actually occurs,
students do have to deal with the
existing administration ,and a
modicum of diplomacy on both
sides is, to say the least, help
ful. My impression is that Mr.
Rabine is more interested in
sounding off than he is in ac
complishing his supposed object.

• Major Policy
Editor, The Daily:
I was stirred by Ronald Rea
gan's "major policy speech"
which I heard Saturday at the
College of San Mateo; yet I
could not help feeling that the
trappings were perhaps more
important than the horse itself.
The high school cheerleaders—
"R, E, . . . come on, let's really
hear it!" The invocation, the
pledge of allegiance, the intro
ductions: "The New York Times
has told the people of California
to vote for Brown. This is carpet
bagging in its lowest form!"
(laughter and applause). The
minor candidates: "The incum
bent has been in office since
a few years after I was born. I
think we need some new blood!"
The play money handed out for
Ivy Baker Priest, candidate for
state treasurer: "Ivy has the ex
perience to safeguard your
money in Sacramento!"

"I see there are some stu
dents in the audience," Reagan
said, looking out at signs "Bum
baby burn," "Hitler is alive and
running for governor," "Say
something — anything — please
do." Reagan looked as though
he was about to say something
but it turned out to be about
Berkeley instead. Watts, Viet
nam—these were the trappings,
mentioned but not discussed.
A perfect setting for a speech
less speech—hygienic new build
ings, swimming pools, a freeway
to the front door, the view of
the bay and hills crowned with
sprawling houses—an American
dream.

• ROTC Rigamarole
Editor, The Daily:
Having read Thomas Gris
som's article, "Army Hits Stan
ford" in the Commitment, I am
absolutely incensed at the ad
ministration for such incredible
bungling. Since when does this
institution entrust replies to
serious inquiry to the Stanford
Police Department?
That three students took their
responsibilities seriously enough
to make a persistent attempt to
discover what the purpose of all
these Army Officers was on
their campus is an action to be
highly commended. Others, like
myself, were considerably defi
cient in assuming some inane
ROTC function to be in prog
ress without further inquiry.
How the students refrained
from belligerent rage at having
their questions brought to the
Police Department under the
guise of interrupting classes is
beyond me.
Of all the places in this coun
try for the army to instruct its
men, only the army could say
why a university would be
chosen. But why of all the soul
pandering activities a univer
sity must engage in to maintain
its existence, must it provide
these facilities and discourage
—if not intimidate—those wish
ing to learn about them is a
question which demands an an
swer, particularly of the uni
versity of which we are, in the
word of Dean Smith "technical
ly" students.

With respect to Merle Rabine's
letter in Wednesday's Dal If: I
am wholly in favor of having a
coffee house at Stanford, and in
sympathy with those who are
making a serious effort to estab
lish one. However, I seriously
doubt that gratuitiously insult
ing letters such as Mr. Rabine's
contribute much to this effort.
After all, until the Glorious Rev
olution that Mr. Rabine so con
fidently awaits actually occurs,
students do have to deal with the
existing administration ,and a
modicum of diplomacy on both
sides is, to say the least, help
ful. My impression is that Mr.
Rabine is more interested in
sounding off than he is in ac
complishing his supposed object.

Editor, The Daily:
I was stirred by Ronald Rea
gan's "major policy speech"
which I heard Saturday at the
College of San Mateo; yet I
could not help feeling that the
trappings were perhaps more
important than the horse itself.
The high school cheerleaders—
"R, E, . . . come on, let's really
hear it!" The invocation, the
pledge of allegiance, the intro
ductions: "The New York Times
has told the people of California
to vote for Brown. This is carpet
bagging in its lowest form!"
(laughter and applause). The
minor candidates: "The incum
bent has been in office since
a few years after I was born. I
think we need some new blood!"
The play money handed out for
Ivy Baker Priest, candidate for
state treasurer: "Ivy has the ex
perience to safeguard your
money in Sacramento!"

"I see there are some stu
dents in the audience," Reagan
said, looking out at signs "Bum
baby burn," "Hitler is alive and
running for governor," "Say
something — anything — please
do." Reagan looked as though
he was about to say something
but it turned out to be about
Berkeley instead. Watts, Viet
nam—these were the trappings,
mentioned but not discussed.
A perfect setting for a speech
less speech—hygienic new build
ings, swimming pools, a freeway
to the front door, the view of
the bay and hills crowned with
sprawling houses—an American
dream.

Having read Thomas Gris
som's article, "Army Hits Stan
ford" in the Commitment, I am
absolutely incensed at the ad
ministration for such incredible
bungling. Since when does this
institution entrust replies to
serious inquiry to the Stanford
Police Department?
That three students took their
responsibilities seriously enough
to make a persistent attempt to
discover what the purpose of all
these Army Officers was on
their campus is an action to be
highly commended. Others, like
myself, were considerably defi
cient in assuming some inane
ROTC function to be in prog
ress without further inquiry.
How the students refrained
from belligerent rage at having
their questions brought to the
Police Department under the
guise of interrupting classes is
beyond me.
Of all the places in this coun
try for the army to instruct its
men, only the army could say
why a university would be
chosen. But why of all the soul
pandering activities a univer
sity must engage in to maintain
its existence, must it provide
these facilities and discourage
—if not intimidate—those wish
ing to learn about them is a
question which demands an an
swer, particularly of the uni
versity of which we are, in the
word of Dean Smith "technical

Editor, The Dally:
With respect to Merle Rabine's
letter in Wednesday's Dal If: I
am wholly in favor of having a
coffee house at Stanford, and in
sympathy with those who are
making a serious effort to estab
lish one. However, I seriously
doubt that gratuitiously insult
ing letters such as Mr. Rabine's
contribute much to this effort.
After all, until the Glorious Rev
olution that Mr. Rabine so con
fidently awaits actually occurs,
students do have to deal with the
existing administration ,and a
modicum of diplomacy on both
sides is, to say the least, help
ful. My impression is that Mr.
Rabine is more interested in
sounding off than he is in ac
complishing his supposed object.

• Major Policy
Editor, The Daily:
I was stirred by Ronald Rea
gan's "major policy speech"
which I heard Saturday at the
College of San Mateo; yet I
could not help feeling that the
trappings were perhaps more
important than the horse itself.
The high school cheerleaders—
"R, E, . . . come on, let's really
hear it!" The invocation, the
pledge of allegiance, the intro
ductions: "The New York Times
has told the people of California
to vote for Brown. This is carpet
bagging in its lowest form!"
(laughter and applause). The
minor candidates: "The incum
bent has been in office since
a few years after I was born. I
think we need some new blood!"
The play money handed out for
Ivy Baker Priest, candidate for
state treasurer: "Ivy has the ex
perience to safeguard your
money in Sacramento!"

"I see there are some stu
dents in the audience," Reagan
said, looking out at signs "Bum
baby burn," "Hitler is alive and
running for governor," "Say
something — anything — please
do." Reagan looked as though
he was about to say something
but it turned out to be about
Berkeley instead. Watts, Viet
nam—these were the trappings,
mentioned but not discussed.
A perfect setting for a speech
less speech—hygienic new build
ings, swimming pools, a freeway
to the front door, the view of
the bay and hills crowned with
sprawling houses—an American
dream.

• ROTC Rigamarole
Editor, The Daily:
Having read Thomas Gris
som's article, "Army Hits Stan
ford" in the Commitment, I am
absolutely incensed at the ad
ministration for such incredible
bungling. Since when does this
institution entrust replies to
serious inquiry to the Stanford
Police Department?
That three students took their
responsibilities seriously enough
to make a persistent attempt to
discover what the purpose of all
these Army Officers was on
their campus is an action to be
highly commended. Others, like
myself, were considerably defi
cient in assuming some inane
ROTC function to be in prog
ress without further inquiry.
How the students refrained
from belligerent rage at having
their questions brought to the
Police Department under the
guise of interrupting classes is
beyond me.
Of all the places in this coun
try for the army to instruct its
men, only the army could say
why a university would be
chosen. But why of all the soul
pandering activities a univer
sity must engage in to maintain
its existence, must it provide
these facilities and discourage
—if not intimidate—those wish
ing to learn about them is a
question which demands an an
swer, particularly of the uni
versity of which we are, in the
word of Dean Smith "technical
ly" students.

What would you say about
a paper which ran as its main
headline "Committee Forced To
Subpoena Names of Com

What's fair's fair. If namecall
ing is wrong for McCarthy or
Pool, it's wrong for you too.
ERIC STIETZEL

Editor, The Daily:
If Stanford University is go
ing to exist in a relative amount
of greatness for years to come,
a few relationships must be
made more solid. Any letter,
such as Merle Rabine's, in which
dissention, a worthwhile and
useful tool, is replaced by unar
gumentable anger will accom
plish nothing but more friction.
Our administration may not be
flawless, but if it requires
change, why not attempt to se
cure it while recalling the basic
need for compatability. Too
many dissenters are living quite
selfishly for the present and
themselves. This may not be
your case, and, if so, use your
head and initiate more trust on
the students' part. This method
could lead to, not only solu
tions, but solutions from the stu
dents. Never give away your
trust. If all else fails you will
still have that bond.
