# Frats Hold Symposium In Search Of 'New Voice'
## 
### LIZ EMERY 
Plans for strengthening the fratern
ity voice at Stanford in the next year
were discussed at a meeting of rep
resentatives from Stanford's twenty
two fraternities and several faculty
members and administrators.
Meeting last Friday night at Del
Rio Lodge in Carmel, the group de
bated the fraternities' role In a resi
dential community. Both the successes
and problems in meeting the chal
lenges inherent in a fraternity system
were analyzed.
Dr. James Watkins of the Political
Science Department stressed the "need
for small group living" in the Stan
ford community, which is attracting
more and more the "intellectual who
typically is concerned with ideas and
movements and not with people."
Dr. Lawrence Benningson said that
this need for freshmen to find small
living groups must be met in three
ways: by exposing freshmen to the
different types of upperclass living;
by getting to know the freshmen;
and by letting the freshmen know
the fraternity members. He stated
that fraternity rush had failed in the
last two goals.
Open Rush
Dr. Benningson suggested an "open
rush policy," whereby freshmen would
take the initiative. Meal exchanges,
informal parties, or even unexpected
visits by freshmen to fraternity houses
would take the place of formal rush
parties.
The fraternity representatives pres
ent were largely in favor of the sug
gestions. Interfraternity Council's
President, Drennan Jones, commented
that "Fraternities are going to work
for a more informal rush, getting
away from the back-slapping, hand
shaking, coat and tie formalities"
which have typified Stanford's fra
ternity rush in the past.
Dr. Robert G. Gordon, Associate
Dean of Students, suggested that "a
fraternity is more an attitude than an
organization" and that the powerful
potential contributions of fraternities
to the Stanford community can only
be fully realized by expressing this
attitude outside their own houses.
Think And Drinks
In discussion groups after Dr. Gor
don's speech, ideas of how fraternities
can participate more actively in the
Stanford community ranged from
having more "think and drinks" to or
ganizing and strongly supporting
community service projects.
I* was suggested that some of the

money now spent on social rush func
tions could be better spent on a de
tailed study of the potential functions
of living groups, including fraterni
ties, in a residential university such
as Stanford.
Perhaps the most impressive aspect
of this conference was the enthusiasm
and cooperation of its participants.
Their willingness to air individual
problems and failures and together to

attempt to improve is indicative of
their belief that a stronger fraternity
system is possible through coopera
tion of individual fraternities.
Members expressed confidence that
if the enthusiasm generated at that
weekend retreat can be communicated
to the members of Stanford fraterni
ties, their goals will be realized and
indeed "a new voice" will be heard
at Stanford.

were analyzed.
Dr. James Watkins of the Political
Science Department stressed the "need
for small group living" in the Stan
ford community, which is attracting
more and more the "intellectual who
typically is concerned with ideas and
movements and not with people."
Dr. Lawrence Benningson said that
this need for freshmen to find small
living groups must be met in three
ways: by exposing freshmen to the
different types of upperclass living;
by getting to know the freshmen;
and by letting the freshmen know
the fraternity members. He stated
that fraternity rush had failed in the
last two goals.
Open Rush
Dr. Benningson suggested an "open
rush policy," whereby freshmen would
take the initiative. Meal exchanges,
informal parties, or even unexpected
visits by freshmen to fraternity houses
would take the place of formal rush
parties.
The fraternity representatives pres
ent were largely in favor of the sug
gestions. Interfraternity Council's
President, Drennan Jones, commented
that "Fraternities are going to work
for a more informal rush, getting
away from the back-slapping, hand
shaking, coat and tie formalities"
which have typified Stanford's fra
ternity rush in the past.
Dr. Robert G. Gordon, Associate
Dean of Students, suggested that "a
fraternity is more an attitude than an
organization" and that the powerful
potential contributions of fraternities
to the Stanford community can only
be fully realized by expressing this
attitude outside their own houses.
Think And Drinks
In discussion groups after Dr. Gor
don's speech, ideas of how fraternities
can participate more actively in the
Stanford community ranged from
having more "think and drinks" to or
ganizing and strongly supporting
community service projects.
I* was suggested that some of the

money now spent on social rush func
tions could be better spent on a de
tailed study of the potential functions
of living groups, including fraterni
ties, in a residential university such
as Stanford.
Perhaps the most impressive aspect
of this conference was the enthusiasm
and cooperation of its participants.
Their willingness to air individual
problems and failures and together to

attempt to improve is indicative of
their belief that a stronger fraternity
system is possible through coopera
tion of individual fraternities.
Members expressed confidence that
if the enthusiasm generated at that
weekend retreat can be communicated
to the members of Stanford fraterni
ties, their goals will be realized and
indeed "a new voice" will be heard
at Stanford.
Plans for strengthening the fratern
ity voice at Stanford in the next year
were discussed at a meeting of rep
resentatives from Stanford's twenty
two fraternities and several faculty
members and administrators.
Meeting last Friday night at Del
Rio Lodge in Carmel, the group de
bated the fraternities' role In a resi
dential community. Both the successes
and problems in meeting the chal
lenges inherent in a fraternity system
were analyzed.
