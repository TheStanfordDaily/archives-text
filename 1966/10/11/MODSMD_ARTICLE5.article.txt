# SOS To Aid Service Groups, Coordinate Community Projects
## 
### 
A service organization to help ser
vice organizations is being started at
Stanford this fall.
Service Opportunities for Students
(SOS) will act as a coordinating cen
ter for information on community ac
tion projects open to people at Stan
ford.
According to Marilyn Jensen, presi
dent of a Stanford Y group which
originally proposed the program, in
terested persons could come to SOS
for information on all aspects of so
cial action.
Starting Projects
"Those interested in initiating proj
ects could come to SOS for support
and direction," she commented, "as
well as information concerning com

munity need, transportation and in
surance matters."
SOS would be a place on campus
where outside agencies and institu
tions could make their needs known
to those on campus willing to assist.
A committee is being formed this
week to work out organizational mat
ters and set up the SOS office. Inter
ested students are asked to arrange
an interview time with Marilyn Jen
sen or Carol Young, Director of the
Stanford Y. Interviews will be held be
tween four and six Wednesday after
noon upstairs in the Clubhouse (Old
Union),
"This is just a start," commented
Marilyn. "We're not sure yet how far

we can carry this project. We talked
to Dave Harris and a number of ser
vice organizations and people seem to
be enthusiastic about our plans.
H*ld Peace Corps
"For Instance," she went on, "the
Peace Corps is interested in getting
their trainees involved in community
action, but they often just don't
know where to go to offer their help.
This is an area where SOS can be
quite valuable.
"There is often a problem with
duplicated effortsâ€”service organiza
tions aren't sure what other service
organizations are doing. At SOS we
would have fil<>s to show all the proj
ects currently in operation."
