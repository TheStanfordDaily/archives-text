# Cuthbertson Reveals Gifts To University Decreasing
## 
### CHARLOTTE ACKERLY 
Gifts to the University have fallen
twenty per cent from last year, but
Dave Harris apparently does not ac
count for the decrease.
According to Ken Cuthbertson, Vice-
President in Charge of Finance, a
number of other factors have caused

the drop in income.
"It's impossible to attribute the de
crease to student activism or discon
tent over the election of Harris," he
said. "Totals were taken on the last
set of contributions before Harris was
ever elected, so the fall-off cannot be
a result of his election."

Cuthbertson pointed out that much
of the apparent decrease is relative.
"It looks as if contributions have
fallen drastically," he commented,
"but this is because we are compar
ing them to the PACE years which
saw a fantastic jump in income."
Cuthbertson—and many other Uni
versity officials —do not expect to lose
alumni money this year or next be
cause of activism on the campus, al
though Cuthbertson said prospective
donors "frequently" ask University
representatives about Harris and the
student situation at Stanford.
Explaining Activism
"We often spend about two and a
half hours trying to explain the kind
of activism and the kind of attitude
which has come to this campus since
an alumni-donor has graduated," the
Vice-President said. And, according to
the volunteers who solicit funds for
Stanford, there are many things older
people find difficult to understand.
"When people came here in thp
twenties and thirties," he commented,
"they didn't question anything, as stu
dents these days feel obligated to do."
He pointed out that it was often
too risky to protest too loudly during
the period between the wars. "The
depression came right during our
most sensitive years," he explained.
(Cuthbertson is a former Stanford
student body president.) "The immed
iate concern for everybody was get
ting out and getting a job. The most
important result of four years of
school here was a string of good rec
ommendations.
"We just couldn't afford to be reb
els," he added.
"Just as everybody started to pull
out of the depression and began t<
think about different matters, we were
plunged right into the second world
war. There was a lot of insecurity
everywhere and people tended to con
form."
Trade And Charm School
Cuthbertson said that the same peo
pie who worked so hard to get jobs
years ago cannot understand the grow
ing disdain among students for "trade
schools" and "charm schools." They
are anxious to ask about it and under
stand it, but he said it was often a
difficult process.
He also pointed out that many
alumni in Southern California —where
"northerners" are often considered
snobs—are "razzed by their Southern
Cal and UCLA friends about the radi
cals at Stanford."
"After a while it gets tiresome,"
he said. "You can't blame them for
asking about Harris."
Alums Understand
Cuthbertson said that although
the alumni question many of the new
regulations and attitudes now at Stan
ford, the great majority sympathize
with efforts to make Stanford educa
tion meaningful to those now involved
in it.
"We here must do what is honest
and right," he stated, "and then at
tempt to sell it to the outside world.
We find that when all the people in
the University are obviously making
an honest effort to solve the difficult
problems of education, the alumni
tend to understand.
"However, if the same thing had
happened here as happened at Berke
ley with the Free Speech Movement,
I would not have been surprised if
contributions had fallen.
"We have to emphasize communica
tion," he added. "We have to tell the
truth about what's going on here so
alumni can have the opportunity to
understand."
Budgets Not Cut
Cuthbertson denied reports that all
department budgets had been cut ten
per cent because of last year's drop
in contributions. He said the "rate of
budget expansion" was cut, but that
many departments were actually re
ceiving more money than before.
He also said the summer stock
market slump may have some long
range effect on contributions, "But,"
he concluded, "discounting PACE
years, we expect an all-time high in
donations next year."
