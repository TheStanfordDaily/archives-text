# Advisory Committee Joins ASSU Group
## 
### CHRIS HARTE Associate Editor 
In an unprecedented move, an ad
visory committee to the Dean's office
dissolved itself yesterday and ac
cepted an invitation to become part of
an ASSU commission.
Members of the advisory committee
on freshman residence voted 6-1 to
follow Housing Commission co-chair
man Jan Jacobi's request that they
join the commission's subcommittee
on freshman housing.
The advisory committee was orig
inally set up when President Sterling
asked Robert Gordon, Associate Dean
of Students for Counseling and Resi
dential Education, to submit a report
December 15 on changes which should
be made in freshman residences by
next September.
Residence Plan Needed
Jacobi proposed than any recom
mendations, no matter how small in
scope could not be made without
some idea of an overall plan for all
residential education at Stanford. He
said the Housing Commission's study
would cover every area of housing and
would go to a greater depth in each
of them, and suggested that anything
less than this combination of breadth
and depth was inadequate.

Dean of the Chapel B. Davie Napier
and others present expressed the fear
that if the advisory committee dis
solved itself the Dean's office might
set up another committee or might
simply regard as less significant the
study the ASSU subcommittee pro
duced.
Dean Gordon assured them, how
ever, that if the committee his office
had set up thought it should work
in a different manner that decision
was acceptable to him and would in
no way alter the weight he gave the
final report.
Dr. Maurice Osborne, executive di
rector of the Health Service and co
chairman of the new subcommittee,
expressed high hopes both for the
subcommittee's study and the impact
of the combination.
Reversal
"The idea that, at the invitation of
an already constituted student group,
a dean's committee join the group is
not only a great departure from the
current trend but quite possibly may
be the reversal of it."
Each of the Housing Commission's
six subcommittees presently plans to
include faculty and administration
members.
Members of the ASSU subcommit
tee who also were on the advisory
committee are Dr. Osborne, Dean
Napier, Elizabeth Cohen of the
Education Department, Max Levin,
associate director of the Institute for
the Study of Human Problems, Judy
Bader, Chris Harte and Barbara Levin.
Other members are Scott Soames,
Wilbur head sponsor, co-chairman;
Kate Nichols, and Dave Koval.

asked Robert Gordon, Associate Dean
of Students for Counseling and Resi
dential Education, to submit a report
December 15 on changes which should
be made in freshman residences by
next September.
Residence Plan Needed
Jacobi proposed than any recom
mendations, no matter how small in
scope could not be made without
some idea of an overall plan for all
residential education at Stanford. He
said the Housing Commission's study
would cover every area of housing and
would go to a greater depth in each
of them, and suggested that anything
less than this combination of breadth
and depth was inadequate.

Dean of the Chapel B. Davie Napier
and others present expressed the fear
that if the advisory committee dis
solved itself the Dean's office might
set up another committee or might
simply regard as less significant the
study the ASSU subcommittee pro
duced.
Dean Gordon assured them, how
ever, that if the committee his office
had set up thought it should work
in a different manner that decision
was acceptable to him and would in
no way alter the weight he gave the
final report.
Dr. Maurice Osborne, executive di
rector of the Health Service and co
chairman of the new subcommittee,
expressed high hopes both for the
subcommittee's study and the impact
of the combination.
Reversal
"The idea that, at the invitation of
an already constituted student group,
a dean's committee join the group is
not only a great departure from the
current trend but quite possibly may
be the reversal of it."
Each of the Housing Commission's
six subcommittees presently plans to
include faculty and administration
members.
Members of the ASSU subcommit
tee who also were on the advisory
committee are Dr. Osborne, Dean
Napier, Elizabeth Cohen of the
Education Department, Max Levin,
associate director of the Institute for
the Study of Human Problems, Judy
Bader, Chris Harte and Barbara Levin.
Other members are Scott Soames,
Wilbur head sponsor, co-chairman;
Kate Nichols, and Dave Koval.
In an unprecedented move, an ad
visory committee to the Dean's office
dissolved itself yesterday and ac
cepted an invitation to become part of
an ASSU commission.
Members of the advisory committee
on freshman residence voted 6-1 to
follow Housing Commission co-chair
man Jan Jacobi's request that they
join the commission's subcommittee
on freshman housing.
The advisory committee was orig
inally set up when President Sterling
asked Robert Gordon, Associate Dean
of Students for Counseling and Resi
dential Education, to submit a report
December 15 on changes which should
be made in freshman residences by
next September.
