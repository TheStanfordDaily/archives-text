# Stillman House Carried Away
## 
### P. VERGILIUS MARO 
They might have called it a re-enact
ment of the rape of the Sabine
women, but it wasn't Rome and the
consequences weren't quite so drastic.
Last night shortly before sunset,
members of Sigma Chi were seen
transporting all movable belongings
of Stillman residence to their house—
chairs, sofas, and—dollies.
The sight of twenty-five Stanford
row girls being trundled down Lasuen
Street attracted a large crowd, includ
ing the Stanford police department.
This was no unprovoked act of vio
lence. The invasion of Stillman House
was prompted by a predawn painting
session which left the front of the
Sigma Chi house decorated with
dainty daisies in various pastel shades
and various other messages of endear
ment.
Unfortunately the brotherhood was
not appreciative of the stunning con
trast which the girls' brushes had so
delicately created.
And so shortly after dinner, the men
of Sigma Chi descended upon Still
man to take hostages and booty until
their residence was returned to its
once pearly white.
The Stanford police arrived just In
time to enjoy the parade of wet Still
man girls exiting from the front
door of the Sigma Chi house. The
officer found the whole affair rather
amusing, and by this point most of
the Row was joining the joke.
