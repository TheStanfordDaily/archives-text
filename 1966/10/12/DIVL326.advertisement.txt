Los linli os Tubojtiros BglBH
In this new album, Los Indios Tabajaras
once again display their remarkable 112
talents as they set a mellow mood for
romance with their tender renditions of
Time Goes By," "La Mer," "Who Can
I Turn To," "Make Believe," "The Song
Is Ended," "Time Was" and 6 more
favorites. The mood is mellow, the setting V
is romantic, the listening is great.
