If your girl friend buys
THE COLLEGIATE GUIDE TO SAN FRANCISCO,
what is she trying to tell you?
She's trying to say that she's tired of the usual movies, fraternity parties, and
study dates.
Maybe she'd like a candle-lit, atmospheric dinner in one of San Francisco's great
restaurants (you'll like our budget section). And afterwards maybe a discotheque
or a pub or a coffee house.
And then? Well, our guidebook doesn't have all the answers.
So if your little black book needs revision, try our little red book. It's only a dollar.
Written by students for students.

If your girl friend buys
THE COLLEGIATE GUIDE TO SAN FRANCISCO,
what is she trying to tell you?
She's trying to say that she's tired of the usual movies, fraternity parties, and
study dates.
Maybe she'd like a candle-lit, atmospheric dinner in one of San Francisco's great
restaurants (you'll like our budget section). And afterwards maybe a discotheque
or a pub or a coffee house.
And then? Well, our guidebook doesn't have all the answers.
So if your little black book needs revision, try our little red book. It's only a dollar.
Written by students for students.
