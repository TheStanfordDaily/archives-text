HAVE A DATE EVERY
SATURDAY NIGHT
You'll finally be able to afford to, if you get
a Honda.
Trade in your gas-eater for a thrifty Honda
50. Up to 200 miles per gallon, and at least
that many laughs. Maybe more.
Hondas are just the ticket for campus traffic
and campus parking, and you'll notice a big
difference in your pocketbook, too. It'll
bulge for a change.
And so will your date book.
