# Trustees Fail To Represent Entire Society
## 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL (Second in a Series) 
Boards of trustees of American universities
are severely criticized for being representa
tive neither of the times in which they live
nor of the classes of society as a whole.
They are not representative of the times,
critics say, because, being composed of people
with an average age of 60, they tend to em
phasize established parts of the culture over
and against new and incipient parts. And they
do not represent society as a whole because
they come predominantly from only one seg
ment of American society: the class that con
trols the business world.
Given these criticisms, this article will seek
to determine the ideal composition of a Board.
We will look first at some characteristics of a
good trustee and then present some considera
tions as to what constitutes an ideal board.
Deep Devotion
The first trustee characteristic mentioned
by all students of higher education is that the
trustee must have a "deep devotion to the
cause of higher education." This should in
clude, besides pecuniary support, an under
standing of and commitment to the two fold
role of the university as cultural transmitter
and critic.
Second, he must be open-minded, "willing to
entertain without prejudice, thoughts and
ideas that may at first, seem to him not only
unfamiliar, hut, in some cases, disturbing",

according to the Report of the Special Trus
tees Committee of Columbia University, 1957.
He must, the Columbia report continues,
"actively recognize that conventionality and
conformity, no matter how greatly they ease
social interactions, are not the prime qualities
through which a university grows, prospers,
and advances."
Leadership
Third, the trustee must possess the quali
ties of enthusiastic and inspiring leadership
that will command the respect and admiration
of others. Fourth, he will probably be success
ful in his own field of activity. And fifth, he
should possess the viewpoint that "the social
order and its institutions must constantly
change" (William Ashbrook).
Moving to the composition of the board, we
find that almost all studies of boards of trus
tees recommend that composition of the
Board be varied as to educational background,
vocational experience, geographic location,
and age.
Diversity of education and residence pre
vents inbreeding and parochialism and fosters
a cosmopolitan outlook in spirit with the con
temporary world in which educational institu
tions have an expanding range of influence
and interest.
Recommended Age
Age is perhaps mentioned most frequently
as needing diversification. Studies have shown
that the average age of board members at pri

vate universities is about 64. It is frequently
recommended that the average age be some
where in the mid 50's.
"It would also seem desirable," Hubert Beck
states, "that no member should serve beyond
the age of seventy; there should certainly be
substantial numbers of members between 30
and 50."
The primary reason for lowering the aver
age age of board members is that, according
to Raymond Hughes, "the board should be
young enough to sense the needs of the people
it represents and guide the changing institu
tions to their largest service, rather than that
a large majority of aged men should maintain
policies unchanged."
Occupations
Vocational diversification has proved a great
stumbling block. In the past, it was thought
that boards needed large numbers of lawyers
and financiers because the university needed
their expert talents and because they lent a
high level of prestige to the board.
These arguments seem far less convincing
now, however, because major universities em
ploy investment counsel, legal counsel, and
competent business executives, so that volun
teer "experts" may be actually a hindrance.
Further, boards need no longer rely strictly
on the business community for members in
order to maintain a high level of prestige for
the board.
But most importantly, the new situation
permits the boards to more easily diversify

by vocation and thus would tend to foster a
board atmosphere in which an over-riding con
cern with business matters can be lessened
and a focus on education secured.
This would be especially true if educators
and social scientists, the groups most fre
quently mentioned by higher education schol
ars, could be added in significant numbers to
boards of trustees.
Representation
The most frequent general suggestion for
altering board composition is the suggestion
of "functional" representation. Proponents of
this plan argue that if the board is to be made
up of laymen, society in general is controlling
the university.
But, they say, boards currently do not rep
resent society at all but merely one class in
it. They recommend that board composition
be changed so that educators, business men,
professional men, labor, and, where appropri
ate, agriculture are represented on the board.
The usual argument against functional rep
resentation is a pragmatic one: the board
wants the best men it can find and shouldn't
he shackled by some lowest common denomi
nator set of qualifications.
The response to this is equally pragmatic.
Most boards (at least in private universities)
are self-perpetuating and unless diversifying
criteria are explicitly stated, board members
tend to be replaced with men of the same
generation and the same political and social
outlook.

Various experiments at diversification of
membership have been made in the past, spe
cifieally inclusion of alumni and faculty repre
sentatives, but these seem to have met with
only partial success. In the case of alumni
trustees, only small numbers are involved
and, frequently, the board is made up pre
dominantly of alumni already.
And, just as with alumni representation,
faculty participation on boards seems to be
more symbolic than effective. Where faculty
representation has been tried, the numbers of
faculty involved has been so small that the
faculty representative, in the words of one of
them, R. G. Marcham of Cornell, has not re
garded himself as "qualified to act and speak
for the faculty."
As a solution, Marcham recommends that
"the university have as its highest and most
influential agency a planning committee of
about twelve persons, on which trustees, ad
ministrators, and faculty are equally repre
sented, and that this body have the responsi
bility for developing at regular meetings the
pattern of the university's growth."
We have found that diversification accord
ing to vocation, age, geography, and educa
tion is recommended so that the board can be
more representative of society whose demands
and wishes it transmits to the university and
so that it is young enough to be sensitive to
the needs of the university.
