ensemble. The group has gained
distinction for Handy's high
pitched special effects, Michael

moving bass solos:
Jazz critic Leonard Feather
has said, "Individually and col

lectively, this is the most ex
citing new group to gain recog
nition during the past year. Its
emotional range is broad, its
ability to communicate with an
audience is extradordinary, and
it brings to prominence fivo
major talents.
Bola Sete received national at
tention for the first time when
he appeared with Dizzy Gillespie
at the 1962 Monterey Jazz Festi
val. His bossa nova guitar and
spirtely Brazilian dancing caught
