### 
CHAMPAIGN-URBANA, lU.
(CPS) â€” Student-administrative
relations at the University of
Illinois took a great leap side
ways when the administration
promised to consult students be
fore selecting a new dean, and
then chose a man whose name
Was never presented for consid
eration.
Students have been moving to
take part in more administra
tive-faculty decisions since last
'|year when they were admitted
to academic policy councils. They
have been working with the ad
ministration in formulating so
cial rules for 30 years.
When the Dean of Students
position became open last term,
however, University President
David Henry resisted student
pressures for participation in
the faculty Search Committee
for a replacement.
President Henry compromised
with Ribert Byman, the Student
Sepate president at that time,
to Byman, President
Henry promised to consult with
rihim if the Student Senate did
not push for representation on
the Search Committee. Byman
was to offer his suggestions to
the Committee after seeing the
list of candidates.
The Student Senate leader
orjded up seeing what he thought
were only names of preliminary
choices. The man subsequently
thosen was not included, he said.
ojPfesident Henry contended By
man saw the final list.
