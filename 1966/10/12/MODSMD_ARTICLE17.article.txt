# Studies Show Grades Give Little Indication
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (CPS)—There
seems to be no direct relation
ship between high grades in col
lege and professional success in
later life, two recent studies in
dicate.
Dr. Eli Grinzberg, a New York
researcher, studied a group of
Columbia University graduate
students who had won fellow
ships to the school between 1944
and 1950. Ginzberg's task was to
find out how successful the 342
students had become 14 years
after they completed their fel
lowships.
The findings showed students
who had graduated from college
with honors, who had won scho
lastic medals or who had been
elected to Phi Beta Kappa were
more likely to be in the "lower
professional performance levels"
than students who had not dis
tinguished themselves while in
college.
No Relationship
In another survey, a team of
University of Utah professors
found there is almost no rela

tionship between the grades a
medical student gets and his
later performance.
He added that the study caused
him to question the adequacy
of grades not only in selecting
those who should be admitted to
medical school but also in mea
suring a student's progress.
Grades Destructive
There are numerous theories
attempting to explain these sur
praising findings. The most com
mon one affirms that the over
emphasis on grades which be
gins when a student is in junior
high school and continues
throughtout his academic career
tends to destroy interest in
learning for its own sake.
John Holt, an educator and
author of "Why Children Fail,"
observes that current school
methods destroy love of learn
ing by encouraging students to
work for petty rewards—names
on honor rolls, gold stars, for the
"ignorable satisfaction of feeling
they are better than someone
else."
