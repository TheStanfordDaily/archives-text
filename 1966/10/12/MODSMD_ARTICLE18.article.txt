jITHE HAMPSHIRE VALLEY,
Mass. (CPS) —In cooperation
.'"'with faculty and administration,
•Students in the Hampshire Val
ley are developing radical educa
tional plans for their colleges—
University of Massachusetts,
Smith, Amherst, and Mt. Holy
oke.
Last year, a $6 million dona
( tion, establishing a trust fund,
impetus for a four school
cooperative college, free from
'•tradition, trustees, rigid curri
cula and departmental divisions.
Sfamed Hampshire, the school
Rlanned to encourage intellec
tual initiative through a com
munity as open as possible to
the unpredictable development
of ideas.
The original plan for this

residential, coeducational school,
written by professors from the
area colleges, maintained that
students could be taught to edu
cate themselves under a faculty
as small as 50 for 1,000 students.
The plan advocated intensive
seminars with 12 students each,
beginning in freshman year, to
train students for an active role
in their education.
No Grades
After the report was issued,
students from Smith and Am
herst Colleges submitted propo
sals advocating a highly flexible
academic program in which the
curriculum would have no re
quirements, and faculty and stu
dent assessments would substi
tute for grades.
Newly selected vice president

of Hampshire College, Charles
Longsworth, said the student re
port was "interesting; we'll con
sider it."
A faculty committee working
with the president of the four
colleges and newly appointed
Hampshire College president
Franklin Patterson, formerly di
rector of the Carnegie Corpora
tion Committee on Educational
Television, will release plans for
the college this month.
Meanwhile, the area schools
are re-evaluating their own pro
grams. This semester, Smith
College, following Mt. Holyoke's
lead, changed from a five to
four course system with fewer
requirements and an increased
opportunity for independent
study.
Abolish Frats
At Amherst, a faculty com
mittee issued a "student life"
report last year which discussed
the relationship of the student
to his educational experience.
The committee made sugges
tions from abolishing fraterni
ties to improving faculty-stu
dent relations by having faculty
live in dormitories. The college
is looking into implementation
of the plan.
Students and faculty are also
forming a Free University simi
lar to those in New York, Los
Angeles, Austin, Boulder, Chi
cago, Philadelphia, Ann Arbor,
San Francisco, and Palo Alto.

At Amherst, a faculty com
mittee issued a "student life"
report last year which discussed
the relationship of the student
to his educational experience.
The committee made sugges
tions from abolishing fraterni
ties to improving faculty-stu
dent relations by having faculty
live in dormitories. The college
is looking into implementation
of the plan.
Students and faculty are also
forming a Free University simi
lar to those in New York, Los
