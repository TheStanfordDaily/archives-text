# SDS' Oglesby Made Activist-In-Residence
## 
### 
OHIO (CPS)â€”A leading critic
of modern universities has ac
cepted a role in the system, or
so it seems.
Carl Oglesby, past president
of Students for a Democratic
Society, has been hired by An
tioch students as an "activist
scholar-in-residence." Oglesby
will spend the next six months
at Antioch as a resource for
student-initiated courses and
study projects.
Stressing "open partisanship"
as fundamental to the full ex
change of ideas, the program's
planners sought an individual

who had demonstrated both a
scholarly background and a
commitment to a social move
ment, according to planning
committee spokesman Dan An
gert.
As an activist-scholar, Oglesby
will be encouraged to do the
same sort of work he did in SDS,
advocating the cause of radical
democracy, Angert said. Oglesby
has also shown an interest in
working with the theater, he
added, and may write a play dur
ing his residence.
Opponents of the program
charged that it had de
signed specifically for Oglesby
and as such demonstrated an in
stitutional commitment to his
particular political philosophy.
Committee members admitted
that the availability of Oglesby
had been a central consideration,
but argued that the program had
developed as pilot project and
will probably be continued with
other individuals.
They reported having consid
ered other candidates from beat
poet Allen Ginsberg to conserva
tive editor William F. Buckley,
Jr.
Oglesby will receive a $4,000
salary for the six months, paid
out of student fees. Another
$1,000 has been appropriated for
bringing "visiting scholars" in
for a few days at a time.
