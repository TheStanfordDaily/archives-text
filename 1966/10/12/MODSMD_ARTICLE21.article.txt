# Presidents Urge 'Trivial' Frats To Split From Their Nationals
## 
### 
VALPARAISO, Ind. (CPS)â€”
As a key to eliminating "dis
criminatory practices" and the
"trivial, anti-intellectual char
acter" of their fraternities' ac
tivities, the presidents of the so
cial fraternities at Valparaiso
University have advocated a
complete split with their nation
als by the end of this semester.
In a guest editorial in the
September 30 issue of the stu
dent newspaper, the Torch, the
eleven fraternity presidents ex
pressed doubts that their chap
ters served any positive purpose
as presently organized.
They charged the most cru
cial weakness of the system was
its "apathy regarding the aca
demic enterprise," and suggest
ed that "the general Greek atti
tude is one of disdain toward
diligent and sustained interest
in critical inquiry."
The entire student body suf
fers from the fraternities' ridic
ulous" and "annoying" rushing
procedures, they said. In addi
tion, fraternity men themselves
suffer from their pledging pro
grams which include "absurd
physical and mental endurance
tests."
Discrimination Exists
The eleven categorically sta
ted that fraternities are guilty
of discrimination toward minori
ty groups and explained that,
while many national fraterni
ties have no clauses specifical
ly excluding certain people,
"gentlemen's agreements" or
some other arrangement on the
local level strongly discourages
the pledging of Negroes.
Disaffiliating from the na
tionals would, "once and for all
eliminate the claim 'we may dis
criminate, but it's due to na
tional policy of some sort,'"
they said.
Local autonomy would allow
each fraternity more freedom in
establishing its own internal re
form programs, they suggested.
End of Blackball
Having declared local autono
my and signed the pledge, the
eleven presidents said they
would work to abolish the unit
rule, or "Blackball" system.
The unit rule, they said,
means that the negative vote of
only one member can be enough
to exclude a candidate from the
fraternity.
They suggested the establish
ment of reasonably acceptable
alternatives for determining
membership, such as requiring
a 15 per cent negative vote for
rejection of a candidate.
Some of the fraternities na
tional offices said that their
chapters already had local au
tonomy in selecting members,
but others refused to comment.
Reaction on the Valaparaiso
campus has been mixed. Dean
of Mean Carl Galow said the
fraternities were in a "change
or perish" position and com
mended the statement. The Uni
versity president has also indi
cated his support.
A majority of the fraternity
men probably never even read

the editorial, Torch editor Tom
Zorn commented, and reaction
among the Greeks has been luke
warm. There 6eems to be a con
sensus among the leaders, how

ever, he said, that the criti
cisms were all too true.
The statement was originally
drafted and presented to the
presidents for their signatures

by student body president Mark
Schwehn. Schwehn was elected
last spring partially as a "fra
ternity candidate" and a mod
erate on the reform issue.
