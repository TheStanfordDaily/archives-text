# BERKELEY: CAMPAIGN ISSUE
## LSD Orgies Or 'Greatest'? Rafferty: Orgies Kerr: No Change Gardner: Great 
### 
SACRAMENTO (AP) — Cali
fornia's school chief says "LSD
orgies" are being held regularly
by students from the Berkeley
campus of the University of
California.
Dr. Max Rafferty, state super
intendent of public instruction,
listed such activities among six
"phenemona" occurring at the
campus. His list was in a letter
sent to Assemblyman William
T. Bagley, (R-San Rafael), who
had rapped Rafferty for criti
cizing the university.
In his letter, Rafferty asked if
Babley were claiming:
"1. That a topless burlesque
dancer did not appear on cam
pus?
"2. That obscene literature
was not passed out to under
graduates on campus?
"3. That obscenities were not
broadcast over ' campus public
address systems to a public of
fice?
"4. That there were no riots
on campus?
"5. That LSD orgies were not
being held regularly by certain
undergraduates.
"6. That bearded, long-haired,
obviously unclean characters do
not abound on the Berkeley
campus?"
Saying he knew such informa
tion to be true, Rafferty added:
"If you admit the existence of
the above phenomena, then
maybe you (Bagley) regard
them as unimportant. If so, then
you are out of the mainstream
of public opinion. I just got
through campaigning with this
issue as the major plank in my
platform, and I was re-elected
by the greatest majority in the
history of California politics."
Rafferty urged Bagley to stick
to lawmaking and let the school
chief attend to state education
al problems.
Bagley, like Rafferty, a Re
publican, said in his letter that
Rafferty was compounding prob
lems at the university rather
than helping to solve them.

SACRAMENTO (AP) — Dr.
Max Rafferty, California's edu
cation chief, has listed his 10
Commandments of Education,
which included "keep politics
out."
Another was, "Thou shalt not
use the school as an ornothologi
cal sanctuary for odd birds."
The state school superinten
dent added, "The campus of one
of our better-known universi
ties looks like Skid Row."
Rafferty later referred specifi
cally to the University of Cali
fornia at Berkeley during an ad
dress to the annual professional
staff meeting of the state de
partment of education.
One of his commandments
was that teachers obey the law
and Rafferty said most do.
But he added "dry rot is be
ginning to set in around the
edges."
Some teachers disobey the
law that prohibits the teaching
of profanity and many won't
follow a rule for daily patriotic
sessions, he said.
"Some sit sulking in the back
ground while someone else
leads the exercises."
Rafferty said 27,000 of the 28,-
000 men and women at Berkeley
are "perfectly honorable, decent
students."

LOS ANGELES (AP) — To
day's students "are no different
from the way we were, basic
ally," says University of Califor
nia President Clark Kerr.
But, he added, "there are
more of them who might be
called non-conformist."
In a talk last week at Town
Hall Kerr defended one kind of
non-conformity.
He divided non-conformists
into three classes: Revolution
ary, beatnik and"the Peace
Corps type."
The revolutionaries and the
beatniks gain publicity despite
small numbers, Kerr said, com
menting, "None of the future
belongs to them."
He described the Peace Corps
type as young persons "who are
working in places like Watts,
in prisons and other social
agencies trying to improve the
society in which they live."

HEW Secretary John Gardner
made this statement here Fri
day.
I have a close personal knowl
edge of every one of our leading
universities, and I can tell you
that the University of Califor
nia is one of the two or three
greatest universities in the
world. It is a beacon of light
wherever men honor learning.
It's quite possible that the
most significant single achieve
ment of the people of California
since the state was admitted to
the Union is the creation and
bringing to maturity of this
great institution.
It has had troubles. But the
last place to debate those trou
bles or seek to solve them is irj
the heat of a political campaign.
Take it out of the campaign
altogether. I beg of you.

SACRAMENTO (AP) — Cali
fornia's school chief says "LSD
orgies" are being held regularly
by students from the Berkeley
campus of the University of
California.
Dr. Max Rafferty, state super
intendent of public instruction,
listed such activities among six
"phenemona" occurring at the
campus. His list was in a letter
sent to Assemblyman William
T. Bagley, (R-San Rafael), who
had rapped Rafferty for criti
cizing the university.
In his letter, Rafferty asked if
Babley were claiming:
"1. That a topless burlesque
dancer did not appear on cam
pus?
"2. That obscene literature
was not passed out to under
graduates on campus?
"3. That obscenities were not
broadcast over ' campus public
address systems to a public of
fice?
"4. That there were no riots
on campus?
"5. That LSD orgies were not
being held regularly by certain
undergraduates.
"6. That bearded, long-haired,
obviously unclean characters do
not abound on the Berkeley
campus?"
Saying he knew such informa
tion to be true, Rafferty added:
"If you admit the existence of
the above phenomena, then
maybe you (Bagley) regard
them as unimportant. If so, then
you are out of the mainstream
of public opinion. I just got
through campaigning with this
issue as the major plank in my
platform, and I was re-elected
by the greatest majority in the
history of California politics."
Rafferty urged Bagley to stick
to lawmaking and let the school
chief attend to state education
al problems.
Bagley, like Rafferty, a Re
publican, said in his letter that
Rafferty was compounding prob
lems at the university rather
than helping to solve them.

SACRAMENTO (AP) — Dr.
Max Rafferty, California's edu
cation chief, has listed his 10
Commandments of Education,
which included "keep politics
out."
Another was, "Thou shalt not
use the school as an ornothologi
cal sanctuary for odd birds."
The state school superinten
dent added, "The campus of one
of our better-known universi
ties looks like Skid Row."
Rafferty later referred specifi
cally to the University of Cali
fornia at Berkeley during an ad
dress to the annual professional
staff meeting of the state de
partment of education.
One of his commandments
was that teachers obey the law
and Rafferty said most do.
But he added "dry rot is be
ginning to set in around the
edges."
Some teachers disobey the
law that prohibits the teaching
of profanity and many won't
follow a rule for daily patriotic
sessions, he said.
"Some sit sulking in the back
ground while someone else
leads the exercises."
Rafferty said 27,000 of the 28,-
000 men and women at Berkeley
are "perfectly honorable, decent
students."

LOS ANGELES (AP) — To
day's students "are no different
from the way we were, basic
ally," says University of Califor
nia President Clark Kerr.
But, he added, "there are
more of them who might be
called non-conformist."
In a talk last week at Town
Hall Kerr defended one kind of
non-conformity.
He divided non-conformists
into three classes: Revolution
ary, beatnik and"the Peace
Corps type."
The revolutionaries and the
beatniks gain publicity despite
small numbers, Kerr said, com
menting, "None of the future
belongs to them."
He described the Peace Corps
type as young persons "who are
working in places like Watts,
in prisons and other social
agencies trying to improve the
society in which they live."

HEW Secretary John Gardner
made this statement here Fri
day.
I have a close personal knowl

in prisons and other social
agencies trying to improve the
society in which they live."

HEW Secretary John Gardner
made this statement here Fri
day.
I have a close personal knowl
edge of every one of our leading
universities, and I can tell you
that the University of Califor
nia is one of the two or three
greatest universities in the
world. It is a beacon of light
wherever men honor learning.
It's quite possible that the
most significant single achieve
ment of the people of California
since the state was admitted to
the Union is the creation and
bringing to maturity of this
great institution.
It has had troubles. But the
last place to debate those trou
bles or seek to solve them is irj
the heat of a political campaign.
Take it out of the campaign
altogether. I beg of you.
SACRAMENTO (AP) — Cali
fornia's school chief says "LSD
orgies" are being held regularly
by students from the Berkeley
campus of the University of
California.
Dr. Max Rafferty, state super
intendent of public instruction,
listed such activities among six
"phenemona" occurring at the
campus. His list was in a letter
sent to Assemblyman William
T. Bagley, (R-San Rafael), who
had rapped Rafferty for criti
cizing the university.
In his letter, Rafferty asked if
Babley were claiming:
"1. That a topless burlesque
dancer did not appear on cam
pus?
"2. That obscene literature
was not passed out to under
graduates on campus?
"3. That obscenities were not
broadcast over ' campus public
address systems to a public of
fice?
"4. That there were no riots
on campus?
"5. That LSD orgies were not
being held regularly by certain
undergraduates.
"6. That bearded, long-haired,
obviously unclean characters do
not abound on the Berkeley
campus?"
Saying he knew such informa
tion to be true, Rafferty added:
"If you admit the existence of
the above phenomena, then
maybe you (Bagley) regard
them as unimportant. If so, then
you are out of the mainstream
of public opinion. I just got
through campaigning with this
issue as the major plank in my
platform, and I was re-elected
by the greatest majority in the
history of California politics."
Rafferty urged Bagley to stick
to lawmaking and let the school
chief attend to state education
al problems.
Bagley, like Rafferty, a Re
publican, said in his letter that
Rafferty was compounding prob
lems at the university rather
than helping to solve them.

SACRAMENTO (AP) — Dr.
Max Rafferty, California's edu
cation chief, has listed his 10
Commandments of Education,
which included "keep politics
out."
Another was, "Thou shalt not
use the school as an ornothologi
cal sanctuary for odd birds."
The state school superinten
dent added, "The campus of one
of our better-known universi
ties looks like Skid Row."
Rafferty later referred specifi
cally to the University of Cali
fornia at Berkeley during an ad
dress to the annual professional
staff meeting of the state de
partment of education.
One of his commandments
was that teachers obey the law
and Rafferty said most do.
But he added "dry rot is be
ginning to set in around the
edges."
Some teachers disobey the
law that prohibits the teaching
of profanity and many won't
follow a rule for daily patriotic
sessions, he said.
"Some sit sulking in the back
ground while someone else
leads the exercises."
Rafferty said 27,000 of the 28,-
000 men and women at Berkeley
are "perfectly honorable, decent
students."

LOS ANGELES (AP) — To
day's students "are no different
from the way we were, basic
ally," says University of Califor
nia President Clark Kerr.
But, he added, "there are
more of them who might be
called non-conformist."
In a talk last week at Town
Hall Kerr defended one kind of
non-conformity.
He divided non-conformists
into three classes: Revolution
ary, beatnik and"the Peace
Corps type."
The revolutionaries and the
beatniks gain publicity despite
small numbers, Kerr said, com
menting, "None of the future
belongs to them."
He described the Peace Corps
type as young persons "who are
working in places like Watts,
in prisons and other social
agencies trying to improve the
society in which they live."
