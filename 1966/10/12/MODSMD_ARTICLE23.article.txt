VANCOUVER, British Colum
bia (CPS)—Do-it-yourself dormi
tories may soon house students
at the University of British Co
lumbia. A chronic housing short
age has sparked plans for self
financing student-owned cooper
ative apartments.
There are presently 1,400 stu
dents waiting for unavailable
ÜBC residence accommodations.
Another 5,500 are seeking scarce
off-campus housing.
