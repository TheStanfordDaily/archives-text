"I'm going to tell you about
the white man. The white man
is a mutha -•-! Do you under
stand me? The white man gon
na mess with me? Oh Hell no!
Can you hear me white man?"

No, it's not the beginning of
a new Leroy Jones play. These
are the words of a dweller of
the Oakland Flatlands and they
are part of one of the most
amazing radio documentaries

that I have ever heard. The title
of the documentary is "Is Oak
land Burning?" and it is the
work of George Howson, a jun
ior at Stanford.
Mr. Howson took a tape re
corder into the slums of Oak
land and talked to the people.
He asked the people what they
thought of life and they told
him, "You don't have no money,
It's like you in a cage."
Death Sentence For Bein' Poor
He asked about welfare and
was told "Welfare's like a death
sentence for bein' poor." He
went into their homes and saw
the filth in which they are
forced to live, and behind the
voices of some of his interviews
you can hear the squeaks of the
rats with whom they must fight
for survival.
In addition, Mr. Howson did
copious research. He collected
the facts and figures produced
by their lives. What emerges is
a 50-minute tape recording that
at once shocks, frightens, and
shames one.
The narration ,the facts and
figures of the Flatlands, is done
by Bob Berstresser, the program

director of KPFA in Berkeley.
His voice could hardly be more
perfect for the part. He sounds
like the "white man," that is, he
sounds a 6 if he is more inter
ested in the facts and figures
than he is in what they repre
sent. This underplaying of the
narration establishes a counter
point with the genuinely emo
tional recordings of the slum
dwellers.
Quality of Life
The program, besides expos
ing the plight of the Negro
poor, is sociologically fasci
nating. Particularly in the inter
views with the young, the devel
opment of fantasies can be ob
served. And as the narrator
points out, it is these fantasies
that are important, for in them
the true quality of the life of
the slum dweller is revealed.
The conclusion reached is that
"Oakland is goin' to blow up!"
The program does not concern
itself with a cure but this is not
a fault. The intention of the
documentary i6 to "reflect life
as perceived from the slums and
ghettos" and this talk is accom
plished superbly.

Wellman's "Public En«irny"

trouble, the film was well-re
ceived. Certain scenes now ap
pear quite absurd (the revenjge
killing of the horse, Wellrrtffn >
moral tag at the end) button
the whole the film has survived
the years quite well. This» : is
probably because all gangster
films work within the same con
ventions and these conventions
have not changed significant! v
since the 1930'5. 00
Seeing "Public Enemy" called
to mind Robert Warshow's Clas
sic analysis of the American
gangster film in "The immedi
ate Experience." As Warshow
explains it, a gangster's activity
is purely rational with its ow
goals and techniques. In—the
gangster film this rationality is
not shown and the gangster's
activity is reduced to pure crim
inality, i.e., hurting people. In
'Public Enemy," there are only
a few scenes that deal with the
actual activities of the crimin \
(the attempted burglary, the
scene in the distillery).
shown is Cagney's brutality (or
manliness if you prefer),
Dangerous To Be Alone
Warshow contends that the
reaction to a gangster film 's
one of sadism: the viewer par
ticipates in the criminal's nud
ism and then in the sadism-of
the criminal's death (or cap
ture). Again, "Public Enem*"
conforms to the pattern wilt
Cagney's brutality and then his
brutal end.
Warshow points out that oise
of the most firmly established
conventions of the crime film Is
that it is dangerous to be alonte
At the same time, the condition
of success is to rise as an indi
vidual, to be alone. Thus Ca£
ney is not killed until he » I\
the top. And when the criminal
is killed, he is, of course, r$
duced to being a failure. JEfce
criminal then is doomed by his
own success.
Warshow goes into the phe
nomenon of the crime film mu<jh
more fully than here indicate

parallel between the position if
the viewer and the position bf
the criminal but for this yo

reaction to a gangster film 's
one of sadism: the viewer par
ticipates in the criminal's nud
ism and then in the sadism-of
the criminal's death (or cap
ture). Again, "Public Enem*"
conforms to the pattern wilt
Cagney's brutality and then his
brutal end.
Warshow points out that oise
of the most firmly established
conventions of the crime film Is
that it is dangerous to be alonte
At the same time, the condition
of success is to rise as an indi
vidual, to be alone. Thus Ca£
ney is not killed until he » I\
the top. And when the criminal
is killed, he is, of course, r$
duced to being a failure. JEfce
criminal then is doomed by his
own success.
Warshow goes into the phe
nomenon of the crime film mu<jh
more fully than here indicate
and even manages to draw £a
parallel between the position if
the viewer and the position bf
the criminal but for this yo
can read The Immediate Exp*4i
enc© published by Doubleday in
hardback ($4.50) and paperba<?k
($1.20).
"I'm going to tell you about
the white man. The white man
is a mutha -•-! Do you under
stand me? The white man gon
na mess with me? Oh Hell no!
Can you hear me white man?"

No, it's not the beginning of
a new Leroy Jones play. These
are the words of a dweller of
the Oakland Flatlands and they
are part of one of the most
amazing radio documentaries

that I have ever heard. The title
of the documentary is "Is Oak
land Burning?" and it is the
work of George Howson, a jun
ior at Stanford.
Mr. Howson took a tape re
corder into the slums of Oak
land and talked to the people.
He asked the people what they
thought of life and they told
him, "You don't have no money,
It's like you in a cage."
Death Sentence For Bein' Poor
He asked about welfare and
was told "Welfare's like a death
sentence for bein' poor." He
went into their homes and saw
the filth in which they are
forced to live, and behind the
voices of some of his interviews
you can hear the squeaks of the
rats with whom they must fight
for survival.
In addition, Mr. Howson did
copious research. He collected
the facts and figures produced
by their lives. What emerges is
a 50-minute tape recording that
at once shocks, frightens, and
shames one.
The narration ,the facts and
figures of the Flatlands, is done
by Bob Berstresser, the program

director of KPFA in Berkeley.
His voice could hardly be more
perfect for the part. He sounds
like the "white man," that is, he
sounds a 6 if he is more inter
ested in the facts and figures
than he is in what they repre
sent. This underplaying of the
narration establishes a counter
point with the genuinely emo
tional recordings of the slum
dwellers.
Quality of Life
The program, besides expos
ing the plight of the Negro
poor, is sociologically fasci
nating. Particularly in the inter
views with the young, the devel
opment of fantasies can be ob
served. And as the narrator
points out, it is these fantasies
that are important, for in them
the true quality of the life of
the slum dweller is revealed.
The conclusion reached is that
"Oakland is goin' to blow up!"
The program does not concern
itself with a cure but this is not
a fault. The intention of the
documentary i6 to "reflect life
as perceived from the slums and
ghettos" and this talk is accom
plished superbly.

Seeing "Public Enemy" called
to mind Robert Warshow's Clas
sic analysis of the American
gangster film in "The immedi

explains it, a gangster's activity
is purely rational with its ow
goals and techniques. In—the
gangster film this rationality is
not shown and the gangster's
activity is reduced to pure crim
inality, i.e., hurting people. In
'Public Enemy," there are only
a few scenes that deal with the
actual activities of the crimin \
(the attempted burglary, the
scene in the distillery).
shown is Cagney's brutality (or
manliness if you prefer),
Dangerous To Be Alone
Warshow contends that the
reaction to a gangster film 's
one of sadism: the viewer par
ticipates in the criminal's nud
ism and then in the sadism-of
the criminal's death (or cap
ture). Again, "Public Enem*"
conforms to the pattern wilt
Cagney's brutality and then his
brutal end.
Warshow points out that oise
of the most firmly established
conventions of the crime film Is
that it is dangerous to be alonte
At the same time, the condition
of success is to rise as an indi
vidual, to be alone. Thus Ca£
ney is not killed until he » I\
the top. And when the criminal
is killed, he is, of course, r$
duced to being a failure. JEfce
criminal then is doomed by his
own success.
Warshow goes into the phe
nomenon of the crime film mu<jh
more fully than here indicate
and even manages to draw £a
parallel between the position if
the viewer and the position bf

"I'm going to tell you about
the white man. The white man
is a mutha -•-! Do you under
stand me? The white man gon
na mess with me? Oh Hell no!
Can you hear me white man?"

No, it's not the beginning of
a new Leroy Jones play. These
are the words of a dweller of
the Oakland Flatlands and they
are part of one of the most
amazing radio documentaries

that I have ever heard. The title
of the documentary is "Is Oak
land Burning?" and it is the
work of George Howson, a jun
ior at Stanford.
Mr. Howson took a tape re
corder into the slums of Oak
land and talked to the people.
He asked the people what they
thought of life and they told
him, "You don't have no money,
It's like you in a cage."
Death Sentence For Bein' Poor
He asked about welfare and
was told "Welfare's like a death
sentence for bein' poor." He
went into their homes and saw
the filth in which they are
forced to live, and behind the
voices of some of his interviews
you can hear the squeaks of the
rats with whom they must fight
for survival.
In addition, Mr. Howson did
copious research. He collected
the facts and figures produced
by their lives. What emerges is
a 50-minute tape recording that
at once shocks, frightens, and
shames one.
The narration ,the facts and
figures of the Flatlands, is done
by Bob Berstresser, the program

director of KPFA in Berkeley.
His voice could hardly be more
perfect for the part. He sounds
like the "white man," that is, he
sounds a 6 if he is more inter
ested in the facts and figures
than he is in what they repre
sent. This underplaying of the
narration establishes a counter
point with the genuinely emo
tional recordings of the slum
dwellers.
Quality of Life
The program, besides expos
ing the plight of the Negro
poor, is sociologically fasci
nating. Particularly in the inter
views with the young, the devel
opment of fantasies can be ob
served. And as the narrator
points out, it is these fantasies
that are important, for in them
the true quality of the life of
the slum dweller is revealed.
The conclusion reached is that
"Oakland is goin' to blow up!"
The program does not concern
itself with a cure but this is not
a fault. The intention of the
documentary i6 to "reflect life
as perceived from the slums and
ghettos" and this talk is accom
plished superbly.
