# U.S. Popularity Increasing
## Soccer Upsurge At Farm 
### BILL GRAHAM 
There are no marching bands
or cheerleaders or even a great
number of spectators, but soccer
at Stanford has been slowly
emerging from the depths of
obscurity to take its place as a
major sport on the Farm.
Soccer began at Stanford in
1911 under the direction of
Harry Maloney and has sur
vived continuously in spite of
two world wars and other minor
annoyances. It has certainly
been far from easy to keep the
sport going, however. Several
times soccer seemed to become
almost a club sport and it was
only a little over ten years ago
that the Athletic Department
granted it a budget. Until then,
the team had to give a pre-reg
dance to finance their equip
ment.
The Indians first became part
of a league, the Northern Cali
fornia Inter-Collegiate Soccer
Conference, in 1928. The confer
ence then consisted of San Jose
State, Stanford, Cal, the Univer
sity of San Francisco and South
ern Cal. The league stayed in
this form until 1965, when the
name was changed to the West
ern Inter-Collegiate Soccer Con
ference, and three teams, the
University of the Pacific, Chico
and the University of Cal at
Davis were added. In addition
the league was split into two
divisions, one for four year and
one for junior colleges.
Stanford has never been a
real power in the conference,
since no soccer scholarships are
given, but the Indians took two
titles as recently as 1962 and
1963. In 1963 the team went all
the way to the NCAA quarter
finals, where they were defeated
by St. Louis, a perennial soccer
power.
Priddle Directs Team
Stanford soccer teams have
been under the direction of Fred
Priddle for the last 15 years.
Priddle came to the Farm to
coach boxing and rugby and be
a physical education instructor
as well as to be head soccer
coach. His main job now is with
the physical plant but it is clear
that his main interest is in soc
cer.
It has been under Priddle's
direction that soccer has begun
its upswing, which started only
three or four years ago. With
increasing newspaper coverage,
spectators began to be found in
greater abundance at soccer

games. And although there are
no facilities for them and the
crowds are still fairly sparse,
this is a noted improvement.
U.S. Soccer Booms
Soccer in the United States
has also been experiencing a
rise in popularity. Currently, in
St. Louis alone there are 300
teams and in the Midwest, 27
new teams have started just in
the last year.
In addition competition for
the Olympic soccer team, which
formerly has been open only to
club teams because of some
rather peculiar logic of the U.S.
Soccer Football Association, has
now been opened up to collegi
ate soccer players. On October
27, a group of collegians will be
picked to play against the out
standing players from club
teams in the West. The winner
will go to St. Louis for the final
eliminations and whoever is
picked there will represent
America in the Pan American
games and presumably in the
1968 Olympics.
Professional soccer in the
United States, of which many
people are unaware entirely, has
also undergone a recent boom.
There is one professional league
already in existence on the east
coast, the International League,
which consists of teams from
South America, Europe and
Canada as well as the United
States. And another league will
begin operations next year. The
new league will have teams in
San Francisco, Los Angeles, St.
Louis, Detroit, Chicago and Van
couver, and has already signed
a television contract.
With soccer receiving national
coverage, via television, the
sport will have an excellent op
portunity to pick up new fans.
People who have never wit
nessed the action of a game will
be able to find out what this
sport is all about.
International Sport
Americans are probably the
last people to have been caught
up in the excitement of soccer,
called football in foreign coun
tries. Elsewhere in the world,
soccer games draw thousands of
fans. When the Brazilian team
won the World Cup in 1958, they
were greeted on their return
home by more than a million
people in what the New York
Times called, "The greatest pub
lic demonstration in this coun
try's history."
The World Cup is held once

every four years in a different
country. Elimination rounds
take place for almost two years
preceding the actual game. The
final round consists of 16 teams
which have won their regional
play-offs, plus the host country,
even if it was elimianted earlier.
The ruling body of international
soccer, the Federation Interna
tionale de Football Association,
decides where the World Cup
will be played.
World Cup Televised
For the first time since Cup
play started, it was televised in
America last summer. The
games were beamed from Eng
land, the host country, by satel
lite to the U.S.

But soccer is popular any
year, not only during the World
Cup. In countries such as Spain,
Germany, England, Italy, Brazil
and Mexico to name a few, a
soccer game will draw more
people than could fit in Yankee
Stadium.
Coach Priddle attributed soc
cer' 6 tremendous popularity to
the fact that, "There is so much
going on all the time." There
are no timeouts and in interna
tional soccer there aren't even
quarters, just two 45 minute
halfs.
The Indians go after San Jose
tomorrow at 4:00 in what should
be a hard-fought game. Go and
see what an exciting game soc
cer can be.

new teams have started just in
the last year.
In addition competition for
the Olympic soccer team, which
formerly has been open only to
club teams because of some
rather peculiar logic of the U.S.
Soccer Football Association, has
now been opened up to collegi
ate soccer players. On October
27, a group of collegians will be
picked to play against the out
standing players from club
teams in the West. The winner
will go to St. Louis for the final
eliminations and whoever is
picked there will represent
America in the Pan American
games and presumably in the
1968 Olympics.
Professional soccer in the
United States, of which many
people are unaware entirely, has
also undergone a recent boom.
There is one professional league
already in existence on the east
coast, the International League,
which consists of teams from
South America, Europe and
Canada as well as the United
States. And another league will
begin operations next year. The
new league will have teams in
San Francisco, Los Angeles, St.
Louis, Detroit, Chicago and Van
couver, and has already signed
a television contract.
With soccer receiving national

International Sport
Americans are probably the
last people to have been caught
up in the excitement of soccer,
called football in foreign coun
tries. Elsewhere in the world,
soccer games draw thousands of
fans. When the Brazilian team
won the World Cup in 1958, they
were greeted on their return
home by more than a million
people in what the New York
Times called, "The greatest pub
lic demonstration in this coun
try's history."
The World Cup is held once

every four years in a different
country. Elimination rounds
take place for almost two years
preceding the actual game. The
final round consists of 16 teams
which have won their regional
play-offs, plus the host country,
even if it was elimianted earlier.
The ruling body of international
soccer, the Federation Interna
tionale de Football Association,
decides where the World Cup
will be played.
World Cup Televised
For the first time since Cup
play started, it was televised in
America last summer. The
games were beamed from Eng
land, the host country, by satel
lite to the U.S.

But soccer is popular any
year, not only during the World
Cup. In countries such as Spain,
Germany, England, Italy, Brazil
and Mexico to name a few, a
soccer game will draw more
people than could fit in Yankee
Stadium.
Coach Priddle attributed soc
cer' 6 tremendous popularity to
the fact that, "There is so much
going on all the time." There
are no timeouts and in interna
tional soccer there aren't even
quarters, just two 45 minute
halfs.
The Indians go after San Jose
tomorrow at 4:00 in what should
be a hard-fought game. Go and
see what an exciting game soc
cer can be.
There are no marching bands
or cheerleaders or even a great
number of spectators, but soccer
at Stanford has been slowly
emerging from the depths of
obscurity to take its place as a
major sport on the Farm.
Soccer began at Stanford in
1911 under the direction of
Harry Maloney and has sur
vived continuously in spite of
two world wars and other minor
annoyances. It has certainly
been far from easy to keep the
sport going, however. Several
times soccer seemed to become
almost a club sport and it was
only a little over ten years ago
that the Athletic Department
granted it a budget. Until then,
the team had to give a pre-reg
dance to finance their equip
ment.
The Indians first became part
of a league, the Northern Cali
fornia Inter-Collegiate Soccer
Conference, in 1928. The confer
ence then consisted of San Jose
State, Stanford, Cal, the Univer
sity of San Francisco and South
ern Cal. The league stayed in
this form until 1965, when the
name was changed to the West
ern Inter-Collegiate Soccer Con
ference, and three teams, the
University of the Pacific, Chico
and the University of Cal at
Davis were added. In addition
the league was split into two
divisions, one for four year and
one for junior colleges.
Stanford has never been a
real power in the conference,
since no soccer scholarships are
given, but the Indians took two
titles as recently as 1962 and
1963. In 1963 the team went all
the way to the NCAA quarter
finals, where they were defeated
by St. Louis, a perennial soccer
power.
Priddle Directs Team
Stanford soccer teams have
been under the direction of Fred
Priddle for the last 15 years.
Priddle came to the Farm to
coach boxing and rugby and be
a physical education instructor
as well as to be head soccer
coach. His main job now is with
the physical plant but it is clear
that his main interest is in soc
cer.
It has been under Priddle's
direction that soccer has begun
its upswing, which started only
three or four years ago. With
increasing newspaper coverage,
spectators began to be found in
greater abundance at soccer

games. And although there are
no facilities for them and the
crowds are still fairly sparse,
this is a noted improvement.
U.S. Soccer Booms

Coach Priddle attributed soc
cer' 6 tremendous popularity to
the fact that, "There is so much
going on all the time." There
are no timeouts and in interna
tional soccer there aren't even
quarters, just two 45 minute
halfs.
The Indians go after San Jose
tomorrow at 4:00 in what should
be a hard-fought game. Go and
see what an exciting game soc
cer can be.
There are no marching bands
or cheerleaders or even a great
number of spectators, but soccer
at Stanford has been slowly
emerging from the depths of
obscurity to take its place as a
major sport on the Farm.
Soccer began at Stanford in
1911 under the direction of
Harry Maloney and has sur
vived continuously in spite of
two world wars and other minor
annoyances. It has certainly
been far from easy to keep the
sport going, however. Several
times soccer seemed to become
almost a club sport and it was
only a little over ten years ago
that the Athletic Department
granted it a budget. Until then,
the team had to give a pre-reg
dance to finance their equip
ment.
The Indians first became part
of a league, the Northern Cali
fornia Inter-Collegiate Soccer
Conference, in 1928. The confer
ence then consisted of San Jose
State, Stanford, Cal, the Univer
sity of San Francisco and South
ern Cal. The league stayed in
this form until 1965, when the
name was changed to the West
ern Inter-Collegiate Soccer Con
ference, and three teams, the
University of the Pacific, Chico
and the University of Cal at
Davis were added. In addition
the league was split into two
divisions, one for four year and
one for junior colleges.
Stanford has never been a
real power in the conference,
since no soccer scholarships are
given, but the Indians took two
titles as recently as 1962 and
1963. In 1963 the team went all
the way to the NCAA quarter
finals, where they were defeated
by St. Louis, a perennial soccer
power.
Priddle Directs Team
Stanford soccer teams have
been under the direction of Fred
Priddle for the last 15 years.
Priddle came to the Farm to
coach boxing and rugby and be
a physical education instructor
as well as to be head soccer
coach. His main job now is with
the physical plant but it is clear
that his main interest is in soc
cer.
It has been under Priddle's
direction that soccer has begun
its upswing, which started only
three or four years ago. With
increasing newspaper coverage,
spectators began to be found in
greater abundance at soccer

games. And although there are
no facilities for them and the
crowds are still fairly sparse,
this is a noted improvement.
U.S. Soccer Booms
Soccer in the United States
has also been experiencing a
rise in popularity. Currently, in
St. Louis alone there are 300
teams and in the Midwest, 27
new teams have started just in
the last year.
In addition competition for
the Olympic soccer team, which
formerly has been open only to
club teams because of some
rather peculiar logic of the U.S.
Soccer Football Association, has
now been opened up to collegi
ate soccer players. On October
27, a group of collegians will be
picked to play against the out
standing players from club
teams in the West. The winner
will go to St. Louis for the final
eliminations and whoever is
picked there will represent
America in the Pan American
games and presumably in the
1968 Olympics.
Professional soccer in the
United States, of which many
people are unaware entirely, has
also undergone a recent boom.
There is one professional league
already in existence on the east
coast, the International League,
which consists of teams from
South America, Europe and
Canada as well as the United
States. And another league will
begin operations next year. The
new league will have teams in
San Francisco, Los Angeles, St.
Louis, Detroit, Chicago and Van
couver, and has already signed
a television contract.
With soccer receiving national
coverage, via television, the
sport will have an excellent op
portunity to pick up new fans.
People who have never wit
nessed the action of a game will
be able to find out what this
sport is all about.
International Sport
Americans are probably the
last people to have been caught
up in the excitement of soccer,
called football in foreign coun
tries. Elsewhere in the world,
soccer games draw thousands of
fans. When the Brazilian team
won the World Cup in 1958, they
were greeted on their return
home by more than a million
people in what the New York
Times called, "The greatest pub
lic demonstration in this coun
try's history."
The World Cup is held once

every four years in a different
country. Elimination rounds
take place for almost two years
preceding the actual game. The
final round consists of 16 teams
which have won their regional
play-offs, plus the host country,
even if it was elimianted earlier.
The ruling body of international
soccer, the Federation Interna

decides where the World Cup
