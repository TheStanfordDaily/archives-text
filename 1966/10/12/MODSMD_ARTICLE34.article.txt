## Stillman Denies Part In Abduction Scheme 
### 
Editor, The Daly:
Girls' Row Houses, even con
servative (?) Stillman, love pub
licity but legitimately condemn
journalistic irresponsibility.
Stillman's Lovelies were
credited with a fantastic RF'ing
effort on the part of neighbor
ing Hurlburt House in a front
page article in yesterday's
Daily.
Breakfast table discussion has
indicated that few girls feel the
playful little story alluding to
the Rape of the Sabine Women
has cast a permanent slur on
the reputation of the house. In
fact, however, the report was
libel per se.
Even California's comparative
ly liberal libel laws recognize
the defamatory nature of re
ports which are false and im
pute to innocent bystanders (we
did enjoy the abduction of the
girls next door) that they have
been guilty of, accused of or
suspected of any dishonorable
conduct.
In a university community
reputations for raging are posi
tive. In the community at large
they are negative. The Daily's
student staff should realize that
by making a correction in this
case they are only giving credit
where credit is due. If they con
tinue in journalism, it is more
likely that such an error will
lead to truly damaging conse
quences, for the writer, his
newspaper and the libeled par
ty.

• Wrong "Rape'"'
Editor, The Daily:
It was a shocked Hurlburt
that opened its Ajaxed eyeballs
this morning upon that gospel
of half-truths, The Daily, only
to discover that our name had
been sullied, our character de
famed, our reputation ruined,
and credit denied where credit
was due. It seems that the joint
effort of Hurlburt and the Sig
ma Chi's to provide after-dinner
entertainment for the Row had
been erroneously attributed to
our neighbors. On the contrary,
the young ladies of Stillborn
[Sic] looked on in blatant
apathy from amidst their state
ly columns as the "Rape of the
Sabine women" was re-enacted.
Gentlemen, it grieves us to
see the courageous exploits of
Hurlburt unheralded due to
inane and amateurish report
ing, for our innovation in the
entertainment field was, in the
words of one Sigma Chi, "the
best function we've had all
year."

• Equal Opportunity
Editor,The Daily:
The following speak for them
selves:
The Trustees . . . shall have

power, and it shall be their duty
. . . to afford equal facilities and
give equal advantages in the
University to both sexes. (Foun
ding Grant.)
The rights of one sex, politi
cal or otherwise, are the same
as those of the other sex. (Le
land Stanford, first meeting of
the Trustees, Nov. 14, 1885.)
It is Stanford's belief that the
education of men and women in
the same curriculum and under
the same standards provides the
best training for future living.
(Let's Talk About Stanford,
1965; omitted from its succes
sor, The Undergraduate at Stan
ford, 1966.)
A Stanford education ... ex
tends to . . . the extensive re
sponsibility for their own af
fairs with which Stanford stu
dents have been entrusted.
(Let's Talk About Stanford,
1965; omitted from The Under
graduate at Stanford, 1966.)
Single women under 23 years
of age are required to live in
University residences during
their four undergraduate years
at Stanford, and no exceptions
are made. Men are permitted to
live in bachelor quarters off
campus starting with their
Sophomore year. (Let's Talk
About Stanford, 1965; reprinted
in The Undergraduate at Stan
ford, 1966, with the omission of
the last sentence.)
However, lest I be accused of
suggesting about The Under
graduate at Stanford (1966),
such things as are not so, let me
add that it does allow that:
Sophomore, junior, and senior
men choose among fraternities,
eating clubs, Toyon Hall, Lucie
Stern Hall, or living off campus,
and:
The rights and responsibili
ties which Stanford grants to its
students are in a sense a legacy
of independence bequeathed to
the University by the Founding
Grant.

Separate, But Equal
• Meow Meow
Editor, The Dally:
The Stanford Band is a loud
group, at times too gross, at
others too individualistic. We
haven't much time for tender
ness or sensitivity, so when
Heidi arrived, we thought her
a nuisance. (Heidi is a little
something of a Siamese kitten,
with a beige coast, chocolate
paws, face, and tail, ears that
are way too big for her face,
and big blue eyes.)
At first she bugged us. She
was always underfoot, meowing
when we played our instru
ments, running back and forth
through the rafters upsetting
our signs and bottles. The last
person to leave always had to
lock her inside the Band Shack.
Worst of all, we didn't trust
that sandbox idea and we didn't

like the ants that got into her
food.
But the kitten wa6 a psychol
ogist. She'd look at us with
those big blue eyes or rub
against our legs and purr so
loudly it was embarrassing.
She'd fall asleep in the sleeve
of one of our jackets or on top
of that physics book no one
wanted to open anyway. She
learned to lap up any alcoholic
substance, only to develop the
most amazing of hangovers. We
put her food into a pan of wa
ter and the ants went away.
She learned to use the backyard
as a sand box. She knew how
to show favoritism—and did to
most all of us. Maybe she could
sense an animal-hater, because
she'd work extra hard on him.
She entertained us by chasing
her tail—and chasing other such
miscellaneous things as shoe
strings, pantlegs, and two-hun
dred-pound dogs. She learned to
play outside and every few min
utes to come dashing back into
the Shack to check up on us. In
short, she cared about us—and
we learned to care about her.
But now Heidi is gone. The
janitor locked her out Friday
night. We searched for her, but
she is gone. The Band Shack, as
noisy and busy as it so often is,
is a little empty now. We want
her back. If you've found her or
have seen her, please bring her
back. Or call us at ext. 4303,
and we'll pick her up.

• Forgotten Statistics
Editor, The Dally:
Regarding the Daily's discus
sion about women off-campus, I
feel that a consideration very
important to me is being ig
nored — namely, my viewpoint.
There are already too few wom
en on campus.
