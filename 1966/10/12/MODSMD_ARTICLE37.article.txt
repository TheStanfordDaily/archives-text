# In Glass Houses
## How One Escapes A University Ideal 
### Robert E. Stone 
All the advertising for this
great scholastic community in
cludes the phrase "residence
university." All the administra
tors of this great seat of learn
ing will tell you that "Stanford
is a residence university." Why
then the sudden clamor to get
off the campus and live alone?
Far from being a seditious at
tempt to undermine the housing
policy of the university, the cur
rent movement of undergradu
ate women to move off campus
is based on several very real is
sues. The basic argument of
these girls is that, although
dorm living is good, there are
an ever increasing number of
girls who don't like it.
In spite of the fact that Stan
ford is a "residence university,"
it is a well known fact that a
large percentage of undergrad
uate males must live off campus
because of a lack of on campus
housing. While there is little or
no complaint among the men
about this obvious forced sepa
ration, the fact is that the con
cept of a residence university is
nothing more than a concept.
Ever Present
The many dissatisfied women
voice many arguments for
changing the current university
housing policy. Besides the cost,
location, and neighbors, there is
the ever present argument that
it is none of the administra
tion's business where the girls
live.
According to Janet Howell,
leader of the current movement,
the girls "are being discrimi
nated against. It is discrimina
tion based on pre-World War II
thinking."

Miss Howell points to the Uni
versity of California as an in
stitution which has managed to
provide the girls with a choice
of housing, and which has not
suffered any undue consequen
ces because of it.
Roaming- Free
Closely connected with chang
ing the present undergraduate
female housing regulations is
changing the current women's
social regs. It would seem some
what hypocritical to enforce so
cial regs for girls on campus,
while allowing girls off campus
to roam free. Miss Howell
points out, however, that by of
fering each girl a choice of liv
ing location, the administration
would also be offering her a
choice as to whether or not she
wished to be bound by social
regulations.
A final argument used by
those who desire off campus
living for undergraduate fe
males is the lack of privacy in
dorms. While this sounds de
cidedly sexual, there are many
times when a roommate can be
a decided crimp in an evening's
activities, even if they only in
clude some serious studying.
It would seem that the Uni
versity is once more about to
become a center of controversy;
it would also seem that once
again they will have to give in
to the Right. Discrimination in
a society such as ours, which
prides itself on freedom, is not
only criminal, but also highly
degrading. It is hoped that once
again the University will hastily
act to rectify this situation.

It would seem that the Uni
versity is once more about to
become a center of controversy;
it would also seem that once
again they will have to give in
to the Right. Discrimination in
a society such as ours, which
prides itself on freedom, is not
only criminal, but also highly
degrading. It is hoped that once
again the University will hastily
act to rectify this situation.
All the advertising for this
great scholastic community in
cludes the phrase "residence
university." All the administra
tors of this great seat of learn
ing will tell you that "Stanford
is a residence university." Why
then the sudden clamor to get
off the campus and live alone?
Far from being a seditious at
tempt to undermine the housing
policy of the university, the cur
rent movement of undergradu
ate women to move off campus
is based on several very real is
sues. The basic argument of
these girls is that, although
dorm living is good, there are
an ever increasing number of
girls who don't like it.
In spite of the fact that Stan
ford is a "residence university,"
it is a well known fact that a
large percentage of undergrad
uate males must live off campus
because of a lack of on campus
housing. While there is little or
no complaint among the men
about this obvious forced sepa
ration, the fact is that the con
cept of a residence university is
nothing more than a concept.
Ever Present
The many dissatisfied women
voice many arguments for
changing the current university
housing policy. Besides the cost,
location, and neighbors, there is
the ever present argument that
it is none of the administra
tion's business where the girls
live.
According to Janet Howell,
leader of the current movement,
the girls "are being discrimi
nated against. It is discrimina
tion based on pre-World War II
thinking."

Miss Howell points to the Uni
versity of California as an in
stitution which has managed to
provide the girls with a choice
of housing, and which has not
suffered any undue consequen
ces because of it.
Roaming- Free
Closely connected with chang
ing the present undergraduate
female housing regulations is
changing the current women's
social regs. It would seem some
what hypocritical to enforce so
cial regs for girls on campus,
while allowing girls off campus
to roam free. Miss Howell
points out, however, that by of
fering each girl a choice of liv
ing location, the administration
would also be offering her a
choice as to whether or not she
wished to be bound by social
regulations.
A final argument used by
those who desire off campus
living for undergraduate fe
males is the lack of privacy in
dorms. While this sounds de
cidedly sexual, there are many
times when a roommate can be
a decided crimp in an evening's
activities, even if they only in
clude some serious studying.
