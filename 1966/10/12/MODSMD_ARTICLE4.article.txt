# Hurlburt House Claims All Credit
## 
### 
Yesterday The Daily reported in
error that Stillmtin girls had paint
ed the Sigma Chi House, and that
the Sigma Chi's subsequently
"carried away" Stilhnan House.
The painting raid should have
be<'n attributed to the girls of Hurl
burt. House. The Sigma Chi's re
taliated by transporting the move
able possessions of Hurlburt, not of
Stillnian.
The Daily regTets this error and
trusts that the record of events Is
now dear.
