# Kung: Symbol Of Openness, Herald Of Ecumenical Concern
## 
### KIRK HANSON Managing Editor 
Hans Kung is thirty-eight years old.
He is young, enthusiastic, and athletic.
Perhaps his greatest characteristic is
his openness to all. But then this is
just how he wants his church and all
his fellow men to be.
Michael Novak, professor of reli
gion, has described him as a man
"who stands within a community but

speaks for basic human experiences
and human values to which men in
other traditions respond."
When Father Kung came to the
United States on his first speaking
tour in 1963, Robert McAfee Brown
wrote of him: he "has become a kind
of symbol of what Protestants would
like to believe contemporary Roman
Catholicism can become."
Swiss-born Kung studied for the
priesthood at the Gregorian Univer
sity in Rome and was ordained in
1954. He later studied at the Institute
Catholique and the Sorbonne in Paris,
leading to his doctrate in Sacred
Theology.
Barth And Trent
His thesis, "Justification, The Doc
trine of Karl Barth and a Catholic
Reflection," propounded that Karl

Barth's doctrine of justification was
what the Council of Trent really
meant to say.
Dr. Brown has pointed out the
somewhat amusing reaction. Catholics
have said Kung was right about Trent
but could not possibly be right about
Barth. But Protestants have said he
was right about Barth, and could not
possibly be right about Trent.
After two years of parish work in
Lucerne, he began to teach and at
thirty-two was appointed Professor
of Fundamental Theology of the Cath
olic Theological Faculty at the Uni
versity of Tubingen in West Germany.
Last year he was made Dean of that
faculty.
'Kennedy* Of The Church
As an outspoken author and an
official theologian at the Second Vati
can Council, he has come to symbolize
by his youth the modern refromation
of Catholicism. Michael Novak be
lieves that Kung's youth, his shock of
hair, and stance in his world make
him "something of a Kennedy."
Many also sec in him a prophetic
character. The reforms and challenges
he outlined for the Second Vatican
Council in The Council, Reform and
Reunion were so radical that hardly
anybody thought them possible, yet
now his original ideas seem "old and
tame."
Catholicism has opened greatly, and
Hans Kung has progressed with it.
More books on the council have fol
lowed: The Living Church and Struc
tures of the Church. Another, That the
World May Believe is a collection of
letters to a Catholic university stu
dent. His most recent book is entitled
Freedom Today and includes the lec
ture he gave in his last tour of the
United States in 1963.
Rome To Tubingen
Hans Kung even appears as a man
who likes to live dangerously. Once
after a session of the Vatican Council,
he is said to have left Rome in his
European sports car and drive
straight through overnight to Tubin
gen.
Perhaps Father Kung's greatest con
cern is the reunion of the Christian
churches. His hope is expressed in the
introduction to The Council, Reform
and Reunion: "Almost overnight the

reunion of our separated brethern
has ceased to be the concern only of
a brave vanguard, themselves objects
of admiration, ridicule, pity, or hos
tility; it has become the concern of
the universal church."
His lectures at Stanford develop the
theme he has stressed before. Father
Kung will try to answer for himself
and suggest to his audience where the
church is going, in an age of ecumen
ism and reform.

"who stands within a community but

speaks for basic human experiences
and human values to which men in
other traditions respond."
When Father Kung came to the
United States on his first speaking
tour in 1963, Robert McAfee Brown
wrote of him: he "has become a kind
of symbol of what Protestants would
like to believe contemporary Roman
Catholicism can become."
Swiss-born Kung studied for the
priesthood at the Gregorian Univer
sity in Rome and was ordained in
1954. He later studied at the Institute
Catholique and the Sorbonne in Paris,
leading to his doctrate in Sacred
Theology.
Barth And Trent
His thesis, "Justification, The Doc
trine of Karl Barth and a Catholic
Reflection," propounded that Karl

Barth's doctrine of justification was
what the Council of Trent really
meant to say.
Dr. Brown has pointed out the
somewhat amusing reaction. Catholics
have said Kung was right about Trent
but could not possibly be right about
Barth. But Protestants have said he
was right about Barth, and could not
possibly be right about Trent.
After two years of parish work in
Lucerne, he began to teach and at
thirty-two was appointed Professor
of Fundamental Theology of the Cath
olic Theological Faculty at the Uni
versity of Tubingen in West Germany.
Last year he was made Dean of that
faculty.
'Kennedy* Of The Church
As an outspoken author and an
official theologian at the Second Vati
can Council, he has come to symbolize
by his youth the modern refromation
of Catholicism. Michael Novak be
lieves that Kung's youth, his shock of
hair, and stance in his world make
him "something of a Kennedy."
Many also sec in him a prophetic
character. The reforms and challenges
he outlined for the Second Vatican
Council in The Council, Reform and
Reunion were so radical that hardly
anybody thought them possible, yet
now his original ideas seem "old and
tame."
Catholicism has opened greatly, and
Hans Kung has progressed with it.
More books on the council have fol
lowed: The Living Church and Struc
tures of the Church. Another, That the
World May Believe is a collection of
letters to a Catholic university stu
dent. His most recent book is entitled
Freedom Today and includes the lec
ture he gave in his last tour of the
United States in 1963.
Rome To Tubingen
Hans Kung even appears as a man
who likes to live dangerously. Once
after a session of the Vatican Council,
he is said to have left Rome in his
European sports car and drive
straight through overnight to Tubin
gen.
Perhaps Father Kung's greatest con
cern is the reunion of the Christian
churches. His hope is expressed in the
introduction to The Council, Reform
and Reunion: "Almost overnight the

reunion of our separated brethern
has ceased to be the concern only of
a brave vanguard, themselves objects
of admiration, ridicule, pity, or hos
tility; it has become the concern of
the universal church."
His lectures at Stanford develop the
theme he has stressed before. Father
Kung will try to answer for himself
and suggest to his audience where the
church is going, in an age of ecumen
ism and reform.

Hans Kung is thirty-eight years old.
He is young, enthusiastic, and athletic.
Perhaps his greatest characteristic is
his openness to all. But then this is
just how he wants his church and all
his fellow men to be.
