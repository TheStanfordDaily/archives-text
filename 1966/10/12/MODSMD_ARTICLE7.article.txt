# Cranston Admits Leadership Gap
## 
### STEVE GRUBER Political Editor 
State Controller Alan Cranston ad
mitted yesterday that Governor
Brown is "a poor political leader" in
a speech at Tresidder.
Cranston, a Stanford graduate,
made the statement in reference to a
student's question about the political
leadership vacuum in California.
Speaking to an afternoon audience
of 175, Cranston also covered such
far-ranging topics as California's
Gross National Product, political ac
tivity at Berkeley, the state property
tax, and Simon Cassady, former head
of the California Democratic Council
(CDC).
Vacuum
When referring to the alleged
leadership vacuum in the Democratic
party, Cranston said, "He (Governor
Brown) is a great human being, a
great fund raiser, and a great admin
istrator, but a poor political leader."
There is also a leadership vacuum
in the Republican party, according to
Cranston. "There are fine men seek
ing to lead the party," he said, "but
they have been outmanuevered."
Yorty
Cranston, who is running for a
third term, stated that he did not feel
that Yorty's silence on the campaign
will hurt Brown's reelection chances.
"One political figure can't transfer his
voting appeal to others," he said.
The San Francisco riots have caused
a drop in Brown's popularity as re
ported in the last California Poll, ac
cording to Cranston.
"I am no more happy about the
Vietnam policy than most people,"
Cranston commented. He said that he
is opposed to both escalation of or
withdrawal from the war, but would
support another cessation of the
North Vietnam bombing raids.
Berkeley Politics
Political activity at Berkeley should
be as free as possible according to

Cranston. "However the University
does have a right to regulate it,"he
said.
Cranston, State Controller since
1958, said that his office made calcu
lations based on California's produc
tivity. If this state were a nation, it
would be ranked seventh in the world
in terms of gross national product. "I
do not think those other great peoples
of the top six nations would select a
man whose occupation is amuse
ments," he said.
"Some people say that Ronald Rea
gan couldn't really do much harm in
four years," Cranston said, "but this
is a very shortsighted approach."
Appointments
He illustrated his statement by
pointing out that the last Democratic
Governor of California, who was
elected in 1938, still has three of his
California Supreme Court appointees
in office.
"Reagan's appointments could stay
on the Court until the year 2000," he
said, "and Reagan has refused to
deny that he would appoint Birchers
to the Supreme Court."
Cranston cited the same point with
the Board of Regents of the Univer
sity of California. "I don't think we
would want the kind of people he
would appoint," he commented.
Property Tax
Reducing the property tax will be
high on Cranston's agenda if he is re
elected. He does not think that it is
a fair tax and would replace the lost
revenue by increasing the sales tax
and the state income tax.
In a question and answer period
following his speech, Cranston said
that he did join the effort to remove
Simon Casady as CDC president. "His
behavior was not that of a responsible
leader of the Democratic party. He
made violent attacks on the Presi
dent, the Governor, and the Demo
cratic party itself" Cranston said.

Brown) is a great human being, a
great fund raiser, and a great admin
istrator, but a poor political leader."
There is also a leadership vacuum
in the Republican party, according to
Cranston. "There are fine men seek
ing to lead the party," he said, "but
they have been outmanuevered."
Yorty
Cranston, who is running for a
third term, stated that he did not feel
that Yorty's silence on the campaign
will hurt Brown's reelection chances.
"One political figure can't transfer his
voting appeal to others," he said.
The San Francisco riots have caused
a drop in Brown's popularity as re
ported in the last California Poll, ac
cording to Cranston.
"I am no more happy about the
Vietnam policy than most people,"
Cranston commented. He said that he
is opposed to both escalation of or
withdrawal from the war, but would
support another cessation of the
North Vietnam bombing raids.
Berkeley Politics
Political activity at Berkeley should
be as free as possible according to

Cranston. "However the University
does have a right to regulate it,"he
said.
Cranston, State Controller since
1958, said that his office made calcu
lations based on California's produc
tivity. If this state were a nation, it
would be ranked seventh in the world
in terms of gross national product. "I
do not think those other great peoples
of the top six nations would select a
man whose occupation is amuse
ments," he said.
"Some people say that Ronald Rea
gan couldn't really do much harm in
four years," Cranston said, "but this
is a very shortsighted approach."
Appointments
He illustrated his statement by
pointing out that the last Democratic
Governor of California, who was
elected in 1938, still has three of his
California Supreme Court appointees
in office.
"Reagan's appointments could stay
on the Court until the year 2000," he
said, "and Reagan has refused to
deny that he would appoint Birchers
to the Supreme Court."
Cranston cited the same point with
the Board of Regents of the Univer
sity of California. "I don't think we
would want the kind of people he
would appoint," he commented.
Property Tax
Reducing the property tax will be
high on Cranston's agenda if he is re
elected. He does not think that it is
a fair tax and would replace the lost
revenue by increasing the sales tax
and the state income tax.
In a question and answer period
following his speech, Cranston said
that he did join the effort to remove
Simon Casady as CDC president. "His
behavior was not that of a responsible
leader of the Democratic party. He
made violent attacks on the Presi
dent, the Governor, and the Demo
cratic party itself" Cranston said.
State Controller Alan Cranston ad
mitted yesterday that Governor
Brown is "a poor political leader" in
a speech at Tresidder.
Cranston, a Stanford graduate,
made the statement in reference to a
student's question about the political
leadership vacuum in California.
Speaking to an afternoon audience
of 175, Cranston also covered such
far-ranging topics as California's
Gross National Product, political ac
tivity at Berkeley, the state property
tax, and Simon Cassady, former head
of the California Democratic Council
(CDC).
