## 
### KIRK HANEN Associate Editor 
Analyzing a phenomenon that is
"far from new and not necessarily
right-wing," two-time Pulitzer Prize
winner Richard Hofstadter will speak
on "The Paranoid Style in American
Politics," Friday at 4:15 p.m. in Dinkel
spiel Auditorium.
Hofstadter, Professor of history at
Columbia, is at Stanford to kick-off
Stern Hall's 1966-67 Guest-in-Resi
dence program.
This evening at 8 p.m., Hofstadter
will head an open-topic discussion in
Muir Lounge. Tomorrow afternoon at
3:15 he will hold a history seminar,
"Jeffersonian Democracy and Politi
cial Parties," in room 214 of History
Corner.
Tomorrow night at 7:30, he will be
featured speaker on "The Republican
Party in 1968." Backing up Hofstadter
will be Professor Robert Horn of the
Political Science department, and
Thomas A. Bailey, Margaret Byrne
Professor of history.
Acclaimed
Hofstadter will take his topic for
Friday's speech from the title of one
of his most highly acclaimed works,
The Paranoid Style in American Pol
ities, oublished in 1965.

Hofstadter has called it the paranoid
style "simply because no other word
adequately evokes the sense of heated
exaggeration, suspiciousness, and con
spiratorial fancy that I have in
mind."
As Hofstadter has shown, this para
noia is not peculiar to today's right
wing, but has been prominent
throughout American history.
"One finds it in the Anti-Mason
movement, the Anti-Catholic move
ment, in certain spokesmen of aboli
tionism who regarded the United
States as being in the grip of a slave
holder's conspiracy, in many alarmists
about the Mormons, in some Green
back and Populist writers who con
structed a great conspiracy of inter
national bankers, in the popular left-

wing press, and on both sides of the
race controversy today, among White
Citizens Councils and Black Muslims,"
Hofstadter writes.
"Today," he adds, "the mantle of
McCarthy has fallen on a retired
candy manufacturer, Robert H. Welch
Jr., who is less strategically placed
and has a much smaller but better
organized following than the Senator."
For the paranoid, the political spec
trum runs to either blacks or whites,
Hofstadter says. It's always a five
alarm situation.
"The paranoid spokesman . . . traf
fics in the birth and death of whole
worlds, whole political orders, whole
systems of human values. He is al
ways manning the barricades of civili
zation."
