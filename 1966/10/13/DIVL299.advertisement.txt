The Yellow Pages lists about 2000 restaurants in
San Francisco. Our little red book only covers 55.
We're not the Yellow Pages. We're a selective and a subjective guide.
Most of the restaurants in The Collegiate Guide are non-touristy, atmospheric, and off
the beaten path. All price ranges. All food styles. From Hungarian Palachintas to Tournedos
Rossini.
We also don't accept ads, whih means that you are reading our opinions, not the restaur
ant's opinion of itself.
You may sometimes disagree with our opinions and conclusions. If so, there's always the
Yellow Pages.
