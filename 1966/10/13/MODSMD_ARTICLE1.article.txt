# Conservative' Trustees Prevent Changes
## 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL (Third in a Series) 
Boards of trustees of American universities
are controlled by the old, the rich, and the
conservative, critics state, and as a result, the
university has a built-in block to change.
Reinforcing this structural hindrance to
change are various practices which also tend
to perpetuate the status quo and prevent in
trusion of forces bringing change.
The most important of these practices is the
method of selection, which, at least in private
universities, is co-option, i.e. selection of suc
cessors by the remaining members of the
board.
Fosters Continuity
Co-option is defended as fostering continui
ty, and affording "some protection against the
storms of public opinion and political and reli
gious controversies" (Hubert Beck).
Criticisms against it, however, are over
whelming. First, it is remote from and unre
sponsive to popular control, control by con
stituents or external controls of any type. In
other words, a board changes only if it wants
to and can be oblivious to outside forces if it
so chooses.

Thus, it is difficult to remedy abuses effec
tively and to accomplish any reforms which
may be called for.
Unwanted Minorities
Also, board majorities are "given the power
to eliminate unwanted minorities and to per
petuate their own point of view and the uni
versity satus quo in general" (Beck).
Perhaps the greatest danger in the selection
process, whereby board membership is main
tained in the upper few percent of the popula
tion (according to income, occupation and so
cial standing), is its effect on board policy.
There is a close tie between an individual's
thinking and his life situation, status, and ex
perience.
Social Position
Karl Mannheim made a study of the effects
of a person's relationship to the ruling class
on his own ideas and personal perspective. His
finding was: "it could be shown in all cases
that not only do fundamental orientations,
evaluations, and the content of ideas differ but
that the manner of stating a problem, the sort
of approach made, and even the categories in
which experiences are subsumed, collected,

and ordered vary according to the social posi
tion of the observer." And thus the danger for
board policy in having the board controlled by
a self perpetuating group.
Another board practice which has drawn the
attention of scholars is length of service on
the board, a balance being desired between
continuity of board policy and freshness of
approach.
"Wisdom and broad knowledge of men and
affairs, ordinarily associated with the maturi
ty of the middle and upper age brackets, and
imagination and the spirit of adventure, more
likely to characterize the younger ages, are
the ingredients to be sought in the proper pro
portions," Donald Belcher writes in a self
study commissioned by the trustees of the
University of Pennsylvania.
Terms of Office
In terms of years, several observers have
recommended that terms of office be set at
about six years, with perhaps one additional
term allowed and an upper age limitation of
70.
In commenting on current practices (ten
year terms, usually renewable), Ordway Tead

has said: "the end in view is not controlled by
mere physical age; somehow the injection of
a more youthful point of view, of an outlook
somewhat nearer in age to that of students,
would certainly not be amiss in trustee discus
sions."
"The values of long familiarity," he says,
"have to be set over against those of freshness
of view and of new enthusiasm; and my own
estimate is that, on balance, there is usually
greater benefit in having limitations upon ten
ure of office than in long years of uninter
rupted board service."
Meeting Practices
Practices on board meetings and committees
varies greatly. Frequency, duration, and sub
ject matter of board meetings is dictated by
such considerations as board composition and
size, and the committee structure.
Standard practice seems to dictate meetings
of the full board anywhere from quarterly to
monthly. Trustees themselves seem to feel
that greater frequency is beneficial, because
they can thereby spend more time in delibera
tion of important items and thus reduce the
feeling that they are called together periodic

ally to approve recommendations from the
president and trustee committees.
Much board work is carried on between
meetings by the trustee committees, which
meet officially just prior to the board meeting
itself.
Rotate Assignments
For the best long-term effectiveness, many
observers have recommended that limitations
be put on the tenure of committee appoint
ments and that there be rotation of assign
ments. This procedure is advisable because, in
the words of Alfred North Whitehead, what is
desired on boards is the ability "to see the
chessboard as a whole."
Five years seems to be the accepted length
of service. Recommendations for improving
the committee structure usually include: 1)
use of non-trustees on advisory committees;
2) early committee decisions on issues of spe
cial importance.
The thrust of committee action should be to
clear away the details and clarify the central
issues so that the full board may devote itself
to meaningful discussion of long-range educa
tional issues.

a self perpetuating group.
Another board practice which has drawn the
attention of scholars is length of service on
the board, a balance being desired between
continuity of board policy and freshness of
approach.
"Wisdom and broad knowledge of men and
affairs, ordinarily associated with the maturi
ty of the middle and upper age brackets, and
imagination and the spirit of adventure, more
likely to characterize the younger ages, are
the ingredients to be sought in the proper pro
portions," Donald Belcher writes in a self
study commissioned by the trustees of the
University of Pennsylvania.
Terms of Office
In terms of years, several observers have
recommended that terms of office be set at
about six years, with perhaps one additional
term allowed and an upper age limitation of
70.
In commenting on current practices (ten
year terms, usually renewable), Ordway Tead

has said: "the end in view is not controlled by
mere physical age; somehow the injection of
a more youthful point of view, of an outlook
somewhat nearer in age to that of students,
would certainly not be amiss in trustee discus
sions."
"The values of long familiarity," he says,
"have to be set over against those of freshness
of view and of new enthusiasm; and my own
estimate is that, on balance, there is usually
greater benefit in having limitations upon ten
ure of office than in long years of uninter
rupted board service."
Meeting Practices
Practices on board meetings and committees
varies greatly. Frequency, duration, and sub
ject matter of board meetings is dictated by
such considerations as board composition and
size, and the committee structure.
Standard practice seems to dictate meetings
of the full board anywhere from quarterly to
monthly. Trustees themselves seem to feel
that greater frequency is beneficial, because
they can thereby spend more time in delibera
tion of important items and thus reduce the
feeling that they are called together periodic

ally to approve recommendations from the
president and trustee committees.
Much board work is carried on between
meetings by the trustee committees, which
meet officially just prior to the board meeting
itself.
Rotate Assignments
For the best long-term effectiveness, many
observers have recommended that limitations
be put on the tenure of committee appoint
ments and that there be rotation of assign
ments. This procedure is advisable because, in
the words of Alfred North Whitehead, what is
desired on boards is the ability "to see the
chessboard as a whole."
Five years seems to be the accepted length
of service. Recommendations for improving
the committee structure usually include: 1)
use of non-trustees on advisory committees;
2) early committee decisions on issues of spe
cial importance.
The thrust of committee action should be to
clear away the details and clarify the central
issues so that the full board may devote itself
to meaningful discussion of long-range educa
tional issues.
(Next Week: Academic Advisory Boards)
Boards of trustees of American universities
are controlled by the old, the rich, and the
conservative, critics state, and as a result, the
university has a built-in block to change.
Reinforcing this structural hindrance to
change are various practices which also tend
to perpetuate the status quo and prevent in
trusion of forces bringing change.
The most important of these practices is the
method of selection, which, at least in private
universities, is co-option, i.e. selection of suc
cessors by the remaining members of the
board.
Fosters Continuity
Co-option is defended as fostering continui
ty, and affording "some protection against the
storms of public opinion and political and reli
gious controversies" (Hubert Beck).
Criticisms against it, however, are over
whelming. First, it is remote from and unre
sponsive to popular control, control by con
stituents or external controls of any type. In
other words, a board changes only if it wants
to and can be oblivious to outside forces if it
so chooses.

Thus, it is difficult to remedy abuses effec
tively and to accomplish any reforms which
may be called for.
Unwanted Minorities
Also, board majorities are "given the power
to eliminate unwanted minorities and to per
petuate their own point of view and the uni
versity satus quo in general" (Beck).
Perhaps the greatest danger in the selection
process, whereby board membership is main
tained in the upper few percent of the popula
tion (according to income, occupation and so
cial standing), is its effect on board policy.
There is a close tie between an individual's
thinking and his life situation, status, and ex
perience.
Social Position
Karl Mannheim made a study of the effects
of a person's relationship to the ruling class
on his own ideas and personal perspective. His
finding was: "it could be shown in all cases
that not only do fundamental orientations,
evaluations, and the content of ideas differ but
that the manner of stating a problem, the sort
of approach made, and even the categories in
which experiences are subsumed, collected,

and ordered vary according to the social posi
tion of the observer." And thus the danger for
board policy in having the board controlled by

the words of Alfred North Whitehead, what is
desired on boards is the ability "to see the
chessboard as a whole."
Five years seems to be the accepted length
of service. Recommendations for improving
the committee structure usually include: 1)
use of non-trustees on advisory committees;
2) early committee decisions on issues of spe

The thrust of committee action should be to
clear away the details and clarify the central
issues so that the full board may devote itself
to meaningful discussion of long-range educa

(Next Week: Academic Advisory Boards)
Boards of trustees of American universities
are controlled by the old, the rich, and the
conservative, critics state, and as a result, the
university has a built-in block to change.
Reinforcing this structural hindrance to
change are various practices which also tend
to perpetuate the status quo and prevent in
trusion of forces bringing change.
The most important of these practices is the
method of selection, which, at least in private
universities, is co-option, i.e. selection of suc
cessors by the remaining members of the
board.
Fosters Continuity
Co-option is defended as fostering continui
ty, and affording "some protection against the
storms of public opinion and political and reli
gious controversies" (Hubert Beck).
Criticisms against it, however, are over
whelming. First, it is remote from and unre
sponsive to popular control, control by con
stituents or external controls of any type. In
other words, a board changes only if it wants
to and can be oblivious to outside forces if it
so chooses.

Thus, it is difficult to remedy abuses effec
tively and to accomplish any reforms which
may be called for.
Unwanted Minorities
Also, board majorities are "given the power
to eliminate unwanted minorities and to per
petuate their own point of view and the uni
versity satus quo in general" (Beck).
Perhaps the greatest danger in the selection
process, whereby board membership is main
tained in the upper few percent of the popula
tion (according to income, occupation and so
cial standing), is its effect on board policy.
There is a close tie between an individual's
thinking and his life situation, status, and ex
perience.
Social Position
Karl Mannheim made a study of the effects
of a person's relationship to the ruling class
on his own ideas and personal perspective. His
finding was: "it could be shown in all cases
that not only do fundamental orientations,
evaluations, and the content of ideas differ but
that the manner of stating a problem, the sort
of approach made, and even the categories in
which experiences are subsumed, collected,

and ordered vary according to the social posi
tion of the observer." And thus the danger for
board policy in having the board controlled by
a self perpetuating group.
Another board practice which has drawn the
attention of scholars is length of service on
the board, a balance being desired between
continuity of board policy and freshness of
approach.
"Wisdom and broad knowledge of men and
affairs, ordinarily associated with the maturi
ty of the middle and upper age brackets, and
imagination and the spirit of adventure, more
likely to characterize the younger ages, are
the ingredients to be sought in the proper pro
portions," Donald Belcher writes in a self
study commissioned by the trustees of the
University of Pennsylvania.
Terms of Office
In terms of years, several observers have
recommended that terms of office be set at
about six years, with perhaps one additional
term allowed and an upper age limitation of
70.
In commenting on current practices (ten
year terms, usually renewable), Ordway Tead

has said: "the end in view is not controlled by
mere physical age; somehow the injection of
a more youthful point of view, of an outlook
somewhat nearer in age to that of students,
would certainly not be amiss in trustee discus
sions."
"The values of long familiarity," he says,
"have to be set over against those of freshness
of view and of new enthusiasm; and my own
estimate is that, on balance, there is usually
greater benefit in having limitations upon ten
ure of office than in long years of uninter
rupted board service."
Meeting Practices
Practices on board meetings and committees
varies greatly. Frequency, duration, and sub
ject matter of board meetings is dictated by
such considerations as board composition and
size, and the committee structure.
Standard practice seems to dictate meetings
of the full board anywhere from quarterly to
monthly. Trustees themselves seem to feel
that greater frequency is beneficial, because
they can thereby spend more time in delibera
tion of important items and thus reduce the
feeling that they are called together periodic

ally to approve recommendations from the
president and trustee committees.
Much board work is carried on between
meetings by the trustee committees, which
meet officially just prior to the board meeting
itself.
Rotate Assignments
For the best long-term effectiveness, many
observers have recommended that limitations
be put on the tenure of committee appoint
ments and that there be rotation of assign
ments. This procedure is advisable because, in
the words of Alfred North Whitehead, what is
desired on boards is the ability "to see the
