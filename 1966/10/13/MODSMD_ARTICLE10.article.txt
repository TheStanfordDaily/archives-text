# Nominees Seek LASSU Consent

Student Body President Dave Har
ris seeks legislature reapproval of
his five appointees to the Committee
of Fifteen in today's LASSU session at
7:30 p.m. in Room 320.
Also on the agenda is a resolution
calling for a committee to study the
application of the Fundamental Stan
dard as it presents conflicts of one's
moral beliefs with student law and
University policy.
If reapproved as is expected, the

Committee of Fifteen's five-student
delegation of Dave Harris, Tom Forst
enzer, Jan Handke, Martin Gerry
and Charles Dupree will confer with
faculty and administration represen
tatives tomorrow to tackle the issue
of open house rules.
Since last spring, when LASSU lib
eralized open house policy in conflict
with University rules, a double-stan
dard has existed. LASSU Speaker Tom
Forstenzer hopes that tomorrow's
meeting "will lead to a solution," add
ing, "I think the legislature has bent
over backwards in the past."
The measure to evaluate the Funda
mental Standard is the result of "situ
ations in which students feel deeply
and conscientiously motivated to vio
late (student law and University pol
icy) in order to call attention to, or
correct, more serious violations on the
part of other groups within the Uni
versity," according to the bill's spon
sor, John Shi'ppee, a grad student.
Forstenzer speculated that the idea
for the measure, which would have
four legislators and two members of
the Judicial Council study the Stan
dard, might have emerged from last
spring's student protests to on cam
pus deferment exams.
Other measures before LASSU to
day involve appropriations bills of
$1500 and $1895 which, respectively,
would permit the ASSU President to
present a Conference on Higher Edu
cation and the Student Faculty Board
to carry out several programs. The
latter would include hostels, sympo
siums and publication of The Stan
ford Professor, a book of background
information on all Stanford profes
sors.
A final measure seeks the appropri
ation of $1000 to enable the Housing
Commission to carry out its program
this year.

part of other groups within the Uni
versity," according to the bill's spon
sor, John Shi'ppee, a grad student.
Forstenzer speculated that the idea
for the measure, which would have
four legislators and two members of
the Judicial Council study the Stan
dard, might have emerged from last
spring's student protests to on cam
pus deferment exams.
Other measures before LASSU to
day involve appropriations bills of
$1500 and $1895 which, respectively,
would permit the ASSU President to
present a Conference on Higher Edu
cation and the Student Faculty Board
to carry out several programs. The
latter would include hostels, sympo
siums and publication of The Stan
ford Professor, a book of background
information on all Stanford profes
sors.
A final measure seeks the appropri
ation of $1000 to enable the Housing
Commission to carry out its program
this year.
Student Body President Dave Har
ris seeks legislature reapproval of
his five appointees to the Committee
of Fifteen in today's LASSU session at
7:30 p.m. in Room 320.
Also on the agenda is a resolution
calling for a committee to study the
application of the Fundamental Stan
dard as it presents conflicts of one's
moral beliefs with student law and
University policy.
If reapproved as is expected, the

Committee of Fifteen's five-student
delegation of Dave Harris, Tom Forst
enzer, Jan Handke, Martin Gerry
and Charles Dupree will confer with
faculty and administration represen
tatives tomorrow to tackle the issue
of open house rules.
Since last spring, when LASSU lib
eralized open house policy in conflict
with University rules, a double-stan
dard has existed. LASSU Speaker Tom
Forstenzer hopes that tomorrow's
meeting "will lead to a solution," add
ing, "I think the legislature has bent
over backwards in the past."
The measure to evaluate the Funda
mental Standard is the result of "situ
ations in which students feel deeply
and conscientiously motivated to vio
late (student law and University pol
icy) in order to call attention to, or
correct, more serious violations on the
part of other groups within the Uni
versity," according to the bill's spon
sor, John Shi'ppee, a grad student.
