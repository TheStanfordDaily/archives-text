# Harris Opposes Draft Operations
## 
### 
Focusing on "the current situation
in current language" Assistant Pro
fessor of History Paul Seaver led a
discussion yesterday on conscientious
objection.
Participating in the forum were
Dave Harris, ASSU president, and
English Teaching Assistant David
Ransom. Harris was not speaking in
his official capacity as ASSU presi
dent.
Harris stated that he "did not ac
cept the mechanism of the draft at
all. Application for conscientious ob
jector infers that the draft board has
the right to make the decision." Har
ris feels that the first step toward
peace involves talking to each other;
and"the first step toward talking to
each other is refusing to fight with
each other."
According to his philosophy, one
has to make a basic choice as to "how
he wants to live and how he wants
to relate to other people." He con
tinued, "participating in destruction
negates any attempt to build."
Ransom, who recently had to sub
mit a brief concerning his own draft
status quoted Thoreau's philosophy
that he was "at war with the state."
He "arrived at this decision through
contemporary experience, first op
posing the war in Vietnam . . . and
then other wars." He concluded that
"only by refusing to fight can an in
dividual survive . . . although he must
accept that there will be a lot of
domination and misery whether men
fight or not."
Seaver serves as the university
counselor on conscientious objection.
He announced that a counselling
desk was to be manned in the old
women's clubhouse.
The meeting was sponsored by the
Religious Society of Friends which
plans to hold further Wednesday dis
cussions on this topic.
