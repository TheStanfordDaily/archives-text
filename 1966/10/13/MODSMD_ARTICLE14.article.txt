# History Professor Proposes Changes In U.S. Constitution
## 
### BILL EVERS 
Edgar E. Robinson, Margaret
Byrne Professor of American
History, Emeritus, and founder
of Stanford's Institute of Amer
ican History, has lately engaged
the attention of persons all over
the United States because of his
views on the growth of presi
dential power in foreign affairs
in relation to America's funda
mental law.
In the recently published
study Powers of the President
in Foreign Affairs, for which
Professor Robinson was both
the editor and a contributor, in
an interview September 22 for
the Palo Alto Times, and in an
interview last week for the
Stanford Daily, Professor Rob
inson expressed his belief that
"it would be a healthy thing"
to clear up the violent disagree
ments about the extent of presi
dential power by calling a new
Constitutional Convention and
also by setting before the world

a national "Declaration of Pur
pose" on the subject of interna
tional relations.
Professor Robinson discussed
the problem of arranging some
method whereby the President
could determine whether att un
derstanding consensus of the
public backed him in any steps
toward war.
Professor Robinson feels that
the traditional method—obtain
ing a vote of two-thirds of the
Senate—is outmoded and often
unusued in this age of unde
clared limited wars, nuclear
brinksmanship, personal diplo
macy, and executive agree
ments.
In the past attempts have
been made to alter the Consti
tution in order to bring deci
sions on matters of war and
peace closer to the electorate it
self. It was proposed in 1924
and again 1938 that the Consti
tution be revised to provide for
a referendum upon a declara

tion of war or steps toward war.
In 1954 a modified version o„
the Bricker Amendment, which
sought to give Congress certain
controls over executive agree
ments, came within one vote of
passage in the Senate.
When President Wilson asked
on April 2, 1917, for a declare
tion of war against Germany
he began by saying, "Gentlemen
of the Congress: I have called
the Congress into extraordinary
sessions because there are seri
ous, very serious choices of pol
icy to be made, and made immed
iately, which it was neither riglv
nor constitutionally permissible
thai I should assume the respon
sibility of making."
But the times have changed,
and Professor Robinson believes
that the increased immediacy of
every crisis during the nuclear
age has rendered obsolete th
existing Constitutional method
of declaring a war after delibe
ration by the Senate. He looks
to his proposed Constitutional
Convention or to a new amend
ment to provide machinery for
considering the views of the
public.
Any revising of the Const it u
tion would, of course, be a very
time-consuming operation. Pro
fessor Robinson's Declaration
of Purpose could, however, be
acted on right now.
A resolution would be submit
ted to Congress stating tha
still maintaining the "decent
respect to the opinions of man
kind" that we did in 1776, we
now support by a vote of the
Congress, endorsed by a referen
dum, our purpose to act on be
half of order and freedom In
the world.
What Professor Robinson
hopes for is that our national
Declaration of Purpose would
contain something along the
lines of President Wilson's con
cept of "making the world safe
for democracy," in other words,
maintaining so far as might Im
possible a situation where na
tions which chose to follow the
path toward democracy could
do so.
Such a Declaration of Purpose
would provoke considerable de
bate. Many persons look upc
what seems to be the evolutio/i
of the U.S. into a policing agent
which Professor Robinson de
scribes as "a unilateral substi
tute for the United Nations, the
Atlantic Alliance, the Organiza
tion of American States, and the
Southeast Asia Treaty Organ'
zation" as immoral.
Opinion polls seem to indicate,
nonetheless, that most persons
view matters like the Domini
can Republic crisis and the Viet
Nam war as certainly somewhat
regrettable, but also unavoid
able given America's networ,.
commitment and America's
stance as the defender of order
and freedom.
