• Brandt Visits East Berlin
BERLIN—West Berlin Mayor Willy Brandt
in an unprecedented action met for four hours
at dinner last night with the Soviet ambassa
dor to East Germany in the Soviet Embassy
behind the Communist wall.
His black car went through the U.S. Army's
Checkpoint Charlie crossing point without stop
ping. West Berlin police cleared the vehicle's
path past waiting newsmen.
"A free exchange of views concerning ques
tions of mutual interest took place," the agency
added.
• Branca Purges Congressmen
RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil—President Hum
berto Castello Branco yesterday purged six
Brazilian congressmen and suspended their po
litical rights for 10 years. He also suspended
the political rights of four lesser elected of
ficials for the same period.
Two of the purged federal deputies are form
er close associates of ex-presidents Juscelino
Kubitschek and Joao Goulart, now negotiating
a political alliance against Castello Branco.
Kubitschek and Goulart, whom Castello
Branco overthrew, both live in exile. However,
sources close to the negotiations said the purge
of the congressmen had nothing to do with the

proposed opposition alliance.
It was the first time since July that the
President used his extraordinary powers to re
move any elected official from office and strip
any Brazilian of his political rights. Since
Castello Branco came to power in 1964, more
than 400 Brazilians have had their political
rights suspended.
• Conservative Praises Heath
BLACKPOOL, England — A ranking con
servative leader called yesterday for a nation
wide campaign to oust Harold Wilson's Labor
Government and to elect Edward Heath as
Britain's Prime Minister.
Nearly 4,000 delegates attending the 84th an
nual convention of the Conservative Party
cheered Chairman Edward Du Cann's defini
tion of their shared aim:
"The defeat of Socialism and the restoration
of sound conservative government."

• Cabinet Split Threatens Ky
SAIGON —Regional differences threatening
a split in the cabinet embarrassed Premier
Nguyen Cao Ky yesterday as he made plans
for the Manila summit conference two weeks
hence.
Ky had hoped to present his 16-month-old

regime as united and stable when he goes to
the Manila meeting of seven nations. But one
cabinet member has resigned and informants
said five others have laid their resignations on
Ky's desk.
The immediate cause of the crisis was the
recent arrest of a high official in the health
department.
But the real cause ol the crisis is the tradi
tional mutual distrust and suspicion of north
ern and southern leaders in South Vietnam.

• Johnson Calls For Increase
BALTIMORE — President Johnson called
yesterday for congressional action next year

to increase social security benefits an aver
age 10 per cent. House Republicans countered
with a call for immediate action.
Addressing a social security awards cere
mony here, Johnson proposed increases total
ing at least $2.2 billion a year in benefits to
become effective Jan. 1, 1968.
The 10 per cent increase he proposed would
average $8.50 a month for each pensioner.
He suggested also a minimum monthly check
of $100 —compared with the present $44 —for
anyone with 25 years of coverage.
• Senate Votes Campaign Funds
WASHINGTON—The Senate voted 39 to
33 yesterday in favor of a broad proposal
for government financing of presidential cam
paigns out of voluntary contributions made
by income taxpayers.
The plan, sponsored by Sen. Russell B.
Long, D-La., could make $70 million avail
able to pay expenses of the 1968 campaign.
This sum would be split equally between the
Democrats and Republicans.
The plan also would allow a third party to
get aid if its candidate received at least 1.5
million votes in the last election.

• Market Scores Huge Gains
NEW YORK — The stock market roared
ahead yesterday to its biggest single day's
gain in almost three years.
Some Wall Streeters said the surge in the
final trading hours was linked to yesterday's
statement by Secretary of Commerce John T.
Connor that there are no present indications
economic controls will be needed to support
the Vietnam war.
The market picked up from a slow start and
shot ahead near the close.
Prices climbed for many stocks including
blue chips and the high-flying glamor issues
that had taken a beating recently.
• Jets Collide In Air Show
INDIAN SPRINGS, Nev.—Two Air Force
Thunderbird Air Show jets collided at 6,000
feet yesterday during practice maneuvers
northwest of Las Vegas, killing two fliers in
one of the planes.
One of the fliers ejected from his plane and
plummeted to the ground with his ejection
seat still strapped on. His parachute didn't
open. The other rode the plane to the ground
in a fatal nosedive, Air Force officers said.

WASHINGTON—The Senate voted 39 to
33 yesterday in favor of a broad proposal
for government financing of presidential cam
paigns out of voluntary contributions made
by income taxpayers.
The plan, sponsored by Sen. Russell B.
Long, D-La., could make $70 million avail
able to pay expenses of the 1968 campaign.
This sum would be split equally between the
Democrats and Republicans.
The plan also would allow a third party to
get aid if its candidate received at least 1.5
million votes in the last election.

NEW YORK — The stock market roared

Some Wall Streeters said the surge in the

Connor that there are no present indications
economic controls will be needed to support
the Vietnam war.
The market picked up from a slow start and

Prices climbed for many stocks including
blue chips and the high-flying glamor issues
that had taken a beating recently.

• Branca Purges Congressmen
RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil—President Hum

Brazilian congressmen and suspended their po

the political rights of four lesser elected of

Two of the purged federal deputies are form
er close associates of ex-presidents Juscelino
Kubitschek and Joao Goulart, now negotiating
a political alliance against Castello Branco.
Kubitschek and Goulart, whom Castello
Branco overthrew, both live in exile. However,
sources close to the negotiations said the purge
of the congressmen had nothing to do with the

proposed opposition alliance.
It was the first time since July that the
President used his extraordinary powers to re
move any elected official from office and strip
any Brazilian of his political rights. Since
Castello Branco came to power in 1964, more
than 400 Brazilians have had their political
rights suspended.

The immediate cause of the crisis was the

• Cabinet Split Threatens Ky
SAIGON —Regional differences threatening
a split in the cabinet embarrassed Premier
Nguyen Cao Ky yesterday as he made plans
for the Manila summit conference two weeks
hence.
Ky had hoped to present his 16-month-old

regime as united and stable when he goes to
the Manila meeting of seven nations. But one
cabinet member has resigned and informants
said five others have laid their resignations on
Ky's desk.
The immediate cause of the crisis was the
recent arrest of a high official in the health
department.
But the real cause ol the crisis is the tradi
tional mutual distrust and suspicion of north
ern and southern leaders in South Vietnam.

• Johnson Calls For Increase
BALTIMORE — President Johnson called
yesterday for congressional action next year

to increase social security benefits an aver
age 10 per cent. House Republicans countered
with a call for immediate action.
Addressing a social security awards cere
mony here, Johnson proposed increases total
ing at least $2.2 billion a year in benefits to
become effective Jan. 1, 1968.

average $8.50 a month for each pensioner.

of $100 —compared with the present $44 —for
anyone with 25 years of coverage.
• Senate Votes Campaign Funds
WASHINGTON—The Senate voted 39 to
33 yesterday in favor of a broad proposal
for government financing of presidential cam
paigns out of voluntary contributions made
by income taxpayers.
The plan, sponsored by Sen. Russell B.
Long, D-La., could make $70 million avail
able to pay expenses of the 1968 campaign.
This sum would be split equally between the
Democrats and Republicans.
The plan also would allow a third party to
get aid if its candidate received at least 1.5
million votes in the last election.

• Market Scores Huge Gains
NEW YORK — The stock market roared
ahead yesterday to its biggest single day's
gain in almost three years.
Some Wall Streeters said the surge in the
final trading hours was linked to yesterday's
statement by Secretary of Commerce John T.
Connor that there are no present indications
economic controls will be needed to support
the Vietnam war.
The market picked up from a slow start and
shot ahead near the close.
Prices climbed for many stocks including
blue chips and the high-flying glamor issues
that had taken a beating recently.

• Brandt Visits East Berlin
BERLIN—West Berlin Mayor Willy Brandt
in an unprecedented action met for four hours
at dinner last night with the Soviet ambassa

behind the Communist wall.
His black car went through the U.S. Army's
Checkpoint Charlie crossing point without stop
ping. West Berlin police cleared the vehicle's
path past waiting newsmen.
"A free exchange of views concerning ques
tions of mutual interest took place," the agency
added.
• Branca Purges Congressmen
RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil—President Hum
berto Castello Branco yesterday purged six
Brazilian congressmen and suspended their po
litical rights for 10 years. He also suspended
the political rights of four lesser elected of
ficials for the same period.
Two of the purged federal deputies are form
er close associates of ex-presidents Juscelino
Kubitschek and Joao Goulart, now negotiating
a political alliance against Castello Branco.
Kubitschek and Goulart, whom Castello
Branco overthrew, both live in exile. However,
sources close to the negotiations said the purge
of the congressmen had nothing to do with the

proposed opposition alliance.
It was the first time since July that the
President used his extraordinary powers to re
move any elected official from office and strip
any Brazilian of his political rights. Since
Castello Branco came to power in 1964, more
than 400 Brazilians have had their political
rights suspended.
