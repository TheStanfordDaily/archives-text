## 'Freedom Today' Analyzes Complex Catholic Dilemma 
### MIKE COUZENS 
The complexities of an ancient
institution coming to terms with
a new day are manifold and im
mense. In the Catholic Church,
the solvent for reified dogma
and binding tradition may be a
new sense of freedom.
Hans Kung has considered
this solution in Freedom Today
(Sheed & Ward, 1966), his most
recent book. Its freshness will
not be striking to anyone fa
miliar with Vatican 11. But its
clarity and forthrightness make
it welcome as a book which il
luminates what is very modern
about the Catholic church.
Kung begins and ends with
two cameo portraits of men who
express his idea of freedom.
Thomas More, a person thor
oughly secular by vocation and
inclination, was a saint. Why?
The answer lies beyond a secu
lar-sacred dichotomy, 'in the
royal freedom of a Christian
man."
John XXIII, characterized by
his "service," is the other cameo.
The body of Freedom Today
analyzes the concept in terms of
theology, church and world re
ligions. At the forefront is the
Augustinian rubric: "In neces
sary things, unity, in doubtful
things freedom, but in every
thing love."
The Church begins with a his
tory of intermittent intolerance.
The problem is to sustain it as a
dwelling place of freedom. Other
wise it can never be believable to
the outside.
Kung faces past and present
shortcomings with real honesty.
He argues that they are not the
decisive thing. The Christian
whose church attacks freedom
can only retreat "to the fortress
of his own conscience." The sec
ond Vatican Council, in magnific

cent rhetoric, is quoted to show
hope for a better day.
Freedom Of Errors
Kung advances specific propos
als in freedom of speech and ac
tion which recognize the possi
bility of error—and beyond that,
the right of a well-intentioned
person to err.
The breadth and richness of
free theology is defended next.
"One Lord, one faith, one bap
tism, (Eph. 4,5) but different
theologies."
Problem Of Other Religions
While these areas are rigor
ously and clearly argued, Kung's
treatment of freedom of reli
gions is apologetic and at times
strained. With forthright hon
esty he faces up to the problem:
Christians are a small minority.
Other religious traditions have
shown new vitality coincident
with the end of Christianity's
most militant missionary zeal.
Can it then be maintained that
outside the church there is no
salvation? Kung's answer is not
satisfactory, he is faced with a
dilemma, and it is hard to see
how he could answer.
If Christianity is the only path
to salvation, other traditions are
deluded. Ecumenism founders.
But if all paths are legitimate,
Christ's redemptive act loses all

uniqueness and the Church is
hard put to justify herself.
Straddling The Dilemma
Kung will not decide on which
horn of the dilemma he wishes
to impale himself. Instead, he
straddles the problem by saying
that all are bound for the same
city, but others take the wrong
road.
"The grace of the true God
can witness to itself even
through false gods, and can
trace the image of the true God
even through its misplaced and
disassociated features. The grace
of the true God is able to make
mere service of idols count as
concealed worship of God. .. ."
Is Christianity then simply ir
relevant? No, because it is an
absolute validity over against the
"relative validity" which gives
other religions a "relative pro
vidential right to existence."
This is both untenable and un
palatable. It seems, rather, that
the Church must choose.
In sum, Hans Kung has writ
ten a vigorous and appealing de
scription of what the Catholic
Church is becoming—and beyond
that a hopeful vision of what
may be ahead. His honesty in
facing the critical questions of
freedom deserves attention and
debate.
