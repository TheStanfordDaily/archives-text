# Campus Nursery School Doubles As Laboratory
## ...Happily Ever After 
### GREGORY BARTHA Science Writer 
That hallowed institution of
childhood, the sandbox, is no
more.
It's become a miniature
beach, at least in the Bing Nur
sery School, which adjoins the
Escondido Elementary School
on the Stanford campus.
The school which began oper
ations in 1947 at Stanford Vil
lage is operated by the Univer
sity under the auspices of the
psychology department. It
serves as the main research fa
cility for the Laboratory of Hu
man Development, a more or
less autonomous division of the
psychology department, and is
directed by Associate Professor
of Psychology Edith Dowley.
Since 1949
Professor Dowley has headed
the school since 1949 and has
directed its enrollment from an
initial seventy to two-hundred
when, in 1960, a facility was
opened in Escondido Village. Its
present enrollment totals 325
which require a full-time staff
of twelve, assisted by graduate
and undergraduate students.
The children, mainly from
families of Stanford stalT and
students and nearby residents,
spend two or three half-days
each week at Bing.
In 1963 the University learned
that the Escondido arrange
ment could only be temporary.
Recognizing the valuable re
search and teaching opportuni
ties made possible by the school,
it began seeking financial as
sistance for a new school.
Anna Bing Arnold
The main support came from
Mrs. Anna Bing Arnold of Los
Angeles and her son Dr. Peter
S. Bing, A.B. '56, of Washington
D.C., and from a large matching
grant from the National Science
Foundation.
The present structure, op
ened in January of this year, is
a product of long and careful
collaboration among an archi
tect, teachers, and research psy
chologists.
The building is divided into
an adult's wing, housing the ad
ministrative offices, a library for
parents of the children, and con
ference and staff rooms, and the
children's wing.
Three Playrooms
The children's wing has three
35 by 40 foot playrooms each of
which opens onto a covered pa
tio and a half-acre outdoor play
area. The playrooms are deco
rated in bright colors which are
felt by the teachers and re
searchers to bring out the best
responses in both staff and chil
dren.
In evidence is the typical play
equipment — doll houses, play
kitchens, puzzles, and water

color sets. Located between the
playrooms are two music rooms
with record players, rhythm in
struments, and pianos.
Especially striking is the
landscaping of the play areas,
done with the Rousseauian idea
of back to nature. The minia
ture beaches in reality are
sandy areas with boulders ar
ranged as they might he found
along some rugged shoreline.
Deciduous trees and shrubs
have been emphasized over the
familiar evergreens.
Crockett Style
And over the once flat land
hills have been built up among
which you might find such
things as a log bridge, an arbor,
and a kind of Davy Crockett
Jungle Gym.
A bird shelter has just been
finished which will house par
tridges, turkeys, and other un
usual birds.
The research facilities have
been introduced very inconspic
uously into the structure. The
research rooms all open into an
atrium through which the chil
dren pass every day on their
way to the playrooms. This is
so when a child is taken into one
of them for an experiment, the
area will seem familiar to him
One-way Mirrors
The rooms are small, usually
with space enough for two or
three children or one child and
a researcher. They are equipped
with one-way mirrors, sound
amplifying system, and tape re
corders.
Oneway mirrors are also
used in two of the playrooms
and closed-circuit T.V. is some
times employed.
Development is the unifying
element in the research at the
school. The word is used to de
note the process of physical, in

tellectual, emotional, and crea
tive growth of a human being
from infancy through adult
hood.
Several Areas
This field of study constitutes
one of the main areas in psy
chology, some of the others
being clinical, social, and indus
trial psychology.
Research has centered on par
ent-child relationships, child
rearing practices, cognitive
processes, and some clinical
problems such as modification
of fears and the imitation of
models.
