# Kung Seeks Church's Sincerity, Truthfulness
## 
### KIRK HANSON Managing Editor 
"The Modern World will move
ahead with, without, or against the
Church," said Hans Kung last night
to a crowd of over eighteen hundred
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium, Tresidder
Union, and White Memorial Plaza.
His talk on the "Church and Sin
cerity" was the first of three West
Memorial Lectures he will give this
week. The Committee on Public Exer
cises announced late last night that
the second and third lectures by Fa
ther Kung will be moved to Memorial
Church to accommodate the crowd.
The second is on "The Church and
Unity" at 4:15 this afternoon, the
third tomorrow night at 7:45.
Last night Kung told of a "passion
among contemporary men for sin
cerity that sets men free." He told
of the drive for sincerity in all areas
of life in the twentieth century: in
art, literature, cinema, and psy
chology.
"The drive for sincerity does not
stop at the doors of the Church," he
emphasized, "the painted plaster and
the trash are being cleaned out."
Things "are not so easily condemned
by the Church. Among both lay peo
ple and clergy is a new feeling for
sincerity and truthfulness."
Doomed Man
In introducing Father Kung, Rob
ert McAfee Brown told of his feeling
when he read The Council, Reform
and Reunion: "The man who wrote
that book is doomed. They will have
him in the ecclesiastical equivalent of
Siberia in no time."
But Hans Kung observed why the
Church might have taken such action.
He cited "a sweeping disregard for
truthfulness" in moral theology, the
fear to admit "anything not infallible
is fallible," and the faulty image of
the church as beseiged and endowed
with an ecclesiology of glory and per
fection.
Kung's hope for the Church was
tempered by a call for even greater
honesty and sincerity. He cited John

XXIII and John F. Kennedy as "com
pletely honest men." "But truth is
not enough. The thing that counts is
total commitment."
Church Challenged
"The Church is challenged by the
whole world. We must discard the last
vestiges of censorship, the censuring
of theological books by ecclesiastical
authorities."
Concerning Protestantism, Kung
said: "The Protestant Churches have
often carried truthfulness to ex
tremes until it becomes separated
from all truth. It leads to a destruc
tive fanaticism."
He pleaded lor Catholics to "ac
quire honesty from Protestants," and
for Protestants to "acquire responsi
bility for the Church from Catholics."
Kung further indicted the Church as
a cause of atheism: "A large part of
the world has left Christ because of
his Church. It has sought truthful
ness outside."
In answer to a question following
the regular lecture he said: "Commit
ment without an open mind would be
fanaticism. The root of commitment
has to be a love for man."
