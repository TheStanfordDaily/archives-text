Some of the more significant
work which has been done
using the nursery school aB a
laboratory have been Professor
Lois Stolz's study on the father
relationships of war-born chil
dren, Professor Robert Sears'
work on the conscience of chil
dren, and Professor Albert Ban
dura's research on the imitation
of models in aggresKion and in
overcoming fears.
Psychology professors Cola
darci, Festinger, Mischel, Carl
smith, Landauer and Ward
have also used the facility for
research.
Graduate students interested
in child development and educa
tion often do the research for
their theses and dissertations at
the school. There is a special

Two undergraduate seminars
are taught by Dr. Dowley, Psy
chology 117 and 118, which may
be taken for 3-5 units depending
on the number of hours weekly
spent working in the school
With the new pass-fail syst< .1
Dr. Dowley anticipates a con
siderable increase in the num
her taking the courses.
Dr. Dowley states that out
side of the research activities
that there is really little differ
ence between the Stanford f.<
cility and an "ordinary" nursevy
school.
Child's Welfare
The research is not permitted
to take a large portion of a
child's time, and all experi
ments are carefully planned
with the child's welfare a fore
most consideration.
A firm principle Is that any
experiment must be made a
pleasant experience for the
child. For example, Professor
Carlsmith did some work on
obedience which involved plac
ing a child in a room with toys
and not allowing him to pit*
with them. But after a short
while the child was allowed to
play happily for about ten min
utes so that any discomliturc
would be largely mollified.
The parents of the children
are fully aware of the research
going on and so far no writU n
waivers have been necessary.
With sensitivity to invasions of
privacy on the increase, how
ever, Dr. Dowley feels these
documents may soon be made
mandatory.
Stanford truly has students
studying on many different
levels, not the least of which
are those building sandcastU*
at "Bing Quad."
