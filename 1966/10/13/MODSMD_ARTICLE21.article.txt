# Laser Beam—Potential Space Camera

"You are watching the first
landing of a man on the moon
while it happens," whispered
the TV announcer to millions
across the world.
This possibility approached a
reality recently with a tech
nique developed by a team of
University researchers enabling
TV cameras to focus on events
in space using laser beams.
The process which the re
searchers have developed es
capes the problem of viewing
outer 6pace through the atmo
sphere.
The technique takes advan
tage of the "vellum effect," a
phenomenon observed in photo
graphs of the earth taken from
heights well above the atmo
sphere. Such photos are predom
inantly sharp and far more de
tailed than the aerial photos
taken at much closer range by
planes flying through the earth's
atmosphere.
The vellum effect can be dem
onstrated by holding a sheet of
artist's tracing paper above a

drawing--it fogs or blots out
the image beneath. But when
the paper is placed flat on the
drawing, the image is clearly
seen. In the same way, astro
nauts get a much clearer view
of us on earth than we get of
them.

The Stanford engineering
team proposes using the laser's
"coherent" light — one-color
(single-wavelength), non spread
ing, and far brighter than the
sun—to illuminate the satellite.
The reflected light rays would
be caught in a hologram —a film

record of the reflected light pat
terns from the satellite.
Holograms bear no visible re
semblance to the scenes they
record. They look rather like n.
fogged piece of film. But whc/
laser light is shone through a
hologram, the original scene it
recorded reappears as if by
magic.
Similarly the hologram of
satellite reflections would bear
no resemblance to the natelli'"
itself. Instead it would faith
fully record the interference
pattern of reflected laser light
rays. The distortions caused by
the atmosphere do not affect the
interference pattern.
Then, by laser illumination of
the hologram and use of a ler
to "reconstruct" or focus tin
rays properly, a clear image of
the satellite could be obtained
Though the laboratory dis
tance was short, and a piece of
wavy shower glass was used in
stead of the atmosphere, theii
"wavefront reconstruction inr
ging" technique produced as
tonishingly clear pictures.
Doctor Goodman also noted
that the discovery was under
consideration by the Navy and
the Air Force. He explained that
the Air Force was interested in
it because their present methoc.
of observing things in space
were inadequate.
