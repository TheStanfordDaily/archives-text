# Harriers Run Against Fleet-Footed USC, Cal
## 
### GREG PSALTIS 
"It will depend heavily on
team balance," were cross coun
try coach Payton Jordan's
words concerning Saturday's
three way home meet including
Stanford, USC and California.
Jordan and his fellow coach
Jerry Barland feel that the meet
will be a good one with some
outstanding runners in it. Both
USC's and California's teams
are spotted with promising
sophomores. USC will run two
and California will have three
in the race.
Since USC hasn't had a meet
yet, the coaches don't know
exactly what to expect. How
ever, on the basis of returning
runners and their past season,
USC will probably be favored.
liink On The IJnks
John Link will be its leading
runner. The nucleus of the USC
varsity squad will also include
Craig Grant, Larry Kunkle,

Chuck Schultz and John Trent
adue.
California's feature runner
will be Bob Price. Price, in the
opinion of the two Stanford
coaches, is one of the finest dis
tance runners at California in
recent history. He placed third
in last week's Sacramento Invi
tational. Backing him up will be
John Henry and Lynn Houpes.
Stanford will run Jim Letter
er, Randy Hyvonen, Brook
Thomas, Bob Kelley, Bob An
chondo, John Boeschan and
Mike Jacobs in the meet.
Cal, Stanford Tie
In the Sacramento Invitation
al, the California team finished
in a tie for second with Stan
ford right behind it. Barland
feels that the Indians are defi
nitely within distance of over
taking California Saturday.
Jordan pointed out that both
opponents had a two week head
start on Stanford in training for

the season. Nevertheless, both
coaches are optimistic, especial
ly following Stanford's perform
ances in last week's meet.
In addition to the freshman
team winning its second con
secutive team title, both the var
sity and freshman squads
showed considerable improve
ment over last year's perform
ances.
Both squads, the coaches felt,
put forth a fine team effort.
Bearing this out is the fact that
the varsity's team time was 3
minutes and 52 seconds better
than last year's varsity team
time.
Three of the varsity runners,
Letterer, Hyvonen and Thomas
all improved their individual
times over last year. Letterer's
effort of 19:45 over the 3.5 mile
course was a second better than
Stanford's best time last year.
The freshman squad also bet
tered last year's freshman's
team time by 2 minutes and 35
seconds. They scored 67 points
to easily outdistance runner-up
California's 125 points. These
same two teams will meet Sat
urday along with Santa Ana
JC.
Dual Mw't Make« It Tight
Barland feels that having the
two teams in a dual meet like
Saturday's will make the race
much tighter than the Sacra
mento score might indicate.
Greg Brock bettered last
year's top freshman time by 1.8
seconds as he finished fifth in
the race. Chuck Menz also
placed in the top ten.
Saturday's meet will be on
starts and finishes at the second
tee of the Stanford Golf Course.
This course is an unusually
good one for spectators as the
runners can be seen at four dif
ferent points in the race. The
varsity race will begin at 10 a.m.
and the freshman will start at
10:30.

runners can be seen at four dif

"It will depend heavily on
team balance," were cross coun
try coach Payton Jordan's
words concerning Saturday's
three way home meet including
Stanford, USC and California.
Jordan and his fellow coach
Jerry Barland feel that the meet
will be a good one with some
outstanding runners in it. Both
USC's and California's teams
are spotted with promising
sophomores. USC will run two
and California will have three
in the race.
Since USC hasn't had a meet
yet, the coaches don't know
exactly what to expect. How
ever, on the basis of returning
runners and their past season,
USC will probably be favored.
liink On The IJnks
John Link will be its leading
runner. The nucleus of the USC
varsity squad will also include
Craig Grant, Larry Kunkle,

Chuck Schultz and John Trent
adue.
California's feature runner
will be Bob Price. Price, in the
opinion of the two Stanford
coaches, is one of the finest dis
tance runners at California in
recent history. He placed third
in last week's Sacramento Invi
tational. Backing him up will be
John Henry and Lynn Houpes.
Stanford will run Jim Letter
er, Randy Hyvonen, Brook
Thomas, Bob Kelley, Bob An
chondo, John Boeschan and
Mike Jacobs in the meet.
Cal, Stanford Tie
In the Sacramento Invitation
al, the California team finished
in a tie for second with Stan
ford right behind it. Barland
feels that the Indians are defi
nitely within distance of over
taking California Saturday.
Jordan pointed out that both
opponents had a two week head
start on Stanford in training for

the season. Nevertheless, both
coaches are optimistic, especial
ly following Stanford's perform
ances in last week's meet.
In addition to the freshman
team winning its second con
secutive team title, both the var
sity and freshman squads
showed considerable improve
ment over last year's perform
ances.
Both squads, the coaches felt,
put forth a fine team effort.
Bearing this out is the fact that
the varsity's team time was 3
minutes and 52 seconds better
than last year's varsity team
time.
Three of the varsity runners,
Letterer, Hyvonen and Thomas
all improved their individual
times over last year. Letterer's
effort of 19:45 over the 3.5 mile
course was a second better than
Stanford's best time last year.
The freshman squad also bet
tered last year's freshman's
team time by 2 minutes and 35
seconds. They scored 67 points
to easily outdistance runner-up
California's 125 points. These
same two teams will meet Sat
urday along with Santa Ana
JC.
Dual Mw't Make« It Tight
Barland feels that having the
two teams in a dual meet like
Saturday's will make the race
much tighter than the Sacra
mento score might indicate.
Greg Brock bettered last
year's top freshman time by 1.8
seconds as he finished fifth in
the race. Chuck Menz also
placed in the top ten.
Saturday's meet will be on
starts and finishes at the second
tee of the Stanford Golf Course.
