# Athletes Achieve The Grades For 1966 Stanford Dean's List
## 
### 
Stanford athletes contributed
a significant number of names
to the 1965-66 Dean's List, re
leased last week. Members of
12 varsity squads were repre
sented on the list.
Swimming and water polo
coach Jim Gaughran once said
that his competitors achieved
better grades in season than out.
He attributed this phenomenon
to the need for increased organi
zation of time and more inten
sified study habits.
This pattern appears to hold
true for all facets of Stanford
athletic scholarship.
