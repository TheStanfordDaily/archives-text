# Committee Of Fifteen
## 
### 
The Committee of Fifteen was established
last fall as one of the peripheral results of the
Judicial Competence Bill. However the Com
mittee's performance in dealing with such issues
as liquor policy, the sponsor controversy, and
the closing of Union residence proved that its
impact upon the campus is hardly peripheral.
The Committee —composed of five students
appointed by the student body president and
confirmed by Legislature, five administrators ap
pointed by the President, and five faculty mem
bers appointed by the Executive Committee of
the Academic Council —was created as a mech
anism through which representatives of the
campus constituencies might "meet to discuss
University problems and policies with a view to
exchanging ideas and, if possible, agreeing in
principle upon recommendations to be made to
their several appointing powers."
Herein lies the peculiar status of the Commit
tee. The group's powers are patently advisory,
for the members do "not have the power to
make decision or to bind their several appoint
ing powers to make decisions." Yet the Commit
tee's recommendations, presented as consensus
opinions of fifteen highly respected members of
the community, are rarely ignored. As one fac
ulty representative observed last year, the Com
mittee has "no power but a lot of influence."
Thus it becomes increasingly difficult to draw
the line between the Committee's role as a nego
tiating body, whose effectiveness has been
proven, and its role as a purely advisory body,
specified in its founding document.
We believe that the discerning characteristic
of the Committee is not to be found in its sup
posed quasi-legislative powers, but rather in
the attitude and approach which the members
of the Committee bring to University problems.
At one of its first meetings last year, the Com
mittee drafted a statement to the effect that the
members must be free to discuss matters "with
out firm directives from their constituencies."
The caliber of the initial fifteen appointments
was a demonstration of trust among the con
stituencies and an affirmation that each ap
pointee, acting freely, could place the interest
of the University above the particular goals of
his constituency.
Yet by February Legislature dissatisfaction
with the stands of student representatives and
its desire to control their voting patterns led to
a full-scale floor debate and a recall.
Legislature's recall of three student members
stemmed principally from Legislature's mistaken
views of the role of the Committee and the
proper attitude of student representatives. Pro
ponents of tighter Legislature control, such as
Tom F'orstenzer, argued in opposition to the
Committee's declared emphasis on freedom of
action for Committee members. Forstenzer told
Legislature, "The manner in which student in
fluence is going to take effect is going to have
to be on the basis of consistent positions taken
by the Legisature and made known by its rep
resentatives (in the Committee of Fifteen)."
Much of the rapport the Committee had de
veloped in five months was lost or diminished
by the reshuffling, and more precisely by the
Legislature's desire to view the Committee as
an all-powerful super-committee.
And thus the question of the true nature of
the Committee was befogged for the remainder
of the year.
This evening Legislature will be asked to
confirm the slate of Committe of Fifteen ap
pointments put forth last week by Student Body

President David Harris. We believe that Legis
lature has a duty to clarify its perception of the
Committee and to state, for the record, whether
its representatives are to enjoy freedom of con
science in their actions or are they to be po
litical pawns subject to constant recall and the
immediate dictates of Legislature.
Harris commented recently that he had sought
intelligent, informed representatives for the
Committee who were skilled in arbitrating,
"tough enough to take the pressure which such
a committee can involve." While representation
from other constituencies reflects a balance of
interests, Harris admits that diversity according
to living groups and campus background was
not a consideration in his choices. Consequently
four of the five nominees come from last year's
Legislature, four out of five live off-campus.
Committee of Fifteen recommendations are
the result of consensus, and 10-5 block voting
rarely denotes a consensus. Legislature ought
rightly to ask if the proposed slate of nominees
reflects the student body, and whether each
nominee to the Committee is conducive to con
sensus in the best interest of the University or to
political polarization of the student delegation.
By-laws require Harris to serve on the Com
mittee or to designate a personal representative
in addition to the four other student nominees.
We believe that Harris has wisely chosen to
sit on the Committee. Harris' other appoint
ments include:
• Tom Forstenzer. A second year graduate
student in history, Forstenzer is currently act
ing speaker of Legislature. As an undergraduate
at Reed College, he was instrumental in the
formation of the Community Government, a
merger of faculty-student constituencies, during
his term as student body president. Forstenzer
was named to the Committee of Fifteen last
year in the wake of the recall. This is his sec
ond year at Stanford.
• Martin Gerry. A third-year law student, Gerry
also served on the Committee last year fol
lowing the recall. He represented the Law
School in Legislature last year and served on
the By-laws and Judicial Committees. Although
his performance in Legislature was at times
amusing, Gerry demonstrated an ability to
speak to immediate issues and to dig beneath
the surface of legislation. Gerry ran for stu
dent body president last spring on the platform
"Make student government a farce not a fiasco."
Gerry was defeated in an attempt for re-election
to Legislature last month.
• Jan Handke. Miss Handke is a member of
Legislature. Her main activities last year were
participation in the Stanford Sexual Rights Fo
rum and Friends of SNCC. She participated in
organizing the student referendum on con
traceptives. A senior, she is the only woman
on the slate.
• Charles Depres. A transfer from Reed Col
lege, Depres is now beginning his second year
at Stanford. He did not participate in student
government last year. At Reed he was elected
student body president in the middle of his
sophomore year, but did not complete his term
when he transfered to Stanford last fall.
As Harris pointed out earlier in the week,
the effctiveness of the student slate requires
that it have the support and the confidence of
the student body. We urge the Legislature to
confirm a slate of students who represent the
entire student body, who have the respect to act
freely within the Committee, and who are not
constrained to view the Committee of Fifteen
as a center of political confrontation.

confirmed by Legislature, five administrators ap
pointed by the President, and five faculty mem
bers appointed by the Executive Committee of
the Academic Council —was created as a mech
anism through which representatives of the
campus constituencies might "meet to discuss
University problems and policies with a view to
exchanging ideas and, if possible, agreeing in
principle upon recommendations to be made to
their several appointing powers."
Herein lies the peculiar status of the Commit
tee. The group's powers are patently advisory,
for the members do "not have the power to
make decision or to bind their several appoint
ing powers to make decisions." Yet the Commit
tee's recommendations, presented as consensus
opinions of fifteen highly respected members of
the community, are rarely ignored. As one fac
ulty representative observed last year, the Com
mittee has "no power but a lot of influence."
Thus it becomes increasingly difficult to draw
the line between the Committee's role as a nego
tiating body, whose effectiveness has been
proven, and its role as a purely advisory body,
specified in its founding document.
We believe that the discerning characteristic
of the Committee is not to be found in its sup
posed quasi-legislative powers, but rather in
the attitude and approach which the members
of the Committee bring to University problems.
At one of its first meetings last year, the Com
mittee drafted a statement to the effect that the
members must be free to discuss matters "with
out firm directives from their constituencies."
The caliber of the initial fifteen appointments
was a demonstration of trust among the con
stituencies and an affirmation that each ap
pointee, acting freely, could place the interest
of the University above the particular goals of
his constituency.
Yet by February Legislature dissatisfaction
with the stands of student representatives and
its desire to control their voting patterns led to
a full-scale floor debate and a recall.
Legislature's recall of three student members
stemmed principally from Legislature's mistaken
views of the role of the Committee and the
proper attitude of student representatives. Pro
ponents of tighter Legislature control, such as
Tom F'orstenzer, argued in opposition to the
Committee's declared emphasis on freedom of
action for Committee members. Forstenzer told
Legislature, "The manner in which student in
fluence is going to take effect is going to have
to be on the basis of consistent positions taken
by the Legisature and made known by its rep
resentatives (in the Committee of Fifteen)."
Much of the rapport the Committee had de
veloped in five months was lost or diminished
by the reshuffling, and more precisely by the
Legislature's desire to view the Committee as
an all-powerful super-committee.
And thus the question of the true nature of
the Committee was befogged for the remainder
of the year.
This evening Legislature will be asked to
confirm the slate of Committe of Fifteen ap
pointments put forth last week by Student Body

President David Harris. We believe that Legis
lature has a duty to clarify its perception of the
Committee and to state, for the record, whether
its representatives are to enjoy freedom of con
science in their actions or are they to be po
litical pawns subject to constant recall and the
immediate dictates of Legislature.
Harris commented recently that he had sought
intelligent, informed representatives for the
Committee who were skilled in arbitrating,
"tough enough to take the pressure which such
a committee can involve." While representation
from other constituencies reflects a balance of
interests, Harris admits that diversity according
to living groups and campus background was
not a consideration in his choices. Consequently
four of the five nominees come from last year's
Legislature, four out of five live off-campus.
Committee of Fifteen recommendations are
the result of consensus, and 10-5 block voting
rarely denotes a consensus. Legislature ought
rightly to ask if the proposed slate of nominees
reflects the student body, and whether each
nominee to the Committee is conducive to con
sensus in the best interest of the University or to
political polarization of the student delegation.
By-laws require Harris to serve on the Com
mittee or to designate a personal representative
in addition to the four other student nominees.
We believe that Harris has wisely chosen to
sit on the Committee. Harris' other appoint
ments include:
• Tom Forstenzer. A second year graduate
student in history, Forstenzer is currently act
ing speaker of Legislature. As an undergraduate
at Reed College, he was instrumental in the
formation of the Community Government, a
merger of faculty-student constituencies, during
his term as student body president. Forstenzer
was named to the Committee of Fifteen last
year in the wake of the recall. This is his sec
ond year at Stanford.
• Martin Gerry. A third-year law student, Gerry
also served on the Committee last year fol
lowing the recall. He represented the Law
School in Legislature last year and served on
the By-laws and Judicial Committees. Although
his performance in Legislature was at times
amusing, Gerry demonstrated an ability to
speak to immediate issues and to dig beneath
the surface of legislation. Gerry ran for stu
dent body president last spring on the platform
"Make student government a farce not a fiasco."
Gerry was defeated in an attempt for re-election
to Legislature last month.
• Jan Handke. Miss Handke is a member of
Legislature. Her main activities last year were
participation in the Stanford Sexual Rights Fo
rum and Friends of SNCC. She participated in
organizing the student referendum on con
traceptives. A senior, she is the only woman
on the slate.
• Charles Depres. A transfer from Reed Col
lege, Depres is now beginning his second year
at Stanford. He did not participate in student
government last year. At Reed he was elected
student body president in the middle of his
sophomore year, but did not complete his term
when he transfered to Stanford last fall.
As Harris pointed out earlier in the week,
the effctiveness of the student slate requires
that it have the support and the confidence of
the student body. We urge the Legislature to
confirm a slate of students who represent the
entire student body, who have the respect to act
freely within the Committee, and who are not
constrained to view the Committee of Fifteen
as a center of political confrontation.
The Committee of Fifteen was established
last fall as one of the peripheral results of the
Judicial Competence Bill. However the Com
mittee's performance in dealing with such issues
as liquor policy, the sponsor controversy, and
the closing of Union residence proved that its
impact upon the campus is hardly peripheral.
The Committee —composed of five students
appointed by the student body president and
confirmed by Legislature, five administrators ap
pointed by the President, and five faculty mem

the Academic Council —was created as a mech

their several appointing powers."
Herein lies the peculiar status of the Commit
tee. The group's powers are patently advisory,
for the members do "not have the power to
make decision or to bind their several appoint
ing powers to make decisions." Yet the Commit
tee's recommendations, presented as consensus
opinions of fifteen highly respected members of
the community, are rarely ignored. As one fac
ulty representative observed last year, the Com
mittee has "no power but a lot of influence."
Thus it becomes increasingly difficult to draw
the line between the Committee's role as a nego
tiating body, whose effectiveness has been
proven, and its role as a purely advisory body,
specified in its founding document.
We believe that the discerning characteristic
of the Committee is not to be found in its sup
posed quasi-legislative powers, but rather in
the attitude and approach which the members
of the Committee bring to University problems.
At one of its first meetings last year, the Com
mittee drafted a statement to the effect that the
members must be free to discuss matters "with
out firm directives from their constituencies."
The caliber of the initial fifteen appointments
was a demonstration of trust among the con
stituencies and an affirmation that each ap
pointee, acting freely, could place the interest
of the University above the particular goals of
his constituency.
Yet by February Legislature dissatisfaction
with the stands of student representatives and
its desire to control their voting patterns led to
a full-scale floor debate and a recall.
Legislature's recall of three student members
stemmed principally from Legislature's mistaken
views of the role of the Committee and the
proper attitude of student representatives. Pro
ponents of tighter Legislature control, such as
Tom F'orstenzer, argued in opposition to the
Committee's declared emphasis on freedom of
action for Committee members. Forstenzer told
Legislature, "The manner in which student in
fluence is going to take effect is going to have
to be on the basis of consistent positions taken
by the Legisature and made known by its rep
resentatives (in the Committee of Fifteen)."
Much of the rapport the Committee had de
veloped in five months was lost or diminished
by the reshuffling, and more precisely by the
Legislature's desire to view the Committee as
an all-powerful super-committee.
And thus the question of the true nature of
the Committee was befogged for the remainder
of the year.
This evening Legislature will be asked to
confirm the slate of Committe of Fifteen ap
pointments put forth last week by Student Body

President David Harris. We believe that Legis
lature has a duty to clarify its perception of the
Committee and to state, for the record, whether
its representatives are to enjoy freedom of con
science in their actions or are they to be po
litical pawns subject to constant recall and the
immediate dictates of Legislature.
Harris commented recently that he had sought
intelligent, informed representatives for the
Committee who were skilled in arbitrating,
"tough enough to take the pressure which such
a committee can involve." While representation
from other constituencies reflects a balance of
interests, Harris admits that diversity according
to living groups and campus background was
not a consideration in his choices. Consequently
four of the five nominees come from last year's
Legislature, four out of five live off-campus.
Committee of Fifteen recommendations are
the result of consensus, and 10-5 block voting
rarely denotes a consensus. Legislature ought
rightly to ask if the proposed slate of nominees
reflects the student body, and whether each
nominee to the Committee is conducive to con
sensus in the best interest of the University or to
political polarization of the student delegation.
By-laws require Harris to serve on the Com
mittee or to designate a personal representative
in addition to the four other student nominees.
We believe that Harris has wisely chosen to
sit on the Committee. Harris' other appoint
ments include:
• Tom Forstenzer. A second year graduate
student in history, Forstenzer is currently act
ing speaker of Legislature. As an undergraduate
at Reed College, he was instrumental in the
formation of the Community Government, a
merger of faculty-student constituencies, during
his term as student body president. Forstenzer
was named to the Committee of Fifteen last
year in the wake of the recall. This is his sec
ond year at Stanford.
• Martin Gerry. A third-year law student, Gerry
also served on the Committee last year fol
lowing the recall. He represented the Law
School in Legislature last year and served on
the By-laws and Judicial Committees. Although
his performance in Legislature was at times
amusing, Gerry demonstrated an ability to
speak to immediate issues and to dig beneath
the surface of legislation. Gerry ran for stu
dent body president last spring on the platform
"Make student government a farce not a fiasco."
Gerry was defeated in an attempt for re-election
to Legislature last month.
• Jan Handke. Miss Handke is a member of
Legislature. Her main activities last year were
participation in the Stanford Sexual Rights Fo
rum and Friends of SNCC. She participated in
organizing the student referendum on con
traceptives. A senior, she is the only woman
on the slate.
• Charles Depres. A transfer from Reed Col
lege, Depres is now beginning his second year
at Stanford. He did not participate in student
government last year. At Reed he was elected
student body president in the middle of his
sophomore year, but did not complete his term
when he transfered to Stanford last fall.
As Harris pointed out earlier in the week,
the effctiveness of the student slate requires
that it have the support and the confidence of
the student body. We urge the Legislature to
confirm a slate of students who represent the
entire student body, who have the respect to act
freely within the Committee, and who are not
constrained to view the Committee of Fifteen
as a center of political confrontation.
The Committee of Fifteen was established
last fall as one of the peripheral results of the
Judicial Competence Bill. However the Com
mittee's performance in dealing with such issues
as liquor policy, the sponsor controversy, and
the closing of Union residence proved that its
impact upon the campus is hardly peripheral.
The Committee —composed of five students
appointed by the student body president and
confirmed by Legislature, five administrators ap
pointed by the President, and five faculty mem
bers appointed by the Executive Committee of
the Academic Council —was created as a mech
anism through which representatives of the
campus constituencies might "meet to discuss
University problems and policies with a view to
exchanging ideas and, if possible, agreeing in
principle upon recommendations to be made to
their several appointing powers."
Herein lies the peculiar status of the Commit

the community, are rarely ignored. As one fac
ulty representative observed last year, the Com
mittee has "no power but a lot of influence."
Thus it becomes increasingly difficult to draw
the line between the Committee's role as a nego
tiating body, whose effectiveness has been
proven, and its role as a purely advisory body,
specified in its founding document.
We believe that the discerning characteristic
of the Committee is not to be found in its sup
posed quasi-legislative powers, but rather in
the attitude and approach which the members
of the Committee bring to University problems.
At one of its first meetings last year, the Com
mittee drafted a statement to the effect that the
members must be free to discuss matters "with
out firm directives from their constituencies."
The caliber of the initial fifteen appointments
was a demonstration of trust among the con
stituencies and an affirmation that each ap
pointee, acting freely, could place the interest
of the University above the particular goals of
his constituency.
Yet by February Legislature dissatisfaction
with the stands of student representatives and
its desire to control their voting patterns led to
a full-scale floor debate and a recall.
Legislature's recall of three student members
stemmed principally from Legislature's mistaken
views of the role of the Committee and the
proper attitude of student representatives. Pro
ponents of tighter Legislature control, such as
Tom F'orstenzer, argued in opposition to the
Committee's declared emphasis on freedom of
action for Committee members. Forstenzer told
Legislature, "The manner in which student in
fluence is going to take effect is going to have
to be on the basis of consistent positions taken
by the Legisature and made known by its rep
resentatives (in the Committee of Fifteen)."
Much of the rapport the Committee had de
veloped in five months was lost or diminished
by the reshuffling, and more precisely by the
Legislature's desire to view the Committee as
an all-powerful super-committee.
And thus the question of the true nature of
the Committee was befogged for the remainder
of the year.
This evening Legislature will be asked to
confirm the slate of Committe of Fifteen ap
pointments put forth last week by Student Body

President David Harris. We believe that Legis
lature has a duty to clarify its perception of the
Committee and to state, for the record, whether
its representatives are to enjoy freedom of con
science in their actions or are they to be po
litical pawns subject to constant recall and the
immediate dictates of Legislature.
Harris commented recently that he had sought
intelligent, informed representatives for the
Committee who were skilled in arbitrating,
"tough enough to take the pressure which such
a committee can involve." While representation
from other constituencies reflects a balance of
interests, Harris admits that diversity according
to living groups and campus background was
not a consideration in his choices. Consequently
four of the five nominees come from last year's
Legislature, four out of five live off-campus.
Committee of Fifteen recommendations are
the result of consensus, and 10-5 block voting
rarely denotes a consensus. Legislature ought
rightly to ask if the proposed slate of nominees
reflects the student body, and whether each
nominee to the Committee is conducive to con
sensus in the best interest of the University or to
political polarization of the student delegation.
By-laws require Harris to serve on the Com
mittee or to designate a personal representative
in addition to the four other student nominees.
We believe that Harris has wisely chosen to
sit on the Committee. Harris' other appoint
ments include:
• Tom Forstenzer. A second year graduate
student in history, Forstenzer is currently act
ing speaker of Legislature. As an undergraduate
at Reed College, he was instrumental in the
formation of the Community Government, a
merger of faculty-student constituencies, during
his term as student body president. Forstenzer
was named to the Committee of Fifteen last
year in the wake of the recall. This is his sec
ond year at Stanford.
• Martin Gerry. A third-year law student, Gerry
also served on the Committee last year fol
lowing the recall. He represented the Law
School in Legislature last year and served on
the By-laws and Judicial Committees. Although
his performance in Legislature was at times
amusing, Gerry demonstrated an ability to
speak to immediate issues and to dig beneath
the surface of legislation. Gerry ran for stu
dent body president last spring on the platform
"Make student government a farce not a fiasco."
Gerry was defeated in an attempt for re-election
to Legislature last month.
• Jan Handke. Miss Handke is a member of
Legislature. Her main activities last year were
participation in the Stanford Sexual Rights Fo
rum and Friends of SNCC. She participated in
organizing the student referendum on con
traceptives. A senior, she is the only woman
on the slate.
• Charles Depres. A transfer from Reed Col
lege, Depres is now beginning his second year
at Stanford. He did not participate in student
government last year. At Reed he was elected
student body president in the middle of his
sophomore year, but did not complete his term
when he transfered to Stanford last fall.
As Harris pointed out earlier in the week,
the effctiveness of the student slate requires
that it have the support and the confidence of
the student body. We urge the Legislature to
confirm a slate of students who represent the
entire student body, who have the respect to act
freely within the Committee, and who are not
constrained to view the Committee of Fifteen
as a center of political confrontation.
