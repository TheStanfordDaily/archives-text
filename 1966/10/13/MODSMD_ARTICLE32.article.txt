# House at Pooh Corner
## In Housing Policy Students Form Prime Constituency 
### Jan Jacobi 
Daily Columnists are not sup
posed to propagandize—especial
ly about their own endeavors.
This is, however, an excellent
opportunity for me to address a
statement to the community on
the ASSU Housing Commission.
We begin our work with a
basic assumption that in the
area of housing, we, as stu
dents, are the primary constitu
ency. We are the ones who have
had to live with, and in, the
mistakes of those who have de
termined housing policy in the
past.
We ask for a role in the deci
sion-making process in housing
in the central questions of the
continued existence of the fra
ternity system (whether or not
the institution of a draw system
would be more beneficial to the
community as a whole), the
possible establishment of a
house or college system for un
dergraduate men and/or women
(including freshmen), the possi
bility of experimenting with co
ed housing prior to the opening
of Moore-Jacks Halls (now
scheduled for September 1968),
perhaps in Stern, Wilbur, even
Florence Moore or Lagunita,
and the question of a segre
gated versus an integrated resi
dential system for freshmen.
Critical Issues
We of the Housing Commis
sion feel that the President and
the administration have not
given due consideration to these
critical issues. We are not pre
pared to wait for the presiden
tial super-committee on under
graduate education (which will
probably not begin meeting un
til late this year or early next—
and then deliberate for two
years or longer) to issue its re
port.
The central issues in housing,
especially the questions pertain
ing to freshman residences can
not be put aside for three years.
If the administration is not to
provide forceful and courageous
leadership in housing (and that

means a willingness to experi
ment both from within and out
side of the present system) then
the faculty and students must
take the initiative.
We begin our work with the
belief that the residence univer
sity is a worthwhile and attain
able idea I—but that little
thought has been given to the
different ways in which that
ideal might be achieved. There
has been no uniformity of
thought in housing at Stanford,
no Ariadne's thread weaving its
way through the years—instead
university housing resembles a
patchwork quilt (and at that a
patchwork quilt hastily slap
dashed together) of little steps
for little people.
Drifting- Ship
The Board of Trustees or
President Sterling have never
offered a statement as to where
we are going or why in housing.
We are a ship drifting listless
ly, and what is a tragic and al
most criminal act is that the
captain and his crew do not
seem to be aware of this or if
they are they seem uncon
cerned.
The time has come for a total
re-examination of housing at
Stanford.
Yet lest the picture be too
grim indeed, the meeting Mon
day at which the Associate
Dean's Advisory Committee on
Freshman Residences voted to
become the sub-committee of
the Housing Commission on
Freshman Residences augers
well for the future.
For with the vigorous leader
ship of Dr. Osborne and Dean
Napier (the thoughtful dissent
of Dr. Max Levin), and the co
operation and support of Dean
Gordon, we joined together not
as faculty, students, and admin
istrators representing different
constituencies, but as concerned
human beings, aware of serious
problems, and ready to bring
our best efforts toward their
solution.
