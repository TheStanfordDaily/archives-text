## Flash Of Insight

Editor, The Dally:
I am in complete support of
The Daily's inaccurate reporting
on the recent Stillman-Sigma
Chi love feast. A true flash of
journalistic insight to deprive
the yearning, hungry Hurlburt
girls of the notoriety they hoped
their inane acts would give
them!
Hurlburt would have been
much better off if they had kept
their Ajax-filled mouths shut;
but alas, their childish desire to
assume all credit for their
thoughtful little escapade has
again brought their immaturity
to light. The desire to openly
publicize foolishness, in fact, to
fight for recognition of such
womanly talents as sheer
raging and destructive RFing,
can only indicate an underlying
confusion in the Hurlburt men
tality as to how to impress the
Stanford community. I would

suggest to them that the next
time one of their spirited raids
goes unnoticed, or is at least at
tributed to some other party,
they accept their good fortune
and not get all puffed up about
it. Eventually, they may realize
there are better ways to estab
lish a reputation at Stanford.
But I honestly can't foresee
our wonderful Row Houses, or
fraternities, acting with such
calculation and reserve. If the
Hurlburt raid was "the best
function" the Sigma Chi's have
had all year, I recommend they
find a new Social Chairman.
But then, it is fun to handle
those girls and throw them in
the showers, isn't it? And the
nice thing is, though the girls
from Twirlbutt try to hate it,
they know they gotta' love it.
You can't put anything over on
Hurlburt.
