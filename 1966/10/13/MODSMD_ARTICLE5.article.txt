# New Committee To Re-Evaluate Overseas Campus Curriculum
## 
### 
A new committee has been ap
pointed to make recommendations
concerning academic programs at
Stanford Campuses overseas.
According to Dr. Robert Walker,

Director of the Overseas Campuses
Program, the group is a sub-commit
tee of the General Studies Committee.
Formation of an overseas subcom
mittee to consider academic ques
tions was one of the proposals in the
Martindale report written last year
by an ad hoc group of students.
To Consider Report
According to Sheldon Shaeffer, cur
rent chairman of that ad hoc com
mittee, the group appointed yester
day will begin to discuss proposals
which came out of the Martindale
report but which have not yet been
acted upon.
"I'm not sure yet what will happen
with the Martindale ad hoc commit
tee," Shaeffer commented. "We may
continue to make suggestions and rec
ommendations which the new commit
tee will take under advisement."
Shaeffer said three separate ad
visory groups concerned with over
seas campuses would then exist:
The Overseas Campuses Board,
which concerns itself with hostels,
orientation meetings and general ad
ministration;
The Martindale ad hoc committee,
formed last year at the suggestion of
the Overseas Campuses Board, which

will continue to come up with ideas
for improvements in the program;
The newly-appointed sub-committee
of the General Studies Committee,
which will consider the suggestions
of the Martindale ad hoc committee
and make recommendations on aca
demic matters to Dr. Walker.
"This group," explained Walker,
"will not be interested in militant re
appraisal of the overseas program,
but will assist me in making improve
ments in the educational program."
In the past — particularly in the
Martindale report — "educational pro
gram" has been loosely interpreted to
include field trips, housing conditions,
and relations with neighboring towns.
The sub-committee might then con
cern itself with such matters, al
though according to Shaeffer, the
group will probably avoid issues like
social regulations and finances.
Faculty Members
Five faculty members will serve on
the sub-committee. They are George
Knoles, John Loftis, David Regnery,
F. W. Strothmann and Lorrie Tarshis.
Dr. Walker will also attend meetings.
Students appointed are Bob Vestal,
president of the Overseas Campuses
Board, Sheldon Shaeffer, and Steve
Tipton, a member of Italy XI.

ommendations which the new commit
tee will take under advisement."
Shaeffer said three separate ad
visory groups concerned with over
seas campuses would then exist:
The Overseas Campuses Board,
which concerns itself with hostels,
orientation meetings and general ad
ministration;
The Martindale ad hoc committee,
formed last year at the suggestion of
the Overseas Campuses Board, which

will continue to come up with ideas
for improvements in the program;
The newly-appointed sub-committee
of the General Studies Committee,
which will consider the suggestions
of the Martindale ad hoc committee
and make recommendations on aca
demic matters to Dr. Walker.
"This group," explained Walker,
"will not be interested in militant re
appraisal of the overseas program,
but will assist me in making improve
ments in the educational program."
In the past — particularly in the
Martindale report — "educational pro
gram" has been loosely interpreted to
include field trips, housing conditions,
and relations with neighboring towns.
The sub-committee might then con
cern itself with such matters, al
though according to Shaeffer, the
group will probably avoid issues like
social regulations and finances.
Faculty Members
Five faculty members will serve on
the sub-committee. They are George
Knoles, John Loftis, David Regnery,
F. W. Strothmann and Lorrie Tarshis.
Dr. Walker will also attend meetings.
Students appointed are Bob Vestal,
president of the Overseas Campuses
Board, Sheldon Shaeffer, and Steve
Tipton, a member of Italy XI.
A new committee has been ap
pointed to make recommendations
concerning academic programs at
Stanford Campuses overseas.
According to Dr. Robert Walker,

Director of the Overseas Campuses
Program, the group is a sub-commit
tee of the General Studies Committee.
Formation of an overseas subcom
mittee to consider academic ques
tions was one of the proposals in the
Martindale report written last year
by an ad hoc group of students.
To Consider Report
According to Sheldon Shaeffer, cur
rent chairman of that ad hoc com
mittee, the group appointed yester
day will begin to discuss proposals
which came out of the Martindale
report but which have not yet been
acted upon.
"I'm not sure yet what will happen
with the Martindale ad hoc commit
tee," Shaeffer commented. "We may
continue to make suggestions and rec
ommendations which the new commit
tee will take under advisement."
