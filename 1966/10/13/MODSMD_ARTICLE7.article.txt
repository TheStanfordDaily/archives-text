# Lawyers Adopt Semester System
## 
### JIM GALLOWAY 
While most of us sweat over this
quarter's exams, Stanford's law stu
dents can watch with detachmentâ€”
they are on a semester system.
"We wanted to revise our curricu
lum, and our changes would have
been impeded if we had maintained
the old calendar," said Prof. Herbert
Packer, chairman of the Law School's
curriculum committee. "The main
goal was to shorten the first-year
courses which lasted three quarters,
and to introduce more variety and
change of pace."
When the switch occurred last au
tumn, three new courses moved into
the first-year curriculum, and no re
quired courses remained for second
year law students. First term begins
after Labor Day and instruction ends
with Christmas vacation.
Reading Period
A "reading period" in early January
is followed by exams, and classes don't
resume until January 30th. Second

term ends at the same time as Spring
Quarter.
"It's probably too early to get a gen
eral opinion on the results," said
Packer, "but I personally think there
has been an improvement." He
stressed the long break in the mid
dle of the year which gives the stu
dents time to reflect on what they've
been doing before taking the exams,
as well as time for writing seminar
papers without the pressures of class.
"The quarter system worked out all
right so long as students took courses
which lasted either all year or for
one quarter." But the Law School
wanted something in-between, with
out requiring twelve-month atten
dance.
Students Like It
David A. Gantz, a third-year law
student and president of the Stanford
Law International Society, feels that
most students like the new system.
"But you must remember that this in
cludes numerous changes in the cur
riculum over the last two years. By
itself, a semester schedule would prob
ably have changed things very little."
Ours is not the only non-conformist
law school. At Berkeley ,the jurists
were the only group which didn't
move to a quarterly claendar this
fall. "There were a variety of rea
sons," according to Dean Edward C.
Halbach Jr., "and frankly the exper
ience at the Stanford Law School and
other law schools on the quarter sys
tem influenced us to some extent.''
"The University [of Californial went
onto the quarter system largely to
provide full utilization of the facilities,
particularly during the summer. But

as far as the Law School is concerned,
acceleration through summer sessions
is meaningless because we arp on a
four-year program of study.
Intervening Sessions
"On a semester system, three years
with two intervening summer ses
sions get a man through; but on a
quarter system, three years, with two
intervening quarters, does not equal
four years. You're still a quarter
short."
Dean Halbach felt that the summer
break has educational value. "We
would prefer to have our students
work in law firms, governmental agen
cies and various kinds of state institu
tions, getting that kind of experience
during the summer to bring back
to their second and third years of
study."
How did his division manage to
hold its own against a massive policy
change? "I'd have to say that this
speaks well for the school; it is suffic
iently flexible and willing to accom
modate some individuality and experi
mentation."
No Trouble
None of the law faculty interviewed
at Stanford felt that students were
having trouble in taking courses out
side of the department. "There is no
problem at all with the students tak
ing courses in the fall or spring,"
said Prof. Packer, "although in the
winter it is possible that Law School
exams could conflict with a class meet
ing elsewhere in the University.
"Since there have been no formal re
requirements for second-year students
we have actually increased the num
ber of students taking outside

Possibilities for any major break
with the quarter system are remote,
says Registrar Harvey Hall: in a
graduate school which is fairly well
self-contained, the schedule can be
changed easily, "but it is impossible
to have lalssez faire on the matter in
undergraduate education." Change
there would have to be universal.
Opinion Survey
Last year an unofficial group of fac
ulty members conducted a survey of
opinion on the subject. Lawrence C.
Ryan, Director of the Graduate Pro
gram in Humanities, said that slightly
more than half of all faculty mem
bers polled preferred the quarter sys
tem to a two-term calendar.
Departments in Humanities and Sci
ences generally favored the semester
plan, while engineering and profes
sional schools supported the present
system.
"I personally feel that a semester
system is preferable in courses requir
ing extensive reading and preparation
of papers," said Ryan.
