# Harvard Moves Up Application Date
## 
### 
Harvard's Graduate School of
Arts and Sciences has changed
its traditional February 1 dead
line for applications to Decem
ber 1, 1966.
Prof. J. B. Elder, Dean of the
Graduate School, said the earlier
date is necessary because of an
anticipated increase in applica
tions due to the post-war "baby
bulge" now reaching graduate
school, and the recent increased
percentage of college students
who go on to graduate study.
There will be 900 places avail
able in the fall of 1967 for which
some 6,000 applications are ex

pected, an increase of 500 over
this year's figure.
Letters of recommendation
may still come in as late as
February 1. Students are urged
to send in their senior year first
term grades as soon as possible.
Dean Elder thinks that pro
spective students will not find
the early filing date a handi
cap.
"Many of the better students
now begin to think about their
graduate school applications at
the end of their college junior
year," he noted.
