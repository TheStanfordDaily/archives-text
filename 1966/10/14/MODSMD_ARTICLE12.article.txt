# Wind Ensemble Concert Set
## 
### 
The Renaissance Wind Band
presents a concert of early mu
sic at 8:30 tonight at Dinkelspiel
Auditorium.
Sponsored by the Music De
partment, the program, directed
by Associate Prof. George Houle,
will include French chansons
from the 15th and 16th cen
turies, late 16th century recorder
music, and several different set
tings of a single chanson, San
drin's "Douce Memoire."
Members of the ensemble are
Herbert Myers, Joan Myers, Lyle
Nordstrom, and Michael O'Don
ovan. Guest singers will be so
prano Marily Spmville and tenor
Stanley Buetens, who will also
play lute in the ensemble.
Performers play on copies of
the historic instruments of the
16th century, most of which are
in the Harry Lange Memorial
Collection of Musical Instru
ments. Each player changes
from one instrument to another
as did the wind band performers
of Renaissance times.
The group's repertory includes
several works edited and per
formed for the first time since
the 16th century. In addition to
performance in historically cor
rect instruments such as
shawns, recorders, violas da
gamba, and crumhorns, the
group has studied and attempts
to exemplify the practices of per
formance appropriate to the or
iginal era of the music.
