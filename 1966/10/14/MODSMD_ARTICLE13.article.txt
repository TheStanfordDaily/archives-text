# Off! Drive On
## 
### 
The girls must be serious
about living off campusâ€”but
tons supporting the cause go on
sale today in front of the Union.
Embellished with the slogan,
'OFF!" the official emblem of the
crusade will be available for a
quarter.
"We encourage people to buy
several dollars worth and then
make a profit selling them to
friends," remarks Janet Howell,
initiator of the drive to live off
campus.
