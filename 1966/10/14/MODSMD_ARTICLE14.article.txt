# Truth In 'Rush To Judgment' Will Alarm, Sway Skeptics

### STEPHANIE SHERMAN 
Rush To Judgment, Mark Lane,
(Holt, Rinehart and Winston)
$5.95.
Having little faith in the hon
esty of lawyers, particularly
criminal defense lawyers; and
having substantially more faith
in the inloRrity of the United
States government; I approach
ed Mark Lane's Rush To Judg
ment with more than the proverb
ial grain of salt.
This book, subtitled A critique
of the Warren Commission's in
quiry into the Murders of Presi
dent John F. Kennedy, Officer J.
D. Tippit and Lee Harvey Os
wald, was reported to be an ob
jective criticism of the Warren
investigation. Exactly how objec
tive—indeed how truthful—the
counsel for Oswald's defense
could be under the circumstances
was a point over which I had
grave doubts.
On the one hand, the Warren
Commission, comprised of influ
enzal, wellknown and respected
individuals, claims to have ex
amined the events of the assas
sination period fully, with the
aid of the F.B.I.—an agency fam
ous for its ability at searching
out facts. It then produced a re
port based on-fact.
Seeking The Truth
On the other hand, a New
York lawyer, of whom I know
nothing and who was the defense
attorney for Oswald, accuses the
Commission of shameful con
duct in all aspects of the investi
gation. With my already-formed
opinion as to the credibility of
this book, I began reading with
the sole intent of finding fault.
By the end of Chapter 1, how
ever, my stubborn desire to dis
credit this attack on the Com
mission had been totally de
stroyed. It is apparent in these
first few pages that Mr. Lane is
seeking not the proof of Os
ward's innocence per se, but the
truth.
Lane has done an extremely
masterful job of presenting the
evidence on both sides. Using
documented evidence presented
to the Commission, the Commis
sion's own investigation, and
evidence gathered from his own
search, Lane manages to con
vince even this very skeptical
reader of the validity of his con
cluding remarks as to the merit
of the Warren Commission:
"The Commission disregarded
these rules and principles (of
evidence), making no explana
tion and adopting no substitute.
Hearsay evidence was freely ad
mitted, while crucial eyewitness
testimony was excluded. Opin
ions were sought and solemnly
published, while important facts
were rejected, distorted or ig
nored.
"Dubious scientific tests were
said to have proved that which
no authentic test could do.
Friendly witnesses gave testi
mony without fear of criticism
or cross-examination, were led
p >'$ mmmmmmmmm m m

through their paces by lawyers
who, as the records show, helped
to prepare their testimony in ad
vance and were asked leading
questions; while those few who
challenged the Government's
case were often harassed and
transformed for the time being
into defendents. Important wit
nesses with invaluable evidence
to give were never called, and
the secrecy which prevailed at
the hearings was extended, in
respect to many important de
tails, for another 7? years."
Shock And Shame
A sense of shock and rage at
being denied an honest search
for the truth inevitably over
comes the reader to Rush To
Judgment. But worse is the
sense of shame and guilt for
the complacency with which the
obviously untrue Warren Report
has been accepted.
I began reading this book to
prove the validity of the War
ren Report. However, the blatant
dishonesty in the Commission's
investigation, the obviously dis

torted evidence, and especially
the disregard of the scientific
facts presented by the Commis
sioner's own investigators when
it differed from their prior-to-in
vestigation conclusions, shocked
me. I now realize that the report
is a decption of the American
people and a criminal attempt to
subvert the right of the people
to seek the truth.
Lane does not claim to have
any theories as to who killed
the President or why; he claims,
and proves beyond a shadow of
a doubt, that the American peo
ple have been denied the right
to search for the true facts of
November 22, 1963.
Rush To Judgment is not a
book; it is an emotional exper
ience. No American reading it
can ever again accept the War
ren Commission Report as hav
ing any semblance of truth. The
people of this country owe Lane
an unrepayable debt for giving
them this second chance at their
right to be told the truth by
their government.

Rush To Judgment is not a

Having little faith in the hon
esty of lawyers, particularly
criminal defense lawyers; and
having substantially more faith
in the inloRrity of the United
States government; I approach
ed Mark Lane's Rush To Judg
ment with more than the proverb
ial grain of salt.
This book, subtitled A critique
of the Warren Commission's in
quiry into the Murders of Presi
dent John F. Kennedy, Officer J.
D. Tippit and Lee Harvey Os
wald, was reported to be an ob
jective criticism of the Warren
investigation. Exactly how objec
tive—indeed how truthful—the
counsel for Oswald's defense
could be under the circumstances
was a point over which I had
grave doubts.
On the one hand, the Warren
Commission, comprised of influ
enzal, wellknown and respected
individuals, claims to have ex
amined the events of the assas
sination period fully, with the
aid of the F.B.I.—an agency fam
ous for its ability at searching
out facts. It then produced a re
port based on-fact.
Seeking The Truth
On the other hand, a New
York lawyer, of whom I know
nothing and who was the defense
attorney for Oswald, accuses the
Commission of shameful con
duct in all aspects of the investi
gation. With my already-formed
opinion as to the credibility of
this book, I began reading with
the sole intent of finding fault.
By the end of Chapter 1, how
ever, my stubborn desire to dis
credit this attack on the Com
mission had been totally de
stroyed. It is apparent in these
first few pages that Mr. Lane is
seeking not the proof of Os
ward's innocence per se, but the
truth.
Lane has done an extremely
masterful job of presenting the
evidence on both sides. Using
documented evidence presented
to the Commission, the Commis
sion's own investigation, and
evidence gathered from his own
search, Lane manages to con
vince even this very skeptical
reader of the validity of his con
cluding remarks as to the merit
of the Warren Commission:
"The Commission disregarded
these rules and principles (of
evidence), making no explana
tion and adopting no substitute.
Hearsay evidence was freely ad
mitted, while crucial eyewitness
testimony was excluded. Opin
ions were sought and solemnly
published, while important facts
were rejected, distorted or ig
nored.
"Dubious scientific tests were
said to have proved that which
no authentic test could do.
Friendly witnesses gave testi
mony without fear of criticism
or cross-examination, were led
p >'$ mmmmmmmmm m m

through their paces by lawyers
who, as the records show, helped
to prepare their testimony in ad
vance and were asked leading
questions; while those few who
challenged the Government's
case were often harassed and
transformed for the time being
into defendents. Important wit
nesses with invaluable evidence
to give were never called, and
the secrecy which prevailed at
the hearings was extended, in
respect to many important de
tails, for another 7? years."
Shock And Shame
A sense of shock and rage at
being denied an honest search
for the truth inevitably over
comes the reader to Rush To
Judgment. But worse is the
sense of shame and guilt for
the complacency with which the
obviously untrue Warren Report
has been accepted.
I began reading this book to
prove the validity of the War
ren Report. However, the blatant
dishonesty in the Commission's
investigation, the obviously dis

torted evidence, and especially
the disregard of the scientific
facts presented by the Commis
sioner's own investigators when
it differed from their prior-to-in
vestigation conclusions, shocked
me. I now realize that the report
is a decption of the American
people and a criminal attempt to
subvert the right of the people
to seek the truth.

ren Report. However, the blatant
dishonesty in the Commission's
investigation, the obviously dis

torted evidence, and especially
the disregard of the scientific
facts presented by the Commis
sioner's own investigators when
it differed from their prior-to-in
vestigation conclusions, shocked
me. I now realize that the report
is a decption of the American
people and a criminal attempt to
subvert the right of the people
to seek the truth.
Lane does not claim to have
any theories as to who killed
the President or why; he claims,
and proves beyond a shadow of
a doubt, that the American peo
ple have been denied the right
to search for the true facts of
November 22, 1963.
Rush To Judgment is not a
book; it is an emotional exper
ience. No American reading it
can ever again accept the War
ren Commission Report as hav
ing any semblance of truth. The
people of this country owe Lane
an unrepayable debt for giving
them this second chance at their
right to be told the truth by
their government.

(Holt, Rinehart and Winston)
$5.95.
Having little faith in the hon
esty of lawyers, particularly
criminal defense lawyers; and
having substantially more faith
in the inloRrity of the United
States government; I approach
ed Mark Lane's Rush To Judg
ment with more than the proverb
ial grain of salt.
This book, subtitled A critique
of the Warren Commission's in
quiry into the Murders of Presi
dent John F. Kennedy, Officer J.
D. Tippit and Lee Harvey Os
wald, was reported to be an ob
jective criticism of the Warren
investigation. Exactly how objec
tive—indeed how truthful—the
counsel for Oswald's defense
could be under the circumstances
was a point over which I had
grave doubts.
On the one hand, the Warren
Commission, comprised of influ
enzal, wellknown and respected
individuals, claims to have ex
amined the events of the assas
sination period fully, with the
aid of the F.B.I.—an agency fam
ous for its ability at searching
out facts. It then produced a re
port based on-fact.
Seeking The Truth
On the other hand, a New
York lawyer, of whom I know
nothing and who was the defense
attorney for Oswald, accuses the
Commission of shameful con
duct in all aspects of the investi
gation. With my already-formed
opinion as to the credibility of
this book, I began reading with
the sole intent of finding fault.
By the end of Chapter 1, how
ever, my stubborn desire to dis
credit this attack on the Com
mission had been totally de
stroyed. It is apparent in these
first few pages that Mr. Lane is
seeking not the proof of Os
ward's innocence per se, but the
truth.
Lane has done an extremely
masterful job of presenting the
evidence on both sides. Using
documented evidence presented
to the Commission, the Commis
sion's own investigation, and
evidence gathered from his own
search, Lane manages to con
vince even this very skeptical
reader of the validity of his con
cluding remarks as to the merit
of the Warren Commission:
"The Commission disregarded
these rules and principles (of
evidence), making no explana
tion and adopting no substitute.
Hearsay evidence was freely ad
mitted, while crucial eyewitness
testimony was excluded. Opin
ions were sought and solemnly
published, while important facts
were rejected, distorted or ig
nored.
"Dubious scientific tests were
said to have proved that which
no authentic test could do.
Friendly witnesses gave testi
mony without fear of criticism
or cross-examination, were led
p >'$ mmmmmmmmm m m

through their paces by lawyers
who, as the records show, helped
to prepare their testimony in ad
vance and were asked leading
questions; while those few who
challenged the Government's
case were often harassed and
transformed for the time being
into defendents. Important wit
nesses with invaluable evidence
to give were never called, and
the secrecy which prevailed at
the hearings was extended, in
respect to many important de
tails, for another 7? years."
Shock And Shame
A sense of shock and rage at
being denied an honest search
for the truth inevitably over
comes the reader to Rush To
Judgment. But worse is the
sense of shame and guilt for
the complacency with which the
obviously untrue Warren Report
has been accepted.
