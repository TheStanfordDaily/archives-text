# TMU Sponsors Panels On Exchange Programs
## 
### 
Last night's forum in Tresid
der on the role of the American
abroad was the first in a series
of preseentations on exchange
programs and work projects
which will continue through this
month under the auspices of the
Program Division of the Union
Board.
Slide presentations and discus
sions on the individual areas will
be held later in the month. The
Guanabara exchange group will
meet on October 17 at 7:30 p.m.
in the TMU small lounge while
the Keio students will meet on
October 20 in the same place and
at the same time. The Peru proj

ect group has scheduled its
meeting for October 24; the
Hong Kong-Macao group for Oc
tober 27; and the Vietnam proj
ect group for October 31. The
three project meetings will be
held in the TMU large lounge.
These discussions and presen
tations which are open to all stu
dents hope to stimulate student
interest in the exchanges and
projects and keep it alive with
further contact with participants
until the winter quarter when
applications for participants in
these projects will be accepted.
These summer programs last
anywhere from one to two and
a half months. The exchange
students will, for the most part,
be travelling and studying the
character of the people they
come in contact with. Students
working in the projects will
teach various subjects like En
glish and physical education.
