• Kosygin Blasts Red China
MOSCOW—Premier Alexei N. Kosygln
charged yesterday that Red China's obstruc
tion undoubtedly had prevented a Communist
victory in Vietnam.
Kosygin said China's refusal to cooperate
with other Communist countries in joint sup
port for Vietnamese Communists "renders a
big service" to the United States.
The Soviet Union is providing "considerable
additional assistance" for North Vietnam, he
said, adding: "Military personnel for the
armed forces (of North Vietnam) are being
trained in the Soviet Union."
Kosygin did not spell out the terms for a
Vietnamese settlement as seen from the
Kremlin. In the past these have included both
a halt to U.S. air raids on North Vietnam and
American withdrawal from South Vietnam.
Asked if the omission might indicate any
change or softening in the terms, a Soviet
source said, "No. We continue to support the
Hanoi and National Liberation Front posi
tion."
Kosygin spoke at a Soviet-Polish friendship
rally in Sverdlovsk, a West Siberian industrial
city that he is visiting with Polish Communist
leader Wladyslaw Gomulka and Premier Jozef
Cyrankiewicz.
"Had American imperialism encountered
the joint rebuff of all countries of Socialism

(Communism), of their united policy, then
doubtlessly a quick end would have been put
to its outrages in Vietnam and the aggression
would have been cut short," Kosygin said.
"China's position has become a serious ob
stacle in the struggle for this sacred cause."
In Washington Kosygin's slashing attack on
Red China was viewed as evidence that the
Soviet leadership would like to read the Chi
nese Communist entirely out of the Soviet-led
World Communist Movement.
• Party Purge In Japan
TOKYO—The Japanese Communist Party
said yesterday it has expelled one of its top
leaders from anti-party activities.
He is Ryuji Nishizawa, a 62-year-old pro-
Peking member of the Central Committee,
the highest policy making body of the Party.
The Party said the decision to expel Nishi
zawa was made at the Seventh Central Com
mittee meeting Thursday. He had earlier been
reported suspended from party membership
for two months.
Nishizawa is the highest ranking official
who was ousted in the current purge sweep
ing within the Japanese Communist Party
since it had decided to dissociate itself from
Peking's hard line and achieve independence
in international Communist movement.
Nishizawa is a son-in-law of Kyuichi To
kuda, former Secretary General of the Japa

nese Communist Party in the post-war days
who died in Peking in 1953.
Officials said at least 41 Peking-aligned
Party members had been expelled since early
September for anti-party activities.
• Romania Eyes UN Presidency
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. — Romania is
launching a campaign to win the Presidency
of the next U.N. General Assembly for its
Foreign Minister, Cornel Iu Manescu, who—
if successful —would be the first Communist
to hold the job.
Romanian sources said a letter would go
out to all U.N. delegations in the next day an
nouncing Manescu's candidacy and seeking
support, even though the 22nd session doesn't
open until September, 1967.
This appears to be the first serious bid a
Communist country has ever made to head

the Assembly. The Communist bloc has put
forward candidates several times, but usually
they did so for bargaining purposes and with
the idea of withdrawing at the appropriate
time.

• McNamara Lauds U.S. Effort
SAIGON—Defense Secretary Robert S. Mc-
Namara said Thursday "the rate of progress
has exceeded our expectations" in military
operations in Vietnam over the last year. He
suggested the swelling U.S. war effort will be
pursued along its present lines.
"I saw nothing that in any way indicates a
substantial change in the rate of operations,
the tempo of operations, the type of opera
tions in the months ahead," McNamara said
in a statement on completing a four-day tour,
his eighth visit to this war-torn country.
"I saw nothing that indicates any need for
a change in the rate of deployment of U.S.
forces in the months ahead."
Another B52 raid on Communist forces
within the old demilitarized zone between the
two Vietnams, official acknowledgement of
the loss of three more American planes else
where, and minor skirmishes aground marked
the Defense Secretary's final hours in looking
over a war that now claims the direct atten
tion of 328,000 U.S. servicemen.

• War On Anti-War Bill
WASHINGTON —A controversial Antiwar
Bill cleared the House by an overwhelming
275-64 vote today and headed for virtually cer
tain death in the Senate.
Leadens of both parties have shown little
interest in the Bill, aimed at the activities of
some outspoken opponents of U.S. policy in
Vietnam.
The measure sponsored by Rep. Joe R. Pool,
(D-Tex.), is designed to punish Americans
who solicit or send blood, money, medical sup
plies- or anything—to North Vietnam and the
Viet Cong, or who try to block the movement
if U.S. troops or military supplies. •

• McNamara Lauds U.S. Effort
SAIGON—Defense Secretary Robert S. Mc-

has exceeded our expectations" in military
operations in Vietnam over the last year. He
suggested the swelling U.S. war effort will be
pursued along its present lines.
"I saw nothing that in any way indicates a
substantial change in the rate of operations,
the tempo of operations, the type of opera
tions in the months ahead," McNamara said
in a statement on completing a four-day tour,
his eighth visit to this war-torn country.
"I saw nothing that indicates any need for
a change in the rate of deployment of U.S.
forces in the months ahead."
Another B52 raid on Communist forces
within the old demilitarized zone between the
two Vietnams, official acknowledgement of
the loss of three more American planes else
where, and minor skirmishes aground marked
the Defense Secretary's final hours in looking
over a war that now claims the direct atten
tion of 328,000 U.S. servicemen.

• Kosygin Blasts Red China
MOSCOW—Premier Alexei N. Kosygln
charged yesterday that Red China's obstruc
tion undoubtedly had prevented a Communist
victory in Vietnam.
Kosygin said China's refusal to cooperate
with other Communist countries in joint sup
port for Vietnamese Communists "renders a
big service" to the United States.
The Soviet Union is providing "considerable
additional assistance" for North Vietnam, he
said, adding: "Military personnel for the
armed forces (of North Vietnam) are being
trained in the Soviet Union."
Kosygin did not spell out the terms for a
Vietnamese settlement as seen from the
Kremlin. In the past these have included both
a halt to U.S. air raids on North Vietnam and
American withdrawal from South Vietnam.
Asked if the omission might indicate any
change or softening in the terms, a Soviet
source said, "No. We continue to support the
Hanoi and National Liberation Front posi
tion."
Kosygin spoke at a Soviet-Polish friendship
rally in Sverdlovsk, a West Siberian industrial
city that he is visiting with Polish Communist
leader Wladyslaw Gomulka and Premier Jozef
Cyrankiewicz.
"Had American imperialism encountered
the joint rebuff of all countries of Socialism

(Communism), of their united policy, then
doubtlessly a quick end would have been put
to its outrages in Vietnam and the aggression
would have been cut short," Kosygin said.
"China's position has become a serious ob
stacle in the struggle for this sacred cause."
In Washington Kosygin's slashing attack on
Red China was viewed as evidence that the
Soviet leadership would like to read the Chi

• Party Purge In Japan
TOKYO—The Japanese Communist Party
said yesterday it has expelled one of its top
leaders from anti-party activities.
He is Ryuji Nishizawa, a 62-year-old pro-

The Party said the decision to expel Nishi
zawa was made at the Seventh Central Com
mittee meeting Thursday. He had earlier been
reported suspended from party membership
for two months.
Nishizawa is the highest ranking official
who was ousted in the current purge sweep
ing within the Japanese Communist Party
since it had decided to dissociate itself from
Peking's hard line and achieve independence
in international Communist movement.
Nishizawa is a son-in-law of Kyuichi To
kuda, former Secretary General of the Japa

nese Communist Party in the post-war days
who died in Peking in 1953.
Officials said at least 41 Peking-aligned
Party members had been expelled since early
September for anti-party activities.

• Party Purge In Japan
TOKYO—The Japanese Communist Party
said yesterday it has expelled one of its top
leaders from anti-party activities.
He is Ryuji Nishizawa, a 62-year-old pro-
Peking member of the Central Committee,
the highest policy making body of the Party.
The Party said the decision to expel Nishi
zawa was made at the Seventh Central Com
mittee meeting Thursday. He had earlier been
reported suspended from party membership
for two months.
Nishizawa is the highest ranking official
who was ousted in the current purge sweep
ing within the Japanese Communist Party
since it had decided to dissociate itself from
Peking's hard line and achieve independence
in international Communist movement.
Nishizawa is a son-in-law of Kyuichi To
kuda, former Secretary General of the Japa

nese Communist Party in the post-war days
who died in Peking in 1953.
Officials said at least 41 Peking-aligned
Party members had been expelled since early
September for anti-party activities.
• Romania Eyes UN Presidency
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. — Romania is
launching a campaign to win the Presidency
of the next U.N. General Assembly for its
Foreign Minister, Cornel Iu Manescu, who—
if successful —would be the first Communist

Romanian sources said a letter would go
out to all U.N. delegations in the next day an
nouncing Manescu's candidacy and seeking
support, even though the 22nd session doesn't
open until September, 1967.
This appears to be the first serious bid a
Communist country has ever made to head

the Assembly. The Communist bloc has put
forward candidates several times, but usually
they did so for bargaining purposes and with
the idea of withdrawing at the appropriate
time.

pursued along its present lines.
"I saw nothing that in any way indicates a

"I saw nothing that indicates any need for
a change in the rate of deployment of U.S.

Another B52 raid on Communist forces

the Defense Secretary's final hours in looking
