# Kung Describes Christian Unity; 'Church And Catholicity' Tonight
## 
### KIRK HANSON 
Managing Editor
"The effect of conflicting rivalry is
destruction. Disunity is responsible
for the wide-spread failure of Chris
tianity," said Hans Kung yesterday
afternoon to a crowd nearly filling
Memorial Church.
Father Kung will deliver the final
Raymond Fred West Lecture this
evening at 7:45 in Memorial Church
on "The Church and Catholicity." He
will also meet with the Palo Alto
Ministerial Association for lunch.
Yesterday Kung described the unity
sought by the Church as "a profound,
spiritual unity that is one and the
same God that gathers all to be one
people."
"The unity of the Church presup
poses the multiplicity of churches.
Their basic structures differ funda
mentally and no one has the right
to take this from them. The same
answer is not right for all places at
all times."
Eucharist Essential
"As long as the churches recognize
one another as legitimate, part of
one and the same Church, and cele
brate the Eucharist together, there
can be no objection to diversity."
Dean B. Davie Napier introduced
Father Kung, whom he called "a

prophet in the Church and to the
Church." Napier also observed: "The
prophet does not run away from the
religious institution."
Kung's view of great diversity in
the Church was grounded in New
Testament views of a "People of
God," "Body of Christ," and "temple
of the Holy Spirit," and also in de
scriptions of the local churches
throughout early Christianity.
Praises Council
He praised the Second Vatican Coun
cil for its clarification of the Catholic
attitude to other Christians, citing
references to "separated brethren"
and the recognition of other Christian
groups as "ecclesie"—churches. "Now
the Catholic Church does not identify
Itself entirely with the Church of
Christ."
Father Kung said no one today is
responsible for the division, but that
all are responsible for perpetuating
it."The first step in healing the divi
sion is the admission of guilt and the
asking for forgiveness. Out of com
mon confession of guilt comes the
reality of the task before us."
Five principles have to be the basis
for unity, according to Father Kung:
"the common ecclesial reality that in
Christ we are already united," prayer
that God's will and not man's be done,

work for unity starting in our own
churches, the rediscovery of truth
and not its sacrifice, and the accep
tance of the whole of the Gospel of
Jesus Christ as the ultimate standard.
Press Conference
In a press conference yesterday
morning, Kung praised the possibility
of married deacons in the Church and
the greater occurence of dispensa
tions from celibracy for priests who
give up their ministry. "Now the
question of post-conciliar time is the
possible combination of ministry and
marriage," he said.
He called for "a responsible birth
control according to the conscience of
the parents, avoiding the extremes."
On mixed marriages he said, "The
Church must recognize the validity of
these marriages." He also advocated a
common Christian baptism for the
children of such marriages, with the
education of the children left to "the
conscience of the parents."
On the retirement of bishops, he
said the rejection of Cardinal Spell
man's resignation would make it more
difficult for Pope Paul to accept those
of other bishops. However he said
the bishops must offer their resigna
tions, that it is "now a question of
the obedience of bishops, who for so
long have required the obedience of
others."

Eucharist Essential
"As long as the churches recognize
one another as legitimate, part of
one and the same Church, and cele
brate the Eucharist together, there
can be no objection to diversity."
Dean B. Davie Napier introduced
Father Kung, whom he called "a

prophet in the Church and to the
Church." Napier also observed: "The
prophet does not run away from the
religious institution."
Kung's view of great diversity in
the Church was grounded in New
Testament views of a "People of
God," "Body of Christ," and "temple
of the Holy Spirit," and also in de
scriptions of the local churches
throughout early Christianity.
Praises Council
He praised the Second Vatican Coun
cil for its clarification of the Catholic
attitude to other Christians, citing
references to "separated brethren"
and the recognition of other Christian
groups as "ecclesie"—churches. "Now
the Catholic Church does not identify
Itself entirely with the Church of
Christ."
Father Kung said no one today is
responsible for the division, but that
all are responsible for perpetuating
it."The first step in healing the divi
sion is the admission of guilt and the
asking for forgiveness. Out of com
mon confession of guilt comes the
reality of the task before us."
Five principles have to be the basis
for unity, according to Father Kung:
"the common ecclesial reality that in
Christ we are already united," prayer
that God's will and not man's be done,

work for unity starting in our own
churches, the rediscovery of truth
and not its sacrifice, and the accep
tance of the whole of the Gospel of
Jesus Christ as the ultimate standard.
Press Conference
In a press conference yesterday
morning, Kung praised the possibility
of married deacons in the Church and
the greater occurence of dispensa
tions from celibracy for priests who
give up their ministry. "Now the
question of post-conciliar time is the
possible combination of ministry and
marriage," he said.
He called for "a responsible birth
control according to the conscience of
the parents, avoiding the extremes."
On mixed marriages he said, "The
Church must recognize the validity of
these marriages." He also advocated a
common Christian baptism for the
children of such marriages, with the
education of the children left to "the
conscience of the parents."
On the retirement of bishops, he
said the rejection of Cardinal Spell
man's resignation would make it more
difficult for Pope Paul to accept those
of other bishops. However he said
the bishops must offer their resigna
tions, that it is "now a question of
the obedience of bishops, who for so
long have required the obedience of
others."
Managing Editor
"The effect of conflicting rivalry is
destruction. Disunity is responsible
for the wide-spread failure of Chris
tianity," said Hans Kung yesterday
afternoon to a crowd nearly filling
Memorial Church.
Father Kung will deliver the final
Raymond Fred West Lecture this
evening at 7:45 in Memorial Church
on "The Church and Catholicity." He
will also meet with the Palo Alto
Ministerial Association for lunch.
Yesterday Kung described the unity
sought by the Church as "a profound,
spiritual unity that is one and the
same God that gathers all to be one
people."
"The unity of the Church presup
poses the multiplicity of churches.
Their basic structures differ funda
mentally and no one has the right
to take this from them. The same
answer is not right for all places at
all times."
