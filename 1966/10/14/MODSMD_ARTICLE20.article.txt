# Mr. Vos To Pilot In New Drama Year
## 
### SUE BAKER 
Like many theatre goers, I
suppose, I had imagined the
stage director to be a kind of
minor diety, sitting apart in the
lofty isolation of an empty audi
torium and moving his actons
like puppets in a threepenny
opera.
Mr. Vos strays no farther
from his actors than their own
shadows and, I noted, the actors
seemed to find keeping pace
with this kinetic other shadow
both exhilerating and exhaust
ing. In and out he moved, cease
lessly energetic, blocking intri
cate stage movement on-stage
and, without pausing an in
stance, rushing off stage to

work out problems with the
complex turn-table and then
to the recording room—setting
cues and combinations of music
and sound effects.
Born in the Netherlands, Vos
has studied in Paris, England
and Ireland as well as at the
Academy of Dramatic Art in
Amsterdam, and he has worked
in France, Italy, Greece and
Russia. From 1956 to 1965, he
was artistic director of the
Nieuwe Komedie at The Hague
and professor at the Academy
in Amsterdam. He has received
numerous awards in Holland
for his productions, which have
ranged from plays by classical
dramatists to experimental and
contemporary Dutch works.
He is in the U.S. with his
family on a Fulbright grant—
his wife is the noted Dutch
authoress, Inez van Dulleman.
Last year, after his season at
Stanford which included the
production of "Prometheus

Bound", he taught at the Carne
gie Institute in Pittsburg, and
he is now directing the first two
productions of the Stanford
Repertory Theater 1966-67 sea
son, "Anthony and Cleopatra,"
"Gnadiges Fraulein" and "Out
at Sea".
Mr. Vos strays no further
articulate in his discussion of
directing and drama. Here
turned to Stanford this year be
cause of the opportunities for
experimentation and research
which a repertory theater of
fers, as opposed to commercial
theater. "Here we can go back
to the roots of why we have
theater — to real theater."
(Thanks to the immensely stim
ulating personality of Bob Lo
per, we are free to search for
new ways and methods of pre
senting plays.) He objects to
slavish catering to audience de
mands as New York produc
tions often do. "Audiences are
like children—they always want
sweets." His goal in his produc
tions is to shock the audience—
to shake them from an easy,
surface existence to real insight
and responsibility for their
lives.
A medical student before
studying drama, Vos sees the
functions of a doctor and a di
rector as being very similar.
"Both, in a way, cure people.
The cure in theater is by shock
ing." Much as a doctor thinks
first of saving a life and then
of receiving his fee, the direc
tor should think first of the
ideals and functions of his art
before thinking about making
money and pleasing the audi
ence.
Vos feels that the greatest di
recting challenge is that of mak
ing a play valid and meaningful
in real life. He dislikes authors
who haven't roots in life, and
appreciates playwrights such
as Arthur Miller, who are con
cerned with finding out who
they are. "Art must be engaged
in life—art for sake of beauty
is nonsense."
This makes the direction of
Shakespearean plays, such as
"Anthony and Cleopatra," espe
cially difficult, as interpretations
have been clouded by mislead
ing editors. The audiences and
world events have changed
since the Elizabethan period,
and Shakespeare can't be exact
ly the same for us. The problem
lies in finding links between
what he says and our contempo
rary times. In this sense, Mr.
Vos doesn't believe a strict play
wright's viewpoint; for him
there are as many interpreta
tions of a play as there are peo
ple who read the play, direct it,
or see it.
Busy Schedule
Mr. Vos keeps a busv schedule
divided between teaching and
directing. His enthusiasm and
enjoyment of his work is re
flected in the admiration and re
spect which his students and
co-workers have for him. His
goal is to teach students to
teach themselves—to learn ot to
accept what "we" say but to
think for themselves. In this
respect, he feels that American
schools are heading in the right
direction. "I don't believe in one
truth; students must have the
opportunity to experience and
develop their own thoughts and
minds—our wisdom is very rela
tive."
