# More Wrong Than Right In 'Wrong Box'
## 
### CURTISS KECK 
In a painfully unfunny fizzle,
Director Bryan Forbes steers a
chaotic plot through a stagnant
scenario in hopes, it would seem,
of somehow arriving at destina
tion Comedyland. That Peter Sel
lers, known to jostle the sides
of even the most moribund, ap>
pears on the screen in only two
short scenes is a tribute to his
agent's discerning eye for un
discerning slapstick.
"The Wrong Box" opens with
a flashback to twenty or so small
boys attentively listening to the
explanation of a game in which
they are all to take part. The
name of the game: tontine. The
way it's played: live life to its
longest extension. The winner:
sole surviving member of the
tontine. First and only prize:
225,000 pounds sterling.
Sixty-five years after the ton
tine was formed, only two of
the original twenty are living:
brothers who although are next
door neighbors have not spoken
a word to one another in over
forty years.
Connive To Stay Alive
One of the brothers (Ralph
Richardson) is interested only in
spewing his encyclopedic knowl
edge to any and all listeners. His
intellectual wanderings are as
well-intentioned as his listeners
are bored. Richardon's two neph
ews (Peter Cooke and Dudley
Moore) connive to keep their
scholarly uncle alive until he
wins the tontine and the quarter
of a million pounds sterling.
The other brother (John Mills)
is determined to win the tontine
in order to save his grandson
(Michael Caine) from the rav
ages of indebtedness. While

Michael Caine is falling in love
with the girl next door, and co
incidentally the lovely and
amply nubile ward of his learned
great uncle, John Mills scurries
about trying to skewer, blud
geon, and poison his brother out
of the tontine prize.
This is all background mater
ial.
The plot becomes complicated
when a fugitive murderer, the
Burnbury Strangler, encounters
the scholarly Ralph Richardson
on a train and steals his mack
intosh and scarf only to be killed
in a train wreck. The two neph
ews, mistaking the body of the
disguished Strangler as that of
their uncle, plot to delay the
official notice of the death until
their uncle's brother kicks off
leaving them with the tontine
fortune. The two scoundrels ap
proach Dr. Prat (Petter Sellers)
for a falsified death certificate.
Meanwhile their uncle, very
much alive and loquacious as
ever, roams the countryside.
Cadaver In a Box
The two nephews put the ca
daver in a box—the wrong box,
hence the movie's title (clever!)
—and end up with a statute in
stead of a dead uncle. Unrequited
in their treacheries to win the
tontine, the nephews pilfer the
loot and, viola, the chase is on.
The plot ends consistent to its
nature. The curtains close amid
mas confusion — and re-con
fusion, as the screenwritesr evi
dently decided to take a swipe
at the British detective force and
introduced a couple of policemen
here and there to add last minute
fuel to the smoking shambles.
"The Wrong Box" is an ex
ercise in unsophisticated, over

used slapstick that is counter
feited after the worst scenes in
other British exports: "What's
New Pussycat" and"The Pink
Panther." All-cast free-for-all
grappling matches are undoubt
edly a ready emotional catharsis
for walled-up frustrations, but
why put them on film? Also the
scene with half a dozen cars at
an intersection, criss-crossing,
back and forth and back and
forth ad naseum was not funny
in "Pink Panther," ridiculous in
"Pussycat," and undeniably ab
surd in "The Wrong Box."
Superb Portrayal
Ralph Richardson was superb
in his protrayal of the learned
old scholar who drowns every
proximinous ear with his flood
of facts. Richard's calm and
staid manner on stage, con
trasted to the paranoiac plot
line, gives some dimension to the
chaos around him. Unfortunate
ly this dimension bursts in his
absense.
The English comedy team of
Peter Cooke and Dudley Moore,
who played Richardson's sedi
tious young nephews, were fun
niest in the beginning while
guarding their uncle's well-being.
Their performance tails off con
siderably as they try to purloin
the tontine.
Playing the scraggly, pussified
(his office is amok with cats),
old sot of a medical man, Peter
Sellers substantiates his claim
to fame as a very funny man.
Although he appears on the
screen less than five minutes,
and for that he is given the
limest light on the marquee (the
Congressional fair advertising
bill should take its first toll on
the advertising for this film),

Sellers gives an excellent per
formance as a bumbling old doc
tor making his dollar-a-day by
falsifying death certificates and
performing abortions, or as
Cooke and Moore would embar
assingly have it: "that, that
... .thing."
Unfortunately Dull
John Barry composed an in
teresting score, one which will
undoubtedly reach the LP charts

shortly. The settings were dull—
unaffected assuredly, but still,
alas, dull.
"The Wrong Box" begins in
sedate chabers with the ex
pectation of a game. It ends In
the suitably irreverent setting of
a graveyard—a stop-over where
Director Bryan Forbes and his
slapstick machine Anally peter
out, a stop-over still a long rjdte
to destination Comedyland.

tontine, the nephews pilfer the
loot and, viola, the chase is on.
The plot ends consistent to its
nature. The curtains close amid
mas confusion — and re-con
fusion, as the screenwritesr evi
dently decided to take a swipe
at the British detective force and
introduced a couple of policemen
here and there to add last minute
fuel to the smoking shambles.
"The Wrong Box" is an ex
ercise in unsophisticated, over

used slapstick that is counter
feited after the worst scenes in
other British exports: "What's
New Pussycat" and"The Pink
Panther." All-cast free-for-all
grappling matches are undoubt
edly a ready emotional catharsis
for walled-up frustrations, but
why put them on film? Also the
scene with half a dozen cars at
an intersection, criss-crossing,
back and forth and back and
forth ad naseum was not funny
in "Pink Panther," ridiculous in
"Pussycat," and undeniably ab
surd in "The Wrong Box."
Superb Portrayal
Ralph Richardson was superb
in his protrayal of the learned
old scholar who drowns every
proximinous ear with his flood
of facts. Richard's calm and
staid manner on stage, con
trasted to the paranoiac plot
line, gives some dimension to the
chaos around him. Unfortunate
ly this dimension bursts in his
absense.
The English comedy team of
Peter Cooke and Dudley Moore,
who played Richardson's sedi
tious young nephews, were fun
niest in the beginning while
guarding their uncle's well-being.
Their performance tails off con
siderably as they try to purloin
the tontine.
Playing the scraggly, pussified
(his office is amok with cats),
old sot of a medical man, Peter
Sellers substantiates his claim
to fame as a very funny man.
Although he appears on the
screen less than five minutes,
and for that he is given the
limest light on the marquee (the
Congressional fair advertising
bill should take its first toll on
the advertising for this film),

Sellers gives an excellent per
formance as a bumbling old doc
tor making his dollar-a-day by
falsifying death certificates and
performing abortions, or as
Cooke and Moore would embar
assingly have it: "that, that
... .thing."
Unfortunately Dull
John Barry composed an in
teresting score, one which will
undoubtedly reach the LP charts

shortly. The settings were dull—
unaffected assuredly, but still,
alas, dull.
"The Wrong Box" begins in
sedate chabers with the ex
pectation of a game. It ends In
the suitably irreverent setting of
a graveyard—a stop-over where
Director Bryan Forbes and his
slapstick machine Anally peter
out, a stop-over still a long rjdte
to destination Comedyland.
In a painfully unfunny fizzle,
Director Bryan Forbes steers a
chaotic plot through a stagnant
scenario in hopes, it would seem,
of somehow arriving at destina
tion Comedyland. That Peter Sel
lers, known to jostle the sides
of even the most moribund, ap>
pears on the screen in only two
short scenes is a tribute to his
agent's discerning eye for un
discerning slapstick.
"The Wrong Box" opens with
a flashback to twenty or so small
boys attentively listening to the
explanation of a game in which
they are all to take part. The
name of the game: tontine. The
way it's played: live life to its
longest extension. The winner:
sole surviving member of the
tontine. First and only prize:
225,000 pounds sterling.
Sixty-five years after the ton
tine was formed, only two of
the original twenty are living:
brothers who although are next
door neighbors have not spoken
a word to one another in over
forty years.
Connive To Stay Alive
One of the brothers (Ralph
Richardson) is interested only in
spewing his encyclopedic knowl
edge to any and all listeners. His
intellectual wanderings are as
well-intentioned as his listeners
are bored. Richardon's two neph
ews (Peter Cooke and Dudley
Moore) connive to keep their
scholarly uncle alive until he
wins the tontine and the quarter
of a million pounds sterling.
The other brother (John Mills)
is determined to win the tontine
in order to save his grandson
(Michael Caine) from the rav
ages of indebtedness. While

Michael Caine is falling in love
with the girl next door, and co
incidentally the lovely and
amply nubile ward of his learned
great uncle, John Mills scurries
about trying to skewer, blud
geon, and poison his brother out
of the tontine prize.
This is all background mater
ial.
The plot becomes complicated
when a fugitive murderer, the
Burnbury Strangler, encounters
the scholarly Ralph Richardson
on a train and steals his mack
intosh and scarf only to be killed
in a train wreck. The two neph
ews, mistaking the body of the
disguished Strangler as that of
their uncle, plot to delay the
official notice of the death until
their uncle's brother kicks off
leaving them with the tontine
fortune. The two scoundrels ap
proach Dr. Prat (Petter Sellers)
for a falsified death certificate.
Meanwhile their uncle, very
much alive and loquacious as
ever, roams the countryside.
Cadaver In a Box
The two nephews put the ca
daver in a box—the wrong box,
hence the movie's title (clever!)
—and end up with a statute in
stead of a dead uncle. Unrequited
in their treacheries to win the
tontine, the nephews pilfer the
loot and, viola, the chase is on.
The plot ends consistent to its
nature. The curtains close amid
mas confusion — and re-con

"The Wrong Box" opens with
a flashback to twenty or so small
boys attentively listening to the
explanation of a game in which
they are all to take part. The
name of the game: tontine. The
way it's played: live life to its
longest extension. The winner:
sole surviving member of the
tontine. First and only prize:
225,000 pounds sterling.
Sixty-five years after the ton
tine was formed, only two of
the original twenty are living:
brothers who although are next
door neighbors have not spoken
a word to one another in over
forty years.
Connive To Stay Alive
One of the brothers (Ralph
Richardson) is interested only in
spewing his encyclopedic knowl
edge to any and all listeners. His
intellectual wanderings are as
well-intentioned as his listeners
are bored. Richardon's two neph
ews (Peter Cooke and Dudley
Moore) connive to keep their
scholarly uncle alive until he
wins the tontine and the quarter
of a million pounds sterling.
The other brother (John Mills)
is determined to win the tontine
in order to save his grandson
(Michael Caine) from the rav
ages of indebtedness. While

Michael Caine is falling in love
with the girl next door, and co
incidentally the lovely and
amply nubile ward of his learned
great uncle, John Mills scurries
about trying to skewer, blud
geon, and poison his brother out
of the tontine prize.
This is all background mater
ial.
The plot becomes complicated
when a fugitive murderer, the
Burnbury Strangler, encounters
the scholarly Ralph Richardson
on a train and steals his mack
intosh and scarf only to be killed
in a train wreck. The two neph
ews, mistaking the body of the
disguished Strangler as that of
their uncle, plot to delay the
official notice of the death until
their uncle's brother kicks off
leaving them with the tontine
fortune. The two scoundrels ap
proach Dr. Prat (Petter Sellers)
for a falsified death certificate.
Meanwhile their uncle, very
much alive and loquacious as
ever, roams the countryside.
Cadaver In a Box
The two nephews put the ca
daver in a box—the wrong box,
hence the movie's title (clever!)
—and end up with a statute in
stead of a dead uncle. Unrequited
in their treacheries to win the
tontine, the nephews pilfer the
loot and, viola, the chase is on.
The plot ends consistent to its
nature. The curtains close amid
mas confusion — and re-con
fusion, as the screenwritesr evi
dently decided to take a swipe
at the British detective force and
introduced a couple of policemen
here and there to add last minute
fuel to the smoking shambles.
"The Wrong Box" is an ex
ercise in unsophisticated, over

used slapstick that is counter
feited after the worst scenes in
other British exports: "What's
New Pussycat" and"The Pink
Panther." All-cast free-for-all
grappling matches are undoubt
edly a ready emotional catharsis
for walled-up frustrations, but
why put them on film? Also the
scene with half a dozen cars at
an intersection, criss-crossing,
back and forth and back and
forth ad naseum was not funny
in "Pink Panther," ridiculous in
"Pussycat," and undeniably ab
surd in "The Wrong Box."
Superb Portrayal
Ralph Richardson was superb
in his protrayal of the learned
old scholar who drowns every
proximinous ear with his flood
of facts. Richard's calm and
staid manner on stage, con
trasted to the paranoiac plot
line, gives some dimension to the
chaos around him. Unfortunate
ly this dimension bursts in his
absense.
The English comedy team of
Peter Cooke and Dudley Moore,
who played Richardson's sedi
tious young nephews, were fun
niest in the beginning while
guarding their uncle's well-being.
Their performance tails off con
siderably as they try to purloin
the tontine.
Playing the scraggly, pussified
(his office is amok with cats),
old sot of a medical man, Peter
Sellers substantiates his claim
to fame as a very funny man.
Although he appears on the
screen less than five minutes,
and for that he is given the
limest light on the marquee (the
Congressional fair advertising
bill should take its first toll on
the advertising for this film),

Sellers gives an excellent per
formance as a bumbling old doc
tor making his dollar-a-day by
falsifying death certificates and
performing abortions, or as
Cooke and Moore would embar
assingly have it: "that, that
... .thing."
Unfortunately Dull
John Barry composed an in
teresting score, one which will
undoubtedly reach the LP charts

shortly. The settings were dull—
unaffected assuredly, but still,
alas, dull.
"The Wrong Box" begins in
sedate chabers with the ex
pectation of a game. It ends In
the suitably irreverent setting of
a graveyard—a stop-over where
Director Bryan Forbes and his
slapstick machine Anally peter
out, a stop-over still a long rjdte
