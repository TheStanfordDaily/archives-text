The Stockholm Marionette
Theatre of Fantasy comes di
rect from Sweden to premiere
its U.S. tour at San Francisco's
Veterans' Auditorium October
19 through 23. This precedes the
group's Broadway engagement
at the Billy Rose Theatre in
New York City October 26

Described by American pup
peteer Bill Baird as "One of the
most potent theatres to burst
on the puppet world," the cele
brated troupe will present two
productions: the Brecht-Weill
'Three Penny Opera" evenings
at 8:30 on Wednesday the 19th,
Thursday the 20th and Saturday

"Wizard of Oz" on Saturday the
22nd at 11:00 a.m., 1:00 p.m.,

23rd at 1:00 p.m., 3:00 p.m. and
5:00 p.m.
Michael Meschke, founder-di
rector of the ensemble which
has won international recogni
tion for Sweden, believes that
the puppet with the point of
view is the answer to the thea
tre of the space age.
