# A 						LA COLE PORTER
## Light And Frothy: But Is It Can-Can 
### BRUCE MERRY 
Cole Porter: Can-Can (Circle
Star Theatre, San Carlos.)
This show, for which your re
viewer was not given a program,
is introduced by a metallic voice
from the roof. The voice stated
that Mr. Bob Wright and Miss
Patrice Munsel were starring.
You were advised not to move
out of your seats if the lights
were switched off and not to
smoke at all.
We are in Gay Paree in the
early nineties. Mr. Burrow's
novel is given a musical setting
and a topical swing. The theme
is of struggling artists, strug
gling to make the Can-Can so
cially respectable. A judge is
drawn into the night-life of
Montmartre and apparently
loses his job. In the trial-scene
at the end he gets his job back,
gets his girl out of trouble for
launching the Can-Can, and then
sings an unsolicited encore after
a thundering finale. Miss Munsel
sang this encore of "I Love Paris
in the Springtime" with him, and
then we went home to bed.
Examining this slightly out
dated musical more closely, you

felt a number of defects and sev
eral absurdities. But the bur
lesque good humor was never
left in doubt, and the comic epi
sodes were vintage pantomime.
Singing Not Up To Par
In support of the first scenes
of the show, one can say very
little: they tended to bore, and
often there were whole pas
sages that went by without a
laugh or a snigger. The lyrics
are quite catchy; the melodies
have a certain haunting beauty.
But one can not say much more
for the singing itself: this is not
opera; it was not even as well
sung as operetta. But one is en
titled to expect that a soprano
should have a higher register.
Miss Munsel had not, on Wednes
day night.
Some over-painted trollops
shout in the opening number:
"We're maidens typical of
France." I did not agree. (There
is a certain imperative that one
would like to address to the
American male: Do not believe
that to be French is to be flirta
tious and vulgar. "Side-walk
licentiousness"—as the song put
it—is as much in evidence in the
darker sections of Palo Alto as
at Montmartre. Even in 1893 you
may be sure that Parisian life
was sober and tasteful.)
The plot plodded on: based on
the "naughty dance," the action
exploits partial female nudity
and frilly knickers to the full. "I
would like to see the Can-Can"—
says the young judge, portrayed
by Mr. Wright with a white wig
—"I enjoy folk-dancing." Miss
Munsel eggs him into sin: "What
kind of a Frenchman are you?
You're a prude. Have you got a
touch of English blood?" The
audience was at last finding its
feet, and this got applause.
A Seductive Derriere
Next Miss Munsel sang her
aria "When Love Comes In" with
jolly zest. She shook her derriere
against Mr. Wright's rather sug
gestively during this song, and
their duet was bright and tune
ful.

"My first judge"—sighed Miss
Munsel; then the lights were
dimmed and the Voice announc
ed, with pride, a dancing en
semble. Amid piercing screams
and Stygian darkness, they
poured down the gangways onto
the stage, which, at the Circle
Star, is the center of a rotunda,
like the gravelled pit of a Circus.
This, then, was the famous Can-
Can; it was not. I felt it was the
Con-Con.
Boris, done by Mr. Marvin
Kaplan, was excellent as the pen
urious sculptor in a garret. He
tramped around with the dejec
tion of a sacked milkman. His
studio scene in the first Act is
quite the funniest in the show.
A fat model comes in; she wants
to know what to do: "Close your
mouth and take off your
clothes." The complacent model
asks; "How do you want me to
stand?" Boris: "Silently."
Throughout this scene the wit
sparkled. Artist, on his 'Cubo-
Pointilism': "It's a technique I
developed completely on my own
... I use the wooden end of
the brush." He was a consider
able clown as well as a brilliant
coward in the farce of the Sec
ond Act duelling scene.
'Please Remain Seated'
Soon a ballet-sequence depicted
the Garden of Eden. I would
advise anybody to see this: a
snake looking like Prometheus
Unbound waves a fern over
Eve's nose. The next thing he
does is to pick an apple and give
it to Eve. Miss Lontere, who
doubled up fluently as Eve, Clau
dine, and Nameless Murdered in
a cafe slow mime sequence still
in store ,then does a fetishistic
dance under the influence of
Prometheus' apple. This leads
you back to the Can-Can and
dramatic continuity is restored.
Miss Lontere then threw her
apple off stage at the snake, who
was somewhere in the audience.
He missed it. No wonder the
compere told one to remain
seated if the lights went out.
Act II closes with Miss Munsel

establishing before an all-male
jury that "Obscenity is in the
eye of the beholder." Dressed
like saloon girls the ensemble
stormed the arena again, and, to
gether with the heroine, gave
us their closing number—a nice
travesty of Offenbach, Lone
Ranger and The Shuffle.
This is a lively and witty
show. The clowning of Mr. Kap
lan vies with the sinewy sex
appeal of Miss Lontere for first
place. Its appeal is light and
frothy. "Art is a care-free way
of making a living." No, it is not,
and perhaps that is a reason why
Mr. Porter's script fails. Plus the
fact that what this show really
lacks is talent.

for the singing itself: this is not
opera; it was not even as well
sung as operetta. But one is en
titled to expect that a soprano
should have a higher register.
Miss Munsel had not, on Wednes
day night.
Some over-painted trollops
shout in the opening number:
"We're maidens typical of
France." I did not agree. (There
is a certain imperative that one
would like to address to the
American male: Do not believe
that to be French is to be flirta
tious and vulgar. "Side-walk
licentiousness"—as the song put
it—is as much in evidence in the
darker sections of Palo Alto as
at Montmartre. Even in 1893 you
may be sure that Parisian life
was sober and tasteful.)
The plot plodded on: based on
the "naughty dance," the action
exploits partial female nudity
and frilly knickers to the full. "I
would like to see the Can-Can"—
says the young judge, portrayed
by Mr. Wright with a white wig
—"I enjoy folk-dancing." Miss
Munsel eggs him into sin: "What
kind of a Frenchman are you?
You're a prude. Have you got a
touch of English blood?" The
audience was at last finding its
feet, and this got applause.
A Seductive Derriere
Next Miss Munsel sang her
aria "When Love Comes In" with
jolly zest. She shook her derriere
against Mr. Wright's rather sug
gestively during this song, and
their duet was bright and tune
ful.

"My first judge"—sighed Miss
Munsel; then the lights were
dimmed and the Voice announc
ed, with pride, a dancing en
semble. Amid piercing screams
and Stygian darkness, they
poured down the gangways onto
the stage, which, at the Circle
Star, is the center of a rotunda,
like the gravelled pit of a Circus.
This, then, was the famous Can-
Can; it was not. I felt it was the
Con-Con.
Boris, done by Mr. Marvin
Kaplan, was excellent as the pen
urious sculptor in a garret. He
tramped around with the dejec
tion of a sacked milkman. His
studio scene in the first Act is
quite the funniest in the show.
A fat model comes in; she wants
to know what to do: "Close your
mouth and take off your
clothes." The complacent model
asks; "How do you want me to
stand?" Boris: "Silently."
Throughout this scene the wit
sparkled. Artist, on his 'Cubo-
Pointilism': "It's a technique I
developed completely on my own
... I use the wooden end of
the brush." He was a consider
able clown as well as a brilliant
coward in the farce of the Sec
ond Act duelling scene.
'Please Remain Seated'
Soon a ballet-sequence depicted
the Garden of Eden. I would
advise anybody to see this: a
snake looking like Prometheus
Unbound waves a fern over
Eve's nose. The next thing he
does is to pick an apple and give
it to Eve. Miss Lontere, who
doubled up fluently as Eve, Clau
dine, and Nameless Murdered in
a cafe slow mime sequence still
in store ,then does a fetishistic
dance under the influence of
Prometheus' apple. This leads
you back to the Can-Can and
dramatic continuity is restored.
Miss Lontere then threw her
apple off stage at the snake, who
was somewhere in the audience.
He missed it. No wonder the
compere told one to remain
seated if the lights went out.
Act II closes with Miss Munsel

establishing before an all-male
jury that "Obscenity is in the
eye of the beholder." Dressed
like saloon girls the ensemble
stormed the arena again, and, to
gether with the heroine, gave
us their closing number—a nice
travesty of Offenbach, Lone
Ranger and The Shuffle.
This is a lively and witty
show. The clowning of Mr. Kap
lan vies with the sinewy sex
appeal of Miss Lontere for first
place. Its appeal is light and
frothy. "Art is a care-free way
of making a living." No, it is not,
and perhaps that is a reason why
Mr. Porter's script fails. Plus the
fact that what this show really
lacks is talent.
Cole Porter: Can-Can (Circle
Star Theatre, San Carlos.)
This show, for which your re
viewer was not given a program,
is introduced by a metallic voice
from the roof. The voice stated
that Mr. Bob Wright and Miss
Patrice Munsel were starring.
You were advised not to move
out of your seats if the lights
were switched off and not to
smoke at all.
We are in Gay Paree in the
early nineties. Mr. Burrow's
novel is given a musical setting
and a topical swing. The theme
is of struggling artists, strug
gling to make the Can-Can so
cially respectable. A judge is
drawn into the night-life of
Montmartre and apparently
loses his job. In the trial-scene
at the end he gets his job back,
gets his girl out of trouble for
launching the Can-Can, and then
sings an unsolicited encore after
a thundering finale. Miss Munsel
sang this encore of "I Love Paris
in the Springtime" with him, and
then we went home to bed.
Examining this slightly out
dated musical more closely, you

felt a number of defects and sev
eral absurdities. But the bur
lesque good humor was never
left in doubt, and the comic epi
sodes were vintage pantomime.

In support of the first scenes

ed, with pride, a dancing en
semble. Amid piercing screams
and Stygian darkness, they
poured down the gangways onto
the stage, which, at the Circle
Star, is the center of a rotunda,
like the gravelled pit of a Circus.
This, then, was the famous Can-
Can; it was not. I felt it was the
Con-Con.
Boris, done by Mr. Marvin
Kaplan, was excellent as the pen
urious sculptor in a garret. He
tramped around with the dejec
tion of a sacked milkman. His
studio scene in the first Act is
quite the funniest in the show.
A fat model comes in; she wants
to know what to do: "Close your
mouth and take off your
clothes." The complacent model
asks; "How do you want me to
stand?" Boris: "Silently."
Throughout this scene the wit
sparkled. Artist, on his 'Cubo-
Pointilism': "It's a technique I
developed completely on my own
... I use the wooden end of
the brush." He was a consider
able clown as well as a brilliant
coward in the farce of the Sec
ond Act duelling scene.
'Please Remain Seated'
Soon a ballet-sequence depicted
the Garden of Eden. I would
advise anybody to see this: a
snake looking like Prometheus
Unbound waves a fern over
Eve's nose. The next thing he
does is to pick an apple and give
it to Eve. Miss Lontere, who
doubled up fluently as Eve, Clau
dine, and Nameless Murdered in
a cafe slow mime sequence still
in store ,then does a fetishistic
dance under the influence of
Prometheus' apple. This leads
you back to the Can-Can and
dramatic continuity is restored.
Miss Lontere then threw her
apple off stage at the snake, who
was somewhere in the audience.
He missed it. No wonder the
compere told one to remain
seated if the lights went out.
Act II closes with Miss Munsel

establishing before an all-male
jury that "Obscenity is in the
eye of the beholder." Dressed
like saloon girls the ensemble
stormed the arena again, and, to
gether with the heroine, gave
us their closing number—a nice
travesty of Offenbach, Lone
Ranger and The Shuffle.
This is a lively and witty
show. The clowning of Mr. Kap
lan vies with the sinewy sex
appeal of Miss Lontere for first
place. Its appeal is light and
frothy. "Art is a care-free way
of making a living." No, it is not,
and perhaps that is a reason why
Mr. Porter's script fails. Plus the
fact that what this show really
lacks is talent.
Cole Porter: Can-Can (Circle
Star Theatre, San Carlos.)
This show, for which your re
viewer was not given a program,
is introduced by a metallic voice
from the roof. The voice stated
that Mr. Bob Wright and Miss
Patrice Munsel were starring.
You were advised not to move
out of your seats if the lights
were switched off and not to
smoke at all.
We are in Gay Paree in the
early nineties. Mr. Burrow's
novel is given a musical setting
and a topical swing. The theme
is of struggling artists, strug
gling to make the Can-Can so
cially respectable. A judge is
drawn into the night-life of
Montmartre and apparently
loses his job. In the trial-scene
at the end he gets his job back,
gets his girl out of trouble for
launching the Can-Can, and then
sings an unsolicited encore after
a thundering finale. Miss Munsel
sang this encore of "I Love Paris
in the Springtime" with him, and
then we went home to bed.
Examining this slightly out
dated musical more closely, you

felt a number of defects and sev
eral absurdities. But the bur
lesque good humor was never
left in doubt, and the comic epi
sodes were vintage pantomime.
Singing Not Up To Par
In support of the first scenes
of the show, one can say very
little: they tended to bore, and
often there were whole pas
sages that went by without a
laugh or a snigger. The lyrics
are quite catchy; the melodies
have a certain haunting beauty.
But one can not say much more
for the singing itself: this is not
opera; it was not even as well
sung as operetta. But one is en
titled to expect that a soprano
should have a higher register.
Miss Munsel had not, on Wednes
day night.
Some over-painted trollops
shout in the opening number:
"We're maidens typical of
France." I did not agree. (There
is a certain imperative that one
would like to address to the
American male: Do not believe
that to be French is to be flirta
tious and vulgar. "Side-walk
licentiousness"—as the song put
it—is as much in evidence in the
darker sections of Palo Alto as
at Montmartre. Even in 1893 you
may be sure that Parisian life
was sober and tasteful.)
The plot plodded on: based on
the "naughty dance," the action
exploits partial female nudity
and frilly knickers to the full. "I
would like to see the Can-Can"—
says the young judge, portrayed
by Mr. Wright with a white wig
—"I enjoy folk-dancing." Miss
Munsel eggs him into sin: "What
kind of a Frenchman are you?
You're a prude. Have you got a
touch of English blood?" The
audience was at last finding its
feet, and this got applause.
A Seductive Derriere
Next Miss Munsel sang her
aria "When Love Comes In" with
jolly zest. She shook her derriere
against Mr. Wright's rather sug
gestively during this song, and
their duet was bright and tune
ful.

"My first judge"—sighed Miss
Munsel; then the lights were
dimmed and the Voice announc
ed, with pride, a dancing en
semble. Amid piercing screams
and Stygian darkness, they
poured down the gangways onto

you back to the Can-Can and
dramatic continuity is restored.
Miss Lontere then threw her
apple off stage at the snake, who
was somewhere in the audience.
He missed it. No wonder the
compere told one to remain
seated if the lights went out.
Act II closes with Miss Munsel

establishing before an all-male
jury that "Obscenity is in the
eye of the beholder." Dressed
like saloon girls the ensemble
stormed the arena again, and, to
gether with the heroine, gave
us their closing number—a nice
travesty of Offenbach, Lone
Ranger and The Shuffle.
This is a lively and witty
show. The clowning of Mr. Kap
lan vies with the sinewy sex
appeal of Miss Lontere for first
place. Its appeal is light and
frothy. "Art is a care-free way
of making a living." No, it is not,
and perhaps that is a reason why
Mr. Porter's script fails. Plus the
fact that what this show really
lacks is talent.
