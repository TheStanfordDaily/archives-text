# Poloists Gun For Owls, Southern Cal
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER Sports Editor 
The Stanford water polo team,
after losing two painful one
goal decisions last week, will
be back at full strength this
weekend for an away game at
Foothill today and a high-pres
sure match against Southern
Cal Saturday at 11:00 a.m. in
the Encina Pool.
The Indians still have a good
chance to take the national
championship, despite 9-8 and
10-9 losses to San Jose and Cal
last week. The Cards have a
much harder road to follow
now, however. Foothill and es
pecially USC are definite ob
stacles before the Tribe.
Sheerer Returns
Gary Sheerer will be back in
the water against USC after a
foot injury that kept him out
for two weeks. Sheerer, All-
American and AAU Most Out
standing player, scored 8 goals
against the Trojans in one
game last season.

Foothill has always been a
thorn in Indian hides. Stanford
beat the Owls in the final game
of the Nor Cal Open Tourna
ment to take undisputed hold of
the nation's second ranking last
season.
Foothill has been hurt by
graduation, losing a sizeable
chunk of its first string. (Stan
ford's John Parker played for
Foothill last season.)
Southern Cal should present
the Indian's biggest problems
for the weekend. Roy Saari re
turns as Southern Cal's peren
nial AU-American. Saari, the
Trojan's high scorer for more
years than most people like to
think, will be SC's biggest scor
ing threat.
Saari-Willeford Machine
Dean Willeford, who with
Saari has probably accounted
for 80% of USC's goals over
the last three years, will play
for his last time in Stanford's
pool.
Bill Johnson, a junior trans

fer and JC Ail-American, gives
the Trojans a three-way attack
that will keep Stanford goalie
Mike Sorem on the tips of hu|
toes.
Stanford, on the other hand,
does not rely on any two or
three players. The Indian scor
ing so far has been evenly dis
tributed among the whole start
ing lineup. This übiquitous goal
gathering potential puts an ojjf
ponent's defense under consider
able strain.
Chief Scalpers
Mark Parmely, Bill Meyer,
Gary Sheerer, John Parker,
Pete Ready, Luis Nicolao, and
Greg Buckingham all rate
among the Tribe's top scoresi
so far.
The Papoose poloists, taking
three losses last weekend but
improving from experience,
face the Foothill JV's Friday af
ternoon. Following the varsity
game Saturday morning, thg

think, will be SC's biggest scor
ing threat.
Saari-Willeford Machine
Dean Willeford, who with
Saari has probably accounted
for 80% of USC's goals over
the last three years, will play
for his last time in Stanford's
pool.
Bill Johnson, a junior trans

fer and JC Ail-American, gives
the Trojans a three-way attack
that will keep Stanford goalie
Mike Sorem on the tips of hu|
toes.
Stanford, on the other hand,
does not rely on any two or
three players. The Indian scor
ing so far has been evenly dis
tributed among the whole start
ing lineup. This übiquitous goal
gathering potential puts an ojjf
ponent's defense under consider
able strain.
Chief Scalpers
Mark Parmely, Bill Meyer,
Gary Sheerer, John Parker,
Pete Ready, Luis Nicolao, and
Greg Buckingham all rate
among the Tribe's top scoresi
so far.

after losing two painful one
goal decisions last week, will
be back at full strength this
weekend for an away game at
Foothill today and a high-pres
sure match against Southern
Cal Saturday at 11:00 a.m. in
the Encina Pool.
The Indians still have a good
chance to take the national
championship, despite 9-8 and
10-9 losses to San Jose and Cal
last week. The Cards have a
much harder road to follow
now, however. Foothill and es
pecially USC are definite ob
stacles before the Tribe.
Sheerer Returns
Gary Sheerer will be back in
the water against USC after a
foot injury that kept him out
for two weeks. Sheerer, All-
American and AAU Most Out
standing player, scored 8 goals
against the Trojans in one
game last season.

Foothill has always been a
thorn in Indian hides. Stanford
beat the Owls in the final game
of the Nor Cal Open Tourna
ment to take undisputed hold of
the nation's second ranking last
season.
Foothill has been hurt by
graduation, losing a sizeable
chunk of its first string. (Stan
ford's John Parker played for
Foothill last season.)
Southern Cal should present
the Indian's biggest problems
for the weekend. Roy Saari re
turns as Southern Cal's peren
