# Spartans Squeak By Booters; Cards Face Pacific Saturday
## 
### BILL GRAHAM 
Stanford's varsity soccer team
lost a squeaker to San Jose
State, 4-3, Wednesday.
The Card's offense could not
get started until almost half way
through the third period, by
which time the Spartans had a
solid 3-0 lead.
San Jose tallied twice in the
first period and once with nine
minutes gone in the third before
Roger Goodan booted one in for
the Indians. Co-captain John Cox
followed up Goodan's score with
one late in the third period.
The Spartans came back, how
ever, scoring what turned out to
be the game-winning goal, early

in the fourth quarter. Geoff
Gray scored the Indians final
goal on a contested play. State's
goalie caught the ball, but the
referee ruled that the ball was
inside the goal.
Cards Threaten
The Cards threatened repeat
edly in the closing minutes of
the game, but were unable to
find the goal. Coach Fred Priddle
praised the team saying, "Every
one played well." He was also
pleased with the team's ball
handling.
The Cards have been plagued
by injuries all season. At one
point both first string fullbacks
were injured and the team has
had three goalies injured. Gun
ther Brandt, a converted right
wing, manned the goal for the
San Jose game, and he had an
injured leg and wasn't able to
jump for high shots. Had his
leg been well, two of San Jose's
shots, which were soft but high
would not have gone in.
The Cards have a .500 won
lost percentage to date, with a
2-2-1 record. The team will try
to boost their win record against

the University of the Pacific, Sat
urday, away, at 4:00.
Tough Tigers #
Coach Priddle expects a tough
game and looks for good pass
ing and good individual play
from the Tigers. The University
of the Pacific had a branch en
tirely for foreign students, Co
vell College, and it is from here
that most of their team come#
Brandt, who will be manning
the goal again, has almost re
covered from his leg injury, so
the defense should be stronger
for the game.

Tough Tigers #
Coach Priddle expects a tough
game and looks for good pass
ing and good individual play
from the Tigers. The University
of the Pacific had a branch en
tirely for foreign students, Co
vell College, and it is from here
that most of their team come#
Brandt, who will be manning
the goal again, has almost re
covered from his leg injury, so
the defense should be stronger
for the game.

Stanford's varsity soccer team
lost a squeaker to San Jose
State, 4-3, Wednesday.
The Card's offense could not
get started until almost half way
through the third period, by
which time the Spartans had a
solid 3-0 lead.
San Jose tallied twice in the
first period and once with nine
minutes gone in the third before
Roger Goodan booted one in for
the Indians. Co-captain John Cox
followed up Goodan's score with
one late in the third period.
The Spartans came back, how
ever, scoring what turned out to
be the game-winning goal, early

in the fourth quarter. Geoff
Gray scored the Indians final
goal on a contested play. State's
goalie caught the ball, but the
referee ruled that the ball was
inside the goal.
Cards Threaten
The Cards threatened repeat
edly in the closing minutes of
the game, but were unable to
find the goal. Coach Fred Priddle
praised the team saying, "Every
one played well." He was also
pleased with the team's ball
handling.
The Cards have been plagued
by injuries all season. At one
point both first string fullbacks
were injured and the team has
had three goalies injured. Gun
ther Brandt, a converted right
wing, manned the goal for the
San Jose game, and he had an
injured leg and wasn't able to
jump for high shots. Had his
leg been well, two of San Jose's
shots, which were soft but high
would not have gone in.
