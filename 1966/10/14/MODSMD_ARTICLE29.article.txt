## Cards Face Fifth-Ranked Trojans 
### JOE HERNANDEZ 
The Trojan herd has been
making ominous thundering
sounds of late and brings to
Stanford this weekend the prom
ise of retaining their position at
the top of the giddy heights of
footballdom.

The glory absent since the
days of Howard Jones has been
reinstilled by Coach John Mc-
Kay.
Indian aspirations on the oth
er hand have been unfulfilled
after four mediocre games.
Stanford's record is 2-2 while
USC's is 4-0. However, if Stan
ford should defeat the Trojan*
and the Bruins and a few lesser
teams, then more than one
alumnus would rejoin the Buck
Club.
Wins low Doubtful Starter
use will bring some fast
hard-hitting backs and some un
heralded but tough linemen. If
there is anything going against
USC it is that regular quarter
back Troy Winslow was injured
in last week's Washington game
and is a doubtful participant
Junior Toby Page took over foi
Winslow in the second quarter
and guided the Trojans to 10
points to overcome the same
Washington team which de
molished Ohio State the week
before.
Whichever one starts, the at
tack will be the same. Both
Page and Winslow throw short
to middle distance passes off of
the roll out, both like to run
around end following their
blockers well, and neither is
very prone to throwing the ball
into anyone's hands but their
own receivers.
One Trojan on the spot is

halfback Don McCall. He has
the unenviable job of taking
over for Mike Garrett. McCall
is not as flashy as Garrett but
he has done a credible job. He
has gained 337 yards and scored
three touchdowns this season.
Fullback Alike Hull is the block

go but he is surprisingly fast
and has to be watched.
Stanford's backfield duo of
Dave Lewis and Jack Root has
ing back and small as fullbacks
gained 477 yards and are at
worst an equal match with Mc-
Call and Hull.

In the line USC switched last
year's sophomore of the year,
Ron Yary, to offensive tackle.
Yary plus the usual flock of
J.C. all-Americans has given the
Trojans an excellent forward
wall.
At end Ron Drake has been

the top USC receiver. He has
caught 26 passes including eight
in last week's game. Defensive
halfback Nate Shaw says that
Drake is "impossible to cover
one on one." Then there fe al
ways Rod Sherman. Extremely
fast, Sherman is one of the best
receivers on the coast. Both last
year and this year he is a can
didate for ail-American honors.
Bob Blunt, Stanford's flanker,
will be ready to play after miss
ing the Oregon game due to in
juries. Blunt is an under 10
second man in the hundred and
quite often gets open for the
long pass.
The defense is the best part
of the Trojans. No one has run

on the interior line anchored by
Ray May and Gary Magner. The
secondary led by Shaw has been
equally stingy. Shaw picked off
three Washington passes in the
fourth quarter to help the Tro
jans to victory
Coach John Ralston of Stan
ford has echoed the sentiments
of his playere when he said that
"this one means more to us
than the Big Game."


Monte Mohrman, who plays
right defensive tackle for the
Indians, was elected co-captaln
for the upcoming Southern Cal
game. Mohrman, although light
for his position at 210 pounds,
has been a standout because of
his good speed and agility.
Mohrman is a senior.


Marty Brill, a Junior, has been
elected co-captain for Saturday's
game. Brill led the team
In tackles from his right line-backer
spot in last week's game.
He saw only 56 minutes of action
last year, but in this brief
time accounted for 32 tackles.
