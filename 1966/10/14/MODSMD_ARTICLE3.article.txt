# CRYSTAL-GAZERS:
## GOP Desperate In '68 
### KIRK HANEN 
Associate Editor
Grand Old Party presidential aspi
rants had better hope for that reces
sion most of the nation's business eco
nomists are expecting by 1972.
Or, for that matter, any catastrophe.
And soon.
This was the consensus of Drs.
Bailey, Hofstadter, and Horn as they
discussed the current prospects of the
Republican Party before 250-odd spec
tators in Donner Lounge last night.
Right Challenger
First speaker on the agenda, Dr.
Richard Hofstadter, Stern's Ouest-in-
Residence from Columbia University,
said he thought that the Democrats
could be derailed on their way to a
third term in the White House only if
the Republicans could produce a fav
orable man encountering a favorable
moment -much as with Eisenhower in
1952.
But, as he hastened to add, "there
isn't a single important member of
the GOP who has taken me into his
confidence."
"If the people feel the war is not
on its way to settlement by the Spring
of 1968." he prophesied, the Republi
cans "will have the type of disaster
they have been seeking."

Polit i c a 1 independent Professor
Thomas A. Bailey of the history de
partment warned Republicans to keep
their eyes on the '66 campaigns around
the nation—"this will be a foretoken
of what's going to happen."
Nixon?
Bailey picked Dick Nixon as the
most likely Republican nominee at
this juncture, but was quick to add:
"The odor of loss clings to him—
he's a loser."
"Be of good cheer, though," he con
soled, "Ron Reagan's coming along
and we've made presidents of people
with less experience than him."
Constitution specialist Professor
Robert Horn of the political science
department, also an independent, saw
hope for the Republicans in historical
precedent:
"The Democrats seem to have had
the misfortune of being in office (Wil
son, Roosevelt, Truman, Johnson)
when the nation has been at war."
"This is a point the Republicans
will not lose sight of."
All three agreed that even with a
catastrophe, the Republicans would
have to find the "right" man.
And, as Hofstadter cogently re
minded the audience, "An Eisenhower
doesn't grow on every bush."

"The odor of loss clings to him—
he's a loser."
"Be of good cheer, though," he con
soled, "Ron Reagan's coming along
and we've made presidents of people
with less experience than him."
Constitution specialist Professor
Robert Horn of the political science
department, also an independent, saw
hope for the Republicans in historical
precedent:
"The Democrats seem to have had
the misfortune of being in office (Wil
son, Roosevelt, Truman, Johnson)
when the nation has been at war."
"This is a point the Republicans
will not lose sight of."
All three agreed that even with a
catastrophe, the Republicans would
have to find the "right" man.
And, as Hofstadter cogently re
minded the audience, "An Eisenhower
doesn't grow on every bush."

Grand Old Party presidential aspi
rants had better hope for that reces
sion most of the nation's business eco
nomists are expecting by 1972.
Or, for that matter, any catastrophe.
And soon.
This was the consensus of Drs.
Bailey, Hofstadter, and Horn as they
discussed the current prospects of the
Republican Party before 250-odd spec
tators in Donner Lounge last night.
Right Challenger
First speaker on the agenda, Dr.
Richard Hofstadter, Stern's Ouest-in-
Residence from Columbia University,
said he thought that the Democrats
could be derailed on their way to a
third term in the White House only if
the Republicans could produce a fav
orable man encountering a favorable
moment -much as with Eisenhower in
1952.
But, as he hastened to add, "there
isn't a single important member of
the GOP who has taken me into his
confidence."
"If the people feel the war is not
on its way to settlement by the Spring
of 1968." he prophesied, the Republi
cans "will have the type of disaster
they have been seeking."

Polit i c a 1 independent Professor
Thomas A. Bailey of the history de
partment warned Republicans to keep
their eyes on the '66 campaigns around
the nation—"this will be a foretoken
of what's going to happen."
Nixon?
Bailey picked Dick Nixon as the
most likely Republican nominee at
this juncture, but was quick to add:
