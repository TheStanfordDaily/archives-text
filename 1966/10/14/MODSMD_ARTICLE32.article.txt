# Papooses Plan Ambush For SC
## 
### NICK SELBY 
Stanford football fans will see
at least two debuts Saturday
when the University of South
ern California comes north to
Stanford Stadium. Besides view
ing the new freshman squad,
the spectators will see a new
lapoose coach, Russ Hampton.
Hampton is cautiously opti
mistic about the encounter.
"Our boys are ready and have

a good attitude, but SC report
edly has its best freshman team
in years."
51 To Suit Up
Fifty-one freshmen will suit up
for the papooses, while only 32
freshmen will come with SC
Coach Hampton has fashioned
three teams which will play
both ways except for certain
specialists. Only half of the 51
will see heavy duty.

Hampton said that he felt
that this year's squad was
slightly inferior to last year's
team, which placed eight start
ers on the present varsity. But
Hampton claimed the only im
portant difference was that last
year's squad had more depth.
Oliver to Start at Q.B.
At quarterback for the junior
tribe eleven will be Dick Oliver,
a highly rated prospect from
Texas. He replaces Ron Fugi*
kawa, who has a
thumb. Backing up Olivet will
be Nick DeLurgio.
SC's counterpart to Oliver is
the strongpoint of the Trobabe
offense. He is Mike Holmgren, a
210 pounder from the Bay area.
Holmgren, who starred in the
Shrine game last year, was one
of the most sought-after high
school boys in the state.
Hampton is leery of the pass
ing threat from Holmgren, but
looks for Mike Carrigan, Dick
Oliver, and Howard Williams to

throttle the air attack.
Counting' on Graves
On offense, Hampton is count
ing on Tackle Jody Graves and
mammoth center Ken Carpenter
(6'6", 245) to open the neces
sary holes for runners Brian
Porter and Don Parish, who
both run the 40 yd. dash in 4.8
seconds with full uniform.
Graves and Carpenter, along
with end Bob Reinhard and
linebacker Pat Preston, were
standouts in the 14-0 victory
over the junior varsity and the
redshirts last Saturday.
Weight should not be a factor
in this game. The Stanford of
fensive line averages six pounds
heavier than the Trobabe block
ers, but the SC backs hold a 15
pound edge over their Stanford
counterparts.
More than likely, the game
will be decided by mistakes, al
ways present in initial contests.
Fumbles, interceptions, or pen
alties could be decisive factors.

Stanford football fans will see
at least two debuts Saturday
when the University of South
ern California comes north to
Stanford Stadium. Besides view
ing the new freshman squad,
the spectators will see a new
lapoose coach, Russ Hampton.
Hampton is cautiously opti
mistic about the encounter.
"Our boys are ready and have

a good attitude, but SC report
edly has its best freshman team
in years."
51 To Suit Up
Fifty-one freshmen will suit up
for the papooses, while only 32
freshmen will come with SC
Coach Hampton has fashioned
three teams which will play
both ways except for certain
specialists. Only half of the 51
will see heavy duty.

Hampton said that he felt
that this year's squad was
slightly inferior to last year's
team, which placed eight start
ers on the present varsity. But
Hampton claimed the only im
portant difference was that last
year's squad had more depth.
Oliver to Start at Q.B.
At quarterback for the junior
tribe eleven will be Dick Oliver,
a highly rated prospect from
Texas. He replaces Ron Fugi*
kawa, who has a
thumb. Backing up Olivet will
be Nick DeLurgio.
SC's counterpart to Oliver is
the strongpoint of the Trobabe
offense. He is Mike Holmgren, a
210 pounder from the Bay area.
Holmgren, who starred in the
Shrine game last year, was one
of the most sought-after high
school boys in the state.
Hampton is leery of the pass
ing threat from Holmgren, but
looks for Mike Carrigan, Dick
Oliver, and Howard Williams to

throttle the air attack.
Counting' on Graves
On offense, Hampton is count
ing on Tackle Jody Graves and
mammoth center Ken Carpenter
(6'6", 245) to open the neces
sary holes for runners Brian
Porter and Don Parish, who
both run the 40 yd. dash in 4.8
seconds with full uniform.
Graves and Carpenter, along
with end Bob Reinhard and
linebacker Pat Preston, were
standouts in the 14-0 victory
over the junior varsity and the
redshirts last Saturday.
Weight should not be a factor
in this game. The Stanford of
fensive line averages six pounds
heavier than the Trobabe block
ers, but the SC backs hold a 15
pound edge over their Stanford
counterparts.
More than likely, the game
will be decided by mistakes, al
ways present in initial contests.
Fumbles, interceptions, or pen
alties could be decisive factors.
