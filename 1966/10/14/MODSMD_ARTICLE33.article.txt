# Could Stanford Beat USC? Indian History Says YES!
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER Sports Editor 
Almost any gambler in the
world would chuckle mildly to
himself if you asked him,
"What are the odds that Stan
ford will take SC this Satur
day?"
After all, the Trojans have
beaten Texas, 10-6, squashed
IVisconsin 38-3, knocked Oregon
State 21-0, and downed Wash
ington, 17-14 ... all of which
boils down to a fifth place na
tional ranking for the Trojans
on both AP and UPI polls.
And Stanford? Stanford has
squeaked past San Jose State,
„nd gone down miserably to
Minnesota and Oregon. The only
high point so far has been a
33-14 whitewash of a mediocre
Tulane team.
It all looks pretty hopeless—
hopeless that is, until you think

for a moment about Stanford
football.
Granted, the Indians are his
torically probably the most in
consistent team in the United
States. And it is just that in
consistency that has turned
many an opposing coach's hair
gray.
Irish Bite The Bag
In 1963, Notre Dame's coach
brought an army of great white
hunters to pick off some strug
gling pigeons in Palo Alto.
Stanford showed few, if any,
signs of greatness through an
entire football season, but left
the Irish licking the bitter re
mains of a 24-14 defeat.
In 1964 Stanford barely broke
even in the won-lost column.
But two teams tripped painfully
over the inconsistent Indians.
The Tribe plastered an Oregon
team that had taken six straight.
Shortly thereafter, the Cards
dealt a 16-7 shuffling to Tommy
Prothro's Rose Bowl-bound Ore
gon State Beavers.
Stanford has never, in recent
years, carried off a flawless sea
son, flaying each game to its
maximum potential. But Stan
ford will always be regarded as
the mystery team that can hit
a high-r idi n g, overwhelming
favorite where it really hurts—
in the loss column.
So, what are the odds that
Stanford could smash the Tro
jan fortress? Better than you
think.

Stanford has never, in recent
years, carried off a flawless sea
son, flaying each game to its
maximum potential. But Stan
ford will always be regarded as
the mystery team that can hit
a high-r idi n g, overwhelming
favorite where it really hurts—
in the loss column.
So, what are the odds that
Stanford could smash the Tro
jan fortress? Better than you
think.
Almost any gambler in the
world would chuckle mildly to
himself if you asked him,
"What are the odds that Stan
ford will take SC this Satur
day?"
After all, the Trojans have
beaten Texas, 10-6, squashed
IVisconsin 38-3, knocked Oregon
State 21-0, and downed Wash
ington, 17-14 ... all of which
boils down to a fifth place na
tional ranking for the Trojans
on both AP and UPI polls.
And Stanford? Stanford has
squeaked past San Jose State,
„nd gone down miserably to
Minnesota and Oregon. The only
high point so far has been a
33-14 whitewash of a mediocre
Tulane team.
It all looks pretty hopeless—
hopeless that is, until you think

for a moment about Stanford
football.
Granted, the Indians are his
torically probably the most in
consistent team in the United
States. And it is just that in
consistency that has turned
many an opposing coach's hair
gray.
Irish Bite The Bag
In 1963, Notre Dame's coach
brought an army of great white
hunters to pick off some strug
gling pigeons in Palo Alto.
Stanford showed few, if any,
signs of greatness through an
entire football season, but left
the Irish licking the bitter re
mains of a 24-14 defeat.
In 1964 Stanford barely broke
even in the won-lost column.
But two teams tripped painfully
over the inconsistent Indians.
The Tribe plastered an Oregon
team that had taken six straight.
Shortly thereafter, the Cards
dealt a 16-7 shuffling to Tommy
Prothro's Rose Bowl-bound Ore
gon State Beavers.
