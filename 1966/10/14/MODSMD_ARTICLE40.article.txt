## Co-ops Prove Successful 
### Tim Haight 
Students at UCLA, USC, and
Cal live for about $60 per month
in student cooperative housing.
At Stanford, room and board
costs more than twice as much,
and the facilities are nowhere
near twice as good.
How do the co-ops do it?
First, the facilities use a mini
mum of professional help. Sec
ond, the co-ops take over low
cost buildings off-campus. Third,
each student puts in four or five
hours a week on house duties.
By cutting overhead and
working together, costs are kept
down and morale is high. The
UCLA co-op, the University Co
operative Housing Association
(UCHA) is an example.
Undergrade
The UCHA houses 200 stu
dents and provides board for

218. Twenty-five per cent of the
members are graduate students,
the rest undergrads. There are
only three non-student em
ployeesâ€”a general manager, a
maintenance man, and a cook.
All the other jobs are done by
students. Some of these, such
as relief cook and work man
ager are salaried.
The assets of the organiza
tion, founded in the 30's, are
now more than $500,000, and the
reserves are steadily growing.
The co-op has three buildings
near campus, and is now plan
ning to build another.
Although most students are
originally drawn to the co-op by
the cheap rates, a real esprit
has developed. The kitchen Is
open 24 hours a day for hot
drinks and possible leftovers

and has become a center for
discussions that even attract
many non-members. The morale
seems to have some academic
benefit, too. In eight of the last
10 years, the co-op has had the
highest GPA on campus.
So why not do it here?
Preconditions
In an interview this summer,
Harley Hardman, the manager
of the UCHA, outlined the pre
conditions for setting up a co
op at Stanford. Briefly, we need
about 10 or 20 "hard-core" stu
dents who would be willing to
put some time and hard work
into finding a building, solicit
ing members, and setting up the
necessary facilities to start.
We'd need some place off
campus big enough for at least
30 students, although smaller
co-ops could work. We'd need a
deposit of $50 or so at the be
ginning to purchase the kitchen
equipment, and we'd need some
one who could purchase in bulk.
Both Mr. Hardman and the
director of the co-op at Cal have
volunteered to come to Stanford
and help a group start a co-op.
We would not be lacking ad
vice.
Zoning* in P.A.
We would have some specific
ally "Stanford" difficulties, how
ever. Women are still stuck on
campus. At Cal and USC, there
are co-ops for women. Zoning
in Palo Alto isn't always right
for such an operation. And Palo
Alto has its little old ladies.
But maybe even an on-cam
pus co-op is possible. Senator
Kuchel inserted a co-op provi
sion in a Federal loan law a
few years ago. And there's al
ways the hope of snatching
some old fraternity house in the
years to come.
