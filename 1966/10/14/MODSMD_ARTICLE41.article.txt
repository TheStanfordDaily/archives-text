## Boycott On French Wines Sends DeGaulle To Knees 
### Art Buchwald 
WASHINGTONâ€”Rep. Samuel
Stratton, Democrat of upstate
New York, charged that Presi
dent De Gaulle was trying to
undermine the United States
economy, and he urged Ameri
cans to stop buying French
wine.
"If we stopped buying French
wines and bought New York
State wines, De Gaulle would be
on his knees in a short time."
If what Congressman Strat
ton says is true, I wouldn't like
to be in the French president's
shoes.
Suppose President De Gaulle
is working at the Elysee Palace
and an aide barges in.
"Monsieur le President, it has
just come over the radio that
the American people have
stopped buying French wines
and are going to drink New
York wine instead."
"Zut alors. There go my plans
for an independent France."
"The Bordeaux people are in
the outer office, and they wish
to speak with you."
"Send them in."
"Monsieur le President, as
members of the Bordeaux Wine
Association, we have come to
ask you to do something about
the crisis."
"Monsieurs, I did not dream
when I asked the American
troops to leave France that they
would stop drinking our wine."
"Monsieur le President, we
winegrowers feel you have gone
too far. It is one thing to bring
grandeur and glory to France,
but at what a price! We feel
you must ask the Americans to
forgive you for everything
you've done."
Sell Gold!
"There must be some other
way," De Gaulle says. "Perhaps
we could offer to sell back all
the gold we bought from them."
"I don't believe it would satis
fy them. A people who are will

ing to drink nothing but New
York wine for the rest of their
lives are a tough people to deal
with."
"I could call off the testing of
the atomic bomb."
"That might be helpful. At
least it's worth a try."
De Gaulle calls the American
ambassador and speaks to him.
He then hangs up. 'The ambas
sador says he'll pass on my
thoughts, but it may be too late.
They started shipping out the
New York State wines to the
supermarkets last week."
A winegrower says,"And to
think we thought the American
people were paper tigers."
More of A Gesture
Another winegrower says,
"We must make more of a ges
ture. Couldn't we agree to pay
the United Nations the money
we owe them?"
"That might cost us more
than what our French wine
brings in," De Gaulle says.
"Perhaps we could switch our
policy on the Vietnam war?"
"It's worth a try. At least it
won't cost us anything," De
Gaulle says.
The phone rings and De
Gaulle speaks. "Yes sir. I'm
sorry, sir. Yes, sir, I'll do my
best." He hangs up. "That was
the president of the Burgundy
Wine Tasters Association. He's
hopping mad."
A bordeaux winegrower says,
"To hell with Burgundy!"
"What opera is that from?"
De Gaulle asks.
"Enough of this nonsense,
Monsieur le President. We want
to know what you're going to
do."
"I have no choice. I must get
down on my knees. Send in the
photographers."
As De Gaulle kneels on the
floor, one of the winegrowers
whispers to another. "He's so
tall you'd never even know it."
