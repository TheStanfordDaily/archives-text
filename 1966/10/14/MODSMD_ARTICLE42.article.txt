# Letters To The Editor
## Business Ideology 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
Because the incomprehension
in your editorial on the business
school was more alarming than
its banality was fatiguing, I felt
I should reply. I hope you ap
preciate the fact that, after the
editorial, I take you seriously
enough to do so.
Fascinating as it is to be told
"a society whose problems are
rapidly increasing in complexi
ty" requires "graduates who
posses the leadership and under
standing to meet the problems
of a growing America,"it would
have been a good deal more in
teresting if you had specified
what the technocrats and public
relations whores which the busi
ness school turns out are going
to contribute. The sound all
around you is the discontent of
students who are not pleased at
the prospect of devoting their
talents and energies to the goal
of business which is profit or to
the business society's social goal
which is an ever greater Gross
National Product.
The business school under the
leadership of Dean Arbuckle
(who also leads Stanford Re
search Institute which last year
assisted a growing America by
developing new techniques in
chemical warfare) has never to
my knowledge spoken to the
university community about the
fact that there is a most serious
crisis of belief in the American
business system. Not from out
side but inside, from the bright
est and liveliest kids who come
here to learn and discover that
the system offers them — useful
or meaningful work.
The business school ideology
is simple: MORE. But the young
people on the campus don't
want more, they want better,
and the system can't hear them.
I would be both surprised and
intensely interested in a cogent
denial from you of the truth of
what I'm saying. If you can't
deny it, please stop writing such
nauseating drivel.

• Fire Away
Editor, The Daily:
Either Steve Gruber does his
deeds knowingly, in which case
he should be fired, or he does
them unknowingly, in which
case he should be fired. His
treatment of Mr. Cranston's re
marks Tuesday is a complete
inversion of what was said. Gov.
Brown does not provide "po
litical leadership" of the Boss
Tweed variety; true enough.
But Cranston's emphasis was on
practical leadership in educa
tion, natural resources, welfare
and justice, and on the longterm
damage resulting from a four

year Reagan term. Both empha
sis and meaning were so clear
that for Mr. Gruber to get them
wrong required either great in
eptitude or great determination.
If public leaders speaking at
Stanford find their endorse
ments transformed into attacks,
they are unlikely to come again.
The Daily story is an insult to
Mr. Cranston personally and a
disservice to the University.
Gruber must go!

Editor's Note: We can only
refer you to the fourth para
graph of Steve ember's article,
which is a direct quote of Cran
ston's response to a question
from the floor. At least three
Daily staff members were wit
nesses to Cranston's answer.
We can only take Mr. Cranston
at his word.
• Soul Pandering
Editor, The Dally:
It is truly enlightening to find
in our midst a student who feels
qualified to speak for the moral
development of the entire uni
versity community. Dennis Sims
is to be praised for his bold de
fense of student inquiry within
a free academic society; but his
real contribution to our com
munity is his inspirational defi
nition of university "soulpan
dering".
In order for Stanford to de
velop and preserve academic
freedom, the administration
must naturally deny any mem
ber of the Armed Forces any
form of academic opportunity.
It is obviously a moral indigna*
tion that officers of the Armed
Services be allowed an advanced
exposure to an intellectual en
vironment. The administration
should be censured for permit
ting even fractional elements of
the Armed Forces to be inte
grated within the university
community. How much better it
would be if only certain people
were allowed the "freedom" of
academic inquiry.
Why of all places would the
Army choose to send a few of
its officers to Stanford? How
can the Defense Department be
lieve that the educational de
sires of its officers be met by
the graduate divisions of a uni
versity? Questions of such a
rhetorical nature serve best to
show the obvious consistencies
in Mr. Sims assumptions. The
administration can no longer, in
the light of ethical proof, select
students on academic qualifica
tion; the university must main
tain the "freedom" of academic
inquiry by careful discrimina
tion. Lets eliminate all that
"soulpandering".

• Soul Pandering
Editor, The Dally:
It is truly enlightening to find
in our midst a student who feels
qualified to speak for the moral
development of the entire uni
versity community. Dennis Sims
is to be praised for his bold de
fense of student inquiry within
a free academic society; but his
real contribution to our com
munity is his inspirational defi
nition of university "soulpan
dering".
In order for Stanford to de
velop and preserve academic
freedom, the administration
must naturally deny any mem
ber of the Armed Forces any
form of academic opportunity.
It is obviously a moral indigna*
tion that officers of the Armed
Services be allowed an advanced
exposure to an intellectual en
vironment. The administration
should be censured for permit
ting even fractional elements of
the Armed Forces to be inte
grated within the university
community. How much better it
would be if only certain people
were allowed the "freedom" of
academic inquiry.
Why of all places would the
Army choose to send a few of
its officers to Stanford? How
can the Defense Department be
lieve that the educational de
sires of its officers be met by
the graduate divisions of a uni
versity? Questions of such a
rhetorical nature serve best to
show the obvious consistencies
in Mr. Sims assumptions. The
administration can no longer, in
the light of ethical proof, select
students on academic qualifica
tion; the university must main
tain the "freedom" of academic
inquiry by careful discrimina
tion. Lets eliminate all that
"soulpandering".

Editor, The Dally:
Because the incomprehension
in your editorial on the business
school was more alarming than
its banality was fatiguing, I felt
I should reply. I hope you ap
preciate the fact that, after the
editorial, I take you seriously
enough to do so.
Fascinating as it is to be told
"a society whose problems are
rapidly increasing in complexi
ty" requires "graduates who
posses the leadership and under
standing to meet the problems
of a growing America,"it would
have been a good deal more in
teresting if you had specified
what the technocrats and public
relations whores which the busi
ness school turns out are going
to contribute. The sound all
around you is the discontent of
students who are not pleased at
the prospect of devoting their
talents and energies to the goal
of business which is profit or to
the business society's social goal
which is an ever greater Gross
National Product.
The business school under the
leadership of Dean Arbuckle
(who also leads Stanford Re
search Institute which last year
assisted a growing America by
developing new techniques in
chemical warfare) has never to
my knowledge spoken to the
university community about the
fact that there is a most serious
crisis of belief in the American
business system. Not from out
side but inside, from the bright
est and liveliest kids who come
here to learn and discover that
the system offers them — useful
or meaningful work.
The business school ideology
is simple: MORE. But the young
people on the campus don't
want more, they want better,
and the system can't hear them.
I would be both surprised and
intensely interested in a cogent
denial from you of the truth of
what I'm saying. If you can't
deny it, please stop writing such
nauseating drivel.

Editor, The Daily:
Either Steve Gruber does his
deeds knowingly, in which case
he should be fired, or he does
them unknowingly, in which
case he should be fired. His
treatment of Mr. Cranston's re
marks Tuesday is a complete
inversion of what was said. Gov.
Brown does not provide "po
litical leadership" of the Boss
Tweed variety; true enough.
But Cranston's emphasis was on
practical leadership in educa
tion, natural resources, welfare
and justice, and on the longterm
damage resulting from a four

year Reagan term. Both empha
sis and meaning were so clear
that for Mr. Gruber to get them
wrong required either great in
eptitude or great determination.
If public leaders speaking at
Stanford find their endorse
ments transformed into attacks,
they are unlikely to come again.
The Daily story is an insult to
Mr. Cranston personally and a
disservice to the University.
Gruber must go!

and the system can't hear them.
I would be both surprised and
intensely interested in a cogent
denial from you of the truth of
what I'm saying. If you can't
deny it, please stop writing such
nauseating drivel.

Either Steve Gruber does his
deeds knowingly, in which case
he should be fired, or he does
them unknowingly, in which
case he should be fired. His
treatment of Mr. Cranston's re
marks Tuesday is a complete
inversion of what was said. Gov.
Brown does not provide "po
litical leadership" of the Boss
Tweed variety; true enough.
But Cranston's emphasis was on
practical leadership in educa
tion, natural resources, welfare
and justice, and on the longterm
damage resulting from a four

year Reagan term. Both empha
sis and meaning were so clear
that for Mr. Gruber to get them
wrong required either great in
eptitude or great determination.
If public leaders speaking at
Stanford find their endorse
ments transformed into attacks,
they are unlikely to come again.
The Daily story is an insult to
Mr. Cranston personally and a
disservice to the University.
Gruber must go!

We can only take Mr. Cranston
at his word.
• Soul Pandering
Editor, The Dally:
It is truly enlightening to find
in our midst a student who feels
qualified to speak for the moral
development of the entire uni
versity community. Dennis Sims
is to be praised for his bold de
fense of student inquiry within
a free academic society; but his
real contribution to our com
munity is his inspirational defi
nition of university "soulpan
dering".
In order for Stanford to de
velop and preserve academic
freedom, the administration
must naturally deny any mem
ber of the Armed Forces any
form of academic opportunity.
It is obviously a moral indigna*
tion that officers of the Armed
Services be allowed an advanced
exposure to an intellectual en
vironment. The administration
should be censured for permit
ting even fractional elements of
the Armed Forces to be inte
grated within the university
community. How much better it
would be if only certain people
were allowed the "freedom" of
academic inquiry.
Why of all places would the
Army choose to send a few of
its officers to Stanford? How
can the Defense Department be
lieve that the educational de
sires of its officers be met by
the graduate divisions of a uni
versity? Questions of such a
rhetorical nature serve best to
show the obvious consistencies
in Mr. Sims assumptions. The
administration can no longer, in
the light of ethical proof, select
students on academic qualifica
tion; the university must main
tain the "freedom" of academic
inquiry by careful discrimina
tion. Lets eliminate all that
"soulpandering".

Because the incomprehension
in your editorial on the business
school was more alarming than
its banality was fatiguing, I felt
I should reply. I hope you ap
preciate the fact that, after the
editorial, I take you seriously
enough to do so.
Fascinating as it is to be told
"a society whose problems are
rapidly increasing in complexi
ty" requires "graduates who
posses the leadership and under
standing to meet the problems
of a growing America,"it would
have been a good deal more in
teresting if you had specified
what the technocrats and public
relations whores which the busi
ness school turns out are going
to contribute. The sound all
around you is the discontent of
students who are not pleased at
the prospect of devoting their
talents and energies to the goal
of business which is profit or to
the business society's social goal
which is an ever greater Gross
National Product.
The business school under the
leadership of Dean Arbuckle
(who also leads Stanford Re
search Institute which last year
assisted a growing America by
developing new techniques in
chemical warfare) has never to
my knowledge spoken to the
university community about the
fact that there is a most serious
crisis of belief in the American
business system. Not from out
side but inside, from the bright
est and liveliest kids who come
here to learn and discover that
the system offers them — useful
or meaningful work.
The business school ideology
is simple: MORE. But the young
people on the campus don't
want more, they want better,
and the system can't hear them.
I would be both surprised and
intensely interested in a cogent
denial from you of the truth of
what I'm saying. If you can't
