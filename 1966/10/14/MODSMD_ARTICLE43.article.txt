## The 						Art Of Sneaking Into Dink 
### Bob Fishman 
Stanford students attempting
to avoid a night of study by at
tending a lecture at Dinketepiel
have noticed an interesting
phenomenon: they wind up
booking.
For, upon arriving at the
auditorium, they find that every
seat has been taken at least an
hour in advance.
This means that Stanford stu
dents wind up studying more,
thus raising the curve and add
ing to all sorts of anxieties,
neuroses, and identity crises.
In order to promote mental
health, we have therefore com
piled a guide entitled, "How to
Sneak into Dink Aud Without
Really Trying":
1. Come wearing a suit, four
cameras around your neck, and
carrying a card that reads
"Editor of the New York Times
on secret assignment." Tell the
usher that the safety of the free
world depends upon your admit
tance.
2. If this fails, discard the

coat and tie for a collection of
screwdrivers, hammers, and
safety pins. Then attempt to
pick the lock on one of the exit
doors.
Blasting caps and other ex
plosives are not recommended
for this task. They make your
entrance too conspicuous.
3. If this fails, men are ad
vised to put on an official-look
ing uniform and a badge that
reads "Chief Federal Fire Mar
shal" and demand admittance.
When the usher hesitates,
threaten to condemn the audito
rium as a health hazard.
Women would do best dress
ing as nurses. Be sure to go to
the door with a large paper bag
marked "Oxygen." Tell the
usher that a member of the
audience has collapsed from ex
haustion. Pick out one man who
looks especially tired and help
him to the door. Then take his
seat.
4. Come to the auditorium
with a trombone, bass fiddle,

tuba or other conspicuous musi
cal instrument. Then go to the
rehearsal room directly under
the stage. By looking through
the cracks in the stage you get
a marvelous view of the speak
er's feet. It's better than noth
ing.
5. If all else fails, pick up a
large notebook and assume a
serious expression. Tell the
usher in a heavy German accent
that you are the speaker for
this evening.
If he does not believe you,
yell and scream in whatever
language comes to mind.
If admitted to the auditorium,
quickly discard the notebook
and hide in a corner. Occasion
ally, however, an usher will in
sist upon escorting you to the
stage.
After the audience has risen
to applaud you, tell them that
you are really next week's
speaker.
What happens after that is
up to you.

that you are the speaker for
this evening.
If he does not believe you,
yell and scream in whatever
language comes to mind.
If admitted to the auditorium,
quickly discard the notebook
and hide in a corner. Occasion
ally, however, an usher will in
sist upon escorting you to the
stage.
After the audience has risen
to applaud you, tell them that
you are really next week's
speaker.
What happens after that is
up to you.
Stanford students attempting
to avoid a night of study by at
tending a lecture at Dinketepiel
have noticed an interesting
phenomenon: they wind up
booking.
For, upon arriving at the
auditorium, they find that every
seat has been taken at least an
hour in advance.
This means that Stanford stu
dents wind up studying more,
thus raising the curve and add
ing to all sorts of anxieties,
neuroses, and identity crises.
In order to promote mental
health, we have therefore com
piled a guide entitled, "How to
Sneak into Dink Aud Without
Really Trying":
1. Come wearing a suit, four
cameras around your neck, and
carrying a card that reads
"Editor of the New York Times
on secret assignment." Tell the
usher that the safety of the free
world depends upon your admit
tance.
2. If this fails, discard the

coat and tie for a collection of
screwdrivers, hammers, and
safety pins. Then attempt to
pick the lock on one of the exit
doors.
Blasting caps and other ex
plosives are not recommended
for this task. They make your
entrance too conspicuous.
3. If this fails, men are ad
vised to put on an official-look
ing uniform and a badge that
reads "Chief Federal Fire Mar
shal" and demand admittance.
When the usher hesitates,
threaten to condemn the audito
rium as a health hazard.
Women would do best dress
ing as nurses. Be sure to go to
the door with a large paper bag
marked "Oxygen." Tell the
usher that a member of the
audience has collapsed from ex
haustion. Pick out one man who
looks especially tired and help
him to the door. Then take his
seat.
4. Come to the auditorium
with a trombone, bass fiddle,

tuba or other conspicuous musi
cal instrument. Then go to the
rehearsal room directly under
the stage. By looking through
the cracks in the stage you get
a marvelous view of the speak
er's feet. It's better than noth
ing.
5. If all else fails, pick up a
large notebook and assume a
serious expression. Tell the
usher in a heavy German accent
that you are the speaker for
this evening.
If he does not believe you,
yell and scream in whatever
language comes to mind.
If admitted to the auditorium,
quickly discard the notebook
and hide in a corner. Occasion
ally, however, an usher will in
