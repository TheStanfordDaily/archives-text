temporarily, after two heated hours
of debate last night.
Tom Forstenzer, speaker of LASSU,
Martin Gerry, member of Judicial
Council and on the Committee of Fif
teen last year, and Charles Despres,
former student body president at
Reed College, were confirmed perma
nently while Jan Handke was ap
proved for only one week. Miss Hand
ke was not able to be present when
her appointment was voted on.
Many representatives took issue
with Harris' appointments from the
start of the session, expressing the
fear that they were not representa
tive of student body opinion as a
whole. Gerry, who was approved by
acclamation, was the only one of the
four to avoid interpellation, mention
ing that he was a member of a state
Republican coordinating committee,
the American Civil Liberties Union,
and friends of SNCC.

Harris, defending his appointments,
termed them "bright and capable of
considering an issue on their own
while at the same time recognizing
that LASSU has the right to recall."
"You are ignoring a basic fact if
you aren't thinking of the committee
as an arbitrating body," Harris point
ed out.
In his opening remarks the presi
dent said he looked upon the approval
of his appointees as a vote of confi
dence, warning "I doubt seriously
we'll get anything off the ground all
year if we can't start here. And if we
feel major changes are needed in edu
cational policy those changes are go
ing to be hard to get."
Pressed about whether he con
sidered his appointments representa
tive, Harris stated he had not tried
"to take a Gallup poll of the commu
nity" and that he was confident the
nominees, if they were not repre
sentative, were at least cognizant of
the range of student views.
In answer to charges that all five
were members of the New Left, Har

ris pointed out that he doubted there
could be more than two or three is
sues other than those of basic stu
dent rights on which he and Martin
Gerry would agree.
Other action by the Legislature in
cluded an amendment to the By-Laws
setting up the ASSU Housing Com
mission, setting the date for fall
elections, and the deferral of several
bills to a temporary financial com
mittee, also established at last night's
meeting.
The Housing Committee measure re
ferred to the Rules Committee last
week, was reported favorably and
passed . This bill sets up a commission

philosophy of a residence university,
freshman housing, fraternities, inde
pendent men's housing, women's hous
ing, and special projects and research.
A new Head Yell Leader, off-campus
LASSU seats that are now open, and
graduate representatives will be elect
ed on November 1 and 2, LASSU de
cided.
Several bills were also referred to

a temporary finance committee, whose
members were approved at the meet
ing. Members include Barbara Her
wig, Mike Ladra, Howard Schwartz,
and Terry Murphy, Student Financial
Manager, who will chair the commit

Many representatives took issue
with Harris' appointments from the
start of the session, expressing the
fear that they were not representa

whole. Gerry, who was approved by
acclamation, was the only one of the
four to avoid interpellation, mention
ing that he was a member of a state
Republican coordinating committee,
the American Civil Liberties Union,
and friends of SNCC.

Harris, defending his appointments,
termed them "bright and capable of
considering an issue on their own
while at the same time recognizing
that LASSU has the right to recall."

you aren't thinking of the committee
as an arbitrating body," Harris point
ed out.
In his opening remarks the presi
dent said he looked upon the approval
of his appointees as a vote of confi
dence, warning "I doubt seriously
we'll get anything off the ground all
year if we can't start here. And if we
feel major changes are needed in edu
cational policy those changes are go
ing to be hard to get."
Pressed about whether he con
sidered his appointments representa
tive, Harris stated he had not tried
"to take a Gallup poll of the commu
nity" and that he was confident the
nominees, if they were not repre
sentative, were at least cognizant of
the range of student views.
In answer to charges that all five
were members of the New Left, Har

ris pointed out that he doubted there
could be more than two or three is
sues other than those of basic stu
dent rights on which he and Martin
Gerry would agree.
