# Warren Commission's Critic Lane To Speak On 'Rush To Judgment'
## 
### RISSA WHITE 
Mark Lane, author of Bush To
Judgment, a critique of the Warren
Commission report, will be on cam
pus today to deliver two speeches.
Under the sponsorship of the Law
Forum, he will speak at Cubberley
auditorium at noon. This meeting is
open to the public. At 3 p.m. in the
Tresidder Lounge, he will address a
meeting open only to the Stanford
community. A question period will
follow each speech.
Following his 3 p.m. talk, Lane will
stop in at the bookstore to autograph
copies of his book.
Lane's controversial book, exam

ining the murders of President Ken
nedy, Officer J. D. Tippit, and Lee
Harvey Oswald, is the number one

best-seller in the Bay Area, and num
ber two nationally.
Commissioners Defend Report
The Law Forum had hoped to stage
a debate between Lane and Wesley J.
Liebeler, acting professor of law at
UCLA and assistant counsel to the
Warren Commission. However, Liebe
ler is now under a libel suit over
comments he made Friday at UCLA
in another debate with Lane. Leibeler
is instead scheduled to speak at noon
Monday in Cubberley.
Leibeler and Lane will debate on
January 25, since this commitment
was made before Leibeler accused
Lane of "traveling around the coun
try with a pack of lies for the sole
purpose of making money."
In Rush To Judgment, Lane, a New
York attorney acting as Oswald's de
fense counsel, uses eyewitness re
ports and the Warren Commission's
own testimony to question the valid
ity of the Commission's report. In
response to this and other critical
books on the findings of the Warren
Commission, two members of the
commission have made separate
statements in defense of their work.
Rep. Gerald Ford (R-Mich.) and
Allen Dulles, former director of the
Central Intelligence Agency, maintain
that critics of the report have pro
duced no new evidence to cast doubt
on the report's conclusion that Lee
Harvey Oswald was the sole assassin
of President Kennedy.
No Theories On Killer
Lane maintains, though, that "a
concept of instant guilt grew around
Oswald as various media simulta
neously broadcast the claims of the

Dallas police that Oswald was the
'lone assassin.' "
After Oswald's murder, Lane Tead
the evidence which "proved Oswald's
guilt beyond a doubt." He was dis
satisfied with the contradictions and
began an investigation on his own.
"I have no theories as to who killed
the President or as to why it was
done," notes Lane. "This book, then,
is, in a sense, a response to Congress
man Ford."
Once Ford and Dulles broke the
promised silence made by the Com
mission, Lane challenged them to a
public debate. They have yet to reply
to this challenge.
Film Version
Using the research from his book,
Lane joined Emile deAntonio to pro
duce a film, also called Rush To Judg
ment. He will show this 14-minute
documentary based on the taped and
filmed reports of four eyewitnesses,
at the noon meeting today. Made on
location in Dallas, it is the only film
dealing with the assassination.
"Crucial photographs, never before
published, which themselves present
a serious challenge to the govern
ment's version of the case are seen
for the first time," reports deAn
tonio.
A personal and professional friend
of Kennedy, Lane formed the Citi
zens Committee of Inquiry following
the assassination. The fees that Lane
charges for his lectures go to this
committee, to be used for investiga
tion. He twice testified before the
Warren Commission and has lectured
on the case throughout the U.S. and
Europe. At his request, his testimony
before the Commission was publi
cized, while all other testimony was
received in secret.
Foils Support Lane
Apparently Lane's doubts are
shared by a number of Americans. A
recent Louis Harris poll indicates
that by a ratio of 3 to 2 the American
people reject the principal finding of
the report that Oswald was the lone
assassin.

"In the face of (this poll)," states
Lane, "the Warren Commission mem
bers have desperately begun to call
for silence and obedience.
"Two Commission members, Repre
sentative Ford and Allen Dulles, have
charged that my thoroughly docu
mented book Bush To Judgment is a
'disservice' to the 'memory of the late
President Kennedy.' Is it not true
that in a democratic society it is not
merely a right, but a responsibility
of citizenship to question fraudulent
governmental edicts? Consensus im
posed from above is the hallmark of a
totalitarian society.
"The American people have a right
to know who killed President Ken
nedy and why he died," insists Lane.
"The fact that the basic documents in
the case have been hidden in the na
tional archives until September 2039,
the fact that the physical evidence
is unavailable for examination (some
of it now being held by the Dallas
police), the fact that crucial photo
graphs have been suppressed, the fact
that the autopsy report on the Presi
dent's body was burned, the fact that
photographs were doctored and muti
lated after having been presented to
the government"â€”these facts must be
explained, he contends.
The only communication Lane has
had with the Kennedy family was
through Hugh Trevor-Roper, the Ox
ford historian who wrote the intro
duction to Rush To Judgment. Roper
received a note from Robert Kennedy
which read "Keep up the good work."

A review of Mark Lane's contro
versial book "Bush To Judgment"
appears today on page 2 of the Daily.
