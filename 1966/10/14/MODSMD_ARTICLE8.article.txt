### 
A panel of students involved in
overseas exchange programs discussed
their receptions abroad in an informal
meeting last night in Tresidder.
Those from Stanford International
Projects were Mike Fichter, modera
tor; Gloria Strauss, Peru FACE proj
ect; Patricia Aram, Guanahara, Bra
zil, cultural exchange; Bill Meyer, Keio
exchange; Pete Reidy, Volunteers in
Asia (Hong Kong); Holt Ruffin, Vol
unteers in Asia (Vietnam); and Uwe
Nagel, exchange student from the
Free University of Berlin.
The International Project workers,
who are completely independent of the
Stanford Overseas Campuses, serve in
work pro jects, cultural exchanges, and
individual student exchanges.
They last night said that they had
been well-received in their host coun
tries, and that as students they had a
great advantage over other visiting
Americans, such as servicemen or
tourists.
They encouraged all those interested
in any of the exchange programs to
attend the individual meetings to be
held for each project during the next
three weeks. More details about the
program will be given at the meetings,
they said.
