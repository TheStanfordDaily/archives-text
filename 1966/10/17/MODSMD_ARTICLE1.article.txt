# Plots Shape History Paranoiacs Maintain
## 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
Concluding his three-day stay at
Stanford Friday with a vivisection of
"the American political paranoiac"
was Dr. Richard Hofstadter, professor
of American History at Columbia Uni
versity.
Hofstadter's speech, "The Paranoid
Style in American Politics," drew an
overflow crowd at Dinkelspiel Audi
torium. Loudspeakers were set up in
White Plaza so that those unable to
find seats could hear Stern Hall's
guest-in-residence in his closing ad
dress.
Defining the "political paranoiac,"
Hofstadter said, "He always sees his
tory as the result of conspiracies.
There is no historical process for him;
everything is viewed in a personal
light and all evil is planned."
Not Medical Case
A political paranoiac must be dif
ferentiated from a clinical paranoiac,
Hofstadter explained. The former, he
said, is not a medical case, and usually
confines his paranoia to one area
of thought.
Hofstadter traced the development
of "the paranoid style" from the 18th
century, when members of a rational
istic society known as "Illuminati" fell
victim to this thought.
This society was supposedly plotting
numerous sinister conspiracies, "some
of which could outdo James Bond," he
said. Anti-Masonic and anti-Catholic
movements were also cited as histor
ical examples of the paranoid style.
Birch Society Cited
The John Birch Society and its
founder, Robert Welch, fell under Hof
stadter's scalpel when the professor
looked for evidence of the style in
modern politics. He cited the right
wing organization as an example of a
particular breed of paranoiacs that
has evolved in the last 50 years.
"Today the paranoiac feels dispos
sessed,"' he explained. "He thinks
America has been taken away by the
conspirators and thus sees a betrayal
among the leaders of his government."
Hofstadter cited statements alleging
that Franklin Roosevelt and his "New
Deal" were an attempt to pave the
way for socialism in America, and that
President Eisenhower is a communist.
Frantic Race
Dr. Hofstadter indicated that sev
eral facets of the paranoid style have
always been evident. "Since he views
history as conspiracy, time is always
running out. He is in a frantic race
to stop the conspiracy before it con
quers," he said.
Militance is the second great char
acteristic, Hofstadter continued.
"There is no compromise for the para
noiac—it's either total victory of to
tal defeat." But he falls victim to a
vicious cycle with his militancy, Hof
stadter added. Every time he loses—
and he inevitably does—he becomes
more frustrated and consequently
more militant.
The third characteristic of the po
litical panaoiac is his adopting the
techniques of the opposition. "He often
flatters the enemy by copying him,"
he said. "For example, the Ku Klux
Klan imitates the Catholic Church
with its robes, and the Birchers imi
tate communist organizations with
their front groups."
Flatters Enemy
Finally, the professor noted that
the paranoiac always attaches great
significance to renegades from the

opposition. "The paranoiac feels these
traitors give their cause a justification
and hope for possible victory," he said.
The philosophy of the paranoid style
is extremely coherent, he concluded,
because it is built on the basic as
sumption that "conspiracy is the root
of all evil."
Earlier in the day, Dr. Hofstadter
held a press conference at which he
responded to various questions about
Johnson and the war, and Johnson,
the intellectual, Humphrey and Rob
ert Kennedy, and the civil rights
movement.
Professor Hofstadter said he thought
President Johnson had unwillingly es
calated the war in Vietnam on the
basis of reports predicting rapid vic
tory. "Once he became committed,
however, he began to accept the war
and the arguments for its escalation.
He now feels he must prove he was
correct in escalating."
