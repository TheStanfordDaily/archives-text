ard M. Nixon predicted today the Republican
Party would pick up 700 seats in state legis
latures in the November 8 election.
Nixon, who recently completed a cross
country political fund-raising tour, said he

VIETNAM
• Vietnam Passes Korea
WASHINGTON — The United States now
has more men in Vietnam than were stationed
in Korea during the peak of that war—and
officials leave little doubt that the commit
ment will go higher.
U.S. manpower in South Vietnam hit 328,000
this week, 1,000 more than the number of
American troops deployed within Korea in
June 1953.
This milestone in the Southeast Asian
struggle virtually passed unnoticed until the
Pentagon's statistical branch, in response to
questions, provided figures showing the Ko
rean in-country strength was 327,000 at its
height.
The over-all U.S. force involved in the Viet
nam war, including out-of-country support
elements, still is about 60,000 shy of the peak
over-all Korean commitment of 472,800.
The surpassing of the Korean in-country
mark came as Secretary of Defense Robert S.
McNamara was touring Vietnam.
• Terrorists Strike In Saigon
SAlGON—Terrorists exploded a mine near

a bus stop for U.S. servicemen on one of Sai
gon's mafn thoroughfares today, killing an
American soldier and an aged Vietrumeie
woman. I
The American was said to have been taken
from the scene alive, but to have died later
while undergoing surgery in a hospital. Seven
other Americans were wounded, three of them
seriously, military officials said.
Five Vietnamese also were wounded along
the busy street by the explosion of the home
made claymore mine, apparently set off by a
timing device.
The claymore, which can be pre-aimed, went
off at 6:40 a.m., about the time American ser
vicemen from three nearby enlisted men's bil
lets start to gather at the bus stop.
• Russ-China Dispute
MOSCOW—The Soviet Union and Poland
charged yesterday that Red China is hurting
the Communist aid program for Vietnam.
The charge appeared in a joint communique
marking the formal end of a six-day visit to
the Soviet Union by Polish Communist chief
Wladyslaw Gomulka and other Polish leaders.
The communique also backed all of Hanoi's
peace terms, first made public in 1965. These
include demands for an end to U.S. bombing
of North Vietnam and a complete American
withdrawal from South Vietnam before any
peace negotiations.
