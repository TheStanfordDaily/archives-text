# ST&T Seeks Membership Applications
## 
### 
Stanford Today and Tomorrow
membership applications are
now available at Bowman Alum
ni House, according to Warren
Lyons, chairman.
Interviews will be held
nesday and Thursday; sopho
mores and juniors interested in
this group are urged to apply.
Sponsored by the Stanford As
sociates, the committee works
to increase communication
among the different groups
which comprise the University,
said Lyons. ST&T sponsors
events and discussions ranging
from President Sterling's Win
ter Convocation to informal stu
dent-alumni dinners.
One of the main programs for
the year is the establishment of
student contacts within each liv
ing group. Lyons said these coh
tacts will "serve as a source of
ideas and suggestions as well as
a means of communication for
other programs."
Working in cooperation with
other committees, ST&T also
hopes to organize a group of
alumnae advisors, Lyons noted.
These individuals would help stu
dents reccognize the possibilities
which exist after graduation, and
the contact should also lead to
better understanding between
the groups.
Three weeks ago ST&T held a
leadership conference attended
by 50 faculty and staff members,
including the deans of the major
schools, and 100 students. Din
ner at the University Club was
followed by discussion groups
covering the following topics:
Advising and Counseling, Cur
riculum Innovation, Atheltics,
Housing, and Students Regula
tions.
Interested applicants should
complete and return the applica
tion form to Bowman Alumni
House by Tuesday afternoon
and sign up for an interview at
that time.
