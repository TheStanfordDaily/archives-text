# Graduate Students Begin Year-Long Study Of Alviso
## 
### MIKE KUHL 
Alviso, "a miserable little place
down at the bottom of the bay,"
is slated for a year-long
study by a team of Stanford
University graduate students.
The project, initiated at the
request of one of California's
oldest cities, will be keyed to
Alviso's particular problems.
Eleven advanced architecure
students and six law students
will be advised by Thomas T.
Williamson, a Menlo Park archi
tect; Professor Charles Meyers;
a lecturer at Stanford; John
Henry Merryman of the Stan
ford Law School; and Harry L.
Sanders, University Director of
Planning.
For the first three months the
group has divided into study

groups to set up a priority list of
problems and make recommen
dations for their solution. Corn-
Committees are studying sources
of funds from federal and state
sources to assist the city, the eco
nomic situation of the East Bay
in relation to Alviso, and the
government-power structure of
the city.
According to Steven Tennis,
a third-year law student at Stan
ford and a member of the study,
the economic activity of Alviso
must be stimulated.
The alternative is to in
crease the attractiveness of Al
viso, which served as a port for
sailing barges and whaling ships
more than 100 years ago.
The advanced architecture stu
dents will be concerned with de
veloping a master plan to in
sure appropriate land use in the
city's physical layout.
In the past Stanford students
have made studies for use by the
city governments of Benecia,
Vallejo, and Morgan Hill.
