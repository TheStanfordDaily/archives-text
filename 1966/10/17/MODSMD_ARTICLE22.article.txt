# Conference Considers Stanford Poll
## 
### 
At a conference on the
antiwar movement, Professor
Franz Schurman of the Center
for Chinese Studies at Berkeley
stated today: "As things now
stand we face an almost unlim
ited future of wars. The only
question is whether it will be
small, limited war, or whether
a larger war will come more
rapidly. The past experience has
been in favor of limited war."
The radical movement cannot
affect foreign policy, Schurman
said. It has been the illusion of
many liberal academics and
politicians that access to power
by men Buch as Ambassador
Goldberg could be used to exert

influence on foreign policy. The
cumulative effect of pressures
towards peace has merely been
to delay plans for military ac
tion.
Other Speakers
Other speakers at the confer
ence were somewhat less pessi
mistic. Richard Brody of Stan
ford and Steve Murdock of
Peoples World discussed en
couraging signs in public opin
ion and in the recent primary
elections. Marshall Windmiller
of San Francisco State dis
cussed shortcomings in the
peace movement and suggested
targets of action.
But Schurman saw little hope

in the long run, and James
O'Connor of San Jose State said
the abolition of United States
militarism as a separate force
would come only with a change
in the American system of po
litical economy.
Unless there is a major crisis
in the network of international
power and economy, Schurman
said, he did not see much chance
for an effective political anti
war movement in the United
States.
James O'Connor, a Marxist
economist at San Jose State, de
veloped hits thesis that milita
rism in the United States is in
timately bound up with the

whole economic system and the
society at large. To change the
first one must change the sec
ond, he said; the peace move
ment must know its true enemy,
the "corporate oligarchy".
Stanford Poll"
Richard Brody, associate pro
fessor of political science at
Stanford, discussed the so-called
"Stanford poll" of American
public opinion which he and sev
eral colleagues ran last Febru
ary and March. The poll had
two major findings, he said.
First, there were relatively
few consistent "hawks" or
"doves". Sixty-one per cent of
those polled approved the Presi
dent's handling of the war—a
result virtually identical with
that of the Gallup poll—but of
those who approved, 80% were
willing to see negotiations. (On

the other hand 81% rejected im
mediate withdrawal of Ameri
can forces even if President
Johnson wanted it.)
Second, whereas it had been
claimed on the basis of previous
commercial polls that most of
the opposition to Johnson was
"hawklike", the "Stanford" poll
showed the opposition to be
over 2 to 1 "dovellke".
Brody and his colleagues or
ganized the poll largely out of
dissatisfaction with the lack of
depth and range of questions in
existing commercial polls, Brody
told the conference. Publication
of the poll had a temporary
salutary effect: for a short time
other polls began asking a
greater range of questions.
Now, however, the commer
cial pollsters are simply asking
whether a person would prefer
"escalation" or "withdrawal",
and with this limited range of
questions, the results are again
interpreted to say that the op
position to Johnson is predomi
nantly "hawklike."
Since publication of the "Stan
ford" poll, Brody said, there has
been a steady decline in public
approval of the way Johnson is
handling the war; it is now
down to 49% according to com
mercial polls.
In World War II support of
the war jumped to 80-90% after
the bombing of Pearl Harbor
and stayed there for five years
with little change. In the Ko
rean War public support leapt
up, then declined rapidly. The
1952 election was virtually
unique in that a sizable propor
tion of the presidential vote was
affected by an issue of foreign
policy.
Primary Results
Steve Murdock discussed peace
campaigns in primary elections
which he saw during a three
month tour of the country as a
correspondent for the newspa
per Peoples World. Outside the
San Francisco Bay area, where
peace candidates in the Scheer,
Drath, and Keating campaigns
lost but polled sizable percent
ages of the vote, the most inter
esting recent campaigns were in
Illinois, New York, and Michi
gan.

politicians that access to power
by men Buch as Ambassador
Goldberg could be used to exert

cumulative effect of pressures

Other Speakers
Other speakers at the confer
ence were somewhat less pessi
mistic. Richard Brody of Stan
ford and Steve Murdock of
Peoples World discussed en
couraging signs in public opin
ion and in the recent primary
elections. Marshall Windmiller
of San Francisco State dis
cussed shortcomings in the
peace movement and suggested
targets of action.
But Schurman saw little hope

in the long run, and James
O'Connor of San Jose State said
the abolition of United States
militarism as a separate force
would come only with a change
in the American system of po
litical economy.
Unless there is a major crisis
in the network of international
power and economy, Schurman
said, he did not see much chance
for an effective political anti
war movement in the United
States.
James O'Connor, a Marxist
economist at San Jose State, de
veloped hits thesis that milita
rism in the United States is in
timately bound up with the

whole economic system and the
society at large. To change the
first one must change the sec
ond, he said; the peace move
ment must know its true enemy,
the "corporate oligarchy".
Stanford Poll"
Richard Brody, associate pro
fessor of political science at
Stanford, discussed the so-called
"Stanford poll" of American
public opinion which he and sev
eral colleagues ran last Febru
ary and March. The poll had
two major findings, he said.
First, there were relatively
few consistent "hawks" or
"doves". Sixty-one per cent of
those polled approved the Presi
dent's handling of the war—a
result virtually identical with
that of the Gallup poll—but of
those who approved, 80% were
willing to see negotiations. (On

the other hand 81% rejected im
mediate withdrawal of Ameri
can forces even if President
Johnson wanted it.)
Second, whereas it had been
claimed on the basis of previous
commercial polls that most of
the opposition to Johnson was
"hawklike", the "Stanford" poll
showed the opposition to be
over 2 to 1 "dovellke".
Brody and his colleagues or
ganized the poll largely out of
dissatisfaction with the lack of
depth and range of questions in
existing commercial polls, Brody
told the conference. Publication
of the poll had a temporary
salutary effect: for a short time
other polls began asking a
greater range of questions.
Now, however, the commer
cial pollsters are simply asking
whether a person would prefer
"escalation" or "withdrawal",
and with this limited range of
questions, the results are again
interpreted to say that the op
position to Johnson is predomi
nantly "hawklike."
Since publication of the "Stan
ford" poll, Brody said, there has
been a steady decline in public
approval of the way Johnson is
handling the war; it is now
down to 49% according to com
mercial polls.
In World War II support of
the war jumped to 80-90% after
the bombing of Pearl Harbor
and stayed there for five years
with little change. In the Ko
rean War public support leapt
up, then declined rapidly. The
1952 election was virtually
unique in that a sizable propor
tion of the presidential vote was
affected by an issue of foreign
policy.
Primary Results
Steve Murdock discussed peace
campaigns in primary elections
which he saw during a three
month tour of the country as a
correspondent for the newspa
per Peoples World. Outside the
San Francisco Bay area, where
peace candidates in the Scheer,
Drath, and Keating campaigns
lost but polled sizable percent
ages of the vote, the most inter
esting recent campaigns were in
Illinois, New York, and Michi
gan.
At a conference on the
antiwar movement, Professor
Franz Schurman of the Center
for Chinese Studies at Berkeley
stated today: "As things now
stand we face an almost unlim
ited future of wars. The only
question is whether it will be
small, limited war, or whether
a larger war will come more
rapidly. The past experience has
been in favor of limited war."
The radical movement cannot
affect foreign policy, Schurman
said. It has been the illusion of
many liberal academics and
politicians that access to power
by men Buch as Ambassador
Goldberg could be used to exert

influence on foreign policy. The
cumulative effect of pressures
towards peace has merely been

cussed shortcomings in the
peace movement and suggested
targets of action.
But Schurman saw little hope

in the long run, and James
O'Connor of San Jose State said
the abolition of United States
militarism as a separate force
would come only with a change
in the American system of po
litical economy.
Unless there is a major crisis
in the network of international
power and economy, Schurman
said, he did not see much chance
for an effective political anti
war movement in the United
States.
James O'Connor, a Marxist
economist at San Jose State, de
veloped hits thesis that milita
rism in the United States is in
timately bound up with the

whole economic system and the
society at large. To change the
first one must change the sec
ond, he said; the peace move
ment must know its true enemy,
the "corporate oligarchy".
Stanford Poll"
Richard Brody, associate pro
fessor of political science at
Stanford, discussed the so-called
"Stanford poll" of American
public opinion which he and sev
eral colleagues ran last Febru
ary and March. The poll had
two major findings, he said.
First, there were relatively
few consistent "hawks" or
"doves". Sixty-one per cent of
those polled approved the Presi
dent's handling of the war—a
result virtually identical with
that of the Gallup poll—but of
those who approved, 80% were
willing to see negotiations. (On

the other hand 81% rejected im
mediate withdrawal of Ameri
can forces even if President
Johnson wanted it.)
Second, whereas it had been
claimed on the basis of previous
commercial polls that most of
the opposition to Johnson was
"hawklike", the "Stanford" poll
showed the opposition to be
over 2 to 1 "dovellke".
Brody and his colleagues or
ganized the poll largely out of
dissatisfaction with the lack of
depth and range of questions in
existing commercial polls, Brody
told the conference. Publication
of the poll had a temporary
salutary effect: for a short time
other polls began asking a
greater range of questions.
Now, however, the commer
cial pollsters are simply asking
whether a person would prefer
"escalation" or "withdrawal",
and with this limited range of
questions, the results are again
interpreted to say that the op
position to Johnson is predomi
nantly "hawklike."
Since publication of the "Stan
ford" poll, Brody said, there has
been a steady decline in public
approval of the way Johnson is
handling the war; it is now
down to 49% according to com
mercial polls.
In World War II support of
the war jumped to 80-90% after
the bombing of Pearl Harbor
and stayed there for five years
with little change. In the Ko
rean War public support leapt
up, then declined rapidly. The
1952 election was virtually
unique in that a sizable propor
tion of the presidential vote was
affected by an issue of foreign
policy.
Primary Results
Steve Murdock discussed peace
campaigns in primary elections
which he saw during a three
month tour of the country as a
correspondent for the newspa
per Peoples World. Outside the
San Francisco Bay area, where
peace candidates in the Scheer,
Drath, and Keating campaigns
lost but polled sizable percent
ages of the vote, the most inter
esting recent campaigns were in
Illinois, New York, and Michi
gan.
At a conference on the
antiwar movement, Professor
Franz Schurman of the Center
for Chinese Studies at Berkeley
stated today: "As things now
stand we face an almost unlim
ited future of wars. The only
question is whether it will be
small, limited war, or whether
a larger war will come more
rapidly. The past experience has
been in favor of limited war."
The radical movement cannot
affect foreign policy, Schurman
said. It has been the illusion of
many liberal academics and
politicians that access to power
by men Buch as Ambassador
Goldberg could be used to exert

influence on foreign policy. The
cumulative effect of pressures
towards peace has merely been
to delay plans for military ac
tion.
Other Speakers
Other speakers at the confer
ence were somewhat less pessi
mistic. Richard Brody of Stan
ford and Steve Murdock of
Peoples World discussed en
couraging signs in public opin
ion and in the recent primary
elections. Marshall Windmiller
of San Francisco State dis
cussed shortcomings in the
peace movement and suggested
targets of action.
But Schurman saw little hope

in the long run, and James
O'Connor of San Jose State said
