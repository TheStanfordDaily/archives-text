# 'Mata' Takes On Main Libe
## Gaieties 
### 
Tackling her first assignment
on the Stanford campus, Super-
Secret Spy Mata Hariovitch
emerges to confront Peter Dag
ger. Propriotor of "Jane's Bar
and Grill," a new campus hang
out, Dagger proposes a solution
to solve the dilemma of phasing
out the Main Libe. Overseeing
his protege's progress is Com
mrade Bannovitch, frustrated
supervisor of static processes.
The trio perfects its talents
as 1966 Gaieties, "AAAUUGH!

or Why Yellow-bellied Sapsuck
ers Eat Raspberry Licorice," ap
proaches opening night, No
vember 16.
From "Jane's" the action
moves to Red Immemorial
Square, where Mandolinovitch,
Russia's answer to the "Greasy
Spoons," strums and steals the
heart of a visiting Frosh Dolly.

crack at reserving blocks of 20

or more seats. A 20 per cent dis

the library steps in this year's
Gaieties, "AAAUUGH!"
