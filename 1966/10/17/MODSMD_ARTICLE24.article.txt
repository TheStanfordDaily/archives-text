# Blood Analyzer Used At Hospital
## 
### 
An automated blood analyzer
that will perform 12 different
chemical tests simultaneously is
now in operation at the Palo
Alto-Stanford Hospital Center.
The new $30,000 machine will
speed up the processing of
chemical laboratory tests and
substantially reduce their cost
to patients, according to Dr.
Frederick A. Fox, director of
clinical laboratories.
"The machine can perform one
battery of 12 tests every two
minutes," Dr. Fox said. "Before
the machine was available, it
would have taken one medical
technologist approximately four
to six hours to perform the
same 12 tests."
In addition, the 12 tests would
normally cost $76, but now cost
$18.
The tests are those most com
monly ordered by physicians to
assist them in the diagnosis and
treatment of patients. Dr. Fox
noted that within recent years
there has been an increased use
of such test batteries for health
screening.
