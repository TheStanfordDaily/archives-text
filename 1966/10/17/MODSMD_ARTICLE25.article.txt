# Troy Falls On Stanford. 21-7
## Brill Bops Winslow; Ball Bounds Free 
### H. JOSEPH HERNANDEZ 
The University of Southern
California Trojans came out
breathing fire Saturday and
demolished the Stanford foot
ball team, 21-7.
The Trojans outplayed and
outhit the Tribe, but could put
together only two long scoring
drives both in the first quarter.
Their other score came after
rover Eddie King intercepted a
pass on the Stanford 23 yard
line and returned it to the 10
from where the Trojans scored.
Even though the statistics
were fairly close—22s yards to
tal offense for USC, 204 for
Stanford—many of the 61,500
fans in Stanford Stadium were
surprised at the closeness of the
score. Most of Stanford's yard
age came in the second half
against USC substitutes.
No Go
While the Trojan defense was
impenetrable, the Stanford de
fense squad played well forcing
USC to work for their points.
Stanford's big problem was not
being able to put an effective
rush on quarterback Troy Wins
low. With time to spare Winslow
would wait for his receivers to
get open and then put the ball
in thei rarms.
The Indians received the open
ing kick off and found the traf
fic a little heavy so Dave Lewis
punted to the USC 29. As an

indication of what the Tribe was
up against, three runs in the
first series of downs netted Stan
ford minus four yards.
Trojan coaches did a good job
of scouting the Indians as Wins
low's first two passes showed.
The flanker would go 15 yards
and buttonhook. With the half
back covering him and the line
backers still up close, the tight
end would go ten, cut to the out
side, winding up behind the line
backers and in front of the
flanker. USC moved to the 48
from the 29 on two such passes.
Deep Flare Pattern
A couple of short runs and a
fumble gave USC a second and
15 situation on the Stanford 44.
Then the Trojans took advan
tage of a fault in the Stanford de
fense. The split end on the left,
Ron Drake, ran straight at the
halfback who had to give ground
to stay with him, a cut towards
the middle occupied the safety.
Meanwhile, halfback Rod Sher
man floated to the left, cut up
the sideline, and caught a 33
yard pass from Winslow to put
the ball on the 11.
Against the Stanford zone this
is an effective pass since the
defense end who will have trou
ble keeping up with a back any
way has to stay 10 to 15 yards
inbounds to protect the hook

zone and the defensive halfback
is covering the split end.
Halfback Don McCall ran for
four yards to the seven and
then Winslow hit Sherman on a
down and out pattern for the
score. Pat Cashman kicked the
extra point for a 7-0 lead.
USC Scores
Following the kick off, Stan
ford had to kick after gaining
minus three yards. USC took
over on their 46 and with McCall
and Winslow providing the im
petus scored seven more. Behind
some vicious blocking McCall
made twelve up the middle and
Winslow hit end Bob Miller
with passes of 14 and 7 to set up
McCall's one yard plunge.
Midway through the second
period King intercepted a Chuck
Williams pass intended for Bob
Conrad. Under pressure from
the unrelenting USC defensive
line, Williams underthrew the
pass and King returned it to the
10. The touchdown came off of a
down and in pattern.
Stanford made a threatening
gesture towards the end of the
half when Williams hit Conrad
with a 30 yard pass giving the
Tribe a first and 10 on the 12.
A crucial 10 yard loss attempting
to pass and two incomplete
passes kept Stanford from scor
ing. Defensive linemen Gary
Magner, Dennis Moore, Tim Ros
sovich, and Ray May handled
the Stanford blockers much to
Williams' chagrin.
The Indians were apparently
snapping the ball on the same
count every time since the Tro
jan linebackers would get a run
ning start and crash through at
just the right time to trap Wil
liams behind the line.
Nelson Intercepts
The touchdown Stanford did
score was a result of Dave Nel
son's interception at the USC 43
which he returned down the
sideline to the 19.
Gene Washington who had a
gimpy knee came in for his sec
cond play of the game and
sprinted around right end for 13
yards. USC stiffened. They
seemed determined not to let
the Indians score as they hit
heads with utter abandon and
only a pass interference call on
the one yard line on a fourth and
8 situation saved the Tribe from
a probably shut out. It took Stan
ford four downs to push it over
from one. Shoemaker kicked the
extra point.
Stanford theratened once more.
With five minutes left in the
game, Williams hit Bob Blunt
with a 25 yard pass which car
ried to the 21. Williams then hit
Conrad for a first down on the 9
yard line. Jack Root who played
sparingly because of a severe
charley horse gained five on a
draw.
An incomplete pass made
the situation third and 4. USC
would budge no more and in fact
took back some of what they had
given. Williams was rushed off
his feet twice in a row and
USC took over on their 16. The
game ended shortly therafter.
Stanford travels to the Big
Ten to take on Illinois next week.
USC has a home game next
week against Clemson.
Lineman of the game was Tro
jan defensive end Tim Rosso
vich.
Back of the game was Trojan
quarterback Troy Winslow. He
complete 9 of 13 passes for 114
yards and two touchdown.
