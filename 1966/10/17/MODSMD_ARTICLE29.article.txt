## 
### NICK SELBY 
Stanford's freshman football
team fell victim to numerous
mistakes and lost to the USC
Trobabes 42-0 in Stanford Stadi
um Saturday morning.
The Papooses fumbled away
the ball five times in the first
quarter but escaped serious
damage in the score. However,
the fumbles prevented any of
fensive attack.
USC quarterbacks Dick Holm
gren and Pete Sanchez couldn't
get scores although they had
the ball inside the Stanford 20
yard line five times in the first
ten minutes. Key tackles by
Jody Graves and Pat Preston
and interceptions by Dick Oliver
and Howard Williams prevented
Trobabe tallies.
Finally Escape Coffin
The Papooses finally escaped
from inside their 20 by virtue
of a 66 yard punt on first down
by end Bob Reinhard. Penalties
prevented the Trobabes from
advancing in the rest of the first
quarter.
The USC I-formation launched
a drive at the start of the sec
ond quarter. The Trobabes
moved 70 yards in 15 plays and
almost eight minutes.
Pete Sanchez passed to flank
er Rick Aldridge for eight
yards, then lateraled to half
back Bob Brown on an option
roll-out which carried for 16
more. Sanchez repeated these
plays until he had fourth and
nine on the Stanford 16.
Aldridge Scores
He then passed to Aldridge,
who made the play of the game
with a diving catch on the five
to keep the drive alive. Two
plays later, Sanchez rolled out
to the left and fired a strike to
Aldridge who out jumped his de
fender in the endzone.
The extra point pass was in
complete, and USC led by 6-0.
The second quarter then con
tinued as a defensive battle as
the mistakes disappeared for
the next seven minutes.
Durko Intercepts, Scores
With 47 seconds left in the
first half, Jim Plunckett sailed
a long pass toward Howard Wil
liams. However, Sandy Durko
intercepted for the Trobabes
and ran 62 yards for a score.
Joe Obbema made a key block
to erase the last Papoose. The
entire Stanford team overshift
ed with Durko's first steps to
the left, and Durko was un
touched as he sprinted down the
right sideline. Aldridge kicked
the extra point to make it 13-0
with 27 seconds left.
Fumble Sets Up Score
Williams fumbled the ensuing
kickoff and Gerry Shaw re
covered for USC on the 30.
Holmgren took advantage of the
miscue, and lofted a strike to
Aldridge in the endzone on the
next play. The extra-point play,

a pass from Sanchez to Rich
McCombs was good, making the
score 21-0 at the half.
Coach Hampton stated at the
end of the game that these two
"gift" scores determined the
turning point of the game:

"Even though we had made of
fense mistakes, our defense had
been very good. We prevented
a score five times Inside the 20.
But the two quick ones put the
game out of reach. Our boys
had no spirit the second half."
Second Guesser Target
Hampton said he was an open

target for second guessers be
cause he ordered Plunkett to
pass with only 47 seconds left.
If he had elected to run out the
clock, probably neither of the
two scores would have occurred.
Hampton decided to try to score
and"the strategy simply back
fired," he admitted.
The Trobabes had no trouble
in controlling the second half
play. Sanchez capped a 13 play,
60 yard drive with a seven yard
run in which he dragged two
tacklers into the endzone. Ald
ridge's kick was good to make
the score 28-0.
Final Scores
An eleven play march that
carried into the fourth quarter
provided the fifth Trobabe
score. Bob Brown smashed into
the endzone from the one, and
Sanchez ran a poor snap from
center for two extra-points.
Tim Carter intercepted a
Plunkett pass and ran 35 yards
for the final Trobabe score. The
extra point kick was wide.
Coach Hampton was extreme
ly disappointed with his play
ers' performance, but he was
not angry. He said that the wide
margin of defeat might help to
fire up his players. He singled
out Jody Graves and Dick Oli
ver for their good play and ex
tra desire.
