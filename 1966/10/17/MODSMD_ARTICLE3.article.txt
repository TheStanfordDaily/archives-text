## Skeptic Lane 
### 
Speaking for the Warren Commis
sion, UCLA Professor Wesley Liebe
ler will offer a public rebuttal to
Mark Lane, critic of the administra
tion's report on Kennedy's assassina

tion, today at noon in Cubberley audi
torium.
New York attorney Lane, author of
Rush to Judgment, spoke to capacity
crowds at Cubberley and Tresidder

on Friday. He condemned the report
as "having no semblance to the
truth."
According to Lane, he and Liebeler
did not debate on the same stage be

cause Lane plans to sue Liebeler for
libel. The Law Forum scheduled to
day's speech as the best alternative
to a debate.

Liebeler, acting professor of law at
UCLA, was an assistant attorney for
the Warren Commission. In Edward
Epstein's Inquest, Liebeler is com
mended as the lawyer who did his
best to "plug up the holes" in the
commission's report. According to
Professor John Kaplan of the Stan
ford Law School, "Liebeler is the
most sophisticated and knowledgeable
man to speak on the text of the War
ren Commission's report."
Liebeler has debated with Lane be
fore, and is scheduled to meet him
publicly at UCLA on January 25. To
day he will probably be asked to an
swer several charges made by Lane.
Lane contended that there is "over
whelming and conclusive evidence"
proving that at least two persons
killed President Kennedy.
Using his dry wit plus facts taken
from the Warren Commission report
and televised interviews of witnesses,
Lane won an enthusiastic hand from
both audiences.
Evidence Doctored
He charged that evidence and eye
witness testimony were doctored for
the final Warren Commission report,
and showed photographs which had
been cropped or superimposed "to tell
the Commission's story."
Witnesses, he said, were intimi
dated. Seventeen witnesses have mys
teriously died or disappeared since
the assassination, but their deaths are
not being investigated because, ac
cording to Lane, they don't fit into
any of the panels of investigation.
Most of these panels deal with Lee
Harvey Oswald.
"The Commission's first question
was not whether Oswald murdered
Kennedy," noted Lane, "but why Os
wald murdered Kennedy."
Ruby In Danger
Lane believes that Jack Ruby faces
serious danger of physical harm, as
he is the only known party who caft
give concrete information on the as
sassination and subsequent murders.
"If Ruby were to take the stand at
his re trial, recently ordered by a
Texas court," said Lane, "he could
answer tw© key questions: why he
shot Oswald and how he gained ac
cess to the heavily-guarded Dallas
police station at precisely the time
Oswald was being transferred."
Lane attacked the news media for
failing to dissent when the Warren
Commission report was released. But
he was even more critical of law
faculties for not investigating the
document.
He called for a petition campaign
"in every city and campus" to per
suade President Johnson to declassify
more of the commission's documents
and provide for public access to phy
sical evidence in the case.

commission's report. According to
Professor John Kaplan of the Stan
ford Law School, "Liebeler is the
most sophisticated and knowledgeable
man to speak on the text of the War
ren Commission's report."
Liebeler has debated with Lane be
fore, and is scheduled to meet him
publicly at UCLA on January 25. To
day he will probably be asked to an
swer several charges made by Lane.
Lane contended that there is "over
whelming and conclusive evidence"
proving that at least two persons
killed President Kennedy.
Using his dry wit plus facts taken
from the Warren Commission report
and televised interviews of witnesses,
Lane won an enthusiastic hand from
both audiences.
Evidence Doctored
He charged that evidence and eye
witness testimony were doctored for
the final Warren Commission report,
and showed photographs which had
been cropped or superimposed "to tell
the Commission's story."
Witnesses, he said, were intimi
dated. Seventeen witnesses have mys
teriously died or disappeared since
the assassination, but their deaths are
not being investigated because, ac
cording to Lane, they don't fit into
any of the panels of investigation.
Most of these panels deal with Lee
Harvey Oswald.
"The Commission's first question
was not whether Oswald murdered
Kennedy," noted Lane, "but why Os
wald murdered Kennedy."
Ruby In Danger
Lane believes that Jack Ruby faces
serious danger of physical harm, as
he is the only known party who caft
give concrete information on the as
sassination and subsequent murders.
"If Ruby were to take the stand at
his re trial, recently ordered by a
Texas court," said Lane, "he could
answer tw© key questions: why he
shot Oswald and how he gained ac
cess to the heavily-guarded Dallas
police station at precisely the time
Oswald was being transferred."
Lane attacked the news media for
failing to dissent when the Warren
Commission report was released. But
he was even more critical of law
faculties for not investigating the
document.
He called for a petition campaign
"in every city and campus" to per
suade President Johnson to declassify
more of the commission's documents
and provide for public access to phy
sical evidence in the case.
