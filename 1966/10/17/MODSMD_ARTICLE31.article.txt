# Intramural Action:
## 
### 
First-round play in intramural
volleyball, tennis and free throws
ends today, with perenially
strong Fremont matching bas
kets with El Cuadro at 8:30 in
featured action. In doubles ten
nis and two-man volleyball,
matches must be arranged and
completed by 5:00 today, with
winners advancing to the sec
ond round.
Upsets continue scarce in I.M.
football competition as the sec
ond round nears its end. "B"
team games take up the major
portion of today's schedule.
With the football season due
to be completed around Thanks
giving, word comes from the in
tradmural office of hopes—al
though little more than that as
yet—of a possible playoff with

murals winners from Cal. Sched
uling difficulties must first be
solved, however.
