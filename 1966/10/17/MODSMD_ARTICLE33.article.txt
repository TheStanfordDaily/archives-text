# Poloists Win In Third Overtime
## Sheerer Soft Touch 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER Sports Editor 
A packed Encina Pool audi
ence stood on its toes through
three overtime periods to watch
Stanford's water polo team down
USC, 11-10, in sudden death play
off last Saturday. The Indians
easily beat Foothill College, 9-4,
Friday.
After the USC game ended
In a tie after 4 quarters, two
regular overtime periods decided
nothing. The stalemate was brok
en in a sudden death third over
time.
John Parker picked up the ball
after he had been fouled and im
mediately flipped it to Bill
Meyer, who slammed it into the
corner of the net to settle the
issue.
Friday, USC beat Cal, 7-6, at
Berkeley. Cal edged Stanford
(sans Sheerer) one week ago,
10-9. The Indians' win over the
Trojans leaves no undefeated
teams in the race for the na
tional championship.
Palmely, Sheerer Score 3
Gary Sheerer and Mark Par
mely led the scoring attack for
the Indians. Parmely score three
goals. Sheerer tossed three assist
passes and scored three times,
playing with his foot taped from
an injury that kept him out for
two weeks.
Goalie Mike Sorem made 18
saves against the hard-shooting
Trojans. Sorem, Indian team cap
tain, thwarted eight attempts by
USC's All-American and Olympic
veteran Roy Saari.
USC broke the ice early in
the game when Saari scored
on a searing sweep shot. John
Parker returned the favor
promptly, firing a 10 yard shot
past USC goalie Mike Sullivan.
Sullivan made 14 saves in the
game.
Mark Parmely scored twice to
give the Cards a 3-1 lead at one
point in the quarter. Trojan Ed
Webb tallied to make the score
3-2 at the end of the period.

Saari and JC All-American Bill
Johnson each scored in the sec
ond period. Greg Buckingham
scored the only goal for the In
dians, leaving the game dead
locked, 4-4 at halftime.
USC moved ahead in the third
quarter with a three goal spree,
spiced by Olympian Dean Wille
ford. Buckingham scored his sec-

ond of the day for Stanford, and
Sheerer passed the Trojan goalie
with a lob shot.
Southern Cal widened its one
goal lead to 8-6 early in the
fourth period of Saari's third
goal.
Parker and Parmely made up
the difference, however. The gun
left the score 8-8.

In a tie game, two 5-minute
overtime quarters settle the
score, followed if necessary by
the sudden death period.
Saari scored from the hole
early in the first overtime to
put Stanford down one. Sheerer
then left the Trogoalie flatfooted
on an express-train backhand
blast.

Stanford was hardly out of
the woods, however, as Saari
threw in his fifth goal of thf
day.
Down one goal in tho second 5-
minute overtime period, the lot
fell again to Sheerer to even
the score. Pete Siebert, who was
delegated the unenviable task
of guarding Saari, kept the big
Trojan out of dangerous terri
tory.
Fouls Begin To Hurt
Both squads began to feel the
bite of the four foul limit by the
time the sudden death period
strated. USC had lost eight men
and Stanford six.
Two minutes into the sudder.
death period, 40 minutes after
the game started, Meyer took
Parker's quick flip and fired
the winning goal.
Stanford had a bad day in
the shooting department, miss
ing a large number of shot that
ordinarily would have made
marks on the scoreboard. The
Indians shot 28 per cent, while
In earlier games the Cards have
scored as high as 81 per cent of
their attempts.
Meet UCLA Next
Stanford meets last year's
NCAA champion UCLA this Fri
day. The Bruins wailed to an un
defeated season last year, beat
ing Stanford 7-6 and 6-3. USC
will have the chance to avenge
their overtime loss to the In
dians two weeks from now In
Troy's pool.
Stanford had no trouble with
Foothill. Stanford coach Jim
Gaughran substituted entire
teams at the end of each quar
ter. Parker led the Cards with
three goals. Sheerer scored once
and had two assists. Doug Jen
sen, Pete Ready, Parmely, Meyer
and Nicolao also scored one
goal.
The Papoose poloists re
bounded from a rocky 0-3 first
weekend to take two in a row
last weekend.

Sheerer, just returning to action after an ankle In
jury, scored three times and threw three assist
passes. Stanford won the Encina pool thriller 11-10
on a triple overtime, sudden death goal by Bill
Meyer.
