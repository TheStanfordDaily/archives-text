USC football fans were both
shocked and delighted Saturday
by the appearance of two white
chargers. The first, a Stanford
fraud, carried a woman dressed
as a Trojan warrior with an axe
In her back, symbolic of an In
dian massacre.
The second horse brought hy
sterical salutes from Trojan fans
when it reared up after a gallop
around the field. This horse car
ried the real white knight.
