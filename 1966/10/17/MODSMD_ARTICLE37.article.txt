## Business Students Defend Current Goals 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
As students in the Graduate
School of Business we read
Robert Hass's rather intempe
rate letter in Friday's Daily
with a good deal of interest.
Mr. Hass stated that "The
Business School ideology is sim
ple: MORE. But the young peo
ple on campus don't want more,
they want better, and the sys
tem can't hear thern." Since he
also mentioned that he was un
aware of Dean Arbuckle saying
anything on that subject, we
thought that Mr. Haas might be
interested In one of Mr. Ar
buckle's public statements:
". . . Apparently, business has
yet to communicate its full po
tential—at least to these young
men — because in my opinion
there is no greater opportunity
for the creative and innovative
person, and he is essential to
assure the viability of American
enterprise.
"Roger Blough, aware that
business needs young intellec
tuals today more than ever be
fore, has posed these searching
questions: 'Does business have
a realistic offer to make to the
intellectual? Does it have a de
sired place for him? Does it of
fer a worthwhile choice? Can it
provide meaningful work? Will
it require him to stretch his na
tive capacity to the utmost?
May he comment, criticize, and
dissent in the environment of
business, and can he induce con
structive change?'
"Business must answer these
questions affirmatively if it is to
attract outstanding future
executives. They want the as
surance of important, meaning
ful work, with opportunities for
the employment of their special
aptitudes and skills. They want
responsibility, challenge, adven
ture, and the ability to maintain
their individuality and integrity
within the corporate environ
ment. They want the freedom to
continue to grow and develop
through continuing education.
And the assurance can come
only from business.
"We in universities also have
a responsibility here. We must
combine the intellectual and
pragmatic values in a rigorous
curriculum and develop atti
tudes which emphasize leader
ship as indispensable to a dy
namic society."
Our point here is not just that
Dean Arbuckle has shown con
cern about the problem Mr.
Haas brought up. The fact is
that you could probably fill up
this paper for the rest of the
year with quotes from Arbuckle
and innumerable other business
leaders on this particular prob
lem or on the larger question
of Mr. Hass implies—the social
responsibility of business. This
is because concern with matters
other than "an ever greater
Gross National Product" is a
major trend in the thinking of
today's business leaders, a trend
Mr. Hass could have discovered
with very little effort.
Unfortunately Mr. Hass is not
alone in his misunderstanding
of contemporary business. There
are certainly many other people
on this campus alone who, hav
ing an idea of what business
was like in the Nineteenth Cen
tury, a distaste for the excesses
of some modern advertising,

and a vague suspicion that any
have base motives, are also
bogged down with the same mis
conceptions.
We doubt that this hastily
written letter will clear up even
a few of those misconceptions
but we do hope that it has
pointed out the gross inaccu
racy of Robert Hass' description
of the "Business School ideolo
gy" and will encourage some of
the other critics in this univer
sity to at least take a quick look
at what is actually going on in
the business community before
rejecting "the system" out of
hand.

• Vile Dreams?
Editor, The Daily:
I noted with disgust the letter
to the editor of Oct. 14 by Rob
ert Hass, in which he reflected
the prevalent anti-business atti
tude of contemporary America.
I hope Mr. Hass does not pride
himself on his originality, be
cause business and businessmen
have been villified, criticized
and ridiculed for a great many
years.
In regard to the aspersions
cast upon Dean Arbuckle of the
Graduate Business School, such
comments were unwarranted,
uncalled for, and totally irre
sponsible. The Daily recently
ran an article describing Dean
Arbuckle's tremendous contri
bution to the growth of the
Stanford Business School; the
Dean may justifiably stand
proudly by that record.
Since Mr. Hass is unable or

unwilling to understand what
the "technocrats and public re
lations whores" are going to
contribute to American society,
I will gladly enlighten him.
These men will be engaged in
the production of wealth, of un
told wealth; wealth which Mr.
Hass most unfraciously accepts
the products of every day of his
life. Mr. Hass is extremely mis
taken If he believes that prod
ucts and services are spontane
ously generated, or that they
come from the ground. They are
the result of men, living and
dead, who sweated and strug
gled, and sometimes died, try
ing to achieve the pot of gold
at the end of their particular
dream. If a man denies these
men, or their successors, their
right to a profit, then he Is ad
vocating robbery, the stealing
of the products of a man's la
bor without recompense. May I
remind Mr. Hass that Leland
Stanford, founder of this Uni
versity, was a railroad magnate.
Finally, in answer to Mr.
Hass's statement that "students
are not pleased at the prospect
of devoting their talents and
energies to business", I think
those students know better
what they want than Mr. Hass
does.

• Linguist Or Lingo
Editor, The Dally:
As an English Teaching As
sistant, Mr. Hass has amply
demonstrated his command of
the finer points of modern lan
guage with expressions such as
"public relations whores" and
"nauseating drivel" in referring
to the Daily's editorial on the
Business School. However his
stereotyped arguments and syl

one with a differing political or
social philosophy must also
the myopic logic of the Middle
Ages.
I wonder, Mr. Hass, whether
in the fine English tradition of
impartial inquiry you have dis
cussed with students, faculty
and administrators the respon
sibility the Business School feels
toward the social and moral is
sues of today's business world?
I wonder if you have attended
conferences and seminars where
today's students have demanded
explanations from businessmen
of the values they hold in our
business system? I wonder if
you have discussed with busi
ness students the responsibility
that they feel toward the moral
issues of the day? Finally, I
wonder why YOU have not ac
cepted the responsibility to of
fer well-reasoned, constructive
criticism in place of rather un
informed insinuations?
Your comments suggest ig
norance, Mr. Hass. I can only
conclude that the REAL pur
pose of your remarkable piece
of journalistic prose was the
realization of the fondest ambi
tion of a graduate English stu
dent—to publish.

• Exit—Us
Editor, The Daily:
"Man have we got a rotten
football team. They don't score
half as much as they should."
Of course, our outstanding
school spirit really helps our
team a lot. We urge our team
on every five minutes with a
really original, two word cheer
(best characterized as smut),
and then we gripe when no one
ends up in the end zone. Under
the Inspired leadership of our

ing the last minutes of the game
this weekend, our yell leaders
asked us to respect their "better
judgment" and remain in the
stands for the Stanford Alma
Mater. A 6 our student body de
serted the stands during the
playing of the Alma Mater, USC
yelled to us a question which
each of us in turn, should ask
himself: "Stanford—Why Are
You Leaving?"

• Educational Equality
Editor, The Dally:
In all matters involving com
plex human relations, such as
the current student drive for
"equality" in the university
community, one must begin by
being resolutely simple.
The basic facts, as I see them,
are as follows: there is a built
in asymmetry in the relation
between faculty and administra
tion on the one hand and the
students on the other since the
education which is our central
concern Involves a progression
from youthful attitudes to ma
ture ones. As the new generation
replaces the old, its respon
sibility and authority gradually
grows until it achieves "equali
ty" and eventually a command
ing position. Development so
cieties always insist that chil
dren and adolescents are in one
very important sense incom
plete beings—though in another
sense they may possess an abso
lute validity in their own terms,
just as some callings are higher
than others even though all
men are equal in dignity from a
logistic reasoning suggest that
he has not freed himself from

meaningful moral viewpoint. To
some extent, then, the attitude
of administration and faculty
must be paternal: this is clear
In the case of the "masters" of
the knowledge; the administra
tors likewise, theoretically,
know best how to organize the
living conditions on the campus.
Of course, there are good and
bad faculty and administrators.
This is a matter of normal ad
justment as obtains, for exam
ple, between any two humans,
i.e. a gentle pressuring of the
partner to live up to his end of
the relation. It is not a matter
of usurpation. This remains
true, though the pressure is in
creased, even in changing times
like ours in America.
The administration has in
trust the considerable plant and
the funds which, far beyond stu
dent fees, make the university
educational process possible.
During the apprenticeship, the
student is provided for in this
sense; even the part of expenses
that comes from fees is apt to
yell "leaders", we really "rip
them" apart in the stands. Dur
be paid by parents for whom to

uome extent the administration
substitutes: In loco pai-entlt* Is
not an altogether empty phrase
Mr. Harris and his followers
would have to go far beyond the
contemplated co-op dorms to
achieve real equality or inde
pendence on these ground*
alone.
A further factor of asymme
try lies in the fact that the fac
ulty and administration are a
relatively permanent element In
the community, whereas the
students are here for a fairly
short time.
I, for one, do not regret the
recent ferment: it is a sign 6f
life and concern; up to a point
it is formative. There has al
ways been something like it on
campuses, at least in my experi
ence. But by now the formulas
have been repeated too often fri
the local campaign; they have
become sterile and boring. Some
of the accusations, and even out
right insults, smack of provoca
tion. To which the most con
structive response, as usual, Is" a
strong dose of the truth.
ROBERT G. CORN!
