ONCE MOKE UNTO THE UK EACH
Way back in 1953 I started writing this column about
campus life. Today, a full 13 years later, I am still writing
this column, for my interest in undergraduates is as keen
and lively as ever. This is called "arrested development!'
But where else can a writer find a subject as fascinating
as the American campus? Where else are minds so nettled,
bodies so roiled, psyches so unglued?
Right now, for example, though the new school year has
just begun, you've already encountered the following dis
asters :
1. You hate your teachers.
2. You hate your courses.
3. You hate your room-mates.
4. You have no time to study.
5. You have no place to study.
Friends, let us, without despair, examine your problems
one by one.
1. You hatr your teachers. For shame, friends! Try
looking at things their way. Take your English teacher,
for instance. Here's a man who is one of the world's
authorities on Robert Browning, yet he wears $30 tweeds
and a pre-war necktie while his brother Sam, a high school
dropout, earns 70 thou a year in aluminum siding. Is it so
hard to understand why he writes "F" on top of your
themes and "Eeeyich!" in the margin? Instead of hating
him, should you not admire his dedication to scholarship,
his disdain for the blandishments of commerce? Of course
you should. You may flunk, but Pippa passes.
2. You hate your courses. You say, for example, that
you don't see the use of studying Macbeth when you are
majoring in veterinary medicine. You're wrong, friends.
Believe me, some day when you are running a busy kennel,
you'll be mighty glad you learned "Out, damned Spot!"
3. You hate your room-mates. This is, unquestionably,
a big problem—in fact, the second biggest problem on
American campuses. (The first biggest, of course, is on
which side of your mortar board do you dangle the tassel
at Commencement?) But there is an answer to the room
mate problem: keep changing room-mates. The optimum
interval, I have found, is every four hours.
4. You have no time to study. Friends, I'm glad to re
port there is a simple way to find extra time in your busy
schedule. All you have to do is buy some Personna Super
Stainless Steel Blades. Then you won't be wasting pre
cious hours hacking away with inferior blades, mangling
your face again and again in a tedious, feckless effort to
winnow your whiskers. Personna shaves you quickly and
slickly, easily and breezily, hacklessly, scrapelessly, tug
lessly, nicklessly, scratchlessly, matchlessly. Furthermore,
Personna Blades last and last. Moreover, they are avail
able both in double-edge and Injector style. And, as if this
weren't enough, Personna is now offering you a chance to
grab a fistful of $100 bills. The Personna Super Stainless
Steel Sweepstakes is off and running! You can win $10,000
and even more. Get over to your Personna dealer for de
tails and an entry blank. Don't just stand there!
5. You have no place to study. This is a thorny one, I'll
admit, what with the library so jammed and the dorms so
noisy. But with a little ingenuity, you can still find a quiet,
deserted spot—like the ticket office of the lacrosse team.
Or a testimonial dinner for the dean. Or the nearest re
cruiting station.

You see. friends? When you've got a problem, don't lie
down and quit. Attack! Remember: America did not be
come the world's greatest producer of milk solids and
sorghum by running away from a fight!

Steel Sweepstakes is off and running! You can win $10,000
and even more. Get over to your Personna dealer for de
tails and an entry blank. Don't just stand there!
5. You have no place to study. This is a thorny one, I'll
admit, what with the library so jammed and the dorms so
noisy. But with a little ingenuity, you can still find a quiet,
deserted spot—like the ticket office of the lacrosse team.
Or a testimonial dinner for the dean. Or the nearest re
cruiting station.

You see. friends? When you've got a problem, don't lie
down and quit. Attack! Remember: America did not be
come the world's greatest producer of milk solids and
sorghum by running away from a fight!

ONCE MOKE UNTO THE UK EACH
Way back in 1953 I started writing this column about
campus life. Today, a full 13 years later, I am still writing
this column, for my interest in undergraduates is as keen
and lively as ever. This is called "arrested development!'
But where else can a writer find a subject as fascinating
as the American campus? Where else are minds so nettled,
bodies so roiled, psyches so unglued?
Right now, for example, though the new school year has
just begun, you've already encountered the following dis
asters :
1. You hate your teachers.
2. You hate your courses.
3. You hate your room-mates.
4. You have no time to study.
5. You have no place to study.
Friends, let us, without despair, examine your problems
one by one.
1. You hatr your teachers. For shame, friends! Try
looking at things their way. Take your English teacher,
for instance. Here's a man who is one of the world's
authorities on Robert Browning, yet he wears $30 tweeds
and a pre-war necktie while his brother Sam, a high school
dropout, earns 70 thou a year in aluminum siding. Is it so
hard to understand why he writes "F" on top of your
themes and "Eeeyich!" in the margin? Instead of hating
him, should you not admire his dedication to scholarship,
his disdain for the blandishments of commerce? Of course
you should. You may flunk, but Pippa passes.
2. You hate your courses. You say, for example, that
you don't see the use of studying Macbeth when you are
majoring in veterinary medicine. You're wrong, friends.
Believe me, some day when you are running a busy kennel,
you'll be mighty glad you learned "Out, damned Spot!"
3. You hate your room-mates. This is, unquestionably,
a big problem—in fact, the second biggest problem on
American campuses. (The first biggest, of course, is on
which side of your mortar board do you dangle the tassel
at Commencement?) But there is an answer to the room
mate problem: keep changing room-mates. The optimum
interval, I have found, is every four hours.
4. You have no time to study. Friends, I'm glad to re
port there is a simple way to find extra time in your busy
schedule. All you have to do is buy some Personna Super
Stainless Steel Blades. Then you won't be wasting pre
cious hours hacking away with inferior blades, mangling
your face again and again in a tedious, feckless effort to
winnow your whiskers. Personna shaves you quickly and
slickly, easily and breezily, hacklessly, scrapelessly, tug
lessly, nicklessly, scratchlessly, matchlessly. Furthermore,
Personna Blades last and last. Moreover, they are avail
able both in double-edge and Injector style. And, as if this
weren't enough, Personna is now offering you a chance to
grab a fistful of $100 bills. The Personna Super Stainless
Steel Sweepstakes is off and running! You can win $10,000
and even more. Get over to your Personna dealer for de

American campuses. (The first biggest, of course, is on
which side of your mortar board do you dangle the tassel
at Commencement?) But there is an answer to the room
mate problem: keep changing room-mates. The optimum
interval, I have found, is every four hours.
4. You have no time to study. Friends, I'm glad to re
port there is a simple way to find extra time in your busy
schedule. All you have to do is buy some Personna Super
Stainless Steel Blades. Then you won't be wasting pre
cious hours hacking away with inferior blades, mangling
your face again and again in a tedious, feckless effort to
winnow your whiskers. Personna shaves you quickly and
slickly, easily and breezily, hacklessly, scrapelessly, tug
lessly, nicklessly, scratchlessly, matchlessly. Furthermore,
Personna Blades last and last. Moreover, they are avail
able both in double-edge and Injector style. And, as if this
weren't enough, Personna is now offering you a chance to
grab a fistful of $100 bills. The Personna Super Stainless
Steel Sweepstakes is off and running! You can win $10,000
and even more. Get over to your Personna dealer for de
tails and an entry blank. Don't just stand there!
5. You have no place to study. This is a thorny one, I'll
admit, what with the library so jammed and the dorms so
noisy. But with a little ingenuity, you can still find a quiet,
deserted spot—like the ticket office of the lacrosse team.
Or a testimonial dinner for the dean. Or the nearest re
cruiting station.

You see. friends? When you've got a problem, don't lie
down and quit. Attack! Remember: America did not be
come the world's greatest producer of milk solids and
sorghum by running away from a fight!
