# 'The Church Is For The World At Large'; Hans KÃ¼ng Sees A Need For Universality
## 
### KIRK HANSON Managing Editor 
"By its very nature, a Church is
there for the whole world," Hans
Kung Friday night told a crowd of al
most eighteen hudred that filled Me
morial Church to hear of "The Church
and Catholicity."
Father Kung spoke in the fined lec
ture of the Raymond Fred West Series
which he entitled "Whither the
Church?" The series attracted crowds
of thirteen hundred to two thousand.
The second and their were moved to
Memorial Church after Dinkelspiel
Auditorium proved too small.
Kung told the audience that the
Church is not "simply the faith of
Abraham" or the "covenant of Moses,"
but "it was to be Jew for the Jew and
Greek for the Greek. It was to be all
things to all men."
He emphasized that spatial extent,
numerical quantity, cultural variety,
and historical continuity alone could

not make a church catholic with a
small "c." "Any kind of limitation is
a sign of uncatholicity. If the Church
is universial, then it is called not to
deny conflicts and differences, but to
transcend them."
Protestant Churches
Speaking of the Potestant
Churches, Father Kung said, "Each
of the churches is a fully-developed,
full-grown daughter of the CathoV
Church." He said he was not "claim
ing more truth for the mother or the
daughters. Other churches have real
ized the truth of the Bible much better
than we have."
"It is unhistorical to think of the
possibility of full-grown daughters re
turning to their mother's womb," said
Father Kung. He pointedly asked why
the daughter churches "fear nothing
so much as coming back under the
wing of the mother."
"All the daughters are united and
all consider the mother as old and
crippled." He asked why "that Old

Church was so curiously jealous of
her daughters." In hope, he said,
"There is one thing this old mother
cannot deny, that these daughters so
unlike one another and unlike her are
really her daughters and like her."
Sin Of Excess
Father Kung indicated the Catholic
Church for a "sin of excess" and the
Protestant Church for a "sin of short
coming" in developing the catholicity
that the church needs.
At the conclusion of his lecture
Hans Kung was given a standing ova
tion by the crowd. He then answered
several questions from the floor.
Asked what is the place of the
Church if even atheists can be saved,
he said, "The Church is the vanguard
of humanity who knows what is the
whole reality of the relation between
God and humanty."
On the papacy he said: "The word
infallible is misunderstood. Dogmas of
the church are always piecemeal, som
ber, fragmentary." In an earlier lec

ture he had said that the dogmas, as
defined, were meant to be particularly
relevant to a particular time.
Papal Absolutism
He also stated that "what never
will be accepted by all is the central
ized system by which one ran rules
the whole Church in an absolutist
way. But this is not essential to
earlier Christianity."
Michael Novak, who introduced
Father Kung for the final lecture,
closed the evening with a story of a
Greek Orthodox Bishop who, having
heard Hans Kung deliver a lecture at
Boston College on his first trip to the
United States in 1963, remarked to
Cardinal Cushing: "I am glad he is in
your Church."
Saturday morning Father Kung left
Stanford for Kansas City where he
spoke this weekend. In the next three
weeks he will lecture at Northwestern,
Michigan, Pennsylvania, Boston Col
lege, Fordham, Santa Barbara, USLA,
and Hawaii.

Greek Orthodox Bishop who, having
heard Hans Kung deliver a lecture at
Boston College on his first trip to the
United States in 1963, remarked to
Cardinal Cushing: "I am glad he is in
your Church."
Saturday morning Father Kung left
Stanford for Kansas City where he
spoke this weekend. In the next three
weeks he will lecture at Northwestern,
Michigan, Pennsylvania, Boston Col
lege, Fordham, Santa Barbara, USLA,
and Hawaii.
"By its very nature, a Church is
there for the whole world," Hans
Kung Friday night told a crowd of al
most eighteen hudred that filled Me
morial Church to hear of "The Church
and Catholicity."
Father Kung spoke in the fined lec
ture of the Raymond Fred West Series
which he entitled "Whither the
Church?" The series attracted crowds
of thirteen hundred to two thousand.
The second and their were moved to
Memorial Church after Dinkelspiel
Auditorium proved too small.
Kung told the audience that the
Church is not "simply the faith of
Abraham" or the "covenant of Moses,"
but "it was to be Jew for the Jew and
Greek for the Greek. It was to be all
things to all men."
He emphasized that spatial extent,
numerical quantity, cultural variety,
and historical continuity alone could

not make a church catholic with a
small "c." "Any kind of limitation is
a sign of uncatholicity. If the Church
is universial, then it is called not to
deny conflicts and differences, but to
transcend them."
Protestant Churches
Speaking of the Potestant
Churches, Father Kung said, "Each
of the churches is a fully-developed,
full-grown daughter of the CathoV
Church." He said he was not "claim
ing more truth for the mother or the
daughters. Other churches have real
ized the truth of the Bible much better
than we have."
"It is unhistorical to think of the
possibility of full-grown daughters re
turning to their mother's womb," said
Father Kung. He pointedly asked why
the daughter churches "fear nothing
so much as coming back under the
wing of the mother."
"All the daughters are united and
all consider the mother as old and
crippled." He asked why "that Old

Church was so curiously jealous of
her daughters." In hope, he said,
"There is one thing this old mother
cannot deny, that these daughters so
unlike one another and unlike her are
really her daughters and like her."
Sin Of Excess
Father Kung indicated the Catholic
Church for a "sin of excess" and the
Protestant Church for a "sin of short
coming" in developing the catholicity
that the church needs.
At the conclusion of his lecture
Hans Kung was given a standing ova
tion by the crowd. He then answered
several questions from the floor.
Asked what is the place of the
Church if even atheists can be saved,
he said, "The Church is the vanguard
of humanity who knows what is the
whole reality of the relation between
God and humanty."
On the papacy he said: "The word
infallible is misunderstood. Dogmas of
the church are always piecemeal, som
ber, fragmentary." In an earlier lec

ture he had said that the dogmas, as
defined, were meant to be particularly
relevant to a particular time.
Papal Absolutism
He also stated that "what never
will be accepted by all is the central
ized system by which one ran rules
the whole Church in an absolutist
way. But this is not essential to
earlier Christianity."
Michael Novak, who introduced
Father Kung for the final lecture,
closed the evening with a story of a
Greek Orthodox Bishop who, having
heard Hans Kung deliver a lecture at
Boston College on his first trip to the
United States in 1963, remarked to
Cardinal Cushing: "I am glad he is in
