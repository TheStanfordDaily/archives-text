# Harris And Legislature
## 
### 
Student government, like most representative
governments, enjoys a series of checks and
balances which assure that no single branch,
even in good faith, will wield excessive power.
Thursday night Student Body President David
Harris challenged the independence of Legis
lature when he told Legislature that he viewed
the Committee of Fifteen nominations as "a
vote of confidence," and again when he in
formed the body that he would resubmit the
name of the unconfirmed nominee at the next
session.
According to ASSU by-laws, the student body
president must present his slate of Committee of
Fifteen nominations to the Legislature for con
firmation. Exercising due responsibility the Leg
islature required each nominee to appear at
Thursday's meeting for a brief interpellation
prior to a vote on confirmation.
In his formal report to Legislature, Harris
told the body that if he were forced to "play
politics" in the University, "I want to be able
to chose my own team." Yet Harris raised some
doubts about his team, when he told the legis
lators he was not completely familiar with the

views of the candidates. Legislature clearly did
not ask for Gallup-Poll composition of the Com
mittee, but it was apparent that the panel of
five nominees, who were "not representative
but cognizant" of each segment of the student
body, did not fully satsify Legislature.
The Legislature refused to yield to the pres
sure tactics contained in Harris' attachement of
"confidence" to the issue. After prolonged de
bate four of Harris' nominees, including him
self, were confirmed.
Nevertheless Legislature's action was not a
vote of no-confidence for the Harris administra
tion. But the body did crisply remind Harris
that the team which is sent to the Committee
of Fifteen is not his team but the student body's
team. We trust that Harris will heed the realities
of the situation and submit the name of a fifth
nominee who is acceptable to Legislature.
Persistence on Harris' part to oppose the
legally constituted and expressed desires of Leg
islature can only lead to rancor in the chamber,
which Harris has condemned, and further delay
in the stabilization of the Committee of Fifteen.

but cognizant" of each segment of the student
body, did not fully satsify Legislature.
The Legislature refused to yield to the pres
sure tactics contained in Harris' attachement of
"confidence" to the issue. After prolonged de
bate four of Harris' nominees, including him
self, were confirmed.
Nevertheless Legislature's action was not a
vote of no-confidence for the Harris administra
tion. But the body did crisply remind Harris
that the team which is sent to the Committee
of Fifteen is not his team but the student body's
team. We trust that Harris will heed the realities
of the situation and submit the name of a fifth
nominee who is acceptable to Legislature.
Persistence on Harris' part to oppose the
legally constituted and expressed desires of Leg
islature can only lead to rancor in the chamber,
which Harris has condemned, and further delay
in the stabilization of the Committee of Fifteen.
