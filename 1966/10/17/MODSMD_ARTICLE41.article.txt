## Appointment Causes Dispute Disrupts C15, LASSU Actions 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Dave Harris at various
times has stated his desire to
avoid political infighting in stu
dent government while attempt
ing to implement the various
programs in his administrative
platform.
It seems, however, that his
attempts to railroad two of his
personal nominees for appoint
ment to the Committee of Fif
teen through a legislature hold
ing valid objections, is more
than political infighting.
Mr. Harris would like, natu
rally, to have a cohesive stu
dent unit on the committee, but
to push upon the representa
tives of the ASSU—a second
time — a person, Miss Jan
Hanke, whose nomination was
decisively rejected, is being
obtuse.
Miss Handke admitted to the
legislature that she believes
there are other females on cam
pus just as capable, and per
haps more representative of stu
dent views, than is she.
Mr. Harris is either very stub
born, or his knowledge of Stan
ford women is extremely lim
ited. To say that he will re
nominate Miss Handke, and im
ply multiples in the instance of
rejection, is absurd. Not only
will it risrupt the legislature
and the Committee of Fifteen,
but in so doing will slow down
his own programs affecting the
entire studentb ody.
I suggest, Mr. Harris, that
you evaluate carefully the pos
sibility of submitting a more
acceptable nomination to
LASSU. There are wiser and
more useful things to accom
plish than to antagonize the
legislature.

Editor, The Dally:
Not all of Dave Harris' ap
pointments were confirmed at
last Thursday's LASSU meet
ing. While Forstenzer, Gerry,
and Despres were accepted, Jan
Handke was not. She was tem
porarily approved later, but
only so that the student body
would have full representation
on the Committee of Fifteen
until a different appointee is
confirmed.
Equitable representation was
the issue at stake. Harris' nomi
nees were generally homoge
nous in political outlook, and
many members of the legisla
ture felt that Harris should in
clude more diversity. It was
evident that a significant num
ber of representatives held this
opinion; the votes on both De
pres and Handke were close.
Harris recognized that his ap
pointees were not a "Gallup
Poll" representation of student
opinion, but he felt that they
were all qualified to serve since
they were aware of the differ
ing campus attitudes. But there
are many "aware" persons at
Stanford; why couldn't Dave
propose just one more conge
nial nominee. The reps who
voted down Miss Handke
weren't uncompromising; both
Gerry and Forstenzer were ap
proved unanimously.
Tim Haight suggested that a
split in the student ranks would
make the administration more
obstinate, and that, therefore,
the appointments should be ap
proved without objection. But I
ask Mr. Haight if he would dis
own Vietnam dissent, since it so
obviously encourages Hanoi.
Harris often speaks about the
"administrative mind." It has

such undesirable characteristics
as block voting on committees
and the subordination of indi
vidualism to "administrative
policy." But is Dave a hypo
crite? Why are the opinions of
his appointees so uniform, and
will this create a "student
block" on the Committee of Fif
teen? Why does he exclude an
informed, but differing voice
from committee debate? Have
the demands of Harris' educa
tional policies shaped a "stu
dent mind?"

Editor, The Daily:
I would like to know how the
DAILY found out that Bob
Beyers beat me, 9-7, in a set of
tennis on his birthday. Did the
News Service volunteer this in
formation, surrender it without
protest, or release it only upon
threat of subpoena? To have
the score revealed is quite hu
miliating, especially in view of
the opposition. I hope that what
actually happened is apparent
to everyone: the set was really
a gift appropriate to the occa
sion.

deemed himself on the tennis

Editor, The Daily:
I would like to know how the
DAILY found out that Bob
Beyers beat me, 9-7, in a set of
tennis on his birthday. Did the
News Service volunteer this in
formation, surrender it without
protest, or release it only upon
threat of subpoena? To have
the score revealed is quite hu
miliating, especially in view of
the opposition. I hope that what
actually happened is apparent
to everyone: the set was really
a gift appropriate to the occa
sion.
ANDREW M. DOTY
Editor's note: The omniscient
Daily understands Doty cele
brated his 41st birthday Wednes
day by beating: his former boss,
Lyle Nelson, by 10 strokes on
the front nine of the Stanford
golf course. Thursday he de
deemed himself on the tennis
courts with a 6-3, 7-5 victory
over the aging Beyers. Informed
and reliable sources said he
mig-ht recover from his athletic
escapades and return to work
sometime next week, but this
could not be confirmed.
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Dave Harris at various
times has stated his desire to
avoid political infighting in stu
dent government while attempt
ing to implement the various
programs in his administrative
platform.
It seems, however, that his
attempts to railroad two of his
personal nominees for appoint
ment to the Committee of Fif
teen through a legislature hold
ing valid objections, is more
than political infighting.
Mr. Harris would like, natu
rally, to have a cohesive stu
dent unit on the committee, but
to push upon the representa
tives of the ASSU—a second
time — a person, Miss Jan
Hanke, whose nomination was
decisively rejected, is being
obtuse.
Miss Handke admitted to the
legislature that she believes
there are other females on cam
pus just as capable, and per
haps more representative of stu
dent views, than is she.
Mr. Harris is either very stub
born, or his knowledge of Stan
ford women is extremely lim
ited. To say that he will re
nominate Miss Handke, and im
ply multiples in the instance of
rejection, is absurd. Not only
will it risrupt the legislature
and the Committee of Fifteen,
but in so doing will slow down
his own programs affecting the
entire studentb ody.
I suggest, Mr. Harris, that
you evaluate carefully the pos
sibility of submitting a more
acceptable nomination to
LASSU. There are wiser and
more useful things to accom
plish than to antagonize the
legislature.

Editor, The Dally:
Not all of Dave Harris' ap
pointments were confirmed at
last Thursday's LASSU meet
ing. While Forstenzer, Gerry,
and Despres were accepted, Jan
Handke was not. She was tem
porarily approved later, but
only so that the student body
would have full representation
on the Committee of Fifteen
until a different appointee is
confirmed.
Equitable representation was
the issue at stake. Harris' nomi
nees were generally homoge
nous in political outlook, and
many members of the legisla
ture felt that Harris should in
clude more diversity. It was
evident that a significant num
ber of representatives held this
opinion; the votes on both De
pres and Handke were close.
Harris recognized that his ap
pointees were not a "Gallup
Poll" representation of student
opinion, but he felt that they
were all qualified to serve since
they were aware of the differ
ing campus attitudes. But there
are many "aware" persons at
Stanford; why couldn't Dave
propose just one more conge
nial nominee. The reps who
voted down Miss Handke
weren't uncompromising; both
Gerry and Forstenzer were ap
proved unanimously.
Tim Haight suggested that a
split in the student ranks would
make the administration more
obstinate, and that, therefore,
the appointments should be ap
proved without objection. But I
ask Mr. Haight if he would dis
own Vietnam dissent, since it so
obviously encourages Hanoi.
Harris often speaks about the
"administrative mind." It has

such undesirable characteristics
as block voting on committees
and the subordination of indi
vidualism to "administrative
policy." But is Dave a hypo
crite? Why are the opinions of
his appointees so uniform, and
will this create a "student
block" on the Committee of Fif
teen? Why does he exclude an
informed, but differing voice
from committee debate? Have
the demands of Harris' educa
tional policies shaped a "stu
dent mind?"

Stanford; why couldn't Dave
propose just one more conge
nial nominee. The reps who
voted down Miss Handke
weren't uncompromising; both
Gerry and Forstenzer were ap
proved unanimously.
Tim Haight suggested that a
split in the student ranks would
make the administration more
obstinate, and that, therefore,
the appointments should be ap
proved without objection. But I
ask Mr. Haight if he would dis
own Vietnam dissent, since it so
obviously encourages Hanoi.
Harris often speaks about the
"administrative mind." It has

such undesirable characteristics
as block voting on committees
and the subordination of indi
vidualism to "administrative
policy." But is Dave a hypo
crite? Why are the opinions of
his appointees so uniform, and
will this create a "student
block" on the Committee of Fif
teen? Why does he exclude an
informed, but differing voice
from committee debate? Have
the demands of Harris' educa
tional policies shaped a "stu
dent mind?"

Editor, The Daily:
I would like to know how the
DAILY found out that Bob
Beyers beat me, 9-7, in a set of
tennis on his birthday. Did the
News Service volunteer this in
formation, surrender it without
protest, or release it only upon
threat of subpoena? To have
the score revealed is quite hu
miliating, especially in view of
the opposition. I hope that what
actually happened is apparent
to everyone: the set was really
a gift appropriate to the occa
sion.
ANDREW M. DOTY
Editor's note: The omniscient
Daily understands Doty cele
brated his 41st birthday Wednes
day by beating: his former boss,
Lyle Nelson, by 10 strokes on
the front nine of the Stanford
golf course. Thursday he de
deemed himself on the tennis
courts with a 6-3, 7-5 victory
over the aging Beyers. Informed
and reliable sources said he
mig-ht recover from his athletic
escapades and return to work
sometime next week, but this
could not be confirmed.
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Dave Harris at various
times has stated his desire to
avoid political infighting in stu
dent government while attempt
ing to implement the various
programs in his administrative
platform.
It seems, however, that his
attempts to railroad two of his
personal nominees for appoint
ment to the Committee of Fif
teen through a legislature hold
ing valid objections, is more
than political infighting.
Mr. Harris would like, natu
rally, to have a cohesive stu
dent unit on the committee, but
to push upon the representa
tives of the ASSU—a second
time — a person, Miss Jan
Hanke, whose nomination was
decisively rejected, is being
obtuse.
Miss Handke admitted to the
legislature that she believes
there are other females on cam
pus just as capable, and per
haps more representative of stu
dent views, than is she.
Mr. Harris is either very stub
born, or his knowledge of Stan
ford women is extremely lim
ited. To say that he will re
nominate Miss Handke, and im
ply multiples in the instance of
rejection, is absurd. Not only
will it risrupt the legislature
and the Committee of Fifteen,
but in so doing will slow down
his own programs affecting the
entire studentb ody.
I suggest, Mr. Harris, that
you evaluate carefully the pos
sibility of submitting a more
acceptable nomination to
LASSU. There are wiser and
more useful things to accom
plish than to antagonize the
legislature.

Editor, The Dally:
Not all of Dave Harris' ap
pointments were confirmed at
last Thursday's LASSU meet
ing. While Forstenzer, Gerry,
and Despres were accepted, Jan
Handke was not. She was tem
porarily approved later, but
only so that the student body
would have full representation
on the Committee of Fifteen
until a different appointee is
confirmed.
Equitable representation was
the issue at stake. Harris' nomi
nees were generally homoge
nous in political outlook, and
many members of the legisla
ture felt that Harris should in
clude more diversity. It was
evident that a significant num
ber of representatives held this
opinion; the votes on both De
pres and Handke were close.
Harris recognized that his ap
pointees were not a "Gallup
Poll" representation of student
opinion, but he felt that they
were all qualified to serve since
they were aware of the differ
ing campus attitudes. But there
are many "aware" persons at
Stanford; why couldn't Dave
propose just one more conge
