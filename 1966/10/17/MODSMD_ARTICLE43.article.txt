# The 						Immodest Proposal
## Board Needs More Planks: Student, Faculty Members 
### Steve Gruber 
If the Alumni Association
can have trustee representation,
why not the students and fac
ulty?
About twelve years ago, the
Alumni Association took their
case to the courts . . . and won.
The membership of the Board
of Trustees was expanded to in
clude three members to be se
lected by the Almuni Associa
tion.
By using the same arguments
employed by the alums, the stu
dent body could also gain seats
on the Board.
Increased Size
My immodest proposal is to
increase the number of trustees
from its present 23 members to
27 by adding two students and
two faculty members.
Ludicrous, you say?
The main arguments against
such a proposal would center
around the general inexperience
of the students. They wouldn't
know enough about the finan
cial and legal aspects of run
ning the University, the critics
say.
I contend that there is really
no reason for a trustee to know
more than the barest minimum
about finance and law. The Uni
versity has many good lawyers
and businessmen on its payroll
already. What is needed is a
trustee who knows what is go
ing on at the campus and has
the ability to look to the future.
Proximity
A student or faculty member
would fill both of these criteria
quite nicely. In fact, a student
might be much closer to the
University than any trustee who
lives in New York City (An
example would be trustee Roger
Lewis).
Proximity to the campus can
bring some of the pressing is
sues of education and student
life into much sharper focus.
The 1954 court order (Supe
rior Court of Santa Clara Coun
ty, number 14912, Department
6) allowing Alumni Association
representation, stated that the
number of trustees would be in
creased from 15 to 23, including
three Alumni Association mem
bers. Regular members would
still have ten year terms and
the Alumni trustees would have
five year terms, according to the
order.
Close Relationship
Two main arguments were
used by the Board of Trustees,
which had originally asked for
the court order, for the expan
sion. First, the workload had in
creased. Second, a closer rela
tionship was needed between
the Board and the University.
It wa6 felt that alumni mem

bers could more fully meet the
hopes of the grantors (Senator
and Mrs. Stanford).
But wouldn't a student or fac
ulty member bring the trustees
much closer to the University?
Most of the present trustees,
that is those who went to Stan
ford, graduated between 1915
and 1940. It is a much different
Stanford now.
Students could be used as ad
vistors to the Board. But they
could also be ignored. Only as
members would they have suffi
cient power to make their pres
ence felt.
I propose that the students
be elected to two year terms in
a general student body election
and that the faculty trustees be
elected by the Academic Coun
cil. Both elections would provide
representative trustees.
Adequate Time
Students would have enough
time to adequately fulfill the re
sponsibilities of a trustee. When
interviewed by a Daily reporter
last year, Richard E. Guggen
hime, President of the Board,
stated that he put in about one
and a half days a week in Board
activities. If the President only
works 12 hours per week for
the Board, then we can assume
that other members spend even
less time on the Board. Students
engaged in LASSU, The Daily,
and other campus activities,
spend much more time away
from their books. Time would
not hinder the effectiveness of a
student trustee.
The case for student trustees
is apparent. But it will take
another court order to get any
thing done. And this time it
probably will not have the back
ing of the Board of Trustees.

why not the students and fac
ulty?

case to the courts . . . and won.
The membership of the Board
of Trustees was expanded to in
clude three members to be se
lected by the Almuni Associa
tion.
By using the same arguments
employed by the alums, the stu
dent body could also gain seats
on the Board.
Increased Size
My immodest proposal is to
increase the number of trustees
from its present 23 members to
27 by adding two students and
two faculty members.
Ludicrous, you say?
The main arguments against
such a proposal would center
around the general inexperience
of the students. They wouldn't
know enough about the finan
cial and legal aspects of run
ning the University, the critics
say.
I contend that there is really
no reason for a trustee to know
more than the barest minimum
about finance and law. The Uni
versity has many good lawyers
and businessmen on its payroll
already. What is needed is a
trustee who knows what is go
ing on at the campus and has
the ability to look to the future.
Proximity
A student or faculty member
would fill both of these criteria
quite nicely. In fact, a student
might be much closer to the
University than any trustee who
lives in New York City (An
example would be trustee Roger
Lewis).
Proximity to the campus can
bring some of the pressing is
sues of education and student
life into much sharper focus.
The 1954 court order (Supe
rior Court of Santa Clara Coun
ty, number 14912, Department
6) allowing Alumni Association
representation, stated that the
number of trustees would be in
creased from 15 to 23, including
three Alumni Association mem
bers. Regular members would
still have ten year terms and
the Alumni trustees would have
five year terms, according to the
order.
Close Relationship
Two main arguments were
used by the Board of Trustees,
which had originally asked for
the court order, for the expan
sion. First, the workload had in
creased. Second, a closer rela
tionship was needed between
the Board and the University.
It wa6 felt that alumni mem

bers could more fully meet the
hopes of the grantors (Senator
and Mrs. Stanford).
But wouldn't a student or fac
ulty member bring the trustees
much closer to the University?
Most of the present trustees,
that is those who went to Stan
ford, graduated between 1915
and 1940. It is a much different
Stanford now.
Students could be used as ad
vistors to the Board. But they
could also be ignored. Only as
members would they have suffi
cient power to make their pres
ence felt.
I propose that the students
be elected to two year terms in
a general student body election
and that the faculty trustees be
elected by the Academic Coun
cil. Both elections would provide
representative trustees.
Adequate Time
Students would have enough
time to adequately fulfill the re
sponsibilities of a trustee. When
interviewed by a Daily reporter
last year, Richard E. Guggen
hime, President of the Board,
stated that he put in about one
and a half days a week in Board
activities. If the President only
works 12 hours per week for
the Board, then we can assume
that other members spend even
less time on the Board. Students
engaged in LASSU, The Daily,
and other campus activities,
spend much more time away
from their books. Time would
not hinder the effectiveness of a
student trustee.
The case for student trustees
is apparent. But it will take
another court order to get any
thing done. And this time it
probably will not have the back
ing of the Board of Trustees.
If the Alumni Association
can have trustee representation,
why not the students and fac
ulty?
About twelve years ago, the
Alumni Association took their
case to the courts . . . and won.
The membership of the Board
of Trustees was expanded to in
