# Academic Advisory Boards Aid Trustees
## 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL (Fourth in a series) 
One of the most exciting and most
promising developments in Board of
Trustee structure in recent years has
been the advent of academic advisory
boards.
The bodies are groups of board
members and outside experts who are
charged with visiting, observing, and
discussing the problems of given aca
demic areas. They fulfill the two-fold
purpose of both giving the trustees
intimate contact with the academic
workings of the university and of
providing departments and schools
with encouragement and expert ad
vice.
Harvard, for example, has a well
developed system of visiting commit
tees, forty-four in number. "Visiting
committees; of the Board of Over
seers," the university explains, "form
a sort of two-way street between the
various professional schools or de
partments of instruction on the one

hand and the board itself on the
other."
Board Keeps Informed
'Through these committees, the
board keeps in touch with and is in
formed about the current activities
of all important branches of the uni
versity. To these committees also, the
faculties of the several schools and
departments turn for constructive
criticism or for help in securing their
objectives."
"The relationships thus established
have become an integral part of Har
vard's educational system."
(Harvard, unlike most universities,
is not run by a Board of Trustees, but
rather by two more or less coordinate
bodies. The Corporation, composed of
the President, the Treasurer, and five
fellows, is self-perpetuating with the
approval of the Overseers. It handles
the week-to-week tasks and most of
its important actions are subject to
the advice and consent of the Over
seers. The Overseers is a body of
thirty alumni elected by the gradu
ates of Harvard for six-year terms.)
Harvard Committee
Each Harvard visiting committee is
organized with an Overseer as chair
man and includes from five to twenty
members, who are not necessarily
Harvard graduates and not usually
connected with the university.
The committees visit classrooms
and laboratories, and hold discussion
meetings and occasional dinner meet
ings with faculty members. Each
chairman reports to the board of
Overseers once a year orally and by
formal written report every three
years.
The University of Pennsylvania ha 6
ten academic advisory boards, formed
in 1954 and composed in part of trus
tees but chiefly of other individuals
chosen by reason of special interest
or competence in the particular field
to which the board relates.
The function of the boards is "dis
cussing problems and raising ques
tions so that the President and the
administrative officers, and the trus
tees if they so dosire, may receive the
benefit of their aid and counsel"

(Donald Belcher, writing in a self
study commissioned in 1959 by the
trustees of the University of Pennsyl
vania).
Scope of Penn Boards
The Boards concern themselves with
"the organization and quality of in
struction and research and with their
stimulation and support," Belcher
says. By developing effective com
munication with the faculties, the
Boards "contribute much in the way
of encouragement, cooperation, and
assistance to the faculties, especially
in their creative efforts to advance
the educational objectives of the uni
versity."
Previous to 1954, Pennsylvania had
a system of "constituent" boards
which was discontinued because it
"represented such a confusion of pol
icy-making and administrative au
thority as to conflict with the policy
making role of the Board of Trus
tees, promote undesirable autonomy
for the various schools, and prevent
the President from exercising his full
authority" (Belcher).
Penn Boards' Possibilities
Pennsylvania officials believe that
with the Academic Advisory Board
system trustees "can be ofTered par
ticipation that they will find fully re
warding and the advisory boards can
be developed into effective and power
ful instrumentalities in the service of
the university."
"Indeed, it is not too much to say
that herein lies the key, not only to
vastly improved relations among
trustees, administration, and faculty,
but to a strengthening and revitaliza
tion of the entire system of university
government."
Stanford, too, has some visiting
committees, but they stress the ad
visory capacity to the schools and
minimize any connection to the Board
of Trustees, although trustees serve
on some of the committees, mostly in
their professional fields.
Seven Stanford Committees
Authorized by the Board of Trustees
in 1960, the visiting committees now
number seven, and are mostly in the

professional schools. Business, earth
science, education, law, medicine, ath
letics, and computer science now
have such committees.
Also, one is being formed for engi

neering and there are long-range
plans for two or three in humanities
and sciences, and ones for the Library
and stndent affairs.
TThe committees are made up
ot leaders in various professions
who analyze current Stanford
programs in terms of their pro
fessions' needs.
* Committee Functions
T"The committees advise the
President and the Deans of the
schools on the operations of pro
fessional schools with special
reference to the training of the
students for the professions,"
says James Thurber, assistant to
the provost and coordinator of
the committees.
The functions of the commit
tees, according to the statement
of the board of trustees, include:
1) present new ideas to the
school visited; 2) bring an out
side view on the programs, plans,
and operations o fthe school;
3) help to circulate information
about Stanford in general, and
the school in particular among
alumni and friends;
4) serve as liaison between the
scjhool and related professions
or industries, educational funda
tipns, etc.; 5) formulate recom
mendations and conclusions re
garding the operations of the
school; 6) consider and review
plans for the meeting of financial
needs.
Each committee makes a two
day visit to the campus once or
twice a year. The visit usually

includes a report from the Dean,
a series of talks by leading pro
fessors of the school, a recep
tion with senior students in the
school ,and a business meeting.

faculties of the several schools and

criticism or for help in securing their
objectives."

(Harvard, unlike most universities,
is not run by a Board of Trustees, but
rather by two more or less coordinate
bodies. The Corporation, composed of
the President, the Treasurer, and five
fellows, is self-perpetuating with the
approval of the Overseers. It handles
the week-to-week tasks and most of
its important actions are subject to

Harvard Committee
Each Harvard visiting committee is
organized with an Overseer as chair
man and includes from five to twenty
members, who are not necessarily
Harvard graduates and not usually
connected with the university.
The committees visit classrooms
and laboratories, and hold discussion
meetings and occasional dinner meet
ings with faculty members. Each
chairman reports to the board of
Overseers once a year orally and by
formal written report every three
years.
The University of Pennsylvania ha 6
ten academic advisory boards, formed
in 1954 and composed in part of trus
tees but chiefly of other individuals
chosen by reason of special interest
or competence in the particular field
to which the board relates.
The function of the boards is "dis
cussing problems and raising ques
tions so that the President and the
administrative officers, and the trus
tees if they so dosire, may receive the
benefit of their aid and counsel"

(Donald Belcher, writing in a self
study commissioned in 1959 by the
trustees of the University of Pennsyl
vania).
Scope of Penn Boards
The Boards concern themselves with
"the organization and quality of in
struction and research and with their
stimulation and support," Belcher
says. By developing effective com
munication with the faculties, the
Boards "contribute much in the way
of encouragement, cooperation, and
assistance to the faculties, especially
in their creative efforts to advance
the educational objectives of the uni
versity."
Previous to 1954, Pennsylvania had
a system of "constituent" boards
which was discontinued because it
"represented such a confusion of pol
icy-making and administrative au
thority as to conflict with the policy
making role of the Board of Trus
tees, promote undesirable autonomy
for the various schools, and prevent
the President from exercising his full
authority" (Belcher).
Penn Boards' Possibilities
Pennsylvania officials believe that
with the Academic Advisory Board
system trustees "can be ofTered par
ticipation that they will find fully re
warding and the advisory boards can
be developed into effective and power
ful instrumentalities in the service of
the university."
"Indeed, it is not too much to say
that herein lies the key, not only to
vastly improved relations among
trustees, administration, and faculty,
but to a strengthening and revitaliza
tion of the entire system of university
government."
Stanford, too, has some visiting
committees, but they stress the ad
visory capacity to the schools and
minimize any connection to the Board
of Trustees, although trustees serve
on some of the committees, mostly in
their professional fields.
Seven Stanford Committees
Authorized by the Board of Trustees
in 1960, the visiting committees now
number seven, and are mostly in the

professional schools. Business, earth
science, education, law, medicine, ath
letics, and computer science now
have such committees.
Also, one is being formed for engi

neering and there are long-range
plans for two or three in humanities
and sciences, and ones for the Library
and stndent affairs.
TThe committees are made up
ot leaders in various professions
who analyze current Stanford
programs in terms of their pro
fessions' needs.
* Committee Functions
T"The committees advise the
President and the Deans of the
schools on the operations of pro
fessional schools with special
reference to the training of the
students for the professions,"
says James Thurber, assistant to
the provost and coordinator of
the committees.
The functions of the commit
tees, according to the statement
of the board of trustees, include:
1) present new ideas to the
school visited; 2) bring an out
side view on the programs, plans,
and operations o fthe school;
3) help to circulate information
about Stanford in general, and
the school in particular among
alumni and friends;
4) serve as liaison between the
scjhool and related professions
or industries, educational funda
tipns, etc.; 5) formulate recom
mendations and conclusions re
garding the operations of the
school; 6) consider and review
plans for the meeting of financial
needs.
Each committee makes a two
day visit to the campus once or
twice a year. The visit usually

includes a report from the Dean,
a series of talks by leading pro
fessors of the school, a recep
tion with senior students in the
school ,and a business meeting.
(Next: The Stanford Board of
Trustees.)
One of the most exciting and most
promising developments in Board of
Trustee structure in recent years has
been the advent of academic advisory
boards.
The bodies are groups of board
members and outside experts who are
charged with visiting, observing, and
discussing the problems of given aca
demic areas. They fulfill the two-fold
purpose of both giving the trustees
intimate contact with the academic
workings of the university and of
providing departments and schools
with encouragement and expert ad
vice.
Harvard, for example, has a well
developed system of visiting commit
tees, forty-four in number. "Visiting
committees; of the Board of Over
seers," the university explains, "form
a sort of two-way street between the
various professional schools or de
partments of instruction on the one

hand and the board itself on the
other."
Board Keeps Informed
'Through these committees, the
board keeps in touch with and is in
formed about the current activities
of all important branches of the uni
versity. To these committees also, the

Penn Boards' Possibilities
Pennsylvania officials believe that
with the Academic Advisory Board
system trustees "can be ofTered par
ticipation that they will find fully re
warding and the advisory boards can
be developed into effective and power
ful instrumentalities in the service of
the university."
"Indeed, it is not too much to say
that herein lies the key, not only to
vastly improved relations among
trustees, administration, and faculty,
but to a strengthening and revitaliza
tion of the entire system of university
government."
Stanford, too, has some visiting
committees, but they stress the ad
visory capacity to the schools and
minimize any connection to the Board
of Trustees, although trustees serve
on some of the committees, mostly in
their professional fields.
Seven Stanford Committees
Authorized by the Board of Trustees
in 1960, the visiting committees now
number seven, and are mostly in the

professional schools. Business, earth
science, education, law, medicine, ath
letics, and computer science now
have such committees.
Also, one is being formed for engi

neering and there are long-range
plans for two or three in humanities
and sciences, and ones for the Library
and stndent affairs.
TThe committees are made up
ot leaders in various professions
who analyze current Stanford
programs in terms of their pro
fessions' needs.
* Committee Functions
T"The committees advise the
President and the Deans of the
schools on the operations of pro
fessional schools with special
reference to the training of the
students for the professions,"
says James Thurber, assistant to
the provost and coordinator of
the committees.
The functions of the commit
tees, according to the statement
of the board of trustees, include:
1) present new ideas to the
school visited; 2) bring an out
side view on the programs, plans,
and operations o fthe school;
3) help to circulate information
about Stanford in general, and
the school in particular among
alumni and friends;
4) serve as liaison between the
scjhool and related professions
or industries, educational funda
tipns, etc.; 5) formulate recom
mendations and conclusions re
garding the operations of the
school; 6) consider and review
plans for the meeting of financial
needs.
Each committee makes a two
day visit to the campus once or
twice a year. The visit usually

includes a report from the Dean,
a series of talks by leading pro
fessors of the school, a recep
tion with senior students in the
school ,and a business meeting.

One of the most exciting and most
promising developments in Board of
Trustee structure in recent years has
been the advent of academic advisory
boards.
The bodies are groups of board
members and outside experts who are
charged with visiting, observing, and
discussing the problems of given aca
demic areas. They fulfill the two-fold
purpose of both giving the trustees
intimate contact with the academic
workings of the university and of
providing departments and schools
with encouragement and expert ad
vice.
Harvard, for example, has a well
developed system of visiting commit
tees, forty-four in number. "Visiting
committees; of the Board of Over
seers," the university explains, "form
a sort of two-way street between the
various professional schools or de
partments of instruction on the one

hand and the board itself on the
other."
Board Keeps Informed
'Through these committees, the
board keeps in touch with and is in
formed about the current activities
of all important branches of the uni
versity. To these committees also, the
faculties of the several schools and
departments turn for constructive
criticism or for help in securing their
objectives."
"The relationships thus established
have become an integral part of Har
vard's educational system."
(Harvard, unlike most universities,
is not run by a Board of Trustees, but
rather by two more or less coordinate
bodies. The Corporation, composed of
the President, the Treasurer, and five
fellows, is self-perpetuating with the
approval of the Overseers. It handles
the week-to-week tasks and most of
its important actions are subject to
the advice and consent of the Over
seers. The Overseers is a body of
thirty alumni elected by the gradu
ates of Harvard for six-year terms.)
Harvard Committee
Each Harvard visiting committee is
organized with an Overseer as chair
man and includes from five to twenty
members, who are not necessarily
Harvard graduates and not usually
connected with the university.
The committees visit classrooms
and laboratories, and hold discussion
meetings and occasional dinner meet
ings with faculty members. Each
chairman reports to the board of
Overseers once a year orally and by
formal written report every three
years.
The University of Pennsylvania ha 6
ten academic advisory boards, formed
in 1954 and composed in part of trus
tees but chiefly of other individuals
chosen by reason of special interest
or competence in the particular field
to which the board relates.
The function of the boards is "dis
cussing problems and raising ques
tions so that the President and the
administrative officers, and the trus
tees if they so dosire, may receive the
benefit of their aid and counsel"

(Donald Belcher, writing in a self
study commissioned in 1959 by the
trustees of the University of Pennsyl
vania).
Scope of Penn Boards
The Boards concern themselves with
"the organization and quality of in
struction and research and with their
stimulation and support," Belcher
says. By developing effective com
munication with the faculties, the
Boards "contribute much in the way
of encouragement, cooperation, and
assistance to the faculties, especially
in their creative efforts to advance
the educational objectives of the uni
versity."
Previous to 1954, Pennsylvania had
a system of "constituent" boards
which was discontinued because it
"represented such a confusion of pol
icy-making and administrative au
thority as to conflict with the policy
making role of the Board of Trus
tees, promote undesirable autonomy
for the various schools, and prevent
the President from exercising his full
authority" (Belcher).

assistance to the faculties, especially
in their creative efforts to advance
the educational objectives of the uni
versity."
Previous to 1954, Pennsylvania had
a system of "constituent" boards
which was discontinued because it
"represented such a confusion of pol
icy-making and administrative au
thority as to conflict with the policy
making role of the Board of Trus
tees, promote undesirable autonomy
for the various schools, and prevent
the President from exercising his full
authority" (Belcher).
Penn Boards' Possibilities
Pennsylvania officials believe that
with the Academic Advisory Board
system trustees "can be ofTered par
ticipation that they will find fully re
warding and the advisory boards can
be developed into effective and power
ful instrumentalities in the service of
the university."
"Indeed, it is not too much to say
that herein lies the key, not only to
vastly improved relations among
trustees, administration, and faculty,
but to a strengthening and revitaliza
tion of the entire system of university
government."
Stanford, too, has some visiting
committees, but they stress the ad
visory capacity to the schools and
minimize any connection to the Board
of Trustees, although trustees serve
on some of the committees, mostly in
their professional fields.
Seven Stanford Committees
Authorized by the Board of Trustees
in 1960, the visiting committees now
number seven, and are mostly in the

professional schools. Business, earth
science, education, law, medicine, ath
letics, and computer science now
have such committees.
Also, one is being formed for engi

neering and there are long-range
plans for two or three in humanities
and sciences, and ones for the Library
and stndent affairs.
TThe committees are made up
ot leaders in various professions
who analyze current Stanford
programs in terms of their pro
fessions' needs.
* Committee Functions
T"The committees advise the
President and the Deans of the
schools on the operations of pro
fessional schools with special
reference to the training of the
students for the professions,"
says James Thurber, assistant to
the provost and coordinator of
the committees.
The functions of the commit
tees, according to the statement
of the board of trustees, include:
1) present new ideas to the
school visited; 2) bring an out
side view on the programs, plans,
and operations o fthe school;
3) help to circulate information
about Stanford in general, and
the school in particular among
alumni and friends;
4) serve as liaison between the
scjhool and related professions
or industries, educational funda
tipns, etc.; 5) formulate recom
mendations and conclusions re
garding the operations of the
school; 6) consider and review
plans for the meeting of financial
needs.
Each committee makes a two
day visit to the campus once or
twice a year. The visit usually

includes a report from the Dean,
a series of talks by leading pro
fessors of the school, a recep
tion with senior students in the
school ,and a business meeting.
