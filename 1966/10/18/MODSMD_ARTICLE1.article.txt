# Beta Chi Votes To Abolish Selective Rush
## Frat To Admit Grads And Women 
### 
Beta Chi fraternity last night voted
to abolish the selective system for
choosing new members and to sub
stantially broaden the basis for its
membership.
Over three quarters of the fratern
ity's 55 members rejected the selection
procedures currently usel by all fra
ternities at Stanfordâ€”rush and a ding
system.
They instructed the house's execu
tive committee to draw up a specific
plan to allow any interested member
of the Stanford community to become
a member of the fraternity.
Prerequisite
Under the new system, the only
prerequisite for membership would be
evidence of an interest in the house's
functions and payment of house dues.
The present clause in the Beta Chi
constitution states that any male un
dergraduate registered at Stanford is
eligible for membership. Under the
system passed last night the criteria
will be changed to read "any member

of the Stanford community," and thus
will allow the fraternity to have wom
en, faculty members, graduate stu
dents, administrators, and others as
members.
Dick Williams, president of Beta
Chi, called the action a "very strong
rejection of the ding system, of the
idea of exclusive selective living, and
a strong support of the belief that
fraternities' programs can be, should
be, and will be good enough to at
tract new members."
More Intellectual
"We will be drawing commitment
not only of a more intellectual nature,
but also of a more realistic nature, in
that the demands made by the fra
ternity are now those that the in
dividual in the University should be
making of himself anyway, those of
self-understanidng and self-develop
ment," Williams continued.
According to Williams, Beta Chi's
status with the Interfraternity Coun
cil (IFC) is uncertain, "We will stay
in IFC for at least a quarter to see
whether the new emphasis on the edu
cational goals of a fraternity is real,"
he said.
"If they have this goal firmly in
mind, they will recognize the chal
lenges ahead. The recent weekend
seminar is an indication that they are
off to an auspicious start."
Postponed Payment
Also at last night's meeting, Beta
Chi decided to postpone payment of
the Interfraternity Council's assess
ment of one dollar per man per
month, asking that the IFC first show
the house its budget for the year.
Williams hopes the house will be

able to attract interest from the com
munity through interesting programs,
rather than simply through an orga
nized rush as in the past .
He pointed out that fraternities, in
cluding Beta Chi, have traditionally
been inward oriented and that Beta
Chi's intention is to become more of
a living part of the University com
munity.
Intease Culture
As examples of the fraternity's cur
rent efforts to emphasize an intense
cultural, social, and intellectual pro
gram, Williams cited recent talks at
Beta Chi by John Ohmans, U.S. Labor
Attache in Venezuela, and History Pro
fessor Don Fehrenbacher, as well as
an Experiment seminar.
He added that Dean Joel Smith
would speak at the house after dinner
tomorrow on "Alienation of the Stu
dent Left" and that anyone from the
Stanford community was welcome to
attend.
Ninety-one percent of the members
present voted in favor of last night's
proposal. The 43 students voting affir
matively make up 78 percent of the
total membership.
Reconsideration
Beta Chi, formerly the Beta Chi
chapter of Sigma Nu fraternity, went
local in November of 1962 after that
year's pledge class initiated a serious
reconsideration of the goals of a fra
ternity.
The Executive Committee of Beta
Chi consists of Williams, the Vice
President, the Treasurer, the Secre
tary, the Rush Chairman, and the
house's two Social Chairmen. It will
present its proposal to the full mem
bership at a meeting next Monday.
