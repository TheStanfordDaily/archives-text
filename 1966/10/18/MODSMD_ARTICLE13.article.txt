# Phi Delts Again?
## IM Football Leaders Emerge 
### 
iWth two rounds of intra
mural football in the books after
today's play, contenders in the
eight "A" leagues have sorted
themselves out and will begin to
take aim at each other in the
key games to decide league
champions and University play
off berths.
First to collide will be Sigma
Chi and Phi Kappa Sigma, who
meet Thursday, possibly to de
cide their league title. If the Phi
Kaps can get by Theta Chi today
they will be 2-0 as is Sigma Chi,
64-0 winner over Delta Chi in
the opener but fortunate to get
by Phi Sig last Thursday.
The Phi Kaps were impressive

winners their first time out and
could go a long way with a vic
tory over Sigma Chi, although
they must play unbeaten ATO
later in the season.
Tight Tussles
Another of the fraternity
leagues could go down to the
last week, when Phi Delta Theta,
defending University champion,
and Theta Delta Chi, which has
won two games by a combined
score of 103-0, meet in what
could be, not only a battle of un
defeated teams but a preview of
the University finals as well.
However, SAE, which plays both
teams within three days just
prior to their meeting, might

trip up someone looking too far
ahead.
The Stern league could go to
the wire as well, as '65 runnerup
Fremont and Donner, unscored
upon so far ,are due to meet in
the last round. Donner must first
get by Serra, which it plays
Thursday.
3-Way Races
Both the Wilbur and eating
club leagues look like three-team
races. TTie Arroyo-Soto game to
day could say a lot about the
final frosh standings, but both
teams must yet play Madera,
which counts a 40-0 trouncing of
Otero among its two wins.
Cuadro, Toro and Tigre re
main unbeaten among the clubs,

with the first confrontation to
come between Cuadro and Tigre
next Monday. El Toro tries for
its third straight against Los
Arcos this afternoon.
Graduate leagues appear to be
pointing toward a last-round
Neutrinos (Physics) • Psychedel
ics (Psychology) meeting and an
October 27 Dislocations - Village
Idiots game to decide the top
spots, although numerous re
schedulings have clouded the pic
ture somewhat.
Competition has progressed
smoothly so far, according to in
tramural director Gary Ness.
Forfeits have been rare, and a
spacious new field has helped to
compress the schedule.

and Theta Delta Chi, which has
won two games by a combined
score of 103-0, meet in what
could be, not only a battle of un
defeated teams but a preview of
the University finals as well.
However, SAE, which plays both
teams within three days just
prior to their meeting, might

trip up someone looking too far
ahead.
The Stern league could go to
the wire as well, as '65 runnerup
Fremont and Donner, unscored
upon so far ,are due to meet in
the last round. Donner must first
get by Serra, which it plays
Thursday.
3-Way Races
Both the Wilbur and eating
club leagues look like three-team
races. TTie Arroyo-Soto game to
day could say a lot about the
final frosh standings, but both
teams must yet play Madera,
which counts a 40-0 trouncing of
Otero among its two wins.
Cuadro, Toro and Tigre re
main unbeaten among the clubs,

with the first confrontation to
come between Cuadro and Tigre
next Monday. El Toro tries for
its third straight against Los
Arcos this afternoon.
Graduate leagues appear to be
pointing toward a last-round
Neutrinos (Physics) • Psychedel
ics (Psychology) meeting and an
October 27 Dislocations - Village
Idiots game to decide the top
spots, although numerous re
schedulings have clouded the pic
ture somewhat.
Competition has progressed
smoothly so far, according to in
tramural director Gary Ness.
Forfeits have been rare, and a
spacious new field has helped to
compress the schedule.
iWth two rounds of intra
mural football in the books after
today's play, contenders in the
eight "A" leagues have sorted
themselves out and will begin to
take aim at each other in the
key games to decide league
champions and University play
off berths.
First to collide will be Sigma
Chi and Phi Kappa Sigma, who
meet Thursday, possibly to de
cide their league title. If the Phi
Kaps can get by Theta Chi today
they will be 2-0 as is Sigma Chi,
64-0 winner over Delta Chi in
the opener but fortunate to get
by Phi Sig last Thursday.
The Phi Kaps were impressive

winners their first time out and
could go a long way with a vic
tory over Sigma Chi, although
they must play unbeaten ATO
later in the season.
Tight Tussles
Another of the fraternity
leagues could go down to the
last week, when Phi Delta Theta,
defending University champion,
and Theta Delta Chi, which has
won two games by a combined
score of 103-0, meet in what
could be, not only a battle of un
defeated teams but a preview of
the University finals as well.
