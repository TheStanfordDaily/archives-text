The Stanford Ski Racing team
is a group of enthusiastic men
and women racers suported by
the Stanford Ski Club. It has
fluctuated between good and bad
seasons but this year promises
to be one of its best. In 1963-64
the team participated in four ma
jor races and a number of minor
ones. Money was provided by the
Stanford Ski Club to support the
team in the traditional events of
slalom, down hill, cross country
and jumping. In addition to our
top four men, a women's team
was for the first time taken to
the 1964 Nevada Winter Carni
val. This is one of the highlites

of the racing collegiate circle in
the West. The competition was
good in all events but Stanford
consistantly came out ahead of
that other school up at Berkeley.
Team Down And Up
The 1964-65 season was a dis
appointment due to the lack of
interest among the racers them
selves and in the captain, who
quit. The best races this year
were also scheduled during finals
or spring vacation. All of this

Interception last weekend at
Stanford Stadium to stop a Tro
jan drive. John has specialized
in pass interceptions for three
years as a defensive halfback;
beginning with his two intercep
tions in the '64 Cal game, con
tinuing through the '65 season,
and up to the present. Currently
he is a leading factor in Stan
ford's defensive lineup.

added up to a very disappointing
season.
Last year the team got off to
a slow but good start. There was
a good deal of interest among
the freshmen and new students.
The team was able to race both
in the men's and women's divi
sions and participated in meets
from Oregon to Southern Cali
fornia to the Nevada Winter
Carnival. Competitors included
such schools as California, Ne
vada, University of Oregon, San
Jose State, Arizona, Utah, the
Air Force, University of Colo
rado, UC at Davis, USCA, etc.
Racers Required
This year we are once again
faced with the problem of re
cruiting new members. We need
racers, both men and women.
We will support a team as large
as possible. If enough interest
and talent is shown, the money
can be found and we can have a
successful season once again.
The 1966-67 Organizational
Meeting will be held Tuesday,
October 18, 7:00 p.m. in Room
271 at Tresidder. At the meeting
team organization, scheduled
competitors, furture me ets,
and the team's financial status
will be discussed. In addition, all
questions will be answered. All
prospective members are urged
to attend.
