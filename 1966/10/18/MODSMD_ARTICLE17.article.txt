Trojan defender Tom Rossovuch (88) leaps In a
vain attempt to block a pass thrown by Stanford
quarterback Chuch Williams (11) in Saturday's
game with USC. Intended pass receiver Bob Blunt
(29) is shown awaiting- the pass. Stanford fullback
Jack Root (36) is about to put a crushing block on
Rossovuch. With an overpowering first half USC
wrecked the Indians 21-7.
