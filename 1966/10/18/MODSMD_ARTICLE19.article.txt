# Letters To The Editor
## Business School, Off-Campus Controversies Gather Steam 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
In response to Mr. Hass' re
cent letter on Business Ideology,
I thought I'd entertain you with
a few of my prejudices about
the business world.
Having taken as an axiom that
the businessman can contribute
nothing "worthwhile" to society,
Mr. Hass cleverly concluded that
we should not bother to educate
him. I confess that the prospect
of a massive return to the "noble
savage" by 56 million of my com
patriots somewhat alarms me.
Would not the humanist
approach this problem with a
bias for education rather than
excommunication?
Since better educ a t i on of
businessmen can be expected to
lead to improved efficiency on
the allocation of societies' re
sources, we will be able to ob
tain, less expensively, the spirit
ual and material rewards we de
promise to free administrators
of many repetitive problems
which plague them today. Per
haps a shorter workweek will
result, and certainly more people
will take a break in mid-life to
return to the University.
Lastly, the greater GNP which
Mr. Hass derides is an essential
Ingredient in solving America's
civil rights and poverty prob
lems. Not everyone in our society
is quite so affluent as Mr. Hass,
that he can shout "better" be
fore he shouts "more"!

an undergrad, I found that we
could feed our members pretty
well (26 meals per week) for $54
per month. With a full-time cook
and free board for a kitchen
crew of 8 we had a break even
point of 47 men. Why does En
cina have to charge $140 (about
$50 a month) for lunch and din
ner five days a week? Can words
overhead and monopoly have
anything to do with it?
Other choices available are:
cooking (time-consuming), res
taurants (expensive), and the
Union (ugh).
At least there is one consola
tion. The man who lives in
Crothers or eats at Encina is
there by choice. He is committed
to spending 9 months in Croth

doesn't like it, it is his mistake.
Pity the poor undergraduate girl

choice, and who spends four

I like to express my view
about the living off-campus is

Stanford women be allowed to
live off campus because of the
following reasons, romantic as
they may be thought, but, then,

I must admit I see nothing
wrong with equality of rights to
both sexes and freedom of
choice, yet I see in this off-cam

assort this equality, to point out
to the world women are equal to
men. The desire to live off cam
pus seems only secondary
though I might be mistaken. We
could have equal rights if we
truly wanted them and worked
to get them. Yet the question
here should not be equality for
its sake, because it is latently
there, but actual need and de
sire to live off-campus.

In response to Mr. Hass' re
cent letter on Business Ideology,
I thought I'd entertain you with
a few of my prejudices about
the business world.
Having taken as an axiom that
the businessman can contribute
nothing "worthwhile" to society,
Mr. Hass cleverly concluded that
we should not bother to educate
him. I confess that the prospect
of a massive return to the "noble
savage" by 56 million of my com
patriots somewhat alarms me.
Would not the humanist
approach this problem with a
bias for education rather than
excommunication?
Since better educ a t i on of
businessmen can be expected to
lead to improved efficiency on
the allocation of societies' re
sources, we will be able to ob
tain, less expensively, the spirit
ual and material rewards we de
promise to free administrators
of many repetitive problems
which plague them today. Per
haps a shorter workweek will
result, and certainly more people
will take a break in mid-life to
return to the University.
Lastly, the greater GNP which
Mr. Hass derides is an essential
Ingredient in solving America's
civil rights and poverty prob
lems. Not everyone in our society
is quite so affluent as Mr. Hass,
that he can shout "better" be
fore he shouts "more"!

Editor, The Daily:
In response to Mr. Hass' re
cent letter on Business Ideology,
I thought I'd entertain you with
a few of my prejudices about
the business world.
Having taken as an axiom that
the businessman can contribute
nothing "worthwhile" to society,
Mr. Hass cleverly concluded that
we should not bother to educate
him. I confess that the prospect
of a massive return to the "noble
savage" by 56 million of my com
patriots somewhat alarms me.
Would not the humanist
approach this problem with a
bias for education rather than
excommunication?
Since better educ a t i on of
businessmen can be expected to
lead to improved efficiency on
the allocation of societies' re
sources, we will be able to ob
tain, less expensively, the spirit
ual and material rewards we de
promise to free administrators
of many repetitive problems
which plague them today. Per
haps a shorter workweek will
result, and certainly more people
will take a break in mid-life to
return to the University.
Lastly, the greater GNP which
Mr. Hass derides is an essential
Ingredient in solving America's
civil rights and poverty prob
lems. Not everyone in our society
is quite so affluent as Mr. Hass,
that he can shout "better" be
fore he shouts "more"!

an undergrad, I found that we
could feed our members pretty
well (26 meals per week) for $54
per month. With a full-time cook
and free board for a kitchen
crew of 8 we had a break even
point of 47 men. Why does En
cina have to charge $140 (about
$50 a month) for lunch and din
ner five days a week? Can words
overhead and monopoly have
anything to do with it?
Other choices available are:
cooking (time-consuming), res
taurants (expensive), and the
Union (ugh).
At least there is one consola
tion. The man who lives in
Crothers or eats at Encina is
there by choice. He is committed
to spending 9 months in Croth
ers or 3 months at Encina. If he
doesn't like it, it is his mistake.
Pity the poor undergraduate girl
who is not allowed to make a
choice, and who spends four
years pondering questions like
thp^p

• Romanticism
Editor, The Daily:
I like to express my view
about the living off-campus is
sue. I oppose the proposition that
Stanford women be allowed to
live off campus because of the
following reasons, romantic as
they may be thought, but, then,
what is wrong with romanti
cism?
University years are very
special. I like *o live where there
v though I my
' ve that
, e

traditions which should be kept
alive to later be cherished.
I must admit I see nothing
wrong with equality of rights to
both sexes and freedom of
choice, yet I see in this off-cam
pus issue, solely an attempt to
assort this equality, to point out
to the world women are equal to
men. The desire to live off cam
pus seems only secondary
though I might be mistaken. We
could have equal rights if we
truly wanted them and worked
to get them. Yet the question
here should not be equality for
its sake, because it is latently
there, but actual need and de
sire to live off-campus.

• Thank You
Editor, The Daily:
The Stanford Band would like
to thank The Daily for its help
in locating our kitten; Heidi is
back again at the Band Shak.
However, this letter was also de
signed to thank many others:
the Athletic Department, the
Employment Service Office, the
Stanford and Palo Alto police de
partments, and everyone else
who showed concern over a little
lost cat. In a university situa
tion, where everything seems
somewhat impersonal and
thoughts seem focused on po
litical problems, homework,
graduation, and a good job, it is
encouraging to see concern for
the smaller things in life.
