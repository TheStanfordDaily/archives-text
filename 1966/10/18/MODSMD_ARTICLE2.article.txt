# Defendants Acquitted In 'Hours' Rules Case
## 
### JIM SELNA Editor 
The ASSU Judicial Council last
night unanimously acquited two stu
dents charged with violation of Uni
versity open house regulations in a
test case involving a conflict between
University and LASSU regulations.
Michael Couzens and Charlotte Ack
erly were found innocent under ASSU
last spring. However, Chairman Mimi
Sherman said the Council also had to
consider the charge according to Uni
versity regulations.
Rendering the decision, Miss Sher
man said, "We chose to regard lack
of enforcement (of open house policy)
in men's residences as an implicit in
terpretation of University regula
tions."
No Conflict
The Council found thus no conflict
in law between ASSU and University
regulations, thus not requiring that
the case be referred to the Interim
Judicial Board.
Current University policy permits
women in men's residences on
Wednesday and Friday evenings only,
while ASSU regulations sanction open
houses at the discretion of each liv
ing groups.
Couzens pleaded innocent to violat

ing University policy, and explained
his reasons for bringing about a test
case. He objected to the "crazy-quilt"
enforcement of open house policy
throughout the campus."
"If a law is on the books and not
enforced, it generates a disrespect for
the law," he noted.
Shilly-Shallyinp
Couzens expected the conflict in law
between University and student reg
ulations to be resolved last year, and
accused the Student Services and Af
fairs Committee of "shilly-shallying
and stalling" in its consideration of
the issue last spring.
Disgrunted at the failure of the
University to resolve the conflict,
Couzens invited Miss Ackerly to his
room in Stern Hall on a Tuesday eve
ning last May to initiate a test case.
Couzens complained he had to "brow
beat the resident assistant to catch
us," and was finally forced to "lure"
the Stern director into formally bring
charges against himself and Miss Ack
erly.
The Committee of Fifteen is cur
rently studying the conflict of law
over open house regulations and is
expected to present formal recom
mendations some time next week.
