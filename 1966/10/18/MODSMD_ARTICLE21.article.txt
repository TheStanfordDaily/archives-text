# To The University: Define Your Terms
## 
### JOEL KUGELMASS 
There comes a time, often
during the senior year, when the
student turns to the University
and asks, "are you serious?"
For the most part, this question
is merely rhetorical. The reason
it is rhetorical is that the un
dergraduate experience seems to
cohere only by virtue of some
what empty alpha numeric sym
bols: grades, sort numbers, ridic
ulously shortened course titles
(I once took a mathematics
course named "anal concepts"),
and appendages of pithy com
ments many times written by
strangers.
In response to this partcular
absurdity many forms of person
alism have evolved. Students
bring faculty to their living
groups, and faculty bring
students to their homes. Meet
ings grow like mushrooms, host
ed by any issue that the English
language is capable of framing.
"Let's all get together, yeh, yeh,
yeh," is the resounding cry.
Nltty-Gritty
Only occasionally, however,
are these "activities" valued in
themselves; they are clouded
over by an informal telos of es
tablishing community, "making
academics real," getting to that
style, that is), or insidiously gar
nering recommendations.
Meanwhile, back at the farm,
education is growing senile.
Consider, in illustration, the
freshman year, in comparison
with the sophomore year. Fresh
men on the whole respond with
excitement to the myriad pro
grams, curricular and extracur
ricular; discussions on important
topics abound. These sself-same
len and women could on the
'hole care less about the self
ime topics a year later. A cer
in percentage, those who con
tute the continuity of leader
p for the undergarduates, re
n their interest. The rest, well,
lize that the "time for fun is
r" and that they must now
ikle down and get to work,"
jn the other hand, that the
i for fun is just beginning
er the tutorship of their up
?lass fellows.

eshmen who are thrilled by
iting lecturer, by a writing

workshop, or by a roundhouse
discussion, may toss off their
English themes in an hour, or
read the easily obtained conden
sations of their Western Civiliza
tion courses. The following year
their lecturers will be exciting
the new class. The upper level
courses comparable to Civ-En
glish and Caculus remain, how
ever, equally remote.
This situation is not a provin
cialism of the first year; for the
most part the student will offer
himself, or be offered by the uni
versity ,an endless stream of sur
rogates for his academics.
What this means is that the
University and its students must
come to a stand on the following
question: is there any meaning
to academics? I am sure the uni
versity ought to be founded upon
an affirmation of academics, and
that this affirmation ought to be
the major determinant in the
realization of student and fac
ulty roles.
It will no longer do to believe
that everyone agrees that educ
ation is essential to education;
for the most part, people do not
think so. Faculty have their re
search, students their activities,
and the Administration its Fed
eral programs and monies.
The idea that "books don't tell
you everything" was never
meant to be a credo or a hallu
cigen. The University must take
partial responsibility for making
it one.

serious?" "Serious son? Serious
about what?"
