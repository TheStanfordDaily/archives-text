# Kreisberg To Define US-Chinese Policy
## 
### WALLY MILLAR 
Paul Kreisberg, officer in charge of
Red Chinese affairs for the State
Department, will be at Stanford to
day to discuss the current status of
U.S.-China relations. He will present
a lecture at 4:15 p.m. in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium on the present Red Guard
political upheaval within the People's
Republic of China, and its effect on
the U.S.-Red China meetings in War
saw.
At 7:30 he will meet with students
in Tresidder room 271 at an informal
reception sponsored by the Political
Union. Richard Brody and Dr. Michael
Oksenberg, both of the Stanford In
stitute for Political Studies, will join

Kreisberg in a question and answer
period.
Speaking Tour
Kreisberg is currently on a speak
ing tour of U.S. universities. Serving
as adviser to the U.S. representative
at the meetings in Warsaw, which are
the only direct contact between the
two governments, he has observed
Chinese foreign policy for several
years. His tour is indicative of the in
creasing scrutiny of U.S.-Asian policy.
Chuck Bell, president of the Po
litical Union, assessed the importance
of Kreisberg's appearance: "Last
spring's Senate Foreign Relations
Committee hearings, according to Sen.
Fulbright, focused on American's cur
rent 'Pacific orientation,' as well as
providing a forum for the forces of
dissent. Fulbright termed the hearings
on China as probably more significant
than those on Vietnam; the time was
right, he stressed, to discuss and anal
yze American policy toward China in
a dispassionate manner. Mr. Kreis
berg's speaking tour reveals the Ad
ministration's intention to discuss the
China question free from the pres
sures of the 'teach-in' on the campus
or the congressional hearing in Wash
ington."
Columbia Graduate
In 1952, Kreisberg gave his disserta
tion at Columbia on the conflict be
tween Communist and Nationalist
forces in China during World War 11.
The same year he was appointed vice
consul for the U.S. embassy in Bom
bay. After studying the Chinese lan
guage at the University of Taichung,
he served as vice-consul at Hong Kong
until 1960. He then became a research
and intelligence specialist in the State
Department and was appointed to his
present position in 1964.
