# Liebeler Defends Warren Report Against 'Rush Judgment' Critic
## 
### RISSA WHITE 
An atmosphere of mistrust, skepti
cism, and challenge yesterday put
UCLA Professor Wesley Liebeler on
the defensive about the Warren Com
mission report. He was rebutting
author Mark Lane, who was on cam
pus Friday to criticize the document.
Liebeler, an associate attorney for
the Warren Commission, answered
Lane's charges of doctored evidence
and intent to deceive by quoting from
the text of the report and explaining
the methods of investigation and in
terrogation.
He contended that Lane distorted
the facts and quoted partially in a
deliberate attempt to deceive, and
urged readers to check the footnotes
of Lane's Rush To Judgment in order
to put excerpts in their proper con
text.
Credibility Gap
"There is still the madness of
crowds and popular delusion today
that there was at the time of the
crusades, alchemists, and witchcraft,"
said Liebeler in explaining the pub
lic's refusal to accept the report.
Futhermore there is a credibility gap
here. A large number of people al
ways doubt what the government tells
them. The notion that the Warren
Commission suppressed the truth
brings down on the commission the
pent-up feelings of people who were
emotionally upset."
Liebeler noted that there were dif
ferences of opinion among commis
sion lawyers, plus lack of judgment
and human mistakes.
One difference of opinion, ho said,
was how the report should be written.
The commission finally decided to
present the conclusion and then the
evidence which supported it. However,
this was not how the investigation
was conducted, he emphasized.
Liebeler felt that the commission
misjudged when it decided to omit
reports of investigations of peripheral
incidents. He noted that the commis
sion .after investigating these inci
dents, found no relation to the assassi

nation. They therefore decided not to
print the investigation reports.
"Perhaps we should have been more
articulate," he refleflcted. "Then we
could have foreclosed the criticisms
now being made. We should have
mentioned all the evidence we
weighed."
Human Errors
Liebeler explained that the transpo
sition of two frames in the film of the
assassination was a human error.
"There was a lot of sloppy work," he
said. The time schedule to get the re
port out did not affect the accuracy
of the investigation, he insisted, but he
felt more time should have been spent
on writting the report, proofreading,
and checking footnootes.
Liebeler assured the audience that
most lawyers were skeptical about
FBI reports after finding mistakes in
them. "The FBI are efficient guys, but
not positive."
Commenting on the classified in
formation being kept in the national
archives, Liebeler said two types of
material are being kept secret. One
names the ClA's confidential inform
ants. The other is material not rele
vant to the case, but personally dam
aging to the people involved.
Liebeler stated that he didn't know
where the pictures and x-rays of the
autopsy were but that the "general
consensus is that the Kennedy fam
ily has them. I predict they will be
made available." The original draft
of the autopsy was not burned, but is
printed in the report The doctor who
performed the autopsy burned his own
rough notes.
Explained 'Fixed' Photos
Liebeler explained that the cable
gram which the American embassy
in Russia sent to the State Depart
ment, and which Lane showed as
printed with 41 words missing, was
referring to two former dispatches.
He pointed out that this was printed
at the top of the cablegram, and was
a relevant fact which Lane failed to
mention.
In answer to questions from the

audience about the alleged doctored
picture of Lee Harvey Oswald on the
cover of Life magazine, Liebeler said
that photographic experts do not sup
port the theory that the head was
superimposed on the body. In addi
tion, they can prove that the picture
came from Oswald's camera. Liebeler
said he could not explain the differ
ence in the shadows from the nose
and body.
Another question raised by Lane
was the front of the Texas Book De
pository moments after the assassina
tion, showing a figure who resembled
Ruby. This figure was chopped out of
the picture printed in the report.
Liebeler speculated that all pictu**es
in that series of slides had been crop
ped in duplication processes to better
show the center of the picture. In a
later talk to a law class, he added
that he didn't believe the figure was
Ruby anyway.
Another question of fact was wheth
er the bullet which passed through
Kennedy and Governor Connally could

survive with just 3 grains missing.
Liebeler said investigation showed
this to be possible.
Uming And Motive
The timing of the shots and Os
wald's escape to the movie house, both
questioned by Lane, were plausible,
according to investigations carried out
by the Warren Commission.
As for motive, Liebeler said that no
psychiatric testimony was admitted
because it would be so conflicting. He
believes it would be impossible to tell
Oswald's motive even if he were alive
now and were to undergo psychiatric
examination.
The confusions over the point of en
trance and exit of the bullet, the dis
covery of the bullet on a stretcher in
the hospital, and the identification
of the rifle were attributed by Liebe
ler to the fact that in the rush of
initial questioning, unqualified people
were called upon to give reports. The
later, more official reports clear up
the conflicts, he stated.
