# Nobel Prize Winner Urges Genetic, Slum Problem Study
## 
### 
William Shockley, Stanford Univer
sity Nobel Laureate, yesterday sug
gested the initiation of a study on
the effects of genetic inheritance upon
human behavior relative to city-slum
problems.
Speaking to fellow members of the
National Academy of Sciences meet
ing at Duke University, Shockley
urged that racist implications in such
a study be ignored.
He stated that the "possibility of
significant research is . . . materially
impeded by the fact that such research
will inevitably bear on intelligence dis
tributions of ethnic minorities in gen
eral and American Negroes in partic
ular."
Oregon Study
Shockley stressed the need to find
new approaches and to establish facts
about the environment-heredity uncer
tainty. He described recent investiga
tions of the development of 47 Oregon
babies of schizophrenic mothers,
placed in normal environments im
mediately after birth.
"This study suggests that the
Jukes-Kallikak's bad heredity concept
may have been too enthusiastically re
jected by perfectionists," he said.
"About half the Oregon babies showed
mental disadvantages including men
tal deficiency, schizophrenia, criminal
ity, and discharge from the armed ser

vices for psychiatric and behavioral
reasons."
Emotional Reaction
Professor Shockley, who shared the
1956 Nobel Prize in physics, explained
his incursion into the field of genetics
as a reaction to colleagues' opinions
that "even the proposal that an ob
jective study be sought is doomed
to be smothered under an emotional
slogan."
The Stanford Nobel Laureate cited
a recent appeal by President Johnson
asking intellectuals to use their power
to evaluate the crux of the problem of
city-slums and to define it as acutely
as possible. Professor Shockley eval
uated the "marrow of the city-slum
problem to be our uncertainty about
its genetic aspects and our fear to ad
mit ignorance and to search openly for
relevant facts."
Few Studies Made
So little is known on the subject, he
added, that probably few educated peo
ple realize, for example, that studies
have shown how heridity controls in
telligence more than twice as much as
does environment in families that
adopt one of a pair of white identical
twins.
Shockley stated that human wel
fare programs already may have pro
duced a "socially relatively unadapt
able human strain."
