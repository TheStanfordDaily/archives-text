# Irish Writer Objects To Modern Criticism
## 
### JAN SHARPLESS 
Sean O'Faolain, Ireland's versatile
novelist, short story writer, critic, bio
grapher, and playwright, will lecture
on "The Novel â€” Trial by Pleasure" in
Dinkelspiel at 7:45.
O'Faolain believes that most modern
criticism is a kind of "cerebral analysis.
He contends that while the techniques
of fiction must be understood, the emo
tional experience must also be evalu
ated. He sees the problem as "whether
you can, by assessing the pleasure, as
sess the novel."
O'Faolain examines the nature of
pleasure in his book The Short Story:
A Study in Pleasure.
Exhilarating Atmosphere
Here under the auspices of the Crea
tive Writing Department, O'Faolain is
currently teaching at Boston College.
A Dublin resident, he likes to spend a
month or two every year in the U.S.'s
"exhilarating" atmosphere.
"America,"he says, "strikes the
foreigner as an amazingly uniform
country." He contrasts this apparent
uniformity with the variety of think
ing he has discovered in American stu
dents.
American Christian humanism de
mands a great deal of sophistication
and intelligence, and while there is con
siderable mental freedom in the U.S.,
he finds that it is not always utilized.
O'Faolain attributes the "wnat-the
hell" attitude of the country to the af
fluent society, but notes that this so
ciety is responsible for "attacked, as
sailed, and crumbled" values that chal
lenge the young writer.
life Burden
The young people of this generation
who are groping to remake their own
values are assuming a lifetime burden.
An unwillingness to be satisfied with
pat answers has created a generation
of writers who are more fissurated and
bombarded than those of O'Faolain's
youth. O'Faolain believes the Univer
sity should offer more aids to critical
evaluation through courses in philo
sophical thinking and logic.

O'Faolain teaches writing tutorially.
He conducts no classes and disap
proves of reading manuscripts aloud
because they are designed for the eye,
not the ear.
As a writer of both fiction and non
fiction, O'Faolain's greatest allegiance
is to the short story. He finds the story
more difficult to write than the novel
because its content can be as great as
that of the novel.
"Jewish Revival"
O'Faolain feels the influence of
Chekov and Maupassant in his own
writing and has a great respect for
many writers of his own generation,
among them V. S. Prichett and Eliza
beth Bowen. He, along with all of Eu
rope, is fascinated by the "Jewish Re
vival" in American literature.
O'Faoalain will be in the Union at
11:00 this morning to meet students in
formerly.
