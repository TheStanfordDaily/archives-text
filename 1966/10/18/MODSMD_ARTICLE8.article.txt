# No 'Backup' In SU Mail
## 
### 
Despite a backlog of third class mail
throughout the nation that threatened
to affect first class mail delivery, the
local office was an unnarried scene
of empty mail sacks and carts yester
day afternoon.
"There will be no delay in delivery,"
substantiates Mutz Furiya, Stanford
Branch Superintendant. "All 4,700
campus mail boxes and routes are re
ceiving up to date service."
"As soon as Stanford mail is re
ceived at the East Palo Alto Annex,
the outlet for all mail in the Menlo
Park to Sunnyvale area, it is sorted
and sent straight to us. We process it
immediately," Furiya explained.
The federal ban on overtime has not
appreciably affected the Stanford of
fice. With only twenty employees—ten
carriers and ten processors—overtime
was needed only when an employee
was ill and another had to work extra
to complete the work. "This branch
is known as a no-overtime office,"
Furiya stated.
Although area union officials blame
a "heavy work load" for part of the
delay in mail processing in Palo Alto,
Furiya claims that Stanford's carriers
are "not overworked." They are, how
ever, "steady, dependable workers who
have kept up with the load."
