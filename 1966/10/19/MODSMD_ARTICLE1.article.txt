# Rep Theater Opens 'Cleopatra' Tonight
## 
### SUE DONNELLY 
"Antony and Cleopatra," the first
major production of the Stanford Re
pi etory Theater's second season,
opens tonight at Memorial Audi
torium.
Erik Vos, director of the Shake
spearean tragedy, presented "That
Scoundrel Scapin" and "Prometheus
Bound" at Stanford last year.
Vos, who originally read Shake
speare in a foreign language, has
moved away from the conventional
Anglo-American interpretation.
He does not work from the tradi
tional approach, which emphasizes the
conflict between Egypt and Rome and
the prideful leaders which ruled them.
Instead, he presents the play as the
study of Antony, the Man, and what
motivates him.
Psychological Motives
His entire performance will center
on the psychological motives of An
tony rather than the historical and
love motives.
Consequently many scenes and fa
mous lines have been cut. The stage
in Memorial Auditorium is being re
constructed with a thrust, ramps and
a revolve and will extend into the
audience as in "Prometheus Bound."
The set has been designed as an ab
straction of the muscular-vascular
system of man, and the music simu
lates his biological inner workings.

Appearing in "Antony and Cleo
patra" are personalities established in
the Repertory Theater last year: Ger
ald Hiken, Paul E. Richards, Jerome
Raphel, and Glenn Cannon. Added to
the company this year are Morgan
Sterne and Loretta Leversee, popular
Broadway actors who are playing the
lead roles in the play, and Paul E.
Winfield and Gilbert Green from Los
Angeles, who play featured roles.
Director Vos will direct two one-act
plays for Little Theater productions
immediately following "Antony and
Cleopatra." After the openings of
"Gnadiges Fraulein" and "Out at
Sea", Vos will return to his native
Holland. He will be back to direct
later productions at the Stanford Re
pertory Theater in the coming sea
sons.
Future Productions
John Gay's 18th century musical
play, "The Beggar's Opera," perhaps
better known in its famous modern
adaption, "The Threepenny Opera,"
will be the second offering of the
Repertory Theater. Third-year grad
uate student John Wright will direct.
Wright is a candidate in the Master
of Fine Arts (M.F.A.) program.
Anton Chekhov's "The Cherry Or
chard" will open in March. This play
will be directed by Mel Shapiro, on
leave from New York University for
the production. He directed two plays
last season at Stanford.

Sterne and Loretta Leversee, popular
Broadway actors who are playing the
lead roles in the play, and Paul E.
Winfield and Gilbert Green from Los
Angeles, who play featured roles.
Director Vos will direct two one-act
plays for Little Theater productions
immediately following "Antony and
Cleopatra." After the openings of
"Gnadiges Fraulein" and "Out at
Sea", Vos will return to his native
Holland. He will be back to direct
later productions at the Stanford Re
pertory Theater in the coming sea
sons.
Future Productions
John Gay's 18th century musical
play, "The Beggar's Opera," perhaps
better known in its famous modern
adaption, "The Threepenny Opera,"
will be the second offering of the
Repertory Theater. Third-year grad
uate student John Wright will direct.
Wright is a candidate in the Master
of Fine Arts (M.F.A.) program.
Anton Chekhov's "The Cherry Or
chard" will open in March. This play
will be directed by Mel Shapiro, on
leave from New York University for
the production. He directed two plays
last season at Stanford.
"Antony and Cleopatra," the first
major production of the Stanford Re
pi etory Theater's second season,
opens tonight at Memorial Audi
torium.
Erik Vos, director of the Shake
spearean tragedy, presented "That
Scoundrel Scapin" and "Prometheus
Bound" at Stanford last year.
Vos, who originally read Shake
speare in a foreign language, has
moved away from the conventional
Anglo-American interpretation.
He does not work from the tradi
tional approach, which emphasizes the
conflict between Egypt and Rome and
the prideful leaders which ruled them.
Instead, he presents the play as the
study of Antony, the Man, and what
motivates him.
Psychological Motives
His entire performance will center
on the psychological motives of An
tony rather than the historical and
love motives.
Consequently many scenes and fa
mous lines have been cut. The stage
in Memorial Auditorium is being re
constructed with a thrust, ramps and
a revolve and will extend into the
audience as in "Prometheus Bound."
The set has been designed as an ab
straction of the muscular-vascular
system of man, and the music simu
lates his biological inner workings.

Appearing in "Antony and Cleo
patra" are personalities established in
the Repertory Theater last year: Ger
ald Hiken, Paul E. Richards, Jerome
Raphel, and Glenn Cannon. Added to
the company this year are Morgan
Sterne and Loretta Leversee, popular
Broadway actors who are playing the
lead roles in the play, and Paul E.
Winfield and Gilbert Green from Los
Angeles, who play featured roles.
