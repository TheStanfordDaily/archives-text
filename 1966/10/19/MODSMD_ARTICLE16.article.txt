## Bergman's Virgin Spring At TMU Friday 
### Steve Lavine STEVE LAVINE 
Virgin Spring (Bergman, 1959)
'is the TMU film this Friday. It is
for superior to other Bergman
films thus far shown at Tresid
-der this quarter. The story is set
•tin 14th Century Sweden.
I; A young girl on her way to
►'Mass is raped and murdered by
two vagabonds. The vagabonds
\and their younger brother stum
\ble on the home of the girl and
/unknowingly try to sell the girl's
;«clothing to her own mother. They
are discovered and killed by the
girl's knightly father.
> The conflict that existed be
tween paganism and Christianity
;* at this time is woven into the
■ film. The girl's mother (played
by Brigitta Valberg) is a devout
!: Christian. The girl's maid (play
. Ed by Gunnel Lindbolm) still
believes in the Norse gods.
The blending of these two
backgrounds is seen in the girl' 6
father (played by Max von Sy
dow). When his daughter is
killed he acts by the pre-Chris
tian code of conduct and takes
! his revenge. He does this me
thodically and unthinkingly.
• It is what he must do. Later,
! when his revenge is complete, he
; raises his hands to God to ask
for forgiveness.
Best Part
Then, in what is the most mov
ing passage of the film, he asks
God why He let it all happen.
Once again Bergman's spiritual
problem comes to the fore. What
kind of God is it who lets all
the terrible things of the earth
come about?
The feeling of the Middle Ages
is maintained throughout the
film. The sets could not be more
convincing. The photography is
by two Bergman regulars: Sven
Nykvist and Rolf Halmquist.
The acting, particularly of Max
von Sydow, the knight of The
Seventh Seal, is excellent.
The film is more completely
additive than any I have seen
in quite some time. The Silence,
for example, consists of a series
of cliches that do not add to one
another but instead remain com
pletely distinct throughout the
film. In Virgin Spring, each ele
ment, each camera angle, adds to
the whole. Nothing seems ex
traneous or unintegrated.
If you should decide to see
Virgin Spring it wo Id be wise
to buy your tickets well ahead
of time. Judging from the re
sponse to the other Bergman
films at Tresidder, Virgin Spring
should be sold out.
I-Center Film
\ The International Center film
t tonight is Open City (Rossel-
Jlini). Made in 1945, Open City
► tells the story of the under

ground resistance during the
German occupation of Rome. A
communist underground leader
and a priest work together to
undermine the German forces.
The two are betrayed and ar
rested. The underground leader
Is tortured to death while the
priest watches. Then the priest
is executed.
Open City was one of the key
films to be made in Italy im
mediately following the second

World War. During the war,
Mussolini's regime had created
the Centro Sperimentale, a film
school in Rome. The output of
the directors of the Centro was
closely watched and no real crea
tivity was allowed. Bad propa
ganda films were their chief
product.
In 1942, Umbei*to Barbaro, a
teacher at the Centro, wrote an
attack on Italian lilm-making. In
the same year, Luchino Visconti

made his first major film, Ossea
sione.
Neo- Realism
With Barbaro, the word neo
realism was given to the Italian
film industry and with Visconti,
a trly neo-realistic film. Os
sesslone remained a relatively
obscure film, talked about but
not seen, and it was Open City,
made three years later, that
spread the gospel of neo-realism
to the rest of the world.

Virgin Spring (Bergman, 1959)
'is the TMU film this Friday. It is
for superior to other Bergman
films thus far shown at Tresid
-der this quarter. The story is set
•tin 14th Century Sweden.
I; A young girl on her way to
►'Mass is raped and murdered by
two vagabonds. The vagabonds
\and their younger brother stum
\ble on the home of the girl and
/unknowingly try to sell the girl's
;«clothing to her own mother. They
are discovered and killed by the
girl's knightly father.
> The conflict that existed be
tween paganism and Christianity
;* at this time is woven into the
■ film. The girl's mother (played
by Brigitta Valberg) is a devout
!: Christian. The girl's maid (play
. Ed by Gunnel Lindbolm) still
believes in the Norse gods.
The blending of these two
backgrounds is seen in the girl' 6
father (played by Max von Sy
dow). When his daughter is
killed he acts by the pre-Chris
tian code of conduct and takes
! his revenge. He does this me
thodically and unthinkingly.
• It is what he must do. Later,
! when his revenge is complete, he
; raises his hands to God to ask
for forgiveness.
Best Part
Then, in what is the most mov
ing passage of the film, he asks
God why He let it all happen.
Once again Bergman's spiritual
problem comes to the fore. What
kind of God is it who lets all
the terrible things of the earth
come about?
The feeling of the Middle Ages
is maintained throughout the
film. The sets could not be more
convincing. The photography is
by two Bergman regulars: Sven
Nykvist and Rolf Halmquist.
The acting, particularly of Max
von Sydow, the knight of The
Seventh Seal, is excellent.
The film is more completely
additive than any I have seen
in quite some time. The Silence,
for example, consists of a series
of cliches that do not add to one
another but instead remain com
pletely distinct throughout the
film. In Virgin Spring, each ele
ment, each camera angle, adds to
the whole. Nothing seems ex
traneous or unintegrated.
If you should decide to see
Virgin Spring it wo Id be wise
to buy your tickets well ahead
of time. Judging from the re
sponse to the other Bergman
films at Tresidder, Virgin Spring
should be sold out.

realism was given to the Italian
film industry and with Visconti,
a trly neo-realistic film. Os
sesslone remained a relatively
obscure film, talked about but
not seen, and it was Open City,
made three years later, that
spread the gospel of neo-realism
to the rest of the world.
