## New Drama Group To Take All Frosh 
### 
FINE ARTS EDITOR, RISSA WHITE

"The freshmen are about to
happen this Christmas," was the
way English professor Larry
Friedlander described a new
frosh drama group.
Friedlander and Mark Mirsky
of the freshman English Depart
ment's Voice Project are pres
ently working with the group,
although they plan to turn the
project's direction over to the
freshmen once it gets going.
The drama group wa6 first
conceived as an informal pro
gram for freshmen interested in
all aspects of dramatic produc
tion. Friendlander remarked that
the need for such a group arose
when students who had become
interested in drama in high
school found that the Stanford
department was mostly for seri
ous drama students. There was
no place for a large number of
freshmen who had interest but
not necessarily great talent.
In addition to acting, students
are working with vocal and in
strumental music, design, set
construction, publicity and sec
retarial work, and directing.
Voice Project is urging all
freshmen to participate. Meet
ings are Sunday at 7:30 p.m.
The opportunity for extensive
class participation is made pos
sible by the unusual nature of
the plays to be presented. The

plays scheduled for December 4
In front of Memorial Church are
medieval mystery cycles.
Friedlander and Mirsky ex
plained that these mystery plays
were originally performed in
pageant style by amateurs, mem
bers of the different guilds of
the medieval towns. The pres
entation was informal, largely
extemporaneous, and involved
the audience. The plays, which
center around medieval inter
pretations of Biblical characters,
are energetic, exciting and farci
cal, employing juxtaposition and
irony to create humor.
The two plays to be presented
are The Shepherds' Play from
the Chester cycle and the Wake
field Masters' Magnus Herod.
