# 20 Years Of Short Stories Competent, But Not Great

### BRUCE MERRY 
Twenty Years of Stanford Short
Stories, edited by Wallace
Stegner iind Richard Scow
croft with Nancy Parker
(Stan University Press), $2.95.
A story must have a begin
ning, a middle and an end—how
I fear least Maugham may have
died and taken these words to
the grave with him.
The best piece in this collec
tion is the introduction by Pro
fessor Stegrier. He decides, cor
rectly, that it is valid for univer
sities to finance an art which
society itself will not maintain.
Short stories, he prescribes,
should have limitation of scope,
singleness, concentration and
sharpness of focus. This is all
very well, but the snake In the
grass is competence.
Competent, But Not Great
Competent art is not great
art, which is the contempt of
great men lor small art. There
is no point in writing compe
tently. A book which does not
aim at great ness is not our busi
ness. Such an author should re
tire into advertising or journal
ism. The only excuse for such
collections as this one is that
shadow of occasional greatness
which darkens the radiant har
vest of competence.
Are there such shadows here?
There are a handful, so I ad
vise you to read them all in
order to detect those lantent

shades of greatness. I have an
uncompromising view of literary
exercise: II faut vivre, and for
many of us that means II faut
ecrire. But nearly thirty years
later Connolly's dictum has still
not grafted; "The more we read,
the more we realize that the
only purpose of writing a book
is to create a masterpiece."
Banal Subjects
At least two stories in this
collection give the unfortunate
impression that all that budding
authors from America take back
from Europe is the warning sign
on train-windows and the smell
of salami. Thus there are a few
stories which I would condemn
as merely bad: particularly
tasteless is Ferrone's trip to
Rome—About My Sons (1952)—
with its 'unpaved; unweathered;
unlandscaped; unwrapped* in the
first paragraph.
It is loaded with the more ob
vious Italian names for food and
wine, all neatly italicised in the
text except for lira; lire. The
Italians he meets were loud and
scuffy, said, "Sonnamonbitch"
and patted their paunches. That
they married women 10 years
younger than themselves I doubt
was ever true in Italy.
Several other stories treat
banal subjects. They relate the
tiny dramas of squabbling
spouses or family politics. Mlsb
Packer's sad Grandpa; Miss Ger
ber's young couple at a Jewish

funeral; Mr. Shrubb's, the ab
surdest nonentity of the lot, with
a pregnant woman's husband
battling to communicate this
news to his Aussie parents.
Pregnancy and child-raising are
not the stuff of great stores.
That is partly why Stone's Ger
aldine (1964), though a little
precious, gets an "A," together
with stories like Teethe Wood,
No Game for Children (1951,
1955) and Our Felix, by Edgar
Rosenberg (1953), the finest flow
of consciousness I have ever
read from a student's pen.
War Stories
Obviously, war-stories were
staple-diet in the Stanford writ
ing classes just after the holo
caust. Illinois and death are also
a favorite choice in this collec
tion; combined with gruesome
sentimentality in Ravita, The
Lady Walks by Jean Powell
(1950). Even .01' Nick's Wife by
David Dow (1958), Crawford's
The Boats (1952) and Sue David
son's The City of The Angels
(1951) spoiled otherwise good
ideas by a mixture of compe
tence and, quite often, the most
mawkish sentimentality.
Girls in pubescence and moth
ers grappling with adolescent
children are not great literature:
adultery, a theme I should have
liked to have seen traced through
a story somewhere in the book,
nowhere raised its head; though
Ravita had been naughty enough
to have taken a lover before her
nice professor.
Susan Kuehn's The Searchers
(1951) tells of an infant lost in
a forest for whom I can feel
no compassion. Nothing about
the lost child is told us in the
story. A bit like Godot! The man
who thinks over a grapefruit
that his life left him conveys
nothing to me personally. His
ham thoughts about Proust do
not save the story from a "C."
Arnold's Problem in Creation
is good, though sentimental; get
on and make love, one feels like
shouting in the closing para
graph. Ilyin's Down The Road A
Piece (1948) was stirring and
gave us nice insights into the
mind of a child. It too ends
weakly. Lecocq's Behold A Pale
Horse Is all very well If one
likes that kind of thing: a nice
girl afraid of a dirty man. Per
sonally, I think a stiff dose of
the Concourt Journals would do
most of these writers no harm.
Neither Wit Nor Sex
There are very few jokes in
the collection; wit and sex are
not present in any broad con
tours and few of the authors
give us a character outside their
own sex or generation, a tech
nique I always think is the dis
tinguishing mark of the great
writer.
