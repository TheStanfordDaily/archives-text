# Williams Praised Sherman "Sharp"
## 
### NICK SELBY 
(Note: The following inter
view took place at the urging of
The Daily sports editors, who
felt that the Stanford commu
nity needed specific answers to
questions about this year's foot
ball team and the USC game in
particular.)
Q. Who had the responsibility
of preventing USC quarterback
Troy Winslow from running to
the outside where he had so
much time to pass? (See Dia
gram.)
Coach Ralston: As our de
fense is set up, the tackle (post
man) is responsible for cutting
off the outside on this type of
pass play. The end has the re
sponsibility of covering the tight
end in the flat and the short
hook zone. As it happened, USC
was knocking down our tackle
and Winslow could run to the

outside and had a lot of time.
Later in the game, we cut off the
outside and stalled their offense.
Q. Who has responsibility for
other USC receivers, and what
happened on the first two passes
of the game and the 32 yarder to
Sherman, USC's flanker? (See
Diagram.)
Ralston: The two linebackers
have no responsibility for pass
coverage on these plays. They
are inside and are to rush. The
halfback is to cover the flanker,
and the defensive end will cover
the tight end. Winslow was so
sharp, however, at the start of
the game that we were unable
to stop him from completing this
pass although we had good cov
erage.
As for the 32 yard pass play,
Sherman was lined up inside of
their 6plit end Drake. Our half
back picked up Drake and the
safety should have picked up
Sherman. There was a break
down of communication, and
Sherman was free as he ran up
the sideline.
Q. Why was there so much
pressure on Williams when USC
kept back six, and sometimes
seven men for pass coverage?
Rahston: I think first you have
to complement Williams for the
fine job he did at quarterback. It
was his first start and he com
pleted 14 of 26 passes. Basicly,
we were protecting well and had
no problems when USC rushed
only four men. But, USC came
up with new stunts by their
guards and linebackers. We ex
pected the linebackers to rush
to the outside.
Instead, the linebackers rushed
to the inside. The USC guards
moved to the outside, and our
guards moved with them, leav
ing a corridor up the middle to

Williams. During the hall, we
told the guards to keep to the
inside and let the tackles take
care of the defensive guards.
In the second half, we kept the
linebackers out pretty well. The
guards were not at faultâ€”USC
Just surprised us.
Q. What was the reason for
the interception by USC's Eld
King during the second quarter?
This interception set up the third
touchdown.
Ralston: Chuck (Williams)
just didn't see him. He was not
pressured into letting the ball
go early. He saw Conrad open
and floated a soft one to him.
King, who is the USC roving
defensive back, had a good line
on the pass and had an easy job
of intercepting it. Even on the
films we had a tough time seeing
King coming in.
Q.About your run-pass option

play, are you going to use Dave
Lewis more frequently? Will
Gene Washington throw more
often from the roll out? It seems
as though he forgets about the
pass and decides to run Im
mediately.
Ralston: With Dave, it's been
a matter of his not being able to
throw the ball. This week we
plan to use him more now that
he's better. In Gene's case, we
would like to use the pass off the
roll out more often. He's had
trouble picking up the pass pat
tern and then sometimes its' just
been a straight running play.
Q. How can you get the team
to play at the start of the game?
I mean, against San Jose you
were behind but managed to
come back, and against Minne
sota and USC you fell behind
at the start and couldn't come
back. The best win of the year
was against Tulane, in which
you grabbed the lead early.
What happened with USC?
Ralston: Getting started on
the right foot has been one of
our biggest problems all season,
and I'm not sure what we can do
about it. In the USC game, it
was not so much our not being
ready, as it was a case of Wins
low being super-sharp.
Q. What was your final anal
ysis of the USC game?
Ralston: We had three scor
ing opportunities and only took
advantage of one of them. If we
had scored each time we were in
side the ten yard line, we would
have had 21 points. If we could
have avoided the one intercep
tion in the second quarter, we
could have won 21-14. We had
the chances to win the game.
Our boys played real well, but
USC was tremendous.


The post man for Stanford has the responsibility for keeping 1 Wins
low from running to the outside, but he is blocked before he can
cut him off. Winslow then has time to throw to the tight end, who
should be covered by Stanford's defensive end.
