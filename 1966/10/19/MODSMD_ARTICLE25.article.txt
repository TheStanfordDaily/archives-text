# Stanford Cross Country Team To Host Spartans
## 
### GREG PSALTER 
Despite the fact that Stan
ford's cross country team was
defeated by California and USC
last week, Coach Jerry Barland
was enthusiastic about the im
provement made by the individ
uals as well as the team as a
whole.
Barland's runners showed
great improvement over the
times recorded two weeks ago
at a time trial. The top five var
sity runners all improved upon
their individual times.
The team time was 3 minutes
and 8 seconds better than two
weeks ago. Barland also pointed
out that the team time was 1
minute and 28 seconds better
than Stanford's best time as a
team on the home course all last
year.
Letterer In Top Ten
Jim Letterer, who finished as
the Indians' top man, improved
his time 49 seconds over two
weeks ago and in so doing, earn
ed the number eight spot in the
all-time top ten Stanford run
ners.
Both Brook Thomas and
Randy Hyvonen have good shots
at making the top ten this week.
Thomas is 7 seconds from being
tenth and Hyvonen is 24 seconds
away. The two improved their
previous best times by 37 and
19 seconds, respectively.
Saturday's meet will be with
San Jose State. According to
Barland, San Jose State should
be ranked nationally. They won
the Sacramento Invitational
meet with 32 points, with second
place California far behind with
110 points.
Has Confidence
Barland isn't about to concede
the meet, though. He feels that
the Indians will give San Jose
State a good run and that the
outcome will depend heavily on
individual pride.
Concerning the freshmen,
Stanford will be favored on the

strength of their Sacramento
Invitational victory.
In last week's meet, the fresh
men also showed considerable
improvement. All seven of Stan
ford's runners improved their
time by at least 11 seconds. The
team time improved 1 minute
and 51 seconds. The freshman
team is only 31 seconds away
from the all-time best freshman
team time on the Stanford
course.

Running for the Indian var
sity, in addition to Letterer,
Thomas and Hyvonen, will be
Bob Kelly, Bob Anbhondo, John
Boechan and Bruce Sramek. The
varsity race will begin at 10 a.m.
at the second tee of the Stan
ford Golf Course.
The freshmen will run Chuck

Masse. This race will begin at

Barland encouraged Stanford
backers to come out to watch

He emphasized that the course
is an unusually good one for
spectators.
