# OPEN DISCUSSION
## Athletic Council Meets 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER Sports Editor 
Thirty-one athleties represent
ing Stanford's 14 varsity teams
met Monday evening to draw up
the governing articles and elect
officers to the Stanford Student-
Athletic Council.
The main goal of the Council
will be to open and widen chan
nels of communication between
student-athletes and the Physi
cal Education and Athletics De
partment administration.
The Council, though it has
precedent in earlier athlete
groups such as the Block Sand
Captain's Table, evolved into its
present expanded, representative
organization following contro
versy within the athletic frame
work last spring.
Recommend Improvements
The Council will recommend
changes in policy and suggest
methods of improvement to the
Athletic Director, Charles A.
Taylor. The Council will also
serve as a grievance board for
student-athletes.
Don Swartz, who was instru
mental in the preliminary orga
nization of the Council, was
elected Chairman. Monty Orr
was elected Vice-Chairman, and
Craig Baise Secretary. Swartz
repijesents the football team,
Orr rugby, and Baise tennis.
Two members of the Council
will be elected by their team
mates each year. Squads with
greater than fifty members (jun
ior varsity included) will have
four representatives on the
Council.
Freshman athletes will be rep
resented by the varsity council
member from their sport under
the present framework. This
topic will be brought up again
when the Council meets later
this quarter.
Nominate Board Members
The Student-Athlete Council
will nominate panels to be con
sidered for the Student-Faculty
Athletic Board and the Alumni
Athletic Board. The Council will
also place members on the Buck
Club Board. Approval of a
LASSU representative will be
sought.
Taylor commented after the

meeting, "I am extremely
pleased that the athletes have
been organized in a representa
tive manner. I think that this
way they certainly will have a
greater voice in Department pol
icy and cannot help but improve
avenues of communication with
the Department."

There are some 800 students
participating in Stanford inter
collegiate athletics.
Swartz saw the Council as
growing from a lessening of de
pendence on tradtion in athletics
and an increasing interest and in
dividual concern in what gov
erns their realm of activity. ;
