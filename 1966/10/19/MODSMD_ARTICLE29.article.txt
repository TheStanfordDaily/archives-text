## 'Uniquack' Looks At Stanford 
### Robert E. Stone 
In an attempt to understand
the mysterious workings of the
various parts of Stanford, we
recently made a trip to Wash
ington, D.C. in order to have
access to Uniquack, the gigantic
electric brain in the basement of
the capital office of the New
York Times.
Uniquack is owned and oper
ated by James Reston, and Mr.
Reston was good enough to in
terrupt his program on De-
Gaulle to have the machine an
swer some of our questions.
Q: What is the basic philoso
phy of Stanford University?
A: Stanford is a residence
university.
Q: Just what does that mean?
A: All students must live
within twenty minutes driving
time of the campus.
Q: Is Stanford the Harvard
of the West or is Harvard the
Stanford of the East?
A: Stanford is Stanford and
Harvard is Harvard and never
the twain shall meet.
Near Future
Q: What are some of the
problems that Stanford must
overcome in the near future?
A: Dave Harris, Lassu, ade
quate facilities for an increasing
number of students, social regu
lations, birth control, open
house hours, and the football
team.
Q: Can we take those one at
a time?
A: Sure.
Q: Let's start from the begin
ning. What is the problem with
Dave Harris?
A: Dave Harris is the type of
leader which causes the stu
dents to think. Thinking stu
dents cause a problem for ad
ministrators. If Harris is al
lowed to continue in his radical
ways the damage done to the
delicate balance between stu
dents and administrators may
never be repaired.
Dangerous To Think
Q: Is it really dangerous for
students to think?
A: In general, no. Any sud
den change in time honored at
titudes, however, can leave
people confused and not know
ing how to act.
Q: How does LASSU figure
into this problem?
A: LASSU members are no
torious for their single-minded
ness. Every member is an ex
pert on parliamentary proce
dure and nothing else. There is
specifically a rule that no one
in LASSU is allowed to think.
The conflict that must inevitably
arise between LASSU and Har
ris can only have disastrous re
sults, and will seriously hamper
any attempts to further student
aims.
Little Publicized
Q: Are social regs really a
problem ?
Q: What are the adequate fa
cilities to which you referred?
A: It is a well-known, though
Miile publicized, fact that there
is not enough housing on cam
pus to accommodate all Stan
ford students. The time is com
ing when the administration is
going to become quite embar
rassed about this situation. Fur
thermore, the facilities of the
student union were out of date
before they were ever com
pleted. There is no campus cof
feehouse, and not enough stu
dent parking places. These prob
lems must be corrected or the
students will take things into

their own hands. It is even pos
sible that they might eject the
President of the university from
his office if their demands are
not met.
Q: I though that the question
of social regulations had been
resolved long ago?
A: Not at all. It is true that
the social regs committee of the
AWS voted itself out of exist
ence last year, but social regs
still exist. Most students feel
that these regulations are ana
chronistic. Unfortunately, AWS
is not prepared to make any
proposals without the consent of
the female student-body, and
campus coeds are afraid, by and
large, to challenge the existing
status quo. It appears that the
pressure to abolish social regs
is going to come from the male
part of the campus.
Really A Problem?
A: Not really. The concept of
In loco parentis, however, is re
pugnant to most Stanford stu
dents, and social regs are close
ly tied to this concept. I predict
that they will go.
Q: Is their a connection be
tween the administrations desire
for social regs and the recent
clamor about oral contracep
tives?
A: No. The two questions are
completely separate. Obviously
any acts of a sexual nature can
be carried out just as well be
fore 2:30 as after it. The birth
control problem at Stanford is
double. First, students feel that

the University Health Service is
under an obligation to provide
them with the best in medical
care upon request. Second, and
more important, most students
feel that the University is vio
lating First Amendment liber
ties by enforcing prior censor
ship on sex.
Q: Is the problem of open
house hours related to either so
cial regs or birth control?
A: Open house hours are only
a problem because the adminis
tration and LASSU have differ
ent rules and at the moment
there is no evidence that either
side is about to yield to the oth
er. This could cause a very tick
lish situation. Impasses are not
beneficial to peace co-exist
ence.
Football Team
Q: What is the problem with
the football team?
A: I give up. I have analyzed
the situation from all sides and
there is no reason on earth why
Stanford should not be in the
Rose Bowl.
Q: Is the root of the problem
wi'h the players or the coaches?
A: I would have to say that
the problem is attitude.
Q: Attitude?
A: Of players, coaches and
students. There just isn't any
spirit.
Q: What would you suggest?
A: I'm sorry. I have only been
programmed to answer factual
questions. I can't think. I am
only a machine.
