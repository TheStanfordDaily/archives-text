Dear President Sterling::
It has no doubt come to your attention through The Daily
or word of mouth that a group of undergraduate women has
evolved this quarter which seeks an immediate revision of Uni
versity policy requiring them to live on-campus. We regard this
policy, since it does not apply to men also, as discriminatory
and out of keeping with Stanford as it has evolved in recent
years. The fact that a Stanford student is a woman in no
way means that she is more temperamentally suited to dorm
living, or less capable of assuming responsibility for herself
off-campus than a man would be. For some, dorm life hampers
academic work, or imposes a real financial burden, or does
not allow them necessary personal privacy. Since dorm living,
either as it exists now or with projected improvements, is un
suitable for these women, they should be allowed to share the
option men have now.
Indeed, to those of us who have organized to change present
policy in this matter, and to the over fifty per cent of the un
dergraduate women who signed the enclosed petition, the ques
tion is not whether or not we should be able to move off
campus if we choose, but when the change will come about.
Since many of us are seniors, who have lived three years in
dorms and are ready to move off-campus, we urge that the
policy revision be made immediately. Of course, we realize the
ramifications and complications of such a change are many,
but serious thought and work on the part of students, faculty
and administrators is sure to find good solutions to any
problems which may arise.
We would appreciate it if you bring this issue before the
Trustees in the near future. Perhaps a copy of this letter to
each Trustee would provide a starting place. LASSU and The
Dally are receiving copies also. Please give consideration to
this matter immediately; many people are eager to receive
your concrete response.
JANET HOWELL
