## Political Expediency, Confidence Test Form Basis Of Appointment Dispute 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
The issue of the appointments
to the Committee of Fifteen is
a very interesting one — much
moreso than the business
men agreeing with Bob Haas
that business is really just a
question of MORE but adding
that today's forward looking stu
dent wants his MORE creatively.
In fact the appointments are a
test of confidence. If Harris Is
consistently seen only as a "rad
ical campus leader," there is no
possibility that LASSU or the
student body will back him up
on their programs. Dave was
elected not so much on a plat
form of issues but because he
said quite bluntly that only the
student body can effectively
change the campus environment.
It is this issue—the right of stu
dents at Stanford and of young
people throughout the country
to mold their own lives—which
is at the root of the current con
troversy.
Neither Handke nor Depres
can be considered way out on a
political spectrum. Their con
cern, like Harris', is an honest
and deep one. I can not see them
creating trouble out of non exis
tent problems. On the other
hand, they, like Harris, will not
run away from a confrontation
in the event that the University
should become stubborn or ar
rogant as it did, for instance, in
the contraceptive issue.
The question, quite simply, is
one of political expediency. Har
ris ran on this question. He said

that if the University would not
or could not reform, students
would have to reform it. And he
pulled off a remarkable victory.
Will the student body stand be
hind these principles?
If LASSU acts like Harris is
misrepresenting hi s mandate
and refuses to seat Jan Handke,
Dave should resign or ask the
student body to reaffirm or deny
its backing of a policy of real
university reform.
One reason for having solid
and firm representatives on the
Committee of Fifteen is that real
changes in university policy will
not come from the concept of
"shared" or "consultatory" de
cision-making. It would be more
significant, at this time to push
for immediate token representa
tion on the Board of Trustees
and the Academic Council just
so that student views will be rep
resented and voiced to the fac
ulty and Trusttes, and so that
students can see how decisions
are made. Progress, in the long
run, will come only with faculty
backing of reforms. The token
representative idea would open
meetings of the Trustees and
Council to the academic commu
nity. Both groups would be
forced to justify their decisions
in the context of academic free
dom and intellectual ideals. Here,
unlike the Cl 5, faculty-student
allegiance could easily develop.
We need people in student gov
ernment who will seek such al
ternatives. In the past we have
seen student governments that

did little more than squeal when
their collective feet were stepped
on. MARC SAFER
• Disenchanted
Editor, The Dally:
While viewing the misamago
ric abyss that was last Saturday
afternoon, it struck us just how
fortunate we are to have that
one saving grace whose bound
less wit and swarthy charm
are the highlight, nay the pin
nacle, of any abyss—Super and
his supers. It is not so much his
flawless sense of timing, nor in
deed his impelling and
ing vocabulary, that are here to
be lauded, and which indeed are
inestimable, but rather the dra
matic and universal rapport
which he spontaneously estab
lishes with the chanting thou
sands. For it is this one quality
above all others which gives uni
fying substance to the jeering
section which is Stanford.

• Junior Birdmen
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to object to the
presence of student police at
the Sunday night "flicks." This
arm-banded junior gestapo rep
resents a deliberate attempt by
the administration to stifle the
creative efforts of Stanford stu
dents. The most open of all stu
dent fora at Stanford is being
harshly subjected to stringent
restrictions. I cite one example

of this flagrant imposition upon
the rights of Stanford students.
One young man, a member of
that great Wilbur domicile, Ce
dro House, was participating in
a synchronized cheer when he
was evicted by der stromtroop
enheiners. His initials, R.F. (the
initials have been changed to
protect the innocent), have been
incorporated eternally into the
American dialect. We at Cedro
reverence those precious letters.
Meanwhile, back to the point:
the presence of minutemen at
the "flicks." Attendance at the
"flicks" is not mandatory; it is
an individual decision. A person
can decide to attend this mani
festation of student individuali
ty, or he can stay home. If he
comes to the "flicks," he should
know what to expect. He should
come knowing that: he will
learn many new vocabulary
words, he will see a silent mo
vie, and he will often find him
self unconsciously participating
in the inspiratory, spontaneous,
and sometimes, choral yells.
Certainly a secret police isn't
needed, for those who come to
the "flicks" should know what
to expect.
The presence of these authori
tarian hirelings dampens the
spirit of the "flicks." People go
to the "flicks" to release ten
sion and have fun. As long as
these mighty mice remain, none
of the tremendous educative and
purgative potential of the
"flicks" can be realized.
