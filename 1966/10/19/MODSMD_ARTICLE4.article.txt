# Seca Entries Due Friday
## 
### RENTON ROLPH 
Friday, October 21, is the last day
that entries will be accepted for the
fourth annual Lagunita Seca races
to be held this Sunday, October 23.
The main event will start at 1:30
p.m. following a warm-up session at

Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternities have
organized the races into three divi
sions: American cars, foreign cars,
and a special Powder Puff division for
the ladies. A 16-gallon keg will be
awarded to the winner in each divi
sion.
Safer
The course this year is faster and
safer than ever, according to the
sponsors of the race. Traction should
be excellent because they have de
cided not to wet down the track.
However, the course will not be en
tirely dry since a glorious mud-hole
has been strategically installed.
Other obstacles on the dry bed of
Lake Lagunita include: a two-foot
ditch, a full-circle run-around, and

numerous S-turns. And to give drivers
maximum challenge and fans the
maximum satisfaction of a close-up
view, the track runs by the spectator
area.
Old time spectators and racers will
be happy to learn that the original
Sam Barsi jump spectacular is fea
tured among the obstacles for Sunday.
Few can forget the frenzied excite
ment generated by Sam's classic race
of three years ago in which he crossed
the finish line on three wheels, com
pletely out of control.
Last Year
Last year's race almost equalled
Sam Darsi's original when the timers
and judges only narrowly escaped a
reviewing area.
One valiant female, Missy Ghost of
Stillman House, is anxious to find a
car to enter in the Powder PufT class.
She will pay her own entry fee and
thus double some enthusiast's chance
of winning a keg.
The entrance Ls ten dollars. To en
ter, contact Rock Hatch at the Deke
House.
