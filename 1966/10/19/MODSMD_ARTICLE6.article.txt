# Kreisberg Deems China Revolutionary

### GEOFFREY STEVENS 
Predicting that relations between
the United States and Red China are
likely to become more complex, Paul
Kreisberg yesterday reviewed past
and present American and Chinese
foreign policies.
Speaking in Dinkelspiel to an audi
ence of several hundred, Kreisberg,
who is in charge of mainland China
affairs for the State Department,
maintained that China is not cur
rently interested in improving its re
lations with the United States. Except
for a few proposals made in 1954 for
exchange programs, China's attitude
toward the U.S. has been basically
"hostile."
According to Kreisberg, the Chinese
ideological commitment to hostility
has produced a split with the other
major Communist nations, which be
lieve in the possibility of peaceful co
existence.
Revolutionary Power
Kreisberg called China the "revolu
tionary power of the world" because
of its belief in violence as the only
means for change. He termed the
United States the "status quo power"
because of its desire for non-violent
change. Although the Chinese are bel
ligerent in their public statements,
Kreisberg pointed out that they are
reluctant to begin open warfare.
He characterized American foreign
policy in Asia as an attempt "to make
their hostility unsuccessful." Hear

gued that if the Chinese are forced
to recognize that their foreign policy
won't work and if they recognize that
their domestic problems might be
solved better through cooperation
with the United States, then there
will be a "greater community of in
terests" which will lead to better re
lations.
The United States military Activity
in South Vietnam is designed to prove
to China that wars of liberation are
impractical. Kreisberg did not explain
why these conflicts are impractical
for China if the United States is obili
ged to fight several long guerilla cam
paigns.
Official Recognition
On the issue of recognizing Red
China, Mr. Keisberg stated that no
purpose would be served by recogni
tion of China. He added that the
United States deals with Red China
on a "de facto" basis in Poland.
The United States will continue to
oppose Red China's admission to the
United Nations, Kreisberg said, as
long as they demand that Nationalist
China be expelled from the Security
Council.
In the interest of improving rela
tions, Kreisberg concluded, the United
States should try to convince China
that it won't invade Chinese territory.
The United States should avoid a ma
jor conflict with China and should
offer possibilities for contact with
China.

China be expelled from the Security
Council.
In the interest of improving rela
tions, Kreisberg concluded, the United
States should try to convince China
that it won't invade Chinese territory.
The United States should avoid a ma
jor conflict with China and should
offer possibilities for contact with
China.
Predicting that relations between
the United States and Red China are
likely to become more complex, Paul
Kreisberg yesterday reviewed past
and present American and Chinese
foreign policies.
Speaking in Dinkelspiel to an audi
ence of several hundred, Kreisberg,
who is in charge of mainland China
affairs for the State Department,
maintained that China is not cur
rently interested in improving its re
lations with the United States. Except
for a few proposals made in 1954 for
exchange programs, China's attitude
toward the U.S. has been basically
"hostile."
According to Kreisberg, the Chinese
ideological commitment to hostility
has produced a split with the other
major Communist nations, which be
lieve in the possibility of peaceful co
existence.
Revolutionary Power
Kreisberg called China the "revolu
tionary power of the world" because
of its belief in violence as the only
means for change. He termed the
United States the "status quo power"
because of its desire for non-violent
change. Although the Chinese are bel
ligerent in their public statements,
Kreisberg pointed out that they are
reluctant to begin open warfare.
He characterized American foreign
policy in Asia as an attempt "to make
their hostility unsuccessful." Hear

gued that if the Chinese are forced
to recognize that their foreign policy
won't work and if they recognize that
their domestic problems might be
solved better through cooperation
with the United States, then there
will be a "greater community of in
terests" which will lead to better re
lations.
The United States military Activity
in South Vietnam is designed to prove
to China that wars of liberation are
impractical. Kreisberg did not explain
why these conflicts are impractical
for China if the United States is obili
ged to fight several long guerilla cam
paigns.
Official Recognition
On the issue of recognizing Red
China, Mr. Keisberg stated that no
purpose would be served by recogni
tion of China. He added that the
United States deals with Red China
on a "de facto" basis in Poland.
The United States will continue to
oppose Red China's admission to the
United Nations, Kreisberg said, as
long as they demand that Nationalist
China be expelled from the Security
Council.
