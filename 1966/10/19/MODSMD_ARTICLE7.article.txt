# Greeks Feel Certain Beta Chi's Revisions Pose No Threat To Fraternity Community
## 
### KIRK HANEN Associate Editor 
Sixteen of Stanford's fraternity
presidents are unanimous in their
feeling that Beta Chi's revised mem
ber selection policy will not be a
threat to the future of the fraternity
system at Stanford.
Eight could not be reached for com
ment.
And all of the presidents polled felt

that their houses would not consider
such a move in the near future.
Both results came out in a Daily
survey testing Greek reaction to Beta
Chi fraternity's decision to abolish
formal rush and the "ding" system.
A Threat
Respondents in the survey were
asked two questions:
• Do you think Beta Chi's action is

a threat to the fraternity system at
Stanford?"
• Do you think your fraternity
would consider a similar move in the
future?
Through all answered "no" to both
questions, some expressed admiration
for the fact that Beta Chi is "doing
what it believes in."
One president lauded the move in
principle, but added that "We would

not want to put our thumbs in the
dike."
Others criticized the move, saying:
• "They're either farsighted or a
bit too progressive."
• "Beta Chi is now almost a dorm
with Greek letters."
• "We don't think they have a clear
enough plan."
Not A Frat
And several felt Beta Chi was no
longer a "real" fraternity.
One fraternity, Delta Chi, had con
sidered a revision of membership
selection procedures, but, according
to its president, decided that its cur
rent policy was "better than whatever
was second best
The rest were also satisfied with
their current selection appartus, or
felt that it would have to do for the
present.
Satisfied
Among the responses:
• "Our house is reanalyzing its
goals but feels that selectivity is bene
ficial to the fraternity system."
• "When you forfeit the selective
process you take a chance of bringing
in boys who are unwilling to put into
the fraternity the support it needs
• "Basically ours is a successful
way of living and we'd like to keep »
that way."
In response to the criticism that
Beta Chi had ceased to be a fraternity,
house president noted:
"This is something we've heard
quite a bit before. We anticipated this
type of reaction.
"We are very definitely a fraternity
though—and in a much more real
sense than some of our detractors
think."
Williams blamed resistance to
change at the local level on an over
reliance on the national fraternities
for leadership.
Stronger Bond
Williams felt that the policy
changes would make possible a "new
and stronger bond" among the broth
ers.
Inter-Fraternity President Drennan
Jones of Kappa Sigma said, "We wel
come Beta Chi's move with open arms.
We know they've done a lot of very
serious thinking about this."
Williams will outline his house's
reasons for the revisions before I.F.C.
tonight at 7:15 at Kappa Sigma.
