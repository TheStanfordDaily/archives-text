# Trustees Fall Short Of Ideal Standards
## 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL (Fifth in a series) 
Stanford's Board of Trustees compares only
moderately well with the standards of struc
ture and practice listed in earlier articles in
this series, but, in the words of Board presi
dent Richard Guggenhime, "practice as well
as theory must be considered in making a
judgment on the functioning of a board."
"If something doesn't work, one should
change it,"he said in an interview. "I don't
see that the present system is not working."
Guggenhime, when questioned concerning
the fact that two partners from the same law
firm and two executives from the same com
pany were selected as trustees, responded:
"Whatever the apparent illogic, we are looking
for the best qualified people and so we nomi
nate by the person more than by stated cri
teria.
In Good Shape
"The board is in good shape and we are
not as undiversified as we might appear," he
noted.
Students of higher education recommend

that boards of trustees be diversified accord
ing to age, educational background, vocational
experience, and geographic location.
On the surface at least, Stanford fares poorly
in comparison to the theoretical norms set by
scholars. The ages of Stanford trustees run
from 52 to 69, with the average being 58.6.
(Scholars recommend an average around 54,
with "substantial numbers of members" be
tween 30 and 50.)
Alumni Predominate
In terms of educational background, twenty
one of the twenty-two trustees are Stanford
alumni (the other one has no college listed in
any biography available to The Daily). But
many have advanced degrees (principally in
law, but also business and engineering), many
of which came from institutions other than
Stanford.
"All the trustees are exposed to other insti
tutions as well as Stanford," Guggenhime
states. "These people are involved broadly and
much of their work is in organizations related
to education."
Vocationally, Stanford's board has been ac

cused of being run by businessmen and law
yers. There are .however, "engineers on the
board, as well as an educator and a doctor,"
Guggenhime rebuts.
The board's criteria for selection, as stated
by Guggenhime, are not far from those posited
by scholars in higher education. Scholars
usually recommend that prospective trustees
1) have a devotion to higher education; 2) be
open-minded; 3) show qualities of leadership;
and 4) have attained success in a chosen field
of endeavor.
Objective And Flexible
The Stanford board, according to Guggen
hime, looks for "intelligent people with an hon
est interest in higher education. We seek peo
ple who want to work for Stanford and who
are objective and flexible."
As for geographic distribution of the trus
tees, fifteen are from the Bay Area, three from
Los Angeles, two from New York, and one
each from Chicago and Houston.
Because so many trustees live around San
Francisco (the board offices are located in the

city), the board is able to meet monthly and
still maintain good attendance (an average of
17 trustees were present for the meetings dur
ing the first half of this year). Frequent meet
ings are recommended by scholars as further
ing meaningful trustee involvement in de
cision-making.
Monthly Meetings?
Monthly meetings, however, may be too
frequent for at least two reasons. First, the
administration is caught in an unending cyli
cal process of planning for trustee meetings.
At Stanford, for example, planning begins
about a week after one meeting for the next
month.
Second, when meetings are frequent, the
board tends to get too involved in the day-to
day running of the university. At Stanford, the
complaint is not uncommon that the trustees
sometimes become over-attentive to details
some feel to be out of their area of responsi
bility.
A possible solution to several of the board's
problems might be to hold meetings less fre

quently and to have an executive committee,
which would carry on board business between
meetings. In this way, it would be possible to
have more trustees from outside the Bay Area
and still to maintain good attendance.
In addition, the board could then have a posi
tive focus on the long-range development of
the University, instead of a watch dog attitude
toward the way the University is being run
now.
Consider Self-Appraisal
Even if these proposals are not feasible, it
might still be appropriate for the board to
consider a self-appraisal as part of the series
of self-studies which will be going on at Stan
ford this year.
Trustee committees do much of the important
work between trustee meetings. They work
closely with the appropriate members of the
Stanford administration, who make sugges
tions for the board agenda to the committee
chairmen.
The Friday before each board meeting, the
trustees are mailed the program,
70 to 80 single-spaced type-writ
ten pages outlining the agenda
for each committee. The com
mittees, meeting the following
Wednesday and Thursday morn
ing, act on the agenda and the
committee minutes then become
the agenda for the full board,
which meets Thursday after
noon.
Five Major Committees
The board's important commit
tees are:
Finance: supervises the bud
get and passes upon all opera
tional financial transactions.
• Investment: supervises the
University's endowment. The
committee employs a full-time
investment counselor and rec
ommends to the board the pur
chase and sale of securities and
otjher properties.
■'4 Academic Affairs: deals with
problems pertaining to faculty
and students, especially educa
tional policies and standards, stu
dent activities, employment and
advancement of professors, bud
got on academic expenditures.
• Buildings and Grounds:
passes on provisions for upkeep
of existing University physical
buildings; also concerned with
policies regarding use of Uni
versity lands.
• Planning and Development:
the money - raising committee.
The committee works with the
administration and volunteer
alumni groups in the promotion
of gifts.
Academic Experience
The academic affairs commit
tee has in recent years been the
site for an experiment in trus
tee exposure to academic mat
ters. Almost monthly .professors
and deans make reports to the
committee about recent develop
ments and plans in their areas.
Since the committee meets just
prior to the full board meeting,

most of the trustees are able to
hear these presentations.
Recent appearances have in
cluded: Hurbert Heffner on the
relationship between the Univer
sity and the U.S. government;
Maurice Osborne on the health
service; Vergil Whitaker on the
Summer Festival; and Robert
Walker on Overseas Campuses
and General Studies.

and San Francisco lawyer. While

understand the others' position."
Guggenhime thinks that right

harder to do this than students
are."

Stanford's Board of Trustees compares only
moderately well with the standards of struc
ture and practice listed in earlier articles in
this series, but, in the words of Board presi
dent Richard Guggenhime, "practice as well
as theory must be considered in making a
judgment on the functioning of a board."
"If something doesn't work, one should
change it,"he said in an interview. "I don't
see that the present system is not working."
Guggenhime, when questioned concerning
the fact that two partners from the same law
firm and two executives from the same com
pany were selected as trustees, responded:
"Whatever the apparent illogic, we are looking
for the best qualified people and so we nomi
nate by the person more than by stated cri
teria.
In Good Shape
"The board is in good shape and we are
not as undiversified as we might appear," he
noted.
Students of higher education recommend

that boards of trustees be diversified accord
ing to age, educational background, vocational
experience, and geographic location.
On the surface at least, Stanford fares poorly
in comparison to the theoretical norms set by
scholars. The ages of Stanford trustees run
from 52 to 69, with the average being 58.6.
(Scholars recommend an average around 54,
with "substantial numbers of members" be
tween 30 and 50.)
Alumni Predominate
In terms of educational background, twenty
one of the twenty-two trustees are Stanford
alumni (the other one has no college listed in
any biography available to The Daily). But
many have advanced degrees (principally in
law, but also business and engineering), many
of which came from institutions other than
Stanford.
"All the trustees are exposed to other insti
tutions as well as Stanford," Guggenhime
states. "These people are involved broadly and
much of their work is in organizations related
to education."
Vocationally, Stanford's board has been ac

cused of being run by businessmen and law
yers. There are .however, "engineers on the
board, as well as an educator and a doctor,"
Guggenhime rebuts.
The board's criteria for selection, as stated
by Guggenhime, are not far from those posited
by scholars in higher education. Scholars
usually recommend that prospective trustees
1) have a devotion to higher education; 2) be
open-minded; 3) show qualities of leadership;
and 4) have attained success in a chosen field
of endeavor.
Objective And Flexible
The Stanford board, according to Guggen
hime, looks for "intelligent people with an hon
est interest in higher education. We seek peo
ple who want to work for Stanford and who
are objective and flexible."
As for geographic distribution of the trus
tees, fifteen are from the Bay Area, three from
Los Angeles, two from New York, and one
each from Chicago and Houston.
Because so many trustees live around San
Francisco (the board offices are located in the

city), the board is able to meet monthly and
still maintain good attendance (an average of
17 trustees were present for the meetings dur
ing the first half of this year). Frequent meet
ings are recommended by scholars as further
ing meaningful trustee involvement in de
cision-making.
Monthly Meetings?
Monthly meetings, however, may be too
frequent for at least two reasons. First, the
administration is caught in an unending cyli
cal process of planning for trustee meetings.
At Stanford, for example, planning begins
about a week after one meeting for the next
month.
Second, when meetings are frequent, the
board tends to get too involved in the day-to
day running of the university. At Stanford, the
complaint is not uncommon that the trustees
sometimes become over-attentive to details
some feel to be out of their area of responsi
bility.
A possible solution to several of the board's
problems might be to hold meetings less fre

quently and to have an executive committee,
which would carry on board business between
meetings. In this way, it would be possible to
have more trustees from outside the Bay Area
and still to maintain good attendance.
In addition, the board could then have a posi
tive focus on the long-range development of
the University, instead of a watch dog attitude
toward the way the University is being run
now.
Consider Self-Appraisal
Even if these proposals are not feasible, it
might still be appropriate for the board to
consider a self-appraisal as part of the series
of self-studies which will be going on at Stan
ford this year.
Trustee committees do much of the important
work between trustee meetings. They work
closely with the appropriate members of the
Stanford administration, who make sugges
tions for the board agenda to the committee
chairmen.
The Friday before each board meeting, the
trustees are mailed the program,
70 to 80 single-spaced type-writ
ten pages outlining the agenda
for each committee. The com
mittees, meeting the following
Wednesday and Thursday morn
ing, act on the agenda and the
committee minutes then become
the agenda for the full board,
which meets Thursday after
noon.
Five Major Committees
The board's important commit
tees are:
Finance: supervises the bud
get and passes upon all opera
tional financial transactions.
• Investment: supervises the
University's endowment. The
committee employs a full-time
investment counselor and rec
ommends to the board the pur
chase and sale of securities and
otjher properties.
■'4 Academic Affairs: deals with
problems pertaining to faculty
and students, especially educa
tional policies and standards, stu
dent activities, employment and
advancement of professors, bud
got on academic expenditures.
• Buildings and Grounds:
passes on provisions for upkeep
of existing University physical
buildings; also concerned with
policies regarding use of Uni
versity lands.
• Planning and Development:
the money - raising committee.
The committee works with the
administration and volunteer
alumni groups in the promotion
of gifts.
Academic Experience
The academic affairs commit
tee has in recent years been the
site for an experiment in trus
tee exposure to academic mat
ters. Almost monthly .professors
and deans make reports to the
committee about recent develop
ments and plans in their areas.
Since the committee meets just
prior to the full board meeting,

most of the trustees are able to
hear these presentations.
Recent appearances have in
cluded: Hurbert Heffner on the
relationship between the Univer
sity and the U.S. government;
Maurice Osborne on the health
service; Vergil Whitaker on the
Summer Festival; and Robert
Walker on Overseas Campuses
and General Studies.

nate by the person more than by stated cri
teria.
In Good Shape
"The board is in good shape and we are
not as undiversified as we might appear," he
noted.
Students of higher education recommend

that boards of trustees be diversified accord
ing to age, educational background, vocational
experience, and geographic location.
On the surface at least, Stanford fares poorly
in comparison to the theoretical norms set by
scholars. The ages of Stanford trustees run
from 52 to 69, with the average being 58.6.
(Scholars recommend an average around 54,
with "substantial numbers of members" be
tween 30 and 50.)
Alumni Predominate
In terms of educational background, twenty
one of the twenty-two trustees are Stanford
alumni (the other one has no college listed in
any biography available to The Daily). But
many have advanced degrees (principally in
law, but also business and engineering), many
of which came from institutions other than
Stanford.
"All the trustees are exposed to other insti
tutions as well as Stanford," Guggenhime
states. "These people are involved broadly and
much of their work is in organizations related
to education."
Vocationally, Stanford's board has been ac

cused of being run by businessmen and law

board, as well as an educator and a doctor,"
Guggenhime rebuts.
The board's criteria for selection, as stated
by Guggenhime, are not far from those posited
by scholars in higher education. Scholars
usually recommend that prospective trustees
1) have a devotion to higher education; 2) be
open-minded; 3) show qualities of leadership;
and 4) have attained success in a chosen field
of endeavor.
Objective And Flexible
The Stanford board, according to Guggen
hime, looks for "intelligent people with an hon
est interest in higher education. We seek peo
ple who want to work for Stanford and who
are objective and flexible."
As for geographic distribution of the trus
tees, fifteen are from the Bay Area, three from
Los Angeles, two from New York, and one
each from Chicago and Houston.
Because so many trustees live around San
Francisco (the board offices are located in the

city), the board is able to meet monthly and
still maintain good attendance (an average of
17 trustees were present for the meetings dur
ing the first half of this year). Frequent meet
ings are recommended by scholars as further
ing meaningful trustee involvement in de
cision-making.
Monthly Meetings?
Monthly meetings, however, may be too
frequent for at least two reasons. First, the
administration is caught in an unending cyli
cal process of planning for trustee meetings.
At Stanford, for example, planning begins
about a week after one meeting for the next
month.
Second, when meetings are frequent, the
board tends to get too involved in the day-to
day running of the university. At Stanford, the
complaint is not uncommon that the trustees
sometimes become over-attentive to details
some feel to be out of their area of responsi
bility.
A possible solution to several of the board's
problems might be to hold meetings less fre

quently and to have an executive committee,
which would carry on board business between
meetings. In this way, it would be possible to
have more trustees from outside the Bay Area
and still to maintain good attendance.
In addition, the board could then have a posi
tive focus on the long-range development of
the University, instead of a watch dog attitude
toward the way the University is being run
now.
Consider Self-Appraisal
Even if these proposals are not feasible, it
might still be appropriate for the board to
consider a self-appraisal as part of the series
of self-studies which will be going on at Stan
ford this year.
Trustee committees do much of the important
work between trustee meetings. They work
closely with the appropriate members of the
Stanford administration, who make sugges
tions for the board agenda to the committee
chairmen.
The Friday before each board meeting, the
trustees are mailed the program,
70 to 80 single-spaced type-writ
ten pages outlining the agenda
for each committee. The com
mittees, meeting the following
Wednesday and Thursday morn
ing, act on the agenda and the
committee minutes then become
the agenda for the full board,
which meets Thursday after
noon.
Five Major Committees
The board's important commit
tees are:
Finance: supervises the bud
get and passes upon all opera
tional financial transactions.
• Investment: supervises the
University's endowment. The
committee employs a full-time
investment counselor and rec
ommends to the board the pur
chase and sale of securities and
otjher properties.
■'4 Academic Affairs: deals with
problems pertaining to faculty
and students, especially educa
tional policies and standards, stu
dent activities, employment and
advancement of professors, bud
got on academic expenditures.
• Buildings and Grounds:
passes on provisions for upkeep
of existing University physical
buildings; also concerned with
policies regarding use of Uni
versity lands.
• Planning and Development:
the money - raising committee.
The committee works with the
administration and volunteer
alumni groups in the promotion
of gifts.
Academic Experience
The academic affairs commit
tee has in recent years been the
site for an experiment in trus
tee exposure to academic mat
ters. Almost monthly .professors
and deans make reports to the
committee about recent develop
ments and plans in their areas.
Since the committee meets just
prior to the full board meeting,

most of the trustees are able to
hear these presentations.
Recent appearances have in
cluded: Hurbert Heffner on the
relationship between the Univer
sity and the U.S. government;
Maurice Osborne on the health
service; Vergil Whitaker on the
Summer Festival; and Robert
Walker on Overseas Campuses
and General Studies.

The Stanford board is headed
by Richard Guggenhime, an ar
ticulate, frank, devoted alumnus
and San Francisco lawyer. While
he admits that the board exists
for legal reasons ("in the legal
structure set up by the Found
ers, we have the judiciary duty
to uphold the trust"), he also
feels the board has a right to
existence for broader reasons.
"The board of trustees of a
university," he states, "serves as
a bridge between the university
community and the university
constituency. It interprets the
university to the outside, and
also it provides within the uni
versity itself an independent

view of the community by some
one who is outside of the faculty
but who still understands high
er education."
Who Iluns University
He believes the trustees have
the responsibility "to see that
the university is run well, but
not to run it themselves." He
realizes that the Stanford board's
practices and structure do not
agree totally with the theoretical
models put forward by scholars
but also observes that "I don't
see that the present system is
not working."
Guggenhime has a suggestion
to lessen the friction between
university constituencies. "We
need to have everybody—stu
dents, administration, faculty,
and trustees—make an effort to
understand the others' position."
Guggenhime thinks that right
now "the trustees are trying
harder to do this than students
are."
(Next: Summary of criticisms
of board composition and prac
tices; suggested model for ideal
board.)
Stanford's Board of Trustees compares only
moderately well with the standards of struc
ture and practice listed in earlier articles in
this series, but, in the words of Board presi
dent Richard Guggenhime, "practice as well
as theory must be considered in making a
judgment on the functioning of a board."
"If something doesn't work, one should
change it,"he said in an interview. "I don't
see that the present system is not working."
Guggenhime, when questioned concerning
the fact that two partners from the same law
firm and two executives from the same com
pany were selected as trustees, responded:
"Whatever the apparent illogic, we are looking
for the best qualified people and so we nomi
nate by the person more than by stated cri
teria.
In Good Shape
"The board is in good shape and we are
not as undiversified as we might appear," he
noted.
Students of higher education recommend

that boards of trustees be diversified accord
ing to age, educational background, vocational
experience, and geographic location.
On the surface at least, Stanford fares poorly
in comparison to the theoretical norms set by
scholars. The ages of Stanford trustees run
from 52 to 69, with the average being 58.6.
(Scholars recommend an average around 54,
with "substantial numbers of members" be
tween 30 and 50.)
Alumni Predominate
In terms of educational background, twenty
one of the twenty-two trustees are Stanford
alumni (the other one has no college listed in
any biography available to The Daily). But
many have advanced degrees (principally in
law, but also business and engineering), many
of which came from institutions other than
Stanford.
"All the trustees are exposed to other insti
tutions as well as Stanford," Guggenhime
states. "These people are involved broadly and
much of their work is in organizations related
to education."
Vocationally, Stanford's board has been ac

cused of being run by businessmen and law
yers. There are .however, "engineers on the
board, as well as an educator and a doctor,"
Guggenhime rebuts.
The board's criteria for selection, as stated
by Guggenhime, are not far from those posited
by scholars in higher education. Scholars
usually recommend that prospective trustees
1) have a devotion to higher education; 2) be
open-minded; 3) show qualities of leadership;
and 4) have attained success in a chosen field
of endeavor.
Objective And Flexible
The Stanford board, according to Guggen
hime, looks for "intelligent people with an hon
est interest in higher education. We seek peo
ple who want to work for Stanford and who
are objective and flexible."
As for geographic distribution of the trus
tees, fifteen are from the Bay Area, three from
Los Angeles, two from New York, and one
each from Chicago and Houston.
Because so many trustees live around San
Francisco (the board offices are located in the

city), the board is able to meet monthly and
still maintain good attendance (an average of
17 trustees were present for the meetings dur
ing the first half of this year). Frequent meet
ings are recommended by scholars as further
ing meaningful trustee involvement in de
cision-making.
Monthly Meetings?
Monthly meetings, however, may be too
frequent for at least two reasons. First, the
administration is caught in an unending cyli
cal process of planning for trustee meetings.
At Stanford, for example, planning begins
about a week after one meeting for the next
month.
Second, when meetings are frequent, the
board tends to get too involved in the day-to
day running of the university. At Stanford, the
complaint is not uncommon that the trustees
sometimes become over-attentive to details
some feel to be out of their area of responsi
bility.
A possible solution to several of the board's
problems might be to hold meetings less fre

quently and to have an executive committee,
which would carry on board business between
meetings. In this way, it would be possible to
have more trustees from outside the Bay Area
and still to maintain good attendance.
In addition, the board could then have a posi
tive focus on the long-range development of
the University, instead of a watch dog attitude
toward the way the University is being run
now.
Consider Self-Appraisal
Even if these proposals are not feasible, it
might still be appropriate for the board to
consider a self-appraisal as part of the series
of self-studies which will be going on at Stan
ford this year.
Trustee committees do much of the important
work between trustee meetings. They work
closely with the appropriate members of the
Stanford administration, who make sugges
tions for the board agenda to the committee
chairmen.
The Friday before each board meeting, the
trustees are mailed the program,
70 to 80 single-spaced type-writ
ten pages outlining the agenda
for each committee. The com
mittees, meeting the following
Wednesday and Thursday morn
ing, act on the agenda and the
committee minutes then become
the agenda for the full board,
which meets Thursday after
noon.
Five Major Committees
The board's important commit
tees are:
Finance: supervises the bud
get and passes upon all opera
tional financial transactions.
• Investment: supervises the
University's endowment. The
committee employs a full-time
investment counselor and rec
ommends to the board the pur
chase and sale of securities and
otjher properties.
■'4 Academic Affairs: deals with
problems pertaining to faculty
and students, especially educa
tional policies and standards, stu
dent activities, employment and
advancement of professors, bud
got on academic expenditures.
• Buildings and Grounds:
passes on provisions for upkeep
of existing University physical
buildings; also concerned with
policies regarding use of Uni
versity lands.
• Planning and Development:
the money - raising committee.
The committee works with the
administration and volunteer
alumni groups in the promotion
of gifts.
Academic Experience
The academic affairs commit
tee has in recent years been the
site for an experiment in trus
tee exposure to academic mat
ters. Almost monthly .professors
and deans make reports to the
committee about recent develop
ments and plans in their areas.
Since the committee meets just
prior to the full board meeting,

most of the trustees are able to
hear these presentations.
Recent appearances have in
cluded: Hurbert Heffner on the
relationship between the Univer
sity and the U.S. government;
Maurice Osborne on the health
service; Vergil Whitaker on the
Summer Festival; and Robert
Walker on Overseas Campuses
and General Studies.

Academic Experience
The academic affairs commit
tee has in recent years been the
site for an experiment in trus
tee exposure to academic mat
ters. Almost monthly .professors
and deans make reports to the
committee about recent develop
ments and plans in their areas.
Since the committee meets just
prior to the full board meeting,

most of the trustees are able to
hear these presentations.
Recent appearances have in
cluded: Hurbert Heffner on the
relationship between the Univer
sity and the U.S. government;
Maurice Osborne on the health
service; Vergil Whitaker on the
Summer Festival; and Robert
Walker on Overseas Campuses
and General Studies.

The Stanford board is headed
by Richard Guggenhime, an ar
ticulate, frank, devoted alumnus
and San Francisco lawyer. While
he admits that the board exists
for legal reasons ("in the legal
structure set up by the Found
ers, we have the judiciary duty
to uphold the trust"), he also
feels the board has a right to
existence for broader reasons.
"The board of trustees of a
university," he states, "serves as
a bridge between the university
community and the university
constituency. It interprets the
university to the outside, and
also it provides within the uni
versity itself an independent

view of the community by some
one who is outside of the faculty
but who still understands high
er education."
Who Iluns University
He believes the trustees have
the responsibility "to see that
the university is run well, but
not to run it themselves." He
realizes that the Stanford board's
practices and structure do not
agree totally with the theoretical
models put forward by scholars
but also observes that "I don't
see that the present system is
not working."
Guggenhime has a suggestion
to lessen the friction between
university constituencies. "We
need to have everybody—stu
dents, administration, faculty,
and trustees—make an effort to
understand the others' position."
Guggenhime thinks that right
now "the trustees are trying
harder to do this than students
are."
