What is Dudley Herbarium?
A grotesque sculpture? A lux
urious garden? No. A room full
of file cabinets that smell of
moth balls, and stacks and
stacks of newspapers? Yes.
Or more specifically, Dudley
Herbarium is a collection, lo
cated in the museum building,
of 750,000 preserved plants,
which are stored either in the
file cabinets or between the
sheets of newspaper. The moth
balls are to keep insects away,
for plants, if protected, will last
Indefinitely.
The herbarium is a part of
the Division of Systematic Bi
ology at Stanford. It originally
consisted of 70,000 plants from
the collection of William H.
Harvey, Trinity College, Dub
lin.
First Gifts
Donated to Stanford in 1892,
these plants were the first gift
to Stanford after the initial
founding grant. The present
name of the herbarium honors
the first professor of systematic
botany, William R. Dudley, who
arrived from Cornell in 1892.
The herbarium serves as a re
pository for many different

kinds of plants, especially those
from the North American con
tinent. The material is valuable
chiefly to those who do re
search. For this reason, accord
ing to Dr. John Thomas, curato.r
of the herbarium, "you can't
put a price on the collection; it
is essentially priceless."
However he added that it dote
cost approximately one dollar to
process each specimen.
In some cases, the herbarium
preserves several different ex
amples of the same species. Re
searchers use these samples to
locate the geographical distribu
tion of the species or to observe
the variances between the differ
ent specimens. .
An especially interesting part
of the collection is the first
plants of a previously unknown
variety to be given a species
name. Research scientists use
the characteristics of these pre
served plants are the "standard"
characteristics for that species.
