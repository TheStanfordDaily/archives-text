• Ky's Cabinet Realigns
SAlGON—Premier Nguyen Cao Ky's hopes
of presenting a united Saigon front at the
Manila Conference rose tonight with an un
official report that five of seven cabinet minis
ters who resigned had torn up their resigna
tions.
The cabinet walkout had been a blow to Ky
because the ministers charged the predomi
nantly military regime was corrupt. This
would have damaged the regime's image at
the Manila summit meeting on Vietnam open
ing Monday.
Unofficial sources said Ky had agreed to re
buke the National Police Director, Nguyen
Ngoc Loan, accused by the seven ministers
of ruthless action. They said the Premier
may also have made some other concessions.
• Viet Cong Takes Heavy Toll
SAIGON—Viet Cong gunners took a heavy
toll of U.S. helicopters supporting the Viet
namese Army in a big battle in the Mekong
Delta, downing four and damaging 20, a U.S.
spokesman said yesterday. But casualties

among the helicopter crewmen were described
as very light.
The battle blazed up Tuesday between 1,000
Vietnamese soldiers and about 1,000 Com
munist troops 26 miles southeast of Can Tho.
Severe fighting continued all day Wednesday.
A Vietnamese spokesman said government
casualties were moderate, an indication the
force was hard hit.
In the air war, U.S. 852 bombers from Guam
struck at suspected North Vietnamese camps
just south of the demilitarized zone between
the two Vietnams. U.S. officials in Saigon
said they believed the North Vietnamese will
make a drive in this area soon.

Nations Children's Emergency Fund) and in
1964 was awarded to Dr. Martin Luther King.

that a witness at last August's tumultuous
hearing of the House Committee On Un-Ameri
can Activities was paid $1,000 by Congress

the Soviet Union since 1963, when the Nuclear
Test Ban Treaty was signed.
The spokesman said four reports have been
made during 1966. The last report of seismic

• AEC Reports Soviet Tests
WASHINGTON—The Atomic Energy Com

200,000 tons of TNT.
An AEC spokesman said the agency had re
ceived nine reports of seismic signals from
the Soviet Union since 1963, when the Nuclear
Test Ban Treaty was signed.
The spokesman said four reports have been
made during 1966. The last report of seismic

by William Foster, U.S. dedegate to the
Disarmament and Arms Control Conference.

• Ky's Cabinet Realigns
SAlGON—Premier Nguyen Cao Ky's hopes
of presenting a united Saigon front at the
Manila Conference rose tonight with an un
official report that five of seven cabinet minis
ters who resigned had torn up their resigna
tions.
The cabinet walkout had been a blow to Ky
because the ministers charged the predomi
nantly military regime was corrupt. This
would have damaged the regime's image at
the Manila summit meeting on Vietnam open
ing Monday.
Unofficial sources said Ky had agreed to re
buke the National Police Director, Nguyen
Ngoc Loan, accused by the seven ministers
of ruthless action. They said the Premier
may also have made some other concessions.
• Viet Cong Takes Heavy Toll
SAIGON—Viet Cong gunners took a heavy

among the helicopter crewmen were described
as very light.
The battle blazed up Tuesday between 1,000
Vietnamese soldiers and about 1,000 Com
munist troops 26 miles southeast of Can Tho.
Severe fighting continued all day Wednesday.
A Vietnamese spokesman said government
casualties were moderate, an indication the
force was hard hit.
In the air war, U.S. 852 bombers from Guam
struck at suspected North Vietnamese camps
just south of the demilitarized zone between
the two Vietnams. U.S. officials in Saigon
said they believed the North Vietnamese will
make a drive in this area soon.

• Ky's Cabinet Realigns
SAlGON—Premier Nguyen Cao Ky's hopes
of presenting a united Saigon front at the
Manila Conference rose tonight with an un
official report that five of seven cabinet minis
ters who resigned had torn up their resigna
tions.
The cabinet walkout had been a blow to Ky
because the ministers charged the predomi
nantly military regime was corrupt. This
would have damaged the regime's image at
the Manila summit meeting on Vietnam open
ing Monday.
Unofficial sources said Ky had agreed to re
buke the National Police Director, Nguyen
Ngoc Loan, accused by the seven ministers
of ruthless action. They said the Premier
may also have made some other concessions.
• Viet Cong Takes Heavy Toll
SAIGON—Viet Cong gunners took a heavy
toll of U.S. helicopters supporting the Viet
namese Army in a big battle in the Mekong
Delta, downing four and damaging 20, a U.S.
spokesman said yesterday. But casualties

among the helicopter crewmen were described
as very light.
The battle blazed up Tuesday between 1,000
Vietnamese soldiers and about 1,000 Com
munist troops 26 miles southeast of Can Tho.
Severe fighting continued all day Wednesday.
A Vietnamese spokesman said government
casualties were moderate, an indication the
force was hard hit.
In the air war, U.S. 852 bombers from Guam
struck at suspected North Vietnamese camps
just south of the demilitarized zone between
the two Vietnams. U.S. officials in Saigon
said they believed the North Vietnamese will
make a drive in this area soon.

that a witness at last August's tumultuous

• AEC Reports Soviet Tests
WASHINGTON—The Atomic Energy Com

That would be equal to between 20,000 and
200,000 tons of TNT.
An AEC spokesman said the agency had re
ceived nine reports of seismic signals from
the Soviet Union since 1963, when the Nuclear
Test Ban Treaty was signed.
The spokesman said four reports have been
made during 1966. The last report of seismic
disturbances was made last July 7 at Geneva
by William Foster, U.S. dedegate to the
Disarmament and Arms Control Conference.
