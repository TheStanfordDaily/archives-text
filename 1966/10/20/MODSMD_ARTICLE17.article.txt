# Study Shows, Profs Still Evaluated By Research
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (CPS)—
Scholarly research and publica
tion are still the primary con
siderations in evaluating a pro
fessor's teaching ability, accord
ing to a recent survey of deans
at 1,110 colleges and universi
ties by the American Council on
Education.
While final decisions on a pro
fessor's teaching ability are
usually made by deans and de
partment heads, the direct and
systematic sources of informa
tion most likely to measure a
teacher's impact on the student
are least likely to be used, the
study said.
Evaluation is often carried on

by osmosis; over 40 per cent of
the schools reported that they
considered (student opinion in
formally, gathered at random
from casual or overheard con
versations.
The study recommended sev
eral alternative techniques, re
ported in the Summer ACE Edu
cational Record:
Direct classroom observation.
Employed now in only 14 per
cent of the institutions and ta
boo in almost 40 per cent, the
practice has declined substan
tially since 1961 when the last
comparable survey was taken;
Carefully planned student
questionnaires. While strongly

endorsing consideration ol this
method, the ACE study noted
that it is now used in slightly
over 12 per cent of the cases.
Grade distributions. The dis
tribution of grades in a particu
lar class of a multi-section
course employing departmental
examinations can be significant
if the instructors are aware of
the specific educational objec
tives of the course and if ability
is considered in rating student
performance.
Other findings revealed:
1. The larger the institution,
the greater the reliance placed
on the judgment of departmen
tal chairmen and of committees

in assessing teaching effective
ness.
2. Junior colleges rely more
than do other types of under
graduate institutions on class
room visits, grade distributions,
and long-term follow-up of stu
dents, with faculty research the
last in the list of evaluating cri
teria.
3. While only 36.6 per cent of
the small liberal arts colleges
report that all or most depart
ments use research and publica
tion as an indicator of teaching
effectiveness, 70 per cent of the
university arts and sciences col
leges regularly utilize such data.

3. While only 36.6 per cent of
the small liberal arts colleges
report that all or most depart

tion as an indicator of teaching
effectiveness, 70 per cent of the
university arts and sciences col

WASHINGTON (CPS)—
Scholarly research and publica
tion are still the primary con
siderations in evaluating a pro
fessor's teaching ability, accord
ing to a recent survey of deans
at 1,110 colleges and universi
ties by the American Council on
Education.
While final decisions on a pro
fessor's teaching ability are
usually made by deans and de
partment heads, the direct and
systematic sources of informa
tion most likely to measure a
teacher's impact on the student
are least likely to be used, the
study said.
Evaluation is often carried on

by osmosis; over 40 per cent of
the schools reported that they
considered (student opinion in
formally, gathered at random
from casual or overheard con
versations.
The study recommended sev
eral alternative techniques, re
ported in the Summer ACE Edu
cational Record:
Direct classroom observation.
Employed now in only 14 per
cent of the institutions and ta
boo in almost 40 per cent, the
practice has declined substan
tially since 1961 when the last
comparable survey was taken;
Carefully planned student
questionnaires. While strongly

endorsing consideration ol this
method, the ACE study noted
that it is now used in slightly
over 12 per cent of the cases.
Grade distributions. The dis
tribution of grades in a particu
lar class of a multi-section
course employing departmental
examinations can be significant
if the instructors are aware of
the specific educational objec
tives of the course and if ability
is considered in rating student
performance.
Other findings revealed:
1. The larger the institution,
the greater the reliance placed
on the judgment of departmen
tal chairmen and of committees

in assessing teaching effective
ness.
2. Junior colleges rely more
than do other types of under
graduate institutions on class
room visits, grade distributions,
and long-term follow-up of stu
dents, with faculty research the
last in the list of evaluating cri
teria.
