# Papooses Look For Victory Against SJ
## Daily Sports 
### GREG PSALTIS 
Coach Russ Hampton is look
ing for a tough game tonight as
his freshman football squad will
take on the San Jose State fresh
man, at San Jose.
He said that the San Jose
State freshman squad is much
improved over last year's squad
and that there are some out
standing personnel on the team
this year. Last year the Stan
ford freshmen crushed San Jose,
50-0.
This year, San Jose's freshmen
have won all three of their
games. Hampton feels that Stan
ford's lack of depth could hurt.

The freshman team was hit
heavily by injuries in the USC
game last week. No less than
five starters were listed by
Hampton as being hurt.
Graves Gone
Jody Graves, Stanford's best
lineman, will be lost to an opera
tion. Flanker Red Lasater has a
broken hand. Ron Rossecker, an
other flanker, has a pinched

nerve. Randy Gale, defensive
lineman, has a broken finger and
finally, Ken Carpenter, center,
has bone chips in his elbow.
Hampton said that Gale and
Carpenter will see action despite
their injuries. Bob Reinhard,
starting tight end and lineback
er, will also play. He missed
practice this week due to injuries
sustained in the USC game.
Moving in to fill the gaps on
the starting teams will be Ver
non Gant and Dennis Phillips at
the offensive tackles and Tim
Belczak at defensive guard.
Starting Backfield
Hampton listed his starting
backfield as Jim Plunkett at
quarterback, Howard Williams
at running back, Bob Moore at
flanker and Don Parish at full
back.
The team has been concen
trating this week in practice on
offense. Hampton said he wanted
to eliminate the mistakes made
in the USC game. The Papoose
fumbled eight times against
Southern Cal.
Hampton felt that the defen
sive unit did not play a bad
game against USC. He was en
couraged when the defense held
four straight times inside the
twenty yard line.
Hampton cited lineman Pat
Preston and defensive halfback
Dick Oliver for outstanding de
fensive work last weekend.

his freshman football squad will
take on the San Jose State fresh
man, at San Jose.
He said that the San Jose
State freshman squad is much
improved over last year's squad
and that there are some out
standing personnel on the team
this year. Last year the Stan
ford freshmen crushed San Jose,
50-0.
This year, San Jose's freshmen
have won all three of their
games. Hampton feels that Stan
ford's lack of depth could hurt.

The freshman team was hit
heavily by injuries in the USC
game last week. No less than
five starters were listed by
Hampton as being hurt.
Graves Gone
Jody Graves, Stanford's best
lineman, will be lost to an opera
tion. Flanker Red Lasater has a
broken hand. Ron Rossecker, an
other flanker, has a pinched

nerve. Randy Gale, defensive
lineman, has a broken finger and
finally, Ken Carpenter, center,
has bone chips in his elbow.
Hampton said that Gale and
Carpenter will see action despite
their injuries. Bob Reinhard,
starting tight end and lineback
er, will also play. He missed
practice this week due to injuries
sustained in the USC game.
Moving in to fill the gaps on
the starting teams will be Ver
non Gant and Dennis Phillips at
the offensive tackles and Tim
Belczak at defensive guard.
Starting Backfield
Hampton listed his starting
backfield as Jim Plunkett at
quarterback, Howard Williams
at running back, Bob Moore at
flanker and Don Parish at full
back.
The team has been concen
trating this week in practice on
offense. Hampton said he wanted
to eliminate the mistakes made
in the USC game. The Papoose
fumbled eight times against
Southern Cal.
Hampton felt that the defen
sive unit did not play a bad
game against USC. He was en
couraged when the defense held
four straight times inside the
twenty yard line.
Hampton cited lineman Pat
Preston and defensive halfback
Dick Oliver for outstanding de
fensive work last weekend.
