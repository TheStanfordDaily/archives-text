# Committee Proposes Sr. Colloq Revisions
## Race Nears 
### LESLIE DESMOND 
Evident dissatisfaction with the
present Senior Colloquia requirement
has led to a re-evaluation of the aims
and mechanics of this phase of Gen
eral Studies Program. Under the aus
pices of the ASSU Education Commis
sion and the senior class, Bob Fell
meth has led a committee which has
proposed several major reforms for
the present senior colloq system.
Begun in 1956, the colloquia idea
hoped to provide a wider range of
Stanford students with the opportun
ity for small group discussion than
was previously possible in depart
mental seminars or honors programs.
It was hoped to particularly benefit
seniors because of their increased
knowledge and maturity, and also
would provide a change from the

usual senior concentration in the ma
jor field.
The original philosophy has been
realized in the past to some extent,
but the program recently has been
weakened. According to Fellmeth, the
changes suggested by his committee
enable the senior colloq to better ac
complish the purpose of the program:
"to provide the most open opportun
ity for students to seek knowledge
in any way they see fit on any sub
ject they desire for the sake of that
knowledge alone, not for grades, or
any other immediate reward".
Encourage Initiative
The first proposal for change will
encourage student initiative in for
mulating the colloqs, rather than
merely presenting a faculty-determ
ined subject list in the time schedule.
One quarter in advance professors
willing to lead a colloq would submit
their names and subject areas. Stu
dents seeing this list of professors
would then sign up under them, and
suggested and formulate with him the
content of the course.
They might solicit other professors
to join in the teaching, or suggest any
other ideas making the seminar flex
ible and above all, oriented to the stu
dent's interests. If and when five stu
dents sign up and determine the con
tent of the course, it will be opened
to other interested students.
The committee proposed secondly
that the program be optional. The
philosophy of providing and educa
tional opportunity is undermined by
forcing a student to participate. Fell
meth states in his report that, "the
purpose of the program, thus, is to
light fires by making itself so alive
with ideas and spontanetiy that those
with even the least shred of curiosity
. . . . will be attracted to it."
Thirdly, the committee suggests a
pass-fail system for the colloq. The
report says "true scholarship requires
no reward, it is its own." The pass-fail
innovation will encourage a sincere

interest and flow of ideas, thus ap
proaching the original philosophy of
the program.
Fourth, students other than seniors
should be allowed to participate in the
program. This would add an element
of flexibility into timing for the sen
iors, also allowing juniors with two
years educational experience to par
ticipate. Graduate students would
also be able to join the colloq, but
be limited to three per class.
As a fifth recommendation, it is
proposed that each class be limited
to ten students. This would enhance
the possibility for student participa
tion, and flexibility in the mechanics
of the seminar.
Finally, the unit load assigned to
this seminar should be variable. De
pending on the students' individual
course load, he would determine, with
his professor, a load of from one to
three units, depending on the amount
of research he does.
The committee after formulating
these proposals, conducted a faculty
poll among last spring quarter colloq
professors. "Survey response from
the faculty was extraordinary in af
firmation .... 70 to 90 percent were
in favor of the recommendations",
Fellmeth stated. The report, formally
released today, was submitted earlier
in the month to CUE (Committee on
Undergraduate Education), the Gen
eral Studies Committee, and to the
President. No official action as yet has
been taken on the proposal.
The work of Fellmeth's committee,
aside from hoping to inject a new
spirit into the Senior Colloquia Pro
gram, is attempting to institutionalize
all the benefits of the Undergraduate
special Programs which are now lim
ited in number and haphazardly or
ganized, according to Fellmeth.
These Undergraduate Special sem
inars have had the type of educational
excitement and student initiative Fell
meth hopes to see in the future senior
collog program.

eral Studies Program. Under the aus
pices of the ASSU Education Commis
sion and the senior class, Bob Fell
meth has led a committee which has
proposed several major reforms for
the present senior colloq system.
Begun in 1956, the colloquia idea
hoped to provide a wider range of
Stanford students with the opportun
ity for small group discussion than
was previously possible in depart
mental seminars or honors programs.
It was hoped to particularly benefit
seniors because of their increased
knowledge and maturity, and also
would provide a change from the

usual senior concentration in the ma
jor field.
The original philosophy has been
realized in the past to some extent,
but the program recently has been
weakened. According to Fellmeth, the
changes suggested by his committee
enable the senior colloq to better ac
complish the purpose of the program:
"to provide the most open opportun
ity for students to seek knowledge
in any way they see fit on any sub
ject they desire for the sake of that
knowledge alone, not for grades, or
any other immediate reward".
Encourage Initiative
The first proposal for change will
encourage student initiative in for
mulating the colloqs, rather than
merely presenting a faculty-determ
ined subject list in the time schedule.
One quarter in advance professors
willing to lead a colloq would submit
their names and subject areas. Stu
dents seeing this list of professors
would then sign up under them, and
suggested and formulate with him the
content of the course.
They might solicit other professors
to join in the teaching, or suggest any
other ideas making the seminar flex
ible and above all, oriented to the stu
dent's interests. If and when five stu
dents sign up and determine the con
tent of the course, it will be opened
to other interested students.
The committee proposed secondly
that the program be optional. The
philosophy of providing and educa
tional opportunity is undermined by
forcing a student to participate. Fell
meth states in his report that, "the
purpose of the program, thus, is to
light fires by making itself so alive
with ideas and spontanetiy that those
with even the least shred of curiosity
. . . . will be attracted to it."
Thirdly, the committee suggests a
pass-fail system for the colloq. The
report says "true scholarship requires
no reward, it is its own." The pass-fail
innovation will encourage a sincere

interest and flow of ideas, thus ap
proaching the original philosophy of
the program.
Fourth, students other than seniors
should be allowed to participate in the
program. This would add an element
of flexibility into timing for the sen
iors, also allowing juniors with two
years educational experience to par
ticipate. Graduate students would
also be able to join the colloq, but
be limited to three per class.
As a fifth recommendation, it is
proposed that each class be limited
to ten students. This would enhance
the possibility for student participa
tion, and flexibility in the mechanics
of the seminar.
Finally, the unit load assigned to
this seminar should be variable. De
pending on the students' individual
course load, he would determine, with
his professor, a load of from one to
three units, depending on the amount
of research he does.
The committee after formulating
these proposals, conducted a faculty
poll among last spring quarter colloq
professors. "Survey response from
the faculty was extraordinary in af
firmation .... 70 to 90 percent were
in favor of the recommendations",
Fellmeth stated. The report, formally
released today, was submitted earlier
in the month to CUE (Committee on
Undergraduate Education), the Gen
eral Studies Committee, and to the
President. No official action as yet has
been taken on the proposal.
The work of Fellmeth's committee,
aside from hoping to inject a new
spirit into the Senior Colloquia Pro
gram, is attempting to institutionalize
all the benefits of the Undergraduate
special Programs which are now lim
ited in number and haphazardly or
ganized, according to Fellmeth.
These Undergraduate Special sem
inars have had the type of educational
excitement and student initiative Fell
meth hopes to see in the future senior
collog program.

proposed several major reforms for
the present senior colloq system.
Begun in 1956, the colloquia idea
hoped to provide a wider range of
Stanford students with the opportun
ity for small group discussion than
was previously possible in depart
mental seminars or honors programs.
It was hoped to particularly benefit
seniors because of their increased
knowledge and maturity, and also
would provide a change from the

usual senior concentration in the ma
jor field.
The original philosophy has been
realized in the past to some extent,
but the program recently has been
weakened. According to Fellmeth, the
changes suggested by his committee
enable the senior colloq to better ac
complish the purpose of the program:
"to provide the most open opportun
ity for students to seek knowledge
in any way they see fit on any sub
ject they desire for the sake of that
knowledge alone, not for grades, or
any other immediate reward".
Encourage Initiative
The first proposal for change will
encourage student initiative in for
mulating the colloqs, rather than
merely presenting a faculty-determ
ined subject list in the time schedule.
One quarter in advance professors
willing to lead a colloq would submit
their names and subject areas. Stu
dents seeing this list of professors
would then sign up under them, and
suggested and formulate with him the
content of the course.
They might solicit other professors
to join in the teaching, or suggest any
other ideas making the seminar flex
ible and above all, oriented to the stu
dent's interests. If and when five stu
dents sign up and determine the con
tent of the course, it will be opened
to other interested students.
The committee proposed secondly
that the program be optional. The
philosophy of providing and educa
tional opportunity is undermined by
forcing a student to participate. Fell
meth states in his report that, "the
purpose of the program, thus, is to
light fires by making itself so alive
with ideas and spontanetiy that those
with even the least shred of curiosity
. . . . will be attracted to it."
Thirdly, the committee suggests a
pass-fail system for the colloq. The
report says "true scholarship requires
no reward, it is its own." The pass-fail
innovation will encourage a sincere

interest and flow of ideas, thus ap
proaching the original philosophy of
the program.
Fourth, students other than seniors
should be allowed to participate in the
program. This would add an element
of flexibility into timing for the sen
iors, also allowing juniors with two
years educational experience to par
ticipate. Graduate students would
also be able to join the colloq, but
be limited to three per class.
As a fifth recommendation, it is
proposed that each class be limited
to ten students. This would enhance
the possibility for student participa
tion, and flexibility in the mechanics
of the seminar.
Finally, the unit load assigned to
this seminar should be variable. De
pending on the students' individual
course load, he would determine, with
his professor, a load of from one to
three units, depending on the amount
of research he does.
The committee after formulating
these proposals, conducted a faculty
poll among last spring quarter colloq
professors. "Survey response from
the faculty was extraordinary in af
firmation .... 70 to 90 percent were
in favor of the recommendations",
Fellmeth stated. The report, formally
released today, was submitted earlier
in the month to CUE (Committee on
Undergraduate Education), the Gen
eral Studies Committee, and to the
President. No official action as yet has
been taken on the proposal.
The work of Fellmeth's committee,
aside from hoping to inject a new
spirit into the Senior Colloquia Pro
gram, is attempting to institutionalize
all the benefits of the Undergraduate
special Programs which are now lim
ited in number and haphazardly or
ganized, according to Fellmeth.
These Undergraduate Special sem
inars have had the type of educational
excitement and student initiative Fell
meth hopes to see in the future senior
collog program.

Evident dissatisfaction with the
present Senior Colloquia requirement

and mechanics of this phase of Gen
eral Studies Program. Under the aus
