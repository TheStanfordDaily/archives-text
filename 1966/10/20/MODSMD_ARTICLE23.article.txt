Southern California and UC
LA continued their winning
ways and their domination of
the AAWU's football statistics
last week. Both teams are un
defeated after five games. UCLA
has not yet played a league
game, but takes on Cal next
week. USC is 3-0 in conference
play.
Together the two teams lead
the league in five of six cate
gories. The Trojans are in first
place in total defense and rush
ing defense. UCLA is in the top
spot in total offense, rushing

offense and passing offense.
Neither team is lower than third
in anything.
Gary Beban continued to pile
up yardage Saturday to main
tain his already well-padded lead
in total offense for the AAWU
and tallied twice, to keep two
touchdowns ahead of teammate
Mel Farr in the scoring race.
Stanford's Gene Washington,
who saw relatively little action

last Saturday, dropped to third
in total offense, only nine yards
ahead of Southern Cal's Troy
Winslow.
Indian Dave Lewis, two-time
defending Conference punting
champ and defending national
champion ,had a bad day against
USC and lost his lead to Gary
Houser of Oregon State.
Bob Conrad, who leads the
Stanford team in pass receiving,
is now third in the AAWU in
the same category. Conrad's 23
receptions put him one ahead of
Washington's Jim Cope.
