# Text Of joint Report On Senior Colloquia
## 
### 
(Editor's note. The following Is
an excerpted text of the Joint
Report of the Senior Colloquia
Committee of the ASSU Educa
tion Committee and The Senior
Class for Curriculum Reform.)
During the 1965 â€¢ 1966 year,
the student legislature appoint
ed an Education Commission to
conduct an inquiry into educa
tion at Stanford with hopes for
student initiated reform. As part
of this endeavor, the Commis
sion assumed responsibility for
the evaluation of the senior col
loquia plan.
The need for a thorough study
of this particular part of the
general studies scheme was the
result of an evident disintegra
tion of the present program.
The sources of dissatisfaction
and the precise causes thereof
were not as clear.
There ensued a series of per
sonal and confidential inter
views with numerous student
and faculty leaders, most of
whom had some interest in the
colloquia program. Subsequent
ly, three separate and extensive
questionnaires were formulated.

These included: 1) a sample poll
of the student body, 2) a poll of
all professors conducting senior
colloquias at that time (Spring
of 1966), 3) a large poll of the
general faculty, including twen
ty-two departments.
The new committees continued
the work, tabulating the scores
of forms that were arriving
throughout the latter part of
spring quarter 1966. During the
summer, the results from the
year of private discussions, and
from the three polls have been
compiled into the following re
port.
Program Purpose
The following explanation of
purpose was included in the
questionnaires.
"The present General Studies
Program, of which the senior
colloquia requirement is an in
tegral part, emerged from the
two-year intensive Study of Un
dergraduate Education, initiated
by President Sterling and con
ducted continuously from Au
gust 1954 to September 1956.
"The colloquia requirement
(2 two-unit colloquia in the se
nior year) grew out of a serious
questioning of the lecture sys
tem as a pedagogical device. It
was hoped that the colloquia
would provide a small group dis
cussion situation for a wider
range of Stanford students than
is possible in departmental semi

nars or the various honors pro
grams. By placing the require
ment in the senior year, It is
hoped that two things will be
accomplished: 1) general educa
tion will be carried into the
senior year which forces the
senior beyond the narrow bonds
of his major and acts as a
counter-part of that part of the
General Studies Program which
permits early specialization; and
2) the colloquia will take advan
tage of the students improved
knowledge and maturity of
judgment.
By closing the colloquia to
majors in the field of the of
fering, it is hoped that a kind of
cross-fertilization process will
take place, in which 6tudents
from a variety of disciplines will
gather together to shed light on
a common problem from their
various points of view. Finally,
it is hoped that the colloquia will
provide an educational exper
ience somewhat different from
the research seminar, by placing
greater emphasis on discussion
and on-the-spot interpretation,
analysis and testing of ideas,
and by replacing the research
paper with the less formal per
sonal, or 'creative' essay."
There is little doubt that many
of the expressed aims of the pro
gram have become a reality for
many Stanford undergraduates.
In recent years, however, chang
es have occured that have

greatly weakened the program.
There has been an evolution
from two directions. First, there
have been changes in the pro
gram per se over the past de
cade. Second, there have been
several changes in the educa
tional attitudes and expectations
that deem major adjustments
advisable for the more effective
accomplishment of the original
goals.
Decline Of Program
Originally, the senior col
loquia program was financed by
a Carnegie Corporation grant.
This backing, however, has dis
sipated and over the past sev
eral years the financial responsi
bility has shifted through the
Committee on General Studies
to the various departments. Fur
ther, the lack of funds at the de
partmental level earmarked for
specific colloquia uses has re
sulted in a flurry of "buckpas
sing" among departments, and
thus a decline in the number of
course offerings. It is generally
known that this is the chief rea
son for the recent change in the
colloquia requirement of from
two to one.
The departments, which must
compete almost viciously for
funds, are understandably reti
cent to "donate" faculty time
and expense for general studies
purposes. The difficulty, per
haps, lies with the need for
financial and academic leader
ship and coordination. This con
dition is underlined by the fact
that fifty per cent of the collo
quia professors spring quarter
of 1966 are under duress, or
unable altogether to teach fur
ther in the program due to the
"present compensation system."
These problems, of course, are
beyond student solution, and
must be worked out with, or by,
administration and faculty
groups. It might be suggested,
however, that if the proposed
changes that follow are adopted,

it could be worthwhile to change
the name of the program and
apply for foundation aid of some
sort.
Changing Needs
The poll results have reflected,
quite apart from the administra
tive difficulties extant, a pro
nounced dissatisfaction with the
very nature of the format itself.
In the student survey, 61.2 per
cent of those students polled ob
tained their first choice. How
ever, only 50 per cent would
have taken the subject if not
required, and only 54.3 per cent
viewed the course, in retrospect,
as worthwhile. Even more sig
nificant, 62.2 per cent do not be
lieve that their colloquia ful
filled the expressed purpose of
the program.
Obviously, the problem ex
tends beyond "getting the right
course." The nature of the col
loquia offerings themselves, par
ticularly their rigidity in
breadth, is of great concern.
Even those who do obtain their
best possible colloquia find the
class uninteresting or unimpor
tant. Most of the 62 per cent who
see the colloquias fail in their
intended purpose stress the lack
of the "introduction of impor
tant material outside (the) ma
jor." Sixty per cent of those
polled offered, on their own vo
lition, suggestions to render
course offerings more flexible.
Most popular were ideas to
widen the choice possibilities
and investigate students initia
tive plans.
In order to most effectively
achieve an "alternative to the
lecture system . . . with small
group discussion," and to truly
"take advantage of the student's
improved knowledge and matu
rity of judgment," it is suggest
ed that the student be permitted
to choose his own course and
method of study. For this Com
mittee shares the view that after
several years of exposure to the
flow of ideas within the Univer
sity, almost every student has
developed a number of particu
lar interests tangent to, or a
part from, his obligatory course
work. Yet in most of these in
stances a student has neither
the time nor the resources to ex
plore any of these areas. Furth
er, this Committee shares the
belief that at this point students
indeed do possess the "maturity
of judgment" to rewardingly ex
plore these areas without re
course to the inflexibility of syl
labi, required papers or tests.
There can be little doubt in
such a system that if a student
fails to satisfy his course expec
tations he has only himself to
blame.
It is expected that the atmo
sphere will be even more con
ducive to the "on-the-spot analy
sis and interpretation" that is
part of the program's goal. As
each student presents his dis
coveries, others will subject his
findings and methods to criti
cism for the facilitation of fur
ther discovery.
The establishment of a pro
gram allowing maximum free
dom and spontaneity is this
Committee's hope. To this end,
the Committee recommends the
implementation of six major re
visions in the present program.
Student Initiative
1. Over the past several years,
Dean's Walker and Wert have
authorized seminars designated
under the category '.Undergrad
uate Special." Often these cour
ses are the result of student
initiated proposals for addends
to the curriculum. They are
quite limited in size and infor
mal in nature. Usually, the
group of students originally re
questing the course make up
most of the class. The success
of these courses is unmistakable.
Although they include subject

matter ranging from education
to nuclear disarmament, there
are few complaints of not hav
ing received, in depth, important
knowledge that serves to diver
sify and broaden. The applica
tion of such a program is strong
ly recommended. The plan
would work thusly:
One quarter in advance all
professors who are willing and
able to lead a course would sub
mit their names and preferred
subject area.
Students, who will be inform
ed of their opportunity, will
sign up under desired profes
sors, or may approach them
with proposed specific topics. A
minimum of five students re
questing a similar topic will
authorize its inclusion. Any va
cancies would be left for filling
by the general student body
once the courses formed are
listed in the Time Schedule.
They would then be subject to
the same registration procedures
as any other course until the
allowed maximum size is at
tained. This would be on the
normal first come first serve
basis.
It is hoped that students will
be allowed to invite two, or pos
sibly even three professors to
lead the group sequentially or
simultaneously. This allows even
greater flexibilit in format,
often increases the spontaneity,
and most important, creates a
dialectism of expertise which
further stimulates class meet
ings.
It is suggested that the class
format consist of highly indivi
dualized investigations of the
subject matter without paper,
test or reading requirements.
Suggested reading would be en
couraged. The examination of
various findings, in the form of
oral and written reports (if de
sired) and following discussion
is the intended procedure.
The demand for a curriculum
input from the student body is
undeniable, particularly from
the student view. Surprising,
however, is the astonishing sup
port given to the concept by the
faculty.
In the poll of the spring 1966
colloquia professors approved
the idea by an 84.2 per cent seg
ment.
In the larger general faculty
poll, the four point plan de
scribed above was endorsed by
92.4 per cent of those who an
swered the question.
Further, 82.9 per cent expres
sed a willingness to teach under
such an arrangement.
Finally, 36 offered their names
and times of availability for
1967. There can be no more
ample testimony to the enthu
siasm felt by the faculty at the
the prospect of leading a group
of students with a guaranteed
interest in the subject matter of
the course.
Optional
2. The second revision re
commended is the abolishment
of the required aspect. A purely
optional program insures only
the inclusion of those positively
interested in the course plan.
Such a provision, rather than
weakening the program's pur
poses, would strengthen them.
For the notion of "forcing" a
student to broaden himself con
flicts at heart with the nature
of the proposed program. One
can not impel a student to gen
erate a curiosity, or to make an
effort to satisfy it. For the en
deavor to be truly successful,
specifically, for it to engender
not only broader informational
bases, but broader interests and
a new enthusiasm for acade
mics, it is necessary to attract
and tempt, not push and cram.
The purpose of the program,
thus, is to light fires by making
itself so alive with ideas and

spontaneity that those with
even the least shred of curiosity
for anything outside their voca
tional shell, will be attracted tp
it.
Passâ€”Fail
3. This Committee feels that
a pass-fail system is justified
for many of the same reasons
that call for an optional pro
gram. True scholarship requires
no reward, it is its own. Furth
er, the manner of research,
separate and spontaneous, is not
conductive to precise grading.
And when there is grading on
the basis of discussion, students
tend to hide behind masks in
superficial performances for
sake of "one-upmanship." Time
is spent on petty issues, and the
free flow of ideas and clash tif
values are impeded.
Finally, after several years 9f
grades, the Committee feels that
many students rely on the de
vice for motivation. These stu
dents miss entirely one of the
primary assets of a University
education. It is hoped that by
offering several gradeles'g
courses in the latter part of the
undergraduate years, it will be
possible to create or revitalize
more genuine incentives.
Graduates Also
4. Thfe Committee recorp
mends the inclusion of all will
ing juniors into the program.
This would broaden the base for
course enrollment. Further, it is
felt that after two years many
students have the capability to
benefit from the program.
Finally, it would make indi
vidual schedules more flexible.
The senior year requirement
was originally conceived to get
seniors out of their major
courses. But this plus other de
mands of senior year have result
ed in many junior years filled en
tirely with courses in the major
field. Thus, the increased flexi
bility would create the oppor
tunity for a more balanced and
diversified schedule over the fi
nal two years of undergraduate
education.
It is the further suggestion
of this committee that graduate
students be included in the pro
gram despite the lack of definite
survey affirmation. It would be
necessary, however, to limit
their numbers to no more than
three per class. Their presence
in this restricted way can serve
as a source of experience for
more stimulating discussions.
Limitation
5. It is the recommendation
of this Committee that a maxi
mum limitation of ten students
be placed on each class. Such
a condition will enhance the in
timacy of the sessions, and en
able the participants to achieve
a greater depth in the examin
ation of reports and findings.
6. It is the final recommenda
tion of this Committee that for
purposes of schedule flexibility,
a student be allowed to take
from one to three units worth
of individual research. The de
termination for unit allowance
can be made between students
and the individual professors
leading their respective courses*
Variable Load
It is the further recommenda
tion of this Committee that
there be a limitation of thirty
units per student in the revised
program.
It is this Committee's hope
that the implementation of
these six revisions will become
a reality. It is hoped that the
Stanford student will have the
chance to mold a portion of his
education around his own evolv
ing curiosities. It is hoped that
he will develop a growing and
lasting thirst for academic dis
covery to take into his future
vocation and life.

whom had some interest in the
colloquia program. Subsequent
ly, three separate and extensive
questionnaires were formulated.

These included: 1) a sample poll
of the student body, 2) a poll of
all professors conducting senior
colloquias at that time (Spring
of 1966), 3) a large poll of the
general faculty, including twen
ty-two departments.
The new committees continued
the work, tabulating the scores
of forms that were arriving
throughout the latter part of
spring quarter 1966. During the
summer, the results from the
year of private discussions, and
from the three polls have been
compiled into the following re
port.
Program Purpose
The following explanation of
purpose was included in the
questionnaires.
"The present General Studies
Program, of which the senior
colloquia requirement is an in
tegral part, emerged from the
two-year intensive Study of Un
dergraduate Education, initiated
by President Sterling and con
ducted continuously from Au
gust 1954 to September 1956.
"The colloquia requirement
(2 two-unit colloquia in the se
nior year) grew out of a serious
questioning of the lecture sys
tem as a pedagogical device. It
was hoped that the colloquia
would provide a small group dis
cussion situation for a wider
range of Stanford students than
is possible in departmental semi

nars or the various honors pro
grams. By placing the require
ment in the senior year, It is
hoped that two things will be
accomplished: 1) general educa
tion will be carried into the
senior year which forces the
senior beyond the narrow bonds
of his major and acts as a
counter-part of that part of the
General Studies Program which
permits early specialization; and
2) the colloquia will take advan
tage of the students improved
knowledge and maturity of
judgment.
By closing the colloquia to
majors in the field of the of
fering, it is hoped that a kind of
cross-fertilization process will
take place, in which 6tudents
from a variety of disciplines will
gather together to shed light on
a common problem from their
various points of view. Finally,
it is hoped that the colloquia will
provide an educational exper
ience somewhat different from
the research seminar, by placing
greater emphasis on discussion
and on-the-spot interpretation,
analysis and testing of ideas,
and by replacing the research
paper with the less formal per
sonal, or 'creative' essay."
There is little doubt that many
of the expressed aims of the pro
gram have become a reality for
many Stanford undergraduates.
In recent years, however, chang
es have occured that have

greatly weakened the program.
There has been an evolution
from two directions. First, there
have been changes in the pro
gram per se over the past de
cade. Second, there have been
several changes in the educa
tional attitudes and expectations
that deem major adjustments
advisable for the more effective
accomplishment of the original
goals.
Decline Of Program
Originally, the senior col
loquia program was financed by
a Carnegie Corporation grant.
This backing, however, has dis
sipated and over the past sev
eral years the financial responsi
bility has shifted through the
Committee on General Studies
to the various departments. Fur
ther, the lack of funds at the de
partmental level earmarked for
specific colloquia uses has re
sulted in a flurry of "buckpas
sing" among departments, and
thus a decline in the number of
course offerings. It is generally
known that this is the chief rea
son for the recent change in the
colloquia requirement of from
two to one.
The departments, which must
compete almost viciously for
funds, are understandably reti
cent to "donate" faculty time
and expense for general studies
purposes. The difficulty, per
haps, lies with the need for
financial and academic leader
ship and coordination. This con
dition is underlined by the fact
that fifty per cent of the collo
quia professors spring quarter
of 1966 are under duress, or
unable altogether to teach fur
ther in the program due to the
"present compensation system."
These problems, of course, are
beyond student solution, and
must be worked out with, or by,
administration and faculty
groups. It might be suggested,
however, that if the proposed
changes that follow are adopted,

it could be worthwhile to change
the name of the program and
apply for foundation aid of some
sort.
Changing Needs
The poll results have reflected,
quite apart from the administra
tive difficulties extant, a pro
nounced dissatisfaction with the
very nature of the format itself.
In the student survey, 61.2 per
cent of those students polled ob
tained their first choice. How
ever, only 50 per cent would
have taken the subject if not
required, and only 54.3 per cent
viewed the course, in retrospect,
as worthwhile. Even more sig
nificant, 62.2 per cent do not be
lieve that their colloquia ful
filled the expressed purpose of
the program.
Obviously, the problem ex
tends beyond "getting the right
course." The nature of the col
loquia offerings themselves, par
ticularly their rigidity in
breadth, is of great concern.
Even those who do obtain their
best possible colloquia find the
class uninteresting or unimpor
tant. Most of the 62 per cent who
see the colloquias fail in their
intended purpose stress the lack
of the "introduction of impor
tant material outside (the) ma
jor." Sixty per cent of those
polled offered, on their own vo
lition, suggestions to render
course offerings more flexible.
Most popular were ideas to
widen the choice possibilities
and investigate students initia
tive plans.
In order to most effectively
achieve an "alternative to the
lecture system . . . with small
group discussion," and to truly
"take advantage of the student's
improved knowledge and matu
rity of judgment," it is suggest
ed that the student be permitted
to choose his own course and
method of study. For this Com
mittee shares the view that after
several years of exposure to the
flow of ideas within the Univer
sity, almost every student has
developed a number of particu
lar interests tangent to, or a
part from, his obligatory course
work. Yet in most of these in
stances a student has neither
the time nor the resources to ex
plore any of these areas. Furth
er, this Committee shares the
belief that at this point students
indeed do possess the "maturity
of judgment" to rewardingly ex
plore these areas without re
course to the inflexibility of syl
labi, required papers or tests.
There can be little doubt in
such a system that if a student
fails to satisfy his course expec
tations he has only himself to
blame.
It is expected that the atmo
sphere will be even more con
ducive to the "on-the-spot analy
sis and interpretation" that is
part of the program's goal. As
each student presents his dis
coveries, others will subject his
findings and methods to criti
cism for the facilitation of fur
ther discovery.
The establishment of a pro
gram allowing maximum free
dom and spontaneity is this
Committee's hope. To this end,
the Committee recommends the
implementation of six major re
visions in the present program.
Student Initiative
1. Over the past several years,
Dean's Walker and Wert have
authorized seminars designated
under the category '.Undergrad
uate Special." Often these cour
ses are the result of student
initiated proposals for addends
to the curriculum. They are
quite limited in size and infor
mal in nature. Usually, the
group of students originally re
questing the course make up
most of the class. The success
of these courses is unmistakable.
Although they include subject

matter ranging from education
to nuclear disarmament, there
are few complaints of not hav
ing received, in depth, important
knowledge that serves to diver
sify and broaden. The applica
tion of such a program is strong
ly recommended. The plan
would work thusly:
One quarter in advance all
professors who are willing and
able to lead a course would sub
mit their names and preferred
subject area.
Students, who will be inform
ed of their opportunity, will
sign up under desired profes
sors, or may approach them
with proposed specific topics. A
minimum of five students re
questing a similar topic will
authorize its inclusion. Any va
cancies would be left for filling
by the general student body
once the courses formed are
listed in the Time Schedule.
They would then be subject to
the same registration procedures
as any other course until the
allowed maximum size is at
tained. This would be on the
normal first come first serve
basis.
It is hoped that students will
be allowed to invite two, or pos
sibly even three professors to
lead the group sequentially or
simultaneously. This allows even
greater flexibilit in format,
often increases the spontaneity,
and most important, creates a
dialectism of expertise which
further stimulates class meet
ings.
It is suggested that the class
format consist of highly indivi
dualized investigations of the
subject matter without paper,
test or reading requirements.
Suggested reading would be en
couraged. The examination of
various findings, in the form of
oral and written reports (if de
sired) and following discussion
is the intended procedure.
The demand for a curriculum
input from the student body is
undeniable, particularly from
the student view. Surprising,
however, is the astonishing sup
port given to the concept by the
faculty.
In the poll of the spring 1966
colloquia professors approved
the idea by an 84.2 per cent seg
ment.
In the larger general faculty
poll, the four point plan de
scribed above was endorsed by
92.4 per cent of those who an
swered the question.
Further, 82.9 per cent expres
sed a willingness to teach under
such an arrangement.
Finally, 36 offered their names
and times of availability for
1967. There can be no more
ample testimony to the enthu
siasm felt by the faculty at the
the prospect of leading a group
of students with a guaranteed
interest in the subject matter of
the course.
Optional
2. The second revision re
commended is the abolishment
of the required aspect. A purely
optional program insures only
the inclusion of those positively
interested in the course plan.
Such a provision, rather than
weakening the program's pur
poses, would strengthen them.
For the notion of "forcing" a
student to broaden himself con
flicts at heart with the nature
of the proposed program. One
can not impel a student to gen
erate a curiosity, or to make an
effort to satisfy it. For the en
deavor to be truly successful,
specifically, for it to engender
not only broader informational
bases, but broader interests and
a new enthusiasm for acade
mics, it is necessary to attract
and tempt, not push and cram.
The purpose of the program,
thus, is to light fires by making
itself so alive with ideas and

spontaneity that those with
even the least shred of curiosity
for anything outside their voca
tional shell, will be attracted tp
it.
Passâ€”Fail
3. This Committee feels that
a pass-fail system is justified
for many of the same reasons
that call for an optional pro
gram. True scholarship requires
no reward, it is its own. Furth
er, the manner of research,
separate and spontaneous, is not
conductive to precise grading.
And when there is grading on
the basis of discussion, students
tend to hide behind masks in
superficial performances for
sake of "one-upmanship." Time
is spent on petty issues, and the
free flow of ideas and clash tif
values are impeded.
Finally, after several years 9f
grades, the Committee feels that
many students rely on the de
vice for motivation. These stu
dents miss entirely one of the
primary assets of a University
education. It is hoped that by
offering several gradeles'g
courses in the latter part of the
undergraduate years, it will be
possible to create or revitalize
more genuine incentives.
Graduates Also
4. Thfe Committee recorp
mends the inclusion of all will
ing juniors into the program.
This would broaden the base for
course enrollment. Further, it is
felt that after two years many
students have the capability to
benefit from the program.
Finally, it would make indi
vidual schedules more flexible.
The senior year requirement
was originally conceived to get
seniors out of their major
courses. But this plus other de
mands of senior year have result
ed in many junior years filled en
tirely with courses in the major
field. Thus, the increased flexi
bility would create the oppor
tunity for a more balanced and
diversified schedule over the fi
nal two years of undergraduate
education.
It is the further suggestion
of this committee that graduate
students be included in the pro
gram despite the lack of definite
survey affirmation. It would be
necessary, however, to limit
their numbers to no more than
three per class. Their presence
in this restricted way can serve
as a source of experience for
more stimulating discussions.
Limitation
5. It is the recommendation
of this Committee that a maxi
mum limitation of ten students
be placed on each class. Such
a condition will enhance the in
timacy of the sessions, and en
able the participants to achieve
a greater depth in the examin
ation of reports and findings.
6. It is the final recommenda
tion of this Committee that for
purposes of schedule flexibility,
a student be allowed to take
from one to three units worth
of individual research. The de
termination for unit allowance
can be made between students
and the individual professors
leading their respective courses*
Variable Load
It is the further recommenda
tion of this Committee that
there be a limitation of thirty
units per student in the revised
program.
It is this Committee's hope
that the implementation of
these six revisions will become
a reality. It is hoped that the
Stanford student will have the
chance to mold a portion of his
education around his own evolv
ing curiosities. It is hoped that
he will develop a growing and
lasting thirst for academic dis
covery to take into his future
vocation and life.
Bob Fellmeth, Chairman
(Editor's note. The following Is
an excerpted text of the Joint
Report of the Senior Colloquia
Committee of the ASSU Educa
tion Committee and The Senior
Class for Curriculum Reform.)
During the 1965 â€¢ 1966 year,
the student legislature appoint
ed an Education Commission to
conduct an inquiry into educa
tion at Stanford with hopes for
student initiated reform. As part
of this endeavor, the Commis
sion assumed responsibility for
the evaluation of the senior col
loquia plan.
The need for a thorough study
of this particular part of the
general studies scheme was the

and the precise causes thereof

two-year intensive Study of Un
dergraduate Education, initiated
by President Sterling and con
ducted continuously from Au
gust 1954 to September 1956.
"The colloquia requirement
(2 two-unit colloquia in the se
nior year) grew out of a serious
questioning of the lecture sys
tem as a pedagogical device. It
was hoped that the colloquia
would provide a small group dis
cussion situation for a wider
range of Stanford students than
is possible in departmental semi

nars or the various honors pro
grams. By placing the require
ment in the senior year, It is
hoped that two things will be
accomplished: 1) general educa
tion will be carried into the
senior year which forces the
senior beyond the narrow bonds
of his major and acts as a
counter-part of that part of the
General Studies Program which
permits early specialization; and
2) the colloquia will take advan
tage of the students improved
knowledge and maturity of
judgment.
By closing the colloquia to
majors in the field of the of
fering, it is hoped that a kind of
cross-fertilization process will
take place, in which 6tudents
from a variety of disciplines will
gather together to shed light on
a common problem from their
various points of view. Finally,
it is hoped that the colloquia will
provide an educational exper
ience somewhat different from
the research seminar, by placing
greater emphasis on discussion
and on-the-spot interpretation,
analysis and testing of ideas,
and by replacing the research
paper with the less formal per
sonal, or 'creative' essay."
There is little doubt that many
of the expressed aims of the pro
gram have become a reality for
many Stanford undergraduates.
In recent years, however, chang
es have occured that have

greatly weakened the program.
There has been an evolution
from two directions. First, there
have been changes in the pro
gram per se over the past de
cade. Second, there have been
several changes in the educa
tional attitudes and expectations
that deem major adjustments
advisable for the more effective
accomplishment of the original
goals.
Decline Of Program
Originally, the senior col
loquia program was financed by
a Carnegie Corporation grant.
This backing, however, has dis
sipated and over the past sev
eral years the financial responsi
bility has shifted through the
Committee on General Studies
to the various departments. Fur
ther, the lack of funds at the de
partmental level earmarked for
specific colloquia uses has re
sulted in a flurry of "buckpas
sing" among departments, and
thus a decline in the number of
course offerings. It is generally
known that this is the chief rea
son for the recent change in the
colloquia requirement of from
two to one.
The departments, which must
compete almost viciously for
funds, are understandably reti
cent to "donate" faculty time
and expense for general studies
purposes. The difficulty, per
haps, lies with the need for
financial and academic leader
ship and coordination. This con
dition is underlined by the fact
that fifty per cent of the collo
quia professors spring quarter
of 1966 are under duress, or
unable altogether to teach fur
ther in the program due to the
"present compensation system."
These problems, of course, are
beyond student solution, and
must be worked out with, or by,
administration and faculty
groups. It might be suggested,
however, that if the proposed
changes that follow are adopted,

it could be worthwhile to change
the name of the program and
apply for foundation aid of some
sort.
Changing Needs
The poll results have reflected,
quite apart from the administra
tive difficulties extant, a pro
nounced dissatisfaction with the
very nature of the format itself.
In the student survey, 61.2 per
cent of those students polled ob
tained their first choice. How
ever, only 50 per cent would
have taken the subject if not
required, and only 54.3 per cent
viewed the course, in retrospect,
as worthwhile. Even more sig
nificant, 62.2 per cent do not be
lieve that their colloquia ful
filled the expressed purpose of
the program.
Obviously, the problem ex
tends beyond "getting the right
course." The nature of the col
loquia offerings themselves, par
ticularly their rigidity in
breadth, is of great concern.
Even those who do obtain their
best possible colloquia find the
class uninteresting or unimpor
tant. Most of the 62 per cent who
see the colloquias fail in their
intended purpose stress the lack
of the "introduction of impor
tant material outside (the) ma
jor." Sixty per cent of those
polled offered, on their own vo
lition, suggestions to render
course offerings more flexible.
Most popular were ideas to
widen the choice possibilities
and investigate students initia
tive plans.
In order to most effectively
achieve an "alternative to the
lecture system . . . with small
group discussion," and to truly
"take advantage of the student's
improved knowledge and matu
rity of judgment," it is suggest
ed that the student be permitted
to choose his own course and
method of study. For this Com
mittee shares the view that after
several years of exposure to the
flow of ideas within the Univer
sity, almost every student has
developed a number of particu
lar interests tangent to, or a
part from, his obligatory course
work. Yet in most of these in
stances a student has neither
the time nor the resources to ex
plore any of these areas. Furth
er, this Committee shares the
belief that at this point students
indeed do possess the "maturity
of judgment" to rewardingly ex
plore these areas without re
course to the inflexibility of syl
labi, required papers or tests.
There can be little doubt in
such a system that if a student
fails to satisfy his course expec
tations he has only himself to
blame.
It is expected that the atmo
sphere will be even more con
ducive to the "on-the-spot analy
sis and interpretation" that is
part of the program's goal. As
each student presents his dis
coveries, others will subject his
findings and methods to criti
cism for the facilitation of fur
ther discovery.
The establishment of a pro
gram allowing maximum free
dom and spontaneity is this
Committee's hope. To this end,
the Committee recommends the
implementation of six major re
visions in the present program.
Student Initiative
1. Over the past several years,
Dean's Walker and Wert have
authorized seminars designated
under the category '.Undergrad
uate Special." Often these cour
ses are the result of student
initiated proposals for addends
to the curriculum. They are
quite limited in size and infor
mal in nature. Usually, the
group of students originally re
questing the course make up
most of the class. The success
of these courses is unmistakable.
Although they include subject

matter ranging from education
to nuclear disarmament, there
are few complaints of not hav
ing received, in depth, important
knowledge that serves to diver
sify and broaden. The applica
tion of such a program is strong
ly recommended. The plan
would work thusly:
One quarter in advance all
professors who are willing and
able to lead a course would sub
mit their names and preferred
subject area.
Students, who will be inform
ed of their opportunity, will
sign up under desired profes
sors, or may approach them
with proposed specific topics. A
minimum of five students re
questing a similar topic will
authorize its inclusion. Any va
cancies would be left for filling
by the general student body
once the courses formed are
listed in the Time Schedule.
They would then be subject to
the same registration procedures
as any other course until the
allowed maximum size is at
tained. This would be on the
normal first come first serve
basis.
It is hoped that students will
be allowed to invite two, or pos
sibly even three professors to
lead the group sequentially or
simultaneously. This allows even
greater flexibilit in format,
often increases the spontaneity,
and most important, creates a
dialectism of expertise which
further stimulates class meet
ings.
It is suggested that the class
format consist of highly indivi
dualized investigations of the
subject matter without paper,
test or reading requirements.
Suggested reading would be en
couraged. The examination of
various findings, in the form of
oral and written reports (if de
sired) and following discussion
is the intended procedure.
The demand for a curriculum
input from the student body is
undeniable, particularly from
the student view. Surprising,
however, is the astonishing sup
port given to the concept by the
faculty.
In the poll of the spring 1966
colloquia professors approved
the idea by an 84.2 per cent seg
ment.
In the larger general faculty
poll, the four point plan de
scribed above was endorsed by
92.4 per cent of those who an
swered the question.
Further, 82.9 per cent expres
sed a willingness to teach under
such an arrangement.
Finally, 36 offered their names
and times of availability for
1967. There can be no more
ample testimony to the enthu
siasm felt by the faculty at the
the prospect of leading a group
of students with a guaranteed
interest in the subject matter of
the course.
Optional
2. The second revision re
commended is the abolishment
of the required aspect. A purely
optional program insures only
the inclusion of those positively
interested in the course plan.
Such a provision, rather than
weakening the program's pur
poses, would strengthen them.
For the notion of "forcing" a
student to broaden himself con
flicts at heart with the nature
of the proposed program. One
can not impel a student to gen
erate a curiosity, or to make an
effort to satisfy it. For the en
deavor to be truly successful,
specifically, for it to engender
not only broader informational
bases, but broader interests and
a new enthusiasm for acade
mics, it is necessary to attract
and tempt, not push and cram.
The purpose of the program,
thus, is to light fires by making
itself so alive with ideas and

spontaneity that those with
even the least shred of curiosity
for anything outside their voca
tional shell, will be attracted tp
it.
Passâ€”Fail
3. This Committee feels that
a pass-fail system is justified
for many of the same reasons
that call for an optional pro
gram. True scholarship requires
no reward, it is its own. Furth
er, the manner of research,
separate and spontaneous, is not
conductive to precise grading.
And when there is grading on
the basis of discussion, students
tend to hide behind masks in
superficial performances for
sake of "one-upmanship." Time
is spent on petty issues, and the
free flow of ideas and clash tif
values are impeded.
Finally, after several years 9f
grades, the Committee feels that
many students rely on the de
vice for motivation. These stu
dents miss entirely one of the
primary assets of a University
education. It is hoped that by
offering several gradeles'g
courses in the latter part of the
undergraduate years, it will be
possible to create or revitalize
more genuine incentives.
Graduates Also
4. Thfe Committee recorp
mends the inclusion of all will
ing juniors into the program.
This would broaden the base for
course enrollment. Further, it is
felt that after two years many
students have the capability to
benefit from the program.
Finally, it would make indi
vidual schedules more flexible.
The senior year requirement
was originally conceived to get
seniors out of their major
courses. But this plus other de
mands of senior year have result
ed in many junior years filled en
tirely with courses in the major
field. Thus, the increased flexi
bility would create the oppor
tunity for a more balanced and
diversified schedule over the fi
nal two years of undergraduate
education.
It is the further suggestion
of this committee that graduate
students be included in the pro
gram despite the lack of definite
survey affirmation. It would be
necessary, however, to limit
their numbers to no more than
three per class. Their presence
in this restricted way can serve
as a source of experience for
more stimulating discussions.
Limitation
5. It is the recommendation
of this Committee that a maxi
mum limitation of ten students
be placed on each class. Such
a condition will enhance the in
timacy of the sessions, and en
able the participants to achieve
a greater depth in the examin
ation of reports and findings.
6. It is the final recommenda
tion of this Committee that for
purposes of schedule flexibility,
a student be allowed to take
from one to three units worth
of individual research. The de
termination for unit allowance
can be made between students
and the individual professors
leading their respective courses*
Variable Load
It is the further recommenda
tion of this Committee that
there be a limitation of thirty
units per student in the revised
program.
It is this Committee's hope
that the implementation of
these six revisions will become
a reality. It is hoped that the
Stanford student will have the
chance to mold a portion of his
education around his own evolv
ing curiosities. It is hoped that
he will develop a growing and
lasting thirst for academic dis
covery to take into his future
vocation and life.
Bob Fellmeth, Chairman
(Editor's note. The following Is
an excerpted text of the Joint
Report of the Senior Colloquia
Committee of the ASSU Educa
tion Committee and The Senior
Class for Curriculum Reform.)
During the 1965 â€¢ 1966 year,
the student legislature appoint
ed an Education Commission to
conduct an inquiry into educa
tion at Stanford with hopes for
student initiated reform. As part
of this endeavor, the Commis
sion assumed responsibility for
the evaluation of the senior col
loquia plan.
The need for a thorough study
of this particular part of the
general studies scheme was the
result of an evident disintegra
tion of the present program.
The sources of dissatisfaction
and the precise causes thereof
were not as clear.
There ensued a series of per
sonal and confidential inter
views with numerous student
and faculty leaders, most of
whom had some interest in the
colloquia program. Subsequent
ly, three separate and extensive
questionnaires were formulated.

These included: 1) a sample poll
of the student body, 2) a poll of
all professors conducting senior
colloquias at that time (Spring
of 1966), 3) a large poll of the
general faculty, including twen
ty-two departments.
The new committees continued
the work, tabulating the scores
of forms that were arriving
throughout the latter part of
spring quarter 1966. During the
summer, the results from the
year of private discussions, and
from the three polls have been
compiled into the following re
port.
Program Purpose
The following explanation of
purpose was included in the
questionnaires.
"The present General Studies

2) the colloquia will take advan
tage of the students improved
knowledge and maturity of
judgment.
By closing the colloquia to
majors in the field of the of
fering, it is hoped that a kind of
cross-fertilization process will
take place, in which 6tudents
from a variety of disciplines will
gather together to shed light on
a common problem from their
various points of view. Finally,
it is hoped that the colloquia will
provide an educational exper
ience somewhat different from
the research seminar, by placing
greater emphasis on discussion
and on-the-spot interpretation,
analysis and testing of ideas,
and by replacing the research
paper with the less formal per
sonal, or 'creative' essay."
There is little doubt that many
of the expressed aims of the pro
gram have become a reality for
many Stanford undergraduates.
In recent years, however, chang
es have occured that have

greatly weakened the program.
There has been an evolution
from two directions. First, there
have been changes in the pro
gram per se over the past de
cade. Second, there have been
several changes in the educa
tional attitudes and expectations
that deem major adjustments
advisable for the more effective
accomplishment of the original
goals.
Decline Of Program
Originally, the senior col
loquia program was financed by
a Carnegie Corporation grant.
This backing, however, has dis
sipated and over the past sev
eral years the financial responsi
bility has shifted through the
Committee on General Studies
to the various departments. Fur
ther, the lack of funds at the de
partmental level earmarked for
specific colloquia uses has re
sulted in a flurry of "buckpas
sing" among departments, and
thus a decline in the number of
course offerings. It is generally
known that this is the chief rea
son for the recent change in the
colloquia requirement of from
two to one.
The departments, which must
compete almost viciously for
funds, are understandably reti
cent to "donate" faculty time
and expense for general studies
purposes. The difficulty, per
haps, lies with the need for
financial and academic leader
ship and coordination. This con
dition is underlined by the fact
that fifty per cent of the collo
quia professors spring quarter
of 1966 are under duress, or
unable altogether to teach fur
ther in the program due to the
"present compensation system."
These problems, of course, are
beyond student solution, and
must be worked out with, or by,
administration and faculty
groups. It might be suggested,
however, that if the proposed
changes that follow are adopted,

it could be worthwhile to change
the name of the program and
apply for foundation aid of some
sort.
Changing Needs
The poll results have reflected,
quite apart from the administra
tive difficulties extant, a pro
nounced dissatisfaction with the
very nature of the format itself.
In the student survey, 61.2 per
cent of those students polled ob
tained their first choice. How
ever, only 50 per cent would
have taken the subject if not
required, and only 54.3 per cent
viewed the course, in retrospect,
as worthwhile. Even more sig
nificant, 62.2 per cent do not be
lieve that their colloquia ful
filled the expressed purpose of
the program.
Obviously, the problem ex
tends beyond "getting the right
course." The nature of the col
loquia offerings themselves, par
ticularly their rigidity in
breadth, is of great concern.
Even those who do obtain their
best possible colloquia find the
class uninteresting or unimpor
tant. Most of the 62 per cent who
see the colloquias fail in their
intended purpose stress the lack
of the "introduction of impor
tant material outside (the) ma
jor." Sixty per cent of those
polled offered, on their own vo
lition, suggestions to render
course offerings more flexible.
Most popular were ideas to
widen the choice possibilities
and investigate students initia
tive plans.
In order to most effectively
achieve an "alternative to the
lecture system . . . with small
group discussion," and to truly
"take advantage of the student's
improved knowledge and matu
rity of judgment," it is suggest
ed that the student be permitted
to choose his own course and
method of study. For this Com
mittee shares the view that after
several years of exposure to the
flow of ideas within the Univer
sity, almost every student has
developed a number of particu
lar interests tangent to, or a
part from, his obligatory course
work. Yet in most of these in
stances a student has neither
the time nor the resources to ex
plore any of these areas. Furth
er, this Committee shares the
belief that at this point students
indeed do possess the "maturity
of judgment" to rewardingly ex
plore these areas without re
course to the inflexibility of syl
labi, required papers or tests.
There can be little doubt in
such a system that if a student
fails to satisfy his course expec
tations he has only himself to
blame.
It is expected that the atmo
sphere will be even more con
ducive to the "on-the-spot analy
sis and interpretation" that is
part of the program's goal. As
each student presents his dis
coveries, others will subject his
findings and methods to criti
cism for the facilitation of fur
ther discovery.
The establishment of a pro
gram allowing maximum free
dom and spontaneity is this
Committee's hope. To this end,
the Committee recommends the
implementation of six major re
visions in the present program.
Student Initiative
1. Over the past several years,
Dean's Walker and Wert have
authorized seminars designated
under the category '.Undergrad
uate Special." Often these cour
ses are the result of student
initiated proposals for addends
to the curriculum. They are
quite limited in size and infor
mal in nature. Usually, the
group of students originally re
questing the course make up
most of the class. The success
of these courses is unmistakable.
Although they include subject

matter ranging from education
to nuclear disarmament, there
are few complaints of not hav
ing received, in depth, important
knowledge that serves to diver
sify and broaden. The applica
tion of such a program is strong
ly recommended. The plan
would work thusly:
One quarter in advance all
professors who are willing and
able to lead a course would sub
mit their names and preferred
subject area.
Students, who will be inform
ed of their opportunity, will
sign up under desired profes
sors, or may approach them
with proposed specific topics. A
minimum of five students re
questing a similar topic will
authorize its inclusion. Any va
cancies would be left for filling
by the general student body
once the courses formed are
listed in the Time Schedule.
They would then be subject to
the same registration procedures
as any other course until the
allowed maximum size is at
tained. This would be on the
normal first come first serve
basis.
It is hoped that students will
be allowed to invite two, or pos
sibly even three professors to
lead the group sequentially or
simultaneously. This allows even
greater flexibilit in format,
often increases the spontaneity,
and most important, creates a
dialectism of expertise which
further stimulates class meet
ings.
It is suggested that the class
format consist of highly indivi
dualized investigations of the
subject matter without paper,
test or reading requirements.
Suggested reading would be en
couraged. The examination of
various findings, in the form of
oral and written reports (if de
sired) and following discussion
is the intended procedure.
The demand for a curriculum
input from the student body is
undeniable, particularly from
the student view. Surprising,
however, is the astonishing sup
port given to the concept by the
faculty.
In the poll of the spring 1966
colloquia professors approved
the idea by an 84.2 per cent seg
ment.
In the larger general faculty
poll, the four point plan de
scribed above was endorsed by
92.4 per cent of those who an
swered the question.
Further, 82.9 per cent expres
sed a willingness to teach under
such an arrangement.
Finally, 36 offered their names
and times of availability for
1967. There can be no more
ample testimony to the enthu
siasm felt by the faculty at the
the prospect of leading a group
of students with a guaranteed
interest in the subject matter of
the course.
Optional
2. The second revision re
commended is the abolishment
of the required aspect. A purely
optional program insures only
the inclusion of those positively
interested in the course plan.
Such a provision, rather than
weakening the program's pur
poses, would strengthen them.
For the notion of "forcing" a
student to broaden himself con
flicts at heart with the nature
of the proposed program. One
can not impel a student to gen
erate a curiosity, or to make an
effort to satisfy it. For the en
deavor to be truly successful,
specifically, for it to engender
not only broader informational
bases, but broader interests and
a new enthusiasm for acade
mics, it is necessary to attract
and tempt, not push and cram.
The purpose of the program,
thus, is to light fires by making
itself so alive with ideas and

spontaneity that those with
even the least shred of curiosity
for anything outside their voca
tional shell, will be attracted tp
it.
Passâ€”Fail
3. This Committee feels that
a pass-fail system is justified
for many of the same reasons
that call for an optional pro
gram. True scholarship requires
no reward, it is its own. Furth
er, the manner of research,
separate and spontaneous, is not
conductive to precise grading.
And when there is grading on
the basis of discussion, students
tend to hide behind masks in
superficial performances for
sake of "one-upmanship." Time
is spent on petty issues, and the
free flow of ideas and clash tif
values are impeded.
Finally, after several years 9f
grades, the Committee feels that
many students rely on the de
vice for motivation. These stu
dents miss entirely one of the
primary assets of a University
education. It is hoped that by
offering several gradeles'g
courses in the latter part of the
undergraduate years, it will be
possible to create or revitalize
more genuine incentives.
Graduates Also
4. Thfe Committee recorp
mends the inclusion of all will
ing juniors into the program.
This would broaden the base for
course enrollment. Further, it is
felt that after two years many
students have the capability to
benefit from the program.
Finally, it would make indi
vidual schedules more flexible.
The senior year requirement
was originally conceived to get
seniors out of their major
courses. But this plus other de
mands of senior year have result
ed in many junior years filled en
tirely with courses in the major
field. Thus, the increased flexi
bility would create the oppor
tunity for a more balanced and
diversified schedule over the fi
nal two years of undergraduate
education.
It is the further suggestion
of this committee that graduate
students be included in the pro
gram despite the lack of definite
survey affirmation. It would be
necessary, however, to limit
their numbers to no more than
three per class. Their presence
in this restricted way can serve
as a source of experience for
more stimulating discussions.
Limitation
5. It is the recommendation
of this Committee that a maxi
mum limitation of ten students
be placed on each class. Such
a condition will enhance the in
timacy of the sessions, and en
able the participants to achieve
a greater depth in the examin
ation of reports and findings.
6. It is the final recommenda
tion of this Committee that for
purposes of schedule flexibility,
a student be allowed to take
from one to three units worth
of individual research. The de
termination for unit allowance
can be made between students
and the individual professors
leading their respective courses*
Variable Load
It is the further recommenda
tion of this Committee that
there be a limitation of thirty
units per student in the revised
program.
It is this Committee's hope
that the implementation of
these six revisions will become
a reality. It is hoped that the
Stanford student will have the
chance to mold a portion of his
education around his own evolv
ing curiosities. It is hoped that
he will develop a growing and
lasting thirst for academic dis
covery to take into his future
vocation and life.
Bob Fellmeth, Chairman
(Editor's note. The following Is
an excerpted text of the Joint
Report of the Senior Colloquia
Committee of the ASSU Educa
tion Committee and The Senior
Class for Curriculum Reform.)
During the 1965 â€¢ 1966 year,
the student legislature appoint
ed an Education Commission to
conduct an inquiry into educa
tion at Stanford with hopes for
student initiated reform. As part
of this endeavor, the Commis
sion assumed responsibility for
the evaluation of the senior col
loquia plan.
The need for a thorough study
of this particular part of the
general studies scheme was the
result of an evident disintegra
tion of the present program.
The sources of dissatisfaction
and the precise causes thereof
were not as clear.
There ensued a series of per
sonal and confidential inter
views with numerous student
and faculty leaders, most of
whom had some interest in the
colloquia program. Subsequent
ly, three separate and extensive
questionnaires were formulated.

These included: 1) a sample poll
of the student body, 2) a poll of
all professors conducting senior
colloquias at that time (Spring
of 1966), 3) a large poll of the
general faculty, including twen
ty-two departments.
The new committees continued
the work, tabulating the scores
of forms that were arriving
throughout the latter part of
spring quarter 1966. During the
summer, the results from the
year of private discussions, and
from the three polls have been
compiled into the following re
port.
Program Purpose
The following explanation of
purpose was included in the
questionnaires.
"The present General Studies
Program, of which the senior
colloquia requirement is an in
tegral part, emerged from the
two-year intensive Study of Un
dergraduate Education, initiated
by President Sterling and con
ducted continuously from Au
gust 1954 to September 1956.
"The colloquia requirement
(2 two-unit colloquia in the se
nior year) grew out of a serious
questioning of the lecture sys
tem as a pedagogical device. It
was hoped that the colloquia
would provide a small group dis
cussion situation for a wider
range of Stanford students than
is possible in departmental semi

nars or the various honors pro
grams. By placing the require
ment in the senior year, It is
hoped that two things will be
accomplished: 1) general educa
tion will be carried into the
senior year which forces the
senior beyond the narrow bonds
of his major and acts as a
counter-part of that part of the
General Studies Program which
permits early specialization; and
2) the colloquia will take advan
tage of the students improved
knowledge and maturity of
judgment.
By closing the colloquia to
majors in the field of the of
fering, it is hoped that a kind of
cross-fertilization process will
take place, in which 6tudents
from a variety of disciplines will
gather together to shed light on
a common problem from their

es have occured that have

greatly weakened the program.
There has been an evolution
from two directions. First, there
have been changes in the pro
gram per se over the past de
cade. Second, there have been
several changes in the educa
tional attitudes and expectations
that deem major adjustments
advisable for the more effective
accomplishment of the original
goals.
Decline Of Program
Originally, the senior col
loquia program was financed by
a Carnegie Corporation grant.
This backing, however, has dis
sipated and over the past sev
eral years the financial responsi
bility has shifted through the
Committee on General Studies
to the various departments. Fur
ther, the lack of funds at the de
partmental level earmarked for
specific colloquia uses has re
sulted in a flurry of "buckpas
sing" among departments, and
thus a decline in the number of
course offerings. It is generally
known that this is the chief rea
son for the recent change in the
colloquia requirement of from
two to one.
The departments, which must
compete almost viciously for
funds, are understandably reti
cent to "donate" faculty time
and expense for general studies
purposes. The difficulty, per
haps, lies with the need for
financial and academic leader
ship and coordination. This con
dition is underlined by the fact
that fifty per cent of the collo
quia professors spring quarter
of 1966 are under duress, or
unable altogether to teach fur
ther in the program due to the
"present compensation system."
These problems, of course, are
beyond student solution, and
must be worked out with, or by,
administration and faculty
groups. It might be suggested,
however, that if the proposed
changes that follow are adopted,

it could be worthwhile to change
the name of the program and
apply for foundation aid of some
sort.
Changing Needs
The poll results have reflected,
quite apart from the administra
tive difficulties extant, a pro
nounced dissatisfaction with the
very nature of the format itself.
In the student survey, 61.2 per
cent of those students polled ob
tained their first choice. How
ever, only 50 per cent would
have taken the subject if not
required, and only 54.3 per cent
viewed the course, in retrospect,
as worthwhile. Even more sig
nificant, 62.2 per cent do not be
lieve that their colloquia ful
filled the expressed purpose of
the program.
Obviously, the problem ex
tends beyond "getting the right
course." The nature of the col
loquia offerings themselves, par
ticularly their rigidity in
breadth, is of great concern.
Even those who do obtain their
best possible colloquia find the
class uninteresting or unimpor
tant. Most of the 62 per cent who
see the colloquias fail in their
intended purpose stress the lack
of the "introduction of impor
tant material outside (the) ma
jor." Sixty per cent of those
polled offered, on their own vo
lition, suggestions to render
course offerings more flexible.
Most popular were ideas to
widen the choice possibilities
and investigate students initia
tive plans.
In order to most effectively
achieve an "alternative to the
lecture system . . . with small
group discussion," and to truly
"take advantage of the student's
improved knowledge and matu
rity of judgment," it is suggest
ed that the student be permitted
to choose his own course and
method of study. For this Com
mittee shares the view that after
several years of exposure to the
flow of ideas within the Univer
sity, almost every student has
developed a number of particu
lar interests tangent to, or a
part from, his obligatory course
work. Yet in most of these in
stances a student has neither
the time nor the resources to ex
plore any of these areas. Furth
er, this Committee shares the
belief that at this point students
indeed do possess the "maturity
of judgment" to rewardingly ex
plore these areas without re
course to the inflexibility of syl
labi, required papers or tests.
There can be little doubt in
such a system that if a student
fails to satisfy his course expec
tations he has only himself to
blame.
It is expected that the atmo
sphere will be even more con
ducive to the "on-the-spot analy
sis and interpretation" that is
part of the program's goal. As
each student presents his dis
coveries, others will subject his
findings and methods to criti
cism for the facilitation of fur
ther discovery.
The establishment of a pro
gram allowing maximum free
dom and spontaneity is this
Committee's hope. To this end,
the Committee recommends the
implementation of six major re
visions in the present program.
Student Initiative
1. Over the past several years,
Dean's Walker and Wert have
authorized seminars designated
under the category '.Undergrad
uate Special." Often these cour
ses are the result of student
initiated proposals for addends
to the curriculum. They are
quite limited in size and infor
mal in nature. Usually, the
group of students originally re
questing the course make up
most of the class. The success
of these courses is unmistakable.
Although they include subject

matter ranging from education
to nuclear disarmament, there
are few complaints of not hav
ing received, in depth, important
knowledge that serves to diver
sify and broaden. The applica
tion of such a program is strong
ly recommended. The plan
would work thusly:
One quarter in advance all
professors who are willing and
able to lead a course would sub
mit their names and preferred
subject area.
Students, who will be inform
ed of their opportunity, will
sign up under desired profes
sors, or may approach them
with proposed specific topics. A
minimum of five students re
questing a similar topic will
authorize its inclusion. Any va
cancies would be left for filling
by the general student body
once the courses formed are
listed in the Time Schedule.
They would then be subject to
the same registration procedures
as any other course until the
allowed maximum size is at
tained. This would be on the
normal first come first serve
basis.
It is hoped that students will
be allowed to invite two, or pos
sibly even three professors to
lead the group sequentially or
simultaneously. This allows even
greater flexibilit in format,
often increases the spontaneity,
and most important, creates a
dialectism of expertise which
further stimulates class meet
ings.
It is suggested that the class
format consist of highly indivi
dualized investigations of the
subject matter without paper,
test or reading requirements.
Suggested reading would be en
couraged. The examination of
various findings, in the form of
oral and written reports (if de
sired) and following discussion
is the intended procedure.
The demand for a curriculum
input from the student body is
undeniable, particularly from
the student view. Surprising,
however, is the astonishing sup
port given to the concept by the
faculty.
In the poll of the spring 1966
colloquia professors approved
the idea by an 84.2 per cent seg
ment.
In the larger general faculty
poll, the four point plan de
scribed above was endorsed by
92.4 per cent of those who an
swered the question.
Further, 82.9 per cent expres
sed a willingness to teach under
such an arrangement.
Finally, 36 offered their names
and times of availability for
1967. There can be no more
ample testimony to the enthu
siasm felt by the faculty at the
the prospect of leading a group
of students with a guaranteed
interest in the subject matter of
the course.
Optional
2. The second revision re
commended is the abolishment
of the required aspect. A purely
optional program insures only
the inclusion of those positively
interested in the course plan.
Such a provision, rather than
weakening the program's pur
poses, would strengthen them.
For the notion of "forcing" a
student to broaden himself con
flicts at heart with the nature
of the proposed program. One
can not impel a student to gen
erate a curiosity, or to make an
effort to satisfy it. For the en
deavor to be truly successful,
specifically, for it to engender
not only broader informational
bases, but broader interests and
a new enthusiasm for acade
mics, it is necessary to attract
and tempt, not push and cram.
The purpose of the program,
thus, is to light fires by making
itself so alive with ideas and

spontaneity that those with
even the least shred of curiosity
for anything outside their voca
tional shell, will be attracted tp
it.
Passâ€”Fail
3. This Committee feels that
a pass-fail system is justified
for many of the same reasons
that call for an optional pro
gram. True scholarship requires
no reward, it is its own. Furth
er, the manner of research,
separate and spontaneous, is not
conductive to precise grading.
And when there is grading on
the basis of discussion, students
tend to hide behind masks in
superficial performances for
sake of "one-upmanship." Time
is spent on petty issues, and the
free flow of ideas and clash tif
values are impeded.
Finally, after several years 9f
grades, the Committee feels that
many students rely on the de
vice for motivation. These stu
dents miss entirely one of the
primary assets of a University
education. It is hoped that by
offering several gradeles'g
courses in the latter part of the
undergraduate years, it will be
possible to create or revitalize
more genuine incentives.
Graduates Also
4. Thfe Committee recorp
mends the inclusion of all will
ing juniors into the program.
This would broaden the base for
course enrollment. Further, it is
felt that after two years many
students have the capability to
benefit from the program.
Finally, it would make indi
vidual schedules more flexible.
The senior year requirement
was originally conceived to get
seniors out of their major
courses. But this plus other de
mands of senior year have result
ed in many junior years filled en
tirely with courses in the major
field. Thus, the increased flexi
bility would create the oppor
tunity for a more balanced and
diversified schedule over the fi
nal two years of undergraduate
education.
It is the further suggestion
of this committee that graduate
students be included in the pro
gram despite the lack of definite
survey affirmation. It would be
necessary, however, to limit
their numbers to no more than
three per class. Their presence
in this restricted way can serve
as a source of experience for
more stimulating discussions.
Limitation
5. It is the recommendation
of this Committee that a maxi
mum limitation of ten students
be placed on each class. Such
a condition will enhance the in
timacy of the sessions, and en
able the participants to achieve
a greater depth in the examin
ation of reports and findings.
6. It is the final recommenda
tion of this Committee that for
purposes of schedule flexibility,
a student be allowed to take
from one to three units worth
of individual research. The de
termination for unit allowance
can be made between students
and the individual professors
leading their respective courses*
Variable Load
It is the further recommenda
tion of this Committee that
there be a limitation of thirty
units per student in the revised
program.
It is this Committee's hope
that the implementation of
these six revisions will become
a reality. It is hoped that the
Stanford student will have the
chance to mold a portion of his
education around his own evolv
ing curiosities. It is hoped that
he will develop a growing and
lasting thirst for academic dis
covery to take into his future
vocation and life.
Bob Fellmeth, Chairman
(Editor's note. The following Is
an excerpted text of the Joint
Report of the Senior Colloquia
Committee of the ASSU Educa
tion Committee and The Senior
Class for Curriculum Reform.)
During the 1965 â€¢ 1966 year,
the student legislature appoint
ed an Education Commission to
conduct an inquiry into educa
tion at Stanford with hopes for
student initiated reform. As part
of this endeavor, the Commis
sion assumed responsibility for
the evaluation of the senior col
loquia plan.
The need for a thorough study
of this particular part of the
general studies scheme was the
result of an evident disintegra
tion of the present program.
The sources of dissatisfaction
and the precise causes thereof
were not as clear.
There ensued a series of per
sonal and confidential inter
views with numerous student
and faculty leaders, most of
whom had some interest in the
colloquia program. Subsequent
ly, three separate and extensive
questionnaires were formulated.

These included: 1) a sample poll
of the student body, 2) a poll of
all professors conducting senior
colloquias at that time (Spring
of 1966), 3) a large poll of the
general faculty, including twen
ty-two departments.
The new committees continued
the work, tabulating the scores
of forms that were arriving
throughout the latter part of
spring quarter 1966. During the
summer, the results from the
year of private discussions, and
from the three polls have been
compiled into the following re
port.
Program Purpose
The following explanation of
purpose was included in the
questionnaires.
"The present General Studies
Program, of which the senior
colloquia requirement is an in
tegral part, emerged from the
two-year intensive Study of Un
dergraduate Education, initiated
by President Sterling and con
ducted continuously from Au
gust 1954 to September 1956.
"The colloquia requirement
(2 two-unit colloquia in the se
nior year) grew out of a serious
questioning of the lecture sys
tem as a pedagogical device. It
was hoped that the colloquia
would provide a small group dis
cussion situation for a wider
range of Stanford students than
is possible in departmental semi

nars or the various honors pro
grams. By placing the require
ment in the senior year, It is
hoped that two things will be
accomplished: 1) general educa
tion will be carried into the
senior year which forces the
senior beyond the narrow bonds
of his major and acts as a
counter-part of that part of the
General Studies Program which
permits early specialization; and
2) the colloquia will take advan
tage of the students improved
knowledge and maturity of
judgment.
By closing the colloquia to
majors in the field of the of
fering, it is hoped that a kind of
cross-fertilization process will
take place, in which 6tudents
from a variety of disciplines will
gather together to shed light on
a common problem from their
various points of view. Finally,
it is hoped that the colloquia will
provide an educational exper
ience somewhat different from
the research seminar, by placing
greater emphasis on discussion
and on-the-spot interpretation,
analysis and testing of ideas,
and by replacing the research
paper with the less formal per
sonal, or 'creative' essay."
There is little doubt that many
of the expressed aims of the pro
gram have become a reality for
many Stanford undergraduates.
In recent years, however, chang
es have occured that have

greatly weakened the program.
There has been an evolution
from two directions. First, there

known that this is the chief rea
son for the recent change in the
colloquia requirement of from
two to one.
The departments, which must
compete almost viciously for
funds, are understandably reti
cent to "donate" faculty time
and expense for general studies
purposes. The difficulty, per
haps, lies with the need for
financial and academic leader
ship and coordination. This con
dition is underlined by the fact
that fifty per cent of the collo
quia professors spring quarter
of 1966 are under duress, or
unable altogether to teach fur
ther in the program due to the
"present compensation system."
These problems, of course, are
beyond student solution, and
must be worked out with, or by,
administration and faculty
groups. It might be suggested,
however, that if the proposed
changes that follow are adopted,

it could be worthwhile to change
the name of the program and
apply for foundation aid of some
sort.
Changing Needs
The poll results have reflected,
quite apart from the administra
tive difficulties extant, a pro
nounced dissatisfaction with the
very nature of the format itself.
In the student survey, 61.2 per
cent of those students polled ob
tained their first choice. How
ever, only 50 per cent would
have taken the subject if not
required, and only 54.3 per cent
viewed the course, in retrospect,
as worthwhile. Even more sig
nificant, 62.2 per cent do not be
lieve that their colloquia ful
filled the expressed purpose of
the program.
Obviously, the problem ex
tends beyond "getting the right
course." The nature of the col
loquia offerings themselves, par
ticularly their rigidity in
breadth, is of great concern.
Even those who do obtain their
best possible colloquia find the
class uninteresting or unimpor
tant. Most of the 62 per cent who
see the colloquias fail in their
intended purpose stress the lack
of the "introduction of impor
tant material outside (the) ma
jor." Sixty per cent of those
polled offered, on their own vo
lition, suggestions to render
course offerings more flexible.
Most popular were ideas to
widen the choice possibilities
and investigate students initia
tive plans.
In order to most effectively
achieve an "alternative to the
lecture system . . . with small
group discussion," and to truly
"take advantage of the student's
improved knowledge and matu
rity of judgment," it is suggest
ed that the student be permitted
to choose his own course and
method of study. For this Com
mittee shares the view that after
several years of exposure to the
flow of ideas within the Univer
sity, almost every student has
developed a number of particu
lar interests tangent to, or a
part from, his obligatory course
work. Yet in most of these in
stances a student has neither
the time nor the resources to ex
plore any of these areas. Furth
er, this Committee shares the
belief that at this point students
indeed do possess the "maturity
of judgment" to rewardingly ex
plore these areas without re
course to the inflexibility of syl
labi, required papers or tests.
There can be little doubt in
such a system that if a student
fails to satisfy his course expec
tations he has only himself to
blame.
It is expected that the atmo
sphere will be even more con
ducive to the "on-the-spot analy
sis and interpretation" that is
part of the program's goal. As
each student presents his dis
coveries, others will subject his
findings and methods to criti
cism for the facilitation of fur
ther discovery.
The establishment of a pro
gram allowing maximum free
dom and spontaneity is this
Committee's hope. To this end,
the Committee recommends the
implementation of six major re
visions in the present program.
Student Initiative
1. Over the past several years,
Dean's Walker and Wert have
authorized seminars designated
under the category '.Undergrad
uate Special." Often these cour
ses are the result of student
initiated proposals for addends
to the curriculum. They are
quite limited in size and infor
mal in nature. Usually, the
group of students originally re
questing the course make up
most of the class. The success
of these courses is unmistakable.
Although they include subject

matter ranging from education
to nuclear disarmament, there
are few complaints of not hav
ing received, in depth, important
knowledge that serves to diver
sify and broaden. The applica
tion of such a program is strong
ly recommended. The plan
would work thusly:
One quarter in advance all
professors who are willing and
able to lead a course would sub
mit their names and preferred
subject area.
Students, who will be inform
ed of their opportunity, will
sign up under desired profes
sors, or may approach them
with proposed specific topics. A
minimum of five students re
questing a similar topic will
authorize its inclusion. Any va
cancies would be left for filling
by the general student body
once the courses formed are
listed in the Time Schedule.
They would then be subject to
the same registration procedures
as any other course until the
allowed maximum size is at
tained. This would be on the
normal first come first serve
basis.
It is hoped that students will
be allowed to invite two, or pos
sibly even three professors to
lead the group sequentially or
simultaneously. This allows even
greater flexibilit in format,
often increases the spontaneity,
and most important, creates a
dialectism of expertise which
further stimulates class meet
ings.
It is suggested that the class
format consist of highly indivi
dualized investigations of the
subject matter without paper,
test or reading requirements.
Suggested reading would be en
couraged. The examination of
various findings, in the form of
oral and written reports (if de
sired) and following discussion
is the intended procedure.
The demand for a curriculum
input from the student body is
undeniable, particularly from
the student view. Surprising,
however, is the astonishing sup
port given to the concept by the
faculty.
In the poll of the spring 1966
colloquia professors approved
the idea by an 84.2 per cent seg
ment.
In the larger general faculty
poll, the four point plan de
scribed above was endorsed by
92.4 per cent of those who an
swered the question.
Further, 82.9 per cent expres
sed a willingness to teach under
such an arrangement.
Finally, 36 offered their names
and times of availability for
1967. There can be no more
ample testimony to the enthu
siasm felt by the faculty at the
the prospect of leading a group
of students with a guaranteed
interest in the subject matter of
the course.
Optional
2. The second revision re
commended is the abolishment
of the required aspect. A purely
optional program insures only
the inclusion of those positively
interested in the course plan.
Such a provision, rather than
weakening the program's pur
poses, would strengthen them.
For the notion of "forcing" a
student to broaden himself con
flicts at heart with the nature
of the proposed program. One
can not impel a student to gen
erate a curiosity, or to make an
effort to satisfy it. For the en
deavor to be truly successful,
specifically, for it to engender
not only broader informational
bases, but broader interests and
a new enthusiasm for acade
mics, it is necessary to attract
and tempt, not push and cram.
The purpose of the program,
thus, is to light fires by making
itself so alive with ideas and

spontaneity that those with
even the least shred of curiosity
for anything outside their voca
tional shell, will be attracted tp
it.
Passâ€”Fail
3. This Committee feels that
a pass-fail system is justified
for many of the same reasons
that call for an optional pro
gram. True scholarship requires
no reward, it is its own. Furth
er, the manner of research,
separate and spontaneous, is not
conductive to precise grading.
And when there is grading on
the basis of discussion, students
tend to hide behind masks in
superficial performances for
sake of "one-upmanship." Time
is spent on petty issues, and the
free flow of ideas and clash tif
values are impeded.
Finally, after several years 9f
grades, the Committee feels that
many students rely on the de
vice for motivation. These stu
dents miss entirely one of the
primary assets of a University
education. It is hoped that by
offering several gradeles'g
courses in the latter part of the
undergraduate years, it will be
possible to create or revitalize
more genuine incentives.
Graduates Also
4. Thfe Committee recorp
mends the inclusion of all will
ing juniors into the program.
This would broaden the base for
course enrollment. Further, it is
felt that after two years many
students have the capability to
benefit from the program.
Finally, it would make indi
vidual schedules more flexible.
The senior year requirement
was originally conceived to get
seniors out of their major
courses. But this plus other de
mands of senior year have result
ed in many junior years filled en
tirely with courses in the major
field. Thus, the increased flexi
bility would create the oppor
tunity for a more balanced and
diversified schedule over the fi
nal two years of undergraduate
education.
It is the further suggestion
of this committee that graduate
students be included in the pro
gram despite the lack of definite
survey affirmation. It would be
necessary, however, to limit
their numbers to no more than
three per class. Their presence
in this restricted way can serve
as a source of experience for
more stimulating discussions.
Limitation
5. It is the recommendation
of this Committee that a maxi
mum limitation of ten students
be placed on each class. Such
a condition will enhance the in
timacy of the sessions, and en
able the participants to achieve
a greater depth in the examin
ation of reports and findings.
6. It is the final recommenda
tion of this Committee that for
purposes of schedule flexibility,
a student be allowed to take
from one to three units worth
of individual research. The de
termination for unit allowance
can be made between students
and the individual professors
leading their respective courses*
Variable Load
It is the further recommenda
tion of this Committee that
there be a limitation of thirty
units per student in the revised
program.
It is this Committee's hope
that the implementation of
these six revisions will become
a reality. It is hoped that the
Stanford student will have the
chance to mold a portion of his
education around his own evolv
ing curiosities. It is hoped that
he will develop a growing and
lasting thirst for academic dis
covery to take into his future
vocation and life.
Bob Fellmeth, Chairman
(Editor's note. The following Is
an excerpted text of the Joint
Report of the Senior Colloquia
Committee of the ASSU Educa
tion Committee and The Senior
Class for Curriculum Reform.)
During the 1965 â€¢ 1966 year,
the student legislature appoint
ed an Education Commission to
conduct an inquiry into educa
tion at Stanford with hopes for
student initiated reform. As part
of this endeavor, the Commis
sion assumed responsibility for
the evaluation of the senior col
loquia plan.
The need for a thorough study
of this particular part of the
general studies scheme was the
result of an evident disintegra
tion of the present program.
The sources of dissatisfaction
and the precise causes thereof
were not as clear.
There ensued a series of per
sonal and confidential inter
views with numerous student
and faculty leaders, most of
whom had some interest in the
colloquia program. Subsequent
ly, three separate and extensive
questionnaires were formulated.

These included: 1) a sample poll
of the student body, 2) a poll of
all professors conducting senior
colloquias at that time (Spring
of 1966), 3) a large poll of the
general faculty, including twen
ty-two departments.
The new committees continued
the work, tabulating the scores
of forms that were arriving
throughout the latter part of
spring quarter 1966. During the
summer, the results from the
year of private discussions, and
from the three polls have been
compiled into the following re
port.
Program Purpose
The following explanation of
purpose was included in the
questionnaires.
"The present General Studies
Program, of which the senior
colloquia requirement is an in
tegral part, emerged from the
two-year intensive Study of Un
dergraduate Education, initiated
by President Sterling and con
ducted continuously from Au
gust 1954 to September 1956.
"The colloquia requirement
(2 two-unit colloquia in the se
nior year) grew out of a serious
questioning of the lecture sys
tem as a pedagogical device. It
was hoped that the colloquia
would provide a small group dis
cussion situation for a wider
range of Stanford students than
is possible in departmental semi

nars or the various honors pro
grams. By placing the require
ment in the senior year, It is
hoped that two things will be
accomplished: 1) general educa
tion will be carried into the
senior year which forces the
senior beyond the narrow bonds
of his major and acts as a
counter-part of that part of the
General Studies Program which
permits early specialization; and
2) the colloquia will take advan
tage of the students improved
knowledge and maturity of
judgment.
By closing the colloquia to
majors in the field of the of
fering, it is hoped that a kind of
cross-fertilization process will
take place, in which 6tudents
from a variety of disciplines will
gather together to shed light on
a common problem from their
various points of view. Finally,
it is hoped that the colloquia will
provide an educational exper
ience somewhat different from
the research seminar, by placing
greater emphasis on discussion
and on-the-spot interpretation,
analysis and testing of ideas,
and by replacing the research
paper with the less formal per
sonal, or 'creative' essay."
There is little doubt that many
of the expressed aims of the pro
gram have become a reality for
many Stanford undergraduates.
In recent years, however, chang
es have occured that have

greatly weakened the program.
There has been an evolution
from two directions. First, there
have been changes in the pro
gram per se over the past de
cade. Second, there have been
several changes in the educa
tional attitudes and expectations
that deem major adjustments
advisable for the more effective
accomplishment of the original
goals.
Decline Of Program
Originally, the senior col
loquia program was financed by
a Carnegie Corporation grant.
This backing, however, has dis
sipated and over the past sev
eral years the financial responsi
bility has shifted through the
Committee on General Studies
to the various departments. Fur
ther, the lack of funds at the de
partmental level earmarked for
specific colloquia uses has re
sulted in a flurry of "buckpas
sing" among departments, and
thus a decline in the number of
course offerings. It is generally
known that this is the chief rea
son for the recent change in the
colloquia requirement of from
two to one.
The departments, which must
compete almost viciously for
funds, are understandably reti
cent to "donate" faculty time
and expense for general studies
purposes. The difficulty, per
haps, lies with the need for
financial and academic leader
ship and coordination. This con
dition is underlined by the fact
that fifty per cent of the collo
quia professors spring quarter

the name of the program and
apply for foundation aid of some
sort.
Changing Needs
The poll results have reflected,
quite apart from the administra
tive difficulties extant, a pro
nounced dissatisfaction with the
very nature of the format itself.
In the student survey, 61.2 per
cent of those students polled ob
tained their first choice. How
ever, only 50 per cent would
have taken the subject if not
required, and only 54.3 per cent
viewed the course, in retrospect,
as worthwhile. Even more sig
nificant, 62.2 per cent do not be
lieve that their colloquia ful
filled the expressed purpose of
the program.
Obviously, the problem ex
tends beyond "getting the right
course." The nature of the col
loquia offerings themselves, par
ticularly their rigidity in
breadth, is of great concern.
Even those who do obtain their
best possible colloquia find the
class uninteresting or unimpor
tant. Most of the 62 per cent who
see the colloquias fail in their
intended purpose stress the lack
of the "introduction of impor
tant material outside (the) ma
jor." Sixty per cent of those
polled offered, on their own vo
lition, suggestions to render
course offerings more flexible.
Most popular were ideas to
widen the choice possibilities
and investigate students initia
tive plans.
In order to most effectively
achieve an "alternative to the
lecture system . . . with small
group discussion," and to truly
"take advantage of the student's
improved knowledge and matu
rity of judgment," it is suggest
ed that the student be permitted
to choose his own course and
method of study. For this Com
mittee shares the view that after
several years of exposure to the
flow of ideas within the Univer
sity, almost every student has
developed a number of particu
lar interests tangent to, or a
part from, his obligatory course
work. Yet in most of these in
stances a student has neither
the time nor the resources to ex
plore any of these areas. Furth
er, this Committee shares the
belief that at this point students
indeed do possess the "maturity
of judgment" to rewardingly ex
plore these areas without re
course to the inflexibility of syl
labi, required papers or tests.
There can be little doubt in
such a system that if a student
fails to satisfy his course expec
tations he has only himself to
blame.
It is expected that the atmo
sphere will be even more con
ducive to the "on-the-spot analy
sis and interpretation" that is
part of the program's goal. As
each student presents his dis
coveries, others will subject his
findings and methods to criti
cism for the facilitation of fur
ther discovery.
The establishment of a pro
gram allowing maximum free
dom and spontaneity is this
Committee's hope. To this end,
the Committee recommends the
implementation of six major re
visions in the present program.
Student Initiative
1. Over the past several years,
Dean's Walker and Wert have
authorized seminars designated
under the category '.Undergrad
uate Special." Often these cour
ses are the result of student
initiated proposals for addends
to the curriculum. They are
quite limited in size and infor
mal in nature. Usually, the
group of students originally re
questing the course make up
most of the class. The success
of these courses is unmistakable.
Although they include subject

matter ranging from education
to nuclear disarmament, there
are few complaints of not hav
ing received, in depth, important
knowledge that serves to diver
sify and broaden. The applica
tion of such a program is strong
ly recommended. The plan
would work thusly:
One quarter in advance all
professors who are willing and
able to lead a course would sub
mit their names and preferred
subject area.
Students, who will be inform
ed of their opportunity, will
sign up under desired profes
sors, or may approach them
with proposed specific topics. A
minimum of five students re
questing a similar topic will
authorize its inclusion. Any va
cancies would be left for filling
by the general student body
once the courses formed are
listed in the Time Schedule.
They would then be subject to
the same registration procedures
as any other course until the
allowed maximum size is at
tained. This would be on the
normal first come first serve
basis.
It is hoped that students will
be allowed to invite two, or pos
sibly even three professors to
lead the group sequentially or
simultaneously. This allows even
greater flexibilit in format,
often increases the spontaneity,
and most important, creates a
dialectism of expertise which
further stimulates class meet
ings.
It is suggested that the class
format consist of highly indivi
dualized investigations of the
subject matter without paper,
test or reading requirements.
Suggested reading would be en
couraged. The examination of
various findings, in the form of
oral and written reports (if de
sired) and following discussion
is the intended procedure.
The demand for a curriculum
input from the student body is
undeniable, particularly from
the student view. Surprising,
however, is the astonishing sup
port given to the concept by the
faculty.
In the poll of the spring 1966
colloquia professors approved
the idea by an 84.2 per cent seg
ment.
In the larger general faculty
poll, the four point plan de
scribed above was endorsed by
92.4 per cent of those who an
swered the question.
Further, 82.9 per cent expres
sed a willingness to teach under
such an arrangement.
Finally, 36 offered their names
and times of availability for
1967. There can be no more
ample testimony to the enthu
siasm felt by the faculty at the
the prospect of leading a group
of students with a guaranteed
interest in the subject matter of
the course.
Optional
2. The second revision re
commended is the abolishment
of the required aspect. A purely
optional program insures only
the inclusion of those positively
interested in the course plan.
Such a provision, rather than
weakening the program's pur
poses, would strengthen them.
For the notion of "forcing" a
student to broaden himself con
flicts at heart with the nature
of the proposed program. One
can not impel a student to gen
erate a curiosity, or to make an
effort to satisfy it. For the en
deavor to be truly successful,
specifically, for it to engender
not only broader informational
bases, but broader interests and
a new enthusiasm for acade
mics, it is necessary to attract
and tempt, not push and cram.
The purpose of the program,
thus, is to light fires by making
itself so alive with ideas and

spontaneity that those with
even the least shred of curiosity
for anything outside their voca
tional shell, will be attracted tp
it.
Passâ€”Fail
3. This Committee feels that
a pass-fail system is justified
for many of the same reasons
that call for an optional pro
gram. True scholarship requires
no reward, it is its own. Furth
er, the manner of research,
separate and spontaneous, is not
conductive to precise grading.
And when there is grading on
the basis of discussion, students
tend to hide behind masks in
superficial performances for
sake of "one-upmanship." Time
is spent on petty issues, and the
free flow of ideas and clash tif
values are impeded.
Finally, after several years 9f
grades, the Committee feels that
many students rely on the de
vice for motivation. These stu
dents miss entirely one of the
primary assets of a University
education. It is hoped that by
offering several gradeles'g
courses in the latter part of the
undergraduate years, it will be
possible to create or revitalize
more genuine incentives.
Graduates Also
4. Thfe Committee recorp
mends the inclusion of all will
ing juniors into the program.
This would broaden the base for
course enrollment. Further, it is
felt that after two years many
students have the capability to
benefit from the program.
Finally, it would make indi
vidual schedules more flexible.
The senior year requirement
was originally conceived to get
seniors out of their major
courses. But this plus other de
mands of senior year have result
ed in many junior years filled en
tirely with courses in the major
field. Thus, the increased flexi
bility would create the oppor
tunity for a more balanced and
diversified schedule over the fi
nal two years of undergraduate
education.
It is the further suggestion
of this committee that graduate
students be included in the pro
gram despite the lack of definite
survey affirmation. It would be
necessary, however, to limit
their numbers to no more than
three per class. Their presence
in this restricted way can serve
as a source of experience for
more stimulating discussions.
Limitation
5. It is the recommendation
of this Committee that a maxi
mum limitation of ten students
be placed on each class. Such
a condition will enhance the in
timacy of the sessions, and en
able the participants to achieve
a greater depth in the examin
ation of reports and findings.
6. It is the final recommenda
tion of this Committee that for
purposes of schedule flexibility,
a student be allowed to take
from one to three units worth
of individual research. The de
termination for unit allowance
can be made between students
and the individual professors
leading their respective courses*
Variable Load
It is the further recommenda
tion of this Committee that
there be a limitation of thirty
units per student in the revised
program.
It is this Committee's hope
that the implementation of
these six revisions will become
a reality. It is hoped that the
Stanford student will have the
chance to mold a portion of his
education around his own evolv
ing curiosities. It is hoped that
he will develop a growing and
lasting thirst for academic dis
covery to take into his future
vocation and life.
Bob Fellmeth, Chairman
(Editor's note. The following Is
an excerpted text of the Joint
Report of the Senior Colloquia
Committee of the ASSU Educa
tion Committee and The Senior
Class for Curriculum Reform.)
During the 1965 â€¢ 1966 year,
the student legislature appoint
ed an Education Commission to
conduct an inquiry into educa
tion at Stanford with hopes for
student initiated reform. As part
of this endeavor, the Commis
sion assumed responsibility for
the evaluation of the senior col
loquia plan.
The need for a thorough study
of this particular part of the
general studies scheme was the
result of an evident disintegra
tion of the present program.
The sources of dissatisfaction
and the precise causes thereof
were not as clear.
There ensued a series of per
sonal and confidential inter
views with numerous student
and faculty leaders, most of
whom had some interest in the
colloquia program. Subsequent
ly, three separate and extensive
questionnaires were formulated.

These included: 1) a sample poll
of the student body, 2) a poll of
all professors conducting senior
colloquias at that time (Spring
of 1966), 3) a large poll of the
general faculty, including twen
ty-two departments.
The new committees continued
the work, tabulating the scores
of forms that were arriving
throughout the latter part of
spring quarter 1966. During the
summer, the results from the
year of private discussions, and
from the three polls have been
compiled into the following re
port.
Program Purpose
The following explanation of
purpose was included in the
questionnaires.
"The present General Studies
Program, of which the senior
colloquia requirement is an in
tegral part, emerged from the
two-year intensive Study of Un
dergraduate Education, initiated
by President Sterling and con
ducted continuously from Au
gust 1954 to September 1956.
"The colloquia requirement
(2 two-unit colloquia in the se
nior year) grew out of a serious
questioning of the lecture sys
tem as a pedagogical device. It
was hoped that the colloquia
would provide a small group dis
cussion situation for a wider
range of Stanford students than
is possible in departmental semi

nars or the various honors pro
grams. By placing the require
ment in the senior year, It is
hoped that two things will be
accomplished: 1) general educa
tion will be carried into the
senior year which forces the
senior beyond the narrow bonds
of his major and acts as a
counter-part of that part of the
General Studies Program which
permits early specialization; and
2) the colloquia will take advan
tage of the students improved
knowledge and maturity of
judgment.
By closing the colloquia to
majors in the field of the of
fering, it is hoped that a kind of
cross-fertilization process will
take place, in which 6tudents
from a variety of disciplines will
gather together to shed light on
a common problem from their
various points of view. Finally,
it is hoped that the colloquia will
provide an educational exper
ience somewhat different from
the research seminar, by placing
greater emphasis on discussion
and on-the-spot interpretation,
analysis and testing of ideas,
and by replacing the research
paper with the less formal per
sonal, or 'creative' essay."
There is little doubt that many
of the expressed aims of the pro
gram have become a reality for
many Stanford undergraduates.
In recent years, however, chang
es have occured that have

greatly weakened the program.
There has been an evolution
from two directions. First, there
have been changes in the pro
gram per se over the past de
cade. Second, there have been
several changes in the educa
tional attitudes and expectations
that deem major adjustments
advisable for the more effective
accomplishment of the original
goals.
Decline Of Program
Originally, the senior col
loquia program was financed by
a Carnegie Corporation grant.
This backing, however, has dis
sipated and over the past sev
eral years the financial responsi
bility has shifted through the
Committee on General Studies
to the various departments. Fur
ther, the lack of funds at the de
partmental level earmarked for
specific colloquia uses has re
sulted in a flurry of "buckpas
sing" among departments, and
thus a decline in the number of
course offerings. It is generally
known that this is the chief rea
son for the recent change in the
colloquia requirement of from
two to one.
The departments, which must
compete almost viciously for
funds, are understandably reti
cent to "donate" faculty time
and expense for general studies
purposes. The difficulty, per
haps, lies with the need for
financial and academic leader
ship and coordination. This con
dition is underlined by the fact
that fifty per cent of the collo
quia professors spring quarter
of 1966 are under duress, or
unable altogether to teach fur
ther in the program due to the
"present compensation system."
These problems, of course, are
beyond student solution, and
must be worked out with, or by,
administration and faculty
groups. It might be suggested,
however, that if the proposed
changes that follow are adopted,

it could be worthwhile to change
the name of the program and
apply for foundation aid of some
sort.

Even those who do obtain their
best possible colloquia find the
class uninteresting or unimpor
tant. Most of the 62 per cent who
see the colloquias fail in their
intended purpose stress the lack
of the "introduction of impor
tant material outside (the) ma
jor." Sixty per cent of those
polled offered, on their own vo
lition, suggestions to render
course offerings more flexible.
Most popular were ideas to
widen the choice possibilities
and investigate students initia
tive plans.
In order to most effectively
achieve an "alternative to the
lecture system . . . with small
group discussion," and to truly
"take advantage of the student's
improved knowledge and matu
rity of judgment," it is suggest
ed that the student be permitted
to choose his own course and
method of study. For this Com
mittee shares the view that after
several years of exposure to the
flow of ideas within the Univer
sity, almost every student has
developed a number of particu
lar interests tangent to, or a
part from, his obligatory course
work. Yet in most of these in
stances a student has neither
the time nor the resources to ex
plore any of these areas. Furth
er, this Committee shares the
belief that at this point students
indeed do possess the "maturity
of judgment" to rewardingly ex
plore these areas without re
course to the inflexibility of syl
labi, required papers or tests.
There can be little doubt in
such a system that if a student
fails to satisfy his course expec
tations he has only himself to
blame.
It is expected that the atmo
sphere will be even more con
ducive to the "on-the-spot analy
sis and interpretation" that is
part of the program's goal. As
each student presents his dis
coveries, others will subject his
findings and methods to criti
cism for the facilitation of fur
ther discovery.
The establishment of a pro
gram allowing maximum free
dom and spontaneity is this
Committee's hope. To this end,
the Committee recommends the
implementation of six major re
visions in the present program.
Student Initiative
1. Over the past several years,
Dean's Walker and Wert have
authorized seminars designated
under the category '.Undergrad
uate Special." Often these cour
ses are the result of student
initiated proposals for addends
to the curriculum. They are
quite limited in size and infor
mal in nature. Usually, the
group of students originally re
questing the course make up
most of the class. The success
of these courses is unmistakable.
Although they include subject

matter ranging from education
to nuclear disarmament, there
are few complaints of not hav
ing received, in depth, important
knowledge that serves to diver
sify and broaden. The applica
tion of such a program is strong
ly recommended. The plan
would work thusly:
One quarter in advance all
professors who are willing and
able to lead a course would sub
mit their names and preferred
subject area.
Students, who will be inform
ed of their opportunity, will
sign up under desired profes
sors, or may approach them
with proposed specific topics. A
minimum of five students re
questing a similar topic will
authorize its inclusion. Any va
cancies would be left for filling
by the general student body
once the courses formed are
listed in the Time Schedule.
They would then be subject to
the same registration procedures
as any other course until the
allowed maximum size is at
tained. This would be on the
normal first come first serve
basis.
It is hoped that students will
be allowed to invite two, or pos
sibly even three professors to
lead the group sequentially or
simultaneously. This allows even
greater flexibilit in format,
often increases the spontaneity,
and most important, creates a
dialectism of expertise which
further stimulates class meet
ings.
It is suggested that the class
format consist of highly indivi
dualized investigations of the
subject matter without paper,
test or reading requirements.
Suggested reading would be en
couraged. The examination of
various findings, in the form of
oral and written reports (if de
sired) and following discussion
is the intended procedure.
The demand for a curriculum
input from the student body is
undeniable, particularly from
the student view. Surprising,
however, is the astonishing sup
port given to the concept by the
faculty.
In the poll of the spring 1966
colloquia professors approved
the idea by an 84.2 per cent seg
ment.
In the larger general faculty
poll, the four point plan de
scribed above was endorsed by
92.4 per cent of those who an
swered the question.
Further, 82.9 per cent expres
sed a willingness to teach under
such an arrangement.
Finally, 36 offered their names
and times of availability for
1967. There can be no more
ample testimony to the enthu
siasm felt by the faculty at the
the prospect of leading a group
of students with a guaranteed
interest in the subject matter of
the course.
Optional
2. The second revision re
commended is the abolishment
of the required aspect. A purely
optional program insures only
the inclusion of those positively
interested in the course plan.
Such a provision, rather than
weakening the program's pur
poses, would strengthen them.
For the notion of "forcing" a
student to broaden himself con
flicts at heart with the nature
of the proposed program. One
can not impel a student to gen
erate a curiosity, or to make an
effort to satisfy it. For the en
deavor to be truly successful,
specifically, for it to engender
not only broader informational
bases, but broader interests and
a new enthusiasm for acade
mics, it is necessary to attract
and tempt, not push and cram.
The purpose of the program,
thus, is to light fires by making
itself so alive with ideas and

spontaneity that those with
even the least shred of curiosity
for anything outside their voca
tional shell, will be attracted tp
it.
Passâ€”Fail
3. This Committee feels that
a pass-fail system is justified
for many of the same reasons
that call for an optional pro
gram. True scholarship requires
no reward, it is its own. Furth
er, the manner of research,
separate and spontaneous, is not
conductive to precise grading.
And when there is grading on
the basis of discussion, students
tend to hide behind masks in
superficial performances for
sake of "one-upmanship." Time
is spent on petty issues, and the
free flow of ideas and clash tif
values are impeded.
Finally, after several years 9f
grades, the Committee feels that
many students rely on the de
vice for motivation. These stu
dents miss entirely one of the
primary assets of a University
education. It is hoped that by
offering several gradeles'g
courses in the latter part of the
undergraduate years, it will be
possible to create or revitalize
more genuine incentives.
Graduates Also
4. Thfe Committee recorp
mends the inclusion of all will
ing juniors into the program.
This would broaden the base for
course enrollment. Further, it is
felt that after two years many
students have the capability to
benefit from the program.
Finally, it would make indi
vidual schedules more flexible.
The senior year requirement
was originally conceived to get
seniors out of their major
courses. But this plus other de
mands of senior year have result
ed in many junior years filled en
tirely with courses in the major
field. Thus, the increased flexi
bility would create the oppor
tunity for a more balanced and
diversified schedule over the fi
nal two years of undergraduate
education.
It is the further suggestion
of this committee that graduate
students be included in the pro
gram despite the lack of definite
survey affirmation. It would be
necessary, however, to limit
their numbers to no more than
three per class. Their presence
in this restricted way can serve
as a source of experience for
more stimulating discussions.
Limitation
5. It is the recommendation
of this Committee that a maxi
mum limitation of ten students
be placed on each class. Such
a condition will enhance the in
timacy of the sessions, and en
able the participants to achieve
a greater depth in the examin
ation of reports and findings.
6. It is the final recommenda
tion of this Committee that for
purposes of schedule flexibility,
a student be allowed to take
from one to three units worth
of individual research. The de
termination for unit allowance
can be made between students
and the individual professors
leading their respective courses*
Variable Load
It is the further recommenda
tion of this Committee that
there be a limitation of thirty
units per student in the revised
program.
It is this Committee's hope
that the implementation of
these six revisions will become
a reality. It is hoped that the
Stanford student will have the
chance to mold a portion of his
education around his own evolv
ing curiosities. It is hoped that
he will develop a growing and
lasting thirst for academic dis
covery to take into his future
vocation and life.
Bob Fellmeth, Chairman
(Editor's note. The following Is
an excerpted text of the Joint
Report of the Senior Colloquia
Committee of the ASSU Educa
tion Committee and The Senior
Class for Curriculum Reform.)
During the 1965 â€¢ 1966 year,
the student legislature appoint
ed an Education Commission to
conduct an inquiry into educa
tion at Stanford with hopes for
student initiated reform. As part
of this endeavor, the Commis
sion assumed responsibility for
the evaluation of the senior col
loquia plan.
The need for a thorough study
of this particular part of the
general studies scheme was the
result of an evident disintegra
tion of the present program.
The sources of dissatisfaction
and the precise causes thereof
were not as clear.
There ensued a series of per
sonal and confidential inter
views with numerous student
and faculty leaders, most of
whom had some interest in the
colloquia program. Subsequent
ly, three separate and extensive
questionnaires were formulated.

These included: 1) a sample poll
of the student body, 2) a poll of
all professors conducting senior
colloquias at that time (Spring
of 1966), 3) a large poll of the
general faculty, including twen
ty-two departments.
The new committees continued
the work, tabulating the scores
of forms that were arriving
throughout the latter part of
spring quarter 1966. During the
summer, the results from the
year of private discussions, and
from the three polls have been
compiled into the following re
port.
Program Purpose
The following explanation of
purpose was included in the
questionnaires.
"The present General Studies
Program, of which the senior
colloquia requirement is an in
tegral part, emerged from the
two-year intensive Study of Un
dergraduate Education, initiated
by President Sterling and con
ducted continuously from Au
gust 1954 to September 1956.
"The colloquia requirement
(2 two-unit colloquia in the se
nior year) grew out of a serious
questioning of the lecture sys
tem as a pedagogical device. It
was hoped that the colloquia
would provide a small group dis
cussion situation for a wider
range of Stanford students than
is possible in departmental semi

nars or the various honors pro
grams. By placing the require
ment in the senior year, It is
hoped that two things will be
accomplished: 1) general educa
tion will be carried into the
senior year which forces the
senior beyond the narrow bonds
of his major and acts as a
counter-part of that part of the
General Studies Program which
permits early specialization; and
2) the colloquia will take advan
tage of the students improved
knowledge and maturity of
judgment.
By closing the colloquia to
majors in the field of the of
fering, it is hoped that a kind of
cross-fertilization process will
take place, in which 6tudents
from a variety of disciplines will
gather together to shed light on
a common problem from their
various points of view. Finally,
it is hoped that the colloquia will
provide an educational exper
ience somewhat different from
the research seminar, by placing
greater emphasis on discussion
and on-the-spot interpretation,
analysis and testing of ideas,
and by replacing the research
paper with the less formal per
sonal, or 'creative' essay."
There is little doubt that many
of the expressed aims of the pro
gram have become a reality for
many Stanford undergraduates.
In recent years, however, chang
es have occured that have

greatly weakened the program.
There has been an evolution
from two directions. First, there
have been changes in the pro
gram per se over the past de
cade. Second, there have been
several changes in the educa
tional attitudes and expectations
that deem major adjustments
advisable for the more effective
accomplishment of the original
goals.
Decline Of Program
Originally, the senior col
loquia program was financed by
a Carnegie Corporation grant.
This backing, however, has dis
sipated and over the past sev
eral years the financial responsi
bility has shifted through the
Committee on General Studies
to the various departments. Fur
ther, the lack of funds at the de
partmental level earmarked for
specific colloquia uses has re
sulted in a flurry of "buckpas
sing" among departments, and
thus a decline in the number of
course offerings. It is generally
known that this is the chief rea
son for the recent change in the
colloquia requirement of from
two to one.
The departments, which must
compete almost viciously for
funds, are understandably reti
cent to "donate" faculty time
and expense for general studies
purposes. The difficulty, per
haps, lies with the need for
financial and academic leader
ship and coordination. This con
dition is underlined by the fact
that fifty per cent of the collo
quia professors spring quarter
of 1966 are under duress, or
unable altogether to teach fur
ther in the program due to the
"present compensation system."
These problems, of course, are
beyond student solution, and
must be worked out with, or by,
administration and faculty
groups. It might be suggested,
however, that if the proposed
changes that follow are adopted,

it could be worthwhile to change
the name of the program and
apply for foundation aid of some
sort.
Changing Needs
The poll results have reflected,
quite apart from the administra
tive difficulties extant, a pro
nounced dissatisfaction with the
very nature of the format itself.
In the student survey, 61.2 per
cent of those students polled ob
tained their first choice. How
ever, only 50 per cent would
have taken the subject if not
required, and only 54.3 per cent
viewed the course, in retrospect,
as worthwhile. Even more sig
nificant, 62.2 per cent do not be
lieve that their colloquia ful
filled the expressed purpose of
the program.
Obviously, the problem ex
tends beyond "getting the right
course." The nature of the col
loquia offerings themselves, par
ticularly their rigidity in
breadth, is of great concern.
Even those who do obtain their
best possible colloquia find the
class uninteresting or unimpor
tant. Most of the 62 per cent who
see the colloquias fail in their
intended purpose stress the lack
of the "introduction of impor
tant material outside (the) ma
jor." Sixty per cent of those
polled offered, on their own vo
lition, suggestions to render
course offerings more flexible.
Most popular were ideas to
widen the choice possibilities
and investigate students initia
tive plans.
In order to most effectively
achieve an "alternative to the
lecture system . . . with small
group discussion," and to truly
"take advantage of the student's

rity of judgment," it is suggest
ed that the student be permitted
