## Hass Defends Position On Problems Of Capitalism 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
In response to the letters from
business students, I can only
say that none of them met my
argument. I regret that I did
not have anything more original
to,say, but the problems of capi
talism are not new. Neither
D o a n Arbuckle's public state
ment nor Robert Spanner's in
genious reversal of Prudhon
helps very much. If leadership
were the problem, Dean Ar
buckle's rather sanguine com
ments would have some validi
ty,', but the problem is what the
system as a system does to peo
ple.
feefore I came to graduate
school, I worked for two years
as'a financial analyst for one of
ths large California banks.
Among the men I came to know,
I think there were only two or
three who were not profoundly
cyfoical about their work. Since
th'gy are for the most part in
telligent and gifted people, their
situation seems to me tragic.
TJhey belong mostly to the gen
eration which fought the Second
Wprld War and their attitudes
wfere formed by that experience
and in some cases by depression
childhoods.
But the immediate cause of
their cynicism was, I think, the
nature of their work. None of
supposed that the end of
job or of their company
was anything but the maximiza
tion of profit. Their superiors
wtere either tough old bankers
who never entertained such on
tolpgical considerations or they
wfcre members of Dean Ar
buckle's leadership class, men
whose careers had robbed them
of any other interests and given
tHem, as a result, the moral ar
rogance to presume that their
success was a measure of the
common good.
"My experience is limited and,
fo~r every assertion I make, an
exception occurs to me, but
what I am saying is true to my
experience. People working in
business when they are working
and not when they are justify
ing themselves know that the
public interest is merely one
counters in the game of increas
ing profits. And so, at one time
or another, they are bound to
ask themselves: what's is for?
The answer is, plainly, it's for
the Board. Or it's for my fam
ily; a man has to earn a living.
One of my fellow-workers
taught himself Greek, and used
to fight his way through Xeno
phon's Anabasis on the com
mute train. Another had become
a kind of fanatical publicist for
the music of Benjamin Britten
in his spare time. Another
trained dogs; still another had
a voluminous knowledge of the
air battles of the Second World
War. My impression was that
they pursued these avocations
with something like despera
tion. The men who were not
cynical were those whose pas
sion for responsibility account
ing or realistic marketing re
-search or more efficient report
ing systems was so wholly intel
lectual that it needed no justi
fication. For the rest, their work
held out the kind of challenge
that a crossword puzzle does.
(The high incidence, as they
would say, of crossword puzzle
users among them is genuinely
revealing.) I don't speak of the
men who hungered for power or
of the public relations—adver
tising people, since I find them
contemptible as a class.
1 am not an historian, but no
instance occurs to me in Ameri
can history of American busi
ness yielding voluntarily to the
public interest when a conflict
of interest developed. Nor do I
hear that business school stu
dents are organizing to protest
the scandalous rate of return on
drugs or the emasculation of
'ruth in packaging and truth in
lending bills. I am left with the
impression that the nineteenth

century view of business, the
view of Dickens' Our Mutual
Friend and Trollope's The Way
We Live Now is substantially
correct. Although American
business produces goods and
services, it is dehumanizing to
the people who engage in it, be
cause its object is not to pro
duce the best kinds of goods
and services for men.

• Paranoia
Editor, The Dally:
I have read with some amuse
ment and some concern the
scathing denunciation of the
Business School in last Friday's
Daily and wonder just what
basis Mr. Haas has for heaping
such polemics upon this segment
of the University community. In
my opinion, he has demonstrat
ed clearly what Professor Hof
stadter described here Friday
as the paranoid aspect of Amer
ican liberalism —seeing the insti
tution of American business as
near-conspiratorial in its bigness,
as absolute in badness, and con
tinuous in blandness.
Because his vituperation and
his widely divergent value sys
tem preclude the possibility of a
point-by-point refutation of your
charges through this medium,
may I earnestly suggest that he
come to the Business School in
the near future to see for him
self what our place is all about.
I shall be happy to talk to him
and to have him meet some of
the members of the administra
tion and faculty.

• Pressure Free
Editor, The Daily:
One gathers from Tuesday's
Daily that the appearance on
campus of Dr. Kreisberg of the
State Department is an indica
tion of "the Administration's
intention to discuss the China
question free from the pres

sures of the 'teach-in' on the
campus or the congressional
hearing in Washington". It is
gratifying to hear that the Ad
ministration works in an at
mosphere so rarefied it need not
take account of outside pres
sures. No wonder the Admini
stration disregarded Senator
Senator Fulbright's request to
testify at open hearings on
Thailand, where we now have
five big air bases and more
troops than we had in Vietnam
in January 1965.
Dr. Kriesberk will probably
tell us that the U.S. wants
friendship with China; that
good relations can begin as soon
as we have shown the Chinese
we are stronger than the North
Vietnamese; that the trouble Is
the Communists want to settle
things by force and we don't. A
different authority on China,
Professor Franz Schurman of
Berkeley, said last summer that
our aim in Vietnam is to pro
voke China into a nuclear con
frontation; that the Administra
tion thinks China and Russia
are both really weak; that the
U.S. doesn't want a third nu
clear power in the world — one
is really enough. Perhaps Dr.
Kriesberg will tei! us, as the
Administration said of George
Kennan's testimony last winter,
that there is no basic difference
between his vision of the future
and Professor Schurman's.

• Rapid Reading
Editor, The Daily:
It is a pleasure to see the
Daily's precarious financial for
tunes benefit from the enormous
advertising budget of the Read
ing Dynamics Institute. I would
like to point out to our students,
however, that they are eligible
to enroll for a non-credit rapid
reading course at Stanford any
quarter except the summer for
a fee of $7.50.

This course is designed spe
cifically for Stanford students,
though it is taught by a former
student of the Reading Dynam
ics Institute who also conducts
courses for business executives
and professional men. It em
ploys the most advanced tech
niques and equipment yet devel
oped.
Courses for the present quar
ter are filled, but a sign-up list
for next quarter is available at
the Counseling and Testing Cen
ter, 272 Encina Hall West. The
lab fee is not refundable, but
any motivated student should be
able to increase his speed equal
ly in our course, at several local
reading schools, or at Reading
Dynamics Institute, whose claim
to uniqueness is grossly exag
gerated.

• Training Ground
Editor, The Daily:
Kenneth Berquist's Inspired
reply to my previous letter over
looks an elementary distinction
which may tend to obscure de
bate on the "Army issue." The
point In question is not whether
"any member of the Armed
Forces be allowed an advanced
exposure to an intellectual en
vironment" but whether a Uni
versity is to be substituted for
a military training center.
I have no objection and in
deed vigorously approve of in
dividual members of the mili
tary in applying for and being
accepted into on-going univer
sity programs. I strenuously ob
ject to the creation of courses

created exclusively for non
regularly enrolled military per
sonnel, for exclusive military
objectives and closed to other
members of the Stanford com
munity. The four hundred offi
cers who were brought in this
summer, in effect co-opted Uni
versity facilities for their ex
clusive purpose. This operation
is analogous to having the gym
and athletic facilities rented to
the Army for the purpose of
Basic training. Granted that the
money earned is quite useful,
this is not enough to justify
using the University as a train
ing ground. Kindly note that
this is not a service offered at
the request of current students
but a solicited contract with an
external source for its own
membership. Even if the exter
nal organization were the Red

Cross, rather than the Defense
Department, an objection could '
be made. > iwui
The particular ire against
Defense Department arises but
of a personal value system;
however, the practical effect
should not be ignored. It is dif-"
ficult enough to do "sensitive"
basic research in the social, e£o-'
nomic and political institution* •'
of other nations. This is espe
cially the case in the new stated-
Mr. Berquist may be aSsur^d 1 *
that the task of convincing"'#'
departmental head of a
nation that prospective research"
in his country is solely for the •
advancement of knowledge and
in his interest is not likely to ] be
helped by the knowledge thtU'
the home University will
training military units in simildY-'
topics. DENNIS SIMS
