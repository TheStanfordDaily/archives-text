# LASSU Studies High Tution Cost
## 
### BARBARA WARREN 
A resolution asking the Univers
ity to guarantee that every student's
tuition and room and board fees
would remain stable throughout his
career at Stanford will be presented
to LASSU tonight.
Stanford would be the first major
university to adopt the Guaranteed
Stable Costs Plan, although over a
dozen small colleges are presently
using it.
Example: St. Olafs
The basic aim cited in the resolu
tion is to "greatly ease the burden
of financial planning in an era of
ever-increasing educational costs."
The model plan, first adopted at St.
Calf's College in Minnesota, is run
on a voluntary basis. Under the plan,
the estimated average cost of the four
years is broken into a graduated
schedule of payments. For instance,
at St. Olafs the average was set in
1961 at $1700, the student paying
$1800 his first year, $1725 his sopho
more year, $1675 the next, and $1600
his senior year.
The university can adjust tuition
every year, if necessary, but the stu

dents already enrolled in the plan
would not be affected by the succes
sive increases.
Extensive Revisions
Craig Venator, a Junior off-campus
LASSU representative who is sponsor
ing the bill, acknowledged that the
initial model would require extensive
additions and revisions to fit Stanford.
The other schools have not had to
cope with graduate fees but Stan
ford's enrollment is almost half grad
uate students. Venator felt that "the
major pioneering work would have
to be done in this area."
The basic ideas for the plan at St.
Olaf's came out of a joint "brain
storming session" among the busi
ness, admissions, and public relations
offices. Immediate fears of insur
mountable bookkeeping and admin
istrative difficulties were expressed.
Other people, skeptics of the plan,
have questioned whether the risks
involved were greater than the bene
fits derived should the economy en
ter a period of sharp inflation. Re
ports after five years working under
the plan brought approval from ad
ministrators, parents, and students.

Serious Consideration
Robert Huff, director of Financial
Aids at Stanford, commented, "The
Guaranteed Stable Costs Plan merits
serious consideration by the Stanford
Community."
The resolution begins by expressing
concern about rising costs. Tuition
alone at Stanford has been raised
three times in the 60's to its present
level of $1575. Another increase is
scheduled for fall of '67 which would
bring the figure to $1770 for an aca
demic year. This year room and board
fees went up $40 per quarter.
Kenneth Cuthberson, vice-president
of finance, stated at the time of the
last change, "There is nothing un
usual about the increase, considering
recent history. No radical change in
our relative position is foreseen. Tui
tion increases will be considered every
two years." Stanford's tuition is set
by the Board of Trustees and is sub
ject to review every two years.
Facilitate Planning 1
Taking into account that most uni
versities use long range financial pro
jections, Venator expressed his opin
ion that this plan would facilitate

both the University's planning and
the students'.
The resolution before LASSU
would provide an expression of stu
dent opinion on the issue and outlines
two channels for furthering discus
sion on the Guaranteed Stable Costs
Plan in the community as a whole.
First, the resolution refers the issue
to the Committee of Fifteen and, sec
ondly, encourages the Vice President
of Finance to make a statement about
the plan's feasibility to the Stanford
Community.
Venator, who is from Portland, Ore
gon, has had experience with the
plan's introduction at Lewis and Clark
College. The plan, now in operation,
was a student Initiated project.

The basic ideas for the plan at St.
Olaf's came out of a joint "brain
storming session" among the busi
ness, admissions, and public relations
offices. Immediate fears of insur
mountable bookkeeping and admin
istrative difficulties were expressed.
Other people, skeptics of the plan,
have questioned whether the risks
involved were greater than the bene
fits derived should the economy en

ports after five years working under
the plan brought approval from ad
ministrators, parents, and students.

Serious Consideration
Robert Huff, director of Financial
Aids at Stanford, commented, "The
Guaranteed Stable Costs Plan merits
serious consideration by the Stanford
Community."
The resolution begins by expressing
concern about rising costs. Tuition
alone at Stanford has been raised
three times in the 60's to its present
level of $1575. Another increase is
scheduled for fall of '67 which would
bring the figure to $1770 for an aca
demic year. This year room and board
fees went up $40 per quarter.
Kenneth Cuthberson, vice-president
of finance, stated at the time of the
last change, "There is nothing un
usual about the increase, considering
recent history. No radical change in
our relative position is foreseen. Tui
tion increases will be considered every
two years." Stanford's tuition is set
by the Board of Trustees and is sub
ject to review every two years.

The resolution before LASSU

ondly, encourages the Vice President
of Finance to make a statement about
the plan's feasibility to the Stanford
Community.
Venator, who is from Portland, Ore

College. The plan, now in operation,

A resolution asking the Univers
ity to guarantee that every student's
tuition and room and board fees
would remain stable throughout his
career at Stanford will be presented
to LASSU tonight.
Stanford would be the first major
university to adopt the Guaranteed
Stable Costs Plan, although over a
dozen small colleges are presently
using it.
Example: St. Olafs
The basic aim cited in the resolu
tion is to "greatly ease the burden
of financial planning in an era of
ever-increasing educational costs."
The model plan, first adopted at St.
Calf's College in Minnesota, is run
on a voluntary basis. Under the plan,
the estimated average cost of the four
years is broken into a graduated
schedule of payments. For instance,
at St. Olafs the average was set in
1961 at $1700, the student paying
$1800 his first year, $1725 his sopho
more year, $1675 the next, and $1600
his senior year.
The university can adjust tuition
every year, if necessary, but the stu

dents already enrolled in the plan
would not be affected by the succes
sive increases.
