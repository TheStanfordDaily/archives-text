# Students And Reforms
## 
### 
Several events within the past two weeks
have shown that students are taking a primary
role in educational reform at Stanford. The
amalgamation of the ASSU and Dean's Office
study of freshman year housing has insured that
student insight will be combined with Adminis
tration efforts to provide a more unified sys
tem of frosh housing. Equally encouraging is
the presence of Student Body President David
Harris on the planning committee for the long
promised re-evaluation of Stanford education.
Yet one event this month has also underlined
the University's structural difficulties in consid
ering student proposed reforms. The ASSU
Education Commission and the Senior Class
jointly completed a study of the colloquia pro
gram. which has come under increasing criticism
in recent years, and suggested changes. The
Joint Committee Report released yesterday was
sent to the Committee on General Studies as
well as the Committee on Undergraduate Edu
cation. And there is some speculation that the
nature of the Joint Committee's proposals may
require consideration by the Registrar's Com
mittee. The genuinely exciting and well docu
mented report outlines proposals for increased
student initiative which goes far beyond the
present program.
However the present confusion between the
role of the General Studies Committee and that
of the Committee on Undergraduate Education
complicates sensible consideration of the Joint
Committee's proposals.
Experience at other institutions has shown
that students have the greatest contribution to
make to curricular reform acting independently

on the university structure. Although student
administration cooperation on committees pro
vides one form of "input" for student ideas,
the University has not faced the problem of
how to consider independent, student initiated
proposals.
There is no single committee which is em
powered to consider student recommendations
and bring them to fruition. Hopefully President
Sterling's planning committee will take up the
problem. But even beyond the President's study
there is a need for a formal committee which
is able to cut through the red tape inherent in
any large organization.
The importance of the Joint Committee's Re
port on Senior Colloquia is secondary in com
parison with the two major studies being con
ducted by the Associated Students in housing
and education. If these upcoming reports are
to languish in the netherworld of conflicting
committee jurisdictions as seems the fate of
the Joint Committee Report, the impetus of
student concern will have been poorly used by
the University.
The time has come for the University to
clarify and redefine committee lines so that
education might be considered as a whole rather
than as particular fragments, such as grading,
housing, or graduation requirements. We
strongly urge that President Sterling consider
the establishment of a Committee on Innovation
which would be able to cut across existing com
mittee lines. With such a committee the Uni
versity would be able to judge, with meaning
and reasonable efficiency, the merits of student
initiated reforms.
