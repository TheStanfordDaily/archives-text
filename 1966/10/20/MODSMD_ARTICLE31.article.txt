## LASSU Rep Analyzes Handke Issue 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
That the Committee of Fifteen
appointments are a "test of con
fidence" for Dave Harris is a
valid, but limited and abstract
overview of the situation. It
should not be forgotten that ap
proval of Harris' nominations
was, after all, a concrete act of
approval (or disapproval) de
manding a value judgment from
each LASSU member as to the
nominees' ability to articulate
ideas and to courageously ev
press opinions. These criteria
were established by Harris in his
speech to the legislature.
1 would claim that on the
basis of ability (in this case, lack
of Jan Handke's nomi
nation was rejected . . . not on
the issue of "Dave Harris versus
LASSU" or "The New Left ver
sus the Stanford Student Body."
We heard Miss Handke speak,
asked probing questions as to
the functions and importance of
Committee of Fifteen, and I, for
one, was not satisfied with the
half-thought-out abstractions she
offered as answers. If Miss
Handke has difficulty expressing
her ideas to LASSU (no matter
how valuable those ideas may
be), how will she be able to do
so on the Committee of Fifteen?
This, it seems to me, is the
view to take of Jan Handke's
disapproval. The failure of Dave
Harris to see beyond his per
sonal honor or the concept of a
"test of confidence" points out a

fundamental problem: the gulf
between LASSU and Harris, as
created by animosity on both
sides. If LASSU indeed has the
power to approve or disapprove
nominees, it must be allowed to
exercise this power, not as an
anti-Harris faction, but as the
body of student representatives
which it is.
Disregarding LASSU opinion
is disregarding the diversity of
student opinion as well. Refus
ing to narrow that gulf of nega
tivism and consequently retain
ing the staid image of "LASSU
is a farce" is to ignore a basic
flaw in the function of student
government at Stanford. This is
sue should be solved before the
gulf becomes too wide and too
deep to overcome.

Editor, The Daily:
Four years ago, the members
of Beta Chi voted to disafiliate
from the national Sigma Nu
the ostensible reason being dis
agreement with the national's
policy of racial discrimination
in member selection. The vote
was on principle and not con
cerned with the admittance of
a particular individual. I sug
gest that the general reason for
their disafiliation was greater
than the specific issue of racial
discrimination. In 1962, frater
nities with ritualistic ceremo

nies, superficial brotherhood,
and general stifling of the mem
bers' spontaneity and individual
ity in the guise of the 'house
good', seemed irrelevant if not
antiethetical to the students' be
liefs. I think that the word "re
levance" is the key to under
standing changes in Beta Chi's
institutional structure and the
members' attitudes.
In the fall of 1963, my fresh
man year, there was a sudden
awareness of and commitment to
the civil rights struggle in the
South. In the three years since,
awareness of social problems
has expanded here at Stanford
as well as among students all
over the country. And with this
awareness, has grown a strong
commitment to dealing with
these problems. Our world, in
other words, has expanded be
yond living groups and football
games to Mississippi and Viet
nam.
The critical analysis of so
ciety has in turn resulted in an
analysis of the university and
education. The question Mr. Har
ris has been asking—"What is
education?" — is logically fol
lowed by the questioning of the
relevance of the institutions in
which we participate.
This is the question being
asked of themselves by the mem
bers of Beta Chi. What is the
relevance of the fraternity to
their lives, to their education,
and to the university commu

nity? Though none of us have
clearly formulated answers to all
of these questions, there is a
feeling among the members of
the group that perhaps the insti
tution itself may be an obstacle
to the realization of its purposes.
And those purposes need to be
re-examined in consideration of
their relevance to the student
and university of 1966.
Students are no longer isolated
from the world. And they no
longer want to live in an isolated
world. Selective membership in a
closed sect isolates the individual
by allowing him to carefully sur
round himself with those he
chooses, for whatever reasons.
Furthermore, it gives him the
illusionary God-like position of
judging the "worth" of another
individual. Both aspects of selec
tion tend to isolate the individual
and the group from the rest of
the university community.
Beta Chi, however, should be
a means of fuller participation in
the university community. And
the word "means" is essential.
Often the perpetuation of an in
stitution becomes the "end" of
the the institution rather than •
the purpose for which it was
originally created. I hope that
by opening Beta Chi to the en
tire Stanford community on a
non-selective basis, the organiza
tion will become more relevant
to the student, to the university,
and to the educational experi
ence. BANNING GARRFTT

Four years ago, the members
of Beta Chi voted to disafiliate
from the national Sigma Nu
the ostensible reason being dis
agreement with the national's
policy of racial discrimination
in member selection. The vote
was on principle and not con
cerned with the admittance of
a particular individual. I sug
gest that the general reason for
their disafiliation was greater
than the specific issue of racial
discrimination. In 1962, frater
nities with ritualistic ceremo

nies, superficial brotherhood,
and general stifling of the mem
bers' spontaneity and individual
ity in the guise of the 'house
good', seemed irrelevant if not
antiethetical to the students' be
liefs. I think that the word "re
levance" is the key to under
standing changes in Beta Chi's
institutional structure and the
members' attitudes.
In the fall of 1963, my fresh
man year, there was a sudden
awareness of and commitment to
the civil rights struggle in the
South. In the three years since,
awareness of social problems
has expanded here at Stanford
as well as among students all
over the country. And with this
awareness, has grown a strong
commitment to dealing with
these problems. Our world, in
other words, has expanded be
yond living groups and football
games to Mississippi and Viet
nam.
The critical analysis of so
ciety has in turn resulted in an
analysis of the university and
education. The question Mr. Har
ris has been asking—"What is
education?" — is logically fol
lowed by the questioning of the
relevance of the institutions in
which we participate.
This is the question being
asked of themselves by the mem
bers of Beta Chi. What is the
relevance of the fraternity to
their lives, to their education,
and to the university commu

nity? Though none of us have
clearly formulated answers to all
of these questions, there is a
feeling among the members of
the group that perhaps the insti
tution itself may be an obstacle
to the realization of its purposes.
And those purposes need to be
re-examined in consideration of
their relevance to the student
and university of 1966.
Students are no longer isolated
from the world. And they no
longer want to live in an isolated
world. Selective membership in a
closed sect isolates the individual
by allowing him to carefully sur
round himself with those he
chooses, for whatever reasons.
Furthermore, it gives him the

and to the university commu

nity? Though none of us have
clearly formulated answers to all
of these questions, there is a
feeling among the members of
the group that perhaps the insti
tution itself may be an obstacle
to the realization of its purposes.
And those purposes need to be
re-examined in consideration of
their relevance to the student
and university of 1966.
Students are no longer isolated
from the world. And they no
longer want to live in an isolated
world. Selective membership in a
closed sect isolates the individual
by allowing him to carefully sur
round himself with those he
chooses, for whatever reasons.
Furthermore, it gives him the
illusionary God-like position of
judging the "worth" of another
individual. Both aspects of selec
tion tend to isolate the individual
and the group from the rest of
the university community.
Beta Chi, however, should be
a means of fuller participation in
the university community. And
the word "means" is essential.
Often the perpetuation of an in
stitution becomes the "end" of
the the institution rather than •
the purpose for which it was
originally created. I hope that
by opening Beta Chi to the en
tire Stanford community on a
non-selective basis, the organiza
tion will become more relevant
to the student, to the university,
and to the educational experi

That the Committee of Fifteen
appointments are a "test of con
fidence" for Dave Harris is a
valid, but limited and abstract
overview of the situation. It
should not be forgotten that ap
proval of Harris' nominations
was, after all, a concrete act of
approval (or disapproval) de
manding a value judgment from
each LASSU member as to the
nominees' ability to articulate
ideas and to courageously ev
press opinions. These criteria
were established by Harris in his
speech to the legislature.
1 would claim that on the
basis of ability (in this case, lack
of Jan Handke's nomi
nation was rejected . . . not on
the issue of "Dave Harris versus
LASSU" or "The New Left ver
sus the Stanford Student Body."
We heard Miss Handke speak,
asked probing questions as to
the functions and importance of
Committee of Fifteen, and I, for
one, was not satisfied with the
half-thought-out abstractions she
offered as answers. If Miss
Handke has difficulty expressing
her ideas to LASSU (no matter
how valuable those ideas may
be), how will she be able to do
so on the Committee of Fifteen?
This, it seems to me, is the
view to take of Jan Handke's
disapproval. The failure of Dave
Harris to see beyond his per
sonal honor or the concept of a
"test of confidence" points out a

fundamental problem: the gulf
between LASSU and Harris, as
created by animosity on both
sides. If LASSU indeed has the
power to approve or disapprove
nominees, it must be allowed to
exercise this power, not as an
anti-Harris faction, but as the
body of student representatives
which it is.
Disregarding LASSU opinion
is disregarding the diversity of
student opinion as well. Refus
ing to narrow that gulf of nega
tivism and consequently retain
ing the staid image of "LASSU
is a farce" is to ignore a basic
flaw in the function of student
government at Stanford. This is
sue should be solved before the
gulf becomes too wide and too
deep to overcome.

Four years ago, the members
of Beta Chi voted to disafiliate
from the national Sigma Nu
the ostensible reason being dis
agreement with the national's
policy of racial discrimination
in member selection. The vote
was on principle and not con
cerned with the admittance of
a particular individual. I sug
gest that the general reason for
their disafiliation was greater
than the specific issue of racial
discrimination. In 1962, frater
nities with ritualistic ceremo

nies, superficial brotherhood,
and general stifling of the mem
bers' spontaneity and individual
ity in the guise of the 'house
good', seemed irrelevant if not
antiethetical to the students' be
liefs. I think that the word "re
levance" is the key to under
standing changes in Beta Chi's
institutional structure and the
members' attitudes.
In the fall of 1963, my fresh
man year, there was a sudden
awareness of and commitment to
the civil rights struggle in the
South. In the three years since,
awareness of social problems
has expanded here at Stanford
as well as among students all
over the country. And with this
awareness, has grown a strong
commitment to dealing with
these problems. Our world, in
other words, has expanded be
yond living groups and football
games to Mississippi and Viet
nam.
The critical analysis of so
ciety has in turn resulted in an
analysis of the university and
education. The question Mr. Har
ris has been asking—"What is
education?" — is logically fol
lowed by the questioning of the
relevance of the institutions in
