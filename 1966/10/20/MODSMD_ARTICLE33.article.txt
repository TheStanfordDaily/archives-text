## Filling The House; Or We Need A Bigger 'S' 
### Mike Couzens 
Some public relations would
have saved all that fuss about
Hans Kung and Richard Hof
stader last week.
Dinkelspiel has 720 seats: we
will label this curve, "S". Six
teen hundred people showed up:
let this be represented by "D".
Economists reading The Daily
will have noticed already that
D is greater than S. One solu
tion is to find a bigger S. But
Mem Aud. is booked by the Rep
ertory Theater until funds are
raised for a performing arts
center, or until the millenium,
whichever comes first.
Another solution, which was
followed at the first lecture by
Kung, is to deny 900 people
seats. The most vociferous mem
bens of D (there were about 250
Wednesday night) could sit out
side on the lawn and join in the
applause vicariously.
Use Memorial Church
A final solution is Memorial

Church, ideal for people who are
blind and deaf but at least want
to say that they were there.
Since the Truth in Packaging
Bill failed, all of these solutions
are obsolete. It should be a
simple matter to manipulate the
D-curve.
For example, instead of say
ing that Hans Kung is an excit
ing theologian, he should have
been billed as a soloist at the
Sky Pilot's Radio Church in Los
Angeles. Notices should not
have been printed in Once
Around the Quad.
Brewster's Visit
The day of reckoning for this
method will be next May when
Kingman Brewster speaks in
Dinkelspiel.
News and Publications should
issue a release saying, "Con
trary to rumor, Kingman Brew
ster is not the President of Yale.
He is an oyster shucker in
downtown New Haven.
"He will aswer questions for
ten minutes about New England
fishing conditions, but wishes
to emphasize that he is not an
authority.
" 'I'm just plain folks,' he re
marked to a university spokes
man."
An extensive publicity cam
paign should be organized on
KZSU.
When John Barth speaks in
Dinkelspiel, all Western Civ in
structors should tell their
classes that English instructors
who allege his appearance to be
part of the Voice Project are
mistaken.
Posters should be placed in
the lobbies of all fraternities.
And News and Pub can tell
the story again: "John Barth
denies that any of his novels
ever reached the top of the best
seller list.
"He has published several
children's books through a well
known courtesy publishing
house in Menlo-Atherton, and
has written all the television
scripts for 'Green Acres', 'Petti
coat Junction', and 'As the
World Turns.'
Finally, the appearance of Er
win Canham, editor of the Chris
tian Science Monitor will not
strain Dinkelspiel if precautions
are taken.
Dittoed notices should be giv
en to all RA's. Sign-up lists
should be posted at the I-Center.
LASSU should pass a reso
lution urging everyone to attend.
And the editor of The aDily
should write a vigorous, if not
hysterical, editorial, imploring
community to see his journal
istic colleague.
And just to be sure, a com
mittee might be formed.
