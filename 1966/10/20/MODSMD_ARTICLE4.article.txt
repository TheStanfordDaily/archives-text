# Newsman To Discuss Viet War
## 
### 
Francois Sully, Newsweek's Chief
Asian correspondent, will speak in
Tresidder 275 at 8 p.m. today on "the
political nature of the Vietnam war."
A native of France, Sully has spent
some 20 years in Southeast Asia as
a soldier, tea planter, and a journalist.
He makes his home in Saigon, and
has been Newsweek's chief Vietnam
war correspondent since 1959. Sully
was also the first American journalist
to be admitted to mainland China in
recent years. He traveled 5,000 miles
in China just prior to the current
"Red Guard" uprising.
He has also covered the Buddhist
led revolt against the regime of South
Vietnam's Premier Nguyen Cao Ky,
and reported on the recent elections
for the constitutional assembly.
Facts Lacking
Sully strongly feels that rational
consideration of the facts of the war
has been sorely lacking, both on the
part of the war's critics and its sup
porters. He feels most media, includ
ing his own magazine, poorly repre
sent the facts.
A common image of the Vietnamese
population holds them to be largely
non-political. Sully says much of the
Vietnamese population, including the
peasants, is politically very sophisti
cated.
The 36 active political parties are
only one manifestation of this. More
significantly, the issues that allowed

the Viet Cong to start the war, and
the long resistance of the people in
the South to the V.C. can both be
traced to this strength of political
convictions, Sully claims.
No Early End
For this reason he sees no early
end to the war. The Vietnamese of all
factions are likely to fight it out to
the end to win for their cause. With
the present military strengths of both
sides, this implies a war lasting, he
feels, at least two years more.

He also believes the Chinese are
doing their best to prolong the con
flict. Already technical units are be
lieved to have entered North Vietnam
to free V.C. forces for combat. It is
likely that combat units will follow
to take up defensive rolls and allow
their Vietnamese counterparts to en
ter the active war in the South.
But, despite the preponderance of
emphasis properly placed on the mili
tary situation, Sully feels the war is,
and will remain, primarily a political
issue. The roots of the conflict extend
far back into Vietnamese political his
tory. He feels the war will be won
only when its political nature is fully
understood.
