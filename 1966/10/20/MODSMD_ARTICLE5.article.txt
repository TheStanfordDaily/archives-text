# Man's Relation To Nature Topic Of Eiseley's Lecture

### SUE HUDGENS 
Calling man's dreams outside of
nature and his imprisonment within
reality "one of the cruelest gifts" en
dowed to him, Anthropology Profes
sor Loren C. Eiseley discussed man's
relationship to nature before an over
flow crowd last night in Dinkelspiel.
Eiseley's speech, entitled "The Angry
Winter: Man and the Ice Age", was
the first in a series of lectures the
noted scholar and essayist is giving
this week through the annual Haas
Memorial Lecture program.
He will speak today at 4:15 in Dink
elspiel on "The Forfeit Paradise: Dar
win and Thoreau." The concluding
lecture will be delivered Sunday on
'The Inner Galaxy: A Prelude to

Space", at 3:30 p.m. in Cubberley
Auditorium.
Man, a product of a returning cycle
coming every 250 million years, Ls
a "genuine offspring of a world of
ice," Eiseley pointed out. While the
current ice age comprises only one
per cent of the earth's history, he
said, "men have become both planet
changers and dessicators of life."
"By the time of the Pleistocene
Age, 70 per cent of life had changed
or gone . . . The Pleistocene Age is
one of the crescendoes in the earth's
techtonic history. Mountains have
reached unequaled heights and oceans
have reached unequaled depths."
Pointing out that "life and its en
vironment are interdependent and
evolve together," Eiseley said that at

the inception of the current ice age,
man "was dependent on his dreams
and his own interpretation of nature."
The recipient of ten honorary doc
torates since 1938 asserted that it was
fire that separated man from animals.
"Man was walking upright two mil
lion years ago. He is now a giant
primate . . . but his end is not foresee
able. Fire has opened to man the
final conquest of the earth."
Yet Eiseley, professor of anthropol
ogy and the history of science at the
University of Pennsylvania, empha
sized the relative insignificance of man
compared to the whole of history.
"The human race has survived but a
bit of 30 million years of an ice age,"
he said.
"Children of the dream time," Eiseley
said, "man's insights depend entirely
on painfully accumulated knowledge."
Eiseley related his view of man's un
importance in the whole of history
to an experience he had once as a
youth. He was walking in the country
during a snow storm and came across
an old graveyard. The gravestones had
fallen over and crumbled through the
years.
As he stood alone over "the dead,"
Eiseley saw the eyes of another being
through the swirling snow, the tiny
eyes of a jack rabbit. Realizing his
aloneness and the inevitability of his
fate as a man, Eiseley said that "there
are so few tracks in all this snow."
"Man will always carry the Cruelty
and springtime in his hear\" Eiseley
concluded.
