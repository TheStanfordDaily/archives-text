# Students' Union Shop Foreseen
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Calif.
(CPS)â€”Dining room employees
at San Francisco State College
may become members of a un
ion shop this year, if predictions
of Tom Mazzolini, leader of the
Organization of Student Em
ployees (OSE) are accurate.
Last semester, the OSE went
on strike against the commons
dining room to protest present
$1.30 to $1.40 per hour wages
and to demand establishment of
a union shop.
Mazzolini said final approval
of the union shop would have
to come from a board governing
the commons, but he was confi
dent the board would grant the
OSE proposal. If the proposal
is passed, any student employee
in the commons or dining room
would have to become a mem
ber of OSE within 30 days.
Provided there are no difficul
ties over a union shop arrange
ment, Mazzolini will press for
an across-the-board pay hike to
$1.85. "This pay raise," Mazzo
lini said, "is desperately needed
to match the rising cost of liv
ing.
Mazzolini accused commons
manager Richard Mahoric of
raising food prices to turn stu
dent sympathy against OSE.
According to their financial
statement, however, the com
mons ran $2,000 in the red last
year.
Despite those losses, Mazzo
lini said, the other associated
college concerns are well in the
black. The bookstore, for exam
ple, makes a profit of over
$10,000. He asked that part of
the profit from the bookstore
be used to underwrite a pay
hike for student employees in
the commons.
