# Senior Class Plans Gift
## 
### 
The class of 1967 has an
nounced that as its gift to the
University it will provide schol
arship money to the Heritage
Fund.
The Heritage Fund was
founded in 1955 as a perpetuat
ing Senior Class gift to the Uni
versity. The Fund consists of
money donated for student schol
arships by Bay Area business
men.
These scholarships are award
ed to freshmen and sophomores
who, in addition to academic
achievement, have demonstrated
outstanding leadership qualities
and have pressing financial
needs. Past senior classes have
felt scholarships with this em
phasis to be significant both to
Stanford and to the business
community.
President's Letter
The campaign begins with a
personal letter from President
Sterling to each prospective do
nor, urging the business to give
a "hearing" to students who
will solicit for the program. A

brochure describing the program
is mailed shortly after the Presi
dent's letter.
Donors include local busi
nesses who gave in previous
years and those who provide es
sential services to the University
community.
Student teams are assigned to
prospective donors and they
make telephone appointments
early in winter quarter. The ac
tual solicitation takes place late
in winter quarter and early in
Spring quarter.
Goal: $25,000
Since the Fund's initiation,
over $167,000 worth of scholar
ships have been awarded to 115
outstanding students with the
amounts collected ranging as
high as $20,000 and consistently
exceeding $10,000. This year's
goal is $25,000.
Interviews for the Heritage
Fund are now being held and
sign-up times have been posted
at the Axe Com. desk in the
ASSU office in Tresidder Union.
