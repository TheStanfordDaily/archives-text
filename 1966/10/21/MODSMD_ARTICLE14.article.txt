Vietnamese cabinet members who resigned
were reported refusing to withdraw their resig

to be "willing not to make an issue" oi
their dispute with Premier Nguyen Cao Ky's
northern-dominated degime just before the
Manila Conference on Vietnam, but sources
said they insisted their resignations remain in
effect.
Unofficial reports circulated that Ky had pre
vailed on the other five ministers to withdraw
their resignations. But no informed source in

basic differences between his inner circle of
natives of North Vietnam and the dissenting
ministers.
• Power Grab In Brazil
RIO DE JANEIRO —President Humberto
Castello Branco took over complete control of
Brazil yesterday by ordering congress into
recess.
The action temporarily ended a congressional

threat to his extraordinary powers over Latin
America's largest nation and eliminated one
of Brazil's last showcases of democracy.
The recess is scheduled to last until No
vember 22, a week after nationwide elections to
renew the Chamber of Deputies and a third
on the Senate.
• L.B.J. Sees Viet Win
CANBERRA —President Johnson told Aus
tralians yesterday he sees success ahead in
Vietnam mainly because other countries too
are joining in a common effort to steam ag
gression.
"I believe there is light at the end of what
has been a long and lonely tunnel," Johnson
declared in a speech prepared for the Parlia
ment of this major ally in the Vietnam war.
Johnson's speech highlighted the opening of
a three-day visit after which the President goes
to Manila for the summit meeting of the seven
nations with forces fighting the Communists
in South Vietnam.
Counting South Vietnam's own army, the
allies have more than a million men under
arms in the Southeast Asian conflict. Aus
tralia provides some 4,500.

• Packaging Bill Passes
WASHINGTON —A bill intended to protect
shoppers against unfair or deceptive methods
of packaging and labeling consumer goods has
cleared Congress after five years of effort.
Congressional action was completed yester
day with Senate acceptance of what virtually
was the version the House insisted on rather
than the bill the Senate originally passed.
Sen. Warren G. Magnuson, chairman of the
Senate Commerce Committee, said he agreed
to the House version with great reluctance. But
he told the Senate the only alternative was to
have no bill at all.

In contrast, Son. Philip A. Hart said he re
garded the House bill as "actually stronger
than the Senate's." He was the author and
chief sponsor of the Senate bill
Five years ago Hart introduced what he
called a "Truth-in-Packaging" bill to deal with
consumer complaints about cents-off deals,
fractional weights and measures, slack fill, mis
leading illustrations, hard-tofind and hard-to
read statements of net contents, and odd
shapes and sizes of packages.
• Taxes For Campaign
WASHINGTON—A novel plan for taxpayers
to finance, in large part, future Presidential
election campaigns won House approval last
night, 171 to 46.
The measure goes to the Senate, which orig
inated it and has approved it at an earlier stage
in the legislative procedure.
If the plan goes into effect, it could swell
Democratic and Republican campaign coffers
by some $30 million each in 1968.
The plan provides that, beginning in 1968,
each income taxpayer would have the option of
designating $1 of his tax- $2 for a couple—to
go into a special fund. If the taxpayer did not
take this option, the dollar still would be col
lected and would go to the Treasury.

• Fire Bombs in Oakland
OAKLAND—Fire bombs exploded at a con
valescent hospital and a private residence yes
terday as city officials, seeking to end Oak
land's three days of racial disorders, promised
no leniency for vandals.
An argument raged over whether a school
boycott had caused the racial trouble.
As heavy police patrols blanketed the af
flicted areas, Dist. Atty. J. Frank Coakley of
Alameda County declared, "There will be no
wholesale amnesty for criminal violators as
there was in San Francisco."
Coakley also said that promoters of the
school boycott were "professional agitators"
and could be prosecuted for what he termed
a "felony conspiracy."
City Manager Jerome Keithley said the
racial disturbances fell far short of the major
riot in San Francisco last month which was
put down by the National Guard.
He said there had been no mob action, just
"relatively small groups of juveniles, from 15
to 50 in number." Keithley said there had been
five arson-caused fires, 35 false alarms, 88 in
cidents of vandalism and 52 arrests.

inated it and has approved it at an earlier stage
in the legislative procedure.
If the plan goes into effect, it could swell
Democratic and Republican campaign coffers
by some $30 million each in 1968.
The plan provides that, beginning in 1968,
each income taxpayer would have the option of
designating $1 of his tax- $2 for a couple—to
go into a special fund. If the taxpayer did not
take this option, the dollar still would be col
lected and would go to the Treasury.

• Fire Bombs in Oakland
OAKLAND—Fire bombs exploded at a con
valescent hospital and a private residence yes
terday as city officials, seeking to end Oak
land's three days of racial disorders, promised
no leniency for vandals.
An argument raged over whether a school
boycott had caused the racial trouble.
As heavy police patrols blanketed the af
flicted areas, Dist. Atty. J. Frank Coakley of
Alameda County declared, "There will be no
wholesale amnesty for criminal violators as
there was in San Francisco."
Coakley also said that promoters of the
school boycott were "professional agitators"
and could be prosecuted for what he termed
a "felony conspiracy."
City Manager Jerome Keithley said the
racial disturbances fell far short of the major
riot in San Francisco last month which was
put down by the National Guard.
He said there had been no mob action, just
"relatively small groups of juveniles, from 15
to 50 in number." Keithley said there had been
five arson-caused fires, 35 false alarms, 88 in
cidents of vandalism and 52 arrests.

• Packaging Bill Passes
WASHINGTON —A bill intended to protect
shoppers against unfair or deceptive methods
of packaging and labeling consumer goods has
cleared Congress after five years of effort.
Congressional action was completed yester
day with Senate acceptance of what virtually
was the version the House insisted on rather
than the bill the Senate originally passed.
Sen. Warren G. Magnuson, chairman of the
Senate Commerce Committee, said he agreed
to the House version with great reluctance. But
he told the Senate the only alternative was to
have no bill at all.

In contrast, Son. Philip A. Hart said he re
garded the House bill as "actually stronger
than the Senate's." He was the author and
chief sponsor of the Senate bill
Five years ago Hart introduced what he
called a "Truth-in-Packaging" bill to deal with
consumer complaints about cents-off deals,
fractional weights and measures, slack fill, mis
leading illustrations, hard-tofind and hard-to
read statements of net contents, and odd
shapes and sizes of packages.

ment of this major ally in the Vietnam war.
Johnson's speech highlighted the opening of
a three-day visit after which the President goes
to Manila for the summit meeting of the seven
nations with forces fighting the Communists
in South Vietnam.
Counting South Vietnam's own army, the
allies have more than a million men under
arms in the Southeast Asian conflict. Aus
tralia provides some 4,500.

• Packaging Bill Passes
WASHINGTON —A bill intended to protect
shoppers against unfair or deceptive methods
of packaging and labeling consumer goods has
cleared Congress after five years of effort.
Congressional action was completed yester
day with Senate acceptance of what virtually
was the version the House insisted on rather
than the bill the Senate originally passed.
Sen. Warren G. Magnuson, chairman of the
Senate Commerce Committee, said he agreed
to the House version with great reluctance. But
he told the Senate the only alternative was to
have no bill at all.

In contrast, Son. Philip A. Hart said he re
garded the House bill as "actually stronger
than the Senate's." He was the author and
chief sponsor of the Senate bill
Five years ago Hart introduced what he
called a "Truth-in-Packaging" bill to deal with
consumer complaints about cents-off deals,
fractional weights and measures, slack fill, mis
leading illustrations, hard-tofind and hard-to
read statements of net contents, and odd
shapes and sizes of packages.
• Taxes For Campaign
WASHINGTON—A novel plan for taxpayers
to finance, in large part, future Presidential
election campaigns won House approval last
night, 171 to 46.
The measure goes to the Senate, which orig
inated it and has approved it at an earlier stage
in the legislative procedure.
If the plan goes into effect, it could swell
Democratic and Republican campaign coffers
by some $30 million each in 1968.
The plan provides that, beginning in 1968,
each income taxpayer would have the option of
designating $1 of his tax- $2 for a couple—to
go into a special fund. If the taxpayer did not
take this option, the dollar still would be col
lected and would go to the Treasury.

• Fire Bombs in Oakland
OAKLAND—Fire bombs exploded at a con
valescent hospital and a private residence yes
terday as city officials, seeking to end Oak
land's three days of racial disorders, promised
no leniency for vandals.
An argument raged over whether a school
boycott had caused the racial trouble.
As heavy police patrols blanketed the af
flicted areas, Dist. Atty. J. Frank Coakley of
Alameda County declared, "There will be no
wholesale amnesty for criminal violators as
there was in San Francisco."
Coakley also said that promoters of the
school boycott were "professional agitators"
and could be prosecuted for what he termed
a "felony conspiracy."
City Manager Jerome Keithley said the
racial disturbances fell far short of the major
riot in San Francisco last month which was
put down by the National Guard.
He said there had been no mob action, just
"relatively small groups of juveniles, from 15
to 50 in number." Keithley said there had been
five arson-caused fires, 35 false alarms, 88 in
cidents of vandalism and 52 arrests.

were reported refusing to withdraw their resig

The ministers for youth and educaton were
to be "willing not to make an issue" oi
their dispute with Premier Nguyen Cao Ky's

said they insisted their resignations remain in
effect.
Unofficial reports circulated that Ky had pre

their resignations. But no informed source in

basic differences between his inner circle of
natives of North Vietnam and the dissenting
ministers.
