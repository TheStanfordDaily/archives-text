# Godot: Absurdist Play With Misgivings
## 
### BRUCE MERRY 
Samuel Becket: Waiting For Go
dot (The Playhouse, San Fran
cisco)
One goes to the first of the
post-war absurdist plays with
some misgivings: not least that
it is being performed in the
sleaziest theater one had ever
seen. You need to keep the
gangways clear and wide in Go
dot. And you do not want the
pauses, almost the most impor
tant part of the dialogue, punc
tuated by the whine of passing
trolley-buses.
Nor is the play as good in
English, or American, as in
French: for example, Estragon's
"True," wherever he concedes
Vladimar a point—"Would we
have helped him if we weren't
his friends?" "Pull on your
trousers"—stings quicker in the
original. If manv of the remarks

are delivered with cosmic refer
ence, the American accent is still
not the best local burr to carry
their message.
This is why Pozzo ('pit'
'abyss') was so lucid last Satur
day. Caricature of an arrogant
British land-owner who alter
nately kicks and pities his grov
eling menial Lucky, Pozzo has
a hard part. Mr. Reagan, bald
and cardiac, was the slickest Poz
zo I have seen. In Act II he cor
rectly parodied blind Oedipus be
ing led by Ismeme from Thebes
to Colonus. Unwittingly, for he
says he never did any home
work on this part, he was the
perfect English squire; with, one
gathered, an Oklahama accent.
Exhaustion And Obedience
I cannot presume to state the
symbolism of this tragedy, nor
did Mr. Lindeman, its director.
Becket himself once said that
had he known what Godot is he
would have put him in the play.
What is sure, however, is that
Lucky depicts the mass of suf
fering, exhausted and obedient
humanity. He is all of us, ever
ready to toe the line, to await
the command of God or our
superiors.
Alfieri, a Piedmontese noble
man who knocked off twenty
tragedies in the days of Napo
leon Bonaparte, issued two pre
scriptions for the success of the
tragic buskin: no speech should
be longer than twenty-five lines;
preferably they should be short
er than ten or five, and the char
acters should be six or less.
Becket, who studied Italian
and French at the same colleges
as Wilde, was prepared to learn
from previous writers. Thus his
monologue for Lucky is an im
portant exception to Alfieri's
rule. For Lucky, otherwise per
sona muta, gets one of the cru
cial soliloquies: in this tirade of
soaring grandiloquence, the
ruined slave cries out before the
gas-chamber. The scrapegoat's
agony,' it is close to the solo
utterances of Joyce's protagon
ists. Like the parabasis of the
Greek comedy, it is also the auth
or's opportunity to write himself
into his work. Becket grasped
this lull in the action to spell out
in hypermania the symbol of our
common doom. Naked and bleed
ing, Lucky spews the human pre
dicament, and Mr. Becket, being
great, is also simple.
Snoozing Restlessly
The audience, of course—the
same as the audience which
ninety minutes later snoozed
restlessly between lines—tittered
during Lucky's thought. How

ever, we could not shrug, like
Atlas, and dismiss it as a bad
chapter from Finnegan's Wake,
though it was manic drift of the
same stamp . . . Its screaming
lyricism is that of postwar cyni
cism seen through the gilded
eyes of an Irish intellectual liv
ing in Paris.
The play reverses the roles be
tween its two acts. Few good
plays consist of two, rather than
one, or five, or three acts. Thus
one was interested in Becket's
many symmetries between the
two acts: The Boy concluding
each; Pozzo and Lucky filling
out half of each; Vladimir and
Estragon virtually reversing
their fears and apophthegms to
and from each other during the
pair of acts.
Unlike Steinbek's Lennie in
"Mice and Men," bumbling Gogo
grows wise by the adoption of his
fellow-tramp's sceptical wisdom.
This scotches the polite view of
psychoanalytic critics that Bec
ket's heroes stand for the Id and
the Ego. One is tempted to cite
Cyril Connolly on such interpre
tations: on Miller's A Psycho
analytic Study of Proust: "As a
rule I dread this kind of book:
the intrusion of the brash, cock
sure and semi-illiterate analyst
into the Brocelinande where gen
ius and neurosis wander hand
in hand is seldom rewarding."
Tedium Is Credit To Cast
Silence is eloquent in the por
trayal of any giant dilemma. So
is brevity. In En Attendant Go
dot, Becket was both laconic and
eloquent. It is a play which,
however well acted, can not fail.
A dozing audience is better than
an audience busily explaining
the puns to their industrial hus
bands. But the tedium in our
audience was not only a credit
to Mr. Lindeman's directing, it
is also a proof of the dignity
and competence of his cast.
I would have liked the Boy
to speak rhythmically lines
which are, after all, only rhyth
mical: "Yes Sir" "No Sir" "I
don't know Sir". Mr. Sheehan,
as Vladimir, might have varied
his facial expressions more gen
erously. The lad who played
Lucky should have had Pozzo's
rope around his neck—imminent
execution — rather than his
shoulders. The quick question
and answer repartee could have
been taken with a more rapid
exchange. They do after all
probably suggest those doctor's
word games: "Say what comes
into your mind after every word
I suggest."
Even the scenery erred to the
over-economical, and the distinc
tion between day and night is
not the same as that between
pink and blue. Lastly, one might
have done without that creepy
musical number at the start of
each Act. All it suggested was
an invasion of our planet by the
Daleks.
Becket's Intent
What, then, does one expect
from a Godot? The fact that
Godot himself has to shout at
his horse may be important to
a study of Becket's intent; it
shows that Godot too is slow,
fumbles and rides on an ancient
donkey with the rest of us; any

way, as Frost said, an author is
entitled to anything his audience
can read into him. Estragon
was able to draw from Vladimir
the Proustian equation: "Let
him alone. Can't you see he's
thinking of the days when he
was happy. Memoria praeterl
torum bonorum. That must be
unpleasant." This too may be a
guideline.

The tragedy is everywhere
loaded with profound statements
cast as casual conversation be
tween a couple of bums. Toe li
rector brought it out as he
could. He set a skillful J cast
loose on raw material, • His
finished product impressed.
Through tedium and sorrow
watch this play, if only because
it is showing nowhere else.

be longer than twenty-five lines;
preferably they should be short
er than ten or five, and the char
acters should be six or less.
Becket, who studied Italian
and French at the same colleges
as Wilde, was prepared to learn
from previous writers. Thus his
monologue for Lucky is an im
portant exception to Alfieri's
rule. For Lucky, otherwise per
sona muta, gets one of the cru
cial soliloquies: in this tirade of
soaring grandiloquence, the
ruined slave cries out before the
gas-chamber. The scrapegoat's
agony,' it is close to the solo
utterances of Joyce's protagon
ists. Like the parabasis of the
Greek comedy, it is also the auth
or's opportunity to write himself
into his work. Becket grasped
this lull in the action to spell out
in hypermania the symbol of our
common doom. Naked and bleed
ing, Lucky spews the human pre
dicament, and Mr. Becket, being
great, is also simple.
Snoozing Restlessly
The audience, of course—the
same as the audience which
ninety minutes later snoozed
restlessly between lines—tittered
during Lucky's thought. How

ever, we could not shrug, like
Atlas, and dismiss it as a bad
chapter from Finnegan's Wake,
though it was manic drift of the
same stamp . . . Its screaming
lyricism is that of postwar cyni
cism seen through the gilded
eyes of an Irish intellectual liv
ing in Paris.
The play reverses the roles be
tween its two acts. Few good
plays consist of two, rather than
one, or five, or three acts. Thus
one was interested in Becket's
many symmetries between the
two acts: The Boy concluding
each; Pozzo and Lucky filling
out half of each; Vladimir and
Estragon virtually reversing
their fears and apophthegms to
and from each other during the
pair of acts.
Unlike Steinbek's Lennie in
"Mice and Men," bumbling Gogo
grows wise by the adoption of his
fellow-tramp's sceptical wisdom.
This scotches the polite view of
psychoanalytic critics that Bec
ket's heroes stand for the Id and
the Ego. One is tempted to cite
Cyril Connolly on such interpre
tations: on Miller's A Psycho
analytic Study of Proust: "As a
rule I dread this kind of book:
the intrusion of the brash, cock
sure and semi-illiterate analyst
into the Brocelinande where gen
ius and neurosis wander hand
in hand is seldom rewarding."
Tedium Is Credit To Cast
Silence is eloquent in the por
trayal of any giant dilemma. So
is brevity. In En Attendant Go
dot, Becket was both laconic and
eloquent. It is a play which,
however well acted, can not fail.
A dozing audience is better than
an audience busily explaining
the puns to their industrial hus
bands. But the tedium in our
audience was not only a credit
to Mr. Lindeman's directing, it
is also a proof of the dignity
and competence of his cast.
I would have liked the Boy
to speak rhythmically lines
which are, after all, only rhyth
mical: "Yes Sir" "No Sir" "I
don't know Sir". Mr. Sheehan,
as Vladimir, might have varied
his facial expressions more gen
erously. The lad who played
Lucky should have had Pozzo's
rope around his neck—imminent
execution — rather than his
shoulders. The quick question
and answer repartee could have
been taken with a more rapid
exchange. They do after all
probably suggest those doctor's
word games: "Say what comes
into your mind after every word
I suggest."
Even the scenery erred to the
over-economical, and the distinc
tion between day and night is
not the same as that between
pink and blue. Lastly, one might
have done without that creepy
musical number at the start of
each Act. All it suggested was
an invasion of our planet by the
Daleks.
Becket's Intent
What, then, does one expect
from a Godot? The fact that
Godot himself has to shout at
his horse may be important to
a study of Becket's intent; it
shows that Godot too is slow,
fumbles and rides on an ancient
donkey with the rest of us; any

way, as Frost said, an author is
entitled to anything his audience
can read into him. Estragon
was able to draw from Vladimir
the Proustian equation: "Let
him alone. Can't you see he's
thinking of the days when he
was happy. Memoria praeterl
torum bonorum. That must be
unpleasant." This too may be a
guideline.

The tragedy is everywhere
loaded with profound statements
cast as casual conversation be
tween a couple of bums. Toe li
rector brought it out as he
could. He set a skillful J cast
loose on raw material, • His
finished product impressed.
Through tedium and sorrow
watch this play, if only because
it is showing nowhere else.
Samuel Becket: Waiting For Go
dot (The Playhouse, San Fran
cisco)
One goes to the first of the
post-war absurdist plays with
some misgivings: not least that
it is being performed in the
sleaziest theater one had ever
seen. You need to keep the
gangways clear and wide in Go
dot. And you do not want the
pauses, almost the most impor
tant part of the dialogue, punc
tuated by the whine of passing
trolley-buses.
Nor is the play as good in
English, or American, as in
French: for example, Estragon's
"True," wherever he concedes
Vladimar a point—"Would we
have helped him if we weren't
his friends?" "Pull on your
trousers"—stings quicker in the
original. If manv of the remarks

are delivered with cosmic refer
ence, the American accent is still
not the best local burr to carry
their message.
This is why Pozzo ('pit'
'abyss') was so lucid last Satur
day. Caricature of an arrogant
British land-owner who alter
nately kicks and pities his grov
eling menial Lucky, Pozzo has
a hard part. Mr. Reagan, bald
and cardiac, was the slickest Poz
zo I have seen. In Act II he cor
rectly parodied blind Oedipus be
ing led by Ismeme from Thebes
to Colonus. Unwittingly, for he
says he never did any home
work on this part, he was the
perfect English squire; with, one
gathered, an Oklahama accent.
Exhaustion And Obedience
I cannot presume to state the
symbolism of this tragedy, nor
did Mr. Lindeman, its director.
Becket himself once said that
had he known what Godot is he
would have put him in the play.
What is sure, however, is that
Lucky depicts the mass of suf
fering, exhausted and obedient
humanity. He is all of us, ever
ready to toe the line, to await
the command of God or our
superiors.
Alfieri, a Piedmontese noble
man who knocked off twenty
tragedies in the days of Napo
leon Bonaparte, issued two pre
scriptions for the success of the
tragic buskin: no speech should
be longer than twenty-five lines;
preferably they should be short
er than ten or five, and the char
acters should be six or less.

tations: on Miller's A Psycho
analytic Study of Proust: "As a
rule I dread this kind of book:
the intrusion of the brash, cock
sure and semi-illiterate analyst
into the Brocelinande where gen
ius and neurosis wander hand
in hand is seldom rewarding."
Tedium Is Credit To Cast
Silence is eloquent in the por
trayal of any giant dilemma. So
is brevity. In En Attendant Go
dot, Becket was both laconic and
eloquent. It is a play which,
however well acted, can not fail.
A dozing audience is better than
an audience busily explaining
the puns to their industrial hus
bands. But the tedium in our
audience was not only a credit
to Mr. Lindeman's directing, it
is also a proof of the dignity
and competence of his cast.
I would have liked the Boy
to speak rhythmically lines
which are, after all, only rhyth
mical: "Yes Sir" "No Sir" "I
don't know Sir". Mr. Sheehan,
as Vladimir, might have varied
his facial expressions more gen
erously. The lad who played
Lucky should have had Pozzo's
rope around his neck—imminent
execution — rather than his
shoulders. The quick question
and answer repartee could have
been taken with a more rapid
exchange. They do after all
probably suggest those doctor's
word games: "Say what comes
into your mind after every word
I suggest."
Even the scenery erred to the
over-economical, and the distinc
tion between day and night is
not the same as that between
pink and blue. Lastly, one might
have done without that creepy
musical number at the start of
each Act. All it suggested was
an invasion of our planet by the
Daleks.
Becket's Intent
What, then, does one expect
from a Godot? The fact that
Godot himself has to shout at
his horse may be important to
a study of Becket's intent; it
shows that Godot too is slow,
fumbles and rides on an ancient
donkey with the rest of us; any

way, as Frost said, an author is
entitled to anything his audience
can read into him. Estragon
was able to draw from Vladimir
the Proustian equation: "Let
him alone. Can't you see he's
thinking of the days when he
was happy. Memoria praeterl
torum bonorum. That must be
unpleasant." This too may be a
guideline.

The tragedy is everywhere
loaded with profound statements
cast as casual conversation be
tween a couple of bums. Toe li
rector brought it out as he
could. He set a skillful J cast
loose on raw material, • His
finished product impressed.
Through tedium and sorrow
watch this play, if only because
it is showing nowhere else.
Samuel Becket: Waiting For Go
dot (The Playhouse, San Fran
cisco)
One goes to the first of the
post-war absurdist plays with
some misgivings: not least that
it is being performed in the
sleaziest theater one had ever
seen. You need to keep the
gangways clear and wide in Go
dot. And you do not want the
pauses, almost the most impor
tant part of the dialogue, punc
tuated by the whine of passing
trolley-buses.
Nor is the play as good in
English, or American, as in
French: for example, Estragon's
"True," wherever he concedes
Vladimar a point—"Would we
have helped him if we weren't
his friends?" "Pull on your
trousers"—stings quicker in the
original. If manv of the remarks

are delivered with cosmic refer
ence, the American accent is still
not the best local burr to carry
their message.
This is why Pozzo ('pit'
'abyss') was so lucid last Satur
day. Caricature of an arrogant
British land-owner who alter
nately kicks and pities his grov
eling menial Lucky, Pozzo has
a hard part. Mr. Reagan, bald
and cardiac, was the slickest Poz
zo I have seen. In Act II he cor
rectly parodied blind Oedipus be
ing led by Ismeme from Thebes
to Colonus. Unwittingly, for he
says he never did any home
work on this part, he was the
perfect English squire; with, one
gathered, an Oklahama accent.
Exhaustion And Obedience
I cannot presume to state the
symbolism of this tragedy, nor
did Mr. Lindeman, its director.
Becket himself once said that
had he known what Godot is he
would have put him in the play.
What is sure, however, is that
Lucky depicts the mass of suf
fering, exhausted and obedient
humanity. He is all of us, ever
ready to toe the line, to await
the command of God or our
superiors.
Alfieri, a Piedmontese noble
man who knocked off twenty
tragedies in the days of Napo
leon Bonaparte, issued two pre
scriptions for the success of the
tragic buskin: no speech should
be longer than twenty-five lines;
preferably they should be short
er than ten or five, and the char
acters should be six or less.
Becket, who studied Italian
and French at the same colleges
as Wilde, was prepared to learn
from previous writers. Thus his
monologue for Lucky is an im
portant exception to Alfieri's
rule. For Lucky, otherwise per
sona muta, gets one of the cru
cial soliloquies: in this tirade of
soaring grandiloquence, the
ruined slave cries out before the
gas-chamber. The scrapegoat's
agony,' it is close to the solo
utterances of Joyce's protagon
ists. Like the parabasis of the
Greek comedy, it is also the auth
or's opportunity to write himself
into his work. Becket grasped
this lull in the action to spell out
in hypermania the symbol of our
common doom. Naked and bleed
ing, Lucky spews the human pre
dicament, and Mr. Becket, being
great, is also simple.
Snoozing Restlessly
The audience, of course—the
same as the audience which
ninety minutes later snoozed
restlessly between lines—tittered
during Lucky's thought. How

ever, we could not shrug, like
Atlas, and dismiss it as a bad
chapter from Finnegan's Wake,
though it was manic drift of the
same stamp . . . Its screaming
lyricism is that of postwar cyni
cism seen through the gilded
eyes of an Irish intellectual liv
ing in Paris.
The play reverses the roles be
tween its two acts. Few good
plays consist of two, rather than
one, or five, or three acts. Thus
one was interested in Becket's
many symmetries between the
two acts: The Boy concluding
each; Pozzo and Lucky filling
out half of each; Vladimir and
Estragon virtually reversing
their fears and apophthegms to
and from each other during the
pair of acts.
Unlike Steinbek's Lennie in
"Mice and Men," bumbling Gogo
grows wise by the adoption of his
fellow-tramp's sceptical wisdom.
This scotches the polite view of
psychoanalytic critics that Bec
ket's heroes stand for the Id and
the Ego. One is tempted to cite
Cyril Connolly on such interpre
tations: on Miller's A Psycho
analytic Study of Proust: "As a
rule I dread this kind of book:
the intrusion of the brash, cock
sure and semi-illiterate analyst

Samuel Becket: Waiting For Go
dot (The Playhouse, San Fran
cisco)
One goes to the first of the
post-war absurdist plays with
some misgivings: not least that
it is being performed in the
sleaziest theater one had ever
seen. You need to keep the
gangways clear and wide in Go
dot. And you do not want the
pauses, almost the most impor
tant part of the dialogue, punc
tuated by the whine of passing
trolley-buses.
Nor is the play as good in
English, or American, as in
French: for example, Estragon's
"True," wherever he concedes
Vladimar a point—"Would we
have helped him if we weren't
his friends?" "Pull on your
trousers"—stings quicker in the
original. If manv of the remarks

are delivered with cosmic refer
ence, the American accent is still
not the best local burr to carry
their message.
This is why Pozzo ('pit'
'abyss') was so lucid last Satur
day. Caricature of an arrogant
British land-owner who alter
nately kicks and pities his grov
eling menial Lucky, Pozzo has
a hard part. Mr. Reagan, bald
and cardiac, was the slickest Poz
zo I have seen. In Act II he cor
rectly parodied blind Oedipus be
ing led by Ismeme from Thebes
to Colonus. Unwittingly, for he
says he never did any home
work on this part, he was the
perfect English squire; with, one
gathered, an Oklahama accent.
Exhaustion And Obedience
I cannot presume to state the
symbolism of this tragedy, nor
did Mr. Lindeman, its director.
Becket himself once said that
had he known what Godot is he
would have put him in the play.
What is sure, however, is that
Lucky depicts the mass of suf
fering, exhausted and obedient
humanity. He is all of us, ever
ready to toe the line, to await
the command of God or our
superiors.
Alfieri, a Piedmontese noble
man who knocked off twenty
tragedies in the days of Napo
leon Bonaparte, issued two pre
scriptions for the success of the
tragic buskin: no speech should
be longer than twenty-five lines;
preferably they should be short
er than ten or five, and the char
acters should be six or less.
Becket, who studied Italian
and French at the same colleges
as Wilde, was prepared to learn
from previous writers. Thus his
monologue for Lucky is an im
portant exception to Alfieri's
rule. For Lucky, otherwise per
sona muta, gets one of the cru
cial soliloquies: in this tirade of
soaring grandiloquence, the
ruined slave cries out before the
gas-chamber. The scrapegoat's
agony,' it is close to the solo
utterances of Joyce's protagon
ists. Like the parabasis of the
Greek comedy, it is also the auth
or's opportunity to write himself
into his work. Becket grasped
this lull in the action to spell out
in hypermania the symbol of our
common doom. Naked and bleed
ing, Lucky spews the human pre
dicament, and Mr. Becket, being
great, is also simple.
Snoozing Restlessly
The audience, of course—the
same as the audience which
ninety minutes later snoozed
restlessly between lines—tittered
during Lucky's thought. How

ever, we could not shrug, like
Atlas, and dismiss it as a bad
chapter from Finnegan's Wake,
though it was manic drift of the
same stamp . . . Its screaming
lyricism is that of postwar cyni
cism seen through the gilded
eyes of an Irish intellectual liv
ing in Paris.
The play reverses the roles be
tween its two acts. Few good
plays consist of two, rather than
one, or five, or three acts. Thus
one was interested in Becket's
many symmetries between the
two acts: The Boy concluding
each; Pozzo and Lucky filling
out half of each; Vladimir and
Estragon virtually reversing
their fears and apophthegms to
and from each other during the
pair of acts.
Unlike Steinbek's Lennie in
"Mice and Men," bumbling Gogo
grows wise by the adoption of his
fellow-tramp's sceptical wisdom.
This scotches the polite view of
psychoanalytic critics that Bec
ket's heroes stand for the Id and
the Ego. One is tempted to cite
Cyril Connolly on such interpre
tations: on Miller's A Psycho
analytic Study of Proust: "As a
rule I dread this kind of book:
the intrusion of the brash, cock
sure and semi-illiterate analyst
into the Brocelinande where gen
ius and neurosis wander hand
in hand is seldom rewarding."
Tedium Is Credit To Cast
Silence is eloquent in the por
trayal of any giant dilemma. So
is brevity. In En Attendant Go
dot, Becket was both laconic and
eloquent. It is a play which,
however well acted, can not fail.
A dozing audience is better than
an audience busily explaining
the puns to their industrial hus
bands. But the tedium in our
audience was not only a credit
to Mr. Lindeman's directing, it
is also a proof of the dignity
and competence of his cast.
I would have liked the Boy
to speak rhythmically lines
which are, after all, only rhyth
mical: "Yes Sir" "No Sir" "I
don't know Sir". Mr. Sheehan,
as Vladimir, might have varied
his facial expressions more gen
erously. The lad who played
Lucky should have had Pozzo's
rope around his neck—imminent
execution — rather than his
shoulders. The quick question
and answer repartee could have
been taken with a more rapid
exchange. They do after all
probably suggest those doctor's
word games: "Say what comes
into your mind after every word
I suggest."
Even the scenery erred to the
over-economical, and the distinc
tion between day and night is
not the same as that between
pink and blue. Lastly, one might
have done without that creepy
musical number at the start of
each Act. All it suggested was
an invasion of our planet by the
Daleks.
Becket's Intent
What, then, does one expect
from a Godot? The fact that
Godot himself has to shout at
his horse may be important to
a study of Becket's intent; it
shows that Godot too is slow,
fumbles and rides on an ancient
donkey with the rest of us; any

way, as Frost said, an author is
entitled to anything his audience
can read into him. Estragon
was able to draw from Vladimir
the Proustian equation: "Let
him alone. Can't you see he's
thinking of the days when he
was happy. Memoria praeterl
torum bonorum. That must be
unpleasant." This too may be a
