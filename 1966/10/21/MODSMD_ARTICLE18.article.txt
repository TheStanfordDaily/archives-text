# REVIEW
## A 						Marc & Cleo Fiasco 
### CURT KECK Entertainment Editor 
Last season saw the Stanford
Repertory Theatre well on the
road to eminence. In view of this
one can be hopeful and dis
miss their latest production, "An
thony and Cleopatra," as nothing
worse than a loud blow-out and
brief pit-stop along this road.
The Erick Vos production bodes
ill from the opening scene, with
Anthony, played by Morgan
Stearne, spewing a drunken
avowal of his devotion for Cleo
patra and Egypt into the face of
one of Caesar's messengers.
Stearne, looking more of a lad
than a cad, here and elsewhere
proved himself an apt compan
ion for the bonnie lass Cleopatra.
One wonders just who is this
black-haired, Egyptian wench
that is the object of Anthony's
amorous ravings. One wonders
all the more when she appears.
She surely doesn't look like a
Cleopatra. She assuredly doesn't
have the thoaty, lusty voice reg
ister of a Cleopatra. And she
most certainly commands neith
er the seductive appeal nor the
dignity of a Cleopatra.
Although the audience be
comes inured to the homey, girl
next-door style of Miss Lever
see's Cleopatra, she rarely is
physically or vocally forceful
enough to be convincing as the
world's most infamous tempte
ress. Much of Miss Leversee's
problem results from the quality
of her voice—too much girlish
tremolo and not enough depth.
Morgan Stearne was far better
cast for his role as Anthony than
was Miss Leversee for hers.
Stearne appeared his best in the
scenes with Cleopatra, perhaps
by comparison; and he showed
that he possessed the tools to
convincingly expose the sham
bolic dwelling of Anthony's
mind. Anthony is torn bewteen
his stark commitment to the
Trimumphirate in Rome and the
lures of his Egyptian queen.
However, at key moments when
the drama should have been su
per-charged with emotion,
Stearne lost control and rushed
through his lines with slight or
no voice modulation.
Anlhony's compatriot, Domi
tius Enobarbus, played by Gil
-bert Green, was far and away
the play's best actor. After ac
customing the audience to his
sentences tailing off in an echo
of W. C. Fields, Mr. Green soared
to a level all his own. He didn't
merely speak his lines, he
stuffed ever crack and cranny
of Memorial Auditorium with
his deep velvet resonance. Each
word whispered from his lips or
an outrage hurled from his
snarling mouth bespoke tribute
to this great actor.
Scarcely less impressive was
Paul E. Winfield, featured in
three supporting roles. In a
raucous feast scene as Sextus

Pompeius, Winfield takes com
mand of the stage. All eyes focus
on him and leave his merry-mak
ing companions in a blurr. The
high point of 'Anthony and Cleo
patra' came when Sextus Pom
peius screwed up his face in
rage and clutching Menas (Shel
don Feldner) by the throat, spit
out the words, "Ah, this thou
shouldst .have done / And not
have spoke on't. / In me 'tis vil
lany; In thee's had been good
service."
Another redeeming grace of
The Repertory production was
Gerald Hiken's performance as
Octavius Caesar. In the program
notes Erik Vos depicts the world
of Rome as representative of
logic and dogmatism, collared
with a supression of passion. As
suming Vos' purpose, Hiken is
properly bland in emotion and in
ert in personality as Anthony's
adversary, Caesar. In a superb
scene, Caesar stands on a stool
surrounded by shouts and laugh
ter of Pompeius, Anthony and
their entourages. The laughter
dies , the shouts wither away.
Caesar alone carries on in a
most unimperious fashion. Sud
denly, as if snapping out of a
daydream, he notices the som
ber countenances that judge him.
Here, Hiken ad ligs a triffle and
says "I'm sorry." Would that
Shapespeare had written those
words and Hiken were to always
say them, 'Anthony and Cleo
patra' should benefit.
Erik Vos flirts with a free
form stage structure. In the pro
gram notes he points out that
"Rome and Egypt don't exist so
much in the countries that they
represent, but more in what they
evoke in the viewers in the
viewers imagings." Supposedly
the stage, looking like a curious
ly bloated stalagmites and stalac
tites in a spotlighted spelunker,
was to represent Anthony's
heart. As the stage revolved
from time to time on a lazy
susan, the audience was meant
to extrapolate some worthwhile
interpretation from the stage
positions. Notwithstanding the
stage set-up as an artfully con
trived convenience for switching
scenes, Mr. Vos' subtlety thor
oughly elludes any meaningful
symbolism.
What is worse, the actual phisi
ognomy of the settings conjures

up nothing particular in our
imaginations "that is exotic,
dangerous but attractive . . .
and irregular itch on the smooth
skin of our formal live . . . the
uncontrollable release of our pas
sions" as Mr. Vos would have it.
Another innovation in the pro
duction is the use of electric
music, as composed and ar
ranged by Christopher Lantz.
Notably effective was the occa
sional thud-thud-thudding of An
thony's heart beat. When the
music came in the scurry of
battle or at the crest of emo
tional build-up, the weird sounds
blended into the scene and com
nlimented the intended effects.
However all too often, electronic
sounds sliced into what was hap
pening on stage and startled the
consciousness rather than prick
ing the subconscious imagina
tion. A old curtisian proverb,
in 1966 8.5., proclaimed the ideal
score to exist solely in the aware
ness of the subconscious and
never to offend the conscious
ness by diverting attention from
the actors on stage.
The choreography was simple
and effective. convey the no
tion of a ship paddling about
on the water, half a dozen or
so oarsmen wagged their oars
in the air.
The lighting was good because
at no time did it become intru
sive. Costumes certainly lacked
the sumptious arrary of 20th
Century's "Cleopatra," but then
neither was grandeur essential
nor could the Repertory Theatre
afford it. Cleopatra's gowns
could have been a little more
sheer and her bustline a lot more
exposed. Afterall Cleopatra is
supposed to exude that firebrand
sex-and-sauce appeal.
In several instances, it was
painfully obvious that the
swords were wooden rather than
metal. A trivial cost-cutting sub
stitute like that adds nothing to
the budget and detracts much
from the play's realism.
"Anthony and Cleopatra" is
montonous at worse and limpid
at best. That the director makes
claims of his production's worth
not as a final product, but "more
as a research in theatrical forms
and contents" seems a hurriedly
fabricated justification for fail
ings of his own and of his two
stars, Anthony and Cleopatra.

his deep velvet resonance. Each
word whispered from his lips or
an outrage hurled from his
snarling mouth bespoke tribute
to this great actor.
Scarcely less impressive was
Paul E. Winfield, featured in
three supporting roles. In a
raucous feast scene as Sextus

Pompeius, Winfield takes com
mand of the stage. All eyes focus
on him and leave his merry-mak
ing companions in a blurr. The
high point of 'Anthony and Cleo
patra' came when Sextus Pom
peius screwed up his face in
rage and clutching Menas (Shel
don Feldner) by the throat, spit
out the words, "Ah, this thou
shouldst .have done / And not
have spoke on't. / In me 'tis vil
lany; In thee's had been good
service."
Another redeeming grace of
The Repertory production was
Gerald Hiken's performance as
Octavius Caesar. In the program
notes Erik Vos depicts the world
of Rome as representative of
logic and dogmatism, collared
with a supression of passion. As
suming Vos' purpose, Hiken is
properly bland in emotion and in
ert in personality as Anthony's
adversary, Caesar. In a superb
scene, Caesar stands on a stool
surrounded by shouts and laugh
ter of Pompeius, Anthony and
their entourages. The laughter
dies , the shouts wither away.
Caesar alone carries on in a
most unimperious fashion. Sud
denly, as if snapping out of a
daydream, he notices the som
ber countenances that judge him.
Here, Hiken ad ligs a triffle and
says "I'm sorry." Would that
Shapespeare had written those
words and Hiken were to always
say them, 'Anthony and Cleo
patra' should benefit.
Erik Vos flirts with a free
form stage structure. In the pro
gram notes he points out that
"Rome and Egypt don't exist so
much in the countries that they
represent, but more in what they
evoke in the viewers in the
viewers imagings." Supposedly
the stage, looking like a curious
ly bloated stalagmites and stalac
tites in a spotlighted spelunker,
was to represent Anthony's
heart. As the stage revolved
from time to time on a lazy
susan, the audience was meant
to extrapolate some worthwhile
interpretation from the stage
positions. Notwithstanding the
stage set-up as an artfully con
trived convenience for switching
scenes, Mr. Vos' subtlety thor
oughly elludes any meaningful
symbolism.
What is worse, the actual phisi
ognomy of the settings conjures

up nothing particular in our
imaginations "that is exotic,
dangerous but attractive . . .
and irregular itch on the smooth
skin of our formal live . . . the
uncontrollable release of our pas
sions" as Mr. Vos would have it.
Another innovation in the pro
duction is the use of electric
music, as composed and ar
ranged by Christopher Lantz.
Notably effective was the occa
sional thud-thud-thudding of An
thony's heart beat. When the
music came in the scurry of
battle or at the crest of emo
tional build-up, the weird sounds
blended into the scene and com
nlimented the intended effects.
However all too often, electronic
sounds sliced into what was hap
pening on stage and startled the
consciousness rather than prick
ing the subconscious imagina
tion. A old curtisian proverb,
in 1966 8.5., proclaimed the ideal
score to exist solely in the aware
ness of the subconscious and
never to offend the conscious
ness by diverting attention from
the actors on stage.
The choreography was simple
and effective. convey the no
tion of a ship paddling about
on the water, half a dozen or
so oarsmen wagged their oars
in the air.
The lighting was good because
at no time did it become intru
sive. Costumes certainly lacked
the sumptious arrary of 20th
Century's "Cleopatra," but then
neither was grandeur essential
nor could the Repertory Theatre
afford it. Cleopatra's gowns
could have been a little more
sheer and her bustline a lot more
exposed. Afterall Cleopatra is
supposed to exude that firebrand
sex-and-sauce appeal.
In several instances, it was
painfully obvious that the
swords were wooden rather than
metal. A trivial cost-cutting sub
stitute like that adds nothing to
the budget and detracts much
from the play's realism.
"Anthony and Cleopatra" is
montonous at worse and limpid
at best. That the director makes
claims of his production's worth
not as a final product, but "more
as a research in theatrical forms
and contents" seems a hurriedly
fabricated justification for fail
ings of his own and of his two
stars, Anthony and Cleopatra.
Last season saw the Stanford
Repertory Theatre well on the
road to eminence. In view of this
one can be hopeful and dis
miss their latest production, "An
thony and Cleopatra," as nothing
worse than a loud blow-out and
brief pit-stop along this road.
The Erick Vos production bodes
ill from the opening scene, with
Anthony, played by Morgan
Stearne, spewing a drunken
avowal of his devotion for Cleo
patra and Egypt into the face of
one of Caesar's messengers.
Stearne, looking more of a lad
than a cad, here and elsewhere
proved himself an apt compan
ion for the bonnie lass Cleopatra.
One wonders just who is this
black-haired, Egyptian wench
that is the object of Anthony's
amorous ravings. One wonders
all the more when she appears.
She surely doesn't look like a
Cleopatra. She assuredly doesn't
have the thoaty, lusty voice reg
ister of a Cleopatra. And she
most certainly commands neith
er the seductive appeal nor the
dignity of a Cleopatra.
Although the audience be
comes inured to the homey, girl
next-door style of Miss Lever
see's Cleopatra, she rarely is
physically or vocally forceful
enough to be convincing as the
world's most infamous tempte
ress. Much of Miss Leversee's
problem results from the quality
of her voice—too much girlish
tremolo and not enough depth.
Morgan Stearne was far better
cast for his role as Anthony than
was Miss Leversee for hers.
Stearne appeared his best in the
scenes with Cleopatra, perhaps
by comparison; and he showed
that he possessed the tools to
convincingly expose the sham
bolic dwelling of Anthony's
mind. Anthony is torn bewteen
his stark commitment to the
Trimumphirate in Rome and the
lures of his Egyptian queen.
However, at key moments when
the drama should have been su
per-charged with emotion,
Stearne lost control and rushed
through his lines with slight or
no voice modulation.
Anlhony's compatriot, Domi
tius Enobarbus, played by Gil
-bert Green, was far and away
the play's best actor. After ac
customing the audience to his
sentences tailing off in an echo
of W. C. Fields, Mr. Green soared
to a level all his own. He didn't
merely speak his lines, he
stuffed ever crack and cranny
of Memorial Auditorium with
his deep velvet resonance. Each
word whispered from his lips or
an outrage hurled from his
snarling mouth bespoke tribute
to this great actor.

symbolism.
What is worse, the actual phisi
ognomy of the settings conjures

up nothing particular in our
imaginations "that is exotic,
dangerous but attractive . . .
and irregular itch on the smooth
skin of our formal live . . . the
uncontrollable release of our pas
sions" as Mr. Vos would have it.
Another innovation in the pro
duction is the use of electric
music, as composed and ar
ranged by Christopher Lantz.
Notably effective was the occa
sional thud-thud-thudding of An
thony's heart beat. When the
music came in the scurry of
battle or at the crest of emo
tional build-up, the weird sounds
blended into the scene and com
nlimented the intended effects.
However all too often, electronic
sounds sliced into what was hap
pening on stage and startled the
consciousness rather than prick
ing the subconscious imagina
tion. A old curtisian proverb,
in 1966 8.5., proclaimed the ideal
score to exist solely in the aware
ness of the subconscious and
never to offend the conscious
ness by diverting attention from
the actors on stage.
The choreography was simple
and effective. convey the no
tion of a ship paddling about
on the water, half a dozen or
so oarsmen wagged their oars
in the air.
The lighting was good because
at no time did it become intru
sive. Costumes certainly lacked
the sumptious arrary of 20th
Century's "Cleopatra," but then
neither was grandeur essential
nor could the Repertory Theatre
afford it. Cleopatra's gowns
could have been a little more
sheer and her bustline a lot more
exposed. Afterall Cleopatra is
supposed to exude that firebrand
sex-and-sauce appeal.
In several instances, it was
painfully obvious that the
swords were wooden rather than
metal. A trivial cost-cutting sub
stitute like that adds nothing to
the budget and detracts much
from the play's realism.
"Anthony and Cleopatra" is
montonous at worse and limpid
at best. That the director makes
claims of his production's worth
not as a final product, but "more
as a research in theatrical forms
and contents" seems a hurriedly
fabricated justification for fail
ings of his own and of his two
stars, Anthony and Cleopatra.
Last season saw the Stanford
Repertory Theatre well on the
road to eminence. In view of this
one can be hopeful and dis
miss their latest production, "An
thony and Cleopatra," as nothing
worse than a loud blow-out and
brief pit-stop along this road.
The Erick Vos production bodes
ill from the opening scene, with
Anthony, played by Morgan
Stearne, spewing a drunken
avowal of his devotion for Cleo
patra and Egypt into the face of
one of Caesar's messengers.
Stearne, looking more of a lad
than a cad, here and elsewhere
proved himself an apt compan
ion for the bonnie lass Cleopatra.
One wonders just who is this
black-haired, Egyptian wench
that is the object of Anthony's
amorous ravings. One wonders
all the more when she appears.
She surely doesn't look like a
Cleopatra. She assuredly doesn't
have the thoaty, lusty voice reg
ister of a Cleopatra. And she
most certainly commands neith
er the seductive appeal nor the
dignity of a Cleopatra.
Although the audience be
comes inured to the homey, girl
next-door style of Miss Lever
see's Cleopatra, she rarely is
physically or vocally forceful
enough to be convincing as the
world's most infamous tempte
ress. Much of Miss Leversee's
problem results from the quality
of her voice—too much girlish
tremolo and not enough depth.
Morgan Stearne was far better
cast for his role as Anthony than
was Miss Leversee for hers.
Stearne appeared his best in the
scenes with Cleopatra, perhaps
by comparison; and he showed
that he possessed the tools to
convincingly expose the sham
bolic dwelling of Anthony's
mind. Anthony is torn bewteen
his stark commitment to the
Trimumphirate in Rome and the
lures of his Egyptian queen.
However, at key moments when
the drama should have been su
per-charged with emotion,
Stearne lost control and rushed
through his lines with slight or
no voice modulation.
Anlhony's compatriot, Domi
tius Enobarbus, played by Gil
-bert Green, was far and away
the play's best actor. After ac
customing the audience to his
sentences tailing off in an echo
of W. C. Fields, Mr. Green soared
to a level all his own. He didn't
merely speak his lines, he
stuffed ever crack and cranny
of Memorial Auditorium with
his deep velvet resonance. Each
word whispered from his lips or
an outrage hurled from his
snarling mouth bespoke tribute
to this great actor.
Scarcely less impressive was
Paul E. Winfield, featured in
three supporting roles. In a
raucous feast scene as Sextus

Pompeius, Winfield takes com
mand of the stage. All eyes focus
on him and leave his merry-mak
ing companions in a blurr. The
high point of 'Anthony and Cleo
patra' came when Sextus Pom
peius screwed up his face in
rage and clutching Menas (Shel
don Feldner) by the throat, spit
out the words, "Ah, this thou
shouldst .have done / And not
have spoke on't. / In me 'tis vil
lany; In thee's had been good
service."
Another redeeming grace of
The Repertory production was
Gerald Hiken's performance as
Octavius Caesar. In the program
notes Erik Vos depicts the world
of Rome as representative of
logic and dogmatism, collared
with a supression of passion. As
suming Vos' purpose, Hiken is
properly bland in emotion and in
ert in personality as Anthony's
adversary, Caesar. In a superb
scene, Caesar stands on a stool
surrounded by shouts and laugh
ter of Pompeius, Anthony and
their entourages. The laughter
dies , the shouts wither away.
Caesar alone carries on in a
most unimperious fashion. Sud
denly, as if snapping out of a
daydream, he notices the som
ber countenances that judge him.
Here, Hiken ad ligs a triffle and
says "I'm sorry." Would that
Shapespeare had written those
words and Hiken were to always
say them, 'Anthony and Cleo
patra' should benefit.
Erik Vos flirts with a free
form stage structure. In the pro
gram notes he points out that
"Rome and Egypt don't exist so
much in the countries that they
represent, but more in what they
evoke in the viewers in the
viewers imagings." Supposedly
the stage, looking like a curious
ly bloated stalagmites and stalac
tites in a spotlighted spelunker,
was to represent Anthony's
heart. As the stage revolved
from time to time on a lazy
susan, the audience was meant
to extrapolate some worthwhile
interpretation from the stage
positions. Notwithstanding the
stage set-up as an artfully con
trived convenience for switching
scenes, Mr. Vos' subtlety thor
oughly elludes any meaningful
symbolism.

thony and Cleopatra," as nothing
worse than a loud blow-out and
brief pit-stop along this road.
The Erick Vos production bodes
ill from the opening scene, with
Anthony, played by Morgan
Stearne, spewing a drunken
avowal of his devotion for Cleo
patra and Egypt into the face of
one of Caesar's messengers.
Stearne, looking more of a lad
than a cad, here and elsewhere
proved himself an apt compan
ion for the bonnie lass Cleopatra.
One wonders just who is this
black-haired, Egyptian wench
that is the object of Anthony's
amorous ravings. One wonders
all the more when she appears.
She surely doesn't look like a
Cleopatra. She assuredly doesn't
have the thoaty, lusty voice reg
ister of a Cleopatra. And she
most certainly commands neith
er the seductive appeal nor the
dignity of a Cleopatra.
Although the audience be
comes inured to the homey, girl
next-door style of Miss Lever
see's Cleopatra, she rarely is
physically or vocally forceful
enough to be convincing as the
world's most infamous tempte
ress. Much of Miss Leversee's
problem results from the quality
of her voice—too much girlish
tremolo and not enough depth.
Morgan Stearne was far better
cast for his role as Anthony than
was Miss Leversee for hers.
Stearne appeared his best in the
scenes with Cleopatra, perhaps
by comparison; and he showed
that he possessed the tools to
convincingly expose the sham
bolic dwelling of Anthony's
mind. Anthony is torn bewteen
his stark commitment to the
Trimumphirate in Rome and the
lures of his Egyptian queen.
However, at key moments when
the drama should have been su
per-charged with emotion,
Stearne lost control and rushed
through his lines with slight or
no voice modulation.
Anlhony's compatriot, Domi
tius Enobarbus, played by Gil
-bert Green, was far and away
the play's best actor. After ac
customing the audience to his
sentences tailing off in an echo
of W. C. Fields, Mr. Green soared
to a level all his own. He didn't
merely speak his lines, he
stuffed ever crack and cranny
of Memorial Auditorium with
his deep velvet resonance. Each
word whispered from his lips or
an outrage hurled from his
snarling mouth bespoke tribute
to this great actor.
Scarcely less impressive was
Paul E. Winfield, featured in
three supporting roles. In a
raucous feast scene as Sextus

Pompeius, Winfield takes com
mand of the stage. All eyes focus
on him and leave his merry-mak
ing companions in a blurr. The
high point of 'Anthony and Cleo
patra' came when Sextus Pom
peius screwed up his face in
rage and clutching Menas (Shel
don Feldner) by the throat, spit
out the words, "Ah, this thou
shouldst .have done / And not
have spoke on't. / In me 'tis vil
lany; In thee's had been good
service."
Another redeeming grace of
The Repertory production was
Gerald Hiken's performance as
Octavius Caesar. In the program
notes Erik Vos depicts the world
of Rome as representative of
logic and dogmatism, collared
with a supression of passion. As
suming Vos' purpose, Hiken is
properly bland in emotion and in
ert in personality as Anthony's
adversary, Caesar. In a superb
scene, Caesar stands on a stool
surrounded by shouts and laugh
ter of Pompeius, Anthony and
their entourages. The laughter
dies , the shouts wither away.
Caesar alone carries on in a
most unimperious fashion. Sud
denly, as if snapping out of a
daydream, he notices the som
ber countenances that judge him.
Here, Hiken ad ligs a triffle and
says "I'm sorry." Would that
Shapespeare had written those
words and Hiken were to always
say them, 'Anthony and Cleo
patra' should benefit.
Erik Vos flirts with a free
form stage structure. In the pro
gram notes he points out that
"Rome and Egypt don't exist so
much in the countries that they
represent, but more in what they
evoke in the viewers in the
viewers imagings." Supposedly
the stage, looking like a curious
ly bloated stalagmites and stalac
tites in a spotlighted spelunker,
was to represent Anthony's
heart. As the stage revolved
from time to time on a lazy
susan, the audience was meant
to extrapolate some worthwhile
interpretation from the stage
positions. Notwithstanding the
stage set-up as an artfully con
trived convenience for switching
scenes, Mr. Vos' subtlety thor
oughly elludes any meaningful
symbolism.
What is worse, the actual phisi
ognomy of the settings conjures

up nothing particular in our
imaginations "that is exotic,
dangerous but attractive . . .
and irregular itch on the smooth
skin of our formal live . . . the
uncontrollable release of our pas
sions" as Mr. Vos would have it.
Another innovation in the pro
duction is the use of electric
music, as composed and ar
ranged by Christopher Lantz.
Notably effective was the occa
sional thud-thud-thudding of An
thony's heart beat. When the
music came in the scurry of
battle or at the crest of emo
tional build-up, the weird sounds
blended into the scene and com
nlimented the intended effects.
However all too often, electronic
sounds sliced into what was hap
pening on stage and startled the
consciousness rather than prick
ing the subconscious imagina
tion. A old curtisian proverb,
in 1966 8.5., proclaimed the ideal
score to exist solely in the aware
ness of the subconscious and
never to offend the conscious
ness by diverting attention from
the actors on stage.
The choreography was simple
and effective. convey the no
tion of a ship paddling about
on the water, half a dozen or
so oarsmen wagged their oars
in the air.
The lighting was good because
at no time did it become intru
sive. Costumes certainly lacked
the sumptious arrary of 20th
Century's "Cleopatra," but then
neither was grandeur essential
nor could the Repertory Theatre
afford it. Cleopatra's gowns
could have been a little more
sheer and her bustline a lot more
exposed. Afterall Cleopatra is
supposed to exude that firebrand
sex-and-sauce appeal.
In several instances, it was
painfully obvious that the
swords were wooden rather than
metal. A trivial cost-cutting sub
stitute like that adds nothing to
the budget and detracts much
from the play's realism.
"Anthony and Cleopatra" is
montonous at worse and limpid
at best. That the director makes
claims of his production's worth
not as a final product, but "more
as a research in theatrical forms
and contents" seems a hurriedly
fabricated justification for fail
ings of his own and of his two
stars, Anthony and Cleopatra.
Last season saw the Stanford
Repertory Theatre well on the
road to eminence. In view of this
one can be hopeful and dis
miss their latest production, "An
thony and Cleopatra," as nothing
worse than a loud blow-out and
