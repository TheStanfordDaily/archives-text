# STANFORD-UCLA SHOWDOWN
## Poloists Host NCAA Champions 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER Sports Editor 
Undefeated defending NCAA
champion UCLA barges into the
Farm Pond at 3:30 this after
noon to face the Indians in what
will undoubtedly to be the best
water polo game in the Encina
Pool this season.
The Cards take on UOP Sat-

urday morning at 10:00 in what
should be an anticlamactically
easy contest.
UCLA soared to an undefeated
season in 1965 largely on the
strength of Olympic veterans
Dave Ashleigh and Stan Cole.
Ashleigh has graduated, but Cole
returns even stronger than last
year after a successful sum
mer with the Inland Nu-Pike
AAU polo squad.
Strong Front For UCLA
The Bruins' circus is not a
one man show. Russ Webb re
turns with two years of varsity
experience and an arm that will
cause the Indians troubles, to
say the least.
Sophomore Torrey Webb will
make as many headaches as his
older brother. Jeff Bradley com
pletes the Uclan quartet of first
line threats. Bradley's left hand
makes him a definite danger
from the outside.
Stanford must knock off UCLA
today if the Tribe hopes to
march to the top of the national
collegiate listings.
UCLA has not played USC,
the only team that could touch
the Bruins down South, so far
this season. UCLA will face
Stanford Friday and Cal on Sat
urday.
Cal beat the Indians, 10-9,
earlier this year, but lost later
on to the Trojans, 7-6. Stanford,
with Gary Sheerer back in the

lineup, dunked Southern Cal, 11-
10, in triple overtime last week.
Cards Explosive, De«»p
Stanford has front line ma
terial parallel to the Bruins and
depth that should outweigh the
Uclans.
Mark Parmely, ambisextrous,
hard pushing junior, has rid
dled opponents' nets for 17 goals
so far in the 1966 season. Par
mely scored 26 in 1965, capping
the season with the Northern
California Water Polo League's
Most Valuable Player award.
Gary Sheerer missed three
games this season after a car
accident ankle injury. In four
contests, the junior All-American
has scored 11 times and thrown
12 assist passes. Sheerer, who
now plays with his foot taped,
was the AAU's Most Outstand
ing Player last summer.
John Parker, a transfer to the
Farm, from Foothill College, has
fired in 12 goals so far, second
among the Tribe shooters behind
Parmely.
Parker, a member of the Foot
hill Aquatic Club national AAU
champion team with Sheerer,
will give the Bruin goalie sec
ond thoughts about the joys of
smog-free Northern California
atmosphere.
Soreni Stingy
Mike Sorem made 18 saves in
front of the Stanford goal last
week against the hard shooting

Trojans—Olympic veteran Roy
Saari in particular. The Indian
captain has stopped 50 shots this
season, and will probably get his
greatest test this afternoon.
Bill Meyer scored his elev
enth goal of the season last
week when he lashed the yel
low ball past USC's goalkeeper
in sudden death overtime to give
Stanford an 11-10 victory. Meyer
is the kind of clutch performer
that UCLA could easily do with
out.
Pete Ready led the Stanford
scorers last season. Ready can
never be trusted by an opposing
goalie, for his red hot back
hands can come from all direc
tions, often too hot to touch.
Ready has scored seven times
in 1966, and has equalled his
goal output with his assists.
Record Holders Score
Luis Nicolao, high scorer of
the Papoose squad last season,
has tallied ten times this year.
Nicolao holds the world record
for 100 meters butterfly, and will
be hard to tie down today.
Greg Buckingham holds a
world record of his own, 200
meters individual medley, and
two national records. Bucking
ham has hit nine goals. Bucking
ham uses his great speed to en
gage in blatant thievery from
opponents' ball carriers.
Pete Siebert, a sophomore, ef
fectively contained Saari in the

latter part of the USC game.
Siebert, with 3 goals and 4 as
sists, will see tough action
against UCLA.
Bill Derrig and Doug Jensen*
both seniors, will make the
water hot for the Bruins. Der
rig has scored four and tossed
7 assists. Jensen has chalked up
four of each.


Mark Parmely, a junior who
started playing water polo as a
Stanford freshman, currently
leads Stanford scorers with 17
goals and 2 assists. Parmely
uses both hands with equal dex
terity, much to the chagrin of
opposing goalies.


>ohn Parker has hit the back of
i!»e net 12 times this season to
•:mk second among the Indian
hooters. Parker, a jnnior trans
fer from Foothill, will partici
pate in the Indian war parity that
hopes to down UCLA's NCAA
champion, undefeated water po
loists.

Stanford must knock off UCLA
today if the Tribe hopes to

UCLA has not played USC,
the only team that could touch
the Bruins down South, so far
this season. UCLA will face
Stanford Friday and Cal on Sat
urday.
Cal beat the Indians, 10-9,
earlier this year, but lost later
on to the Trojans, 7-6. Stanford,
with Gary Sheerer back in the

lineup, dunked Southern Cal, 11-
10, in triple overtime last week.
Cards Explosive, De«»p
Stanford has front line ma
terial parallel to the Bruins and
depth that should outweigh the
Uclans.
Mark Parmely, ambisextrous,
hard pushing junior, has rid
dled opponents' nets for 17 goals
so far in the 1966 season. Par
mely scored 26 in 1965, capping
the season with the Northern
California Water Polo League's
Most Valuable Player award.
Gary Sheerer missed three
games this season after a car
accident ankle injury. In four
contests, the junior All-American
has scored 11 times and thrown
12 assist passes. Sheerer, who
now plays with his foot taped,
was the AAU's Most Outstand
ing Player last summer.
John Parker, a transfer to the
Farm, from Foothill College, has
fired in 12 goals so far, second
among the Tribe shooters behind
Parmely.
Parker, a member of the Foot
hill Aquatic Club national AAU
champion team with Sheerer,
will give the Bruin goalie sec
ond thoughts about the joys of
smog-free Northern California
atmosphere.
Soreni Stingy
Mike Sorem made 18 saves in
front of the Stanford goal last
week against the hard shooting

Trojans—Olympic veteran Roy
Saari in particular. The Indian
captain has stopped 50 shots this
season, and will probably get his
greatest test this afternoon.
Bill Meyer scored his elev
enth goal of the season last
week when he lashed the yel
low ball past USC's goalkeeper
in sudden death overtime to give
Stanford an 11-10 victory. Meyer
is the kind of clutch performer
that UCLA could easily do with
out.
Pete Ready led the Stanford
scorers last season. Ready can
never be trusted by an opposing
goalie, for his red hot back
hands can come from all direc
tions, often too hot to touch.
Ready has scored seven times
in 1966, and has equalled his
goal output with his assists.
Record Holders Score
Luis Nicolao, high scorer of
the Papoose squad last season,
has tallied ten times this year.
Nicolao holds the world record
for 100 meters butterfly, and will
be hard to tie down today.
Greg Buckingham holds a
world record of his own, 200
meters individual medley, and
two national records. Bucking
ham has hit nine goals. Bucking
ham uses his great speed to en
gage in blatant thievery from
opponents' ball carriers.
Pete Siebert, a sophomore, ef
fectively contained Saari in the

latter part of the USC game.
Siebert, with 3 goals and 4 as
sists, will see tough action
against UCLA.
Bill Derrig and Doug Jensen*
both seniors, will make the
water hot for the Bruins. Der
rig has scored four and tossed
7 assists. Jensen has chalked up
four of each.


Mark Parmely, a junior who
started playing water polo as a
Stanford freshman, currently
leads Stanford scorers with 17
goals and 2 assists. Parmely
uses both hands with equal dex
terity, much to the chagrin of
opposing goalies.

UCLA soared to an undefeated

Mark Parmely, ambisextrous,
hard pushing junior, has rid
dled opponents' nets for 17 goals
so far in the 1966 season. Par
mely scored 26 in 1965, capping
the season with the Northern
California Water Polo League's
Most Valuable Player award.
Gary Sheerer missed three
games this season after a car
accident ankle injury. In four
contests, the junior All-American
has scored 11 times and thrown
12 assist passes. Sheerer, who
now plays with his foot taped,
was the AAU's Most Outstand
ing Player last summer.
John Parker, a transfer to the
Farm, from Foothill College, has
fired in 12 goals so far, second
among the Tribe shooters behind
Parmely.
Parker, a member of the Foot
hill Aquatic Club national AAU
champion team with Sheerer,
will give the Bruin goalie sec
ond thoughts about the joys of
smog-free Northern California
atmosphere.
Soreni Stingy
Mike Sorem made 18 saves in
front of the Stanford goal last
week against the hard shooting

Trojans—Olympic veteran Roy
Saari in particular. The Indian
captain has stopped 50 shots this
season, and will probably get his
greatest test this afternoon.
Bill Meyer scored his elev
enth goal of the season last
week when he lashed the yel
low ball past USC's goalkeeper
in sudden death overtime to give
Stanford an 11-10 victory. Meyer
is the kind of clutch performer
that UCLA could easily do with
out.
Pete Ready led the Stanford
scorers last season. Ready can
never be trusted by an opposing
goalie, for his red hot back
hands can come from all direc
tions, often too hot to touch.
Ready has scored seven times
in 1966, and has equalled his
goal output with his assists.
Record Holders Score
Luis Nicolao, high scorer of
the Papoose squad last season,
has tallied ten times this year.
Nicolao holds the world record
for 100 meters butterfly, and will
be hard to tie down today.
Greg Buckingham holds a
world record of his own, 200
meters individual medley, and
two national records. Bucking
ham has hit nine goals. Bucking
ham uses his great speed to en
gage in blatant thievery from
opponents' ball carriers.
Pete Siebert, a sophomore, ef
fectively contained Saari in the

latter part of the USC game.
Siebert, with 3 goals and 4 as
sists, will see tough action
against UCLA.
Bill Derrig and Doug Jensen*
both seniors, will make the
water hot for the Bruins. Der
rig has scored four and tossed
7 assists. Jensen has chalked up
four of each.


Mark Parmely, a junior who
started playing water polo as a
Stanford freshman, currently
leads Stanford scorers with 17
goals and 2 assists. Parmely
uses both hands with equal dex
terity, much to the chagrin of
opposing goalies.


>ohn Parker has hit the back of
i!»e net 12 times this season to
•:mk second among the Indian
hooters. Parker, a jnnior trans
fer from Foothill, will partici
pate in the Indian war parity that
hopes to down UCLA's NCAA
champion, undefeated water po
loists.
Undefeated defending NCAA
champion UCLA barges into the
Farm Pond at 3:30 this after
noon to face the Indians in what
will undoubtedly to be the best
water polo game in the Encina
Pool this season.
The Cards take on UOP Sat-

urday morning at 10:00 in what
should be an anticlamactically
easy contest.
UCLA soared to an undefeated
season in 1965 largely on the
strength of Olympic veterans
Dave Ashleigh and Stan Cole.
Ashleigh has graduated, but Cole
returns even stronger than last
year after a successful sum
mer with the Inland Nu-Pike
AAU polo squad.
Strong Front For UCLA
The Bruins' circus is not a
one man show. Russ Webb re
turns with two years of varsity
experience and an arm that will
cause the Indians troubles, to
say the least.
Sophomore Torrey Webb will
make as many headaches as his
older brother. Jeff Bradley com
pletes the Uclan quartet of first
line threats. Bradley's left hand
makes him a definite danger
from the outside.
Stanford must knock off UCLA
today if the Tribe hopes to
march to the top of the national
collegiate listings.
UCLA has not played USC,
the only team that could touch
the Bruins down South, so far
this season. UCLA will face
Stanford Friday and Cal on Sat
urday.
Cal beat the Indians, 10-9,
earlier this year, but lost later
on to the Trojans, 7-6. Stanford,
with Gary Sheerer back in the

lineup, dunked Southern Cal, 11-
10, in triple overtime last week.
