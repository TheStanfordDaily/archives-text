"Whoever organizes an election in
Southeast Asia always wins, and the
government elections in South Viet
nam last month were no exception,"
claimed Francois Sully, Newsweek
magazine's chief Asian correspondent,
last night in Tresidder.
Newsweek's chief Vietnam corre
spondent since 1959, and a resident
of Saigon, Sully contended that all can
didates for Vietnamese office had to
be approved by the Ky government.
"No criticism of the war was permit
ted," he said.
"Five million out of seven million
people voted literally because they
knew the government wanted them
to," Sully continued. The French-born
journalist described the high-pres
sured conduct of the election as no
surprise, for, as he explained, "every
one in Vietnam knows and is used to
the rules of the game; the winner is
always known in advance."
The suppressed Buddhist revolt
against the Ky regime earlier this
year, according to Sully, represented
"the first open attempt by a political
group to squeeze itself and its ideology
between the pro-West and Communist
forces" in the present struggle.
"Peace will return if we neutralize,"
was the message the Buddhist carried
to the people, Sully asserted. "If the
Buddhists had been allowed to cam
paign, the new Assembly would be
packed with neutralists," Sully added.
Asked about the most likely result
in terms of government structure
when the war ends, Sully replied, "a
coalition is the only way to settlement.
You cannot eradicate political views

that have been deeply entrenched for
years."
Sully seemed to surprise the audi
ence of the IRR Asian-Desk discus
sion when he stated that many South
Vietnamese would be delighted to see
the government army or the United
States invade North Vietnam. "Any
thing that would move the conflict up
north would be appreciated by the
South Vietnamese," he commented.
The correspondent claimed to have
detected no enthusiasm for the idea
on the part of United States military
men in Saigon, however.
Disputing the notion that Vietnam
ese are politically apathetic, Sully
argued that even many peasant want
to participate in public affairs. "The
Vietnamese wants responsiveness to
his aspirations," he noted.
"These aspirations, however, differ

sharply, from wanting to look to the
West to following the leadership of
Hanoi," he said. "With such contrast
ing aims, a coalition in the long run
seems most realistic and likely," Sully
eplained.
Premier Ky can expect a strong
challenge to his leadership from
Southern political leaders after the
approaching Asian Conference has
concluded, Sully predicted. The cabi
net crisis earlier this week, which Ky
managed to weather, is indicative of
the growing concern of those in the
Mekong Delta for policy influence
equal to that of Northerners who pres
ently dominate the cabinet, Sully
maintained.
Adding to the distress of the Viet
namese, according to the correspon
dent, is the presence of American and
other allied troops. "With all the

money these troops have, compared to
the average peasant, the economic sit
uation is harshly disrupted," Sully
stated.
"When it becomes highly profitable
for 17-year-old girls to become bar
maids, it is clear how much the tra
tditional family relationships have
been disturbed. And such relation
ships have served as the basis for
stability in the past," he noted.
Sully discounted the possibility of
Japan's assuming a leadership role
in Vietnam. "The Japanese have
learned; they won't mess around in
Southeast Asia," he insited.
Japanese businessmen, however, are
very active in Vietnam, said Sully.
"And they are as well treated in Sai
gon as Americans are in Paris," he
added.
