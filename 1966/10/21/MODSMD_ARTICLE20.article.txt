# SU Harriers Run Against San Jose St.
## 
### 
Stanford's cross-countrymen,
fresh from a rash of personal
best efforts last weekend against
USC and Cal, run against a very
strong San Jose State team at
10:00 a.m. tomorrow, on the
Stanford Golf course.
The freshman harriers won
the Sacramento Invitational in
their first outing of the season
and passed Cal's freshmen last
weekend. The frosh run against
San Jose at 10:30.
Every man on the Papoose
squad bettered his time by at
least 11 seconds last week, and
the team is now only 30 seconds
shy of the all time freshman
record for the Stanford Golf
course.
Five of seven men on the var
sity did their best times last
week. The team ran a minute
and a half faster than Stanford's
varsity did all last season.
Jim Letterer led the Indians,
finishing third in 20:46, the
ninth best race ever run by a
Stanford cross-countryman.
San Jose walked away with
the varsity division title in the
Sacramento Invitational.
