Bill Shoemaker gets off a field goal attempt in
freshman action last year. Shoemaker's toe has
given Stanford 25 points in five games, a figure
that puts Shoemaker in the eighth spot in AAWTJ
scoring, 5 points out of third. Shoemaker's finest
hour came against Tulane when he kicked four
field goals (one good for 50 yards), booted 3 extra
points, ran back two kickoffs for 52 yards, rushed
for 19, and recovered a fumble.
