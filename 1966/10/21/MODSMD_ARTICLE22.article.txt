## 
### 
The strong shooting of Wayne
Wilson, captain Tom Hill, Tuck
er Stanwood, and Dennis Ab
shear brought the Papoose polo
ists from a dismal 0-3 first week
end to a 2-0 performance last
weekend.
The freshmen nipped Foot
hill's JV's, 9-7, and then knocked
off Buchser high school the fol
lowing day, 7-5.
The frosh take on College of
the Sequoias immediately fol
lowing the varsity game with
UCLA today. (Game should
start at 4:30). Saturday morning
at 11:00, Palo Alto High School
will take the watery field
against the Papooses.
The freshmen have improved
their game remarkably since
their first rocky outings, and
will aim to break above .500
this weekend.
