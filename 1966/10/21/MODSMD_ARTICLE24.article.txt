# Indians Travel To Fight Big-Ten Illini
## 
### TOM EDISON 
Taking on its second Big Ten
opponent this year and again
away from home, Stanford's
football team hopes it can do
more than just look good while

losing this Saturday against Il
linois.
Stanford and Illinois have
identical records. However,
Stanford comes off of two de
feats while Illinois is rolling

after two straight victories over
Ohio State and Indiana.
Both teams are also plagued
with injuries, but Illinois's seem
ed to have hit in one spot; their
backfield. This will be the sixth
starting backfield for the Illini
in six games this season. Satur
day Illinois coach Pete Elliott
will start an all-sophomore back
field comprised of quarterback
Bob Naponic, fullback Carson
Brooks, and halfbacks Bill Hus
ton and Rich Johnson. Johnson
may not start tomorrow, how
ever, after receiving a concus
sion against Indiana. He may
be replaced by Rich Erickson,
who is listed as a quarterback
and has played defensive half
back.
Illinois's reserve strength is
exceedingly thin beyond Erick
son and any injuries against
Stanford would definitely be
costly.
A personnel check for Stan
foid also finds several question-

able starters. Gene Washington,
although looking in fine shape
in the final quarter against USC
last weekend, still may not start
against the Illini. Chuck Wil
liams, starting in his first game
for Stanford against the Tro
jans, completed 14 out of 26
passes for 163 yards and will
definitely see action whether
Washington starts or not. End
John Mason is also ailing but
whether he plays Saturday will
probably not be decided until
right up to game time. His leg
was injured against USC and
was thought to be broken, but
was only badly bruised.

Defensively, the Illini ranks
as one of the top teams in the
Big Ten. Led oy captain Bo
Batcholder the defense held a
good Ohio State last week in
winning, 10-9. Illinois has lost
to Southern Methodist, 26-7, Mis
souri, 21-14, and second-ranked
Michigan State, 26-10.
Stanford's previous Big Ten
game was their second game of
the season against Minnesota
which the Indians lost, 35-21.
However, two conference losses
to Oregon, 7-3, and Southern
California, 21-7, have cut deeper.
Last weekend's loss to USC
was certainly one of those of
looking good but not winning.
USC scored two quick touch
downs in the first quarter and
from then on Stanford played
on even terms with the fifth
ranked Trojans.
Jack Root, who scored the
only goal against the Trojans,
leads the team in rushing with
288 yards. He scored from the
one-yard line last Saturday after
the Indians had been stopped on
three previous downs from with
in the three yard-line.
Stanford hosts the University
of Washington next waekend In
a big conference clash that will
determine Stanford's future
chances for a winning season in
the AAWU.

winning, 10-9. Illinois has lost
to Southern Methodist, 26-7, Mis
souri, 21-14, and second-ranked
Michigan State, 26-10.
Stanford's previous Big Ten
game was their second game of
the season against Minnesota
which the Indians lost, 35-21.
However, two conference losses
to Oregon, 7-3, and Southern
California, 21-7, have cut deeper.
Last weekend's loss to USC
was certainly one of those of
looking good but not winning.
USC scored two quick touch
downs in the first quarter and
from then on Stanford played
on even terms with the fifth
ranked Trojans.
Jack Root, who scored the
only goal against the Trojans,
leads the team in rushing with
288 yards. He scored from the
one-yard line last Saturday after
the Indians had been stopped on
three previous downs from with
in the three yard-line.
Stanford hosts the University
of Washington next waekend In
a big conference clash that will
determine Stanford's future
chances for a winning season in
the AAWU.

Taking on its second Big Ten
opponent this year and again
away from home, Stanford's
football team hopes it can do
more than just look good while

losing this Saturday against Il
linois.
Stanford and Illinois have
identical records. However,
Stanford comes off of two de
feats while Illinois is rolling

after two straight victories over
Ohio State and Indiana.
Both teams are also plagued
with injuries, but Illinois's seem
ed to have hit in one spot; their
backfield. This will be the sixth
starting backfield for the Illini
in six games this season. Satur
day Illinois coach Pete Elliott
will start an all-sophomore back
field comprised of quarterback
Bob Naponic, fullback Carson
Brooks, and halfbacks Bill Hus
ton and Rich Johnson. Johnson
may not start tomorrow, how
ever, after receiving a concus
sion against Indiana. He may
be replaced by Rich Erickson,
who is listed as a quarterback
and has played defensive half
back.
Illinois's reserve strength is
exceedingly thin beyond Erick
son and any injuries against
Stanford would definitely be
costly.
A personnel check for Stan
foid also finds several question-

able starters. Gene Washington,
although looking in fine shape
in the final quarter against USC
last weekend, still may not start
against the Illini. Chuck Wil
liams, starting in his first game
for Stanford against the Tro
jans, completed 14 out of 26
passes for 163 yards and will
definitely see action whether
Washington starts or not. End
John Mason is also ailing but
whether he plays Saturday will
probably not be decided until
right up to game time. His leg
was injured against USC and
was thought to be broken, but
was only badly bruised.

Defensively, the Illini ranks
as one of the top teams in the
Big Ten. Led oy captain Bo
