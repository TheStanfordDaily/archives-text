## 
### 
Stanford's varsity soccer team
goes after its second league vic
tory at the University of Cali
fornia at Davis, Saturday.
Fresh from a 3-2 triumph over
the University of the Pacific,
last Saturday, the Tribe will be
hoping for a win over Davis to
put them in a position to take
over the league lead, if San Jose
or the University of San Fran
cisco should falter.
The Spartans defeated the In
dians earlier in the year, but the
team has been improving con
stantly since then. The hooters
take on San Francisco after the
Davis game.
Coach Fred Priddle comment
ed that he thought his team had
a good chance of coming out on
top. Davis was beaten 3-1 by Pa
cific in its only previous league
game.
This season has been a frus
trating one for the Cards. The
team started off by losing what
should have been an easy game
to a surprisingly strong San
Quentin team. But learning
from from their mistakes, the
booters bounced back to polish
off Menlo Junior College and
Oregon State. A tired group of
Indians, playing their second
game of the day, could do no
better than a tie against San
Francisco City College.

The most disappointing mo
ment of the season, however,
was a 4-3 loss to San Jose.
Threatening constantly in the
last minutes of the game, the
team was unable to find the
range on the goal.

The junior varsity team also
has a game at Davis, Saturday.
The JV game will be played pre
ceding the varsity's. The team's
game against Diablo Valley,
scheduled for yesterday, was
