# INTRAMURALS
## Grad Teams Clash 
### 
A shakeup in the graduate lea
gue is due tomorrow as the four
top grad school football teams
collide in morning games.
Psychedelics - Hammerheads
(Psych. - Mech. Engineering)
and Neutrinos - Beta Biz (Phy
sics - Second - year -Business)
contests could scramble the lea
gue picture or produce two
clear-cut contenders. Best guess
is for the Psychedelics and Neu
trinos to come out unbeaten and
waiting to settle it all in their
Nov. 16 game.
Other key games tomorrow,
the last scheduled Saturday for
intromurals, match Stern un
beatens Fremont and Larkin,
and send SAE, Lambda Nu, Phi
Delt, ATO and Madera in quest
of third straight wins.
Intramural bowling completes
its second week today, with the
Rennods, the top average team
in the school, taking on SAE 11.
Volleyball and tennis continue
second-round competition, while
the third round of free throws
is scheduled for Monday.
