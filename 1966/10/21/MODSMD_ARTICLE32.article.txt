## Coffee House Controversy Stalled 
### Tim Haight 
Three weeks ago the reason
Stanford students couldn't have
a coffee house was that Dean
Joel Smith was afraid of the
drug problem. Now it's not that
we're any closer to getting a cof
fee house —it's just a different
set of explanations.
What happened? First, Dean
Smith kept communications
channels open with students and
tried to find a way to organize
the management of the coffee
house in a way that would les
sen the fear of drug traffic.
That worked. Dean Napier
and the Ecumenical Coordinat
ing Committee volunteered to
help coordinate the project. The
fear of the drug problem ceased
to be a real argument, or at
least, the real argument au
eon rant.
What's the Problem?
So where's the problem?
Three weeks ago everything was
all set. Well, now we can't have
the RBR anymore. And it looks
like only a matter of time until
the Experiment and the lIR and
A Phi O find out that they won't
he allowed much, if any, time in
the building, either.
According to James Thurber,
Assistant to the Vice-President
and Provost (sic), the Counsel
ing and Testing Center will have
to be out of Encina Hall and in
to the RBR by April 15. To ac
comodate them, the RBR will
have to be remodeled, and that
must start no later than Febru
ary 15. At last estimate the tar
get date for having the current
library out of the RBR is No
vember 15. That leaves three
month. Hooray!
Remodeling the RBR to be
come a coffee house would re
quire some plumbing changes
and so on that would cost sev
eral hundred dollars at least.
That means an expensive three
months. Too expensive.
Now Where?
Well, what about other places
on campus? Aside from the fact
that this was the question we
were asking last May, this seems
to be a logical approach. It
doesn't look good. Relations
with the Women's Club House
people are tenuous, the I-Center
is busy and small, the museum
is far away, and sc on ad nau
seam. Anyone who has been
trying for the last four or five
years to get a coffee house has
heard this song before.
About this time we begin to
wonder if we've been had. Last
summer they said the RBR
would be vacant at least until
June 1967, now its February.
What happened?
What happened is that the
money came through for the re
modeling of Encina sooner than
expected, so the time schedule
was advanced. You see, there's
a lot of pressure to make this
move.
When Encina is remodeled, the
Food Research Institute is go
ing to move in. When the FRI
moves in to Encina, Humanities

and Sciences will take its va
cated space on Quad. More room
for everybody.
Except students.
Ladder of Priorities
What this all illustrates is
just where something of direct
value to students stands on the
ladder of priorities in the Uni
versity. It is more important
that the various departments
have more space than that the
students have a place where a
much-needed type of learning
and development might go on.
Who knows whether the real
gain to the University of a cof
fee house's presence would be
greater or less than some aca
demic elbow room? It is doubt
ful the question has really been
asked, at least at the level where
the decisions are made.
Like most politics, it isn't what
you say as much as who you are
that seems to count. Only when
the basis for discussion is equal
ity will the issues be examined.
And equality is determined by
power.
This may seem like the old

confrontation song. It is. It goes,
"Your acts speak so loud I can
not hear what you say." Ask
yourself who the initiators are
in the administration who are
going to bat for the coffee house.
They're not the men making the
decisions.
Merry-Go-Round
It's not Joel Smith's fault and
it's not Robert Hind's fault, and
it's nowhere near Dean Napier's
fault. He's the most able friend
the student has had here in a
decade. (It's lucky he has God
on his side.) These men are OK.
Nobody knows who the bad
dies are, if they even exist. The
buck never stops. One methodo
logical approach, however. A
decision to set the time schedule
back to June would probably
come out of a meeting including
President Sterling and Vice-
Presidents Brooks, Creighton,
and Cuthbertson. They are the
poor souls who have to balance
the pressures and make the de
cision. May the pressure not all
be from the people who need
more space.

summer they said the RBR
would be vacant at least until
June 1967, now its February.
What happened?
What happened is that the
money came through for the re
modeling of Encina sooner than
expected, so the time schedule
was advanced. You see, there's
a lot of pressure to make this
move.
When Encina is remodeled, the
Food Research Institute is go
ing to move in. When the FRI
moves in to Encina, Humanities

and Sciences will take its va
cated space on Quad. More room
for everybody.
Except students.
Ladder of Priorities
What this all illustrates is
just where something of direct
value to students stands on the
ladder of priorities in the Uni
versity. It is more important
that the various departments
have more space than that the
students have a place where a
much-needed type of learning
and development might go on.
Who knows whether the real
gain to the University of a cof
fee house's presence would be
greater or less than some aca
demic elbow room? It is doubt
ful the question has really been
asked, at least at the level where
the decisions are made.
Like most politics, it isn't what
you say as much as who you are
that seems to count. Only when
the basis for discussion is equal
ity will the issues be examined.
And equality is determined by
power.
This may seem like the old

confrontation song. It is. It goes,
"Your acts speak so loud I can
not hear what you say." Ask
yourself who the initiators are
in the administration who are
going to bat for the coffee house.
They're not the men making the
decisions.
Merry-Go-Round
It's not Joel Smith's fault and
it's not Robert Hind's fault, and
it's nowhere near Dean Napier's
fault. He's the most able friend
the student has had here in a
decade. (It's lucky he has God
on his side.) These men are OK.
Nobody knows who the bad
dies are, if they even exist. The
buck never stops. One methodo
logical approach, however. A
decision to set the time schedule
back to June would probably
come out of a meeting including
President Sterling and Vice-
Presidents Brooks, Creighton,
and Cuthbertson. They are the
poor souls who have to balance
the pressures and make the de
cision. May the pressure not all
be from the people who need
more space.
Three weeks ago the reason
Stanford students couldn't have
a coffee house was that Dean
Joel Smith was afraid of the
drug problem. Now it's not that
we're any closer to getting a cof
fee house —it's just a different
set of explanations.
What happened? First, Dean
Smith kept communications
channels open with students and
tried to find a way to organize
the management of the coffee
house in a way that would les
sen the fear of drug traffic.
That worked. Dean Napier
and the Ecumenical Coordinat
ing Committee volunteered to
help coordinate the project. The
fear of the drug problem ceased
to be a real argument, or at
least, the real argument au
eon rant.
What's the Problem?
So where's the problem?
Three weeks ago everything was
all set. Well, now we can't have
the RBR anymore. And it looks
like only a matter of time until
the Experiment and the lIR and
A Phi O find out that they won't
he allowed much, if any, time in
the building, either.
According to James Thurber,
Assistant to the Vice-President
and Provost (sic), the Counsel
ing and Testing Center will have
to be out of Encina Hall and in
to the RBR by April 15. To ac
comodate them, the RBR will
have to be remodeled, and that
must start no later than Febru
ary 15. At last estimate the tar
get date for having the current
library out of the RBR is No
vember 15. That leaves three
month. Hooray!
Remodeling the RBR to be
come a coffee house would re
quire some plumbing changes
and so on that would cost sev
eral hundred dollars at least.
That means an expensive three
months. Too expensive.
Now Where?
Well, what about other places
on campus? Aside from the fact
that this was the question we
were asking last May, this seems
to be a logical approach. It
doesn't look good. Relations
with the Women's Club House
people are tenuous, the I-Center
is busy and small, the museum
is far away, and sc on ad nau
seam. Anyone who has been
trying for the last four or five
years to get a coffee house has
heard this song before.

cision. May the pressure not all
be from the people who need
more space.
Three weeks ago the reason
Stanford students couldn't have
a coffee house was that Dean
Joel Smith was afraid of the
drug problem. Now it's not that
we're any closer to getting a cof
fee house —it's just a different
set of explanations.
What happened? First, Dean
Smith kept communications
channels open with students and
tried to find a way to organize
the management of the coffee
house in a way that would les
sen the fear of drug traffic.
That worked. Dean Napier
and the Ecumenical Coordinat
ing Committee volunteered to
help coordinate the project. The
fear of the drug problem ceased
to be a real argument, or at
least, the real argument au
eon rant.
What's the Problem?
So where's the problem?
Three weeks ago everything was
all set. Well, now we can't have
the RBR anymore. And it looks
like only a matter of time until
the Experiment and the lIR and
A Phi O find out that they won't
he allowed much, if any, time in
the building, either.
According to James Thurber,
Assistant to the Vice-President
and Provost (sic), the Counsel
ing and Testing Center will have
to be out of Encina Hall and in
to the RBR by April 15. To ac
comodate them, the RBR will
have to be remodeled, and that
must start no later than Febru
ary 15. At last estimate the tar
get date for having the current
library out of the RBR is No
vember 15. That leaves three
month. Hooray!
Remodeling the RBR to be
come a coffee house would re
quire some plumbing changes
and so on that would cost sev
eral hundred dollars at least.
That means an expensive three
months. Too expensive.
Now Where?
Well, what about other places
on campus? Aside from the fact
that this was the question we
were asking last May, this seems
to be a logical approach. It
doesn't look good. Relations
with the Women's Club House
people are tenuous, the I-Center
is busy and small, the museum
is far away, and sc on ad nau
seam. Anyone who has been
trying for the last four or five
years to get a coffee house has
heard this song before.
About this time we begin to
wonder if we've been had. Last
summer they said the RBR
would be vacant at least until
June 1967, now its February.
What happened?
What happened is that the
money came through for the re
modeling of Encina sooner than
expected, so the time schedule
was advanced. You see, there's
a lot of pressure to make this
move.
When Encina is remodeled, the
Food Research Institute is go
ing to move in. When the FRI
moves in to Encina, Humanities

and Sciences will take its va
cated space on Quad. More room
for everybody.
Except students.
Ladder of Priorities
What this all illustrates is
just where something of direct
value to students stands on the
ladder of priorities in the Uni
versity. It is more important
that the various departments
have more space than that the
students have a place where a
much-needed type of learning
and development might go on.
Who knows whether the real
gain to the University of a cof
fee house's presence would be
greater or less than some aca
demic elbow room? It is doubt
ful the question has really been
asked, at least at the level where
the decisions are made.
Like most politics, it isn't what
you say as much as who you are
that seems to count. Only when
the basis for discussion is equal
ity will the issues be examined.
And equality is determined by
power.
This may seem like the old

confrontation song. It is. It goes,
"Your acts speak so loud I can
not hear what you say." Ask
yourself who the initiators are
in the administration who are
going to bat for the coffee house.
They're not the men making the
decisions.
Merry-Go-Round
It's not Joel Smith's fault and
it's not Robert Hind's fault, and
it's nowhere near Dean Napier's
fault. He's the most able friend
the student has had here in a
decade. (It's lucky he has God
on his side.) These men are OK.
Nobody knows who the bad
dies are, if they even exist. The
buck never stops. One methodo
logical approach, however. A
decision to set the time schedule
back to June would probably
come out of a meeting including
President Sterling and Vice-
Presidents Brooks, Creighton,
and Cuthbertson. They are the
poor souls who have to balance
the pressures and make the de
cision. May the pressure not all
be from the people who need
more space.
