## Johnson's Far East Tour – Attempt At Good Politics? 
### William F. Buckley, Jr 
Messrs. Novak and Evans
have written a very interesting
book (Lydon Johnson: The Ex
ercise of Power) an observation
in which is that our President is
probably the most highly devel
oped power-accumulator in the
history of the Presidency, that
he has a way, like a hidden leaf
in a jungle, of angling towards
the filament of sun that breaks
through the overhead clutter,
and photosynthesizing it into —
power. Johnson's power-orienta
tion has accordingly had the ef
fect of turning most of the dis
cussion of his upcoming trip to
the Far East to the trip's rela
tion to domestic politics.
The Vietnam war, Messrs. No
vak and Evans write, has tested
Johnson's political resources be
yond the limits of his ingenuity,
or at least that was their judg
ment when they finished their
book early in the summer. The
question now arises, is Johnson
by going to Asia, ready to pro
duce a Happening that will ex
tricate him, and his fellow Dem
ocrats, from the difficulties of
the Vietnam war?
Good Politics
Those who examine the trip
and the itinerary looking for
clues, might agree on the sig
nificance of several points:
1) No urbane man will as
sume that the timing of the trip
is unrelated to domestic politics.
The President will be gone dur
ing the two or three most vital
weeks of the campaign. Given
the priorities in Mr. Johnson's
life, it is safe to assume that he
is primarily engaged in making
good politics, rather than crack
ing the Vietnam dilemma,
though of course to do the lat
ter could affect the former.
What stands out is that Mr.
Johnson, upon due reflection, ap
parently reasons that he would
more greatly benefit the Demo
cratic Party outside the country,

than in it, during this period.
2) Why? Some say because,
by going to the Far' East, the
whole Vietnam business will be
put in abeyance in the voters'
mind, permitting Democratic
candidates to move to the fore
ground the domestic policies
and achievements of the Great
Society, concerning which, it is
assumed, there is a considerable
public enthusiasm.
Another factor is the increas
ingly awkward shadow of Ro
bert Kennedy. Kennedy has
been going around the country
like Ceasar back from Gaul,
marching triumphantly in the
outskirt cities, causing the Capi
tal to quake with fear. How can
LBJ campaign, at Hicksville,
when Bobby's managers could
quickly contrive a subsequent
appearance by Bobby which
would outshine the President's
by the density of the crowds
and the thundering of the ap
plause? Yet how avoid invita
tions to speak for local candi
dates if the President is in this
country?
3) Concerning possible
achievements in Asia, the only
achievement of any major con
sequence would be the devolu
tion of responsibility for the
ghting in Vietnam to Asians —
who should have accepted the
responsibility from the begin
ning. But the likelihood is dim,
at this point in the struggle,
that Johnson could succeed, for
instance, in persuading Japan
to send troops, or Vietnam to
receive Japanese troops. The
pointed snub of Taiwan—(John
son has not included in his
itinerary our closest friend in
the Southeast after the Philip
pines) — reflects the ancient,
superstitious fear of a working
military alliance with the single
country in the area that is gung
ho to do something about Red
China.

military alliance with the single
country in the area that is gung
ho to do something about Red
China.
Messrs. Novak and Evans
have written a very interesting
book (Lydon Johnson: The Ex
ercise of Power) an observation
in which is that our President is
probably the most highly devel
oped power-accumulator in the
history of the Presidency, that
he has a way, like a hidden leaf
in a jungle, of angling towards
the filament of sun that breaks
through the overhead clutter,
and photosynthesizing it into —
power. Johnson's power-orienta
tion has accordingly had the ef
fect of turning most of the dis
cussion of his upcoming trip to
the Far East to the trip's rela
tion to domestic politics.
The Vietnam war, Messrs. No
vak and Evans write, has tested
Johnson's political resources be
yond the limits of his ingenuity,
or at least that was their judg
ment when they finished their
book early in the summer. The
question now arises, is Johnson
by going to Asia, ready to pro
duce a Happening that will ex
tricate him, and his fellow Dem
ocrats, from the difficulties of
the Vietnam war?
Good Politics
Those who examine the trip
and the itinerary looking for
clues, might agree on the sig
nificance of several points:
1) No urbane man will as
sume that the timing of the trip
is unrelated to domestic politics.
The President will be gone dur
ing the two or three most vital
weeks of the campaign. Given
the priorities in Mr. Johnson's
life, it is safe to assume that he
is primarily engaged in making
good politics, rather than crack
ing the Vietnam dilemma,
though of course to do the lat
ter could affect the former.
What stands out is that Mr.
Johnson, upon due reflection, ap
parently reasons that he would
more greatly benefit the Demo
cratic Party outside the country,

than in it, during this period.
2) Why? Some say because,
by going to the Far' East, the
whole Vietnam business will be
put in abeyance in the voters'
mind, permitting Democratic
candidates to move to the fore
ground the domestic policies
and achievements of the Great
Society, concerning which, it is
assumed, there is a considerable
public enthusiasm.
Another factor is the increas
ingly awkward shadow of Ro
bert Kennedy. Kennedy has
been going around the country
like Ceasar back from Gaul,
marching triumphantly in the
outskirt cities, causing the Capi
tal to quake with fear. How can
LBJ campaign, at Hicksville,
when Bobby's managers could
quickly contrive a subsequent
appearance by Bobby which
would outshine the President's
by the density of the crowds
and the thundering of the ap
plause? Yet how avoid invita
tions to speak for local candi
dates if the President is in this
country?
3) Concerning possible
achievements in Asia, the only
achievement of any major con
sequence would be the devolu
tion of responsibility for the
ghting in Vietnam to Asians —
who should have accepted the
responsibility from the begin
ning. But the likelihood is dim,
at this point in the struggle,
that Johnson could succeed, for
instance, in persuading Japan
to send troops, or Vietnam to
receive Japanese troops. The
pointed snub of Taiwan—(John
son has not included in his
itinerary our closest friend in
the Southeast after the Philip
pines) — reflects the ancient,
superstitious fear of a working
military alliance with the single
country in the area that is gung
ho to do something about Red
China.
