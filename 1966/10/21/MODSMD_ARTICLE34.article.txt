## Hypocrisy Of War Machine 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
President Johnson has just in
voked the Taft-Hartley Act to
prevent a strike at General Elec
tric plants across the country be
cause the strike would have
stopped production of materials
needed to fight the Vietnamese,
Phantom jets in particular.
Yet General Electric takes 1/3
page to advertise in the October
18 Daily that they, like the Peace
Corps "are trying to make life
more livable." GE subtly sug
gests that its own nature is
comparable to that of the Peace
Corps.
Perhaps Bob Haas's contro
versial letter was deserving of
criticism because it was not spe
cific enough; but the contradic
tion here is specific: GE's pro
duction of materials that brings
death is so essential that a strike
would hurt the "war effort"; yet
the rhetoric that GE, a symbol
of business, uses to recruit mem
bers of the university commu
nity speaks of making life more
livable. Whose life? At whose ex
pense? The life of the American
soldier, perhaps; but certainly
not the life of the Vietnamese he
kills.
GE was not going to strike be
cause its workers didn't want
their products to aid in the de
struction of Vietnam, but be
cause they wanted more for
themselves. I know of no in
stances in this country when the
employees or management of a
plant stopped production because
its products were being used in a
way they deemed immoral. I

don't know that this is traceable
to "business" as a system, and
it is silly to think that govern
ment ownership would allow
workers to decide what they
would produce and how it would
be used. But I can see that as
things are now, the more at
home always takes precedence
over the better for other coun
tries, unless the better for other
countries is betterkill. In which
case, as we know, more educa
tion funds and more poverty
funds are spent on better war.
If it is not the system that's
at fault, perhaps it is each single
person who decides that life
must go on here even if it ends
in Southeast Asia. But what pro
duces the single person who so
decides? The system? Or do the
persons produce the system?
Who is it really who is making
death materials and saying he is
making life more livable? Where
is it that people learn how to
create a favorable image for an
institution — in theory — regard
less of the relationship of that
image to what the institution is
actually doing?
In Redwood City there are still
men filling bombshells with na
palm, and their thoughts about
their company, United Technol
ogy Center, probably center on
pension plans and vacation pay
rather than on flaming human
beings. Is this the fault of busi
ness, business schools? Where
does this emphasis originate?
Maybe a business school could
suggest that executives start
seminars for all employees to

discuss questions such as "What
is the value of the work I do?"
"'How do I help make life more
livable for those other than my
family?" "What is my relation
ship to the Negroes I see turned
away by our personnel office?"
Could a business say "You
should only work here if you be
lieve that what we do is impor
tant to ending hatred and bring
ing a tolerable life to people all
over the world"? How would
a man bolting an ornament to
a Sting Ray hood justify his
labor? Can business afford to
have him desire to justify his
labor? Could Wall Street survive
if 100,000 autoworkers joined the
Peace Corps? Would our system
be viable if each worker in
sisted on doing something he
judged worthwhile?
For those in the business
school or any place else who are
incensed or baffled by my letter,
who think I have abused logic,
I suggest a trip—but not into a
private dreamworld. First, go to
the shopping center. There you
will see the realization of the
present system: a staggering
affluence that now depends on
making you covet countless
things you have no need for,
making you think happiness is
a pair of hip-huggers, masculin
ity is a Mercury, womanhood is
a paddel bra, love depends on a
new lipstick, marriage means
Lennox, death is divine in a
damask casket.
Then go to the bookstore.
There you will find Felix
Greene's VIETNAM! VlET

NAM! Please write your reply
after you have seen the massive
helicopters, guns, tanks, ranks
of American soldiers making life
more livable for people starving,
dressed in rags, and only occa
sionally possessed of rifles.

Editor, The Daily:
I must take exception to Steve
Gruber's coverage of Mr. Alan
Cranston's talk last Tuesday. He
took one comment ,the only de
rogatory comment, and made it
seem as though this comment
were the major point in his talk.
This was not the case. Mr. Crans
ton in fact had nothing but
praise for the Governor's poli
cies. He only stated that Gov
ernor Brown was a poor poli
tician in that he did not cam
paign well. Mr. Gruber took this
one statement and blew it up so
that it made both Governor
Brown and Mr. Cranston look
bad. This article was more of an
editorial than a report of what
happened. It belonged on the
editorial page.
Mr. Gruber was mixing fact
with opinion, which is unpardon
able in newspaper reporting. I
am aware of the fact that the
Stanford campus and The Daily
In particular are conservatively
oriented, but I do not think
that these views should be re
flected in news stories.

I must take exception to Steve
Gruber's coverage of Mr. Alan
Cranston's talk last Tuesday. He
took one comment ,the only de
rogatory comment, and made it
seem as though this comment
were the major point in his talk.
This was not the case. Mr. Crans
ton in fact had nothing but
praise for the Governor's poli
cies. He only stated that Gov
ernor Brown was a poor poli
tician in that he did not cam
paign well. Mr. Gruber took this
one statement and blew it up so
that it made both Governor
Brown and Mr. Cranston look
bad. This article was more of an
editorial than a report of what
happened. It belonged on the
editorial page.
Mr. Gruber was mixing fact
with opinion, which is unpardon
able in newspaper reporting. I
am aware of the fact that the
Stanford campus and The Daily
In particular are conservatively
oriented, but I do not think
that these views should be re
flected in news stories.

Editor, The Daily:
President Johnson has just in
voked the Taft-Hartley Act to
prevent a strike at General Elec
tric plants across the country be
cause the strike would have
stopped production of materials
needed to fight the Vietnamese,
Phantom jets in particular.
Yet General Electric takes 1/3
page to advertise in the October
18 Daily that they, like the Peace
Corps "are trying to make life
more livable." GE subtly sug
gests that its own nature is
comparable to that of the Peace
Corps.
Perhaps Bob Haas's contro
versial letter was deserving of
criticism because it was not spe
cific enough; but the contradic
tion here is specific: GE's pro
duction of materials that brings
death is so essential that a strike
would hurt the "war effort"; yet
the rhetoric that GE, a symbol
of business, uses to recruit mem
bers of the university commu
nity speaks of making life more
livable. Whose life? At whose ex
pense? The life of the American
soldier, perhaps; but certainly
not the life of the Vietnamese he
kills.
GE was not going to strike be
cause its workers didn't want
their products to aid in the de
struction of Vietnam, but be
cause they wanted more for
themselves. I know of no in
stances in this country when the
employees or management of a
plant stopped production because
its products were being used in a
way they deemed immoral. I

don't know that this is traceable
to "business" as a system, and
it is silly to think that govern
ment ownership would allow
workers to decide what they
would produce and how it would
be used. But I can see that as
things are now, the more at
home always takes precedence
over the better for other coun
tries, unless the better for other
countries is betterkill. In which
case, as we know, more educa
tion funds and more poverty
funds are spent on better war.
If it is not the system that's
at fault, perhaps it is each single
person who decides that life
must go on here even if it ends
in Southeast Asia. But what pro
duces the single person who so
decides? The system? Or do the
persons produce the system?
Who is it really who is making
death materials and saying he is
making life more livable? Where
is it that people learn how to
create a favorable image for an
institution — in theory — regard
less of the relationship of that
image to what the institution is
actually doing?
In Redwood City there are still
men filling bombshells with na
palm, and their thoughts about
their company, United Technol
ogy Center, probably center on
pension plans and vacation pay
rather than on flaming human
beings. Is this the fault of busi
ness, business schools? Where
does this emphasis originate?
Maybe a business school could

President Johnson has just in
voked the Taft-Hartley Act to
prevent a strike at General Elec
tric plants across the country be
cause the strike would have
stopped production of materials
needed to fight the Vietnamese,
Phantom jets in particular.
Yet General Electric takes 1/3
page to advertise in the October
18 Daily that they, like the Peace
Corps "are trying to make life
more livable." GE subtly sug
gests that its own nature is
comparable to that of the Peace
Corps.
Perhaps Bob Haas's contro
versial letter was deserving of
criticism because it was not spe
cific enough; but the contradic
tion here is specific: GE's pro
duction of materials that brings
death is so essential that a strike
would hurt the "war effort"; yet
the rhetoric that GE, a symbol
of business, uses to recruit mem
bers of the university commu
nity speaks of making life more
livable. Whose life? At whose ex
pense? The life of the American
soldier, perhaps; but certainly
not the life of the Vietnamese he
kills.
GE was not going to strike be
cause its workers didn't want
their products to aid in the de
struction of Vietnam, but be
cause they wanted more for
themselves. I know of no in
stances in this country when the
employees or management of a
plant stopped production because
its products were being used in a
way they deemed immoral. I

don't know that this is traceable
to "business" as a system, and
it is silly to think that govern
ment ownership would allow
workers to decide what they
would produce and how it would
be used. But I can see that as
things are now, the more at
home always takes precedence
over the better for other coun
tries, unless the better for other
countries is betterkill. In which
case, as we know, more educa
tion funds and more poverty
funds are spent on better war.
If it is not the system that's
at fault, perhaps it is each single
person who decides that life
must go on here even if it ends
in Southeast Asia. But what pro
duces the single person who so
decides? The system? Or do the
persons produce the system?
Who is it really who is making
death materials and saying he is
making life more livable? Where
is it that people learn how to
create a favorable image for an
institution — in theory — regard
less of the relationship of that
image to what the institution is
actually doing?
In Redwood City there are still
men filling bombshells with na
palm, and their thoughts about
their company, United Technol
ogy Center, probably center on
pension plans and vacation pay
rather than on flaming human
beings. Is this the fault of busi
ness, business schools? Where
does this emphasis originate?
Maybe a business school could
suggest that executives start
seminars for all employees to

discuss questions such as "What
is the value of the work I do?"
"'How do I help make life more
livable for those other than my
family?" "What is my relation
ship to the Negroes I see turned
away by our personnel office?"
Could a business say "You
should only work here if you be
lieve that what we do is impor
tant to ending hatred and bring
ing a tolerable life to people all
over the world"? How would
a man bolting an ornament to
a Sting Ray hood justify his
labor? Can business afford to
have him desire to justify his
labor? Could Wall Street survive
if 100,000 autoworkers joined the
Peace Corps? Would our system
be viable if each worker in
sisted on doing something he
judged worthwhile?
For those in the business
school or any place else who are
incensed or baffled by my letter,
who think I have abused logic,
I suggest a trip—but not into a
private dreamworld. First, go to
the shopping center. There you
will see the realization of the
present system: a staggering
affluence that now depends on
making you covet countless
things you have no need for,
making you think happiness is
a pair of hip-huggers, masculin
ity is a Mercury, womanhood is
a paddel bra, love depends on a
new lipstick, marriage means
Lennox, death is divine in a
damask casket.
Then go to the bookstore.

I must take exception to Steve
Gruber's coverage of Mr. Alan

took one comment ,the only de
rogatory comment, and made it
seem as though this comment
were the major point in his talk.
This was not the case. Mr. Crans

praise for the Governor's poli

tician in that he did not cam
paign well. Mr. Gruber took this
one statement and blew it up so
that it made both Governor
Brown and Mr. Cranston look
bad. This article was more of an

Mr. Gruber was mixing fact
