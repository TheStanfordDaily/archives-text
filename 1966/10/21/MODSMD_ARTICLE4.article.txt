# Phi Delts Highjack 11,000 Dailies; Civil Suit For Damages Possible
## 
### KIRK HANEN Associate Editor 
An estimated 11,000 copies of yes
terday's Daily were taken from cam
pus distribution points by members of
Phi Delta Theta fraternity.
The papers were taken between
5:30 and 6:30 a.m. after being distri
buted by Daily newsboys.
Managing Editor Kirk Hanson no
tified Deans Joel Smith and John Han
son of the theft shortly after 10 a.m.
Both assured him that Phi Delta

Theta would be forced to redistribute
the papers.
Officials of Phi Delta Theta ad
mitted that their fraternity's mem
bers had taken the papers, but could
not agree on a motive.
Contacted at noon, house president
Dave Oswald told The Daily, "I think
they were running a paper drive.
They needed to make papier-mache
for Homecoming decorations."
Later in the afternoon, an unidenti
fied house member told The Dally

that "it was all part of an experiment
being conducted by six of our psycho
logy majors. They were trying to
measure people's ingrained responses
to being denied their Daily in the
morning."
The source indicated that the ex
periment was sanctioned by members
of the Stanford psychology depart
ment. Officials of the department
denied any knowledge of such a pro
ject.
Pledge Prank
Phi Delta Theta's Resident Assis
tant, Pat Sainsbury, described the
theft as "probably a pledge prank,"
but had no other knowledge of the
situation.
Daily Business Manager Jack Blum
enstein estimated the costs involved
in the production of the Dailies in
question at $1600. He reported that
several complaints had been regis
tered by advertisers when the papers
were late in reaching their destina
tions.
Civil Suit
Operations Manager Jay Johnson
said The Daily would "hold off a civil
suit or other action against Phi Delta
Theta until Friday's conferences with
the deans in charge."
Dean John E. Hanson said the mat
ter would be referred to Judicial
Council when charges were pressed,
but that the Dean's Office had no
precedent to follow in this case.
Johnson added that if any adver
tisers balked at paying for their ad
space due to Ihe delay involved, The
Daily would hold Phi Delta Theta
legally responsible. At least one ad
vertiser has already complained.
