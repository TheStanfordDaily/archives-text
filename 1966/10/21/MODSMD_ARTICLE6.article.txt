# LASSU Rejects Handke's Nomination To Committee
## 
### BARBARA WARREN 
The controversial nomination of
Jan Handke as a member of the Com
mittee of Fifteen was rejected by a
vote of 40 to 38 last night at LASSU.
Martin Gerry also reported the
Committee of Fifteen's action on the
Open Hours question. Although the
final draft has not been completed,
members voted ten to four to accept
a standard even more liberal than
that requested by LASSU.
The standard set hours on week
nights at midnight and 2:30 a.m. on
weekend nights for all non-Freshman
housing. By a vote of over 50 per cent
of the members of a living group this
guideline could be restricted.
By a vote of 75 per cent, the living
group could adopt hours more liberal,
conceivably doing away with all re
gulations.
Gerry told the Legislature: "One
of the unique features of the meeting
was that the final policy agreed upon
arose from intelligent discussion of
the issues rather than as a negotiated
settlement based upon preconceived
ideas."
In resubmitting Miss Handke's
name for the Committee of Fifteen,

Harris expressed the view that
LASSU was playing "petty little pol
itical games. The objections I heard
last week," he said, "have nothing to
do with Jan Handke's qualifications."
Harris urged that the Legislature
assume the role of taking initiative
toward change in the University
rather than keeping Dave Harris in
tow."
The motion to consider Miss Han
dke's renomination was appealed on
the grounds that LASSU's vote last
week had been like any normal vote
and the issue had been decided. It
was overruled. It was argued again
this week as last, that Miss Handke's
appointment would not add to making
the delegation a representative body.
Harris expressed the opinion that
a fear of the New Left taking over
Stanford was operating within the
Legislature's concern about represen
tation. To which Harris replied that
he did not think there was such a
thing as a new left and Stanford
would be the last place the New Left
could take over."
Harris assured the Legislature, "it
is not my intention to usurp your
function."
Appropriations for the Housing
Commission was the next order of
business. The measure had been re
ferred to the Finance Committee
which reported unanimous approval
of the budget with the exception of
one item. It was brought to the at
tention of LASSU that a major addi
tion to the budget would be necessary
because a previous source of money
had been withdrawn.
Debate ensued over the possibility
of granting a blanket budget of $1000.
The motion was finally passed which
put the above sum under the control
of the Financial Manager until a new
budget is submitted within three
weeks.
Other orders of business included
approval of the Student Faculty
Boards budget. The first reading of
a resolution on reapportionment was
taken and the bill referred to rules

committee. Another resolution passed
which set up a committee to study
the Fundamental Standard.
A resolution proposing a Guaran
teed Stable Costs Plan was passed
after a few rewordings were added.

Gerry told the Legislature: "One
of the unique features of the meeting
was that the final policy agreed upon
arose from intelligent discussion of
the issues rather than as a negotiated
settlement based upon preconceived
ideas."
In resubmitting Miss Handke's
name for the Committee of Fifteen,

Harris expressed the view that
LASSU was playing "petty little pol
itical games. The objections I heard
last week," he said, "have nothing to
do with Jan Handke's qualifications."
Harris urged that the Legislature
assume the role of taking initiative
toward change in the University
rather than keeping Dave Harris in
tow."
The motion to consider Miss Han
dke's renomination was appealed on
the grounds that LASSU's vote last
week had been like any normal vote
and the issue had been decided. It
was overruled. It was argued again
this week as last, that Miss Handke's
appointment would not add to making
the delegation a representative body.
Harris expressed the opinion that
a fear of the New Left taking over
Stanford was operating within the
Legislature's concern about represen
tation. To which Harris replied that
he did not think there was such a
thing as a new left and Stanford
would be the last place the New Left
could take over."
Harris assured the Legislature, "it
is not my intention to usurp your
function."
Appropriations for the Housing
Commission was the next order of
business. The measure had been re
ferred to the Finance Committee
which reported unanimous approval
of the budget with the exception of
one item. It was brought to the at
tention of LASSU that a major addi
tion to the budget would be necessary
because a previous source of money
had been withdrawn.
Debate ensued over the possibility
of granting a blanket budget of $1000.
The motion was finally passed which
put the above sum under the control
of the Financial Manager until a new
budget is submitted within three
weeks.
Other orders of business included
approval of the Student Faculty
Boards budget. The first reading of
a resolution on reapportionment was
taken and the bill referred to rules

committee. Another resolution passed
which set up a committee to study
the Fundamental Standard.
A resolution proposing a Guaran
teed Stable Costs Plan was passed
after a few rewordings were added.
The controversial nomination of
Jan Handke as a member of the Com
mittee of Fifteen was rejected by a
vote of 40 to 38 last night at LASSU.
Martin Gerry also reported the
Committee of Fifteen's action on the
Open Hours question. Although the
final draft has not been completed,
members voted ten to four to accept
a standard even more liberal than
that requested by LASSU.
The standard set hours on week
nights at midnight and 2:30 a.m. on
weekend nights for all non-Freshman
housing. By a vote of over 50 per cent
of the members of a living group this
guideline could be restricted.
By a vote of 75 per cent, the living
group could adopt hours more liberal,
conceivably doing away with all re
gulations.
