# Thoreau And Darwin Examined By Eiseley
## 
### 
Only by leaning on both the past
and the present "can Man face the
winter of his thought," concluded
Loren C. Eiseley, Professor of Anthro
pology, at the second of his three-lec
ture series.
More than 700 gathered in Dinkel
spiel Auditorium yesterday afternoon
"dwelt on the edge of Nature."

to hear the second of the Haas Me
morial Lectures. The final one, "The
Inner Galaxy: Prelude to Space," will
be given on Sunday at 3:30 p.m. in
Memorial Church.
Speaking on "The Forfeit Paradise:
Darwin and Thoreau," Eiseley com
pared life to "a journey to the emerald
City to learn the nature of Oz."
To see Oz, each man must wear spec
tacles.
Spectacles Needed
Charles Darwin and Henry Thoreau
made a "spectacular camparison and
contrast," and "both wore spectacles of
sorts." Eiseley emphasized that if to
day man fails to look through both
pairs, his vision is completely dis
torted.
Eiseley enlarged on the similarities

and differences in the two men's lives.
Both men drew "passionate satisfac
tion from association with wilder
ness." But Darwin's passion was for
Nature and natural science. Thoreau
Darwin Vs. Thoreau
Darwin saw man in the light of the
past; Thoreau looked at man from
the "age after tomorrow." Darwin
"altered the whole conception of man's
evolution." Thoreau, on the other
hand, is known "as much for what he
implied as for what he spoke."
"Knitting together the web of life"
was Darwin's major concern, Eiseley
continued, but Thoreau was puzzled
by "the delicately woven net of human
social relations in which man is so
thoroughly enmeshed." Man, to Dar
win, was only another creature. To
Thoreau, he was a lonely individual.
Though the two followed radically
different philosophies, Eiseley said
that both had "disavowed traditional
Paradise" and that neither was "afraid
of the Universe."
Former Stanford Man
Eiseley, who was introduced as "an
imaginative, skillful writer as well as
a distinguished anthropologist," is a
former member of the University com
munity. He is the author of six books
and innumerable articles in leading
American periodicals and newspapers.
The enthusiasm with which his first
two lecutres were received has made
it necessary to hold the last lecture
in Memorial Church instead of Cubber
ley Auditorium in order to accommo
date the over-flow crowd.

the "age after tomorrow." Darwin
"altered the whole conception of man's
evolution." Thoreau, on the other
hand, is known "as much for what he
implied as for what he spoke."
"Knitting together the web of life"
was Darwin's major concern, Eiseley
continued, but Thoreau was puzzled
by "the delicately woven net of human
social relations in which man is so
thoroughly enmeshed." Man, to Dar
win, was only another creature. To
Thoreau, he was a lonely individual.
Though the two followed radically
different philosophies, Eiseley said
that both had "disavowed traditional
Paradise" and that neither was "afraid
of the Universe."

Eiseley, who was introduced as "an
imaginative, skillful writer as well as
a distinguished anthropologist," is a
former member of the University com
munity. He is the author of six books
and innumerable articles in leading
American periodicals and newspapers.
The enthusiasm with which his first
two lecutres were received has made
it necessary to hold the last lecture
in Memorial Church instead of Cubber

date the over-flow crowd.

Only by leaning on both the past
and the present "can Man face the
winter of his thought," concluded
Loren C. Eiseley, Professor of Anthro
pology, at the second of his three-lec
ture series.
More than 700 gathered in Dinkel
spiel Auditorium yesterday afternoon
"dwelt on the edge of Nature."

to hear the second of the Haas Me
morial Lectures. The final one, "The
Inner Galaxy: Prelude to Space," will
be given on Sunday at 3:30 p.m. in
Memorial Church.
Speaking on "The Forfeit Paradise:
Darwin and Thoreau," Eiseley com
pared life to "a journey to the emerald
City to learn the nature of Oz."
To see Oz, each man must wear spec
tacles.
Spectacles Needed
Charles Darwin and Henry Thoreau
made a "spectacular camparison and
contrast," and "both wore spectacles of
sorts." Eiseley emphasized that if to
day man fails to look through both
pairs, his vision is completely dis
torted.
Eiseley enlarged on the similarities

and differences in the two men's lives.
Both men drew "passionate satisfac
tion from association with wilder
ness." But Darwin's passion was for
Nature and natural science. Thoreau
