# Campus Reaction To Harris Attack Varies
## Survey Reveals Student Reactions; Harris' Haircut Seen As 'Serious' 
### STEVE GRUBER 
The campus generally considers
the David Harris haircut hassle a
"serious" incident, according to a
special Daily poll taken yesterday.
One hundred persons were asked
their opinions in a survey conducted
by telephone and by personal inter
views. All of the dormitories were in
cluded, along with most of the frater
nities and women's row houses.
Only 23 percent of those questioned
thought the haircutting was "humor
ous." But 60 percent felt that it was
serious. Slightly under a fifth of the
students, 17 percent, made no direct
response.
The Question
The poll centered around one ques
tion, "Do you think the Delts' action
last Thursday night, when they cut
off David Harris' hair, should be con
sidered serious or humorous."
Respondents were also allowed to
comment on the Harris haircut itself.
The comments ranged from"It was a
terrible thing to do" to "It was fairly
funny."
One student who was interviewed in
Tresidder said, "If they reprimand
those guys, I'll help them cut off the
rest of it."
Another student in Tresidder com
mented, "The haircut was tantamont
to symbolic castration."
FacLst
"It's humorous in that it happened,
but it does point out a basic feature
of fraternity life which is fascist," a
resident of Crothers Memorial Hall
told The Daily.
A Lagunita girl claimed, "I'm not

sure that they can excuse themselves
by saying that it's a little joke."
A student polled by telephone in
Stern Hall refused to answer the
question, but did say, "I don't think
it has any significance at all, it was a
fairly spontaneous action."
Humorous
Another Stern resident said that if
the Delts actually performed the hair
cut, then it should be regarded as
humorous. "When the boys get to
gether, they seem to want to do some
thing along the line," he said.
The girl who answered the phone at
Hurlburt House, where Harris was
waylayed, commented, "The general
conclusion of the house is that it's a
terrible thing to do."
"It's an indication of something
much more serious," said a respon
dent at Jordan house.
InabiUty
A member of Theta Xi said that the
incident was "a poor showing of an
inability to verbalize their objections
to Harris. I don't know whether they
think that Harris is a serious threat
to their existence or not, but they
probably thought it was humorous."
A Delta Chi member, who responded
that the haircut was humorous, com
mented, "Dave didn't show too much
cool when he got all flustered. The
Delts didn't show too much cool in
doing it. The campus should have
taken it with a grain of salt. It was
done, and it was funny."
Selective Living:
"I believe in the merits of selective
living," a Phi Kappa Sigma member
said, "but I don't think that the fra

ternities should be a breeding place
for collective immaturity."
"They meant it as a poke, sort of,"
a Florence Moore girl told The Daily.
"Personally, I think it was pitiful. I
take it seriously, but the whole matter
depends on whether the guys take it
seriously."
A Roble resident said, "I just think
he's the most; nothing they can do to
him can change his image."
"My Parents"
"I talked to my parents about it and
they thought it was funny," another
Roble girl said.
"It was an infringement of personal
rights," according to a third Roble
girl.
The poll was designed to take a
cross-section of the campus to prevent
over-representation of any one group.
The interviews were taken according
to the following plan: Tresidder Un
ion, 26; fraternities, 17; Wilbur Hall,
10; Roble Hall, 5; Branner Hall, 4;
Florence Moore, 9; Stern Hall, 8;
Crothers Memorial and Crothers
Halls, 7; Lagunita Court, 5; women's
row houses, 5; and Toyon Hall, 4 in

A member of Theta Xi said that the
incident was "a poor showing of an
inability to verbalize their objections
to Harris. I don't know whether they
think that Harris is a serious threat
to their existence or not, but they
probably thought it was humorous."
A Delta Chi member, who responded
that the haircut was humorous, com
mented, "Dave didn't show too much
cool when he got all flustered. The
Delts didn't show too much cool in
doing it. The campus should have
taken it with a grain of salt. It was
done, and it was funny."

"I believe in the merits of selective

"They meant it as a poke, sort of,"
a Florence Moore girl told The Daily.
"Personally, I think it was pitiful. I
take it seriously, but the whole matter
depends on whether the guys take it
seriously."
A Roble resident said, "I just think
he's the most; nothing they can do to
him can change his image."
"My Parents"
"I talked to my parents about it and
they thought it was funny," another
Roble girl said.
"It was an infringement of personal

One hundred persons were asked
their opinions in a survey conducted
by telephone and by personal inter

cluded, along with most of the frater
nities and women's row houses.
Only 23 percent of those questioned
thought the haircutting was "humor

serious. Slightly under a fifth of the
students, 17 percent, made no direct
response.
The Question
The poll centered around one ques

last Thursday night, when they cut
off David Harris' hair, should be con
sidered serious or humorous."
Respondents were also allowed to
comment on the Harris haircut itself.
The comments ranged from"It was a
terrible thing to do" to "It was fairly
funny."
One student who was interviewed in
Tresidder said, "If they reprimand
those guys, I'll help them cut off the
rest of it."
Another student in Tresidder com
mented, "The haircut was tantamont
to symbolic castration."

by saying that it's a little joke."

it has any significance at all, it was a
fairly spontaneous action."
Humorous
Another Stern resident said that if
the Delts actually performed the hair
cut, then it should be regarded as
humorous. "When the boys get to
gether, they seem to want to do some

views. All of the dormitories were in
cluded, along with most of the frater
nities and women's row houses.
Only 23 percent of those questioned
thought the haircutting was "humor
ous." But 60 percent felt that it was
serious. Slightly under a fifth of the
students, 17 percent, made no direct
response.
The Question
The poll centered around one ques
tion, "Do you think the Delts' action
last Thursday night, when they cut
off David Harris' hair, should be con
sidered serious or humorous."
Respondents were also allowed to
comment on the Harris haircut itself.
The comments ranged from"It was a
terrible thing to do" to "It was fairly
funny."
One student who was interviewed in
Tresidder said, "If they reprimand
those guys, I'll help them cut off the
rest of it."
Another student in Tresidder com
mented, "The haircut was tantamont
to symbolic castration."
FacLst
"It's humorous in that it happened,
but it does point out a basic feature
of fraternity life which is fascist," a
resident of Crothers Memorial Hall
told The Daily.
A Lagunita girl claimed, "I'm not

sure that they can excuse themselves
by saying that it's a little joke."
A student polled by telephone in
Stern Hall refused to answer the
question, but did say, "I don't think
it has any significance at all, it was a
fairly spontaneous action."
Humorous
Another Stern resident said that if
the Delts actually performed the hair
cut, then it should be regarded as
humorous. "When the boys get to
gether, they seem to want to do some
thing along the line," he said.
The girl who answered the phone at
Hurlburt House, where Harris was
waylayed, commented, "The general
conclusion of the house is that it's a
terrible thing to do."
"It's an indication of something
much more serious," said a respon
dent at Jordan house.
InabiUty
A member of Theta Xi said that the
incident was "a poor showing of an
inability to verbalize their objections
to Harris. I don't know whether they
think that Harris is a serious threat
to their existence or not, but they
probably thought it was humorous."
A Delta Chi member, who responded
that the haircut was humorous, com
mented, "Dave didn't show too much
cool when he got all flustered. The
Delts didn't show too much cool in
doing it. The campus should have
taken it with a grain of salt. It was
done, and it was funny."
Selective Living:
"I believe in the merits of selective
living," a Phi Kappa Sigma member
said, "but I don't think that the fra

ternities should be a breeding place
for collective immaturity."
"They meant it as a poke, sort of,"
a Florence Moore girl told The Daily.
"Personally, I think it was pitiful. I
take it seriously, but the whole matter
depends on whether the guys take it
seriously."
A Roble resident said, "I just think
he's the most; nothing they can do to
him can change his image."
"My Parents"
"I talked to my parents about it and
they thought it was funny," another
Roble girl said.
"It was an infringement of personal
rights," according to a third Roble
girl.
The poll was designed to take a
cross-section of the campus to prevent
over-representation of any one group.
The interviews were taken according
to the following plan: Tresidder Un
ion, 26; fraternities, 17; Wilbur Hall,
10; Roble Hall, 5; Branner Hall, 4;
Florence Moore, 9; Stern Hall, 8;
Crothers Memorial and Crothers
Halls, 7; Lagunita Court, 5; women's
row houses, 5; and Toyon Hall, 4 in
terviews.
