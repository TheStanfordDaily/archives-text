# Asian Future Depends On U.S.'s Next Moves
## 
### 
The fate of all United States'
policies in Asia is hanging on
the destiny of one small nation
—South Vietnam. This is the
opinion of Prof. Claude A. Buss,
a former Foreign Service of
ficer and Stanford historian with
a wealth of experience in the
Far East.
Prof. Buss claims that our sys
tem of alliances, our opposition
to totalitarianism and commu
nism, and our determination to
halt "militant aggressive China
has caused us to plunge ever
deeper into the affairs of Asia.
This is what our government
conceives to be the justification
of its commitments to Vietnam
over the past twelve years."
.Regardless of the Vietnam
outcome, he says, the United
States must keep a strong mili
tary posture in the Far East and
at the same time "pursue an
active search for acceptable
peaceful relations."
"Americans have good things
to offer Asians," he writes, "both
in the material and the spiritual
realms, which Asians will con
tinue to need and want in their
struggle for growth and develop
ment.
"Most of humanity lives in
Asia and in wretched conditions.
. . . They are in a revolutionary
mood . . . they feel that their

spiritual resources will more
than compensate for their pov
erty and weakness.
Buss offered some predictions:
South Vietnam — "After the
cessation of hostilities, there
will be a generation of peaceful
reconstruction during which
American help will be the cru
cial factor."
Indonesia — "A tremendous
challenge for the futuie. This
particular domino has apparent
ly fallen on our side, but who
knows what America can do
to keep it there? The fate of
100,000 Indonesians is perhaps
the most crucial factor In deter
mining the nature of America's
future role in Southeast Asia."
Communist China — "In the
course of the next five years,
Americans are not likely to
experience great changes in
their relations with mainland
Chinese. The succession to Mao
Tse-tung is the great enigma....
The evidence indicates that the
successors to Mao Tse-tung are
likely to be harder than softer
in ty-eir attitudes toward the
U.S. However long it may take,
there is no prospect for peace in
Asia until China and thfc tilted
States renew their confidence in
each other and find a mutually
satisfactory way to live to
gether."

tinue to need and want in their
struggle for growth and develop

"Most of humanity lives in
Asia and in wretched conditions.
. . . They are in a revolutionary
mood . . . they feel that their

spiritual resources will more
than compensate for their pov
erty and weakness.
Buss offered some predictions:
South Vietnam — "After the
cessation of hostilities, there
will be a generation of peaceful
reconstruction during which
American help will be the cru
cial factor."
Indonesia — "A tremendous
challenge for the futuie. This
particular domino has apparent
ly fallen on our side, but who
knows what America can do
to keep it there? The fate of
100,000 Indonesians is perhaps
the most crucial factor In deter
mining the nature of America's
future role in Southeast Asia."
Communist China — "In the
course of the next five years,
Americans are not likely to
experience great changes in
their relations with mainland
Chinese. The succession to Mao
Tse-tung is the great enigma....
The evidence indicates that the
successors to Mao Tse-tung are
likely to be harder than softer
in ty-eir attitudes toward the
U.S. However long it may take,
there is no prospect for peace in
Asia until China and thfc tilted
States renew their confidence in
each other and find a mutually
satisfactory way to live to
gether."
The fate of all United States'
policies in Asia is hanging on
the destiny of one small nation
—South Vietnam. This is the
opinion of Prof. Claude A. Buss,
a former Foreign Service of
ficer and Stanford historian with
a wealth of experience in the
Far East.
Prof. Buss claims that our sys
tem of alliances, our opposition
to totalitarianism and commu
nism, and our determination to
halt "militant aggressive China
has caused us to plunge ever
deeper into the affairs of Asia.
This is what our government
conceives to be the justification
of its commitments to Vietnam
over the past twelve years."
.Regardless of the Vietnam
outcome, he says, the United
States must keep a strong mili
tary posture in the Far East and
at the same time "pursue an
active search for acceptable
peaceful relations."
"Americans have good things
to offer Asians," he writes, "both
in the material and the spiritual
realms, which Asians will con
tinue to need and want in their
struggle for growth and develop
ment.
