# Summer Jobs Abroad Offered To Business-Inclined Students
## 
### 
AISEC, a student organization
that secures summer jobs for
students in 40 countries abroad,
will hold an organizational meet
ing Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. in
Room 74 of the Graduate School
of Business.
The international exchange
program places over 40,000 stu
dents a year, and last year five
Stanford students worked abroad
in executive trainee jobs found
for them by AISEC, according
to Ogilvie, a graduate student in
business. Any undergraduate or
graduate regardless of major
may participate.
To go abroad a student must
have taken a basic economics
course and must have an interest
in international business. Ogilvie
stressed that students do not
have to be graduates nor do
they have to be male to partici
pate.
"In fact," says Ogilvie, "the
women get as much out of the
experience abroad as the men."
Last summer both Ogilvie and
his wife went to London in the
program; he helped design a
computer system, and his wife
worked as a private secretary.
AISEC, a student-run organi
zation that began in Europe in
1948, gives participants special
rates on chartered planes abroad.
The function of the local chap
ter, whose programs are fi
nanced wiih the help of inter
ested corporations, is to find
jobs in the Bay Area for foreign
students.

Jobs are almost always avail
able for American Students in
the country and field of business
of their choice, Ogilvie said.
Salaries usually are not high,
but they are enough to live on
in that country.
Roger Lamb, president tit the
Berkeley AISEC chapter, and
GSB's Dr. Oxley will speak at
the meeting Wednesday, where
the program will be fully ex
plained.
