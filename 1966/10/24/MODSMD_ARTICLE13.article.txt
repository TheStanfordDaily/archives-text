• U.S. Urges Continued Support
BONN — Chancellor Ludwig Erhard ap
pealed to the United States Sunday not to give
the impression of lessened commitment to
Europe and Germany.
Without mentioning the Vietnam war, Er
hard said:
"For 20 years the United States has protect
ed our freedom and guaranteed our security.
I have continually warned the German people
not to cast doubt on America's loyalty to alli
ances and treaties."
He avoided any strong claim for a West
German share in the control of nuclear "hard
ware" that would complicate American efforts
to get a treaty with the Soviet Union on halt
ing the spread of nuclear weapons.
"Everyone knows," Erhard said, "what a
full atomic strike means. Everyone knows that
}n Europe, Germany would apparently be its
first victim. So it is only obivous that within
the framework of the alliance we want to have
& voice in determining what weapons are to
be on German soil and what possibilities there
are of joint nuclear defense."

• Laotian City Bombed
i VIENTIANE — Bombers supplied the air
force by the United States flew over Vientiane
between 8 and 8:30 a.m., Friday and dropped
bombs on the army headquarters at Phone
Khene, the city's northeastern suburb.
The Vientiane airport also was bombed, but
damage there was not immediately reported.
The Laotian Premier, Prince Souvanna

Phouma, arrived in Paris Thursday after
meeting with President Johnson in New York.
Told of the air force attack, the Prince said
he was not aware of any attempted coup but
"it is very possible."
Reports from Vientiane to Bangkok said
that Camp Chinaimow, five miles north of
Vientiane, also was bombed.
The camp is the headquarters of Rightist
Gen. Kouprasith Abhay, one of a group of
generals who last June demanded removal of
Gen. Thao, the 32 year-old commander of the
Laotian air force.

• Nixon Sees IVo GOP Backlash
NEW YORK — Richard M. Nixon said Sun
day that if there are any votes in the "white
backlash" issue, Democrats will get them, not
Republicans.
"I don't know of one Republican candidate
who is riding the backlash," the former Re
publican Vice President said on the NBC ra
dio and television program, "Meet the Press."
Nixon, just back from a long campaign trip
for local GOP candidates, insisted he was not
a candidate for anything.
He admitted that Southern Republicans fa
vor segregation, but insisted that they are not
"racial demagogues" like some Democrats.
Nixon again predicted a "dramatic break
through" for the GOP in the November elec
tion.
After the election, he said, there will be Re
publican governors in 23 states, including New
York, California, Pennsylvannia, Massachu
setts, Ohio and Michigan, "and two senators
in Illinois."
"With that kind of a base, any GOP candi
date will have an even change to beat Lyndon

Johnson or Bobby Kennedy in 1968," he said.
He declined to discuss who "any GOP can
didate" might be.
• Economic Boom To Continue
HOT SPRINGS, VA. — An economic fore
cast of "fair and slightly cooler" for 1967 was
expected at the fall meeting of the Business
Council, which opened here Friday.
About 100 of the country's topmost indus
trialists assembled for the closed weekend con
ferences with Secretary of the Treasury Hen
ry H. Fowler, Secretary of Commerce John T.
Connor and other government officials.
Fowler was expected to provide assurances
that all signs point to continuation of the un
precedented business boom into its sixth year,
but at a somewhat slower rate of growth —
and with less inflationary heat.
• Douglas Discounts Percy Polls
CHICAGO—Sen. Paul H. Douglas, Illinois
Democrat who is embattled against Republi
can industrialist Charles H. Percy in his cam
paign for a fourth Senate term, today dis
counted straw votes which show Percy ahead
in their race.
One such poll, reported in Sunday editions
by the Chicago Sun-Times, reflected totals of
58.47 per cent favoring Percy and 41.53 for
Douglas on the basis of a sampling of 9,000
persons, both in Chicago and some suburbs
and in six downstate counties.
Douglas said some private polls indicate

he's ahead, and "I've never had a more cordial
reception than I've received in the last few
weeks."
Douglas asserted that he is facing racial
scare campaign in Chicago.
"In many wards, Republican precinct cap
tains are spreading the word that I and the
Democratic party are forcing the Negro on
them," he said. "This is being done quietly,
but firmly. And this is not my opinion."
On the war in Vietnam, Douglas said he
favors a program of mutual de-escalation in
which the opposing sides withdraw proportion
ate numbers of troops until both sides are out
and replaced with neutral forces which would
resist any aggression.
• Westinghouse Strike Averted
PITTSBURGH —• Negotiators for Westing
house Electric Corp. and a union representing
14,000 salaried workers reached a contract
agreement early Sunday, the second of the
firm's four unions to settle.
The settlement with the Federation of West
inghouse Independent Salaried Unions came
after 17 hours of intensive bargaining which
began when the 40,000-member AFL-CIO In
ternational Union of Electrical Workers (lUE)
came to terms Saturday.
Westinghouse said two other unions repre
senting about 21,000 employes, the AFL-CIO
International Brotherhood of Electrical Work
ers and the Independent United Electrical
Workers, are considering packages similar to
the one accepted by lUE.
The lUE pact is for three years with wage
increases estimated at 50 cents per hour by
the union, a cost-of-living escalator clause and
fringe benefits, including a savings and stock
option clause.

• Federal Study Of Food Strike
DENVER, COLO. — A high-priority study
of the costs of food sales promotion, including
games of chance as well as trading stamps, is
being demanded by President Lyndon B.
Johnson's Special Assistant for Consumer
Affairs, Esther Peterson.
She disclosed her call for an investigation
yesterday in Denver, where she came to look
at a week-long boycott of some chain super
markets by housewives demanding lower
prices.
She avoided any flat endorsement of the
Denver housewives' boycott, explaining that
she was not familiar with details of the Den
ver situation.
Mrs. Peterson warned against price wars,
which she said usually lead to higher prices
later. She said she hoped to stop "pyramiding"
of prices where each handler of food adds a
shade more to the price than his increased cost.
• ISo Cookie Flights to Vietnam
WASHINGTON — The Air Force, tightly
squeezed for cargo space because of the Viet
nam war, has told its squadrons to stop flying
gifts of food and clothes to South Vietnam
for American Gls and homeless Vietnamese.
The directive, dated June 3, but not made
available until today, also ruled out a Christ
mas airlift of cakes and cookies to U.S. troops
this year.
"All transportation available to the Depart
ment of Defense is fully committed to meet
worldwide logistical requirements of our anrj
ed forces, especially in Vietnam," the direc
tive said. "The Department of Defense has no
program which extends transportation assis
tance for materials destined for the South
Vietnamese."
