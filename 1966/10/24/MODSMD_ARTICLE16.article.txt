# Poloists Lose Key UCLA Match
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER Sports Editor 
UCLA broke away from a 3-3
halftime deadlock last Friday to
beat Stanford's water polo
squad. 7-5. Unless Stanford can
rally to knock off the Bruins next
weekend in Los Angeles, UCLA
looms large to repeat last year's
season as undefeated national
champions.
Saturday morning the Cards
came back to beat UOP easily,
15-4, in a game where the Stan
ford front line played little more
than a quarter.
The Stanford frosh won their
fourth game in a row after los
ing their initial three outings.
The Papooses manhandled Col
lege of the Sequoias, 15-3, on Fri
day and swamped Palo Alto
High School the following day,
15-4.
Forceful First Quarter
Stanford opened the game
against UCLA with a strong
first quarter after Bruin Tor
rey Webb scored the first goal
of the game, Mark Parmely
evened the count with a searing
backhand shot from the hole.
John Parker then took two as
sist passes from Gary Sheerer to
give the Indians three goals.
UCLA held the Tribe scoreless
in the second quarter and tied
the game on goals by Webb and
Bruce Bradley.

The third quarter was the
Tribe's undoing. Parker, for the
third time in the game, con
verted a pass from Sheerer into
a Stanford score. In the mean
time, however, UCLA's All-
American and Olympic veteran
Stan Cole exploded for two goals
and Bradley scored his second.
Cole scored again the fourth
quarter to put the game out of
Stanford's reach. Pete Ready
didn't let up, though, as he put
the Cards' fifth goal on the score
board with a powerful sweep
shot late in the period.
Close But No Cigar
The story of the game for
Stanford was a frustrating one.
The Cards hit only 25 per cent
of their shots, missing goals by
matters of half an inch.
Coach Jim Gaughran started
the game using a hard-driving
Stanford offense — a style of
play that usually forces the de
fensive team either to four the
pushing offensive players or else
give up a good shot.
The referees were somewhat
lax in calling the fouls, which
resulted in catastrophe for the
Cards. A hard drive would get
an Indian into scoring position;
he would be fouled — and he
would get neither the shot nor
the foul called on UCLA.
Slow-Down Proves Fatal
Stanford slowed down the play
in the second half, trying to set
up one or two men with good
position in the hole. It was then
that Cole broke away to score
his three goals and abort the
Stanford control of the game.
Stanford travels south this
weekend to face revenge-minded

USC Friday and high-minded
UCLA Saturday. The Cards
bumped the Trojans, 11-10, in
sudden death two weeks ago,
and in USC's pool, goals will be
hard to come by.
The game with UCLA will be
the last chance to derail the
Bruin championship train and
get Stanford back on the right

track. UCLA beat Cal, 13-6, in
Berkeley last Saturday.
Stanford ray away with the
UOP game, with Sheerer lead
ing the pack with 6 goals. Park
er scored twice and tossed 4
assist passes. Bill Meyer scored
two, and Walt Poterbin, Luis
Nicolao, Greg Buckingham, and
John Wooley each hit one shot.

Doug Chapin made 10 saves
in front of the Indian goal.
Wayne Wilson was the big
man for the Stanford frosh last
weekend. Wilson tagged COS's
goalie for seven scores in Fri
day's game, Captain Tom Hill
and Dennis Abshear also con
tributed large amounts of fire
damage to the stately Sequoias.

a Stanford score. In the mean
time, however, UCLA's All-
American and Olympic veteran
Stan Cole exploded for two goals
and Bradley scored his second.
Cole scored again the fourth
quarter to put the game out of
Stanford's reach. Pete Ready
didn't let up, though, as he put
the Cards' fifth goal on the score
board with a powerful sweep
shot late in the period.
Close But No Cigar
The story of the game for
Stanford was a frustrating one.
The Cards hit only 25 per cent
of their shots, missing goals by
matters of half an inch.
Coach Jim Gaughran started
the game using a hard-driving
Stanford offense — a style of
play that usually forces the de
fensive team either to four the
pushing offensive players or else
give up a good shot.
The referees were somewhat
lax in calling the fouls, which
resulted in catastrophe for the
Cards. A hard drive would get
an Indian into scoring position;
he would be fouled — and he
would get neither the shot nor
the foul called on UCLA.
Slow-Down Proves Fatal
Stanford slowed down the play
in the second half, trying to set
up one or two men with good
position in the hole. It was then
that Cole broke away to score
his three goals and abort the
Stanford control of the game.
Stanford travels south this

USC Friday and high-minded
UCLA Saturday. The Cards
bumped the Trojans, 11-10, in
sudden death two weeks ago,

The game with UCLA will be
the last chance to derail the
Bruin championship train and

John Wooley each hit one shot.

Doug Chapin made 10 saves
in front of the Indian goal.
Wayne Wilson was the big
man for the Stanford frosh last

tributed large amounts of fire

UCLA broke away from a 3-3
