# Peace Corps To Present Students With Challenges
## 
### 
"The peace Corps is the only orga
nization of its kind with the potential
to be big enough to solve the problems
which cause Vietnams and Santo Do
mingos. Whether or not that potential
is realized is up to the Stanford
senior."
Chuck Butler, Director of Campus
Recruiting for the Peace Corps and
a 1961 Stanford graduate, challenged
all interested students to "put their
body where their mouth is" and par
ticipate in Peace Corps Recruiting
Week, beginning at noon today with
a rally in Memoiial Plaza and con
tinuing through the week.
Kirby Jones
Today's rally will feature Kirby
Jones, former volunteer in the Do
minican Republic and Alabama, speak
ing on "Santo Domingo and Alabama:
A Profile of Involvement." A movie
on the Peace Corps Land Resettle
ment Project in Kenya will be shown
tonight in Tresidder, Room 270, at
8:15.
The week's program will include
panels and living group discussions
with six returned volunteers, as well
as films, rallies, and speeches. Ques
tions will be answered and applica
tions will be available all day during
the week in Memorial Plaza. All those
who file applications before October
31 will be informed by December 25
if they have been accepted.
In the Peace Corps' five years of
action Stanford has contributed 380
volunteers, ranking sixth in the coun
try. It ranks first in terms of the
ratio of volunteers to total student
body.
Insufficient Numbers
There are presently 15,000 volun
teers, the equivalent of one military
division, distributed among 53 coun
tries. 10,000 volunteers are now in
training for next summer. The num
ber afield could easily be assigned to
Brazil and still not be sufficient. "90
per cent of all requests from countries
are specifically for college students,"
stated Butler. "We don't have enough
to fill those requests."
The Peace Corps' uniqueness and
effectiveness .according to Butler, lie
in its potentially great size and in
individual efforts on a community
level. The volunteer lives with the peo
ple of a country, speaking their lan
guage, eating their food, becoming
an integral part of their existence.
The volunteer acts as a satalyst to
bring people together to solve their
own problems of political structure,
food production, health, and educa
tion.
All P.S. foreign assistance should
be channelled through the Peace
Corps, in Butler's opinion. "World
problems can't be solved by diplomatic
tours of problem areas, by spending
two weeks in the Dominican Republic.
They can't be solved by writing
out a ch"ck for 'conscience money'
or spending 'conscience time' in a

country—which is what we, as individ
uals and as a country have always
tried to do, and almost always failed.
It takes at least two years of per
sonal effort to do some good."
Qualifications
The Peace Corps requires no spe
cial background or a second lan
guage. The 'only qualifications are
tolerance, motivation, U.S. citizenship,
and freedom from dependencies. 70
per cent of all volunteers are liberal
arts graduates, given intensive lan
guage instruction and training in a
special field.
"It's hard to articulate how much
we, as the products of a superskill
society have to offer, both as individ
uals and as part of a collective effort
whichwhich is our only hope for world
peace," stated Butler.
He expressed doubts about the mo

tivation and discipline of the more
vocal members of the student body.
"Generally speaking, these individuals
are not the ones who apply for Peace
Corps work. They are content to at
tend rallies, go out for a beer after
wards, complain about U.S. policy, and
go to their classes."
The "action," as he sees it, is not
Telegraph Avenue, but in a Vene
zuelan slum where a worker gets up
every morning for two years with
parasites in his stomach and goes out
to teach children.
"The Peace Corps is giving these
individuals their opportunity to change
.U.S. policy, to put their body where
their mouth is. In ten years they
won't be able to blame our foreign
policy; they will have to blame them
selves for not doing anything about
it."
"The peace Corps is the only orga
nization of its kind with the potential
to be big enough to solve the problems
which cause Vietnams and Santo Do
mingos. Whether or not that potential

body.
Insufficient Numbers
There are presently 15,000 volun
teers, the equivalent of one military
division, distributed among 53 coun
tries. 10,000 volunteers are now in
training for next summer. The num
ber afield could easily be assigned to
Brazil and still not be sufficient. "90
per cent of all requests from countries
are specifically for college students,"
stated Butler. "We don't have enough
to fill those requests."
The Peace Corps' uniqueness and
effectiveness .according to Butler, lie
in its potentially great size and in
individual efforts on a community
level. The volunteer lives with the peo
ple of a country, speaking their lan
guage, eating their food, becoming
an integral part of their existence.
The volunteer acts as a satalyst to
bring people together to solve their
own problems of political structure,
food production, health, and educa
tion.
All P.S. foreign assistance should
be channelled through the Peace
Corps, in Butler's opinion. "World
problems can't be solved by diplomatic
tours of problem areas, by spending
two weeks in the Dominican Republic.
They can't be solved by writing
out a ch"ck for 'conscience money'
or spending 'conscience time' in a

country—which is what we, as individ
uals and as a country have always
tried to do, and almost always failed.
It takes at least two years of per
sonal effort to do some good."
Qualifications
The Peace Corps requires no spe
cial background or a second lan
guage. The 'only qualifications are
tolerance, motivation, U.S. citizenship,
and freedom from dependencies. 70
per cent of all volunteers are liberal
arts graduates, given intensive lan
guage instruction and training in a
special field.
"It's hard to articulate how much
we, as the products of a superskill
society have to offer, both as individ
uals and as part of a collective effort
whichwhich is our only hope for world
peace," stated Butler.
He expressed doubts about the mo

tivation and discipline of the more
vocal members of the student body.
"Generally speaking, these individuals
are not the ones who apply for Peace
Corps work. They are content to at
tend rallies, go out for a beer after
wards, complain about U.S. policy, and
go to their classes."
The "action," as he sees it, is not
Telegraph Avenue, but in a Vene
zuelan slum where a worker gets up
every morning for two years with
parasites in his stomach and goes out
to teach children.
"The Peace Corps is giving these
individuals their opportunity to change
.U.S. policy, to put their body where
their mouth is. In ten years they
won't be able to blame our foreign
policy; they will have to blame them
selves for not doing anything about
it."
"The peace Corps is the only orga
nization of its kind with the potential
to be big enough to solve the problems
which cause Vietnams and Santo Do
mingos. Whether or not that potential
is realized is up to the Stanford
senior."
Chuck Butler, Director of Campus
Recruiting for the Peace Corps and
a 1961 Stanford graduate, challenged
all interested students to "put their
body where their mouth is" and par
ticipate in Peace Corps Recruiting
Week, beginning at noon today with
a rally in Memoiial Plaza and con
tinuing through the week.
Kirby Jones
Today's rally will feature Kirby
Jones, former volunteer in the Do
minican Republic and Alabama, speak
ing on "Santo Domingo and Alabama:
A Profile of Involvement." A movie
on the Peace Corps Land Resettle
ment Project in Kenya will be shown
tonight in Tresidder, Room 270, at
8:15.
The week's program will include
panels and living group discussions
with six returned volunteers, as well
as films, rallies, and speeches. Ques
tions will be answered and applica
tions will be available all day during
the week in Memorial Plaza. All those
who file applications before October
31 will be informed by December 25
if they have been accepted.
In the Peace Corps' five years of

volunteers, ranking sixth in the coun

Qualifications
The Peace Corps requires no spe
cial background or a second lan
guage. The 'only qualifications are
tolerance, motivation, U.S. citizenship,
and freedom from dependencies. 70
per cent of all volunteers are liberal
arts graduates, given intensive lan
guage instruction and training in a
special field.
"It's hard to articulate how much
we, as the products of a superskill
society have to offer, both as individ
uals and as part of a collective effort
whichwhich is our only hope for world
peace," stated Butler.
He expressed doubts about the mo

tivation and discipline of the more
vocal members of the student body.
"Generally speaking, these individuals
are not the ones who apply for Peace
Corps work. They are content to at
tend rallies, go out for a beer after
wards, complain about U.S. policy, and
go to their classes."
The "action," as he sees it, is not
Telegraph Avenue, but in a Vene
zuelan slum where a worker gets up
every morning for two years with
parasites in his stomach and goes out
to teach children.
"The Peace Corps is giving these
individuals their opportunity to change
.U.S. policy, to put their body where
their mouth is. In ten years they
won't be able to blame our foreign
policy; they will have to blame them
selves for not doing anything about
it."
"The peace Corps is the only orga
nization of its kind with the potential
to be big enough to solve the problems
which cause Vietnams and Santo Do
mingos. Whether or not that potential
is realized is up to the Stanford
senior."
Chuck Butler, Director of Campus
Recruiting for the Peace Corps and
a 1961 Stanford graduate, challenged
all interested students to "put their
body where their mouth is" and par
ticipate in Peace Corps Recruiting
Week, beginning at noon today with
a rally in Memoiial Plaza and con
tinuing through the week.
Kirby Jones
Today's rally will feature Kirby
Jones, former volunteer in the Do
minican Republic and Alabama, speak
ing on "Santo Domingo and Alabama:
A Profile of Involvement." A movie
on the Peace Corps Land Resettle
ment Project in Kenya will be shown
tonight in Tresidder, Room 270, at
8:15.
The week's program will include
panels and living group discussions
with six returned volunteers, as well
as films, rallies, and speeches. Ques
tions will be answered and applica
tions will be available all day during
the week in Memorial Plaza. All those
who file applications before October
31 will be informed by December 25
if they have been accepted.
In the Peace Corps' five years of
action Stanford has contributed 380
volunteers, ranking sixth in the coun
try. It ranks first in terms of the
ratio of volunteers to total student
body.
Insufficient Numbers
There are presently 15,000 volun
teers, the equivalent of one military
division, distributed among 53 coun
tries. 10,000 volunteers are now in
training for next summer. The num
ber afield could easily be assigned to
Brazil and still not be sufficient. "90
per cent of all requests from countries
are specifically for college students,"
stated Butler. "We don't have enough
to fill those requests."
The Peace Corps' uniqueness and
effectiveness .according to Butler, lie
in its potentially great size and in
individual efforts on a community
level. The volunteer lives with the peo
ple of a country, speaking their lan
guage, eating their food, becoming
an integral part of their existence.
The volunteer acts as a satalyst to
bring people together to solve their
own problems of political structure,
food production, health, and educa
tion.
All P.S. foreign assistance should
be channelled through the Peace
Corps, in Butler's opinion. "World
problems can't be solved by diplomatic
tours of problem areas, by spending
two weeks in the Dominican Republic.
They can't be solved by writing
out a ch"ck for 'conscience money'
or spending 'conscience time' in a

country—which is what we, as individ
uals and as a country have always
tried to do, and almost always failed.
It takes at least two years of per
sonal effort to do some good."
