# Washington Score Stuns Illini 6-3
## 
### TOM EDISON 
Everything seemed set for an
Illini victory over inconsistent
Stanford but the game's only
fumble turned into the game's
only touchdown and the Indians
came through with their biggest
win of the season, a 6-3 victory
over the University of Illinois.
The weather was ideal with
a crisp wind blowing from the
west; the stadium was virtually
packed with over 56,000 fans
watching the game; and the
crowd was primed for it was Il
linois's homecoming game.
However, Stanford was in Illi
nois to play football and Jack
Root showed the Illini that he
could beat them at their own
game which he did by running
straight into the middle of Illi
nois's defense.
Boot: Back Of Game
Root, named the Back of the
Game, picked up 82 of Stanford's
89 total yards rushing during
the day and broke into the open
on one of his rare occasions as
a receiver for what looked like
a sure touchdown late in the
first quarter only to be over
thrown by quarterback Gene
Washington.
Washington had his problems
again in hitting his receivers.

He was seven for 24 in passing
with two interceptions. How
ever, Washington displayed his
speed aroufid end on several
occasions especially in the third
quarter when he skirted around
end for a touchdown from six
yards out.
The game-winning touchdown
by Washington was set up on a
fumble recovery by Stanford's
Phil Messer on Illinois's 14-yard
line. The fumble resulted when
Illinois's Mick Smith signaled a
fair catch but dropped Dave
Lewis's punt on the 10-yard line.
Messer pounced on the bounc
ing ball on the fourteen.
This was the turning point of
the game. From there Root car
ried the ball five straight times
alternating between slanting off
right guard and hitting outside
left tackle. Each time he plowed
his way over Illinois defenders
for three or four big yards.
Washington Scores
After a five-yard penalty and
an incompleted pass Washing
ton faked a pass and swung
around left end for six points.
Bill Shoemaker's placekick was
unsuccessful after had hit seven
straight in previous games.
Statistcally the Indians were
demolished. In total yardage the
Illini gained nearly 150 yards
more than Stanford while doub
ling Stanford's output in pass
ing yardages. Illinois completed
18 of 36 passes.
However, Stanford was able
to produce the "big" play and
certainly got its share of the
breaks and this is what makes
a winning football team.
Big Break
On big break for Stanford
came early in the fourth quar
ter when Illinois was rolling and
on the verge of scoring. Illinois
had moved to Stanford's nine
ynrd-line after Illini quarterback
Bob Naponic streaked through
the left side of his line on a third
and inches situation for 22 yards.
On the next series of downs
Naponic, after being brought
down for a loss on the 13 by
Monty Nohrman, attempted a
pass that was batted down in
the end zone. However, an of
fensive interference penalty

brought the ball back to the 28
which took the pressure off of
the Indians' defense.
Stanford obtained possession
of the ball on their 10 yard-line
and again called on Root to pull
them out of trouble. On five
straight carries Root drug the
Indians to their 39 yard line.
Lewis then got off the best
punt of the day for 57 yards
that rolled dead on Illinois's
four. Stanford thus moved from
their nine to Illinois's four yard
line.
The first half was unusual in
many respects.
Passing On Fourth?
Illinois passed on fourth down
on two occasions once on a
fourth and eleven situation. Illi
nois was ready to gamble on
the passing ability of Naponic.
The gambles didn't pay off. Na

ponic also attempted a plunge
on a fourth down, again unsuc
cessful.
Stanford tried some fancy
passing of its own when Bill
Shoemaker attempted to hit Bob
Blunt in the end zone after re
ceiving a hand-off from Wash
ington. The pass was intercepted
by Bruce Sullivan, giving the
Illini the ball on their 20.
Longest Run
Another big play for Illinois
in the first period was a 45-yard
run by Bill Huston from his
four-yard line. However, one of
the Illini's unseccessful fourth
down passes end the first
quarter with neither squad
scoring.
Both teams attempted field
goals in the second quarter, one
a 50 yarder by Shoemaker that
was partially blocked and fell

way short and one by Illinois's
Jim Stotz with only 15 seconds

left in the half. This one by
Stotz split thp up-rights, being

kicked from a 30 degree angle
and from 26 yards out.
The Illinois marched 71 yards
to get within field-goal distance,
52 of these yards off the arm of
Naponic. An 18-yard pass from
Naponic to John Wright just
after Shoemaker's boot had
fallen short got Illinois started
on their long drive for the only
score in the first half.
Meager Production
Stanford's statistics at half
time revealed a net yardage of
only 12 yards on the ground
while Illinois had gained 83. At
this stage of the game the Illini
were 11 for 18 in passing while
Stanford had hit only four of 11.
The punting game was ex
tremely important in this clash
especially in the first half. The
Illini were able to get two punts
off for an average of only 18 1/2

yards both coming early in the
first quarter. One punt hobbled
over the side of Tom Sminth'f
foot for only four yards.
Stanford's however, averaged
over 36 yards on their punts In
the first half, one falling dead on
the Illini's four yard line.
Fullback Root took the
hand-off from Washington and
smashed up the middle for 21
yards. However, two incomplete
passes by Washington stymied
the drive.
Some fine defensive play by
A 1 Wilburn, who was named
Lineman of the Game, and
Marty Brill kept the Illini in
their own territory throughout
the third quarter.
Stanford hosts the University
of Washington next Saturday
in a big conference clash for
both schools.
