By BILL GRAHAM
Coming back from a scoreless
first half, Stanford's varsity soc
cer team tallied twice ila the
third period to defeat the Uni
versity of California at Davis,
2-0.
Underdog Davis gave the
Tribe a stiff fight for the first
half, but the Cards came to life
in the third period as Knut Ar
neson broke lose on a fast break
to give the bootens their first
goal.
Bill Hurlburt gave Stanford
its insurance goal on a contested
play later in the third period.
Hurlburt took a long shot which
went over the goalies head, hit
the cross bar and bounced in
and out of the goal, but the
referee ruled it good.
Dominate Fourth period
The Tribe dominated the
fourth period, driving to Davis's
goal several times, but the team
was unable to score again.
The Cards' defense has done
a remarkable job so far this
season, considering that the
team has had four goalies in
jured. Mike Camp, a converted

forward who scored the winning
goal against Pacific last week,
manned the goal against Davis.
Camp was replacing Gunther
Brandt, who had been moved
from right wing when the hoot
ers ran out of regular goal ten
ders.
The Indian's next game is
with the University of Sail
Francisco, next Saturday. This
will be a crucial game for the
team. They must have a victory
to stay in contention for the
first place in the league.
In addition, the booters must
hope that San Jose is defeated.
The Tribe's victory over Davis
put its record at 4-2-1 overall
and 2-1 in league play.
JV Triumphs
The junior varsity soccer
team downed their Davis coun
terparts, 4-2. Rues Hall tallied
first to give Stanford a 1-0 lead.
But Davis came fighting back to
make the score 2-1 at halftime.
The Card's defense tightened
up in the second half, however,
and John Sines booted one in to
tie the score. Walt Lami then
contributed two goals to give
the Cards the victory.
