# FROSH REBOUND 28-7
## Parish Plunges Pulverize SJS 
### GREG PSALTIS 
The freshman football team
displayed a powerful second
half offense Thursday night as
it rolled over San Jose State,
28-7 for its first win. The Pa
pooses held a slim 9-7 half-time
lead, but came through with 19
points in the second half.
Quarterback Jim Plunckett
and fullback Don Parish ignited
the offense. Plunckett passed for
80 yards and ran for another 76
while Parish gained 122 yards,
all on the ground.
Parish Scores First
Stanford began the scoring
early in the second quarter.
After Philip Murphy intercepted
a San Jose pass on the Spartans'
37, Parish carried the ball 4
times and finally scored the first
touchdown of the game. Paul
Mascovich added the extra
point.
Not to be outdone, San Jose
took the kickoff and marched

80 yards in 11 plays. Spartan
quarterback Bob Cushman pro
vided the main punch as he
completed 6 passes during the
drive. The score came on a 7
yard swing pass to halfback
Mike Scrivner.
Papooses Get Safety
After two exchanges of the
ball, Stanford once again started
a steady drive. When it stalled
on the Spartan 20, Mascovich
attempted a 36 yard field goal
with 12 seconds left in the half.
The kick was short and was
fielded by Scrivner. He was
swarmed over by a host of Stan
ford linemen for a safety. The
half ended with Stanford lead
ing, 9-7.
The second play of the second
half proved to be a costly one

lor San Jose as its star passer,
Bob Cushman, was injured and
left the game. His replacement,
Dick Armstrong, proved to be
an accurate thrower, but never
did get the Spartans moving
well.
