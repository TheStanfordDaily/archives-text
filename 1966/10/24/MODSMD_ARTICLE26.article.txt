## Hair-Raising Debate Cuts Fraternity Ideal 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
I overheard some in the
Union say, "If it takes twenty
Delts to accommulate the cour
age to attack a pacifist, no won
der our football team loses." The
reasoning here is only slightly
more fcbsurd than that which
led to the saving of Dave Harris'
head Even the Delts will have
to admit that Dave showed more
"class" than they did.

• Identity Crisis
Editor, The Daily:
There they sit, not a hundred
yards apart on the same hill,
a student group that last week
tried to give a truer meaning
vo the idea of fraternity—and
one that hazes those who aren't
even its pledges.
If it were still possible to con
ceive of a group mind we might
be able to turn to the social
psychologists at work in Cub-
Verley basement for help in re
solving the problem of cognitive
dissonance that exists in the
Stanford mentality. Thursday
evening's ambush of Mr. Har
ris dramatized this problem.
Those who dismiss the affair as
a high-spirited prank insult what
've assume to be the majority
of students at this University
men and women who ask to be
taken seriously. Those who view
the occurrence simply as an
other manifestation of fraternity
idiocy or malevolence miss much
of the point. For this would be to
'jut all the blame on Smerdya
kov. What happened Thursday
is the expression of an attitude
of mind, a discontent, a miscon
ception of the role of the uni
versity,, which is shared by
many. They find it difficult to
conceal their delight in the vigi
lante tactics.
It was only a few months ago
that a member of the coaching
staff was exercised about Mr.
Morrison's hair; he was also
much concerned about "images."
The world of this man is prob
ably so abstract as a result of
S his kind of thinking that he will
see no connection between his
statements and the recent inci
dent. Public relations language
is so much a part of the life of
this school that we find even
Delts talking in terms of images.
One of the signers of this letter
'vas told by members of that or
ga ruction that the brothers
were, in so many words, defend
ing the honor of the University
—as well as their reputations
among friends and family in the
home town (who evidently al
ready see Stanford as the Har
vard of the West).
Stanford is caught in a dilem
ma: we seem to want to be
something different from what
the University was a decade and
a half ago, and yet the thought
that alumni groups, parents,
trustees (in short, Stanford yes
veryear) may take offense at
something or other causes acute
anxiety. It is time that, like
the feudal barons, we sorted
out our loyalties and put those
purposes which are essential to
the University first. These have
to do with education, and range
all the way from that sweet joy
of seeing a connection no one
else has perceived to the sharp
ening of character which comes
with learning to see the incon
sistencies and shams for what
they are. Let us hope that those
faculty members and students
who will be charged with eval
uating what goes on at Stanford
will not hesitate to inquire into
the relevance and legitimacy of
such "services" to society as an
athletic program of the present
proportions, the ROTC, and all
the rest of it. And we might
more about character and
less about image.
One last thought: maybe we
can bring in the psychiatrists
if not Prof. Festinger—to tell
us what it is, deep down, that
gets us so upset about long hair.

• Apoiogy
Editor, The Daily:
Thursday evening about
nine o'clock, as I was walking
past Hurlburt House, I saw sev
eral darkly-clad figures lurking
among the parked cars. My first
reaction was fear, but then I
decided that since they were
Stanford men, it must be an in
nocent' "R.F." At worst I
though it might be a fraternity
"Hell-week" prank, to which vic
tim and attacker alike were at
least tacit consentors by their
membership in the club.
Imagine, then, my horror upon
discovering that their victim was
not some eager if hapless pledge,
but someone who was entirely
outside the realm of fraternities,
and their pranks and upon
whom they inflicted verbal as
well as physical abuse. Such
things have, after all, a proper
place and a proper victim, even,
perhaps, a proper style.
My apologies to Mr. Harris for
overestimating the Stanford
sense of fair-play and decency,
for not notifying the police at
once. I hope, at least, that there
are many Stanford students
Whose admiration for our Stu
to be resolved by force rather
than through reason or dialogue.

dent Body President, like mine,
has grown considerably as a re
sult of this unfortunate en
counter.

• Respectability
Editor, The Daily:
Not very much real damage
was done to Dave Harris Thurs
day night, since his hair will
grow back. And there are prob
ably some respectable citizens
who will chuckle and feel re
lieved that Stanford students are
still up to old fashioned boyish
pranks. But there was something
about the attack on Harris that
made my flesh crawl. Perhaps
it was the fact that there were
20 attackers against one vic
time, that they operated in the
dark, and that they hid behind
masks.
From time to time Stanford
students have been guilty of
drunkenness, property damage,
defiance of University regula
tions, and failure to wash. But
Thursday night's act was far
more degrading than any of
these —degrading to the partici
pants and to the University. It
smacked of the kind of sly and
cowardly viciousness that we
have heard so much of, in other
places but in similar context,
during the past few years.
There has been considerable
breast-beating over the student
rebels who defy adults and wear
long hair; now I hope the ad
ministration, the faculty, and
the alumni will address their
concern to the sickness that
prompted the mindless inde
cency demonstrated by well
groomed students the other
night.

• Brotherhood?
Editor, The Daily:
The recent Scalping Function
is such a classic expression of
immaturity and resentment that
it verifies a time-worn thought:
the only problem with fraternal
ism at Stanford is that it has
never been tried.
OTTO SCHATZ
• Breeding Grounds
Editor, The Daily:
We would like to express our
open contempt for the actions
of those who were involved in
the assault on Dave Harris
Thursday night. Ignorant and
violent action cannot be toler
ated in any community. Believ
ing still in the merits of selec
tive living, we wish to make it
clear that a fraternity is not
necessarily a breeding place for
collective immaturity.

• Childish Illusion
Editor, The Daily:
Strange beasts, these hooded
people who lie in wait for one
man to cross their all-too-narrow
path. These people who would
strip a person of a trait disagree
able to them.
Certainly, not a responsible
act; indeed, we condemn it as
an irrational, irresponsible, and
immature one. The cutting of
Dave Harris* hair against his
will by this group we can only
hope was not a deliberative act.
Perhaps they had been drinking.
Under the influence of alcohol,
a person is docile, easily led in
to this sort of mass action aimed
against one individual.
We are loathe to admit that a
responsible student would be in
duced to such irrationality. Mr.
Harris has stated that the fra
ternity climate is not conducive
to the development of a respon
sible student. Is this the insti
tutions' reaction to his chal
lenge? A challenge to accept
the responsibility to respect
other people's right to dress,
speak and, above all, to think
as they please.
Children live with the "illu
sion of cehtrality." However, we
expect children to be immature.
We expect differences of opinion
This group hardly consists of
children, yet why does it retain
the behavior of childhood?

We emphatically oppose this
action, and best find a reflection
of our viewpoint in Voltaire's
statement: "I may not agree
with what you say, but I defend
to the death your right to say
it."

• Too Late
Editor, The Daily:
I'd like to ask one of the 20
Delts immortalized on October
21 a question (the Delt who
was sorry he had cut D. H.
hair). Dave Harris "showed a
lot of class" and now you feel
sorry that you cut his hair.
Why? It seems to me that you
should wonder about the worth
of a system of ethics that per
mits your victim to judge you.
Your values can't be very real
to you.
I think it's appropriate, here,
to mention to the other nine
teen Delts that you're too late
now anyway. The ideas symbol
ized by Dave Harris' hair and
beard have taken root long ago.
You're simply exhibiting a
frustration. It would be ridicu
lous to call your action a worth
while piece of social comment.

• Thuggery
Editor, The Daily:
Friday's Daily placed side by
side a story about the theft of
newspapers from campus mail
boxes by members of Phi Delta
Theta and a picture of the thug
gery worked on Dave Harris by
members of Delta Tau Delta; on
the sidewalk outside the office
in Mem Quad where I was read
ing The Daily, someone had
stencilled the Greek letters DTD
in black paint over a swastika.
These things came together
for me to suggest a whole far
greater than the sum of its
parts: a configuration of out
lawry that has too many ugly
parallels in the violent society
of the world off campus just
now to be dismissed as adoles
cent pranking.
When a group whose member
ship is selective along lines of
racial and religious prejudice
acts to clear the community of
"undesirable elements"—in the
Delts' case, to make Stanford
safe for the cameras of Time—
it has become political, and must
be judged from the perspective
of its capacity to threaten the
freedom and the quality of life
in the society around it. South
erners may tolerate the Ku
Klux Klan, and the citizens of
Clyde, California, the presence
of armed vigilantes in their
midst; but a university with
claims on greatness cannot af
ford to tolerate the likes of
Delta Tau Delta.
DIANE MIDDLEBROOK
• A Commendation
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to commend those
members of Delta Tau Delta who
participated in the attack on
Dave Harris. Their action has
done more for the fight to abol
ish fraternities at Stanford than
any of Harris' speeches. Dave
Harris' election was a chal
lenge to the fraternities at Stan
ford. It is quite revealing to see
the Delts' answer to this chal
lenge.
FRED LONSDALE
• Fun & Games
Editor, The Daily:
Well, once again our enobled
fraternity system has proven
its necessary function to the in
tellectual spirit-of this campus
by trimming Harris to a predis
posed notion of what a student
body officer should look like.
Yes, it seems that these magni
ficent clusters of enlightened
Greeks, with their heroic RF's.
manly smirks, and scholarly ap
proaches, have finally asserted
themselves.
Gee, kids, isn't this a "fun"
university.

• Poetic Justice
Editor, The Daily:
Harris once had flowing hair
It was his choice, he didn't care
About the brainless ones who
stare
And bow their heads in empty
prayer
And talk in tones of deep despair
About the clothes the beatniks
wear
Believing that it is not fair
That he escaped convention's
lair
Leaving them to moulder there
With mental furniture that's
bare
A table and a straight backed
chair
A carpet with an ugly tear
A sofa stuffed with human hair
Cut from those better than they.

• Last Gasps Of Hell
Editor, The Daily:
Phi Delt pledges steal Dailies.
Delts assault Dave Harris. I
thought the games of the recent
past ("Icey Dicey," the hiring
of a house prostitute, the killing
of a black dog) were over.
The theory is that if a pledge
endures enough "hell," he will
have to say that it was all
worth while. Perhaps the pres
ent absurdities represent the
last gasps of a threatened insti
tution, the traditional fraternity,
frantically asserting its "worth."
If so, we can celebrate what
is to come as we deplore what
is here. Or pledges can change
present systems by collectively
refusing to participate in those
events of which they disapprove.
DOUG OHMANS
• From The Lost Past
Editor, The Daily:
Three cheers for Delta Tau
Delta. It's high time someone
put a stop to the rampant bo
hemianism that is sapping the
wholesome vitality of Stanford's
men and women. May this be a
warning and an example to the
shoeless and bearded who dis
grace the distinguished Stanford
tradition.
Adopting the spirit of the
precedent set last spring by the
Athletic Department, the Delts
have given student action to a
long-overflowing wealth of stu
dent words.

• 'Bitchin' RF's' ,
Editor, The Daily: \
Friday morning when I picked
up the Daily, I thought thai the
April Fools' issufc had com«out
early. The awesome trutH is
that some fraternities are! no
longer living groups whichlare
benefitting their members ow the
university community. If/this
institution is supposed to pre
pare us for life, the fraternities'
contribution in this regard is es
sentially negative. The "bitchin'
RF's" which fraternities seem
to laugh off as harmless would
result in jail sentences and cost
ly lawsuits if they were done
out in society.
The incident involving the
Delts and David Harris is the
most thoughtless event on the
campus since I have been here.
No person or group in this com
munity should have the right to
impose their values on anyone
else. If the Delts have an ob
jection to anyone in this com
munity or think (which is of
ten not done by Delts) that
something should be changed,
there are very many more ap
propriate means of protest than
the one they chose.
Last week fraternities stole
Beta Chi's front door in "honor"
of Beta Chi's open door policy,
pilfered 11,000 newspapers, at
tacked one of the most respected
people on the campus, painted
signs on various buildings, and
numerous other little pranks. It
is time that the fraternities eval

uate their role in this commu
nity. The negative aspects of the
fraternity system far outweigh
its few merits, and if this sys
tem is going to survive, it is
going to need to take steps to
ward becoming a benefit to
Stanford instead of continuing
in its decadence.
JHON TREAL
• IFC Goals
Editor, The Daily:
Now that the "new voice" of
Stanford's fraternities has made
itself apparent perhaps IFC
President Drennen Jones can
explain how its two latest mani
festations, the shearing of Mr.
Harris and the Great Daily
Robbery" relate to his organiza
tion's self-proclaimed "new em
phasis on the educational goals
of the fraternities." Perhaps at
least those freshmen who might
have been considering pledging
next spring have been "educat
ed" in the process.
DOUG SORENSEN
• Crew-Cut Gods
Editor, The Daily:
WHY? Have the Delts found
the perfect way of life ,and does
it revolve around a crew-cut
god? Certainly they cannot be
lieve that by cutting Mr. Harris'
hair they have converted him
to their philosophy of ties and
suits and kegs and anti-intellec
tualism. Are their beliefs based
on such a poor foundation that
must resort to strengthening it
with the hair of their enemies?
If while in the University a
person cannot be free from the
ethnocentric ties of society,
where can he find freedom? No,
I do not correlate long hair
with wisdom. But I must view
the Delts' action as extremely
unwise.
Joel Mcdonough
• Personal Affront
Editor, The Daily:
I am a staunchly wishy-washy
liberal. I dress neatly, wear
chinos and black loafers, and
shave every morning. But I re
sent as a personal affront the
fact that any student, while on
campus, should be set upon and
manhandled for his political be
liefs, his manner of dress and
grooming, or for God-knows
what reason such storm-trooper
tactics were practiced on Mr.
Harris.
Coming here from another
campus as a grad student, I
suppose it may be unfair of me
to draw comparisons, but where
I went to college, this sort of
thing was expected from town
yahoos and adolescents. That
it could be perpetrated by other
students is inconceivable to me.
But I understand that the boys
learned a lesson: "He really
showed the Delts a lot of class."
That's fine. I wish the Delts all
the joy of their nocturnal fun
and games, and propose that a
social worker be appointed to
work in close contact with them.
After all, juvenile delinquency
is purely a social disease.
I sincerely hope that the stu
dent body has not taken this
incident lightly. If it has, there
is a serious illness abroad.

• Levels Of Meaning
Editor, The Daily
But for the element of sheer
(pun intended, all you out there
in clodland) hilarity inherent in
the Delt ambush last Thursday,
I could content myself with
merely joining the inevitable
chorus of Decriers and Deplor
ers. But the episode veritably
teems with all the components
so dear to the heart of a topic
hungry English major. "Levels
of meaning!" it fairly screamed,
"Symbolism! Parody!" Names
like Joseph Heller, John Barth,
Nabokov flit to and fro across
my mind. For those less inclined
by natural bent or education to
appreciate the mechanics of such
instinctive analysis, I proffer this
humble attempt at logical class
ification.
The Daily's front-page photo,
of course, furnishes the broadest

and most obvious symbolic base.
Harris' counternance resembles,
as everyone noticed, an El Greco
Moses, or a popular religious-art
store Christ. Lest there be any
possibility of ambiguity, the
Delts felt it necessary to sit
upon Harris' outspread arms
and taped-together feet. Harris,
as one might expect, responded
with a gentle turn-the-other-tem
ple attitude. Not since Joe
Christmas has symbolism been
quite so bald
The Freudian overtones alone
are worthy of comparison with
the finest specimens of modern
parodic fiction, (cf. the shoot
ing scene of Lolita.) Clipping
someone else's hair is a classic
aggressive response to castra
tion anxiety (and is not social
castration ,in effect, what the
fraternities fear from Harris?).
But was it really necessary, one
asks, to perform the act in the
bushes? One blushes; this is
overdoing it.
We must not overlook the am
bush's historical context. On the

one hand we have the witty RF
of the Phi Delt's Daily hijack,
and on the other, the leaving-a
sinking-ship maneuver of the
Beta Chis. The three events rein
force and complement one an
other; they form, as it were, a
sort of Renaissance tryptych (to
borrow a phrase from a profes
sor of mine).
I must end this epistle with
an apology, for I fully agree
with John Barth that "Coinci
dence can often be a heavy
handed symbolizer. She seems,
at times, fairly to club one over
the head with significance." He
warns us not to "nibble at the
many tempting symbols" life
presents. The man of sophisti
cated perception, he says, will
only "smile uncomfortably and
walk away, reminding himself,
if he is wise, that good taste is,
after all, only a human inven
tion." An invention, one ruefully
notes, whose use on this campus
is something less than universal.
