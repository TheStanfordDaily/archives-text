# Which Way The Row?

The attack upon David Harris last Thursday
evening by thirty members of Delta Tau Delta
showed the incredible juvenility of the partici
pants in the affair. Juvenility in boys in excus
able. In grown men it is ridiculous, but in
adult members of a center of learning, juvenility
is neither excusable nor humorous.
We find it hard to imagine a single act which
might capsulize more antithetically all the qual
ities which a university seeks to promote. Re
spect for the individual, tolerance of ideas, a
critical approach, clarity of self-expression—in
one clandestince act the participants managed
to demonstrate their ignorance of each of these
qualities.
In a Daily Forum published last spring, the
Interfraternity Council President outlined a
theory that Stanford fraternities differed from
the national model in several ways. He con
tended, "Just as Stanford itself strives to differ
from most educational institutions, so do Stan
ford fraternities seek to escape from the nega
tive aspects of the Greek image."
Empirical evidence from the past week seems
to have weakened this theory. Whether or nut
it is correct to infer that the Greek system at
Stanford is subject to the same wholesale
criticisms of fraternities across the country,
Stanford fraternities must once again justify
their reason for being. It was President Sterling
who similarly challenged the fraternities sev
eral years ago at an IFC banquet when he said,
"An element of any institution must justify its
existence. If it cannot, it should not exist."
The tide of fraternity criticism has swelled
each year in advance of rush, and it has ebbed
just as assurdedly in its wake, with the result
that changes in the system have been more
vocal than real Yet no one has tackled the

larger question of the role of the fraternity in
relation to the University's goals.
The essence of the question is: How is the
fraternity system serving education and, more
particularly, the education of a whole person.
We do not think it is stretching a point to equate
the desire of student reformers for "total edu
cation" with the often sought diversity of fra
ternity living, with its emphasis on person as
well as academic concerns.
However in striving for this goal, the fra
ternity system has cut itself off from the rest
of the campus—not necessarily by its selective
procedures, but by the fact that the community
life of a fraternity frequently does not extend
beyond the fraternity. The expansion of Beta
Chi points directly to an awareness of isolation
from the rest of the University community
which restricts the talents of the members
while it also deprives the community of the
benefits of these talents.
Some critics assert that certain procedures
within the system itself are unconducive to
fostering broad education. The recent IFC
hostel approached the issue of rush and rec
ognized the need for "a new voice." However
a new voice in a tired institution does little if
that institution cannot rely upon its merits
rather than the marketability thereof.
The outrage of David Harris is surely not
the conclusive argument in the case for the
fraternity's right to exist as a part of an edu
cational environment. Yet suppression of nega
tive aspects of the system is not a sufficient
reason for its maintenance. Stanford's fraterni
ties have yet to provide a definitive answer for
their existence. The question has been resting
quietly, but it can go unanswered no longer.
