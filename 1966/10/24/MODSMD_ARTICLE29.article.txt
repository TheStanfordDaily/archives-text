## 'Off' Petition Allows A Choice 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
Pat Aram is lucky. Were most
Stanford undergraduate women
as well adjusted to dorm life
there would be no movement to
change the policy which requires
us to live on campus. Her "ro
mantic" wish to preserve certain
traditions on campus is perhaps
rare, but valid. Unfortunately,
these traditions are being de
stroyed within the dorm by
women who are not as well
suited to oncampus living as Pat
is. Were the girls who wished to
allowed to move out of the
dorm, it would become a much
more happy, harmonious, tra
dition-cherishing place. Why not
let those malcontents weed
themselves out?
Also, "OFF!" is not a front
for proving women are equal
to men. This is not the question,
and hasn't been since the nine
teenth amendment was passed.
The fact that we share wth men
the right to live off campus if
we so choose, a right which is
overlooked by present policy, is
merely one argument for get
ting the policy changed.
But, I, speaking personally.

don't like being required to live
in a dorm.
So, Pat, we are very different
people. But I am not requiring
YOU to live off-campus. Why do
you want to require ME to live
on? Why does anybody for that
matter?

Editor, The Daily:
None of us can deny that our
university years are special, but
their special-ness is relative, and
the memories we cherish vary
lenptAipui oj psnpiAipux uiojj
Miss Aram's romanticism is
touching, but there are those on
campus who do not share this
sentimental view of life at Stan
ford. For this reason, her value
judgment on what and what not
is a worthwhile part of college
activity should not be inflicted
upon those who do not share the
same likes and dislikes. Certain
ly the enjoyment of 10:30
spreads, talks with friends and
decorating for homecoming
should not be underrated. Like
wise. the non-enjoyment of these

activities should not be denied.
We cannot hope, or should we
even desire, that all women on
campus should value the same
experiences in college.
Thus, Miss Aram has com
pletely misinterpreted the prob
lem. The question is not a pers
onal one: when we signed Janet
Howell's petition we were not
saying that we ourselves de
sired to live off-campus, but
merely that if anyone wants to,
she may.
Also, to brand the "Off!"
movement as merely an excuse
for a massive women's rights
movement is making grossly un
fair inferences. Certainly the
ever-present Stanford Double
Standard is an aspect of the is
sue, yet there is a great propor
tion of women on campus who
are genuinely eager to live in a
residence other than that of a
dorm situation, not because men
have the right and they don't,
but simply because they feel
there are advantages to this
type of life.

Miss Aram's romanticism is
touching, but there are those on
campus who do not share this
sentimental view of life at Stan
ford. For this reason, her value
judgment on what and what not
is a worthwhile part of college
activity should not be inflicted
upon those who do not share the
same likes and dislikes. Certain
ly the enjoyment of 10:30
spreads, talks with friends and
decorating for homecoming
should not be underrated. Like
wise. the non-enjoyment of these

activities should not be denied.
We cannot hope, or should we
even desire, that all women on
campus should value the same
experiences in college.
Thus, Miss Aram has com
pletely misinterpreted the prob
lem. The question is not a pers

Howell's petition we were not
saying that we ourselves de
sired to live off-campus, but
merely that if anyone wants to,
she may.
Also, to brand the "Off!"
movement as merely an excuse
for a massive women's rights
movement is making grossly un
fair inferences. Certainly the
ever-present Stanford Double
Standard is an aspect of the is
sue, yet there is a great propor
tion of women on campus who
are genuinely eager to live in a
residence other than that of a
dorm situation, not because men
have the right and they don't,
but simply because they feel
there are advantages to this
type of life.

Pat Aram is lucky. Were most
Stanford undergraduate women
as well adjusted to dorm life
there would be no movement to
change the policy which requires
us to live on campus. Her "ro
mantic" wish to preserve certain
traditions on campus is perhaps
rare, but valid. Unfortunately,
these traditions are being de
stroyed within the dorm by
women who are not as well
