# Cro-Mem Wins Lag Seca
## 
### 
The 4th Annual Lagunita-Seca
Races, held yesterday on the dry bed
of Lake Lagunita, appeared as no
thing so much as an automotive odys
sey. Sponsored by Delta Kappa Epsi
lon and Zeta Psi fraternities, it in
corporated the best features of a
circus and the Indianapolis 500.
At first glance, the race course
seemed a certain wrecking ground
for any vehicle foolish enough to at
tempt it. Each car drove over a ditch,
through several curves, took a jump
over a dirt mound, turned around,
took a second jump, weaved through
tire obstacles, and sprinted to the
finish.
However, most of the cars managed
to negotiate the course without seri
ous difficulty or damage. The cars
themselves ran the gamut from dune
buggy to jeep to distant approxima
tion of conventional stock vehicle.
The Daily talked to Bob Hatch of
Deke to learn theorganization of the
three racing classes:
• Stock — American engines and
bodies.

• Powder Puff — American cars
with female pilots.
• Sports—any and all foreign cars.
Each car was allowed two runs
over the course, with the best time
being lsed for final standings.
In the main even, the American
Division, Crothers Memorial Hall took
first place for the second consecutive
year. John Arrington, driver of the
Cro. Mem. machine (a modified '56
Buick), was also at the wheel in last
year's Crothers victory. Said Jon
Taenzer, chief of the Crothers pit
crew, of Arrington, "We just build the
car and let him win."
Chi Psi fraternity ended the day
with a double victory in the Sports
Car and Powder Puff Division. Their
37-h.p. Morris Minor, driven by Dave
Webster, copped top honors in the
Sports Car Division ;and Missy Gose
of Stillman House drove a Chi Psi
'52 Chevy to victroy in Powder Puff.
Each of the winners received for
their efforts a keg of Coors from spon
sors Deke and Zeta Psi.
