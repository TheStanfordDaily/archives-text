### Mike Couzens 
Do men gather grapes of
thorns or figs of thistles?
Wherefore by their fruits ye
shall know them.
Matt. 7:16, 20
Consider the Rushbook, 1965;
Delta Tau Delta:
"The Delt House at Stanford
manifests what we feel is the
ideal of the Stanford fraternity.
Delts share a strong common
bond of brotherhood and at the
same time respect their broth
ers' individuality.
"Delts contribute to the Stan
ford community in many ways.
They are probably best known
for their achievements in ath
letics . . .
"The individual's academic
best is paramount in the Delt
House. Aid in any course is
easily obtainable due to a great
diversity of academic interests
and majors.
"Cultural experience is aug
mented by guest speakers and
a box at the San Francisco Sym
phony which is filled weekly.
Social Traditions
"Social events are closely tied
to traditions including initiation,
Punch Pinero, the Sexiest Girl
in the World, the Roman Orgy
and the 49'ers parties.
"We also enjoy the setting in
which we live â€” we are sure
you will appreciate the beauty
of our 'shelter' and we look for
ward to the opportunity to try
to convey to you the atmos

phere of Delta Tau Delta that
pervades this shelter."
Phi Delis
Consider the Rushbook 1965;
Phi Delta Theta:
"We are looking for the type
of rushee who likes to have a
good time but who also has the
maturity and responsibility to
act as a functioning part of the
strong bond that has been
created by Phi Delts for the last
118 years.
"Brotherhood is a serious
thing which clearly manifests it
self in the support of a brother
in an athletic event, 100 per cent
participation in building a home
coming decoration, or helping
a brother who has found trouble
at an A & W restaurant.
A Man's Castle
"We of Phi Delta Theta, en
joying the epicurean-Spartan
way of life, feel that within our
castle there exists a feeling of
Brotherhood not found in the
large majority of living groups
on campus.
"A question arises when one
attempts to categorizes the
'type' of person that has pledged
to Stanford's chapter of Phi
Delta Theta.
"We all realize that studies
are synonymous with Stanford
but we of Phi Delta Theta firm
ly believe that a total education
cannot be acquired through
books alone."
Consider the Rushbook, 1966.
