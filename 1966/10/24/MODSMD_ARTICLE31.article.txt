## Assaulters Unmask Traditional Conflict 
### Mike Collins 
The first thing that should be
made clear is that what happen
ed Thursday night was a very
pathetic thing, humorous in a
perverse sort of way but pa
thetic nevertheless. It is not
something that one should get
too emotionally outraged about,
because it was not totally unex
pected within the context it oc
cured. It was the natural exten
sion of a value conflict that has
existed for some time and could
only culminate in an irrational
manner because of its irrational
nature. It evolved from a con
cept of group or majority tyran
ny, those that feel they and only
they are right, they are the law.
Pouting Child
The second thing that should
be made quite clear is that any
one who thinks of the incident
as being just another Stanford
student who had his head shaved
by a bunch of hell raisers is
missing the whole point. The
point is that Dave Harris repre
sented values and a way of liv
ing and thinking that the insti
tution of fraternities could not
stand.
Planned Attack
The really frightening thing
is that the incident was not
spontaneous, but had been plan
ned for weeks. Harris' picture
was placed on the house bulletin
board, and the attack was plan
ned to take place at Hurlburt's
"Hero Party". And it did not
stop with the attack on Dave
Harris. The reporter who cov
ered the story was tracked by a
number of Delts and threats
have been made against him.
Perhaps the lowest and most
despicable action involves the
meeting of a number of frater
nity men to make plans on
tracking Dave Harris to catch
him with LSD (you know,
people with beards use LSD,
frat men never do), or go to the
police and help them raid Dave
Harris' house (perhaps plant
something?) in hopes that he

would be arrested in order to
discredit him.
Without getting involved in a
polemic, one must recognize
that there is something basically
very sick here, and it is not just
isolated at the Delt house. The
simple answer would be to sus
pend the individuals involved.
But this would be a large mis
take for two reasons. For one,
suspension rarely does anyone
any good, it neither prevents ac
tions nor helps individuals, who
need help most at the time they
are suspended. In the second
place, and more importantly,
suspension in this case would
miss the whole point. It is the
solution that would be favored
by the pro-fraternity people who
are unable to tolerate this sort
of behavior. The theory is that
you cut out the bad apples and
everything will be all right
again. But the Delts as indivi
duals are not evil. The real ques
tion is what sort of living situa
tion could evolve into this sort
of thinking (or non-thinking, as
the case may be).
Reform
It is argued that fraternities
can be reformed, but this does
not seem to be the case. The
Delts have always been pointed
to by the administration as what
"a positive and constructive fra
ternity situation could do for
an individual." In fact, almost
at the very moment that the
thirty Delts were holding a paci
fest to the ground by sitting on
his arms and taping his legs to
gether, Dean Hanson was argu
ing in favor of fraternities to
the Housing Commission: "Now
take the Delts; they're dif
ferent."
In conclusion, I would ask
that we stop deluding ourselves.
What the Delts did any of a doz
en different fraternities could
have and would have done if
they had thought of it. The rest
will support the Delts to the
end, arid it seems that that par
ticular time has come.
