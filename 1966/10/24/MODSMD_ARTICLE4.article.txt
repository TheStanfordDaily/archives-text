# Administration, Fraternities Condemn Harris Shavers; Case Sent To Council
## 
### HENRY MULLER News Editor 
Dean of Students H. Donald Win
bigler announced last night that he
has referred the Dave Harris head
shaving case to Judicial Council.
The decision followed consultation
between the student judiciary and the
dean's office. The Council will meet
informally tonight to decide exactly
how it will conduct its investigation.
Two deans have strongly condemn
ed the incident.
Associate Dean Joel Smith said,
"This despicable incident makes me
sad and angry. David Harris is a con
scientious, sensitive student leader
who has earnestly expressed an ex
citing vision about students within
the University.
Automatic Approval
"He neither seeks nor obtains auto
matic approval for his ideas, but his
right to express those ideas is funda
mental.
"The attack on him would be in
admissible in any civilized society;
within a university it is incredible."
According to Dean of Students H
Donald Winbigler, the shaving was
"very unforunate."

Martin Gerry, member ol the Judi
cial Council, told The Daily yesterday
that the incident "is obviously a vio.
lation of the Fundamental Standard
and will be treated as such."
He emphasized that the case was
not being referred to the Interfrater
nity Judicial Board because prosecu
tion would be against individuals and
not against any entire house.
Members of Delta Tau Delta fra
ternity told The Daily Thursday night
that they took part in the shaving.
According to Delt President Bill Hog
bom, however, the shaving was not an
official house effort and many mem
bers of the house did not even know
about it beforehand.
Hogbom said that some members
of his house considered it a serious
protest against Stanford's image,
while others were "simply caught
up in the spontaneity of the thing."
He said that for some it showed a
rejection of Dave Harris' well-pub
licized views on fratenities and athletic
scholarships.
Hogbom said that he did not think
the attack on Dave Harris was either
personal or malicious. As exam-pies,
he cited the fact that Harris' beard

was not shaved off and that his at
tackers offered him a cigarette while
they sheared his head.

We, as individuals, deplore the

"He neither seeks nor obtains auto

"The attack on him would be in
admissible in any civilized society;

According to Dean of Students H
Donald Winbigler, the shaving was
"very unforunate."

Martin Gerry, member ol the Judi
cial Council, told The Daily yesterday
that the incident "is obviously a vio.
lation of the Fundamental Standard
and will be treated as such."
He emphasized that the case was
not being referred to the Interfrater
nity Judicial Board because prosecu
tion would be against individuals and
not against any entire house.
Members of Delta Tau Delta fra
ternity told The Daily Thursday night
that they took part in the shaving.
According to Delt President Bill Hog
bom, however, the shaving was not an
official house effort and many mem
bers of the house did not even know
about it beforehand.
Hogbom said that some members
of his house considered it a serious
protest against Stanford's image,
while others were "simply caught
up in the spontaneity of the thing."
He said that for some it showed a
rejection of Dave Harris' well-pub
licized views on fratenities and athletic
scholarships.
Hogbom said that he did not think
the attack on Dave Harris was either
personal or malicious. As exam-pies,
he cited the fact that Harris' beard

was not shaved off and that his at
tackers offered him a cigarette while
they sheared his head.
