Stanford faculty members raised
theilr voices in protest against Ron
ald Reagan's proposal to investigate
the administration of the University
of California at Berkeley. The protest
came in the form of a letter mailed
to the San Francisco Chronicle last
week.

In the letter, 243 faculty members
protested against Reagan's plans in
what they called "an effort to save
the University of California from in
calculable harm."
The faculty members objected to
Reagan's bringing the administration
of the University of California into
the turmoil of politics. They pointed

out that Cal, operating under the con
trol of a Board of Regents established
by the State Constitution which in
sulates it from political pressure, has
become one of the world's greatest
universities.
The professors stated that, "While
many of us deplore the antics of the
more extreme members of the Berke
ley fringe—mainly non-students—we
feel them to be of little importance
as compared with the enormous dam
age certain to follow a politically
inspired 'investigation* of the Univer
sity."
The faculty members also objected
because they feel that such an in
vestigation would put both the fac
ulty members and administratiors at
Berkeley under constant pressure
from legislators and other outside
pressure groups. Such pressure would
greatly hinder the University's in
dependence.
The faculty members also pointed
out that such an investigation and the
resulting pressures on the professors
at Berkeley would cause many of the
best faculty members to leave and
deter new ones from coming. This de
terication of the faculty would cause
the University of California to de
generate into a mediocre school.
One of the signees of the letter to
the Chronicle, Dr. Reder of the Eco
nomics Department, stated that the
investigation which Reagan proposes
would be loaded, and that Berkeley
would not even have the benefit of
a fair trial. He also pointed out that
the Board of Regents of the Univer
sity of California has already con
ducted their own investigation of the
Berkeley administration, and the ma
jority of the Board has given Berkr
leyley a vote of confidence. Reder went
on to say that he could not see any
good that might come from an investi
gation now, but '.hat an investigation
would probably do great harm.
Dr. John W. Doods, another signee
of the Chronicle letter, criticized what
he called "an irresponsible attack" of
Reagan's against the University of
California. He added that he felt that
it was a poor idea of Reagan's to drag
Berkeley into a political campaign.
The faculty members ended their
letter with a plea to all citizens to
condemn Reagan's proposed investi
gation of Cal. They concluded, "Re
sponsibility for governing the Uni
versity must remain where the Consti
tution placed it: with the Board of
Regpnts."
