# IJB To Hear Appeal Of 'Hours' Test Case
## 
### KIRK HANSON Managing Editor 
Dean H. Donald Winbigler ha 6 ap
pealed the decision of the ASSU Judi
cial Council in the Open House test
case of Michael Couzens and Charlotte
Ackerley.
The two were acquited last week in
a decision in which the student Judi
cial Council ruled that the lack of en
forcement of open house policy in
men's residences was an "implicit in
terpretation of University regula
tions."
Acting as the University's repre
sentative in the judicial process, Dean
Winbigler appealed to the Interim
Judicial Body (IJB) composed of
faculty and administration. He ques
tioned the Judicial Council's conclu
sion that no conflict exists between
University nd LASSU regulations.
Defendants Surprised
Both defendants expressed surprise
of the action when notified by mail
Saturday. Michael Couzens last night
told The Daily: "I don't understand
why he appealed. In terms of the
Open house situation, the appeal does
n't matter.
"Our case has become an anachron
ism. It was intended last spring to
clarify the policy which now has al
ready been clarified."
Dean Winbigler last night declined
to elaborate on the issues involved,
but stated that the Judicial Compe
tence Bill, enacted last year, calls for
an appeal to the "alternate tribunal"
when there is a conflict of law. That
alternate body Is the IJB.
Dr. Joseph T. Sneed. Chairman of
the IJB said last night it is now un
certain when the Body will meet to
review the case.

Current University policy permits
women in men's residences on Wed
nesday and Friday evenings only,
while ASSU regulations sanction open
houses at the discretion of each living
group.
The Committee of 15 is now study
ing the open house policy and has
given tentative approval to a standard
even more liberal than that requested
by LASSU.
Dean Winbigler said last night that
the passage of more liberal open
house hours by the Committee of 15
or the Trustees would not eliminate
the Couzens case. "The case origi
nated last spring under the old
policy," he said.
Appeal Criticized
A member of the ASSU Judicial
Council yesterday had criticisms of
the appeal. Joel Kugelmass told The
Daily he agreed with the Judicial
Council's majority decision that a
"law that isn't enforced, doesn't
exist."
He went on to speak of the effect
of the formation last year of the IJB:
"The formation of the IJB has weak
ened the ASSU Judicial Body. If they
like what we are doing, we are very
strong; if they don't like it, we are
weak."
Kugelmass emphasized the differ
once between normal cases that come
before the Judicial procedure and
cases like the Couzens case and the
sit-in case: "Since both are acts of
conscience, this is a new kind of crime
and anti-social act. The formulation
of laws and procedures is in a forma
tive stage. Considerations of the kind
will have strong implications for ac
tivism and University policy.

to elaborate on the issues involved,
but stated that the Judicial Compe
tence Bill, enacted last year, calls for
an appeal to the "alternate tribunal"
when there is a conflict of law. That
alternate body Is the IJB.
Dr. Joseph T. Sneed. Chairman of
the IJB said last night it is now un
certain when the Body will meet to
review the case.

Current University policy permits
women in men's residences on Wed
nesday and Friday evenings only,
while ASSU regulations sanction open
houses at the discretion of each living
group.
The Committee of 15 is now study
ing the open house policy and has
given tentative approval to a standard
even more liberal than that requested
by LASSU.
Dean Winbigler said last night that
the passage of more liberal open
house hours by the Committee of 15
or the Trustees would not eliminate
the Couzens case. "The case origi
nated last spring under the old
policy," he said.
Appeal Criticized
A member of the ASSU Judicial
Council yesterday had criticisms of
the appeal. Joel Kugelmass told The
Daily he agreed with the Judicial
Council's majority decision that a
"law that isn't enforced, doesn't
exist."
He went on to speak of the effect
of the formation last year of the IJB:
"The formation of the IJB has weak
ened the ASSU Judicial Body. If they
like what we are doing, we are very
strong; if they don't like it, we are
weak."
Kugelmass emphasized the differ
once between normal cases that come
before the Judicial procedure and
cases like the Couzens case and the
sit-in case: "Since both are acts of
conscience, this is a new kind of crime
and anti-social act. The formulation
of laws and procedures is in a forma
tive stage. Considerations of the kind
will have strong implications for ac
tivism and University policy.
Dean H. Donald Winbigler ha 6 ap
pealed the decision of the ASSU Judi
cial Council in the Open House test
case of Michael Couzens and Charlotte
Ackerley.
The two were acquited last week in
a decision in which the student Judi
cial Council ruled that the lack of en
forcement of open house policy in
men's residences was an "implicit in
terpretation of University regula
tions."
Acting as the University's repre
sentative in the judicial process, Dean
Winbigler appealed to the Interim
Judicial Body (IJB) composed of
faculty and administration. He ques
tioned the Judicial Council's conclu
sion that no conflict exists between
University nd LASSU regulations.
Defendants Surprised
Both defendants expressed surprise
of the action when notified by mail
Saturday. Michael Couzens last night
told The Daily: "I don't understand
why he appealed. In terms of the
Open house situation, the appeal does
n't matter.
"Our case has become an anachron
ism. It was intended last spring to
clarify the policy which now has al
ready been clarified."
