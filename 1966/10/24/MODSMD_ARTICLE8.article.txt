# Professional 'Hell Can Be Heaven
## 'Shaw' Revived At Tangent 
### DAVID HAKKEN 
There are few experiences in
theater as enjoyable as watching
George Bernard Shaw per
formed well. "Don Juan in Hell,"
the often forgotten third act of
Shaw's "Man and Superman,"
demands both professional skill
and versatility.
The players of The Ensemble
Theatre at the Tangent in Palo
Alto interpret Don Juan in a
successfully professional man
ner. At the same time they are
able to communicate a simple
yet enjoyable love of theater.
This production of Don Juan
is an attempt of the Ensemble
players, members of The Illegiti
mate Theatre at the Tangent to
present legitimate theater in
their own unique style. The thea
trical interests of the group, con
tent to word with small
ences and the intimate atmo

sphere of the Tangent, are as
much academic (four of the six
players are teachers in drama)
as strictly professional.
This does not mean that the
presentation was in any way
amateur, but that the perform
ers displayed a thoroughly pro
fessional desire to improvise in
characterization, demanding au
dience assistance, and no great
fear of failure. "Don Juan" is a
logical extention for the play
ers if The Illegitimate Theatre,
which presents material similar
to that of The Committee, al
though without previous re*
hearsal.
The play itself presents sev
eral difficulties for any perform*
ing group. "Don Juan in Hell"
is an integral part of "Man and
Superman." Although able to
exist separate from the rest of
the play, as the Ensemble pet

formance proved, it is perhaps
only within the context of the
whole drama that Don Juan
Tenoria's conversation with the
devil, an eloquent public rela
tions man, Dona Ana de Uioa,
piously disappointed to find her
self in hell, and her father, a
vain commander turned statue,
becomes as intelligible as Shaw
intended.
Perhaps this is the cause of
the distance existing between
audience and players at the be
ginning of Wednesday's per
formance. A less formal ap
proach to the beginning of the
play might mitigate this prob
lem, were it not for another
difficulty in Don Juan, the for
mality of Shaw's language.
Much of the play, as Shaw him
self points out often in the dia
logue, is presented as speeches,
an attempt at presenting Shav
ian philosophy in a persuasive
form.
Avoids Tedium
It is perhaps the greatest com
pliment to both Shaw and the
Ensemble that together they
were able to avoid the tedium
of philosophical argument. Shaw
himself interupts the argumen
tative dialogue so often that the
audience is never sure how seri
ous he really is, a technique
which maintains a perspective
for the audience both entertain
ing and helpful in following his
ideas. The choice by the players
of the dramatic reading form re
quires the viewer to build for
himself a stage for the acute ob
servations about life, woman,
war, and hell which fill the play.
Philip Schultz's portrayal of
Don Juan was the outstanding
aspect of the performance. Al
though aloof from the dialogue
in the beginning of the play, Mr.
Schultz soon became actively in
terested in Shaw's argument and
tempered his reserve with per
ceptive interest and conviction.
It was impossible to attend
this performance without be
coming involved in the play. Per
haps this involvement is a re
sult of the attitude toward thea
ter of the players themselves,
who seemingly act for the joy
and excitement of intimate dia
logue with an audience. The
stark simplicity of staging also
demands active participation
from the viewer. There were sev
eral occasions when I almost
stopped one of the players to
question his argument.
Planning Tapes And Tours
In addition to a performance
of "Don Juan" each Wednes
day night through December 7,
and The Illegitimate Theatre on
weekends, the players are ar
ranging tapes of their work with
KQED, channel 9, for broadcast
within the next few months. Or
ganized onl ya year ago, the
players are also planning to
tour the state junior college sys
tem with "Don Juan." The en
thusiasm of the group is at
tractive and the professional ac
complishments superb. I almost
saw George Bernard Shaw in
the back of the Tangent, chuck
ling to himself.

ers if The Illegitimate Theatre,
which presents material similar
to that of The Committee, al
though without previous re*
hearsal.
The play itself presents sev
eral difficulties for any perform*
ing group. "Don Juan in Hell"
is an integral part of "Man and
Superman." Although able to
exist separate from the rest of
the play, as the Ensemble pet

formance proved, it is perhaps
only within the context of the
whole drama that Don Juan
Tenoria's conversation with the
devil, an eloquent public rela
tions man, Dona Ana de Uioa,
piously disappointed to find her
self in hell, and her father, a
vain commander turned statue,
becomes as intelligible as Shaw
intended.
Perhaps this is the cause of
the distance existing between
audience and players at the be
ginning of Wednesday's per
formance. A less formal ap
proach to the beginning of the
play might mitigate this prob
lem, were it not for another
difficulty in Don Juan, the for
mality of Shaw's language.
Much of the play, as Shaw him
self points out often in the dia
logue, is presented as speeches,
an attempt at presenting Shav
ian philosophy in a persuasive
form.
Avoids Tedium
It is perhaps the greatest com
pliment to both Shaw and the
Ensemble that together they
were able to avoid the tedium
of philosophical argument. Shaw
himself interupts the argumen
tative dialogue so often that the
audience is never sure how seri
ous he really is, a technique
which maintains a perspective
for the audience both entertain
ing and helpful in following his
ideas. The choice by the players
of the dramatic reading form re
quires the viewer to build for
himself a stage for the acute ob
servations about life, woman,
war, and hell which fill the play.
Philip Schultz's portrayal of
Don Juan was the outstanding
aspect of the performance. Al
though aloof from the dialogue
in the beginning of the play, Mr.
Schultz soon became actively in
terested in Shaw's argument and
tempered his reserve with per
ceptive interest and conviction.
It was impossible to attend
this performance without be
coming involved in the play. Per
haps this involvement is a re
sult of the attitude toward thea
ter of the players themselves,
who seemingly act for the joy
and excitement of intimate dia
logue with an audience. The
stark simplicity of staging also
demands active participation
from the viewer. There were sev
eral occasions when I almost
stopped one of the players to
question his argument.
Planning Tapes And Tours
In addition to a performance
of "Don Juan" each Wednes
day night through December 7,
and The Illegitimate Theatre on
weekends, the players are ar
ranging tapes of their work with
KQED, channel 9, for broadcast
within the next few months. Or
ganized onl ya year ago, the
players are also planning to
tour the state junior college sys
tem with "Don Juan." The en
thusiasm of the group is at
tractive and the professional ac
complishments superb. I almost
saw George Bernard Shaw in
the back of the Tangent, chuck
ling to himself.
There are few experiences in
theater as enjoyable as watching
George Bernard Shaw per
formed well. "Don Juan in Hell,"
the often forgotten third act of
Shaw's "Man and Superman,"
demands both professional skill
and versatility.
The players of The Ensemble
Theatre at the Tangent in Palo
Alto interpret Don Juan in a
successfully professional man
ner. At the same time they are
able to communicate a simple
yet enjoyable love of theater.
This production of Don Juan
is an attempt of the Ensemble
players, members of The Illegiti
mate Theatre at the Tangent to
present legitimate theater in
their own unique style. The thea
trical interests of the group, con
tent to word with small
ences and the intimate atmo

sphere of the Tangent, are as
much academic (four of the six
players are teachers in drama)
as strictly professional.
This does not mean that the
presentation was in any way
amateur, but that the perform
ers displayed a thoroughly pro
fessional desire to improvise in
characterization, demanding au
dience assistance, and no great
fear of failure. "Don Juan" is a
logical extention for the play
ers if The Illegitimate Theatre,
which presents material similar

form.
Avoids Tedium
It is perhaps the greatest com
pliment to both Shaw and the
Ensemble that together they
were able to avoid the tedium
of philosophical argument. Shaw
himself interupts the argumen
tative dialogue so often that the
audience is never sure how seri
ous he really is, a technique
which maintains a perspective
for the audience both entertain
ing and helpful in following his
ideas. The choice by the players
of the dramatic reading form re
quires the viewer to build for
himself a stage for the acute ob
servations about life, woman,
war, and hell which fill the play.
Philip Schultz's portrayal of
Don Juan was the outstanding
aspect of the performance. Al
though aloof from the dialogue
in the beginning of the play, Mr.
Schultz soon became actively in
terested in Shaw's argument and
tempered his reserve with per
ceptive interest and conviction.
It was impossible to attend
this performance without be
coming involved in the play. Per
haps this involvement is a re
sult of the attitude toward thea
ter of the players themselves,
who seemingly act for the joy
and excitement of intimate dia
logue with an audience. The
stark simplicity of staging also
demands active participation
from the viewer. There were sev
eral occasions when I almost
stopped one of the players to
question his argument.
Planning Tapes And Tours
In addition to a performance
of "Don Juan" each Wednes
day night through December 7,
and The Illegitimate Theatre on
weekends, the players are ar
ranging tapes of their work with
KQED, channel 9, for broadcast
within the next few months. Or
ganized onl ya year ago, the
players are also planning to
tour the state junior college sys
tem with "Don Juan." The en
thusiasm of the group is at
tractive and the professional ac
complishments superb. I almost
saw George Bernard Shaw in
the back of the Tangent, chuck
ling to himself.
There are few experiences in
theater as enjoyable as watching
George Bernard Shaw per
formed well. "Don Juan in Hell,"
the often forgotten third act of
Shaw's "Man and Superman,"
demands both professional skill
and versatility.
The players of The Ensemble
Theatre at the Tangent in Palo
Alto interpret Don Juan in a
successfully professional man
ner. At the same time they are
able to communicate a simple
yet enjoyable love of theater.
This production of Don Juan
is an attempt of the Ensemble
players, members of The Illegiti
mate Theatre at the Tangent to
present legitimate theater in
their own unique style. The thea
trical interests of the group, con
tent to word with small
ences and the intimate atmo

sphere of the Tangent, are as
much academic (four of the six
players are teachers in drama)
as strictly professional.
This does not mean that the
presentation was in any way
amateur, but that the perform
ers displayed a thoroughly pro
fessional desire to improvise in
characterization, demanding au
dience assistance, and no great
fear of failure. "Don Juan" is a
logical extention for the play
ers if The Illegitimate Theatre,
which presents material similar
to that of The Committee, al
though without previous re*
hearsal.
The play itself presents sev
eral difficulties for any perform*
ing group. "Don Juan in Hell"
is an integral part of "Man and
Superman." Although able to
exist separate from the rest of
the play, as the Ensemble pet

formance proved, it is perhaps
only within the context of the
whole drama that Don Juan
Tenoria's conversation with the
devil, an eloquent public rela
tions man, Dona Ana de Uioa,
piously disappointed to find her
self in hell, and her father, a
vain commander turned statue,
becomes as intelligible as Shaw
intended.
Perhaps this is the cause of
the distance existing between
audience and players at the be
ginning of Wednesday's per
formance. A less formal ap
proach to the beginning of the
play might mitigate this prob
lem, were it not for another
difficulty in Don Juan, the for
mality of Shaw's language.
Much of the play, as Shaw him
self points out often in the dia
logue, is presented as speeches,
an attempt at presenting Shav
ian philosophy in a persuasive
form.
