# Boards Unrepresentative' Hinder Change'

(Last in a series)
Many of the practices and much of the struc
ture of boards of trustees tends to prohibit
rather than to foster the proper relation be
tween the board and the university.
This concluding article will summarize criti
cisms of boards and will present a tentative
solution answering these criticisms.
The principal criticisms of boards are that:
1) the boards, although composed of laymen
and therefore theoretically representing so
ciety to the university, are actually very un
representative; and 2) the composition of the
board gives the university a built-in hindrance
to change.
These factors, critics say, stem from the
fact that the board is made up of the old,
the rich ,and the conservative. Control of
boards now rests with business leaders, "the
modern representatives of orthodoxy and au
thority" (report of the special trustees com
mittee of Columbia University, 1957).
A Dominant Class
Because a dominant class is one favored
by the existing social arrangement, members
of boards of trustees "tend to be conservative,

to exaggerate the merits of the prevailing or
der and to fear any agitation favoring funda
mental changes in the social structure"
(George Counts).
There is also some fear that boards are too
old to sympathize with student needs and de
mands.
Structurally, these problems are reflected in
the facts that the average trustee is over 60,
the terms of office are too long, and board
membership is too limited, namely to the
upper few per cent of the population (accord
ing to income studies, occupations, and educa
tion).
Unresponsive To Control
Also criticized is the selection procedure,
choosing new members by vote of the remain
ing members of the board. This method, called
co-option, is objected to on the grounds that
it tends to promote a board remote from and
unresponsive to popular control, control by
constituents or external controls of any type.
Other objections to the current system are:
• An almost total lack of background and
experience in teaching, research, and educa
tional administration—"the processes that con
stitute the central core of higher education"

(Hubert Beck, Men Who Control Our Univer
sities).
• An apparent lack of members familiar
with the subject-matter fields that come under
their jurisdiction.
• Limitation of board membership to the
privileged classes tends to "destroy public
confidence in the disinterested nature of board
decisions and in the extent to which higher
education serves the public interest" (Beck).
One possible hoard structure which could
be built by integrating all the elements pre
sented in these articles would be a board
made up partially out of representative mem
bers of the public and partially out of uni
versity representatives.
Such a board would most fully exemplify
the proper relation of the board to the insti
tution and, in turn, of the institution to society.
That is, the function of the board is to
facilitate the work of the university, which is
to transmit the knowledge, values, and skills
of society to the new generation and to criti
cally evaluate the culture being transmitted.
Balance Of Functions
It would seem that only through a system
in which there is membership both from the

academic community and the society at large
can the university, through its highest govern
ing body, insure a balance between the service
function to society of transmission of the
culture, and the critical function of culture
evaluation.
The board modification here suggested would
provide for a broader representation of so
ciety's interests, perhaps by functional repre
sentation.
In addition it would include a double board
structure in which the business management
and endowment problems were handled by a
small body which was responsible to a larger
board. The larger board, once freed of fidu
ciary details, could concentrate on the real
task of the board: "in the establishment of a
college, the organization of a learned and
effective faculty" (Columbia trustees' report,
1957).
Long Range Policy
Such a board would be able to give pri
mary attention to long range policy and would
embody in its consensus a balance between
society's interests and those of the acade
micians.
The public sector would be far more rep

resentative than it is now, because it would*
for example, include educators, social scien
tists, professional men, and representatives of
labor.
One model (by Hubert Beck) which has been
developed along the lines presented in this
article suggests a board of thirteen members,
of which eight would be representatives of
the public (two each from business, the pro
fessions, agriculture, and labor) and five from
the university (two each from the faculty and
alumni, and one representative of the stu
dents).
Besides the membership modifications air
ready suggested, the solution here presented
would include the adoption of age and tenure
limitations to assure that: 1) the needs and
point of view of youth, for whom the institu
tion exists to serve, are understood and that
2) the board is sufficiently flexible to provide
the adjustments necessary to changing eco
nomic and social conditions.
The inclusion of academic advisory boards
completes the solution: a system responsive
to the educational needs of both the publfc
and the university, and one in which conv
munication exists to foster that responsive*
ness.
