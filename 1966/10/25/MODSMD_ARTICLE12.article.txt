Hugh McElhenny, Washington's greatest halfback,
is shown here eluding a tackle against Stanford in
1949. In spite of the great runner, Stanford de
stroyed Washington 40-0. This year's first string
runner was suspended last week for the remainder
of the season for breaking training. Stanford will
host the Huskies this weekend, after sufl'ering de
struction last year up north, 41-8.
