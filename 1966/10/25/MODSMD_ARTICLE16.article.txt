# Despite Upset Of Illini
## Stanford In AAWU Basement 
### 
Stanford's lack of victories
this season is reflected in the
poor showing in AAWU statis
tics, which finds Stanford near
the bottom in all categories.
With no points against the Illini,
Bill Shoemaker fell to eighth
place in scoring with 25 points.
He is now 31 behind leader

Mel Farr of UCLA. In total of
fense Gene Washington remains
in the fourth spot. Though he
Is 550 yards aback of the pace
setter Gary Beban, he trails
Craig Winslow, who is holding
onto second, by only 26 yards.
As a team, Stanford is doing
very poorly. In the standings

Stanford is last with a con
ference record of 0-2. In offense
Stanford ranks a poor third be
hind UCLA and USC with an
average of 288 yards per game,
divided into 162 on the ground
and 126 through the air. In pass
ing the Indians are sixth and
only show a completion percent
age of .401. Stanford is also tied
for the most passes intercepted
by the opponents.
The defensive stats look even
worse. Stanford is next to last
in total offence surrendering in
average of 303 yards per game.
Strange as it may seem the
passing defense ranks better
than the rushing. The Cards
place sixth in rushing defense,
but fifth in passing defense.
By looking at some individual
stats, Stanford's weaknesses on
offense show up. Gene Washing
ton completed only 35 per cent

of his passes and averages only
3.4 yards per carry. John Root
though is having a good year
with a 4.6 average in 81 carries.
