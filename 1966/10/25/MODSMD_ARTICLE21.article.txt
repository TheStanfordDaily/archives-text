# Letters To The Editor
## Reaction Heightens: Fraternities, Women, Harris 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
I wish to congratulate the
Beta Chi's for having the wis
dom and integrity to abolish the
rush system in their house. I
have advocated such a move for
something like ten years, and I
am naturally gratified to see at
least one house try it.
I am not gratified, however,
to read the reactions of the other
fraternity men The Daily polled.
One lamented that Beta Chi was
no longer a "real" fraternity.
What reality has it given up?
Not fraternity, not brotherhood,
not small group living, but only
the custom of "dinging" other
Stanford students they don't
want to live with. If those other
students had the right to "ding"
fraternity men, then perhaps the
system would have some justifi
cation. But the system seems
to lose its point for most fra
ternity men as soon as the ele
ment of special privilege is re
moved. I hope that other houses
this year will honor the Beta
Chi's for their experiment and
follow their moral example.

I think that the movement
for off-campus living is a con
spiracy among the off-campus
men to gain equality with the
women. It is obvious that most
of these men cannot take care
of themselves. Instead, they re
ly on their eating clubs, linen
services ,and girl friends in or
der to stay alive and clean. Now
they are supporting off-campus
housing to prove that women
can't take care of themselves
either.
The men, however, will fail
in their plot, because the women
in Hoskins House and Escondido
Village have already shown
willingness and ability to learn
how to maintain an apartment
and cook well-balanced meals.
Women of the University,
unite! If you want to move off
campus, don't ask for equality

with the men; ask for a chance
to prove your superiority.

In response to Miss Aram's
letter, here are a few of my rea
sons why women (at least jun
iors and seniors) should be al
lowed to live off campus. There
is no denying that the univer
sity dorm system is not an eco
nomical way to live. Saving $100
per quarter is significant to
many women. The dorm denies
a woman the freedom to choose
the system of regulations un
der which she lives. While many
women find value and benefit
in the dorm system, others find
only its nuisance value. People
vary greately in their needs and
maturity, and for many junior
and senior women these regula
tions are unquestionably un
necessary.
The dorm also denies a wom
an a chance to develop responsi
bility. While social regulations
claim to be developing a wom
an's responsibility, they are ac
tually sheltering her from one
vital area which will be im
portant to her for the rest of
her life, i.e. maintaining a house
hold. The University affirms
that "education" means more
than textbooks and classes;
apartment living can be a vital
and enlightening part of a
woman's education.
I will not deny that dorm life
can be exciting. I loved it—for a
year or two. But the Administra
tion ought to realize that peo
ple are different, and one type
of living cannot begin to satisfy
all types of women. If Stanford
persists in keeping all women
on campus, then it should feel
some moral obligation to pro
vide them with some variety in
living accommodations. My sug
gestions would be to construct
high-rise apartments perma
nently open to undergraduate
women, and to provide women
with dorms in which they do
not have to pay board. A cam

pus of just "Florence Moores"
is certainly a bleak thought.

Editor, The Daily:
While I am in accord with
the apparent majority in this
latest campus controversy and I
recognize the immaturity of the
students who assaulted and
shaved Mr. Harris, I cannot
even begin to deceive myself
into believing that these few
students are representative of
all other fraternity men at Stan
ford.
Granted, the perpetrators of
this act may have been twenty
men of the same fraternity, but
please do not delude yourself
into believing that all other
members of Stanford fraterni
ties would have done as these
twenty men did; many, prob
ably most, members feel just
as anyone else on campus does
concerning the action of these
twenty men. However, do not
err in believing that, while
many of us are very upset to

see all of this occur, we are not
going to apologize for the actions
of men most of us don't even
know. It is inconceivable to me
why I should apologize, or any
other fraternity member should
apologize, as so many people
want us to do, or why we should
be made accountable for the ac
tions of a small group of men.
Apparently it is necessary to
inform you that in many, many
cases the only similarity be
tween fraternities at Stanford
is selective rush. Beyond this
each fraternity is different from
the others in both the type of
men it pledges and its concept
of a fraternity. In other words,
we art not all like certain of the
Delts and Phi Delts. For this
reason it is perfectly illogical to
ask us to apologize for those
who are completely different, in
both beliefs and concept of fra
ternity. JOHN F. MUNGER

Editor, The Daily:
What can a man say to ex
press the shame and outrage
that courses through him upon
learning that student body
President David Harris was
last night set upon by "twenty
masked students" who report
edly "taped his legs," "sat on
his arms," and proceeded to
shave his head? What words
should a man choose to express
his righteous wrath without
sounding hysterical?
At the very least, 1 hope that
we of the Stanford community
can count on the appropriate
student and University authori
ties to conduct a thorough in

vestigation of (he incident and
bring the persons involved to
justice.
More important, perhaps some
of us will begin to confront our
responsibility as educators for
the conditions at Stanford
which, if they do not always
give outright encouragement to
varieties of juvenile delin
quency, at least do nothing to
support a young person's intel
lectual and moral development.
I refer specifically to the lack
of candor on moral issues, to
the insidious nature of the fra
ternity system as it presently
exists on the campus, and to
our general failure to overcome
our fear and distrust of one an
other long enough to communi
cate as human beings, rather
than as "faculty," "staff," and
"student"—to name just a few
of the problems which we seem
unable to face honestly.
I would be willing to wager—
despite The Daily's report that
one Delt said, "He (Harris) j
made us feel sorry we did it"— I
that not one of the persons in- !
volved is sorry. And this is
what troubles me most. Some
how the University lias failed
these individuals. The difference
between an educated man and
those persons who considered it
their right, perhaps even their
duty, to humiliate David Har
ris is, I hope, obvious. Yet it is i
exactly this difference which
those who attacked David have
failed to grasp. There must be
some truth in what David has
been telling us: the process
through which students are run
here at Stanford does not trulv
educate. PETER B. DAHL

What can a man say to ex
press the shame and outrage
that courses through him upon
learning that student body
President David Harris was
last night set upon by "twenty
masked students" who report
edly "taped his legs," "sat on
his arms," and proceeded to
shave his head? What words
should a man choose to express
his righteous wrath without
sounding hysterical?
At the very least, 1 hope that
we of the Stanford community
can count on the appropriate
student and University authori
ties to conduct a thorough in

vestigation of (he incident and
bring the persons involved to
justice.
More important, perhaps some
of us will begin to confront our
responsibility as educators for
the conditions at Stanford
which, if they do not always
give outright encouragement to
varieties of juvenile delin
quency, at least do nothing to
support a young person's intel
lectual and moral development.
I refer specifically to the lack
of candor on moral issues, to
the insidious nature of the fra
ternity system as it presently
exists on the campus, and to
our general failure to overcome
our fear and distrust of one an
other long enough to communi
cate as human beings, rather
than as "faculty," "staff," and
"student"—to name just a few
of the problems which we seem
unable to face honestly.
I would be willing to wager—
despite The Daily's report that
one Delt said, "He (Harris) j
made us feel sorry we did it"— I
that not one of the persons in- !
volved is sorry. And this is
what troubles me most. Some
how the University lias failed
these individuals. The difference
between an educated man and
those persons who considered it
their right, perhaps even their
duty, to humiliate David Har
ris is, I hope, obvious. Yet it is i
exactly this difference which
those who attacked David have
failed to grasp. There must be
some truth in what David has
been telling us: the process
through which students are run
here at Stanford does not trulv
educate. PETER B. DAHL
Editor, The Daily:
I wish to congratulate the
Beta Chi's for having the wis
dom and integrity to abolish the
rush system in their house. I
have advocated such a move for
something like ten years, and I
am naturally gratified to see at
least one house try it.
I am not gratified, however,
to read the reactions of the other
fraternity men The Daily polled.
One lamented that Beta Chi was
no longer a "real" fraternity.
What reality has it given up?
Not fraternity, not brotherhood,
not small group living, but only
the custom of "dinging" other
Stanford students they don't
want to live with. If those other
students had the right to "ding"
fraternity men, then perhaps the
system would have some justifi
cation. But the system seems
to lose its point for most fra
ternity men as soon as the ele
ment of special privilege is re
moved. I hope that other houses
this year will honor the Beta
Chi's for their experiment and
follow their moral example.

In response to Miss Aram's
letter, here are a few of my rea
sons why women (at least jun
iors and seniors) should be al
lowed to live off campus. There
is no denying that the univer
sity dorm system is not an eco
nomical way to live. Saving $100
per quarter is significant to
many women. The dorm denies
a woman the freedom to choose
the system of regulations un
der which she lives. While many
women find value and benefit
in the dorm system, others find
only its nuisance value. People
vary greately in their needs and
maturity, and for many junior
and senior women these regula
tions are unquestionably un
necessary.
The dorm also denies a wom
an a chance to develop responsi
bility. While social regulations
claim to be developing a wom
an's responsibility, they are ac
tually sheltering her from one
vital area which will be im
portant to her for the rest of
her life, i.e. maintaining a house
hold. The University affirms
that "education" means more
than textbooks and classes;
apartment living can be a vital
and enlightening part of a
woman's education.
I will not deny that dorm life
can be exciting. I loved it—for a
year or two. But the Administra
tion ought to realize that peo
ple are different, and one type
of living cannot begin to satisfy
all types of women. If Stanford

What can a man say to ex
press the shame and outrage
that courses through him upon
learning that student body
President David Harris was
last night set upon by "twenty
masked students" who report
edly "taped his legs," "sat on
his arms," and proceeded to
shave his head? What words
should a man choose to express
his righteous wrath without
sounding hysterical?
At the very least, 1 hope that
we of the Stanford community
can count on the appropriate
student and University authori
ties to conduct a thorough in

vestigation of (he incident and
bring the persons involved to
justice.
More important, perhaps some
of us will begin to confront our
responsibility as educators for
the conditions at Stanford
which, if they do not always
give outright encouragement to
varieties of juvenile delin
quency, at least do nothing to
support a young person's intel
lectual and moral development.
I refer specifically to the lack
of candor on moral issues, to
the insidious nature of the fra
ternity system as it presently
exists on the campus, and to
our general failure to overcome
our fear and distrust of one an
other long enough to communi
cate as human beings, rather
than as "faculty," "staff," and
"student"—to name just a few
of the problems which we seem
unable to face honestly.
I would be willing to wager—
despite The Daily's report that
one Delt said, "He (Harris) j
made us feel sorry we did it"— I
that not one of the persons in- !
volved is sorry. And this is
what troubles me most. Some
how the University lias failed
these individuals. The difference
between an educated man and
those persons who considered it
their right, perhaps even their
duty, to humiliate David Har
ris is, I hope, obvious. Yet it is i
exactly this difference which
those who attacked David have
failed to grasp. There must be
some truth in what David has

Not fraternity, not brotherhood,
not small group living, but only
the custom of "dinging" other
Stanford students they don't
want to live with. If those other

In response to Miss Aram's
letter, here are a few of my rea
sons why women (at least jun
iors and seniors) should be al
lowed to live off campus. There
is no denying that the univer
sity dorm system is not an eco
nomical way to live. Saving $100
per quarter is significant to
many women. The dorm denies
a woman the freedom to choose
the system of regulations un
der which she lives. While many
women find value and benefit
in the dorm system, others find
only its nuisance value. People
vary greately in their needs and
maturity, and for many junior
and senior women these regula
tions are unquestionably un
necessary.
The dorm also denies a wom
an a chance to develop responsi
bility. While social regulations
claim to be developing a wom
an's responsibility, they are ac
tually sheltering her from one
vital area which will be im
portant to her for the rest of
her life, i.e. maintaining a house
hold. The University affirms
that "education" means more
than textbooks and classes;
apartment living can be a vital
and enlightening part of a
woman's education.
I will not deny that dorm life
can be exciting. I loved it—for a
year or two. But the Administra
tion ought to realize that peo
ple are different, and one type
of living cannot begin to satisfy
all types of women. If Stanford
persists in keeping all women
on campus, then it should feel
some moral obligation to pro
vide them with some variety in
living accommodations. My sug
gestions would be to construct
high-rise apartments perma
nently open to undergraduate
women, and to provide women
with dorms in which they do
not have to pay board. A cam

pus of just "Florence Moores"

What can a man say to ex
press the shame and outrage
that courses through him upon
learning that student body
President David Harris was
last night set upon by "twenty
masked students" who report
edly "taped his legs," "sat on
his arms," and proceeded to
shave his head? What words
should a man choose to express
his righteous wrath without
sounding hysterical?
At the very least, 1 hope that
we of the Stanford community
can count on the appropriate
student and University authori
ties to conduct a thorough in

vestigation of (he incident and
bring the persons involved to
justice.
More important, perhaps some
of us will begin to confront our
responsibility as educators for
the conditions at Stanford
which, if they do not always
give outright encouragement to
varieties of juvenile delin
quency, at least do nothing to
support a young person's intel
lectual and moral development.
I refer specifically to the lack
of candor on moral issues, to
the insidious nature of the fra
ternity system as it presently
exists on the campus, and to
our general failure to overcome
our fear and distrust of one an
other long enough to communi
cate as human beings, rather
than as "faculty," "staff," and
"student"—to name just a few
of the problems which we seem
unable to face honestly.
I would be willing to wager—
despite The Daily's report that
one Delt said, "He (Harris) j
made us feel sorry we did it"— I
that not one of the persons in- !
volved is sorry. And this is
what troubles me most. Some
how the University lias failed
these individuals. The difference
between an educated man and
those persons who considered it
their right, perhaps even their
duty, to humiliate David Har
ris is, I hope, obvious. Yet it is i
exactly this difference which
those who attacked David have
failed to grasp. There must be
some truth in what David has

I wish to congratulate the
Beta Chi's for having the wis
dom and integrity to abolish the
rush system in their house. I
have advocated such a move for
something like ten years, and I
am naturally gratified to see at
least one house try it.
I am not gratified, however,
to read the reactions of the other
fraternity men The Daily polled.
One lamented that Beta Chi was
no longer a "real" fraternity.
What reality has it given up?
Not fraternity, not brotherhood,
not small group living, but only
the custom of "dinging" other
Stanford students they don't
want to live with. If those other
students had the right to "ding"
fraternity men, then perhaps the
system would have some justifi
cation. But the system seems
to lose its point for most fra
ternity men as soon as the ele
ment of special privilege is re
moved. I hope that other houses
this year will honor the Beta
Chi's for their experiment and
follow their moral example.

educate. PETER B. DAHL
Editor, The Daily:
I wish to congratulate the
Beta Chi's for having the wis
dom and integrity to abolish the
rush system in their house. I
have advocated such a move for
something like ten years, and I
am naturally gratified to see at
least one house try it.
I am not gratified, however,
to read the reactions of the other
fraternity men The Daily polled.
One lamented that Beta Chi was
no longer a "real" fraternity.
What reality has it given up?
Not fraternity, not brotherhood,
not small group living, but only
the custom of "dinging" other
Stanford students they don't
want to live with. If those other
students had the right to "ding"
fraternity men, then perhaps the
system would have some justifi
cation. But the system seems
to lose its point for most fra
ternity men as soon as the ele
ment of special privilege is re
moved. I hope that other houses
this year will honor the Beta
Chi's for their experiment and
follow their moral example.

• Male Plot
Editor, The Daily:
I think that the movement
for off-campus living is a con
spiracy among the off-campus
men to gain equality with the
women. It is obvious that most
of these men cannot take care
of themselves. Instead, they re
ly on their eating clubs, linen
services ,and girl friends in or
der to stay alive and clean. Now
they are supporting off-campus
housing to prove that women
can't take care of themselves
either.
The men, however, will fail
in their plot, because the women
in Hoskins House and Escondido
Village have already shown
willingness and ability to learn
how to maintain an apartment
and cook well-balanced meals.
Women of the University,
unite! If you want to move off
campus, don't ask for equality

with the men; ask for a chance
to prove your superiority.

• Economics
Editor, The Daily:
In response to Miss Aram's
letter, here are a few of my rea
sons why women (at least jun
iors and seniors) should be al
lowed to live off campus. There
is no denying that the univer
sity dorm system is not an eco
nomical way to live. Saving $100
per quarter is significant to
many women. The dorm denies
a woman the freedom to choose
the system of regulations un
der which she lives. While many
women find value and benefit
in the dorm system, others find
only its nuisance value. People
vary greately in their needs and
maturity, and for many junior
and senior women these regula
tions are unquestionably un
necessary.
The dorm also denies a wom
an a chance to develop responsi
bility. While social regulations
claim to be developing a wom
an's responsibility, they are ac
tually sheltering her from one
vital area which will be im
portant to her for the rest of
her life, i.e. maintaining a house
hold. The University affirms
that "education" means more
than textbooks and classes;
apartment living can be a vital
and enlightening part of a
woman's education.
I will not deny that dorm life
can be exciting. I loved it—for a
year or two. But the Administra
tion ought to realize that peo
ple are different, and one type
of living cannot begin to satisfy
all types of women. If Stanford
persists in keeping all women
on campus, then it should feel
some moral obligation to pro
vide them with some variety in
living accommodations. My sug
gestions would be to construct
high-rise apartments perma
nently open to undergraduate
women, and to provide women
with dorms in which they do
not have to pay board. A cam

pus of just "Florence Moores"
is certainly a bleak thought.

• Abase
Editor, The Daily:
I, as well as others with whom
I have spoken, am becoming a
little more than tired of the
abuse being hurled at the Delts.
Articles recently appearing in
The Daily have condemned them
for a crime rapidly approach
ing the seriousness of murder.
It is sad to find so many people
at Stanford so engulfed in seri
ous intellectual and educational
pursuits that they have forgot
ten how to laugh at an incident
as minor as this one. The pro
portions to which this incident
has been blown up are ridicu
lous.
I can only hope that Stanford
alumni get wind of the incident;
maybe then Stanford will regain
the alumni support and prestige
that Harris and his extreme left
ist sentiments did so much to
lose. TONY JOSEPH
• Generalizations
Editor, The Daily:
While I am in accord with
the apparent majority in this
latest campus controversy and I
recognize the immaturity of the
students who assaulted and
shaved Mr. Harris, I cannot
even begin to deceive myself
into believing that these few
students are representative of
all other fraternity men at Stan
ford.
Granted, the perpetrators of
this act may have been twenty
men of the same fraternity, but
please do not delude yourself
into believing that all other
members of Stanford fraterni
ties would have done as these
twenty men did; many, prob
ably most, members feel just
as anyone else on campus does
concerning the action of these
twenty men. However, do not
err in believing that, while
many of us are very upset to

see all of this occur, we are not
going to apologize for the actions
of men most of us don't even
know. It is inconceivable to me
why I should apologize, or any
other fraternity member should
apologize, as so many people
want us to do, or why we should
be made accountable for the ac
tions of a small group of men.
Apparently it is necessary to
inform you that in many, many
cases the only similarity be
tween fraternities at Stanford
is selective rush. Beyond this
each fraternity is different from
the others in both the type of
men it pledges and its concept
of a fraternity. In other words,
we art not all like certain of the
Delts and Phi Delts. For this
reason it is perfectly illogical to
ask us to apologize for those
who are completely different, in
both beliefs and concept of fra
ternity. JOHN F. MUNGER
• Education
Editor, The Daily:
What can a man say to ex
press the shame and outrage
that courses through him upon
learning that student body
President David Harris was
last night set upon by "twenty
masked students" who report
edly "taped his legs," "sat on
his arms," and proceeded to
shave his head? What words
should a man choose to express
his righteous wrath without
sounding hysterical?
At the very least, 1 hope that
we of the Stanford community
can count on the appropriate
student and University authori
ties to conduct a thorough in

vestigation of (he incident and
bring the persons involved to
justice.
More important, perhaps some
of us will begin to confront our
responsibility as educators for
the conditions at Stanford
which, if they do not always
give outright encouragement to
varieties of juvenile delin
quency, at least do nothing to
support a young person's intel
lectual and moral development.
I refer specifically to the lack
of candor on moral issues, to
the insidious nature of the fra
ternity system as it presently
exists on the campus, and to
our general failure to overcome
our fear and distrust of one an
other long enough to communi
cate as human beings, rather
than as "faculty," "staff," and
"student"—to name just a few
of the problems which we seem
unable to face honestly.
I would be willing to wager—
despite The Daily's report that
one Delt said, "He (Harris) j
made us feel sorry we did it"— I
that not one of the persons in- !
volved is sorry. And this is
what troubles me most. Some
how the University lias failed
these individuals. The difference
between an educated man and
those persons who considered it
their right, perhaps even their
duty, to humiliate David Har
ris is, I hope, obvious. Yet it is i
exactly this difference which
those who attacked David have
failed to grasp. There must be
some truth in what David has
been telling us: the process
through which students are run
here at Stanford does not trulv
educate. PETER B. DAHL
