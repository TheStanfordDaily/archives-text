## In Defense Of Non-Selectivity 
### Pell Fender 
It seems a shame that the re
cent move by Beta Chi Fra
ternity has been so blatantly mis
construed both on and oil the
campus as it has.
Save for The Daily and the
San Francisco Chronicle, public
ity about the move has centered
around the improbable assump
tion that Beta Chi is about to
admit a platoon of female into
heretofore all-male living quar
ters.
Not only have the Palo Alto
Times and the Redwood City
Tribune run libelous columns re
ferring to "co-eds" as "broth
ers," but the news has reached
as far as the Chicago News, with
implications that Beta Chi will
offer a Sunday evening brothel
series.
National First
Beta Chi has performed what
is probably a national first: it
has opened up its membership to
all members of the Stanford
community who wish to partici
pate in its programs, including
meals, speakers, and social en
gagements. Membership will be
determined solely by the individ
ual's willingness to join and
his ability to pay accruing dues.
Actual living arrangements
will be managed according to the
physcia) number of spaces avail
able; males will, at a specified
time, draw for these spaces. As
soon as university regulations
permit (should they so permit)
females, also, will be invited to
live in. Nonetheless, Beta Chi
does not see this as operative in
the immediate future.
Draw System
'I\vo alternate mechanisms for
i\ non-selective membership sys
tem were proposed last spring.
The first was analogous to the
female draw system operative
at Stanford Two draws were to
have taken place to determine I
house membership, the first dur
in. r if first week of Spring
Quartei, and the second mi<i way i
through the same quarter. A ,
person was to have been able
to draw twice, if he so desired. !
Any member of the community. I

however, could, upon payment
of dues, become an "associate
member," one who could eat at
the house and join social activi
ties. This plan was abandoned
in preference for the one de
scribed above mainly because of
the fact that no other fraternity
is yet on this system, thereby
nullifying its practicality.
Beta Chi is now in a crucial
position. Because of radical
change and an unrealistic in
terpretation by most news me
dia, alumni support will no
doubt fall off considerably. The
university has forced all fra
ternities into new housing, and
Beta Chi will probably have to
make the move within the next
seven years. Simultaneously, im
mediate financing needs must
be met.
Freer Society
There is no question but that
Beta Chi has made a significant
move, both locally and national-

ly, towards a freer society. The
intention of the membership is
that communication between un
dergraduates, graduates, and
faculty be improved and facili
tated by a locus at which this
interaction may take place on
campus. It is also hoped that
Beta Chi will play a part in
continuing education beyond the
Quad.
Instead of misunderstanding
and misinterpretation, Beta Chi
now needs community support.
Faculty should offer to teach
classes there or at least deter
mine possibilities for improving
their contact with students. Sim
ilarly, it is hoped the adminis- I
t ration will make an effort to
use the house as a means to
hear and express views on the
purpose of their University. Fin
ally, the students themselves
will benefit from what Beta Chi
could be. Its future is tentative;
the community may decide its
fate.

ilarly, it is hoped the adminis- I
t ration will make an effort to
use the house as a means to
hear and express views on the
purpose of their University. Fin
ally, the students themselves
will benefit from what Beta Chi
could be. Its future is tentative;
the community may decide its
fate.
It seems a shame that the re
cent move by Beta Chi Fra
ternity has been so blatantly mis
construed both on and oil the
campus as it has.
Save for The Daily and the
San Francisco Chronicle, public
ity about the move has centered
around the improbable assump
tion that Beta Chi is about to
admit a platoon of female into
heretofore all-male living quar
ters.
Not only have the Palo Alto
Times and the Redwood City
Tribune run libelous columns re
ferring to "co-eds" as "broth
ers," but the news has reached
as far as the Chicago News, with
implications that Beta Chi will
offer a Sunday evening brothel
series.
National First
Beta Chi has performed what
is probably a national first: it
has opened up its membership to
all members of the Stanford
community who wish to partici
pate in its programs, including
meals, speakers, and social en
gagements. Membership will be
determined solely by the individ
ual's willingness to join and
his ability to pay accruing dues.
Actual living arrangements
will be managed according to the
physcia) number of spaces avail
able; males will, at a specified
time, draw for these spaces. As
soon as university regulations
permit (should they so permit)
females, also, will be invited to
live in. Nonetheless, Beta Chi
does not see this as operative in
the immediate future.
Draw System
'I\vo alternate mechanisms for
i\ non-selective membership sys
tem were proposed last spring.
The first was analogous to the
female draw system operative
at Stanford Two draws were to
have taken place to determine I
house membership, the first dur
in. r if first week of Spring
Quartei, and the second mi<i way i
through the same quarter. A ,
person was to have been able
to draw twice, if he so desired. !
Any member of the community. I

however, could, upon payment
of dues, become an "associate
member," one who could eat at
the house and join social activi
ties. This plan was abandoned
in preference for the one de
scribed above mainly because of
the fact that no other fraternity
is yet on this system, thereby
nullifying its practicality.
Beta Chi is now in a crucial
position. Because of radical
change and an unrealistic in
terpretation by most news me
dia, alumni support will no
doubt fall off considerably. The
university has forced all fra
ternities into new housing, and
Beta Chi will probably have to
make the move within the next
seven years. Simultaneously, im
mediate financing needs must
be met.
Freer Society
There is no question but that
Beta Chi has made a significant
move, both locally and national-

ly, towards a freer society. The
intention of the membership is
that communication between un
dergraduates, graduates, and
faculty be improved and facili
tated by a locus at which this
interaction may take place on
campus. It is also hoped that
Beta Chi will play a part in
continuing education beyond the
Quad.
Instead of misunderstanding
and misinterpretation, Beta Chi
now needs community support.
Faculty should offer to teach
classes there or at least deter
mine possibilities for improving
their contact with students. Sim
ilarly, it is hoped the adminis- I
t ration will make an effort to
