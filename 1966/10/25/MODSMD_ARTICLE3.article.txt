# Stanford Students Expressing Concern Through Peace Corps
## 
### GAIL ANDERSON 
"The Pcace Corps is more than an
outlet for altruism. It is an opportun
ity for personal development, a chal
lenge for personal growth that is not
normally found in our society."
Peace Corps recruiters Chuck But
ler and Steve Carter, both Stanford
graduates, emphasized this personal
aspect of their work in speaking to
Stanford students yesterday. The re
sponse, in Butler's words, was "amaz
ing."
"We had over 100 requests for in
formation and applications from sen
iors alone in one day," commented
Butler, head of campus recruiting
for the Peace Corps. "Last year our
total for the week, from all classes,
was only 140. Stanford was the num
ber one university in percentage of
students in the Peace Corps until last
year, when it dropped to number four.
If this response continues, it may well
be number one again this year."
Shows Commitment
Butler pointed out that 380 Stan
ford students have either completed
two years in the Peace Corps or are
presently overseas. "Dean Smith said
something about altruism possibly be
ing dead, but this response really
shows a commitment by students to
the task of doing something about the
world's problems."
He emphasized that if students ap
ply for the Peace Corps this week
they will find out by Christmas wheth
er they have been accepted. "The ap
plication does not obligate a person,"
he added. Once accepted, the person
may decide whether to go into the
program. "Because of this, it's really
foolish for a senior not to apply."
Steve Carter, Stanford '64 and a
member of the Peace Corps recruit
ing team based in San Francisco, em
phasized the unique opportunity which
the Peace Corps offers to learn "not
only about a foreign culture but about
yourself."
"Usually the community is not at
first very receptive to you," he noted.
"The biggest challenge to the volun
teer is establishing himself in a cul
ture with people who have had essen
tially no contact with foreigners. You
have to develop a strength of per
sonality."
Many college students, used to the

"pampered atmosphere" of the cam
pus, he said, are never really chal
lenged by anything that can "draw
the best out of them." "The vounteer
gains self-confidence from his experi
ence, whether it is frustrating or re
warding."
Carter spoke of the job possibilities
for a returning volunteer. "Many are
working with international develop
ment in various U.S. government
agencies," he noted. Those with an in
terest in business, he added, have
ideal experience for working with in
ternational business and economics.
A Working Knowledge
"Not only have they learned the lan
guage," he said, "but they also have
a working knowledge of the culture,
including how business procedures are
carried on."
Those who plan to teach, he said,
find that their experience with a for
eign language and culture gives them
a broaded base for their teaching. He
noted that the California state school
system will give teaching credentials
for having taught overseas in the
Peace Corps with only 9 units of grad
uate work.
"Most of those who volunteer for
the Peace Corps are already interested
in social development. Their experi
ence heightens their interest, so they
go into fields such as these where they
feel they can be effective." He added
that many former volunteers remain
to work in the countries in which
they have served.
Internationally Oriented
"To live two years working on a
daily basis with the ordinary people of
another culture makes you interna
tionally oriented," Carter commented.
To those who prefer programs such
as VISTA on the theory that Ameri
can problems come first, he offers the
proposition that the Peace Corps is
more valuable "simply because it of
fers a unique cultural experience for
two years."
"You can't forget world problems,"
he said. "We see poverty here in
America, but it's different. When you
see it in an underdeveloped country,
it really hits you in the face."
Asked about students applying to
the program to avoid the draft, he
offered the opinion that "Stanford
students aren't doing that. If anyone

did, we would discourage him; that
kind of person would really be un
happy overseas. In fact, he'd be better
off in the military."
The Activist Types
"The kind of students we want are
those who are dissatisfied with condi
tions and are doing something about
it—the activist types.
"We'd like to talk to every Stan
ford senior this week, and to anyone
else who's interested," Carter com
mented. "We think there is something
in the Peace Corps for just about any
one, in any major, at Stanford. We'd
like to see this the best year at Stan
ford for recruiting."
"Students shouldn't view the Peace
Corps as another arm of the govern
ment, but as a chance to express them
selves as individuals and to contribute
to the international scene."
He concluded, "We'd like to have
200 applicants from the senior class
at Stanford this week, and judging
by today's response it seems possi
ble that we will surpass this."

total for the week, from all classes,
was only 140. Stanford was the num
ber one university in percentage of
students in the Peace Corps until last
year, when it dropped to number four.
If this response continues, it may well
be number one again this year."
Shows Commitment
Butler pointed out that 380 Stan
ford students have either completed
two years in the Peace Corps or are
presently overseas. "Dean Smith said
something about altruism possibly be
ing dead, but this response really
shows a commitment by students to
the task of doing something about the
world's problems."
He emphasized that if students ap
ply for the Peace Corps this week
they will find out by Christmas wheth
er they have been accepted. "The ap
plication does not obligate a person,"
he added. Once accepted, the person
may decide whether to go into the
program. "Because of this, it's really
foolish for a senior not to apply."
Steve Carter, Stanford '64 and a
member of the Peace Corps recruit
ing team based in San Francisco, em
phasized the unique opportunity which
the Peace Corps offers to learn "not
only about a foreign culture but about
yourself."
"Usually the community is not at
first very receptive to you," he noted.
"The biggest challenge to the volun
teer is establishing himself in a cul
ture with people who have had essen
tially no contact with foreigners. You
have to develop a strength of per
sonality."
Many college students, used to the

"pampered atmosphere" of the cam
pus, he said, are never really chal
lenged by anything that can "draw
the best out of them." "The vounteer
gains self-confidence from his experi
ence, whether it is frustrating or re
warding."
Carter spoke of the job possibilities
for a returning volunteer. "Many are
working with international develop
ment in various U.S. government
agencies," he noted. Those with an in
terest in business, he added, have
ideal experience for working with in
ternational business and economics.
A Working Knowledge
"Not only have they learned the lan
guage," he said, "but they also have
a working knowledge of the culture,
including how business procedures are
carried on."
Those who plan to teach, he said,
find that their experience with a for
eign language and culture gives them
a broaded base for their teaching. He
noted that the California state school
system will give teaching credentials
for having taught overseas in the
Peace Corps with only 9 units of grad
uate work.
"Most of those who volunteer for
the Peace Corps are already interested
in social development. Their experi
ence heightens their interest, so they
go into fields such as these where they
feel they can be effective." He added
that many former volunteers remain
to work in the countries in which
they have served.
Internationally Oriented
"To live two years working on a
daily basis with the ordinary people of
another culture makes you interna
tionally oriented," Carter commented.
To those who prefer programs such
as VISTA on the theory that Ameri
can problems come first, he offers the
proposition that the Peace Corps is
more valuable "simply because it of
fers a unique cultural experience for
two years."
"You can't forget world problems,"
he said. "We see poverty here in
America, but it's different. When you
see it in an underdeveloped country,
it really hits you in the face."
Asked about students applying to
the program to avoid the draft, he
offered the opinion that "Stanford
students aren't doing that. If anyone

did, we would discourage him; that
kind of person would really be un
happy overseas. In fact, he'd be better
off in the military."
The Activist Types
"The kind of students we want are
those who are dissatisfied with condi
tions and are doing something about
it—the activist types.
"We'd like to talk to every Stan
ford senior this week, and to anyone
else who's interested," Carter com
mented. "We think there is something
in the Peace Corps for just about any
one, in any major, at Stanford. We'd
like to see this the best year at Stan
ford for recruiting."
"Students shouldn't view the Peace
Corps as another arm of the govern
ment, but as a chance to express them
selves as individuals and to contribute
to the international scene."
He concluded, "We'd like to have
200 applicants from the senior class
at Stanford this week, and judging
by today's response it seems possi
ble that we will surpass this."
"The Pcace Corps is more than an
outlet for altruism. It is an opportun
ity for personal development, a chal
lenge for personal growth that is not
normally found in our society."
Peace Corps recruiters Chuck But
ler and Steve Carter, both Stanford
graduates, emphasized this personal
aspect of their work in speaking to
Stanford students yesterday. The re
sponse, in Butler's words, was "amaz
ing."
"We had over 100 requests for in
formation and applications from sen
iors alone in one day," commented
Butler, head of campus recruiting
for the Peace Corps. "Last year our
total for the week, from all classes,

ply for the Peace Corps this week
they will find out by Christmas wheth
er they have been accepted. "The ap
plication does not obligate a person,"
he added. Once accepted, the person
may decide whether to go into the
program. "Because of this, it's really
foolish for a senior not to apply."
Steve Carter, Stanford '64 and a
member of the Peace Corps recruit
ing team based in San Francisco, em
phasized the unique opportunity which
the Peace Corps offers to learn "not
only about a foreign culture but about
yourself."
"Usually the community is not at
first very receptive to you," he noted.
"The biggest challenge to the volun
teer is establishing himself in a cul
ture with people who have had essen
tially no contact with foreigners. You
have to develop a strength of per
sonality."
Many college students, used to the

"pampered atmosphere" of the cam
pus, he said, are never really chal
lenged by anything that can "draw
the best out of them." "The vounteer
gains self-confidence from his experi
ence, whether it is frustrating or re
warding."
Carter spoke of the job possibilities
for a returning volunteer. "Many are
working with international develop
ment in various U.S. government
agencies," he noted. Those with an in
terest in business, he added, have
ideal experience for working with in
ternational business and economics.
A Working Knowledge
"Not only have they learned the lan
guage," he said, "but they also have
a working knowledge of the culture,
including how business procedures are
carried on."
Those who plan to teach, he said,
find that their experience with a for
eign language and culture gives them
a broaded base for their teaching. He
noted that the California state school
system will give teaching credentials
for having taught overseas in the
Peace Corps with only 9 units of grad
uate work.
"Most of those who volunteer for
the Peace Corps are already interested
in social development. Their experi
ence heightens their interest, so they
go into fields such as these where they
feel they can be effective." He added
that many former volunteers remain
to work in the countries in which
they have served.
Internationally Oriented
"To live two years working on a
daily basis with the ordinary people of
another culture makes you interna
tionally oriented," Carter commented.
To those who prefer programs such
as VISTA on the theory that Ameri
can problems come first, he offers the
proposition that the Peace Corps is
more valuable "simply because it of
fers a unique cultural experience for
two years."
"You can't forget world problems,"
he said. "We see poverty here in
America, but it's different. When you
see it in an underdeveloped country,
it really hits you in the face."
Asked about students applying to
the program to avoid the draft, he
offered the opinion that "Stanford
students aren't doing that. If anyone

did, we would discourage him; that
kind of person would really be un
happy overseas. In fact, he'd be better
off in the military."
The Activist Types
"The kind of students we want are
those who are dissatisfied with condi
tions and are doing something about
it—the activist types.
"We'd like to talk to every Stan
ford senior this week, and to anyone
else who's interested," Carter com
mented. "We think there is something
in the Peace Corps for just about any
one, in any major, at Stanford. We'd
like to see this the best year at Stan
ford for recruiting."
"Students shouldn't view the Peace
Corps as another arm of the govern
ment, but as a chance to express them
selves as individuals and to contribute
to the international scene."
He concluded, "We'd like to have
200 applicants from the senior class
at Stanford this week, and judging
by today's response it seems possi
ble that we will surpass this."
"The Pcace Corps is more than an
outlet for altruism. It is an opportun
ity for personal development, a chal
lenge for personal growth that is not
normally found in our society."
Peace Corps recruiters Chuck But
ler and Steve Carter, both Stanford
graduates, emphasized this personal
aspect of their work in speaking to
Stanford students yesterday. The re
sponse, in Butler's words, was "amaz
ing."
"We had over 100 requests for in
formation and applications from sen
iors alone in one day," commented
Butler, head of campus recruiting
for the Peace Corps. "Last year our
total for the week, from all classes,
was only 140. Stanford was the num
ber one university in percentage of
students in the Peace Corps until last
year, when it dropped to number four.
If this response continues, it may well
be number one again this year."
Shows Commitment
Butler pointed out that 380 Stan
ford students have either completed
two years in the Peace Corps or are
presently overseas. "Dean Smith said
something about altruism possibly be
ing dead, but this response really
shows a commitment by students to
the task of doing something about the
world's problems."
He emphasized that if students ap
