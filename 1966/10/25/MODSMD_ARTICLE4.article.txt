Stokeley Carmichael, a "Black Fair"
in White Memorial Plaza, a teach-in,
and the San Francisco Mime Troupe
will highlight "Black Power Day" at
Stanford on Friday.
The event, organized by the Stan
ford chapter of Students for a Dem
ocratic Society (SDS), is scheduled
for the day prior to a controversial
national "black power" conference at
Cal in Berkeley.
The National Chairman of SNCC,
Stokeley Carmichael, will appear here
under the sponsorship of the Political
Union and the SDS. He plans to speak
in Memorial Auditorium at 3:15 Fri
day afternoon. Carmichael is ex
pected to discuss the concept of black
power and its application to urban
areas like San Francisco.
Charles Bell of the Political Union

expressed the hope that Carmichael's
appearance will provide the oppor
tunity for a serious discussion on the
matter of black power.
Central Figure
"Carmichael is a central figure in
the civil rights debate between the
adherents of Martin Luther King's
style of civil disobedience and pro
ponents of a more aggressive pos
ture," Bell commented.
According to Keith Lowe, a co
chairman of SDS, Black Power Day
activities will last from 12 noon to
midnight. Ed Keating, editor of Ram
parts magazine will be the featured
speaker at a noon rally in White Plaza.
Dave Harris is scheduled to open
the "Black Fair" in White Plaza at 1:00
p.m. The fair will include dancing,
poetry reading, "jug bands," a flea
market, and a bake sale. Participants

will also sell watermelon. Lowe en
couraged people to wear "any kind
of costumes."
The event is to be modeled after
the "free fairs" which have been held
recently by the Artists' Liberation
Front at Hunter's Point, and the
Haight-Ashbury District in San Fran
cisco.
Teach-in
At 7:30 p.m. in Cubberley Auditor
ium the SDS will sponsor a teach-in
on "The Varieties of Black Power."
Speakers will include representatives
from black nationalist groups, Black
Muslims, Black Communists, and
Ivonhoe Donaldson, the East Coast
Director of SNCC.
"We are inviting people who are
actually involved in the black power
movement," Lowe told The Daily. "We
seek to articulate the various posi

tions which are included under the
general term 'black power.' We
port the political program of SNCC
covered by their slogan black power,
as distinguished from other positions.
Participants are expected from
Watts, Oakland, Hunter's Point, ancs
East Palo Alto.
Mime Troupe
The San Francisco Mime Troupe
will appear at 8:30 p.m. in Cubberley*
They will perform "Olive Pits" an#'
show their film "O Dem Watermeli
ons." Charge for the Mime Troupe
will be $1 for students and $1.50 for
non-students.
An international panel of students
will discuss the relevance of black
power to the underdeveloped nations.
Students from France, India, and Ni
geria plan to consider the role of
this concept in an emerging world.
Lowe expressed the hope that thÂ£
events would provide political and
financial support for SNCC. SDS rep
resentatives will organize car pools
for Saturday's conference in Berke l :
ley, where Carmichael will speak
again.
