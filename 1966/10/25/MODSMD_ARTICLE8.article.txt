# Funk: 'Students Lack Rights'
## 
### 
Speaking at the closing session of
the American College Union Confer
ence on Student Rights, Dean Robert
N. Funk of the School of Education
examined student rights: "Looking at
it from a purely legalistic basis, stu
dents have no rights, and this is on
what most academic policies are
based."
Funk told his Saturday night audi
ence that "what is just as ridiculous is
that students have in the last couple
of years begun to frame their com
plaints in legalistic terms." He added,
"A student should not have to fight
for the right to make decisions about
his life, where one will live and what
hours one will spend with members
of the opposite sex."
He went on to say that the way
things are going on both sides of the
question, it will be necessary for a
student to issue a writ of Habeas
Corpus to get a professor to improve

his lecture.
Funk stated that, "We have lost
sight of the rights of minorities. We
are browbeaten with the concept of
minorities in the university, when
what is really important is the rela
tionship between the individual and
his education."
Citing a new low in the tyranny of
the majority at Stanford, Funk de
plored the attack on Dave Harris: "It
is only a little step between what hap
pened Thursday night, and the lynch
mobs in the South. It is only a Wttle
tiny step from there to the people who
turned other people into soap in Ger
many. Ynu ask who did it; it was the
good people and their concept of ma
jority, and theirs would not stop it."
Funk concluded that "to change our
attitudes so that we may respect the
minority for what it is, higher edu
cation must address itself to the needs
and opportunities of the individual."
