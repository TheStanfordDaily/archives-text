# War Escalation Requires More Inductees
## 
### DAVID SHERIFF The Collegiate Press Service 
WASHINGTON — For many students this
will be the last term. As the war in Vietnam
broadens, and few doubt that it will, an in
creasing number of former students are going
to be toting rifles.
Already the 1-A men are in short supply.
Seventy thousand men between the ages of 26
and 34 were tapped for their physicals at the
end of September. Even if calls stay at their
present level, which is ten times the draft
rate of the winter of 1965, all those 26 to 34
found qualified will probably be inducted, ac
cording to Lt. Gen. Lewis B. Hershey, Director
of the Selective Service System.
But the pickings are slim, and Hershey ex
pects that over two-thirds of the age 26 to 34
men will not pass their physicals. The one-and
one-half million college students now deferred
constitutes the next large group of men.
Just how much stiffer is it going to get?
That all depends on how much further the war
escalates, Hershey said in a recent interview.
Predictions Optimistic
Coming into the November elections, many
of the official predictions on Vietnam are opti
mistic. During the last year, however, the

count of U.S. military personnel has increased
from 2,686,000 to 3,184,000. Defense Depart
ment officials have added that the build-up
will continue at that rate unless there is a
change in the war.
Two years ago the 1-A manpower pool was
large, calls were reduced, and the Selective
Service was looking for excuses to defer stu
dents, according to Hershey. Now local boards
are harder pressed, and they are carefully
evaluating individual performance — drafting
those who fail to make Selective Service
grades.
Part-time students are no longer deferred,
and many State Boards have been requiring
students to carry a full schedule to be de
fined as "full-time." Previously, students were
often allowed to carry three-quarters of a
normal year's load and were still considered
full-time. Now boards are asking their 2-S
registrants to complete one-fourth of a four
year program each year.
Major Not Considered
While Selective Service policy has not con
sidered a student's choice of major or field in
reviewing his deferment, Hershey indicated
that this may not always be the case.
The judgment of individuals on the local

level is often quite independent, he said, and
"if the need gets tighter . . . the public under
stands much better what you do with an engi
neer than with a liberal arts" major.
Students who have taken a year out of
school, for any reason, have had trouble
getting their deferments back since last fall,
Class rankings became available to the local
boards this summer, as did the results of the

College Qualification Test administered in the
spring.
Eighty-one per cent of the almost 800,000
registrants taking the examination at that
time made pissing scores of 70 or better. A
new series of tests has been scheduled for
November 18 and 1-9.
Draft Tests Opposed
Opposition to the draft has been exhibited in
challenges to the qualification tests. Several
schools have held referenda on whether to

permit the test to be held in their facilities.
In one of the latest votes, students and fac
ulty at the Buffalo campus of the State Uni
versity of New York swung two to one in
favor of holding the tests, stressing the con
venience of having the operation on campus.
Three midwestern universities are holding
general referenda on the Selective Service No
vember 16. Students at the University of Min
nesota, the University of Michigan and Wayne
State University will indicate both whether
they think their schools should cooperate with
the draft by releasing rankings and grades and
how they feel about conscription in general.
Refusing to cooperate with the Selective
Service, several institutions have recently an
nounced that they will discontinue the practice
of ranking students by grade, including An
tioch College, Harverford College, Wayne State
University, and the City College of New York.
Hershey Defends System
General Hershey defends the use of grades
and ranks in evaluating students for the draft.
In response to criticism that the prospect of
being drafted for low grades puts students
under undue pressure and induces them to
take easier courses Hershey replied that the
Selective Service did not invent the standards.

"The colleges are the people that . . . used
examinations and standing in class" to deter
mine how many students they would not flunk
out, Hershey said. "We just went out and
found a yardstick that was there.
"When the colleges get so they don't use
grades any more," he added, "then whatever
they're using, we'll try to use."

Wayne State University President William
ft. Keast announced last summer that the uni
versity will discontinue providing class rank
ings to local draft boards.
Keast, in a statement to the university's
board of governors, said "the determination
and publication of detailed class rankings is
educationally undersirable."
"The emphasis on grades and class standing
produced by selevtice service procedures will
surely intensify several undersirable features
of our present system of higher education,"
Keast continued.
"Competition for admission to colleges, com
petition for grade places, and competition for
employment often distorts the normal pat
terns of intellectual growth, and curbs the
impulse to experiment and explore, which
should be encouraged in college students."

A group of students appointed by N.S.A.
coordinator Gerry Massey will meet tonight in
Tresidder with Forest Bady, a member of
President Johnson's committee studying possi
ble changes in the draft laws.

Wayne State University President William
ft. Keast announced last summer that the uni
versity will discontinue providing class rank
ings to local draft boards.
Keast, in a statement to the university's
board of governors, said "the determination
and publication of detailed class rankings is
educationally undersirable."
"The emphasis on grades and class standing
produced by selevtice service procedures will
surely intensify several undersirable features
of our present system of higher education,"
Keast continued.
"Competition for admission to colleges, com
petition for grade places, and competition for
employment often distorts the normal pat
terns of intellectual growth, and curbs the
impulse to experiment and explore, which
should be encouraged in college students."

A group of students appointed by N.S.A.
coordinator Gerry Massey will meet tonight in
Tresidder with Forest Bady, a member of
President Johnson's committee studying possi
ble changes in the draft laws.
WASHINGTON — For many students this
will be the last term. As the war in Vietnam
broadens, and few doubt that it will, an in
creasing number of former students are going
to be toting rifles.
Already the 1-A men are in short supply.
Seventy thousand men between the ages of 26
and 34 were tapped for their physicals at the
end of September. Even if calls stay at their
present level, which is ten times the draft
rate of the winter of 1965, all those 26 to 34
found qualified will probably be inducted, ac
cording to Lt. Gen. Lewis B. Hershey, Director
of the Selective Service System.
But the pickings are slim, and Hershey ex
pects that over two-thirds of the age 26 to 34
men will not pass their physicals. The one-and
one-half million college students now deferred
constitutes the next large group of men.
Just how much stiffer is it going to get?
That all depends on how much further the war
escalates, Hershey said in a recent interview.
Predictions Optimistic
Coming into the November elections, many
of the official predictions on Vietnam are opti
mistic. During the last year, however, the

count of U.S. military personnel has increased
from 2,686,000 to 3,184,000. Defense Depart
ment officials have added that the build-up
will continue at that rate unless there is a
change in the war.
Two years ago the 1-A manpower pool was
large, calls were reduced, and the Selective
Service was looking for excuses to defer stu
dents, according to Hershey. Now local boards
are harder pressed, and they are carefully
evaluating individual performance — drafting
those who fail to make Selective Service
grades.
Part-time students are no longer deferred,
and many State Boards have been requiring
students to carry a full schedule to be de
fined as "full-time." Previously, students were
often allowed to carry three-quarters of a
normal year's load and were still considered
full-time. Now boards are asking their 2-S
registrants to complete one-fourth of a four
year program each year.
Major Not Considered
While Selective Service policy has not con
sidered a student's choice of major or field in
reviewing his deferment, Hershey indicated
that this may not always be the case.
The judgment of individuals on the local

level is often quite independent, he said, and
"if the need gets tighter . . . the public under
stands much better what you do with an engi
neer than with a liberal arts" major.
Students who have taken a year out of
school, for any reason, have had trouble
getting their deferments back since last fall,
Class rankings became available to the local
boards this summer, as did the results of the

College Qualification Test administered in the
spring.
Eighty-one per cent of the almost 800,000
registrants taking the examination at that
time made pissing scores of 70 or better. A
new series of tests has been scheduled for
November 18 and 1-9.
Draft Tests Opposed
Opposition to the draft has been exhibited in
challenges to the qualification tests. Several
schools have held referenda on whether to

permit the test to be held in their facilities.
In one of the latest votes, students and fac
ulty at the Buffalo campus of the State Uni
versity of New York swung two to one in
favor of holding the tests, stressing the con
venience of having the operation on campus.
Three midwestern universities are holding

Opposition to the draft has been exhibited in

permit the test to be held in their facilities.

of ranking students by grade, including An

In response to criticism that the prospect of
being drafted for low grades puts students
under undue pressure and induces them to
take easier courses Hershey replied that the
Selective Service did not invent the standards.

"The colleges are the people that . . . used
examinations and standing in class" to deter

out, Hershey said. "We just went out and
found a yardstick that was there.
"When the colleges get so they don't use
grades any more," he added, "then whatever
they're using, we'll try to use."

Wayne State University President William
ft. Keast announced last summer that the uni
versity will discontinue providing class rank
ings to local draft boards.
Keast, in a statement to the university's
board of governors, said "the determination
and publication of detailed class rankings is
educationally undersirable."
"The emphasis on grades and class standing
produced by selevtice service procedures will
surely intensify several undersirable features
of our present system of higher education,"
Keast continued.
"Competition for admission to colleges, com
petition for grade places, and competition for
employment often distorts the normal pat
terns of intellectual growth, and curbs the
impulse to experiment and explore, which
should be encouraged in college students."

A group of students appointed by N.S.A.
coordinator Gerry Massey will meet tonight in
Tresidder with Forest Bady, a member of
President Johnson's committee studying possi
ble changes in the draft laws.
WASHINGTON — For many students this
will be the last term. As the war in Vietnam
broadens, and few doubt that it will, an in
creasing number of former students are going
to be toting rifles.
Already the 1-A men are in short supply.
Seventy thousand men between the ages of 26
and 34 were tapped for their physicals at the
end of September. Even if calls stay at their
present level, which is ten times the draft
rate of the winter of 1965, all those 26 to 34
found qualified will probably be inducted, ac
cording to Lt. Gen. Lewis B. Hershey, Director
of the Selective Service System.
But the pickings are slim, and Hershey ex
pects that over two-thirds of the age 26 to 34
men will not pass their physicals. The one-and
one-half million college students now deferred
constitutes the next large group of men.
Just how much stiffer is it going to get?
That all depends on how much further the war
escalates, Hershey said in a recent interview.
Predictions Optimistic
Coming into the November elections, many
of the official predictions on Vietnam are opti
mistic. During the last year, however, the

count of U.S. military personnel has increased
from 2,686,000 to 3,184,000. Defense Depart
ment officials have added that the build-up
will continue at that rate unless there is a
change in the war.
Two years ago the 1-A manpower pool was
large, calls were reduced, and the Selective
Service was looking for excuses to defer stu
dents, according to Hershey. Now local boards
are harder pressed, and they are carefully
evaluating individual performance — drafting
those who fail to make Selective Service
grades.
