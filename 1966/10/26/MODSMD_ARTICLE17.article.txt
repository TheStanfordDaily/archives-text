# Negro Actor Expresses Views
## 
### SUE BAKER 
A fascinating string of events
has brought Paul Winfield to
Stanford, where he is now the
youngest, newest and only Ne
gro member of the Stanford
Repertory Theater.
A "product of academic thea
ter," Paul has studied in Oregon
and California, including a sum
mer at the Contemporary Thea
ter Workshop at Stanford in
1963, and — most recently — at
UCLA. He first began acting pro

fessionally in 1957 in a Pilgrim
age Play in his native Los An
geles. "I suppose I could have
skipped school after that, but
I wanted to get a firm technical
and historical background." He
finds theater history fascinat
ing, and feels that looking at
drama from an academic point
of view has given him a greater
respect and appreciation for his
craft.
Paul echoes the opinions of
his fellow actors when he says

that a repertory company is the
best kind of theater environ
ment. "The onus of competition
is taken away—here you can
learn, train, and work steadily,
and you really have a chance to
get to know your fellow actors."
Work In All Mediums
He also believes, however, that
actors have a responsibility to
themselves as artists to try
working in all mediums, includ
ing commercial theater, televi
sion and movies. Winfield had a
contact with Columbian Pictures,
and he made a movie and a
series of T.V. shows before com
ing here, but he does prefer
stage plays with extended runs
to "one-shot" movie or T.V. pro
ductions. Not only does a stage
production give an actor a
chance to evolve and improve
his characterization, but also,
having an audience makes a
tremendous difference. "There's
nothing more difficult than act
ing on a movie or T.V. set for
cold, hostile and unresponsive
technicians; the actor has no
opportunity to experiment—no
freedom."
Of course, the inevitable ques
tion was asked: "Being a Ne
gro, how has it affected your
career?" Winfield's first reac
tion was a laugh and "1 don't
know; I've never been anything
else." Seriously, he feels that
although there are drawbacks
in the number of parts available,
it also means that competition
is less —"I'm competing with six
instead of sixty for a part." Last
year Paul was acting in "The
Dutchman" by Leroy Jones, an
"angry young Negro play
wright." "Working on the play
brought out a lot of hostilities,
but they went away when the
play was over.
"I'm not an Uncle Tom and
I'm not complacent, but I don't
participate in marches and dem
onstrations only because I don't
believe in what American Ne
groes want. I'll demonstrate
when Negroes start working for
something more than middle
class values —a white-collar job
and two cars in the garage."
An American Negro Theater
Winfield looks forward to a
real American Negro Theater,
which would present not just
protest, but classical drama.
"It's not here now because the
American Negro hasn't found
himself, but I'd like to be a part
of it when it comes." This past
summer he worked with the
South Central Theater Youth
Guild in Watts, and he felt that
the students he worked with
were "interested, excited, and

talented; they had lots to say
but they weren't hostile."
Acting accomplishments to
Winfield's credit include UCLA
productions of "King Lear" and
"Kid," a soon-to-be released
movie, "Who's Minding the
Mint?", and Los Angeles pro
ductions of "In White America,"
"The Toilet" and"The Dutch
man." This last production was
directed by Burgess Meridith,
whom Paul feels has helped him
as much as anyone with his
work and career. In S.R.T.'s cur
rent production of "Anthony
and Cleopatra," Winfield plays
three important roles — the
Soothsayer, Pompeii and Thidias
—and he succeeds wonderfully
in giving each character a sep
arate and very real personality.
Winfield, who insists he is
really a shy, reticent person—
"not really articulate; I can only
show"—lives on a 160 acre ranch
Woodside with his Old English
sheepdog, Waldo, twelve
horses, four racoons and as
sorted owls and foxes. In addi
tion to raising and showing dogs,
Paul paints—he's the originator
of the life-size, Pop-Art nude
of Marilyn Monroe—reads a lot,
loves music from Vivaldi to
Dylan and has a small art col
lection—"actors tend to collect
paintings; it's permanent" —
which includes a Giacometti and
various contemporary artists.
"I'm very happy with my
career right now; I can't say
what I plan to do next until
it comes along." Paul says he's
not really superstitious, but he
thinks luck and the stars in his
Zodiac have aided his success.
I think there's one other thing
- talent.
