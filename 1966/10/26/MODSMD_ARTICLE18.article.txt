## FINE ARTS EDITOR, RISSA WHITE West Bay Opera Executes Exuberant, Colorful 'Carmen' 
### FRANCIE MARKS 
"Carmen," presented at the
Palo Alto Community Center by
the West Bay Opera, is a well
executed, exuberant, and color
ful production. Director Henry
Holt describes it as "a Spanish
story, written by a Frenchman,
performed by Americans, con
ducted by an Austrian, and
played on a Japanese piano."
The West Bay group delivers
Bizet's famous opera with
charm and vivacity. "Carmen"
will run Friday and Saturday at
8 p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m. In
formation about tickets is avail
able at 325-0225.
Two performers are cast for
each character. This reviewer

saw Vivian Weede and Thomas
Caperello in the lead parts.
They will appear again Satur
day. The show owes much of its
success to Mrs. Weede's vivaci
ous portrayal of Carmen. Bizet
created Carmen as a headstrong
coquette, and Mrs. Weede in
corporates a hustling quality
into the gypsy girl's personality.
Jose Lacks Gusto
Don Jose is played by Cape
rello as the wishy-washy moth
er's-boy type who is a nice guy,
but incapable of making deci
sions. Unfortunately, this char
acter looks too weak alongside
of his lover, the explosively en
ticing Carmen. He needs to have
bushier eyebrows, more hair on
the chest, and broader should
ers to look like a man whom a
girl as vibrant as Carmen could
love.
Don Jose grows more alive,
more real, and less like Ichabod
Crane throughout the play. By
the end of the opera Caparello
plays Don Jose with an angry
force.
Many of the secondary char
acters execute their parts su
perbly. Betsy Allen's singing
was as charming as her beauty
for the part of Michaela. Walter
Hinton, as the toreador Esca
millo was the suavest man in
the cast.
Plain Sets Help
The sets are plain but provide
a perfect backdrop for the wild
ly colorful costumes. "La Mari
quita," the choreographer and
dance soloist, was given more
publicity than she merited.
The West Bay Opera sang
Bizet's lyrics beautifully, but
the piano accompaniment tend
ed to weigh down the soaring
quality of the music. The lack of
tambourines, triangles, and
other gypsy instruments ac
companying the dancing was a
particular disappointment.
