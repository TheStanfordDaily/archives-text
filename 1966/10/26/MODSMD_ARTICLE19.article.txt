## Love, Atomic Bomb Make Master Film 
### Steve Lavine 
This week offers a fantastic
number of opportunities to the
film-goer. The I-Center film to
night it; Alain Resnais' Hiro
shima Mon Amour (1959). Res
nais asked novelist Marguerite
Duras to write a love story set
against the background of Hiro
shima that would not seem
absurd in the context of the
atomic bomb. From this story,
Resnais created one of the few
genuine masterpieces of modern
cinema.
The film opens with a long se
quence of a man and a woman
in bed talking to one another.
The woman claims that she has
seen Hiroshima, she has been
to the museum, and she knows
what happened. The man says
that she knows nothing.
As the film progresses, it be
comes clear that the woman
(played by Emmanuele Riva) is
a French actress in Hiroshima
to make a "peace film." It is the
last day of filming and tomor
row she will leave for France.
The man (Eiji Okada) is a Japa
nese architect she has just met
and been attracted to.
A Woman's Story
At the beginning, the movie
treats the two equally, but as it
advances, it becomes increasing
ly the woman's story and a story
of the relationship. She tells of
her love for a German soldier
during the war, his death. The
past blends with the present,
and her hysteria grows. She con
fuses the man with her German
lover. At last she becomes de
lirious and the man slaps her to
bring her around. Then the film
slowly unwinds until she leaves
for France.
Both people are lost against
the background of their time.
Both become tiny in comparison
with what has happened. This is
recognized in the final words of
the movie: SHE: "Hi roshima.
Hi ro shi ma. That's your name."
HE: "That's my name. Yes. Your
names is Nevers. Nevers-in-
France."
Hiroshima Mon Amour is an

immensely literary film. The
language of Marguerita Duras
is exceedingly beautiful. Indeed,
the screenplay may be read with
out having seen the movie and
still be effective (it is available
in an Evergreen Original, E
284). The film goes a long way
toward disproving Siegfreid Kra
cauer's contention that for a
film to succeed as a work of art
it must be primarily visual. Hi
roshima is almost equally de
pendent on the verbal and the
visual, and it emerges as a very
great film.
Journalist's Story
The University series film this
Thursday is Knife in the Water
(Roman Polanski, 1963). A jour
nalist and his wife are stopped
on their way to the lake for a
day of sailing by a brash uni
versity student who jumps in
front of their car, forcing them
to screech to a halt. They agree
to give the student a ride as far
as the lake. But by the time they
reach it, the journalist realizes
that the student represents a
challenge to his masculinity.
He invites the student to
spend the day sailing with them.
One senses that this is a mis
take. The journalist also seems
to sense this, but, like the tragic
hero, he relentlessly forces his
fate. What ensues is a day of
sailing in which the weaknesses
of both the student and the jour
nalist are exposed.
