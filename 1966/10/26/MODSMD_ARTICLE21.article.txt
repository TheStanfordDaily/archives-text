Preaching through folksongs,
"abbi Shlomo Carlebach will ap
pear at Cubberley Auditorium
Sunday at 8 p.m.
Rabbi Carlebach, who prefers
to be known as Shlomo, is
world-famous as a composer and
performer of Jewish Chassidic
songs.
Tickets for the concert are $2
for adults and $1 for students.
They are available at the Tresid
der Box Office and at the door.
Shlomo believes that "We're
living in the twentieth century
and rabbis, like everyone else,
have to cater for twentieth cen

tury needs and demands."
Accordingly, Shlomo left his
pulpit in a small New Jersey
town in 1959 to travel with his
song and guitar.
His songs are characterized by
mysticism and mood. His inspi
ration comes from the Torah
and from youth. Shlomo inter
prets and represents these all
over the world.
Annually he makes a tour
through Europe and Israel. He
has also performed in South
American countries and from
coast to coast in the United
States, including several Stand

ing Room Only concerts in New
York's Town Hall.
Shlomo has composed over 400
melodies. Receiving classical re
nown in his own time, his song
"Od Yeshoma" is sung at every
Jewish wedding in every coun
try. He started playing the
guitar in 1957 so that he could
accompany his singing.
He has two world-wide best
selling albums, Songs of My
Soul and Sing My Heart. The
success of the first of these, re
leased in 1959, was responsible
for his decision to become a
troubadour of Jewish spirituals.
