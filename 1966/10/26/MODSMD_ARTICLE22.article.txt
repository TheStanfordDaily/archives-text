## Coach Ralston Analyzes Victory 
### NICK SELBY 
(Note: The following' is an
Interview with Stanford football
coach John Ralston on the ques
tions arising from the Illinois
game which Stanford won 6-3.)
Q. How did Gene Washington
score Stanford's only touch
down? Was the play designed as
a pass? lias Gene set up a pass
ing threat on this type of play
earlier in the game? (See Dia
gram.)
Ralston: The play was set up
a;s a pass-run option play. Gene
was to roll out and pass to
Blunt or Conrad if they were

open. What made this play work
was the terrific block Dave
Lewis put on Illinois' defensive
end. He drove him out to the
sideline, completely out of the
play. Thus Gene was not pres
sured.
Similarly, Jack Root, the full
back, made a sound block on the
linebacker who was coming over
to back up the end. Blunt and
Conrad occupied the defensive
backs, who had to cover them or
else Gene could have thrown. A
huge hole was left and Gene
took off. He made a good run for
the score.

What was the reason for
Washington overthrowing Jack
Root on a scoring attempt ear
lier in the game?
Ralston: Gene was rushed,
and had to hurry his throw
some. Also, the wind may have
affected the pass.
Q. Are you satisfied by Wash
ington's play this season?
Ralston: Well, it's hard to
ever be completely satisfied by
anyone's play. But we are
pleased with Gene's improve
ment. He's meeting a lot of prob
lems on the field, and he's only
a sophomore. His passing com
pletion record, for example,
should improve with time.
Q. What happened on the pass
Bill Shoemaker threw to Blunt
that was intercepted?
Ralston: This was a halfback
pass-run option play. The ball
was simply up in the air too
long. Actually, Dave Lewis
should have been in to throw
on this play. He was shaken up
on the previous play, and I
guess Gene didn't realize It.
Q. Are you satisfied with the
play of Dave Lewis? Is he play
ing up to last year's potential?
Ralston: We feel that Dave is
playing very well, especially if
you consider the fact that he
was injured and that he has
switched positions. He is block
ing and kicking well.
H. How do you feel about your
team's defense play? Was It
just a case of stopping Illinois
at the right time? Were you
surprised by anything Illinois
did?
Ralston: That was mostly the
case- Illinois had impressive of
fensive statistics but we pre
vented them from scoring. When
we forced Illinois to go for the
field goal at the end of the first
half, I saw a turning point of the
game. We were not surprised
either on offence or defenseâ€”
they played strictly as we ex
pected.
As for the way Illinois gam
bled on fourth down, they took
conservative gambles and didn't
surprise us. Monty Mohrman
made a great play when he
stopped an Illinois plunge for
two feet short of the first down.
Naponic had good passing sta
tistics, but our defensive backs
played well. They stayed in back
of the receivers and made no
costly mistakes.
Q. Do you feel that you start
ed playing at the start of the
games this time? Why isn't the
offense producting jmints? You

have only a five point average
for the last three games.
Ralston: Yes, we did play
much more effectively at the
start of the game. The reason we
aren't scoring is that we don't
have a complete unit on the
field. Eight guvs do their job
well and the three others miss
assignments and ruin the play.
We know exactly why we aren't
scoring. We must start scoring
we can't rely on breaks such
as the dropped punt to beat
Washington or UCLA.
(J. What do you expect from
the University of Washington on

Saturday? Will the absence of
halfback Don Moore hurt the
Huskies? Will everyone have
recovered from the food poison
ing?
Ralston: We expect a real
battle. This team has a strong
running and passing attack.
The absence of Moore will prob
ably help the Huskies because
they will he more fired up. Ren
wick and Blunt both were pretty
sick from the food poisoning,
and most of the team was af
fected in one way or another.
But we should be recovered com
pletely by Saturday.


Here's how Washington scored. Illinois' defensive end penetrated
fast, and Lewis put a crushing block on him to drive hini out of
the play. Similarly, Root put a great block on the linebacker who
came over to back up the end. Conrad and Blunt occupied the de
fensive backs. Washington then rolled out and ran (dotted line) for
score through huge hole.
