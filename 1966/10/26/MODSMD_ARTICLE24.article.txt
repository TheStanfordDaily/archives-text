# Intramural Schedules
## 
### 
A league title is up for grabs
and two front-runners try to ex
tend winning streaks in today's
intramural football action.
El Cuadro, after holding oft
El Tigre Monday, faces El Toro,
the only other eating club still
unbeaten, to settle their league
championship. The Delts, with a
title in sight, meet Phi Kappa
Psi, while the Phi Kaps, still un
defeated after a nerve-racking
battle with Sigma Chi, play Al
pha Sig.
Intramural free throws enter
the semifinal round in each
bracket tonight, with the Theta
Delt "A's" and Delt "B's" still
looking for competition. Both
teams have been consistently
hitting 66 or 67 out of 75 shotn.
