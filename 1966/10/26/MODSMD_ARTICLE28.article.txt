## Welcome To Stanford Niceties 
### Joel Kugelmass 
There is a traditional Stanford
show to which I would like to
give some publicity, if you will
ailow me to indulge for a mo
ment. It is old, older than any
of us can remember, and has
usually been called "The Stan
ford Niceties." Tickets are ex
pensive: $525 per quarter, but
recently over ten thousand stu
dents have been involved.
This past week, to get the
ball rolling, some pre-show at
tractions were offered: (1) the
barbarous shaving of Mr. Dave
Harris, our student body presi
dent; (2) the meeting of the
student Legislature; (3) the
theft of a whole morning's Stan
ford Dailies; (4) a "Turkey
Shoot" during which a mem
ber of SAE was almost wound
ed by a saw-off rifle; (5) the as
sault of a UCLA law student on
campus; (6) the announcement
on the radio by an administra
tor that A.S.S.U. is soon to col
lapse; (7) the renewed predic
tion that students are more in
terested in pot than poetry; (8)
the spraying of a Row House
with human waste; (9) the ap
peal of two well considered judg
ments of the Judicial Council by
the University for the Univer
sity.
Given such a diversity of en
tertainments, we of course can

hardly know how to give expres
sion to our appreciation.
I would like first to review
the L.A.S.S.U. meeting, merely
because I was given the pleasure
of experiencing it directly.
L.A.S.S.U. was presented in
two acts. To commence, it was
decided that some of OUR rep
resentatives did not know a can
didate for the Committee of
Fifteen very well. Through the
use of intense dialogue, the fol
lowing questions were raised:
Dear Candidate, did you do a
good job on the committee last
week? What makes you think
you should serve on the Com
mittee? What are your qualifica
tions? What were the exact cir
cumstances of you election to
the Legislature? Dear Fellow
Member on Committee, did the
candidate do a good job last
week?
Needless to say, an immediate
I-Thou relationship was estab
lished and everyone was feeling
pretty chipper.
At one point one of YOUR
representatives said, "I want to
be represented on LASSU and
the candidate does not represent
me." Everyone much enjoyed
the irony of a representative
who is more interested in his
own views than representing the
electorate.

The Second Act was a review
of the budget for the Housing
Commission. The Legislature did
not flinch at appropriation for
five hundred cups of coffee
(over the quarter) but did ques
tion with a vigorous sense of
responsibility $350 dollars for a
survey — approximately one
hundreth the usual amount
spent on such.
Surely the genius of L.A.S.S.U.
is not clear second hand, so I
must urge you all to go next
Thursday and see whether
YOUR representative is not ac
tively contributing to the mirth.
If he isn't, he's probably not do
ing his job.
Surrounding these marvelous
features were many ad libs.
One of especial note, uttered by
a high administrator, reads:
"One of the major problems at
Stanford is the plumbing — it
wears out every year. I think,
however, the major need of
Stanford is more buildings."
It has been said that laughter
is the best medicine. This week
just everyone has been laugh
ing, and sure enough, few are
sick of what has been going on.
If you will just pull yourself
together and stop chuckling for
a moment, we can all give a big
hand for The Stanford Niceties,
a University production.

campus; (6) the announcement
on the radio by an administra
tor that A.S.S.U. is soon to col
lapse; (7) the renewed predic
tion that students are more in
terested in pot than poetry; (8)
the spraying of a Row House
with human waste; (9) the ap
peal of two well considered judg
ments of the Judicial Council by
the University for the Univer
sity.
Given such a diversity of en
tertainments, we of course can

hardly know how to give expres
sion to our appreciation.
I would like first to review
the L.A.S.S.U. meeting, merely
because I was given the pleasure
of experiencing it directly.
L.A.S.S.U. was presented in
two acts. To commence, it was
decided that some of OUR rep
resentatives did not know a can
didate for the Committee of
Fifteen very well. Through the
use of intense dialogue, the fol
lowing questions were raised:
Dear Candidate, did you do a
good job on the committee last
week? What makes you think
you should serve on the Com
mittee? What are your qualifica
tions? What were the exact cir
cumstances of you election to
the Legislature? Dear Fellow
Member on Committee, did the
candidate do a good job last
week?
Needless to say, an immediate
I-Thou relationship was estab
lished and everyone was feeling
pretty chipper.
At one point one of YOUR
representatives said, "I want to
be represented on LASSU and
the candidate does not represent
me." Everyone much enjoyed
the irony of a representative
who is more interested in his
own views than representing the
electorate.

The Second Act was a review
of the budget for the Housing
Commission. The Legislature did
not flinch at appropriation for
five hundred cups of coffee
(over the quarter) but did ques
tion with a vigorous sense of
responsibility $350 dollars for a
survey — approximately one
hundreth the usual amount
spent on such.
Surely the genius of L.A.S.S.U.
is not clear second hand, so I
must urge you all to go next
Thursday and see whether
YOUR representative is not ac
tively contributing to the mirth.
If he isn't, he's probably not do
ing his job.
Surrounding these marvelous
features were many ad libs.
One of especial note, uttered by
a high administrator, reads:
"One of the major problems at
Stanford is the plumbing — it
wears out every year. I think,
however, the major need of
Stanford is more buildings."
It has been said that laughter
is the best medicine. This week
just everyone has been laugh
ing, and sure enough, few are
sick of what has been going on.
If you will just pull yourself
together and stop chuckling for
a moment, we can all give a big
hand for The Stanford Niceties,
a University production.
There is a traditional Stanford
show to which I would like to
give some publicity, if you will
ailow me to indulge for a mo
ment. It is old, older than any
of us can remember, and has
usually been called "The Stan
ford Niceties." Tickets are ex
pensive: $525 per quarter, but
recently over ten thousand stu
dents have been involved.
This past week, to get the
ball rolling, some pre-show at
tractions were offered: (1) the
barbarous shaving of Mr. Dave
Harris, our student body presi
dent; (2) the meeting of the
student Legislature; (3) the
theft of a whole morning's Stan
ford Dailies; (4) a "Turkey
Shoot" during which a mem
ber of SAE was almost wound
ed by a saw-off rifle; (5) the as
sault of a UCLA law student on
campus; (6) the announcement
on the radio by an administra
tor that A.S.S.U. is soon to col
lapse; (7) the renewed predic
tion that students are more in
