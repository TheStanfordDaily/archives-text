# Letters To The Editor
## A 						Point Of Legal Procedure 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
I noted with interest the com
ment in Monday's Daily by Mar
tin Gerry, a member of the Ju
dicial Council, wherein he stated
that the Harris hair-cutting inci
dent is "obviously a violation of
the Fundamental Standard and
will be treated as 6uch." The
article then added that "he
(Gerry) emphasized that the
case was not being referred to
the Interfraternity Judicial
Board because prosecution
would be against individuals and
not against any entire house."
In view of these comments, it
is interesting to consider what
the Fundamental Standard says
about the Judicial Council.
"These Councils (Men's and
Women's) and their decisions
are designed to be constructive,
helpful, and educative, rather
than solely punitive. It is an
orderly manner of dealing not
only with actual violations, but
with thoughtless acts which
may erroneously give the im
pression of violations, thereby
undermining mutual confidence.
. . . When a violation has been
reported, the Council notifies
the defendant, who may supply
witnesses or information on his
behalf. ... If the Council finds
a student guilty of an Honor
Code violation, it may recom
mend penalties. . . ."
It appears that the ability of

Mr. Gerry, or of any other Ju
dicial Council member who has
similarly prejudged in this mat
ter, to act fairly and in accord
ance with the Fundamental
Standard is in serious doubt in
this case.
For those who claim that this
incident is beyond the point of
constructive, helpful, and educa
tive action, and that punitive
action is the only answer, it
should be pointed out that it
was this type of reasoning
which initially precipitated the
incident. If the Delts are to be
charged with the responsibility
of rationally and legally voicing
their objections to something
which they find distasteful, then
the Judicial Council and the Uni
versity should certainly be sim
ilarly charged. Let's not build
the gallows before the trial (in
quisition?) lest we lose sight of
the intended objectives of the
very same Fundamental Stan
dard we are purporting to up
hold.

• Assorted Assaults
Editor, The Daily:
As members of Hurlburt
House "titles" seem to be impor
tant these days—we deplore the
particularly inane assault on
David Harris, but we are
equally disgusted that it was

classified as a "typical RF." We
can see no connection between
the Phi Delt's hijacking of Dail
ies, which can be considered as
such, and this incident, which
is of admittedly bad taste. Fur
thermore, the fact that some
connection has been made with
these two actions and the Beta
Chi's "leaving • a • sinking - ship
maneuver," is out of hand.
But the most obnoxious result
—so far—is that this incident its
being used as the basis for a
full-scale attack upon the fra
ternity system per se. (Didn't
you know, all 24 fraternities
were hidden in Hurlburt's
'blushing bushes,!)

Editor, The Daily:
I suppose that through your
journal and the Dean's Office
and the mouths and pens of in
numerable faceless individuals,
it has been established, for at
least a few, that Mr. Harris
forced haircut of Thursday last
is reprehensible and all that.
However, it does not seem to me
that this is any justification for
the wholesale recrimination and
mud-slinging against fraterni
ties in general which occurred

on the Daily "Letters to the Edi
tor" page of October 24.
Furthermore, I cannot see the
Delts' action as "juvenile delin
quency" or some other conven
ient platitude can ignore the
even less responsible response
of mating their Greek letters
with a swastika which has ap
peared on campus clandestinely.
It takes rather questionable ma
turity and courage to participate
in a twenty-to-one haircut, but
it requires none at all to defame
a group of men behind their
backs with a can of paint under
the cover of darkness. If the
Delts are to be likened to a
Mississippi lynch mob, then
these clandestine painter-slan
derers are at best the gutless
cowards who throw firebombs
onto the porches of innocent in
dividuals in the night and then
courageously flee the scene.

I noted with interest the com
ment in Monday's Daily by Mar
tin Gerry, a member of the Ju
dicial Council, wherein he stated
that the Harris hair-cutting inci
dent is "obviously a violation of
the Fundamental Standard and
will be treated as 6uch." The
article then added that "he
(Gerry) emphasized that the
case was not being referred to
the Interfraternity Judicial
Board because prosecution
would be against individuals and
not against any entire house."
In view of these comments, it
is interesting to consider what
the Fundamental Standard says
about the Judicial Council.
"These Councils (Men's and
Women's) and their decisions
are designed to be constructive,
helpful, and educative, rather
than solely punitive. It is an
orderly manner of dealing not
only with actual violations, but
with thoughtless acts which
may erroneously give the im
pression of violations, thereby
undermining mutual confidence.
. . . When a violation has been
reported, the Council notifies
the defendant, who may supply
witnesses or information on his
behalf. ... If the Council finds
a student guilty of an Honor
Code violation, it may recom
mend penalties. . . ."
It appears that the ability of

Mr. Gerry, or of any other Ju
dicial Council member who has
similarly prejudged in this mat
ter, to act fairly and in accord
ance with the Fundamental
Standard is in serious doubt in
this case.
For those who claim that this
incident is beyond the point of
constructive, helpful, and educa
tive action, and that punitive
action is the only answer, it
should be pointed out that it
was this type of reasoning
which initially precipitated the
incident. If the Delts are to be
charged with the responsibility
of rationally and legally voicing
their objections to something
which they find distasteful, then
the Judicial Council and the Uni
versity should certainly be sim
ilarly charged. Let's not build
the gallows before the trial (in
quisition?) lest we lose sight of
the intended objectives of the
very same Fundamental Stan
dard we are purporting to up
hold.

Editor, The Daily:
As members of Hurlburt
House "titles" seem to be impor
tant these days—we deplore the
particularly inane assault on
David Harris, but we are
equally disgusted that it was

classified as a "typical RF." We
can see no connection between
the Phi Delt's hijacking of Dail
ies, which can be considered as
such, and this incident, which
is of admittedly bad taste. Fur
thermore, the fact that some
connection has been made with
these two actions and the Beta
Chi's "leaving • a • sinking - ship
maneuver," is out of hand.
But the most obnoxious result
—so far—is that this incident its
being used as the basis for a
full-scale attack upon the fra
ternity system per se. (Didn't
you know, all 24 fraternities
were hidden in Hurlburt's

Editor, The Daily:
I suppose that through your
journal and the Dean's Office
and the mouths and pens of in
numerable faceless individuals,
it has been established, for at
least a few, that Mr. Harris
forced haircut of Thursday last
is reprehensible and all that.
However, it does not seem to me
that this is any justification for
the wholesale recrimination and
mud-slinging against fraterni
ties in general which occurred

on the Daily "Letters to the Edi
tor" page of October 24.
Furthermore, I cannot see the
Delts' action as "juvenile delin
quency" or some other conven
ient platitude can ignore the
even less responsible response
of mating their Greek letters
with a swastika which has ap
peared on campus clandestinely.
It takes rather questionable ma
turity and courage to participate
in a twenty-to-one haircut, but
it requires none at all to defame
a group of men behind their
backs with a can of paint under
the cover of darkness. If the
Delts are to be likened to a
Mississippi lynch mob, then
these clandestine painter-slan
derers are at best the gutless
cowards who throw firebombs
onto the porches of innocent in
dividuals in the night and then
courageously flee the scene.

Editor, The Dally:
I noted with interest the com
ment in Monday's Daily by Mar
tin Gerry, a member of the Ju
dicial Council, wherein he stated
that the Harris hair-cutting inci
dent is "obviously a violation of
the Fundamental Standard and
will be treated as 6uch." The
article then added that "he
(Gerry) emphasized that the
case was not being referred to
the Interfraternity Judicial
Board because prosecution
would be against individuals and
not against any entire house."
In view of these comments, it
is interesting to consider what
the Fundamental Standard says
about the Judicial Council.
"These Councils (Men's and
Women's) and their decisions
are designed to be constructive,
helpful, and educative, rather
than solely punitive. It is an
orderly manner of dealing not
only with actual violations, but
with thoughtless acts which
may erroneously give the im
pression of violations, thereby
undermining mutual confidence.
. . . When a violation has been
reported, the Council notifies
the defendant, who may supply
witnesses or information on his
behalf. ... If the Council finds
a student guilty of an Honor
Code violation, it may recom
mend penalties. . . ."
It appears that the ability of

Mr. Gerry, or of any other Ju
dicial Council member who has
similarly prejudged in this mat
ter, to act fairly and in accord
ance with the Fundamental
Standard is in serious doubt in
this case.
For those who claim that this
incident is beyond the point of
constructive, helpful, and educa
tive action, and that punitive
action is the only answer, it
should be pointed out that it
was this type of reasoning
which initially precipitated the
incident. If the Delts are to be
charged with the responsibility
of rationally and legally voicing
their objections to something
which they find distasteful, then
the Judicial Council and the Uni
versity should certainly be sim
ilarly charged. Let's not build
the gallows before the trial (in
quisition?) lest we lose sight of
the intended objectives of the
very same Fundamental Stan
dard we are purporting to up
hold.

• Assorted Assaults
Editor, The Daily:
As members of Hurlburt
House "titles" seem to be impor
tant these days—we deplore the
particularly inane assault on
David Harris, but we are
equally disgusted that it was

classified as a "typical RF." We
can see no connection between
the Phi Delt's hijacking of Dail
ies, which can be considered as
such, and this incident, which
is of admittedly bad taste. Fur
thermore, the fact that some
connection has been made with
these two actions and the Beta
Chi's "leaving • a • sinking - ship
maneuver," is out of hand.
But the most obnoxious result
—so far—is that this incident its
being used as the basis for a
full-scale attack upon the fra
ternity system per se. (Didn't
you know, all 24 fraternities
were hidden in Hurlburt's
'blushing bushes,!)

Editor, The Daily:
I suppose that through your
journal and the Dean's Office
and the mouths and pens of in
numerable faceless individuals,
it has been established, for at
least a few, that Mr. Harris
forced haircut of Thursday last
is reprehensible and all that.
However, it does not seem to me
that this is any justification for
the wholesale recrimination and
mud-slinging against fraterni
ties in general which occurred

on the Daily "Letters to the Edi
tor" page of October 24.
Furthermore, I cannot see the
Delts' action as "juvenile delin
quency" or some other conven
ient platitude can ignore the
even less responsible response
of mating their Greek letters
with a swastika which has ap
peared on campus clandestinely.
It takes rather questionable ma
turity and courage to participate
in a twenty-to-one haircut, but
it requires none at all to defame
a group of men behind their
backs with a can of paint under
the cover of darkness. If the
Delts are to be likened to a
Mississippi lynch mob, then
these clandestine painter-slan
derers are at best the gutless
cowards who throw firebombs
onto the porches of innocent in
dividuals in the night and then
courageously flee the scene.
