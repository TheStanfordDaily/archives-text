# A 						Structural Problem
## Required Basic Seminar: Introductory Womanizing' 
### Kirk Hanen 
How often we hear the seem
ingly Irreconcilable statements
that only through a college ed
ucation can a female become a
"total" woman; that the making
of a woman, not unlike the con
struction of a building, requires
a firm foundation.
At Stanford, though, the build
ing process starts somewhere
on the thirteenth floor.
Stanford takes a female out
of high school and assumes that
the woman izing process has
been started, on the pretext of
completing it.
Any building tradesman could
give the Board of Trustees at
least five good reasons why
such an incomplete base will re
quire constant patch-up work
in the future — assuming the
whole thing doesn't collapse en
tirely.
Call The Doctor
Unfortunately the patch-up
work may require the services

of the local psychiatrist or mar
riage counselor. It's a fact of no
little consequence that wood and
concrete can be replaced—the
human psycle cannot.
Some have said that a college
education allows a woman to
more completely complement
the man who will someday be
her husband. How so.
It seems also that many cri
tics would love to see the emer
gence of a Golden Mean of Mar
riagehood—the 50-50 decision
making apparatus.
Unfortunately, a Stanford ed
ucation teaches marital respon
sibilities disproportionately.
Reversal
And there seems to be a re
versal of roles to some extent.
The undergraduate male who
lives off campus learns to feed
and clothe himself. The under
graduate female, except those
prudent few who manage to re
serve a space In the high rises,
does not learn to feed herself—
or anyone else for that matter.
(Though she may learn how to
spendt exorbitant sums on
clothes.)
In short, she comes out of
Stanford knowing zilch about
running a household.
(You remember, girls, that's
the place where your grand
mother spent most of her time.)
Instruction Needed
Would the idea of a basic
seminar in home economics
sound too gauche for an eman
cipated Stanford woman?
It probably would — judging
from the numbers who turn up
their noses at the sound of
"Marriage and Family".
But do not be deceived.
Some females are thinking
about what will eventually be
their responsibilities. One fresh
man realized the other day (in
my presence, but not at my
prodding) that she was totally
unprepared to be a wife—in the
homier sense of the word.
Howell To The Rescue
Then there's Janet Howell.
Thank the mystics for her
emergence. Maybe at her Insis
tence the Board of Trustees will
realize that girls should be able
to live in the "real world" (as
some have described it) after
they've finished out their senten
ces at Roble and Branner.
Maybe then the University
will stop arming its female off
spring with B.A. degrees and
aiming them at divorce decrees.
Oh, education! What crimes
are committed in your name.

more completely complement
the man who will someday be
her husband. How so.
It seems also that many cri
tics would love to see the emer
gence of a Golden Mean of Mar
riagehood—the 50-50 decision
making apparatus.
Unfortunately, a Stanford ed
ucation teaches marital respon
sibilities disproportionately.
Reversal
And there seems to be a re
versal of roles to some extent.
The undergraduate male who
lives off campus learns to feed
and clothe himself. The under
graduate female, except those
prudent few who manage to re
serve a space In the high rises,
does not learn to feed herself—
or anyone else for that matter.
(Though she may learn how to
spendt exorbitant sums on
clothes.)
In short, she comes out of
Stanford knowing zilch about
running a household.
(You remember, girls, that's
the place where your grand
mother spent most of her time.)
Instruction Needed
Would the idea of a basic
seminar in home economics
sound too gauche for an eman
cipated Stanford woman?
It probably would — judging
from the numbers who turn up
their noses at the sound of
"Marriage and Family".
But do not be deceived.
Some females are thinking
about what will eventually be
their responsibilities. One fresh
man realized the other day (in
my presence, but not at my
prodding) that she was totally
unprepared to be a wife—in the
homier sense of the word.
Howell To The Rescue
Then there's Janet Howell.
Thank the mystics for her
emergence. Maybe at her Insis
tence the Board of Trustees will
realize that girls should be able
to live in the "real world" (as
some have described it) after
they've finished out their senten
ces at Roble and Branner.
Maybe then the University
will stop arming its female off
spring with B.A. degrees and
aiming them at divorce decrees.
Oh, education! What crimes
are committed in your name.
How often we hear the seem
ingly Irreconcilable statements
that only through a college ed
ucation can a female become a
"total" woman; that the making
of a woman, not unlike the con
struction of a building, requires
a firm foundation.
At Stanford, though, the build
ing process starts somewhere
on the thirteenth floor.
Stanford takes a female out
of high school and assumes that
the woman izing process has
been started, on the pretext of
completing it.
Any building tradesman could
give the Board of Trustees at
least five good reasons why
such an incomplete base will re
quire constant patch-up work
in the future — assuming the
whole thing doesn't collapse en
tirely.
Call The Doctor
Unfortunately the patch-up
work may require the services

of the local psychiatrist or mar
riage counselor. It's a fact of no
little consequence that wood and
concrete can be replaced—the
human psycle cannot.
