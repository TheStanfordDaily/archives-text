## 
### STEVE GRUBER 
The Bay Guardian, a by-weekly 12-
page tabloid, was published for the
first time yesterday and distributed
in all nine Bay Area counties.
The Guardian, with 40,000 copies
in its first press run, will attempt to
"supplement the local press" accord
ing to Associate Editor Allen Velie.
English T.A.
Velie is a Stanford English teaching
assistant, as is Roger Henkle, the
managing editor. Donald Babcock,
another Stanford student, will be the
paper's drama critic.
Bruce B. Brugman, Guardian edi
tor anl publisher, has had previous
experience on the Milwaukee Journal
and the Redwood City Tribune.
According to Velie, an independent
liberal voice has been badly needed in
the Bay Area since the merger of the
San Francisco Chronicle and Exam
iner last year.
The Guardian's first editoril backed
Velie's statement, saying, "The Guard
ian believes it difficult, if not impossi
ble for a paper to be good if it is not
liberal.
Lively Writing
"This is because a good newspaper
must reflect the tenets of a liberal
faith: passion for truth, rejection of
cant and dogma, respect for the prin
ciple of doubt and dissent, concern
for civil liberties and minority rights
and an understanding that no fatal
conflict exists between the working
of an open mind and the beating of
a compassionate heart."

Due to its bi-weekly format, the
Guardian will not use the usual news
paper style in its articles. It will
attempt to make the writing as lively
as possible to make up for the lack
of news stories.
"A bi-weekly can sum up situations
that get out of hand," Velie told The
Daily. He cited Vietnam news as an
example, saying that a summary was
necessary periodically to allow the
reader a chance to gain a perspective.
The Guardian's style will include a
cartoon on the front page of each
edition.
