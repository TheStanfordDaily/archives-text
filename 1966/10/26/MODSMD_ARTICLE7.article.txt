# Austria II Troubles Not Serious--Walker
## 
### CHARLOTTE ACKERLEY Assistant Editor (First of a series) 
The Director of the Overseas Cam
pus program has flatly denied rumors
that trouble with Austria II has
forced him to find another location
for the Austrian campus.
According to Dr. Robert Walker, a
number of problems came up in the
last Austrian session, but he says they
were not as serious as has been
rumored.
Several students who recently re
turned from Stanford-in-Austria in
sist, however, that major improve
ments can and should be made in the
Austrian program.
Plush Old Hotel
They attribute many of the prob
lems to the physical set-up of the Aus
trian campus. According to Bruce
Esterline, one of the officers of the
Austrian session, the location of
the Stanford campus in a plush old
hotel is a major cause for tension.
"The Grand Hotel Panhans," he
commented, "was probably a hot spot
in the Twenties or Thirties. But ever
since the Iron Curtain fell, it's been
limping along and is now more or
less defunct.
"I'm sure Stanford is just keeping
it alive," he went on, "and yet the
staff is trying to live up to the old
image."
Charming Place
Alan Schmidt, President of Austria
II second quarter, said the Panhans is
a charming place. "But," he added,
"the plushness was made for the
Thirties and now it has died. It can
wear thin very quickly."
"The Panhans is an elegant build
ing," commented Larry Brook. "It's
very impressive, with carpets and
chandeliers and all.
"But after a couple of weeks the
glamor wears off and you notice all
the nicks and unpainted spots. It's not
bad, but it's kind of disillusioning.

It's not the perfect palace you con
jure up in your mind."
Austrian Standards
All the students were unhappy with
dress regulations, although Dr. Walk
er says they are exactly the same as
at Stanford-in-Britain. "Austrians have
a much more formal dress expecta
tion than we," he explained, "and
while our students are in Austria we
ask them to conform to Austrian
standards.
"That doesn't mean bare feet with
sandals and your shirttails hanging
out," he said.
Walker said the students must al
ways wear quad clothes to classes,
coat and tie to dinner, and jackets and
slacks "in certain situations." Accord
ing to the students, they are not al
lowed to enter the hotel lobby in
casual dress, a situation which caused
many complaints during the summer.
Staff In Tuxedoes
"The lobby is our only access to the
campus part of the hotel," Esterline
said. "It's so formal that the staff
people wear suits and often tuxedoes
in the evening."
Schmidt said the main lecture hall
was in another part of the building
and students had to go through the
main part of the hotel to reach it.
When not attending classes, stu
dents in the campus area are allowed
to go barefoot and wear levis, but
they said such dress is frowned upon.
Called 'Savages'
One boy said the hotel staff would
often call students "savages" or "bar
barians" because they were sloppily
dressed, even though within the limits
of the Stanford campus. He said one
maid called a Stanford girl a "whore."
Although Dr. Walker reports that
there were no problems with the first
group at the Panhans, he said there
was evidently a lot of tension between
the students and the staff members
during Spring and Summer.
"They just didn't trust us," Ester
line declared, "and maybe with good
reason. There was a lot of trouble
over a coffee house we wanted to put
in an unused basement room. And one
time a boy turned a glass of water
upside down on the dinner table so
it spilled all over when the waiter
picked it up."
Maids And Managers
Schmidt said there were hard feel
ings when maids — who apparently
didn't approve of students leaving
things around—would heap them all
together in a closet. "Maids and man
agers," he said, "would walk through
rooms without knocking, and there
were a couple of cases where they
accidently walked in on some un
dressed girls."
Schmidt said the staff had a "thing"
about students milling around in the
halls of the hotel. "They told us
Austrians didn't go into the halls," he
said.
Esterline claimed he was given a
lecture by a staff member for whis
tling in his corridor, and said the hotel
had a monopoly on selling wine and
charged the students double when
they wanted wine for parties.
Dr. Walker pointed out that the
campus directors got no cooperation
from students in ironing out many of
the problems which arose during the
session.
Beer And Beatles
"These students were more inter
ested in drinking beer and listening
to Beatle records, and they were bel
ligerent about it," Walker said. "They
insisted on going out in the lobby
<
making complete nuisances of them
selves and playing the record player
so loud during dinner you couldn't
think."
Walker said they turned the record
player down when he threatened to
take it away.
Some of the tensions in Austria II
seemed to stem from a "cooped-up"
feeling students attributed to the sit
uation of the Austrian campus in The

Semmering, a small village about
ninety miles from Vienna.
"It's just a one-street town," com
mented Ann Castro, "where tourists
stop off for an hour to buy cheese.
Most of the people are very old, and
they're just not stimulating.
"We couldn't tell how Austrians
live, because nobody really lives in
The Semmering," she added.
"There are about one thousand peo
ple in the town," Schmidt noted, "and
all of them cater to the tourist trade.
They run hotels and little shops and
sell ski equipment. But there just
aren't any artists, or students, or even
any industrial workers."
Brook said most of the residents in
the town shy away from the Pan
hans, because many of them remem
ber when it was reserved for "aristo
crats." "The Panhans puts the stu
dent one step away from the people
right in the beginning," he explained.
Aristocratic
"The hotel has lost a lot of it's
aristocratic air, but The Semmering
folks still think it's for rich people.
They're very reluctant to come up
there for any of our functions, and
it makes meeting families a one-way
affair."
The students report that it is im
possible to make a trip to Vienna dur
ing the week because it takes an hour
and a half to get there on the train.
Cost for a round-trip ticket is four
dollars. "These are little things," com
mented Brook, "but they didn't say
anything about them in orientation."
The students agree that since they
are expected to travel to Vienna to
observe the Austrian culture, the cam
pus should be moved there. "Vienna
is a beautiful city," said Ann, "with
cosmopolitans and a proletariat and
palacial mansions. It changes by day
and changes by night.
A Rich Tradition
"Vienna has a rich tradition, some
thing which Americans lack, and
something we expect to experience in
Austria."
"Everyone agrees that the campus
should be in Vienna," Brook com
mented, "but we are apparently not
able to get housing there."
Dr. Walker said that four possible
sites were chosen when the campus
was first being established; but were
eliminated one by one except for the
Panhans in The Semmering. He ex
plained that many of the housing fa
cilities in Austria were destroyed dur
ing the war, and the shortage has
become crucial in recent years be
cause of a tremendous increase in
population there.
Accommodations In Vienna
However, one professor commented
to an Austrian II student that he
was "ninety per cent sure" that ac
commodations could be found some
where in Vienna for less than a hun
dred students and faculty.
The overseas campuses office has
taken some steps to get Stanford
students to Vienna at least until the
lease on the Panhans runs out. Ac
cording to Dr. Walker a chartered
bus system, leaving at regular inter
vals during the week, now runs to the
city.
He also said that several planned
but not required weekend trips have
been organized so that students fan
Austria during the Spring - Summer
session won't suffer from the "sum
mer slump."
Nothing Happens
"It's true that very little goes on
in Vienna in the summertime," Dr.
Walker commented.
"The isolation argument is often
brought up in regard to The Sem
mering," ho noted. "But I think it's
somewhat questionable. It was abso
lutely no problem for the students in
Austria I."

campus directors got no cooperation
from students in ironing out many of
the problems which arose during the
session.
Beer And Beatles
"These students were more inter
ested in drinking beer and listening
to Beatle records, and they were bel
ligerent about it," Walker said. "They
insisted on going out in the lobby
<
making complete nuisances of them
selves and playing the record player
so loud during dinner you couldn't
think."
Walker said they turned the record
player down when he threatened to
take it away.
Some of the tensions in Austria II
seemed to stem from a "cooped-up"
feeling students attributed to the sit
uation of the Austrian campus in The

Semmering, a small village about
ninety miles from Vienna.
"It's just a one-street town," com
mented Ann Castro, "where tourists
stop off for an hour to buy cheese.
Most of the people are very old, and
they're just not stimulating.
"We couldn't tell how Austrians
live, because nobody really lives in
The Semmering," she added.
"There are about one thousand peo
ple in the town," Schmidt noted, "and
all of them cater to the tourist trade.
They run hotels and little shops and
sell ski equipment. But there just
aren't any artists, or students, or even
any industrial workers."
Brook said most of the residents in
the town shy away from the Pan
hans, because many of them remem
ber when it was reserved for "aristo
crats." "The Panhans puts the stu
dent one step away from the people
right in the beginning," he explained.
Aristocratic
"The hotel has lost a lot of it's
aristocratic air, but The Semmering
folks still think it's for rich people.
They're very reluctant to come up
there for any of our functions, and
it makes meeting families a one-way
affair."
The students report that it is im
possible to make a trip to Vienna dur
ing the week because it takes an hour
and a half to get there on the train.
Cost for a round-trip ticket is four
dollars. "These are little things," com
mented Brook, "but they didn't say
anything about them in orientation."
The students agree that since they
are expected to travel to Vienna to
observe the Austrian culture, the cam
pus should be moved there. "Vienna
is a beautiful city," said Ann, "with
cosmopolitans and a proletariat and
palacial mansions. It changes by day
and changes by night.
A Rich Tradition
"Vienna has a rich tradition, some
thing which Americans lack, and
something we expect to experience in
Austria."
"Everyone agrees that the campus
should be in Vienna," Brook com
mented, "but we are apparently not
able to get housing there."
Dr. Walker said that four possible
sites were chosen when the campus
was first being established; but were
eliminated one by one except for the
Panhans in The Semmering. He ex
plained that many of the housing fa
cilities in Austria were destroyed dur
ing the war, and the shortage has
become crucial in recent years be
cause of a tremendous increase in
population there.
Accommodations In Vienna
However, one professor commented
to an Austrian II student that he
was "ninety per cent sure" that ac
commodations could be found some
where in Vienna for less than a hun
dred students and faculty.
The overseas campuses office has
taken some steps to get Stanford
students to Vienna at least until the
lease on the Panhans runs out. Ac
cording to Dr. Walker a chartered
bus system, leaving at regular inter
vals during the week, now runs to the
city.
He also said that several planned
but not required weekend trips have
been organized so that students fan
Austria during the Spring - Summer
session won't suffer from the "sum
mer slump."
Nothing Happens
"It's true that very little goes on
in Vienna in the summertime," Dr.
Walker commented.
"The isolation argument is often
brought up in regard to The Sem
mering," ho noted. "But I think it's
somewhat questionable. It was abso
lutely no problem for the students in
Austria I."
(Editor note: This Is the first of a

The Director of the Overseas Cam
pus program has flatly denied rumors
that trouble with Austria II has
forced him to find another location
for the Austrian campus.
According to Dr. Robert Walker, a
number of problems came up in the
last Austrian session, but he says they
were not as serious as has been
rumored.
Several students who recently re
turned from Stanford-in-Austria in
sist, however, that major improve
ments can and should be made in the
Austrian program.
Plush Old Hotel
They attribute many of the prob
lems to the physical set-up of the Aus
trian campus. According to Bruce
Esterline, one of the officers of the
Austrian session, the location of
the Stanford campus in a plush old
hotel is a major cause for tension.
"The Grand Hotel Panhans," he
commented, "was probably a hot spot
in the Twenties or Thirties. But ever
since the Iron Curtain fell, it's been
limping along and is now more or
less defunct.
"I'm sure Stanford is just keeping
it alive," he went on, "and yet the
staff is trying to live up to the old
image."
Charming Place
Alan Schmidt, President of Austria
II second quarter, said the Panhans is
a charming place. "But," he added,
"the plushness was made for the
Thirties and now it has died. It can
wear thin very quickly."
"The Panhans is an elegant build
ing," commented Larry Brook. "It's
very impressive, with carpets and
chandeliers and all.
"But after a couple of weeks the
glamor wears off and you notice all
the nicks and unpainted spots. It's not
bad, but it's kind of disillusioning.

It's not the perfect palace you con
jure up in your mind."
Austrian Standards
All the students were unhappy with
dress regulations, although Dr. Walk
er says they are exactly the same as
at Stanford-in-Britain. "Austrians have
a much more formal dress expecta
tion than we," he explained, "and
while our students are in Austria we
ask them to conform to Austrian
standards.
"That doesn't mean bare feet with
sandals and your shirttails hanging
out," he said.
Walker said the students must al
ways wear quad clothes to classes,
coat and tie to dinner, and jackets and
slacks "in certain situations." Accord
ing to the students, they are not al
lowed to enter the hotel lobby in
casual dress, a situation which caused
many complaints during the summer.
Staff In Tuxedoes
"The lobby is our only access to the
campus part of the hotel," Esterline
said. "It's so formal that the staff
people wear suits and often tuxedoes
in the evening."
Schmidt said the main lecture hall
was in another part of the building
and students had to go through the
main part of the hotel to reach it.
When not attending classes, stu
dents in the campus area are allowed
to go barefoot and wear levis, but
they said such dress is frowned upon.
Called 'Savages'
One boy said the hotel staff would
often call students "savages" or "bar
barians" because they were sloppily
dressed, even though within the limits
of the Stanford campus. He said one
maid called a Stanford girl a "whore."
Although Dr. Walker reports that
there were no problems with the first
group at the Panhans, he said there
was evidently a lot of tension between
the students and the staff members
during Spring and Summer.
"They just didn't trust us," Ester
line declared, "and maybe with good
reason. There was a lot of trouble
over a coffee house we wanted to put
in an unused basement room. And one
time a boy turned a glass of water
upside down on the dinner table so
it spilled all over when the waiter
picked it up."
Maids And Managers
Schmidt said there were hard feel
ings when maids — who apparently
didn't approve of students leaving
things around—would heap them all
together in a closet. "Maids and man
agers," he said, "would walk through
rooms without knocking, and there
were a couple of cases where they
accidently walked in on some un
dressed girls."
Schmidt said the staff had a "thing"
about students milling around in the
halls of the hotel. "They told us
Austrians didn't go into the halls," he
said.
Esterline claimed he was given a
lecture by a staff member for whis
tling in his corridor, and said the hotel
had a monopoly on selling wine and
charged the students double when
they wanted wine for parties.
Dr. Walker pointed out that the
campus directors got no cooperation
from students in ironing out many of
the problems which arose during the
session.
Beer And Beatles
"These students were more inter
ested in drinking beer and listening
to Beatle records, and they were bel

were not as serious as has been
rumored.
Several students who recently re
turned from Stanford-in-Austria in
sist, however, that major improve
ments can and should be made in the
Austrian program.
Plush Old Hotel
They attribute many of the prob
lems to the physical set-up of the Aus
trian campus. According to Bruce
Esterline, one of the officers of the
Austrian session, the location of
the Stanford campus in a plush old
hotel is a major cause for tension.
"The Grand Hotel Panhans," he
commented, "was probably a hot spot
in the Twenties or Thirties. But ever
since the Iron Curtain fell, it's been
limping along and is now more or
less defunct.
"I'm sure Stanford is just keeping
it alive," he went on, "and yet the
staff is trying to live up to the old
image."
Charming Place
Alan Schmidt, President of Austria
II second quarter, said the Panhans is
a charming place. "But," he added,
"the plushness was made for the
Thirties and now it has died. It can
wear thin very quickly."
"The Panhans is an elegant build
ing," commented Larry Brook. "It's
very impressive, with carpets and
chandeliers and all.
"But after a couple of weeks the
glamor wears off and you notice all
the nicks and unpainted spots. It's not
bad, but it's kind of disillusioning.

It's not the perfect palace you con
jure up in your mind."
Austrian Standards
All the students were unhappy with
dress regulations, although Dr. Walk
er says they are exactly the same as
at Stanford-in-Britain. "Austrians have
a much more formal dress expecta
tion than we," he explained, "and
while our students are in Austria we
ask them to conform to Austrian
standards.
"That doesn't mean bare feet with
sandals and your shirttails hanging
out," he said.
Walker said the students must al
ways wear quad clothes to classes,
coat and tie to dinner, and jackets and
slacks "in certain situations." Accord
ing to the students, they are not al
lowed to enter the hotel lobby in
casual dress, a situation which caused
many complaints during the summer.
Staff In Tuxedoes
"The lobby is our only access to the
campus part of the hotel," Esterline
said. "It's so formal that the staff
people wear suits and often tuxedoes
in the evening."
Schmidt said the main lecture hall
was in another part of the building
and students had to go through the
main part of the hotel to reach it.
When not attending classes, stu
dents in the campus area are allowed
to go barefoot and wear levis, but
they said such dress is frowned upon.
Called 'Savages'
One boy said the hotel staff would
often call students "savages" or "bar
barians" because they were sloppily
dressed, even though within the limits
of the Stanford campus. He said one
maid called a Stanford girl a "whore."
Although Dr. Walker reports that
there were no problems with the first
group at the Panhans, he said there
was evidently a lot of tension between
the students and the staff members
during Spring and Summer.
"They just didn't trust us," Ester
line declared, "and maybe with good
reason. There was a lot of trouble
over a coffee house we wanted to put
in an unused basement room. And one
time a boy turned a glass of water
upside down on the dinner table so
it spilled all over when the waiter
picked it up."
Maids And Managers
Schmidt said there were hard feel
ings when maids — who apparently
didn't approve of students leaving
things around—would heap them all
together in a closet. "Maids and man
agers," he said, "would walk through
rooms without knocking, and there
were a couple of cases where they
accidently walked in on some un
dressed girls."
Schmidt said the staff had a "thing"
about students milling around in the
halls of the hotel. "They told us
Austrians didn't go into the halls," he
said.
Esterline claimed he was given a
lecture by a staff member for whis
tling in his corridor, and said the hotel
had a monopoly on selling wine and
charged the students double when
they wanted wine for parties.
Dr. Walker pointed out that the
campus directors got no cooperation
from students in ironing out many of
the problems which arose during the
session.
Beer And Beatles
"These students were more inter
ested in drinking beer and listening
to Beatle records, and they were bel
ligerent about it," Walker said. "They
insisted on going out in the lobby
<
making complete nuisances of them
selves and playing the record player
so loud during dinner you couldn't
think."
Walker said they turned the record
player down when he threatened to
take it away.
Some of the tensions in Austria II
seemed to stem from a "cooped-up"
feeling students attributed to the sit
uation of the Austrian campus in The

Semmering, a small village about
ninety miles from Vienna.
"It's just a one-street town," com
mented Ann Castro, "where tourists
stop off for an hour to buy cheese.
Most of the people are very old, and
they're just not stimulating.
"We couldn't tell how Austrians
live, because nobody really lives in
The Semmering," she added.
"There are about one thousand peo
ple in the town," Schmidt noted, "and
all of them cater to the tourist trade.
They run hotels and little shops and
sell ski equipment. But there just
aren't any artists, or students, or even
any industrial workers."
Brook said most of the residents in
the town shy away from the Pan
hans, because many of them remem
ber when it was reserved for "aristo
crats." "The Panhans puts the stu
dent one step away from the people
right in the beginning," he explained.
Aristocratic
"The hotel has lost a lot of it's
aristocratic air, but The Semmering
folks still think it's for rich people.
They're very reluctant to come up
there for any of our functions, and
it makes meeting families a one-way
affair."
The students report that it is im
possible to make a trip to Vienna dur
ing the week because it takes an hour
and a half to get there on the train.
Cost for a round-trip ticket is four
dollars. "These are little things," com
mented Brook, "but they didn't say
anything about them in orientation."
The students agree that since they
are expected to travel to Vienna to
observe the Austrian culture, the cam
pus should be moved there. "Vienna
is a beautiful city," said Ann, "with
cosmopolitans and a proletariat and
palacial mansions. It changes by day
and changes by night.
A Rich Tradition
"Vienna has a rich tradition, some
thing which Americans lack, and
something we expect to experience in
Austria."
"Everyone agrees that the campus
should be in Vienna," Brook com
mented, "but we are apparently not
able to get housing there."
Dr. Walker said that four possible
sites were chosen when the campus
was first being established; but were
eliminated one by one except for the
Panhans in The Semmering. He ex
plained that many of the housing fa
cilities in Austria were destroyed dur
ing the war, and the shortage has
become crucial in recent years be
cause of a tremendous increase in
population there.
Accommodations In Vienna
However, one professor commented
to an Austrian II student that he
was "ninety per cent sure" that ac
commodations could be found some
where in Vienna for less than a hun
dred students and faculty.
The overseas campuses office has
taken some steps to get Stanford
students to Vienna at least until the
lease on the Panhans runs out. Ac
cording to Dr. Walker a chartered
bus system, leaving at regular inter
vals during the week, now runs to the
city.
He also said that several planned
but not required weekend trips have
been organized so that students fan
Austria during the Spring - Summer
session won't suffer from the "sum
mer slump."
Nothing Happens
"It's true that very little goes on
in Vienna in the summertime," Dr.
Walker commented.
"The isolation argument is often
brought up in regard to The Sem
mering," ho noted. "But I think it's
somewhat questionable. It was abso
lutely no problem for the students in
Austria I."

group psychology In Austria 11, the

staff will appear later.)
The Director of the Overseas Cam
pus program has flatly denied rumors
that trouble with Austria II has
forced him to find another location
for the Austrian campus.
According to Dr. Robert Walker, a

last Austrian session, but he says they
were not as serious as has been

<
making complete nuisances of them
selves and playing the record player
so loud during dinner you couldn't
think."
Walker said they turned the record
player down when he threatened to
take it away.
Some of the tensions in Austria II
seemed to stem from a "cooped-up"
feeling students attributed to the sit
uation of the Austrian campus in The

Semmering, a small village about
ninety miles from Vienna.
"It's just a one-street town," com
mented Ann Castro, "where tourists
stop off for an hour to buy cheese.
Most of the people are very old, and
they're just not stimulating.
"We couldn't tell how Austrians
live, because nobody really lives in
The Semmering," she added.
"There are about one thousand peo
ple in the town," Schmidt noted, "and
all of them cater to the tourist trade.
They run hotels and little shops and
sell ski equipment. But there just
aren't any artists, or students, or even
any industrial workers."
Brook said most of the residents in
the town shy away from the Pan
hans, because many of them remem
ber when it was reserved for "aristo
crats." "The Panhans puts the stu
dent one step away from the people
right in the beginning," he explained.
Aristocratic
"The hotel has lost a lot of it's
aristocratic air, but The Semmering
folks still think it's for rich people.
They're very reluctant to come up
there for any of our functions, and
it makes meeting families a one-way
affair."
The students report that it is im
possible to make a trip to Vienna dur
ing the week because it takes an hour
and a half to get there on the train.
Cost for a round-trip ticket is four
dollars. "These are little things," com
mented Brook, "but they didn't say
anything about them in orientation."
The students agree that since they
are expected to travel to Vienna to
observe the Austrian culture, the cam
pus should be moved there. "Vienna
is a beautiful city," said Ann, "with
cosmopolitans and a proletariat and
palacial mansions. It changes by day
and changes by night.
A Rich Tradition
"Vienna has a rich tradition, some
thing which Americans lack, and
something we expect to experience in
Austria."
"Everyone agrees that the campus
should be in Vienna," Brook com
mented, "but we are apparently not
able to get housing there."
Dr. Walker said that four possible
sites were chosen when the campus
was first being established; but were
eliminated one by one except for the
Panhans in The Semmering. He ex
plained that many of the housing fa
cilities in Austria were destroyed dur
ing the war, and the shortage has
become crucial in recent years be
cause of a tremendous increase in
population there.
Accommodations In Vienna
However, one professor commented
to an Austrian II student that he
was "ninety per cent sure" that ac
commodations could be found some
where in Vienna for less than a hun
dred students and faculty.
The overseas campuses office has
taken some steps to get Stanford
students to Vienna at least until the
lease on the Panhans runs out. Ac
cording to Dr. Walker a chartered
bus system, leaving at regular inter
vals during the week, now runs to the
city.
He also said that several planned
but not required weekend trips have
been organized so that students fan
Austria during the Spring - Summer
session won't suffer from the "sum
mer slump."
Nothing Happens
"It's true that very little goes on
in Vienna in the summertime," Dr.
Walker commented.
"The isolation argument is often
brought up in regard to The Sem
mering," ho noted. "But I think it's
somewhat questionable. It was abso
lutely no problem for the students in
Austria I."
(Editor note: This Is the first of a

The Director of the Overseas Cam
pus program has flatly denied rumors
that trouble with Austria II has
forced him to find another location
for the Austrian campus.
According to Dr. Robert Walker, a
number of problems came up in the
last Austrian session, but he says they
were not as serious as has been
rumored.
Several students who recently re
turned from Stanford-in-Austria in
sist, however, that major improve
ments can and should be made in the
Austrian program.
Plush Old Hotel
They attribute many of the prob
lems to the physical set-up of the Aus
trian campus. According to Bruce
Esterline, one of the officers of the
Austrian session, the location of
the Stanford campus in a plush old
hotel is a major cause for tension.
"The Grand Hotel Panhans," he
commented, "was probably a hot spot
in the Twenties or Thirties. But ever
since the Iron Curtain fell, it's been
limping along and is now more or
less defunct.
"I'm sure Stanford is just keeping
it alive," he went on, "and yet the
staff is trying to live up to the old
image."
Charming Place
Alan Schmidt, President of Austria
II second quarter, said the Panhans is
a charming place. "But," he added,
"the plushness was made for the
Thirties and now it has died. It can
wear thin very quickly."
"The Panhans is an elegant build
ing," commented Larry Brook. "It's
very impressive, with carpets and
chandeliers and all.
"But after a couple of weeks the
glamor wears off and you notice all
the nicks and unpainted spots. It's not
bad, but it's kind of disillusioning.

It's not the perfect palace you con
jure up in your mind."
Austrian Standards
All the students were unhappy with
dress regulations, although Dr. Walk
er says they are exactly the same as
at Stanford-in-Britain. "Austrians have
a much more formal dress expecta
tion than we," he explained, "and
while our students are in Austria we
ask them to conform to Austrian
standards.
"That doesn't mean bare feet with
sandals and your shirttails hanging
out," he said.
Walker said the students must al
ways wear quad clothes to classes,
coat and tie to dinner, and jackets and
slacks "in certain situations." Accord
ing to the students, they are not al
lowed to enter the hotel lobby in
casual dress, a situation which caused
many complaints during the summer.
Staff In Tuxedoes
"The lobby is our only access to the
campus part of the hotel," Esterline
said. "It's so formal that the staff
people wear suits and often tuxedoes
in the evening."
Schmidt said the main lecture hall
was in another part of the building
and students had to go through the
main part of the hotel to reach it.
When not attending classes, stu
dents in the campus area are allowed
to go barefoot and wear levis, but
they said such dress is frowned upon.
Called 'Savages'
One boy said the hotel staff would
often call students "savages" or "bar
barians" because they were sloppily
dressed, even though within the limits
of the Stanford campus. He said one
maid called a Stanford girl a "whore."
Although Dr. Walker reports that
there were no problems with the first
group at the Panhans, he said there
was evidently a lot of tension between
the students and the staff members
during Spring and Summer.
"They just didn't trust us," Ester
line declared, "and maybe with good
reason. There was a lot of trouble
over a coffee house we wanted to put
in an unused basement room. And one
time a boy turned a glass of water
upside down on the dinner table so
it spilled all over when the waiter
picked it up."
Maids And Managers
Schmidt said there were hard feel
ings when maids — who apparently
didn't approve of students leaving
things around—would heap them all
together in a closet. "Maids and man
agers," he said, "would walk through
rooms without knocking, and there
were a couple of cases where they
accidently walked in on some un
dressed girls."
Schmidt said the staff had a "thing"
about students milling around in the
halls of the hotel. "They told us
Austrians didn't go into the halls," he
said.
Esterline claimed he was given a
lecture by a staff member for whis
tling in his corridor, and said the hotel
had a monopoly on selling wine and
charged the students double when
they wanted wine for parties.
Dr. Walker pointed out that the
campus directors got no cooperation
from students in ironing out many of
the problems which arose during the
session.
Beer And Beatles
"These students were more inter
ested in drinking beer and listening
to Beatle records, and they were bel
ligerent about it," Walker said. "They
insisted on going out in the lobby
<
making complete nuisances of them
selves and playing the record player
so loud during dinner you couldn't
think."
Walker said they turned the record
player down when he threatened to
take it away.

trian campus. According to Bruce
Esterline, one of the officers of the
Austrian session, the location of
the Stanford campus in a plush old
hotel is a major cause for tension.
"The Grand Hotel Panhans," he
commented, "was probably a hot spot
in the Twenties or Thirties. But ever
since the Iron Curtain fell, it's been
limping along and is now more or
less defunct.
"I'm sure Stanford is just keeping
it alive," he went on, "and yet the
staff is trying to live up to the old
image."
Charming Place
Alan Schmidt, President of Austria
II second quarter, said the Panhans is
a charming place. "But," he added,
"the plushness was made for the
Thirties and now it has died. It can
wear thin very quickly."
"The Panhans is an elegant build
ing," commented Larry Brook. "It's
very impressive, with carpets and
chandeliers and all.
"But after a couple of weeks the
glamor wears off and you notice all
the nicks and unpainted spots. It's not
bad, but it's kind of disillusioning.

It's not the perfect palace you con
jure up in your mind."
Austrian Standards
All the students were unhappy with
dress regulations, although Dr. Walk
er says they are exactly the same as
at Stanford-in-Britain. "Austrians have
a much more formal dress expecta
tion than we," he explained, "and
while our students are in Austria we
ask them to conform to Austrian
standards.
"That doesn't mean bare feet with
sandals and your shirttails hanging
out," he said.
Walker said the students must al
ways wear quad clothes to classes,
coat and tie to dinner, and jackets and
slacks "in certain situations." Accord
ing to the students, they are not al
lowed to enter the hotel lobby in
casual dress, a situation which caused
many complaints during the summer.
Staff In Tuxedoes
"The lobby is our only access to the
campus part of the hotel," Esterline
said. "It's so formal that the staff
people wear suits and often tuxedoes
in the evening."
Schmidt said the main lecture hall
was in another part of the building
and students had to go through the
main part of the hotel to reach it.
When not attending classes, stu
dents in the campus area are allowed
to go barefoot and wear levis, but
they said such dress is frowned upon.
Called 'Savages'
One boy said the hotel staff would
often call students "savages" or "bar
barians" because they were sloppily
dressed, even though within the limits
of the Stanford campus. He said one
maid called a Stanford girl a "whore."
Although Dr. Walker reports that
there were no problems with the first
group at the Panhans, he said there
was evidently a lot of tension between
the students and the staff members
during Spring and Summer.
"They just didn't trust us," Ester
line declared, "and maybe with good
reason. There was a lot of trouble
over a coffee house we wanted to put
in an unused basement room. And one
time a boy turned a glass of water
upside down on the dinner table so
it spilled all over when the waiter
picked it up."
Maids And Managers
Schmidt said there were hard feel
ings when maids — who apparently
didn't approve of students leaving
things around—would heap them all
together in a closet. "Maids and man
agers," he said, "would walk through
rooms without knocking, and there
were a couple of cases where they
accidently walked in on some un
dressed girls."
Schmidt said the staff had a "thing"
about students milling around in the
halls of the hotel. "They told us
Austrians didn't go into the halls," he
said.
Esterline claimed he was given a
lecture by a staff member for whis
tling in his corridor, and said the hotel
had a monopoly on selling wine and
charged the students double when
they wanted wine for parties.
Dr. Walker pointed out that the
campus directors got no cooperation
from students in ironing out many of
the problems which arose during the
session.
Beer And Beatles
"These students were more inter
ested in drinking beer and listening
to Beatle records, and they were bel
ligerent about it," Walker said. "They
insisted on going out in the lobby
<
making complete nuisances of them
selves and playing the record player
so loud during dinner you couldn't
think."
Walker said they turned the record
player down when he threatened to
take it away.
Some of the tensions in Austria II
seemed to stem from a "cooped-up"
feeling students attributed to the sit
uation of the Austrian campus in The

Semmering, a small village about
ninety miles from Vienna.
"It's just a one-street town," com
mented Ann Castro, "where tourists
stop off for an hour to buy cheese.
Most of the people are very old, and
they're just not stimulating.
"We couldn't tell how Austrians
live, because nobody really lives in
The Semmering," she added.
"There are about one thousand peo
ple in the town," Schmidt noted, "and
all of them cater to the tourist trade.
They run hotels and little shops and
sell ski equipment. But there just
aren't any artists, or students, or even
any industrial workers."
Brook said most of the residents in
the town shy away from the Pan
hans, because many of them remem
ber when it was reserved for "aristo
crats." "The Panhans puts the stu
dent one step away from the people
right in the beginning," he explained.
Aristocratic
"The hotel has lost a lot of it's
aristocratic air, but The Semmering
folks still think it's for rich people.
They're very reluctant to come up
there for any of our functions, and
it makes meeting families a one-way
affair."
The students report that it is im
possible to make a trip to Vienna dur
ing the week because it takes an hour
and a half to get there on the train.
Cost for a round-trip ticket is four
dollars. "These are little things," com
mented Brook, "but they didn't say
anything about them in orientation."
The students agree that since they
are expected to travel to Vienna to
observe the Austrian culture, the cam
pus should be moved there. "Vienna
is a beautiful city," said Ann, "with
cosmopolitans and a proletariat and
palacial mansions. It changes by day
and changes by night.
A Rich Tradition
"Vienna has a rich tradition, some
thing which Americans lack, and
something we expect to experience in
Austria."
"Everyone agrees that the campus
should be in Vienna," Brook com
mented, "but we are apparently not
able to get housing there."
Dr. Walker said that four possible
sites were chosen when the campus
was first being established; but were
eliminated one by one except for the
Panhans in The Semmering. He ex
plained that many of the housing fa
cilities in Austria were destroyed dur
ing the war, and the shortage has
become crucial in recent years be
cause of a tremendous increase in
population there.
Accommodations In Vienna
However, one professor commented
to an Austrian II student that he
was "ninety per cent sure" that ac
commodations could be found some
where in Vienna for less than a hun
dred students and faculty.
The overseas campuses office has
taken some steps to get Stanford
students to Vienna at least until the
lease on the Panhans runs out. Ac
cording to Dr. Walker a chartered
bus system, leaving at regular inter
vals during the week, now runs to the
city.
He also said that several planned
but not required weekend trips have
been organized so that students fan
Austria during the Spring - Summer
session won't suffer from the "sum
mer slump."
Nothing Happens
"It's true that very little goes on
in Vienna in the summertime," Dr.
Walker commented.
"The isolation argument is often
brought up in regard to The Sem
mering," ho noted. "But I think it's
somewhat questionable. It was abso
lutely no problem for the students in
Austria I."

The Director of the Overseas Cam
pus program has flatly denied rumors
that trouble with Austria II has
forced him to find another location
for the Austrian campus.
According to Dr. Robert Walker, a
number of problems came up in the
last Austrian session, but he says they
were not as serious as has been
rumored.
Several students who recently re
turned from Stanford-in-Austria in
sist, however, that major improve
ments can and should be made in the
Austrian program.
Plush Old Hotel
They attribute many of the prob
lems to the physical set-up of the Aus
trian campus. According to Bruce
Esterline, one of the officers of the
