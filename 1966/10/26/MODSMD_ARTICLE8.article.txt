# Frats Ordered To Eliminate Discrimination
## 
### 
LOUISVILLE, Ky. (CPS) â€”
The University of Louisville
laid an ultimatum before the
school's all-white fraternities
and sororities last week: stop
discriminating against Negroes
or face expulsion from campus.
University President Philip
Davidson announced the regula
tion in response to the Greeks'
requests for housing construc
tion funds. He agreed to loan 75
per cent of building costs and
to provide land only to non-dis
criminatory fraternities and
sororities.
"Fraternities and sororities
need help to survive on this
campus," President Davidson
said.
A "fraternity row" is planned
along Confederate Avenue.
Dean of Students David Law
rence said he foresaw no prob
lems in fraternity compliance
with the ruling. But three days
after the announcement, fra
ternity and sorority leaders had
no comment.
In another case, the Univer
sity of Colorado prohibited dis
crimination in fraternities and
subsequently suspended privi
leges of Sigma Chi. When the
national chapter filed suit, a
U.S. district court upheld the
University's action.
Administrators at the Univer
sities of California, Wisconsin
and Minnesota have also warned
fraternities against discrimina
tion.
