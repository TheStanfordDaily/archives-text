# Georgetown University Kicks Feds Off Campus

WASHINGTON, D.C. (CPS)
â€” The Georgetown University
Student Council, expressing fear
for student privacy, has asked
the school to crack down on
government and business inves
tigators.
In a resolution passed last
week, the five councils repre
senting Georgetown's five un
dergraduate schools asked that
investigators be barred from the
campus unless authorized by
specified members of the ad

ministration, that dormitory
counsellors be forbidden to talk
to investigators about students
and that academic data be re
leased only with student ap
proval.
Georgetown has expressed its
own concern for the student's
right of privacy. In a memoran
dum, issued before the student
meeting, it clarified its position
on Investigation, noting that
data on grades may be issued
to an authorized government
investigator on request, but that
the personnel folder may not
be issued to anyone.
Disciplinary information, the
University said, is in another
file, accessible only to the di
rector of student personnel.
In the resolution, the five
councils recognized the existence
of the University policy memo
randum but declared they still
felt their rights inadequately
protected. They contended that
"any intelligence divulged by a
(dormitory counsellor) . . . rep
resents a violation of the trust
he maintains with his charges."
University officials said they
sometimes permitted investiga
tors to talk with the counsellors.
However, Brendan Sullivan,
third year law student serving
as supervisor of counsellors in
one dormitory, said they were
not often questioned and that

as law and medical students
they were all well trained in
respecting the principles of con
fidentiality.
University officials said that
student records were not handed
over physically to investigators
even before the memorandum,
although some professors and
students say they feel it may
have been done.
