# Austria Campus: Discord Among Students
## 
### CHARLOTTE ACKERLEY Assistant Editor (Second In a series) 
Dr. Robert A. Walker, Director of the Over
seas Campuses Program, has blamed the stu
dent leadership of Austria II for problems
which arose during the last summer session
there.
In a recent interview with The Daily, Walk
er said the officers of Austria II "were hostile
with the purposes of the Overseas program."
Walker pointed out that student leadership in
the European campuses is more important
than at Stanford because officers are directly
responsible for programs and relations with
local directors.
No Cooperation
He said the elected leaders of the Austria II
summer session "insisted on making complete
nuisances of themselves and gave the local
directors no cooperation in curtailing various
problems."
"All the groups," commented Walker, "are
different. Some jell, and the students get along

with each other, open up new friendships and
interests. In others, the students remain in
dividualists or develop cliques."
"It seems to be a function of the group lead
ership," he added.
No Antagnoism
The president of the session has flatly de
nied that there was significant antagonism
within the group. Alan Schmidt, who has been
characterized by his classmates as a "Dave
Harris type", said the students actually got
along with each other fairly well.
According to Schmidt, most of the tension
within the group — which finally resulted in
a rash of judicial cases and a party at which
considerable damage was done to the campus
— can be attributed to the physical set-up of
the campus and the attitude of the local di
rector.
Many of the students interviewed said the
remote location of the campus, its formal at
mosphere and the long spells of rainy weather
made them feel frustrated and restricted. "Cer

tainly," Walker concurred, "it was a problem
of group morale."
"But," he added, "these students must real
ize that growing up implies increasing re
straints. One boy complained to me that he
felt cooped up because he couldn't go out into
the hall and shout like he could in Wilbur."
Not Like Wilbur
"Well," he said emphatically, "there is a dif
ference between a foreign campus and Wilbur.
If these students can't adapt to civilized living
Austrian style, then they shouldn't go to Aus
tria.
"Why they should elect to go abroad and
then isolate themselves from the European ex
perience is something I don't understand," he
added.
Walker explained that he was referring to
"four or five students who happened to be
elected second quarter." But he pointed out
that their actions had effect on all the group.
"Some of the students simply withdrew from
the situation," he explained, "and the whole
experience demoralized the local directors."

"There are times," he commented, "when
student elections mystify me."
Not Without Precedent
The director said the situation was not with
out precedent; twice before, once in Italy and
once in France, groups failed — as he put it —
to jell. But he noted that such was not the pat
tern in overseas sessions.
Many of the Austria students said the group
started out on the wrong foot when they got
to Semmering and discovered that the Stan
ford facilities were considerably different than
they had imagined during the orientation in
formation. They said the differences were all
small, and by themselves trivial, but added to
gether caused general disillusionment.
Bruce Esterline, Social Chairman for sum
mer session said that during one meeting at
the beginning of spring quarter, one of the
professors remarked that Austria II was sur
prisingly lacking in group spirit.
"We began to think about that," he said,
"and tried to analyze our problems, until

eventually we ended up looking for things to
be irritated about."
"The first quarter," said Rene Moss, "we
tried to figure out why we didn't have any
group spirit, but we never came to any con
clusions. The second quarter we just gave up."
"Admittedly our attitude was bad," com
mented Esterline. "For one thing there were
too many people in the group going with
people back home. And the tremendous aca
demic load got some of us down."
Some of the students said they resented
being compared to Austria I, which appar
ently was an all-around success despite or
ganizational difficulties.
"They were always the 'good group' and we
were always the 'bad group' ", Schmidt said.
Enthusiastic Session
According to Dr. Walker, the first Austria
group was one of the most spirited and enthu
siastic in overseas campuses history. The same
problems which seemed to intensify bad feel
ing and rebellion in the Spring-Summer ses-
