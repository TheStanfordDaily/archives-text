# BLACK POWER
## Cal Confab Scheduled 
### 
Now planned officially for this
Saturday, a Berkeley "Black
Power Day," similar to the one
scheduled here tomorrow, re
cently threatened to fan the em
bers of the Cal student rebellion.
The conference, sponsored by
the Berkeley chapter of Stu
dents for a Democratic Society,
will be held in the Greek Thea
ter from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. No
admission will be charged al
though contributions may be so
licited from the audience. Stan
ford SDS representatives have
said they will attempt to orga
nize car pools to the event.
Failing to receive administra
tive approval early this month,
the conference became an issue
when SDS said it would carry
out its plans in spite of the uni
versity veto.
The administrative veto was
based upon several rules which
were agreed to after the 1965
protest demonstrations.

In order to gain university
sanction, SDS members compro
mised on a number of points.
The location was changed to
the Greek Theater and the or
ganization agreed to foot the
bill for the conference, a matter
of about $500.
SDS also agreed that the con
ference will be planned and con
trolled entirely by university
students and staff. Advertising
will be directed primarily at
the university community ac
cording to the agreement.
Finally, SDS has accepted full
responsibility to see that all the
conditions agreed upon are car
ried out. The university admin
istration has stated that if it has
reliable evidence that any of
these conditions are not met or
that order is not likely to be
maintained throughout the con
ference, it will revoke its per
mission to hold the meeting.
