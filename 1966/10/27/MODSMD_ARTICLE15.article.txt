jority vote yesterday branded South Africa's
policy of Apartheid a menace to international
security and asked the Security Council to
take "all effective measures to eradicate it.
In a companion resolution, Secretary-Gen
eral U Thant was asked to set up a special
secretariat unit to deal exclusively with

may be given evils of that policy.
The Assembly approved this 85-2 with 20
abstentions. South Africa and Portugal voted

• i LanUSird > Satellite Soars
CAPE KENNEDY, Fla. —A Comsat Corp.
satellite nicknamed "Lani Bird" rocketed to
ward space yesterday—aiming to establish the
first commercial communications link across
the Pacific Ocean.
The satellite's departure from Cape Ken
nedy atop a fiery three-stage Delta rocket
capped a U.S. space doubleheader, coming less
than 13 hours after a 113-foot-tall Atlas-Cen
taur rocket achieved America's first double
ignition of high-energy, hydrogen-fueled en
gines in space.
The satellite —nicknamed "Lani" after the
Hawaiian word for "Bird of Heaven"—rocketed
from Cape Kennedy at sunset.
Project officials planned to keep the space
craft in this orbit for three days—until enough
tracking data was obtained to fire a spacecraft
motor that would cause the satellite to hover
in a stationary position, relative to earth,
22,300 above the Pacific.
A complete success was expected to even

tually clear the way for the first live television
pictures to the U.S. from Vietnam battlefields.
• Pike Faces Heresy Charges
WHEELING, W.Va.—The presiding Bishop
of the Episcopal Church said yesterday he be
lieved Bishop James A. Pike should, and
would, be kept within the church.
At the same time, Bishop John E. Hines said
he hoped heresy proceedings could be avoided
in the current controversey over Bishbp Pike's
actions and teachings.
"Someone with Bishop Pike's questing mind
is an asset to the life of the church," Bishop
Hines said at a news conference in Wheeling,
where the church's House of Bishops is meet
ing. He added that "this can be damaging if it
goes beyond certain limits."
It is Bishop Hines' task to appoint a com
mission to investigate charges against Bishop
Pike, retired Bishop of California.
Bishop Hines said he deplored the prospect
of heresy proceedings. He said he hoped the
matter "would end short, somehow, of any
heresy proceedings."
It was Bishop Pike who triggered the mech
anism which could result in a heresy trial by
asking that "rumors, reports and allegations
about him be cleared."

• i LanUSird > Satellite Soars
CAPE KENNEDY, Fla. —A Comsat Corp.
satellite nicknamed "Lani Bird" rocketed to
ward space yesterday—aiming to establish the
first commercial communications link across
the Pacific Ocean.
The satellite's departure from Cape Ken
nedy atop a fiery three-stage Delta rocket
capped a U.S. space doubleheader, coming less
than 13 hours after a 113-foot-tall Atlas-Cen
taur rocket achieved America's first double
ignition of high-energy, hydrogen-fueled en
gines in space.
The satellite —nicknamed "Lani" after the
Hawaiian word for "Bird of Heaven"—rocketed
from Cape Kennedy at sunset.
Project officials planned to keep the space
craft in this orbit for three days—until enough
tracking data was obtained to fire a spacecraft
motor that would cause the satellite to hover
in a stationary position, relative to earth,
22,300 above the Pacific.
A complete success was expected to even

tually clear the way for the first live television
pictures to the U.S. from Vietnam battlefields.
