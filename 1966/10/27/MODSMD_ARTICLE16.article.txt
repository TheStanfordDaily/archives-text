# Fraternities: Restless, Troubled, Uncertain
## 
### Pete Love 
It is an obvious fact that this
academic year will witness
"change" and "re-evaluation of
institutions, ideas, and goals to
such a degree that even an ex
pert in social change could not
begin to predict the conse
quences. Some of the changes of
this past year have been out
standing—even viewed from a
nation-wide perspective.
One often wonders, however,
whether or not all the remark
able changes which have taken
place thus far have actually been
constructive to our campus and
our society. Certain goals peo
ple have seem to become "warp
ed" over a period of time, and
the actual end product falls far
snort of the anticipated goal.
The primary reason for trouble
in institutional change results
from "attitudes" not being cor
related with "social actions."
Entirely too many social
changes have come about from
unclear thinking, destructive at
titudes, or total ambivalence in
which the worst is still to come.
Any type of social change, no
matter how insignificant it may
seem, should be regarded as
"monumental"—because it is not
merely a change in pattern of
-> particular institution but tends
to affect many other vital insti
tutions as well. Thorough in
vestigation into a problem situa
tion is vital before action is
taken. A great deal of chaos
has been created from changes
made on the spur of the mo
, tent.
Restless, Troubled
In the October issue of the
Stanford Observer, President

Wallace Sterling told the Stan
ford Leadership Conference that
"while only a conspicuous mi
nority participates in demonstra
tions, many more are troubled,
uncertain, and restless." The
ideas of this minority are good,
but the application of their ideas
to the rest of the campus com
munity are not accepted by the
great majority of students. Fra
ternity men are greatly bothered
by the minority groups but fail
themselves to speak out on is
sues. The fraternities are in
evitably coming to be placed un
der th's later category of "trou
bled, uncertain, and restless" stu
dents.
Response To Change
Fraternities have been, until
quite recently, one of the few in
stitutions which, as a whole, are
not affected by any radical so
cial changes in other areas of
campus life. Fraternities, you
might say, have been the deaf
and-dumb children among the
land of talking idiots.
It would be unfair to say that
fraternities have not responded
to change; they have in a sense,
but not, to any large degree.
Fraternities have accepted mi
nority groups, they have invited
professors to speak, and they
have supported some vital in
terests to the academic com
munity.
However, I believe along with
others, that evaluation of fra
ternity goals and purposes relat
ing to the larger scale of an
"overall attitude change" with
in a house has not been
achieved. In fact, the fraternity
system as we know it is on its
way out unless a careful re

evaluation of the "meaning" of
a fraternity is carried out.
Few fraternity men (accord
ing to a poll taken by The
Daily) believe that the Beta
Chi's action has provided any
kind of a threat to the rest of
the Stanford Greeks. However,
in contridiction to that article,
it seems to me that other fra
tternities should pay careful at
tention to their action. I would
suggest that the Beta Chi's are
right in one sense and wrong
in another. They are right in
the sense that fraternities need
changing but fundamentally
wrong in the "focus" of their
attack. From a realistic, prac
tical standpoint in regard to the
"fraternity strucure," women in
fraternity life would pose a tre
mendous number of new social
problems! It could be dealt with,
I suppose, but it seems like
there are countless other areas
which require deeper concen
tration and evaluation.
Lack Of Initiative
The fundamental problems
with fraternities are threefold.
First of all, most houses lack
any kind of overall construc
tive initiative for change . . .
they just "wallow in their own
ego-centricity." They have be
come very "inner directed," in
spite of the chronic need for
more sincere participation on a
campuswide level. It could be
likened, in a way, to the glorious
days of the Roman Empire when
Nero and his cohorts wined and
dined on the fatted calf; when
all around them Rome was
burning and a new leadership
was being devised which would
stifle and choke the noble Rom
ans.
But Nero and his men kept
wining and dining and enjoy
ing more pleasures of the flesh
—because the threat did not in
volve them directly. Or so it
seemed. But in the long run it
obviuosly did affect them be
cause the Roman Empire col
lapsed. Likewise, "the frater
nity" at Stanford.
Secondly, fraternities have a
"stifling" effect on an individual;
a person's initiative or "atti
tude" relating to participation in
activities outside his house is
quelled to a large extent. I'm
not saying that fraternity men
do not adequately participate in
outside activities, but rather that
fraternity men suffer anxiety
when they "over-participate" in
campus activities. The "house"
is supposed to be the primary
interest of all good frat men
. . . and if it isn't, then that per
son will suffer a loss in certain
privileges and "status rights"
given to the more active "house"
members.
i Artificial Levels
i Thirdly, the "lines of com
munication" in a fraternity are
i often, if not always, on super
f ficial levels. I'm not referring
here to the fact that sex, booze,
5 and money are the only topics
of conversation, but that few
j persons make serious efforts to
• communicate with any depth of

feeling or concern on any sub
ject.
Because of these artificial
communication levels, people
tend to be distinguished by the
level on which they communi
cate most of the time. A person
who acts like a comedian most
of the time is depicted as a
comedian all of the time; a guy
who plays a scapegoat role
most of the time will be expected
to be the scapegoat in all con
texts. Rarely, if ever, are these
persons given the opportunity to
communicate on other levels of
communication; much is lost in
the "total" personality of an in
dividual because of this process.
Not only do other people see
him fulfilling the role of a co
median, but he, himself, views
his "total" personality in re
lation to his role as a come
dian. The full development of
his personality has been "stifled"
through such stereotyping.
Both the Dave Harris incident
and the hijacking of the Dailies
are good examples showing
some of the basic problems with
fraternities. The lack of overall
constructive house initiative, the
"stifling" effects upon an in
dividual's discretion of the sit
uation, and negative effects re
sulting from "blocked lines of
communication" all played a
part in these incidents.
The fraternity has an impor
tan' jle to play to itself, as well
as the rest of the university
community. To be a "unit" to
tally contained within itself
with a lack of concern for the

rest of the campus is a totally
naive way of thinking.
First of all, in any negative
action a particular house takes
part in (whether it be done in an
RF manner of a sadistic man
ner), the fraternity as a "whole"
receives the blame. Secondly,
other fraternities, to an extent,
accept the blame for that house
(we're all treading on thin ice
and should realize it). Thirdly,
the campus (including faculty,
administration, etc.) accepts the
blame for singular action of
one fraternity because they' feel
they have failed in expecting and
anticipating positive action from
the fraternity.
'Blame' For Action
Why is everyone taking the
blame for "action" or failure
that is not directly their doing?
Because "the fraternity" is com
posed of some of the most con
structive, well-rounded, uncon
ceited, idealistic, and vibrant per
sonalities to be found anywhere!
But something has prevented
these desirable characteristics
from being illuminated under
the spotlight.
What is the problem? Again, it
appears to be the "stifling at
mosphere of the present fra
ternity system which is weeding
out all idealism and choking per
sonal initiative. Are fraternities
going to sit back and pretend
these verbal attacks on their

"system" are merely "gasps of
hot air coming from the turkeys
of the campus"? Or are they go
ing to take account of the situa
tion, evaluate it, and proceed to
take action?
One of the fraternites on cam
pus recently conducted an ex
periment relating to the "mean
ing" of the fraternity experi
ence. The person conducting the
experiment attempted to see if
a "new direction" for the house
was possible; he predicted before
the experiment that the fratern
ity would not respond to ef
forts to change it at this time.
Behavior Patterns
The reason for believing in the
project's doom from the start
lay in the following hypothesis:
In spite of this period of radical
change and re-evaluation of in
stitutions, ideas, and goals on a
campus level, the fraternity has
too many "patterns of behav
ior" which are so ingrained in
the members' thinking which
will not accept any radical
changes. For example, things
much as Hell Week, derision
oriented humor (pointed at an
other person), physique consci
ousness .status awareness, etc.,
are so much a part of the fra
ternity; they all seem to be
passed on from year to year
without much change in their
basic content.
The first discovery was that
people appeared to have many
different interpretations and
analyses of the "fraternity ex
perience" when questioned alone
as opposed to their thought and
actions when viewed as a part
of the larger fraternity unit.
Individual members thought
"communication" or the lack of
it seemed to be one of the basic
problems of the house.
As one fraternity member put
it,"The house isn't much more

than a heterogeneous collection
of students, each of them going
his own separate way. It'll be
kind of sad to think of five years
from now. When running into an
old 'brother' on the street, I
guess we'll still talk about the
same old superficial garbage in
the same old superficial way."
The real test of the experi
ment came about at a house
meeting where various men with
distinct stereotypes within the
fraternity tried to erase some of
the misconceptions of their per
sonalities. They attempted to re
late in a totally "new," sincere
way with the rest of the house.
Other members of the fraternity
were shocked, but evidently im
pressed.
Serious Analysis
Although this partciular house
has not changed its "direction"
in any radically new path, none
theless, the experiment was
pleasantly surprised to note that
members of the fraternity were
now discussing major issues
which previously had never been
considered for serious analysis.
The last thing heard was than
an "all-house" hostel was in
the process of being planned. It
is hoped that this hostel would
attempt to clarify "meaning" of
the fraternity and erase some
of the superficial standards and
artificial concepts which are still
in existence. Most of all it is
hoped that the "fraternity ex
perience" can aid a man in de
veloping his full potential ... in
regard to shaping his own
"unique" personality and in
stimulating his constructive role
to society.

An active member of Theta Delta Chi, Pete Love examines the
fraternity system at Stanford in light of the major changes taking
place in other areas of campus life. Speaking as an individual,
Love believes fraternities have an important role to play in the
life of the community. However he sights "blocked lines of com
munication" and several of negative features of the system which
are presently hindering fraternities at Stanford.
