for the Hamburg Program.
Students accepted for this program
will spend four months in Hamburg.
In preparation for their courses at the
Summer Session of the University of
Hamburg, students will do extensive
work in Hamburg from April 1 to
May 1 with Professor Boeninger and
Miss Schipporeit of the Stanford staff.
From May 1 until July 31 they will be
enrolled in those courses offered by
the University of Hamburg which in
terest them. It is expected that all
students will participate in field trips
and attend plays, operas ,and guest
lecturers.
The program, now in its sixth year,
has previously been limited to Ger
man majors. Under the new policy
qualified juniors, seniors, and grad
uate students majoring in German
or History are eligible. In order to
be considered, students must have a
B average in German. Minimum lan
guage requirements are German
courses Gill, Gll2, GlOO, and at least
one course in the 130 series or the
140 series.
Students who have attended one of
the overseas campuses are eligible,
and those who have taken GB5 or
GB6 at Stanford in Germany or Stan
ford in Austria may be exempted from

some or all of the required German
courses.
Financially, the Hamburg Program
operates on the same principle as the
overseas campuses. Students pay reg
ular tuition, room, and board fees for
two quarters at Stanford. The Uni
versity will pay for air transportation
to Hamburg and for room and board
while there.
Students must pay their own way
back, but financial aid is available for
those who will need it. Field trips
and theater tickets will be provided
by the University.
In the six years since its inception
the program has enabled some 45 Ger
man majors to study at the Univer
sity. In contrast to the overseas cam
puses, students enrolled in the pro
gram "actually live in German so
ciety," according to Professor Wil
liam Meads, Advisor for Undergrad
uate German majors.
The extension of the program to
qualified History majors should make
the competition for places much
tougher this year. There are no im
mediate plans to expand the program
to more than 15 students annually.
This year German History majors
