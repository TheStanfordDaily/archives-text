## Gerry Clarifies Legal Terms 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Lost my comments to The
Daily, quoted in Monday's issue,
stir more comment, I wish to
state that, alas, I have been
misquoted. What I stated to
The Daily reporter who spoke
to me over the phone was that
the case had been referred to
the council as a violation of the
Fundamental Standard and that
the case would be treated as
such. I did not state that it was
obvious that such a violation, in
fact, existed, or that I had de
cided that it existed. "Treated as
such" referred to the type of
issue before the council and not
the council's decision.
With regard to my use of the
word "prosecution" I would like
to point out (without reference
to latin sources) that the word
indicates a further judicial ac
tion (to prosecute an appeal)
and not a puntive decision. I
can only feel that Mr. Garner is
confused as to the difference
between persecution and prose
cution. MARTIN GERRY
• Challenge
Editor, The Daily:
It seems to me that as much
prejudice exists against fratern
ities as it is alleged exists within
them. Diane Middlebrook's let
ter is a glaring example of it.
Apparently her ideas of what
fraternities are like come from
such sources as The Daily edi
torial page rather than through
any direct contact with them.
Witness her description of the
Delt house as "a group whose
membership is selective .along
lines of racial and religious pre
judice". This exemplifies how
little she actually knows about
the Delts.
I think this is true of many
people who are always critical
of the fraternity system. They
often simply don't know what
a fraternity is, or see it only
from an external view. This ex
ternal view of fraternities
stereotypes them as houses
within which groups of guys
live, and which throw parties
every week-end. These people
seem to overlook the fact that
a fraternity is more than the
house that contains it. A fra
ternity is an organic body, com
posed of the people who form its
membership. The fraternity of
fers, then, more than simply a
place to live, it offers people. It
offers people who, due to a mu
tually selective process, are gen
erally enjoyable to live with,
and it provides fertile grounds
on which many meaningful and
close relationships grow.
Dave Harris is certainly a
challenge to the fraternity sys
tem, but he needn't be seen as
a necessarily destructive force
in this sense. For Dave is chal
lenging the fraternities to prove
that they serve a useful and con
structive purpose in the overall
education of the Stanford stu
dent. Dave has extended this
challenge to all living groups,
yet few have responded to it.
The dormitories and eating
clubs are no less guilty on this
count than are the fraternities.
It is significant that one living
group, a fraternity, Beta Chi,
has endeavored to meet this
challenge. Other houses, too, are

doing some serious thinking
about their place within the uni
versity and are initiating posi
tive programs, though these
may be internal changes, and
thus not subject to the wide
spread publicity Beta Chi re
ceived.
Certainly recent incidents
have put the fraternities in a
bad light. That these actions by
members of certain houses were
deplorable is undeniable. How
ever, it must be recognized that
each fraternity on campus is
composed of different people,
and that each house has a dif
ferent character, some being so
diverse as to defy characteriza
tion. To hold the Greeks as a
whole responsible for the action
of groups within particular
houses shows a lack of under
standing and a narrow-minded
ness that often characterizes
those who so strongly oppose
Stanford's fraternity system.

• Sneer Leaders
Editor, The Dally:
I would like to comment on
the disgraceful way in which
the student body supports its
teams. Having been to both
home games this year, I see
little display of maturity in
in which a student can take
pride. I am referring to the
manner, if it merits being called
a manner, by which we cheer
our football team on to victory.
Granted that we may not have
the best football squad on the
coast, still we do nothing what
ever to support what is, never
theless, our team. I have yet to
hear an enthusiastic cheer ema
nate from the student section.
Surely more spirit is shown
each game by the youngsters
from the Palo Alto area.
Having a losing team is no
disgrace for a university with
as much prestige and respect as
Stanford. But to idly sit by as
though one is ashamed to identi
fy with one's team is a disgrace
indeed. I wonder how the team
feels out there on the field alone.
Our yell leaders are at present
more interested in finding little
obscene cheers, or cheers with
clever little double meanings
than they are in putting forth
an honest and enthusiastic sup
porting yell. Many of the stu
dents would welcome the oppor
tunity to give out with their
lungs if they were ever lead ab
ly. As it stands now, the yell
leaders direct a small part of
the students in their lousy am
biguous "cheers" while the rest
of the students sit by and
sneer or chuckle at its salty im
plications.
Students should take the initi
ative, if the leaders won't, and
start their own cheers; clean,
honest, and loud. I'm sure it
wouldn't matter if we walked
off the field victorious or not, as
long as we really gave all we
had to our squad's efforts. And
we would have the respect of
our opponents as well as our
selves. CARY DICTOR
• Business Concern
Editor, The Dally:
Mr. Stewart's denunciation of
Mr. Hass's evaluation of the

Stanford Business School is a
distortion both of Hofstadter's
ideas and of Hass's observa
tions.
According to Stewart, Hass is
"Paranoic .... seeing the in
stitution of American business
as near conspiratorial in its big
ness . . . badness ... etc."
Actually, Hass has shown in his
letters an empathy with and a
concern for the businessman as
a human being (re Oct. 20's
Daily), not the undifferentiating
paranoic rejection of the busi
nessman that Mr. Stewart im
plies.
Hass's basic point is that
"American business ... is de
humanizing to the people who
engage in it because its object
is not to produce the best kinds
of goods and services for men",
but rather to accrue profit. He
is not pointing to a "conspiracy"
in business, but of an underex
amined set of values that is lag
ging behind the ethical demands
of intelligent men. The nine
teenth-century justification of
of the profit "ethic" has been
so strongly and persistently crit
icized that it is no longer able
(if it ever really was) to be a
sustaining philosophy behind a
reflective man's life work.
And, as Hass's experience
with men in business showed, a
man who cannot believe in the
value of his work usually be
comes quite cynical.
If the whole-page letter (p. 4
Oct. 20 Daily) by Motorola's
Board Chairman Robert Galvin
is significant, businessmen also
are concerned, like Hass, with
the increasing feeling that bus
iness cannotoffer "the opportun
ity for the personal satisfaction
that comes from humanitarian
service." (Galvin)
For, to further quote, Galvin,
"(business and humanitarian
philosophy) don't understand
each other well enough . . . we
don't communicate enough . . .
I propose we set a specific
course to try to resolve this."
May the Stanford Business
School recognize Hass's con
cern as concern, and do the
same. MARY HANSON
• Review
Editor, The Daily:
I doubt that any intelligent
reader took seriously Bruce
Merry's review of TWENTY
YEARS OF STANFORD
SHORT STORIES in the Oc
tober 19th Daily; even if he had
not expressed contempt for com
petence, the incompetence of his
prose would have conveyed the
idea. And what critical dicta!
Stories about "pregnancy and
child raising" are automatically
bad, and stories which do not
deal with those subjects are
automatically at least partly
good. A book of short stories
should contain "jokes." The "dis
tinguishing mark of the great
writer" is that he gives us a
character outside his own sex
or generation.
Not only does Mr. Merry

confuse two things about which
he obviously knows little, life
and art, and miss the point of
virtually every story he dis
cusses, but he also treats the
stories as if he were the pro
fessor (which if he is, God help
us) and they "student" stories.
It would seem only fair to have
mentioned that most of these
stories have been published in
highly respectable places, sev
eral in the New Yorker and in
Harper's, for instance.
The book is a splendid one.
It will stand up with any book
of short stories you want to con
sider. The failure of Stanford
to recognize what has been done
on its own campus, although
printed and bound and awaiting
intelligent discovery, and what
is still going on there, is typical
enough, but hardly encouraging.
When I was at Stanford, the re
views were bad generally for the
same reasons as are the re
views in your October 19th is
sue. Won't some editor please in
struct reviewers to write not of
arrogance, but out of a richly
deserved humility?

• Smooth Sailing
Editor, The Daily:
My knowledge of sailing is
limited and I am trying to
learn more about this sport.
Fortunately the Stanford Sail
ing Association seems to be run
by some of the most competent
sailors one can find. Their rac
ing record would confirm this,
to say nothing of the high re
gard that exists elsewhere to
wards the association.
I attended the general meet
ing on October 12 to become
better acquainted with the sail
ors. The election of officers was
run smoothy and with the same
competence that always seems
to be present within the asso
ciation. After this the discussion
went to the two new 30-foot
boats that were donated and to
the racing possibilities they
provide, and thereafter, to how
the sailing team had done, was
doing and was expected to do in
the future.
It seems a pity that all the
quality and excellence within
the association is not more read
ily distributed to those of us
who are desperately trying to
find which end of the boat comes
first. I feel certain that at least
four out of every five members
are not as fortunate as those
who run the club in their sail
ing abilities, and should not the
association be oriented more to
those of us who need to learn?

• Smooth Sailing
Editor, The Daily:
My knowledge of sailing is
limited and I am trying to
learn more about this sport.
Fortunately the Stanford Sail
ing Association seems to be run
by some of the most competent
sailors one can find. Their rac
ing record would confirm this,
to say nothing of the high re
gard that exists elsewhere to
wards the association.
I attended the general meet
ing on October 12 to become
better acquainted with the sail
ors. The election of officers was
run smoothy and with the same
competence that always seems
to be present within the asso
ciation. After this the discussion
went to the two new 30-foot
boats that were donated and to
the racing possibilities they
provide, and thereafter, to how
the sailing team had done, was
doing and was expected to do in
the future.
It seems a pity that all the
quality and excellence within
the association is not more read
ily distributed to those of us
who are desperately trying to
find which end of the boat comes
first. I feel certain that at least
four out of every five members
are not as fortunate as those
who run the club in their sail
ing abilities, and should not the
association be oriented more to
those of us who need to learn?

• Hope
Editor, The Daily:
I do hope the Delts were fore
sighted enough to save the
hair; it ought to work up nicely
into shirts for all the brothers.
ANN LAPIDES
Editor, The Daily:
Lost my comments to The
Daily, quoted in Monday's issue,
stir more comment, I wish to
state that, alas, I have been
misquoted. What I stated to
The Daily reporter who spoke
to me over the phone was that
the case had been referred to
the council as a violation of the
Fundamental Standard and that
the case would be treated as
such. I did not state that it was
obvious that such a violation, in
fact, existed, or that I had de
cided that it existed. "Treated as
such" referred to the type of
issue before the council and not
the council's decision.
With regard to my use of the
word "prosecution" I would like
to point out (without reference
to latin sources) that the word
indicates a further judicial ac
tion (to prosecute an appeal)
and not a puntive decision. I
can only feel that Mr. Garner is
confused as to the difference
between persecution and prose
cution. MARTIN GERRY
• Challenge
Editor, The Daily:
It seems to me that as much
prejudice exists against fratern
ities as it is alleged exists within
them. Diane Middlebrook's let
ter is a glaring example of it.
Apparently her ideas of what
fraternities are like come from
such sources as The Daily edi
torial page rather than through
any direct contact with them.
Witness her description of the
Delt house as "a group whose
membership is selective .along
lines of racial and religious pre
judice". This exemplifies how
little she actually knows about
the Delts.
I think this is true of many
people who are always critical
of the fraternity system. They
often simply don't know what
a fraternity is, or see it only
from an external view. This ex
ternal view of fraternities
stereotypes them as houses
within which groups of guys
live, and which throw parties
every week-end. These people
seem to overlook the fact that
a fraternity is more than the
house that contains it. A fra
ternity is an organic body, com
posed of the people who form its
membership. The fraternity of
fers, then, more than simply a
place to live, it offers people. It
offers people who, due to a mu
tually selective process, are gen
erally enjoyable to live with,
and it provides fertile grounds
on which many meaningful and
close relationships grow.
Dave Harris is certainly a
challenge to the fraternity sys
tem, but he needn't be seen as
a necessarily destructive force
in this sense. For Dave is chal
lenging the fraternities to prove
that they serve a useful and con
structive purpose in the overall
education of the Stanford stu
dent. Dave has extended this
challenge to all living groups,
yet few have responded to it.
The dormitories and eating
clubs are no less guilty on this
count than are the fraternities.
It is significant that one living
group, a fraternity, Beta Chi,
has endeavored to meet this
challenge. Other houses, too, are

doing some serious thinking
about their place within the uni
versity and are initiating posi
tive programs, though these
may be internal changes, and
thus not subject to the wide
spread publicity Beta Chi re
ceived.
Certainly recent incidents
have put the fraternities in a
bad light. That these actions by
members of certain houses were
deplorable is undeniable. How
ever, it must be recognized that
each fraternity on campus is
composed of different people,
and that each house has a dif
ferent character, some being so
diverse as to defy characteriza
tion. To hold the Greeks as a
whole responsible for the action
of groups within particular
houses shows a lack of under
standing and a narrow-minded
ness that often characterizes
those who so strongly oppose
Stanford's fraternity system.

• Sneer Leaders
Editor, The Dally:
I would like to comment on
the disgraceful way in which
the student body supports its
teams. Having been to both
home games this year, I see
little display of maturity in
in which a student can take
pride. I am referring to the
manner, if it merits being called
a manner, by which we cheer
our football team on to victory.
Granted that we may not have
the best football squad on the
coast, still we do nothing what
ever to support what is, never
theless, our team. I have yet to
hear an enthusiastic cheer ema
nate from the student section.
Surely more spirit is shown
each game by the youngsters
from the Palo Alto area.
Having a losing team is no
disgrace for a university with
as much prestige and respect as
Stanford. But to idly sit by as
though one is ashamed to identi
fy with one's team is a disgrace
indeed. I wonder how the team
feels out there on the field alone.
Our yell leaders are at present
more interested in finding little
obscene cheers, or cheers with
clever little double meanings
than they are in putting forth
an honest and enthusiastic sup
porting yell. Many of the stu
dents would welcome the oppor
tunity to give out with their
lungs if they were ever lead ab
ly. As it stands now, the yell
leaders direct a small part of
the students in their lousy am
biguous "cheers" while the rest
of the students sit by and
sneer or chuckle at its salty im
plications.
Students should take the initi
ative, if the leaders won't, and
start their own cheers; clean,
honest, and loud. I'm sure it
wouldn't matter if we walked
off the field victorious or not, as
long as we really gave all we
had to our squad's efforts. And
we would have the respect of
our opponents as well as our
selves. CARY DICTOR
• Business Concern
Editor, The Dally:
Mr. Stewart's denunciation of
Mr. Hass's evaluation of the

Stanford Business School is a
distortion both of Hofstadter's
ideas and of Hass's observa
tions.
According to Stewart, Hass is
"Paranoic .... seeing the in
stitution of American business
as near conspiratorial in its big
ness . . . badness ... etc."
Actually, Hass has shown in his
letters an empathy with and a
concern for the businessman as
a human being (re Oct. 20's
Daily), not the undifferentiating
paranoic rejection of the busi
nessman that Mr. Stewart im
plies.
Hass's basic point is that
"American business ... is de
humanizing to the people who
engage in it because its object
is not to produce the best kinds
of goods and services for men",
but rather to accrue profit. He
is not pointing to a "conspiracy"
in business, but of an underex
amined set of values that is lag
ging behind the ethical demands
of intelligent men. The nine
teenth-century justification of
of the profit "ethic" has been
so strongly and persistently crit
icized that it is no longer able
(if it ever really was) to be a
sustaining philosophy behind a
reflective man's life work.
And, as Hass's experience
with men in business showed, a
man who cannot believe in the
value of his work usually be
comes quite cynical.
If the whole-page letter (p. 4
Oct. 20 Daily) by Motorola's
Board Chairman Robert Galvin
is significant, businessmen also
are concerned, like Hass, with
the increasing feeling that bus
iness cannotoffer "the opportun
ity for the personal satisfaction
that comes from humanitarian
service." (Galvin)
For, to further quote, Galvin,
"(business and humanitarian
philosophy) don't understand
each other well enough . . . we
don't communicate enough . . .
I propose we set a specific
course to try to resolve this."
May the Stanford Business
School recognize Hass's con
cern as concern, and do the
same. MARY HANSON
• Review
Editor, The Daily:
I doubt that any intelligent
reader took seriously Bruce
Merry's review of TWENTY
YEARS OF STANFORD
SHORT STORIES in the Oc
tober 19th Daily; even if he had
not expressed contempt for com
petence, the incompetence of his
prose would have conveyed the
idea. And what critical dicta!
Stories about "pregnancy and
child raising" are automatically
bad, and stories which do not
deal with those subjects are
automatically at least partly
good. A book of short stories
should contain "jokes." The "dis
tinguishing mark of the great
writer" is that he gives us a
character outside his own sex
or generation.
Not only does Mr. Merry

confuse two things about which
he obviously knows little, life
and art, and miss the point of
virtually every story he dis
cusses, but he also treats the
stories as if he were the pro
fessor (which if he is, God help
us) and they "student" stories.
It would seem only fair to have
mentioned that most of these
stories have been published in
highly respectable places, sev
eral in the New Yorker and in
Harper's, for instance.
The book is a splendid one.
It will stand up with any book
of short stories you want to con

to recognize what has been done
on its own campus, although

so strongly and persistently crit
icized that it is no longer able
(if it ever really was) to be a
sustaining philosophy behind a
reflective man's life work.
And, as Hass's experience
with men in business showed, a
man who cannot believe in the
value of his work usually be
comes quite cynical.
If the whole-page letter (p. 4
Oct. 20 Daily) by Motorola's
Board Chairman Robert Galvin
is significant, businessmen also
are concerned, like Hass, with
the increasing feeling that bus
iness cannotoffer "the opportun

that comes from humanitarian
service." (Galvin)
For, to further quote, Galvin,
"(business and humanitarian
philosophy) don't understand
each other well enough . . . we
don't communicate enough . . .
I propose we set a specific
course to try to resolve this."
May the Stanford Business
School recognize Hass's con
cern as concern, and do the
same. MARY HANSON
• Review
Editor, The Daily:
I doubt that any intelligent
reader took seriously Bruce
Merry's review of TWENTY
YEARS OF STANFORD
SHORT STORIES in the Oc
tober 19th Daily; even if he had
not expressed contempt for com
petence, the incompetence of his
prose would have conveyed the
idea. And what critical dicta!
Stories about "pregnancy and
child raising" are automatically
bad, and stories which do not
deal with those subjects are
automatically at least partly
good. A book of short stories
should contain "jokes." The "dis
tinguishing mark of the great
writer" is that he gives us a
character outside his own sex
or generation.
Not only does Mr. Merry

confuse two things about which
he obviously knows little, life
and art, and miss the point of
virtually every story he dis
cusses, but he also treats the
stories as if he were the pro
fessor (which if he is, God help
us) and they "student" stories.
It would seem only fair to have
mentioned that most of these
stories have been published in
highly respectable places, sev
eral in the New Yorker and in
Harper's, for instance.
The book is a splendid one.
It will stand up with any book
of short stories you want to con
sider. The failure of Stanford
to recognize what has been done
on its own campus, although
printed and bound and awaiting
intelligent discovery, and what
is still going on there, is typical
enough, but hardly encouraging.
When I was at Stanford, the re
views were bad generally for the
same reasons as are the re
views in your October 19th is
sue. Won't some editor please in
struct reviewers to write not of
arrogance, but out of a richly
deserved humility?

• Smooth Sailing
Editor, The Daily:
My knowledge of sailing is
limited and I am trying to
learn more about this sport.
Fortunately the Stanford Sail
ing Association seems to be run
by some of the most competent
sailors one can find. Their rac
ing record would confirm this,
to say nothing of the high re
gard that exists elsewhere to
wards the association.
I attended the general meet
ing on October 12 to become
better acquainted with the sail
ors. The election of officers was
run smoothy and with the same
competence that always seems
to be present within the asso
ciation. After this the discussion
went to the two new 30-foot
boats that were donated and to
the racing possibilities they
provide, and thereafter, to how
the sailing team had done, was
doing and was expected to do in
the future.
It seems a pity that all the
quality and excellence within
the association is not more read
ily distributed to those of us
who are desperately trying to
find which end of the boat comes
first. I feel certain that at least
four out of every five members
are not as fortunate as those
who run the club in their sail
ing abilities, and should not the
association be oriented more to
those of us who need to learn?

Editor, The Daily:
Lost my comments to The
Daily, quoted in Monday's issue,

state that, alas, I have been
misquoted. What I stated to
The Daily reporter who spoke
to me over the phone was that
the case had been referred to

Fundamental Standard and that
the case would be treated as
such. I did not state that it was
obvious that such a violation, in
fact, existed, or that I had de
cided that it existed. "Treated as
such" referred to the type of
issue before the council and not
the council's decision.
With regard to my use of the
word "prosecution" I would like
to point out (without reference
to latin sources) that the word

• Challenge
Editor, The Daily:
It seems to me that as much
prejudice exists against fratern
ities as it is alleged exists within
them. Diane Middlebrook's let
ter is a glaring example of it.
Apparently her ideas of what
fraternities are like come from
such sources as The Daily edi
torial page rather than through
any direct contact with them.
Witness her description of the
Delt house as "a group whose
membership is selective .along
lines of racial and religious pre
judice". This exemplifies how
little she actually knows about
the Delts.
I think this is true of many
people who are always critical
of the fraternity system. They
often simply don't know what
a fraternity is, or see it only
from an external view. This ex
ternal view of fraternities
stereotypes them as houses
within which groups of guys
live, and which throw parties
every week-end. These people
seem to overlook the fact that
a fraternity is more than the
house that contains it. A fra
ternity is an organic body, com
posed of the people who form its
membership. The fraternity of
fers, then, more than simply a
place to live, it offers people. It
offers people who, due to a mu
tually selective process, are gen
erally enjoyable to live with,
and it provides fertile grounds
on which many meaningful and
close relationships grow.
Dave Harris is certainly a
challenge to the fraternity sys
tem, but he needn't be seen as
a necessarily destructive force
in this sense. For Dave is chal
lenging the fraternities to prove
that they serve a useful and con
structive purpose in the overall
education of the Stanford stu
dent. Dave has extended this
challenge to all living groups,
yet few have responded to it.
The dormitories and eating
clubs are no less guilty on this
count than are the fraternities.
It is significant that one living
group, a fraternity, Beta Chi,
has endeavored to meet this
challenge. Other houses, too, are

doing some serious thinking
about their place within the uni
versity and are initiating posi
tive programs, though these
may be internal changes, and
thus not subject to the wide
spread publicity Beta Chi re
ceived.
Certainly recent incidents
have put the fraternities in a
bad light. That these actions by
members of certain houses were
deplorable is undeniable. How
ever, it must be recognized that
each fraternity on campus is
composed of different people,
and that each house has a dif
ferent character, some being so
diverse as to defy characteriza
tion. To hold the Greeks as a
whole responsible for the action
of groups within particular
houses shows a lack of under
standing and a narrow-minded
ness that often characterizes
those who so strongly oppose
Stanford's fraternity system.

• Sneer Leaders
Editor, The Dally:
I would like to comment on
the disgraceful way in which
the student body supports its
teams. Having been to both
home games this year, I see
little display of maturity in
in which a student can take
pride. I am referring to the
manner, if it merits being called
a manner, by which we cheer
our football team on to victory.
Granted that we may not have
the best football squad on the
coast, still we do nothing what
ever to support what is, never
theless, our team. I have yet to
hear an enthusiastic cheer ema
nate from the student section.
Surely more spirit is shown
each game by the youngsters
from the Palo Alto area.
Having a losing team is no
disgrace for a university with
as much prestige and respect as
Stanford. But to idly sit by as
though one is ashamed to identi
fy with one's team is a disgrace
indeed. I wonder how the team
feels out there on the field alone.
Our yell leaders are at present
more interested in finding little
obscene cheers, or cheers with
clever little double meanings
than they are in putting forth
an honest and enthusiastic sup
porting yell. Many of the stu
dents would welcome the oppor
tunity to give out with their
lungs if they were ever lead ab
ly. As it stands now, the yell
leaders direct a small part of
the students in their lousy am
biguous "cheers" while the rest
of the students sit by and
sneer or chuckle at its salty im
plications.
Students should take the initi
ative, if the leaders won't, and
start their own cheers; clean,
honest, and loud. I'm sure it
wouldn't matter if we walked
off the field victorious or not, as
long as we really gave all we
had to our squad's efforts. And
we would have the respect of
our opponents as well as our
selves. CARY DICTOR
• Business Concern
Editor, The Dally:
Mr. Stewart's denunciation of
Mr. Hass's evaluation of the

Stanford Business School is a
distortion both of Hofstadter's
ideas and of Hass's observa
tions.
According to Stewart, Hass is
"Paranoic .... seeing the in
stitution of American business
as near conspiratorial in its big
ness . . . badness ... etc."
Actually, Hass has shown in his
letters an empathy with and a
concern for the businessman as
a human being (re Oct. 20's
Daily), not the undifferentiating
paranoic rejection of the busi
nessman that Mr. Stewart im
plies.
Hass's basic point is that
"American business ... is de
humanizing to the people who
engage in it because its object
is not to produce the best kinds
of goods and services for men",
but rather to accrue profit. He
is not pointing to a "conspiracy"
in business, but of an underex
amined set of values that is lag
ging behind the ethical demands
of intelligent men. The nine
teenth-century justification of
of the profit "ethic" has been
so strongly and persistently crit
icized that it is no longer able
(if it ever really was) to be a
sustaining philosophy behind a
reflective man's life work.
And, as Hass's experience

feels out there on the field alone.
Our yell leaders are at present
more interested in finding little
obscene cheers, or cheers with
clever little double meanings
than they are in putting forth
an honest and enthusiastic sup
porting yell. Many of the stu
dents would welcome the oppor
tunity to give out with their
lungs if they were ever lead ab
ly. As it stands now, the yell
leaders direct a small part of
the students in their lousy am
biguous "cheers" while the rest
of the students sit by and
sneer or chuckle at its salty im
plications.
Students should take the initi
ative, if the leaders won't, and
start their own cheers; clean,
honest, and loud. I'm sure it
wouldn't matter if we walked
off the field victorious or not, as
long as we really gave all we
had to our squad's efforts. And
we would have the respect of
our opponents as well as our

• Business Concern
Editor, The Dally:
Mr. Stewart's denunciation of
Mr. Hass's evaluation of the

Stanford Business School is a
distortion both of Hofstadter's
ideas and of Hass's observa
tions.
According to Stewart, Hass is
"Paranoic .... seeing the in
stitution of American business
as near conspiratorial in its big
ness . . . badness ... etc."
Actually, Hass has shown in his
letters an empathy with and a
concern for the businessman as
a human being (re Oct. 20's
Daily), not the undifferentiating
paranoic rejection of the busi
nessman that Mr. Stewart im
plies.
Hass's basic point is that
"American business ... is de
humanizing to the people who
engage in it because its object
is not to produce the best kinds
of goods and services for men",
but rather to accrue profit. He
is not pointing to a "conspiracy"
in business, but of an underex
amined set of values that is lag
ging behind the ethical demands
of intelligent men. The nine
teenth-century justification of
of the profit "ethic" has been
so strongly and persistently crit
icized that it is no longer able
(if it ever really was) to be a
sustaining philosophy behind a
reflective man's life work.
And, as Hass's experience
with men in business showed, a
man who cannot believe in the
value of his work usually be
comes quite cynical.
If the whole-page letter (p. 4
Oct. 20 Daily) by Motorola's
Board Chairman Robert Galvin
is significant, businessmen also
are concerned, like Hass, with
the increasing feeling that bus
iness cannotoffer "the opportun
ity for the personal satisfaction
that comes from humanitarian
service." (Galvin)
For, to further quote, Galvin,
"(business and humanitarian
philosophy) don't understand
each other well enough . . . we
don't communicate enough . . .
I propose we set a specific
course to try to resolve this."
May the Stanford Business
School recognize Hass's con
cern as concern, and do the
same. MARY HANSON
• Review
Editor, The Daily:
I doubt that any intelligent
reader took seriously Bruce
Merry's review of TWENTY
YEARS OF STANFORD
SHORT STORIES in the Oc
tober 19th Daily; even if he had
not expressed contempt for com
petence, the incompetence of his
prose would have conveyed the
idea. And what critical dicta!
Stories about "pregnancy and
child raising" are automatically
bad, and stories which do not
deal with those subjects are
automatically at least partly
good. A book of short stories
should contain "jokes." The "dis
tinguishing mark of the great
writer" is that he gives us a
character outside his own sex
or generation.
Not only does Mr. Merry

confuse two things about which
he obviously knows little, life
and art, and miss the point of
virtually every story he dis
cusses, but he also treats the
stories as if he were the pro
fessor (which if he is, God help
us) and they "student" stories.
It would seem only fair to have
mentioned that most of these
stories have been published in
highly respectable places, sev
eral in the New Yorker and in
Harper's, for instance.
The book is a splendid one.
It will stand up with any book
of short stories you want to con
sider. The failure of Stanford
to recognize what has been done
on its own campus, although
printed and bound and awaiting
intelligent discovery, and what
is still going on there, is typical
enough, but hardly encouraging.
When I was at Stanford, the re
views were bad generally for the
same reasons as are the re
views in your October 19th is
sue. Won't some editor please in
struct reviewers to write not of
arrogance, but out of a richly
deserved humility?

• Smooth Sailing
Editor, The Daily:
My knowledge of sailing is
limited and I am trying to
learn more about this sport.
Fortunately the Stanford Sail
ing Association seems to be run
by some of the most competent
sailors one can find. Their rac
ing record would confirm this,
to say nothing of the high re
gard that exists elsewhere to
wards the association.
I attended the general meet
ing on October 12 to become
better acquainted with the sail
ors. The election of officers was
run smoothy and with the same
competence that always seems
to be present within the asso
ciation. After this the discussion
went to the two new 30-foot
boats that were donated and to
the racing possibilities they
provide, and thereafter, to how
the sailing team had done, was
doing and was expected to do in
the future.
It seems a pity that all the
quality and excellence within
the association is not more read
ily distributed to those of us
who are desperately trying to
find which end of the boat comes
first. I feel certain that at least
four out of every five members
are not as fortunate as those
who run the club in their sail
ing abilities, and should not the
association be oriented more to
those of us who need to learn?

ANN LAPIDES
Editor, The Daily:
Lost my comments to The
Daily, quoted in Monday's issue,

state that, alas, I have been
misquoted. What I stated to
The Daily reporter who spoke
to me over the phone was that
the case had been referred to

fact, existed, or that I had de
cided that it existed. "Treated as
such" referred to the type of
issue before the council and not
the council's decision.
With regard to my use of the
word "prosecution" I would like
to point out (without reference
to latin sources) that the word

• Challenge
Editor, The Daily:
It seems to me that as much
prejudice exists against fratern
ities as it is alleged exists within
them. Diane Middlebrook's let
ter is a glaring example of it.
Apparently her ideas of what
fraternities are like come from
such sources as The Daily edi
torial page rather than through
any direct contact with them.
Witness her description of the
Delt house as "a group whose
membership is selective .along
lines of racial and religious pre
judice". This exemplifies how
little she actually knows about
the Delts.
I think this is true of many
people who are always critical
of the fraternity system. They
often simply don't know what
a fraternity is, or see it only
from an external view. This ex
ternal view of fraternities
stereotypes them as houses
within which groups of guys
live, and which throw parties
every week-end. These people
seem to overlook the fact that
a fraternity is more than the
house that contains it. A fra
ternity is an organic body, com
posed of the people who form its
membership. The fraternity of
fers, then, more than simply a
place to live, it offers people. It
offers people who, due to a mu
tually selective process, are gen
erally enjoyable to live with,
and it provides fertile grounds
on which many meaningful and
close relationships grow.
Dave Harris is certainly a
challenge to the fraternity sys
tem, but he needn't be seen as
a necessarily destructive force
in this sense. For Dave is chal
lenging the fraternities to prove
that they serve a useful and con
structive purpose in the overall
education of the Stanford stu
dent. Dave has extended this
challenge to all living groups,
yet few have responded to it.
The dormitories and eating
clubs are no less guilty on this
count than are the fraternities.
It is significant that one living
group, a fraternity, Beta Chi,
has endeavored to meet this
challenge. Other houses, too, are

doing some serious thinking
about their place within the uni
versity and are initiating posi
tive programs, though these
may be internal changes, and
thus not subject to the wide
spread publicity Beta Chi re
ceived.
Certainly recent incidents
have put the fraternities in a
bad light. That these actions by
members of certain houses were
deplorable is undeniable. How
ever, it must be recognized that
each fraternity on campus is
composed of different people,
and that each house has a dif
ferent character, some being so
diverse as to defy characteriza
tion. To hold the Greeks as a
whole responsible for the action
of groups within particular
houses shows a lack of under
standing and a narrow-minded
ness that often characterizes
those who so strongly oppose
Stanford's fraternity system.

• Sneer Leaders
Editor, The Dally:
I would like to comment on
the disgraceful way in which
the student body supports its
teams. Having been to both
home games this year, I see
little display of maturity in
in which a student can take
pride. I am referring to the
manner, if it merits being called
a manner, by which we cheer
our football team on to victory.
Granted that we may not have
the best football squad on the
coast, still we do nothing what
ever to support what is, never
theless, our team. I have yet to
hear an enthusiastic cheer ema
nate from the student section.
Surely more spirit is shown
each game by the youngsters
from the Palo Alto area.
Having a losing team is no
disgrace for a university with
as much prestige and respect as
Stanford. But to idly sit by as
though one is ashamed to identi
fy with one's team is a disgrace
indeed. I wonder how the team
feels out there on the field alone.
Our yell leaders are at present
more interested in finding little
obscene cheers, or cheers with

structive purpose in the overall
education of the Stanford stu
dent. Dave has extended this
challenge to all living groups,
yet few have responded to it.
The dormitories and eating
clubs are no less guilty on this
count than are the fraternities.
It is significant that one living
group, a fraternity, Beta Chi,
has endeavored to meet this
challenge. Other houses, too, are

doing some serious thinking
about their place within the uni
versity and are initiating posi
tive programs, though these
may be internal changes, and
thus not subject to the wide

Certainly recent incidents
have put the fraternities in a
bad light. That these actions by
members of certain houses were
deplorable is undeniable. How
ever, it must be recognized that
each fraternity on campus is
composed of different people,
and that each house has a dif
ferent character, some being so
diverse as to defy characteriza
tion. To hold the Greeks as a
whole responsible for the action
of groups within particular
houses shows a lack of under
standing and a narrow-minded
ness that often characterizes
those who so strongly oppose
Stanford's fraternity system.

• Sneer Leaders
Editor, The Dally:
I would like to comment on
the disgraceful way in which
the student body supports its
teams. Having been to both
home games this year, I see
little display of maturity in
in which a student can take
pride. I am referring to the
manner, if it merits being called
a manner, by which we cheer
our football team on to victory.
Granted that we may not have
the best football squad on the
coast, still we do nothing what
ever to support what is, never
theless, our team. I have yet to
hear an enthusiastic cheer ema
nate from the student section.
Surely more spirit is shown
each game by the youngsters
from the Palo Alto area.
Having a losing team is no
disgrace for a university with
as much prestige and respect as
Stanford. But to idly sit by as
though one is ashamed to identi
fy with one's team is a disgrace
indeed. I wonder how the team
feels out there on the field alone.
Our yell leaders are at present
more interested in finding little
obscene cheers, or cheers with
clever little double meanings
than they are in putting forth
an honest and enthusiastic sup
porting yell. Many of the stu
dents would welcome the oppor
tunity to give out with their
lungs if they were ever lead ab
ly. As it stands now, the yell
leaders direct a small part of
the students in their lousy am
biguous "cheers" while the rest
of the students sit by and
sneer or chuckle at its salty im
plications.
Students should take the initi
ative, if the leaders won't, and
start their own cheers; clean,
honest, and loud. I'm sure it
wouldn't matter if we walked
off the field victorious or not, as
long as we really gave all we
had to our squad's efforts. And
we would have the respect of
our opponents as well as our
selves. CARY DICTOR
• Business Concern
Editor, The Dally:
Mr. Stewart's denunciation of
Mr. Hass's evaluation of the

Stanford Business School is a
distortion both of Hofstadter's
ideas and of Hass's observa
tions.
According to Stewart, Hass is
"Paranoic .... seeing the in
stitution of American business
as near conspiratorial in its big
ness . . . badness ... etc."
Actually, Hass has shown in his
letters an empathy with and a
concern for the businessman as
a human being (re Oct. 20's
Daily), not the undifferentiating
paranoic rejection of the busi
nessman that Mr. Stewart im
plies.
Hass's basic point is that
"American business ... is de
humanizing to the people who
engage in it because its object
is not to produce the best kinds
of goods and services for men",
but rather to accrue profit. He
is not pointing to a "conspiracy"
in business, but of an underex
amined set of values that is lag
ging behind the ethical demands
of intelligent men. The nine
teenth-century justification of
of the profit "ethic" has been
so strongly and persistently crit
icized that it is no longer able
(if it ever really was) to be a
sustaining philosophy behind a
reflective man's life work.
And, as Hass's experience
with men in business showed, a
man who cannot believe in the
value of his work usually be
comes quite cynical.
If the whole-page letter (p. 4
Oct. 20 Daily) by Motorola's
Board Chairman Robert Galvin
is significant, businessmen also
are concerned, like Hass, with
the increasing feeling that bus
iness cannotoffer "the opportun
ity for the personal satisfaction
that comes from humanitarian
service." (Galvin)
For, to further quote, Galvin,
"(business and humanitarian
philosophy) don't understand
each other well enough . . . we
don't communicate enough . . .
I propose we set a specific
course to try to resolve this."
May the Stanford Business
School recognize Hass's con
cern as concern, and do the
same. MARY HANSON
• Review
Editor, The Daily:
I doubt that any intelligent
reader took seriously Bruce
Merry's review of TWENTY
YEARS OF STANFORD
SHORT STORIES in the Oc
tober 19th Daily; even if he had
not expressed contempt for com
petence, the incompetence of his
prose would have conveyed the
idea. And what critical dicta!
Stories about "pregnancy and
child raising" are automatically
bad, and stories which do not
deal with those subjects are
automatically at least partly
good. A book of short stories
should contain "jokes." The "dis
tinguishing mark of the great
writer" is that he gives us a
character outside his own sex
or generation.
Not only does Mr. Merry

confuse two things about which
he obviously knows little, life
and art, and miss the point of
virtually every story he dis
cusses, but he also treats the
stories as if he were the pro
fessor (which if he is, God help
us) and they "student" stories.
It would seem only fair to have
mentioned that most of these
stories have been published in
highly respectable places, sev
eral in the New Yorker and in
Harper's, for instance.
The book is a splendid one.
It will stand up with any book
of short stories you want to con
sider. The failure of Stanford
to recognize what has been done
on its own campus, although
printed and bound and awaiting
intelligent discovery, and what
is still going on there, is typical
enough, but hardly encouraging.
When I was at Stanford, the re
views were bad generally for the
same reasons as are the re
views in your October 19th is
sue. Won't some editor please in
struct reviewers to write not of
arrogance, but out of a richly
deserved humility?

• Smooth Sailing
Editor, The Daily:
My knowledge of sailing is
limited and I am trying to
learn more about this sport.
Fortunately the Stanford Sail
ing Association seems to be run
by some of the most competent
sailors one can find. Their rac
ing record would confirm this,
to say nothing of the high re
gard that exists elsewhere to
wards the association.
I attended the general meet
ing on October 12 to become
better acquainted with the sail
ors. The election of officers was
run smoothy and with the same
competence that always seems
to be present within the asso
ciation. After this the discussion
went to the two new 30-foot
boats that were donated and to
the racing possibilities they
provide, and thereafter, to how
the sailing team had done, was
doing and was expected to do in
the future.
It seems a pity that all the
quality and excellence within
the association is not more read
ily distributed to those of us
who are desperately trying to
find which end of the boat comes
first. I feel certain that at least
four out of every five members
are not as fortunate as those
who run the club in their sail
ing abilities, and should not the
association be oriented more to
those of us who need to learn?

ANN LAPIDES
Editor, The Daily:
Lost my comments to The
Daily, quoted in Monday's issue,
stir more comment, I wish to
state that, alas, I have been
misquoted. What I stated to
The Daily reporter who spoke
to me over the phone was that
the case had been referred to
the council as a violation of the
Fundamental Standard and that
the case would be treated as
such. I did not state that it was
obvious that such a violation, in
fact, existed, or that I had de
cided that it existed. "Treated as
such" referred to the type of
issue before the council and not
the council's decision.
With regard to my use of the
word "prosecution" I would like
to point out (without reference
to latin sources) that the word
indicates a further judicial ac
tion (to prosecute an appeal)
and not a puntive decision. I
can only feel that Mr. Garner is

• Challenge
Editor, The Daily:
It seems to me that as much
prejudice exists against fratern
ities as it is alleged exists within
them. Diane Middlebrook's let
ter is a glaring example of it.
Apparently her ideas of what
fraternities are like come from
such sources as The Daily edi
torial page rather than through
any direct contact with them.
Witness her description of the
Delt house as "a group whose
membership is selective .along
lines of racial and religious pre
judice". This exemplifies how
little she actually knows about
the Delts.
I think this is true of many
people who are always critical
of the fraternity system. They
often simply don't know what
a fraternity is, or see it only
from an external view. This ex
ternal view of fraternities
stereotypes them as houses
within which groups of guys
live, and which throw parties
every week-end. These people
seem to overlook the fact that
a fraternity is more than the
house that contains it. A fra
ternity is an organic body, com
posed of the people who form its
membership. The fraternity of
fers, then, more than simply a
place to live, it offers people. It
offers people who, due to a mu
tually selective process, are gen
erally enjoyable to live with,
and it provides fertile grounds
on which many meaningful and
close relationships grow.
Dave Harris is certainly a
challenge to the fraternity sys
tem, but he needn't be seen as
a necessarily destructive force
in this sense. For Dave is chal
lenging the fraternities to prove
that they serve a useful and con
structive purpose in the overall
education of the Stanford stu
dent. Dave has extended this
challenge to all living groups,
yet few have responded to it.
The dormitories and eating
clubs are no less guilty on this

fact, existed, or that I had de
cided that it existed. "Treated as
such" referred to the type of
issue before the council and not
the council's decision.
With regard to my use of the
word "prosecution" I would like
to point out (without reference
to latin sources) that the word
indicates a further judicial ac
tion (to prosecute an appeal)
and not a puntive decision. I
can only feel that Mr. Garner is
confused as to the difference
between persecution and prose
cution. MARTIN GERRY
• Challenge
Editor, The Daily:
It seems to me that as much
prejudice exists against fratern
ities as it is alleged exists within
them. Diane Middlebrook's let
ter is a glaring example of it.
Apparently her ideas of what
fraternities are like come from
such sources as The Daily edi
torial page rather than through
any direct contact with them.
Witness her description of the
Delt house as "a group whose
membership is selective .along
lines of racial and religious pre
judice". This exemplifies how
little she actually knows about
the Delts.
I think this is true of many
people who are always critical
of the fraternity system. They
often simply don't know what
a fraternity is, or see it only
from an external view. This ex
ternal view of fraternities
stereotypes them as houses
within which groups of guys
live, and which throw parties
every week-end. These people
seem to overlook the fact that
a fraternity is more than the
house that contains it. A fra
ternity is an organic body, com
posed of the people who form its
membership. The fraternity of
fers, then, more than simply a
place to live, it offers people. It
offers people who, due to a mu
tually selective process, are gen
erally enjoyable to live with,
and it provides fertile grounds
on which many meaningful and
close relationships grow.
Dave Harris is certainly a
challenge to the fraternity sys
tem, but he needn't be seen as
a necessarily destructive force
in this sense. For Dave is chal
lenging the fraternities to prove
that they serve a useful and con
structive purpose in the overall
education of the Stanford stu
dent. Dave has extended this
challenge to all living groups,
yet few have responded to it.
The dormitories and eating
clubs are no less guilty on this
count than are the fraternities.
It is significant that one living
group, a fraternity, Beta Chi,
has endeavored to meet this
challenge. Other houses, too, are

doing some serious thinking
about their place within the uni
versity and are initiating posi
tive programs, though these
may be internal changes, and
thus not subject to the wide
spread publicity Beta Chi re
ceived.
Certainly recent incidents
have put the fraternities in a
bad light. That these actions by
members of certain houses were
deplorable is undeniable. How
ever, it must be recognized that
each fraternity on campus is
composed of different people,
and that each house has a dif
ferent character, some being so
diverse as to defy characteriza
tion. To hold the Greeks as a
whole responsible for the action
of groups within particular
houses shows a lack of under
standing and a narrow-minded
ness that often characterizes
those who so strongly oppose
Stanford's fraternity system.

• Sneer Leaders
Editor, The Dally:
I would like to comment on
the disgraceful way in which
the student body supports its
teams. Having been to both
home games this year, I see
little display of maturity in
in which a student can take
pride. I am referring to the
manner, if it merits being called
a manner, by which we cheer
our football team on to victory.
Granted that we may not have
the best football squad on the
coast, still we do nothing what
ever to support what is, never
theless, our team. I have yet to
hear an enthusiastic cheer ema
nate from the student section.
Surely more spirit is shown
each game by the youngsters
from the Palo Alto area.
Having a losing team is no
disgrace for a university with
as much prestige and respect as
Stanford. But to idly sit by as
though one is ashamed to identi
fy with one's team is a disgrace
indeed. I wonder how the team
feels out there on the field alone.
Our yell leaders are at present
more interested in finding little
obscene cheers, or cheers with
clever little double meanings
than they are in putting forth
an honest and enthusiastic sup
porting yell. Many of the stu
dents would welcome the oppor
tunity to give out with their
lungs if they were ever lead ab
ly. As it stands now, the yell
leaders direct a small part of
the students in their lousy am
biguous "cheers" while the rest
of the students sit by and
sneer or chuckle at its salty im
plications.
Students should take the initi
ative, if the leaders won't, and
start their own cheers; clean,
honest, and loud. I'm sure it
wouldn't matter if we walked
off the field victorious or not, as
long as we really gave all we
had to our squad's efforts. And
we would have the respect of
our opponents as well as our
selves. CARY DICTOR
• Business Concern
Editor, The Dally:
Mr. Stewart's denunciation of
Mr. Hass's evaluation of the

Stanford Business School is a
distortion both of Hofstadter's
ideas and of Hass's observa
tions.
According to Stewart, Hass is
"Paranoic .... seeing the in
stitution of American business
as near conspiratorial in its big
ness . . . badness ... etc."
Actually, Hass has shown in his
letters an empathy with and a
concern for the businessman as
a human being (re Oct. 20's
Daily), not the undifferentiating
paranoic rejection of the busi
nessman that Mr. Stewart im
plies.
Hass's basic point is that
"American business ... is de
humanizing to the people who
engage in it because its object
is not to produce the best kinds
of goods and services for men",
but rather to accrue profit. He
is not pointing to a "conspiracy"
in business, but of an underex
amined set of values that is lag
ging behind the ethical demands
of intelligent men. The nine
teenth-century justification of
of the profit "ethic" has been
so strongly and persistently crit
icized that it is no longer able
(if it ever really was) to be a
sustaining philosophy behind a
reflective man's life work.
And, as Hass's experience
with men in business showed, a
man who cannot believe in the
value of his work usually be
comes quite cynical.
If the whole-page letter (p. 4
Oct. 20 Daily) by Motorola's
Board Chairman Robert Galvin
is significant, businessmen also
are concerned, like Hass, with
the increasing feeling that bus
iness cannotoffer "the opportun
ity for the personal satisfaction
that comes from humanitarian
service." (Galvin)
For, to further quote, Galvin,
"(business and humanitarian
philosophy) don't understand
each other well enough . . . we
don't communicate enough . . .
I propose we set a specific
course to try to resolve this."
May the Stanford Business
School recognize Hass's con
cern as concern, and do the
same. MARY HANSON
• Review
Editor, The Daily:
I doubt that any intelligent
reader took seriously Bruce
Merry's review of TWENTY
YEARS OF STANFORD
SHORT STORIES in the Oc
tober 19th Daily; even if he had
not expressed contempt for com
petence, the incompetence of his
prose would have conveyed the
idea. And what critical dicta!
Stories about "pregnancy and
child raising" are automatically
bad, and stories which do not
deal with those subjects are
automatically at least partly
good. A book of short stories
should contain "jokes." The "dis
tinguishing mark of the great
writer" is that he gives us a
character outside his own sex
or generation.
Not only does Mr. Merry

confuse two things about which
he obviously knows little, life
and art, and miss the point of
virtually every story he dis
cusses, but he also treats the
stories as if he were the pro
fessor (which if he is, God help
us) and they "student" stories.
It would seem only fair to have
mentioned that most of these
stories have been published in
highly respectable places, sev
eral in the New Yorker and in
Harper's, for instance.
The book is a splendid one.
It will stand up with any book
of short stories you want to con
sider. The failure of Stanford
to recognize what has been done
on its own campus, although
printed and bound and awaiting
intelligent discovery, and what
is still going on there, is typical
enough, but hardly encouraging.
When I was at Stanford, the re
views were bad generally for the
same reasons as are the re
views in your October 19th is
sue. Won't some editor please in
struct reviewers to write not of
arrogance, but out of a richly
deserved humility?

• Smooth Sailing
Editor, The Daily:
My knowledge of sailing is
limited and I am trying to
learn more about this sport.
Fortunately the Stanford Sail
ing Association seems to be run
by some of the most competent
sailors one can find. Their rac
ing record would confirm this,
to say nothing of the high re
gard that exists elsewhere to
wards the association.
I attended the general meet
ing on October 12 to become
better acquainted with the sail
ors. The election of officers was
run smoothy and with the same
competence that always seems
to be present within the asso
ciation. After this the discussion
went to the two new 30-foot
boats that were donated and to
the racing possibilities they
provide, and thereafter, to how
the sailing team had done, was
doing and was expected to do in
the future.
It seems a pity that all the
quality and excellence within
the association is not more read
ily distributed to those of us
who are desperately trying to
find which end of the boat comes
first. I feel certain that at least
four out of every five members
are not as fortunate as those
who run the club in their sail
ing abilities, and should not the
association be oriented more to
those of us who need to learn?

Lost my comments to The
Daily, quoted in Monday's issue,

state that, alas, I have been
misquoted. What I stated to
The Daily reporter who spoke
to me over the phone was that
the case had been referred to
the council as a violation of the
Fundamental Standard and that
the case would be treated as
such. I did not state that it was

fact, existed, or that I had de
