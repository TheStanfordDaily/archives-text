## Latent Symbolism Of Economic Verse 
### Bob Fishman 
After enduring scattered guer
rilla attacks from English de
partments throughout the land,
the business community has
finally struck back.
A conspiracy of tycoons and
advertising men are seeking to
beat the professors and grad
students at their own game—
literary criticism.
In the New York Times of Oc
tober 10, Business Week mag
azine took a full-page ad to re

print a well-known selection
from John Donne's meditations,
the one that begins "No man is
an island, entire of itself; every
man is a piece of the continent,
a part of the main . .
Business Sermon
As if this were not scandalous
enough, the ad also provided a
short critique of the passage:
"Now read it again—as a busi
ness sermon.
"John Donne's beautiful words,
published in 1624,, can apply to
business today.
"No business is an island.
Every enterprise is a piece of
the continent, a part of the
main. What happens to Steel
happens to Autos. What affects
Autos can affect Aerospace. De
cisions in Electronics can change
decisions in Retailing. The suc
cess, progress and profit of any
business is inextricably involved
with all others.
"For that reason, there had
to be a general magazine of
business."
Unfortunately, the authors of
this critique failed to analyze the
most quoted lines in the pas
sage: . . never send to know
for whom the bell tolls; it tolls
for thee."
It seems clear to me, however,
that Donne was attacking com
petitive business practices. A
corporation that bankrupts its
competitor is itself diminished.
After three hundred years of
faulty interpretation, the busi
community has finally shown
us what Donne was really say
ing!!!
Pollution
This new technique, moreover,
can be applied to many other
great works. Take T. S. Eliot's
The Wasteland.
Academic critics have lead us
to believe that the poem dealt
with the sterility of modern life.
We can now see that its real
subject is air pollution and the
inadequacies of urban transpor
tation.
"Unreal City, Under the brown
fog of a winter dawn, A crowd
followed over London Bridge,
so many, I had not though death
had undone so many."
This is certainly one of the
greatest protests in literature
against the "brown fog" of air
pollution. The reference to death
shows that Eliot clearly realized
the health menace that air pollu
tion poses.
The poem continues: "Sighs,
short and infrequent, were ex
haled, And each man fixed his
eyes before his feet."
Here the poet is pointing out
the pain that results from an
inadequate urban transportation
system. Unfortunately, Eil o t
fails to indicate whether a bus
or subway system would best
solve this pressing problem.
Clearly, then, this technique
could open up new frontiers in
English criticism.
Let it never be said, there
fore, that the business commu
nity has not gained wisdom from
English literature, nor that En
glish departments cannot learn
from their colleagues in busi
ness.

literary criticism.
In the New York Times of Oc
tober 10, Business Week mag
azine took a full-page ad to re

print a well-known selection
from John Donne's meditations,
the one that begins "No man is
an island, entire of itself; every
man is a piece of the continent,
a part of the main . .
Business Sermon
As if this were not scandalous
enough, the ad also provided a
short critique of the passage:
"Now read it again—as a busi
ness sermon.
"John Donne's beautiful words,
published in 1624,, can apply to
business today.
"No business is an island.
Every enterprise is a piece of
the continent, a part of the
main. What happens to Steel
happens to Autos. What affects
Autos can affect Aerospace. De
cisions in Electronics can change
decisions in Retailing. The suc
cess, progress and profit of any
business is inextricably involved
with all others.
"For that reason, there had
to be a general magazine of
business."
Unfortunately, the authors of
this critique failed to analyze the
most quoted lines in the pas
sage: . . never send to know
for whom the bell tolls; it tolls
for thee."
It seems clear to me, however,
that Donne was attacking com
petitive business practices. A
corporation that bankrupts its
competitor is itself diminished.
After three hundred years of
faulty interpretation, the busi
community has finally shown
us what Donne was really say
ing!!!
Pollution
This new technique, moreover,
can be applied to many other
great works. Take T. S. Eliot's
The Wasteland.
Academic critics have lead us
to believe that the poem dealt
with the sterility of modern life.
We can now see that its real
subject is air pollution and the
inadequacies of urban transpor
tation.
"Unreal City, Under the brown
fog of a winter dawn, A crowd
followed over London Bridge,
so many, I had not though death
had undone so many."
This is certainly one of the
greatest protests in literature
against the "brown fog" of air
pollution. The reference to death
shows that Eliot clearly realized
the health menace that air pollu
tion poses.
The poem continues: "Sighs,
short and infrequent, were ex
haled, And each man fixed his
eyes before his feet."
Here the poet is pointing out
the pain that results from an
inadequate urban transportation
system. Unfortunately, Eil o t
fails to indicate whether a bus
or subway system would best
solve this pressing problem.
Clearly, then, this technique
could open up new frontiers in
English criticism.
Let it never be said, there
fore, that the business commu
nity has not gained wisdom from
English literature, nor that En
glish departments cannot learn
from their colleagues in busi
ness.
After enduring scattered guer
rilla attacks from English de
partments throughout the land,
the business community has
finally struck back.
A conspiracy of tycoons and
advertising men are seeking to
beat the professors and grad
students at their own game—
