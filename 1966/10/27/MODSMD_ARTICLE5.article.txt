### LONNIE TRAY 
Stanford's Summer Festival will be
able to present a 1967 season thanks
to two recently received grants total
ing $50,000. The Festival, now plan
ning its fourth season, received a
$25,000 grant from an anonymous
donor at last Thursday's Board of
Trustees meeting.
An equal amount was donated by
the San Francisco Foundation, a pri
vate Bay Area philanthropic organi
zation.
The fate of the festivals had been
uncertain since the close of the 1966
season. Originally funded by an
anonymous gift of $100,000 in 1963,
the festivals incurred heavy financial

lasses in 1965 and 1966 which ex
hausted all funds.
Discontinuing Festival
University officials were seriously
considering discontinuing the Festival
because of an exceptionally tight bud
get situation and high priority needs
in academic departments.
The 1967 Festival, according to Tom
Bachetti, the Assistant Festival Man
ager, will be "one of the first major
festivals to concentrate on American
contributions to the arts."
While no contracts have been signed
for this summer's production it is ex
pected to include ballet, drama, and
music. Steve Baffrey, Festival Man
ager, is currently in Europe and will

negotiate contracts when he returns
to the United States.
New York Company
Under consideration for the Festi
val is the Robert Joeffrey Ballet Com
pany from New York. Drama may be
represented by the Association of Pro
ducing Artists, one of the nation's
leading repertory troupes.
Also under consideration is the in
clusion of a group to represent "jazz,
the indigenous American music
form", Bachetti said. He also indicated
that the Festival might include a con
cert of the American march master,
John Phillip Sousa.
"Another possibility is something
comparable to what we did in the

'65 Festival—an evening of diversion
ment on White Memorial Plaza." Ba
chetti explained this would be an in
formal evening with bands, strolling
singing and acting _groups.

Previous Festivals have introduced
to the Bay Area—and often to the
United States, the Stuttgart Chamber
Orchestra, the Orchestra de la Suisse
Romande, and the American Conserv
atory Theatre.
After appearing to capacity audi
ences at the Festival, the American
Conservatory Theatre was persuaded
to settle permanently in San Fran
cisco. Its repertoire at Stanford fea
tured "late" shows in the contempor
ary theater, inspired by the success
of similar ventures at the Edinburgh
Festival.
The celebrated Amadaeus Quartet,
a highlight of the 1965 Mozart Era is
slated to make a return concert ap
pearance in February.
Emphasizing the Arts in America,
festival officials hope to attract Ameri
can talent new to the Bay Area.

season. Originally funded by an
anonymous gift of $100,000 in 1963,
the festivals incurred heavy financial

lasses in 1965 and 1966 which ex
hausted all funds.
Discontinuing Festival
University officials were seriously
considering discontinuing the Festival
because of an exceptionally tight bud
get situation and high priority needs
in academic departments.
The 1967 Festival, according to Tom
Bachetti, the Assistant Festival Man
ager, will be "one of the first major
festivals to concentrate on American
contributions to the arts."
While no contracts have been signed
for this summer's production it is ex
pected to include ballet, drama, and
music. Steve Baffrey, Festival Man
ager, is currently in Europe and will

negotiate contracts when he returns
to the United States.
New York Company
Under consideration for the Festi
val is the Robert Joeffrey Ballet Com
pany from New York. Drama may be
represented by the Association of Pro
ducing Artists, one of the nation's
leading repertory troupes.
Also under consideration is the in
clusion of a group to represent "jazz,
the indigenous American music
form", Bachetti said. He also indicated
that the Festival might include a con
cert of the American march master,
John Phillip Sousa.
"Another possibility is something
comparable to what we did in the

'65 Festival—an evening of diversion
ment on White Memorial Plaza." Ba
chetti explained this would be an in
formal evening with bands, strolling
singing and acting _groups.
Not As Exteasive
Previous Festivals have introduced
to the Bay Area—and often to the
United States, the Stuttgart Chamber
Orchestra, the Orchestra de la Suisse
Romande, and the American Conserv
atory Theatre.
After appearing to capacity audi
ences at the Festival, the American
Conservatory Theatre was persuaded
to settle permanently in San Fran
cisco. Its repertoire at Stanford fea
tured "late" shows in the contempor
ary theater, inspired by the success
of similar ventures at the Edinburgh
Festival.
The celebrated Amadaeus Quartet,
a highlight of the 1965 Mozart Era is
slated to make a return concert ap
pearance in February.
Emphasizing the Arts in America,
festival officials hope to attract Ameri
can talent new to the Bay Area.
Stanford's Summer Festival will be
able to present a 1967 season thanks
to two recently received grants total

donor at last Thursday's Board of
Trustees meeting.
An equal amount was donated by
the San Francisco Foundation, a pri
