# Lifetime Leave-of-Absence
## Canada Offers Haven From Draft 
### ROGER RAPOPORT The Collegiate Press Service 
This month 49,200 men will be
inducted into the U.S. armed forces.
Expatriate Bob Thomas will not be
among them.
It's not that Bob isn't eligible—he's
been 1-A for the past five months.
Rather, he has left his native In
diana to live here in Canada where
U.S. draft laws do not apply.
Bob (not his real name) is one of
a growing number of Americans
emigrating to Canada to escape the
draft. An estimated 2,000 U.S. citizens
have moved to Canada in the past
two years for the same reason. About
400 to 500 have settled in this modern
Ontario provincial capital of nearly 2
million.
Bob, a soft-spoken 22-year-old, intro
duces himself as "your friendly
neighborhood draft dodger" to pre
serve anonymity.
A cum laude English graduate of a
top Ivy League school last June, he
returned home to find 1-A greetings
from his local draft board.
Bob had no intention of following
in the footsteps of his 18-year-old
brother who joined the Air Force in
April ("My brother and I gave up dis
cussing Vietnam; it's useless.")
He carefully weighed the alterna
tive methods of avoiding the draft. To
begin with, Bob is not a pacifist or
conscientious objector. "Besides," he
explains, "I wouldn't take C.O. status
because it's demeaning. I have no in

tention of cooperating with the mili
tary system in any way."
The other route was jail—up to five
years and $10,000 for failing to report
for induction. "But that wouldn't do
anyone any good. And I see no reason
to make a martyr of myself."
So he decided the only way out was
North. He told his father who was
dismayed and his mother who "cried
a lot." When he arrived here in June,
Tony Hyde of the Student Union for
Peace Action, a Canadian affiliate of
Students for a Democratic Society,
found him a place to stay. To qualify
for landed immigrant status and le
gally remain in Canada he took a job
at the University of Toronto library.
Bob finds Canada "far more relaxed
and less hysterical" than the U.S.
Canada has no draft.
"Any government that tried to start
the draft again would get thrown out
of office," explains Tony Hyde.
He says his fellow employes un
animously support his reasons for
moving to Canada. In his spare time
ne reads, writes poetry, does water
colors, and generally leads a tranquil
existence.
Except for the fact that he can
never return to the United States
again (where he would face that $10,-
000 fine and five years in jail) his life
is free of restrictions. A long standing
pact between the U.S. and Canadian
governments prohibits his extradition.
"From up here," says Bob, "Ameri
ca really looks like it's going nuts." In

fact he goes so far as to claim that
the United States is "on its way to a
collective nervous breakdown."
An armchair analyst, he gives half
a dozen reasons for projecting a na
tional crackup. "For one thing, the
right-wing militaristic mentality that
got us into Vietnam is going to take
control of the country. Sheer race
hatred will result in constant pre
mediated violence between the races
within three years.
Vietnam is going to get worse, and
in three or four years we will be doing
the same thing someplace else —there
are four or five major candidates. In
flation will rock the economic struc
ture.
"The psychedelic thing has already
won. As Timothy Leary says, too
many people have already tried it and
like it. And the gap between the gen
erations will widen. The old people
won't be able to understand our gen
eration at all."
Bob articulates his dire prophecy
with a great deal of pride and was
somewhat miffed to discover that
Newsweek reduced it all to one sen
tence in a recent article on draft
dodgers. "That reporter just didn't
understand. The Newsweek guy kept
asking me if I would have fought
in World War 11. I probably would
have but it's a totally irrelevant ques
tion. I'm not concerned about history.
I'm just against the American role
in Vietnam."
Bob has high hopes of organizing
his fellow Americans. He is currently

starting an expatriate newsletter. But
there may be some difficulty writing
editorials, for the draft dodgers are
far from a like-minded lot.
According to Tony Hyde, "Bob is
not a typical draft dodger. In fact,
I don't think there is any such thing.
We're finding a lot of political types
but for many people, coming up here
is their first political act. We even had
a right-wing type from Arizona come
up recently. He was sort of a Jeffer
sonian-type Democrat who didn't want
to fight in Vietnam. His parents even
agreed."
Indeed Bob and his draft-dodging
friends disagree strongly on some
matters. For example, one argument
flared in a discussion between Bob
and his fellow expatriate Allen, a po
litical science doctoral candidate at the
University of Tronoto.
"If I were North Vietnamese, I
wouldn't fight for Ho Chi Minh," said
Allan. "I don't think he is a lot better
than General Ky. The whole war is a
meaningless cause on both sides."
But Bob disagrees. "I think if I
was in North Vietnam I might join
up. Ho is far superior to Ky."
Still, Bob contends that his decision
to move to Canada was not political.
"Personal freedom is the reason I
came up here. I want to have the
right to say no to people. I've got
hotter things to do than be used like
a robot-like killer dog in the Army.
No one has the right to tell me to
go drop napalm on people. I want the
right to run my own life."
