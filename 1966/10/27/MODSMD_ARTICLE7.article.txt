# CHALLENGES SKEPTICS
## Rep. States Aims Of Peace Corps 
### GAIL ANDERSON 
In the Peace Corps "any American
can have a unique opportunity to
serve himself and humanity as well,"
said Congressman Charles L. Weltner
in a speech at Cubberley Auditorium
last night.
Speaking as a part of Peace Corps
Week at Stanford, Weltner described
"a concept greater than the Peace
Corps, greater than any government
or any institution. That concept is the
proposition of service."
People often talk about their ob
ligations to society, he noted, but
few do anything about it. The Peace
Corps, he proposed, is a way to do
something about one's philosophical
conclusions —to "take the simplest and
oldest principle—that of serving the
needs of our brethren —and put it
into action."
Skeptics Convinced
Recalling early skepticism about the
Peace Corps and the proven success
that followed, he stated the success
of the program was a result not of

the money spent but of the dedica
tion of people who had this concept
of service and were willing to put it
into action.
Weltner told of his experiences on a
recent junket to Asia as a delegate
to a conference on the Asian De
velopment Bank. "I learned from this
trip," he said, "not from being a
'plenipotentiary,' but from seeing
and trying to understand a new cul
ture."
"I am convinced," he said, "that
the peace that comes through un
derstanding will only be achieved
when the world learns that Americans
care, and that they are willing to give
of themselves for others."
Step Toward Peace
"The Peace Corps," he offered, "is
the way to end war and tumult and
destruction. It is the way in which
men's minds can be expanded more
than would be possible at home. It is
the way that you can be somebody."
The Peace Corps, he concluded, is
an affirmation by which "an Ameri
can concerned with the rights of man
can have something to do with the
duties of man."
In an exclusive interview with The
Daily, Weltner described the Peace
Corps as "a proposition of personal
commitment and the giving of oneself
on behalf of one's principles."
Quit Governor's Race
Weltner recently withdrew his can
didacy for re-election rather than
support segregationist Lester Maddox
for governor of Georgia.
"Segregationist isn't a strong enough
enough term for Maddox," he noted.
"He's more of a paranoid."
It was Weltner who initiated the
House Un-American Activities Com
mittee proceedings against the Ku
Klux Klan. He noted that when the
investigations began in October of last
year, Klan membership was estimated
at fifty thousand. At the end of the
investigation it had dropped to twenty
thousand, but a few months later it
was back up to thirty thousand.
"The Klan can only be kept down
when the heat's on, and that means
legislation," he said, referring to the
proposed law providing for civil in
junction against criminal conspiracy.
Weltner will be at the Peace Corps
booth in White Plaza from 9:30 to
10:30 this morning to speak to stu
dents.
