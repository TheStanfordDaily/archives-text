Out' top people are never old-fashioned about any new
idea, whether it comes lrom middle management or
112 rom our youngest college grad. We have a master plan
and the vitality to make it work. Marketing is way-out
and zeroed right in. Finance knows that we have better
things to do with our money than let it grow barnacles...
shelled out $465 million in capital expenditures
over the last 3 years. In the scientific department, we
combine technical insight with an unusual grasp of
marketing dynamics.
Thinking young explains how we chalked-up one of the
most impressive corporate rebuilding jobs in recent
history, flow we turned what was basically a one-product
business into a solid and diverse international corporation
dealing in chemicals, miracle fibers, plastics, paints,
petroleum and forest products. How we multiplied sales
5 fold in 10 years. How we now have 100 plants in the
U.S., Canada, Latin America, Europe, Africa and Asia.
Possibly we could afford to relax ;rlittle. But success
makes young blood run even faster.
Which means that the ambitious college grad couldn't
find a more provocative opportunity anywhere else in
American industry.
