Chapman College's floating campus.
The note he paused to make as fellow students went ahead to inspect Hatshepsut's Tomb in the
Valley of the Kings near Luxor, he used to complete an assignment for his Comparative World
Cultures professor.

the University of California at Irvine where he continues studies toward a teaching career in life
sciences.
As you read this, 450 other students have begun the fall semester voyage of discovery with
