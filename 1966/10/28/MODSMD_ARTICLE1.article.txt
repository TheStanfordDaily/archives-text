# Canadians Endorse Draft-Dodgers' Rights
## 
### ROGER RAPOPORT The Collegiate Press Service (Last of a two-part series) 
TORONTO—"I've always thought a man
had an obligation to go fight where his coun
try tells him to," says Corporal Ron Mcintosh,
a career soldier with the Canadian Army.
"But it seems to me that the United States
hasn't given its boys much of an explanation
on why they should go to Vietnam. So if they
want to come up here to escape the draft it's
fine with me."
Most oi official Canada views things the same
way. Police, civic, and university administra
tors as -well as the press solidly endorse the
right of U.S. citizens to avert conscription. U.S.
diplomatic and military officials are not visibly
dismayed by the situation either.
"There's no reason to get your blood pres
sure up when you have a few hundred draft
dodgers amidst 30 million draft registrants,"
National Selective Service Director Lt. Gen.
Lewis B. Hershey said.
"You can't have a sawmill without a little
sawdust and these draft-dodgers are just saw
dust. Besides I don't think they are much of
an asset to the United States. I've told my
Canadian friends that they are welcome to
them."
Canada seems happy to oblige. "We don't

even think about it,"says a spokesman for
the city of Toronto in the town's posh new
city hall. "What's the saying? 'What you don't
know doesn't hurt you,' " he says whimsically.
A spokesman for the Royal Canadian Mount
ed Police explains that the draft status of U.S.
immigrants is not a matter of Canadian con
cern.
And the Toronto Globe and Mail wrote in a
recent editorial, "The granting of political
aslyum is an accepted principle in all civilized
countries. Canada cannot, decently breach this
principle."
At the University of Toronto Admissions
Director E. M. Davidson says the draft status
of American applicants is not a factor in ad
mission to the school. "We admit exclusively
on academic and behavioral grounds."
Davidson has noticed no upsurge of appli
cants from American men to the school. In
fact, the number of U.S. male applicants has
fallen off in recent months. "But that's prob
ably because the draft is draining off a lot of
our prospective American students," he ex
plains.
Several Canadian organizations actively as
sist expatriates. The Student Union for Peace
Action with headquarters at 659 Spadina St.
has become the Welcome Wagon for Ameri
can draft dodgers. It helps new arrivals to
settle.

While SUP A leader Tony Hyde is quick to
explain that his organization "makes no move
to get people to come up here," it has pub
lished an informative 15-vent pamphlet called
"Coming to Canada?" for "Americans con
cerned about the possibility of being drafted."
The informative document includes all perti
nent information on such crucial matters as
deportation, customs ,and landed immigrant
status (a prerequisite to Canadian citizenship).
In essence it says that coming to Canada poses
no major problem for the draft dodger who
plans ahead.
Hyde says the pamphlet is "our fastest sell
ing item at present. We get about 50 requests
a week and the number is growing."
But he is quick to point out that the
pamphlet is no moneymaker. "We lose two
cents on every pamphlet since we send them
out airmail at 17 cents. But we want to do it
that way since a lot of our orders come from
urgent cases."
Another organization aiding draft dodgers
is the Fellowship for Reconciliation, a small
Christian pacifist group. The group's Canadian
National secretary, Brewster Kneen, says he
tore his "draft card into fine pieces and mailed
it back to the draft board," after moving here
from Cleveland.
Nicholas Volk, U.S. Vice-Consul in Toronto

says he is not worried about the aid Canadian
groups are giving American draft dodgers.
"It's none of our concern," says Volk. "We
feel it's a matter for the Canadian govern
ment. We are guests here."
Volk says of draft dodging: "Anything like
this naturally encourages the Communists,
but generally I think the problem is over
rated."
Nonetheless American officials have taken
an active interest in special cases. The Royal
Canadian Mounted Police says it receives five
or six inquiries a month from the Federal
Bureau of Investigation seeking to find Ca
nadian citizens who lived or worked in the
U.S. and returned to Canada when they re
ceived their draft notices.
And one draft dodger reports that a woman
who had been actively finding homes for the
new American arrivals was recently visited by
agents from the American Secret Service and
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
When the official questioned the woman
about her settlement activities of the previous
weekend she offered the perfect alibi. The wom
an explained that she had gone to see "Don
Giovanni" at the Stratford, Ontario, drama
festival.
Still, the amount of pressure on the draft
dodgers and their friends is minimal in Can
ada. The U.S. expatriates point out that the

absence of a Canadian draft gives them far
more freedom.
"Everyone thinks that because the United
States is a democracy," says one expatriate,
"that we are obliged to follow all Its laws. But
that's not true. Simply because the draft law
was democratically passed doesn't mean we
should be prohibited from goin against it."
Gen. Hershey disagrees. "Congress never
took notice of political reasons for wanting to
says out of the Army. You couldn't run a
democracy if everyone obeyed the laws he
liked and defied the ones he didn't. Why you
couldn't even run a fraternity unless every
one went along with majority decisions."
. Still Hershey is not dismayed by the spector
of young men leaving the country to avoid the
draft.
"This isn't anything new," he explained.
"There have always been people who've left
their country to avoid conscription. The history
books tell us that many of the mid-19th cen
tury immigrants to the U.S. were leaving
central European countries to escape compul
sory service. And a lot of them became fine
citizens here."
The Selective Service director contends that
American conscription "provides the military
strength to protect Canada and keep it draft
free. As long as you've got a big brother
around, you don't have to learn how to box."

dodgers amidst 30 million draft registrants,"
National Selective Service Director Lt. Gen.
Lewis B. Hershey said.
"You can't have a sawmill without a little
sawdust and these draft-dodgers are just saw
dust. Besides I don't think they are much of
an asset to the United States. I've told my
Canadian friends that they are welcome to
them."
Canada seems happy to oblige. "We don't

even think about it,"says a spokesman for
the city of Toronto in the town's posh new
city hall. "What's the saying? 'What you don't
know doesn't hurt you,' " he says whimsically.
A spokesman for the Royal Canadian Mount
ed Police explains that the draft status of U.S.
immigrants is not a matter of Canadian con
cern.
And the Toronto Globe and Mail wrote in a
recent editorial, "The granting of political
aslyum is an accepted principle in all civilized
countries. Canada cannot, decently breach this
principle."
At the University of Toronto Admissions
Director E. M. Davidson says the draft status
of American applicants is not a factor in ad
mission to the school. "We admit exclusively
on academic and behavioral grounds."
Davidson has noticed no upsurge of appli
cants from American men to the school. In
fact, the number of U.S. male applicants has
fallen off in recent months. "But that's prob
ably because the draft is draining off a lot of
our prospective American students," he ex
plains.
Several Canadian organizations actively as
sist expatriates. The Student Union for Peace
Action with headquarters at 659 Spadina St.
has become the Welcome Wagon for Ameri
can draft dodgers. It helps new arrivals to
settle.

While SUP A leader Tony Hyde is quick to
explain that his organization "makes no move
to get people to come up here," it has pub
lished an informative 15-vent pamphlet called
"Coming to Canada?" for "Americans con
cerned about the possibility of being drafted."
The informative document includes all perti
nent information on such crucial matters as
deportation, customs ,and landed immigrant
status (a prerequisite to Canadian citizenship).
In essence it says that coming to Canada poses
no major problem for the draft dodger who
plans ahead.
Hyde says the pamphlet is "our fastest sell
ing item at present. We get about 50 requests
a week and the number is growing."
But he is quick to point out that the
pamphlet is no moneymaker. "We lose two
cents on every pamphlet since we send them
out airmail at 17 cents. But we want to do it
that way since a lot of our orders come from
urgent cases."
Another organization aiding draft dodgers
is the Fellowship for Reconciliation, a small
Christian pacifist group. The group's Canadian
National secretary, Brewster Kneen, says he
tore his "draft card into fine pieces and mailed
it back to the draft board," after moving here
from Cleveland.
Nicholas Volk, U.S. Vice-Consul in Toronto

says he is not worried about the aid Canadian
groups are giving American draft dodgers.
"It's none of our concern," says Volk. "We
feel it's a matter for the Canadian govern
ment. We are guests here."
Volk says of draft dodging: "Anything like
this naturally encourages the Communists,
but generally I think the problem is over
rated."
Nonetheless American officials have taken
an active interest in special cases. The Royal
Canadian Mounted Police says it receives five
or six inquiries a month from the Federal
Bureau of Investigation seeking to find Ca
nadian citizens who lived or worked in the
U.S. and returned to Canada when they re
ceived their draft notices.
And one draft dodger reports that a woman
who had been actively finding homes for the
new American arrivals was recently visited by
agents from the American Secret Service and
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
When the official questioned the woman
about her settlement activities of the previous
weekend she offered the perfect alibi. The wom
an explained that she had gone to see "Don
Giovanni" at the Stratford, Ontario, drama
festival.
Still, the amount of pressure on the draft
dodgers and their friends is minimal in Can
ada. The U.S. expatriates point out that the

absence of a Canadian draft gives them far
more freedom.
"Everyone thinks that because the United
States is a democracy," says one expatriate,
"that we are obliged to follow all Its laws. But
that's not true. Simply because the draft law
was democratically passed doesn't mean we
should be prohibited from goin against it."
Gen. Hershey disagrees. "Congress never
took notice of political reasons for wanting to
says out of the Army. You couldn't run a
democracy if everyone obeyed the laws he
liked and defied the ones he didn't. Why you
couldn't even run a fraternity unless every
one went along with majority decisions."
. Still Hershey is not dismayed by the spector
of young men leaving the country to avoid the
draft.
"This isn't anything new," he explained.
"There have always been people who've left
their country to avoid conscription. The history
books tell us that many of the mid-19th cen
tury immigrants to the U.S. were leaving
central European countries to escape compul
sory service. And a lot of them became fine
citizens here."
The Selective Service director contends that
American conscription "provides the military
strength to protect Canada and keep it draft
free. As long as you've got a big brother
around, you don't have to learn how to box."
TORONTO—"I've always thought a man
had an obligation to go fight where his coun
try tells him to," says Corporal Ron Mcintosh,
a career soldier with the Canadian Army.
"But it seems to me that the United States
hasn't given its boys much of an explanation
on why they should go to Vietnam. So if they
want to come up here to escape the draft it's
fine with me."
Most oi official Canada views things the same
way. Police, civic, and university administra
tors as -well as the press solidly endorse the
right of U.S. citizens to avert conscription. U.S.
diplomatic and military officials are not visibly
dismayed by the situation either.

At the University of Toronto Admissions
Director E. M. Davidson says the draft status
of American applicants is not a factor in ad
mission to the school. "We admit exclusively
on academic and behavioral grounds."
Davidson has noticed no upsurge of appli
cants from American men to the school. In
fact, the number of U.S. male applicants has
fallen off in recent months. "But that's prob
ably because the draft is draining off a lot of
our prospective American students," he ex
plains.
Several Canadian organizations actively as
sist expatriates. The Student Union for Peace
Action with headquarters at 659 Spadina St.
has become the Welcome Wagon for Ameri
can draft dodgers. It helps new arrivals to
settle.

While SUP A leader Tony Hyde is quick to
explain that his organization "makes no move
to get people to come up here," it has pub
lished an informative 15-vent pamphlet called
"Coming to Canada?" for "Americans con
cerned about the possibility of being drafted."
The informative document includes all perti
nent information on such crucial matters as
deportation, customs ,and landed immigrant
status (a prerequisite to Canadian citizenship).
In essence it says that coming to Canada poses
no major problem for the draft dodger who
plans ahead.
Hyde says the pamphlet is "our fastest sell
ing item at present. We get about 50 requests
a week and the number is growing."
But he is quick to point out that the
pamphlet is no moneymaker. "We lose two
cents on every pamphlet since we send them
out airmail at 17 cents. But we want to do it
that way since a lot of our orders come from
urgent cases."
Another organization aiding draft dodgers
is the Fellowship for Reconciliation, a small
Christian pacifist group. The group's Canadian
National secretary, Brewster Kneen, says he
tore his "draft card into fine pieces and mailed
it back to the draft board," after moving here
from Cleveland.
Nicholas Volk, U.S. Vice-Consul in Toronto

says he is not worried about the aid Canadian
groups are giving American draft dodgers.
"It's none of our concern," says Volk. "We
feel it's a matter for the Canadian govern
ment. We are guests here."
Volk says of draft dodging: "Anything like
this naturally encourages the Communists,
but generally I think the problem is over
rated."
Nonetheless American officials have taken
an active interest in special cases. The Royal
Canadian Mounted Police says it receives five
or six inquiries a month from the Federal
Bureau of Investigation seeking to find Ca
nadian citizens who lived or worked in the
U.S. and returned to Canada when they re
ceived their draft notices.
And one draft dodger reports that a woman
who had been actively finding homes for the
new American arrivals was recently visited by
agents from the American Secret Service and
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
When the official questioned the woman
about her settlement activities of the previous
weekend she offered the perfect alibi. The wom
an explained that she had gone to see "Don
Giovanni" at the Stratford, Ontario, drama
festival.
Still, the amount of pressure on the draft
dodgers and their friends is minimal in Can
ada. The U.S. expatriates point out that the

absence of a Canadian draft gives them far
more freedom.
"Everyone thinks that because the United
States is a democracy," says one expatriate,
"that we are obliged to follow all Its laws. But
that's not true. Simply because the draft law
was democratically passed doesn't mean we
should be prohibited from goin against it."
Gen. Hershey disagrees. "Congress never
took notice of political reasons for wanting to
says out of the Army. You couldn't run a
democracy if everyone obeyed the laws he
liked and defied the ones he didn't. Why you
couldn't even run a fraternity unless every
one went along with majority decisions."
. Still Hershey is not dismayed by the spector
of young men leaving the country to avoid the
draft.
"This isn't anything new," he explained.
"There have always been people who've left
their country to avoid conscription. The history
books tell us that many of the mid-19th cen
tury immigrants to the U.S. were leaving
central European countries to escape compul
sory service. And a lot of them became fine
citizens here."
The Selective Service director contends that
American conscription "provides the military
strength to protect Canada and keep it draft
free. As long as you've got a big brother
around, you don't have to learn how to box."
TORONTO—"I've always thought a man
had an obligation to go fight where his coun
try tells him to," says Corporal Ron Mcintosh,
a career soldier with the Canadian Army.
"But it seems to me that the United States
hasn't given its boys much of an explanation
on why they should go to Vietnam. So if they
want to come up here to escape the draft it's
fine with me."
Most oi official Canada views things the same
way. Police, civic, and university administra
tors as -well as the press solidly endorse the
right of U.S. citizens to avert conscription. U.S.
diplomatic and military officials are not visibly
dismayed by the situation either.
"There's no reason to get your blood pres
sure up when you have a few hundred draft
dodgers amidst 30 million draft registrants,"
National Selective Service Director Lt. Gen.
Lewis B. Hershey said.
"You can't have a sawmill without a little
sawdust and these draft-dodgers are just saw
dust. Besides I don't think they are much of
an asset to the United States. I've told my
Canadian friends that they are welcome to
them."
Canada seems happy to oblige. "We don't

the city of Toronto in the town's posh new
city hall. "What's the saying? 'What you don't

While SUP A leader Tony Hyde is quick to
explain that his organization "makes no move
to get people to come up here," it has pub
lished an informative 15-vent pamphlet called
"Coming to Canada?" for "Americans con
cerned about the possibility of being drafted."
The informative document includes all perti
nent information on such crucial matters as
deportation, customs ,and landed immigrant
status (a prerequisite to Canadian citizenship).
In essence it says that coming to Canada poses
no major problem for the draft dodger who
plans ahead.
Hyde says the pamphlet is "our fastest sell
ing item at present. We get about 50 requests
a week and the number is growing."
But he is quick to point out that the
pamphlet is no moneymaker. "We lose two
cents on every pamphlet since we send them
out airmail at 17 cents. But we want to do it
that way since a lot of our orders come from
urgent cases."
Another organization aiding draft dodgers
is the Fellowship for Reconciliation, a small
Christian pacifist group. The group's Canadian
National secretary, Brewster Kneen, says he
tore his "draft card into fine pieces and mailed
it back to the draft board," after moving here
from Cleveland.
Nicholas Volk, U.S. Vice-Consul in Toronto

says he is not worried about the aid Canadian
groups are giving American draft dodgers.
"It's none of our concern," says Volk. "We
feel it's a matter for the Canadian govern
ment. We are guests here."
Volk says of draft dodging: "Anything like
this naturally encourages the Communists,
but generally I think the problem is over
rated."
Nonetheless American officials have taken
an active interest in special cases. The Royal
Canadian Mounted Police says it receives five
or six inquiries a month from the Federal
Bureau of Investigation seeking to find Ca
nadian citizens who lived or worked in the
U.S. and returned to Canada when they re
ceived their draft notices.
And one draft dodger reports that a woman
who had been actively finding homes for the
new American arrivals was recently visited by
agents from the American Secret Service and
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
When the official questioned the woman
about her settlement activities of the previous
weekend she offered the perfect alibi. The wom
an explained that she had gone to see "Don
Giovanni" at the Stratford, Ontario, drama
festival.
Still, the amount of pressure on the draft
dodgers and their friends is minimal in Can
ada. The U.S. expatriates point out that the

absence of a Canadian draft gives them far
more freedom.
"Everyone thinks that because the United
States is a democracy," says one expatriate,
"that we are obliged to follow all Its laws. But
that's not true. Simply because the draft law
was democratically passed doesn't mean we
should be prohibited from goin against it."
Gen. Hershey disagrees. "Congress never
took notice of political reasons for wanting to
says out of the Army. You couldn't run a
democracy if everyone obeyed the laws he
liked and defied the ones he didn't. Why you
couldn't even run a fraternity unless every
one went along with majority decisions."
. Still Hershey is not dismayed by the spector
of young men leaving the country to avoid the
draft.
"This isn't anything new," he explained.
"There have always been people who've left
their country to avoid conscription. The history
books tell us that many of the mid-19th cen
tury immigrants to the U.S. were leaving
central European countries to escape compul
sory service. And a lot of them became fine
citizens here."
The Selective Service director contends that
American conscription "provides the military
strength to protect Canada and keep it draft
free. As long as you've got a big brother
around, you don't have to learn how to box."
