Will Stanford students be im
mortalized in the deathless prose
of Lynda Bird Johnson?
Herb Caen in the San Fran
cisco Chronicle yesterday re
ported that Miss Johnson was
to compare Stanford and Cal
students as her first assignment
from McCall's Magazine.
Representatives of McCall's in
San Francisco and New York
yesterday cited Caen's state
ments as "totally inaccurate."
McCall's Articles Editor Helen
Markel emphatically denied
such a report when contacted.
A McCall's correspondent in
San Francisco noted later that
she had been told that Lynda
might possibly report on a study
done at Stanford and Cal of
changes during the college
years. She said that this study
was not a comparison.
The Daily was unable to con
firm the story of Lynda's sug
gested flight, but reliable
sources concur that such ru
mors are for the birds.
