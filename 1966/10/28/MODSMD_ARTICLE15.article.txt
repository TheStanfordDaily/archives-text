# LBJ On Thailand Visit: Allies Keep Strong Shield Against Aggression
## News In Brief Compiled From the Associated Press 
### 
BANGKOK, Thailand—ln a challenge to
North Vietnam, President Johnson says the
United States and its allies in South Vietnam
have built a military shield "strong enough
to prevent the aggressor from succeeding."
Until North Vietnam withdraws its forces,
"we must continue to resist the aggression
that threatens South Vietnam," he said in a
report to the American people.
"We do so because we believe that the Com
munists will unbolt the door to peace only
when they are convinced their military cam
paign cannot succeed," he declared.
• U.N. Ends African Mandate
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y.—The U.N. Gen
eral Assembly proclaimed last night the ter
mination of South Africa's mandate over
South-west Africa. It declared that henceforth
the giant territory "is a direct responsibility
of the United Nations."
Culminating a long and bitter debate the 121-
nation Assembly approved by a vote of 141
to 2 with 3 abstentions a resolution setting out
the most drastic U.N. action ever contemplated

in an effort to compel South Africa to give up
its rule over the territory, roughtly, the size
of Texas and New York State combined.
The United States and the Soviet Union
votpd for the resolution, while France and
Britain were among those who abstained.
• China Praises Missile System
TOKYO—Red China claimed yesterday the
development of a missile system to carry nu
clear bombs. It announced a guided missile
with a nuclear warhead, lofted Thursday,
"accurately hit the target at the appointed
distance, effecting a nuclear explosion."
How far the missile traveled was withheld,
but the test recalled a prediction last March
by Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara
that the Chinese within two or three years
would have an atomic strike capability of
500-700 miles.
The blast—the fourth announced by Peking
since 1964—came while President Johnson
was visiting neighboring Thailand. It thus
raised speculation that its timing may have
been designed to take Asian eyes off the

President's trip and the aftermath of the
Manila conference.
As in the previous tests, the Chinese pro
fessed only peaceful intent and said they
looked to the day when all nuclear weapons
would be destroyed.
• Soviets To Visit France

ment announcement said.

here last June.

The visits to France are the first to a
major western nation announced for the So
viet leaders since they took over power from
former Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev in Oc
tober of 1964.

• Hopes Fade For *66 Launch
CAPE KENNEDY, Fla.— A series of techni
cal problems has wiped out America's hopes
of launching a three-man Apollo moonship
into earth orbit this year.
The National Aeronautics and Space Ad
ministration had hoped to achieve a Decem
ber launching of Apollo 1, moving the date up
from the originally planned "first quarter of
1967."
The delay, plus troubles with the Saturn 5
man-to-the-moon rocket, could affect the lunar

to the moon by 1970, with 1968 the present
target.

CAPE KENNEDY, Fla.— A series of techni
cal problems has wiped out America's hopes
of launching a three-man Apollo moonship
into earth orbit this year.
The National Aeronautics and Space Ad
ministration had hoped to achieve a Decem
ber launching of Apollo 1, moving the date up
from the originally planned "first quarter of
1967."
The delay, plus troubles with the Saturn 5
man-to-the-moon rocket, could affect the lunar
landing timetable. The U.S. goal is to send men
to the moon by 1970, with 1968 the present
target.

• Negroes Jailed In Grenada
GRENADA, Miss. — Seventeen youngsters
were arrested here yesterday at another in a
series of marches protesting alleged mistreat
ment of Negro pupils in recently desegregated

subteens, marched to a barricade about a
block from a school and ignored police orders
to disperse.

BANGKOK, Thailand—ln a challenge to
North Vietnam, President Johnson says the
United States and its allies in South Vietnam
have built a military shield "strong enough
to prevent the aggressor from succeeding."
Until North Vietnam withdraws its forces,
"we must continue to resist the aggression
that threatens South Vietnam," he said in a
report to the American people.
"We do so because we believe that the Com
munists will unbolt the door to peace only
when they are convinced their military cam
paign cannot succeed," he declared.
• U.N. Ends African Mandate
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y.—The U.N. Gen
eral Assembly proclaimed last night the ter
mination of South Africa's mandate over
South-west Africa. It declared that henceforth
the giant territory "is a direct responsibility
of the United Nations."
Culminating a long and bitter debate the 121-
nation Assembly approved by a vote of 141
to 2 with 3 abstentions a resolution setting out
the most drastic U.N. action ever contemplated

in an effort to compel South Africa to give up
its rule over the territory, roughtly, the size
of Texas and New York State combined.
The United States and the Soviet Union
votpd for the resolution, while France and
Britain were among those who abstained.
• China Praises Missile System
TOKYO—Red China claimed yesterday the
development of a missile system to carry nu
clear bombs. It announced a guided missile
with a nuclear warhead, lofted Thursday,
"accurately hit the target at the appointed
distance, effecting a nuclear explosion."
How far the missile traveled was withheld,
but the test recalled a prediction last March
by Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara
that the Chinese within two or three years
would have an atomic strike capability of
500-700 miles.
The blast—the fourth announced by Peking
since 1964—came while President Johnson
was visiting neighboring Thailand. It thus
raised speculation that its timing may have
been designed to take Asian eyes off the

President's trip and the aftermath of the
Manila conference.
As in the previous tests, the Chinese pro
fessed only peaceful intent and said they
looked to the day when all nuclear weapons
would be destroyed.
• Soviets To Visit France
MOSCOW —Soviet Premier Alexei N. Kosygin
pay an official visit to France in the first half
of December, the Soviet government an
nounced last night.
Communist party leader Leonid I. Brezhnev
and President Nikolai V. Podgorny will visit
France sometime in 1967, the same govern
ment announcement said.
President Charles De Gaulle invited the
Soviet leaders to his country during a visit
here last June.

The visits to France are the first to a
major western nation announced for the So
viet leaders since they took over power from
former Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev in Oc
tober of 1964.
