# 'Atrocity,' Claims Art Show Critic
## 
### BILL LIRANGE 
The Student Sidewalk Art
Show at Tresidder, concluding
today its two-day stand, rep
resents a sampling of the crea
tive endeavors of, largely, the
Stanford student community.
With the exception of only a few
pieces, primarily the photogra
phy, the exhibit is an atrocity;
it is an insult to better taste
and intelligence—a display of
debasement detrimental to the
encouragement of would-be con
tributors of worth.
This judgment is not to deny
the diligence of the organizers
who have provided an oppor
tunity for "budding artists' 'to
expose and sell their "wares"
(which for the most part lack
true conviction and at times

approach, it appears, therapeu
tic exercises), but it would be
better to have nothing at all
than this marketplace for in
competence.
Surely professionalism is not
expected considering the obvi
ous limitations, but some at
tempt at selective elimination
to control quality should have
been made; essentially any ex
hibition should be coherent—the
element of homogeneity being,
at least, a resonable degree of
ability.
Criticism is basically with the
concept of the show and its or
ganization.
In allowing so much poor
work to be shown, the effect is
mundane—a veritable eyesore
comparable to the cheap tourist

attractions such as one finds
in Sausalito and Greenwich Vil
lage. The color, activity and
novel distraction is an almost
heretical act of entertainment in
the name of art. It is utter de
ception to continue to accept
this prostitution (which in the
same sense calls attention to
the exhibits along the main
staircase of the library!).
The available occasion to

sell is harmful in that it prompts
prematurity. More formal stu
dent exhibits are acceptable for
what they are, but even they are
selective to some extent and,
moreover, are less presumptuous
in that they don't pretend to
raise the works to the level of a
saleable commodity on the
grounds of a grossly miscon
strued predilection.
