# Randy Weston Jazz; Afro-American Beat
## 
### 
Pianist-composer Randy Wes
ton and his Sextet will give a
benefit jazz concert at 8 p.m.
Sunday in Dinkelspiel. The Stan
ford University Coordinating
Committee for Equal Educa
tional Development (SUCCEED)
is sponsoring the performance.
This concert was initially or
ganized by Stanford Medical
School faculty, students, and
staff, under the sponsorship of
SUCCEED, as a memorial to
Luke Kabat. Due to administra
tive difficulties, the concert will
no longer benefit the Luke
Kabat Memorial Fund. All pro
ceeds will be used to further
the objectives of the committee.
Weston and his sextet are
currently on their first West
Coast tour, with performances
at the Both/And in San Fran
cisco, the Monterey Jazz Festi
val, and five University of Cal
ifornia campuses as a part of
the "Festival of Negro Arts."
Big Black On Congas
Other members of the group
are Ray Copeland, trumpet and
fluegelhorn; Walter Brennan,
tenor saxophone; Bill Wood,
bass; Lenny Mc√ürowne, jazz
drums; and Big Black, who was
featured on the conga drums at
last year's Monterey Festival
with Dizzy Gillespie.
Weston has been greatly in
fluenced by Thelonius Monk and
by African themes which he in
corporates in several of his
original compositions. The
group's initial album, "Randy,"
was New York Times high-fidel
ity critic John S. Wilson's first
choice as Album of the Year
in Down Beat magazine's 1966
International Critics' poll.
The jazz musicians have won
fame as one of four groups in a
program designed to bring live
jazz into schools, churches, hos
pitals, and wherever people
gather. The motive of the pro
gram is "to give new relevance
to Negro history through a
series of history-of-jazz con

certs," according to an NAACP
interview.
Appreciation, White And
Negro
Weston says that his group
wants to "help develop the ap
preciation and understanding of
the music of the Afro-American
in both the white and Negro
communities."
In 1963, Weston visited Ni
geria as a guest of the American
and Nigerian Societies of Afri
can Culture. He was featured in
concerts in Lagos and spoke
on the influence of African
rhythms on American jazz, a
point which his group empha
sizes.
"Indigenous African music
presents a wealth of material for
the jazz musician," Weston be
lieves. In his album he has
translated into the jazz idiom
three tunes by African compos
ers and a Congolese children's
song.
Link Africa And America
Since his Nigerian trip, Wes
ton has begun to compose more
songs which link the traditions
of Africa and America. "In com
posing these songs," he has said,
"I have been very aware of
drawing upon my own heritage,
an invaluable part of which is
the uniqueness, variety, and
beauty of indigenous African
music; these compositions ex
press my conviction that there
is a living, vital relationship
between the blues-based music
of America and authentic Afri
can music."
Weston holds that "What's
happening in jazz is that it's be
coming more and more Eastern,
more involved in foreign
rhythms."
He is excited about the un
tapped possibilities of not only
African but also Indian indige
nous music and the future of
these elements in American jazz.
Tickets for the Sunday con
cert are on sale at the Tresid
der box office.
