THEATER
The Stanford Repertory Theater continues its production of
Shapespeare's ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA this Friday and Sat
urday evening and then picks up again next Wednesday through
Saturday. Starring Loretta Leversee as the Seductress of the Nile
and her playmate Antony (Morgan Stearne), this Erik Vos pro
duction has improved somewhat, perhaps through rumor alone,
since opening night and should be worthwhile to drop in on, if
only to build your own repertory of Shakespeare-on-stage.
For the next three weekends, Phil King's comedy, SEE HOW
THEY RUN, will play at the Hillbarn Theatre (Ralston and Ala
meda, Belmont). A farce of mistaken identities, punctured dignities,
and casual uproar, "Run" will premiere the Hillbarn's new season.
At the Playhouse, Beach and Hyde, S.F., Becket's WAITING FOR
GODOT continues tonight at 8:30. Tomorrow night at the Play
house, Moliere's THE IMAGINARY INVALID will wheelchair
through its last performance.
Take note all you late-day teenagers: Remember Ricky Nelson?
he's coming to town. Ricky (he has insisted since his 21st birthday on
the more sophisticated, mature, manly Rick as opposed to Ricky)
will co-star with Rudy Vallee in HOW TO SUCCEED IN BUSI
NESS opening at the Circle Star this Tuesday. In case you won
dering, yes, it is a musical.
FILMS
Ingmar Bergman's THE MAGICIAN will be shown tonight at
Tresidder. The film is in the tradition of many of Bergman's weird;
wandering scenarios; Max Von Sydow has the lead slot as the
magician pretending to be deaf and dumb while meandering about
the countryside in a caravan.
Saturday night at Tresidder we have ONLY TWO CAN PLAY,
starring Peter Sellers. Haven't received any scoop on the show but
Sellers usually makes a mediocre script into a passable one.
Among other notables, Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas take
sides in a perfidious cabal of megolomaniacal militarists to tak<
over the control of the U.S. government from a decidedly wishy
washed-out President. The title of this "terrifying and real possibil
ity" is SEVEN DAYS EN MAY to be shown at the Sunday Flicks
at Mem Aud.
OTHER
Next Sunday, November 6, the girls on the hill at Notre Dame
are sponsoring a concert featuring THE WE 5. This is the first
program of this type that has passed the censure board of thesc
hallowed, ivy walls. No doubt if the concert gets a big reception
The We 5 will only be a spring board to big and better things like
Doug Clark and the Hot Nuts or even MY own band, Willie Pop
corn and his Mazola Machine. Grab up those tickets!
Pianist-composer RANDY WESTON AND HIS SEXTET will give
a concert this Sunday in Dink at 8 p.m. (see article on this page).
MEL TORME, swinging vocal proponent of the popular jazz
idiom, opened last Monday for a month-long engagement at the
HUNGRY i. He only has three weeks left, better see him fast.
Two concerts in Dink round off this week's column: the Depart
ment of Music will present CHAMBER MUSIC this Sunday at 3:30
(see article on this page); and INDIAN MUSICIANS will play at
8 p.m. this Wednesday.
