# Phi Delt Case: No New Facts
## 
### KIRK HANEN Associate Editor 
University officials yesterday stood
their ground, categorically refusing
to disclose facts concerning Interfra
ternity Board's (IFB) review of com
plaints against Phi Delta Theta fra
ternity.
Four members of Phi Delta Theta
appeared before IFB Wednesday eve
ning, in a meeting closed to public
and press. Philip H. Rinelander, Com
mittee of Fifteen chairman, and ex-of
ficio member Richard Lagerstrom
were not present.
Re-adjournment
IFB will re-convene Monday at 8:15
"in hopes," according to one mem
ber, "of wrapping the matter up."
He stressed, however, that the mat
ter was far from decided.
Monday's meeting will also be
closed. IFC chairman Drennen Jones
(Kappa Sigma) cited constitutional
privilege in refusing The Daily's re
quest to witness the proceedings.
In a related development, Prof.
James T. Watkins, Phi Delta Theta
advisor declined comment when ques
tioned about speculation that he might
disqualify himself from participation
in any decision.
"Our lips are buttoned," Watkins
added, "and will remain that way."
Related Incidents
IFB's judicial review of Phi Delta
Theta stemmed from at least three
complaints lodged against the fra
ternity. The most recent of these
came from Mills College in Oakland,
when several coeds protested alledged
misconduct by Phi Delt members dur
ing a party on the Stanford campus.
Dean Robert G. Gordon denied that
the misconduct was of a sexual na
ture.
Earlier in the quarter, Phi Delt
members were caught stealing some
11,000 copies of The Daily, and cited
for alleged foul play with fire arms.
