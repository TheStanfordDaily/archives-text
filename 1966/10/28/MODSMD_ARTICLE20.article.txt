# Ecliptic Penumbras Cast 'Giant Shadow'
## 
### THOMAS HARDY 
The unexpected highpoint of
reviewing "Cast A Giant Sha
dow" was learning that the Park
Theater shortly begins a weekly
series of Walt Disney nature
films. None of these, hopefully,
will feature Kirk Douglas
whose acting abilities as evi
denced in "Cast A Giant Sha
dow" fail to approach even the
minimal demands of a guberna
tional campaign in California.
The film is based on the life
of Colonel Mickey Marcus (Kirk
Douglas). Col. Marcus, Ameri
can war hero, fallen away Jew,
and volunteer military advisor

to the Palestinian Jewish Forces
in 1947-48, is depicted as a rest
less soul who, seeking self-ful
fillment, finally discovers it
through total acceptance of the
dream to found a Jewish nation.
This demanding portrayal of ag
onized introspection is some
what handicapped by Douglas,
whose interpretation is best ana
logized to the scintillating dyna
mism of a recent victim of a
frontal lobotomy.
Miss Senta Berger co-stars as
Magda, the luscious Jewish par
tisan lusting unsuccessfully af
ter Col. Marcus. Marcus, alas,
remains loyal to his waiting
wife, played by Angie Dickin
son. Angie hiccups well but does
not otherwise rise to any artis
tic heights greater than the film
itself.
Miss Berger, on the other
hand, is better than Miss Dickin
son and has the best line in the
movie: when Col. Marcus,
prompted by Magda's lamenting
of her husband's impotence, asks
about her views on adultry, she
replies "Biblical." That is the
best line.
Should Have Known Better
Also featured are Yul Brynner
as an Israeli commander, Frank
Sinatra as a flying mercenary,
and John Wayne as John Wayne
in a general's uniform. All
should have known better than
to sign a contract before read
ing the script.
Unhappily for pro-Israeli zea
lots and pro-Arab masochists,
"Cast A Giant Shadow" does not
follow the blatant "good-guy,
bad buy" dichotomy that we find
in "Exodus." Contradicting the
J. J. Throit syndrome, "Shadow"
is almost impartial, which is re
freshing in so stagnant a film.
