# Vengeful Poloists Travel South

### WELLS SHOEMAKER Sports Editor 
Still smarting from a 7-5 re
buff from undefeated UCLA last
weekend, the Indian water polo
ists will have the chance for re
venge Saturday in the Bruins'
pool. Friday, the Cards must
face the angry USC squad that
lost to Stanford, 11-10, In sudden
death two weeks ago.
UCLA finished last year's sea
son with a 15-0 record and the
nation's number one ranking.
Stanford, 17-4, ended up in sec
ond place. The Bruins, now 8-0,
have not lost their hold on the
first rating.
Bruin's Could Repeat
Although the Uclans appear to
be in good shape for a repetition
of last year's championship, a

sound Stanford victory and a
strong season finish for the In
dians could turn the tables.
UCLA topped Stanford in Los
Angeles last year with a 7-6 de
cision. Olympic veteran Stan
Cole, returns from last season's
Bruin pack, along with Russ
Webb and Bruce Bradley.
Cole scored three goals in the
second half last week to break
the Indians' back. Torrey Webb
and Bradley each hit two.
Stanford will have to bottle up
Cole, and keep the Indian of
fense driving at full force
throughout the game to return
successful from this last chance
game.

Southern Cal has lost only
once to Stanford in the Trojan
pool. Last season the Cards
turned back USC, 12-10, In a
foul-infested game where Gaiy
Sheerer scored 8 goals in less
than three quarters.
Sheerer scored three times and
threw three assist passes in
Stanford's overtime victory ear
lier this year.
Roy Saari and Dean Willeford,
both Olympic-seasoned, form the
bulwark of the Trojan offense,
together with transfer Bill John
son. Saari scored five goals in
the 1966 USC-Stanford encoun
ter.
USC's pool houses a crew of

notorious referees. When Stan
ford was national champion in
1963, five out of the seven Stan
ford starters had fouled out be
fore halftime. Last year, a total
of 15 men fouled out from USC
and Stanford,
Depth Saves Indians
Last year, Stanford's depth
managed to keep the Tribe alive
before the onslaught of Saari
and the official's whistle. Stan
ford can expect the same dual
battle this year.
Southern Cal's pool is wider
than the normal tank, and has
one shallow end. The shallow
end has always posed problems
to the Indians, who play in a

regulation six foot deep pool.
Stanford will have to do bet
ter in the shooting department
if it hopes to come back from
Los Angeles smiling. The Cards
have been shooting over 48 per
cent for the season, but shot only
28 percent against USC and a
fatally low 25 percent against
UCLA.
Parmely, Sheerer On Fire
Mark Parmely leads the In
dian shooters with 19 goals in
9 games. Sheerer, who missed
three games because of a foot
injury, has scored 17 and tossed
15 assist passes. John Parker,
who tallied three times against
the Bruins, has also scored 17.

Depth Saves Indians
Last year, Stanford's depth
managed to keep the Tribe alive
before the onslaught of Saari
and the official's whistle. Stan
ford can expect the same dual
battle this year.
Southern Cal's pool is wider
than the normal tank, and has
one shallow end. The shallow
end has always posed problems
to the Indians, who play in a

regulation six foot deep pool.
Stanford will have to do bet
ter in the shooting department
if it hopes to come back from
Los Angeles smiling. The Cards
have been shooting over 48 per
cent for the season, but shot only
28 percent against USC and a
fatally low 25 percent against
UCLA.
Parmely, Sheerer On Fire
Mark Parmely leads the In
dian shooters with 19 goals in
9 games. Sheerer, who missed
three games because of a foot
injury, has scored 17 and tossed
15 assist passes. John Parker,
who tallied three times against
the Bruins, has also scored 17.
Still smarting from a 7-5 re
buff from undefeated UCLA last
weekend, the Indian water polo
ists will have the chance for re
venge Saturday in the Bruins'
pool. Friday, the Cards must
face the angry USC squad that
lost to Stanford, 11-10, In sudden
death two weeks ago.
UCLA finished last year's sea
son with a 15-0 record and the
nation's number one ranking.
Stanford, 17-4, ended up in sec
ond place. The Bruins, now 8-0,
have not lost their hold on the
first rating.
Bruin's Could Repeat
Although the Uclans appear to
be in good shape for a repetition
of last year's championship, a

sound Stanford victory and a
strong season finish for the In
dians could turn the tables.
UCLA topped Stanford in Los
Angeles last year with a 7-6 de
cision. Olympic veteran Stan
Cole, returns from last season's
Bruin pack, along with Russ
Webb and Bruce Bradley.
Cole scored three goals in the
second half last week to break
the Indians' back. Torrey Webb
and Bradley each hit two.
Stanford will have to bottle up
Cole, and keep the Indian of
fense driving at full force
throughout the game to return
successful from this last chance
game.

Southern Cal has lost only
once to Stanford in the Trojan
pool. Last season the Cards
turned back USC, 12-10, In a
foul-infested game where Gaiy
Sheerer scored 8 goals in less
than three quarters.
Sheerer scored three times and
threw three assist passes in
Stanford's overtime victory ear
lier this year.
Roy Saari and Dean Willeford,
both Olympic-seasoned, form the
bulwark of the Trojan offense,
together with transfer Bill John
son. Saari scored five goals in
the 1966 USC-Stanford encoun
ter.
USC's pool houses a crew of

notorious referees. When Stan
ford was national champion in
1963, five out of the seven Stan
