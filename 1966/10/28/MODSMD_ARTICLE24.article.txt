## Soccer Squad Hosts USF 
### BILL GRAHAM 
Stanford's varsity soccer team
goes against a strong Univer
sity of San Francisco eleven,
Saturday at 10:30 at Stanford.
Four of the team's players went
to San Jose last week for the
preliminary tryouts for the 1968
Olympics.
The Indians must come up
with a victory to keep alive any
hope for a first place league
finish. Currently Stanford and
California are tied for second,
behind San Jose and USF.
The Dons downed Stanford
twice last year and have five

starters back from that team.
But Coach Fred Priddle feels
that his team "will give them a
run for their money."
San Francisco plays a very
slow methodical game. All the
players are very good ball han
dlers and the Dons like to work
the ball in until they can get a
close shot at the goal.
Stanford has a much more
wide-open style of play, relying
on fast breaks and longer shots
to got their scores.
