# WASHINGTON VS. WASHINGTON
## Tribe Seeks First AAWU Win 
### RAFAEL PALACIO 
In search of their first Pacific
-8 victory of the year, the Stan
ford Indians host the University
of Washington Huskies tomor
row afternoon at 1:30.
Last week both the Indians
and the Huskies came out with
wins. The Indians eked out a 6-3
win over Illinois, while the Hus
kies sneaked by Oregon 10-7.
Both trains come into the
game with strong defenses and
lackluster offenses. The Wash
ington offense may also lack ad
ditional punch in tomorrow's
game, due to the loss of two key
players.
Moore Suspended
Don Moore, until last week
the AAWU's leading rusher, re
ceived a suspension from Head
Coach Jim Owen for the dura
tion of the season. Also missing
will be the sophomore pass
catching sensation Jim Cope,
due to a mysterious illness
which has not yet been diag
nosed.
The Indian offense has been
sputtering of late, and has been
characterized by unimaginative
play calling. The ground game
has at times looked very impres
sive, but due to poor passing has
not been as effective as it could
be.
Indian quarterback Gene
Washington seems to be healthy
again, and it is possible that he
may put the ball in the air more

often. If he does, the man who
will probably be on the receiv
ing end is end Bob Conrad, who
last week boosted his season
total to 28 receptions, with five
grabs against the fighting Ulini.
Offense Revamped
After the loss to Cal, Wash
ington Coach Owen reshuffled
the Huskie offense, and only
three men retained their start
ing berths. Two of these were
quarterback Tom Sparlin and
Dave Williams, an All-American
end last year.
This year Williams has been
used mostly as a decoy due to
heavy coverage, but with the ab
sence of Cope, Sparlin may be
zeroing in on Williams more of
ten tomorrow.
Against common opponents
the Huskies hold a slight edge.
The USC Trojans narrowly de
feated the Washington squad
17-14, while the Trojans dismem
bered the Tribe 21-7.
The Huskies also defeated Ore
gon, who did upset the Indians
by a 7-3 score. But the Indians

do have the factor of revenge
going for them.
Last year the tribe journeyed
to Washington and received a
41-8 humiliation. They are eager
to get back at the Huskies. Also,

the Huskies hold a seven game
winning streak over the Indians,
which the Tribe thinks should
be snapped.
In all actuality, this is a must
game for both teams. Each team
needs this win in order to sal
vage the season and finish up
the rest of the year with a good
record. Stanford and Washing
ton hold identical .500 records
of 3-3-0.

Both teams needed good de
fense to win last week, and in
that department, both teams
seem to be holding up well.
Washington is at a slight disad
vantage though, due to the loss
of experienced defensive back
Dave Dillon.
On the plus side though, the
Huskies have the improved
work of left guard Mike Mag
gart, who started the season as
a third stringer, and has now
won a starting job.
The Indians have good news
too as far as the defense is con
cerned. Ailing Mike Hibler will
be able to play tomorrow, and
his presence in the lineup auto
matically improves the defen
sive line.
Another source of satisfaction
for Coach Ralston has been the
improved play of the defensive
backfield. Gaining experience
with every game, juniors Donn
Renwick and Dave Nelson have
been playing well, while senior
John Guillory has been doing
his usual good job.

All things considered, tomor
row's ball game shapes up as a
tight one. Washington still re
mains a slight favorite to win.
Their offense has been slightly
crippled due to loss of key per
sonnel but they retain a sound
team.
Stanford Too Inconsistent
Stanford's inconsistencies can
not help but hurt their chances
of victory. The spotty passing,
predictably unimaginative play
calling, poor pass protection, all
these things combined will be
enough to bring about another
defeat.
It should be a close contest,
with probably the defenses domi
nating play and a lot of punting
taking place. The eventual out
come will probably be Washing
ton out in front by a touchdown.

-8 victory of the year, the Stan
ford Indians host the University
of Washington Huskies tomor
row afternoon at 1:30.
Last week both the Indians
and the Huskies came out with
wins. The Indians eked out a 6-3
win over Illinois, while the Hus
kies sneaked by Oregon 10-7.
Both trains come into the
game with strong defenses and
lackluster offenses. The Wash
ington offense may also lack ad
ditional punch in tomorrow's
game, due to the loss of two key
players.
Moore Suspended
Don Moore, until last week
the AAWU's leading rusher, re
ceived a suspension from Head
Coach Jim Owen for the dura
tion of the season. Also missing
will be the sophomore pass
catching sensation Jim Cope,
due to a mysterious illness
which has not yet been diag
nosed.
The Indian offense has been
sputtering of late, and has been
characterized by unimaginative
play calling. The ground game
has at times looked very impres
sive, but due to poor passing has
not been as effective as it could
be.
Indian quarterback Gene
Washington seems to be healthy
again, and it is possible that he
may put the ball in the air more

often. If he does, the man who
will probably be on the receiv
ing end is end Bob Conrad, who
last week boosted his season
total to 28 receptions, with five
grabs against the fighting Ulini.
Offense Revamped
After the loss to Cal, Wash
ington Coach Owen reshuffled
the Huskie offense, and only
three men retained their start
ing berths. Two of these were
quarterback Tom Sparlin and
Dave Williams, an All-American
end last year.
This year Williams has been
used mostly as a decoy due to
heavy coverage, but with the ab
sence of Cope, Sparlin may be
zeroing in on Williams more of
ten tomorrow.
Against common opponents
the Huskies hold a slight edge.
The USC Trojans narrowly de
feated the Washington squad
17-14, while the Trojans dismem
bered the Tribe 21-7.
The Huskies also defeated Ore
gon, who did upset the Indians
by a 7-3 score. But the Indians

do have the factor of revenge
going for them.
Last year the tribe journeyed
to Washington and received a
41-8 humiliation. They are eager
to get back at the Huskies. Also,

the Huskies hold a seven game
winning streak over the Indians,
which the Tribe thinks should
be snapped.
In all actuality, this is a must
game for both teams. Each team
needs this win in order to sal
vage the season and finish up
the rest of the year with a good
record. Stanford and Washing
ton hold identical .500 records
of 3-3-0.

Both teams needed good de
fense to win last week, and in
that department, both teams
seem to be holding up well.
Washington is at a slight disad
vantage though, due to the loss
of experienced defensive back
Dave Dillon.
On the plus side though, the
Huskies have the improved
work of left guard Mike Mag
gart, who started the season as
a third stringer, and has now
won a starting job.
The Indians have good news
too as far as the defense is con
cerned. Ailing Mike Hibler will
be able to play tomorrow, and
his presence in the lineup auto
matically improves the defen
sive line.
Another source of satisfaction
for Coach Ralston has been the
improved play of the defensive
backfield. Gaining experience
with every game, juniors Donn
Renwick and Dave Nelson have
been playing well, while senior
John Guillory has been doing
his usual good job.

All things considered, tomor
row's ball game shapes up as a
tight one. Washington still re
mains a slight favorite to win.
Their offense has been slightly
crippled due to loss of key per
sonnel but they retain a sound
team.
Stanford Too Inconsistent
Stanford's inconsistencies can
not help but hurt their chances
of victory. The spotty passing,
predictably unimaginative play
calling, poor pass protection, all
these things combined will be
enough to bring about another
defeat.
It should be a close contest,
with probably the defenses domi
nating play and a lot of punting
taking place. The eventual out
come will probably be Washing
ton out in front by a touchdown.

of Washington Huskies tomor
row afternoon at 1:30.
Last week both the Indians
and the Huskies came out with
wins. The Indians eked out a 6-3
win over Illinois, while the Hus
kies sneaked by Oregon 10-7.
Both trains come into the
game with strong defenses and
lackluster offenses. The Wash
ington offense may also lack ad
ditional punch in tomorrow's
game, due to the loss of two key
players.
Moore Suspended
Don Moore, until last week
the AAWU's leading rusher, re
ceived a suspension from Head
Coach Jim Owen for the dura
tion of the season. Also missing
will be the sophomore pass
catching sensation Jim Cope,
due to a mysterious illness
which has not yet been diag
nosed.
The Indian offense has been
sputtering of late, and has been
characterized by unimaginative
play calling. The ground game
has at times looked very impres
sive, but due to poor passing has
not been as effective as it could
be.
Indian quarterback Gene
Washington seems to be healthy
again, and it is possible that he
may put the ball in the air more

often. If he does, the man who
will probably be on the receiv
ing end is end Bob Conrad, who
last week boosted his season
total to 28 receptions, with five
grabs against the fighting Ulini.
Offense Revamped
After the loss to Cal, Wash
ington Coach Owen reshuffled
the Huskie offense, and only
three men retained their start
ing berths. Two of these were
quarterback Tom Sparlin and
Dave Williams, an All-American
end last year.
This year Williams has been
used mostly as a decoy due to
heavy coverage, but with the ab
sence of Cope, Sparlin may be
zeroing in on Williams more of
ten tomorrow.
Against common opponents
the Huskies hold a slight edge.
The USC Trojans narrowly de
feated the Washington squad
17-14, while the Trojans dismem
bered the Tribe 21-7.
The Huskies also defeated Ore
gon, who did upset the Indians
by a 7-3 score. But the Indians

do have the factor of revenge
going for them.
Last year the tribe journeyed
to Washington and received a
41-8 humiliation. They are eager
to get back at the Huskies. Also,

the Huskies hold a seven game
winning streak over the Indians,
which the Tribe thinks should
be snapped.
In all actuality, this is a must
game for both teams. Each team
needs this win in order to sal
vage the season and finish up
the rest of the year with a good
record. Stanford and Washing
ton hold identical .500 records
of 3-3-0.

Both teams needed good de
fense to win last week, and in
that department, both teams
seem to be holding up well.
Washington is at a slight disad
vantage though, due to the loss
of experienced defensive back
Dave Dillon.
On the plus side though, the
Huskies have the improved
work of left guard Mike Mag
gart, who started the season as
a third stringer, and has now
won a starting job.
The Indians have good news
too as far as the defense is con
cerned. Ailing Mike Hibler will
be able to play tomorrow, and
his presence in the lineup auto
matically improves the defen
sive line.
Another source of satisfaction
for Coach Ralston has been the
improved play of the defensive
backfield. Gaining experience
with every game, juniors Donn
Renwick and Dave Nelson have
been playing well, while senior
John Guillory has been doing
his usual good job.

All things considered, tomor
row's ball game shapes up as a
tight one. Washington still re
mains a slight favorite to win.
Their offense has been slightly
crippled due to loss of key per
sonnel but they retain a sound
team.
Stanford Too Inconsistent
Stanford's inconsistencies can
not help but hurt their chances
of victory. The spotty passing,
predictably unimaginative play
calling, poor pass protection, all
these things combined will be
enough to bring about another
defeat.
It should be a close contest,
with probably the defenses domi
nating play and a lot of punting
taking place. The eventual out
come will probably be Washing
ton out in front by a touchdown.
