# SU Harriers Run Against Owls, SCYV
## 
### 
The Stanford cross country
squad hosts Santa Clara Youth
Village and Foothill College at
10:00 a.m., Saturday, in the
Cards' last 1966 meet on the
Stanford Golf Course.
The Stanford frosh, now only
seven seconds away from the
team record for the Golf Course,
run against Foothill at 10:30.
Top Indian runners Brook
Thomas, Jim Letterer, and Bob
Kelley face a stiff challenge
from Rich Brackett of Foothill
and ex-San Jose State runners
Tom Tuite and Joe Neff.
Chuck Menz, Greg Brock,
Tom Ross, and Steve Speirn
have all paced their way into
the circle of Stanford's top ten
freshman runners. The fresh
men knocked 24 seconds off their
combined times in last week's
victory over Cal. Only seven
seconds remain between the
frosh and the record.
Both freshman and varsity
races leave from the second tee.
