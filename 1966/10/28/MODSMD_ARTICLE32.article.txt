# Plunkett, Parish Lead Papoose Blitz Against Hard-Hitting Cal
## 
### BILL GRAHAM 
Fresh from a 28-7 victory
against San Jose State, the
freshman football team will try
to make it two in a row against
a powerful California eleven,
Saturday at 10.
The Cubs are undefeated so
far this season with a 28 0 romp
over the University of California
and a 20-6 drubbing of a talented
UCLA team to their credit. Stan
ford frosh coach Russ Hamton
characterized the Berkeley
froshmen as a "well-coached,
well-disciplined team."
Cal has a relatively simple of
fense, working off a straight "T"
formation with a split left end.
The Cubs rely mainly on power
plays and dives, coupled with
strong blocking from the right
side of the line to get their
yardage.
Halfbacks Steve Metcalf and
Gary Fowler hit the right side
repeatedly for steady gains
against UCLA. Metcalf carried
eighteen times for 72 yards and
Fowler toted the ball fifteen
times for 94 yards.
Little Passing
With runners like these, Cal
doesn't need to pass much, and
they don't. The Cubs have
thrown only nineteen times in
their two games as opposed to
forty-nine for their opponents.

However when they do throw,
they are quite effective. Cal
passes have gone for three touch
downs and 189 yards. Split end
Jim Smith, who is a fast, elusive
runner, is the favorite target for
quarterback Don Wilcox.
Cal's defense is a wide-tackle
six and it is equally as tough as
the Cub offense. The defensive
unit has only given up six points
in two games.
Stanford, however, has proved
that it too can play football. On
offense the Cards have big Don
Parish who gained 122 yards
Coach Hampton called Parish
"outstanding" on both offense
and defense.
Plunkett Improves
The Cards should also have
some improved passing from
quarterback Jim Punkett to
give added balance to their at
tack. Plunkett was still over
throwing somewhat in the San
Jose game, but according to
Hampton, he has come along
rapidly during practice this
week.
Backing up Plunkett will be
Dick Oliver, who came in against
San Jose in the closing mo
ments and directed the team to
its final score. Oliver will start
the game at safety.
As a whole, the Papooses' of
fense has improved tremend-

ously since the beginning of
the season, in fact since the
first half of their last game.
Hampton feels that this im
provement is due to several
things, such as better blocking
by the offensive line, but es
sentially to the fact that the
team is making fewer mis
takes. He noted that it is very
hard to score when you fumble
eight times in a game, as his
team did against Southern Cal,
in its first outing.
Carpenter Injured
The Papooses will go into this
game missing huge Ken Carpen

ter from his position at center.
Carpenter, who was injured
against Southern Cal, played
against the Spartans last week,
but is scheduled for an opera
tion this Friday and will be out
for the rest of the season.
The loss of Carpenter could
be serious for the I'Yosh. Jim
Schriber will take his place, but
if Schriber is injured, there is no
regular center to replace him.
Charley Freeman, a second
team linebacker, was moved to
center this week in practice, but
a week is hardly long enough to
learn a position.
