# Lack Of Trust Pervades Campus

### Bruce Campbell 
Stanford is a community of
fear.
Instead of moving closer to
being "a community of scho
lars," we are moving away from
it. Student - administration ref
lations are more strained now
than before. Lines of communi
cations have been established,
with the result that conflicts
which were assumed to exist be
fore are now seen openly. And
neither side trusts the other.
Mope, important, however,
than the fact that differences
are now being admitted and
faced, is the fact that the bal
ance of power has shifted from
the administration to the stu
dents.
In the past, so few students
were iinvolved in activist causes
that, In the words of one ob
server, "The administration
could divide and conquer." That
era had ended. "If a majority is
being isolated and treated un
justly, a substantial segment of
the community will rise in their
defense," the same observer
notes.
More significantly, however,
a substantial segment of the
student community is now be
ginning to think about Itself:
how it is treated, what kind of
education it receives, how the
university's involvement in so
ciety alTects it.
Dissatisfaction
Much of the blame or praise
for this 6hift has been attri
buted to student-body president
David Harris. Harris based his
campaign last spring on dissatis
faction with the existing struc
ture and on a pledge to work for
educational reform.
Harris got more votes than
anyone ever has in a Stanford
election, and, for the first time,
a "substantial segment" of the
student body publicly protested
the status quo, and, some feel,
the people responsible for it.
Harris himself feels his elec
tion is "an expression of student
statement of dissatisfaction with
the type of education given here,
and the student's role in it."
Dave Harris' election, how
ever, was not the only event of
spring quarter. A group of
thirty students expressed their
protest against the system by
staging a three-day sit-in at the
President's Office on the issues
of the University's administer
ing draft deferment tests and
student p.irtlcipation in decision
making.
Etold Steps
Students were active on sev
eral other fronts as well. The
University's liquor policy was
changed 1o admit the existence
of alcohol on campus (a move
characteriwd by some as "a
bold step into the 1930'5"). The
University's long-standing pro
hibition on sectarian worship

was being lifted ("a bold step in
to the twentieth century"). The
Legislature challenged the ad
ministration by making student
law on dorm visiting hours con
flict with the University hours
("a bold step by the Legisla
ture").
By the end of spring quarter,
one student leader could note
with a fair amount of truth:
"The deans are punchy. For the
first time in history, the admini
stration, not the students, will
use the summer to rest up."
The significance of last spring
quarter was that, in the never
ending battle between students
and administration, the students
gained the upper hand.
Students have the momentum
to bring educational change and
they have the numbers to back
up with force their stands and
goals. The administration, at
least to some, is running scared.
It is unfortunate that, in an
academic community, decisions
must be made on the basis of
force, but that seems to be the
real politlk of Stanford. Most
student leaders have concluded
that, in this struggle between
opposing power blocs, brinks
manship is the way to push
Stanford over the edge of great
ness.
Self-Critical
In any situation where one
person or group is exercising
power, there is a special obliga
tion placed on him to be continu
ally self-critical to make sure he
is not abusing the power.
Lack of this self-evaluation
has been a recurrent student
criticism of the Stanford admini
stration over the last half dec
ade, but its force has been re
versed: students are now the
ones upon whom the greatest
burden for self-examination lies.
It is the activists who now have
to examine their motives and
the actions to determine how
pure the motive and how con
gruent the motive and the act.
The latter Is perhaps the
greatest danger: that students
use whatever means available to
gain immediate ends and there
by lose sight of long-range goals,
the main one being the creation
of a community of scholars.
When students first began ar
ticulating their ideas, asking
questions, and demanding ans
wers and actions, they met
with obduracy. They reacted by
using force of their own. Such
tactics have met with success,
but their use tends to postpone
the creation of a community of
scholars rather than to encour
age it.
Among the values usually
posited for an academic commu
nity are the use of truth as the
final authority in decision-mak
ing, and a commitment to an
environment in which rational
processes can be employed.
The pressure tactics used by
some student leaders in recent

years, although necessary to ac
complish specific ends, seem to
imply an abdication of the high
er values toward which students
are working.
Basic Problem
These students, however, have
not been driven to this position
easily. The basic problem, on
both sides, is lack of trust.
Students have become embit
tered because of the administra
tion's actions and attitudes; and
the administration has frequent
ly been disappointed at student
failures. There seems to be a
temporary stalemate; each side
mistrusts the other and each is
reluctant to strike the first
blow.
The current attitude toward
the administration has at least
three principal causes, (apart
from dishonesty, frequently ru
mored and sometimes document
ed to be an administrative tac
tic).
The first is administrative
paternalism. Paternalism is
characterized by over-protective
ness. It is the attitude that "we
know your best interest better
than you do."
There are at least two factors
to this situation which are of

A student-activist during his undergraduate career at Stanford,

lations in the wake of Stanford's first year of intense student
activism. Campbell, who graduated in June, concludes from his
own experiences that both students and administrators must
maintain a spirit of self-criticality.

importance. The first is that in
some instances some students
need protection, either from au
thorities or from themselves. In
these cases, the University ad
ministration very validly serves
in loco parentis.
The fact that in some in
stances the administration prop
erly serves in this role has less
ened the impact of 6tudent de
mands for an end to paternalism
in areas in which students feel
authority is unneeded as well as
unwanted. Thus student de
mands, usually absolute (for ex
ample, no women's hours at all),
have been partly ignored be
cause of the administration's fo
cusing on what students feel are
exceptional cases rather than
the norm.
Paternalism
But It was a long time before
students could even get their
grievances heard, much less
partially acted upon, because of
the second factor in paternal
ism: it is self-fulfilling and self
perpetuating.
If one believes that young
people, because of their lack of
experience, have nothing to con
tribute to the solution of a prob
lem, the person will not pay at
tention to them and his judg
ment will be self-fulfilling.
In a similar manner, if he
never listens to students, they
will never have anything to say
to him and the system will be
self-perpetuating.
It is on this basis that stu
dents justify the original use of
force in dealing with the admini
stration: the administration was
n't listening and it was neces
sary "to blast out some dead
wood" in order that dialogue
could begin.
Whether students have be
come so committed to the use
of force that they have lost
sight of the fact that their tac
tics may, in fact, be an abdica
tion of their goals is another
question.
The second cause of student
mistrust of the administration
is administrative mentality. This
Is an outlook pre occupied with
the smooth functioning of the
system. It puts the premium on
efficiency and peace and quiet;
in other words, the means be
come an end.
Bureaucrats
What is lost when greatest at
tention is given to means is a
focus on people. This mentality
shows itself in small ways, such
as by the bureaucrats who, in
the words of one administrator,
'fceem to get their greatest joy

from making students jump."
But it also appears in more
significant ways. Frequently,
student leaders complain, deci
sions are made arbitrarily and
then never explained, although
students seek an explanation.
The third factor which has
produced student bitterness iB
the administration's overcon
cern with triviality. Administra
tors seem to students to be bog
ged down in the day-to-day rou
tine of paperwork. Such great
focus is given to this, students
say, that the University admini
stration refuses to discuss basic
questions such as what is a uni
versity?, or even, what is Stan
ford?
No Direction
This situation has two impor
tant consequences. The first is
on the manner in which issues
are resolved. Students are per
sistent and, as much as the ad
ministration would sometimes
like to ignore them, they can
eventually raise an issue to a
head.
The result is that a solution i6
reached in a crisis situation
where the deciding factors are
frequently not the merits of the
issue but merely the expediences

of a polititical situation. Were
the administration to begin dis
cission before an issue became
a "matter of principle," deci
sions could be made on a more
reasonable basis.
More importantly, students
wonder whether this attention
to daily detail means that Stan
ford has no sense of direction or
purpose. Former student-body
president Bud Wedin wrote last
spring: "unlike Faustus who
sold his soul to the devil for
more honorable reasons, Stan
ford has aligned itself with the
biases and norms of the techno
logical society for want of any
soul at all."
Stanford is growing rapidly,
but no one but students, they
feel, has stopped to ask where?,
at what cost?, to what end?.
Stanford's greatest problem
is its poor sense of relativity.
An institution can measure it
self in relation to several things.
First, it can compare its present
performance and accomplish
ments to those it made in the
past.
Second, it can measure itself
against other similar institu
tions. And third, it can compare
itself to an ideal of where it
would like to go.
Stanford is now in a transition
stage from the first type of rela
tivity to the second. The first is
lingering strong because the Un
versity is run by people who at
tended Stanford before the war.
Twenty of twenty-two trustees
are Stanford alumni, as are
most of the higher members of
the administration.
Stanford is in transition, how
ever, and programs are fre
quently adopted because Har
vard, or Pomona had them ten
years ago.
Dialogue
The two things which are
missing in the Stanford admini
stration, students feel, are self
criticality and a goal. Too much
effort is spent in defense of the
current system and, although
students are now listened to, no
dialogue about the current struc
ture is yet possible.
"Real disagreement is now
impossible," one former student
leader states. "The joint inquiry
we desire requires the question
ing of assumptions. The admini
stration is as yet unwilling to do
this."
In addition, they hope that
once the debate is begun, the
whole University community
will enter it, so that the admini
stration will eventually have to
discuss the University's pur
poses.

In an academic community,
these students feel, final author
ity (that which commands great
est allegiance) is truth. All other
authorities are subservient to
truth and gain their legitimacy
in relation to this primary au
thority.
One Facet
The authority vested in the
board of trustees, then, is for ad
ministrative matters and the
board is only thought to be the
final authority because "the ad
ministration and the trustees
tend to think of education as
one facet of administration,
rather than vice versa, as it
should be," as one observer
.states.
What students are calling foi
ls "authority which is related
to education."
When students speak of edu
cation, the two key words they
use are "development" and "par
ticipation." They consider edu
cation to go beyond the class
room and to include the matura
tion of the whole person, with
an emphasis, however, on the
development of the intellect.
Three factors are crucial for
the developing of the mind.
First, students expect the Uni
versity to give them the tools
of scholarship. Assuming stu
dents already have the basic
tools such as math and langu
age, this means principally
teaching how to approach a
body of knowledge: what are
the relevant questions to ask?
These tools include habits of
thinking and techniques for ex
tracting knowledge and prin
ciples.
The second factor is curio
sity: the desire to continue to
use these tools for a lifetime
And third is the critical sense.
A person must never become
satisfied either with the world,
nor with his understanding of
it. He must continually question
both the institutions and prac
tices of society, and his own
complacency.
Dry Learning
Students feel that participa
tion in the learning process is
crucial to the development of
the mind, because without it
learning is dry. If a person is
studying by engaging himself
over the subject matter, he wiP
get caught up in the subject
and in the process with the re
sult that a life-long habit of
self-initiating inquiry begins.
These conceptions of author
ity and education can be applied
profitably to student-adminLstra
tion relations and might form a
beginning of a reconstruction of
those relations on a more ration
al basis.
Students suggest that deci
sions in the University be made
on the basis of the truth of the
situation. In a university, people
are admitted to the decision
making processes to the extent
that they participate in the
communal engagement of intel
lect over a particular problem.
Thus, students should be ad
mitted to decision-making not on
the basis that they are a consti
tuency but to the extent that
they use their minds.
Stanford enters this year a
community of fear. Students
mistrust the administration. And
the administration, because the
balance of power has shifted in
favor of students, is fearful of
student power.
It might be helpful for each
side to remember a few things.
The administration should rea
lize that, however monumental
the barriers now, a start toward
a detente has been made in stu
dent conceptions like those of
authority and education.
And student leaders might re
member that a new obligation
of self-criticality has been placed
on them by virtue of the fact
that they have , in some ways,
the upper hand over the admini
stration.
This self-examination might
begin with the question of
whether use of pressure tactics
results in loss of sight of the
goal: the creation of an aca
demic community, in which
truth is the final authority and
in which engagement of the in
tellect over a subject is the pro
cess of finding truth .

being "a community of scho

it. Student - administration ref

Mope, important, however,
than the fact that differences
are now being admitted and
faced, is the fact that the bal

server, "The administration
could divide and conquer." That

notes.
More significantly, however,
a substantial segment of the
student community is now be
ginning to think about Itself:
how it is treated, what kind of
education it receives, how the
university's involvement in so
ciety alTects it.
Dissatisfaction
Much of the blame or praise
for this 6hift has been attri
buted to student-body president
David Harris. Harris based his
campaign last spring on dissatis
faction with the existing struc
ture and on a pledge to work for
educational reform.
Harris got more votes than
anyone ever has in a Stanford
election, and, for the first time,
a "substantial segment" of the
student body publicly protested
the status quo, and, some feel,
the people responsible for it.
Harris himself feels his elec
tion is "an expression of student
statement of dissatisfaction with
the type of education given here,
and the student's role in it."
Dave Harris' election, how
ever, was not the only event of
spring quarter. A group of
thirty students expressed their
protest against the system by
staging a three-day sit-in at the
President's Office on the issues
of the University's administer
ing draft deferment tests and
student p.irtlcipation in decision
making.
Etold Steps
Students were active on sev
eral other fronts as well. The
University's liquor policy was
changed 1o admit the existence
of alcohol on campus (a move
characteriwd by some as "a
bold step into the 1930'5"). The
University's long-standing pro
hibition on sectarian worship

was being lifted ("a bold step in
to the twentieth century"). The
Legislature challenged the ad
ministration by making student
law on dorm visiting hours con
flict with the University hours
("a bold step by the Legisla
ture").
By the end of spring quarter,
one student leader could note
with a fair amount of truth:
"The deans are punchy. For the
first time in history, the admini
stration, not the students, will
use the summer to rest up."
The significance of last spring
quarter was that, in the never
ending battle between students
and administration, the students
gained the upper hand.
Students have the momentum
to bring educational change and
they have the numbers to back
up with force their stands and
goals. The administration, at
least to some, is running scared.
It is unfortunate that, in an
academic community, decisions
must be made on the basis of
force, but that seems to be the
real politlk of Stanford. Most
student leaders have concluded
that, in this struggle between
opposing power blocs, brinks
manship is the way to push
Stanford over the edge of great
ness.
Self-Critical
In any situation where one
person or group is exercising
power, there is a special obliga
tion placed on him to be continu
ally self-critical to make sure he
is not abusing the power.
Lack of this self-evaluation
has been a recurrent student
criticism of the Stanford admini
stration over the last half dec
ade, but its force has been re
versed: students are now the
ones upon whom the greatest
burden for self-examination lies.
It is the activists who now have
to examine their motives and
the actions to determine how
pure the motive and how con
gruent the motive and the act.
The latter Is perhaps the
greatest danger: that students
use whatever means available to
gain immediate ends and there
by lose sight of long-range goals,
the main one being the creation
of a community of scholars.
When students first began ar
ticulating their ideas, asking
questions, and demanding ans
wers and actions, they met
with obduracy. They reacted by
using force of their own. Such
tactics have met with success,
but their use tends to postpone
the creation of a community of
scholars rather than to encour
age it.
Among the values usually
posited for an academic commu
nity are the use of truth as the
final authority in decision-mak
ing, and a commitment to an
environment in which rational
processes can be employed.
The pressure tactics used by
some student leaders in recent

years, although necessary to ac
complish specific ends, seem to
imply an abdication of the high
er values toward which students
are working.
Basic Problem
These students, however, have
not been driven to this position
easily. The basic problem, on
both sides, is lack of trust.
Students have become embit
tered because of the administra
tion's actions and attitudes; and
the administration has frequent
ly been disappointed at student
failures. There seems to be a
temporary stalemate; each side
mistrusts the other and each is
reluctant to strike the first
blow.
The current attitude toward
the administration has at least
three principal causes, (apart
from dishonesty, frequently ru
mored and sometimes document
ed to be an administrative tac
tic).
The first is administrative
paternalism. Paternalism is
characterized by over-protective
ness. It is the attitude that "we
know your best interest better
than you do."
There are at least two factors
to this situation which are of

A student-activist during his undergraduate career at Stanford,
Bruce Campbell assesses the state of student-administration re
lations in the wake of Stanford's first year of intense student
activism. Campbell, who graduated in June, concludes from his
own experiences that both students and administrators must
maintain a spirit of self-criticality.

importance. The first is that in
some instances some students
need protection, either from au
thorities or from themselves. In
these cases, the University ad
ministration very validly serves
in loco parentis.
The fact that in some in
stances the administration prop
erly serves in this role has less
ened the impact of 6tudent de
mands for an end to paternalism
in areas in which students feel
authority is unneeded as well as
unwanted. Thus student de
mands, usually absolute (for ex
ample, no women's hours at all),
have been partly ignored be
cause of the administration's fo
cusing on what students feel are
exceptional cases rather than
the norm.
Paternalism
But It was a long time before
students could even get their
grievances heard, much less
partially acted upon, because of
the second factor in paternal
ism: it is self-fulfilling and self
perpetuating.
If one believes that young
people, because of their lack of
experience, have nothing to con
tribute to the solution of a prob
lem, the person will not pay at
tention to them and his judg
ment will be self-fulfilling.
In a similar manner, if he
never listens to students, they
will never have anything to say
to him and the system will be
self-perpetuating.
It is on this basis that stu
dents justify the original use of
force in dealing with the admini
stration: the administration was
n't listening and it was neces
sary "to blast out some dead
wood" in order that dialogue
could begin.
Whether students have be
come so committed to the use
of force that they have lost
sight of the fact that their tac
tics may, in fact, be an abdica
tion of their goals is another
question.
The second cause of student
mistrust of the administration
is administrative mentality. This
Is an outlook pre occupied with
the smooth functioning of the
system. It puts the premium on
efficiency and peace and quiet;
in other words, the means be
come an end.
Bureaucrats
What is lost when greatest at
tention is given to means is a
focus on people. This mentality
shows itself in small ways, such
as by the bureaucrats who, in
the words of one administrator,
'fceem to get their greatest joy

from making students jump."
But it also appears in more
significant ways. Frequently,
student leaders complain, deci
sions are made arbitrarily and
then never explained, although
students seek an explanation.
The third factor which has
produced student bitterness iB
the administration's overcon
cern with triviality. Administra
tors seem to students to be bog
ged down in the day-to-day rou
tine of paperwork. Such great
focus is given to this, students
say, that the University admini
stration refuses to discuss basic
questions such as what is a uni
versity?, or even, what is Stan
ford?
No Direction
This situation has two impor
tant consequences. The first is
on the manner in which issues
are resolved. Students are per
sistent and, as much as the ad
ministration would sometimes
like to ignore them, they can
eventually raise an issue to a
head.
The result is that a solution i6
reached in a crisis situation
where the deciding factors are
frequently not the merits of the
issue but merely the expediences

of a polititical situation. Were
the administration to begin dis
cission before an issue became
a "matter of principle," deci
sions could be made on a more
reasonable basis.
More importantly, students
wonder whether this attention
to daily detail means that Stan
ford has no sense of direction or
purpose. Former student-body
president Bud Wedin wrote last
spring: "unlike Faustus who
sold his soul to the devil for
more honorable reasons, Stan
ford has aligned itself with the
biases and norms of the techno
logical society for want of any
soul at all."
Stanford is growing rapidly,
but no one but students, they
feel, has stopped to ask where?,
at what cost?, to what end?.
Stanford's greatest problem
is its poor sense of relativity.
An institution can measure it
self in relation to several things.
First, it can compare its present
performance and accomplish
ments to those it made in the
past.
Second, it can measure itself
against other similar institu
tions. And third, it can compare
itself to an ideal of where it
would like to go.
Stanford is now in a transition
stage from the first type of rela
tivity to the second. The first is
lingering strong because the Un
versity is run by people who at
tended Stanford before the war.
Twenty of twenty-two trustees
are Stanford alumni, as are
most of the higher members of
the administration.
Stanford is in transition, how
ever, and programs are fre
quently adopted because Har
vard, or Pomona had them ten
years ago.
Dialogue
The two things which are
missing in the Stanford admini
stration, students feel, are self
criticality and a goal. Too much
effort is spent in defense of the
current system and, although
students are now listened to, no
dialogue about the current struc
ture is yet possible.
"Real disagreement is now
impossible," one former student
leader states. "The joint inquiry
we desire requires the question
ing of assumptions. The admini
stration is as yet unwilling to do
this."
In addition, they hope that
once the debate is begun, the
whole University community
will enter it, so that the admini
stration will eventually have to
discuss the University's pur
poses.

In an academic community,
these students feel, final author
ity (that which commands great
est allegiance) is truth. All other
authorities are subservient to
truth and gain their legitimacy
in relation to this primary au
thority.
One Facet
The authority vested in the
board of trustees, then, is for ad
ministrative matters and the
board is only thought to be the
final authority because "the ad
ministration and the trustees
tend to think of education as
one facet of administration,
rather than vice versa, as it
should be," as one observer
.states.
What students are calling foi
ls "authority which is related
to education."
When students speak of edu
cation, the two key words they
use are "development" and "par
ticipation." They consider edu
cation to go beyond the class
room and to include the matura
tion of the whole person, with
an emphasis, however, on the
development of the intellect.
Three factors are crucial for
the developing of the mind.
First, students expect the Uni
versity to give them the tools
of scholarship. Assuming stu
dents already have the basic
tools such as math and langu
age, this means principally
teaching how to approach a
body of knowledge: what are
the relevant questions to ask?
These tools include habits of
thinking and techniques for ex
tracting knowledge and prin
ciples.
The second factor is curio
sity: the desire to continue to
use these tools for a lifetime
And third is the critical sense.
A person must never become
satisfied either with the world,
nor with his understanding of
it. He must continually question
both the institutions and prac
tices of society, and his own
complacency.
Dry Learning
Students feel that participa
tion in the learning process is
crucial to the development of
the mind, because without it
learning is dry. If a person is
studying by engaging himself
over the subject matter, he wiP
get caught up in the subject
and in the process with the re
sult that a life-long habit of
self-initiating inquiry begins.
These conceptions of author
ity and education can be applied
profitably to student-adminLstra
tion relations and might form a
beginning of a reconstruction of
those relations on a more ration
al basis.
Students suggest that deci
sions in the University be made
on the basis of the truth of the
situation. In a university, people
are admitted to the decision
making processes to the extent
that they participate in the
communal engagement of intel
lect over a particular problem.
Thus, students should be ad
mitted to decision-making not on
the basis that they are a consti
tuency but to the extent that
they use their minds.
Stanford enters this year a
community of fear. Students
mistrust the administration. And
the administration, because the
balance of power has shifted in
favor of students, is fearful of
student power.
It might be helpful for each
side to remember a few things.
The administration should rea
lize that, however monumental
the barriers now, a start toward
a detente has been made in stu
dent conceptions like those of
authority and education.
And student leaders might re
member that a new obligation
of self-criticality has been placed
on them by virtue of the fact
that they have , in some ways,
the upper hand over the admini
stration.
This self-examination might
begin with the question of
whether use of pressure tactics
results in loss of sight of the
goal: the creation of an aca
demic community, in which
truth is the final authority and
in which engagement of the in
tellect over a subject is the pro
cess of finding truth .
Stanford is a community of
fear.

than before. Lines of communi

neither side trusts the other.
Mope, important, however,
than the fact that differences
are now being admitted and
faced, is the fact that the bal
ance of power has shifted from
the administration to the stu
dents.
In the past, so few students
were iinvolved in activist causes
that, In the words of one ob
server, "The administration
could divide and conquer." That
era had ended. "If a majority is
being isolated and treated un
justly, a substantial segment of
the community will rise in their
defense," the same observer
notes.
More significantly, however,
a substantial segment of the
student community is now be
ginning to think about Itself:
how it is treated, what kind of
education it receives, how the
university's involvement in so
ciety alTects it.
Dissatisfaction
Much of the blame or praise
for this 6hift has been attri
buted to student-body president
David Harris. Harris based his
campaign last spring on dissatis
faction with the existing struc
ture and on a pledge to work for
educational reform.
Harris got more votes than
anyone ever has in a Stanford
election, and, for the first time,
a "substantial segment" of the
student body publicly protested
the status quo, and, some feel,
the people responsible for it.
Harris himself feels his elec
tion is "an expression of student
statement of dissatisfaction with
the type of education given here,
and the student's role in it."
Dave Harris' election, how
ever, was not the only event of
spring quarter. A group of
thirty students expressed their
protest against the system by
staging a three-day sit-in at the
President's Office on the issues
of the University's administer
ing draft deferment tests and
student p.irtlcipation in decision
making.
Etold Steps
Students were active on sev
eral other fronts as well. The
University's liquor policy was
changed 1o admit the existence
of alcohol on campus (a move
characteriwd by some as "a
bold step into the 1930'5"). The
University's long-standing pro
hibition on sectarian worship

was being lifted ("a bold step in
to the twentieth century"). The
Legislature challenged the ad
ministration by making student
law on dorm visiting hours con
flict with the University hours
("a bold step by the Legisla
ture").
By the end of spring quarter,
one student leader could note
with a fair amount of truth:
"The deans are punchy. For the
first time in history, the admini
stration, not the students, will
use the summer to rest up."
The significance of last spring
quarter was that, in the never
ending battle between students
and administration, the students
gained the upper hand.
Students have the momentum
to bring educational change and
they have the numbers to back
up with force their stands and
goals. The administration, at
least to some, is running scared.
It is unfortunate that, in an
academic community, decisions
must be made on the basis of
force, but that seems to be the
real politlk of Stanford. Most
student leaders have concluded
that, in this struggle between
opposing power blocs, brinks
manship is the way to push
Stanford over the edge of great
ness.
Self-Critical
In any situation where one
person or group is exercising
power, there is a special obliga
tion placed on him to be continu
ally self-critical to make sure he
is not abusing the power.
Lack of this self-evaluation
has been a recurrent student
criticism of the Stanford admini
stration over the last half dec
ade, but its force has been re
versed: students are now the
ones upon whom the greatest
burden for self-examination lies.
It is the activists who now have
to examine their motives and
the actions to determine how
pure the motive and how con
gruent the motive and the act.
The latter Is perhaps the
greatest danger: that students
use whatever means available to
gain immediate ends and there
by lose sight of long-range goals,
the main one being the creation
of a community of scholars.
When students first began ar
ticulating their ideas, asking
questions, and demanding ans
wers and actions, they met
with obduracy. They reacted by
using force of their own. Such
tactics have met with success,
but their use tends to postpone
the creation of a community of
scholars rather than to encour
age it.
Among the values usually
posited for an academic commu
nity are the use of truth as the
final authority in decision-mak
ing, and a commitment to an
environment in which rational
processes can be employed.
The pressure tactics used by
some student leaders in recent

years, although necessary to ac
complish specific ends, seem to
imply an abdication of the high
er values toward which students
are working.
Basic Problem
These students, however, have
not been driven to this position
easily. The basic problem, on
both sides, is lack of trust.
Students have become embit
tered because of the administra
tion's actions and attitudes; and
the administration has frequent
ly been disappointed at student
failures. There seems to be a
temporary stalemate; each side
mistrusts the other and each is
reluctant to strike the first
blow.
The current attitude toward
the administration has at least
three principal causes, (apart
from dishonesty, frequently ru
mored and sometimes document
ed to be an administrative tac
tic).
The first is administrative
paternalism. Paternalism is
characterized by over-protective
ness. It is the attitude that "we
know your best interest better
than you do."
There are at least two factors
to this situation which are of

A student-activist during his undergraduate career at Stanford,
Bruce Campbell assesses the state of student-administration re
lations in the wake of Stanford's first year of intense student
activism. Campbell, who graduated in June, concludes from his
own experiences that both students and administrators must
maintain a spirit of self-criticality.

importance. The first is that in
some instances some students
need protection, either from au
thorities or from themselves. In
these cases, the University ad
ministration very validly serves
in loco parentis.
The fact that in some in
stances the administration prop
erly serves in this role has less
ened the impact of 6tudent de
mands for an end to paternalism
in areas in which students feel
authority is unneeded as well as
unwanted. Thus student de
mands, usually absolute (for ex
ample, no women's hours at all),
have been partly ignored be
cause of the administration's fo
cusing on what students feel are
exceptional cases rather than
the norm.
Paternalism
But It was a long time before
students could even get their
grievances heard, much less
partially acted upon, because of
the second factor in paternal
ism: it is self-fulfilling and self
perpetuating.
If one believes that young
people, because of their lack of
experience, have nothing to con
tribute to the solution of a prob
lem, the person will not pay at
tention to them and his judg
ment will be self-fulfilling.
In a similar manner, if he
never listens to students, they
will never have anything to say
to him and the system will be
self-perpetuating.
It is on this basis that stu
dents justify the original use of
force in dealing with the admini
stration: the administration was
n't listening and it was neces
sary "to blast out some dead
wood" in order that dialogue
could begin.
Whether students have be
come so committed to the use
of force that they have lost
sight of the fact that their tac
tics may, in fact, be an abdica
tion of their goals is another
question.
The second cause of student
mistrust of the administration
is administrative mentality. This
Is an outlook pre occupied with
the smooth functioning of the
system. It puts the premium on
efficiency and peace and quiet;
in other words, the means be
come an end.
Bureaucrats
What is lost when greatest at
tention is given to means is a
focus on people. This mentality
shows itself in small ways, such
as by the bureaucrats who, in
the words of one administrator,
'fceem to get their greatest joy

from making students jump."
But it also appears in more
significant ways. Frequently,
student leaders complain, deci
sions are made arbitrarily and
then never explained, although
students seek an explanation.
The third factor which has
produced student bitterness iB
the administration's overcon
cern with triviality. Administra
tors seem to students to be bog
ged down in the day-to-day rou
tine of paperwork. Such great
focus is given to this, students
say, that the University admini
stration refuses to discuss basic
questions such as what is a uni
versity?, or even, what is Stan
ford?
No Direction
This situation has two impor
tant consequences. The first is
on the manner in which issues
are resolved. Students are per
sistent and, as much as the ad
ministration would sometimes
like to ignore them, they can
eventually raise an issue to a
head.
The result is that a solution i6
reached in a crisis situation
where the deciding factors are
frequently not the merits of the
issue but merely the expediences

of a polititical situation. Were
the administration to begin dis
cission before an issue became
a "matter of principle," deci
sions could be made on a more
reasonable basis.
More importantly, students
wonder whether this attention
to daily detail means that Stan
ford has no sense of direction or
purpose. Former student-body
president Bud Wedin wrote last
spring: "unlike Faustus who
sold his soul to the devil for
more honorable reasons, Stan
ford has aligned itself with the
biases and norms of the techno
logical society for want of any
soul at all."
Stanford is growing rapidly,
but no one but students, they
feel, has stopped to ask where?,
at what cost?, to what end?.
Stanford's greatest problem
is its poor sense of relativity.
An institution can measure it
self in relation to several things.
First, it can compare its present
performance and accomplish
ments to those it made in the
past.
Second, it can measure itself
against other similar institu
tions. And third, it can compare
itself to an ideal of where it
would like to go.
Stanford is now in a transition
stage from the first type of rela
tivity to the second. The first is
lingering strong because the Un
versity is run by people who at
tended Stanford before the war.
Twenty of twenty-two trustees
are Stanford alumni, as are
most of the higher members of
the administration.
Stanford is in transition, how
ever, and programs are fre
quently adopted because Har
vard, or Pomona had them ten
years ago.
Dialogue
The two things which are
missing in the Stanford admini
stration, students feel, are self
criticality and a goal. Too much
effort is spent in defense of the
current system and, although
students are now listened to, no
dialogue about the current struc
ture is yet possible.
"Real disagreement is now
impossible," one former student
leader states. "The joint inquiry
we desire requires the question
ing of assumptions. The admini
stration is as yet unwilling to do
this."
In addition, they hope that
once the debate is begun, the
whole University community
will enter it, so that the admini
stration will eventually have to
discuss the University's pur
poses.

In an academic community,
these students feel, final author
ity (that which commands great
est allegiance) is truth. All other
authorities are subservient to
truth and gain their legitimacy
in relation to this primary au
thority.
One Facet
The authority vested in the
board of trustees, then, is for ad
ministrative matters and the
board is only thought to be the
final authority because "the ad
ministration and the trustees
tend to think of education as
one facet of administration,
rather than vice versa, as it
should be," as one observer
.states.
What students are calling foi
ls "authority which is related
to education."
When students speak of edu
cation, the two key words they
use are "development" and "par
ticipation." They consider edu
cation to go beyond the class
room and to include the matura
tion of the whole person, with
an emphasis, however, on the
development of the intellect.
Three factors are crucial for
the developing of the mind.
First, students expect the Uni
versity to give them the tools
of scholarship. Assuming stu
dents already have the basic
tools such as math and langu
age, this means principally
teaching how to approach a
body of knowledge: what are
the relevant questions to ask?
These tools include habits of
thinking and techniques for ex
tracting knowledge and prin
ciples.
The second factor is curio
sity: the desire to continue to
use these tools for a lifetime
And third is the critical sense.
A person must never become
satisfied either with the world,
nor with his understanding of
it. He must continually question
both the institutions and prac
tices of society, and his own
complacency.
Dry Learning
Students feel that participa
tion in the learning process is
crucial to the development of
the mind, because without it
learning is dry. If a person is
studying by engaging himself
over the subject matter, he wiP
get caught up in the subject
and in the process with the re
sult that a life-long habit of
self-initiating inquiry begins.
These conceptions of author
ity and education can be applied
profitably to student-adminLstra
tion relations and might form a
beginning of a reconstruction of
those relations on a more ration
al basis.
Students suggest that deci
sions in the University be made
on the basis of the truth of the
situation. In a university, people
are admitted to the decision
making processes to the extent
that they participate in the
communal engagement of intel
lect over a particular problem.
Thus, students should be ad
mitted to decision-making not on
the basis that they are a consti
tuency but to the extent that
they use their minds.
Stanford enters this year a
community of fear. Students
mistrust the administration. And
the administration, because the
balance of power has shifted in
favor of students, is fearful of
student power.
It might be helpful for each
side to remember a few things.
The administration should rea
lize that, however monumental
the barriers now, a start toward
a detente has been made in stu
dent conceptions like those of
authority and education.
And student leaders might re
member that a new obligation
of self-criticality has been placed
on them by virtue of the fact
that they have , in some ways,
the upper hand over the admini
stration.
This self-examination might
begin with the question of
whether use of pressure tactics
results in loss of sight of the
goal: the creation of an aca
demic community, in which
truth is the final authority and
in which engagement of the in
tellect over a subject is the pro
cess of finding truth .
Stanford is a community of
fear.
Instead of moving closer to
being "a community of scho
lars," we are moving away from
it. Student - administration ref
lations are more strained now
than before. Lines of communi
cations have been established,
with the result that conflicts
which were assumed to exist be

cations have been established,
with the result that conflicts
which were assumed to exist be
fore are now seen openly. And
neither side trusts the other.
Mope, important, however,
than the fact that differences
are now being admitted and
faced, is the fact that the bal
ance of power has shifted from
the administration to the stu
dents.
In the past, so few students
were iinvolved in activist causes
that, In the words of one ob
server, "The administration
could divide and conquer." That
era had ended. "If a majority is
being isolated and treated un
justly, a substantial segment of
the community will rise in their
defense," the same observer
notes.
More significantly, however,
a substantial segment of the
student community is now be
ginning to think about Itself:
how it is treated, what kind of
education it receives, how the
university's involvement in so
ciety alTects it.
Dissatisfaction
Much of the blame or praise
for this 6hift has been attri
buted to student-body president
David Harris. Harris based his
campaign last spring on dissatis
faction with the existing struc
ture and on a pledge to work for
educational reform.
Harris got more votes than
anyone ever has in a Stanford
election, and, for the first time,
a "substantial segment" of the
student body publicly protested
the status quo, and, some feel,
the people responsible for it.
Harris himself feels his elec
tion is "an expression of student
statement of dissatisfaction with
the type of education given here,
and the student's role in it."
Dave Harris' election, how
ever, was not the only event of
spring quarter. A group of
thirty students expressed their
protest against the system by
staging a three-day sit-in at the
President's Office on the issues
of the University's administer
ing draft deferment tests and
student p.irtlcipation in decision
making.
Etold Steps
Students were active on sev
eral other fronts as well. The
University's liquor policy was
changed 1o admit the existence
of alcohol on campus (a move
characteriwd by some as "a
bold step into the 1930'5"). The
University's long-standing pro
hibition on sectarian worship

was being lifted ("a bold step in
to the twentieth century"). The
Legislature challenged the ad
ministration by making student
law on dorm visiting hours con
flict with the University hours
("a bold step by the Legisla
ture").
By the end of spring quarter,
one student leader could note
with a fair amount of truth:
"The deans are punchy. For the
first time in history, the admini
stration, not the students, will
use the summer to rest up."
The significance of last spring
quarter was that, in the never
ending battle between students
and administration, the students
gained the upper hand.
Students have the momentum
to bring educational change and
they have the numbers to back
up with force their stands and
goals. The administration, at
least to some, is running scared.
It is unfortunate that, in an
academic community, decisions
must be made on the basis of
force, but that seems to be the
real politlk of Stanford. Most
student leaders have concluded
that, in this struggle between
opposing power blocs, brinks
manship is the way to push
Stanford over the edge of great
ness.
Self-Critical
In any situation where one
person or group is exercising
power, there is a special obliga
tion placed on him to be continu
ally self-critical to make sure he
is not abusing the power.
Lack of this self-evaluation
has been a recurrent student
criticism of the Stanford admini
stration over the last half dec
ade, but its force has been re
versed: students are now the
ones upon whom the greatest
burden for self-examination lies.
It is the activists who now have
to examine their motives and
the actions to determine how
pure the motive and how con
gruent the motive and the act.
The latter Is perhaps the
greatest danger: that students
use whatever means available to
gain immediate ends and there
by lose sight of long-range goals,
the main one being the creation
of a community of scholars.
When students first began ar
ticulating their ideas, asking
questions, and demanding ans
wers and actions, they met
with obduracy. They reacted by
using force of their own. Such
tactics have met with success,
but their use tends to postpone
the creation of a community of
scholars rather than to encour
age it.
Among the values usually
posited for an academic commu
nity are the use of truth as the
final authority in decision-mak
ing, and a commitment to an
environment in which rational
processes can be employed.
The pressure tactics used by
some student leaders in recent

years, although necessary to ac
complish specific ends, seem to
imply an abdication of the high
er values toward which students
are working.
Basic Problem
These students, however, have
not been driven to this position
easily. The basic problem, on
both sides, is lack of trust.
Students have become embit
tered because of the administra
tion's actions and attitudes; and
the administration has frequent
ly been disappointed at student
failures. There seems to be a
temporary stalemate; each side
mistrusts the other and each is
reluctant to strike the first
blow.
The current attitude toward
the administration has at least
three principal causes, (apart
from dishonesty, frequently ru
mored and sometimes document
ed to be an administrative tac
tic).
The first is administrative
paternalism. Paternalism is
characterized by over-protective
ness. It is the attitude that "we
know your best interest better
than you do."
There are at least two factors
to this situation which are of

A student-activist during his undergraduate career at Stanford,
Bruce Campbell assesses the state of student-administration re
lations in the wake of Stanford's first year of intense student
activism. Campbell, who graduated in June, concludes from his
own experiences that both students and administrators must
maintain a spirit of self-criticality.

importance. The first is that in
some instances some students
need protection, either from au
thorities or from themselves. In
these cases, the University ad
ministration very validly serves
in loco parentis.
The fact that in some in
stances the administration prop
erly serves in this role has less
ened the impact of 6tudent de
mands for an end to paternalism
in areas in which students feel
authority is unneeded as well as
unwanted. Thus student de
mands, usually absolute (for ex
ample, no women's hours at all),
have been partly ignored be
cause of the administration's fo
cusing on what students feel are
exceptional cases rather than
the norm.
Paternalism
But It was a long time before
students could even get their
grievances heard, much less
partially acted upon, because of
the second factor in paternal
ism: it is self-fulfilling and self
perpetuating.
If one believes that young
people, because of their lack of
experience, have nothing to con
tribute to the solution of a prob
lem, the person will not pay at
tention to them and his judg
ment will be self-fulfilling.
In a similar manner, if he
never listens to students, they
will never have anything to say
to him and the system will be
self-perpetuating.
It is on this basis that stu
dents justify the original use of
force in dealing with the admini
stration: the administration was
n't listening and it was neces
sary "to blast out some dead
wood" in order that dialogue
could begin.
Whether students have be
come so committed to the use
of force that they have lost
sight of the fact that their tac
tics may, in fact, be an abdica
tion of their goals is another
question.
The second cause of student
mistrust of the administration
is administrative mentality. This
Is an outlook pre occupied with
the smooth functioning of the
system. It puts the premium on
efficiency and peace and quiet;
in other words, the means be
come an end.
Bureaucrats
What is lost when greatest at
tention is given to means is a
focus on people. This mentality
shows itself in small ways, such
as by the bureaucrats who, in
the words of one administrator,
'fceem to get their greatest joy

from making students jump."
But it also appears in more
significant ways. Frequently,
student leaders complain, deci
sions are made arbitrarily and
then never explained, although
students seek an explanation.
The third factor which has
produced student bitterness iB
the administration's overcon
cern with triviality. Administra
tors seem to students to be bog
ged down in the day-to-day rou
tine of paperwork. Such great
focus is given to this, students
say, that the University admini
stration refuses to discuss basic
questions such as what is a uni
versity?, or even, what is Stan
ford?
No Direction
This situation has two impor
tant consequences. The first is
on the manner in which issues
are resolved. Students are per
sistent and, as much as the ad
ministration would sometimes
like to ignore them, they can
eventually raise an issue to a
head.
The result is that a solution i6
reached in a crisis situation
where the deciding factors are
frequently not the merits of the
issue but merely the expediences

of a polititical situation. Were
the administration to begin dis
cission before an issue became
a "matter of principle," deci
sions could be made on a more
reasonable basis.
More importantly, students
wonder whether this attention
to daily detail means that Stan
ford has no sense of direction or
purpose. Former student-body
president Bud Wedin wrote last
spring: "unlike Faustus who
sold his soul to the devil for
more honorable reasons, Stan
ford has aligned itself with the
biases and norms of the techno
logical society for want of any
soul at all."
Stanford is growing rapidly,
but no one but students, they
feel, has stopped to ask where?,
at what cost?, to what end?.
Stanford's greatest problem
is its poor sense of relativity.
An institution can measure it
self in relation to several things.
First, it can compare its present
performance and accomplish
ments to those it made in the
past.
Second, it can measure itself
against other similar institu
tions. And third, it can compare
itself to an ideal of where it
would like to go.
Stanford is now in a transition
stage from the first type of rela
tivity to the second. The first is
lingering strong because the Un
versity is run by people who at
tended Stanford before the war.
Twenty of twenty-two trustees
are Stanford alumni, as are
most of the higher members of
the administration.
Stanford is in transition, how
ever, and programs are fre
quently adopted because Har
vard, or Pomona had them ten
years ago.
Dialogue
The two things which are
missing in the Stanford admini
stration, students feel, are self
criticality and a goal. Too much
effort is spent in defense of the
current system and, although
students are now listened to, no
dialogue about the current struc
ture is yet possible.
"Real disagreement is now
impossible," one former student
leader states. "The joint inquiry
we desire requires the question
ing of assumptions. The admini
stration is as yet unwilling to do
this."
In addition, they hope that
once the debate is begun, the
whole University community
will enter it, so that the admini
stration will eventually have to
discuss the University's pur
poses.

In an academic community,
these students feel, final author
ity (that which commands great
est allegiance) is truth. All other
authorities are subservient to
truth and gain their legitimacy
in relation to this primary au
thority.
One Facet
The authority vested in the
board of trustees, then, is for ad
ministrative matters and the
board is only thought to be the
final authority because "the ad
ministration and the trustees
tend to think of education as
one facet of administration,
rather than vice versa, as it
should be," as one observer
.states.
What students are calling foi
ls "authority which is related
to education."
When students speak of edu
cation, the two key words they
use are "development" and "par
ticipation." They consider edu
cation to go beyond the class
room and to include the matura
tion of the whole person, with
an emphasis, however, on the
development of the intellect.
Three factors are crucial for
the developing of the mind.
First, students expect the Uni
versity to give them the tools
of scholarship. Assuming stu
dents already have the basic
tools such as math and langu
age, this means principally
teaching how to approach a
body of knowledge: what are
the relevant questions to ask?
These tools include habits of
thinking and techniques for ex
tracting knowledge and prin
ciples.
The second factor is curio
sity: the desire to continue to
use these tools for a lifetime
And third is the critical sense.
A person must never become
satisfied either with the world,
nor with his understanding of
it. He must continually question
both the institutions and prac
tices of society, and his own
complacency.
Dry Learning
Students feel that participa
tion in the learning process is
crucial to the development of
the mind, because without it
learning is dry. If a person is
studying by engaging himself
over the subject matter, he wiP
get caught up in the subject
and in the process with the re
sult that a life-long habit of
self-initiating inquiry begins.
These conceptions of author
ity and education can be applied
profitably to student-adminLstra
tion relations and might form a
beginning of a reconstruction of
those relations on a more ration
al basis.
Students suggest that deci
sions in the University be made
on the basis of the truth of the
situation. In a university, people
are admitted to the decision
making processes to the extent
that they participate in the
communal engagement of intel
lect over a particular problem.
Thus, students should be ad
mitted to decision-making not on
the basis that they are a consti
tuency but to the extent that
they use their minds.
Stanford enters this year a
community of fear. Students
mistrust the administration. And
the administration, because the
balance of power has shifted in
favor of students, is fearful of
student power.
It might be helpful for each
side to remember a few things.
The administration should rea
lize that, however monumental
the barriers now, a start toward
a detente has been made in stu
dent conceptions like those of
authority and education.
And student leaders might re
member that a new obligation
of self-criticality has been placed
on them by virtue of the fact
that they have , in some ways,
the upper hand over the admini
stration.
This self-examination might
begin with the question of
whether use of pressure tactics
results in loss of sight of the
goal: the creation of an aca
demic community, in which
truth is the final authority and
in which engagement of the in
tellect over a subject is the pro
cess of finding truth .
Stanford is a community of
fear.
Instead of moving closer to
being "a community of scho
lars," we are moving away from
it. Student - administration ref
lations are more strained now
than before. Lines of communi
cations have been established,
with the result that conflicts
which were assumed to exist be
fore are now seen openly. And
neither side trusts the other.

fore are now seen openly. And
neither side trusts the other.
Mope, important, however,
than the fact that differences
are now being admitted and
faced, is the fact that the bal
ance of power has shifted from
the administration to the stu
dents.
In the past, so few students
were iinvolved in activist causes
that, In the words of one ob
server, "The administration
could divide and conquer." That
era had ended. "If a majority is
being isolated and treated un
justly, a substantial segment of
the community will rise in their
defense," the same observer
notes.
More significantly, however,
a substantial segment of the
student community is now be
ginning to think about Itself:
how it is treated, what kind of
education it receives, how the
university's involvement in so
ciety alTects it.
Dissatisfaction
Much of the blame or praise
for this 6hift has been attri
buted to student-body president
David Harris. Harris based his
campaign last spring on dissatis
faction with the existing struc
ture and on a pledge to work for
educational reform.
Harris got more votes than
anyone ever has in a Stanford
election, and, for the first time,
a "substantial segment" of the
student body publicly protested
the status quo, and, some feel,
the people responsible for it.
Harris himself feels his elec
tion is "an expression of student
statement of dissatisfaction with
the type of education given here,
and the student's role in it."
Dave Harris' election, how
ever, was not the only event of
spring quarter. A group of
thirty students expressed their
protest against the system by
staging a three-day sit-in at the
President's Office on the issues
of the University's administer
ing draft deferment tests and
student p.irtlcipation in decision
making.
Etold Steps
Students were active on sev
eral other fronts as well. The
University's liquor policy was
changed 1o admit the existence
of alcohol on campus (a move
characteriwd by some as "a
bold step into the 1930'5"). The
University's long-standing pro
hibition on sectarian worship

was being lifted ("a bold step in
to the twentieth century"). The
Legislature challenged the ad
ministration by making student
law on dorm visiting hours con
flict with the University hours
("a bold step by the Legisla
ture").
By the end of spring quarter,
one student leader could note
with a fair amount of truth:
"The deans are punchy. For the
first time in history, the admini
stration, not the students, will
use the summer to rest up."
The significance of last spring
quarter was that, in the never
ending battle between students
and administration, the students
gained the upper hand.
Students have the momentum
to bring educational change and
they have the numbers to back
up with force their stands and
goals. The administration, at
least to some, is running scared.
It is unfortunate that, in an
academic community, decisions
must be made on the basis of
force, but that seems to be the
real politlk of Stanford. Most
student leaders have concluded
that, in this struggle between
opposing power blocs, brinks
manship is the way to push
Stanford over the edge of great
ness.
Self-Critical
In any situation where one
person or group is exercising
power, there is a special obliga
tion placed on him to be continu
ally self-critical to make sure he
is not abusing the power.
Lack of this self-evaluation
has been a recurrent student
criticism of the Stanford admini
stration over the last half dec
ade, but its force has been re
versed: students are now the
ones upon whom the greatest
burden for self-examination lies.
It is the activists who now have
to examine their motives and
the actions to determine how
pure the motive and how con
gruent the motive and the act.
The latter Is perhaps the
greatest danger: that students
use whatever means available to
gain immediate ends and there
by lose sight of long-range goals,
the main one being the creation
of a community of scholars.
When students first began ar
ticulating their ideas, asking
questions, and demanding ans
wers and actions, they met
with obduracy. They reacted by
using force of their own. Such
tactics have met with success,
but their use tends to postpone
the creation of a community of
scholars rather than to encour
age it.
Among the values usually
posited for an academic commu
nity are the use of truth as the
final authority in decision-mak
ing, and a commitment to an
environment in which rational
processes can be employed.
The pressure tactics used by
some student leaders in recent

years, although necessary to ac
complish specific ends, seem to
imply an abdication of the high
er values toward which students
are working.
Basic Problem
These students, however, have
not been driven to this position
easily. The basic problem, on
both sides, is lack of trust.
Students have become embit
tered because of the administra
tion's actions and attitudes; and
the administration has frequent
ly been disappointed at student
failures. There seems to be a
temporary stalemate; each side
mistrusts the other and each is
reluctant to strike the first
blow.
The current attitude toward
the administration has at least
three principal causes, (apart
from dishonesty, frequently ru
mored and sometimes document
ed to be an administrative tac
tic).
The first is administrative
paternalism. Paternalism is
characterized by over-protective
ness. It is the attitude that "we
know your best interest better
than you do."
There are at least two factors
to this situation which are of

A student-activist during his undergraduate career at Stanford,
Bruce Campbell assesses the state of student-administration re
lations in the wake of Stanford's first year of intense student
activism. Campbell, who graduated in June, concludes from his
own experiences that both students and administrators must
maintain a spirit of self-criticality.

importance. The first is that in
some instances some students
need protection, either from au
thorities or from themselves. In
these cases, the University ad
ministration very validly serves
in loco parentis.
The fact that in some in
stances the administration prop
erly serves in this role has less
ened the impact of 6tudent de
mands for an end to paternalism
in areas in which students feel
authority is unneeded as well as
unwanted. Thus student de
mands, usually absolute (for ex
ample, no women's hours at all),
have been partly ignored be
cause of the administration's fo
cusing on what students feel are
exceptional cases rather than
the norm.
Paternalism
But It was a long time before
students could even get their
grievances heard, much less
partially acted upon, because of
the second factor in paternal
ism: it is self-fulfilling and self
perpetuating.
If one believes that young
people, because of their lack of
experience, have nothing to con
tribute to the solution of a prob
lem, the person will not pay at
tention to them and his judg
ment will be self-fulfilling.
In a similar manner, if he
never listens to students, they
will never have anything to say
to him and the system will be
self-perpetuating.
It is on this basis that stu
dents justify the original use of
force in dealing with the admini
stration: the administration was
n't listening and it was neces
sary "to blast out some dead
wood" in order that dialogue
could begin.
Whether students have be
come so committed to the use
of force that they have lost
sight of the fact that their tac
tics may, in fact, be an abdica
tion of their goals is another
question.
The second cause of student
mistrust of the administration
is administrative mentality. This
Is an outlook pre occupied with
the smooth functioning of the
system. It puts the premium on
efficiency and peace and quiet;
in other words, the means be
come an end.
Bureaucrats
What is lost when greatest at
tention is given to means is a
focus on people. This mentality
shows itself in small ways, such
as by the bureaucrats who, in
the words of one administrator,
'fceem to get their greatest joy

from making students jump."
But it also appears in more
significant ways. Frequently,
student leaders complain, deci
sions are made arbitrarily and
then never explained, although
students seek an explanation.
The third factor which has
produced student bitterness iB
the administration's overcon
cern with triviality. Administra
tors seem to students to be bog
ged down in the day-to-day rou
tine of paperwork. Such great
focus is given to this, students
say, that the University admini
stration refuses to discuss basic
questions such as what is a uni
versity?, or even, what is Stan
ford?
No Direction
This situation has two impor
tant consequences. The first is
on the manner in which issues
are resolved. Students are per
sistent and, as much as the ad
ministration would sometimes
like to ignore them, they can
eventually raise an issue to a
head.
The result is that a solution i6
reached in a crisis situation
where the deciding factors are
frequently not the merits of the
issue but merely the expediences

of a polititical situation. Were
the administration to begin dis
cission before an issue became
a "matter of principle," deci
sions could be made on a more
reasonable basis.
More importantly, students
wonder whether this attention
to daily detail means that Stan
ford has no sense of direction or
purpose. Former student-body
president Bud Wedin wrote last
spring: "unlike Faustus who
sold his soul to the devil for
more honorable reasons, Stan
ford has aligned itself with the
biases and norms of the techno
logical society for want of any
soul at all."
Stanford is growing rapidly,
but no one but students, they
feel, has stopped to ask where?,
at what cost?, to what end?.
Stanford's greatest problem
is its poor sense of relativity.
An institution can measure it
self in relation to several things.
First, it can compare its present
performance and accomplish
ments to those it made in the
past.
Second, it can measure itself
against other similar institu
tions. And third, it can compare
itself to an ideal of where it
would like to go.
Stanford is now in a transition
stage from the first type of rela
tivity to the second. The first is
lingering strong because the Un
versity is run by people who at
tended Stanford before the war.
Twenty of twenty-two trustees
are Stanford alumni, as are
most of the higher members of
the administration.
Stanford is in transition, how
ever, and programs are fre
quently adopted because Har
vard, or Pomona had them ten
years ago.
Dialogue
The two things which are
missing in the Stanford admini
stration, students feel, are self
criticality and a goal. Too much
effort is spent in defense of the
current system and, although
students are now listened to, no
dialogue about the current struc
ture is yet possible.
"Real disagreement is now
impossible," one former student
leader states. "The joint inquiry
we desire requires the question
ing of assumptions. The admini
stration is as yet unwilling to do
this."
In addition, they hope that
once the debate is begun, the
whole University community
will enter it, so that the admini
stration will eventually have to
discuss the University's pur
poses.

In an academic community,
these students feel, final author
ity (that which commands great
est allegiance) is truth. All other
authorities are subservient to
truth and gain their legitimacy
in relation to this primary au
thority.
One Facet
The authority vested in the
board of trustees, then, is for ad
ministrative matters and the
board is only thought to be the
final authority because "the ad
ministration and the trustees
tend to think of education as
one facet of administration,
rather than vice versa, as it
should be," as one observer
.states.
What students are calling foi
ls "authority which is related
to education."
When students speak of edu
cation, the two key words they
use are "development" and "par
ticipation." They consider edu
cation to go beyond the class
room and to include the matura
tion of the whole person, with
an emphasis, however, on the
development of the intellect.
Three factors are crucial for
the developing of the mind.
First, students expect the Uni
versity to give them the tools
of scholarship. Assuming stu
dents already have the basic
tools such as math and langu
age, this means principally
teaching how to approach a
body of knowledge: what are
the relevant questions to ask?
These tools include habits of
thinking and techniques for ex
tracting knowledge and prin
ciples.
The second factor is curio
sity: the desire to continue to
use these tools for a lifetime
And third is the critical sense.
A person must never become
satisfied either with the world,
nor with his understanding of
it. He must continually question
both the institutions and prac
tices of society, and his own
complacency.
Dry Learning
Students feel that participa
tion in the learning process is
crucial to the development of
the mind, because without it
learning is dry. If a person is
studying by engaging himself
over the subject matter, he wiP
get caught up in the subject
and in the process with the re
sult that a life-long habit of
self-initiating inquiry begins.
These conceptions of author
ity and education can be applied
profitably to student-adminLstra
tion relations and might form a
beginning of a reconstruction of
those relations on a more ration
al basis.
Students suggest that deci
sions in the University be made
on the basis of the truth of the
situation. In a university, people
are admitted to the decision
making processes to the extent
that they participate in the
communal engagement of intel
lect over a particular problem.
Thus, students should be ad
mitted to decision-making not on
the basis that they are a consti
tuency but to the extent that
they use their minds.
Stanford enters this year a
community of fear. Students
mistrust the administration. And
the administration, because the
balance of power has shifted in
favor of students, is fearful of
student power.
It might be helpful for each
side to remember a few things.
The administration should rea
lize that, however monumental
the barriers now, a start toward
a detente has been made in stu
dent conceptions like those of
authority and education.
And student leaders might re
member that a new obligation
of self-criticality has been placed
on them by virtue of the fact
that they have , in some ways,
the upper hand over the admini
stration.
This self-examination might
begin with the question of
whether use of pressure tactics
results in loss of sight of the
goal: the creation of an aca
demic community, in which
truth is the final authority and
in which engagement of the in
tellect over a subject is the pro
cess of finding truth .
Stanford is a community of
fear.
Instead of moving closer to
being "a community of scho
lars," we are moving away from
it. Student - administration ref
lations are more strained now
than before. Lines of communi
cations have been established,
with the result that conflicts
which were assumed to exist be
fore are now seen openly. And
neither side trusts the other.
Mope, important, however,

are now being admitted and

Mope, important, however,
than the fact that differences
are now being admitted and
faced, is the fact that the bal
ance of power has shifted from
the administration to the stu
dents.
In the past, so few students
were iinvolved in activist causes
that, In the words of one ob
server, "The administration
could divide and conquer." That
era had ended. "If a majority is
being isolated and treated un
justly, a substantial segment of
the community will rise in their
defense," the same observer
notes.
More significantly, however,
a substantial segment of the
student community is now be
ginning to think about Itself:
how it is treated, what kind of
education it receives, how the
university's involvement in so
ciety alTects it.
Dissatisfaction
Much of the blame or praise
for this 6hift has been attri
buted to student-body president
David Harris. Harris based his
campaign last spring on dissatis
faction with the existing struc
ture and on a pledge to work for
educational reform.
Harris got more votes than
anyone ever has in a Stanford
election, and, for the first time,
a "substantial segment" of the
student body publicly protested
the status quo, and, some feel,
the people responsible for it.
Harris himself feels his elec
tion is "an expression of student
statement of dissatisfaction with
the type of education given here,
and the student's role in it."
Dave Harris' election, how
ever, was not the only event of
spring quarter. A group of
thirty students expressed their
protest against the system by
staging a three-day sit-in at the
President's Office on the issues
of the University's administer
ing draft deferment tests and
student p.irtlcipation in decision
making.
Etold Steps
Students were active on sev
eral other fronts as well. The
University's liquor policy was
changed 1o admit the existence
of alcohol on campus (a move
characteriwd by some as "a
bold step into the 1930'5"). The
University's long-standing pro
hibition on sectarian worship

was being lifted ("a bold step in
to the twentieth century"). The
Legislature challenged the ad
ministration by making student
law on dorm visiting hours con
flict with the University hours
("a bold step by the Legisla
ture").
By the end of spring quarter,
one student leader could note
with a fair amount of truth:
"The deans are punchy. For the
first time in history, the admini
stration, not the students, will
use the summer to rest up."
The significance of last spring
quarter was that, in the never
ending battle between students
and administration, the students
gained the upper hand.
Students have the momentum
to bring educational change and
they have the numbers to back
up with force their stands and
goals. The administration, at
least to some, is running scared.
It is unfortunate that, in an
academic community, decisions
must be made on the basis of
force, but that seems to be the
real politlk of Stanford. Most
student leaders have concluded
that, in this struggle between
opposing power blocs, brinks
manship is the way to push
Stanford over the edge of great
ness.
Self-Critical
In any situation where one
person or group is exercising
power, there is a special obliga
tion placed on him to be continu
ally self-critical to make sure he
is not abusing the power.
Lack of this self-evaluation
has been a recurrent student
criticism of the Stanford admini
stration over the last half dec
ade, but its force has been re
versed: students are now the
ones upon whom the greatest
burden for self-examination lies.
It is the activists who now have
to examine their motives and
the actions to determine how
pure the motive and how con
gruent the motive and the act.
The latter Is perhaps the
greatest danger: that students
use whatever means available to
gain immediate ends and there
by lose sight of long-range goals,
the main one being the creation
of a community of scholars.
When students first began ar
ticulating their ideas, asking
questions, and demanding ans
wers and actions, they met
with obduracy. They reacted by
using force of their own. Such
tactics have met with success,
but their use tends to postpone
the creation of a community of
scholars rather than to encour
age it.
Among the values usually
posited for an academic commu
nity are the use of truth as the
final authority in decision-mak
ing, and a commitment to an
environment in which rational
processes can be employed.
The pressure tactics used by
some student leaders in recent

years, although necessary to ac
complish specific ends, seem to
imply an abdication of the high
er values toward which students
are working.
Basic Problem
These students, however, have
not been driven to this position
easily. The basic problem, on
both sides, is lack of trust.
Students have become embit
tered because of the administra
tion's actions and attitudes; and
the administration has frequent
ly been disappointed at student
failures. There seems to be a
temporary stalemate; each side
mistrusts the other and each is
reluctant to strike the first
blow.
The current attitude toward
the administration has at least
three principal causes, (apart
from dishonesty, frequently ru
mored and sometimes document
ed to be an administrative tac
tic).
The first is administrative
paternalism. Paternalism is
characterized by over-protective
ness. It is the attitude that "we
know your best interest better
than you do."
There are at least two factors
to this situation which are of

A student-activist during his undergraduate career at Stanford,
Bruce Campbell assesses the state of student-administration re
lations in the wake of Stanford's first year of intense student
activism. Campbell, who graduated in June, concludes from his
own experiences that both students and administrators must
maintain a spirit of self-criticality.

importance. The first is that in
some instances some students
need protection, either from au
thorities or from themselves. In
these cases, the University ad
ministration very validly serves
in loco parentis.
The fact that in some in
stances the administration prop
erly serves in this role has less
ened the impact of 6tudent de
mands for an end to paternalism
in areas in which students feel
authority is unneeded as well as
unwanted. Thus student de
mands, usually absolute (for ex
ample, no women's hours at all),
have been partly ignored be
cause of the administration's fo
cusing on what students feel are
exceptional cases rather than
the norm.
Paternalism
But It was a long time before
students could even get their
grievances heard, much less
partially acted upon, because of
the second factor in paternal
ism: it is self-fulfilling and self
perpetuating.
If one believes that young
people, because of their lack of
experience, have nothing to con
tribute to the solution of a prob
lem, the person will not pay at
tention to them and his judg
ment will be self-fulfilling.
In a similar manner, if he
never listens to students, they
will never have anything to say
to him and the system will be
self-perpetuating.
It is on this basis that stu
dents justify the original use of
force in dealing with the admini
stration: the administration was
n't listening and it was neces
sary "to blast out some dead
wood" in order that dialogue
could begin.
Whether students have be
come so committed to the use
of force that they have lost
sight of the fact that their tac
tics may, in fact, be an abdica
tion of their goals is another
question.
The second cause of student
mistrust of the administration
is administrative mentality. This
Is an outlook pre occupied with
the smooth functioning of the
system. It puts the premium on
efficiency and peace and quiet;
in other words, the means be
come an end.
Bureaucrats
What is lost when greatest at
tention is given to means is a
focus on people. This mentality
shows itself in small ways, such
as by the bureaucrats who, in
the words of one administrator,
'fceem to get their greatest joy

from making students jump."
But it also appears in more
significant ways. Frequently,
student leaders complain, deci
sions are made arbitrarily and
then never explained, although
students seek an explanation.
The third factor which has
produced student bitterness iB
the administration's overcon
cern with triviality. Administra
tors seem to students to be bog
ged down in the day-to-day rou
tine of paperwork. Such great
focus is given to this, students
say, that the University admini
stration refuses to discuss basic
questions such as what is a uni
versity?, or even, what is Stan
ford?
No Direction
This situation has two impor
tant consequences. The first is
on the manner in which issues
are resolved. Students are per
sistent and, as much as the ad
ministration would sometimes
like to ignore them, they can
eventually raise an issue to a
head.
The result is that a solution i6
reached in a crisis situation
where the deciding factors are
frequently not the merits of the
issue but merely the expediences

of a polititical situation. Were
the administration to begin dis
cission before an issue became
a "matter of principle," deci
sions could be made on a more
reasonable basis.
More importantly, students
wonder whether this attention
to daily detail means that Stan
ford has no sense of direction or
purpose. Former student-body
president Bud Wedin wrote last
spring: "unlike Faustus who
sold his soul to the devil for
more honorable reasons, Stan
ford has aligned itself with the
biases and norms of the techno
logical society for want of any
soul at all."
Stanford is growing rapidly,
but no one but students, they
feel, has stopped to ask where?,
at what cost?, to what end?.
Stanford's greatest problem
is its poor sense of relativity.
An institution can measure it
self in relation to several things.
First, it can compare its present
performance and accomplish
ments to those it made in the
past.
Second, it can measure itself
against other similar institu
tions. And third, it can compare
itself to an ideal of where it
would like to go.
Stanford is now in a transition
stage from the first type of rela
tivity to the second. The first is
lingering strong because the Un
versity is run by people who at
tended Stanford before the war.
Twenty of twenty-two trustees
are Stanford alumni, as are
most of the higher members of
the administration.
Stanford is in transition, how
ever, and programs are fre
quently adopted because Har
vard, or Pomona had them ten
years ago.
Dialogue
The two things which are
missing in the Stanford admini
stration, students feel, are self
criticality and a goal. Too much
effort is spent in defense of the
current system and, although
students are now listened to, no
dialogue about the current struc
ture is yet possible.
"Real disagreement is now
impossible," one former student
leader states. "The joint inquiry
we desire requires the question
ing of assumptions. The admini
stration is as yet unwilling to do
this."
In addition, they hope that
once the debate is begun, the
whole University community
will enter it, so that the admini
stration will eventually have to
discuss the University's pur
poses.

In an academic community,
these students feel, final author
ity (that which commands great
est allegiance) is truth. All other
authorities are subservient to
truth and gain their legitimacy
in relation to this primary au
thority.
One Facet
The authority vested in the
board of trustees, then, is for ad
ministrative matters and the
board is only thought to be the
final authority because "the ad
ministration and the trustees
tend to think of education as
one facet of administration,
rather than vice versa, as it
should be," as one observer
.states.
What students are calling foi
ls "authority which is related
to education."
When students speak of edu
cation, the two key words they
use are "development" and "par
ticipation." They consider edu
cation to go beyond the class
room and to include the matura
tion of the whole person, with
an emphasis, however, on the
development of the intellect.
Three factors are crucial for
the developing of the mind.
First, students expect the Uni
versity to give them the tools
of scholarship. Assuming stu
dents already have the basic
tools such as math and langu
age, this means principally
teaching how to approach a
body of knowledge: what are
the relevant questions to ask?
These tools include habits of
thinking and techniques for ex
tracting knowledge and prin
ciples.
The second factor is curio
sity: the desire to continue to
use these tools for a lifetime
And third is the critical sense.
A person must never become
satisfied either with the world,
nor with his understanding of
it. He must continually question
both the institutions and prac
tices of society, and his own
complacency.
Dry Learning
Students feel that participa
tion in the learning process is
crucial to the development of
the mind, because without it
learning is dry. If a person is
studying by engaging himself
over the subject matter, he wiP
get caught up in the subject
and in the process with the re
sult that a life-long habit of
self-initiating inquiry begins.
These conceptions of author
ity and education can be applied
profitably to student-adminLstra
tion relations and might form a
beginning of a reconstruction of
those relations on a more ration
al basis.
Students suggest that deci
sions in the University be made
on the basis of the truth of the
situation. In a university, people
are admitted to the decision
making processes to the extent
that they participate in the
communal engagement of intel
lect over a particular problem.
Thus, students should be ad
mitted to decision-making not on
the basis that they are a consti
tuency but to the extent that
they use their minds.
Stanford enters this year a
community of fear. Students
mistrust the administration. And
the administration, because the
balance of power has shifted in
favor of students, is fearful of
student power.
It might be helpful for each
side to remember a few things.
The administration should rea
lize that, however monumental
the barriers now, a start toward
a detente has been made in stu
dent conceptions like those of
authority and education.
And student leaders might re
member that a new obligation
of self-criticality has been placed
on them by virtue of the fact
that they have , in some ways,
the upper hand over the admini
stration.
This self-examination might
begin with the question of
whether use of pressure tactics
results in loss of sight of the
goal: the creation of an aca
demic community, in which
truth is the final authority and
in which engagement of the in
tellect over a subject is the pro
cess of finding truth .
Stanford is a community of
fear.
Instead of moving closer to
being "a community of scho
lars," we are moving away from
it. Student - administration ref
lations are more strained now
than before. Lines of communi
cations have been established,
with the result that conflicts
which were assumed to exist be
fore are now seen openly. And
neither side trusts the other.
Mope, important, however,

are now being admitted and

are now being admitted and
faced, is the fact that the bal
ance of power has shifted from
the administration to the stu
dents.
In the past, so few students
were iinvolved in activist causes
that, In the words of one ob
server, "The administration
could divide and conquer." That
era had ended. "If a majority is
being isolated and treated un
justly, a substantial segment of
the community will rise in their
defense," the same observer
notes.
More significantly, however,
a substantial segment of the
student community is now be
ginning to think about Itself:
how it is treated, what kind of
education it receives, how the
university's involvement in so
ciety alTects it.
Dissatisfaction
Much of the blame or praise
for this 6hift has been attri
buted to student-body president
David Harris. Harris based his
campaign last spring on dissatis
faction with the existing struc
ture and on a pledge to work for
educational reform.
Harris got more votes than
anyone ever has in a Stanford
election, and, for the first time,
a "substantial segment" of the
student body publicly protested
the status quo, and, some feel,
the people responsible for it.
Harris himself feels his elec
tion is "an expression of student
statement of dissatisfaction with
the type of education given here,
and the student's role in it."
Dave Harris' election, how
ever, was not the only event of
spring quarter. A group of
thirty students expressed their
protest against the system by
staging a three-day sit-in at the
President's Office on the issues
of the University's administer
ing draft deferment tests and
student p.irtlcipation in decision
making.
Etold Steps
Students were active on sev
eral other fronts as well. The
University's liquor policy was
changed 1o admit the existence
of alcohol on campus (a move
characteriwd by some as "a
bold step into the 1930'5"). The
University's long-standing pro
hibition on sectarian worship

was being lifted ("a bold step in
to the twentieth century"). The
Legislature challenged the ad
ministration by making student
law on dorm visiting hours con
flict with the University hours
("a bold step by the Legisla
ture").
By the end of spring quarter,
one student leader could note
with a fair amount of truth:
"The deans are punchy. For the
first time in history, the admini
stration, not the students, will
use the summer to rest up."
The significance of last spring
quarter was that, in the never
ending battle between students
and administration, the students
gained the upper hand.
Students have the momentum
to bring educational change and
they have the numbers to back
up with force their stands and
goals. The administration, at
least to some, is running scared.
It is unfortunate that, in an
academic community, decisions
must be made on the basis of
force, but that seems to be the
real politlk of Stanford. Most
student leaders have concluded
that, in this struggle between
opposing power blocs, brinks
manship is the way to push
Stanford over the edge of great
ness.
Self-Critical
In any situation where one
person or group is exercising
power, there is a special obliga
tion placed on him to be continu
ally self-critical to make sure he
is not abusing the power.
Lack of this self-evaluation
has been a recurrent student
criticism of the Stanford admini
stration over the last half dec
ade, but its force has been re
versed: students are now the
ones upon whom the greatest
burden for self-examination lies.
It is the activists who now have
to examine their motives and
the actions to determine how
pure the motive and how con
gruent the motive and the act.
The latter Is perhaps the
greatest danger: that students
use whatever means available to
gain immediate ends and there
by lose sight of long-range goals,
the main one being the creation
of a community of scholars.
When students first began ar
ticulating their ideas, asking
questions, and demanding ans
wers and actions, they met
with obduracy. They reacted by
using force of their own. Such
tactics have met with success,
but their use tends to postpone
the creation of a community of
scholars rather than to encour
age it.
Among the values usually
posited for an academic commu
nity are the use of truth as the
final authority in decision-mak
ing, and a commitment to an
environment in which rational
processes can be employed.
The pressure tactics used by
some student leaders in recent

years, although necessary to ac
complish specific ends, seem to
imply an abdication of the high
er values toward which students
are working.
Basic Problem
These students, however, have
not been driven to this position
easily. The basic problem, on
both sides, is lack of trust.
Students have become embit
tered because of the administra
tion's actions and attitudes; and
the administration has frequent
ly been disappointed at student
failures. There seems to be a
temporary stalemate; each side
mistrusts the other and each is
reluctant to strike the first
blow.
The current attitude toward
the administration has at least
three principal causes, (apart
from dishonesty, frequently ru
mored and sometimes document
ed to be an administrative tac
tic).
The first is administrative
paternalism. Paternalism is
characterized by over-protective
ness. It is the attitude that "we
know your best interest better
than you do."
There are at least two factors
to this situation which are of

A student-activist during his undergraduate career at Stanford,
Bruce Campbell assesses the state of student-administration re
lations in the wake of Stanford's first year of intense student
activism. Campbell, who graduated in June, concludes from his
own experiences that both students and administrators must
maintain a spirit of self-criticality.

importance. The first is that in
some instances some students
need protection, either from au
thorities or from themselves. In
these cases, the University ad
ministration very validly serves
in loco parentis.
The fact that in some in
stances the administration prop
erly serves in this role has less
ened the impact of 6tudent de
mands for an end to paternalism
in areas in which students feel
authority is unneeded as well as
unwanted. Thus student de
mands, usually absolute (for ex
ample, no women's hours at all),
have been partly ignored be
cause of the administration's fo
cusing on what students feel are
exceptional cases rather than
the norm.
Paternalism
But It was a long time before
students could even get their
grievances heard, much less
partially acted upon, because of
the second factor in paternal
ism: it is self-fulfilling and self
perpetuating.
If one believes that young
people, because of their lack of
experience, have nothing to con
tribute to the solution of a prob
lem, the person will not pay at
tention to them and his judg
ment will be self-fulfilling.
In a similar manner, if he
never listens to students, they
will never have anything to say
to him and the system will be
self-perpetuating.
It is on this basis that stu
dents justify the original use of
force in dealing with the admini
stration: the administration was
n't listening and it was neces
sary "to blast out some dead
wood" in order that dialogue
could begin.
Whether students have be
come so committed to the use
of force that they have lost
sight of the fact that their tac
tics may, in fact, be an abdica
tion of their goals is another
question.
The second cause of student
mistrust of the administration
is administrative mentality. This
Is an outlook pre occupied with
the smooth functioning of the
system. It puts the premium on
efficiency and peace and quiet;
in other words, the means be
come an end.
Bureaucrats
What is lost when greatest at
tention is given to means is a
focus on people. This mentality
shows itself in small ways, such
as by the bureaucrats who, in
the words of one administrator,
'fceem to get their greatest joy

from making students jump."
But it also appears in more
significant ways. Frequently,
student leaders complain, deci
sions are made arbitrarily and
then never explained, although
students seek an explanation.
The third factor which has
produced student bitterness iB
the administration's overcon
cern with triviality. Administra
tors seem to students to be bog
ged down in the day-to-day rou
tine of paperwork. Such great
focus is given to this, students
say, that the University admini
stration refuses to discuss basic
questions such as what is a uni
versity?, or even, what is Stan
ford?
No Direction
This situation has two impor
tant consequences. The first is
on the manner in which issues
are resolved. Students are per
sistent and, as much as the ad
ministration would sometimes
like to ignore them, they can
eventually raise an issue to a
head.
The result is that a solution i6
reached in a crisis situation
where the deciding factors are
frequently not the merits of the
issue but merely the expediences

of a polititical situation. Were
the administration to begin dis
cission before an issue became
a "matter of principle," deci
sions could be made on a more
reasonable basis.
More importantly, students
wonder whether this attention
to daily detail means that Stan
ford has no sense of direction or
purpose. Former student-body
president Bud Wedin wrote last
spring: "unlike Faustus who
sold his soul to the devil for
more honorable reasons, Stan
ford has aligned itself with the
biases and norms of the techno
logical society for want of any
soul at all."
Stanford is growing rapidly,
but no one but students, they
feel, has stopped to ask where?,
at what cost?, to what end?.
Stanford's greatest problem
is its poor sense of relativity.
An institution can measure it
self in relation to several things.
First, it can compare its present
performance and accomplish
ments to those it made in the
past.
Second, it can measure itself
against other similar institu
tions. And third, it can compare
itself to an ideal of where it
would like to go.
Stanford is now in a transition
stage from the first type of rela
tivity to the second. The first is
lingering strong because the Un
versity is run by people who at
tended Stanford before the war.
Twenty of twenty-two trustees
are Stanford alumni, as are
most of the higher members of
the administration.
Stanford is in transition, how
ever, and programs are fre
quently adopted because Har
vard, or Pomona had them ten
years ago.
Dialogue
The two things which are
missing in the Stanford admini
stration, students feel, are self
criticality and a goal. Too much
effort is spent in defense of the
current system and, although
students are now listened to, no
dialogue about the current struc
ture is yet possible.
"Real disagreement is now
impossible," one former student
leader states. "The joint inquiry
we desire requires the question
ing of assumptions. The admini
stration is as yet unwilling to do
this."
In addition, they hope that
once the debate is begun, the
whole University community
will enter it, so that the admini
stration will eventually have to
discuss the University's pur
poses.

In an academic community,
these students feel, final author
ity (that which commands great
est allegiance) is truth. All other
authorities are subservient to
truth and gain their legitimacy
in relation to this primary au
thority.
One Facet
The authority vested in the
board of trustees, then, is for ad
ministrative matters and the
board is only thought to be the
final authority because "the ad
ministration and the trustees
tend to think of education as
one facet of administration,
rather than vice versa, as it
should be," as one observer
.states.
What students are calling foi
ls "authority which is related
to education."
When students speak of edu
cation, the two key words they
use are "development" and "par
ticipation." They consider edu
cation to go beyond the class
room and to include the matura
tion of the whole person, with
an emphasis, however, on the
development of the intellect.
Three factors are crucial for
the developing of the mind.
First, students expect the Uni
versity to give them the tools
of scholarship. Assuming stu
dents already have the basic
tools such as math and langu
age, this means principally
teaching how to approach a
body of knowledge: what are
the relevant questions to ask?
These tools include habits of
thinking and techniques for ex
tracting knowledge and prin
ciples.
The second factor is curio
sity: the desire to continue to
use these tools for a lifetime
And third is the critical sense.
A person must never become
satisfied either with the world,
nor with his understanding of
it. He must continually question
both the institutions and prac
tices of society, and his own
complacency.
Dry Learning
Students feel that participa
tion in the learning process is
crucial to the development of
the mind, because without it
learning is dry. If a person is
studying by engaging himself
over the subject matter, he wiP
get caught up in the subject
and in the process with the re
sult that a life-long habit of
self-initiating inquiry begins.
These conceptions of author
ity and education can be applied
profitably to student-adminLstra
tion relations and might form a
beginning of a reconstruction of
those relations on a more ration
al basis.
Students suggest that deci
sions in the University be made
on the basis of the truth of the
situation. In a university, people
are admitted to the decision
making processes to the extent
that they participate in the
communal engagement of intel
lect over a particular problem.
Thus, students should be ad
mitted to decision-making not on
the basis that they are a consti
tuency but to the extent that
they use their minds.
Stanford enters this year a
community of fear. Students
mistrust the administration. And
the administration, because the
balance of power has shifted in
favor of students, is fearful of
student power.
It might be helpful for each
side to remember a few things.
The administration should rea
lize that, however monumental
the barriers now, a start toward
a detente has been made in stu
dent conceptions like those of
authority and education.
And student leaders might re
member that a new obligation
of self-criticality has been placed
on them by virtue of the fact
that they have , in some ways,
the upper hand over the admini
stration.
This self-examination might
begin with the question of
whether use of pressure tactics
results in loss of sight of the
goal: the creation of an aca
demic community, in which
truth is the final authority and
in which engagement of the in
tellect over a subject is the pro
cess of finding truth .
Stanford is a community of
fear.
Instead of moving closer to
being "a community of scho
lars," we are moving away from
it. Student - administration ref
lations are more strained now
than before. Lines of communi
cations have been established,
with the result that conflicts
which were assumed to exist be
fore are now seen openly. And
neither side trusts the other.
Mope, important, however,

are now being admitted and

ance of power has shifted from
the administration to the stu
dents.
In the past, so few students
were iinvolved in activist causes
that, In the words of one ob
server, "The administration
could divide and conquer." That
era had ended. "If a majority is
being isolated and treated un
justly, a substantial segment of
the community will rise in their
defense," the same observer
notes.
More significantly, however,
a substantial segment of the
student community is now be
ginning to think about Itself:
how it is treated, what kind of
education it receives, how the
university's involvement in so
ciety alTects it.
Dissatisfaction
Much of the blame or praise
for this 6hift has been attri
buted to student-body president
David Harris. Harris based his
campaign last spring on dissatis
faction with the existing struc
ture and on a pledge to work for
educational reform.
Harris got more votes than
anyone ever has in a Stanford
election, and, for the first time,
a "substantial segment" of the
student body publicly protested
the status quo, and, some feel,
the people responsible for it.
Harris himself feels his elec
tion is "an expression of student
statement of dissatisfaction with
the type of education given here,
and the student's role in it."
Dave Harris' election, how
ever, was not the only event of
spring quarter. A group of
thirty students expressed their
protest against the system by
staging a three-day sit-in at the
President's Office on the issues
of the University's administer
ing draft deferment tests and
student p.irtlcipation in decision
making.
Etold Steps
Students were active on sev
eral other fronts as well. The
University's liquor policy was
changed 1o admit the existence
of alcohol on campus (a move
characteriwd by some as "a
bold step into the 1930'5"). The
University's long-standing pro
hibition on sectarian worship

was being lifted ("a bold step in
to the twentieth century"). The
Legislature challenged the ad
ministration by making student
law on dorm visiting hours con
flict with the University hours
("a bold step by the Legisla
ture").
By the end of spring quarter,
one student leader could note
with a fair amount of truth:
"The deans are punchy. For the
first time in history, the admini
stration, not the students, will
use the summer to rest up."
The significance of last spring
quarter was that, in the never
ending battle between students
and administration, the students
gained the upper hand.
Students have the momentum
to bring educational change and
they have the numbers to back
up with force their stands and
goals. The administration, at
least to some, is running scared.
It is unfortunate that, in an
academic community, decisions
must be made on the basis of
force, but that seems to be the
real politlk of Stanford. Most
student leaders have concluded
that, in this struggle between
opposing power blocs, brinks
manship is the way to push
Stanford over the edge of great
ness.
Self-Critical
In any situation where one
person or group is exercising
power, there is a special obliga
tion placed on him to be continu
ally self-critical to make sure he
is not abusing the power.
Lack of this self-evaluation
has been a recurrent student
criticism of the Stanford admini
stration over the last half dec
ade, but its force has been re
versed: students are now the
ones upon whom the greatest
burden for self-examination lies.
It is the activists who now have
to examine their motives and
the actions to determine how
pure the motive and how con
gruent the motive and the act.
The latter Is perhaps the
greatest danger: that students
use whatever means available to
gain immediate ends and there
by lose sight of long-range goals,
the main one being the creation
of a community of scholars.
When students first began ar
ticulating their ideas, asking
questions, and demanding ans
wers and actions, they met
with obduracy. They reacted by
using force of their own. Such
tactics have met with success,
but their use tends to postpone
the creation of a community of
scholars rather than to encour
age it.
Among the values usually
posited for an academic commu
nity are the use of truth as the
final authority in decision-mak
ing, and a commitment to an
environment in which rational
processes can be employed.
The pressure tactics used by
some student leaders in recent

years, although necessary to ac
complish specific ends, seem to
imply an abdication of the high
er values toward which students
are working.
Basic Problem
These students, however, have
not been driven to this position
easily. The basic problem, on
both sides, is lack of trust.
Students have become embit
tered because of the administra
tion's actions and attitudes; and
the administration has frequent
ly been disappointed at student
failures. There seems to be a
temporary stalemate; each side
mistrusts the other and each is
reluctant to strike the first
blow.
The current attitude toward
the administration has at least
three principal causes, (apart
from dishonesty, frequently ru
mored and sometimes document
ed to be an administrative tac
tic).
The first is administrative
paternalism. Paternalism is
characterized by over-protective
ness. It is the attitude that "we
know your best interest better
than you do."
There are at least two factors
to this situation which are of

A student-activist during his undergraduate career at Stanford,
Bruce Campbell assesses the state of student-administration re
lations in the wake of Stanford's first year of intense student
activism. Campbell, who graduated in June, concludes from his
own experiences that both students and administrators must
maintain a spirit of self-criticality.

importance. The first is that in
some instances some students
need protection, either from au
thorities or from themselves. In
these cases, the University ad
ministration very validly serves
in loco parentis.
The fact that in some in
stances the administration prop
erly serves in this role has less
ened the impact of 6tudent de
mands for an end to paternalism
in areas in which students feel
authority is unneeded as well as
unwanted. Thus student de
mands, usually absolute (for ex
ample, no women's hours at all),
have been partly ignored be
cause of the administration's fo
cusing on what students feel are
exceptional cases rather than
the norm.
Paternalism
But It was a long time before
students could even get their
grievances heard, much less
partially acted upon, because of
the second factor in paternal
ism: it is self-fulfilling and self
perpetuating.
If one believes that young
people, because of their lack of
experience, have nothing to con
tribute to the solution of a prob
lem, the person will not pay at
tention to them and his judg
ment will be self-fulfilling.
In a similar manner, if he
never listens to students, they
will never have anything to say
to him and the system will be
self-perpetuating.
It is on this basis that stu
dents justify the original use of
force in dealing with the admini
stration: the administration was
n't listening and it was neces
sary "to blast out some dead
wood" in order that dialogue
could begin.
Whether students have be
come so committed to the use
of force that they have lost
sight of the fact that their tac
tics may, in fact, be an abdica
tion of their goals is another
question.
The second cause of student
mistrust of the administration
is administrative mentality. This
Is an outlook pre occupied with
the smooth functioning of the
system. It puts the premium on
efficiency and peace and quiet;
in other words, the means be
come an end.
Bureaucrats
What is lost when greatest at
tention is given to means is a
focus on people. This mentality
shows itself in small ways, such
as by the bureaucrats who, in
the words of one administrator,
'fceem to get their greatest joy

from making students jump."
But it also appears in more
significant ways. Frequently,
student leaders complain, deci
sions are made arbitrarily and
then never explained, although
students seek an explanation.
The third factor which has
produced student bitterness iB
the administration's overcon
cern with triviality. Administra
tors seem to students to be bog
ged down in the day-to-day rou
tine of paperwork. Such great
focus is given to this, students
say, that the University admini
stration refuses to discuss basic
questions such as what is a uni
versity?, or even, what is Stan
ford?
No Direction
This situation has two impor
tant consequences. The first is
on the manner in which issues
are resolved. Students are per
sistent and, as much as the ad
ministration would sometimes
like to ignore them, they can
eventually raise an issue to a
head.
The result is that a solution i6
reached in a crisis situation
where the deciding factors are
frequently not the merits of the
issue but merely the expediences

of a polititical situation. Were
the administration to begin dis
cission before an issue became
a "matter of principle," deci
sions could be made on a more
reasonable basis.
More importantly, students
wonder whether this attention
to daily detail means that Stan
ford has no sense of direction or
purpose. Former student-body
president Bud Wedin wrote last
spring: "unlike Faustus who
sold his soul to the devil for
more honorable reasons, Stan
ford has aligned itself with the
biases and norms of the techno
logical society for want of any
soul at all."
Stanford is growing rapidly,
but no one but students, they
feel, has stopped to ask where?,
at what cost?, to what end?.
Stanford's greatest problem
is its poor sense of relativity.
An institution can measure it
self in relation to several things.
First, it can compare its present
performance and accomplish
ments to those it made in the
past.
Second, it can measure itself
against other similar institu
tions. And third, it can compare
itself to an ideal of where it
would like to go.
Stanford is now in a transition
stage from the first type of rela
tivity to the second. The first is
lingering strong because the Un
versity is run by people who at
tended Stanford before the war.
Twenty of twenty-two trustees
are Stanford alumni, as are
most of the higher members of
the administration.
Stanford is in transition, how
ever, and programs are fre
quently adopted because Har
vard, or Pomona had them ten
years ago.
Dialogue
The two things which are
missing in the Stanford admini
stration, students feel, are self
criticality and a goal. Too much
effort is spent in defense of the
current system and, although
students are now listened to, no
dialogue about the current struc
ture is yet possible.
"Real disagreement is now
impossible," one former student
leader states. "The joint inquiry
we desire requires the question
ing of assumptions. The admini
stration is as yet unwilling to do
this."
In addition, they hope that
once the debate is begun, the
whole University community
will enter it, so that the admini
stration will eventually have to
discuss the University's pur
poses.

In an academic community,
these students feel, final author
ity (that which commands great
est allegiance) is truth. All other
authorities are subservient to
truth and gain their legitimacy
in relation to this primary au
thority.
One Facet
The authority vested in the
board of trustees, then, is for ad
ministrative matters and the
board is only thought to be the
final authority because "the ad
ministration and the trustees
tend to think of education as
one facet of administration,
rather than vice versa, as it
should be," as one observer
.states.
What students are calling foi
ls "authority which is related
to education."
When students speak of edu
cation, the two key words they
use are "development" and "par
ticipation." They consider edu
cation to go beyond the class
room and to include the matura
tion of the whole person, with
an emphasis, however, on the
development of the intellect.
Three factors are crucial for
the developing of the mind.
First, students expect the Uni
versity to give them the tools
of scholarship. Assuming stu
dents already have the basic
tools such as math and langu
age, this means principally
teaching how to approach a
body of knowledge: what are
the relevant questions to ask?
These tools include habits of
thinking and techniques for ex
tracting knowledge and prin
ciples.
The second factor is curio
sity: the desire to continue to
use these tools for a lifetime
And third is the critical sense.
A person must never become
satisfied either with the world,
nor with his understanding of
it. He must continually question
both the institutions and prac
tices of society, and his own
complacency.
Dry Learning
Students feel that participa
tion in the learning process is
crucial to the development of
the mind, because without it
learning is dry. If a person is
studying by engaging himself
over the subject matter, he wiP
get caught up in the subject
and in the process with the re
sult that a life-long habit of
self-initiating inquiry begins.
These conceptions of author
ity and education can be applied
profitably to student-adminLstra
tion relations and might form a
beginning of a reconstruction of
those relations on a more ration
al basis.
Students suggest that deci
sions in the University be made
on the basis of the truth of the
situation. In a university, people
are admitted to the decision
making processes to the extent
that they participate in the
communal engagement of intel
lect over a particular problem.
Thus, students should be ad
mitted to decision-making not on
the basis that they are a consti
tuency but to the extent that
they use their minds.
Stanford enters this year a
community of fear. Students
mistrust the administration. And
the administration, because the
balance of power has shifted in
favor of students, is fearful of
student power.
It might be helpful for each
side to remember a few things.
The administration should rea
lize that, however monumental
the barriers now, a start toward
a detente has been made in stu
dent conceptions like those of
authority and education.
And student leaders might re
member that a new obligation
of self-criticality has been placed
on them by virtue of the fact
that they have , in some ways,
the upper hand over the admini
stration.
This self-examination might
begin with the question of
whether use of pressure tactics
results in loss of sight of the
goal: the creation of an aca
demic community, in which
truth is the final authority and
in which engagement of the in
tellect over a subject is the pro
cess of finding truth .
Stanford is a community of
fear.
Instead of moving closer to
being "a community of scho
lars," we are moving away from
it. Student - administration ref
lations are more strained now
than before. Lines of communi
cations have been established,
with the result that conflicts
which were assumed to exist be
fore are now seen openly. And
neither side trusts the other.
Mope, important, however,
than the fact that differences
are now being admitted and
faced, is the fact that the bal
ance of power has shifted from
the administration to the stu
dents.
In the past, so few students
were iinvolved in activist causes
that, In the words of one ob
server, "The administration
could divide and conquer." That

justly, a substantial segment of
