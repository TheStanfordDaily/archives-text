## Student Hits Walker's 'Wave' Theory 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
When I read that Dr, Walker
has put the blame for the Aus
tria II uprising directly upon
the student leaders who "were
hostile to the purposes of the
Overseas program," I felt forced
to question the validity of Dr.
Walker's Overseas purposes.
From his quotes in The Dally
and past contact (as a member
of Britain I), I have inferred
that an ideal set-up in Walker's
eyes would be a group that
"jelled" into a perfectly content
and docile pack that lived to
gether, worked together, and
played together never running
counter to official policy and
never "making waves" that
could reflect on the good repu
tation of Stanford University. I
put "making waves" in quota
tions because those are the exact
words he used in one of his Bri
tain I orientation talks. Implicit
in Walker's philosophy is the
idea that the European experi
ence is more valuable as an ex
periment in group living than as
a chance to see and learn from
a culture different from our
own. I found it hard to believe
that he actually criticized stu
dents that "remain individual
ists."
To me, the idea is not that the
student should spend his time
chastizing himself because he
can't make friends with every
one in the group, but that he
should adopt an attitude of "to
each his own" toward his fel
low students, and pursue the
most interesting task of educa
tion that mere presence in a
foreign country makes a full
time job.
In Britain we were not a
"jelled" group in Walker's
terms, but given a better living
arrangement, and, it would seem,
a more flexible administration,
and friendlier atmosphere, no
major problems developed. This
should not imply that all was
perfection. There were a good
many small irritations that could
have and should have been
worked out. However, in a visit
to the campus to hear com
plaints, Walker told us that we
should be happy just to be in
England and not be so "im
ifoature" as to complain about
food, heating, classes, etc.
I think Walker may be for
getting that students are not
exactly on an all-expense-paid
tour, and that they still have
rights as members of the Stan
ford student body to protest and
dissent when, in their opinion,
the status quo could be improved
upon. If this was acknowledged,
students who have attended a
foreign campus can contribute
to forging a better program for
the future and not be written off
as "complete nuisances."

• Absurd Myth
Editor, The Daily:
The Stanford woman of le
gend, independent, free • think
ing, carefree, is a myth; there
exist in reality only slaves to
that all pervading Presence,
the social calendar.
It is absurd that any girl
should have to refuse an aspir

ing male a date because she is
booked solid a week in advance.
The tragedy is played out on
both sides: a girl who still has
Saturday night open as of the
preceding Tuesday feels socially
left out: the male who makes
six calls to six booked-up tight
females on Monday gives up in
despair. As a result, he sees
Stanford women as inapproach
ables: she starts to panic about
her social virtues and, by the
time she's a senior, hungers
after a promise of social stabi
lity in marriage. Yet the early
booking system actually makes
It more difficult to form close
or spontaneous relationships:
the charming guy you met on
Wednesday won't see you again
for a week and a half because
you're temporarily undateable.
As a result of the unnatural
emphasis on weekend dates, it's
disgraceful for a girl to be seen
alone or with other girls in, say,
the Union (or the AS-SUCH) on
a Friday night: hence classes
become for many the only op
portunity to meet the opposite
sex. The total result is a stifling
impersonality in social relation
ships in general.
Be it therefore resolved: any
male who calls for a date more
than three days in advance shall
be called wimpy: furthermore,
any female who accepts such a
premature offer shall be deemed
insecure.
This system, given widespread
support, would eliminate much
of the pathological in Stanford
dating. 808 GULLIVER
• Rain Of Abuse
Editor, The Dally;
I was genuinely surprised by
the shower of abuse that rained
down on the Delts, and on the
frat community in general, in
the letters sections of recent
Dallies. Although I would cer
tainly agree that the cutting of
Dave Harris' hair was an irre
sponsible and useless act—and
one deserving of some kind of
reprobation—l think its is being
slightly overly righteous to

draw from a few pointless epi
sodes of poor conduct by indi
vidual the moral that Stanford
fraternities breed malevolence
and irresponsibility and are de
veloping into Stanford's own
Red Guard.
Pushing the point Just to plow
the fraternities seems, all in all,
to demonstrate a sorry lack of
humour and to show that the
critics may be as lacking in a
tolerant attitude as the criti
cized. 808 BROOKS
• Miserably Lacking
Editor, The Dally;
A brief answer to the easy
devastation of Twenty Years of
Stanford Stories. There are no
fictional topics permanently as
signed to the ash barrel, and to
condemn a collection because of
"banal subjects' is miserably in
complete. Does Merrill Gerber's
story really lapse into "tiny
drama," or does it succeed be
cause the characters are intro
duced and sketched at the
proper moment? The story, in
deed, focuses on a Jewish funer
al, but the author so well con
veys the specialness of her in
dividuals that the reader is
forced to yield his stock re
sponses.
Mr. Merry's review continu
ally makes this mistake of criti
cizing subjects rather than of
fering any enlightened com
ments on technical successes or
failures. Worse yet, he suggests
that if certain fresh topics
(adultery is one of his examples)
had been selected, then the
writers would have stood the

chance of reaching excellence.
This fallacy, I think, is largely
responsible for a gross fault in
student writing today: the auth
or, horrified by the thought of
melodrama, turns to grinding
out exotic sensationalist clap
trap, which has not a single
hope of winning the reader's in
terest or sympathy.
The plots of most great stories
and novels can be reduced to
dull- or sentimental-sounding
summaries: Crime and Punish
ment concerns a young mur
derer whose love for a golden
hearted prostitute grants him
reform; Ulysses wastes 800
pages on an uneventful Dublin
day. It is by writing short-order
critiques like these that Mr.
Merry forfeits his tone of au
thority. I hope that in further
reviews he will get down to busi
ness and start discussing such
essentials as characterization
and dramatic structure.

• Feelings Only
Editor, The Daily;
As a society and individuals
we hold a hierarchy of values;
and when the most important
of these is violated, it is time for
the gravest concern. I would
hope that respect for the individ

ual would be among the most
revered principles we hold.
Forcefully holding a person and
cutting his hair in no way indi
catetj a respect for that indi
vidual.
It is unfortunate that some
people believe that their feelings
justify any act they think of
doing. I might mention —I don't
like the President of ASSU look
ing like Gabby Hayes either.
Regardless of how I feel about
lung hair, the forceful cutting
of Harris' or anyone else's hair
must be condemned as disgrace
ful for those who did it. This
will never change—hopefully,
the people involved will.
Inferences might be drawn as
to what kind of atmosphere
would incubate individuals with
such intentions—however, these
inferences could be unwar
ranted. Regardless of where
they live or for what reasons
they did the act, the individuals
who cult Harris' hair must ac
cept responsibility for it. A per
sonal attack of a person's rights
merits a personal apology; so
If a man cut Harris' hair, he
should be able to walk up to him
and apologize. Only a person
without pride could do other
wise—or maybe only a person
without pride could have ever
done it. TOMI MacDONOUGH
