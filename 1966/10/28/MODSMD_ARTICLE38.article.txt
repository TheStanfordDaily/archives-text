The fraternity subcommittee of the ASSU
Housing Commission in many respects will play
a pivotal role in the overall Commission recom
mendations due in February. Nearly one third
of all upperclass men live in fraternities. Yet
the fraternities represent almost one half of the
undergraduate men living on campus.
It quickly becomes apparent that a study of
campus living cannot exclude fraternities, re
gardless of the politics involved. And further we
believe that any improvements in the Univer
sity residence system will go only a short way
toward creating a community if fraernities are
not incorporated in the changes. Whether inte
gration becomes complete, such as the Harvard
house system, or takes the form of increased
educational contact within the existing system,
fraternities are at the center of any change.
In light of this we are disturbed at the pres
ent disorder in the subcommittee. The body
was originally composed of fraternity and non
fraternity members with an official representa
tive from the Interfraternity Council. Efforts to
go beyond the fact-finding stage have been
hindered by concerns that the subcommittee
was assuming an anti-fraternity outlook. It

was precisely this concern that caused the IFC
representative to walk out of Wednesday's sub
committee meeting.
While the criterion of the subcommittee is
the same as that of other committees of the
Commission, how can a particular form of liv
ing best contribute to education, the fraternity
subcommittee does differ. For only the fra
ternity system represents an organized struc
ture that is not dependent upon the University
for the style of living it chooses to promote.
In the course of discussion the criterion of
education has become confused with the fra
ternity-antifraternity dimension in the minds of
both the defenders and attackers of the system.
Consequently the subcommittee no longer rep
resents a single consensus nor is it certain that
the subcommittee can, or wishes, to provide an
objective study. The alternative of pro-fratern
ity and anti-fraternity position papers can add
little to the Housing Commission's final report.
If the subcommittee fails to deal with the gap
between fraternity and anti-fraternity view
points, it will further polarize each viewpoint.
The subcommittee is charged with finding a
synthesis, not with perpetuating the debate.

Housing Commission in many respects will play
a pivotal role in the overall Commission recom
mendations due in February. Nearly one third
of all upperclass men live in fraternities. Yet
the fraternities represent almost one half of the
undergraduate men living on campus.
It quickly becomes apparent that a study of
campus living cannot exclude fraternities, re
gardless of the politics involved. And further we
believe that any improvements in the Univer
sity residence system will go only a short way
toward creating a community if fraernities are
not incorporated in the changes. Whether inte
gration becomes complete, such as the Harvard
house system, or takes the form of increased
educational contact within the existing system,
fraternities are at the center of any change.
In light of this we are disturbed at the pres
ent disorder in the subcommittee. The body
was originally composed of fraternity and non
fraternity members with an official representa
tive from the Interfraternity Council. Efforts to
go beyond the fact-finding stage have been
hindered by concerns that the subcommittee
was assuming an anti-fraternity outlook. It

was precisely this concern that caused the IFC
representative to walk out of Wednesday's sub
committee meeting.
While the criterion of the subcommittee is
the same as that of other committees of the
Commission, how can a particular form of liv
ing best contribute to education, the fraternity
subcommittee does differ. For only the fra
ternity system represents an organized struc
ture that is not dependent upon the University
for the style of living it chooses to promote.
In the course of discussion the criterion of
education has become confused with the fra
ternity-antifraternity dimension in the minds of
both the defenders and attackers of the system.
Consequently the subcommittee no longer rep
resents a single consensus nor is it certain that
the subcommittee can, or wishes, to provide an
objective study. The alternative of pro-fratern
ity and anti-fraternity position papers can add
little to the Housing Commission's final report.
If the subcommittee fails to deal with the gap
between fraternity and anti-fraternity view
points, it will further polarize each viewpoint.
The subcommittee is charged with finding a
synthesis, not with perpetuating the debate.
