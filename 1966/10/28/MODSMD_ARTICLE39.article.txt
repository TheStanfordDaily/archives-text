# Two Minutes of Haight
## Potpourri Of Ideas 
### Tim Haight 
If the student body is perhaps
tiring of talking about the Delts,
a coffee house, or open hours,
here are some ideas about edu
cation that might be worth some
conversation.
An ungraded freshman year—
would release the freshman
from competitive pressures for
grades, allow him to explore
fields of interest without worry
ing about his initial compen
tency, and let him budget his
time in a way that would follow
ideas, not requirements. Cal
Tech has just started on its
third ungraded freshman year.
Seniors as leaders of sections
- -Many large lecture courses of
fer no opportunities to discuss
the materials in sections. There
is riot enough money to pay
TA's. Outstanding undergradu
ates could lead such sections, re
ceiving units credit and valuable
teaching experience. A proto
type program is already under
way in the English department,
but more should be tried. See
your department.
An experimental college
which is directly integrated into
the University curriculum, per
haps a Stanford-In-Menlo Park
where 60 students and some pro
fessors and TA's live in a close
association for a year to parti
cipate in a unified curriculum.
Several professors, including
Lincoln Moses, have been active
in such proposals. Student sup
port is needed.
More independent study and
honors-like work for non-honors
students. It is Ironic that stu
dents are admitted to seminar
and Independent work situations
as a result of their performance

in introductory courses, most of
which are large lectures. Most
departments now have provi
sions for independent study, but
many professors are loath to
give it because of the demands
on their time.
The best way to get this
started is to organize a few stu
dents in your department and
get them to reexamine their
honors requirements. Another,
more direct way is to plan to
take some independent study
next quarter.
The science requirement has
become such a perennial prob
lem that it is like Mark Twain's
characterization of the weather
—"Everybody talks about it but
nobody does anything about it."
Things can be done. The formal
channel is the General Studies
Committee, but several of the
natural science departments,
Geology for one, are considering
experiments to liven up their
courses for the non-majors. The
teachers of those courses should
have feedback from those un
happy non-majors, or even the
happy ones.
The Faculty should sit on
LASSU. The spirit of coopera
tion should not extend in one
direction only. LASSU should in
vite the Academic Council to
send a mutually agreeable num
ber of faculty members to lend
their opinions to LASSU's de
liberations. The faculty mem
bers should be able to vote, too.
Innovation must be institu
tionalized. The Stanford system
of committees and administra
tive offices leaves no one speci
fically charged with finding and
exploring new ideas. Now this
task is left to students, it seems,
and an occasional dedicated pro

fessor. In this world of change,
there is no reason why some
money shouldn't be spent, on a
permanent basis, to seek out in
novation.
The quarter system is not flex
ible enough. Perhaps we need a
reading period before exams.
Or maybe exams should be de
emphasized and more time
spent on new material near the
end of the quarter. Professors
should be more sensitive to the
feelings of individual classes
about whether they prefer
exams, midterms, or papers.
Direct, continuing laboratory
experience is one area in which
the natural sciences could im
prove their curriculum. One re
cent returnee from three months
at the Hopkins Marine Station
said he learned more about bio
logy in those three months than
he had the previous three years
of taking biology courses. On
campus equivalents of this pro
gram should be available.
The impact of big-time ath
letics on the educational pro
gram should be examined. Stan
ford has long maintained that
all athletes here qualify under
normal admissions standards,
but personal contact has led to
occasional doubts. These doubts,
as well as rumors of "mickey"
programs for athletes should be
pulled into the open and ex
amined.
Co-op dormitories could signi
ficantly lower the costs of room
and board, while still providing
an enjoyable group-living situa
tion. An evaluation of where our
room and board money goes is
so far overdue that it is a joke.
If the administration will not
lay the facts before us, we
should organize a rent strike.
