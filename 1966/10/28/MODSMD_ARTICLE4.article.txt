# New Harris C15 Nominee Approved By Legislature
## 
### 
Legislature approved the appoint
ment of Sara Syer to the Committee
of Fifteen (Cl 5) last night in an
unusually short and calm meeting.
Speaker Tom Forstenzer also an
ounced that he would, contrary to
what he had thought earlier this quar
ter, "be available" as Speaker for the
rest of the year.
Miss Syer, approved without a dis
senting vote, fills the student position
on Cl 5 left vacant when Legislature
failed to confirm Jan Handke last
week.
Miss Syer, during questioning, said
that she was basically in agreement
with the position expressed earlier
by another student member, that the
purpose of Cl 5 was communication
rather than simply compromise.
"I think that since the burden of
producting legislation does not rest
with the committee members there is

a greater possibility for frank and
honest discussion rather than power
politics," she stated.
Miss Syer went on to say that
while she thought it important to be
cognizent of the views of LASSU,
she would not necessarily always
vote as the majority wished. She
said that she must rely on her own
conscience and judgment in making
her decisions.
In an interview after her accep
tance, she characterized the power
of the Committee of Fifteen as in
fluence: "Paradoxically, the less actual
political power it has, the better
thought out and more helpful its rec
ommendations will be."
She pointed out that, the Committee
of 15, by providing an open forum for
students, faculty, and administrators,
should promote a frank exchange of
ideas and an accurate presentation

of various points of view on a par
ticular issue.
Harris introduced his nomination
as a senior in Hoskins House and
sponsor in Branner last year. When
asked about her other activities Miss
Syer listed the Committee of Five,
a judicial body in Branner, two years
as a student associate, a Stanford proj
ect in Mississippi, and a summer as
a Congressional Intern under the
Stanford in Washington program.
In other business, Susan Horst and
Peter Haas were unanimously ap
proved by legislature as next year's
co-chairmen of the Pre-Reg Commit
tee.
Harris reported that, In response to
a request by the Economics Depart
ment, a student-faculty advisory com
mittee on curriculum has been set
up.
A bill placing the women's off cam
pus issue on a separate ballot at the
coming election was passed without
dissent. The sponsor of the bill stres
sed the need for a wider expression
of student opinion as a follow up to
the petition that over 50 percent of
the women have signed.
Other items in the President's re
port included the announcement of
Bill Berry as Election Commissioner
and a progress report on the Coffee
House issue. "The space problem has
been overcome," Harris reported, "we
do have a place in the RBR."
