# The 						Capitol Scene
## Million Dollar Nonsense 
### Art Buchwald 
WASHINGTONâ€”Every time
I go out lecturing I discover that
one of the first questions that
comes up is "Do you believe in
flying saucers?" I don't know
why people are always asking
me that question unless it's be
cause I look like the type of per
son who might have seen one.
There has been a lot of non
sense written about flying sau
cers, and it is for this reason
that many people have reserva
tions about them. The flying sau
cer business has become a multi
million dollar industry and any
book on the subject will sell in
the hundreds of thousands.
Some of these books are pure
nonsense, but others are so well
written and documented that it
gives one cause to think.
Saucer Cookbook
The most authoritative book
to date on flying saucers has
been written by Dr. Stegle
Steglehofer and is titled "The
Flying Saucer Cookbook." Pro
fessor Steglehofer not only goes
into details on the flying sau
cers that he has seen but he has
also managed to gather together
the favorite recipes of the cap
tains of flying saucer ships.
The professor was in Wash
ington to testify on the truth in
packaging bill and agreed to see
me in his hotel suite.
"Professor, do you believe
there are flying saucers?"
He was about to reply when he
suddenly rushed to the window.
"What was that?"
"What was what?"
"I thought I saw something
strange fly by my window."
"In Washington, D.C.?" I
asked incredulously.
"Oh, they're getting more au
dacious all the time. Besides,
they now know where the money
is."
"What do you mean?"
My Window
"Well, the Air Force has just
authorized $350,000 to make a
study of flying saucers, and the
people on the saucers think
they should have a say in how

the money is spent. After all, it
does affect them."
"That's true," I admitted. "So
you believe they're liable to show
up here?"
"I'm not making any predic
tions, but if they can convince
Congress they exist, there is no
telling how much money will be
allotted to investigate them."
Personally, Professor?
"How many flying saucers
have you seen personally, Pro
fessor?"
"About 33 or 34."
"Did you talk to any of the
crew?"
"Only to the officers. I never
talk to enlisted men."
"What did they say?"
"They're flying over the United
States for peaceful purposes,
and they'll stop their overflights
only if the American people are
allowed to decide their own
destiny. They say they don't
want to inflict their system on
ours, but they are committed to
protect the United States against
aggression from Mars."
"Then they're not from Mars?"
From Venus
"No, they're from Venus. The
ones that have been spotted over
the Soviet Union are from
Mars."
"That certainly complicates
the picture. Does France have
any flying saucers?"
"Only little ones. But it gives
them a pense of grandeur. We'd
much prefer that the United
States and the Soviet Union be
the only countries where you
could see flying saucers, and we
were even willing to share our
sightings with them but De
Gaulle insists the French peo
ple see their own. Now Red
China is starting to see them,
too. In a few years there'll be
flying saucers everywhere."
"Thank you, Professor, for
talking to me."
"It's my pleasure." He ran
back to the window. "There they
go again. Damn, I told them not
to land in the rose garden of
the White House. Now Lady
Bird is really going to be mad."
