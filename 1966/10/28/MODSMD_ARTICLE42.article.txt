## Austria: Changing Times 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
My, my, how times change.
It seems like only yesterday
when we of Austria I were be
ing lambasted by Dr. Walker
for being the worst group of
students ever sent to an Over
seas Campus. All because we
weren't showing enough inter
est in the rich tradition, culture
and aristocratic atmosphere of
The Semmering locality and
especially the Grandhotel Pan
hans. It seems we were more in
terested in such Philistine de
vices as isolation, expenses, ser
vice, privacy, education, enjoy

ment, and meeting Austrians.
We were told not to make
waves against the network of
plush formality. Our job was
merely to get the campus going;
it would be Group ll's duty to
iron out the "minor" problems.
And now I see that Dr. Walker
can't understand why Austria II
had troubles—"lt was absolutely
no problem for the students in
Austria L"
My, my, isn't it amazing how
quickly times (or perhaps peo
ple's opinions) change. . . .
