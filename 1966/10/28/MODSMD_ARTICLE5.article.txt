# Stanford Job Service Helps Financially Burdened Teenagers
## 
### BOB FISHMAN 
Mountain View teenagers who need
money to support their families have
been washing airplanes on Saturdays.
Others who have no place to study
at home have been attending study
centers at a local school.
Still others participate in guitar
classes, drill teams, and homemaking
courses.
All these activities were made pos
sible through the efforts of a group
of Stanford students and their leader,
Mrs. Robert Freelen.
Wife of the director of the Stanford
Fund, Mrs. Freelen became aware of
the needs of Mountain View teenagers
while teaching school there.
Her first project was a job service
Biff Families
"Many-of the kids came from fami
lies with eight children or more,"
Mrs. Freelen remarked. "Most of
them worked with their fathers or
mothers; sometimes the whole family
would go to the fields in the summer.
So there were a lot of kids who were
good workers and needed money â€”
but couldn't find part-time work on
their own."
To find work, Mrs. Freelen put an
ad in a local paper in September, 1963.
Since then, she has been able to find
work each Saturday for forty or more
boys and girls.
"We get most of the jobs through

'call-backs'," said Mrs. Freelen. "Peo
ple who are happy with the work the
kids do call us back and give us more
jobs."
"It's the kids who are really respon
sible for the success of the job ser
vice," she added. "They're the ones
who are willing to go out week after
week and put in a good days work."
Stern Laundry
In addition to washing airplanes,
the teenagers have pruned trees, done
gardening, and done housework. Some
of the girls have started a laundry ser
vice for Serra and Donner Houses in
Stern Hall, where the Freelens are
faculty residents. They wash and iron
shirts for $.20 each.
The success of the Job Service
meant more work for Mr. and Mrs.
Freelen, who often had to drive the
kids to their jobs. Two Stanford stu
dents, Duncan Smith and Bob Broder
ick, volunteered to help.
Since then, the number of Stanford
students working with Mrs. Freelen
has grown to more than forty.
"I'm overwhelmed with the partici
pation of Stanford students," Mrs.
Freelen remarked. "I know that the
work can be boring, tedious and nerve
wracking at times. But I wouldn't
work with the kids if I didn't enjoy
it so much. I hope that everyone has
been getting the kind of satisfactions
that I have."

Stanford students enabled Mrs.
Freelen to launch several new pro
jects. The most important of these is
an evening study center.
Mountain View students who lack
quiet places to study at home can
now come to the junior high school.
Stanford students act as tutors.
Other Stanford students are coach
ing a guitar club, training a seventh
grade drill team, and beginning a
drama club. In addition, Stanford
people have participated in discussion
groups where teenagers could talk
about their problems.
Mrs. Freelen also hopes to set up
an "Older Friend" program. "Many
of these kids have never had any con
tact with an older person who will
listen to them," she says.
Important
"It's important to them if they have
an older friend who can help."
The expansion of the program has
meant that more Stanford students
are needed to help run it. Tutors for
the study center, leaders for the dis
cussion groups, and "older friends"
are especially in demand. Mrs. Free
len has asked any student interested
in the program to contact her at 326-
4316.
In addition, the Job Service now has
more workers than jobs. Anyone with
part-time jobs is also invited to con
tact Mrs. Freelen at the same address.
