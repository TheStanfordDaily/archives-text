The Negro leader was to have dis

roll band. An SDS spokesman has
urged all to come in costume produc
ing a "colored Stanford dancing, sing
ing, and painting, riotously happy and
anonymous."
Donaldson's 7:30 p.m. speech will

followed at 8:30 by the San Francisco

Tomorrow's Black Power Confer
ence at Berkeley, is also sponsored by
the SDS. At a large rally Wednesday,
the Berkeley SDS was accused by the
Afro-American Student Union, a
group of Negro students, of "using
black power and the conference for
ulterior ends, namely of embarrassing
the University and Governor Brown."
The union sent a letter to Carmi
chael Tuesday asking him not to at
tend the conference to be held in Cal's
Greek Theatre because "no black
people would come to the theatre."
One of the principal speakers, Don
Warden, an East Bay attorney and

member of the Union suggested that
Carmichael instead come to "Soul
ville," the Negro area of Oakland.
According to Glenn Becker of the
Daily Californian, "the rally became
very bitter" as the SDS was accused
of "telling lies" and making "insidious
use of the rallying cry 'Black
Power.' " SDS members were promis
ed "death and destruction" by one
speaker.

black power and the conference for
ulterior ends, namely of embarrassing
the University and Governor Brown."

tend the conference to be held in Cal's

people would come to the theatre."
One of the principal speakers, Don
Warden, an East Bay attorney and

member of the Union suggested that
Carmichael instead come to "Soul
ville," the Negro area of Oakland.
According to Glenn Becker of the
Daily Californian, "the rally became
very bitter" as the SDS was accused
of "telling lies" and making "insidious
use of the rallying cry 'Black
Power.' " SDS members were promis
ed "death and destruction" by one
speaker.
SNCC National Chairman Stokely
Carmichael, set as featured speaker
for today's noon-to-midnight "Black
Power Day," has been detained for a
physical by his New York draft board.

Conference in Berkeley.
The Negro leader was to have dis
cussed his concept of black power this
afternoon in Memorial Auditorium as
part of a program co-sponsored by the
Stanford Political Union and the Stan
ford Students for a Democratic So
ciety.
All other events planned for today
will proceed as scheduled. SNCC will
be represented on campus by its East
Coast director, Ivanhoe Donaldson,
who will participate in a Black Power
Teach-in this evening in Cubberley
Auditorium.
The Day will begin with a rally at

noon in White Plaza. Speakers will

there will be dancing to a rock-and
roll band. An SDS spokesman has
urged all to come in costume produc
ing a "colored Stanford dancing, sing
ing, and painting, riotously happy and
anonymous."
Donaldson's 7:30 p.m. speech will

followed at 8:30 by the San Francisco
Mime Troupe presenting a comedy,
"Olive Pits," and their film, "O Dem
