# Doctor Shaves Head; Harris Sympathizer
## 
### ERIC PROKOSCH 
Dr. Oliver Henderson, 51, a Palo
Alto psychiatrist, has shaved his head
in sympathy with David Harris.
"My first reaction was one of ang
er," Henderson told The Daily. "Then
I thought — this is what they want —
let them have it. I'm willing to sacri
fice my hair for this purpose. It's
what's inside that counts. I'm for the
Dave Harrises of America,"
Narcissistic Before
Henderson still cuts a distinguished
figure with a gray beard, rimless
glasses and a battered old hat cover
ing the stubble of his hair. "It was
so narcissistic before," he said, "I
was always combing my hair. Now I
can only comb my beard."
He is not yet used to being without
hair, Henderson said. He does not in
tend to continue shaving his head;
once is enough.
Dr. Henderson attracted attention
last spring by blocking a truck loaded
with empty bomb shells that was en
tering the napalm plant in Redwood
City. Sentenced to 10 days in jail,
Henderson went on a hunger strike
and ate nothing for 15 days.
Anti-War Hypnosis
Since his release, Dr. Henderson
has tried to employ hypnotic techni
ques in speaking to workers at the
plant through a megaphone. He sug
gests to the workers that their fingers
will become heavy like lead because
they don't want to work; that their
skin will tingle and itch as long as
they work on the dirty bomb; that on
or before a certain day they will cease
to work as part of the war machine.
The management has tended to re
spond by playing loud records,especi

ally Tchaikovsky's Pathetlque sym
phony, which is perfect for him, Dr.
Henderson said.
At a recent Stanford football game
Henderson greeted arriving specta
tors with his megaphone: "We're on
the one yard line, we're making na
palm right here in Redwood City, let's
score a touchdown for peace today."
