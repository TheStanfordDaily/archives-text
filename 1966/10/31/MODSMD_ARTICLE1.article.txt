# 'Black Power' Makes Bay Area Debut
## SNCC Head Predicts Further Racial Unrest 
### KIRK HANEN Associate Editor 
BERKELEY—SNCC chairman Stokely Carmichael
called a spade a spade Saturday, in a 55-minute
harangue before a cheering predominantly Negro
crowd of 14,000, in the "intellectual ghetto of the
West."
Describing his movement as "anti-racist racism,"
Carmichael lobbed verbal grenades at nearly every
thing on the white American scene, ending his high
tension tirade with his now-famous catch phrase:
"Move on over or we'll move on over you."
Carmichael, nattily attired in gray continental suit,
yellow button-down shirt, and brown paisley tie,
warned members of the White Establishment that
Negroes "refuse to be the therapy for White society
any longer."
"The white man needs to be civilized," he said,
expounding SNCC's position that "whites are the ones
who need to be raised to our humanistic level."
Before he was through, the 26-year-old Trinidad
born New Yorker called Lyndon Johnson a "buffoon,"
and blasted the draft, U.S. Vietnam policy, liberal
white civil rights workers, and even the fourth
estate—whom he called "advertisers."

Taking his cuts at Johnson, Car
michael prophesied racial war saying,
"You can't move morally against Lyn
don Johnson because he is an im
moral man."
Peace In Vietnam
Lashing out at the draft, after spend
ing the 60 hours previous to his ar
rival in the Bay Area in pre-induction
physicals in New York, Carmichael
said, "We will not kill when they say
to kill—and if we kill, we will decide
who we are going to kill."
On Vietnam: "We are trying to give
peace to the people of Vietnam. As a
black man living in this country, I
wouldn't want to give this to any
body."
"It's time to think about what we
can do to stop people who in the
name of our country are killing babies,
women, and children."
Carmichael admonished liberal
white civil rights workers that the
only positions open to them would
be of a subordinate nature.
"The question is, are we going to
find white people who have enough
courage to go into white commu
nities and organize the whites?"
Nazi Protest
Earlier in the afternoon, five mem
bers of the American Nazi Party
headed by Lt. Allen Lee Vincent pa
raded before Sproul Hall in protest
against the "Black Power" rally in
session nearly a mile and a half away.
Friday night, the party's fuhrer,
Commander George Lincoln Rockwell,
told The Dally that when he becomes
president in 1972, "Negroes will be
shipped back to Africa or placed on
reservations and denied citizenship."
What of Stokely Carmichael?
"He's trying to fill the shoes of Mai

colm X—and I don't think his feet
are big enough."
"I must say, though, that if I were
him, I'd be doing the same thing."
Carmichael was to appear at the
Stanford rally in the White Memor
ial Plaza on Friday. The Stanford
rally was also to feature Ivahoe Don
aldson, Eastern director of Student
Non- Violent Coordinating Committee,

but he also could not attend the Stan
ford meeting.
There was some doubt at one time
whether Stokely Carmichael would
appear at Cal at all, in light of cer
tain protests from Afro-American
students at Berkeley.
