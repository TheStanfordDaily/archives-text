# Kappa Sigs, Roble Top All Pie-Eaters
## 
### STEVE GRUBER 
"We're going to eat so much,
so fast," the girl swore as she
waited her turn at the Chi Psi
pie-eating contest Saturday after
noon.
And when the girls took the
stand, they did just that, much
to the pleasure of the 800 on
lookers standing on the grass
surrounding the fraternity
house.
Banana creme pie hung from
their lips, their ear-lobes, and
their eyebrows. It was all over
their clothing. It stuck to their
hair in uneven globs.
And the crowd loved it.
There were eight separate pie
eating events Saturday after
noon, three heats and a final
event each for both the men's
and women's divisions. But the
women's contests seemed to
bring the most response from
the audience.
"Go get 'em, Susie baby," one
boy yelled as his favorites vainly
attempted to win their heat,
smearing pie from their fore
heads to their chins in the
process. He was rewarded with
a handful of pie on his shirt
for his efforts.
Both the men's and women's
divisions were competing for
prize money of $100 for first
place and $25 for second place,
but the men took the contest
much more seriously. A close
decision which disqualified Al
pha Sigma Phi brought heated
criticisms and boos from the
audience. But when the officials
fouled up results of the wom
en's divisions, the only reaction
was to throw bits of pie at the
master of ceremonies.
When the banana creme stop
ped flying Kappa Sigma
emerged in first place in the
men's division. The "B"' team
from Zeta Psi placed second.
The first place money in the

women's division was awarded
to corridor 1A in Roble. Mirlo
House in Florence Moore was
second.
The crowd wasn't terribly in
terested in who won or lost.
Nearly everyone, including the
contestants, delighted in seeing
the pie-eyed participants after
the eating was done.
And pie-eyed they were. Their
eyes, noses, and mouths were
covered with pie because the ob
jective of the contest is not
really to eat the pie, but to get it
off the plate. Short of throw
ing the pie on the ground, or
stuffing in it your pockets, both
of which are illegal, the best
way to get rid of it is to put it
on your face.
Not only did the contestants
get covered with pie, but so did
quite a few spectators. When
Delta Kappa Epsilon lost their
heat, they hurled the rest of
their pies into the masses.
After the women's final, the
last event of the day, the spec
tators were again the target of
flying banana creme. They
moved much more quickly this
time, having gained valuable
experience throughout the day.
Most of the people who went
to the contest came prepared,
wearing their oldest clothes. An
unfortunate few were dressed in
better clothing. As one girl said,
"I'll sure have fun cleaning this
dress." The participants were
expecting a mess; in fact, some
of the teams stripped down to
swim suits to increase their ef
ficiency.
As the crowd was thinning out
and the Chi Psi's were trying
to clean up the mess, a boy and
girl, hand-in-hand, could be
seen walking back toward the
freshmen dormitories, both com
pletely covered with banana
creme pie. Another day at the
big University had passed.

And when the girls took the
stand, they did just that, much
to the pleasure of the 800 on
lookers standing on the grass
surrounding the fraternity
house.
Banana creme pie hung from
their lips, their ear-lobes, and
their eyebrows. It was all over
their clothing. It stuck to their
hair in uneven globs.
And the crowd loved it.
There were eight separate pie
eating events Saturday after
noon, three heats and a final
event each for both the men's
and women's divisions. But the
women's contests seemed to
bring the most response from
the audience.
"Go get 'em, Susie baby," one
boy yelled as his favorites vainly
attempted to win their heat,
smearing pie from their fore
heads to their chins in the
process. He was rewarded with
a handful of pie on his shirt
for his efforts.
Both the men's and women's
divisions were competing for
prize money of $100 for first
place and $25 for second place,
but the men took the contest
much more seriously. A close
decision which disqualified Al
pha Sigma Phi brought heated
criticisms and boos from the
audience. But when the officials
fouled up results of the wom
en's divisions, the only reaction
was to throw bits of pie at the
master of ceremonies.
When the banana creme stop
ped flying Kappa Sigma
emerged in first place in the
men's division. The "B"' team
from Zeta Psi placed second.
The first place money in the

women's division was awarded
to corridor 1A in Roble. Mirlo
House in Florence Moore was
second.
The crowd wasn't terribly in
terested in who won or lost.
Nearly everyone, including the
contestants, delighted in seeing
the pie-eyed participants after
the eating was done.
And pie-eyed they were. Their
eyes, noses, and mouths were
covered with pie because the ob
jective of the contest is not
really to eat the pie, but to get it
off the plate. Short of throw
ing the pie on the ground, or
stuffing in it your pockets, both
of which are illegal, the best
way to get rid of it is to put it
on your face.
Not only did the contestants
get covered with pie, but so did
quite a few spectators. When
Delta Kappa Epsilon lost their
heat, they hurled the rest of
their pies into the masses.
After the women's final, the
last event of the day, the spec
tators were again the target of
flying banana creme. They
moved much more quickly this
time, having gained valuable
experience throughout the day.
Most of the people who went
to the contest came prepared,
wearing their oldest clothes. An
unfortunate few were dressed in
better clothing. As one girl said,
"I'll sure have fun cleaning this
dress." The participants were
expecting a mess; in fact, some
of the teams stripped down to
swim suits to increase their ef
ficiency.
As the crowd was thinning out
and the Chi Psi's were trying
to clean up the mess, a boy and
girl, hand-in-hand, could be
seen walking back toward the
freshmen dormitories, both com
pletely covered with banana
creme pie. Another day at the
big University had passed.
"We're going to eat so much,
so fast," the girl swore as she
waited her turn at the Chi Psi
pie-eating contest Saturday after
noon.
And when the girls took the
