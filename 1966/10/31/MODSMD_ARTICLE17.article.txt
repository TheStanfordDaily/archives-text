# Administration Censors Smut In Daily Bruin

### 
UCLA Dean of Students,
Byron H. Atkinson, censored the
UCLA Dally Bruin last Tues
day for the newspaper's publica
tion of two obscene words.
The four letter words, carried
in the Monday edition of the
Bruin, were in a story on the
arrest of a UCLA student, John
Gilluly, for allegedly distributing
obscene pamphlets on the cam
pus.
Dean Atkinson said that the
newspaper violated a longstand
ing but unwritten university
policy when it quoted the words
from the pamphlet. He is now
requesting that the university
adopt a definite, written rule to
prevent the use of restroom wall
words in the university publica
tion.
Atkinson reported that he had
previously discussed the matter
with Daily Bruin managing edi
tor Brian Weiss. Weiss defended
the publication's use of the
words as essential in informing
the student body of the issues in
volved.
Weiss added that the newspa
per's treatment of the circula
tion of the pamphlet, a collec
tion of poetry, had been decided
by the members of the Bruin's
editorial board. He said the de
cision was well-considered.
"We were not attempting to
prove that we could get away
with something," Weiss said
later.
Atkinson said that in the past
no obscenity rule was necessary
since the editor's good taste was
considered a sufficient judge of
acceptability.
"Since this is no longer their
view," he said, "we will ask
the campus communications
board to pass a specific rule."
