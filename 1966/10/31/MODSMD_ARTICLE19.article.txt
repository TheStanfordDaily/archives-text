# Huskies Bite Indians With Late FG

### NICK SELBY 
By kicking what he termed
the "biggest field goal of my
career," junior offensive back
Don Martin gave the Univer
sity of Washington Huskies a
last • second, come-from-behind
22-20 victory over the Stanford
Indians Saturday at Stanford.
Martin, who was named back
of the game, kicked a 22 yarder
with only 23 seconds left to
erase a 22-19 Stanford lead. Just
two plays before, Husky coach
Jim Owens had ordered his
team to go for the first down
on fourth and inches on the ten.
Use Up Time
Figuring that 59 seconds
would give the Cards too much

lime to pet within field goal
range, Owens had fullback Jeff
Jordan plunge over right guard
for the yardage. "We wanted to
make sure that if Stanford beat
us, they'd have to score in one
play," Owens commented.
The final field goal was set
up by a 50 yard pass and run
play from Huskie quarterback
Tom Sparlin to ail-American
end Dave Williams. Williams
broke the tackles of three Stan
ford defensive backs at the 50,
then raced to the 20 before being
stopped by end AI Wilburn.
Only 15 Seconds
Washington then used up two
minutes with plunges at the mid
dle by halfbacks Bill Parker and
Jim McCabe. After Martin's field
goal and the ensuing kickoff,
the Indians only had 15 seconds.
Card quarterback Chuck Wil
liams then fired a long pass in
tended for Gene Washington,

normally a quarterback but
playing flanker because of his
speed and a shoulder injury, but
the ball was intercepted by de
fensive halfback Bob Peterson,
and the game ended.
Coach John Ralston felt posi
tively that the Cards' perform
ance was their best yet. "We
lost, however, because Washing
ton wanted it more than we
did," he added.
First Quarter Action
After an exchange of punts
and two Indian failures to move
the ball, the Huskies started
moving. Sparlin moved the team
61 yards in nine plays.
Sparlin hit halfback Jim Sar
toris with a pass for 14 yards,
then watched Parker go for
seven on a draw. Another pass,
this time to Williams, got the
Huskies to the Card 24, and a
final pass to end Jeff Huget
placed them on the one. McCabe
dove in, and Martin's extra point
kick was good to make it 7-0
with 6:29 left.
Root Scores First
Stanford launched a drive at
the end of the first quarter when
Shoemaker rushed for nine
yards. After a 17 yard pass
from Gene Washington to Blunt,
Shoemaker rushed for twelve
more yards on two carries.
Washington carried for 16
more after a great fake on a
roll out.
The Indians moved to
the eight yard line where they
had a third and four situation.
Using a reverse devised spe
cially for scoring situations,
Washington rolled left, then
handed off to flanker Blunt who
ran right to the two. Jack
Root bulled over the linebacker
for the score and Shoemaker
added the extra point.
Martin Kicks First
Washington punted to the
Cards the next time it got the
ball, but on the first play from
scrimmage, Shoemaker fumbled
and Bill Glennon recovered for
the Huskies. Four plays later,
Martin kicked his first field goal
to give Washington a 10-7 edge.

Stanford was unable to score
the remainder of the first half,
although the Cards advanced to
the Washington 29, where a
Shoemaker field goal attempt
was short.
The field goal attempt was set
up by a spetacular run back play
on which Dave Lewis threw the
ball completely across the field
to Bob Blunt, who at the start
of the play had faked an injury.
Blunt then ran 30 yards to the 38.
Marquess Goes 41
Washington received the sec
ond half kickoflf, but was unable
to move the ball. Martin punted
to Stanford safety Mark Mar
quess. Marquess circled to his
right, and a perfect block by

tackle Bob Arnon cut down four
Huskies and freed Marquess up
the sideline behind a wall of
Card blockers for 41 yards to the
Husky 36.
Three plays later, Shoemaker
attempted an important 50 yard
field goal. The ball hit the cross
bar of the goal posts and
bounced down. Had it bounced
over, Stanford might have won
23-22.
After an exchange of intercep
tions, Washington had the ball
on the Stanford 36. End Jeff
Huget made a fantastic one
handed diving catch of a Sparlin
aerial on the eight. Sparlin ran

for three yards, then fullback
Carl Wojciechowski ran twice
for the final five yards and a
score. Martin's kick was no good.
Blunt 75 Yards
On the first play after the kick
off, Williams threw a 75 yard
strike to Blunt. When Williams
threw the ball, Blunt was still
covered. A sudden burst of speed
put Blunt five yards in back of
defensive backs Bob Peterson
and Frank Smith, and he took
the perfectly lead pass without
breaking stride for six points.
Washington increased its slim
16-14 lead six minutes into the
fourth quarter when Martin
kicked his second field goal after
a nine play, 39 yard Husky
drive stalled on the Stanford 18.
Cards Take Lead
Stanford then retaliated and
went into the lead for the first
time. The Cards moved 68 yards
in 12 plays on Williams passes
to Washington, Blunt, and Con
rad. Shoemaker set up the score
when he broke a tackle on the
line of scrimmage and went to
the two.
From there, Jack Root carried
the ball three times and finally
dove into the end zone. The
Cards had to go for two points,
but Washington's roll out around
right end was short. The one
point edge disappeared with Mar
tin's final field goal.

By kicking what he termed
the "biggest field goal of my
career," junior offensive back
Don Martin gave the Univer
sity of Washington Huskies a
last • second, come-from-behind
22-20 victory over the Stanford
Indians Saturday at Stanford.
Martin, who was named back
of the game, kicked a 22 yarder
with only 23 seconds left to
erase a 22-19 Stanford lead. Just
two plays before, Husky coach
Jim Owens had ordered his
team to go for the first down
on fourth and inches on the ten.
Use Up Time
Figuring that 59 seconds
would give the Cards too much

lime to pet within field goal
range, Owens had fullback Jeff
Jordan plunge over right guard
for the yardage. "We wanted to
make sure that if Stanford beat
us, they'd have to score in one
play," Owens commented.
The final field goal was set
up by a 50 yard pass and run
play from Huskie quarterback
Tom Sparlin to ail-American
end Dave Williams. Williams
broke the tackles of three Stan
ford defensive backs at the 50,
then raced to the 20 before being
stopped by end AI Wilburn.
Only 15 Seconds
Washington then used up two
minutes with plunges at the mid
dle by halfbacks Bill Parker and
Jim McCabe. After Martin's field
goal and the ensuing kickoff,
the Indians only had 15 seconds.
Card quarterback Chuck Wil
liams then fired a long pass in
tended for Gene Washington,

normally a quarterback but
playing flanker because of his
speed and a shoulder injury, but
the ball was intercepted by de
fensive halfback Bob Peterson,
and the game ended.
Coach John Ralston felt posi
tively that the Cards' perform
ance was their best yet. "We
lost, however, because Washing
ton wanted it more than we
did," he added.
First Quarter Action
After an exchange of punts
and two Indian failures to move
the ball, the Huskies started
moving. Sparlin moved the team
61 yards in nine plays.
Sparlin hit halfback Jim Sar
toris with a pass for 14 yards,
then watched Parker go for
seven on a draw. Another pass,
this time to Williams, got the
Huskies to the Card 24, and a
final pass to end Jeff Huget
placed them on the one. McCabe
dove in, and Martin's extra point
kick was good to make it 7-0
with 6:29 left.
Root Scores First
Stanford launched a drive at
the end of the first quarter when
Shoemaker rushed for nine
yards. After a 17 yard pass
from Gene Washington to Blunt,
Shoemaker rushed for twelve
more yards on two carries.
Washington carried for 16
more after a great fake on a
roll out.
The Indians moved to
the eight yard line where they
had a third and four situation.
Using a reverse devised spe
cially for scoring situations,
Washington rolled left, then
handed off to flanker Blunt who
ran right to the two. Jack
Root bulled over the linebacker
for the score and Shoemaker
added the extra point.
Martin Kicks First
Washington punted to the
Cards the next time it got the
ball, but on the first play from
scrimmage, Shoemaker fumbled
and Bill Glennon recovered for
the Huskies. Four plays later,
Martin kicked his first field goal
to give Washington a 10-7 edge.

Stanford was unable to score
the remainder of the first half,
although the Cards advanced to
the Washington 29, where a
Shoemaker field goal attempt
was short.
The field goal attempt was set
up by a spetacular run back play
on which Dave Lewis threw the
ball completely across the field
to Bob Blunt, who at the start
of the play had faked an injury.
Blunt then ran 30 yards to the 38.
Marquess Goes 41
Washington received the sec
ond half kickoflf, but was unable
to move the ball. Martin punted
to Stanford safety Mark Mar
quess. Marquess circled to his
right, and a perfect block by

tackle Bob Arnon cut down four
Huskies and freed Marquess up
the sideline behind a wall of
Card blockers for 41 yards to the
Husky 36.
Three plays later, Shoemaker
attempted an important 50 yard
field goal. The ball hit the cross
bar of the goal posts and
bounced down. Had it bounced
over, Stanford might have won
23-22.
After an exchange of intercep
tions, Washington had the ball
on the Stanford 36. End Jeff
Huget made a fantastic one
handed diving catch of a Sparlin
aerial on the eight. Sparlin ran

for three yards, then fullback
Carl Wojciechowski ran twice
for the final five yards and a
score. Martin's kick was no good.
Blunt 75 Yards
On the first play after the kick
off, Williams threw a 75 yard
strike to Blunt. When Williams
threw the ball, Blunt was still
covered. A sudden burst of speed
put Blunt five yards in back of
defensive backs Bob Peterson
and Frank Smith, and he took
the perfectly lead pass without
breaking stride for six points.
Washington increased its slim
16-14 lead six minutes into the
fourth quarter when Martin
kicked his second field goal after
a nine play, 39 yard Husky
drive stalled on the Stanford 18.
Cards Take Lead
Stanford then retaliated and
went into the lead for the first
time. The Cards moved 68 yards
in 12 plays on Williams passes
to Washington, Blunt, and Con
rad. Shoemaker set up the score
when he broke a tackle on the
line of scrimmage and went to
the two.
From there, Jack Root carried
the ball three times and finally
dove into the end zone. The

Blunt 75 Yards
On the first play after the kick
off, Williams threw a 75 yard
strike to Blunt. When Williams
threw the ball, Blunt was still
covered. A sudden burst of speed
put Blunt five yards in back of
defensive backs Bob Peterson
and Frank Smith, and he took
the perfectly lead pass without
breaking stride for six points.
Washington increased its slim
16-14 lead six minutes into the
fourth quarter when Martin
kicked his second field goal after
a nine play, 39 yard Husky
drive stalled on the Stanford 18.
Cards Take Lead
Stanford then retaliated and
went into the lead for the first
time. The Cards moved 68 yards
in 12 plays on Williams passes
to Washington, Blunt, and Con
rad. Shoemaker set up the score
when he broke a tackle on the
line of scrimmage and went to
the two.
From there, Jack Root carried
the ball three times and finally
dove into the end zone. The
Cards had to go for two points,
but Washington's roll out around
right end was short. The one
point edge disappeared with Mar
tin's final field goal.

By kicking what he termed
the "biggest field goal of my
career," junior offensive back
Don Martin gave the Univer
sity of Washington Huskies a
last • second, come-from-behind
22-20 victory over the Stanford
Indians Saturday at Stanford.
Martin, who was named back
of the game, kicked a 22 yarder
with only 23 seconds left to
erase a 22-19 Stanford lead. Just
two plays before, Husky coach
Jim Owens had ordered his
team to go for the first down
on fourth and inches on the ten.
Use Up Time
Figuring that 59 seconds
would give the Cards too much

lime to pet within field goal
range, Owens had fullback Jeff
Jordan plunge over right guard
for the yardage. "We wanted to
make sure that if Stanford beat
us, they'd have to score in one
play," Owens commented.
The final field goal was set
up by a 50 yard pass and run
play from Huskie quarterback
Tom Sparlin to ail-American
end Dave Williams. Williams
broke the tackles of three Stan
ford defensive backs at the 50,
then raced to the 20 before being
stopped by end AI Wilburn.
Only 15 Seconds
Washington then used up two
minutes with plunges at the mid
dle by halfbacks Bill Parker and
Jim McCabe. After Martin's field
goal and the ensuing kickoff,
the Indians only had 15 seconds.
Card quarterback Chuck Wil
liams then fired a long pass in
tended for Gene Washington,

normally a quarterback but
playing flanker because of his
speed and a shoulder injury, but
the ball was intercepted by de
fensive halfback Bob Peterson,
and the game ended.
Coach John Ralston felt posi
tively that the Cards' perform
ance was their best yet. "We
lost, however, because Washing
ton wanted it more than we
did," he added.
First Quarter Action
After an exchange of punts
and two Indian failures to move
the ball, the Huskies started
moving. Sparlin moved the team
61 yards in nine plays.
Sparlin hit halfback Jim Sar
toris with a pass for 14 yards,
then watched Parker go for
seven on a draw. Another pass,
this time to Williams, got the
Huskies to the Card 24, and a
final pass to end Jeff Huget
placed them on the one. McCabe
dove in, and Martin's extra point
kick was good to make it 7-0
with 6:29 left.
Root Scores First
Stanford launched a drive at
the end of the first quarter when
Shoemaker rushed for nine
yards. After a 17 yard pass
from Gene Washington to Blunt,
Shoemaker rushed for twelve
more yards on two carries.
Washington carried for 16
more after a great fake on a
roll out.
The Indians moved to
the eight yard line where they
had a third and four situation.
Using a reverse devised spe
cially for scoring situations,
Washington rolled left, then
handed off to flanker Blunt who
ran right to the two. Jack
Root bulled over the linebacker
for the score and Shoemaker
added the extra point.
Martin Kicks First
Washington punted to the
Cards the next time it got the
ball, but on the first play from
scrimmage, Shoemaker fumbled
and Bill Glennon recovered for
the Huskies. Four plays later,
Martin kicked his first field goal
to give Washington a 10-7 edge.

Stanford was unable to score
the remainder of the first half,
although the Cards advanced to
the Washington 29, where a
Shoemaker field goal attempt
was short.
The field goal attempt was set
up by a spetacular run back play
on which Dave Lewis threw the
ball completely across the field
to Bob Blunt, who at the start
of the play had faked an injury.
Blunt then ran 30 yards to the 38.
Marquess Goes 41
Washington received the sec
ond half kickoflf, but was unable
to move the ball. Martin punted
to Stanford safety Mark Mar
quess. Marquess circled to his
right, and a perfect block by

tackle Bob Arnon cut down four
Huskies and freed Marquess up
the sideline behind a wall of
Card blockers for 41 yards to the
Husky 36.
Three plays later, Shoemaker
attempted an important 50 yard
field goal. The ball hit the cross
bar of the goal posts and
bounced down. Had it bounced
over, Stanford might have won
23-22.
After an exchange of intercep
tions, Washington had the ball
on the Stanford 36. End Jeff
Huget made a fantastic one
handed diving catch of a Sparlin
aerial on the eight. Sparlin ran

for three yards, then fullback
Carl Wojciechowski ran twice
for the final five yards and a
score. Martin's kick was no good.

quess. Marquess circled to his
right, and a perfect block by

tackle Bob Arnon cut down four
Huskies and freed Marquess up
the sideline behind a wall of
Card blockers for 41 yards to the
Husky 36.
Three plays later, Shoemaker
attempted an important 50 yard
field goal. The ball hit the cross
bar of the goal posts and
bounced down. Had it bounced
over, Stanford might have won
23-22.
After an exchange of intercep
tions, Washington had the ball
on the Stanford 36. End Jeff
Huget made a fantastic one
handed diving catch of a Sparlin
aerial on the eight. Sparlin ran

for three yards, then fullback
Carl Wojciechowski ran twice
for the final five yards and a
score. Martin's kick was no good.
Blunt 75 Yards
On the first play after the kick
off, Williams threw a 75 yard
strike to Blunt. When Williams
threw the ball, Blunt was still
covered. A sudden burst of speed
put Blunt five yards in back of
defensive backs Bob Peterson
and Frank Smith, and he took
the perfectly lead pass without
breaking stride for six points.
Washington increased its slim
16-14 lead six minutes into the
fourth quarter when Martin
kicked his second field goal after
a nine play, 39 yard Husky
drive stalled on the Stanford 18.
Cards Take Lead
Stanford then retaliated and
went into the lead for the first
time. The Cards moved 68 yards
in 12 plays on Williams passes
to Washington, Blunt, and Con
rad. Shoemaker set up the score
when he broke a tackle on the
line of scrimmage and went to
the two.
From there, Jack Root carried
the ball three times and finally
dove into the end zone. The
Cards had to go for two points,
but Washington's roll out around
right end was short. The one
point edge disappeared with Mar
tin's final field goal.

By kicking what he termed
the "biggest field goal of my
career," junior offensive back
Don Martin gave the Univer
sity of Washington Huskies a
last • second, come-from-behind
22-20 victory over the Stanford
Indians Saturday at Stanford.
Martin, who was named back
of the game, kicked a 22 yarder
with only 23 seconds left to
erase a 22-19 Stanford lead. Just
two plays before, Husky coach
Jim Owens had ordered his
team to go for the first down
on fourth and inches on the ten.
Use Up Time
Figuring that 59 seconds
would give the Cards too much

lime to pet within field goal
range, Owens had fullback Jeff
Jordan plunge over right guard
for the yardage. "We wanted to
make sure that if Stanford beat
us, they'd have to score in one
play," Owens commented.
The final field goal was set
up by a 50 yard pass and run
play from Huskie quarterback
Tom Sparlin to ail-American
end Dave Williams. Williams
broke the tackles of three Stan
ford defensive backs at the 50,
then raced to the 20 before being
stopped by end AI Wilburn.
Only 15 Seconds
Washington then used up two
minutes with plunges at the mid
dle by halfbacks Bill Parker and
Jim McCabe. After Martin's field
goal and the ensuing kickoff,
the Indians only had 15 seconds.
Card quarterback Chuck Wil
liams then fired a long pass in
tended for Gene Washington,

normally a quarterback but
playing flanker because of his
speed and a shoulder injury, but
the ball was intercepted by de
fensive halfback Bob Peterson,
and the game ended.
Coach John Ralston felt posi
tively that the Cards' perform
ance was their best yet. "We
lost, however, because Washing
ton wanted it more than we
did," he added.
First Quarter Action
After an exchange of punts
and two Indian failures to move
the ball, the Huskies started
moving. Sparlin moved the team
61 yards in nine plays.
Sparlin hit halfback Jim Sar
toris with a pass for 14 yards,
then watched Parker go for
seven on a draw. Another pass,
this time to Williams, got the
Huskies to the Card 24, and a
final pass to end Jeff Huget
placed them on the one. McCabe
dove in, and Martin's extra point
kick was good to make it 7-0
with 6:29 left.
Root Scores First
Stanford launched a drive at
the end of the first quarter when
Shoemaker rushed for nine
yards. After a 17 yard pass
from Gene Washington to Blunt,
Shoemaker rushed for twelve
more yards on two carries.
Washington carried for 16
more after a great fake on a
roll out.
The Indians moved to
the eight yard line where they
had a third and four situation.
Using a reverse devised spe
cially for scoring situations,
Washington rolled left, then
handed off to flanker Blunt who
ran right to the two. Jack
Root bulled over the linebacker
for the score and Shoemaker
added the extra point.
Martin Kicks First
Washington punted to the
Cards the next time it got the
ball, but on the first play from
scrimmage, Shoemaker fumbled
and Bill Glennon recovered for
the Huskies. Four plays later,
Martin kicked his first field goal
to give Washington a 10-7 edge.

Stanford was unable to score
the remainder of the first half,
although the Cards advanced to
the Washington 29, where a
Shoemaker field goal attempt
was short.
The field goal attempt was set
up by a spetacular run back play
on which Dave Lewis threw the
ball completely across the field
to Bob Blunt, who at the start
of the play had faked an injury.
Blunt then ran 30 yards to the 38.
Marquess Goes 41
Washington received the sec
ond half kickoflf, but was unable
to move the ball. Martin punted
to Stanford safety Mark Mar
quess. Marquess circled to his
right, and a perfect block by

tackle Bob Arnon cut down four
Huskies and freed Marquess up
the sideline behind a wall of
Card blockers for 41 yards to the
Husky 36.
Three plays later, Shoemaker
attempted an important 50 yard
field goal. The ball hit the cross
bar of the goal posts and
bounced down. Had it bounced
over, Stanford might have won
23-22.
After an exchange of intercep
tions, Washington had the ball
on the Stanford 36. End Jeff
Huget made a fantastic one

threw the ball, Blunt was still
