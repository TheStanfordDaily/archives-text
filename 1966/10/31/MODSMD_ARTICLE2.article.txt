## 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
Leading off Friday's Black Power Rally with an
accusation that both Brown and .Reagan "practice rac
ism," Edward Keating, Editor of Ramparts magazine,
used this recent forum to lash out at a variety of
topics.
Though minus Stokely Carmichael, who was de
tained by his draft board in New York, the day in
cluded a rally, a fair, a teach-in, and a performance by
the San Francisco Mime Troupe.
Activities began at noon as a crowd of over 700 in
White Memorial Plaza were addressed by Keating.
Keating, who castigated the "American way of vio
lence and White Power" at home and abroad, alleged
that the United States is loading atomic bombs on
the U.S.S. Enterprise for use in Vietnam. Saying that
it is only a rumor, he challenged the Pentagon to
refute it, or by remaining silent, admit it was true.
Keating continued by predicting the United States
will invade North Vietnam immediately after the
coming elections so that in 1968, President Johnson
can appeal for votes on a "You can't change horses
in mid-stream" platform.
The liberal editor claimed America is dominated
by an "International and domestic racist policy." He

stated, "Blacks get talked to, get
talked about, get talked over, but
never get listened to."
Following Keating was Johnny
Scott, a Stanford student from Watts,
widely considered one of the most
promising young writers in America.
He spoke about what it's like to be a
Negro living amidst riots and dis
cord. He defined "Black Power" as,
"When you are very aware of who
I am."
Dave Harris concluded the speeches
and began the fair by cutting the open
ing string and calling for, "Non-vi
olent expressions of involvement dur
ing the afternoon."
The fair ran until evening in White
Plaza. It included an area where one
could be painted a multitude of hues,
and as a participant said, "lose your
identity except for color." .
An over-flow crowd was on hand
for the Mime Troupe. They first per
formed their commedia dell-arte
adaptation entitled "Olive Pits."
Concluding the day's activities were
two panel discussions.

The fair ran until evening in White
Plaza. It included an area where one
could be painted a multitude of hues,
and as a participant said, "lose your
identity except for color." .
An over-flow crowd was on hand
for the Mime Troupe. They first per
formed their commedia dell-arte
adaptation entitled "Olive Pits."
Concluding the day's activities were
two panel discussions.
Leading off Friday's Black Power Rally with an
accusation that both Brown and .Reagan "practice rac
ism," Edward Keating, Editor of Ramparts magazine,
used this recent forum to lash out at a variety of
topics.
Though minus Stokely Carmichael, who was de
tained by his draft board in New York, the day in
cluded a rally, a fair, a teach-in, and a performance by
the San Francisco Mime Troupe.
Activities began at noon as a crowd of over 700 in
White Memorial Plaza were addressed by Keating.
Keating, who castigated the "American way of vio
lence and White Power" at home and abroad, alleged
that the United States is loading atomic bombs on
the U.S.S. Enterprise for use in Vietnam. Saying that
it is only a rumor, he challenged the Pentagon to
refute it, or by remaining silent, admit it was true.
Keating continued by predicting the United States
will invade North Vietnam immediately after the
coming elections so that in 1968, President Johnson
can appeal for votes on a "You can't change horses
in mid-stream" platform.
The liberal editor claimed America is dominated
by an "International and domestic racist policy." He

stated, "Blacks get talked to, get
talked about, get talked over, but
never get listened to."
Following Keating was Johnny
Scott, a Stanford student from Watts,
widely considered one of the most
promising young writers in America.
He spoke about what it's like to be a
Negro living amidst riots and dis
cord. He defined "Black Power" as,
"When you are very aware of who
I am."
Dave Harris concluded the speeches
and began the fair by cutting the open
ing string and calling for, "Non-vi
olent expressions of involvement dur
ing the afternoon."
