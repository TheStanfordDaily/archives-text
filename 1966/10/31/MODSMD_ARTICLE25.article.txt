### WELLS SHOEMAKER Sports Editor 
The Stanford water polo team
joined the football team as a
squad that came out two points

on the wrong side of victory for
its weekend efforts.
Friday, the Indians lost a
double overtime, foully-refereed
contest to USC, 7-6, in the Tro
jan's pool. The next day, unde
feated UCLA's Stan Cole scored
his seventh goal of the game
with 2 seconds remaining to top
the Tribe, 9-8.
Stanford has now lost 4 games
by one goal.
USC lost to Stanford, 11-10, in
sudden death earlier this year.
The Trojans went nip and tuck
with the Cards throughout the
game, relying mainly on the
strong arm of JRoy Saari.
Greg Buckingham scored two
in the first quarter for Stanford
to balance Southern Cal's out
put. Gary Sheerer scored the
only goal of the second quarter
to give Stanford a 3-2 halftime
lead.
John Parker took an assist
from Sheerer to offset a
â€¢ >.ird period score by Saari, who
'jrvdod only track shoes to com
r-leto his shallow end play.
Stanford played a low fouling
offensive game, picking up only
5 fouls in the first half, and 11
through the third period. With
USC down, 4-3, in the fourth
period, however, the officials'
whistles came mysteriously to
life, and Stanford was pegged
for 18 fouls in the last quarter.
USC tied the game on a Saari
hole shot, forcing the game into
overtime. John Parker scored his
second of the game in the first

overtime quarter. Parker was
later ejected from the game for
reaching over the shoulder of a
USC man who had fouled out
of the game and was blocking
Parker's legitimate access to
the ball.
Luis Nicolao scored another
Stanford goal, but USC hit three
to decide the game.
Best Game Of Season
Stanford played its best game
of the season by far against
UCLA, but Bruin Stan Cole
proved to be the Indians' undo
ing. The game see-sawed back
and forth until, with the trigger
cocked for the final gun, Cole
broke away and scored the de
ciding goal.
Gary Sheerer opened the game
with a half-court blast that
sought out the corner of the
Bruin net. Sheerer scored four
in the game and tossed two as
sist passes to Parker.
Mark Parmely, who had two
assists, fired in one goal. Buck
ingham alsohit one. The Cards
shot 57 per cent.
