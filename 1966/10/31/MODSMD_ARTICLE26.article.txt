With a playoff berth at stake,
Sigma Chi and A.T.O. intramural
football teams meet at 4:15 to
day. The winner will most likely
join Phi Kappa Sigma as league
representative in the university
tournament.
Still-unbeaten Fremont, Delt
and S.A.E. hope to stay that way
when they meet league foes in
three other games. A Fremont
win over Lassen would assure
last year's school runner-up a
playoff spot, with a league title
encounter with Donner yet to
come.
Three-man teams from Theta
Delt and El Toro will match free
throws in Encina Gym at 8:30
tonight to decide the "A" team
championship.
Theta Delt, winner last year,
has averaged 67 out of 75 shots
in its last few victories, a figure
matched by El Toro in its semi
final win. The number of shots
will be doubled tonight, with
each man shooting 50, and this
may lower the percentage some
what. Phi Kap and the Delts will
decide the "B" championship at
8:00.
Brilliant series by Doug Prinie
of Theta Chi and Ralph Kimball
of El Toro highlighted last
week's intramural bowling.
Rolling in the Monday league,
Pirnie put together games of
229 and 226 for a season high of
455.
