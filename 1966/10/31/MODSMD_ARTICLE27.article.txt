# For peace in Vietnam:
## "... we call for immediate cessation of United States bombing and the beginning of a clearly stated and swiftly phased withdrawal..." 
### 
Believing that war is contrary to the will of God, the Board of
Directors of the American Friends Service Committee authorized
earlier this year the publication of an analysis of the Vietnam war under
the title Peace in Vie'nam. Today we feel impelled to speak again
about American involvement, not only because of the deepening tragedy
of the war itself but also because of its dangerous impact on crucial
aspects of American life. Our committee is deeply involved in the
struggle in the United States against poverty, racial division, and un
equal opportunities in education, housing, and livelihood. The causes
that underlie these national problems have their counterpart in the
Vietnam tragedy and in the needs and aspirations of men around the
world. As the war escalates in Vietnam, its relentless demands
require the curtailment of plans for mutual betterment and cooperation
at home. The danger of violence escalates here and elsewhere, and time
runs out.
Therefore, we are grateful for Ambassador Goldberg's formulation
before the United Nations General Assembly of the steps the United
States is prepared to take toward a peaceful settlement of the war in
Vietnam, and share the nation's hope that a positive response may yet
come from North Vietnam. We are distressed, however, that this con
ciliatory initiative was undermined by the simultaneous announcement
of a substantial increase in the planned production of United States war
planes and by resort again to massive B-52 bombing raids on North
Vietnam for the first time since May, 1966.
Moreover, beyond the negative effect of these apparently contra
dictory actions is the larger difficulty that the American proposals have
again been advanced in the context of an aggrieved party offering
generous terms to an aggressor. This context is predictably unaccept
able to Hanoi, which sees itself as the victim of unwarranted American
interference in a civil war. Thus, while both sides declare their desire

to end the lighting, both expand their military forces and both announce
their preparedness to continue the war for years. Neither credits the
other with integrity of purpose, neither has unequivocally offered to
negotiate with acknowledged representatives of all other belligerents.
Meanwhile, fighting men on both sides and the people of Vietnam suffer
and die.
When all ideological and political considerations, all questions of
prestige and commitment, of deeds and misdeeds, have been weighed in
the balance, the fact remains that this open-ended agony is an affront
to human dignity and a blow to human progress. The AFSC refuses to
accept war as the arbiter of men's lives; we deny that it has moral
authority. Yet in the absence of a conciliatory response to Ambassador
Goldberg's proposals, we fear that prospects for negotiation will recede
further and a climate emerge in which continuation of the war will
become the dominant factor in national policy and the only real options
escalation or attrition.
In these grave circumstances, and to create a climate in which
negotiation among all Vietnamese parties can occur, we call for an
immediate cessation of United States bombing and the beginning of a
clearly stated and swiftly phased withdrawal of all American troops
and weapons, with provision for sanctuary for those who might suffer
retaliation.
We hold that the United States, which has led in measures to esca
late the war, has primary responsibility to go beyond proposals that
depend for their implementation on the activities of others. We do not
pretend that such measures will suddenly heal the deep wounds of the
past or lead to a prompt end of the problems of Vietnam. All we assert
is that the certain agony of continued war is intolerable, and that the
way out lies in United States action to end it.

Because we believe this is the right course for us to urge, the American Friends Service Committee proposes to undertake the following:

â– M We are going to draw heavily on the modest re
sources of the American Friends Service Commit
tee and are taxing ourselves individually in order to do
more for peace in Vietnam.
We feel impelled to do so when faced wi'h the plight
of the Vietnamese, the damage being done to the
United States, and the peril to our own souls if we
assent to the crushing of this small and distant nation
to serve what we believe to be a misconceplion of our
national interest.
2 Though we directly oppose the war itself, we will
do all vva can to increase our humanitarian efforts.
We have persons working now among war sufferers in
South Vietnam, and we seek to do likewise in North
Vietnam and in territories held by the National Libera
tion Front.
All war is cri.el, and modern war is particularly bar
baric. Today in Vietnam war engulfs communities in
death and destruction, and gradually reduces all
sensitivity to the suffering of others.
3 We intend to work vigorously to strengthen free
dom in America and will encourage those who are
conscientiously impelled to withh:''l their support of
of the war in Vietnam.
War demands the conscription of society and erodes
the freedom of individuals. Our nation is suffering from
this process today.
4 We will work to renew faith in a United Nations
wnose present weakness is a tragedy for all men.

War breaks down the structure of international com
munity and sets back the search for peace. Unilateral
military action by one great power that makes itself the
judge of aggression, stifles the effort to find the true
voice of a world community that is struggling to be
born. We deplore the failure of governments, including
the United States, to give consistent support to the
United Nations.
5 We will support and encourage as we are able
those young men who cannot conscientiously
accept war service in Vietnam.
War requires young men to kill and be killed. We
call on Americans to grapple with the moral issues
raised by participation in the fighting.
6 We will support our government in all efforts to
use our national brains and resources peaceably
to meet human need here, in the Mekong Valley, and
elsewhere in the world.
War misuses God's gifts to men. It subverts the
minds and skills of scientists and administrators to
produce instruments of death rather than life. All men
are required to make responsible use of mind and mat
ter. Nations rich in both must use their affluence in
constructive ways for the common good. For this rea
son we believe men may in conscience refuse to lend
their talents or their organizations to produce the plans
or materials of war.
7 We will encourage and work with religious groups
throughout America to end this war.
Religious sanction of war is a mockery. Instead of

sanctifying war it debases religion. All religious faiths
may rightly deny moral sanction to military action in
Vietnam. The American Friends Service Committee,
as a Quaker organization, denies such sanction.
8 As citizens we will in deep religious conviction
visit and encourage others to visit officers of the
Administration and members of Congress to explore the
case for withdrawal from Vietnam. We also will call
upon our fellow Americans to ready the nationaj con
science for rebuilding in Vietnam what our nation is
now engaged in destroying, with the same intensity of
purpose and commitment of resources as are now
lavished upon the war.
The responsibility for war is shared by all who take
part in the governing of their fellow men. We affirm
the duty of each citizen in the United States to ques
tion with public officials the morality of continuing
military intervention in Vietnam.
9 We will encourage public discussion of applying
the concept of conscientious objection to violation
of international law and crimes against humanity. As
individuals and as an organization we will explore the
implications for ourselves of this kind of extension and
examine its relationship to such questions as conscien
tious refusal to pay taxes for war.
If a mature body of meaningful international law is
to be realized it must be rooted in principle that is
respected even in time of war. One side in a dispute
cannot excuse its excesses by pointing to the wrongful
acts of the other side, and individuals must recognize
that there are limits to their duty to carry out the orders
of other men.
Gilbert White, Chairman of the Board

We welcome ell who will join us in these endeavors, whether their commitment is expressed through their own acts or
through g :f ts of money or service to the American Friends Service Committee or any other organization similarly witnessing
against the war. We seek the rebirth of society and in this there is room for all.

Moreover, beyond the negative effect of these apparently contra
dictory actions is the larger difficulty that the American proposals have
again been advanced in the context of an aggrieved party offering
generous terms to an aggressor. This context is predictably unaccept
able to Hanoi, which sees itself as the victim of unwarranted American
interference in a civil war. Thus, while both sides declare their desire

to end the lighting, both expand their military forces and both announce
their preparedness to continue the war for years. Neither credits the
other with integrity of purpose, neither has unequivocally offered to
negotiate with acknowledged representatives of all other belligerents.
Meanwhile, fighting men on both sides and the people of Vietnam suffer
and die.
When all ideological and political considerations, all questions of
prestige and commitment, of deeds and misdeeds, have been weighed in
the balance, the fact remains that this open-ended agony is an affront
to human dignity and a blow to human progress. The AFSC refuses to
accept war as the arbiter of men's lives; we deny that it has moral
authority. Yet in the absence of a conciliatory response to Ambassador
Goldberg's proposals, we fear that prospects for negotiation will recede
further and a climate emerge in which continuation of the war will
become the dominant factor in national policy and the only real options
escalation or attrition.
In these grave circumstances, and to create a climate in which
negotiation among all Vietnamese parties can occur, we call for an
immediate cessation of United States bombing and the beginning of a
clearly stated and swiftly phased withdrawal of all American troops
and weapons, with provision for sanctuary for those who might suffer
retaliation.
We hold that the United States, which has led in measures to esca
late the war, has primary responsibility to go beyond proposals that
depend for their implementation on the activities of others. We do not
pretend that such measures will suddenly heal the deep wounds of the
past or lead to a prompt end of the problems of Vietnam. All we assert
is that the certain agony of continued war is intolerable, and that the
way out lies in United States action to end it.

Because we believe this is the right course for us to urge, the American Friends Service Committee proposes to undertake the following:

â– M We are going to draw heavily on the modest re
sources of the American Friends Service Commit
tee and are taxing ourselves individually in order to do
more for peace in Vietnam.
We feel impelled to do so when faced wi'h the plight
of the Vietnamese, the damage being done to the
United States, and the peril to our own souls if we
assent to the crushing of this small and distant nation
to serve what we believe to be a misconceplion of our
national interest.
2 Though we directly oppose the war itself, we will
do all vva can to increase our humanitarian efforts.
We have persons working now among war sufferers in
South Vietnam, and we seek to do likewise in North
Vietnam and in territories held by the National Libera
tion Front.
All war is cri.el, and modern war is particularly bar
baric. Today in Vietnam war engulfs communities in
death and destruction, and gradually reduces all
sensitivity to the suffering of others.
3 We intend to work vigorously to strengthen free
dom in America and will encourage those who are
conscientiously impelled to withh:''l their support of
of the war in Vietnam.
War demands the conscription of society and erodes
the freedom of individuals. Our nation is suffering from
this process today.
4 We will work to renew faith in a United Nations
wnose present weakness is a tragedy for all men.

War breaks down the structure of international com
munity and sets back the search for peace. Unilateral
military action by one great power that makes itself the
judge of aggression, stifles the effort to find the true
voice of a world community that is struggling to be
born. We deplore the failure of governments, including
the United States, to give consistent support to the
United Nations.
5 We will support and encourage as we are able
those young men who cannot conscientiously
accept war service in Vietnam.
War requires young men to kill and be killed. We
call on Americans to grapple with the moral issues
raised by participation in the fighting.
6 We will support our government in all efforts to
use our national brains and resources peaceably
to meet human need here, in the Mekong Valley, and
elsewhere in the world.
War misuses God's gifts to men. It subverts the
minds and skills of scientists and administrators to
produce instruments of death rather than life. All men
are required to make responsible use of mind and mat
ter. Nations rich in both must use their affluence in
constructive ways for the common good. For this rea
son we believe men may in conscience refuse to lend
their talents or their organizations to produce the plans
or materials of war.
7 We will encourage and work with religious groups
throughout America to end this war.
Religious sanction of war is a mockery. Instead of

sanctifying war it debases religion. All religious faiths
may rightly deny moral sanction to military action in
Vietnam. The American Friends Service Committee,
as a Quaker organization, denies such sanction.
8 As citizens we will in deep religious conviction
visit and encourage others to visit officers of the
Administration and members of Congress to explore the
case for withdrawal from Vietnam. We also will call
upon our fellow Americans to ready the nationaj con
science for rebuilding in Vietnam what our nation is
now engaged in destroying, with the same intensity of
purpose and commitment of resources as are now
lavished upon the war.
The responsibility for war is shared by all who take
part in the governing of their fellow men. We affirm
the duty of each citizen in the United States to ques
tion with public officials the morality of continuing
military intervention in Vietnam.
9 We will encourage public discussion of applying
the concept of conscientious objection to violation
of international law and crimes against humanity. As
individuals and as an organization we will explore the
implications for ourselves of this kind of extension and
examine its relationship to such questions as conscien
tious refusal to pay taxes for war.
If a mature body of meaningful international law is
to be realized it must be rooted in principle that is
respected even in time of war. One side in a dispute
cannot excuse its excesses by pointing to the wrongful
acts of the other side, and individuals must recognize
that there are limits to their duty to carry out the orders
of other men.
Gilbert White, Chairman of the Board

We welcome ell who will join us in these endeavors, whether their commitment is expressed through their own acts or
through g :f ts of money or service to the American Friends Service Committee or any other organization similarly witnessing
against the war. We seek the rebirth of society and in this there is room for all.
Believing that war is contrary to the will of God, the Board of
Directors of the American Friends Service Committee authorized
earlier this year the publication of an analysis of the Vietnam war under
the title Peace in Vie'nam. Today we feel impelled to speak again
about American involvement, not only because of the deepening tragedy
of the war itself but also because of its dangerous impact on crucial
aspects of American life. Our committee is deeply involved in the
struggle in the United States against poverty, racial division, and un
equal opportunities in education, housing, and livelihood. The causes
that underlie these national problems have their counterpart in the
Vietnam tragedy and in the needs and aspirations of men around the
world. As the war escalates in Vietnam, its relentless demands
require the curtailment of plans for mutual betterment and cooperation
at home. The danger of violence escalates here and elsewhere, and time
runs out.
Therefore, we are grateful for Ambassador Goldberg's formulation
before the United Nations General Assembly of the steps the United
States is prepared to take toward a peaceful settlement of the war in
Vietnam, and share the nation's hope that a positive response may yet
come from North Vietnam. We are distressed, however, that this con
ciliatory initiative was undermined by the simultaneous announcement
of a substantial increase in the planned production of United States war
planes and by resort again to massive B-52 bombing raids on North
Vietnam for the first time since May, 1966.

clearly stated and swiftly phased withdrawal of all American troops
and weapons, with provision for sanctuary for those who might suffer
retaliation.
We hold that the United States, which has led in measures to esca
late the war, has primary responsibility to go beyond proposals that
depend for their implementation on the activities of others. We do not
pretend that such measures will suddenly heal the deep wounds of the
past or lead to a prompt end of the problems of Vietnam. All we assert
is that the certain agony of continued war is intolerable, and that the
way out lies in United States action to end it.

Because we believe this is the right course for us to urge, the American Friends Service Committee proposes to undertake the following:

â– M We are going to draw heavily on the modest re
sources of the American Friends Service Commit
tee and are taxing ourselves individually in order to do
more for peace in Vietnam.
We feel impelled to do so when faced wi'h the plight
of the Vietnamese, the damage being done to the
United States, and the peril to our own souls if we
assent to the crushing of this small and distant nation
to serve what we believe to be a misconceplion of our
national interest.
2 Though we directly oppose the war itself, we will
do all vva can to increase our humanitarian efforts.
We have persons working now among war sufferers in
South Vietnam, and we seek to do likewise in North
Vietnam and in territories held by the National Libera
tion Front.
All war is cri.el, and modern war is particularly bar
baric. Today in Vietnam war engulfs communities in
death and destruction, and gradually reduces all
sensitivity to the suffering of others.
3 We intend to work vigorously to strengthen free
dom in America and will encourage those who are
conscientiously impelled to withh:''l their support of
of the war in Vietnam.
War demands the conscription of society and erodes
the freedom of individuals. Our nation is suffering from
this process today.
4 We will work to renew faith in a United Nations
wnose present weakness is a tragedy for all men.

War breaks down the structure of international com
munity and sets back the search for peace. Unilateral
military action by one great power that makes itself the
judge of aggression, stifles the effort to find the true
voice of a world community that is struggling to be
born. We deplore the failure of governments, including
the United States, to give consistent support to the
United Nations.
5 We will support and encourage as we are able
those young men who cannot conscientiously
accept war service in Vietnam.
War requires young men to kill and be killed. We
call on Americans to grapple with the moral issues
raised by participation in the fighting.
6 We will support our government in all efforts to
use our national brains and resources peaceably
to meet human need here, in the Mekong Valley, and
elsewhere in the world.
War misuses God's gifts to men. It subverts the
minds and skills of scientists and administrators to
produce instruments of death rather than life. All men
are required to make responsible use of mind and mat
ter. Nations rich in both must use their affluence in
constructive ways for the common good. For this rea
son we believe men may in conscience refuse to lend
their talents or their organizations to produce the plans
or materials of war.
7 We will encourage and work with religious groups
throughout America to end this war.
Religious sanction of war is a mockery. Instead of

sanctifying war it debases religion. All religious faiths
may rightly deny moral sanction to military action in
Vietnam. The American Friends Service Committee,
as a Quaker organization, denies such sanction.
8 As citizens we will in deep religious conviction
visit and encourage others to visit officers of the
Administration and members of Congress to explore the
case for withdrawal from Vietnam. We also will call
upon our fellow Americans to ready the nationaj con
science for rebuilding in Vietnam what our nation is
now engaged in destroying, with the same intensity of
purpose and commitment of resources as are now
lavished upon the war.
The responsibility for war is shared by all who take
part in the governing of their fellow men. We affirm
the duty of each citizen in the United States to ques
tion with public officials the morality of continuing
military intervention in Vietnam.
9 We will encourage public discussion of applying
the concept of conscientious objection to violation
of international law and crimes against humanity. As
individuals and as an organization we will explore the
implications for ourselves of this kind of extension and
examine its relationship to such questions as conscien
tious refusal to pay taxes for war.
If a mature body of meaningful international law is
to be realized it must be rooted in principle that is
respected even in time of war. One side in a dispute
cannot excuse its excesses by pointing to the wrongful
acts of the other side, and individuals must recognize
that there are limits to their duty to carry out the orders
of other men.
Gilbert White, Chairman of the Board

We welcome ell who will join us in these endeavors, whether their commitment is expressed through their own acts or
through g :f ts of money or service to the American Friends Service Committee or any other organization similarly witnessing
against the war. We seek the rebirth of society and in this there is room for all.
Believing that war is contrary to the will of God, the Board of
Directors of the American Friends Service Committee authorized
earlier this year the publication of an analysis of the Vietnam war under
the title Peace in Vie'nam. Today we feel impelled to speak again
about American involvement, not only because of the deepening tragedy
of the war itself but also because of its dangerous impact on crucial
aspects of American life. Our committee is deeply involved in the
struggle in the United States against poverty, racial division, and un
equal opportunities in education, housing, and livelihood. The causes
that underlie these national problems have their counterpart in the
Vietnam tragedy and in the needs and aspirations of men around the
world. As the war escalates in Vietnam, its relentless demands
require the curtailment of plans for mutual betterment and cooperation
at home. The danger of violence escalates here and elsewhere, and time
runs out.
Therefore, we are grateful for Ambassador Goldberg's formulation
before the United Nations General Assembly of the steps the United
States is prepared to take toward a peaceful settlement of the war in
Vietnam, and share the nation's hope that a positive response may yet
come from North Vietnam. We are distressed, however, that this con
ciliatory initiative was undermined by the simultaneous announcement
of a substantial increase in the planned production of United States war
planes and by resort again to massive B-52 bombing raids on North
Vietnam for the first time since May, 1966.
Moreover, beyond the negative effect of these apparently contra
dictory actions is the larger difficulty that the American proposals have
again been advanced in the context of an aggrieved party offering
generous terms to an aggressor. This context is predictably unaccept
able to Hanoi, which sees itself as the victim of unwarranted American
interference in a civil war. Thus, while both sides declare their desire

to end the lighting, both expand their military forces and both announce
their preparedness to continue the war for years. Neither credits the
other with integrity of purpose, neither has unequivocally offered to
negotiate with acknowledged representatives of all other belligerents.
Meanwhile, fighting men on both sides and the people of Vietnam suffer
and die.
When all ideological and political considerations, all questions of
prestige and commitment, of deeds and misdeeds, have been weighed in
the balance, the fact remains that this open-ended agony is an affront
to human dignity and a blow to human progress. The AFSC refuses to
accept war as the arbiter of men's lives; we deny that it has moral
authority. Yet in the absence of a conciliatory response to Ambassador
Goldberg's proposals, we fear that prospects for negotiation will recede
further and a climate emerge in which continuation of the war will
become the dominant factor in national policy and the only real options
escalation or attrition.
In these grave circumstances, and to create a climate in which
negotiation among all Vietnamese parties can occur, we call for an
immediate cessation of United States bombing and the beginning of a
clearly stated and swiftly phased withdrawal of all American troops
and weapons, with provision for sanctuary for those who might suffer
retaliation.

All war is cri.el, and modern war is particularly bar
baric. Today in Vietnam war engulfs communities in
death and destruction, and gradually reduces all
sensitivity to the suffering of others.
3 We intend to work vigorously to strengthen free
dom in America and will encourage those who are
conscientiously impelled to withh:''l their support of
of the war in Vietnam.
War demands the conscription of society and erodes
the freedom of individuals. Our nation is suffering from
this process today.
4 We will work to renew faith in a United Nations
wnose present weakness is a tragedy for all men.

War breaks down the structure of international com
munity and sets back the search for peace. Unilateral
military action by one great power that makes itself the
judge of aggression, stifles the effort to find the true
voice of a world community that is struggling to be
born. We deplore the failure of governments, including
the United States, to give consistent support to the
United Nations.
5 We will support and encourage as we are able
those young men who cannot conscientiously
accept war service in Vietnam.
War requires young men to kill and be killed. We
call on Americans to grapple with the moral issues
raised by participation in the fighting.
6 We will support our government in all efforts to
use our national brains and resources peaceably
to meet human need here, in the Mekong Valley, and
elsewhere in the world.
War misuses God's gifts to men. It subverts the
minds and skills of scientists and administrators to
produce instruments of death rather than life. All men
are required to make responsible use of mind and mat
ter. Nations rich in both must use their affluence in
constructive ways for the common good. For this rea
son we believe men may in conscience refuse to lend
their talents or their organizations to produce the plans
or materials of war.
7 We will encourage and work with religious groups
throughout America to end this war.
Religious sanction of war is a mockery. Instead of

sanctifying war it debases religion. All religious faiths
may rightly deny moral sanction to military action in
Vietnam. The American Friends Service Committee,
as a Quaker organization, denies such sanction.
8 As citizens we will in deep religious conviction
visit and encourage others to visit officers of the
Administration and members of Congress to explore the
case for withdrawal from Vietnam. We also will call
upon our fellow Americans to ready the nationaj con
science for rebuilding in Vietnam what our nation is
now engaged in destroying, with the same intensity of
purpose and commitment of resources as are now
lavished upon the war.
The responsibility for war is shared by all who take
part in the governing of their fellow men. We affirm
the duty of each citizen in the United States to ques
tion with public officials the morality of continuing
military intervention in Vietnam.
9 We will encourage public discussion of applying
the concept of conscientious objection to violation
of international law and crimes against humanity. As
individuals and as an organization we will explore the
implications for ourselves of this kind of extension and
examine its relationship to such questions as conscien
tious refusal to pay taxes for war.
If a mature body of meaningful international law is
to be realized it must be rooted in principle that is
respected even in time of war. One side in a dispute
cannot excuse its excesses by pointing to the wrongful
acts of the other side, and individuals must recognize
that there are limits to their duty to carry out the orders
of other men.
Gilbert White, Chairman of the Board

We welcome ell who will join us in these endeavors, whether their commitment is expressed through their own acts or
through g :f ts of money or service to the American Friends Service Committee or any other organization similarly witnessing
against the war. We seek the rebirth of society and in this there is room for all.
Believing that war is contrary to the will of God, the Board of
Directors of the American Friends Service Committee authorized
earlier this year the publication of an analysis of the Vietnam war under
the title Peace in Vie'nam. Today we feel impelled to speak again
about American involvement, not only because of the deepening tragedy
of the war itself but also because of its dangerous impact on crucial
aspects of American life. Our committee is deeply involved in the
struggle in the United States against poverty, racial division, and un
equal opportunities in education, housing, and livelihood. The causes
that underlie these national problems have their counterpart in the
Vietnam tragedy and in the needs and aspirations of men around the
world. As the war escalates in Vietnam, its relentless demands
require the curtailment of plans for mutual betterment and cooperation
at home. The danger of violence escalates here and elsewhere, and time
runs out.
Therefore, we are grateful for Ambassador Goldberg's formulation
before the United Nations General Assembly of the steps the United
States is prepared to take toward a peaceful settlement of the war in
Vietnam, and share the nation's hope that a positive response may yet
come from North Vietnam. We are distressed, however, that this con
ciliatory initiative was undermined by the simultaneous announcement
of a substantial increase in the planned production of United States war
planes and by resort again to massive B-52 bombing raids on North
Vietnam for the first time since May, 1966.
Moreover, beyond the negative effect of these apparently contra
dictory actions is the larger difficulty that the American proposals have
again been advanced in the context of an aggrieved party offering
generous terms to an aggressor. This context is predictably unaccept
able to Hanoi, which sees itself as the victim of unwarranted American
interference in a civil war. Thus, while both sides declare their desire

to end the lighting, both expand their military forces and both announce
their preparedness to continue the war for years. Neither credits the
other with integrity of purpose, neither has unequivocally offered to
negotiate with acknowledged representatives of all other belligerents.
Meanwhile, fighting men on both sides and the people of Vietnam suffer
and die.
When all ideological and political considerations, all questions of
prestige and commitment, of deeds and misdeeds, have been weighed in
the balance, the fact remains that this open-ended agony is an affront
to human dignity and a blow to human progress. The AFSC refuses to
accept war as the arbiter of men's lives; we deny that it has moral
authority. Yet in the absence of a conciliatory response to Ambassador
Goldberg's proposals, we fear that prospects for negotiation will recede
further and a climate emerge in which continuation of the war will
become the dominant factor in national policy and the only real options
escalation or attrition.
In these grave circumstances, and to create a climate in which
negotiation among all Vietnamese parties can occur, we call for an
immediate cessation of United States bombing and the beginning of a
clearly stated and swiftly phased withdrawal of all American troops
and weapons, with provision for sanctuary for those who might suffer
retaliation.
We hold that the United States, which has led in measures to esca
late the war, has primary responsibility to go beyond proposals that
depend for their implementation on the activities of others. We do not
pretend that such measures will suddenly heal the deep wounds of the
past or lead to a prompt end of the problems of Vietnam. All we assert
is that the certain agony of continued war is intolerable, and that the
way out lies in United States action to end it.

Because we believe this is the right course for us to urge, the American Friends Service Committee proposes to undertake the following:

â– M We are going to draw heavily on the modest re
sources of the American Friends Service Commit
tee and are taxing ourselves individually in order to do
more for peace in Vietnam.
We feel impelled to do so when faced wi'h the plight
of the Vietnamese, the damage being done to the
United States, and the peril to our own souls if we
assent to the crushing of this small and distant nation
to serve what we believe to be a misconceplion of our
national interest.
2 Though we directly oppose the war itself, we will
do all vva can to increase our humanitarian efforts.
We have persons working now among war sufferers in
South Vietnam, and we seek to do likewise in North
Vietnam and in territories held by the National Libera
tion Front.

death and destruction, and gradually reduces all
