# Overseas Campuses
## 
### 
The Martindale Report, prepared last spring
by an ad hoc committee of the Overseas Cam
pus Board, was the first student attempt to
institutionalize constructive criticism of the
program. As a result of the Report the Gen
eral Studies Committee, which determines pol
icy for the program, has established a subcom
mittee to deal specifically with foreign cam
puses. Three students, all alumni of the pro
gram, are seated on the subcommittee.
While incorporation of student views in policy
formulation is indeed encouraging, the subcom
mittee apparently is not planning a full consid
eration of the Martindale Report. Difficulties at
the Austrian campus and a poll taken by The
Daily among members of two returning France
and Italy groups indicate that local and curric
ular problems outlined in the Report deserve
immediate consideration.
With the directors of the foreign campuses
meeting next month in Florence it is relevant
to review some of the findings presented in the
Martindale Report. Of particular concern were
the states of student-community relations at
some campuses and the rigidity in campus pro
grams imposed by centralization in the Overseas
Campus Office. Both of these matters should be
on the agenda at the directors meeting.
Curricular changes, however, fall under the
jurisdiction of the full General Studies Commit

tee. The reduction of the present sixteen unit
course load to fourteen, suggested by the Re
port, found enthusiasm in The Daily poll. The
elimination of the civilization courses, the op
portunity for alternative course selections, and
the possibility for independent work are pro
posals which can strengthen the academic ex
perience at the foreign campus. Unfortunately
the curriculum proposals have met the same
inattention besetting the recent student report
of senior colloquia.
More basic than any specific change is the
need to define the goals of the overseas pro
gram. The addition of two campuses last year
now allow a majority of Stanford graduates to
attend a foreign campus. The problems at the
new centers have shown that expansion based
upon a vague, general philosophy of "European
experience" will not insure the most fruitful edu
cational situation. The Report's contention that
the program ought to maintain a national em
phasis shows an awareness of the problems and
advantages of each campus which must be re
flected in the overall philosophy of the program
and in the management of each campus.
We suggest the directors of the overseas cam
puses and the members of the General Studies
subcommittee reacquaint themselves with the
Martin dale Report as they begin to grapple with
measures to improve the program.
