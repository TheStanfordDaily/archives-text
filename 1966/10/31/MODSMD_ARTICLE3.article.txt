## 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
Elections to select next year's Head
Yell Leader will be held today and
tomorrow at Engineering Corner,
Post Office, and Tresidder.
Tuesday will mark the first time in
undergraduate history that Stanford
has selected a Homecoming Queen
and two princesses to take an in
tegral part in Homecoming.
Each of the three candidates for
Head Yell Leader is optimistic , oV >out
his chances of election and satisfied

with his campaign thus far.
Craig Brown, a pre-med student and
junior from Alpha Sigma Phi, lists
as his goal making "yell leading more
responsible." Since the yell leader is
in front of such large crowds, he feels
it is a very important position.
Brown emphasized that while he
doesn't "particularly care for gross
yells", he would like to see clever
yell 6 which show the players that the
school is supporting them. One way
of doing this would be to have the

"fantastic spirit" of the Stanford
spirit teams co-ordinated.
Rallies at Rickey's Hyatt House on
Friday nights would also promote
spirit, according to Brown. Finally,
he would like to see the spirit follow
the team when they play away from
home, such as the UCLA game this
year.
Bruce Braden, who is a junior in
history and a member of the Theta
Delta Chi house, feels that Stanford
could have the spirit of the Big Team

games with new and different yells
as well.
A basketball player until this year,
he says he has seen the effect that
serious cheers can have on a team.
He adds, "I don't think that it takes
a winning team to get excited."
The enthusiasm of the cheer leader,
according to Braden, can't replace the
spirit of two-way co-operation be
tween the crowd and the cheer leader.
The third candidate, Dick Marshall,
has nicknamed himself "The Flamer"
to draw attention to his desire to
spark spirit.
Among his goals, Marshall lists
more publicity for the minor sports
and total involvement of the Pom Pon
Dollies and the cheer leaders in the
"spirit machine".
Not only would he like to see people
leave games with a "sore throat"
from yelling, but a sense of pride in
Stanford which would give the team
the desire to win.
The election of the Queen and Prin
cesses will be part of the activities
planned for this year's non-confer
ence game against Air Force this
Saturday. There is a possibility that
the game and the judging of the
crepe paper, chicken wire, and wood
en beam decorations in front of the
Row Houses will be televised.
At half-time during the game, the
Queen will present trophies for the
following categories: humor, theme,
originality and the Queen's Sweep
stakes. All of this will take place be
for a large crowd of alumni back for
the "first legal beer" on campus.

as his goal making "yell leading more
responsible." Since the yell leader is
in front of such large crowds, he feels
it is a very important position.
Brown emphasized that while he
doesn't "particularly care for gross
yells", he would like to see clever
yell 6 which show the players that the
school is supporting them. One way
of doing this would be to have the

"fantastic spirit" of the Stanford
spirit teams co-ordinated.
Rallies at Rickey's Hyatt House on
Friday nights would also promote
spirit, according to Brown. Finally,
he would like to see the spirit follow
the team when they play away from
home, such as the UCLA game this
year.
Bruce Braden, who is a junior in
history and a member of the Theta
Delta Chi house, feels that Stanford
could have the spirit of the Big Team

games with new and different yells
as well.
A basketball player until this year,
he says he has seen the effect that
serious cheers can have on a team.
He adds, "I don't think that it takes
a winning team to get excited."
The enthusiasm of the cheer leader,
according to Braden, can't replace the
spirit of two-way co-operation be
tween the crowd and the cheer leader.
The third candidate, Dick Marshall,
has nicknamed himself "The Flamer"
to draw attention to his desire to
spark spirit.
Among his goals, Marshall lists
more publicity for the minor sports
and total involvement of the Pom Pon
Dollies and the cheer leaders in the
"spirit machine".
Not only would he like to see people
leave games with a "sore throat"
from yelling, but a sense of pride in
Stanford which would give the team
the desire to win.
The election of the Queen and Prin
cesses will be part of the activities
planned for this year's non-confer
ence game against Air Force this
Saturday. There is a possibility that
the game and the judging of the
crepe paper, chicken wire, and wood
en beam decorations in front of the
Row Houses will be televised.
At half-time during the game, the
Queen will present trophies for the
following categories: humor, theme,
originality and the Queen's Sweep
stakes. All of this will take place be
for a large crowd of alumni back for
the "first legal beer" on campus.
Elections to select next year's Head
Yell Leader will be held today and
tomorrow at Engineering Corner,
Post Office, and Tresidder.
Tuesday will mark the first time in
undergraduate history that Stanford
has selected a Homecoming Queen
and two princesses to take an in
tegral part in Homecoming.
Each of the three candidates for
Head Yell Leader is optimistic , oV >out
his chances of election and satisfied

with his campaign thus far.
