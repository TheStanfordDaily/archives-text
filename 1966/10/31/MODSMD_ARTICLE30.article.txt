# Criticism Of Black Power Day
## 
### 
Editor, Th« Daily:
I am a Negro newly-arrived to
the Stanford community, so my
brief remarks might lack that
perspective of time-worn toler
ance or even the note of futility
with which my friends view the
liberal sentiments here. I simply
want to state that "Black Day"
was one of the most childish,
syrupy outbursts of liberalism
that I have ever witnessed. I
found that the "Black Fair" was
conducted with a sense of
quaintness and nonchalance akin
to that of an overseer on a south
ern plantation. I could not help
getting the impression of some
foeble relief at the Negroes hav
ing "made it" into the American
mainstream, of people welcom
ing them with open arms and
you-aren't-so-bad-after-all smiles.
Then, too, being "colored" was
a condescending gesture, to put
it mildly. Fortunately, there's a
little more involved in being "col
ored" than dark pigments and,
despite comforting myths, there
is a distinct difference which
suntans and Man Tan just can't
get at. So why not accept that
difference for what it is and
work from that knowledge? It is
that reluctance to accept unique
ness, that fear of the essential
and necessary difference, which
makes definitions and re-defini
tions of "black power" a mass
fixation.
As I left the area, I could not
help realizing that on Saturday
the Stanford community would
return to some vague normalcy
just any community after a
holiday of fun and games. Yet
such a celebration is certainly

not unique to this academic com
munity. For instance, in ghettos
people hold riots. In both cases
no important changes result
from the "celebration"; it only
makes normalcy more tolerable.
For a time.
I suggest that for the next
"Black Day" cotton should be
planted around the fountain and
everyone should gather there to
sing hymns. The same effect.
Like wow!

I have noted the various cam
pus goings-on of late with pro
found amazement. There seem
to be as many standards of be
havior as there are schools,
and what causes an explosion
one place causes the flowers to
grow in another.
At Stanford, $1600 worth of
newspapers are taken, and the
powers on campus are deliberat
ing the punishment, if any, to be
given out. Had this happened in
Berkeley, I fear the guilty par
ties would be languishing in the
local Bastille, awaiting their
trials on charges of Grand Theft.
Again, on the Farm, the stu
dent body president is waylaid
and bullied, and of course it is
too early to tell what the out
come will be re punishment.
Juding from past experience, I'd
guess the relative judgment will
be about half as severe as could
be expected over at Berkeley.
Now in The Daily, I read that
on Friday the 28th, from noon to

midnight will be devoted to giv
ing the advocates of Black Pow
er their say, with Muslims, Com
munists, et al, encouraged and
invited to join in. This is a laud
able and even vitally necessary
attitude for Stanford to take, as
I see it. But what about Berke
ley? Already breasts are being
beaten and political hay is being
made from a similar activity,
planned on a much milder scale.
Evidently, if one is to believe
Dr. Rafferty, Mr. Reagan, and
others of their political persua
sion, exposure of Cal students to
this sort of thing is corrupting,
and allowing Communists on
campus is downright treason.
Since no hue and cry has risen
about an identical activity at
Stanford, it is assumed to be en
lightening to students of private
schools, and mind-poisoning to
students of tax-supported
schools. Pardon my confusion,
but hard as I look at them, I
can't sort them out. Students all
look alike to me. I do hope some
one will step forward and point
out the reasons why one group
needs all this paternal protec
tive cloak of garbage and the
other group is assumed to be
adult enough to separate the
wheat from the chaff.
In my undergraduate days at
Berkeley, a prof made a state
ment that I'll always remember:
"Sin has nothing whatever to do
with religion, it is purely a
function of geography." How
true this seems today, at the
Northeast and Southwest of San
Francisco Bay.

Stanford, long on the proverb
ial edge of greatness, has finally
toppled over and joins Chico
State, San Jose State, and Sam
Houston Institute of Technology.
What I refer to, gentlemen, is
this homecoming queen crap.
The only effective way to pro
test this inanity is a write-in
vote for the fairest woman of
them all, Wendy G. Wonka.
Rumor has it that Wendy, if
she wins this important primary,
will be available as a write-in
for Governor too.

Regarding Joel Kugelmass'
essay of October 18 — Perhaps
what we students are asking of
the University is to be convinced
that "the Adventure of the
Mind" is not a slogan made up
by the advertising people of
Saturday Evening Post. And
perhaps we are asking that, if
the University cannot convince
us, at least we be admitted to
the power structure so that we
can participate in the work of
the real world.
Could it be that each of us
is discovering to our private
horror that Nietzsche can speak
to us only with the tongue of
Walter Kaufman, or, worse, that
not even the best of us can hope
to speak with the tongue of
Nietzsche? FRED JOHNSON

Regarding Joel Kugelmass'
essay of October 18 — Perhaps
what we students are asking of
the University is to be convinced
that "the Adventure of the
Mind" is not a slogan made up
by the advertising people of
Saturday Evening Post. And
perhaps we are asking that, if
the University cannot convince
us, at least we be admitted to
the power structure so that we
can participate in the work of
the real world.
Could it be that each of us
is discovering to our private
horror that Nietzsche can speak
to us only with the tongue of
Walter Kaufman, or, worse, that
not even the best of us can hope
to speak with the tongue of
Nietzsche? FRED JOHNSON
Editor, Th« Daily:
I am a Negro newly-arrived to
the Stanford community, so my
brief remarks might lack that
perspective of time-worn toler
ance or even the note of futility
with which my friends view the
liberal sentiments here. I simply
want to state that "Black Day"
was one of the most childish,
syrupy outbursts of liberalism
that I have ever witnessed. I
found that the "Black Fair" was
conducted with a sense of
quaintness and nonchalance akin
to that of an overseer on a south
ern plantation. I could not help
getting the impression of some
foeble relief at the Negroes hav
ing "made it" into the American
mainstream, of people welcom
ing them with open arms and
you-aren't-so-bad-after-all smiles.
Then, too, being "colored" was
a condescending gesture, to put
it mildly. Fortunately, there's a
little more involved in being "col
ored" than dark pigments and,
despite comforting myths, there
is a distinct difference which
suntans and Man Tan just can't
get at. So why not accept that
difference for what it is and
work from that knowledge? It is
that reluctance to accept unique
ness, that fear of the essential
and necessary difference, which
makes definitions and re-defini
tions of "black power" a mass
fixation.
As I left the area, I could not
help realizing that on Saturday
the Stanford community would
return to some vague normalcy
just any community after a
holiday of fun and games. Yet
such a celebration is certainly

not unique to this academic com
munity. For instance, in ghettos
people hold riots. In both cases
no important changes result
from the "celebration"; it only
makes normalcy more tolerable.
For a time.
I suggest that for the next
"Black Day" cotton should be
planted around the fountain and
everyone should gather there to
sing hymns. The same effect.
Like wow!

Regarding Joel Kugelmass'
essay of October 18 — Perhaps
what we students are asking of
the University is to be convinced
that "the Adventure of the
Mind" is not a slogan made up
by the advertising people of
Saturday Evening Post. And
perhaps we are asking that, if
the University cannot convince
us, at least we be admitted to
the power structure so that we
can participate in the work of
the real world.
Could it be that each of us
is discovering to our private
horror that Nietzsche can speak
to us only with the tongue of
Walter Kaufman, or, worse, that
not even the best of us can hope
to speak with the tongue of
Nietzsche? FRED JOHNSON
Editor, Th« Daily:
I am a Negro newly-arrived to
the Stanford community, so my
brief remarks might lack that
perspective of time-worn toler
ance or even the note of futility
with which my friends view the
liberal sentiments here. I simply
want to state that "Black Day"
was one of the most childish,
syrupy outbursts of liberalism
that I have ever witnessed. I
found that the "Black Fair" was
conducted with a sense of
quaintness and nonchalance akin
to that of an overseer on a south
ern plantation. I could not help
getting the impression of some
foeble relief at the Negroes hav
ing "made it" into the American
mainstream, of people welcom
ing them with open arms and
you-aren't-so-bad-after-all smiles.
Then, too, being "colored" was
a condescending gesture, to put
it mildly. Fortunately, there's a
little more involved in being "col
ored" than dark pigments and,
despite comforting myths, there
is a distinct difference which
suntans and Man Tan just can't
get at. So why not accept that
difference for what it is and
work from that knowledge? It is
that reluctance to accept unique
ness, that fear of the essential
and necessary difference, which
makes definitions and re-defini
tions of "black power" a mass
fixation.
As I left the area, I could not
help realizing that on Saturday
the Stanford community would
return to some vague normalcy
just any community after a
holiday of fun and games. Yet
such a celebration is certainly

not unique to this academic com
munity. For instance, in ghettos
people hold riots. In both cases
no important changes result
from the "celebration"; it only
makes normalcy more tolerable.
For a time.
I suggest that for the next
"Black Day" cotton should be
planted around the fountain and
everyone should gather there to
sing hymns. The same effect.
Like wow!

I have noted the various cam
pus goings-on of late with pro
found amazement. There seem
to be as many standards of be
havior as there are schools,
and what causes an explosion
one place causes the flowers to
grow in another.
At Stanford, $1600 worth of
newspapers are taken, and the
powers on campus are deliberat
ing the punishment, if any, to be
given out. Had this happened in
Berkeley, I fear the guilty par
ties would be languishing in the
local Bastille, awaiting their
trials on charges of Grand Theft.
Again, on the Farm, the stu
dent body president is waylaid
and bullied, and of course it is
too early to tell what the out
come will be re punishment.
Juding from past experience, I'd
guess the relative judgment will
be about half as severe as could
be expected over at Berkeley.
Now in The Daily, I read that
on Friday the 28th, from noon to

midnight will be devoted to giv
ing the advocates of Black Pow
er their say, with Muslims, Com
munists, et al, encouraged and
invited to join in. This is a laud
able and even vitally necessary
attitude for Stanford to take, as
I see it. But what about Berke
ley? Already breasts are being
beaten and political hay is being
made from a similar activity,
planned on a much milder scale.
Evidently, if one is to believe
Dr. Rafferty, Mr. Reagan, and
others of their political persua
sion, exposure of Cal students to
this sort of thing is corrupting,
and allowing Communists on
campus is downright treason.
Since no hue and cry has risen
about an identical activity at
Stanford, it is assumed to be en
lightening to students of private
schools, and mind-poisoning to
students of tax-supported
schools. Pardon my confusion,
but hard as I look at them, I
can't sort them out. Students all
look alike to me. I do hope some
one will step forward and point
out the reasons why one group
needs all this paternal protec
tive cloak of garbage and the
other group is assumed to be
adult enough to separate the
wheat from the chaff.
In my undergraduate days at
Berkeley, a prof made a state
ment that I'll always remember:
"Sin has nothing whatever to do
with religion, it is purely a
function of geography." How
true this seems today, at the
Northeast and Southwest of San
Francisco Bay.
