## View On The Value Of Russian Respect 
### William F. Buckley, Jr 
It is the thesis of the roman
tics that among the highest tolls
we are paying in Vietnam is the
loss of the confidence of the Rus
sians, the loss of a great histor
ical opportunity to strike a de
tente with the Soviet Union and
march hand in hand with her
toward the happy horizons of
time. No doubt because he is
aware of that criticism, the
President in a recent address to
the newspaper editorial writers
stressed and restressed his de
sire for happier relations with
the Soviet Union, and there is
talk of even more cultural ex
change, of even more trade, of
adopting the consular treaty the
Soviet Union covets—anything
at all to persuade the Soviet
Union of our good intentions.
One wonders what it is that
"good" intentions are; and why
it is that we feel the need to
court the respect of the Soviet
government. A "good" intention
as far as the Soviet world is con
cerned, is a resolution by the
United States not to stand in the

way of any Communist enterprise
anywhere on earth, whether mil
itary as in Vietnam, colonialist
as in Cuba, economic as in East
Europe, or polemical as in the
New York City Worker.
Worst Intentions
U.S. intentions are, by the
Communist vocabulary, at their
very worst when we send Ameri
can troops physically to resist a
"war of national liberation," and
the Soviet press has never
ceased to thunder against us
over the issue of Vietnam. What
many American analysts are
underestimating is the inverse
factor between Soviet rhetoric
and Soviet aggressiveness.
When she thunders most, she
tends to agitate least. Because,
from time to time, she has come
up against Western resolution:
as in Greece after the war, and
subsequently in Korea, in the
Formosan Straits, in Berlin and
in Cuba. Good intentions, by the
Western definition, are, or
should be, to show a mailed fist
whenever and wherever the Sov
iet Union coils to strike a
salient.
Debate
Now if the debate were to be
on the topic, "How Should the
United States Deal with the
Soviet Union, a Liberal and a
Conservative View of United
States Responsibility to World
Freedom," I said to Mr. Lomax,
that would be different, and I
would be glad to engage in such
debate before the students of
the University of Moscow. I
never heard again from Mr. L.;
though it may be that the ad
verse decision was not his, but
Moscow's. Soviet authorities are
about as anxious to sponsor a
discussion of Soviet freedom be
fore Soviet students as mission
aries in the Congo would be to
sponsor a lecture to the local
gentry on the delights of human
flesh.
It may be that in the years
ahead we shall combine with
Russia, for some purpose or
other—after all, we did just that
a quarter of a century ago. The
historian John Lukacs has said
sweepingly that the most sig
nificant datum of the first half
of the twentieth century is that
the United States was an En
glish speaking country, and that
the most significant datum of
the second half of the twentieth
century will prove to be that the
Russians have white skins. May
be such cultural and ethnic affin
ities as these will in due course
transcend the sundering philo
sophical differences.
But if so, why not wait and let
it happen, and meanwhile hang
on to right reason by informing
the Soviet Union that her own
solidarity with the Communist
imperialists of Southeast Asia
reminds us once again of her
bloody past and her bloody com
mitments, and that at least for
the duration of the Vietnam war
they can take their consuls and
their ballet and go jump in the
lake. Maybe Mr. Lomax would
be willing to act as emissary.
