# Austria II Students Criticize Poor Orientation
## 
### CHARLOTTE ACKERLEY (Third in a series) 
Most of the students from Austria
II attribute much of the discontent
in their session to a poor orientation
program, but they say such problems
are probably peculiar to new over
seas campuses.
"During orientation," commented
Bruce Esterline, "everybody makes
you think you're going on a paid vaca
tion to Europe. They say you'll be
graded on an A-B curve so don't worry
too much about grades."
'They tell you to travel and soak
up the European experience. We took
their advice, left for the first couple
of weekends and didn't worry about
studying."
'Then," he added, "we returned for
midterms and the boom really fell."
According to Esterline many of the
students received D's and F's on the
midterms.
Reading Courses
"Our courses had a tremendous
amount of reading," explained Anne
Castro, "and some outstanding pro
fessors taught them. I think they con
sidered it an affront to their dignity
to lessen the load for us."
"We had the best group of pro
fessors," agreed Larry Brook, "some
of them tops in their field. They were
really harassed by our complaints."
Four required courses offered dur
ing the two quarters of Austria II
were considered heavy reading
courses: Psychological Conceptions of
Man (Hastorf); The Development of
the Short Story (Stegner); Reforma

tion History (Spitz); The Novel
(Scocroft). These were given in addi
tion to intensive German.
Study, Not Travel
"We really had to study hard to
keep up," commented Esterline. "Now
the fact that we had to study isn't
really the problem. But we ought
to know before we go over that we'll
be studying and not traveling."
fhe students also complained that
the courses offered had little to do
with Austria. "Living right close to
one of the cultural centers of the
world, you'd expect some courses in
art or music," said Miss Castro. "Most
of the other groups had that sort of
thing."
There was also some disappoint
ment with the German program. "The
Lohnes-Strothmann text is very good
for the Stanford Campus," said Ester
line. "But," he pointed out, "it's de
signed to improve reading and writ
ing ability, and it's ridiculous to spend
six months in Austria without get
ting a chance to improve conversa
tion."
Changes Made
According to summer session presi
dent Alan Schmidt, several students
approached the director about the
German problem and some changes
were made in the language program.
Many of the students noted specific
areas where the orientation program
had been misleading. Almost all had
been under the impression that week
day travel to Vienna would be rela
tively easy, and were disappointed
when they found a round-trip on the
train cost four dollars and took nearly
two hours.
"I wish they would have told us
that you can't get as far as you think
you can in Europe," said Esterline.
"Of course it's not their fault that
we bit off more than we could chew,
but since the emphasis is on travel,
we didn't realize the trips we were
planning were too long."
Living With Americans
"The experience isn't really Euro
pean as you are lead to expect," said
Miss Castro. "It's the experience of
living with eighty other American
students. They should just be honest

and tell you it's a place to get away
from Stanford and hear new ideas.
"And we expected to be living like
Americans, not Austrians," she went
on. This situation caused disrespect
on our side, for when we got there
they didn't understand why we didn't
conform to Austrian standards."
In general, the orientation problem
seemed to be a consequence of the
newness of the Austrian campus.
Neither Austria I or II had the stand
ard orientation given to other groups.
According to Warren Yyons, Presi
dent of Austria I, they were con
ducted by members of German groups
who had traveled to Vienna.
Guests, Not Residents
"We were speaking with people
who had gone over and been in the
hotel as guests, not residents," com
mented Lyons. 'They were naturally
treated differently than the students
would be.
"We had a somewhat superficial
orientation; they showed us a beauti
ful picture of the grand dining room.
The atmosphere was one of plushness
—and certainly the Hotel Panhans
is plush.
"Sure, the students went there and
started to notice the nicks in the paint
and were disillusioned a little. But
the same thing happens in Wilbur
every year.
"I hardly advocate closing the place
because of it,"he said.
Britain Problem
Students from the first two Britain
Sessions had the same complaints
about orientation procedures as the
Austrian group.
"Dr. Walker is so enthusiastic
about his own program," commented
Alan McAllister, "that he makes the
campuses sound fantastic. My im
pression was that we were going to
a fairyland castle, but we found our
selves isolated in a grotesque build
ing in a middle-sized community
where there was no contact with
other students."
According to Terry Ryan, the Brit
ain students were isolated on a num
ber of technical aspects of Harlaxton
Manor. "We were told there were
washing machines," she said, "but
there weren't any.

"They said we had central heating,
but you froze in one part of the
manor and burned in another part."
"The overseas campuses could be
so Utopian," commented McAllister,
"and they give you that impression
in orientation. But they're not Utop
ian."
"They should either tell you noth
ing about the campuses or every
thing," said Miss Ryan.
Although most of the Britain and
Austria students are willing to dis
miss what they considered a poor
orientation program because of the
newness of their campuses, several
students from other groups have com
mented that orientation could be im
proved for all sessions.
"You go over there completely
blind," said Ralph Williamson. "By

the time you get used to it, it's time
to come home."
Hostel Useless
"The hostel was nice," commented
Pell Fender of France IX "because
the people got to know each other.
It was entertaining but useless.
"No matter what they tell you," he
went on, "things change. And I might
add that the election of officers was
absurd."
"You have a lot to put up with
no matter what," said Bob Gulliver,
president of Germany XV. "You have
to have a sense of humor and group
spirit or there'll be tension."

—from both students and professors
—to all the previous articles.)

Students from the first two Britain
Sessions had the same complaints
about orientation procedures as the
Austrian group.
"Dr. Walker is so enthusiastic
about his own program," commented
Alan McAllister, "that he makes the
campuses sound fantastic. My im
pression was that we were going to
a fairyland castle, but we found our
selves isolated in a grotesque build
ing in a middle-sized community
where there was no contact with
other students."
According to Terry Ryan, the Brit
ain students were isolated on a num
ber of technical aspects of Harlaxton
Manor. "We were told there were
washing machines," she said, "but
there weren't any.

"They said we had central heating,
but you froze in one part of the
manor and burned in another part."
"The overseas campuses could be
so Utopian," commented McAllister,
"and they give you that impression
in orientation. But they're not Utop
ian."
"They should either tell you noth
ing about the campuses or every
thing," said Miss Ryan.
Although most of the Britain and
Austria students are willing to dis
miss what they considered a poor
orientation program because of the
newness of their campuses, several
students from other groups have com
mented that orientation could be im
proved for all sessions.
"You go over there completely
blind," said Ralph Williamson. "By

the time you get used to it, it's time
to come home."
Hostel Useless
"The hostel was nice," commented
Pell Fender of France IX "because
the people got to know each other.
It was entertaining but useless.
"No matter what they tell you," he
went on, "things change. And I might
add that the election of officers was
absurd."
"You have a lot to put up with
no matter what," said Bob Gulliver,
president of Germany XV. "You have
to have a sense of humor and group
spirit or there'll be tension."
(Editor's note: The last article of
this series will deal with the reactions
—from both students and professors
—to all the previous articles.)
Most of the students from Austria
II attribute much of the discontent
in their session to a poor orientation
program, but they say such problems
are probably peculiar to new over
seas campuses.
"During orientation," commented
Bruce Esterline, "everybody makes
you think you're going on a paid vaca
tion to Europe. They say you'll be
graded on an A-B curve so don't worry
too much about grades."
'They tell you to travel and soak
up the European experience. We took
their advice, left for the first couple
of weekends and didn't worry about
studying."
'Then," he added, "we returned for
midterms and the boom really fell."
According to Esterline many of the
students received D's and F's on the
midterms.
Reading Courses
"Our courses had a tremendous
amount of reading," explained Anne
Castro, "and some outstanding pro
fessors taught them. I think they con
sidered it an affront to their dignity
to lessen the load for us."
"We had the best group of pro
fessors," agreed Larry Brook, "some
of them tops in their field. They were
really harassed by our complaints."
Four required courses offered dur
ing the two quarters of Austria II
were considered heavy reading
courses: Psychological Conceptions of
Man (Hastorf); The Development of
the Short Story (Stegner); Reforma

tion History (Spitz); The Novel
(Scocroft). These were given in addi
tion to intensive German.
Study, Not Travel
"We really had to study hard to
keep up," commented Esterline. "Now
the fact that we had to study isn't
really the problem. But we ought
to know before we go over that we'll
be studying and not traveling."
fhe students also complained that
the courses offered had little to do
with Austria. "Living right close to
one of the cultural centers of the
world, you'd expect some courses in
art or music," said Miss Castro. "Most
of the other groups had that sort of
thing."
There was also some disappoint
ment with the German program. "The
Lohnes-Strothmann text is very good
for the Stanford Campus," said Ester
line. "But," he pointed out, "it's de
signed to improve reading and writ
ing ability, and it's ridiculous to spend
six months in Austria without get
ting a chance to improve conversa
tion."
Changes Made
According to summer session presi
dent Alan Schmidt, several students
approached the director about the
German problem and some changes
were made in the language program.
Many of the students noted specific
areas where the orientation program
had been misleading. Almost all had
been under the impression that week
day travel to Vienna would be rela
tively easy, and were disappointed
when they found a round-trip on the
train cost four dollars and took nearly
two hours.
"I wish they would have told us
that you can't get as far as you think
you can in Europe," said Esterline.
"Of course it's not their fault that
we bit off more than we could chew,
but since the emphasis is on travel,
we didn't realize the trips we were
planning were too long."
Living With Americans
"The experience isn't really Euro
pean as you are lead to expect," said
Miss Castro. "It's the experience of
living with eighty other American
students. They should just be honest

and tell you it's a place to get away
from Stanford and hear new ideas.
"And we expected to be living like
Americans, not Austrians," she went
on. This situation caused disrespect
on our side, for when we got there
they didn't understand why we didn't
conform to Austrian standards."
In general, the orientation problem
seemed to be a consequence of the
newness of the Austrian campus.
Neither Austria I or II had the stand
ard orientation given to other groups.
According to Warren Yyons, Presi
dent of Austria I, they were con
ducted by members of German groups
who had traveled to Vienna.
Guests, Not Residents
"We were speaking with people
who had gone over and been in the
hotel as guests, not residents," com
mented Lyons. 'They were naturally
treated differently than the students
would be.
"We had a somewhat superficial
orientation; they showed us a beauti
ful picture of the grand dining room.
The atmosphere was one of plushness
—and certainly the Hotel Panhans
is plush.
"Sure, the students went there and
started to notice the nicks in the paint
and were disillusioned a little. But
the same thing happens in Wilbur
every year.
"I hardly advocate closing the place
because of it,"he said.

day travel to Vienna would be rela
tively easy, and were disappointed
when they found a round-trip on the
train cost four dollars and took nearly
two hours.
"I wish they would have told us
that you can't get as far as you think
you can in Europe," said Esterline.
"Of course it's not their fault that
we bit off more than we could chew,
but since the emphasis is on travel,
we didn't realize the trips we were
planning were too long."
Living With Americans
"The experience isn't really Euro
pean as you are lead to expect," said
Miss Castro. "It's the experience of
living with eighty other American
students. They should just be honest

and tell you it's a place to get away
from Stanford and hear new ideas.
"And we expected to be living like
Americans, not Austrians," she went
on. This situation caused disrespect
on our side, for when we got there
they didn't understand why we didn't
conform to Austrian standards."
In general, the orientation problem
seemed to be a consequence of the
newness of the Austrian campus.
Neither Austria I or II had the stand
ard orientation given to other groups.
According to Warren Yyons, Presi
dent of Austria I, they were con
ducted by members of German groups
who had traveled to Vienna.
Guests, Not Residents
"We were speaking with people
who had gone over and been in the
hotel as guests, not residents," com
mented Lyons. 'They were naturally
treated differently than the students
would be.
"We had a somewhat superficial
orientation; they showed us a beauti
ful picture of the grand dining room.
The atmosphere was one of plushness
—and certainly the Hotel Panhans
is plush.
"Sure, the students went there and
started to notice the nicks in the paint
and were disillusioned a little. But
the same thing happens in Wilbur
every year.
"I hardly advocate closing the place
because of it,"he said.
Britain Problem
Students from the first two Britain
Sessions had the same complaints
about orientation procedures as the
Austrian group.
"Dr. Walker is so enthusiastic
about his own program," commented
Alan McAllister, "that he makes the
campuses sound fantastic. My im
pression was that we were going to
a fairyland castle, but we found our
selves isolated in a grotesque build
ing in a middle-sized community
where there was no contact with
other students."
According to Terry Ryan, the Brit
ain students were isolated on a num
ber of technical aspects of Harlaxton
Manor. "We were told there were
washing machines," she said, "but
there weren't any.

"They said we had central heating,
but you froze in one part of the
manor and burned in another part."
"The overseas campuses could be
so Utopian," commented McAllister,
"and they give you that impression
in orientation. But they're not Utop
ian."
"They should either tell you noth
ing about the campuses or every
thing," said Miss Ryan.
Although most of the Britain and
Austria students are willing to dis
miss what they considered a poor
orientation program because of the
newness of their campuses, several
students from other groups have com
mented that orientation could be im
proved for all sessions.
"You go over there completely
blind," said Ralph Williamson. "By

the time you get used to it, it's time
to come home."
Hostel Useless
"The hostel was nice," commented
Pell Fender of France IX "because
the people got to know each other.
It was entertaining but useless.
"No matter what they tell you," he
went on, "things change. And I might
add that the election of officers was
absurd."
"You have a lot to put up with
no matter what," said Bob Gulliver,
president of Germany XV. "You have
to have a sense of humor and group
spirit or there'll be tension."
(Editor's note: The last article of
this series will deal with the reactions
—from both students and professors
—to all the previous articles.)
Most of the students from Austria
II attribute much of the discontent
in their session to a poor orientation
program, but they say such problems
are probably peculiar to new over
seas campuses.
"During orientation," commented
Bruce Esterline, "everybody makes
you think you're going on a paid vaca
tion to Europe. They say you'll be
graded on an A-B curve so don't worry
too much about grades."
'They tell you to travel and soak
up the European experience. We took
their advice, left for the first couple
of weekends and didn't worry about
studying."
'Then," he added, "we returned for
midterms and the boom really fell."
According to Esterline many of the
students received D's and F's on the
midterms.
Reading Courses
"Our courses had a tremendous
amount of reading," explained Anne
Castro, "and some outstanding pro
fessors taught them. I think they con
sidered it an affront to their dignity
to lessen the load for us."
"We had the best group of pro
fessors," agreed Larry Brook, "some
of them tops in their field. They were
really harassed by our complaints."
Four required courses offered dur
ing the two quarters of Austria II
were considered heavy reading
courses: Psychological Conceptions of
Man (Hastorf); The Development of
the Short Story (Stegner); Reforma

tion History (Spitz); The Novel
(Scocroft). These were given in addi
tion to intensive German.
Study, Not Travel
"We really had to study hard to
keep up," commented Esterline. "Now
the fact that we had to study isn't
really the problem. But we ought
to know before we go over that we'll
be studying and not traveling."
fhe students also complained that
the courses offered had little to do
with Austria. "Living right close to
one of the cultural centers of the
world, you'd expect some courses in
art or music," said Miss Castro. "Most
of the other groups had that sort of
thing."
There was also some disappoint
ment with the German program. "The
Lohnes-Strothmann text is very good
for the Stanford Campus," said Ester
line. "But," he pointed out, "it's de
signed to improve reading and writ
ing ability, and it's ridiculous to spend
six months in Austria without get
ting a chance to improve conversa
tion."
Changes Made
According to summer session presi
dent Alan Schmidt, several students
approached the director about the
German problem and some changes
were made in the language program.
Many of the students noted specific
areas where the orientation program
had been misleading. Almost all had
been under the impression that week
day travel to Vienna would be rela
tively easy, and were disappointed
when they found a round-trip on the

midterms and the boom really fell."
According to Esterline many of the
students received D's and F's on the
midterms.
Reading Courses
"Our courses had a tremendous
amount of reading," explained Anne
Castro, "and some outstanding pro
fessors taught them. I think they con
sidered it an affront to their dignity
to lessen the load for us."
"We had the best group of pro
fessors," agreed Larry Brook, "some
of them tops in their field. They were
really harassed by our complaints."
Four required courses offered dur
ing the two quarters of Austria II
were considered heavy reading
courses: Psychological Conceptions of
Man (Hastorf); The Development of
the Short Story (Stegner); Reforma

tion History (Spitz); The Novel
(Scocroft). These were given in addi
tion to intensive German.
Study, Not Travel
"We really had to study hard to
keep up," commented Esterline. "Now
the fact that we had to study isn't
really the problem. But we ought
to know before we go over that we'll
be studying and not traveling."
fhe students also complained that
the courses offered had little to do
with Austria. "Living right close to
one of the cultural centers of the
world, you'd expect some courses in
art or music," said Miss Castro. "Most
of the other groups had that sort of
thing."
There was also some disappoint
ment with the German program. "The
Lohnes-Strothmann text is very good
for the Stanford Campus," said Ester
line. "But," he pointed out, "it's de
signed to improve reading and writ
ing ability, and it's ridiculous to spend
six months in Austria without get
ting a chance to improve conversa
tion."
Changes Made
According to summer session presi
dent Alan Schmidt, several students
approached the director about the
German problem and some changes
were made in the language program.
Many of the students noted specific
areas where the orientation program
had been misleading. Almost all had
been under the impression that week
day travel to Vienna would be rela
tively easy, and were disappointed
when they found a round-trip on the
train cost four dollars and took nearly
two hours.
"I wish they would have told us
that you can't get as far as you think
you can in Europe," said Esterline.
"Of course it's not their fault that
we bit off more than we could chew,
but since the emphasis is on travel,
we didn't realize the trips we were
planning were too long."
Living With Americans
"The experience isn't really Euro
pean as you are lead to expect," said
Miss Castro. "It's the experience of
living with eighty other American
students. They should just be honest

and tell you it's a place to get away
from Stanford and hear new ideas.
"And we expected to be living like
Americans, not Austrians," she went
on. This situation caused disrespect
on our side, for when we got there
they didn't understand why we didn't
conform to Austrian standards."
In general, the orientation problem
seemed to be a consequence of the
newness of the Austrian campus.
Neither Austria I or II had the stand
ard orientation given to other groups.
According to Warren Yyons, Presi
dent of Austria I, they were con
ducted by members of German groups
who had traveled to Vienna.
Guests, Not Residents
"We were speaking with people
who had gone over and been in the
hotel as guests, not residents," com
mented Lyons. 'They were naturally
treated differently than the students
would be.
"We had a somewhat superficial
orientation; they showed us a beauti
ful picture of the grand dining room.
The atmosphere was one of plushness
—and certainly the Hotel Panhans
is plush.
"Sure, the students went there and
started to notice the nicks in the paint
and were disillusioned a little. But
the same thing happens in Wilbur
every year.
"I hardly advocate closing the place
because of it,"he said.
Britain Problem
Students from the first two Britain
Sessions had the same complaints
about orientation procedures as the
Austrian group.
"Dr. Walker is so enthusiastic
about his own program," commented
Alan McAllister, "that he makes the
campuses sound fantastic. My im
pression was that we were going to
a fairyland castle, but we found our
selves isolated in a grotesque build
ing in a middle-sized community
where there was no contact with
other students."
According to Terry Ryan, the Brit
ain students were isolated on a num
ber of technical aspects of Harlaxton
Manor. "We were told there were
washing machines," she said, "but
there weren't any.

"They said we had central heating,
but you froze in one part of the
manor and burned in another part."
"The overseas campuses could be
so Utopian," commented McAllister,
"and they give you that impression
in orientation. But they're not Utop
ian."
"They should either tell you noth
ing about the campuses or every
thing," said Miss Ryan.
Although most of the Britain and
Austria students are willing to dis
miss what they considered a poor
orientation program because of the
newness of their campuses, several
students from other groups have com
mented that orientation could be im
proved for all sessions.
"You go over there completely
blind," said Ralph Williamson. "By

the time you get used to it, it's time
to come home."
Hostel Useless
"The hostel was nice," commented
Pell Fender of France IX "because
the people got to know each other.
It was entertaining but useless.
"No matter what they tell you," he
went on, "things change. And I might
add that the election of officers was
absurd."
"You have a lot to put up with
no matter what," said Bob Gulliver,
president of Germany XV. "You have
to have a sense of humor and group
spirit or there'll be tension."
(Editor's note: The last article of
this series will deal with the reactions
—from both students and professors
—to all the previous articles.)
Most of the students from Austria
II attribute much of the discontent
in their session to a poor orientation
program, but they say such problems
are probably peculiar to new over
seas campuses.
"During orientation," commented
Bruce Esterline, "everybody makes
you think you're going on a paid vaca
tion to Europe. They say you'll be
graded on an A-B curve so don't worry
too much about grades."
'They tell you to travel and soak
up the European experience. We took
their advice, left for the first couple
of weekends and didn't worry about
studying."
'Then," he added, "we returned for
midterms and the boom really fell."
According to Esterline many of the
students received D's and F's on the
midterms.
