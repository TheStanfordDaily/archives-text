# Some Tricks For Some Treating
## 
### 
Halloween, as everyone knows, is a
vast conspiracy jointly sponsored by
the candymakers and the dentists.
Nevertheless, it is possible to outwit
these malevolent forces, either by
ignoring the whole thing, or by col
lecting so much junk you'll never
need any more. (Not until next year,
anyway.)
If you choose the latter course, here
are a few tips to guide you safely
through the night:
• If you wear a costume—as you
certainly should—be sure to wear a
mask as well. Otherwise you might be
mistaken for a peace worker or a
frat man. ,
• If you see any little kids with lots
of candy, never try to take their good
ies away from them. Little kids are
usually armed nowadays.
• If some guy refuses to give you
any candy, don't egg his windows,
chop down his shrubbery, or uproot
his prize petunias. The guy always
turns out to be the chief of police.
• Having collected a bag full of
goodies, go directly home and burn
them all. The stuff can only rot your
teeth, ruin your digestion, upset your
cholesterol count— and make you too
fat to go trick-ortreating next year.
