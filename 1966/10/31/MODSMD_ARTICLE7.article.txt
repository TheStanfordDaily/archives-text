# International Players Star In Mme Butterfly
## 
### JEFF BINGAMAN 
The first impression one gets
upon viewing the San Francisco
Opera's new production of
Madame Butterfly is that the
long sought success in interna
tional cooperation which has of
ten proven illusory in politics
and economics is a reality in the
more cultural fields.
How is the production inter
national? It is international in
the use of a Swiss designer, Toni
Businger, to help set the mood
for an American naval lieuten
ant singing in Italian of his love
for a Geisha girl in Nagasaki.
How is the new production suc
cessful? Let me count the ways.
Teresa Stratas makes her
debut with the San Francisco
Opera in the title role. Her
superb portrayal of the subtle
changes of mood through which
the Madame passes while wait
ing for, and finally confronting
the return of Lieuenant Pinker
ton is made possible by her deft
control of an excellent voice.
Dorothy Krebill
Complementing her part and
the quality of her performance
is Dorothy Krebill's portrayal of
Suzuki. Their two voices blend
beautifully and the delicate re
lationship between the two wom
en becomes apparent from the
moment of Madame Butterfly's
first encounter with Lt. Pinker
ton.
Ottavio Garaventa displays a
fine tenor voice in the part of
Lt. Pinkerton, but has difficulty
giving life to the light-hearted,

almost swaggering naval officer
whom he portrays.
Chester Ludgin takes the rela
tively minor part of Sharpless,
the U.S. Consul, and plays it in
the unobtrusive but distinctive
way the part was intended. Lug
gin's performance in this role,
when contrasted with his power
ful portrayal of Boris Gaudenov
earlier this season, demonstrates
the versatility and sensitivity
which make him consistently
one of the most outstanding per
formers in the San Francisco
Opera.
Bonze Entrance
An inevitable dramatic high
point in the opera is the en
trance of The Bonze, Madame
Butterfly's Buddhist uncle. The
October 28 performance had Clif
ford Grant in this part, substi
tuting for Federico Davia. Not
wishing to pass judgment on
Davia's earlier performance, the
substitution of Grant did any
thing but weaken the produc
tion.
Francesco Molinari - Pradelli
conducted the orchestra with
particular care to avoid the all
too frequent and understandable
error of allowing Puccini's mu
sic to overwhelm the action.
The conductor, director Na
thaniel Merrill, and designers
Toni Businger and David L.
West deserve the highest praise
for being able to add to Puc
cini's masterpiece without divert
ing attention from the opera's
true source of greatness, Its
music.

Word Of Warning
A word of warning is appro
priate for those few sophisti
cates who equate opera and
pain, and, finding Madame But
terfly relatively painless to
watch, move inevitably to the
conclusion that it is not good
opera. Stay away. This produc
tion is more low-brow than most.
Madame Butterfly will be pro
duced againn on November 3,
November 13, and November 26.
