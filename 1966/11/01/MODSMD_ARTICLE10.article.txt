Biology courses "impossible to of
fer in Jordan Hall simply because we
didn't have the facilities" will be
made possible by Stanford's new Cen
ter for the Biological Sciences, ac
cording to Professor Richard W. Holm
of the Division of Systematic Biology.
By late spring of 1967, two buildings
of the proposed three-building center
will be completed. The department
will then move from its present loca
tion in Jordan Hall to the new build
ings. Vacated space will be remodeled
for the use of the Psychology Depart
ment.
In addition to allowing more unique
courses, the new center will relieve
crowded conditions now plaguing the
department. Floor space of the first
two buildings will be 86,000 square

feet, compared to Jordan Hall's 47,000
square feet.
The third building will be occupied
after the anticipated expansion of the
department. Six new faculty members
are expected to join the staff within
the next three years.
Herrin Laboratories, the main wing
of the center, will be used for research.
The design of the building calls for
labs facing the outside, with graduate,
student, and faculty office space in
the interior. Under this plan, 16 fac
ulty members in the department are
designing their own labs, within a con
stant module size.
Zoology labs will occupy the ground
floor, and the first floor will have a
large conference room, an adminis
trative suite ,and a cellular and molec
ular studies area. The floor plan for

the second floor will be similar to that
of the first. The top floor will be used
for botany.
The basement will serve as a store
room, and temporary area for labs
of new appointments.
Advanced technological equipment
will be available for certain types of
research. One floor, for example, will
be provided with a series of growth
chambers (in which any type of en
vironment can be simulated) for pop
ulation biologists.
Herrin Hall will be a teaching build
ing, connected by decks on each of
its three levels to the research wing.
The ground floor of the teaching wing
will consist of teaching labs for in
termediate courses, a large lecture
hall seating approximately 100, and
two smaller lecture rooms, seating 50
students each.
Elementary teaching labs, occupying
the first floor, will be grouped accord
ing to biological disciplines (such as
botany and zoology).
The labs will be grouped around a
service core, where dark rooms,
growth rooms ,and constant tempera
ture rooms, as well as instructors' of
fices, will be located. They will open
onto arcades on each level, and stu
dents will enter the labs from the out
side of the building.
Labs will be equipped with the usual
facilities of hot, cold, and distilled
water, gas, electricity, and a black
board, and will also have incubators
and refrigerators.
Special equipment such as centri
fuges will be brought in for specific
experiments, and the entire building
will have prov'sions for closed-circuit
television.
The top floor will be an intradepart
mental library, including reading
rooms with comfortable chairs, and
covered reading decks outside. The
roof of the building will have a green
house, connected by a ramp to the
third floor of the research building.
Architect for the center is Milton
Pflueger, designer of the Graduate
School of Business. The project will
cost $4,774,958, and will be financed
by a contribution of $1,800,000 from
the National Science Foundation,
matched by Stanford money which
will come primarily from a trust
established for the estate of William
F. Herrin.

The new biology center across from
Math corner will have extended fa
cilities. The old biology offices will
be remodeled and later occupied by
the Psychology Department.
