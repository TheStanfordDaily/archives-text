# Frosh Take Gas
## Cal Cubs Axe Papooses, 36-7 
### BILL GRAHAM 
The freshman football team
met with its old nemises, mis
takes, as it was crushed by an
alert California eleven, 36-7, last
Saturday.
For the first quarter, the Pa
pooses looked like they had got
ten over the fumbling that cost
them their first game, as they
drove 76 yards for one touch
down and got down to Cal's four
yard line before the Cub's de
fense stiffened, on another oc
casion. But from then on, the
game belonged entirely to the
Cal frosh.

On Stanford's first drive, it
looked like the Papooses were
making use of Cal's style of of
fense, as big Don Parish and
Howard Moore hit off the tackles
to carry the team downfield. Par
ish carried the ball into the
end zone on a 24-yard gallop over
left tackle. Nick DeLurgio's kick
was good to give Stanford a 7-0
lead.
Oliver Intercepts
The little Cards found them
selves in possession of the ball
again just four plays after the
kick-off when Dick Oliver pulled
in a wayward pass from Cal

quarterback Don Wilson on Stan
ford's 34 yard-line. From here
quarterback Jim Plunkett di
rected his squad to a first down
on Cal's 12 yard-line. But here,
the Cub defense stiffened. Wil
liams carried two yards to the
ten. Parish bulled for two yards
to the eight and Moore went for
two more to the six. With fourth
down and four the frosh elected
to go for it, but Parish could get
no more than one yard and Cal
took over just before the end of
the quarter.
After exchanging punts, Stan
ford gave the Cubs their first
break when a Plunkett pass fell
into the hands of defensive back
Wally Weir who found himself
with no one between him and the
end zone seventy yards away.
John Gianaras booted the extra
point to tie the score.
Stanford's Howard Williams
dropped the kick-off which was
pounced on by Cal's Jack Har
rah on the Indian's 29-yard line.
Six plays later, halfback Steve
Metcalf dove over right tackle
from one yard out for the touch
down. Gianaras again added the
extra point.
Twin Fumbles
Stanford was again unable to
hang on to the kick-off and Cal
came up with the ball on Stan
ford's 13-yard line. But the de
fense stiffened and Cal gave
up the ball on downs. Cal soon
had another chance, however, as

Jack Alustiza fumbled after
three plays to give the Cubs the
ball back on the eleven.
It took Wilcox only two plays
to take advantage of the situa
tion. He hit Gary Fowler on a
broken pattern for ten yards, and
then packed it in himself, hitting
over right guard. The kick was
good.
Determined to give Cal an
other chance before the end of
the half, one play after the kick
off, Phil Murphy fumbled a Wil
cox pass when he was tackled
and Harrah picked it upon the
Cubs 34 yard line. From here,
Wilcox hit Jim Smith who was
several yards ahead of his near
est defender, with a beautiful
pass for a 66-yard touchdown.
The center was high on the
extra point and Gianaras was
tackled by Chuck Freeman when
he attempted to run with it. De
spited one more Stanford fum
ble, the half ended with the
score 27-7.

from the Indian 33 and Seeley
went all the way for the score.
When the Cub's offense stop
ped scoring, the defense took
over. Indian Brian Porter took
a Cal punt on the Card's two
yard line where he was downed.
On the next play, Plunkett faded
back into his own end zone to
pass. After evading one Cub
tackier, Plunkett found himself
snowed under by the whole Cal
defensive line, to give theim
their final score.

had another chance, however, as

Jack Alustiza fumbled after
three plays to give the Cubs the
ball back on the eleven.
It took Wilcox only two plays
to take advantage of the situa

broken pattern for ten yards, and
then packed it in himself, hitting

game belonged entirely to the
Cal frosh.

Wally Weir who found himself
with no one between him and the
end zone seventy yards away.
John Gianaras booted the extra
point to tie the score.
Stanford's Howard Williams
dropped the kick-off which was
pounced on by Cal's Jack Har
rah on the Indian's 29-yard line.
Six plays later, halfback Steve
Metcalf dove over right tackle
from one yard out for the touch
down. Gianaras again added the
extra point.
Twin Fumbles
Stanford was again unable to
hang on to the kick-off and Cal
came up with the ball on Stan
ford's 13-yard line. But the de
fense stiffened and Cal gave
up the ball on downs. Cal soon
had another chance, however, as

Jack Alustiza fumbled after
three plays to give the Cubs the
ball back on the eleven.
It took Wilcox only two plays
to take advantage of the situa
tion. He hit Gary Fowler on a
broken pattern for ten yards, and
then packed it in himself, hitting
over right guard. The kick was
good.
Determined to give Cal an
other chance before the end of
the half, one play after the kick
off, Phil Murphy fumbled a Wil
cox pass when he was tackled
and Harrah picked it upon the
Cubs 34 yard line. From here,
Wilcox hit Jim Smith who was
several yards ahead of his near
est defender, with a beautiful
pass for a 66-yard touchdown.
The center was high on the
extra point and Gianaras was
tackled by Chuck Freeman when
he attempted to run with it. De
spited one more Stanford fum
ble, the half ended with the
score 27-7.

Cal started off the second half
by proving they could make
their scores even without Indian
assistance. After forcing the Pa

cox hit Brien Seeley with a pass
from the Indian 33 and Seeley
went all the way for the score.
When the Cub's offense stop
ped scoring, the defense took
over. Indian Brian Porter took
a Cal punt on the Card's two
yard line where he was downed.
On the next play, Plunkett faded
back into his own end zone to
pass. After evading one Cub
tackier, Plunkett found himself
snowed under by the whole Cal
defensive line, to give theim
their final score.
The Cubs controlled the rest of
the game, although neither side
could muster a scoring drive.
