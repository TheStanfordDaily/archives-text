# Dislocation Take Grad Title; Deciding Contests This Week
## 
### 
League leaders are tested on
three fronts in intramural foot
ball this afternoon, with the Phi
Delts, defending football cham
pions, meeting Chi Psi in the
featured game. Frosh favorite
Madera faces Soto in a Wilbur
game, while eating club leader
El Toro plays third-place El
Tigre.
The Phi Delts are among sev
eral teams which stand to be
weakened by a recent "recom
mendation" on the part of the
baseball coaching staff that
members of the varsity nine re
frain from touch football com
petition. Frank Duffy, Phi Delt
quarterback and all-league short
stop, is among those affected.
The first "A" league cham
pionship was decided last week
when the Dislocations (Metal

lurgical Science) completed their
season with a 5-0 record. Certain
to be among the top-seeded
teams in the university playoffs,
the Dislocations will represent
their league along with second
place Blackacre, providing the
latter can get by the Caminos
on Thursday.
