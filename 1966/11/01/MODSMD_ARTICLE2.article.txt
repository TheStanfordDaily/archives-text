# Novelist John Barth To Explore New Realm, "Heroic University"
## 
### DICK LIVINGSTON Asst. Managing Editor 
Best-selling novelist John Barth,
whose latest book, Giles Goat-Boy, has
received a wide variety of critical ap
praisal, will speak on "The Heroical
Curriculum" today at 7:45 p.m. in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Tickets to assure seating at the lec
ture are available at the Tresidder
Box Office. There is no admission
charge. Those without tickets will be
seated after 7:35 on a "first come, first
served" basis.

Sponsored by the freshman Voice
Project of the English Department
and the Committee on Public Exer
cises, Barth will be available for con
sultation with faculty and students of
the English Department during his
two days on campus.
'One Of The Besff
A professor of English at Buffalo
State University, Barth is classed as
one of the best American novelists to
emerge since World War 11, according
to a 1965 poll of 200 authors, critics
and editors.
Barth describes Giles Goat-Boy as
a "longish story about a young man
who is raised as a goat, later learns
he's human and commits himself to
the heroic project of discovering the
secret of things."
Anne Freegood, Barth's editor, says
the novel is "set in the modern world,
or a magnificent facsimile of the mod
ern world known in the book as 'The
University.' It is like no other novel."
Far-Out Campus
Time magazine's terse evaluation of
the book is that it is "a surrealistic
puzzler—or possibly a parable—about
goatish activities on a far-out college
campus that represents the modern
world."
John Barth, now 36, has published
three novels in the last 10 years:

The Floating Opera, The End of the
Road and The Sot-Weed Factor.
In the spring of 1966 Barth received
the citation of the Creative Arts Com
mission of Brandeis University for
notable achievement in fiction. He has
also won a grant from the National
Institute of Arts and Letters.
Following the lecture tonight there
will be a reception for Barth in the
Tresidder large lounge for members
of the Stanford community.
Wednesday from 11-12 a.m. there
will be an informal coffee hour with
John Barth in the small lounge in
TMU.
