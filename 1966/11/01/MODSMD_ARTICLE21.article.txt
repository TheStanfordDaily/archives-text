(Editor's note: The following
is a statement by Jan Jacobi, co
chairman of the ASSU Housing
Commission, on the re-constitu
tion of the Commission's sub
committee on fraternities.)
"Things fall apart; the centre
cannot hold . . ." W. B. Yeats
It was my initial hope that we
could conduct an objective study
of fraternities at Stanford — but
objective within the context of
the overall work of the Housing
Commission. For the Housing
Commission was established to
examine all systems of residence
at the university critically with
in the context of Stanford as an
educational community — as a
community with the responsibil
ity and obligation to carry educa
tion from the classroom, from
the library, to the residence halls
and houses.
It has become apparent that
the subcommittee on fraternities
as presently constituted cannot
continue its work. The represen
tative of the Internfraternity
Council has imposed himself and
his organization as a barrier to
any further examination of the
fraternity system from our in
tended objective and thorough
point of view (a consideration of
the elements which compose the
fraternity system as positive or
negative factors in terms of
Stanford as an educational com
munity).
The IFC representative and his
organization have charged that
Joel Kugelmass, co-chairman of
the sub-committee on fraterni
ties, is "anti-fraternity."
I regret that they have low
ered themselves and the nature
of the dialogue to this level.
Their horizons are too narrow;
they refuse to consider the pos
sibility that an objective study
of the fraternity system could
result in recommendations to
alter drastically some of the
facets of that system. I hold this
attitude responsible for the pa
ralysis of the work of the sub
committee on fraternities last
week. The over-simplified "anti
fraternity" stereotype is one that
has been applied to Kugelmass
(and others) by those who are
unwilling to examine his views
in detail. What he opposes is
not the existence of fraternities
per se, but rather those elements
in them (as well as in other liv
ing groups) which tend to limit
the education of the individual.
If those harmful elements are
purged from the system, it would
be a matter of debate as to
whether the remaining institu
tions could still be called "fra
ternities" in the traditional sense
but the Commission has
chosen not to debate lables and
definitions, but rather principle.
Therefore, under the powers
delegated to me as co-chairman
of the ASSU Housing Commis
sion by the by-laws of the Legis
lature, I am requesting the resig
nations of the present members
of the sub-committee on fraterni
ties and am announcing my in
tention to reconstitute that com
mittee with the following ap
pointments:
David Calfee and Joel Kugel
mass (co-chairmen), Bud Car
peneti, Jim Engel, David Haken,
Mike Hughes, Chuck K a t z,
James Laney, Gene Lucero, John
Morrison, Bob O'Meally, Charlie
Price, Jon Reider, Steve Spittler,
and Tim Stanton.
I have chosen 15 members of

this community whom I feel
capable of examining all issues
related to the fraternity system
objectively and critically within
the context of education. With
the exception of one freshman,
each of these men is now or has
been a member of a fraternity.
They are to issue a preliminary
report to me on December 1, as
are the other five sub-committees
of the Commission.
As an individual, Mr. Kugel
mass may have grave reserva
tions about a number of facets
of the fraternity system, but in
accepting his appointment as
co-chairman of this reconstituted
sub-committee, he is charged
with the responsibility of open
minded objectivity.
He has issued the following
statement to me on the recon
stitution of the sub-committee:
"The affairs of any part of the
University are and should be
the affairs of the entire Univer
sity rommunity. For too long
have we all been content to go
our own ways and leave the
progress of others at the mercy
of their own imaginations. Such
isolationism destroys the com
mon denominator of education
and substitutes a silent anarchy.
"To create the long-sought
community, therefore, we must
look to education and its pro
cesses as the abiding context. I
intend that the sub-committee
which I co-chair shall enact this

view solely by examining the
fraternity structure in relation
to education.
"No other view, no other pur
pose, lurks implicitly or explicit
ly. We bare ourselves to scrutiny
as we believe the fraternities
shall bare themselves.
"We shall not isolate ourselves
by means of pre-establishing a
political commitment, just as we
shall confirm our intellectual
commitment that all students
fulfill themselves within the edu
cational process at this Univer
sity."
At this time, with the "pro-"
and "anti-fraternity" people
quickly polarizing themselves
and unable to come together in
open and meaningful dialogue,
the Housing Commission, and
especially its sub-committee on
fraternities, is aiming on a small
scale to fill a role not unlike that
of the late Dag Hammarskjold's
as he described his position as
Secretary-General of the United
Nations:
"In the last analysis, it is a
question of integrity, and if in
tegrity in the sense of respect
for law and respect for truth
were to drive [the Secretary-
General] into positions of con
flict with this or that interest—
then that conflict is a sign of his
neutrality and not his failure
to observe neutrality . . ."
It is with this spirit that we
continue our work.

this community whom I feel
capable of examining all issues
related to the fraternity system
objectively and critically within
the context of education. With
the exception of one freshman,
each of these men is now or has
been a member of a fraternity.
They are to issue a preliminary
report to me on December 1, as
are the other five sub-committees
of the Commission.
As an individual, Mr. Kugel
mass may have grave reserva
tions about a number of facets
of the fraternity system, but in
accepting his appointment as
co-chairman of this reconstituted
sub-committee, he is charged
with the responsibility of open
minded objectivity.
He has issued the following
statement to me on the recon
stitution of the sub-committee:
"The affairs of any part of the
University are and should be
the affairs of the entire Univer
sity rommunity. For too long
have we all been content to go
our own ways and leave the
progress of others at the mercy
of their own imaginations. Such
isolationism destroys the com
mon denominator of education
and substitutes a silent anarchy.
"To create the long-sought
community, therefore, we must
look to education and its pro
cesses as the abiding context. I
intend that the sub-committee
which I co-chair shall enact this

view solely by examining the
fraternity structure in relation
to education.
"No other view, no other pur
pose, lurks implicitly or explicit
ly. We bare ourselves to scrutiny
as we believe the fraternities
shall bare themselves.
"We shall not isolate ourselves
by means of pre-establishing a
political commitment, just as we
shall confirm our intellectual
commitment that all students
fulfill themselves within the edu
cational process at this Univer
sity."
At this time, with the "pro-"
and "anti-fraternity" people
quickly polarizing themselves
and unable to come together in
open and meaningful dialogue,
the Housing Commission, and
especially its sub-committee on
fraternities, is aiming on a small
scale to fill a role not unlike that
of the late Dag Hammarskjold's
as he described his position as
Secretary-General of the United
Nations:
"In the last analysis, it is a
question of integrity, and if in
tegrity in the sense of respect
for law and respect for truth
were to drive [the Secretary-
General] into positions of con
flict with this or that interest—
then that conflict is a sign of his
neutrality and not his failure
to observe neutrality . . ."
It is with this spirit that we
continue our work.

Commission, on the re-constitu

committee on fraternities.)

It was my initial hope that we
could conduct an objective study
of fraternities at Stanford — but
objective within the context of
the overall work of the Housing
Commission. For the Housing
Commission was established to
examine all systems of residence
at the university critically with
in the context of Stanford as an
educational community — as a
community with the responsibil
ity and obligation to carry educa
tion from the classroom, from
the library, to the residence halls
and houses.
It has become apparent that
the subcommittee on fraternities
as presently constituted cannot
continue its work. The represen
tative of the Internfraternity
Council has imposed himself and
his organization as a barrier to
any further examination of the
fraternity system from our in
tended objective and thorough
point of view (a consideration of
the elements which compose the
fraternity system as positive or
negative factors in terms of
Stanford as an educational com
munity).
The IFC representative and his
organization have charged that
Joel Kugelmass, co-chairman of
the sub-committee on fraterni
ties, is "anti-fraternity."
I regret that they have low
ered themselves and the nature
of the dialogue to this level.
Their horizons are too narrow;
they refuse to consider the pos
sibility that an objective study
of the fraternity system could
result in recommendations to
alter drastically some of the
facets of that system. I hold this
attitude responsible for the pa
ralysis of the work of the sub
committee on fraternities last
week. The over-simplified "anti
fraternity" stereotype is one that
has been applied to Kugelmass
(and others) by those who are
unwilling to examine his views
in detail. What he opposes is
not the existence of fraternities
per se, but rather those elements
in them (as well as in other liv
ing groups) which tend to limit
the education of the individual.
If those harmful elements are
purged from the system, it would
be a matter of debate as to
whether the remaining institu
tions could still be called "fra
ternities" in the traditional sense
but the Commission has
chosen not to debate lables and
definitions, but rather principle.
Therefore, under the powers
delegated to me as co-chairman
of the ASSU Housing Commis
sion by the by-laws of the Legis
lature, I am requesting the resig
nations of the present members
of the sub-committee on fraterni
ties and am announcing my in
tention to reconstitute that com
mittee with the following ap
pointments:
David Calfee and Joel Kugel
mass (co-chairmen), Bud Car
peneti, Jim Engel, David Haken,
Mike Hughes, Chuck K a t z,
James Laney, Gene Lucero, John
Morrison, Bob O'Meally, Charlie
Price, Jon Reider, Steve Spittler,

in the context of Stanford as an
educational community — as a
community with the responsibil
ity and obligation to carry educa
tion from the classroom, from
the library, to the residence halls
and houses.
It has become apparent that
the subcommittee on fraternities
as presently constituted cannot
continue its work. The represen
tative of the Internfraternity
Council has imposed himself and
his organization as a barrier to
any further examination of the
fraternity system from our in
tended objective and thorough
point of view (a consideration of
the elements which compose the
fraternity system as positive or
negative factors in terms of
Stanford as an educational com
munity).
The IFC representative and his
organization have charged that
Joel Kugelmass, co-chairman of
the sub-committee on fraterni
ties, is "anti-fraternity."
I regret that they have low
ered themselves and the nature
of the dialogue to this level.
Their horizons are too narrow;
they refuse to consider the pos
sibility that an objective study
of the fraternity system could
result in recommendations to
alter drastically some of the
facets of that system. I hold this
attitude responsible for the pa
ralysis of the work of the sub
committee on fraternities last
week. The over-simplified "anti
fraternity" stereotype is one that
has been applied to Kugelmass
(and others) by those who are
unwilling to examine his views
in detail. What he opposes is
not the existence of fraternities
per se, but rather those elements
in them (as well as in other liv
ing groups) which tend to limit
the education of the individual.
If those harmful elements are
purged from the system, it would
be a matter of debate as to
whether the remaining institu
tions could still be called "fra
ternities" in the traditional sense
but the Commission has
chosen not to debate lables and
definitions, but rather principle.
Therefore, under the powers
delegated to me as co-chairman
of the ASSU Housing Commis
sion by the by-laws of the Legis
lature, I am requesting the resig
nations of the present members
of the sub-committee on fraterni
ties and am announcing my in
tention to reconstitute that com
mittee with the following ap
pointments:
David Calfee and Joel Kugel
mass (co-chairmen), Bud Car
peneti, Jim Engel, David Haken,
Mike Hughes, Chuck K a t z,
James Laney, Gene Lucero, John
Morrison, Bob O'Meally, Charlie
Price, Jon Reider, Steve Spittler,
and Tim Stanton.
I have chosen 15 members of

this community whom I feel
capable of examining all issues
related to the fraternity system
objectively and critically within
the context of education. With
the exception of one freshman,
each of these men is now or has
been a member of a fraternity.
They are to issue a preliminary
report to me on December 1, as
are the other five sub-committees
of the Commission.
As an individual, Mr. Kugel
mass may have grave reserva
tions about a number of facets
of the fraternity system, but in
accepting his appointment as
co-chairman of this reconstituted
sub-committee, he is charged
with the responsibility of open
minded objectivity.
He has issued the following
statement to me on the recon
stitution of the sub-committee:
"The affairs of any part of the
University are and should be
the affairs of the entire Univer
sity rommunity. For too long
have we all been content to go
our own ways and leave the
progress of others at the mercy
of their own imaginations. Such
isolationism destroys the com
mon denominator of education
and substitutes a silent anarchy.
"To create the long-sought
community, therefore, we must
look to education and its pro
cesses as the abiding context. I
intend that the sub-committee
which I co-chair shall enact this

view solely by examining the
fraternity structure in relation
to education.
"No other view, no other pur
pose, lurks implicitly or explicit
ly. We bare ourselves to scrutiny
as we believe the fraternities
shall bare themselves.
"We shall not isolate ourselves
by means of pre-establishing a
political commitment, just as we
shall confirm our intellectual
commitment that all students
fulfill themselves within the edu
cational process at this Univer
sity."
At this time, with the "pro-"
and "anti-fraternity" people
quickly polarizing themselves
and unable to come together in
open and meaningful dialogue,
the Housing Commission, and
especially its sub-committee on
fraternities, is aiming on a small
scale to fill a role not unlike that
of the late Dag Hammarskjold's
as he described his position as
Secretary-General of the United
Nations:
"In the last analysis, it is a
question of integrity, and if in
tegrity in the sense of respect
for law and respect for truth
were to drive [the Secretary-
General] into positions of con
flict with this or that interest—
then that conflict is a sign of his
neutrality and not his failure
to observe neutrality . . ."
It is with this spirit that we
continue our work.

chairman of the ASSU Housing
Commission, on the re-constitu
tion of the Commission's sub
committee on fraternities.)

It was my initial hope that we
could conduct an objective study
of fraternities at Stanford — but
objective within the context of
the overall work of the Housing
Commission. For the Housing
