## Errors Hide 'OFF' Issue From Voters 
### Wendy Weiner 
"OFF! OFF!" It's certainly a
legitimate enough to rate a space
on the ballot in the A.S.S.U. elec
tion now in progress.
But who knew it was there?
Because of negligence, the fact
was obscured that students were
being given a chance to express
their views on the OFF issue
along with a choice for head yell
leader.
Refraining from making a
value judgment as to which of
these items deserved the most
attention, I shall only stress that
we must correct the disservice
that has been done to undergrad
uate women. There are those,
however, who do make a value
judgment—many students who
would vote for "OFF!" simply
wouldn't bother to mark a bal
lot for yell leader. These people
have been cheated of an oppor
tunity to express themselves
through the democratic process
because of an inexcusable lack of
communication.
An Oversight
Through an oversight, yester
day's Daily failed to mention that
this particular issue was being
considered in the election. But
it's not The Daily's fault. No
body sent a copy of che ballot
over to The Daily office.
The problem has its roots, how
ever, in several mistakes that
were made last week. An Elec
tion Commission was not ap
pointed by Dave Harris until
last Wednesday. It was approved
by LASSU on Thursday, the
same night that LASSU voted
to place the "OFF!" issue on
the ballot.
The traditional Stanford pro
cedure is to allow for a week of
campaigning after the approval
of the Election Commission. The
students working for "OFF!"
had been led to believe that they
would be given that period of
time, and prepared a campaign
which was to begin this week.
Why And When
Nobody seems to know just
way and when it was decided to

hold the election yesterday and
today. As of Sunday night nei
ther Tom Forstenzer nor Mike
Collins knew the dates, and Bill
Berry, head of the Election Com
mission, could not be contacted.
So, we are having an election
that has come as a surprise to
the representatives of one of the
two items included on the bal
lot. At the very least, this whole
mistake has been very discour
aging to those of us who are
anxious for undergraduate wom
en to be given a right for
which they shouldn't even have
to ask—it's not as though free
dom of choice in this matter is
a privilege.
"OFF!" has been placed on
the ballot in order to get an ac
curate statement of student
opinion. By not allowing for ade
quate publicity, the Election
Commission has made it im
possible to obtain this assess
ment of the actual views of the
student body.
Go out and vote on "OFF!" A
statistic from an accurate poll
may be just the kind of impetus
needed to begin a legitimate dis
cussion within the University
community of the viability (or
lack thereof) of the present
policy on women's housing.
