# Letters To The Editor
## Parasitic Attitudes Attacked 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
At the risk of being considered
a "talking idiot" by the "deaf
and-dumb children" Mr. Lowe
speaks of in his article of last
Thursday, I would like to make
a few observations regarding
Mr. Love's articule and Mr.
Berkeley's letter to the editor
of the same day.
Mr. Berkeley bemoans the fact
that "as much prejudice exists
against fraternities as it is al
leged exists within them." He
maintains that the fraternities'
antagonists "simply don't know
what a fraternity is, or see it
only from an external view
(sic)." It would seem to me that
when an institution engages in a
"mutually selective process" of
determining its membership, it
is indeed childish to expect much
in the way of sympathy on the
part of those who have either
themselves rejected the concept
of said institution or been re
jected by thet same.
It must have been for the il
lumination of these unfortu
nates, then, that Mr. Love com
pelled himself to divulge at
great length the problems fra
ternities as institutions present
for their members.
I happen to believe that the
only way an institution (any in
stitution) can justify its exis
tence is by acting in a creative
capacity within its environment.

Thus, presumably, Stanford's ex
istence can be justified within
the American society at large. I
am not firmly convinced, how
ever, that the fraternity system
at Stanford can pass the same
test.
Mr. Love, speaking as an in
dividual, apparently believes
"fraternities have an important
role to play in the life of the
community." I am only sorry
Mr. Love was unable to afford
us forty column inches in sup
port of this statement rather
than detailing the trials and trib
ulations of maintaining exis
tence in that "same old super
ficial way" which we have been
all too much exposed to.
Lest I might appear to show
"a lack of understanding and a
narrowmindedness that so often
characterizes those who so
strongly oppose Stanford's fra
ternity system," let me take this
opportunity to laud the Beta Chi
example of what a fraternity
can do to enrich its external
environment. As an "organic
body," to utilize Mr. Berkeley's
terminology, Beta Chi has en
tered into a symbiotic relation
ship with the university com
munity at large rather than to
maintain the essential parastic
relationship imposed by the oth
ers of the fraternities.

• Sailing
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. van Heeckeren has taken
a valid point with regard to the
apparent distribution of em
phasis in the sailing association.
It is well known by the ex
comm that most of the mem
bers are quite new to sailing.
All of us are learning, and it is
just a matter of the level at
which this is taking place.
One of the greatest difficulties
is that to instruct a large num
ber of people personally requires
a large staff of instructors. This
is hard to come by. As Mr. van
Heeckeren pointed out, there are
four beginners to every helms
men. The ex command com
petent sailors feel this respon
sibility and are doing more than
is apparent in order to help
people learn to sail.
One of the items on the teach
ing schedule was a "a shore
school" held three evenings last
week. The object of these classes
was to explain the rudiments of
sailing to those interested.
Additional instruction is avail
able at Lake Vasona on Satur
day and Sunday afternoons.
Members who would like to help
in any capacity are urged to
call Rocky Hatch at 321-9970.

• Proper Place
Editor, The Daily:
The reception given to Wesley
Liebeler last Monday was a dis
grace to any institution of high
er education. The belligerent at
titude assumed by many Stan
ford students exhibited lack of
objectivity and common cour
tesy. The opposition to Prof.
Liebeler's remarks simply be
cause he is a representative of
the government is childish. I am
shocked that any portion of our
"academic community" could
act in such a narrow and biased
manner.
Under the pretense of educa
tion many students seem to be
charting a course in the ex
treme opposite direction, to
wards bigotry and ignorance.
The exhibition Monday towards
Prof. Liebeler is only one ex
ample. Careful inspection of our
immediate environment (our
student government perhaps)
show many of our ideals are de
generating into anarchy and our
sense of values is disappearing
into a mist of radicalism and
false idealism. ED DAVIS
