# Balloting Concludes Today; Negligence Hurts 'Off' Vote
## 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
Already marred by "misunderstand
ings and a lack in communication,"
balloting for the controversial "Off!"
referendum, Head Yell Leader, and
Homecoming Queen ends today.
Polling stations at Tresidder, the
Post Office, and Engineering Corner
will be open all day.
"Off!", a movement for optional off
campus housing for undergraduate
women, has been a victim of "negli
gence, lack of communication, and
lack of responsibility," according to
"Off!" leader Janet Howell.
Miss Howell claims that her com
mittee was never notified of the date
of the referendum. "It just showed up
on the ballot today," she said.
Gumming Up
The decision to place the issue on
the Fall election ballot was made at
the LASSU meeting last Thursday
after three weeks of discussion. Miss

Howell charges, however, "They never
announced when the election would
be held. We were denied the tradi
tional week of campaigning. It's a
gumming up of our democratic pro
cess."
Mirri Wells, LASSU representative
and sponsor of the referendum in the
Legislature, was "confused by LASSU
proceedings last Thursday," and
thought the Fall election, including
the "Off!" issue, would be held later
this week or next week.
Miss Wells spoke with LASSU
speaker Tom Forstenzer and Stu
dent Body Vice-President Mike Col
lins over the weekend to verify the
date of the election.
"Both were unsure," she reported.
"Mike thought it would be held No
vember 7 and 8, while Tom thought it
would be Thursday and Friday of this
week. How could I be expected to

know if there is this sort of doubt
among officials?"
LASSU Secretary Barbara Herwig
started the LASSU minutes of October
20 clearly showed that the referendum
would be held on November 1 and 2.
"The issue was discussed in LASSU
for three weeks; they had plenty of
time to prepare a campaign. There
was no misunderstanding."
Bill Berry, newly appointed Election
Commissioner, was "only planning for
a Yell Leader election. My first notifi
cation that 'Off!' and the Homecoming
Queen were to be included was when
I saw it in last Friday's Daily."
He was never officially notified of
what issues to place on the ballot.
"The whole thing's a mess and a
lack of communication," he com
mented.
Candidates for Head Yell Leader
are waging a spirited contest. Craig
Brown, Bruce Braden ,and Dick Mar
shall, self-styled "Flamer," are all opti
mistic on their chances for election
after a week of campaigning that in
cluded leading cheers at the Washing
ton game last weekend.
The eight contestants for Stanford's
first Homecoming Queen were an
nounced by Mike Matkins, Cardinal's
Board member and co-chairman of
Homecoming festivities. The candi
dates for Queen and two Princesses:
Annabelle Evans, Diana Carter, Carol
Cierny, Jonell Friedkin, Joey Jacobs,
Trish Radfield, Ellen Watkins, and
Robin Wiseman. The Homecoming

elections were preliminarily scheduled
for Wednesday or Thursday, but were
moved up to concide with the general
election.
Balloting concludes at 5 p.m. today,
and Berry said the tally would begin
immediately. He told The Daily yes
terday he anticipated a light turn-out
for the fall election. He estimated the
total vote would not exceed 750.
