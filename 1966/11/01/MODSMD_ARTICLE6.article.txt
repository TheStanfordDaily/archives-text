# Econ Advisory Committee Adds Student Participation
## 
### 
The Economics Department decided
to add students to its advisory com
mittee on curriculum changes, thus
becoming the third department at
Stanford to take such action.
According to Professor Lorie Tar
shis, a member of the committee, the
entire undergraduate curriculum will
be carefully scrutinized. He observed
that the honors program would defi
nitely receive much attention.
The committee will be composed of
Professor Tarshis, Professor Bridger
Mitchell and a third faculty mem
ber, as well as five students, among
them Ken Smith, Larry Fugman, Rick
Levin and Mike Poof.
No Concrete Proposals
Rick Levin, student member of the
committee, told The Daily that the

students had no concrete proposals
to make at this time.
Most of the student appointments
were suggested by Student Body Presi
dent David Harris at the request of
Professor Tarshis.
The most recent innovation in the
economics curriculum, instituted two
years ago, was an expansion of the
courses required for majors.
Not The First
The history and political science de
partments already have student mem
bers on curriculum committees.
The students on the history com
mittee were largely responsible for
fundamental changes in the depart
ment, including an increase in inde
pendent desearch, a new 10 unit read
ing course, and a junior year writing
and research course. Both courses
are required for majors.
Political Science Dept
The faculty-student committee in the
political science department was
formed last spring. Only organiza
tional meetings have been held thus
far. According to Professor Almond,
executive head of the department,
the committee will study the type of
student who takes political science,
as well as make recommendations con
cerning the curriculum.
Student participation on the history
and political science committees was
instituted in response to student re
quests.
The Economics Department will
hold a reception for faculty and stu
dents today from 4-6 p.m. in Room
281 in Tresidder.
