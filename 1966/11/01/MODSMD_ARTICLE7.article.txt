# New Subcommittee Organized To Study Fraternity Housing
## 
### 
Jan Jacobi, co-chairman of the ASSU
Housing Commission, announced yes
terday that due to "irresolvable con
flicts among the membership," he
is dissolving the Commission's present
sub-committee on fraternities and is
appointing a new sub-committee of
15 persons.
"The sub-committee was unable to
continue its work last week after
certain of its members found it im
possible to communicate any further
with each other," Jacobi explained. "It
is my opinion that the Interfraternity
Council representative on the sub
committee was obstructing the efforts
of the sub-commitee to examine the
fraternity system within the context
of Stanford as an educational com
munity.
"To resolve this conflict, I have
appointed a new fraternity sub-com
mittee which I believe will be able to
go beyond the stereotyped judgments
which paralyzed the committee last
week."
The new members of the sub-com
mittee are:

David Calfee and Joel Kugalmass
(co-chairmen), Bud Carpeneti, Jim
Engel, David Hakken, Mike Hughes,
Chuck Katz, James Laney, Gene Lu
cero, John Morrison, Bob O'Meally,
Charlie Price, Jon Reider, Steve Spit
tier, and Tim Stanton.

further explaining his action appears
