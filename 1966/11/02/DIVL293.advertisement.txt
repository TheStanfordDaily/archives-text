Jf Jr owns a Dodge Coronet. Now she goes to parties with him,

I think your next call should be to your Dodge Dealer. Then make
o date to see the '67 Coronet, the car that's breaking hearts all

Here's the heartbreaker. . .'67 Dodge Coronet 500. A campus favorite with its great new looks, ride,
and list of extras that are standard. Like bucket seats with either a companion seat in the middle or a

rear. A choice of Six or V8 models. And lots more. So get with '67 Dodge Coronet and get busy.
