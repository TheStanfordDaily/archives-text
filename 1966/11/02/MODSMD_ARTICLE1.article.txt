# PHI DELTA THETA SUSPENDED
## Sterling Approves IFB Recommendation Vote 
### KIRK HANEN CHRIS HARTE Associate Editors 
Phi Delta Theta fraternity has been
suspended for the remainder of the
academic year.
The suspension, effective immed
iately, was announced yesterday by
President Wallace Sterling. Sterling
approved recommendations received
earlier in the day from the Interfra
ternity Board (IFB), a joint student
faculty-administration group.
Details of the incidents leading to
the suspension were not disclosed by
administration officials, but reliable
sources told The Daily the action was
largely the result of "misconduct" at
an exchange party October 8 in the
Phi Delt house with Mills College's
Olney Hall.
Contacted last night at Mills, one
of the girls who had been at the
party called the Phi Delts' actions
"gross."
"I don't know exactly how to say
this, but one boy just came up and
bit a girl on the chest.
"Later a girl went to the john and

five boys came in nude and decided
to attack her, but she ran out scream
ing. At that point most of us just
left," she continued.
A high administration official had
commented earlier that "absolutely no
physical violence was involved."
Disappointed
David Oswald, president of the chap
ter, said:
"The brothers of Phi Delta Theta
are very disappointed with the rec
ommendation of the Interfraternity
Board to President Sterling, because
a great deal of improvement has been
effected internally prior to the initia
tion of this proceeding.
"In spite of the action taken, house
spirit and unity remains high, and the
entire house is supporting the effort
to return to campus next fall in ac
cordance with the Interfraternity
Board recommendation.
"We will continue our efforts to
benefit both the University community
and the individual members of the
house."
The Phi Delt house, a new cluster
house just above Florence Moore

Hall, will probably be vacated by Sun
day afternoon, an administration of
ficial said.
University officials will help chapter
members find new housing immed
iately. No more than three members
of the house will be allowed to live
together at any one location without
permission of the Dean of Students.
Severest Action
The suspension is the severest ac
tion taken against a fraternity chap
ter at Stanford since 1963, when Zeta
Psi was suspended for three years.
It has recently reorganized on cam
pus.
The IFB recommended that Phi
Delta Theta be reinstated on proba
tion next fall, under supervision of a
committee of administrators, faculty,
and alumni appointed by President
Sterling. The probation would extend
to June, 1968.
It also recommended that the chap
ter prepare written proposals on
pledge training and initiation, scholar
ship improvement, social conduct stan
dards, and house maintenance for ap
proval by IFB.
Violation by any active member of
the fraternity of the Stanford Honor
Code or any offense against public
order during the period of suspension
or probation will be considered
grounds for further disciplinary ac
tion against the chapter, the Board
warned.
At least two other incidents involv
ing the Phi Delts are, or have been,
under judicial study.

Most recent of these was the theft
of some 11,000 copies of The Daily
during the early morning hours of
October 20. Members of the fraternity
were made to redistribute the papers
later in the day. The papers were
valued in excess of $1600.
At the time of the incident, mem
bers of the Phil Delt house gave con
flicting reasons for the theftâ€”some
called it a pledge prank, others said
it was part of an experiment by the
house's psych majors, designed to
test reactions of members of the Uni
versity community when denied their
morning Daily.
Shooting'
The other complaint was filed by
Stanford senior Bill Prachar. Prachar
told University police that he was al
most hit by a bullet fired by a mem
ber of the fraternity. Prachar was
walking to the Sigma Alpha Epsilon
house.
As he neared the Phi Delt house,
Prachar saw one of the brothers put
ting a gun in the trunk of a car, and
noted the license number.
Prachar could give no reason for the
incident. Those individuals involved in
the complaint are subject to review by
Judlicial Council.
IFB is composed of ten students
and five faculty members plus four
deans and faculty members as ex
officio members. Interfraternity Coun
cil President Drennen Jones is also
head of the IFB, but was unavailable
for comment last night.
