# Volunteers Still Wild Over Orient Summer
## Macau 
### STEPHI WILDMAN 
Thirty-seven Stanford stu
dents explored the Orient last
summer as members of Volun
teers in Asia. Although each in
dividual's experiences differed,
enthusiastic support understates
their uniform response.
The volunteers also have a
strong group spirit from the ad
venture. They see communica
tion and friendship as one of the
important results of the sum
mer.
Volunteers in Asia is a "pri
vate, independent, non-profit or
ganization which seeks to pro
vide short term assignments in

the Orient for students," accord
ing to director Dwight Clark.
Four Areas
The Volunteers worked in four
localities: Hong Kong (where
21 volunteers were sent), Macao
(3), Korea (4), and Vietnam (9).
Most volunteers taught Eng
lish as their official assignment,
but they often helped out in rec
reation and community develop
ment; the Vietnam team worked
mainly in community develop
ment and taught English, on the
side.
The Hong Kong, Macao, and
Korea groups had brief expo
sures to the cultures of Japan
and Taiwan before spliting up.
The Vietnam team did not join
the exposure tour but went to
work immediately in Vietnam.
Belinda Smith
Hong Kong volunteers assist
ed in two territories, Kowloon,
and Hong Kong island. Belinda
Smith worked on the island
teaching English to first and sec
ond year repeaters at United
College.
She found the most valuable
experience was getting to know
the volunteer group, becoming
close to the Asian students, and
seeing the contrasts of the
Orient.
There is a barrier between
teacher-student relationships,
Belinda remarked, caused by the
formality of the classroom en
vironment. If the teacher can
emerge barriers conquered, then
teacher and students can become
more than just faces, but
friends.
John Grube
John Grube worked 10 miles
outside Hong Kong in Rennie's
Mill, teaching "situation" Eng
lish. That is, he acts out a given
set of circumstances, and the

students pick up the English.
In the afternoons Grube did
light construction work at the
school, building a garden and
clearing a hillside for a staff dor
mitory.
John ate at the local student
aid project where he found his
relationship with the children
much more personal.
Grube concluded that his sum
mer was a "people experience,
not passive like touring" and
that it "called upon all his pers
onal resources."
Pete Beady, John Kavanaugti
Pete Ready and John Kava
naugh worked together in Kow-

loon teaching English. They
chose to have unstructured clas
ses in conversation.
Kavanaugh commented that
one of the most rewarding as
pects was "teaching and having
the kids respond to you. They
learned as I did," he said.
Ready agreed that the sum
mer was a "dual experience in
human relations â€” traveling in

to a new world and establishing
close contact with the group."
The volunteers tried to sur
mount the authoritarian teacher
concept which is prevalent in
Hong Kong. They felt they suc
ceeded in establishing a friendly
relationship with the students,
since they were often together
outside of class.
Katrina Weber
Katrina Weber, part of the
Macao project, also spent the
summer teaching English. But
in addition, this group worked
with Father Patrick Shaules, a
Jesuit missionary who leads Ma
cao Welfare Enterprises.
The work with Father Shaules
was the most important part of
their summer, according to Miss
Weber. This was the first time
that the volunteers helped him.
"He is sort of a pioneer in his
field," she explained. His group
was sent to convert the people
and start schools, but the Father
realizes that the many refugees
need jobs. He has started about
10 small businesses, such as a
beaded sweater factory and an
electronics assembly line, to help
provide them with work.
Miss Weber explained that the
volunteers helped straighten out
the Father's financial records
and helped to publicize his ef
forts through American maga
zines and newsletters to friends.
Later in the summer, the vol
unteers started a socio-economic
survey of Macao. They were hav
ing the answers computerized
when the summer ended, so they
were unable to see the results
of the survey.
Miss Weber commented that
next year's group hopes to make
a larger effort to help Father
Shaules and spend less time
teaching. She thinks that his in
sight in analyzing the need for
jobs rather than preaching or
food and money hand-outs will
be of greater help to the people
in the long run. In addition, mak
ing people self-sufficient adds to
their own sense of human dig
nity, she concluded.
For the first time last summer
VIA instituted a Korean work
project. In one, based in Seoul,
the volunteers taught English to
Korean college students. They
also formed an international
work camp of students from all

over Asia to build a road under
the auspices of UNESCO.
Bick Baum
The second Korean project
was in Taegu. They too taught
English. Rick Baum, one of the
volunteers, commented that one
problem at first was the absence
of any formal pattern of work
because of the newness of the
project. Thus the volunteers ini
tiated daily programs.
For the first two weeks the
group taught high school stu
dents. The older students often
discussed civil rights. The Orient
claims to have no racial preju
dices, relates Baum, when in fact
they do. The students illustrated
a desire to resolve the discus
sions liberally, but this conflicted
with their own prejudices from
grammar school.
In the afternoon the volun
teers visited the English Langu
age Clubs of the U.S. Informa

tion Service. Baum commented
the greatest problem of the stu
dents there was their preoccu
pation with English jargon.
Their usuage of fad phrases was
out of place in technical reports.
This misusage hindered their
English progress.
Language Workshop
The second half of the sum
mer was spent at a university
language workshop for profes
sors and college students. The
volunteers worked teaching Eng
lish conversation in the morning
and recording tapes for the
school's language lab in the af
ternoon.
In the conversation period,
Baum continued, they strived to
get quick responses and to make
the students English "more pre
cise and less archaic."
Baum commented that one of
the major problems of Korean
education is that the teachers

aren't very familiar with new
developments in the subject
matter. The professors aren't
always able to "read English
books first hand" in order to up
date their vocabulary.
Living with a family in the
Korean community was an im
portant step toward being ac
cepted. This aided communica
tion on a one to one basis. Baum
feels that having had Americans
living in the community may
help the Peace Corps volunteers
who were soon following.
The volunteers in Vietnam
worked as summer interns for
the International Voluntary Ser
vices. Their jobs were arranged
by VIA. Besides teaching Eng
lish the volunteers helped in
community development pro
jects.
Doug Ohmans
Doug Ohmans worked with 21
high school and university stu

dents doing manual labor to
build a system of garbage bins.
Ohmans felt that, although
"very little was accomplished
materially," the experience of
organizing themselves and try
ing to accomplish something
through bureaucratic channels
was beneficial to the Vietnamese
as well as himself.
Kit Anderton, another Viet
nam volunteer, pointed out that
the motives of students who go
to Vietnam are somewhat differ
ent than those who volunteer
elsewhere. He believes that stu
dents go to learn about the poli
tical-military situation and that
it is frustrating because they
never really succeed.
Ohmans added that what one
learns about the situation can
contribute to a loss of objecti
vity, because the volunteers be
come attached to one group of
people with whom they were in
contact.


Shown teaching English to a
girl in Macau is Bill Kelso, who
joined the Asia project last sum
mer. Kelso is a senior this year.
