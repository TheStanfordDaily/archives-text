LB J Flies Home
SEOUL—President Johnson left the Orient
and flew homeward yesterday with a parting
promise to Asian peoples of steadfast Ameri
can support against aggression and a somber
warning of "difficult days" still ahead in Viet
nam.
Before leaving for the airport, Johnson told
the National Assembly, "Difficult days lie
ahead of us in Vietnam, until the Commu
nists change their minds about fighting."

He pointed to Korea as an example for
American determination to succeed in Viet
nam, saying the Korean War had shown the
Communists "choose peace only when they
know that military success is beyond their
reach."

VIETNAM
Citizens Celebrate
SAIGON — Defying Viet Cong terrorists,
South Vietnamese citizens paraded last night
in a generally festive national holiday mood
despite an earlier artillery attack on the cen
ter of Saigon by the Communists.
The hit-and-run bombardment from recoil

less rifles and mortars, aimed at disrupting the
National Day observances, coincided with re
ports from military sources here that the Viet
Cong are showing an increased disinclination
to stand and fight anywhere, preferring to
use their old hit-and-run tactics.

Viet Figures Grow
WASHINGTON—Pentagon sources predicted
yesterday a stepup in the flow of American
troops to Vietnam in the next few weeks which
will elevate U.S. strength in the country to a
year-end total of about 382,000.
This is 46,000 —or roughly the equivalent of
an Army division and its supporting elements
—above the present froce level in Vietnam.
By official figures there are now 336,000 men
in Vietnam, not counting about 50,000 Seamen

offshore in vessels of the 7th Fleet. This com
pares with 148,300 in South Vietnam a year
ago and with 327,000 in-country troops In
Korea at the peak of that conflict.

Board posed a tough political and economic
quandary for President Johnson yesterday
by recommending a heft hike in wages and
fringe benefits in the Pan American World
Airlines labor dispute.
The board recommended 5 per cent wage
boosts and various improvements in fringe
benefits for some 12,000 Pan American work
ers. This is almost identical with a previous
airline settlement branded as "clearly infla
tionary" by Chief White House Economist
Gardner Ackley.
F s's Escort LB J
WASHINGTON—The use of F5 fighter jets

to help escort President Johnson in Asia marks
another step in the plane's curious story:
It's the world's most widely distributed war
plane and the Air Force still isn't buying any.
Sent to Vietnam in the fall of 1965 on an
experimental basis, a squadron of U.S. Fss Is
still <>n the job today flying mostly in close air
support of ground troops in the south.
