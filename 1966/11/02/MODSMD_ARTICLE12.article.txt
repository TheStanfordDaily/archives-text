# Big Brothers Offer Friendship
## 
### JACK KAPLAN 
A loosely organized group of
fifteen Stanford students has
been working with unerachiev
ing Palo Alto youngsters since
last winter.
According to Chairman Doug
Freeman, the group, known as
the Stanford Big Brother Orga
nization, seeks to establish a
friendship between each boy and
Stanford student in the project.
Philosophy
"A study conducted at Berke
ley has shown that a "non
trained, out-going personality
can be far more effective in shy,
depressed, problem-ridden chil
dren than technically trained

personnel," according to Free
man.
No Doubts
Stanford big brothers are
strictly volunteers. They earn
no financial profit, although
they are reimbursed for the costs
of the program. "A personal
commitment is far more mean
ingful than financial enumera
tion," explained Freeman.
"The tremendous personal
satisfaction of helping young
sters is ,and should be, their
sole reward," he said.
Relationship
The relationship between the
big brother and little brother is
entirely up to the people in

volved. The only requirement is
that contact be made at least
once a week. In the past, the
brothers have golfed, bowled,
played baseball and other sports,
seen movies, gone fishing, gone
to the beach, and toured Stan
ford.
