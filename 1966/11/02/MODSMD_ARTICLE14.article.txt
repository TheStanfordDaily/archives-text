## FINE ARTS EDITOR, RISSA WHITE Does Reader Enjoy JFK's Company? 
### SUE MEYER 
The Pleasure of His Company,
Paul B. Fay, Jr., (Harper and
Row) 55.95.
Those who knew and were
closely associated with the late
President John F. Kennedy and
who have not yet broken into
print must often be tempted to
add their individual reminis
censes to the list of books about
him. The result might be respon
sible historical writing, offering
an anlysis of the agony of power
and decision-making; or a be
hind-the-scenes view of the na
tional leadership. But a much
more likely product would be
one similar to The Pleasure of
His Company by Paul B. Fay, Jr.
Fay, a Stanford graduate, has
written what he terms "a journal
of friendship," a chronicle of his
relationship with Kennedy,
which began with a touch foot
ball bage at a PT-boat training
base in Rhode Island and con
tinued through Kennedy's Con
gressional campaigns and his
Presidency, during which Fay
served as Under Secretary of the
Navy.
Thus, by its very nature, the
book could not be expected to
give any new or startling intepr
pretation of policy formulation
In Washington. It is not unreas
onable, on the other hand, to
hope that it might contain some
significant insight into Kennedy
the human being, especially as
Fay has "saved every letter or
note that he ever sent me, be
ginning during the war years."

There is no doubt that Fay
wants to convey his image of
Kennedy the man: we are bomb
arded with incidents which show
the President in his role as hus
band, father, and friend; or
which give us an intimate pic
ture of the informal and personal
side of his life as President.
However,much material
echoes the familiar strains of
other writing about Kennedy. We
see him, for instance, as a very
realistic politician in his first
Congressional election or as a
wise and witty natural leader.
Despite continual, although
often familiar glimpses of Ken
nedy the man, the reader will
begin to wonder just whose com
pany he is enjoying, for author
Fay portrays himself much more
effectively than he does the
President. Although this is defin
itely unintentional, is is perhaps
inevitable that in dealing with
a prominent figure such as Ken
nedy, one stresses one's personal
involvement in order to impart
a quality of uniqueness to al
ready-familiar events.
The Pleasure of His Company
succeeds in its effort to be a
scrapbook of personal remem
brances: it is a series of discon
nected anecdotes, expressing lit
tle more than author Fay's ex
traordinary admiration for Ken
nedy. While this makes enjoy
able reading, the reader looking
for something of more substance
than a well-written "I, too, knew
Kennedy" book will be disap
pointed.
