If you are one of the students
who drives an XKE, wears $25-
a-pair shoes, and would not
dream of eating anywhere but
the Blue Fox, do not read any
further. However, If you are a
member of that vast war-on
poverty majority which arrived
on campus this fall with cham
pagne taste, a beer budget, and
a bank account of $905 exactly,
read on.
How To Live Cheaply Here is
a pamphlet written as a resource
book for the scholars without
dollars and indicates the how
to - live - happily - on-ashoestring
method of survival.
This pamphlet was written by
a group of Stanford students,
poverty â€¢ stricken of course,
which included young marrieds
with child, young marrieds with
out child, single male, single fe
male, undergrad and grad. Most
uf its advice and information is
more valuable to the off-campus
groups than to the trapped On
Set, but it does contain penny
saving tips for all types.
For example, the pamphlet can
tell you how to y ick a used car
and not have it break down 30
seconds after you sign on the
dotted line; where to get six
packages of frozen vegetables
for $1; where to go in San Fran
cisco without losing your year's
allowance; and how to take a
delicious and free trip through
the wine country.
Of particular interest to all
students will be the sections on
services, transportation, enter
tainment and how to get money.

For the more select groups such
as the Bing Nursery School set,
the chapters on Housing, Food
and Drink, Buying Things, and
Children hold many secrets to
economic equilibrium.
The material presented with
in the well-written pages of this
boon-to-the-broke has been re

searched in depth and, thanks to
a very comprehensive index, is
speedily available in case of
crisis at the check-out stand.
Moreover, the good spirits of
the authors and their style of
writing make the pamphlet hu
morous and entertaining as well
as useful.
