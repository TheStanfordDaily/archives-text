# 'Freshman Voices' Suffers

Freshman Voices, Freshman En
glish Department, 25 cents.
As a document of "student
manners and morals," the mag
azine Freshman Voices is not en
tirely successful. It is largely a
chronicle of the process by
which we were transformed
from the generally apolitical
high school types to the fuzzy
liberals most of us are today. It
is difficult to avoid cliches when
treating a subject as basically
trite as this transforming pro
cess is at least in the abstract.
Personal Ariticles Succeed
It is no surprise, then, that
those articles are most success
ful which are most personal.
Thus "Growing Up" by Terry
Barnett is a pastiche of naive
over-generalizations which rath
er contradict the claims of the
title, while Annette Moriss' "Two
Games, Two Sets of Rules" is an
honest and moving account of
the realization that the conces
sions one must make to the split
between parental and collegiate
world-views can be costly.
Gordon Strauss' "Conscientious
Objection, War, and the Draft"
is likewise one of the better se
lections; it combines a clear

presentation of the various types
of conscientious objection with
a sincere explanation of the
author's own position.
Of the purely descriptive es
says, "The Meaning of the Har
ris Election," by Louis Highman,
"The Two-Culture Trap," by J.
Harris, and "Influence of the
Liberals," by Donald Farrow, are
the best conceived and presented.
The remainder of the essays suf
fer from an overdose of polem
ics, poor organization, or incom
petent writing (split infinitives,
my God!).
The magazine suffers from a
lack of absorbing subject mat
ter and from the kind of in
grown editor-contributor situa
tion that is a dangerous weak
ness in a campus publication.
Applaud Efforts
Yet it is not without a certain
value â€” nostalgic, perhaps, for
upperclassmen, and prophetic,
perhaps, for this year's fresh
men (the magazine was pre
pared last spring by last year's
freshmen).
As a project, the magazine
should definitely be encouraged.
We may not agree with what the
contributiors say, but we must
applaud their efforts to develop
Voices.
