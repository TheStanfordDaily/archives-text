# Vietnam Pictures Damn U.S.
## 
### CHRISTOPHER HARGROVE 
Vietnam! Vietnam! In Photo
graphs and Text, by Felix
Greene, (Fulton), $2.95.
In one of the many recent ar
ticles about U Thant and "will
he or won't he stay at the U.N.,"
there was a brief mention that
Thant had bought 150 copies of
a book called Vietnam! Vietnam!
and was giving them to his
friends.
The book is on sale in the
Stanford bookstore, where this
reviewer found it displayed
among many other books deal
ing with Southeast Asia. At first
glance, it appeared out of place.
It looks like an oversized edition
of "Happiness is a Tank Full of
New, Improved Napalm."
But if the browser flips it open
to page 100, he will see a picture
of a bombed-out North Vietna
mese kindergarten. And if he
flips back to page 68, he will see
a totally demolished South Viet
namese village. And if he flips
back to page 42, he will see the
body of a Viet Cong suspect be
ing dragged feet-first with his
face in the dirt behind an armor
ed personnel carrier with "U.S.
ARMY" plainly printed on its
steel-plated side.
No Malice
And if our browser should flip
to the text in the back of the
book and read a page, he might
impulsively decide to buy the
book and, like U Thant, show it
to his friends.
This is no everyday "Yankee
Go Home" invective, no NLF
propaganda, no "Hate America"
campaign.
"Though it condemns without
qualification the policies pur
sued by the political and military
leaders of the U.S. in Vietnam,"
it was, the author claims, "not
written in any spirit of malice,
but rather with an unshakeable
faith in the essential generosity
of the American people."
For this reason alone Viet

nam! Vietnam! must be consid
ered seriously for more than
just a moment.
Not Accidents
The photographs that fill
more than half the book are not
the kind of pictures one sees
often on television or in the
newspapers or on the cover of
Life.
One can imagine imperturb
able Dean Rusk saying, "Well,
they represent just a small seg
ment of the overall picture.
They're an inaccurate represen
tation of the general situation,
which, as we have said, has been
progressing quite well lately.
Besides, accidents are bound to
happen."
But they are not accidents,
many of them. An American
soldier watching a suspect being
tortured by Vietnamese soldiers

is no accident. A white-bearded
old man bound, gagged, blind
folded and labeled is no acci
dent. Routing children from the
bushes with tear gas is no acci
dent.
It is amazing, when one thinks
about it, that a photographer
was handy when some of these
things were happening.
Case Against U.S.
Perhaps you believe the choice
of pictures reflects a misguided
bias. If so, then turn to page 131
and start reading.
Felix Greene has compiled a
pretty strong case against the
United States. It is one-sided,
naturally, as arguments tend to
be. And one guesses that much
of it is not original. But if you
will pardon the comparison,
neither was Shakespeare. It is
a matter of presentation and im
pact. Greene's presentation is

calm and orderly, and the impact
Is strong.
In spite of himself, however,
Greene falls into the same trap
as many opponents of the offi
cial American position. He ap
pears to accept without question
certain evidence that supports
his point of view, and to omit
without explanation evidence
that might contradict it.
Keeping in mind the fact that
this problem is inherent in any
treatment of Vietnam, one must
still concede that Vietnam! Viet
nam! presents an abundance of
evidence that many of the Ame
rican public's precepts about
how and why their Army is
fighting in Vietnam, are simply
not based on fact; and moreover
that the American government
is covering up many of its acti
vities there and the policies and
decisions behind them.
