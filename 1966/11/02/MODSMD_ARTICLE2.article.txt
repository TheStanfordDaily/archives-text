# Queen, 'OFF' Sponsors Complain; Voting Continues One More Day
## 
### STEVE GRUBER 
Balloting will continue today In the
contests for head yell leader, home
coming queen, and the women-off
campus referendum (OFF!).
Elections Commissioner Bill Berry
made the decision after complaints
were filed by the Homecoming Queen
Committee and the sponsors of the
referendum.
The dates of the election had been
confused, according to Tom Forsten
zer, speaker of legislature.
Forestenzer said that when referen
dum sponsor Janet Howell called him
two weeks ago concerning the elec
tion dates, he told her that November
1 and 2 had been set by the Legis
lature for the election.
Surprise
"We were all taken by surprise
when it (the election) started on Mon
day," Forstenzer said.
Berry, who is responsible for the
elections, claims that nominations
and ballots for the Homecoming
Queen election were not given to him
until yesterday.
The error in yesterday's Daily has
compounded the troubles, Berry said.
The Daily printed a picture of the
Homecoming Queen candidates with
the wrong names. The caption said
the names should be read from left
to right when actually they were
listed from right to left.
Confusion
Forstenzer cited much of the con
fusion as coming from the fact that
"the Elections Commissioner was not
told to contact me, or anyone, for that
matter." All of the elections should
have begun yesterday, he said.
Complaints from the sponsors of
the off campus referendum centered
around confusion concerning the elec
tion dates. Miss Howell said that she
became more confused when she at
tempted to contact ASSU officials. She
was unable to talk to the Elections
Commissioner.
Howell, Forstenzer, and Berry
agreed yesterday to extend the elec
tions one day. "This will give the

'OFF!' group additional time to cam
paign, hopefully providing a free
rein to the democratic process," Ber
ry commented.
LASSU Elections
Forstenzer also told The Dally that
"We had intended to run the LASSU
elections at the same time as the head

yell leader election, but couldn't get
figures on the number of people in
each constituency." The membership
of the Legislature is based on repre
sentation from each campus living
group. A certain number of members
are also allotted to off-campus stu
dents.

Nominations are now open for off
campus Legislature representatives,
Forstenzer said. The petitions will be
due November 11. The date of the
election has not been set.
Red Hot Prof Contest
In other election news, Dean of the
Chapel B. Davie Napier is leading the
Red Hot Prof contest by nearly 500
votes. The contest is intended to raise
money for the International Student
Fund. Votes are cast by contributing
money to the fund.
Professor Charles Beye is in second
place with 2169, and Professor Ken
Cooper is in third with 1433.
Overseas Campus Chairman Robert
A. Walker bounced back yesterday
with -8 votes after hitting a low of
-198. Negative votes may be cast
for five cents each.
Other candidates at the low end of
the scale are Professor Harbaugh
with -36 and Dean Summers at -14.
The Great Pumpkin has 104 votes.
