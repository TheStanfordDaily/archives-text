# Blackboard Analysis
## 'Great Job By Root' 
### Nick Selby 
(Note: The following Ik an Interview with Stanford football coach
John Ralston on the questions arising from the 22-20 loss to Wash
ington Saturday.)
Q. Coach, you said after the game that you thought the Huskies
decision to go for the first down on fourth and inches was a "solid
call/ Do you still think you would have gone for first down, or
played It safe and gone for the field goal? What play did they run
and what would you have run If you had to go for the first down?
Coach Ralston: I think that I would now have to go for the field
goal. There's always a chance for a fumble afterwards if you make
it, and then again being stopped with inches to go is not unheard
of. We stopped Illinois several times on fourth down plays.
Washington ran a straight power play at our tackle—no special
blocking. I would have run the same play.
Q. What happened on the play that Washington's end, Dave Wil
liams, broke loose on? Now that you've seen the films, whose fault
was it?
Coach Ralston: Washington ran a good pass play In which
Williams cut across the middle and caught it between zones. The
safety hit Williams, but he spun free. The other two halfbacks and
one linebacker just missed the tackles.
Q. How does the reverse you used in the second quarter work?
Was this the first time for that play this year? Why didn't it score?
Coach Ralston: Gene Washington rolls out to the left, and the
other backs move that way too. Root blocks for Gene on the hand
off to Blunt, who circles around to the right and heads up field.
Blunt can go inside or outside Conrad. As it happened, Conrad
blocked in and Blunt ran inside, and so he didn't get the touchdown
although he did get the first down.
It was the first time we've used the play all year, and I think
it was sent in from the bench for use on this occasion.
Q. The lineup which really excited the fans occured when you
had in three quarterbacks, Washington (flanker), Williams (quar
terback) and Lewis (halfback). What are your plans as to con
tinuing this setup?
Coach Ralston: We intend to continue these innovations, al
though not to any great degree. Washington has good moves at
flanker, good speed, and we may alternate him there. Lewis may
also play flanker, because we can take advantage of his blocking
ability there. Especially, after we've see the great job Shoemaker
is capable of at halfback.
Q. Who will start at quarterback Saturday? Washington com
pleted two of seven for 32 yards, while Williams completed five
of 11 for 119 yards. Williams also appears to be Improving
fast.
Coach Ralston: Right now it's a toss-up as to who will start Sat
urday. We'll wait to see the results of this week's practice sessions
before we announce it. Williams has been coming on strong and
and we are very satisfied with his play.
Q. What was the cause of Shoemaker's fumble In the second
quarter which led to a field goal by Martin and possibly provided
the winning margin?
Coach Ralston: It was not Shoemaker's fault alone. An interior
lineman missed his block, and a Husky roared in untouched to hit
the ball with his helmet and knock it free.
Q. Your defense did a good job of preventing long gainers on
plunges through the middle, which Is Washington's bread and but
ter play. Was this due to scouting and having your linebackers
play in closer to the middle?
Coach Ralston: Actually, our linebackers weren't any closer to
the middle, except on certain defenses. Where we did have trouble
was with the linebackers being pinned inside by the tight end
on roll-outs by Sparlin. He got a lot of time to throw.
As for scouting, we were not at all surprised by the perform
ance of Martin, McCabe, or Wojciechowski. Washington screamed
all week about it injuries, and in the end the only guys who didn't
play were Moore and Cope.
Q. Do you think Jack Root played his best game ever? Why did
you have him run three times in a row from Inside the two?
Coach Ralston: Certain, this was Jack's finest game. He
twice on great second efforts, and blocked well. The reason he ran
three in a row was that it was our best power play for short yard
age—Jack dives well and we get maximum blocking.
Q. Why were your offensice statistics so much better this game?
Coach Ralston: We did have better team unity, and Washing
ton may not have been as tough defensively. Then too, we had 75
yards in one play.
Q. Was it worth the gamble to have Dave Lewis throw the ball
across the field to Blunt on the kick off play? This la an easy way
to give your opponent a TD if anything goes wrong.
Coach Ralston: I think it was worth it. We got good field posi
tion from it and later tried a field goal. Dave throws the ball hard
enough so that it will go out of bounds if Blunt misses it. Actually,
if Dave had come forward a bit more, this play might have gone
all the way.
Q. Who freed Mark Marquess on his 41 yard punt return?

Coach Ralston: This was our
usual punt return play, in which
we set up a wall of blockers
along the sideline. Bob Arnon
threw the block which freed
Marquess, who circled back and
then ran up the side line.
Q. What's the Injury situation
for the Air Force game?
Coach Ralston: Washington,
who reinjured his shoulder from
an injury he got in the Oregon
game, will definitely be set to go.
I'm worried that Blaine Nye will
not be able to play.
Q. Air Force Is primarily a
passing team, and so far, pass
defense has been one of Stan*
ford's key weaknesses. How do
you propose to stop the Falcons?
Coach Ralston: Air Force has
a scrappy squad to give us a
battle. They do pass primarily.
I would not say that our de
fensive secondary has been weak
at all. It's mostly been a case
of our not being able to mount
a rush and pressure the quar
terback.

it was sent in from the bench for use on this occasion.
Q. The lineup which really excited the fans occured when you
had in three quarterbacks, Washington (flanker), Williams (quar
terback) and Lewis (halfback). What are your plans as to con
tinuing this setup?
Coach Ralston: We intend to continue these innovations, al
though not to any great degree. Washington has good moves at
flanker, good speed, and we may alternate him there. Lewis may
also play flanker, because we can take advantage of his blocking
ability there. Especially, after we've see the great job Shoemaker
is capable of at halfback.
Q. Who will start at quarterback Saturday? Washington com
pleted two of seven for 32 yards, while Williams completed five
of 11 for 119 yards. Williams also appears to be Improving
fast.
Coach Ralston: Right now it's a toss-up as to who will start Sat
urday. We'll wait to see the results of this week's practice sessions
before we announce it. Williams has been coming on strong and
and we are very satisfied with his play.
Q. What was the cause of Shoemaker's fumble In the second
quarter which led to a field goal by Martin and possibly provided
the winning margin?
Coach Ralston: It was not Shoemaker's fault alone. An interior
lineman missed his block, and a Husky roared in untouched to hit
the ball with his helmet and knock it free.
Q. Your defense did a good job of preventing long gainers on
plunges through the middle, which Is Washington's bread and but
ter play. Was this due to scouting and having your linebackers
play in closer to the middle?
Coach Ralston: Actually, our linebackers weren't any closer to
the middle, except on certain defenses. Where we did have trouble
was with the linebackers being pinned inside by the tight end
on roll-outs by Sparlin. He got a lot of time to throw.
As for scouting, we were not at all surprised by the perform
ance of Martin, McCabe, or Wojciechowski. Washington screamed
all week about it injuries, and in the end the only guys who didn't
play were Moore and Cope.
Q. Do you think Jack Root played his best game ever? Why did
you have him run three times in a row from Inside the two?
Coach Ralston: Certain, this was Jack's finest game. He
twice on great second efforts, and blocked well. The reason he ran
three in a row was that it was our best power play for short yard
age—Jack dives well and we get maximum blocking.
Q. Why were your offensice statistics so much better this game?
Coach Ralston: We did have better team unity, and Washing
ton may not have been as tough defensively. Then too, we had 75
yards in one play.
Q. Was it worth the gamble to have Dave Lewis throw the ball
across the field to Blunt on the kick off play? This la an easy way
to give your opponent a TD if anything goes wrong.
Coach Ralston: I think it was worth it. We got good field posi
tion from it and later tried a field goal. Dave throws the ball hard
enough so that it will go out of bounds if Blunt misses it. Actually,
if Dave had come forward a bit more, this play might have gone
all the way.
Q. Who freed Mark Marquess on his 41 yard punt return?

Coach Ralston: This was our
usual punt return play, in which
we set up a wall of blockers
along the sideline. Bob Arnon
threw the block which freed
Marquess, who circled back and
then ran up the side line.
Q. What's the Injury situation
for the Air Force game?
Coach Ralston: Washington,
who reinjured his shoulder from
an injury he got in the Oregon
game, will definitely be set to go.
I'm worried that Blaine Nye will
not be able to play.
Q. Air Force Is primarily a
passing team, and so far, pass
defense has been one of Stan*
ford's key weaknesses. How do
you propose to stop the Falcons?
Coach Ralston: Air Force has
a scrappy squad to give us a
battle. They do pass primarily.
I would not say that our de
fensive secondary has been weak
at all. It's mostly been a case
of our not being able to mount
a rush and pressure the quar
terback.
(Note: The following Ik an Interview with Stanford football coach
John Ralston on the questions arising from the 22-20 loss to Wash
ington Saturday.)
Q. Coach, you said after the game that you thought the Huskies
decision to go for the first down on fourth and inches was a "solid
call/ Do you still think you would have gone for first down, or
played It safe and gone for the field goal? What play did they run
and what would you have run If you had to go for the first down?
Coach Ralston: I think that I would now have to go for the field
goal. There's always a chance for a fumble afterwards if you make
it, and then again being stopped with inches to go is not unheard
of. We stopped Illinois several times on fourth down plays.
Washington ran a straight power play at our tackle—no special
blocking. I would have run the same play.
Q. What happened on the play that Washington's end, Dave Wil
liams, broke loose on? Now that you've seen the films, whose fault
was it?
Coach Ralston: Washington ran a good pass play In which
Williams cut across the middle and caught it between zones. The
safety hit Williams, but he spun free. The other two halfbacks and
one linebacker just missed the tackles.
Q. How does the reverse you used in the second quarter work?
Was this the first time for that play this year? Why didn't it score?
Coach Ralston: Gene Washington rolls out to the left, and the
other backs move that way too. Root blocks for Gene on the hand
off to Blunt, who circles around to the right and heads up field.
Blunt can go inside or outside Conrad. As it happened, Conrad
blocked in and Blunt ran inside, and so he didn't get the touchdown
although he did get the first down.
It was the first time we've used the play all year, and I think
it was sent in from the bench for use on this occasion.

on roll-outs by Sparlin. He got a lot of time to throw.
As for scouting, we were not at all surprised by the perform
ance of Martin, McCabe, or Wojciechowski. Washington screamed
all week about it injuries, and in the end the only guys who didn't
play were Moore and Cope.
Q. Do you think Jack Root played his best game ever? Why did
you have him run three times in a row from Inside the two?
Coach Ralston: Certain, this was Jack's finest game. He
twice on great second efforts, and blocked well. The reason he ran
three in a row was that it was our best power play for short yard
age—Jack dives well and we get maximum blocking.
Q. Why were your offensice statistics so much better this game?
Coach Ralston: We did have better team unity, and Washing
ton may not have been as tough defensively. Then too, we had 75
yards in one play.
Q. Was it worth the gamble to have Dave Lewis throw the ball
across the field to Blunt on the kick off play? This la an easy way
to give your opponent a TD if anything goes wrong.
Coach Ralston: I think it was worth it. We got good field posi
tion from it and later tried a field goal. Dave throws the ball hard
enough so that it will go out of bounds if Blunt misses it. Actually,
if Dave had come forward a bit more, this play might have gone
all the way.
Q. Who freed Mark Marquess on his 41 yard punt return?

Coach Ralston: This was our
usual punt return play, in which
we set up a wall of blockers
along the sideline. Bob Arnon
threw the block which freed
Marquess, who circled back and
then ran up the side line.
Q. What's the Injury situation
for the Air Force game?
Coach Ralston: Washington,
who reinjured his shoulder from
an injury he got in the Oregon
game, will definitely be set to go.
I'm worried that Blaine Nye will
not be able to play.
Q. Air Force Is primarily a
passing team, and so far, pass
defense has been one of Stan*
ford's key weaknesses. How do
you propose to stop the Falcons?
Coach Ralston: Air Force has
a scrappy squad to give us a
battle. They do pass primarily.
I would not say that our de
fensive secondary has been weak
at all. It's mostly been a case
of our not being able to mount
a rush and pressure the quar
terback.
(Note: The following Ik an Interview with Stanford football coach
John Ralston on the questions arising from the 22-20 loss to Wash
ington Saturday.)
Q. Coach, you said after the game that you thought the Huskies
decision to go for the first down on fourth and inches was a "solid
call/ Do you still think you would have gone for first down, or
played It safe and gone for the field goal? What play did they run
and what would you have run If you had to go for the first down?
Coach Ralston: I think that I would now have to go for the field
goal. There's always a chance for a fumble afterwards if you make
it, and then again being stopped with inches to go is not unheard
of. We stopped Illinois several times on fourth down plays.
Washington ran a straight power play at our tackle—no special
blocking. I would have run the same play.
Q. What happened on the play that Washington's end, Dave Wil
liams, broke loose on? Now that you've seen the films, whose fault
was it?
Coach Ralston: Washington ran a good pass play In which
Williams cut across the middle and caught it between zones. The
safety hit Williams, but he spun free. The other two halfbacks and
one linebacker just missed the tackles.
Q. How does the reverse you used in the second quarter work?
Was this the first time for that play this year? Why didn't it score?
Coach Ralston: Gene Washington rolls out to the left, and the
other backs move that way too. Root blocks for Gene on the hand
off to Blunt, who circles around to the right and heads up field.
Blunt can go inside or outside Conrad. As it happened, Conrad
blocked in and Blunt ran inside, and so he didn't get the touchdown
although he did get the first down.
It was the first time we've used the play all year, and I think
it was sent in from the bench for use on this occasion.
Q. The lineup which really excited the fans occured when you
had in three quarterbacks, Washington (flanker), Williams (quar
terback) and Lewis (halfback). What are your plans as to con
tinuing this setup?
Coach Ralston: We intend to continue these innovations, al
though not to any great degree. Washington has good moves at
flanker, good speed, and we may alternate him there. Lewis may
also play flanker, because we can take advantage of his blocking
ability there. Especially, after we've see the great job Shoemaker
is capable of at halfback.
Q. Who will start at quarterback Saturday? Washington com
pleted two of seven for 32 yards, while Williams completed five
of 11 for 119 yards. Williams also appears to be Improving
fast.
Coach Ralston: Right now it's a toss-up as to who will start Sat
urday. We'll wait to see the results of this week's practice sessions
before we announce it. Williams has been coming on strong and
and we are very satisfied with his play.
Q. What was the cause of Shoemaker's fumble In the second
quarter which led to a field goal by Martin and possibly provided
the winning margin?
Coach Ralston: It was not Shoemaker's fault alone. An interior
lineman missed his block, and a Husky roared in untouched to hit
the ball with his helmet and knock it free.
Q. Your defense did a good job of preventing long gainers on
plunges through the middle, which Is Washington's bread and but
ter play. Was this due to scouting and having your linebackers
play in closer to the middle?
Coach Ralston: Actually, our linebackers weren't any closer to
the middle, except on certain defenses. Where we did have trouble
was with the linebackers being pinned inside by the tight end
on roll-outs by Sparlin. He got a lot of time to throw.
As for scouting, we were not at all surprised by the perform
ance of Martin, McCabe, or Wojciechowski. Washington screamed
all week about it injuries, and in the end the only guys who didn't
