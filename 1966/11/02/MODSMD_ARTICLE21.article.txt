## Frat Committee: Just A Propaganda Vehicle? 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
I am deeply saddened and dis
tressed by the article in The
Daily regarding the re-establish
ment of the fraternity study
committee. I feel that I must
reply to the accusations made
by Jan Jacobi in that statement.
The former subcommittee dis
solved in mass confusion on
Tuesday, October 25th. At that
time the three co-chairmen (Joel
Kugelmass, Kit Anderton, and
I) met to give direction to the
subcommittee. The subcommit
tee had originally been struc
tured with an antifraternity co
chairman (Kugelmass), a pro
fraternity co-chairman (myself),
and a neutral (Anderton). This
structure was intended to pro
vide a means to study the fra
ternity system objectively. In
the course of the discussion
what had been implicitly known
all along became explicit. Ander
ton was by no stretch of the im
agination a neutral; he was
firmly in Kuglemass's camp.
They also, frankly, admitted
that they could not work ob
jectively in studying fraterni
ties. To them I was, indeed, an
obstructionist; because I would
not let them use the subcom
mittee as a propaganda vehicle
in their campaign to abolish
fraternities. I left the meeting
deeply disturbed and full well
knowing that I would be forced
to resign from the subcommit
tee.
I did not give up, however. In
a second attempt to solve the
problem, I attended a meeting
of the entire housing commis
sion the following day. Kugel
mass reported to the commis
sion the occurrences of the pre
vious night. His report ended
with the bald statement that he
could not work for fraternities;
he could only work against.
From then on there was no dia
logue. There was hardly even a
mention of objectivity. No one
was listening to me; nor did
they wish to listen. As I stated
when I left, they were no longer
discussing whether or not to
find an objective structure for
the subcommittee. They were
discussing the best possible
means in which to use the sub
committee for propaganda pur
poses.
Kugelmass and Anderton by
their actions forced me into ad
vocating the pro-fraternity posi
tion. I have since been forced
to resign—as I predicted. When
it became obvious that nothing
of a propaganda nature could
be accomplished over me, Kugel
mass took over the committee.
I was content to allow this to
happen without exposing the
situation. Since I made this de
cision Jacobi has attacked my
intellectual integrity. He has
sought to Strengthen the new
committee's position by invec
tive and diatribe aimed at me;
This, then, is my reply.

• Fre Had It
Editor, The Daily:
I've had it! Absolutely had it!
I do not wish to see Dr. Walker
crucified, nor the Overseas Cam
pus program. Nor do I wish to
see Miss Ackerley drawn and
quartered for her Austria series.
On the contrary, I thank her for
it. No matter how well or badly
researched and written her ar
ticles have been, they have
served the purpose of stimulat
ing some much needed critical
discussion. I say "some" critical
discussion. These articles have
also stimulated a great many
people to add to the volume of
remarks which pass the buck
and blame everybody else from
Dr. Walker to Campus Alumni
to the European maids for the
problems their groups encoun
tered overseas.
I cannot really believe that
Stanford students, for example,
are so dim-witted that they will
take the term "European Ex
perience" literally. One cannot
really expect to cross the face
of Western Europe in three
well-planned three day week
ends. The Martindale Report, if
anybody had taken the trouble
to read it last Spring, would
have demonstrated to all you
complaining souls that a group
of students had sat down and
seriously considered the prob
lem of travel, and more particu
larly the problems of academic
excellence. Fifteen to thirty of
us put in a great deal of time,
effort and imagination. We at
tempted to redefine the over
seas experience in terms more
suited to what it is since it Is
NOT an "European Experience."
We put forth several proposals,

the bulk of the report, aimed at
cutting the academic load, while
increasing the content, variety,
excellence and relevance of the
courses.
It's all there in adequate, or
ganized prose. I would urge my
friends on the Overseas Campus
Board to attempt to make avail
able copies of the Martindale re
port. And I would urge even
more strongly that the stu-fac
committee, created as a perman
ent reviewing body, get hopping.
With all due respect to the fac
ulty and administrators in
volved, there is a definite ten
dency in the Overseas Campus
area to try to keep the lid on
and lie low until the issue blows
over and is forgotten. And to
forget about improving a pro
gram in which 55 per cent of
the undergrad population, and
a goodly number of professors
spend six months of their aca
demic time and approximately
$800-$lOOO of extra spending
money, would be intolerable.

• El Gruppo
Editor, The Dally:
At some point in the current
controversy about foreign cam
puses, Dr. Walker was said to
feel that some changes were
needed in the process of selec
ting students for each group.
The implication was that the
selectors, whoever they are,
should try harder to put togeth
er groups that would be group
ier. I thing the word "jell" is the
current favorite.
Now it seems to me that the
basic flaw here is the notion that
groups should necessarily be
groupy at all. The administra
tive types think they should be.
And I remember when I was in
France a few years ago, we
students used to hear dark
mumblings that we were a
"bad" group.
It is true that the group ten
ded to split into cliques, though
I don't like to use that word. It's
also true that some students
spent all their free time playing
bridge instead of going out on
the town or skipping off to
Paris.
Let us put aside for the mo
ment considerations of how this
administrative brooding affected
the group's morale. (Did some
body mention morale?) The
question is, why did this make
us a BAD group?
The answer is, we were a bad
group because the administra
tors and professors called us a
a bad group. I maintain, how
ever, being a bad group in the
sense of not having jelled is not
necessarily a bad thing.
Dr. Walker, I am sure, has
some grasp of the idea of the
European Experience. But he
forgets that its an intensely per
sonal experience and that the
group, as a big happy bowl of
Jell-o, is irrelevant.
Furthermore, I suspect that
his idea of a good group is one
that gets along with the foreign
campus administration and
doesn't complain about holes in
the wall lousy courses and bad
weather.
I suggest that Dr. Walker for
get about group solidarity and
leave the selection process alone.
If a group has more than its
share of loners, or cliques, we
should not worry our little
heads about it. And if the stu
dents complain about some
thing, let Dr. Walker set his
busy administrative mind to
ironing the problem out before
the students revolt.

• Rampant Haight
Editor, The DaUy:
I would like to comment on
Tim Haight's column in last
Friday's Daily. It seems to me
that Mr. Haight is generally
pretty squared away in his
views, and some of the profes
sional ragers with which our
fair campus abounds could fol
low his example of taste and re

straint to good advantage for
themselves and the campus in
general.
In this particular Haight con
tribution, I especially agree with
the idea that something must be
done about the science require
ment. The general studies-type
science courses here (with a
rare, sparkling exception) are
miserably taught, shabbily or
ganized, and unsupportably bor
ing.
The idea of requiring a stu
dent who upon graduation will
probably try to pass himself off
as having had a well-rounded
education to become acquainted
with some science is not a bad
one, and is probably even essen
tial in our modern age. But the
General Studies Committee, or
whatever the lodge that runs
that business calls itself, should
realize the fact that requiring
an ungodly number of boring,
incompetently taught units
(mainly at 8 a.m. in the morn
ing yet) will only serve to turn
off us poor music and b.s. ma
jors to the entire subject. I took
one quarter of Physical Sci
ences, complete with marathon
lab, and have never been so con
fused in all my life. The profes
sor (whose name I forget)
seemed to have a general idea
of what was going on, but the
lab TA was one of the most dis
organized, persons I have ever
met.
In short, my suggestion is
that the science requirement be
kept, perhaps with a reduced
number of units required, but
that courses be reoriented to
ward the non-scientific person.
Perhaps a study of the history
of scientific development, with
emphasis on its relation to his
tory in general, might be
worked out. This should be
taught by some professor who
can tell his bifocals from a mar
tini glass, and probably should
not have a lab. If done right,
the course would give us non
atomic types an idea of what the
hell science has been doing all
this time, and should manage to
get other people keyed enough
to look into science as a field
in which to spend their lives.

• Unsophisticated
Editor, The Dally:
John McClusky's attack on
"Black Day" in Monday's Daily
was certainly in order. I speak
as an organizer of that day.
First, however, let it be noted
that it was The Daily that
changed SDS's "Black Power
Day" to "Black Day". And sec
ondly, that the absurd front
page statement in The Daily en
titled "Be Colored" was not from
an SDS pen. Granted, SDS did
sponsor the afternoon skin
painting affair, but now we
know it was a mistake. It was
both politically unsophisticated
and morally wrong.
On a TV interview in answer
to one question I said that the
skin painting bit was solely for
the purpose of raising money
for SNCC and in line with the
Artist Liberation Front's demon
strations in support of the black
people of Hunters Point in their
struggle with the City Fathers.
But in fact this answer only
clouds the question.

The skin painting and carni
val-like afternoon of the Black
Power Day was wrong political
ly because it covered up the seri
ousness of the Black Power line
in terms of solid work both for
blacks and the white activists
who support Black Power. The
skin painting affair fits into the
liberal's bag about skin color
being meaningless and to
achieve integration skin color
must be made irrelevant by the
white culture completely swal
lowing up the black. This line
covers over the Black Power cry
that white society must recog
nize black culture as black and
that self-determination for
blacks must be in terms of
blacks instead of the sugary lib
eral line that there is no real
black culture but we all must
work together in terms of that
white culture.
As whites we can surely play
around with colors (painting
skin and all) as much as we
want but we can't play games
with somebody elses skin when
the color is a definative term in
that culture called black.
The evening conference on the
other hand didn't present these
faults of the afternoon. For ex
a m pi e when Mark Comfort
spoke the audience was made
aware of their color and knew
they were listening to a black
man who not only told it like it
is but said what we as whites
must now begin doing in our
own community both in terms
of organizing other whites who
have the same enemies as blacks
and in terms of understanding
whose culture is crushing
whose. ALAN SCHMIDT, SDS
• Surprise!
Editor, The Daily:
In the aftermath of the wave
of fraternity comment in The
Daily, I had a chance to pene
trate the inner court of one of
them recently. Theta Chi in
vited me to a barbecue.
The event was distinguished in
my mind not so much by the
pleasant company, food, and
drink as by the fact that the
fraternity was less insular, and
more open, friendly, and willing
to discuss their role on cam
pus than I had believed possi
ble in the light of my non-fra
ternity background stereotype of
a fraternity.
I left the house with the feel
ing that if we as human beings
are to find our way to a brother
hood of man, then perhaps the
first step is to band together
in groups, however small, and
actively participate in the build
ing of such a brotherhood.

• Indian Ego
Editor, The Dally:
For the first and only time in
my Stanford career (I'm a soph
omore), I was really proud of
my team. They successfully ex
ecuted several daring and im
aginativetive plays! Receivers
caught passes and the Big Red
fumbled only once!! To my
utter dismay and complete con
sternation, I actually saw a
Stanford player drop to his
knees to catch a pass.!!! There
was something on the field that
is foreign (or was) to Stanford
football.
Saturday I saw a team that
had real class.

• Oop'Art
Editor, The DaUy:
Regarding the article on the
Stanford Student Art Show
(Friday, Oct. 28), once again
the Daily showed its inability to
be journalistically accurate. The
Daily has presented half-truths
and implications that are totally
unfounded.
By publishing the photograph
of a painting with the article,
the Dally inaccurately linked the
two. After talking with Mr. Lir
ange about his critical review
of the art show, it was found
that he had never seen the paint
ing pictured with the headline
"Atrocity claims art show cri
tic." Furthermore, according to

Mr. Lirange, the most pertinent
part of his article was deleted as
a result of the editing liberties
taken by the Daily. Should we
interpret the Daily's actions as
an attempt to sensationalize, or
should we consider its actions as
an attempt to distort the facts
in favor of its own interpreta
tion?
Mr. Lirange's comments are
indeed valid, but, in fact, his
article was not meant to focus
on any particular work as im
plied by the singling-out of one
painting which was not even
exhibited when the a ut ho r
visited the show. Mr. Lirange
however should share some of
this responsibility since h e
based his article on a cursory
examination of the exhibition
before it was totally set-up.

• A Missed Point
Editor, The Daily:
I believe Miss Anderson did
not remain in Cubberley Audi
torium to hear all of the ques
tion-answer period following the
presentation by Georgia's Con
gresman Charles Weltner last
Wednesday evening. She omitted
in her Daily coverage the fol
lowing day an emphatic point
brought out by Mr. Weltner: In
his opinion, no matter how many
4 1/2-hour Teach-ins on "The Va
rieties of Black Power" are held,
the definition of "Black Power"
as intended by Mr. Carmichael is
contained only in one word —
VlOLENCE—period.
Mr. Weltner also was con
vinced that Mr. Carmichael has
become a prime recruiter for the
Ku Klux Klan: we have orga
nized "Black Power"—so why
not have organized "White Pow
er." it was also brought out
by Mr. Weltner that the Negro
riots in Atlanta, during the week
preceding the balloting, were a
great factor in the last-minute
switching of voters to the sup
port of segregationist Lester
Maddox.
I am from the South myself
and definitely support the ef
forts of men such as Congress
man Weltner in civil rights. I
do believe he would appreciate
the assistance of the Negroes,
members of SNCC, SDS, etc.
You might direct considerably
more effort towards persuading
the Negro that "Black Power"
civil disobedience is sending you
nowhere but backwards. I know
it is not really the "in" thing to
do, but you might also try the
old fashioned tactic—try acting
like American citizens. It may
work wonders

• Delayed Comment
Editor, The Daily:
Although a sabbatical absence
from the campus is delaying a
reaction to the October 21 issue
of The Daily, I would like to
express my shock and disgust
with the two fraternity actions
reported there, the mistreatment
of Dave Harris and the pilfering
of 10,000 copies of The Dally.
The two incidents show that
in the two fraternities concerned
an intolerant element has gained
the upper hand. I cannot laugh
these happenings off as pranks.
Rather'l think they illustrate
how in the "traditional" fratern
ity the dignity of the individual
may be subjugated to the rule
of the mob.
On the other hand I am very
encouraged to see that several
of Stanford's fraternities are
freeing themselves from "tradi
tion." Thereby they are making
small-group living a worthy ex
perience. In particular I would
like to congratulate the fratern
ity who has abolished the rush
and opened its door to all stu

dents. If it is able to limit its
membership by means of digni
fied criteria, it will make a val
uable contribution to the de
velopment of fraternities on our
campus.

• ISo Cover Story
Editor, The Daily:
Randy Bonner's blanket de
scription of Stanford fraternities
as "parastic" falls into the same
trap of fallacious argumentation
which seems to typify so many
letters to The Daily. It was
typical in its use of a highly
loaded, connotative word in an
analogy which he seemed unwill
ing to carry to any logical con
clusion.
The essence of Randy's argu
ment is that an institution must
"justify its existence by acting in
a creative capacity within its en

vironment." Thus, Stanford Uni
versity justifies its existence in ,
American society by furthering <
the aims of education. The ques- !
tion in relation to the various ;
living groups then becomes |
whether they detract from the
aims of their environment, the |
University.
Fraternities at Stanford are
simply one of several alterna
tives for living; they constitute J
an environment in which an in- t
dividual can live in close proxim- J
ity with a large group of friends 1
within a social and educational;
context. Obviously, a fraternity
can be either conducive or detri-1
mental to the aims ol' the Uni-j
versity; it is the particular mem- j
bership which makes it so. There j
is nothing inherent in any of!
these systems which guarantees |
or prevents harmony with the j
University.

• Unsophisticated
Editor, The Dally:
John McClusky's attack on
"Black Day" in Monday's Daily
was certainly in order. I speak
as an organizer of that day.
First, however, let it be noted
that it was The Daily that
changed SDS's "Black Power
Day" to "Black Day". And sec
ondly, that the absurd front
page statement in The Daily en
titled "Be Colored" was not from
an SDS pen. Granted, SDS did
sponsor the afternoon skin
painting affair, but now we
know it was a mistake. It was
both politically unsophisticated
and morally wrong.
On a TV interview in answer
to one question I said that the
skin painting bit was solely for
the purpose of raising money
for SNCC and in line with the
Artist Liberation Front's demon
strations in support of the black
people of Hunters Point in their
struggle with the City Fathers.
But in fact this answer only
clouds the question.

The skin painting and carni
val-like afternoon of the Black
Power Day was wrong political
ly because it covered up the seri
ousness of the Black Power line
in terms of solid work both for
blacks and the white activists
who support Black Power. The
skin painting affair fits into the
liberal's bag about skin color
being meaningless and to
achieve integration skin color
must be made irrelevant by the
white culture completely swal
lowing up the black. This line
covers over the Black Power cry
that white society must recog
nize black culture as black and
that self-determination for
blacks must be in terms of
blacks instead of the sugary lib
eral line that there is no real
black culture but we all must
work together in terms of that
white culture.
As whites we can surely play
around with colors (painting
skin and all) as much as we
want but we can't play games
with somebody elses skin when
the color is a definative term in
that culture called black.
The evening conference on the
other hand didn't present these
faults of the afternoon. For ex
a m pi e when Mark Comfort
spoke the audience was made
aware of their color and knew
they were listening to a black
man who not only told it like it
is but said what we as whites
must now begin doing in our
own community both in terms
of organizing other whites who
have the same enemies as blacks
and in terms of understanding
whose culture is crushing
whose. ALAN SCHMIDT, SDS

Mr. Lirange's comments are

Although a sabbatical absence
from the campus is delaying a
reaction to the October 21 issue
of The Daily, I would like to
express my shock and disgust
with the two fraternity actions
reported there, the mistreatment
of Dave Harris and the pilfering
of 10,000 copies of The Dally.
The two incidents show that
in the two fraternities concerned
an intolerant element has gained
the upper hand. I cannot laugh
these happenings off as pranks.
Rather'l think they illustrate
how in the "traditional" fratern
ity the dignity of the individual
may be subjugated to the rule
of the mob.
On the other hand I am very
encouraged to see that several
of Stanford's fraternities are
freeing themselves from "tradi
tion." Thereby they are making
small-group living a worthy ex
perience. In particular I would
like to congratulate the fratern
ity who has abolished the rush
and opened its door to all stu

dents. If it is able to limit its
membership by means of digni

• ISo Cover Story
Editor, The Daily:
Randy Bonner's blanket de
scription of Stanford fraternities
as "parastic" falls into the same
trap of fallacious argumentation
which seems to typify so many
letters to The Daily. It was
typical in its use of a highly
loaded, connotative word in an
analogy which he seemed unwill
ing to carry to any logical con
clusion.
The essence of Randy's argu
ment is that an institution must
"justify its existence by acting in
a creative capacity within its en

vironment." Thus, Stanford Uni
versity justifies its existence in ,
American society by furthering <
the aims of education. The ques- !
tion in relation to the various ;
living groups then becomes |
whether they detract from the
aims of their environment, the |
University.
Fraternities at Stanford are
simply one of several alterna
tives for living; they constitute J
an environment in which an in- t
dividual can live in close proxim- J
ity with a large group of friends 1
within a social and educational;
context. Obviously, a fraternity
can be either conducive or detri-1
mental to the aims ol' the Uni-j
versity; it is the particular mem- j
bership which makes it so. There j
is nothing inherent in any of!
these systems which guarantees |

STEVEN H. LEVINSON
Editor, The Dally:
I am deeply saddened and dis
tressed by the article in The
Daily regarding the re-establish
ment of the fraternity study
committee. I feel that I must
reply to the accusations made
by Jan Jacobi in that statement.
The former subcommittee dis
solved in mass confusion on
Tuesday, October 25th. At that
time the three co-chairmen (Joel
Kugelmass, Kit Anderton, and
I) met to give direction to the
subcommittee. The subcommit
tee had originally been struc
tured with an antifraternity co
chairman (Kugelmass), a pro
fraternity co-chairman (myself),
and a neutral (Anderton). This
structure was intended to pro
vide a means to study the fra
ternity system objectively. In
the course of the discussion
what had been implicitly known
all along became explicit. Ander
ton was by no stretch of the im
agination a neutral; he was
firmly in Kuglemass's camp.
They also, frankly, admitted
that they could not work ob
jectively in studying fraterni
ties. To them I was, indeed, an
obstructionist; because I would
not let them use the subcom
mittee as a propaganda vehicle
in their campaign to abolish
fraternities. I left the meeting
deeply disturbed and full well
knowing that I would be forced
to resign from the subcommit
tee.
I did not give up, however. In
a second attempt to solve the
problem, I attended a meeting
of the entire housing commis
sion the following day. Kugel
mass reported to the commis
sion the occurrences of the pre
vious night. His report ended
with the bald statement that he
could not work for fraternities;
he could only work against.
From then on there was no dia
logue. There was hardly even a
mention of objectivity. No one
was listening to me; nor did
they wish to listen. As I stated
when I left, they were no longer
discussing whether or not to
find an objective structure for
the subcommittee. They were
discussing the best possible
means in which to use the sub
committee for propaganda pur
poses.
Kugelmass and Anderton by
their actions forced me into ad
vocating the pro-fraternity posi
tion. I have since been forced
to resign—as I predicted. When
it became obvious that nothing
of a propaganda nature could
be accomplished over me, Kugel
mass took over the committee.
I was content to allow this to
happen without exposing the
situation. Since I made this de
cision Jacobi has attacked my
intellectual integrity. He has
sought to Strengthen the new
committee's position by invec
tive and diatribe aimed at me;
This, then, is my reply.
DALE L. MATSCHULLAT
• Fre Had It
Editor, The Daily:
I've had it! Absolutely had it!
I do not wish to see Dr. Walker
crucified, nor the Overseas Cam
pus program. Nor do I wish to
see Miss Ackerley drawn and
quartered for her Austria series.
On the contrary, I thank her for
it. No matter how well or badly
researched and written her ar
ticles have been, they have
served the purpose of stimulat
ing some much needed critical
discussion. I say "some" critical
discussion. These articles have
also stimulated a great many
people to add to the volume of
remarks which pass the buck
and blame everybody else from
Dr. Walker to Campus Alumni
to the European maids for the
problems their groups encoun
tered overseas.
I cannot really believe that
Stanford students, for example,
are so dim-witted that they will
take the term "European Ex
perience" literally. One cannot
really expect to cross the face
of Western Europe in three
well-planned three day week
ends. The Martindale Report, if
anybody had taken the trouble
to read it last Spring, would
have demonstrated to all you
complaining souls that a group
of students had sat down and
seriously considered the prob
lem of travel, and more particu
larly the problems of academic
excellence. Fifteen to thirty of
us put in a great deal of time,
effort and imagination. We at
tempted to redefine the over
seas experience in terms more
suited to what it is since it Is
NOT an "European Experience."
We put forth several proposals,

the bulk of the report, aimed at
cutting the academic load, while
increasing the content, variety,
excellence and relevance of the
courses.
It's all there in adequate, or
ganized prose. I would urge my
friends on the Overseas Campus
Board to attempt to make avail
able copies of the Martindale re
port. And I would urge even
more strongly that the stu-fac
committee, created as a perman
ent reviewing body, get hopping.
With all due respect to the fac
ulty and administrators in
volved, there is a definite ten
dency in the Overseas Campus
area to try to keep the lid on
and lie low until the issue blows
over and is forgotten. And to
forget about improving a pro
gram in which 55 per cent of
the undergrad population, and
a goodly number of professors
spend six months of their aca
demic time and approximately
$800-$lOOO of extra spending
money, would be intolerable.

• El Gruppo
Editor, The Dally:
At some point in the current
controversy about foreign cam
puses, Dr. Walker was said to
feel that some changes were
needed in the process of selec
ting students for each group.
The implication was that the
selectors, whoever they are,
should try harder to put togeth
er groups that would be group
ier. I thing the word "jell" is the
current favorite.
Now it seems to me that the
basic flaw here is the notion that
groups should necessarily be
groupy at all. The administra
tive types think they should be.
And I remember when I was in
France a few years ago, we
students used to hear dark
mumblings that we were a
"bad" group.
It is true that the group ten
ded to split into cliques, though
I don't like to use that word. It's
also true that some students
spent all their free time playing
bridge instead of going out on
the town or skipping off to
Paris.
Let us put aside for the mo
ment considerations of how this
administrative brooding affected
the group's morale. (Did some
body mention morale?) The
question is, why did this make
us a BAD group?
The answer is, we were a bad
group because the administra
tors and professors called us a
a bad group. I maintain, how
ever, being a bad group in the
sense of not having jelled is not
necessarily a bad thing.
Dr. Walker, I am sure, has
some grasp of the idea of the
European Experience. But he
forgets that its an intensely per
sonal experience and that the
group, as a big happy bowl of
Jell-o, is irrelevant.
Furthermore, I suspect that
his idea of a good group is one
that gets along with the foreign
campus administration and
doesn't complain about holes in
the wall lousy courses and bad
weather.
I suggest that Dr. Walker for
get about group solidarity and
leave the selection process alone.
If a group has more than its
share of loners, or cliques, we
should not worry our little
heads about it. And if the stu
dents complain about some
thing, let Dr. Walker set his
busy administrative mind to
ironing the problem out before
the students revolt.
CHRISTOPHER HARGROVE
• Rampant Haight
Editor, The DaUy:
I would like to comment on
Tim Haight's column in last
Friday's Daily. It seems to me
that Mr. Haight is generally
pretty squared away in his
views, and some of the profes
sional ragers with which our
fair campus abounds could fol
low his example of taste and re

straint to good advantage for
themselves and the campus in
general.
In this particular Haight con
tribution, I especially agree with
the idea that something must be
done about the science require
ment. The general studies-type
science courses here (with a
rare, sparkling exception) are
miserably taught, shabbily or
ganized, and unsupportably bor
ing.
The idea of requiring a stu
dent who upon graduation will
probably try to pass himself off
as having had a well-rounded
education to become acquainted
with some science is not a bad
one, and is probably even essen
tial in our modern age. But the
General Studies Committee, or
whatever the lodge that runs
that business calls itself, should
realize the fact that requiring
an ungodly number of boring,
incompetently taught units
(mainly at 8 a.m. in the morn
ing yet) will only serve to turn
off us poor music and b.s. ma
jors to the entire subject. I took
one quarter of Physical Sci
ences, complete with marathon
lab, and have never been so con
fused in all my life. The profes
sor (whose name I forget)
seemed to have a general idea
of what was going on, but the
lab TA was one of the most dis
organized, persons I have ever
met.
In short, my suggestion is
that the science requirement be
kept, perhaps with a reduced
number of units required, but
that courses be reoriented to
ward the non-scientific person.
Perhaps a study of the history
of scientific development, with
emphasis on its relation to his
tory in general, might be
worked out. This should be
taught by some professor who
can tell his bifocals from a mar
tini glass, and probably should
not have a lab. If done right,
the course would give us non
atomic types an idea of what the
hell science has been doing all
this time, and should manage to
get other people keyed enough
to look into science as a field
in which to spend their lives.

chairman (Kugelmass), a pro
fraternity co-chairman (myself),
and a neutral (Anderton). This
structure was intended to pro
vide a means to study the fra
ternity system objectively. In
the course of the discussion
what had been implicitly known
all along became explicit. Ander
ton was by no stretch of the im
agination a neutral; he was
firmly in Kuglemass's camp.
They also, frankly, admitted
that they could not work ob
jectively in studying fraterni
ties. To them I was, indeed, an
obstructionist; because I would
not let them use the subcom
mittee as a propaganda vehicle
in their campaign to abolish
fraternities. I left the meeting
deeply disturbed and full well
knowing that I would be forced
to resign from the subcommit
tee.
I did not give up, however. In
a second attempt to solve the
problem, I attended a meeting
of the entire housing commis
sion the following day. Kugel
mass reported to the commis
sion the occurrences of the pre
vious night. His report ended
with the bald statement that he
could not work for fraternities;
he could only work against.
From then on there was no dia
logue. There was hardly even a
mention of objectivity. No one
was listening to me; nor did
they wish to listen. As I stated
when I left, they were no longer
discussing whether or not to
find an objective structure for
the subcommittee. They were
discussing the best possible
means in which to use the sub
committee for propaganda pur
poses.
Kugelmass and Anderton by
their actions forced me into ad
vocating the pro-fraternity posi
tion. I have since been forced
to resign—as I predicted. When
it became obvious that nothing
of a propaganda nature could
be accomplished over me, Kugel
mass took over the committee.
I was content to allow this to
happen without exposing the
situation. Since I made this de
cision Jacobi has attacked my
intellectual integrity. He has
sought to Strengthen the new
committee's position by invec
tive and diatribe aimed at me;
This, then, is my reply.

Editor, The Daily:
I've had it! Absolutely had it!
I do not wish to see Dr. Walker

see Miss Ackerley drawn and
quartered for her Austria series.
On the contrary, I thank her for
it. No matter how well or badly
researched and written her ar
ticles have been, they have
served the purpose of stimulat
ing some much needed critical
discussion. I say "some" critical
discussion. These articles have
also stimulated a great many
people to add to the volume of
remarks which pass the buck
and blame everybody else from
Dr. Walker to Campus Alumni
to the European maids for the
problems their groups encoun
tered overseas.
I cannot really believe that
Stanford students, for example,
are so dim-witted that they will
take the term "European Ex
perience" literally. One cannot
really expect to cross the face
of Western Europe in three
well-planned three day week
ends. The Martindale Report, if
anybody had taken the trouble
to read it last Spring, would
have demonstrated to all you
complaining souls that a group
of students had sat down and
seriously considered the prob
lem of travel, and more particu
larly the problems of academic
excellence. Fifteen to thirty of
us put in a great deal of time,
effort and imagination. We at
tempted to redefine the over
seas experience in terms more
suited to what it is since it Is
NOT an "European Experience."
We put forth several proposals,

the bulk of the report, aimed at
cutting the academic load, while
increasing the content, variety,
excellence and relevance of the
courses.
It's all there in adequate, or
ganized prose. I would urge my
friends on the Overseas Campus
Board to attempt to make avail
able copies of the Martindale re
port. And I would urge even
more strongly that the stu-fac

With all due respect to the fac

dency in the Overseas Campus

over and is forgotten. And to
forget about improving a pro

a goodly number of professors

• El Gruppo
Editor, The Dally:
At some point in the current
controversy about foreign cam
puses, Dr. Walker was said to
feel that some changes were
needed in the process of selec
ting students for each group.
The implication was that the
selectors, whoever they are,
should try harder to put togeth
er groups that would be group
ier. I thing the word "jell" is the
current favorite.
Now it seems to me that the
basic flaw here is the notion that
groups should necessarily be
groupy at all. The administra
tive types think they should be.
And I remember when I was in
France a few years ago, we
students used to hear dark
mumblings that we were a
"bad" group.
It is true that the group ten
ded to split into cliques, though
I don't like to use that word. It's
also true that some students
spent all their free time playing
bridge instead of going out on
the town or skipping off to
Paris.
Let us put aside for the mo
ment considerations of how this
administrative brooding affected
the group's morale. (Did some
body mention morale?) The
question is, why did this make
us a BAD group?
The answer is, we were a bad
group because the administra
tors and professors called us a
a bad group. I maintain, how
ever, being a bad group in the
sense of not having jelled is not
necessarily a bad thing.
Dr. Walker, I am sure, has
some grasp of the idea of the
European Experience. But he
forgets that its an intensely per
sonal experience and that the
group, as a big happy bowl of
Jell-o, is irrelevant.
Furthermore, I suspect that
his idea of a good group is one
that gets along with the foreign
campus administration and
doesn't complain about holes in
the wall lousy courses and bad
weather.
I suggest that Dr. Walker for
get about group solidarity and
leave the selection process alone.
If a group has more than its
share of loners, or cliques, we
should not worry our little
heads about it. And if the stu
dents complain about some
thing, let Dr. Walker set his
busy administrative mind to
ironing the problem out before

• Rampant Haight
Editor, The DaUy:
I would like to comment on
Tim Haight's column in last
Friday's Daily. It seems to me
that Mr. Haight is generally
pretty squared away in his
views, and some of the profes
sional ragers with which our
fair campus abounds could fol
low his example of taste and re

straint to good advantage for
themselves and the campus in
general.
In this particular Haight con
tribution, I especially agree with
the idea that something must be
done about the science require
ment. The general studies-type
science courses here (with a
rare, sparkling exception) are
miserably taught, shabbily or
ganized, and unsupportably bor
ing.
The idea of requiring a stu
dent who upon graduation will
probably try to pass himself off
as having had a well-rounded
education to become acquainted
with some science is not a bad
one, and is probably even essen
tial in our modern age. But the
General Studies Committee, or
whatever the lodge that runs
that business calls itself, should
realize the fact that requiring
an ungodly number of boring,
incompetently taught units
(mainly at 8 a.m. in the morn
ing yet) will only serve to turn
off us poor music and b.s. ma
jors to the entire subject. I took
one quarter of Physical Sci
ences, complete with marathon
lab, and have never been so con
fused in all my life. The profes
sor (whose name I forget)
seemed to have a general idea
of what was going on, but the
lab TA was one of the most dis
organized, persons I have ever
met.
In short, my suggestion is
that the science requirement be
kept, perhaps with a reduced
number of units required, but
that courses be reoriented to
ward the non-scientific person.
Perhaps a study of the history
of scientific development, with
emphasis on its relation to his
tory in general, might be
worked out. This should be
taught by some professor who
can tell his bifocals from a mar
tini glass, and probably should
not have a lab. If done right,
the course would give us non
atomic types an idea of what the
hell science has been doing all
this time, and should manage to
get other people keyed enough
to look into science as a field
in which to spend their lives.

• Unsophisticated
Editor, The Dally:
John McClusky's attack on
"Black Day" in Monday's Daily
was certainly in order. I speak
as an organizer of that day.
First, however, let it be noted
that it was The Daily that
changed SDS's "Black Power
Day" to "Black Day". And sec
ondly, that the absurd front
page statement in The Daily en
titled "Be Colored" was not from
an SDS pen. Granted, SDS did
sponsor the afternoon skin
painting affair, but now we
know it was a mistake. It was
both politically unsophisticated
and morally wrong.
On a TV interview in answer
to one question I said that the
skin painting bit was solely for
the purpose of raising money
for SNCC and in line with the
Artist Liberation Front's demon
strations in support of the black
people of Hunters Point in their
struggle with the City Fathers.
But in fact this answer only
clouds the question.

The skin painting and carni
val-like afternoon of the Black
Power Day was wrong political
ly because it covered up the seri
ousness of the Black Power line
in terms of solid work both for
blacks and the white activists
who support Black Power. The
skin painting affair fits into the
liberal's bag about skin color
being meaningless and to
achieve integration skin color
must be made irrelevant by the
white culture completely swal
lowing up the black. This line
covers over the Black Power cry
that white society must recog
nize black culture as black and
that self-determination for
blacks must be in terms of
blacks instead of the sugary lib
eral line that there is no real
black culture but we all must
work together in terms of that
white culture.
As whites we can surely play
around with colors (painting
skin and all) as much as we
want but we can't play games
with somebody elses skin when
the color is a definative term in
that culture called black.
The evening conference on the
other hand didn't present these
faults of the afternoon. For ex
a m pi e when Mark Comfort
spoke the audience was made
aware of their color and knew
they were listening to a black
man who not only told it like it
is but said what we as whites
must now begin doing in our
own community both in terms
of organizing other whites who
have the same enemies as blacks
and in terms of understanding
whose culture is crushing
whose. ALAN SCHMIDT, SDS
• Surprise!
Editor, The Daily:
In the aftermath of the wave
of fraternity comment in The
Daily, I had a chance to pene
trate the inner court of one of
them recently. Theta Chi in
vited me to a barbecue.
The event was distinguished in
my mind not so much by the
pleasant company, food, and
drink as by the fact that the
fraternity was less insular, and
more open, friendly, and willing
to discuss their role on cam
pus than I had believed possi
ble in the light of my non-fra
ternity background stereotype of
a fraternity.
I left the house with the feel
ing that if we as human beings
are to find our way to a brother
hood of man, then perhaps the
first step is to band together
in groups, however small, and
actively participate in the build
ing of such a brotherhood.

• Oop'Art
Editor, The DaUy:
Regarding the article on the
Stanford Student Art Show
(Friday, Oct. 28), once again
the Daily showed its inability to
be journalistically accurate. The
Daily has presented half-truths
and implications that are totally
unfounded.
By publishing the photograph
of a painting with the article,
the Dally inaccurately linked the
two. After talking with Mr. Lir
ange about his critical review
of the art show, it was found
that he had never seen the paint
ing pictured with the headline
"Atrocity claims art show cri
tic." Furthermore, according to

Mr. Lirange, the most pertinent
part of his article was deleted as
a result of the editing liberties
taken by the Daily. Should we
interpret the Daily's actions as
an attempt to sensationalize, or
should we consider its actions as
an attempt to distort the facts
in favor of its own interpreta
tion?
Mr. Lirange's comments are
indeed valid, but, in fact, his
article was not meant to focus
on any particular work as im
plied by the singling-out of one
painting which was not even
exhibited when the a ut ho r
visited the show. Mr. Lirange
however should share some of
this responsibility since h e
based his article on a cursory
examination of the exhibition
before it was totally set-up.

• A Missed Point
Editor, The Daily:
I believe Miss Anderson did
not remain in Cubberley Audi
torium to hear all of the ques
tion-answer period following the
presentation by Georgia's Con
gresman Charles Weltner last
Wednesday evening. She omitted
in her Daily coverage the fol
lowing day an emphatic point
brought out by Mr. Weltner: In
his opinion, no matter how many
4 1/2-hour Teach-ins on "The Va
rieties of Black Power" are held,
the definition of "Black Power"
as intended by Mr. Carmichael is
contained only in one word —
VlOLENCE—period.
Mr. Weltner also was con
vinced that Mr. Carmichael has
become a prime recruiter for the
Ku Klux Klan: we have orga
nized "Black Power"—so why
not have organized "White Pow
er." it was also brought out
by Mr. Weltner that the Negro
riots in Atlanta, during the week
preceding the balloting, were a
great factor in the last-minute
switching of voters to the sup
port of segregationist Lester
Maddox.
I am from the South myself
and definitely support the ef
forts of men such as Congress
man Weltner in civil rights. I
do believe he would appreciate
the assistance of the Negroes,
members of SNCC, SDS, etc.
You might direct considerably
more effort towards persuading
the Negro that "Black Power"
civil disobedience is sending you
nowhere but backwards. I know
it is not really the "in" thing to
do, but you might also try the
old fashioned tactic—try acting
like American citizens. It may
work wonders

• Delayed Comment
Editor, The Daily:
Although a sabbatical absence
from the campus is delaying a
reaction to the October 21 issue
of The Daily, I would like to
express my shock and disgust
with the two fraternity actions
reported there, the mistreatment
of Dave Harris and the pilfering
of 10,000 copies of The Dally.
The two incidents show that
in the two fraternities concerned
an intolerant element has gained
the upper hand. I cannot laugh
these happenings off as pranks.
Rather'l think they illustrate
how in the "traditional" fratern
ity the dignity of the individual
may be subjugated to the rule
of the mob.
On the other hand I am very
encouraged to see that several
of Stanford's fraternities are
freeing themselves from "tradi
tion." Thereby they are making
small-group living a worthy ex
perience. In particular I would
like to congratulate the fratern
ity who has abolished the rush
and opened its door to all stu

dents. If it is able to limit its
membership by means of digni
fied criteria, it will make a val
uable contribution to the de
velopment of fraternities on our
campus.

• ISo Cover Story
Editor, The Daily:
Randy Bonner's blanket de
scription of Stanford fraternities
as "parastic" falls into the same
trap of fallacious argumentation
which seems to typify so many
letters to The Daily. It was
typical in its use of a highly
loaded, connotative word in an
analogy which he seemed unwill
ing to carry to any logical con
clusion.
The essence of Randy's argu
ment is that an institution must
"justify its existence by acting in
a creative capacity within its en

vironment." Thus, Stanford Uni
versity justifies its existence in ,
American society by furthering <
the aims of education. The ques- !
tion in relation to the various ;
living groups then becomes |
whether they detract from the
aims of their environment, the |
University.
Fraternities at Stanford are
simply one of several alterna
tives for living; they constitute J
an environment in which an in- t
dividual can live in close proxim- J
ity with a large group of friends 1
within a social and educational;
context. Obviously, a fraternity
can be either conducive or detri-1
mental to the aims ol' the Uni-j
versity; it is the particular mem- j
bership which makes it so. There j
is nothing inherent in any of!
these systems which guarantees |
or prevents harmony with the j
University.

I am deeply saddened and dis

ment of the fraternity study
committee. I feel that I must
reply to the accusations made
by Jan Jacobi in that statement.
The former subcommittee dis
solved in mass confusion on
Tuesday, October 25th. At that
time the three co-chairmen (Joel
Kugelmass, Kit Anderton, and
I) met to give direction to the
subcommittee. The subcommit
tee had originally been struc

know it was a mistake. It was
both politically unsophisticated
and morally wrong.
On a TV interview in answer
to one question I said that the
skin painting bit was solely for
the purpose of raising money
for SNCC and in line with the
Artist Liberation Front's demon
strations in support of the black
people of Hunters Point in their
struggle with the City Fathers.
But in fact this answer only
clouds the question.

The skin painting and carni
val-like afternoon of the Black
Power Day was wrong political
ly because it covered up the seri
ousness of the Black Power line
in terms of solid work both for
blacks and the white activists
who support Black Power. The
skin painting affair fits into the
liberal's bag about skin color
being meaningless and to
achieve integration skin color
must be made irrelevant by the
white culture completely swal
lowing up the black. This line
covers over the Black Power cry
that white society must recog
nize black culture as black and
that self-determination for
blacks must be in terms of
blacks instead of the sugary lib
eral line that there is no real
black culture but we all must
work together in terms of that
white culture.
As whites we can surely play
around with colors (painting
skin and all) as much as we
want but we can't play games
with somebody elses skin when
the color is a definative term in
that culture called black.
The evening conference on the
other hand didn't present these
faults of the afternoon. For ex
a m pi e when Mark Comfort
spoke the audience was made
aware of their color and knew
they were listening to a black
man who not only told it like it
is but said what we as whites
must now begin doing in our
own community both in terms
of organizing other whites who
have the same enemies as blacks
and in terms of understanding
whose culture is crushing
whose. ALAN SCHMIDT, SDS

Mr. Lirange's comments are

Although a sabbatical absence
from the campus is delaying a

of The Daily, I would like to
express my shock and disgust
with the two fraternity actions
reported there, the mistreatment
of Dave Harris and the pilfering
of 10,000 copies of The Dally.
The two incidents show that
in the two fraternities concerned
an intolerant element has gained
the upper hand. I cannot laugh
these happenings off as pranks.
Rather'l think they illustrate
how in the "traditional" fratern

may be subjugated to the rule
of the mob.
On the other hand I am very
encouraged to see that several
of Stanford's fraternities are
freeing themselves from "tradi
tion." Thereby they are making
small-group living a worthy ex
perience. In particular I would
like to congratulate the fratern
ity who has abolished the rush
and opened its door to all stu

dents. If it is able to limit its

Randy Bonner's blanket de

as "parastic" falls into the same
trap of fallacious argumentation
which seems to typify so many
letters to The Daily. It was
typical in its use of a highly
loaded, connotative word in an
analogy which he seemed unwill
ing to carry to any logical con
clusion.
The essence of Randy's argu
ment is that an institution must
"justify its existence by acting in
a creative capacity within its en

vironment." Thus, Stanford Uni
versity justifies its existence in ,
American society by furthering <
the aims of education. The ques- !
tion in relation to the various ;
living groups then becomes |
whether they detract from the
aims of their environment, the |

Fraternities at Stanford are
simply one of several alterna
tives for living; they constitute J
an environment in which an in- t
dividual can live in close proxim- J
ity with a large group of friends 1
within a social and educational;
context. Obviously, a fraternity
can be either conducive or detri-1

STEVEN H. LEVINSON
Editor, The Dally:
I am deeply saddened and dis
tressed by the article in The
Daily regarding the re-establish
ment of the fraternity study
committee. I feel that I must
reply to the accusations made
by Jan Jacobi in that statement.
The former subcommittee dis
solved in mass confusion on
Tuesday, October 25th. At that
time the three co-chairmen (Joel
Kugelmass, Kit Anderton, and
I) met to give direction to the
subcommittee. The subcommit
tee had originally been struc
tured with an antifraternity co
chairman (Kugelmass), a pro
fraternity co-chairman (myself),
and a neutral (Anderton). This
structure was intended to pro
vide a means to study the fra
ternity system objectively. In
the course of the discussion
what had been implicitly known
all along became explicit. Ander
ton was by no stretch of the im
agination a neutral; he was
firmly in Kuglemass's camp.
They also, frankly, admitted
that they could not work ob
jectively in studying fraterni
ties. To them I was, indeed, an
obstructionist; because I would
not let them use the subcom
mittee as a propaganda vehicle
in their campaign to abolish
fraternities. I left the meeting
deeply disturbed and full well
knowing that I would be forced
to resign from the subcommit
tee.
I did not give up, however. In
a second attempt to solve the
problem, I attended a meeting
of the entire housing commis
sion the following day. Kugel
mass reported to the commis
sion the occurrences of the pre
vious night. His report ended
with the bald statement that he
could not work for fraternities;
he could only work against.
From then on there was no dia
logue. There was hardly even a
mention of objectivity. No one
was listening to me; nor did
they wish to listen. As I stated
when I left, they were no longer
discussing whether or not to
find an objective structure for
the subcommittee. They were
discussing the best possible
means in which to use the sub
committee for propaganda pur
poses.
Kugelmass and Anderton by
their actions forced me into ad
vocating the pro-fraternity posi
tion. I have since been forced
to resign—as I predicted. When
it became obvious that nothing
of a propaganda nature could
be accomplished over me, Kugel
mass took over the committee.
I was content to allow this to
happen without exposing the
situation. Since I made this de
cision Jacobi has attacked my
intellectual integrity. He has
sought to Strengthen the new
committee's position by invec
tive and diatribe aimed at me;
This, then, is my reply.
DALE L. MATSCHULLAT
• Fre Had It
Editor, The Daily:
I've had it! Absolutely had it!
I do not wish to see Dr. Walker
crucified, nor the Overseas Cam
pus program. Nor do I wish to
see Miss Ackerley drawn and
quartered for her Austria series.
On the contrary, I thank her for
it. No matter how well or badly
researched and written her ar
ticles have been, they have
served the purpose of stimulat
ing some much needed critical
discussion. I say "some" critical
discussion. These articles have
also stimulated a great many
people to add to the volume of
remarks which pass the buck
and blame everybody else from
Dr. Walker to Campus Alumni
to the European maids for the
problems their groups encoun
tered overseas.
I cannot really believe that
Stanford students, for example,
are so dim-witted that they will
take the term "European Ex
perience" literally. One cannot
really expect to cross the face
of Western Europe in three
well-planned three day week
ends. The Martindale Report, if
anybody had taken the trouble
to read it last Spring, would
have demonstrated to all you
complaining souls that a group
of students had sat down and
seriously considered the prob
lem of travel, and more particu
larly the problems of academic
excellence. Fifteen to thirty of
us put in a great deal of time,
effort and imagination. We at
tempted to redefine the over
seas experience in terms more
suited to what it is since it Is
NOT an "European Experience."
We put forth several proposals,

the bulk of the report, aimed at
cutting the academic load, while
increasing the content, variety,
excellence and relevance of the
courses.
It's all there in adequate, or
ganized prose. I would urge my
friends on the Overseas Campus
Board to attempt to make avail
able copies of the Martindale re
port. And I would urge even
more strongly that the stu-fac
committee, created as a perman
ent reviewing body, get hopping.
With all due respect to the fac
ulty and administrators in
volved, there is a definite ten
dency in the Overseas Campus
area to try to keep the lid on
and lie low until the issue blows
over and is forgotten. And to
forget about improving a pro
gram in which 55 per cent of
the undergrad population, and
a goodly number of professors
spend six months of their aca
demic time and approximately
$800-$lOOO of extra spending
money, would be intolerable.

• El Gruppo
Editor, The Dally:
At some point in the current
controversy about foreign cam
puses, Dr. Walker was said to
feel that some changes were
needed in the process of selec
ting students for each group.
The implication was that the
selectors, whoever they are,
should try harder to put togeth
er groups that would be group
ier. I thing the word "jell" is the
current favorite.
Now it seems to me that the
basic flaw here is the notion that
groups should necessarily be
groupy at all. The administra
tive types think they should be.
And I remember when I was in
France a few years ago, we
students used to hear dark
mumblings that we were a
"bad" group.
It is true that the group ten
ded to split into cliques, though
I don't like to use that word. It's
also true that some students
spent all their free time playing
bridge instead of going out on
the town or skipping off to
Paris.
Let us put aside for the mo
ment considerations of how this
administrative brooding affected
the group's morale. (Did some
body mention morale?) The
question is, why did this make
us a BAD group?
The answer is, we were a bad
group because the administra
tors and professors called us a
a bad group. I maintain, how
ever, being a bad group in the
sense of not having jelled is not
necessarily a bad thing.
Dr. Walker, I am sure, has
some grasp of the idea of the
European Experience. But he
forgets that its an intensely per
sonal experience and that the
group, as a big happy bowl of
Jell-o, is irrelevant.
Furthermore, I suspect that
his idea of a good group is one
that gets along with the foreign
campus administration and
doesn't complain about holes in
the wall lousy courses and bad
weather.
I suggest that Dr. Walker for
get about group solidarity and
leave the selection process alone.
If a group has more than its
share of loners, or cliques, we
should not worry our little
heads about it. And if the stu
dents complain about some
thing, let Dr. Walker set his
busy administrative mind to
ironing the problem out before
the students revolt.
CHRISTOPHER HARGROVE
• Rampant Haight
Editor, The DaUy:
I would like to comment on
Tim Haight's column in last
Friday's Daily. It seems to me
that Mr. Haight is generally
pretty squared away in his
views, and some of the profes
sional ragers with which our
fair campus abounds could fol
low his example of taste and re

straint to good advantage for
themselves and the campus in
general.
In this particular Haight con
tribution, I especially agree with
the idea that something must be
done about the science require
ment. The general studies-type
science courses here (with a
rare, sparkling exception) are
miserably taught, shabbily or
ganized, and unsupportably bor
ing.
The idea of requiring a stu
dent who upon graduation will
probably try to pass himself off
as having had a well-rounded
education to become acquainted
with some science is not a bad
one, and is probably even essen
tial in our modern age. But the
General Studies Committee, or
whatever the lodge that runs
that business calls itself, should
realize the fact that requiring
an ungodly number of boring,
incompetently taught units
(mainly at 8 a.m. in the morn
ing yet) will only serve to turn
off us poor music and b.s. ma
jors to the entire subject. I took
one quarter of Physical Sci
ences, complete with marathon
lab, and have never been so con
fused in all my life. The profes
sor (whose name I forget)
seemed to have a general idea
of what was going on, but the
lab TA was one of the most dis
organized, persons I have ever
met.
In short, my suggestion is
that the science requirement be
kept, perhaps with a reduced
number of units required, but
that courses be reoriented to
ward the non-scientific person.
Perhaps a study of the history
of scientific development, with
emphasis on its relation to his
tory in general, might be
worked out. This should be
taught by some professor who
can tell his bifocals from a mar
tini glass, and probably should
not have a lab. If done right,
the course would give us non
atomic types an idea of what the
hell science has been doing all
this time, and should manage to
get other people keyed enough
to look into science as a field
in which to spend their lives.

• Unsophisticated
Editor, The Dally:
John McClusky's attack on
"Black Day" in Monday's Daily
was certainly in order. I speak
as an organizer of that day.
First, however, let it be noted
that it was The Daily that
changed SDS's "Black Power
Day" to "Black Day". And sec
ondly, that the absurd front
page statement in The Daily en
titled "Be Colored" was not from
an SDS pen. Granted, SDS did
sponsor the afternoon skin
painting affair, but now we
know it was a mistake. It was
both politically unsophisticated
and morally wrong.
On a TV interview in answer
to one question I said that the

mittee as a propaganda vehicle
in their campaign to abolish
fraternities. I left the meeting
deeply disturbed and full well
knowing that I would be forced
to resign from the subcommit
tee.
I did not give up, however. In
a second attempt to solve the
problem, I attended a meeting
of the entire housing commis
sion the following day. Kugel
mass reported to the commis
sion the occurrences of the pre
vious night. His report ended
with the bald statement that he
could not work for fraternities;
he could only work against.
From then on there was no dia
logue. There was hardly even a
mention of objectivity. No one
was listening to me; nor did
they wish to listen. As I stated
when I left, they were no longer
discussing whether or not to
find an objective structure for
the subcommittee. They were
discussing the best possible
means in which to use the sub
committee for propaganda pur
poses.
Kugelmass and Anderton by
their actions forced me into ad
vocating the pro-fraternity posi
tion. I have since been forced
to resign—as I predicted. When
it became obvious that nothing
of a propaganda nature could
be accomplished over me, Kugel
mass took over the committee.
I was content to allow this to
happen without exposing the
situation. Since I made this de
cision Jacobi has attacked my
intellectual integrity. He has
sought to Strengthen the new
committee's position by invec
tive and diatribe aimed at me;
This, then, is my reply.

Editor, The Daily:
I've had it! Absolutely had it!
I do not wish to see Dr. Walker

see Miss Ackerley drawn and
quartered for her Austria series.
On the contrary, I thank her for
it. No matter how well or badly

served the purpose of stimulat
ing some much needed critical
discussion. I say "some" critical
discussion. These articles have
also stimulated a great many
people to add to the volume of
remarks which pass the buck
and blame everybody else from
Dr. Walker to Campus Alumni
to the European maids for the
problems their groups encoun
tered overseas.
I cannot really believe that
Stanford students, for example,
are so dim-witted that they will
take the term "European Ex
perience" literally. One cannot
really expect to cross the face
of Western Europe in three
well-planned three day week
ends. The Martindale Report, if
anybody had taken the trouble
to read it last Spring, would
have demonstrated to all you
complaining souls that a group
of students had sat down and
seriously considered the prob
lem of travel, and more particu
larly the problems of academic
excellence. Fifteen to thirty of
us put in a great deal of time,
effort and imagination. We at
tempted to redefine the over
seas experience in terms more
suited to what it is since it Is
NOT an "European Experience."
We put forth several proposals,

the bulk of the report, aimed at
cutting the academic load, while
increasing the content, variety,
excellence and relevance of the
courses.
It's all there in adequate, or
ganized prose. I would urge my
friends on the Overseas Campus
Board to attempt to make avail
able copies of the Martindale re
port. And I would urge even
more strongly that the stu-fac

With all due respect to the fac

dency in the Overseas Campus

over and is forgotten. And to
forget about improving a pro

a goodly number of professors

• El Gruppo
Editor, The Dally:
At some point in the current
controversy about foreign cam
puses, Dr. Walker was said to
feel that some changes were
needed in the process of selec
ting students for each group.
The implication was that the
selectors, whoever they are,
should try harder to put togeth
er groups that would be group
ier. I thing the word "jell" is the
current favorite.
Now it seems to me that the
basic flaw here is the notion that
groups should necessarily be
groupy at all. The administra
tive types think they should be.
And I remember when I was in
France a few years ago, we
students used to hear dark
mumblings that we were a
"bad" group.
It is true that the group ten
ded to split into cliques, though
I don't like to use that word. It's
also true that some students
spent all their free time playing
bridge instead of going out on
the town or skipping off to
Paris.
Let us put aside for the mo
ment considerations of how this
administrative brooding affected
the group's morale. (Did some
body mention morale?) The
question is, why did this make
us a BAD group?
The answer is, we were a bad
group because the administra
tors and professors called us a
a bad group. I maintain, how
ever, being a bad group in the
sense of not having jelled is not
necessarily a bad thing.
Dr. Walker, I am sure, has
some grasp of the idea of the
European Experience. But he
forgets that its an intensely per
sonal experience and that the
group, as a big happy bowl of
Jell-o, is irrelevant.
Furthermore, I suspect that
his idea of a good group is one
that gets along with the foreign
campus administration and
doesn't complain about holes in
the wall lousy courses and bad
weather.
I suggest that Dr. Walker for
get about group solidarity and
leave the selection process alone.
If a group has more than its
share of loners, or cliques, we
should not worry our little
heads about it. And if the stu
dents complain about some
thing, let Dr. Walker set his
busy administrative mind to
ironing the problem out before

• Rampant Haight
Editor, The DaUy:
I would like to comment on
Tim Haight's column in last
Friday's Daily. It seems to me
that Mr. Haight is generally
pretty squared away in his
views, and some of the profes
sional ragers with which our
fair campus abounds could fol
low his example of taste and re

straint to good advantage for
themselves and the campus in
general.
In this particular Haight con
tribution, I especially agree with
the idea that something must be
done about the science require
ment. The general studies-type
science courses here (with a
rare, sparkling exception) are
miserably taught, shabbily or
ganized, and unsupportably bor
ing.
The idea of requiring a stu
dent who upon graduation will
probably try to pass himself off
as having had a well-rounded
education to become acquainted
with some science is not a bad
one, and is probably even essen
tial in our modern age. But the
General Studies Committee, or
whatever the lodge that runs
that business calls itself, should
realize the fact that requiring
an ungodly number of boring,
incompetently taught units
(mainly at 8 a.m. in the morn
ing yet) will only serve to turn
off us poor music and b.s. ma
jors to the entire subject. I took
one quarter of Physical Sci
ences, complete with marathon
lab, and have never been so con
fused in all my life. The profes
sor (whose name I forget)
seemed to have a general idea
of what was going on, but the
lab TA was one of the most dis
organized, persons I have ever
met.
In short, my suggestion is
that the science requirement be
kept, perhaps with a reduced
number of units required, but
that courses be reoriented to
ward the non-scientific person.
Perhaps a study of the history
of scientific development, with
emphasis on its relation to his
tory in general, might be
worked out. This should be
taught by some professor who
can tell his bifocals from a mar
tini glass, and probably should
not have a lab. If done right,
the course would give us non
atomic types an idea of what the
hell science has been doing all
this time, and should manage to
get other people keyed enough
to look into science as a field
in which to spend their lives.

• Unsophisticated
Editor, The Dally:
John McClusky's attack on
"Black Day" in Monday's Daily
was certainly in order. I speak
as an organizer of that day.
First, however, let it be noted
that it was The Daily that
changed SDS's "Black Power
Day" to "Black Day". And sec
ondly, that the absurd front
page statement in The Daily en
titled "Be Colored" was not from
an SDS pen. Granted, SDS did
sponsor the afternoon skin
painting affair, but now we
know it was a mistake. It was
both politically unsophisticated
and morally wrong.
On a TV interview in answer
to one question I said that the
skin painting bit was solely for
the purpose of raising money
for SNCC and in line with the
Artist Liberation Front's demon
strations in support of the black
people of Hunters Point in their
struggle with the City Fathers.
But in fact this answer only
clouds the question.

The skin painting and carni
val-like afternoon of the Black
Power Day was wrong political
ly because it covered up the seri
ousness of the Black Power line
in terms of solid work both for
blacks and the white activists
who support Black Power. The
skin painting affair fits into the
liberal's bag about skin color
being meaningless and to
achieve integration skin color
must be made irrelevant by the
white culture completely swal
lowing up the black. This line
covers over the Black Power cry
that white society must recog
nize black culture as black and
that self-determination for
blacks must be in terms of
blacks instead of the sugary lib
eral line that there is no real
black culture but we all must
work together in terms of that
white culture.
As whites we can surely play
around with colors (painting
skin and all) as much as we
want but we can't play games
with somebody elses skin when
the color is a definative term in
that culture called black.
The evening conference on the
other hand didn't present these
faults of the afternoon. For ex
a m pi e when Mark Comfort
spoke the audience was made
aware of their color and knew
they were listening to a black
man who not only told it like it
is but said what we as whites
must now begin doing in our
own community both in terms
of organizing other whites who
have the same enemies as blacks
and in terms of understanding
whose culture is crushing
whose. ALAN SCHMIDT, SDS
• Surprise!
Editor, The Daily:
In the aftermath of the wave
of fraternity comment in The
Daily, I had a chance to pene
trate the inner court of one of
them recently. Theta Chi in
vited me to a barbecue.
The event was distinguished in
my mind not so much by the
pleasant company, food, and
drink as by the fact that the
fraternity was less insular, and
more open, friendly, and willing
to discuss their role on cam
pus than I had believed possi
ble in the light of my non-fra
ternity background stereotype of
a fraternity.
I left the house with the feel
ing that if we as human beings
are to find our way to a brother
hood of man, then perhaps the
first step is to band together
in groups, however small, and
actively participate in the build
ing of such a brotherhood.

• Oop'Art
Editor, The DaUy:
Regarding the article on the
Stanford Student Art Show
(Friday, Oct. 28), once again
the Daily showed its inability to
be journalistically accurate. The
Daily has presented half-truths
and implications that are totally
unfounded.
By publishing the photograph
of a painting with the article,
the Dally inaccurately linked the
two. After talking with Mr. Lir
ange about his critical review
of the art show, it was found
that he had never seen the paint
ing pictured with the headline
"Atrocity claims art show cri
tic." Furthermore, according to

Mr. Lirange, the most pertinent
part of his article was deleted as
a result of the editing liberties
taken by the Daily. Should we
interpret the Daily's actions as
an attempt to sensationalize, or
should we consider its actions as
an attempt to distort the facts
in favor of its own interpreta
tion?
Mr. Lirange's comments are
indeed valid, but, in fact, his
article was not meant to focus
on any particular work as im
plied by the singling-out of one
painting which was not even
exhibited when the a ut ho r
visited the show. Mr. Lirange
however should share some of
this responsibility since h e
based his article on a cursory
examination of the exhibition
before it was totally set-up.

• A Missed Point
Editor, The Daily:
I believe Miss Anderson did
not remain in Cubberley Audi
torium to hear all of the ques
tion-answer period following the
presentation by Georgia's Con
gresman Charles Weltner last
Wednesday evening. She omitted
in her Daily coverage the fol
lowing day an emphatic point
brought out by Mr. Weltner: In
his opinion, no matter how many
4 1/2-hour Teach-ins on "The Va
rieties of Black Power" are held,
the definition of "Black Power"
as intended by Mr. Carmichael is
contained only in one word —
VlOLENCE—period.
Mr. Weltner also was con
vinced that Mr. Carmichael has
become a prime recruiter for the
Ku Klux Klan: we have orga
nized "Black Power"—so why
not have organized "White Pow
er." it was also brought out
by Mr. Weltner that the Negro
riots in Atlanta, during the week
preceding the balloting, were a
great factor in the last-minute
switching of voters to the sup
port of segregationist Lester
Maddox.
I am from the South myself
and definitely support the ef
forts of men such as Congress
man Weltner in civil rights. I
do believe he would appreciate
the assistance of the Negroes,
members of SNCC, SDS, etc.
You might direct considerably
more effort towards persuading
the Negro that "Black Power"
civil disobedience is sending you
nowhere but backwards. I know
it is not really the "in" thing to
do, but you might also try the
old fashioned tactic—try acting
like American citizens. It may
work wonders

• Delayed Comment
Editor, The Daily:
Although a sabbatical absence
from the campus is delaying a
reaction to the October 21 issue
of The Daily, I would like to
express my shock and disgust
with the two fraternity actions
reported there, the mistreatment
of Dave Harris and the pilfering
of 10,000 copies of The Dally.
The two incidents show that
in the two fraternities concerned
an intolerant element has gained
the upper hand. I cannot laugh
these happenings off as pranks.
Rather'l think they illustrate
how in the "traditional" fratern
ity the dignity of the individual
may be subjugated to the rule
of the mob.
On the other hand I am very
encouraged to see that several
of Stanford's fraternities are
freeing themselves from "tradi
tion." Thereby they are making
small-group living a worthy ex
perience. In particular I would
like to congratulate the fratern
ity who has abolished the rush
and opened its door to all stu

dents. If it is able to limit its
membership by means of digni
fied criteria, it will make a val
uable contribution to the de
velopment of fraternities on our
campus.

• ISo Cover Story
Editor, The Daily:
Randy Bonner's blanket de
scription of Stanford fraternities
as "parastic" falls into the same
trap of fallacious argumentation
which seems to typify so many
letters to The Daily. It was
typical in its use of a highly
loaded, connotative word in an
analogy which he seemed unwill
ing to carry to any logical con
clusion.
The essence of Randy's argu
ment is that an institution must
"justify its existence by acting in
a creative capacity within its en

vironment." Thus, Stanford Uni
versity justifies its existence in ,
American society by furthering <
the aims of education. The ques- !
tion in relation to the various ;
living groups then becomes |
whether they detract from the
aims of their environment, the |
University.
Fraternities at Stanford are
simply one of several alterna
tives for living; they constitute J
an environment in which an in- t
dividual can live in close proxim- J
ity with a large group of friends 1
within a social and educational;
context. Obviously, a fraternity
can be either conducive or detri-1
mental to the aims ol' the Uni-j
versity; it is the particular mem- j
bership which makes it so. There j
is nothing inherent in any of!
these systems which guarantees |
or prevents harmony with the j
University.

Editor, The Dally:
I am deeply saddened and dis
tressed by the article in The
Daily regarding the re-establish
ment of the fraternity study
committee. I feel that I must
reply to the accusations made
by Jan Jacobi in that statement.
The former subcommittee dis
solved in mass confusion on
Tuesday, October 25th. At that
time the three co-chairmen (Joel
Kugelmass, Kit Anderton, and
I) met to give direction to the
subcommittee. The subcommit
tee had originally been struc
tured with an antifraternity co
chairman (Kugelmass), a pro
fraternity co-chairman (myself),
and a neutral (Anderton). This
structure was intended to pro
vide a means to study the fra
ternity system objectively. In
the course of the discussion
what had been implicitly known
all along became explicit. Ander
ton was by no stretch of the im
agination a neutral; he was
firmly in Kuglemass's camp.
They also, frankly, admitted
that they could not work ob
jectively in studying fraterni
ties. To them I was, indeed, an
obstructionist; because I would
not let them use the subcom
mittee as a propaganda vehicle
in their campaign to abolish
fraternities. I left the meeting
deeply disturbed and full well
knowing that I would be forced
to resign from the subcommit
tee.
I did not give up, however. In

By publishing the photograph

the Dally inaccurately linked the

of the art show, it was found
that he had never seen the paint
ing pictured with the headline

Mr. Lirange, the most pertinent

a result of the editing liberties

interpret the Daily's actions as

should we consider its actions as
an attempt to distort the facts
in favor of its own interpreta

Mr. Lirange's comments are

not have organized "White Pow

Although a sabbatical absence
from the campus is delaying a
reaction to the October 21 issue
of The Daily, I would like to
express my shock and disgust
with the two fraternity actions
reported there, the mistreatment
of Dave Harris and the pilfering
of 10,000 copies of The Dally.
The two incidents show that
in the two fraternities concerned
an intolerant element has gained
the upper hand. I cannot laugh
these happenings off as pranks.
Rather'l think they illustrate
how in the "traditional" fratern
ity the dignity of the individual
may be subjugated to the rule
of the mob.
On the other hand I am very
encouraged to see that several
of Stanford's fraternities are
freeing themselves from "tradi
tion." Thereby they are making
small-group living a worthy ex
perience. In particular I would
like to congratulate the fratern
ity who has abolished the rush
and opened its door to all stu

dents. If it is able to limit its
membership by means of digni

Randy Bonner's blanket de

as "parastic" falls into the same

which seems to typify so many

typical in its use of a highly
loaded, connotative word in an

The essence of Randy's argu

whether they detract from the

Fraternities at Stanford are
simply one of several alterna

an environment in which an in- t

within a social and educational;

STEVEN H. LEVINSON
Editor, The Dally:
I am deeply saddened and dis
tressed by the article in The
Daily regarding the re-establish
ment of the fraternity study
committee. I feel that I must
reply to the accusations made
by Jan Jacobi in that statement.
The former subcommittee dis
solved in mass confusion on
Tuesday, October 25th. At that
time the three co-chairmen (Joel
Kugelmass, Kit Anderton, and
I) met to give direction to the
subcommittee. The subcommit
tee had originally been struc
tured with an antifraternity co
chairman (Kugelmass), a pro
fraternity co-chairman (myself),
and a neutral (Anderton). This
structure was intended to pro
vide a means to study the fra
ternity system objectively. In
the course of the discussion
what had been implicitly known
all along became explicit. Ander
ton was by no stretch of the im
agination a neutral; he was
firmly in Kuglemass's camp.
They also, frankly, admitted
that they could not work ob
jectively in studying fraterni
ties. To them I was, indeed, an
obstructionist; because I would
not let them use the subcom
mittee as a propaganda vehicle
in their campaign to abolish
fraternities. I left the meeting
deeply disturbed and full well
knowing that I would be forced
to resign from the subcommit
tee.
I did not give up, however. In
a second attempt to solve the
problem, I attended a meeting
of the entire housing commis
sion the following day. Kugel
mass reported to the commis
sion the occurrences of the pre
vious night. His report ended
with the bald statement that he
could not work for fraternities;
he could only work against.
From then on there was no dia
logue. There was hardly even a
mention of objectivity. No one
was listening to me; nor did
they wish to listen. As I stated
when I left, they were no longer
discussing whether or not to
find an objective structure for
the subcommittee. They were
discussing the best possible
means in which to use the sub
committee for propaganda pur
poses.
Kugelmass and Anderton by
their actions forced me into ad
vocating the pro-fraternity posi
tion. I have since been forced
to resign—as I predicted. When
it became obvious that nothing
of a propaganda nature could
be accomplished over me, Kugel
mass took over the committee.
I was content to allow this to
happen without exposing the
situation. Since I made this de
cision Jacobi has attacked my
intellectual integrity. He has
sought to Strengthen the new
committee's position by invec
tive and diatribe aimed at me;
This, then, is my reply.
DALE L. MATSCHULLAT
• Fre Had It
Editor, The Daily:
I've had it! Absolutely had it!
I do not wish to see Dr. Walker
crucified, nor the Overseas Cam
pus program. Nor do I wish to
see Miss Ackerley drawn and
quartered for her Austria series.
On the contrary, I thank her for
it. No matter how well or badly
researched and written her ar
ticles have been, they have
served the purpose of stimulat
ing some much needed critical
discussion. I say "some" critical
discussion. These articles have
also stimulated a great many
people to add to the volume of
remarks which pass the buck
and blame everybody else from
Dr. Walker to Campus Alumni
to the European maids for the
problems their groups encoun
tered overseas.
I cannot really believe that
Stanford students, for example,
are so dim-witted that they will
take the term "European Ex
perience" literally. One cannot
really expect to cross the face
of Western Europe in three
well-planned three day week
ends. The Martindale Report, if
anybody had taken the trouble
to read it last Spring, would
have demonstrated to all you
complaining souls that a group
of students had sat down and
seriously considered the prob
lem of travel, and more particu
larly the problems of academic
excellence. Fifteen to thirty of
us put in a great deal of time,
effort and imagination. We at
tempted to redefine the over
seas experience in terms more
suited to what it is since it Is
NOT an "European Experience."
We put forth several proposals,

the bulk of the report, aimed at
cutting the academic load, while
increasing the content, variety,
excellence and relevance of the
courses.
It's all there in adequate, or
ganized prose. I would urge my
friends on the Overseas Campus
Board to attempt to make avail
able copies of the Martindale re
port. And I would urge even
more strongly that the stu-fac
committee, created as a perman
ent reviewing body, get hopping.
With all due respect to the fac
ulty and administrators in
volved, there is a definite ten
dency in the Overseas Campus
area to try to keep the lid on
and lie low until the issue blows
over and is forgotten. And to
forget about improving a pro
gram in which 55 per cent of
the undergrad population, and
a goodly number of professors
spend six months of their aca
demic time and approximately
$800-$lOOO of extra spending
money, would be intolerable.

• El Gruppo
Editor, The Dally:
At some point in the current
controversy about foreign cam
puses, Dr. Walker was said to
feel that some changes were
needed in the process of selec
ting students for each group.
The implication was that the
selectors, whoever they are,
should try harder to put togeth
er groups that would be group
ier. I thing the word "jell" is the
current favorite.
Now it seems to me that the
basic flaw here is the notion that
groups should necessarily be
groupy at all. The administra
tive types think they should be.
And I remember when I was in
France a few years ago, we
students used to hear dark
mumblings that we were a
"bad" group.
It is true that the group ten
ded to split into cliques, though
I don't like to use that word. It's
also true that some students
spent all their free time playing
bridge instead of going out on
the town or skipping off to
Paris.
Let us put aside for the mo
ment considerations of how this
administrative brooding affected
the group's morale. (Did some
body mention morale?) The
question is, why did this make
us a BAD group?
The answer is, we were a bad
group because the administra
tors and professors called us a
a bad group. I maintain, how
ever, being a bad group in the
sense of not having jelled is not
necessarily a bad thing.
Dr. Walker, I am sure, has
some grasp of the idea of the
European Experience. But he
forgets that its an intensely per
sonal experience and that the
group, as a big happy bowl of
Jell-o, is irrelevant.
Furthermore, I suspect that
his idea of a good group is one
that gets along with the foreign
campus administration and
doesn't complain about holes in
the wall lousy courses and bad
weather.
I suggest that Dr. Walker for
get about group solidarity and
leave the selection process alone.
If a group has more than its
share of loners, or cliques, we
should not worry our little
heads about it. And if the stu
dents complain about some
thing, let Dr. Walker set his
busy administrative mind to
ironing the problem out before
the students revolt.
CHRISTOPHER HARGROVE
• Rampant Haight
Editor, The DaUy:
I would like to comment on
Tim Haight's column in last
Friday's Daily. It seems to me
that Mr. Haight is generally
pretty squared away in his
views, and some of the profes
sional ragers with which our
fair campus abounds could fol
low his example of taste and re

straint to good advantage for
themselves and the campus in
general.
In this particular Haight con
tribution, I especially agree with
the idea that something must be
done about the science require
ment. The general studies-type
science courses here (with a
rare, sparkling exception) are
miserably taught, shabbily or
ganized, and unsupportably bor
ing.
The idea of requiring a stu
dent who upon graduation will
probably try to pass himself off
as having had a well-rounded
education to become acquainted
with some science is not a bad
one, and is probably even essen
tial in our modern age. But the
General Studies Committee, or
whatever the lodge that runs
that business calls itself, should
realize the fact that requiring
an ungodly number of boring,
incompetently taught units
(mainly at 8 a.m. in the morn
ing yet) will only serve to turn
off us poor music and b.s. ma
jors to the entire subject. I took
one quarter of Physical Sci
ences, complete with marathon
lab, and have never been so con
fused in all my life. The profes
sor (whose name I forget)
seemed to have a general idea
of what was going on, but the
lab TA was one of the most dis
organized, persons I have ever
met.
In short, my suggestion is
that the science requirement be
kept, perhaps with a reduced
number of units required, but
that courses be reoriented to
ward the non-scientific person.
Perhaps a study of the history
of scientific development, with
emphasis on its relation to his
tory in general, might be
worked out. This should be
taught by some professor who
can tell his bifocals from a mar
tini glass, and probably should
not have a lab. If done right,
the course would give us non
atomic types an idea of what the
hell science has been doing all
this time, and should manage to
get other people keyed enough
to look into science as a field
in which to spend their lives.

• Unsophisticated
Editor, The Dally:
John McClusky's attack on
"Black Day" in Monday's Daily
was certainly in order. I speak
as an organizer of that day.
First, however, let it be noted
that it was The Daily that
changed SDS's "Black Power
Day" to "Black Day". And sec
ondly, that the absurd front
page statement in The Daily en
titled "Be Colored" was not from
an SDS pen. Granted, SDS did
sponsor the afternoon skin
painting affair, but now we
know it was a mistake. It was
both politically unsophisticated
and morally wrong.
On a TV interview in answer
to one question I said that the
skin painting bit was solely for
the purpose of raising money
for SNCC and in line with the
Artist Liberation Front's demon
strations in support of the black
people of Hunters Point in their
struggle with the City Fathers.
But in fact this answer only
clouds the question.

The skin painting and carni
val-like afternoon of the Black
Power Day was wrong political
ly because it covered up the seri
ousness of the Black Power line
in terms of solid work both for
blacks and the white activists
who support Black Power. The
skin painting affair fits into the
liberal's bag about skin color
being meaningless and to
achieve integration skin color
must be made irrelevant by the
white culture completely swal
lowing up the black. This line

that white society must recog

Editor, The Daily:
I've had it! Absolutely had it!
I do not wish to see Dr. Walker

see Miss Ackerley drawn and
quartered for her Austria series.
On the contrary, I thank her for
it. No matter how well or badly
researched and written her ar

served the purpose of stimulat
ing some much needed critical
discussion. I say "some" critical
discussion. These articles have
also stimulated a great many
people to add to the volume of
remarks which pass the buck
and blame everybody else from
Dr. Walker to Campus Alumni
to the European maids for the
problems their groups encoun
tered overseas.
I cannot really believe that
Stanford students, for example,
are so dim-witted that they will
take the term "European Ex
perience" literally. One cannot
really expect to cross the face
of Western Europe in three
well-planned three day week
ends. The Martindale Report, if
anybody had taken the trouble
to read it last Spring, would
have demonstrated to all you
complaining souls that a group
of students had sat down and
seriously considered the prob
lem of travel, and more particu
larly the problems of academic
excellence. Fifteen to thirty of
us put in a great deal of time,
effort and imagination. We at
tempted to redefine the over
seas experience in terms more
suited to what it is since it Is
NOT an "European Experience."
We put forth several proposals,

the bulk of the report, aimed at
cutting the academic load, while
increasing the content, variety,
excellence and relevance of the
courses.
It's all there in adequate, or
ganized prose. I would urge my
friends on the Overseas Campus
Board to attempt to make avail
able copies of the Martindale re
port. And I would urge even
more strongly that the stu-fac
committee, created as a perman
ent reviewing body, get hopping.
With all due respect to the fac
ulty and administrators in

dency in the Overseas Campus
area to try to keep the lid on
and lie low until the issue blows
over and is forgotten. And to
forget about improving a pro
gram in which 55 per cent of
the undergrad population, and
a goodly number of professors
spend six months of their aca

• El Gruppo
Editor, The Dally:
At some point in the current
controversy about foreign cam
puses, Dr. Walker was said to
feel that some changes were
needed in the process of selec
ting students for each group.
The implication was that the
selectors, whoever they are,
should try harder to put togeth
er groups that would be group
ier. I thing the word "jell" is the
current favorite.
Now it seems to me that the
basic flaw here is the notion that
groups should necessarily be
groupy at all. The administra
tive types think they should be.
And I remember when I was in
France a few years ago, we
students used to hear dark
mumblings that we were a
"bad" group.
It is true that the group ten
ded to split into cliques, though
I don't like to use that word. It's
also true that some students
spent all their free time playing
bridge instead of going out on
the town or skipping off to
Paris.
Let us put aside for the mo
ment considerations of how this
administrative brooding affected
the group's morale. (Did some
body mention morale?) The
question is, why did this make
us a BAD group?
The answer is, we were a bad
group because the administra
tors and professors called us a
a bad group. I maintain, how
ever, being a bad group in the
sense of not having jelled is not
necessarily a bad thing.
Dr. Walker, I am sure, has
some grasp of the idea of the
European Experience. But he
forgets that its an intensely per
sonal experience and that the
group, as a big happy bowl of
Jell-o, is irrelevant.
Furthermore, I suspect that
his idea of a good group is one
that gets along with the foreign
campus administration and
doesn't complain about holes in
the wall lousy courses and bad
weather.
I suggest that Dr. Walker for
get about group solidarity and
leave the selection process alone.
If a group has more than its
share of loners, or cliques, we
should not worry our little
heads about it. And if the stu
dents complain about some
thing, let Dr. Walker set his
busy administrative mind to
ironing the problem out before

• Rampant Haight
Editor, The DaUy:
I would like to comment on
Tim Haight's column in last
Friday's Daily. It seems to me
that Mr. Haight is generally
pretty squared away in his
views, and some of the profes
sional ragers with which our
fair campus abounds could fol
low his example of taste and re

straint to good advantage for
themselves and the campus in
general.
In this particular Haight con
tribution, I especially agree with
the idea that something must be
done about the science require
ment. The general studies-type
science courses here (with a
rare, sparkling exception) are
miserably taught, shabbily or
ganized, and unsupportably bor
ing.
The idea of requiring a stu
dent who upon graduation will
probably try to pass himself off
as having had a well-rounded
education to become acquainted
with some science is not a bad
one, and is probably even essen
tial in our modern age. But the
General Studies Committee, or
whatever the lodge that runs
that business calls itself, should
realize the fact that requiring
an ungodly number of boring,
incompetently taught units
(mainly at 8 a.m. in the morn
ing yet) will only serve to turn
off us poor music and b.s. ma
jors to the entire subject. I took
one quarter of Physical Sci
ences, complete with marathon
lab, and have never been so con
fused in all my life. The profes
sor (whose name I forget)
seemed to have a general idea
of what was going on, but the
lab TA was one of the most dis
organized, persons I have ever
met.
In short, my suggestion is
that the science requirement be
kept, perhaps with a reduced
number of units required, but
that courses be reoriented to
ward the non-scientific person.
Perhaps a study of the history
of scientific development, with
emphasis on its relation to his
tory in general, might be
worked out. This should be
taught by some professor who
can tell his bifocals from a mar
tini glass, and probably should
not have a lab. If done right,
the course would give us non
atomic types an idea of what the
hell science has been doing all
this time, and should manage to
get other people keyed enough
to look into science as a field
in which to spend their lives.

• Unsophisticated
Editor, The Dally:
John McClusky's attack on
"Black Day" in Monday's Daily
was certainly in order. I speak
as an organizer of that day.
First, however, let it be noted
that it was The Daily that
changed SDS's "Black Power
Day" to "Black Day". And sec
ondly, that the absurd front
page statement in The Daily en
titled "Be Colored" was not from
an SDS pen. Granted, SDS did
sponsor the afternoon skin
painting affair, but now we
know it was a mistake. It was
both politically unsophisticated
and morally wrong.
On a TV interview in answer
to one question I said that the
skin painting bit was solely for
the purpose of raising money
for SNCC and in line with the
Artist Liberation Front's demon
strations in support of the black
people of Hunters Point in their
struggle with the City Fathers.
But in fact this answer only
clouds the question.

The skin painting and carni
val-like afternoon of the Black
Power Day was wrong political
ly because it covered up the seri
ousness of the Black Power line
in terms of solid work both for
blacks and the white activists
who support Black Power. The
skin painting affair fits into the
liberal's bag about skin color
being meaningless and to
achieve integration skin color
must be made irrelevant by the
white culture completely swal
lowing up the black. This line
covers over the Black Power cry
that white society must recog
nize black culture as black and
that self-determination for
blacks must be in terms of
blacks instead of the sugary lib
eral line that there is no real
black culture but we all must
work together in terms of that
white culture.
As whites we can surely play
around with colors (painting
skin and all) as much as we
want but we can't play games
with somebody elses skin when
the color is a definative term in
that culture called black.
The evening conference on the
other hand didn't present these
faults of the afternoon. For ex
a m pi e when Mark Comfort
spoke the audience was made
aware of their color and knew
they were listening to a black
man who not only told it like it
is but said what we as whites
must now begin doing in our
own community both in terms
of organizing other whites who
have the same enemies as blacks
and in terms of understanding
whose culture is crushing
whose. ALAN SCHMIDT, SDS
• Surprise!
Editor, The Daily:
In the aftermath of the wave
of fraternity comment in The
Daily, I had a chance to pene
trate the inner court of one of
them recently. Theta Chi in
vited me to a barbecue.
The event was distinguished in
my mind not so much by the
pleasant company, food, and
drink as by the fact that the
fraternity was less insular, and
more open, friendly, and willing
to discuss their role on cam
pus than I had believed possi
ble in the light of my non-fra
ternity background stereotype of
a fraternity.
I left the house with the feel
ing that if we as human beings
are to find our way to a brother
hood of man, then perhaps the
first step is to band together
in groups, however small, and
actively participate in the build
ing of such a brotherhood.

• Oop'Art
Editor, The DaUy:
Regarding the article on the
Stanford Student Art Show
(Friday, Oct. 28), once again
the Daily showed its inability to
be journalistically accurate. The
Daily has presented half-truths
and implications that are totally
unfounded.
By publishing the photograph
of a painting with the article,
the Dally inaccurately linked the
two. After talking with Mr. Lir
ange about his critical review
of the art show, it was found
that he had never seen the paint
ing pictured with the headline
"Atrocity claims art show cri
tic." Furthermore, according to

Mr. Lirange, the most pertinent
part of his article was deleted as
a result of the editing liberties
taken by the Daily. Should we
interpret the Daily's actions as
an attempt to sensationalize, or
should we consider its actions as
an attempt to distort the facts
in favor of its own interpreta
tion?
Mr. Lirange's comments are
indeed valid, but, in fact, his
article was not meant to focus
on any particular work as im
plied by the singling-out of one
painting which was not even
exhibited when the a ut ho r
visited the show. Mr. Lirange
however should share some of
this responsibility since h e
based his article on a cursory
examination of the exhibition
before it was totally set-up.

• A Missed Point
Editor, The Daily:
I believe Miss Anderson did
not remain in Cubberley Audi
torium to hear all of the ques
tion-answer period following the
presentation by Georgia's Con
gresman Charles Weltner last
Wednesday evening. She omitted
in her Daily coverage the fol
lowing day an emphatic point
brought out by Mr. Weltner: In
his opinion, no matter how many
4 1/2-hour Teach-ins on "The Va
rieties of Black Power" are held,
the definition of "Black Power"
as intended by Mr. Carmichael is
contained only in one word —
VlOLENCE—period.
Mr. Weltner also was con
vinced that Mr. Carmichael has
become a prime recruiter for the
Ku Klux Klan: we have orga
nized "Black Power"—so why
not have organized "White Pow
er." it was also brought out
by Mr. Weltner that the Negro
riots in Atlanta, during the week
preceding the balloting, were a
great factor in the last-minute
switching of voters to the sup
port of segregationist Lester
Maddox.
I am from the South myself
and definitely support the ef
forts of men such as Congress
man Weltner in civil rights. I
do believe he would appreciate
the assistance of the Negroes,
members of SNCC, SDS, etc.
You might direct considerably
more effort towards persuading
the Negro that "Black Power"
civil disobedience is sending you
nowhere but backwards. I know
it is not really the "in" thing to
do, but you might also try the
old fashioned tactic—try acting
like American citizens. It may
work wonders

• Delayed Comment
Editor, The Daily:
Although a sabbatical absence
from the campus is delaying a
reaction to the October 21 issue
of The Daily, I would like to
express my shock and disgust
with the two fraternity actions
reported there, the mistreatment
of Dave Harris and the pilfering
of 10,000 copies of The Dally.
The two incidents show that
in the two fraternities concerned
an intolerant element has gained
the upper hand. I cannot laugh
these happenings off as pranks.
Rather'l think they illustrate
how in the "traditional" fratern
ity the dignity of the individual
may be subjugated to the rule
of the mob.
On the other hand I am very
encouraged to see that several
of Stanford's fraternities are
freeing themselves from "tradi
tion." Thereby they are making
small-group living a worthy ex
perience. In particular I would
like to congratulate the fratern
ity who has abolished the rush
and opened its door to all stu

dents. If it is able to limit its
membership by means of digni
fied criteria, it will make a val
uable contribution to the de
velopment of fraternities on our
campus.

• ISo Cover Story
Editor, The Daily:
Randy Bonner's blanket de
scription of Stanford fraternities
as "parastic" falls into the same
trap of fallacious argumentation
which seems to typify so many
letters to The Daily. It was
typical in its use of a highly
loaded, connotative word in an
analogy which he seemed unwill
ing to carry to any logical con
clusion.
The essence of Randy's argu
ment is that an institution must
"justify its existence by acting in
a creative capacity within its en

vironment." Thus, Stanford Uni
versity justifies its existence in ,
American society by furthering <
the aims of education. The ques- !
tion in relation to the various ;
living groups then becomes |
whether they detract from the
aims of their environment, the |
University.
Fraternities at Stanford are
simply one of several alterna
tives for living; they constitute J
an environment in which an in- t
dividual can live in close proxim- J
ity with a large group of friends 1
within a social and educational;
context. Obviously, a fraternity
can be either conducive or detri-1
mental to the aims ol' the Uni-j
versity; it is the particular mem- j
bership which makes it so. There j
is nothing inherent in any of!
these systems which guarantees |
or prevents harmony with the j
University.

STEVEN H. LEVINSON
Editor, The Dally:
I am deeply saddened and dis
tressed by the article in The
Daily regarding the re-establish
ment of the fraternity study
committee. I feel that I must
reply to the accusations made
by Jan Jacobi in that statement.
The former subcommittee dis
solved in mass confusion on
Tuesday, October 25th. At that
time the three co-chairmen (Joel
Kugelmass, Kit Anderton, and
I) met to give direction to the
subcommittee. The subcommit
tee had originally been struc
tured with an antifraternity co
chairman (Kugelmass), a pro
fraternity co-chairman (myself),
and a neutral (Anderton). This
structure was intended to pro
vide a means to study the fra
ternity system objectively. In
the course of the discussion
what had been implicitly known
all along became explicit. Ander
ton was by no stretch of the im
agination a neutral; he was
firmly in Kuglemass's camp.
They also, frankly, admitted
that they could not work ob
jectively in studying fraterni
ties. To them I was, indeed, an
obstructionist; because I would
not let them use the subcom
mittee as a propaganda vehicle
in their campaign to abolish
fraternities. I left the meeting
deeply disturbed and full well
knowing that I would be forced
to resign from the subcommit
tee.
I did not give up, however. In
a second attempt to solve the
problem, I attended a meeting
of the entire housing commis
sion the following day. Kugel
mass reported to the commis
sion the occurrences of the pre
vious night. His report ended
with the bald statement that he
could not work for fraternities;
he could only work against.
From then on there was no dia
logue. There was hardly even a
mention of objectivity. No one
was listening to me; nor did
they wish to listen. As I stated
when I left, they were no longer
discussing whether or not to
find an objective structure for
the subcommittee. They were
discussing the best possible
means in which to use the sub
committee for propaganda pur

Kugelmass and Anderton by
their actions forced me into ad
vocating the pro-fraternity posi
tion. I have since been forced
to resign—as I predicted. When
it became obvious that nothing
of a propaganda nature could
be accomplished over me, Kugel
mass took over the committee.
I was content to allow this to
happen without exposing the
situation. Since I made this de

the color is a definative term in

of organizing other whites who

Regarding the article on the

the Daily showed its inability to
be journalistically accurate. The
Daily has presented half-truths
and implications that are totally
unfounded.
By publishing the photograph
of a painting with the article,
the Dally inaccurately linked the
two. After talking with Mr. Lir
ange about his critical review
of the art show, it was found
that he had never seen the paint
ing pictured with the headline
"Atrocity claims art show cri
tic." Furthermore, according to

Mr. Lirange, the most pertinent
part of his article was deleted as
a result of the editing liberties
taken by the Daily. Should we
interpret the Daily's actions as
an attempt to sensationalize, or
should we consider its actions as
an attempt to distort the facts
in favor of its own interpreta
tion?
Mr. Lirange's comments are
indeed valid, but, in fact, his
article was not meant to focus
on any particular work as im
plied by the singling-out of one
painting which was not even

Mr. Weltner also was con

not have organized "White Pow

by Mr. Weltner that the Negro

• Delayed Comment
Editor, The Daily:
Although a sabbatical absence
from the campus is delaying a
reaction to the October 21 issue
of The Daily, I would like to
express my shock and disgust
with the two fraternity actions
reported there, the mistreatment
of Dave Harris and the pilfering
of 10,000 copies of The Dally.
The two incidents show that
in the two fraternities concerned
an intolerant element has gained
the upper hand. I cannot laugh
these happenings off as pranks.
Rather'l think they illustrate
how in the "traditional" fratern
ity the dignity of the individual
may be subjugated to the rule
of the mob.
On the other hand I am very
encouraged to see that several
of Stanford's fraternities are
freeing themselves from "tradi
tion." Thereby they are making
small-group living a worthy ex
perience. In particular I would
like to congratulate the fratern
ity who has abolished the rush
and opened its door to all stu

dents. If it is able to limit its
membership by means of digni
fied criteria, it will make a val

which seems to typify so many

The essence of Randy's argu

Fraternities at Stanford are

Editor, The Dally:
I am deeply saddened and dis
tressed by the article in The
Daily regarding the re-establish
ment of the fraternity study
committee. I feel that I must
reply to the accusations made
by Jan Jacobi in that statement.
The former subcommittee dis
solved in mass confusion on
Tuesday, October 25th. At that
time the three co-chairmen (Joel
Kugelmass, Kit Anderton, and
I) met to give direction to the
subcommittee. The subcommit
tee had originally been struc
tured with an antifraternity co
chairman (Kugelmass), a pro
fraternity co-chairman (myself),
and a neutral (Anderton). This
structure was intended to pro
vide a means to study the fra
ternity system objectively. In
the course of the discussion
what had been implicitly known
all along became explicit. Ander
ton was by no stretch of the im
agination a neutral; he was
firmly in Kuglemass's camp.
They also, frankly, admitted
that they could not work ob
jectively in studying fraterni
ties. To them I was, indeed, an
obstructionist; because I would
not let them use the subcom
mittee as a propaganda vehicle
in their campaign to abolish
fraternities. I left the meeting
deeply disturbed and full well
knowing that I would be forced
to resign from the subcommit
tee.
I did not give up, however. In
a second attempt to solve the
problem, I attended a meeting
of the entire housing commis
sion the following day. Kugel
mass reported to the commis
sion the occurrences of the pre
vious night. His report ended
with the bald statement that he
could not work for fraternities;
he could only work against.
From then on there was no dia
logue. There was hardly even a
mention of objectivity. No one
was listening to me; nor did
they wish to listen. As I stated
when I left, they were no longer
discussing whether or not to
find an objective structure for
the subcommittee. They were
discussing the best possible
means in which to use the sub
committee for propaganda pur
poses.
Kugelmass and Anderton by
their actions forced me into ad
vocating the pro-fraternity posi
tion. I have since been forced
to resign—as I predicted. When
it became obvious that nothing
of a propaganda nature could
be accomplished over me, Kugel
mass took over the committee.
I was content to allow this to
happen without exposing the
situation. Since I made this de
cision Jacobi has attacked my
intellectual integrity. He has
sought to Strengthen the new
committee's position by invec
tive and diatribe aimed at me;
This, then, is my reply.

• Fre Had It
Editor, The Daily:
I've had it! Absolutely had it!
I do not wish to see Dr. Walker
crucified, nor the Overseas Cam
pus program. Nor do I wish to
see Miss Ackerley drawn and
quartered for her Austria series.
On the contrary, I thank her for
it. No matter how well or badly
researched and written her ar
ticles have been, they have
served the purpose of stimulat
ing some much needed critical
discussion. I say "some" critical
discussion. These articles have
also stimulated a great many
people to add to the volume of
remarks which pass the buck
and blame everybody else from
Dr. Walker to Campus Alumni
to the European maids for the
problems their groups encoun
tered overseas.
I cannot really believe that
Stanford students, for example,
are so dim-witted that they will
take the term "European Ex
perience" literally. One cannot
really expect to cross the face
of Western Europe in three
well-planned three day week
ends. The Martindale Report, if
anybody had taken the trouble
to read it last Spring, would
have demonstrated to all you
complaining souls that a group
of students had sat down and
seriously considered the prob
lem of travel, and more particu
larly the problems of academic
excellence. Fifteen to thirty of
us put in a great deal of time,
effort and imagination. We at
tempted to redefine the over
seas experience in terms more
suited to what it is since it Is
NOT an "European Experience."
We put forth several proposals,

the bulk of the report, aimed at
cutting the academic load, while
increasing the content, variety,
excellence and relevance of the
courses.
It's all there in adequate, or
ganized prose. I would urge my
friends on the Overseas Campus
Board to attempt to make avail
able copies of the Martindale re
port. And I would urge even
more strongly that the stu-fac
committee, created as a perman
ent reviewing body, get hopping.
With all due respect to the fac
ulty and administrators in
volved, there is a definite ten
dency in the Overseas Campus
area to try to keep the lid on
and lie low until the issue blows
over and is forgotten. And to
forget about improving a pro
gram in which 55 per cent of
the undergrad population, and
a goodly number of professors
spend six months of their aca
demic time and approximately
$800-$lOOO of extra spending
money, would be intolerable.

• El Gruppo
Editor, The Dally:
At some point in the current
controversy about foreign cam
puses, Dr. Walker was said to
feel that some changes were
needed in the process of selec
ting students for each group.
The implication was that the
selectors, whoever they are,
should try harder to put togeth
er groups that would be group
ier. I thing the word "jell" is the
current favorite.
Now it seems to me that the
basic flaw here is the notion that
groups should necessarily be
groupy at all. The administra
tive types think they should be.
And I remember when I was in
France a few years ago, we
students used to hear dark
mumblings that we were a
"bad" group.
It is true that the group ten
ded to split into cliques, though
I don't like to use that word. It's
also true that some students
spent all their free time playing
bridge instead of going out on
the town or skipping off to
Paris.
Let us put aside for the mo
ment considerations of how this
administrative brooding affected
the group's morale. (Did some
body mention morale?) The
question is, why did this make
us a BAD group?
The answer is, we were a bad
group because the administra
tors and professors called us a
a bad group. I maintain, how
ever, being a bad group in the
sense of not having jelled is not
necessarily a bad thing.
Dr. Walker, I am sure, has
some grasp of the idea of the
European Experience. But he
forgets that its an intensely per
sonal experience and that the
group, as a big happy bowl of
Jell-o, is irrelevant.
Furthermore, I suspect that
his idea of a good group is one
that gets along with the foreign
campus administration and
doesn't complain about holes in
the wall lousy courses and bad
weather.
I suggest that Dr. Walker for
get about group solidarity and
leave the selection process alone.
If a group has more than its
share of loners, or cliques, we
should not worry our little
heads about it. And if the stu
dents complain about some
thing, let Dr. Walker set his
busy administrative mind to
ironing the problem out before
the students revolt.
CHRISTOPHER HARGROVE
• Rampant Haight
Editor, The DaUy:
I would like to comment on
Tim Haight's column in last
Friday's Daily. It seems to me
that Mr. Haight is generally
pretty squared away in his
views, and some of the profes
sional ragers with which our
fair campus abounds could fol
low his example of taste and re

straint to good advantage for
themselves and the campus in
general.
In this particular Haight con
tribution, I especially agree with
the idea that something must be
done about the science require
ment. The general studies-type
science courses here (with a
rare, sparkling exception) are
miserably taught, shabbily or
ganized, and unsupportably bor
ing.
The idea of requiring a stu
dent who upon graduation will
probably try to pass himself off
as having had a well-rounded
education to become acquainted
with some science is not a bad
one, and is probably even essen
tial in our modern age. But the
General Studies Committee, or
whatever the lodge that runs
that business calls itself, should
realize the fact that requiring
an ungodly number of boring,
incompetently taught units
(mainly at 8 a.m. in the morn
ing yet) will only serve to turn
off us poor music and b.s. ma
jors to the entire subject. I took
one quarter of Physical Sci
ences, complete with marathon
lab, and have never been so con
fused in all my life. The profes
sor (whose name I forget)
seemed to have a general idea
of what was going on, but the
lab TA was one of the most dis
organized, persons I have ever
met.
In short, my suggestion is
that the science requirement be
kept, perhaps with a reduced
number of units required, but
that courses be reoriented to
ward the non-scientific person.
Perhaps a study of the history
of scientific development, with
emphasis on its relation to his
tory in general, might be
worked out. This should be
taught by some professor who
can tell his bifocals from a mar
tini glass, and probably should
not have a lab. If done right,
the course would give us non
atomic types an idea of what the
hell science has been doing all
this time, and should manage to
get other people keyed enough
to look into science as a field
in which to spend their lives.

• Unsophisticated
Editor, The Dally:
John McClusky's attack on
"Black Day" in Monday's Daily
was certainly in order. I speak
as an organizer of that day.
First, however, let it be noted
that it was The Daily that
changed SDS's "Black Power
Day" to "Black Day". And sec
ondly, that the absurd front
page statement in The Daily en
titled "Be Colored" was not from
an SDS pen. Granted, SDS did
sponsor the afternoon skin
painting affair, but now we
know it was a mistake. It was
both politically unsophisticated
and morally wrong.
On a TV interview in answer
to one question I said that the
skin painting bit was solely for
the purpose of raising money
for SNCC and in line with the
Artist Liberation Front's demon
strations in support of the black
people of Hunters Point in their
struggle with the City Fathers.
But in fact this answer only
clouds the question.

The skin painting and carni
val-like afternoon of the Black
Power Day was wrong political
ly because it covered up the seri
ousness of the Black Power line
in terms of solid work both for
blacks and the white activists
who support Black Power. The
skin painting affair fits into the
liberal's bag about skin color
being meaningless and to
achieve integration skin color
must be made irrelevant by the
white culture completely swal
lowing up the black. This line
covers over the Black Power cry
that white society must recog
nize black culture as black and
that self-determination for
blacks must be in terms of
blacks instead of the sugary lib
eral line that there is no real
black culture but we all must
work together in terms of that
white culture.
As whites we can surely play
around with colors (painting
skin and all) as much as we
want but we can't play games
with somebody elses skin when
the color is a definative term in
that culture called black.
The evening conference on the

Editor, The Daily:
I've had it! Absolutely had it!
I do not wish to see Dr. Walker
crucified, nor the Overseas Cam
pus program. Nor do I wish to
see Miss Ackerley drawn and
quartered for her Austria series.
On the contrary, I thank her for
it. No matter how well or badly
researched and written her ar
ticles have been, they have
served the purpose of stimulat
ing some much needed critical
discussion. I say "some" critical
discussion. These articles have
also stimulated a great many
people to add to the volume of
remarks which pass the buck
and blame everybody else from
Dr. Walker to Campus Alumni
to the European maids for the
problems their groups encoun
tered overseas.
I cannot really believe that
Stanford students, for example,
are so dim-witted that they will
take the term "European Ex
perience" literally. One cannot
really expect to cross the face
of Western Europe in three
well-planned three day week
ends. The Martindale Report, if
anybody had taken the trouble
to read it last Spring, would
have demonstrated to all you
complaining souls that a group
of students had sat down and
seriously considered the prob
lem of travel, and more particu
larly the problems of academic
excellence. Fifteen to thirty of
us put in a great deal of time,
effort and imagination. We at
tempted to redefine the over
seas experience in terms more
suited to what it is since it Is
NOT an "European Experience."
We put forth several proposals,

the bulk of the report, aimed at
cutting the academic load, while
increasing the content, variety,
excellence and relevance of the
courses.
It's all there in adequate, or
ganized prose. I would urge my
friends on the Overseas Campus
Board to attempt to make avail
able copies of the Martindale re
port. And I would urge even
more strongly that the stu-fac
committee, created as a perman
ent reviewing body, get hopping.
With all due respect to the fac
ulty and administrators in
volved, there is a definite ten
dency in the Overseas Campus
area to try to keep the lid on
and lie low until the issue blows
over and is forgotten. And to
forget about improving a pro
gram in which 55 per cent of
the undergrad population, and
a goodly number of professors
spend six months of their aca

$800-$lOOO of extra spending

• El Gruppo
Editor, The Dally:
At some point in the current
controversy about foreign cam
puses, Dr. Walker was said to
feel that some changes were
needed in the process of selec
ting students for each group.
The implication was that the
selectors, whoever they are,
should try harder to put togeth
er groups that would be group
ier. I thing the word "jell" is the
current favorite.
Now it seems to me that the
basic flaw here is the notion that
groups should necessarily be
groupy at all. The administra
tive types think they should be.
And I remember when I was in
France a few years ago, we
students used to hear dark
mumblings that we were a
"bad" group.
It is true that the group ten
ded to split into cliques, though
I don't like to use that word. It's
also true that some students
spent all their free time playing
bridge instead of going out on
the town or skipping off to
Paris.
Let us put aside for the mo
ment considerations of how this
administrative brooding affected
the group's morale. (Did some
body mention morale?) The
question is, why did this make
us a BAD group?
The answer is, we were a bad
group because the administra
tors and professors called us a
a bad group. I maintain, how
ever, being a bad group in the
sense of not having jelled is not
necessarily a bad thing.
Dr. Walker, I am sure, has
some grasp of the idea of the
European Experience. But he
forgets that its an intensely per
sonal experience and that the
group, as a big happy bowl of
Jell-o, is irrelevant.
Furthermore, I suspect that
his idea of a good group is one
that gets along with the foreign
campus administration and
doesn't complain about holes in
the wall lousy courses and bad
weather.
I suggest that Dr. Walker for
get about group solidarity and
leave the selection process alone.
If a group has more than its
share of loners, or cliques, we
should not worry our little
heads about it. And if the stu
dents complain about some
thing, let Dr. Walker set his
busy administrative mind to
ironing the problem out before
the students revolt.

• Rampant Haight
Editor, The DaUy:
I would like to comment on
Tim Haight's column in last
Friday's Daily. It seems to me
that Mr. Haight is generally
pretty squared away in his
views, and some of the profes
sional ragers with which our
fair campus abounds could fol
low his example of taste and re

straint to good advantage for
themselves and the campus in
general.
In this particular Haight con
tribution, I especially agree with
the idea that something must be
done about the science require
ment. The general studies-type
science courses here (with a
rare, sparkling exception) are
miserably taught, shabbily or
ganized, and unsupportably bor
ing.
The idea of requiring a stu
dent who upon graduation will
probably try to pass himself off
as having had a well-rounded
education to become acquainted
with some science is not a bad
one, and is probably even essen
tial in our modern age. But the
General Studies Committee, or
whatever the lodge that runs
that business calls itself, should
realize the fact that requiring
an ungodly number of boring,
incompetently taught units
(mainly at 8 a.m. in the morn
ing yet) will only serve to turn
off us poor music and b.s. ma
jors to the entire subject. I took
one quarter of Physical Sci
ences, complete with marathon
lab, and have never been so con
fused in all my life. The profes
sor (whose name I forget)
seemed to have a general idea
of what was going on, but the
lab TA was one of the most dis
organized, persons I have ever
met.
In short, my suggestion is
that the science requirement be
kept, perhaps with a reduced
number of units required, but
that courses be reoriented to
ward the non-scientific person.
Perhaps a study of the history
of scientific development, with
emphasis on its relation to his
tory in general, might be
worked out. This should be
taught by some professor who
can tell his bifocals from a mar
tini glass, and probably should
not have a lab. If done right,
the course would give us non
atomic types an idea of what the
hell science has been doing all
this time, and should manage to
get other people keyed enough
to look into science as a field
in which to spend their lives.

• Unsophisticated
Editor, The Dally:
John McClusky's attack on
"Black Day" in Monday's Daily
was certainly in order. I speak
as an organizer of that day.
First, however, let it be noted
that it was The Daily that
changed SDS's "Black Power
Day" to "Black Day". And sec
ondly, that the absurd front
page statement in The Daily en
titled "Be Colored" was not from
an SDS pen. Granted, SDS did
sponsor the afternoon skin
painting affair, but now we
know it was a mistake. It was
both politically unsophisticated
and morally wrong.
On a TV interview in answer
to one question I said that the
skin painting bit was solely for
the purpose of raising money
for SNCC and in line with the
Artist Liberation Front's demon
strations in support of the black
people of Hunters Point in their
struggle with the City Fathers.
But in fact this answer only
clouds the question.

The skin painting and carni
val-like afternoon of the Black
Power Day was wrong political
ly because it covered up the seri
ousness of the Black Power line
in terms of solid work both for
blacks and the white activists
who support Black Power. The
skin painting affair fits into the
liberal's bag about skin color
being meaningless and to
achieve integration skin color
must be made irrelevant by the
white culture completely swal
lowing up the black. This line
covers over the Black Power cry
that white society must recog
nize black culture as black and
that self-determination for
blacks must be in terms of
blacks instead of the sugary lib
eral line that there is no real
black culture but we all must
work together in terms of that
white culture.
As whites we can surely play
around with colors (painting
skin and all) as much as we
want but we can't play games
with somebody elses skin when
the color is a definative term in
that culture called black.
The evening conference on the
other hand didn't present these
faults of the afternoon. For ex
a m pi e when Mark Comfort
spoke the audience was made
aware of their color and knew
they were listening to a black
man who not only told it like it
is but said what we as whites
must now begin doing in our
own community both in terms
of organizing other whites who
have the same enemies as blacks
and in terms of understanding
whose culture is crushing

• Surprise!
Editor, The Daily:
In the aftermath of the wave
of fraternity comment in The
Daily, I had a chance to pene
trate the inner court of one of
them recently. Theta Chi in
vited me to a barbecue.
The event was distinguished in
my mind not so much by the
pleasant company, food, and
drink as by the fact that the
fraternity was less insular, and
more open, friendly, and willing
to discuss their role on cam
pus than I had believed possi
ble in the light of my non-fra
ternity background stereotype of
a fraternity.
I left the house with the feel
ing that if we as human beings
are to find our way to a brother
hood of man, then perhaps the
first step is to band together
in groups, however small, and
actively participate in the build
ing of such a brotherhood.

• Oop'Art
Editor, The DaUy:
Regarding the article on the
Stanford Student Art Show
(Friday, Oct. 28), once again
the Daily showed its inability to
be journalistically accurate. The
Daily has presented half-truths
and implications that are totally
unfounded.
By publishing the photograph
of a painting with the article,
the Dally inaccurately linked the
two. After talking with Mr. Lir
ange about his critical review
of the art show, it was found
that he had never seen the paint
ing pictured with the headline
"Atrocity claims art show cri
tic." Furthermore, according to

Mr. Lirange, the most pertinent
part of his article was deleted as
a result of the editing liberties
taken by the Daily. Should we
interpret the Daily's actions as
an attempt to sensationalize, or
should we consider its actions as
an attempt to distort the facts
in favor of its own interpreta
tion?
Mr. Lirange's comments are
indeed valid, but, in fact, his
article was not meant to focus
on any particular work as im
plied by the singling-out of one
painting which was not even
exhibited when the a ut ho r
visited the show. Mr. Lirange
however should share some of
this responsibility since h e
based his article on a cursory
examination of the exhibition
before it was totally set-up.

• A Missed Point
Editor, The Daily:
I believe Miss Anderson did
not remain in Cubberley Audi
torium to hear all of the ques
tion-answer period following the
presentation by Georgia's Con
gresman Charles Weltner last
Wednesday evening. She omitted
in her Daily coverage the fol
lowing day an emphatic point
brought out by Mr. Weltner: In
his opinion, no matter how many
4 1/2-hour Teach-ins on "The Va
rieties of Black Power" are held,
the definition of "Black Power"
as intended by Mr. Carmichael is
contained only in one word —
VlOLENCE—period.
Mr. Weltner also was con
vinced that Mr. Carmichael has
become a prime recruiter for the
Ku Klux Klan: we have orga
nized "Black Power"—so why
not have organized "White Pow
er." it was also brought out
by Mr. Weltner that the Negro
riots in Atlanta, during the week
preceding the balloting, were a
great factor in the last-minute
switching of voters to the sup
port of segregationist Lester
Maddox.
I am from the South myself
and definitely support the ef
forts of men such as Congress
man Weltner in civil rights. I
do believe he would appreciate
the assistance of the Negroes,
members of SNCC, SDS, etc.
You might direct considerably
more effort towards persuading
the Negro that "Black Power"
civil disobedience is sending you
nowhere but backwards. I know
it is not really the "in" thing to
do, but you might also try the
old fashioned tactic—try acting
like American citizens. It may
work wonders

• Delayed Comment
Editor, The Daily:
Although a sabbatical absence
from the campus is delaying a
reaction to the October 21 issue
of The Daily, I would like to
express my shock and disgust
with the two fraternity actions
reported there, the mistreatment
of Dave Harris and the pilfering
of 10,000 copies of The Dally.
The two incidents show that
in the two fraternities concerned
an intolerant element has gained
the upper hand. I cannot laugh
these happenings off as pranks.
Rather'l think they illustrate
how in the "traditional" fratern
ity the dignity of the individual
may be subjugated to the rule
of the mob.
On the other hand I am very
encouraged to see that several
of Stanford's fraternities are
freeing themselves from "tradi
tion." Thereby they are making
small-group living a worthy ex
perience. In particular I would
like to congratulate the fratern
ity who has abolished the rush
and opened its door to all stu

dents. If it is able to limit its
membership by means of digni
fied criteria, it will make a val
uable contribution to the de
velopment of fraternities on our
campus.

• ISo Cover Story
Editor, The Daily:
Randy Bonner's blanket de
scription of Stanford fraternities
as "parastic" falls into the same
trap of fallacious argumentation
which seems to typify so many
letters to The Daily. It was
typical in its use of a highly
loaded, connotative word in an
analogy which he seemed unwill
ing to carry to any logical con
clusion.
The essence of Randy's argu
ment is that an institution must
"justify its existence by acting in
a creative capacity within its en

vironment." Thus, Stanford Uni
versity justifies its existence in ,
American society by furthering <
the aims of education. The ques- !
tion in relation to the various ;
living groups then becomes |
whether they detract from the
aims of their environment, the |
University.
Fraternities at Stanford are
simply one of several alterna
tives for living; they constitute J
an environment in which an in- t
dividual can live in close proxim- J
ity with a large group of friends 1
within a social and educational;
context. Obviously, a fraternity
can be either conducive or detri-1
mental to the aims ol' the Uni-j
versity; it is the particular mem- j
bership which makes it so. There j
is nothing inherent in any of!
these systems which guarantees |
or prevents harmony with the j
University.

STEVEN H. LEVINSON
Editor, The Dally:
I am deeply saddened and dis
tressed by the article in The
Daily regarding the re-establish
ment of the fraternity study
committee. I feel that I must
reply to the accusations made
by Jan Jacobi in that statement.
The former subcommittee dis
solved in mass confusion on
Tuesday, October 25th. At that
time the three co-chairmen (Joel
Kugelmass, Kit Anderton, and
I) met to give direction to the
subcommittee. The subcommit
tee had originally been struc
tured with an antifraternity co
chairman (Kugelmass), a pro
fraternity co-chairman (myself),
and a neutral (Anderton). This
structure was intended to pro
vide a means to study the fra
ternity system objectively. In
the course of the discussion
what had been implicitly known
all along became explicit. Ander
ton was by no stretch of the im
agination a neutral; he was
firmly in Kuglemass's camp.
They also, frankly, admitted
that they could not work ob
jectively in studying fraterni
ties. To them I was, indeed, an
obstructionist; because I would
not let them use the subcom
mittee as a propaganda vehicle
in their campaign to abolish
fraternities. I left the meeting
deeply disturbed and full well
knowing that I would be forced
to resign from the subcommit
tee.
I did not give up, however. In
a second attempt to solve the
problem, I attended a meeting
of the entire housing commis
sion the following day. Kugel
mass reported to the commis
sion the occurrences of the pre
vious night. His report ended
with the bald statement that he
could not work for fraternities;
he could only work against.
From then on there was no dia
logue. There was hardly even a
mention of objectivity. No one
was listening to me; nor did
they wish to listen. As I stated
when I left, they were no longer
discussing whether or not to
find an objective structure for
the subcommittee. They were
discussing the best possible
means in which to use the sub
committee for propaganda pur
poses.
Kugelmass and Anderton by
their actions forced me into ad
vocating the pro-fraternity posi
tion. I have since been forced
to resign—as I predicted. When
it became obvious that nothing
of a propaganda nature could
be accomplished over me, Kugel
mass took over the committee.
I was content to allow this to
happen without exposing the
situation. Since I made this de
cision Jacobi has attacked my
intellectual integrity. He has
sought to Strengthen the new
committee's position by invec
tive and diatribe aimed at me;
This, then, is my reply.

Regarding the article on the

the Daily showed its inability to
be journalistically accurate. The
Daily has presented half-truths
and implications that are totally
unfounded.
By publishing the photograph
of a painting with the article,
the Dally inaccurately linked the
two. After talking with Mr. Lir
ange about his critical review
of the art show, it was found
that he had never seen the paint
ing pictured with the headline
"Atrocity claims art show cri
tic." Furthermore, according to

Mr. Lirange, the most pertinent
part of his article was deleted as
a result of the editing liberties
taken by the Daily. Should we
interpret the Daily's actions as
an attempt to sensationalize, or
should we consider its actions as
an attempt to distort the facts
in favor of its own interpreta
tion?
Mr. Lirange's comments are
indeed valid, but, in fact, his
article was not meant to focus
on any particular work as im
plied by the singling-out of one
painting which was not even

Mr. Weltner also was con

not have organized "White Pow

by Mr. Weltner that the Negro

You might direct considerably

• Delayed Comment
Editor, The Daily:
Although a sabbatical absence
from the campus is delaying a
reaction to the October 21 issue
of The Daily, I would like to
express my shock and disgust
with the two fraternity actions
reported there, the mistreatment
of Dave Harris and the pilfering
of 10,000 copies of The Dally.
The two incidents show that
in the two fraternities concerned
an intolerant element has gained
the upper hand. I cannot laugh
these happenings off as pranks.
Rather'l think they illustrate
how in the "traditional" fratern
ity the dignity of the individual
may be subjugated to the rule
of the mob.
On the other hand I am very
encouraged to see that several
of Stanford's fraternities are
freeing themselves from "tradi
tion." Thereby they are making
small-group living a worthy ex
perience. In particular I would
like to congratulate the fratern
ity who has abolished the rush
and opened its door to all stu

dents. If it is able to limit its
membership by means of digni
fied criteria, it will make a val
uable contribution to the de

Editor, The Daily:
Randy Bonner's blanket de
scription of Stanford fraternities
as "parastic" falls into the same
trap of fallacious argumentation
which seems to typify so many
letters to The Daily. It was
typical in its use of a highly
loaded, connotative word in an
analogy which he seemed unwill
ing to carry to any logical con
clusion.
The essence of Randy's argu
ment is that an institution must
"justify its existence by acting in
a creative capacity within its en

vironment." Thus, Stanford Uni
versity justifies its existence in ,
American society by furthering <
the aims of education. The ques- !
tion in relation to the various ;
living groups then becomes |
whether they detract from the
aims of their environment, the |
University.
Fraternities at Stanford are
simply one of several alterna
tives for living; they constitute J
an environment in which an in- t
dividual can live in close proxim- J
ity with a large group of friends 1
within a social and educational;
context. Obviously, a fraternity
can be either conducive or detri-1
mental to the aims ol' the Uni-j
versity; it is the particular mem- j
bership which makes it so. There j
is nothing inherent in any of!
these systems which guarantees |

RICHARD C. PRESTIEN J
STEVEN H. LEVINSON
Editor, The Dally:
I am deeply saddened and dis
tressed by the article in The
Daily regarding the re-establish
ment of the fraternity study
committee. I feel that I must
reply to the accusations made
by Jan Jacobi in that statement.
The former subcommittee dis
solved in mass confusion on
Tuesday, October 25th. At that
time the three co-chairmen (Joel
Kugelmass, Kit Anderton, and
I) met to give direction to the
subcommittee. The subcommit
tee had originally been struc
tured with an antifraternity co
chairman (Kugelmass), a pro
fraternity co-chairman (myself),
and a neutral (Anderton). This
structure was intended to pro
vide a means to study the fra
ternity system objectively. In
the course of the discussion
what had been implicitly known
all along became explicit. Ander
ton was by no stretch of the im
agination a neutral; he was
firmly in Kuglemass's camp.
They also, frankly, admitted
that they could not work ob
jectively in studying fraterni
ties. To them I was, indeed, an
obstructionist; because I would
not let them use the subcom
mittee as a propaganda vehicle
in their campaign to abolish
fraternities. I left the meeting
deeply disturbed and full well
knowing that I would be forced
to resign from the subcommit
tee.
I did not give up, however. In
a second attempt to solve the
problem, I attended a meeting
of the entire housing commis
sion the following day. Kugel
mass reported to the commis
sion the occurrences of the pre
vious night. His report ended
with the bald statement that he
could not work for fraternities;
he could only work against.
From then on there was no dia
logue. There was hardly even a
mention of objectivity. No one
was listening to me; nor did
they wish to listen. As I stated
when I left, they were no longer
discussing whether or not to
find an objective structure for
the subcommittee. They were
discussing the best possible
means in which to use the sub
committee for propaganda pur
poses.
Kugelmass and Anderton by
their actions forced me into ad
vocating the pro-fraternity posi
tion. I have since been forced
to resign—as I predicted. When
it became obvious that nothing
of a propaganda nature could
be accomplished over me, Kugel
mass took over the committee.
I was content to allow this to
happen without exposing the
situation. Since I made this de
cision Jacobi has attacked my
intellectual integrity. He has
sought to Strengthen the new
committee's position by invec
tive and diatribe aimed at me;
This, then, is my reply.
DALE L. MATSCHULLAT
• Fre Had It
Editor, The Daily:
I've had it! Absolutely had it!
I do not wish to see Dr. Walker
crucified, nor the Overseas Cam
pus program. Nor do I wish to
see Miss Ackerley drawn and
quartered for her Austria series.
On the contrary, I thank her for
it. No matter how well or badly
researched and written her ar
ticles have been, they have
served the purpose of stimulat
ing some much needed critical
discussion. I say "some" critical
discussion. These articles have
also stimulated a great many
people to add to the volume of
remarks which pass the buck
and blame everybody else from
Dr. Walker to Campus Alumni
to the European maids for the
problems their groups encoun
tered overseas.
I cannot really believe that
Stanford students, for example,
are so dim-witted that they will
take the term "European Ex
perience" literally. One cannot
really expect to cross the face
of Western Europe in three
well-planned three day week
ends. The Martindale Report, if
anybody had taken the trouble
to read it last Spring, would
have demonstrated to all you
complaining souls that a group
of students had sat down and
seriously considered the prob
lem of travel, and more particu
larly the problems of academic
excellence. Fifteen to thirty of
us put in a great deal of time,
effort and imagination. We at
tempted to redefine the over
seas experience in terms more
suited to what it is since it Is
NOT an "European Experience."
We put forth several proposals,

the bulk of the report, aimed at
cutting the academic load, while
increasing the content, variety,
excellence and relevance of the
courses.
It's all there in adequate, or
ganized prose. I would urge my
friends on the Overseas Campus
Board to attempt to make avail
able copies of the Martindale re
port. And I would urge even
more strongly that the stu-fac
committee, created as a perman
ent reviewing body, get hopping.
With all due respect to the fac
ulty and administrators in
volved, there is a definite ten
dency in the Overseas Campus
area to try to keep the lid on
and lie low until the issue blows
over and is forgotten. And to
forget about improving a pro
gram in which 55 per cent of
the undergrad population, and
a goodly number of professors
spend six months of their aca
demic time and approximately
$800-$lOOO of extra spending
money, would be intolerable.

• El Gruppo
Editor, The Dally:
At some point in the current
controversy about foreign cam
puses, Dr. Walker was said to
feel that some changes were
needed in the process of selec
ting students for each group.
The implication was that the
selectors, whoever they are,
should try harder to put togeth
er groups that would be group
ier. I thing the word "jell" is the
current favorite.
Now it seems to me that the
basic flaw here is the notion that
groups should necessarily be
groupy at all. The administra
tive types think they should be.
And I remember when I was in
France a few years ago, we
students used to hear dark
mumblings that we were a
"bad" group.
It is true that the group ten
ded to split into cliques, though
I don't like to use that word. It's
also true that some students
spent all their free time playing
bridge instead of going out on
the town or skipping off to
Paris.
Let us put aside for the mo
ment considerations of how this
administrative brooding affected
the group's morale. (Did some
body mention morale?) The
question is, why did this make
us a BAD group?
The answer is, we were a bad
group because the administra
tors and professors called us a
a bad group. I maintain, how
ever, being a bad group in the
sense of not having jelled is not
necessarily a bad thing.
Dr. Walker, I am sure, has
some grasp of the idea of the
European Experience. But he
forgets that its an intensely per
sonal experience and that the
group, as a big happy bowl of
Jell-o, is irrelevant.
Furthermore, I suspect that
his idea of a good group is one
that gets along with the foreign
campus administration and
doesn't complain about holes in
the wall lousy courses and bad
weather.
I suggest that Dr. Walker for
get about group solidarity and
leave the selection process alone.
If a group has more than its
share of loners, or cliques, we
should not worry our little
heads about it. And if the stu
dents complain about some
thing, let Dr. Walker set his
busy administrative mind to
ironing the problem out before
the students revolt.
CHRISTOPHER HARGROVE
• Rampant Haight
Editor, The DaUy:
I would like to comment on
Tim Haight's column in last
Friday's Daily. It seems to me
that Mr. Haight is generally
pretty squared away in his
views, and some of the profes
sional ragers with which our
fair campus abounds could fol
low his example of taste and re

straint to good advantage for
themselves and the campus in
general.
In this particular Haight con
tribution, I especially agree with
the idea that something must be
done about the science require
ment. The general studies-type
science courses here (with a
rare, sparkling exception) are
miserably taught, shabbily or
ganized, and unsupportably bor
ing.
The idea of requiring a stu
dent who upon graduation will
probably try to pass himself off
as having had a well-rounded
education to become acquainted
with some science is not a bad
one, and is probably even essen
tial in our modern age. But the
General Studies Committee, or
whatever the lodge that runs
that business calls itself, should
realize the fact that requiring
an ungodly number of boring,
incompetently taught units
(mainly at 8 a.m. in the morn
ing yet) will only serve to turn
off us poor music and b.s. ma
jors to the entire subject. I took
one quarter of Physical Sci
ences, complete with marathon
lab, and have never been so con
fused in all my life. The profes
sor (whose name I forget)
seemed to have a general idea
of what was going on, but the
lab TA was one of the most dis
organized, persons I have ever
met.
In short, my suggestion is
that the science requirement be
kept, perhaps with a reduced
number of units required, but
that courses be reoriented to
ward the non-scientific person.
Perhaps a study of the history
of scientific development, with
emphasis on its relation to his
tory in general, might be
worked out. This should be
taught by some professor who
can tell his bifocals from a mar
tini glass, and probably should
not have a lab. If done right,
the course would give us non
atomic types an idea of what the
hell science has been doing all
this time, and should manage to
get other people keyed enough
to look into science as a field
in which to spend their lives.

Waiting - for Godot is a play.

than words and going to th e

function. It is participation in
creation.

• Unsophisticated
Editor, The Dally:
John McClusky's attack on
"Black Day" in Monday's Daily
was certainly in order. I speak
as an organizer of that day.
First, however, let it be noted
that it was The Daily that
changed SDS's "Black Power
Day" to "Black Day". And sec
ondly, that the absurd front
page statement in The Daily en
titled "Be Colored" was not from
an SDS pen. Granted, SDS did
sponsor the afternoon skin
painting affair, but now we
know it was a mistake. It was
both politically unsophisticated
and morally wrong.
On a TV interview in answer
to one question I said that the
skin painting bit was solely for
the purpose of raising money
for SNCC and in line with the
Artist Liberation Front's demon
strations in support of the black
people of Hunters Point in their
struggle with the City Fathers.
But in fact this answer only
clouds the question.

The skin painting and carni
val-like afternoon of the Black
Power Day was wrong political
ly because it covered up the seri
ousness of the Black Power line
in terms of solid work both for
blacks and the white activists
who support Black Power. The
skin painting affair fits into the
liberal's bag about skin color
being meaningless and to
achieve integration skin color
must be made irrelevant by the
white culture completely swal
lowing up the black. This line
covers over the Black Power cry
that white society must recog
nize black culture as black and
that self-determination for
blacks must be in terms of
blacks instead of the sugary lib
eral line that there is no real
black culture but we all must
work together in terms of that
white culture.
As whites we can surely play
around with colors (painting
skin and all) as much as we
want but we can't play games
with somebody elses skin when
the color is a definative term in
that culture called black.
The evening conference on the
other hand didn't present these
faults of the afternoon. For ex
a m pi e when Mark Comfort
spoke the audience was made
aware of their color and knew
they were listening to a black
man who not only told it like it
is but said what we as whites
must now begin doing in our
own community both in terms
of organizing other whites who
have the same enemies as blacks
and in terms of understanding
whose culture is crushing
whose. ALAN SCHMIDT, SDS
