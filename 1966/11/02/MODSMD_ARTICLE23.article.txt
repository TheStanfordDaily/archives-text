# Bicycle Safety

The plain, old-fashioned, two-wheel bicycle
has long been the best way to get around the
sprawling campus. By day bike riders have
traditionally harried pedestrians on Quad, and
at one time the gates adjacent to the Library
were locked to spare the serenely ambulatory
student body.
Despite numerous crackdowns by the Stan
ford Police, many bike riders continue to ignore
traffic regulations, run arterial stops, and cycle
at night without lights. The injury of a coed,
struck by a car shortly after dinner Monday
evening, underscores the potential danger to
bike riders who persist in riding without lights.
Indications are that the Stanford Police have
begun another enforcement campaign to insure

that bikes are properly equipped, and tickets are
being issued for violations. Last weekend's re
turn to standard time and the shortening days
may have caught some students unaware of the
requirements for night cycling.
We urge bike riders to install lights on their
bikes as well as reflectors on rear bumpers. The
poor lighting on campus streets already puts
bike riders at a disadvantage.
We will gladly step a little livelier to make
way for cyclists passing through the Quad and
White Plaza. But we ask the cyclists to remem
ber that motorists' reactions on dark campus
streets are no match for the nimble-footed stu
dents. Lights and reflectors are essential to safe
nighttime riding.
