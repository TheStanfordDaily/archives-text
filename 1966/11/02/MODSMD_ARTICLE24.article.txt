## 'Form-All' Letter Solves A Problem 
### Robert E. Stone 
Nearly six weeks of the quar
ter have gone by and many stu
dents, especially freshmen, may
have discovered that they do not
have enough time to write home
as often as they would like to.
This problem may be compli
cated by letters from home that

end with a plea for "some news
about you."
In order to alleviate this prob
lem and to put students back on
good terms with their parents,
you will find below a form letter
to Mom and Dad. All that is nec
essary is to check the appropri
ate space and mail.

Dear Mom and/or Dad ,
How are you ? How is everything at home ? I am fine
I am sick I have a cold I am in the infirmary
Nothing much has happened since the last time I wrote you
A lot has happened since the last time I wrote you , Classes
are very difficult Classes are very easy I am working
like a dog I don't know what to do wiih all my free time
Midterms are this week and I am well prepared Exams
are coming up and I am really behind I am doing very well
in all of my courses I am having trouble with
(name one). I got an in my last paper 112
quiz exam
You remember my roommate ? You never met my room
mate He just got his 1-A classification She has mono
nucleiosis
The food in the dorm is terrible , excellent I have
gained , lost 10 pounds. My sponsor is a fink. He got very
upset because we pelted him with water balloons She got
very upset because we hid her pills
I am having a problem getting dates because I don't have a car.
Also a little , lot of money would be of invaluable assis
tance I haven't had any dates because I book all the time
I am still a good girl
Please try to write more often and let me know what is going
on at home and how is. It is very lonely out here
so far from you and the things that I am accustomed to. A little
more mail would be welcome. Also maybe, some care packages.
That's about all for now I have to run now Stay
well and write soon.
Love
Love and kisses
your son ,
your daughter ,
