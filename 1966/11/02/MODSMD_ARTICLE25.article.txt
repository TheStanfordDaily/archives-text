# Letters To The Editor
## 'Black As The Pit From Pole To Pole' 
### 
Editor, The Dully:
I would like to voice a pro
posal for better lighting on the
Stanford campus. Of the stu
dents who attend this institution,
half own or ride bicycles or drive
cars. I am certain that several
bicycle accidents involving pe
destrians and automobiles could
be avoided if sufficient light was
provided along the streets and
paths of Stanford at night.
Even with a light on a bike,
a student returning from an
evening class can not distinguish
shapes of people walking or rid
ing in the gloom. The contour of
the roads and paths is distorted
by the infrequent pools of bright
ness given off by the far-spaced
street lamps.
Although in some areas of the
campus, the light is concen
trated, as the two blocks of
Campus Drive that runs in front
of Florence Moore; others, such
as the bicycle path that runs
the length of Palm Drive from
the Quad to El Camino have
virtually no lamps except at the
three main intersections.
I feel that this issue is im
portant and should warrent the
attention of every person who
values his personal safety as he
ventures into the night on this
campus.

• Slanted Significance?
Editor, The Daily:
The Stanford Daily claims to
cover the seene of significant
Stanford University activity.
Why is it, then, that said "news
paper", when alerted to the
developing water-balloon crisis
at Wilbur Hall, directly involv
ing some 180 freshmen men, did
not feel inclined to cover this
riot-like situation?
We at Wilbur consider the im
portance of this Arroyo (dorks)
vs. Madera incident to be of
greater importance than the en
lightening and earth-shaking an

nouncement concerning "No
Backup in S.U. Mail" (Tuesday,
October 18, 1966), or the story
headed "Blood Analyzer Used
At Hospital" Monday, October
17, 1966). Our immediate reac
tion is that perhaps we should
trade in our blood analyzer for
something to determine the
mental qualifications of whoever
writes The Daily.
Since this incident at Wilbur
effected (sic) either directly or
indirectly approximately 400
Stanford students, it should
have been regarded with more
consideration by your energetic
staff.

• A Proposal
Editor, The Dally:
I, for one, am sick and tired
of the constant attacks on fra
ternities by non-fraternity peo
ple. If the mere existence of fra
ternities is so repugnant to these
people that they wish to deny
the choice of that form of living
from those who desire it even
though they are not forced to
join a fraternity or even to go
through rush, then they might
do well to think about the fact
that in life (out there in the non
academic community) one must
live with many things that one
may find repugnant.
These people claim that fra
ternities and the ding system
are undemocratic. Is "dinging"
the fraternity system democrat
ic?
As for the statement that fra
ternities are not a creative ele
ment in the University, I per
sonally know of many Stanford
men who, after joining a fra
ternity, acquire entirely different
personality traits than those
that they had as freshmen.
These traits may be seen as good
or bad depending on one's values,
but the changing process is cer
tainly creative.
Rush is a mutual selection by

the active members of a fratern
ity and the rushees. No one is
forced to join a fraternity. Rush
has its faults but the draw sys
tem, as far as I am concerned,
is completely without merit ex
cept possibly that it saves the
administration a lot of work.
I personally applaud the fra
ternity system as a very valu
able form of living (and also
for many other reasons). Wom
en should not only be allowed to
live off campus, but should also
regain the right to choose the
fraternal type of living arrange
ment.

• Misconception
Editor, The Daily:
As a freshman, I am just now
realizing what a misconception
I have had about students here.
When I applied here, I was un
der the impression that Stanford
students were intelligent, respon
sible, mature people. This may
be the case for a majority of
the students, but there are many,
far too many, who are dishonest,
irresponsible, and immature.
These people make a mockery
of the Fundamental Standard.
Dishonesty seems to be the
major problem. It is taken for
granted that an unlocked bicycle
is public property. It isn't. Food
In the various living groups is
for anyone who wants it. It isn't.
The furnishings of residences
are also public property. They
aren't.
People leave their bikes for a
minute to mail a letter, buy a
book, or turn in a paper, and
when they return, someone has
"borrowed" their bike. Food dis
appears from the Wilbur kitch
enettes regularly. Lamps, rugs,
couches, even TV sets are "bor
rowed" to furnish private rooms.
How can these attitudes exist at
an institution like Stanford
where tests and exams are not
even proctored?

• Study In Contrast
Editor, The Dally:
I was at the Black Fair from
12:30 until 2 on Friday. My only
good impression of it came from
Dave Harris. As for the rest, I
wrote the following at the time:
"The eager grasping way that
photographers and gaping peo
ple observe wipes out a casual
hilarity and makes it forced.
Punches, toothy smiles, loud ex
clamations of 'What's happen
ing, baby?', and then the inevit
able formation of groups of
threes and fours. Jazz in the
background is driving while
people paint people. Painted
people are neat but I'd rather
my buddy painted me, even if
he was somebody I didn't know.
And I look at the people. . .
Study in contrast. A neatly
dressed, immaculately pressed

young kid with a big, nice cam
era wanders through the paint
ers and laughs self-consciously
with and at them.
"I wonder what the idea be
hind this thing was? Fun, yeah,
but mingle? I don't see it. May
be if everybody is lucky they'll
mingle later and talk to each
other, the painters and painted,
and the 'others.' Rally tragic
it will be if this becomes a
'scene' to be seen against."

The Daily is happy to accept

They must be typewritten on
65-space lines and double spaced.
Letters should not exceed 300
words in length. Shorter letters

Editor, The Daily:
As a freshman, I am just now
realizing what a misconception
I have had about students here.
When I applied here, I was un
der the impression that Stanford
students were intelligent, respon
sible, mature people. This may
be the case for a majority of
the students, but there are many,
far too many, who are dishonest,
irresponsible, and immature.
These people make a mockery
of the Fundamental Standard.
Dishonesty seems to be the
major problem. It is taken for
granted that an unlocked bicycle
is public property. It isn't. Food
In the various living groups is
for anyone who wants it. It isn't.
The furnishings of residences
are also public property. They
aren't.
People leave their bikes for a
minute to mail a letter, buy a
book, or turn in a paper, and
when they return, someone has
"borrowed" their bike. Food dis
appears from the Wilbur kitch
enettes regularly. Lamps, rugs,
couches, even TV sets are "bor
rowed" to furnish private rooms.
How can these attitudes exist at
an institution like Stanford
where tests and exams are not
even proctored?

• Study In Contrast
Editor, The Dally:
I was at the Black Fair from
12:30 until 2 on Friday. My only
good impression of it came from
Dave Harris. As for the rest, I
wrote the following at the time:
"The eager grasping way that
photographers and gaping peo
ple observe wipes out a casual
hilarity and makes it forced.
Punches, toothy smiles, loud ex
clamations of 'What's happen
ing, baby?', and then the inevit
able formation of groups of
threes and fours. Jazz in the
background is driving while
people paint people. Painted
people are neat but I'd rather
my buddy painted me, even if
he was somebody I didn't know.
And I look at the people. . .
Study in contrast. A neatly
dressed, immaculately pressed

young kid with a big, nice cam
era wanders through the paint
ers and laughs self-consciously
with and at them.
"I wonder what the idea be
hind this thing was? Fun, yeah,
but mingle? I don't see it. May
be if everybody is lucky they'll
mingle later and talk to each
other, the painters and painted,
and the 'others.' Rally tragic
it will be if this becomes a
'scene' to be seen against."

The Call To Arms
Editor, The Dully:
I would like to voice a pro
posal for better lighting on the
Stanford campus. Of the stu
dents who attend this institution,
half own or ride bicycles or drive
cars. I am certain that several
bicycle accidents involving pe
destrians and automobiles could
be avoided if sufficient light was
provided along the streets and
paths of Stanford at night.
Even with a light on a bike,
a student returning from an
evening class can not distinguish
shapes of people walking or rid
ing in the gloom. The contour of
the roads and paths is distorted
by the infrequent pools of bright
ness given off by the far-spaced
street lamps.
Although in some areas of the
campus, the light is concen
trated, as the two blocks of
Campus Drive that runs in front
of Florence Moore; others, such
as the bicycle path that runs
the length of Palm Drive from
the Quad to El Camino have
virtually no lamps except at the
three main intersections.
I feel that this issue is im
portant and should warrent the
attention of every person who
values his personal safety as he
ventures into the night on this
campus.

• Slanted Significance?
Editor, The Daily:
The Stanford Daily claims to
cover the seene of significant
Stanford University activity.
Why is it, then, that said "news
paper", when alerted to the
developing water-balloon crisis
at Wilbur Hall, directly involv
ing some 180 freshmen men, did
not feel inclined to cover this
riot-like situation?
We at Wilbur consider the im
portance of this Arroyo (dorks)
vs. Madera incident to be of
greater importance than the en
lightening and earth-shaking an

nouncement concerning "No
Backup in S.U. Mail" (Tuesday,
October 18, 1966), or the story
headed "Blood Analyzer Used
At Hospital" Monday, October
17, 1966). Our immediate reac
tion is that perhaps we should
trade in our blood analyzer for
something to determine the
mental qualifications of whoever
writes The Daily.
Since this incident at Wilbur
effected (sic) either directly or
indirectly approximately 400
Stanford students, it should
have been regarded with more
consideration by your energetic
staff.

• A Proposal
Editor, The Dally:
I, for one, am sick and tired
of the constant attacks on fra
ternities by non-fraternity peo
ple. If the mere existence of fra
ternities is so repugnant to these
people that they wish to deny
the choice of that form of living
from those who desire it even
though they are not forced to
join a fraternity or even to go
through rush, then they might
do well to think about the fact
that in life (out there in the non
academic community) one must
live with many things that one
may find repugnant.
These people claim that fra
ternities and the ding system
are undemocratic. Is "dinging"
the fraternity system democrat
ic?
As for the statement that fra
ternities are not a creative ele
ment in the University, I per
sonally know of many Stanford
men who, after joining a fra
ternity, acquire entirely different
personality traits than those
that they had as freshmen.
These traits may be seen as good
or bad depending on one's values,
but the changing process is cer
tainly creative.
Rush is a mutual selection by

the active members of a fratern
ity and the rushees. No one is
forced to join a fraternity. Rush
has its faults but the draw sys
tem, as far as I am concerned,
is completely without merit ex
cept possibly that it saves the
administration a lot of work.
I personally applaud the fra
ternity system as a very valu
able form of living (and also
for many other reasons). Wom
en should not only be allowed to
live off campus, but should also
regain the right to choose the
fraternal type of living arrange
ment.

WE 90 AT MADERA
• A Proposal
Editor, The Dally:
I, for one, am sick and tired
of the constant attacks on fra
ternities by non-fraternity peo
ple. If the mere existence of fra
ternities is so repugnant to these
people that they wish to deny
the choice of that form of living
from those who desire it even
though they are not forced to
join a fraternity or even to go
through rush, then they might
do well to think about the fact
that in life (out there in the non
academic community) one must
live with many things that one
may find repugnant.
These people claim that fra
ternities and the ding system
are undemocratic. Is "dinging"
the fraternity system democrat
ic?
As for the statement that fra
ternities are not a creative ele
ment in the University, I per
sonally know of many Stanford
men who, after joining a fra
ternity, acquire entirely different
personality traits than those
that they had as freshmen.
These traits may be seen as good
or bad depending on one's values,
but the changing process is cer
tainly creative.
Rush is a mutual selection by

the active members of a fratern
ity and the rushees. No one is
forced to join a fraternity. Rush
has its faults but the draw sys
tem, as far as I am concerned,
is completely without merit ex
cept possibly that it saves the
administration a lot of work.
I personally applaud the fra
ternity system as a very valu
able form of living (and also
for many other reasons). Wom
en should not only be allowed to
live off campus, but should also
regain the right to choose the
fraternal type of living arrange
ment.

• Misconception
Editor, The Daily:
As a freshman, I am just now
realizing what a misconception
I have had about students here.
When I applied here, I was un
der the impression that Stanford
students were intelligent, respon
sible, mature people. This may
be the case for a majority of
the students, but there are many,
far too many, who are dishonest,
irresponsible, and immature.
These people make a mockery
of the Fundamental Standard.
Dishonesty seems to be the
major problem. It is taken for
granted that an unlocked bicycle
is public property. It isn't. Food
In the various living groups is
for anyone who wants it. It isn't.
The furnishings of residences
are also public property. They
aren't.
People leave their bikes for a
minute to mail a letter, buy a
book, or turn in a paper, and
when they return, someone has
"borrowed" their bike. Food dis
appears from the Wilbur kitch
enettes regularly. Lamps, rugs,
couches, even TV sets are "bor
rowed" to furnish private rooms.
How can these attitudes exist at
an institution like Stanford
where tests and exams are not
even proctored?

• Study In Contrast
Editor, The Dally:
I was at the Black Fair from
12:30 until 2 on Friday. My only
good impression of it came from
Dave Harris. As for the rest, I
wrote the following at the time:
"The eager grasping way that
photographers and gaping peo
ple observe wipes out a casual
hilarity and makes it forced.
Punches, toothy smiles, loud ex
clamations of 'What's happen
ing, baby?', and then the inevit
able formation of groups of
threes and fours. Jazz in the
background is driving while
people paint people. Painted
people are neat but I'd rather
my buddy painted me, even if
he was somebody I didn't know.
And I look at the people. . .
Study in contrast. A neatly
dressed, immaculately pressed

young kid with a big, nice cam
era wanders through the paint
ers and laughs self-consciously
with and at them.
"I wonder what the idea be
hind this thing was? Fun, yeah,
but mingle? I don't see it. May
be if everybody is lucky they'll
mingle later and talk to each
other, the painters and painted,
and the 'others.' Rally tragic
it will be if this becomes a
'scene' to be seen against."

The Call To Arms
Editor, The Dully:
I would like to voice a pro
posal for better lighting on the
Stanford campus. Of the stu
dents who attend this institution,
half own or ride bicycles or drive
cars. I am certain that several
bicycle accidents involving pe
destrians and automobiles could
be avoided if sufficient light was
provided along the streets and
paths of Stanford at night.
Even with a light on a bike,
a student returning from an
evening class can not distinguish
shapes of people walking or rid
ing in the gloom. The contour of
the roads and paths is distorted
by the infrequent pools of bright
ness given off by the far-spaced
street lamps.
Although in some areas of the
campus, the light is concen
trated, as the two blocks of
Campus Drive that runs in front
of Florence Moore; others, such
as the bicycle path that runs
the length of Palm Drive from
the Quad to El Camino have
virtually no lamps except at the
three main intersections.
I feel that this issue is im
portant and should warrent the
attention of every person who
values his personal safety as he
ventures into the night on this
campus.

12:30 until 2 on Friday. My only
good impression of it came from
Dave Harris. As for the rest, I
wrote the following at the time:
"The eager grasping way that
photographers and gaping peo
ple observe wipes out a casual
hilarity and makes it forced.
Punches, toothy smiles, loud ex
clamations of 'What's happen
ing, baby?', and then the inevit
able formation of groups of
threes and fours. Jazz in the
background is driving while
people paint people. Painted
people are neat but I'd rather
my buddy painted me, even if
he was somebody I didn't know.
And I look at the people. . .
Study in contrast. A neatly
dressed, immaculately pressed

young kid with a big, nice cam
era wanders through the paint
ers and laughs self-consciously
with and at them.
"I wonder what the idea be
hind this thing was? Fun, yeah,
but mingle? I don't see it. May
be if everybody is lucky they'll
mingle later and talk to each
other, the painters and painted,
and the 'others.' Rally tragic
it will be if this becomes a
'scene' to be seen against."

The Call To Arms
Editor, The Dully:
I would like to voice a pro
posal for better lighting on the
Stanford campus. Of the stu
dents who attend this institution,
half own or ride bicycles or drive
cars. I am certain that several
bicycle accidents involving pe
destrians and automobiles could
be avoided if sufficient light was
provided along the streets and
paths of Stanford at night.
Even with a light on a bike,
a student returning from an
evening class can not distinguish
shapes of people walking or rid
ing in the gloom. The contour of
the roads and paths is distorted
by the infrequent pools of bright
ness given off by the far-spaced
street lamps.
Although in some areas of the
campus, the light is concen
trated, as the two blocks of
Campus Drive that runs in front
of Florence Moore; others, such
as the bicycle path that runs
the length of Palm Drive from
the Quad to El Camino have
virtually no lamps except at the
three main intersections.
I feel that this issue is im
portant and should warrent the
attention of every person who
values his personal safety as he
ventures into the night on this
campus.

• Slanted Significance?
Editor, The Daily:
The Stanford Daily claims to
cover the seene of significant
Stanford University activity.
Why is it, then, that said "news
paper", when alerted to the
developing water-balloon crisis
at Wilbur Hall, directly involv
ing some 180 freshmen men, did
not feel inclined to cover this
riot-like situation?
We at Wilbur consider the im
portance of this Arroyo (dorks)
vs. Madera incident to be of
greater importance than the en
lightening and earth-shaking an

nouncement concerning "No
Backup in S.U. Mail" (Tuesday,
October 18, 1966), or the story
headed "Blood Analyzer Used
At Hospital" Monday, October
17, 1966). Our immediate reac
tion is that perhaps we should
trade in our blood analyzer for
something to determine the
mental qualifications of whoever
writes The Daily.
Since this incident at Wilbur
effected (sic) either directly or
indirectly approximately 400
Stanford students, it should
have been regarded with more
consideration by your energetic
staff.

• A Proposal
Editor, The Dally:
I, for one, am sick and tired
of the constant attacks on fra
ternities by non-fraternity peo
ple. If the mere existence of fra
ternities is so repugnant to these
people that they wish to deny
the choice of that form of living
from those who desire it even
though they are not forced to
join a fraternity or even to go
through rush, then they might
do well to think about the fact
that in life (out there in the non
academic community) one must
live with many things that one
may find repugnant.
These people claim that fra
ternities and the ding system
are undemocratic. Is "dinging"
the fraternity system democrat
ic?
As for the statement that fra
ternities are not a creative ele
ment in the University, I per
sonally know of many Stanford
men who, after joining a fra
ternity, acquire entirely different
personality traits than those
that they had as freshmen.
These traits may be seen as good
or bad depending on one's values,
but the changing process is cer
tainly creative.
Rush is a mutual selection by

the active members of a fratern
ity and the rushees. No one is
forced to join a fraternity. Rush
has its faults but the draw sys
tem, as far as I am concerned,
is completely without merit ex
cept possibly that it saves the
administration a lot of work.
I personally applaud the fra
ternity system as a very valu
able form of living (and also
for many other reasons). Wom
en should not only be allowed to
live off campus, but should also
regain the right to choose the
fraternal type of living arrange
ment.

• Misconception
Editor, The Daily:
As a freshman, I am just now
realizing what a misconception
I have had about students here.
When I applied here, I was un
der the impression that Stanford
students were intelligent, respon
sible, mature people. This may
be the case for a majority of
the students, but there are many,
far too many, who are dishonest,
irresponsible, and immature.
These people make a mockery
of the Fundamental Standard.
Dishonesty seems to be the
major problem. It is taken for
granted that an unlocked bicycle
is public property. It isn't. Food
In the various living groups is
for anyone who wants it. It isn't.
The furnishings of residences
are also public property. They
aren't.
People leave their bikes for a
minute to mail a letter, buy a
book, or turn in a paper, and
when they return, someone has
"borrowed" their bike. Food dis
appears from the Wilbur kitch
enettes regularly. Lamps, rugs,
couches, even TV sets are "bor
rowed" to furnish private rooms.
How can these attitudes exist at
an institution like Stanford
where tests and exams are not
even proctored?
