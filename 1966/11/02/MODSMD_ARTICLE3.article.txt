# Candidate Discredits Newspaper Coverage
## 
### 
Mark Sullivan, San Mateo County
candidate for Congress, charged yes
terday afternoon in a discussion in
the Law School Annex that local
papers consistently fail to print docu
mentation supplied by him of the
poor legislative record of his oppon
ent, incumbent Congressman J. Ar
thur Younger.
Sullivan, a Democrat who teaches
at the College of Notre Dame in Bel
mont, also said he had proof in the
form of facts from government docu
ments that the Republican Younger
has falsified facts in his campaign.
The San Francisco Chronicle, the
San Mateo Times, the Palo Alto
Times, and the Menlo Park Recorder
have printed Younger's falsifications,
according to Sullivan, and have re
fused to print Sullivan's documenta
tion. The challenger said he did not
feel that the newspapers are malev
olent in not printing his proofs; they
merely are not used to believing that
Younger would falsify.
Younger Discredited
Campaign literature for Younger
credits him with formulating the
ideas for two new cabinet depart
ments, Transportation and Urban De
velopment. Sullivan showed, however,
that the first bill embodying the idea
of a department of transportation was
introduced in Congress in 1893 and
that men other than Younger had

championed formation of the two de
partments.
Younger, according to Sullivan,
never has presented his whole voting
record to the citizens. Through re
search Sullivan has found that Young
er voted in most instances like Sena
tor Barry Goldwater.
