# Flowers To Trace Law, Citizenship In 'New' South
## 
### LARRY OLSON 
Richmond M. Flowers, Attorney
General of Alabama, will speak today
at 4 p.m. in Cubberley Auditorium on
"Citizenship and the Law In the
Emerging South."
Flowers is well known for his mod
erate position on civil rights, which
has brought him into conflict with
white supremists in the South.
After personally prosecuting the
Jonathan Daniels and Viola Liuzzo
murder trials, Flowers conducted an
intensive investigation into the activi
ties of the Ku Klux Klan against
the expressed wishes of Governor Wal
lace.

Last spring Flowers opposed Mrs.
Lurleen Wallace, the governor's wife,
in the Democratic gubernatorial pri
mary. Promising more job opportuni
ties for Negroes, he carried all of
the non-white areas of the state but
lost by a large margin in the state
as a whole.
A graduate of Auburn University,
Flowers received his LL.B. from the
University of Alabama in 1948. He
practiced law in his home town of
Dothan, Alabama before being elected
to the state senate.
After his defeat at the hands of
Mrs. Wallace, Flowers admits that his

legal and political career has ended in
Alabama. He said, "It is best to be
with your time. But if I can't—and I
can't the way things are in Alabama
today—l'd rather be ahead of my
time."
In a speech last summer in North
Carolina, Flowers explained that his
"conversion" from segregationism
was due to his conviction that he had
to do what was right. He said that as
he grew up his "understanding and
comprehension of what was right had
changed." He asks that Southerners
consider whether or not it is really
right to treat Negroes as second-class
citizens.
