# Harris In Demand On Lecture Circuit
## 
### CHRISTOPHER HARGROVE 
ASSU President David Harris is
finding himself somewhat in demand
these days as a guest speaker.
Last weekend he participated in a
teach-in on the military draft, given
at the University of Michigan. This
weekend he flies to North Carolina to
be in Duke University's annual sym
posium. This year the subject is "The
University and Society."
From Duke he'll fly up to Massachu
setts to take part in panel discussions
on education at Smith and Mt. Holy
oke Colleges. Next Wednesday he'll be
back on the Stanford campus, behind
in his work and totally exhausted.

"I don't like all this kicking around
the country," Harris admitted in his
office yesterday as he nervously
scratched his G.I. crevvcut. He does it,
he says, because he is invited to and
he doesn't like to say no.
At this summer's National Student
Association convention, Harris met
some of his fellow student body lead
ers from around the country. Among
theme were representatives of Mich
igan, Duke and Mt. Holyoke. When
they later invited him to speak on
their campuses and to pay for the trip
east, he found it hard to refuse. He
says he thinks of his appearances as
just favors for friends, not as personal
efforts to spread his ideas beyond the
El Camino Real frontier.
Will Not Encourage Trend
Harris will not say whether or not
his current busy schedule of speaking
in distant parts of the country is a
sign of things to come. At least, he
says, he will do nothing to encourage
the trend.
The audience at the Michigan teach
in, Harris claims, was already mostly
sympathetic to his opinion of the
draft, which he advocates abolishing.
Consequently they tended to direct
most of their questions toward the
other two members of the panel—
a colonel representing the Selective
Service System and Ed Schwartz, Na
tnonal Affairs Vice President of the
NSA.
Proposed System
Schwartz proposed a national ser
vice system which would offer al
ternatives to the military, such as
the Peace Corps and VISTA. The
colonel defended the present draft
system as the fairest and most effi
cent one possible. And he said the
draft was necessary to the defense of
the national interest.

Association convention, Harris met
some of his fellow student body lead
ers from around the country. Among
theme were representatives of Mich
igan, Duke and Mt. Holyoke. When
they later invited him to speak on
their campuses and to pay for the trip
east, he found it hard to refuse. He
says he thinks of his appearances as
just favors for friends, not as personal
efforts to spread his ideas beyond the
El Camino Real frontier.
Will Not Encourage Trend
Harris will not say whether or not
his current busy schedule of speaking
in distant parts of the country is a
sign of things to come. At least, he
says, he will do nothing to encourage
the trend.
The audience at the Michigan teach
in, Harris claims, was already mostly
sympathetic to his opinion of the
draft, which he advocates abolishing.
Consequently they tended to direct
most of their questions toward the
other two members of the panel—
a colonel representing the Selective
Service System and Ed Schwartz, Na
tnonal Affairs Vice President of the
NSA.
Proposed System
Schwartz proposed a national ser
vice system which would offer al
ternatives to the military, such as
the Peace Corps and VISTA. The
colonel defended the present draft
system as the fairest and most effi
cent one possible. And he said the
draft was necessary to the defense of
the national interest.
