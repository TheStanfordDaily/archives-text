# Foreign Campus Returnees Say Changes Needed
## Panhans 
### CHARLOTTE ACKERLEY (Fourth in a series) 
Mast students who attended Stan
ford schools in Europe have much
praise for the overseas campuses, but
they insist that many improvements
cati and should be made in the pro
gram.
Many point out that the overwhelm
ing popularity of the program has
discouraged innovations even in areas
where improvements are needed.
"The oversea*; campuses project in
cluded many firsts for Stanford," com
mented Pell Fender, president of
France IX. 'The system has been
lauded arid copied by schools all over
the country, and it's a fine program.
The campuses are a feather in Stan
ford's cap."
Rooking- The Boat
"But," he went on, "because every
one is so proud of them, nobody ever
criticizes them. Nobody wants to rock
the boat."
Students interviewed in the past
week invariably praised the overseas
campuses in general, but they offered
many suggestions for changes in
specific areas.
Considerable criticism was leveled
against some technical aspects of sev
eral campuses. Some students felt iso
lated from national or cultural cen
ters and suggested a change in cam
pus locations.
Others pointed out problems in aca
demic areas and urged action in
either lightening study loads or pre

paring students for the reality of
overseas study. Many suggested wide
spread changes in the orientation pro
gram, including some system whereby
students could be told more about the
particular campuses before applying.
Discontent Over Regs
There was considerable discontent
over social regulations now in effect
ovenseas and fairly open admission
that such rules are often simply ig
nored.
But by far the most widespread
criticism was that there is no means
by which students may suggest
changes in the overseas program.
"I was very impressed by the cam
pus," commented Bob Gulliver, presi
dent of Germany XV, "but the admin
istration is unfortunately tradition
oriented, and opposed to innovation."
No Conception
'The administration has absolute
discretionary power," said Alan Mc-
Allister, "and yet it has no concep
tion of what students want."
Dr. Robert Walker, Director of the
overseas program has repeatedly
stated his willingness to talk with stu
dents directly, and in a recent inter
view with The Dally, he said he had
often discussed possible improve
ments with interested students.
He pointed out that students often
think they are not being heard be
cause action is not immediately taken
on specific requests. He in turn
charged that students frequently do
not listen to administrators.

"That we grade on an A-B curve
overseas is nothing other than a
fabrication," he stated. "We empha
size in orientation that the grading
system is exactly as at Stanford, and
repeat the same fact in our overseas
campuses booklet."
One section of the booklet is headed

"The Academic Program Is Rigor
ous," and the text reads: "The entire
program overseas is kept at an aca
demic standard fully equal to that at
the home campus. ... In the usual
college custom, lights blaze late when
the end of the quarter nears."
Dr. Walker denied the allegation

that complaints are never taken into
consideration. He also pointed out
that a new Overseas Campus Com
mittee was recently appointed to eval
uate and make suggestions concern
ing the program.
The group was formed at the rec
ommendation of a student ad-hoc com

mittee which wrote an extensive
report (The Martindale Report) on
the situation of the overseas cam
puses last year.
"This group," explained Walker,
"will not be interested in militant re
appraisal of the overseas program,
but will assist me in making improve
ments in educational matters."
In the past-particularly in The Mar
tindale Report — "educational mat
ters" has been loosely interpreted to
include field trips, housing conditions
and relations with neighboring towns.
One of the professors who taught
at the Austrian campus last year—
Dr. Albert Hastorf — has recom
mended that the Overseas Campuses
Committee organize work groups
with two students from each campus
to discuss problems and make sug
gestions for improvements to the
Overseas Campuses Board.
"The OCB could then evaluate their
reports, emphasize the particular
areas of concern and present their
findings to Dr. Walker," he said.
"These problems are problems at
every campus," commented Austria I
president Warren Lyons. "There are
many things which could be modi
fied now, but we should make the big
decisions after careful study, not after
all these emotional reactions."
One girl summed up the widespread
sentiment concerning the foreign cam
puses: "Stanford abroad is just fan
tastic," she said. "But it could be so
much better."


The Grand Hotel Panhans In The Senimering Is the home of Stanford-in-Aus
tria. It was built just after World War I and has had an interesting history,
being used by the Russians as occupation headquarters after the Second
World War. Parts of the building are still In a state of ruin. The restored part
has been described by one student as "decadent elegance."
