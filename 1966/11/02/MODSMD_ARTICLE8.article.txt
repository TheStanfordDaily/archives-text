# Stanford Institute Conducts Classes For HS Teachers
## 
### DAVE CAMPISI 
American high school stu
dents living in Europe this year
will have a much more difficult
task facing them when they
study American history because
of Stanford University.
Last summer forty-seven of
of their instructors participated
in the first Institute in American
History ever offered to the Euro
pean area. It was conducted un
der a grant from the National
Defense Education Act (NDEA)
by the Stanford Institute of
American History at Alpbach,
Austria.
'This summer's Institute was
designed to improve the quality
of teaching in American history
courses by introducing the par
ticipants to recent scholarship
and interpretation in the dici
pline," according to Professor
George Knoles, Director of the
Program.
The Institute's curriculum cen
tered around a lecture course,
a seminar series, a tutorial pro
ject, and informal discussions
coupled with intensive readings
in recent works. Each partici
pant received 9 quarter units of
graduate level credit from Stan
ford for his work in the six-week
Institute.
Each of the three professors
on the instruction staff delivered
the lectures for a two week
period: Professor Clarence Ver
Steeg of Northwestern Univer
sity covered early American his
tory, Stanford Professor Don
Fehrenbacher spoke on U.S. his-

Tory in Nineteenth Century, and
Professor Knoles discussed de
velopments in this Century.
Three Groups
For the seminars, the 47 par
ticipants were broken up into
three smaller groups, which met
twice a week with the faculty
members.
In the Final Report of the In
stitute, the Director noted the
seminars were "regarded as the
most important feature of the
Institute's program; I they] em
phasized the subject matter of
American history as revealed in
recent historical literature . . .
preparation for the seminars re
quired intensive as well as ex
tensive reading by the partici
pants."
The Program also included a
tutorial project which involved
writing a critical essay on some
topic in U.S. history under the
supervision of one of the pro
fessors.
Evening Sessions
In addition to these formal
courses, the Institute also spon
sored evening discussion ses
sions in which techniques of
teaching history on the high
school level were considered.
Using NDEA funds the Insti
tute rented the Austrian College
Society's Conference Center at
Alpbach and procured housing
for the participants and the staff
in three local inns. This arrange
ment "encouraged the develop
ment of an esprit dÂ© corps
among staff and participants"

and added greatly to the overall
success of the program.
Three guest lecturers were
brought to the Institute in order
to expand the scope of the pro
gram. Professor Rixford Sny
der, Dean of Admissions at Stan
ford, spoke on the problems of
college admissions. A topic
which proved to be of interest
to most of the participants be
cause they were actively in
volved in educational counseling
in their respective schools.
Professor Richard Lyman, As
sociate Dean of Humanities and
Sciences at Stanford, discussed
recent trends i"n higher educa
tion in the United States. Doctor
William Rivers of Stanford's
Communications Department ex
plored the President's control of
the press; adding another high
light to that office's power.
Succesa
According to all available
sources the Institute was a great
success. Participant's comments
on the program reflect this clear
ly: one said, it was the "most re
warding educational experience
I have ever had." Another said,
"Even if held at the North Pole,
I would like to attend another."
So this year U.S. students
abroad will have to think twice
about bluffing their way through
an explanation of the Causes of
the American Revolutionary
War because Stanford Univer
sity has inspired their teachers
to rethink their own beliefs on
this and many other subjects in
U.S. history.
