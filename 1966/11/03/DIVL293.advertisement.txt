Does water pollution bug you? Or smog? Does it
concern you that some places in the country never
have enough teachers? Or nurses? And when you
read about the growing pains of a developing na
tion, do you wish you could do something?
You can. Thousands of General Electric people
are helping to solve the problems of a growing,
changing world.
Generating more (and cheaper) electricity with
nuclear reactors. Controlling smog in our cities
and pollution in our streams. Using electronics to
bring the teaching skills of an expert into many
classrooms at once, the trained eyes of a nurse
into many hospital rooms at once.
If you're not content with the world as it is . . .
and if you have the brains, imagination and drive
to help build a better one, we'd like to talk to you.
See the man from G.E. during his next campus
visit. Come to General Electric, where the young
men are important men.
