# SCPV Plans Protest, Peace Plea At Game
## 
### BILL EVERS 
The Stanford Committee for Peace
in Vietnam (SCPV) expects to stage a
protest this Saturday that will be tele
vised nationally in color.
The demonstration at the Air Force
game is connected with the nation-wide
mobilization November 5 through 8
for Peace in Vietnam, for Economic
Justice, and for Human Rights.
The SCPV is calling for persons
wearing mourning garmets and carry
ing banners to begin filling the south
end zone around quarter after one.
The idea of funeral attire at the foot
ball game was suggested to the SCPV
by the Concerned Citizens of Palo Alto
as an effective way of direct protest
against the war and the Air Force
in particular.
Lieutenant Wullschleger of the Stan
ford Police Department yesterday told
The Daily that there had been rumors
of possible demonstrations at the
game.
Sufficient Force
Wullschleger said no additional
county sheriffs would be hired for the
game. The normal contingent of coun
ty sheriffs and Stanford Police would
be sufficient to contain any incident,
Wullschleger commented.
However, he noted there have been
similar rumors of demonstrations each
time Stanford has had a home game
against a military team in the past
3 years. Previously there have been
no incidents.
There will be great diversity of ac
tivities scheduled by the SCPV. On Fri
day, November 4, a short film on the
war, Time of the Locust, will be
shown, free of charge, at 8 p.m. in
Cubberley. The scheduled showing of
Sons and Daughters has been can
celed.
On Saturday students will be leaflet
ing in the Palo Alto area. A group
will meet in White Plaza at 9 a.m.
and proceed to in front of Palo Alto
High School, where areas for leaflet
distribution will be assigned.
Vigil And Fast
Starting at 4 p.m. on Sunday and
continuing until the polls close on
Tuesday, there will be a vigil and
fast in White Plaza. One SCPV mem
ber stated: "It will be a display of
conviction on the part of the students
involved. For my part, I oppose the
unjust and inhumane war in Vietnam
and wish to emphasize my beliefs in
this way."

Also on Sunday Marc Sapir and Ira
Arlook will kick off an SCPV program
to provide leaflets about the three Fort
Hood soldiers who refused to go to
Vietnam to members of the armed
forces whom they encounter at the
San Francisco Airport. Sapir told The
Daily, "Leafleting and talking to sol
diers is really meaningful because
soldiers care; they know that this is
a filthy war of self-interest, a war
against the Vietnamese people them
selves."
Monday evening there will be a
"Vietnam Forum" in Cubberley.
Speakers will include Professor Bar
ton Bernstein of the History Depart
ment, Professor Charles Dreckmeier
of the Poli Sci Department, and Peter
Cameo, who is on the steering com
mittee of Berkeley's United Commit
tee Against the War.
