# Young Republicans Consider Proposals On University Life
## 
### MARIAN JOHNSTON 
The Stanford Area Young Republi
cans "must take an active role in
campus life," Y.R. President Garry
Pagon told approximately thirty
members of his club last night in
Tresidder Memorial Union.
At the meeting, the Young Republi
cans considered four resolutions
which Pagon felt would "provide con
structive improvement to the Uni
versity community." He said, "Our
constituency is the campus. Y.R.'s
have a duty to bring up isues and
involve themselves in campus affairs."
The major resolution considered
last night proposed that certain lec
ture courses be amended on an experi
mental basis. As lectures "necessarily
are repetitious and sometimes disor
ganized," the Executive Board should
examine the possibility of "written

lecture courses" in which each stu
dent would receive a copy of the lec
ture. The professor could use the
former lecture time for expanded of
fice hours or discussion periods. The
Young Republicans appointed a com
mittee to study this proposal.
Another resolution, adopted unani
mously by the Y.R.'s, proposed a
tutorial system in which selected
sophomores would meet on a one-to
one basis with a member of the fac
ulty of the department in which they
are majoring.
The Young Republicans also
adopted resolutions urging the ex
pansion of switchboard hours at Uni
versity residences and authorizing the
Executive Board to inquire into the
possibility of single game sales of
football rooters tickets.
