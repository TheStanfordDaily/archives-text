# Haverford Excludes Use Of Class Rank
## 
### 
The practice of evaluating col
lege students by their rank In
class is "academically indefensi
ble" according to officials at Hav
erford College, who announced
recently that they would no
longer maintain such lists.
In fact, says Haverford, class
rank is not only "imprecise," but
use of this criterion in Selective
Service procedures is forcing
draft-conscious collegians to
sidestep courses which might be
more educationally beneficial to
them in favor of classes where
grades are likely to be higher.
Haverford officials admit that
the emphasis placed on class
rank by the Selective Service
system brought the issue to a
head. But they quickly add that
they have long been uneasy
about an evaluation system that
"compares the incomparable"
and lets a tenth of a percentage
point place one student ahead
of another.
He cited instances where an
increasing number of students
have advised the dean that they
were not taking certain courses
because of an anticipated lower
ing effect on their class stand
ing.

"It seems clear," concluded Dr.
Borton, "that the fact that a stu
dent's numerical rank in class
will be used to determine his
draft status is interfering with
the best selection of courses."
Dr. Borton contended that a
student's choice of courses, with

in requirements for his degree,
should be based "only on the po
tential intellectual value and in
terest of the course."
In addition, Haverford aides,
pointing out that every class
must have a "lower quarter,"
said they feared the emphasis
on class rank is encouraging
some "potentially fine students"
to go to less competitive institu
tions.
The college said that its regis
trar will no longer prepare a
class rank list for future classes.
Inquiries will be answered with
a statement that the college has
abandoned numerical ranking.
Haverford transcripts sent to
other institutions will be accom
panied by a detailed explanation
of the college's grading proced
ures.
Dr. Borton said Haverford rec
ognized that a student's tran
script, containing his own record
at the college, "is his property
and that he may use his tran
script in any way he chooses."
However, the official added, "in
terpretive data which evaluates
a student's record in comparison
with other students at the col
lege is not a part of his own
record."
As to the Selective Service sys
tem, Dr. Borton suggests that
the "only numerical criterion for
student deferments" should be
the newly-instituted Selective
Service Qualification Test, which
he terms "a uniform and, to a
certain degree, objective crite
iron which can be applied na
tion-wide."

ures.
Dr. Borton said Haverford rec
ognized that a student's tran
script, containing his own record
at the college, "is his property
and that he may use his tran
script in any way he chooses."
However, the official added, "in
terpretive data which evaluates
a student's record in comparison
with other students at the col
lege is not a part of his own
record."
As to the Selective Service sys
tem, Dr. Borton suggests that
the "only numerical criterion for
student deferments" should be
the newly-instituted Selective
Service Qualification Test, which
he terms "a uniform and, to a
certain degree, objective crite
iron which can be applied na
tion-wide."
The practice of evaluating col
lege students by their rank In
class is "academically indefensi
ble" according to officials at Hav
erford College, who announced
recently that they would no
longer maintain such lists.
In fact, says Haverford, class
rank is not only "imprecise," but
use of this criterion in Selective
Service procedures is forcing
draft-conscious collegians to
sidestep courses which might be
more educationally beneficial to
them in favor of classes where
grades are likely to be higher.
Haverford officials admit that
the emphasis placed on class
rank by the Selective Service
system brought the issue to a
head. But they quickly add that
they have long been uneasy
about an evaluation system that
"compares the incomparable"
and lets a tenth of a percentage
point place one student ahead
of another.
He cited instances where an
increasing number of students
have advised the dean that they
were not taking certain courses
because of an anticipated lower
ing effect on their class stand
ing.
Interference
"It seems clear," concluded Dr.
Borton, "that the fact that a stu
dent's numerical rank in class
will be used to determine his
draft status is interfering with
the best selection of courses."
Dr. Borton contended that a
student's choice of courses, with

in requirements for his degree,
should be based "only on the po
tential intellectual value and in
terest of the course."
In addition, Haverford aides,
pointing out that every class
must have a "lower quarter,"
said they feared the emphasis
on class rank is encouraging
some "potentially fine students"
to go to less competitive institu
tions.
The college said that its regis
trar will no longer prepare a
class rank list for future classes.
Inquiries will be answered with
a statement that the college has
abandoned numerical ranking.
