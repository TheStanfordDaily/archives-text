# Counseling On Vietnam War
## 
### 
Fifteen Stanford faculty mem
bers have announced that they
will be available to students for
counsel and discussion on the
Vietnam war and military ser
vice.
Included in the faculty group
are Barton J. Bernstein, History;
Robert Macafee Brown, Human
ities; Jerome Charyn, English;
Philip Dawson, History; Charles
Drekmeier, Political Science;
Margot Drekmeier, History;
Robert Finn, Mathematics; Al
bert J. Guerard, English; John
Meyer, Sociology; Jay Neuge
boren, English; Thomas Plaut,
Institute for Study of Human
Problems; Paul Seaver, History;
Charles Stein, Statistics; Wil
fred Stone, English; and Paul
Wallin, Sociology.
According to the faculty-staff
group, many students have ques
tions concerning the nature of
U.S. involvement in Vietnam,
and the Selective Service system
itself. Because soldiers have re
fused to go to Vietnam, students
have refused to accept what they
consider to be discriminatory
deferments, and the numbers of
Conscientious Objector applica
tions has increased sharply, the
group feels that "it is important
that students have knowledge
able members of their commu
nity to whom they can turn for
discussion of these questions."
Students may call any of the
fifteen at any time to make ap
pointments for counseling.
