# Airport Allows Leaflets
## 
### 
Marc Sapir and Ira Arlook,
both former Stanford students,
escaped a confrontation with the
San Francisco airport yesterday
over the right to hand out leaf
lets.
When Sapir and Arlook tried
to give leaflets on Vietnam to
G.l.s earlier this week, they were
told by officials that no leafleting
is permitted except on airport
business.
The American Civil Liberties
Union agreed to represent Sapir
and Arlook in court if neces
sary, and they went to the air
port yesterday expecting to be
arrested. Instead, the airport
agreed to allow leafleting out
side the building by four people
at any one time.
Sapir and Arlook have been
handing out an article by Don
ald Duncan, formerly in Special
Forces in Vietnam, and an article

on the "Fort Hood Three," sol
diers recently sentenced for re
fusing to go to Vietnam.
"Either you're stupid or you're
a coward," one soldier told Sapir
But several soldiers and air
port employees have got into
conversations with Sapir and Ar
look over the war.
