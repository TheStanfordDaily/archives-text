• Ambush Kills Seven GVs
SEOUL—Striking from ambush under a full
moon, Communist North Koreans wiped out an
eight-man patrol of the U.S. 2nd Infantry
Division below the armistice line just eight
hours before President Johnson left South
Korea yesterday for Washington.
The red raiders killed six American soldiers
and a South Korean on duty with them. They
wounded the eighth man, an American, in the
gravest such incident involving U.S. service
men in this peninsular nation since the Korean
War ended in 1953.

• Communists Escape
SAIGON —Air Cavalrymen pursued yester
day a Communist battalion that apparently
slipped away into the mountains of Central
Vietnam after a day-long battle.
The air war over North Vietnam also picked
up as clearing weather allowed U.S. strike
pilots to get in 122 missions Tuesday, more
than double the average daily number over
the past several days. But the forays cost
another American plane, the 414 th reported
lost over the north.
• Viet Missiles Destroyed
SAIGON—U.S. Air Force pilots say they
completely devastated a missile site in Com
munist North Vietnam in strikes that began in
daylight Wednesday and carried into the night.
The pace of the air war on North Vietnam
increased rapidly as clouds lifted after a
period of bad weather. U.S. headquarters in
Saigon said most of the action was in the air.
852s struck at suspected troop concentrations
in South Vietnam.

• Hanoi Rejects Offers
MOSCOW —North Vietnam's restatements of
an unyielding stand on peace negotiations
seem to be directed as much toward Moscow
as Washington.
Communist sources both here and in War
saw have indicated that the Soviet Union is
moving toward trying to arrange peace.
But Hanoi is having none of it. It has re-

jected the Manila Declaration and every other
effort to find a basis for negotiations to end
the Vietnamese war.
• HIS Adopts 'A' Ban

member countries.

31,500-mile tour of seven Asian nations.

toric jaunt of his career, the President's huge
"Air Force One" jet touched down at Dulles
