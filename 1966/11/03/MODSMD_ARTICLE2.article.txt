# Leader Of Alabama's Moderation Still Plans Bid For Governorship
## 
### PAMELA LANG 
Alabama Attorney General Rich
mond M. Flowers has not given up
his bid for the governorship of his
state.
The moderate Democrat, an out
spoken opponent of the Ku Klux Klan,
said yesterday afternoon during a
press conference in Tresidder that he
hopes to be on the ballot in 1970. He
minimized the consequences of his de
feat in this year's gubernatorial pri
mary by Mrs. Lurleen Wallace.
Gov. Wallace's wife won the pri
mary, Flowers said, solely on the
strength of her husband's "promise"
that "he would continue in office."
"He screams constitutional govern
ment at every turn, and yet he'll turn
the government for Gov. Wallace
whenever he can," Flowers added.
In an analysis of the Alabama po
litical situation, the attorney general
said, "Wallace says he's an Alabama
Democrat. Any resemblance between
him and the national Democrats is
pure coincidence."
No National Democrats
One unfortunate result of the gov
ernor's stand ,he continued, is that at
present "the national Democrat has
no group now in which he can register
his vote.
"They have already started a third
party," he added, "They just stole our
machinery, our primaries."
Flowers' press conference came mid
way in a day of appearances on cam
pus by the Stanford Law Forum, in
cluding a morning seminar on "Legal
Problems in Alabama" and a late
afternoon speech on "Citizenship and
the Law in the Emerging South."
"It is stimulating to me to see the
youth of the nation interested in and
aware of what's going on in Alabama,"
Flowers told newsmen. Until his term
as attorney general ends in January
—when he plans to resume his private
law practice—he is "giving as much
time as I can" to university speaking
engagements. "I almost have an obli
gation to accept these invitations," he
said.
Opportunities For Negroes
Flowers' primary campaign, he
stated, was based on a platform prom
ising more government job opportun
ities for Negroes—"and I don't mean
behind mops."
"I was the first man to go to the
Negro and ask him for his vote," said
Flowers, who believes that all of his

state's racial trouble "could have been
avoided with proper leadership."
Alabama is "choking on this old
way of life," he said. "Equal opportun
ity and equal justice for all —that's
the answer."
Flowers, who argued against the
1965 Civil Rights Act as his state's
official representative before the Su
preme Court, said that "the white man
has failed miserably in his enforce
ment of the act."
In Alabama, he said, only 26 per cent
of the eligible Negro vote is on the
election rolls. The major effect of the
voting rights act, he declared, was to
"swell the rolls with whites who never
had voted before. They swarmed to
the polls," fearing that the Negroes
would vote themselves into power.
Have Your Cake?
The right-wing Republican claim
that the Voting Rights Act was uncon

stitutional is unrealistic, said Flow
ers, a case of "havingyour-cake-and
eating-it-too."
In his state, he noted, the traditional
second party is taking "a right pecu
liar turn." "There is no clear-cut Re
publican movement in Alabama," he
added; "the speeches sound so much
alike." He cited the case of one Re
publican congressman who is "trying
to out-Wallace Wallace."
Flowers ended his news-conference
with a description of the reaction of
Alabama's Republicans — whom he
characterized as a "resistance move
ment"—to a recent visit of Richard
Nixon to the state.
Nixon reportedly stated in a public
speech at that "he did not believe" the
Republican party was segregationist,
whereupon "some of the candidates
threw up their hands in holy horror
and threw him out."

Gov. Wallace's wife won the pri
mary, Flowers said, solely on the
strength of her husband's "promise"
that "he would continue in office."
"He screams constitutional govern
ment at every turn, and yet he'll turn
the government for Gov. Wallace
whenever he can," Flowers added.
In an analysis of the Alabama po
litical situation, the attorney general
said, "Wallace says he's an Alabama
Democrat. Any resemblance between
him and the national Democrats is
pure coincidence."
No National Democrats
One unfortunate result of the gov
ernor's stand ,he continued, is that at
present "the national Democrat has
no group now in which he can register
his vote.
"They have already started a third
party," he added, "They just stole our
machinery, our primaries."
Flowers' press conference came mid
way in a day of appearances on cam
pus by the Stanford Law Forum, in
cluding a morning seminar on "Legal
Problems in Alabama" and a late
afternoon speech on "Citizenship and
the Law in the Emerging South."
"It is stimulating to me to see the
youth of the nation interested in and
aware of what's going on in Alabama,"
Flowers told newsmen. Until his term
as attorney general ends in January
—when he plans to resume his private
law practice—he is "giving as much
time as I can" to university speaking
engagements. "I almost have an obli
gation to accept these invitations," he
said.
Opportunities For Negroes
Flowers' primary campaign, he
stated, was based on a platform prom
ising more government job opportun
ities for Negroes—"and I don't mean
behind mops."
"I was the first man to go to the
Negro and ask him for his vote," said
Flowers, who believes that all of his

state's racial trouble "could have been
avoided with proper leadership."
Alabama is "choking on this old
way of life," he said. "Equal opportun
ity and equal justice for all —that's
the answer."
Flowers, who argued against the
1965 Civil Rights Act as his state's
official representative before the Su
preme Court, said that "the white man
has failed miserably in his enforce
ment of the act."
In Alabama, he said, only 26 per cent
of the eligible Negro vote is on the
election rolls. The major effect of the
voting rights act, he declared, was to
"swell the rolls with whites who never
had voted before. They swarmed to
the polls," fearing that the Negroes
would vote themselves into power.
Have Your Cake?
The right-wing Republican claim
that the Voting Rights Act was uncon

stitutional is unrealistic, said Flow
ers, a case of "havingyour-cake-and
eating-it-too."
In his state, he noted, the traditional
second party is taking "a right pecu
liar turn." "There is no clear-cut Re
publican movement in Alabama," he
added; "the speeches sound so much
alike." He cited the case of one Re
publican congressman who is "trying
to out-Wallace Wallace."
Flowers ended his news-conference
with a description of the reaction of
Alabama's Republicans — whom he
characterized as a "resistance move
ment"—to a recent visit of Richard
Nixon to the state.
Nixon reportedly stated in a public
speech at that "he did not believe" the
Republican party was segregationist,
whereupon "some of the candidates
threw up their hands in holy horror
and threw him out."

The moderate Democrat, an out
