# Audiences Like Barth
## 
### 
"... I start with the premise
of the end of literature and try
to turn it against itself." John
Barth said this in an interview
earlier this year; and Tuesday
night at Dinkelspiel, to the de
light of his audience, he demon
strated his success. Reading with
his southern accent from each
of his novels, he charted the de
velopment of his comic heroes'
Journey through the heroic cur
riculum. The audience loved it.
The extremely loquacious per
sonae of Barth's novels infect
the audience with a "sense of
fantastic-ness," with a vitality
of language that must confound
those who would preach that
language can no longer com
municate experience or that
modern literature can be no
more than a footnote to what
has gone before. Barth's tales
are not footnotes but rather,
noisy comments on the "hang
up" and liberations that imagina
tion provides its owners.
In his first two novels, The
Floating: Opera and End of the
Road, the heroes reach the
point where they are unable to
act. Their imaginations conceive
refutations for any argument
for action and fail to provide
alternative motives, leaving
them paralyzed. As Jacob Hor
ner puts it, he "ran out of mo
tives as a car ran out of gas."
In The Sot-Weed Factor, the
hero, Ebeneezer Cooke, in 'pri
mal congenital innocence," is
caught up by Henry James' "on
tological wonder." Why does
anything exist when it is so easy
to imagine that it doesn't exist
and if it does exist, why isn't it
some other way? For Eben
Cooke, everything in the world,
whether imagined or historical,
is of equal interest. He is para
lyzed by his inability to ctdl one
thing more important than an
other. He continues to fabricate
random alternatives to reality
becoming a professional fabrica
tor ... an artist.
The hero of Giles Goat-boy,
Barth's most recent novel, acts
in a way different from that of
his avatars. Like Eben Cooke,
Giles, disapproving of specializa
tion, prefers the ultimate of
humanlikeness to the fragment
represented by the cloistered
scholar or the politician. Be
cause he wouid rather be an ex
pert at being human he enters
the heroic curriculum.
Aside from learning Oedipus'
lesson that "self knowledge is
always bad news" he learns the
final truth that "to gain this one
sacrifices that . . . fast or slow
we lose . . . change is taxed."
Unlike the other avatars whose
imaginations cause paralysis,
Giles' imagination will always
provide an illusion that allows
action, even in what may be a
futile search for truth. Even
though he can imagine all the
disillusionments possible, every
possible discouragement, all the
refutations, he can Imagine an
heroic end replete with heavents
thundering to his triumph.
