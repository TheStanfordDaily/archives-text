# May Ancient Switchboards Give Way To Centrex!
## 
### NICK ZIRPOLO STEVE GRUBER 
The fire station's horn belched
its unearthly sound twice.
The campus knew that it was
five o'clock. And so did the ten
operators working on the Uni
versity switchboard—it is the
busiest time of day for them.
The switchborad at rush hour
is near pandemonium. From all
sides operators' voices are heard
as their hands race through the
procedures they know so well.
Cords are jammed into and
yanked out of the extension
holes at a frightening speed.
Switchboard Heroines
The heroine of the switch
board's daily circus is the in
dividual operator herself. She
can do just about anything for
you except tie your your shoe
laces—and she might be able to
give you instructions for even
that.
For example:
• Trying to discover the ex
tension of your history profes
sor? She'll have it within a few
seconds.
• Stuck between floors in the
Encina elevator? Don't sit in the
corner and whine, just pick up
the phone and tell your problems
to the operator.
• Want to discover that fine
looking blonde'sphone number?
As long as you know her last
name, you're in business.
Faculty Oriented
But the University switch
board is basically oriented to
ward the faculty and staff. Few
students have access to Univer
sity extension for long-distance
and tie-line calls. Extensions are
provided for students in Croth
ers and Stern plus a few other
row houses, but they may make
calls only to other extensions or
to local numbers.
The tie-lines to San Francisco
allow faculty and staff to make
free calls to the city. The Uni
versity is charged one message
unit (about 4.3 cents) per call,
but it does not pass the cost
along to the user. Essentially,
the tie-line is a direct line to San
Francisco. To make a call on it,

all the operator needs to do is
plug a cord in and dial.
Ninth-Level Calln
All of the University exten
tions have provisions for ninth
level calls. In other words, if the
user dials nine, he will get a Bell
Telephone Company (TelCo)
dial tone which will allow him
to make a local call. But try to
dial nine, then a number in
Albuquerque, for example, and
the Stanford operator will come
on the line almost immediately.
She will ask you what number
you are dialing, then patiently
remind you to stick to local calls.
All of the dormitories have
switchboards serving them, the
largest of which is the Toyon
board.
Toyon Switchboard
Installed in 1927, the switch
board covers Crothers, Crothers
Memorial, Stern, Wilbur, and

Toyon. It originally served En
cina, when it was still a dormi
tory, and Branner.
Encina was condemned as a
dormitory in 1953 and Wilbur
Hall was hastily built to replace
it. After being converted into
administration offices in 1955,
Encina won a place on the' Uni
versity's switchboard.
Branner Hall, constructed in
1924, was a men's dorm until
1949, when the women moved in.
It remained on the Toyon switch
board until 1963, however, when
it got its own switchboard.
Roble Gripes
The Roble girls argued against
having Branner on the Toyon
board for many years. Due to
the convenience of being able to
pick up a house phone in Wil
bur and getting Branner almost
immediately, Roble gjrls were
nearly left out in the cold.

The Toyon board is manned by ■
students after 4 p.m. on week- "Z
days and all day on Saturday
and Sunday. Two women, who Z*
are University employees, an- «-
swer the calls the rest of the
day.
Larry Kameya, Toyon Chief
Operator, has worked on the
switchboard since his freshman
year. "It's not too time consum
ing," Kameya says, "But it has >,
its bad moments."
Kameya is referring to the T,
hassles that result when the
aged switchboard goes on the
blink. Some of the Toyon opera
tors claim that the board is old
enough to draw social security.
Students seldom work on the .
Roble and Branner switchboards.
These boards are fairly new and
can be handled easily by one per
son.
All of the dormitory switch
boards are constantly busy dur
ing the evening hours. Univer
sity officials have studied the sit
uation several times and have
come to the conclusion that
either the boards should be big
ger or else a new system should
be tried.
Centrex
Unless the boards are en
larged, they will be eliminated
altogether and replaced by Con
trex. In this system, each dorm
room would have a telephone.
The user would dial an arbitrary
three digit number, then the four
numbers of each individual ex-"
tension. Each extension would
act as a regular telephone, i.e.,
there Would be no restriction on
only local calls. Students, how
ever, would not be allowed to
make long distance calls.
Seraphim Post, University As
sistant Business Manager, has
been stpdying Centrex for sev
eral years with Oley Killings
worth, University Supervisor of
Communications. In fact, this
summer, cables were laid to four
bourses in Stern and Crothers. «■.
The cables had been installed
in the other four houses of »«w
Stern, Wilbur, and Crothers Me- 112 |
morial when they were built. But
the final go-ahead for Centrex
from the higher echelons of the*
University has not been given
yet.
After expanding to ten opera
tors a few years ago, the Uni
versity switchboard can expand .
no more. A study completed on'
April 25, 1958, showed that the
maximum number of students
would never go above 7,500. Al
ready the student body has in
creased to 11,500. But the switch
board service has not increased
with it, creating a severe prob£.
