The freshman cross country team starts out on
its way to smashing: Foothill Junior College, 15-44.
The frosh, who are undefeated, bettered the old
team record by 58.2 seconds. The harriers will try
to retain their unblendshed record tomorrow in the
Northern California Invitational Cross Country
meet. Chuck Menz, the team's leading runner, is
the third best freshman in Stanford history.
