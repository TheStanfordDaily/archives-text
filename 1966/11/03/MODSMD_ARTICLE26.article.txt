# Final Home Contest For Seniors
## Loss Of Phi Delts Tightens Frat Race 
### 
The disassembling of defend
ing champion Phi Delta Theta
and a number of major upsets
have scrambled the intramural
football picture with two weeks
of regular season play remain
ing
The Phi Delts' absence leaves
" c heta Delta Chi as a clearcut
fraternity favorite, but an up
set win by Lambda Nu over the
Delts has thrown that league
into a three-way tie for both
first and fourth, with no teams
out of the race at this point.
In the other fraternity league,
I reviously unbeaten ATO has
lost twice and dropped out of
contention, But the emergence
of the Phi Sigs as contenders
has made a three-way tie—the
nightmare of post-season play
off-makers — a real possibility,
should league-leading Phi Kap
loiter.
Theta Delt and Donner will
try to extend their winning

streaks at the expense of Kappa
Sig and Burbank in today's top
games.
Theta Delt successfully de
fended its university free throw
championship Monday night by
hitting a steady 90% to edge El
Toro. The team of O'Dell, Rid
dell and Green sank 135 of 150
shots, with each man making
45; El Toro was finally elimin
ated on its 144 th shot. The Delt

has been a standout all season for the Cards. He has made 54
tackles so far, to hold down second place in the team statistics for
this category. Mohrman, who lettered last year in his first year
of varsity play, has made good use of his speed and agility, in
bringing down opposing backs. Guillory, a stocky defensive back,
has made 41 tackles and has an interception to his credit. He re
ceived honorable mention on the 1965 All-Conference team. Ostran
der is the the only one of the four who has not seen regular action
this season, although he lettered last year. He has snared a inter
