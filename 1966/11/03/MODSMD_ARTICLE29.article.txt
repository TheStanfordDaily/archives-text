# Phi Dell Suspension
## 
### 
We view the suspension of Phi Delta Theta
fraternity as a cause for both hope and frustra
tion: hope because the Interfraternity Board
has taken a step to police its own; frustration
because there has been a sad lack of communi
cation between the IFB, the Dean's Office, and
the student body.
The Phi Delts were treated lightly. The series
of incidents goes beyond the three reported
in The Daily last week. They are only represen
tative of many more last year and this fall in
volving the fraternity.
While these incidents can be seen as the
actions of individuals and not of an entire
house, there is still a guilt of complacency and
toleration on the part of all. IFB action was
taken because of the attitude of the whole
house and not as the result of one particular
incident. They indicted the type of house at
titude that perpetrates or at least tolerates
this sort of activity.
In this there is hope, for the IFB, composed
of fraternity members and faculty, has recog
nized the nature of this attitude and taken
steps to correct it.
We believe the fraternities have the potential
of becoming the best or worst feature of Uni
versity residency. A close group working to
ward a united aim, while disciplining itself,
can accomplish tremendous things, extending
the education of its members and stimulating
the whole University' environment. But it can

also become a nightmare when engaged in
"gross" or destructive conduct.
When the fraternity turns in upon itself, con
cerns itself only with its own interests and with
entertaining the brothers, it loses all sight of
reality and proper conduct. This seems to be
the case with Phi Delta Theta.
If the fraternities, through IFC and IFB can
begin self-discipline and creative innovation,
they will bring their system out of the "closed
society" ethic which spawned them and build
a system sensitive to the educational oppor
tunities.
There is a real frustration involved in this
case too. The community has encountered too
many "buttoned lips" and "no comments." It
would be constructive for all to know the rea
sons for the suspension, but IFB and adminis
tration officials are so far not permitting even
this.
The nature of the "misconduct" is another
point. Great confusion has existed over this,
and the quotations yesterday from a Mills girl
have only slightly clarified the record. There
still remains a confusion: some deny details
of the two incidents reported, and an adminis
tration official seems to have misrepresented
the facts of the case.
We ask the IFB and the administration to
make public the stated reason for the suspension
of the Phi Delta Theta and offer an honest
presentation of the facts in the Mills case.

the student body.
The Phi Delts were treated lightly. The series
of incidents goes beyond the three reported
in The Daily last week. They are only represen
tative of many more last year and this fall in
volving the fraternity.
While these incidents can be seen as the
actions of individuals and not of an entire
house, there is still a guilt of complacency and
toleration on the part of all. IFB action was
taken because of the attitude of the whole
house and not as the result of one particular
incident. They indicted the type of house at
titude that perpetrates or at least tolerates
this sort of activity.
In this there is hope, for the IFB, composed
of fraternity members and faculty, has recog
nized the nature of this attitude and taken
steps to correct it.
We believe the fraternities have the potential
of becoming the best or worst feature of Uni
versity residency. A close group working to
ward a united aim, while disciplining itself,
can accomplish tremendous things, extending
the education of its members and stimulating
the whole University' environment. But it can

also become a nightmare when engaged in
"gross" or destructive conduct.
When the fraternity turns in upon itself, con
cerns itself only with its own interests and with
entertaining the brothers, it loses all sight of
reality and proper conduct. This seems to be
the case with Phi Delta Theta.
If the fraternities, through IFC and IFB can
begin self-discipline and creative innovation,
they will bring their system out of the "closed
society" ethic which spawned them and build
a system sensitive to the educational oppor
tunities.
There is a real frustration involved in this
case too. The community has encountered too
many "buttoned lips" and "no comments." It
would be constructive for all to know the rea
sons for the suspension, but IFB and adminis
tration officials are so far not permitting even
this.
The nature of the "misconduct" is another
point. Great confusion has existed over this,
and the quotations yesterday from a Mills girl
have only slightly clarified the record. There
still remains a confusion: some deny details
of the two incidents reported, and an adminis
tration official seems to have misrepresented
the facts of the case.
We ask the IFB and the administration to
make public the stated reason for the suspension
of the Phi Delta Theta and offer an honest
presentation of the facts in the Mills case.

We view the suspension of Phi Delta Theta
fraternity as a cause for both hope and frustra
tion: hope because the Interfraternity Board
has taken a step to police its own; frustration
because there has been a sad lack of communi
cation between the IFB, the Dean's Office, and
the student body.
