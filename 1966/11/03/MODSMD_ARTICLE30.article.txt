Editor, The Daily:
Although I tried to get this
letter in The Daily before the
Randy Weston Concert, it was
refused. I am now trying again
to have it printed because I feel
that some explanation is due
Luke Rabat's friends and the
Stanford community.
I withdrew the use of the
Luke Rabat name from support
of the Randy Weston Concert
which was held this past Sun
day, October 30, 1966, at Dinkel
spiel Auditorium.
I was promised by Dean Ros
enzweig (Chairman of SUC
CEED ) and Dr. Len Hertzenberg
(member of SUCCEED) that the
proceeds of the concert would go
to help to employ a coordinator
who is charged with the specific
task of developing program to
bring students from low income
minority groups to Stanford Uni
versity and to assure that they
receive special care and con

sideration through on-going tu
toring, scholarships, counseling,
scheduling, and social adjust
ment while students at Stan
ford University.
As I feel that they went back
on their word, I decided with
them to withdraw support from
the concert, and agreed with
them not to make a public state
ment if they corrected all adver
tisements and released an ex
planation to the newspapers. As
they did not do this, I believe
that Dean Rosenzweig and the
Dr. Hertzenberg acted in bad
faith ,and I want all friends of
Luke Rabat to know that they
can still contribute to a fitting
memorial to him by making con
tributions directly to the Luke
Rabat Memorial Fund at the
Bank of California.

Editor, The Daily:
I would like to add my senti
ments to those of John McClus
key, who spoke out in yester
day's column of Letters to the
Editor on the farcical "Black

Day" held on this perhaps one of
the most conservative campuses
in the country (despite the pres
ence of an omnipotent David
Harris).
For those of you who didn't
notice, McCluskey's letter repre
sented the indignations of a man
who had sat in on the evolution
of a titantic slur, propagated
against an already-indemnified
people. He spoke out against the
concepts of (a) a "Black Fair,"
where whites might come and
color themselves with the gayest
of waterwashable paints (never
did it matter that there might
be souls on the campus that
would feel the bite of shame and
disgrace, bred out of having had
to continually fight against the
diatribes of the most powerful
civilizations ever spawned) while
(b) tambourines were beaten
and everyone colored danced, but
strangely, no men of color
danced, and (c) the entire con
cept of a "Black Power" Day
was never cleanly enunciated by
either the Political Union or
SDA, in that it was not men
tioned that this was to be an all
black gathering or, an education

in black mentalities for the
white Stanford community-at
large.
In short, MeCluskey's letter
also gave voice to my own cries
of anger at seeing this perpe
trated not upon the Stanford
community, but my own peoples,
who were either mollycoddled
into silence or else, in their own
fashion, suddenly silent on the
matter.
If you wanted a "Blacks" Day,
you might have done well to pick
the Night of the Greater Pump
kin on which to stage a mock
revival of Jean Genet's play of
the same name. Then, you could
have had whites wear black
masks and act out scenes of
death while we blacks look on
in whites masks, nodding with
the feline grace of Prospero, the
Conqueror-Colonialist. Let Life
Magazine play this up, and with
enough press releases from the
News Bureau and adequate plug
ging in The Daily, America's
most famed conservative liberal
privately-endowed campus will
have gained true notoriety for
giving birth to racism.

Editor, The Daily:
I would like to add my senti
ments to those of John McClus
key, who spoke out in yester
day's column of Letters to the
Editor on the farcical "Black

Day" held on this perhaps one of
the most conservative campuses
in the country (despite the pres
ence of an omnipotent David
Harris).
For those of you who didn't
notice, McCluskey's letter repre
sented the indignations of a man
who had sat in on the evolution
of a titantic slur, propagated
against an already-indemnified
people. He spoke out against the
concepts of (a) a "Black Fair,"
where whites might come and
color themselves with the gayest
of waterwashable paints (never
did it matter that there might
be souls on the campus that
would feel the bite of shame and
disgrace, bred out of having had
to continually fight against the
diatribes of the most powerful
civilizations ever spawned) while
(b) tambourines were beaten
and everyone colored danced, but
strangely, no men of color
danced, and (c) the entire con
cept of a "Black Power" Day
was never cleanly enunciated by
either the Political Union or
SDA, in that it was not men
tioned that this was to be an all
black gathering or, an education

in black mentalities for the
white Stanford community-at
large.
In short, MeCluskey's letter
also gave voice to my own cries
of anger at seeing this perpe
trated not upon the Stanford
community, but my own peoples,
who were either mollycoddled
into silence or else, in their own
fashion, suddenly silent on the
matter.
If you wanted a "Blacks" Day,
you might have done well to pick
the Night of the Greater Pump
kin on which to stage a mock
revival of Jean Genet's play of
the same name. Then, you could
have had whites wear black
masks and act out scenes of
death while we blacks look on
in whites masks, nodding with
the feline grace of Prospero, the
Conqueror-Colonialist. Let Life
Magazine play this up, and with
enough press releases from the
News Bureau and adequate plug
ging in The Daily, America's
most famed conservative liberal
privately-endowed campus will
have gained true notoriety for
giving birth to racism.

against an already-indemnified
people. He spoke out against the
concepts of (a) a "Black Fair,"
where whites might come and
color themselves with the gayest
of waterwashable paints (never
did it matter that there might
be souls on the campus that
would feel the bite of shame and
disgrace, bred out of having had
to continually fight against the
diatribes of the most powerful
civilizations ever spawned) while
(b) tambourines were beaten
and everyone colored danced, but
strangely, no men of color
danced, and (c) the entire con
cept of a "Black Power" Day
was never cleanly enunciated by
either the Political Union or
SDA, in that it was not men
tioned that this was to be an all
black gathering or, an education

in black mentalities for the
white Stanford community-at
large.
In short, MeCluskey's letter
also gave voice to my own cries
of anger at seeing this perpe
trated not upon the Stanford
community, but my own peoples,
who were either mollycoddled
into silence or else, in their own
fashion, suddenly silent on the
matter.
If you wanted a "Blacks" Day,
you might have done well to pick
the Night of the Greater Pump
kin on which to stage a mock
revival of Jean Genet's play of
the same name. Then, you could
have had whites wear black
masks and act out scenes of
death while we blacks look on
in whites masks, nodding with
the feline grace of Prospero, the
Conqueror-Colonialist. Let Life
Magazine play this up, and with
enough press releases from the
News Bureau and adequate plug
ging in The Daily, America's
most famed conservative liberal
privately-endowed campus will
have gained true notoriety for
giving birth to racism.
