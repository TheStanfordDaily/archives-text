## George To Stokely: Fight, Don't Burn 
### Art Buchwald 
It was just concidence that
movie actor George Hamilton
and "black power" leader Stoke
ly Carmichael were notified on
the same day that they were up
for draft reclassification. The
reaction of the news varied as
far as the two men were con
cerned. Hamilton said if his
country needed him he would
be happy to serve, while Car
michael said he'd rather go to
Leavenworth Prison.
Wouldn't it be wonderful If
Hamilton could persuade Car
michael to go into the Army?
I can see the scene now. Ham
ilton is sitting on an Army bench
waiting for his physical and Car
michael is sitting next to him.
"Hello, my name's George
Hamilton. What's yours?"
"Burn, Baby, burn."
"Oh, you're Stokely Carmich
ael of the Student Non-Violent
Coordinating Committee. I've
seen you on television. Tell me,
have you seen any of my mov
ies?"
"Baby, I only go to movies
where they don't let me in."
"Don't you think it's wonder
ful that they finally decided to
classify us 1A?" Hamilton says.
"I've been trying to get in the

Army for the last six years, but
I'm the chief support of my
mother and my draft board in
sisted I take care of her first. I
was naturally very disappointed,
as I'd much rather be in the
Army than be a civilian and
live in a thirty-nine room house
in Hollywood."
"You may feel that way, Baby,
but I'm not going to be a black
mercenary and fight a white
man's war in Asia."
"I feel entirely different about
it," Hamilton replies. "The way
I see it, there is a moment of
truth in every man's life when
you have to decide whether
you'd rather make $100,000 a
picture with Ursula Andress or
Brigitte Bardot or fight for your
country against communism."
"Yeah, and which do you want
to do?"
"Serve my country, of course."
"You're trying to get out on a
psychiatric discharge, aren't you,
Baby?"
"You're being unfair. I'm look
ing forward to this experience. It
will not only be enlightening, b"t
I'm eagerly anticipating the
training and the discipline of the
Army as well as the comrade
ship and esprit de corps that is
so much a part of the military
service."
Real Talent
"Man, you are a good actor,
aren't you?"
"Stokely, you have no idea
how awful it feels to know
you're safe in a movie studio,
making love to Sophia Loren,
while out there our boys are giv
ing their all to repulse godless
aggression."
"I never thought about it in
those terms before," Carmichael
says.
"This may sound strange to
you, but I'd rather wade through
a rice paddy in the Mekong
Delta than dance to 3 o'clock
in the morning at the White
House."
"Wouldn't we all, Baby?
Wouldn't we all?"
"I knew you'd see it my way,
Stokely."
"I just hope I'm physically
fit," Carmichael says excitedly,
"because I'm raring to go."
Just then Cassius Clay walks
in and sits down.
Stokely sticks out his hand.
"My name's Carmichael, what's
yours?"
"Burn, Baby, burn," Clay says.
"That's the way I felt when I
came in," Carmichael replies.
"But then I got talking to my
buddy George. Hey, George,
Baby, here's another conscien
tious cat. Tell him what you told
me."
