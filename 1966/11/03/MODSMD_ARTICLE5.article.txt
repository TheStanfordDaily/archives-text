administrative difficulties. Once the
lines of communication were opened,
the election ran smoothly."
Students have voted 10 to 1 that
women should be allowed to live off
campus.
Results of polling Monday through
Wednesday revealed a vote of 2448
for and 265 against the "OFF!" pro

The "OFF!" campaign, which be
gan as a petition circulated among
undergraduate women, seeks a
change in University residence policy
to allow upperclass women to live
off-campus.
The ballot was worded "Upperclass
women should be given the option
to live on or off campus. University
policy in this matter should be re
vised immediately." The resolution
was approved at a LASSU meeting

The passage of the student referen

ing and is only a recommendation to

President Sterling. Janet Howell, lead
er of the campaign, was unavailable
last night for comment.
