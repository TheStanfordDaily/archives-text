# Fraternity Suspension 'Disappoints' Phi Delts
## News Analysis 
### CHRIS HARTE HENRY MULLER 
Phi Delta Theta President Dave Os
wald told The Daily last night his
house was very disappointed with the
recommendations of the Interfratern
ity Board because the Phi Delts had a
promising pledge class this year and
had already made significant progress
in working for improvement of the
house.
Oswald emphasized that The Daily's
version of the Mills incident published
yesterday was "not true."
Sources close to the Phi Delt house
and to the IFB have stated that the
first incident mentioned by the Mills
girl was probably true, but that the
second was either totally false or
greatly exaggerated.
Non-Member
They cite as true the fact that one
boy at the party, who was not a mem
ber of Phi Delta Theta, entered the
girls' bathroom fully clothed after not
being able to enter the men's bath
room. He is alleged to have poured
beer on the head of a girl in the
rest room.
One member of the house claims
that yesterday's statements in The
Daily were made by a girl "with an
axe to grind."

The Dally tried last night to reach
the Mills College coed who had made
yesterday's statements, but was un
able to.
Members of the Phi Delt house who
went to Mills today to check the valid
ity of the comments attributed to a

coed there in this morning's paper
talked to several other girls who also
attended the exchange who said that
the reports were "grossly exagge
rated."
Punitive
Oswald further commented that the
house felt the IFB'6 recommendati'on
was more punitive than constructive.
He said there were no hard feelings
in the house, although the members
would have preferred a more con
structive, although perhaps stricter,
form of punishment.
Another Phi Delt pointed out that
the incidents which precipitated the
IFB's action ranged over a period of
"one and a half to two years. They

involve people no longer in the
house."
Observers on both sides of the issue
have claimed today that the suspen
sion was given too hastily and with
too little public airing of the charges.
The Phi Delts feel they have been
denied the chance to defend them
selves against some of the charges
leveled in the IFB deliberations while
they were not present.
Other observers have charged that
it was irresponsible for the IFB to
make a decision based primarily on
the Mills incident when there are
other cases in which the fraternity
has been charged with misconduct
and which should have been consid
ered and decided upon before an
action as final as suspension was
taken.
And both those who think the
too severe and those who feel
it too lenient have told The Daily that
they find it inconceivable that Presi
dent Sterling could suspend a fra
ternity without giving any reasons
for the action.
President Sterling was unavailable
for comment, and his administrative
assistant, Frederick O. Glover, said
"The President's office will have noth
ing to say about this. We aren't go
ing to be doing any talking at all
about it."
Drennen Jones, IFB chairman, said
that the IFB had recommended that
the reasons for the decision not be
disclosed.
Housing Commission chairman Jan
Jacobi also announced yesterday that
his commission was investigating the
possibility of securing the house for
a two quarter experiment, perhaps in
coeducational housing.
