# LASSU To Consider Pass-Fail Frosh Year
## 
### 
The ASSU Legislature will con
vene tonight at 7:30 p.m. in Room
370. Heading the agend is a resolu
tion to institute a pass-fail system
for the freshman year. The Overseas
Campus Program and the closed ses
sions of the Board of Trustees will
also be considered.
ASSU President David Harris has
authorized the pass-fail resolution. It
calls for ungraded sections in all first
year courses "as soon as possible."
Harris believes such a program would
remove external pressures confront
ing freshmen and replace coercion
with an inner sense of responsibility.
Those favoring the traditional method
of grading feel it is a necessity under
the present system. They contend that
a means of student comparison must
exist until there are enough educa
tional facilities for all. If passed, the
proposal will be presented by the
speaker of the Legislature to the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Education,
the Committee on General Studies,
and to Pres. Wallace Sterling.
A second resolution calls for estab
lishment of a committee to "investi
gate and recommend" corrections on
the Overseas Campus Program. The
recent controversy over Austria II
forms the basis for this proposal. The
investigating committee would be ap
pointed by the Speaker of the Legis
lature.
The closed sessions meetings of the
Board of Trustees will be the final
area of scheduled discussion. At the
present time students and faculty are
not allowed to attend these meetings.
This privilege is reserved for alumni.
The resolution states that those most
directly concerned, students and mem
bers of the faculty, should have repre
sentation in these closed sessions. A

committee "to take appropriate ac
tion" is proposed.
Nominations may open tonight for
a permanent speaker of the Legisla
ture. This is not the scheduled agenda,
but will probably result from a motion
on the floor. This measure is neces
sary because the elected LASSU
speaker, Carl Schmidt, failed to re
turn to school this year. Tom Forsten
zer is acting as temporary speaker
until a final decision is made.
