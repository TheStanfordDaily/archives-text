# KZSU Plans Orchestra In Concert
## 
### 
Eugene Ormandy and the Philadel
phia Orchestra will present a major
concert at Stanford on May 28, 3967,
KZSU station manager John Semion
announced yesterday.
The concert is the result of two
years effort on the part of the station
to bring the orchestra to the Stanford
campus. The program will be jointly
sponsored by the University's Com
mittee on Public Events and KZSU.
This will be the first performance of
a full symphony orchestra to be pre
sented in Frost Ampitheatre during
a normal academic year.
"As our prime wish is to make this
event available to as many students
as possible, we have scheduled the
performance for a Sunday afternoon
and we have arranged for special
student tickets," Semion told The
Daily yesterday.
