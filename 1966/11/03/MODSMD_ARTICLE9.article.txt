# 'Tight Moneyâ€™ May Stall Grants
## 
### JAMES B. BRISCOE 
The current "tight money" situation
has thrown a kink into the implemen
tation of a new student loan program,
passed last summer by Congress, Rob
ert Huff, Stanford Student Financial
Aid Director, reports.
Bay Area bankers and university of
ficials will meet at Stanford Novem
ber 10 to discuss ways of getting the
program off the ground.
Guaranteed Rate
The new program, entitled the Guar
anteed Student Loan Program, pro
vides for loans through local banks to
students at a set interest rate of 6
per cent. If the student's family re
sources are less than $15,000/ year,
the U.S. Government will pay the
full interest while the student is in
school, and up to one-half of the in
terest from graduation until the loan
is paid off.
The 6 per cent interest rate is con*

siderably less than students can now
obtain through regular bank loans.
The Guaranteed Loan Program was
proposed last January by President
Lyndon Johnson to replace the Na
tional Defense Education Act (NDEA)
loans. However educators and bank
ers across the country protested so
strongly against dropping the NDEA
loans that both programs were even
tually passed.
NDEA loans provide up to $10,000
to students on the basis of need at
very low interest rates. A maximum
of 50 per cent of the loan may be for
given if the recepient later teaches
for a set period in a public school.
Middle Class Drive
According to Huff, the new Guar
anteed Program will particularly bene
fit students whose parental resourses
lie in the $10,000-$15,000 range. "It's
really the middle class families who
are driven to the wall by educational
cost," Huff commented.

At present, approximately one-third
of the students at Stanford depend on
loans to finance some part of their
schooling.
More than $1,300,000 was loaned
through the Office of Financal Aids
last year, Huff said.
Scholarships and grants-in-aid, how
ever, remain a primary source of fi
nancial support for students. Figures
just released for this school year show
slightly more than 1900 students cur
rently hold scholarships or grants
in-aid.
Many of these students have also
taken out loans, as the current policy
at Stanford is to offer financial sup
port through a combination of schol
arships, loans, and jobs, Huff, said.
Financial Aid
About $2,300,000 in scholarship aid
was awarded this year, more than 60
per cent coming from university
monies, either from general funds, or
gifts and endowments. Of the remain
der, about 23 per cent comes from
California State Scholarships, and 11
per cent from outside awards.
Approximately three-fourths of all
scholarships are renewed each year,
Huff reports, and more than 60 per
cent of the students who are not re
newed receive some form of grant
in-aid. Scholarships may be revoked
either on financial or scholastic
grounds.
GPA Important
Under present policy, all students
with CPA's over 2.5 have their schol
arships automatically renewed, bar
ring considerable change in their fi
nancial status, while students under
2.5 are reviewed by the Financial Aids
Committee and may have their schol
arships revoked. "We consider each
case on an individual basis," Huff said,
"If a student has a restricted scholar
ship which could not be awarded to
anyone else, he will probably be con
tinued."
"I would like for us to be able to
renew the scholarship of any person
who can stay in school academically,"
Huff added, "but unfortunately, we
just don't have enough money to do
this now."

very low interest rates. A maximum
of 50 per cent of the loan may be for
given if the recepient later teaches
for a set period in a public school.
Middle Class Drive
According to Huff, the new Guar
anteed Program will particularly bene
fit students whose parental resourses
lie in the $10,000-$15,000 range. "It's
really the middle class families who
are driven to the wall by educational
cost," Huff commented.

At present, approximately one-third
of the students at Stanford depend on
loans to finance some part of their
schooling.
More than $1,300,000 was loaned
through the Office of Financal Aids
last year, Huff said.
Scholarships and grants-in-aid, how
ever, remain a primary source of fi
nancial support for students. Figures
just released for this school year show
slightly more than 1900 students cur
rently hold scholarships or grants
in-aid.
Many of these students have also
taken out loans, as the current policy
at Stanford is to offer financial sup
port through a combination of schol
arships, loans, and jobs, Huff, said.
Financial Aid
About $2,300,000 in scholarship aid
was awarded this year, more than 60
per cent coming from university
monies, either from general funds, or
gifts and endowments. Of the remain
der, about 23 per cent comes from
California State Scholarships, and 11
per cent from outside awards.
Approximately three-fourths of all
scholarships are renewed each year,
Huff reports, and more than 60 per
cent of the students who are not re
newed receive some form of grant
in-aid. Scholarships may be revoked
either on financial or scholastic
grounds.
GPA Important
Under present policy, all students
with CPA's over 2.5 have their schol
arships automatically renewed, bar
ring considerable change in their fi
nancial status, while students under
2.5 are reviewed by the Financial Aids
Committee and may have their schol
arships revoked. "We consider each
case on an individual basis," Huff said,
"If a student has a restricted scholar
ship which could not be awarded to
anyone else, he will probably be con
tinued."
"I would like for us to be able to
renew the scholarship of any person
who can stay in school academically,"
Huff added, "but unfortunately, we
just don't have enough money to do
this now."
The current "tight money" situation
has thrown a kink into the implemen
tation of a new student loan program,
passed last summer by Congress, Rob
ert Huff, Stanford Student Financial
Aid Director, reports.
Bay Area bankers and university of
ficials will meet at Stanford Novem
ber 10 to discuss ways of getting the
program off the ground.
Guaranteed Rate
The new program, entitled the Guar
anteed Student Loan Program, pro
vides for loans through local banks to
students at a set interest rate of 6
per cent. If the student's family re
sources are less than $15,000/ year,
the U.S. Government will pay the
full interest while the student is in
school, and up to one-half of the in
terest from graduation until the loan
is paid off.
The 6 per cent interest rate is con*

siderably less than students can now
obtain through regular bank loans.
The Guaranteed Loan Program was
proposed last January by President
Lyndon Johnson to replace the Na
tional Defense Education Act (NDEA)
loans. However educators and bank
ers across the country protested so
strongly against dropping the NDEA
loans that both programs were even
tually passed.
NDEA loans provide up to $10,000
to students on the basis of need at
very low interest rates. A maximum
of 50 per cent of the loan may be for
given if the recepient later teaches
for a set period in a public school.
