ASSU President David Harris, minus his long: hair, stands in the rear of the
Legislature. Harris spoke at the University of Michigan last weekend and this
weekend will speak at Duke, Smith, and Mt Holyoke. His resolution calling for
a pass-fail freshman year was approved by the Legislature last night.
