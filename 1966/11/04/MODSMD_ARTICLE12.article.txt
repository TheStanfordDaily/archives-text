food—has increased 16 per cent over last
month, and the country's fragile economy
faces a new surge of inflation.
Economists reported yesterday that Saigon's
Consumer Price Index rose 13 per cent in the
past two weeks. They said it was related to
political infighting in South Vietnam, among
other things.

cent from April 1965, when the buildup of
American troops began, and June 1966, when
drastic financial reforms were undertaken.

• Nixon Blasts L.U.J.
NEW YORK —Former Vice President Rich
ard M. Nixon charged yesterday that proposals
for mutual troop withdrawals from Vietnam
would inevitably lead to a Communist victory
there.
He said Ambassador Arthur J. Goldberg,
Chief U.S. Delegate to the United Nations, has
offered peace concessions to diplomats at the
U.N. General Assembly which far exceed those
which the President has relayed to the Ameri
can people.
He said the U.N. delegate told diplomats
there that America has no objections to Viet
Cong participation in the Government of
South Vietnam when peace is achieved.
"The President has been silent on Mr.
Goldberg's proposals," Nixon declared, "He has

an obligation to clear up the confusion and
to declare whether or not America will nego
tiate with representatives of the National
Liberation Front; whether or not we will agree
to a coalition government with the Commu
nists.

Soviet Union will sign an agreement today

partment Press Ollicer Carl Bartch said. He
explained operations can begin only "after
technical authorities have finished required
preparations and after the designated airlines
have made the necessary arrangements among
themselves."

More than 1,200 undergraduates, the big
gest debate audience in years, crowded the
Oxford Union Hall for a tilt on the motion:
"That this house believes - that the mini
skirt does not go far enough."
Most debaters wore traditional evening dress

but the main speaker for the motion, Leofranc
Holford-Stevens of Christ Church College,
sported a Roman toga and a laurel wreath.
"A mini skirt gives you the opportunity of
being able to inspect your wares before you
buy," he argued.
The only woman speaker, 20-year-old Daphne
Triggs of St. Hilda's Collefie denounced the
mimi skirt as a "vestment of harlots."
"It saddens me that most single girls wan
der around exposing their limbs to

known the laws of nature."
(Voice from the audience: "Your're learn
ing.")
