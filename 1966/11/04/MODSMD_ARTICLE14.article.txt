# Rally On Row To Kick Off Farm's Homecoming Activities
## 
### 
Official homecoming activities
will get underway tonight with
Queen Annabelle Evans and
Princesses Ellie Watkins and
Diana Carter presiding at the
rally between Lathrop and Story
houses on the lower Row. The
rally will be held at 7:30 p.m.
and will also include the band
and pom-pon girls.
Work on decorations has al
ready begun on many of the
Row's front lawns, and judging

will be tonight. Tomorrow, at
half-time, Queen Annabelle will
award the trophies including the
special Queen's trophy.
The Senior Class will present
an After-Game Dance tomorrow
between 4 and 6 p.m. This will
also take place on lower Row, in
the street and sidewalks between
the Sigma Chi and Alpha Sigma
Phi houses and will feature the
"December's Children."

This year's homecoming game,
against Air Force, is unusual be
cause it is not a conference
game. The date was chosen to
give the various men's and wom
en's residences a chance to pre
pare their decorations.
This year marks the first time
Stanford has elected a home
coming queen and some difficul
ties have arisen; an ad hoc com
mittee is now looking into the
matter of Wendy G. Wonka's
"lost" votes.
