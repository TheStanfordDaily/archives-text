# Leppert Reappraises US Viet Policy
## 
### GEOFFREY STEVENS 
Stanford engineering profes
sor George Leppert, who seeks
the tenth congressional district
seat now held by Republican
Charles Gubser, is both well
spoken and outspoken. Leppert
and his campaign organization
are giving incumbent Gubser the
toughest fight of his fourteen
year political career.
The primary issue of our time,
in Leppert's opinion, is the pos
sibility of thermonuclear war.
Having been a member of the
scientific team which developed
the atomic submarine, Leppert
feels that he understands too
well the dreadful implications of
a total war. His understanding
of modern warfare caused him
"to get out of the lab and into
politics."
As a candidate, Leppert is Im
pressive not for his pleasant per
sonality, but for the direct and
honest manner in which he
speaks. He claims that he is
"running on the issues, and not
on personality." In an attempt
to bring the issues to the voters,
precinct workers hope to cover
over 90% of the congressional
district, distributing leaflets pre
senting Leppert's views.
Vietnam War
In Leppert's opinion, the war
in Vietnam looms as the most
significant issue in the cam
paign. He proposes that the
United States immediately and
permanently stop the bombing
in Vietnam. He further proposes
that the United States restrict
its ground operations to strict
defensive action so that losses
of American and Vietnamese life
will be minimized. By offering
to negotiate with the Viet Cong,
Leppert hopes that a cease-fire
can be secured under the super
vision of the International Con
trol Commission (Canada, India
and Poland). By announcing
American support for any gov
ernment freely elected by the
Vietnamese people, Leppert
hopes that political stability can
be brought to Vietnam.
On the domestic scene, Lep
pert believes there is a "powder
keg ready to explode" in the

problem of the big-city ghetto.
According to Leppert, the prob
lems of the ghetto are "partly
racial but are mostly due to pov
erty." He feels that "if we can
spend twenty billion dollars to
put a man on the moon, we can
create a social situation in
which every man who is willing
and able to work can find a job."
Admitting that Federal pro
grams are often wasteful, he
points out that no body other
than the Federal government
has the resources and ability to
carry out a massive redevelop
ment of our cities. When talking
about waste, candidate Leppert
cites the government's expendi
ture of one billion dollars to de
velop a nuclear powered plane
which was "known to be infeas
ible after the first one hundred
million has been spent." By es
calating the war on poverty
now, he thinks that taxpayers

will ultimately save themselves
money because they now con
tribute around forty billion do 1
lars to public welfare and pri
vate charity.
Domestic Program
In line with his position on
the poverty program, Leppert
supports federal aid to educa
tion and an expanded conserva
tion program. He would finance
increased domestic spending
with funds saved by de-escalat
ing the Vietnam war and by
generally cutting military spend
ing. He sees little use in develop
ing weapons at high costs if
these weapons soon become ob
solete.
If elected, candidate Leppert
states that he will stick to the
positions he advocates during
this campaign and will not sway
with what seems politically ex
pedient. He portrays his oppo
nent Gubser as a "tricky, shift
ing politician."
Believing that a congressman
should do more than just repre
sent, Leppert feels that it is the
duty of a representative to as
sume a role of leadership. If the
voters disagree with a repre
sentative's voting record, and if

he can't convince them of the
soundness of his views, he will
simply not be re-elected.
Something - Better
As to his qualifications, Lep
pert thinks that he would make
a unique contribution to Con
gress because of his background
in engineering. Congress spends
billions of dollars each year on
water and space programs which
few, if any, congressmen under
stand. Unlike a governor of a
large state, a congressman, ac

cording to Leppert, needs no
more executive ability than is
necessary to run an office. He
discredits his opponent's four
teen years of experience by call
ing them fourteen years of in
activity. He claims that "clever
debate technique will never hide
the leadership vacuum which
Gubser has provided for our
congressional district. We de
serve something better." And
candidate George Leppert aims
to be that "something better."
