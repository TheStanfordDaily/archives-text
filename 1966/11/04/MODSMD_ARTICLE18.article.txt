### BRUCE MERRY 
Bertolt Brecht: The Caucasian
Chalk Circle (Florence Schwim
ley Little Theatre, Berkeley.)
This play is made of allegory,
poetry and song â€” not easy
genres for a high school cast to
handle. So Mr. Manley's fresh

and boisterous reading of the
work last Friday wisely skirted
problems which would have
been beyond the reach of his
schoolchildren.
The fluency and control of his
youthful cast, however, was at
times astonishing. Their clown
ing, too, was spontaneous and
it is pleasing that such care
should be taken to make the
crowd scenes seem natural. The
Director never lost sight of the
plot, injecting the protagonist's
pilgrimage over the mountains
with a real sense of adventure.
That is good; the action in
Brecht can easily slow down and
split into framents.
The play traces the story of a
palace kitchen-maid who saves
the Governor's infant son. Pur
sued by his soldiers she sacri
fices everything to bring up the

child as her own. Finally the
real mother and the maid are
confronted in court. The case is
heard by a bizarre and eloquent
scoundrel, the judge Azdak,
who resolves it by a circle drawn
with chalk on the court room
floor.
Maternal Love
The maid, Grusha, was played
in a homely, foot-stamping way
by Miss Kurshals. She concen
trated on bringing out the "se
ductive power of goodness" in
her character and laying bare
the depth of maternal love.
There was a faintly irritating
foreign touch in the accent
which she adopted for the part
and she still has the pouting
and snatching gestures which
maturity will temper. Mr. Saar
ni, as her soldier-lover, brought
a naive and ingenious simplicity
to his part; a slow delivery
heightened the mellowness of
his particularly attractive voice.
Paul Kreshka, as Azdak, is
something of a virtuoso on the
stage. He swaggered and strut
ted, accepted bribes, made
speeches and cracked his jokes
with a temerity that Brecht
himself might have questioned.
His was a fine performance. But
caught up in the exhilaration of
his part an actor should not ad
lib beyond his terms of refer
ence. For an actor is always the
creature of his director. Thus
Mr. Kreshka tended to grab the
audience's attention by coming
in on his cues a fraction too
early or winking at the action
when he was silent and, for ex
ample, by swinging a jovial kick
at an old man stumbling off the
stage when it was not in the
author's instructions.
The translation, though the
program did not say so, was
Eric Bentley's. Mr. Manley soup
ed it up by projecting lantern
slides of Brueghel and Van Dyck
on the side-walls and by having
a little orchestra play the not
unpleasing percussion jingles
which have, apparently, become
any play's traditional accompa
niment these days. As a purist

one condemns all such acces
sories to the live drama, not
least the Director's critical homi
ly at the beginning of his show:
over a loud-speaker he informed
us that Brecht's works "make
him the giant of the twentieth
century theatre that he is."
Narrator Good
Great care was taken with
scenery and lighting. The cos
tumes were especially good. But
the production failed to under
line the dazzling poetry which
Brecht sprinkled through his
play. The measured voice of the
Narrator was so consistently
rich that he failed to capture
such limpid cadences as: "The
gentle call of a lover, the black
bird at dawn, the happy sigh of
the tired grape-picker as the
Angelus rings." He recited at
tractively but without the lines'
dim lilt of oblivion the lines:
"His face grew dimmer with the
passing moons/ ... She heard
his voice from the murmuring
maple/ And his voice grew faint
er with the passing moons."
Grusha, for example, juxtaposed

the sentences: "Michael, you
cause a lot of fuss. I came to
you as the pear-tree comes to
the sparrows," as if they had
the emotional intensity.
Even Azdak skimmed over the
falling strain: "Give your cheese
a troubled look, because, like all
beautiful things, it's already fad
ing away." Nor should the law
yer of the Governor's wife have
taken as pompous rhetoric
Brecht's panegyric on mother
hood: "Can one tear a child from
its mother? She has fed it with
her blood. She has borne it with
pain ... it has been observed that
the wild tigress, robbed of her
young, roams restless through
the mountains, shrunk to a sha
dow."
No effort was spared to carry
off this production. It captured
the tense dignity of Brecht's
views on social justice without
missing the whimsy of his poli
tical satire. The acting was fresh
and talented though it under
played the tantalising beauty of
poetry. As the singer himself in
toned: "So many words are said,
so many left unsaid." Perhaps
this performance did not give
the poet his Kay.
