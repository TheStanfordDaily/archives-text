# Harris Urges Sterling Appointees To Resign From Committee Posts

### STEVE RUTKUS 
Calling for a gesture of "student
-solidarity," Student Body President
Dave Harris expressed the hope that
those students newly appointed to the
Presidential Committees and not nom
inated by himself would "resign im
mediately."
Letters of certification were sent
last night to those approved by Presi
dent Wallace Sterling for student posi
tions in the Presidental Committees.
"Most, but not all" of Harris' nomi
nees were accepted, according to Fred
Glover, administrative asistant to the
President.
"Students named to the committees,
without being designated by the stu

dent body president and endorsed by
LASSU, cannot claim to represent the
student body," Harris told The Daily.
Neither LASSU nor the student body
will be influenced by these students,
Harris added.
Ground Rules
Glover claimed that Harris disre
garded "presidential ground rules" by
designating only one student for each
committee opening. For the past four
years Sterling has insisted on receiv
ing two nominations for each commi
tee seat from student body presidents.
Names of the committee appointees
will not be released until the students
themselves learn of their selection,
said Glover. Harris stated he had re
ceived "no indication" from Sterling

as to which people have been ap
proved.
"President Sterling's refusal to ap
prove all of my designees reflects his
desire for certain kinds of people,"
said Harris. He cited "front groups
such as the athletic department" that
might have offered to Sterling nomi
nees significantly different from his
own.
Psychic Mud
"It's a matter of constituency and rep
resentation; Dr. Sterling should rea
lize this," Harris maintained.
Although the student body presi
dent labeled the Presidential Commi
tees "great miasmas of psychic mud,"
he emphasized that they have "great
symbolic worth. Their power to in
fluence university policy," Harris con
tended, "requires that only represen
tative students be members."
Administrative assistant Glover did
not specify whether certain Harris
designees were rejected because of
their qualifications or because of Har
ris' alleged disregard for Sterling's
"ground rules."
Senior Class President Jim Binns
speculated that the source of Sterl
ing's non-Harris appointees was the
recommendations of various faculty
members. "There has been no formal
student opposition to Harris' nomi
nees," Binns said.
LASSU Resolution
The last controversy involving the
Presidential Committees occurred in
October, 1963, when student represen
tation was cut by two members in
both the Student Affairs and Services
Committee and the Committee on
Public Exercises.
Out of the uproar which followed in
LASSU emerged a resolution protest
ing the decline of student influence in
terms similar to Harris' current ob
jections.

The crux of LASSU's October, 1963
statement argued, "the presentation
of a student viewpoint can only claim
validity if the students are chosen in
some democratic manner by those
whose viewpoint they are to repre
sent."

Administrative assistant Glover did
not specify whether certain Harris
designees were rejected because of
their qualifications or because of Har
ris' alleged disregard for Sterling's
"ground rules."
Senior Class President Jim Binns
speculated that the source of Sterl

LASSU Resolution
The last controversy involving the
Presidential Committees occurred in
October, 1963, when student represen
tation was cut by two members in
both the Student Affairs and Services
Committee and the Committee on
Public Exercises.
Out of the uproar which followed in
LASSU emerged a resolution protest
ing the decline of student influence in
terms similar to Harris' current ob
jections.

The crux of LASSU's October, 1963
statement argued, "the presentation
of a student viewpoint can only claim
validity if the students are chosen in
some democratic manner by those
whose viewpoint they are to repre
sent."
Calling for a gesture of "student
-solidarity," Student Body President
Dave Harris expressed the hope that
those students newly appointed to the
Presidential Committees and not nom
inated by himself would "resign im
mediately."
Letters of certification were sent
last night to those approved by Presi
dent Wallace Sterling for student posi
tions in the Presidental Committees.
"Most, but not all" of Harris' nomi
nees were accepted, according to Fred
Glover, administrative asistant to the
President.
"Students named to the committees,
without being designated by the stu

dent body president and endorsed by
LASSU, cannot claim to represent the
student body," Harris told The Daily.
Neither LASSU nor the student body
will be influenced by these students,
Harris added.
Ground Rules
Glover claimed that Harris disre
garded "presidential ground rules" by
designating only one student for each
committee opening. For the past four
years Sterling has insisted on receiv
ing two nominations for each commi
tee seat from student body presidents.
Names of the committee appointees
will not be released until the students
themselves learn of their selection,
said Glover. Harris stated he had re
ceived "no indication" from Sterling

as to which people have been ap
proved.
"President Sterling's refusal to ap
prove all of my designees reflects his
desire for certain kinds of people,"
said Harris. He cited "front groups
such as the athletic department" that
might have offered to Sterling nomi
nees significantly different from his
own.
Psychic Mud
"It's a matter of constituency and rep
resentation; Dr. Sterling should rea
lize this," Harris maintained.
Although the student body presi
dent labeled the Presidential Commi
tees "great miasmas of psychic mud,"
he emphasized that they have "great
symbolic worth. Their power to in
fluence university policy," Harris con
tended, "requires that only represen
tative students be members."
Administrative assistant Glover did
not specify whether certain Harris
designees were rejected because of
their qualifications or because of Har
ris' alleged disregard for Sterling's
"ground rules."
