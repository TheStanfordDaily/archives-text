"Lyndon's Banes" (a collec
tion of both pre-rehearsed and
improvised skits on a wide range
of contemporary topics) is the
first production of the new Pit
schell Players, opening this Fri
day (November 4) at 9 p.m. at
120 Julian. The show will run
indefinitely with performances
every Friday and Saturday
night.
Pitschell Players is a group of
young (18 to 26) people who
have been working under the di
rection of Ann Raim, formerly
of the Second City improvisa
tional company. They are open
ing at 120 Julian (the Parish
Hall of St. John the Evangelist
church, between 15th and 16th
off Mission) at the invitation of
the Rector, Father Allan Lot.
The hall now functions as a
coffee house, with entertainment
such as folk singers and movies
on nights when Pitschell Play
are not performing.
The skits which make up
"Lyndon's Banes" are derived
from material such as the unde
clared war in Vietnam, Smokey
the Bear, how to get drafted
and how not to (depending on
your preference), the "new
South," living in a commune,
LSD, and the recent riots in
Hunter's Point. Also a part of
the evening's program is folk
singer Jon Fromer, who recently
recorded an album on the Phil
lips label named "Jonathan
David and Elbert," plus jazz mu
sician Donald Rafael Garrett,
who recorded last year with both
Archie Shepp and John Coltrane.
Garrett does a set by himself,
using bass, saxophone, cazoo,
and African harp. Donations are
$1 at the door, and coffee is 5
cents.
