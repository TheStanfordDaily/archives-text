# Green Field For An Old Actor
## 
### SUE BAKER 
Another newcomer to the
Stanford Repertory Theater this
year is Gilbert Green, who re
cently received high critical
praise for his portrayal of Eno
barbus in the company's produc
tion of "Anthony and Cleopat
ra".
An actor for 28 years, Green
says that he slipped into his
profession almost unintentional
ly. He graduated from Ohio Uni
with a science degree and pre
medical studies behind him, and
he worked a year, fully intend
ing to continue to medical
school. But he veered to New
York, and became involved in
theater, his first professional
job being with a Shakespearean
company. It's proved to be a
lucky accident, however, and
Green's career has been filled
with a wide variety of profes
sional endeavor, from Broadway
and off-Broadway productions to

6tock and tours, films and tele
vision.
Gil spent the last six and a
half years in Hollywood before
coming to Stanford, and he
looks upon his stay here as a
real rejuvenating process — a
chance to get away from the
hack performances and compro
mised qualities of Hollywood.
Theater Functions
He feels that repertory theat
ers. such as those at Stanford.
Brandeis and Milwaukee, per
form valuable functions not
only in providing actors with the
opportunity to get back to real
theater — relate to the audience,
play and other actors — but also
in giving audiences the oppor
tunity to see live actors in pro
fessional productions.
"A production like 'Anthony
and Cleopatra' couldn't be done
in commercial theater where
financial considerations are most
important; here, the artistic
goal is foremost. If a commer
cial production was criticized as
strongly as 'Anthony and Cleo
patra', it could never continue—
to evolve and improve as we
have. We can experiment, and,
as Erik (Vos) says, 'it may not
be right, but it's never dull.'"
Green feels that as repertory
theaters are established around
the country, commercial theater
can't help but be affected —
"eventually, as audiences are in
fluenced, there will be a better
level of theater in the hands of
the commercialists." "Audiences
are being educated to accept
contemporary approaches to
classical theater — such as we
did here, much as they had to
learn to accept the works of
playwrights such as Albee,
Pinter and Williams."
Green also feels that Stan
ford's integrated theater pro
gram is of equally great value
to the students in the drama de

partment and the Master of Fine
Arts candidates who work with
the Rep Company on produc
tions. In the up-coming presenta
tion of "Out at Sea," the five
male parts are taken by three
members of the professional
company and two graduate stu
dents; "it's a real learning pro
cess for students and profession
als alike."
Professional Priority
In his wide theater back
ground, Green singles out a New
York production of "The World
of Sholem Aleichem" as his
"most rewarding experience."
Disregarding financial enumer
ations, the actors — who gave
their own money for the produc
tion — writer and director all
worked together in the creative
process. Actors' suggestions on
script changes and direction
were weighed carefully, and
everyone contributed to the pro
duction, "much as we are able
to discuss and suggest here."
"At Stanford there is no com
petitive spirit, no star billings
and no problems with profes
sional priority; such unity of ef
fort is bound to give good re
sults."
Green says that his training
has stemmed from just working

a great deal. Although he is not
a memebr of the Actors' Studio,
Green uses method approaches
and has had method training.
He feels that there is an unjust
caricature of method actors as
dirty te shirts", an image which
is quite alien to the real pur
poses of the method approach
and the real involvement which
Studio actors have in their roles.
As Enobarbus, Gil was prais
ed for his rich, resonant voice—
which many people consider the
mark of the old-time technical
school of acting. "I just natural
ly have a strong voice," he as
serts, and unfortunately, Memo
rial Auditorium — which is an
auditorium, not a theater —
presents an extreme disadvant
age to actors with normally ade
quate voice projection. "It's dif
ficult to be heard, much less un
derstood."
Youthful Spirit
Green feels that since he's
come to Stanford, he's really
been infused with the youthful
spirit of the University. "I've
been lax in my interpretation of
what youth is doing today — it's
a great benefit for me to be
here." I'd like to echo, that his
being here is a great benefit
for us.
