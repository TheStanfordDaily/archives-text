# Cards Load Heavy Artillery To Blast Air Force Cadets
## 
### BOB THIERIOT 
Stanford takes the field this
Saturday against the Air Force,
hoping to even their 3-4 record
and to play one steady winning
game. The opposition is not too

imposing, though the Falcons
have an identical 3-4 record; the
Indians rate as two touchdown
favorites. The game will begin
45 minutes later than usual, at
2:15.
The biggest question of the
game and for the rest of the sea
son is the backfield. Who is go
ing to play? Where are people
going to play?
There are three possible can
didates for quarterback, two for

halfback, and throe for flanker.
Some of this puzzlement was
solved today when Coach John
Ralston announced at practice
today that Dave Lewis is the
starting halfback and Bob Blunt
the starting flanker.
Washington or Williams?
This means that Bill Shoe
maker will not start the game,
in spite of his great performance
last week against the Huskies.
Jack Root will, of course, be at
full hack. The question is quar
terback: Gene Washington or
Chuck Williams?
Stanford's chief problem this
year has been its offense. Its
main problem on offense has
been passing. In the seasonal
statistics Stanford's rushing of
fense rates better than that of
its opponents — 161-156 in yards
per game, 3.6-3.2 in yards ner
rushing play. But passing Stan
ford trails its opponents by per
centage completed, 40 to 54, to
tal yards, 920 to 1,065.
It seems that Ralston will be
forced to go more to the passing
game. Thus, Chuck Williams
would be the candidate for quar

terback. He is definitely a better
passer than Gene Washington.
Williams completes about 15%
more passes than Washington.
It is true that Stanford would
lose the running of Gene Wash-

ington. but that could easily be
compensated by giving Dave
Lewis the ball more often. All
season, he has been the forgot
ten man of the backfield except
for hi 6 ninety yard run against
Tu lane.
Williams almost deserves a
starting chance anyway, after
the second half attack he led
against Washington last week.
Also, Washington has a pain in
his upper back. Stanford has a
lot going for them this week
end — homecoming, the seniors

last home contest, and a possibly
solidified backfield.
Imagination
The Cards showed last week
that they can run plays with
imagination. The cross-field 40
yard lateral, using Blunt on a
reverse, and the halfback pass
were instrumental in keeping
Stanford close in last week's
encounter. On defense, the In
dians could use an occasional
blitz by the linebackers. Even if
it were not immediately success
ful. it would still cause the op
ponent's quarterback, to stay
awake. In past games he knew
that Stanford wouldn't blitz, so
h<~> didn't concern himself with it.
An impressive win this week
end would send the Indians to
UCLA with confidence, and to
Berkeley with the knowledge
that they can continue the Big
Game win streak.
