# University Refuses Facilities To SCPV Meeting And Film
## 
### DICK LIVINGSTON Asst. Managing- Editor 
The Committee on Public Exercises
yesterday refused to approve a re
quest from the Stanford Committee
for Peace in Vietnam (SCPV) to use
University facilities to show a film on
the Vietnam war tonight.
The SCPV now plans to show Time
of the Locust, an American Friends
Service Committee documentary, in
conjunction with a rally in White Me
morial Plaza at 8 p.m.
Also featured at the rally will be a
tape of Stokeley Carmichael's speech
in Berkeley on Black Power and an
address by ASSU President Dave Har
ris. A discussion will follow.
Not Registered
The Vietnam peace group was de
nied the use of Cubberley Auditorium
because it has not registered with the
Associated Students because they feel
student organizations should be re
sponsible to the ASSU and not the
Dean's office.
A SCPV spokesman indicated that
Winbigler's appearance before the
Academic Council to discuss the sub
poening of registration lists from the
Dean's office by the House Unameri
can Activities Committee (HUAC)
was one of the events that prompted
the SCPV to register with the ASSU.
HUAC Subpoena
Charles Drekmeier, professor of
Political Science, told The Daily that
"since the University may decide it
has to respond to a subpoena from an
organization like HUAC, they may
decide it is unwise to insist that stu

dent groups register with the Dean's
office."
Drekmeier explained that he under
stood that the Student Affairs Com
mittee had decided the ASSU would
register groups. The Committee on
Public Exercises would then cooperate
with the ASSU, he added.
Professor Drekmeier, citing a simi
lar case at Berkeley, said several legal
questions are involved in the dispute.
"It is my hope that the University
will be able to work this out before
groups concerned with the preserva
tion of civil liberties get involved," he
concluded.
In Loeo Parentis
In a prepared statement, the SCPV
said that the demand by the Dean's
office to register student groups and
its refusal to afford University faci
lities to those who refuse to do so is
"an element of an in loco parentis
philosophy by which the Administra
tion tries to regulate students."
Pointing out that they have com
plied with ASSU regulations for regi
stration, the SCPV believes students
regulate themselves through student
government, the statement said.
The SCPV plans to distribute anti
war leaflets in the Palo Alto area on
Saturday as well as demonstrate
against the war at Stanford's home
coming game with the Air Force Aca
demy that afternoon.
On Sunday the group plans to dis
tribute leaflets to soldiers at the San
Francisco Airport. The activities are
part of what the SCPV calls "Days
of mobilization against the war in
Vietnam."
