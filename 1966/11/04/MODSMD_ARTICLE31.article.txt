# Frosh Look For Second Win Against Loaded UCLA Squad
## 
### BILL GRAHAM 
The freshman football team,
trying to come up with an even
record for the season, travels to
UCLA Friday. Cal dumped the
Papooses last week, to give them
their second loss in three games.
UCLA has recruited heavily,
giving out almost forty football
scholarships, and their team is
loaded with talent. Card frosh
coach Russ Hampton cited two
of the Brubabes as especially
outstanding. Bill Bolden, their
quarterback, is a threat as a
passer or a runner and halfback
Greg Jones, a much sought-after
high school prospect, is excellent
all-round player.
The little Bruins run out of a
T formation with a flanker, a
split end or a slot back. They
are a passing team and are
particularly fond of using Bolden
on option plays, where he can
either pass or run.

Despite all of UCLA's talent,
the Papooses' main job on Sat
urday will be to not beat them
selves. The little Cards have
proved that they are a very good
football team when they hang on
to the ball. They beat San Jose
handily when they only made
two fumbles, and in the first
quarter of the Cal game, they
drove for their first touchdown
as if there was no other team
on the field.
Coach Hampton has been hav
ing special drills all week, in an
effort to keep his backs and ends
from dropping the ball. In ad
dition, he has instituted a two
platoon system so that his play
ers can concentrate on learning
one position. There are a few
linemen who have learned both,
so that they will be able to play
on either the offensive "go" team
or the defensive "red raider"
team.

This system will also allow a
few of the freshmen who have
not been playing regularly to see
action. Bob Adams and Don
Lightfoot will move into the de
fense as pivot man and bull re
spectively.
Jim Plunkett will be starting
at quarterback again for the
Cards, but if the Papooses find
themselves behind and need to
pass, it is likely that Ron Fuji
kawa, who completed six passes
in seven attempts against Cal,
will step in.
Once again the Cards will be
relying heavily on the running
of fullback Don Parish and half
back Howard Williams. Parish
was the only offensive player
Hampton singled out for praise
after the Cal game.
Dick Oliver, who had two in
terceptions last week, and who
has been a standout on de
fense all season, is a doubtful
starter for Saturday's game.
Oliver has an injured hand and
it is not known yet whether
it is broken or not

The freshman football team,
trying to come up with an even
record for the season, travels to
UCLA Friday. Cal dumped the
Papooses last week, to give them
their second loss in three games.
UCLA has recruited heavily,
giving out almost forty football
scholarships, and their team is
loaded with talent. Card frosh
coach Russ Hampton cited two
of the Brubabes as especially
outstanding. Bill Bolden, their
quarterback, is a threat as a
passer or a runner and halfback
Greg Jones, a much sought-after
high school prospect, is excellent
all-round player.
The little Bruins run out of a
T formation with a flanker, a
split end or a slot back. They
are a passing team and are
particularly fond of using Bolden
on option plays, where he can
either pass or run.

Despite all of UCLA's talent,
the Papooses' main job on Sat
urday will be to not beat them
selves. The little Cards have
proved that they are a very good
football team when they hang on
to the ball. They beat San Jose
handily when they only made
two fumbles, and in the first
quarter of the Cal game, they
drove for their first touchdown
as if there was no other team
on the field.
Coach Hampton has been hav
ing special drills all week, in an
effort to keep his backs and ends
from dropping the ball. In ad
dition, he has instituted a two
platoon system so that his play
ers can concentrate on learning
one position. There are a few
linemen who have learned both,
so that they will be able to play
on either the offensive "go" team
or the defensive "red raider"
team.

This system will also allow a
few of the freshmen who have
not been playing regularly to see
action. Bob Adams and Don
Lightfoot will move into the de
fense as pivot man and bull re
spectively.
Jim Plunkett will be starting
at quarterback again for the
Cards, but if the Papooses find
themselves behind and need to
pass, it is likely that Ron Fuji
kawa, who completed six passes
in seven attempts against Cal,
will step in.
Once again the Cards will be
relying heavily on the running
of fullback Don Parish and half
back Howard Williams. Parish
was the only offensive player
Hampton singled out for praise
after the Cal game.
Dick Oliver, who had two in
terceptions last week, and who
has been a standout on de
fense all season, is a doubtful
starter for Saturday's game.
Oliver has an injured hand and
it is not known yet whether
it is broken or not
