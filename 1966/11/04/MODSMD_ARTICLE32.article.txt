# Law School, El Toro Take IM Cross Country Laurels
## 
### 
A remarakble 9:28 clocking by
Gene More of Law School and an
El Toro onslaught in the under
graduate division provided high
points in Wednesday's intra
mural cross country meet.
More's time, the best in re
cent memory over a winding two
miles of Stanford Golf Course,
sparked his five-man Law team
to a one-point margin over the
Neutrinos in the graduate divi
sion, with the Linguistics De
partment placing third.
Jeff Richey, with a 10:13 win
ning time, led a brigade of Toro
runners to an overwhelming vic
tory. Closest pursuer was Theta
Xi, with 45 points to the win
ners' 73, while third-place Don
ner came in with 40 1/2.
Beta Biz tries to keep its play
off hopes alive against Cro Mem

and Phi Kap goes for its fifth
straight win against Delta Chi in
important football games today.
In an attempt to provide some
visibility for last-moment hero
ics, IM director Gary Ness has
requested that afternoon foot
ball games begin as soon after
4 as is convenient for both
teams, and that the already brief
halftime be curtailed further.
