# Seniors Keyed For Last Home Game
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Stanford senior football play
ers will wear the Cardinal's col
ors in Stanford Stadium for the
last time when the Indians take
on a pesky Air Force squadron
tomorrow afternoon.
To many, tomorrow's game
will be the last time they will
play as a home team —ever.
After eight years of football, re
actions to the "last game" vary.
John Guillory said, "In a way
I feel sad. I enjoyed playing ball
at Stanford, and this will be my
last time on the Stanford field.
I only hope I can come off a
winner. Yet, this game means
more to me than any other."
A 1 Wilbum said that four
years have passed awfully fast.
"It hasn't really dawned on me
that it's all over. I think I'll
miss It."
Gosh And Golly!
John Mason commented with
seriousness, "Gosh and golly, it's
been great!"
Rick Derby noted, "I will miss
the Derby days, and I will miss
the coaches."
With two games looming large
after the Air Force contest, Bill
Ostrander said, "I don't think
this one means that much more."
Asked whether he thought the
team would be "up" for the Air
Force, Ostrander pointed out
that "We've been able to get
up for the last three, and we're
up now."
"It'll be funny when a bunch
of 4F guys knock off the Air
Force," an anonymous body
sighed gently in the background.
"The last game always means
a little more, although I don't
think we're more excited about
this one. You get a certain feel
ing going into your last game in
four years," recounted Dave
Lewis about to meet the climax
of his college career.
