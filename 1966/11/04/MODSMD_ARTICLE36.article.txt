# Poloists Face SJS, O' Club
## 
### 
Stanford's water poloists, still
bleeding from the cruel bite of
two one-goal losses last weekend
in Los Angeles, face San Jose
State tonight in t!he Spartans'
tank. Tomorrow morning at 10,
the San Francisco Olympic Club
brings a potent squad to the En
cina Pool.
All-World goalie Milan Muska
tirovic forms a 3 by 10 foot wall
in front of the Olympic Club
goal. Muskatirovic was Yugo
slavia's goaltender in the 1964
Olympics. Yugoslavia tied Hun
gary, 4-4, in the Olympic finals,
but placed second on a goal per
centage basis from earlier
games.
While Muskatirovic is block
ing shots, ex Stanford captain
and All-American Billl Ready will
be firing his patented hole shot

sizzlers. Marty Hull, also a
Stanford All-American of yore,
may not be able to play be
cause of an eye infection.
The Olympic Club knocked off
Cal earlier this season. Cal beat
Stanford, 10-9. Later the O'Club
lost by one goal to San Jose in
double overtime. The O'Club
played one man short of the
normal 6 field men for the last
15 minutes of the game.
San Jose, with one of its
strongest teams in years beat
Stanford, 9-8, early in the sea

son. Stanford played without
All-American and current high
scorer Gary Sheerer, and could
not put together a consistent
attack.
Since then, however, the Tribe
has played several hundred per
cent better, and will be after a
liberal libation of Spartan blood.
Stanford captain Mike Sorem
has shown the most remarkable
improvement. Sorem made 18
saves in the Cards' 11-10 sudden
death win over USC, and put
forth intense efforts last week

end against USC and UCLA.
Papooses Win 6 Straight
The Stanford frosh poloists
opened their season with a 9-23
debacle against San Jose's frosh.
After losing two more, Jimmie
Smith's Papooses jelled. Last
weekend's 25-11 rout of the Cal
Club and 14-10 win over San
Jose City College stretched to
six the Papooses' win string.
The frosh hit the Spartababes
tonight, and face a very strong
College of San Mateo team Sat
urday at 11, at Stanford.
