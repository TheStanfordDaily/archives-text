WHAT'S GOING ON?
Last week, Edward Kokalas, Michigan State stu
dent, answered a letter from Robert W. Galvin,
Motorola Chairman, which asked: "What's wrong
with business?". Mr. Kokalas raised a number of
trenchant issues and this is Mr. Calvin's first reply.
Other points will he tackled in subsequent issues
of this paper.
The exchange is part of a unique dialogue between
campus and corporation — a dialogue that will
continue as long as there are points to be made.
This and similar discussions will be published in
newspapers on over 20 campuses.
Hopefully, this exchange of ideas will help resolve
existing differences and serve as a vehicle for
mutual respect and understanding.

Dear Mr. Kokalas:
I think you're right. There is a definite
need for a campaign spotlighting the
crucial role that business plays in our
society. That's one of the reasons for
Ihis dialogue.
You state that some students feel that
business is no longer the prime contri
butor to our way of life. That more and
more students are looking to the
Federal government as the more dy
namic and vital force in the country.
If this attitude truly represents campus
thinking, we're in for some serious
trouble.
Before examining the respective roles
of business and government, I'd like to
make it clear that my remarks are not
directed at the subject's obvious po
litical overtones. Every man's politics
is his own affair. I couldn't presume to
represent the views of all businessmen
on this subject.
In our society, government's role is to
create the environment in which all of
us function. Within this framework,
what the government does is limited by
our Constitution, laws, and judicial re
view system as well as by the wishes
of the people. Historically, the role and
function of government is not a con
stant, and varies with the tenor of the
times.
Basically, government is not a creator
of wealth. With a few exceptions, only
the private sector of our economy
creates wealth, in its generic sense.
Actually, via taxes, government is a

half-partner in the wealth created by
industry and also shares in the monies
payed as wages to employees. It is be
cause the private sector has been so
successful in generating affluence that
we, today, are so well equipped to meet
our social, economic, and cultural
needs.
Government is also a regulator or con
troller of society. It is taking a greater
role in this area because of its heavy
involvement in the purchase of prod
ucts and services from industry and in
the dispensing of subsidies. However,
while government can purchase, regu
late, and opine, it cannot do—it must
depend on the private sector to trans
form intentions into actions.
No President, no Congress, no Admin
istration has ever proposed that gov
ernment should assume the functions
of our free enterprise system. As Presi
dent Kennedy stated, in a 1962 address:
"It is well to remind ourselves from
time to time of the benefits we derive
from the maintenance of a free market
system. The system rests on freedom of
consumer choice, the profit motive, and
a vigorous competition for the buyer's
dollar . . .
"The free market system is a decen
tralized regulator of our economic sys
tem. (It] is a more efficient decision
maker than even the wisest central
planning body, but even more import
ant, the free market keeps economic
power widely dispersed. It is thus a
vital underpinning of our democratic
society."
In your letter you ask: "Who will build
the Great Society—business or govern
ment?" My answer is that business will
do the actual building. It will supply
the knowledge, technology, and per
sonnel to get the job done. It will gen
erate the wealth and the jobs that are
essential to a healthy, vigorous society.
The great social and economic prob
lems of our times —urban blight, air
and water pollution, desalination, in
creasing the world's food supply—all
will be resolved through the capabili
ties of private industry, working in

dependency or in partnership with
government.
You imply that students with technical
training are choosing careers in govern
ment rather than business in the belief
that that is where the action will be.
I'd suggest they stop and reconsider.
Look at it this way. At Motorola, we
have men who live and breathe every
Gemini space flight. General Electric
and Westinghouse are doing tremend
ously important work in solving the
pollution problem. Bectel is a recog
nized pace setter in developing eco
nomical methods of converting salt
water to fresh water. International
Minerals is exploring oceans looking
for new sources of foods and fertilizers.
Obviously, I could go on and on. But I
think the point has been made. Look
around you. Pick up a newspaper or
magazine. Try and isolate an area of
production iin which private industry
does not carry the main burden and
responsibility.
Government needs young, creative
minds. But business needs them, too.
And, on the basis of my experience, I'm
convinced that the really important
breakthroughs, the practical and bene
ficial applications of new knowledge
are going to take place within the cor
porate walls.,
Robert W. Galvin,
Chairman, Motorola, Inc.
