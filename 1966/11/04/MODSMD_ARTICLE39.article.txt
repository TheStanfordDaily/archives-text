## Committee's Goal: Onward From Martindale Report 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
As a student member of the
recently-established General
Studies sub-committee on over
seas campuses, I would like to
clarify a few misconceptions con
cerning the sub-committee's
functions as expressed in your
editorial of October 31.
Contrary to your Indication,
the Martindale Report always
has been and will remain the
first consideration of the sub
committee. The faculty and stu
dent members, as well as Dr.
Walker, are committed to review
fully the report's recommenda
tions concerning curriculum flex
ibility, community relations, civi
lization courses, etc. I think I
can speak for the other student
members in guaranteeing that
this will be the case.
The very establishment of the
sub-committee following last
spring's final draft of the Mar
tindale Report attests to the will
ingness of the students to per
sist and of the faculty and ad
ministration to cooperate in
achieving the basic recommenda
tions of the report: the establish
ment of permanent and continu
ing student advice and influence
on the overseas campuses pro
gram. As a first step, student
recommendations are being in
corporated into the agenda of
this month's directors' meeting
in Florence.
I would like to emphasize also
that the Martindale Report and
even the new sub-committee

should not be and definitely will
not be the final solution to stu
dent involvement in the overseas
campuses program. The sub
committee itself will be able to
recommend changes dealing with
aspect of the academic program.
Furthermore, the Overseas Cam
puses Board is presently over
hauling the orientation proced
ures of both the pre-application
and pre-departure segments of
the program. I believe that the
Board can also extend itself, as
Prof. Hastorf suggests, into
areas of particular concern for
each campus.
The real test of the effective
ness of these new positions and
new areas of influence will come
over time—hopefully not the
time set by the more permanent
members of this community, but
rather the more limited time of
the student and more particu
larly of the junior and senior
student members of the sub
committee. In Marcia Cohn's
words, we want to "get hop
ping." We will not be satisfied
with occasional advice at the
asking of the administration; we
intend to offer and we have been
encouraged to offer definite pro
posals to improve the program
and new ways to envision the
aims of the program. We may
not intend the "militant" reap
praisal that Dr. Walker has
spoken of, but we do intend a
thorough one. The recent polari
zation of positions of "student"
and "administrator," while con
taining a large amount of truth
and stimulating critical discus
sions, will tend only to result in
a similar polarization of atti
tudes: that is, of aggressiveness
and stubbornness. The discus
sion should move away from
personalities and into the ultiza
tion and expansion of the re
cently created and strengthened
areas of student power.

• A Fair Share
Editor, The Daily:
I am saddened by the letter in
yesterday's Daily from Mrs.
Luke Kabat, accusing Dean
Rosenzweig and Dr. Hertzenberg
of going "back on their word"
and acting "in bad faith." I would
like It recorded that I too, along
with Dean Rosenzweig and Dr.
Hertzenberg, share responsibil
ity for the promises made to Mrs.

Kabat. The three of us discussed
the matter with her on a Satur
day morning and reached agree
ment. By the following Monday
she had been persuaded that we
could not be trusted to keep our
promises.
I believe that SUCCEED will
be a significant catalyst in Stan
ford's ongoing effort to provide
education for members of low
income minority groups, and if
"bad faith" is to be imputed to
those with this desire, Dean
Rosenzweig and Dr. Hertzenberg
are people with whom I am
proud to share that allegation.

• Conscious Conscript
Editor, The Dally;
As a self-realized (as opposed to
religious indoctrinated) Consci
entious Objector, I am often ask
ed to give justification for such
a position. Society, in the person
of the woman at my draft board,
requires of me a fairly rigorous
effort to rationalize my opposi
tion to killing and war. Even
then, no one believes me until
I say I'll go to jail rather than
serve in the army. And if I go
to jail, eventually becoming an
"ex-convict," I thereby reinforce
the community's suspicion that
I am no good.
Thhs bitter rite is not peculiar
to me: but it is peculiar to
C-O's. I propose that we at Stan
ford somersault the Selective
Service approach by applying
these same methods to those
who want to joint ROTC, NRO
TC, Air Science, or enlist. This
seems especially worthwhile as
it is surely more important that
we be convinced of someone's
sincerity before we allow him to
kill in our name (or lead others
in killing) than if he wants to
be peaceful. Nonchalant C-O's
are jailed or converted to sol
diers, too, too, the army should
reject those casual soldiers who
cannot demonstrate a commit
ment to the logic of killing.
Membership in these groups

at Stanford often involves a sal
ary or scholarship money, thus
it is possible that some appli
cants are self-seekers rather
than people of military charac
ter and conviction. Then too,
wearing uniforms, drilling, hav
ing meetings, parades, balls and
military sweethearts are activi
ties which obscure the issue of
killing.
I am serious. There are pres
ently 594 men involved in the
military science programs at
Stanford. They can't all be seri
ous. I suggest that this commu
nity demand of them what the
community at-large demands of
C-O's: a rigorous justification of
their position. Perhaps there are
those, indoctrinated from in
fancy with the strategies of the
cold-war ideologies, who plead
war as their destiny just as the
Quakers plead peace. We should,
too be fair, allow these people
to join the military if they hon
estly believe in a principle, or
supreme being, that recom
mends killing as in its interest.
Otherwise, the procedure would
be exactly as the same as it is
for C-O's: of those who claim
joining the military as a con
scious decision, we must demand
to know their credo.

• Royal Comment
Editor, The Daily:
Cardinals' Board has again
demonstrated that it is some
thing left over from the Stan
ford of the 19305. Failure to
tabulate the votes for Wendy
G. Wonka ignores the majority
of the student body which is
just plain tired of Cardinals'
Board games.
We understand that a small,
but random sample of ballots
showed that Wendy tied with
the announced winner. Cardi
nals' Board would be well-ad
vised to turn over the rest of the
ballots if they want student body
support in the future.
Actually, if Cardinals Board
wishes to suppress the informa

tion, it just makes it easier to
cut the budget for this group
when it comes before LASSU
Spring quarter.

• 300 Year Trial
Editor, The Daily;
Jim Garrigus is grossly misin
formed in interpreting Black
Power and in advising black
people to "try acting like Ameri
can citizens." For three hundred
years black men have tried to
vote like American citizens, earn
a living like American citizens,
become educated like American
citizens, enjoy public facilities
like American citizens, and pur
sue life, liberty, and happiness
like American citizens. Black
men have been enslaved, pillag
ed, lynched, shot, brutalized, our
women raped, our infants bomb
ed in Southern churches UN
LIKE American citizens. Where

lies this thing called nonvio
lence?
Black Power, as defined by
black people, entails self-deter
mination, self-respect, and self
defense for black people. All
three of these ideas. If self-de
fense forces us to violence —
then, in the American way —
Roll 'em, Pete!!
Advice to blacks does not re
quire vast amounts of courage.
If those whites who profess
ever-so-loudly to be liberal are
genuinely and sufficiently con
cerned to act in behalf of human
relationships, do they have the
fortitude to oust the Klan and
the crackers and make Black
Power no longer exigent?

• Election Problems
Editor, The Daily;
I would like to correct yes
terday's election article by Steve

Gruber. He was in error on two
important points.
1) First, the Homecoming
Queen sponsors did not com
plain. Rather, I complained con
cerning the tardiness of their
preparations. In order to pro
vide the Queen candidates with
more exposure before the vot
ers, I extended the election.
2) Secondly, the essence of
the "OFF!" group's complaint is
obscured in Mr. Gruber's article.
The question in "OFF!" leader
Janet Howell's mind was what
week her referendum election
was to be held. Mr. Gruber cor
rectly states that Miss Howell
was confused concerning elec
tion dates. But he incorrectly
implies that this confusion was
due to starting the election Mon
day, October 31 rather than
Tuesday, November 1.

• Conscious Conscript
Editor, The Dally;
As a self-realized (as opposed to
religious indoctrinated) Consci
entious Objector, I am often ask
ed to give justification for such
a position. Society, in the person
of the woman at my draft board,
requires of me a fairly rigorous
effort to rationalize my opposi
tion to killing and war. Even
then, no one believes me until
I say I'll go to jail rather than
serve in the army. And if I go
to jail, eventually becoming an
"ex-convict," I thereby reinforce
the community's suspicion that
I am no good.
Thhs bitter rite is not peculiar
to me: but it is peculiar to
C-O's. I propose that we at Stan
ford somersault the Selective
Service approach by applying
these same methods to those
who want to joint ROTC, NRO
TC, Air Science, or enlist. This
seems especially worthwhile as
it is surely more important that
we be convinced of someone's
sincerity before we allow him to
kill in our name (or lead others
in killing) than if he wants to
be peaceful. Nonchalant C-O's
are jailed or converted to sol
diers, too, too, the army should
reject those casual soldiers who
cannot demonstrate a commit
ment to the logic of killing.
Membership in these groups

at Stanford often involves a sal
ary or scholarship money, thus
it is possible that some appli
cants are self-seekers rather
than people of military charac
ter and conviction. Then too,
wearing uniforms, drilling, hav
ing meetings, parades, balls and
military sweethearts are activi
ties which obscure the issue of
killing.
I am serious. There are pres
ently 594 men involved in the
military science programs at
Stanford. They can't all be seri
ous. I suggest that this commu
nity demand of them what the
community at-large demands of
C-O's: a rigorous justification of
their position. Perhaps there are
those, indoctrinated from in
fancy with the strategies of the
cold-war ideologies, who plead
war as their destiny just as the
Quakers plead peace. We should,
too be fair, allow these people
to join the military if they hon
estly believe in a principle, or
supreme being, that recom
mends killing as in its interest.
Otherwise, the procedure would
be exactly as the same as it is
for C-O's: of those who claim
joining the military as a con
scious decision, we must demand
to know their credo.

Cardinals' Board has again
demonstrated that it is some
thing left over from the Stan

tabulate the votes for Wendy
G. Wonka ignores the majority
of the student body which is
just plain tired of Cardinals'
Board games.
We understand that a small,
but random sample of ballots
showed that Wendy tied with
the announced winner. Cardi
nals' Board would be well-ad
vised to turn over the rest of the

Jim Garrigus is grossly misin
formed in interpreting Black
Power and in advising black
people to "try acting like Ameri
can citizens." For three hundred
years black men have tried to
vote like American citizens, earn
a living like American citizens,
become educated like American
citizens, enjoy public facilities
like American citizens, and pur
sue life, liberty, and happiness
like American citizens. Black
men have been enslaved, pillag
ed, lynched, shot, brutalized, our
women raped, our infants bomb
ed in Southern churches UN
LIKE American citizens. Where

lies this thing called nonvio
lence?
Black Power, as defined by
black people, entails self-deter
mination, self-respect, and self
defense for black people. All
three of these ideas. If self-de
fense forces us to violence —
then, in the American way —
Roll 'em, Pete!!
Advice to blacks does not re
quire vast amounts of courage.
If those whites who profess
ever-so-loudly to be liberal are
genuinely and sufficiently con
cerned to act in behalf of human
relationships, do they have the
fortitude to oust the Klan and
the crackers and make Black
Power no longer exigent?

• Election Problems
Editor, The Daily;
I would like to correct yes
terday's election article by Steve

Gruber. He was in error on two
important points.
1) First, the Homecoming
Queen sponsors did not com
plain. Rather, I complained con
cerning the tardiness of their
preparations. In order to pro
vide the Queen candidates with
more exposure before the vot
ers, I extended the election.
2) Secondly, the essence of
the "OFF!" group's complaint is
obscured in Mr. Gruber's article.
The question in "OFF!" leader
Janet Howell's mind was what
week her referendum election
was to be held. Mr. Gruber cor
rectly states that Miss Howell
was confused concerning elec
tion dates. But he incorrectly
implies that this confusion was
due to starting the election Mon
day, October 31 rather than
Tuesday, November 1.
BILL BERRY
Elections Commissioner
Editor, The Dally:
As a student member of the
recently-established General
Studies sub-committee on over
seas campuses, I would like to
clarify a few misconceptions con
cerning the sub-committee's
functions as expressed in your
editorial of October 31.
Contrary to your Indication,
the Martindale Report always
has been and will remain the
first consideration of the sub
committee. The faculty and stu
dent members, as well as Dr.
Walker, are committed to review
fully the report's recommenda
tions concerning curriculum flex
ibility, community relations, civi
lization courses, etc. I think I
can speak for the other student
members in guaranteeing that
this will be the case.
The very establishment of the
sub-committee following last
spring's final draft of the Mar
tindale Report attests to the will
ingness of the students to per
sist and of the faculty and ad
ministration to cooperate in
achieving the basic recommenda
tions of the report: the establish
ment of permanent and continu
ing student advice and influence
on the overseas campuses pro
gram. As a first step, student
recommendations are being in
corporated into the agenda of
this month's directors' meeting
in Florence.
I would like to emphasize also
that the Martindale Report and
even the new sub-committee

should not be and definitely will
not be the final solution to stu
dent involvement in the overseas
campuses program. The sub
committee itself will be able to
recommend changes dealing with
aspect of the academic program.
Furthermore, the Overseas Cam
puses Board is presently over
hauling the orientation proced
ures of both the pre-application
and pre-departure segments of
the program. I believe that the
Board can also extend itself, as
Prof. Hastorf suggests, into
areas of particular concern for
each campus.
The real test of the effective
ness of these new positions and
new areas of influence will come
over time—hopefully not the
time set by the more permanent
members of this community, but
rather the more limited time of
the student and more particu
larly of the junior and senior
student members of the sub
committee. In Marcia Cohn's
words, we want to "get hop
ping." We will not be satisfied
with occasional advice at the
asking of the administration; we
intend to offer and we have been
encouraged to offer definite pro
posals to improve the program
and new ways to envision the
aims of the program. We may
not intend the "militant" reap
praisal that Dr. Walker has
spoken of, but we do intend a
thorough one. The recent polari
zation of positions of "student"
and "administrator," while con
taining a large amount of truth

be peaceful. Nonchalant C-O's
are jailed or converted to sol
diers, too, too, the army should
reject those casual soldiers who
cannot demonstrate a commit
ment to the logic of killing.
Membership in these groups

at Stanford often involves a sal
ary or scholarship money, thus
it is possible that some appli
cants are self-seekers rather
than people of military charac
ter and conviction. Then too,
wearing uniforms, drilling, hav
ing meetings, parades, balls and
military sweethearts are activi
ties which obscure the issue of
killing.
I am serious. There are pres
ently 594 men involved in the
military science programs at
Stanford. They can't all be seri
ous. I suggest that this commu
nity demand of them what the
community at-large demands of
C-O's: a rigorous justification of
their position. Perhaps there are
those, indoctrinated from in
fancy with the strategies of the
cold-war ideologies, who plead
war as their destiny just as the
Quakers plead peace. We should,
too be fair, allow these people
to join the military if they hon
estly believe in a principle, or
supreme being, that recom
mends killing as in its interest.
Otherwise, the procedure would
be exactly as the same as it is
for C-O's: of those who claim
joining the military as a con
scious decision, we must demand
to know their credo.

Cardinals' Board has again

• 300 Year Trial
Editor, The Daily;
Jim Garrigus is grossly misin
formed in interpreting Black
Power and in advising black
people to "try acting like Ameri
can citizens." For three hundred
years black men have tried to
vote like American citizens, earn
a living like American citizens,
become educated like American
citizens, enjoy public facilities
like American citizens, and pur
sue life, liberty, and happiness
like American citizens. Black
men have been enslaved, pillag
ed, lynched, shot, brutalized, our
women raped, our infants bomb
ed in Southern churches UN
LIKE American citizens. Where

lies this thing called nonvio
lence?
Black Power, as defined by
black people, entails self-deter
mination, self-respect, and self
defense for black people. All
three of these ideas. If self-de
fense forces us to violence —
then, in the American way —
Roll 'em, Pete!!
Advice to blacks does not re
quire vast amounts of courage.
If those whites who profess
ever-so-loudly to be liberal are
genuinely and sufficiently con
cerned to act in behalf of human
relationships, do they have the
fortitude to oust the Klan and
the crackers and make Black
Power no longer exigent?

• Election Problems
Editor, The Daily;
I would like to correct yes
terday's election article by Steve

Gruber. He was in error on two
important points.
1) First, the Homecoming
Queen sponsors did not com
plain. Rather, I complained con
cerning the tardiness of their
preparations. In order to pro
vide the Queen candidates with
more exposure before the vot
ers, I extended the election.
2) Secondly, the essence of
the "OFF!" group's complaint is
obscured in Mr. Gruber's article.
The question in "OFF!" leader
Janet Howell's mind was what
week her referendum election
was to be held. Mr. Gruber cor
rectly states that Miss Howell
was confused concerning elec
tion dates. But he incorrectly
implies that this confusion was
due to starting the election Mon
day, October 31 rather than
Tuesday, November 1.
BILL BERRY
Elections Commissioner
Editor, The Dally:
As a student member of the
recently-established General
Studies sub-committee on over
seas campuses, I would like to
clarify a few misconceptions con
cerning the sub-committee's
functions as expressed in your
editorial of October 31.
Contrary to your Indication,
the Martindale Report always
has been and will remain the
first consideration of the sub
committee. The faculty and stu
dent members, as well as Dr.
Walker, are committed to review
fully the report's recommenda
tions concerning curriculum flex
ibility, community relations, civi
lization courses, etc. I think I
can speak for the other student
members in guaranteeing that
this will be the case.
The very establishment of the
sub-committee following last
spring's final draft of the Mar
tindale Report attests to the will
ingness of the students to per
sist and of the faculty and ad
ministration to cooperate in
achieving the basic recommenda
tions of the report: the establish
ment of permanent and continu
ing student advice and influence
on the overseas campuses pro
gram. As a first step, student
recommendations are being in
corporated into the agenda of
this month's directors' meeting
in Florence.
I would like to emphasize also
that the Martindale Report and
even the new sub-committee

should not be and definitely will
not be the final solution to stu
dent involvement in the overseas
campuses program. The sub
committee itself will be able to
recommend changes dealing with
aspect of the academic program.
Furthermore, the Overseas Cam
puses Board is presently over
hauling the orientation proced
ures of both the pre-application
and pre-departure segments of
the program. I believe that the
Board can also extend itself, as
Prof. Hastorf suggests, into
areas of particular concern for
each campus.
The real test of the effective
ness of these new positions and
new areas of influence will come
over time—hopefully not the
time set by the more permanent
members of this community, but
rather the more limited time of
the student and more particu
larly of the junior and senior
student members of the sub
committee. In Marcia Cohn's
words, we want to "get hop
ping." We will not be satisfied
with occasional advice at the
asking of the administration; we
intend to offer and we have been
encouraged to offer definite pro
posals to improve the program
and new ways to envision the
aims of the program. We may
not intend the "militant" reap
praisal that Dr. Walker has
spoken of, but we do intend a
thorough one. The recent polari
zation of positions of "student"
and "administrator," while con
taining a large amount of truth
and stimulating critical discus
sions, will tend only to result in
a similar polarization of atti
tudes: that is, of aggressiveness
and stubbornness. The discus
sion should move away from
personalities and into the ultiza
tion and expansion of the re
cently created and strengthened
areas of student power.

• A Fair Share
Editor, The Daily:
I am saddened by the letter in
yesterday's Daily from Mrs.
Luke Kabat, accusing Dean
Rosenzweig and Dr. Hertzenberg
of going "back on their word"
and acting "in bad faith." I would
like It recorded that I too, along
with Dean Rosenzweig and Dr.
Hertzenberg, share responsibil
ity for the promises made to Mrs.

Kabat. The three of us discussed
the matter with her on a Satur
day morning and reached agree
ment. By the following Monday
she had been persuaded that we
could not be trusted to keep our
promises.
I believe that SUCCEED will
be a significant catalyst in Stan
ford's ongoing effort to provide
education for members of low
income minority groups, and if
"bad faith" is to be imputed to
those with this desire, Dean
Rosenzweig and Dr. Hertzenberg
are people with whom I am
proud to share that allegation.

• Conscious Conscript
Editor, The Dally;
As a self-realized (as opposed to
religious indoctrinated) Consci
entious Objector, I am often ask
ed to give justification for such
a position. Society, in the person
of the woman at my draft board,
requires of me a fairly rigorous
effort to rationalize my opposi
tion to killing and war. Even
then, no one believes me until
I say I'll go to jail rather than
serve in the army. And if I go
to jail, eventually becoming an
"ex-convict," I thereby reinforce
the community's suspicion that
I am no good.
Thhs bitter rite is not peculiar
to me: but it is peculiar to
C-O's. I propose that we at Stan
ford somersault the Selective
Service approach by applying
these same methods to those
who want to joint ROTC, NRO
TC, Air Science, or enlist. This
seems especially worthwhile as
it is surely more important that
we be convinced of someone's
sincerity before we allow him to
kill in our name (or lead others
in killing) than if he wants to
be peaceful. Nonchalant C-O's
are jailed or converted to sol

• Election Problems
Editor, The Daily;
I would like to correct yes
terday's election article by Steve

Gruber. He was in error on two
important points.
1) First, the Homecoming
Queen sponsors did not com
plain. Rather, I complained con
cerning the tardiness of their
preparations. In order to pro
vide the Queen candidates with
more exposure before the vot
ers, I extended the election.
2) Secondly, the essence of
the "OFF!" group's complaint is
obscured in Mr. Gruber's article.
The question in "OFF!" leader
Janet Howell's mind was what
week her referendum election
was to be held. Mr. Gruber cor
rectly states that Miss Howell
was confused concerning elec
tion dates. But he incorrectly
implies that this confusion was
due to starting the election Mon
day, October 31 rather than
Tuesday, November 1.
BILL BERRY
Elections Commissioner
Editor, The Dally:
As a student member of the
recently-established General
Studies sub-committee on over
seas campuses, I would like to
clarify a few misconceptions con
cerning the sub-committee's
functions as expressed in your
editorial of October 31.
Contrary to your Indication,
the Martindale Report always
has been and will remain the
first consideration of the sub
committee. The faculty and stu
dent members, as well as Dr.
Walker, are committed to review
fully the report's recommenda
tions concerning curriculum flex
ibility, community relations, civi
lization courses, etc. I think I
can speak for the other student
members in guaranteeing that
this will be the case.
The very establishment of the
sub-committee following last
spring's final draft of the Mar
tindale Report attests to the will
ingness of the students to per
sist and of the faculty and ad
ministration to cooperate in
achieving the basic recommenda
tions of the report: the establish
ment of permanent and continu
ing student advice and influence
on the overseas campuses pro
gram. As a first step, student
recommendations are being in
corporated into the agenda of
this month's directors' meeting
in Florence.
I would like to emphasize also
that the Martindale Report and
even the new sub-committee

should not be and definitely will
not be the final solution to stu
dent involvement in the overseas
campuses program. The sub
committee itself will be able to
recommend changes dealing with
aspect of the academic program.
Furthermore, the Overseas Cam
puses Board is presently over
hauling the orientation proced
ures of both the pre-application
and pre-departure segments of
the program. I believe that the
Board can also extend itself, as
Prof. Hastorf suggests, into
areas of particular concern for
each campus.
The real test of the effective
ness of these new positions and
new areas of influence will come
over time—hopefully not the
time set by the more permanent
members of this community, but
rather the more limited time of
the student and more particu
larly of the junior and senior
student members of the sub
committee. In Marcia Cohn's
words, we want to "get hop
ping." We will not be satisfied
with occasional advice at the
asking of the administration; we
intend to offer and we have been
encouraged to offer definite pro
posals to improve the program
and new ways to envision the
aims of the program. We may
not intend the "militant" reap
praisal that Dr. Walker has
spoken of, but we do intend a
thorough one. The recent polari
zation of positions of "student"
and "administrator," while con
taining a large amount of truth
and stimulating critical discus
sions, will tend only to result in
a similar polarization of atti
tudes: that is, of aggressiveness
and stubbornness. The discus
sion should move away from
personalities and into the ultiza
tion and expansion of the re
cently created and strengthened
areas of student power.

• A Fair Share
Editor, The Daily:
I am saddened by the letter in
yesterday's Daily from Mrs.
Luke Kabat, accusing Dean
Rosenzweig and Dr. Hertzenberg
of going "back on their word"
and acting "in bad faith." I would
like It recorded that I too, along
with Dean Rosenzweig and Dr.
Hertzenberg, share responsibil
ity for the promises made to Mrs.

Kabat. The three of us discussed
the matter with her on a Satur
day morning and reached agree
ment. By the following Monday
she had been persuaded that we
could not be trusted to keep our
promises.
I believe that SUCCEED will
be a significant catalyst in Stan
ford's ongoing effort to provide
education for members of low
income minority groups, and if
"bad faith" is to be imputed to
those with this desire, Dean
Rosenzweig and Dr. Hertzenberg
are people with whom I am
proud to share that allegation.

• Conscious Conscript
Editor, The Dally;
As a self-realized (as opposed to
religious indoctrinated) Consci
entious Objector, I am often ask
ed to give justification for such
a position. Society, in the person
of the woman at my draft board,
requires of me a fairly rigorous
effort to rationalize my opposi
tion to killing and war. Even
then, no one believes me until
I say I'll go to jail rather than
serve in the army. And if I go
to jail, eventually becoming an
"ex-convict," I thereby reinforce
the community's suspicion that
I am no good.
Thhs bitter rite is not peculiar
to me: but it is peculiar to
C-O's. I propose that we at Stan
ford somersault the Selective
Service approach by applying
these same methods to those
who want to joint ROTC, NRO
TC, Air Science, or enlist. This
seems especially worthwhile as
it is surely more important that
we be convinced of someone's
sincerity before we allow him to
kill in our name (or lead others
in killing) than if he wants to
be peaceful. Nonchalant C-O's
are jailed or converted to sol
diers, too, too, the army should
reject those casual soldiers who
cannot demonstrate a commit
ment to the logic of killing.
Membership in these groups

at Stanford often involves a sal
ary or scholarship money, thus
it is possible that some appli
cants are self-seekers rather
than people of military charac
ter and conviction. Then too,
wearing uniforms, drilling, hav
ing meetings, parades, balls and
military sweethearts are activi
ties which obscure the issue of
killing.
I am serious. There are pres
ently 594 men involved in the
military science programs at
Stanford. They can't all be seri
ous. I suggest that this commu
nity demand of them what the
community at-large demands of
C-O's: a rigorous justification of
their position. Perhaps there are
those, indoctrinated from in
fancy with the strategies of the
cold-war ideologies, who plead
war as their destiny just as the
Quakers plead peace. We should,
too be fair, allow these people
to join the military if they hon
estly believe in a principle, or
supreme being, that recom
mends killing as in its interest.
Otherwise, the procedure would
be exactly as the same as it is
for C-O's: of those who claim
joining the military as a con
scious decision, we must demand
to know their credo.

Editor, The Daily:
Cardinals' Board has again
demonstrated that it is some
thing left over from the Stan

tabulate the votes for Wendy
G. Wonka ignores the majority
of the student body which is
just plain tired of Cardinals'

We understand that a small,

showed that Wendy tied with
the announced winner. Cardi

spring's final draft of the Mar
tindale Report attests to the will
ingness of the students to per
sist and of the faculty and ad
ministration to cooperate in
achieving the basic recommenda
tions of the report: the establish
ment of permanent and continu
ing student advice and influence
on the overseas campuses pro
gram. As a first step, student
recommendations are being in
corporated into the agenda of
this month's directors' meeting
in Florence.
I would like to emphasize also
that the Martindale Report and
even the new sub-committee

should not be and definitely will
not be the final solution to stu
dent involvement in the overseas
campuses program. The sub
committee itself will be able to
recommend changes dealing with
aspect of the academic program.
Furthermore, the Overseas Cam
puses Board is presently over
hauling the orientation proced
ures of both the pre-application
and pre-departure segments of
the program. I believe that the
Board can also extend itself, as
Prof. Hastorf suggests, into
areas of particular concern for
each campus.
The real test of the effective
ness of these new positions and
new areas of influence will come
over time—hopefully not the
time set by the more permanent
members of this community, but
rather the more limited time of
the student and more particu
larly of the junior and senior
student members of the sub
committee. In Marcia Cohn's
words, we want to "get hop
ping." We will not be satisfied
with occasional advice at the
asking of the administration; we
intend to offer and we have been
encouraged to offer definite pro
posals to improve the program
and new ways to envision the
aims of the program. We may
not intend the "militant" reap
praisal that Dr. Walker has
spoken of, but we do intend a
thorough one. The recent polari
zation of positions of "student"
and "administrator," while con
taining a large amount of truth
and stimulating critical discus
sions, will tend only to result in
a similar polarization of atti
tudes: that is, of aggressiveness
and stubbornness. The discus
sion should move away from
personalities and into the ultiza
tion and expansion of the re
cently created and strengthened
areas of student power.

• A Fair Share
Editor, The Daily:
I am saddened by the letter in
yesterday's Daily from Mrs.
Luke Kabat, accusing Dean
Rosenzweig and Dr. Hertzenberg
of going "back on their word"
and acting "in bad faith." I would
like It recorded that I too, along
with Dean Rosenzweig and Dr.
Hertzenberg, share responsibil
ity for the promises made to Mrs.

Kabat. The three of us discussed
the matter with her on a Satur
day morning and reached agree
ment. By the following Monday
she had been persuaded that we
could not be trusted to keep our
promises.
I believe that SUCCEED will
be a significant catalyst in Stan
ford's ongoing effort to provide
education for members of low
income minority groups, and if
"bad faith" is to be imputed to
those with this desire, Dean
Rosenzweig and Dr. Hertzenberg
are people with whom I am
proud to share that allegation.

• Conscious Conscript
Editor, The Dally;
As a self-realized (as opposed to
religious indoctrinated) Consci
entious Objector, I am often ask
ed to give justification for such
a position. Society, in the person
of the woman at my draft board,
requires of me a fairly rigorous
effort to rationalize my opposi
tion to killing and war. Even
then, no one believes me until
I say I'll go to jail rather than
serve in the army. And if I go
to jail, eventually becoming an
"ex-convict," I thereby reinforce
the community's suspicion that
I am no good.
Thhs bitter rite is not peculiar
to me: but it is peculiar to
C-O's. I propose that we at Stan
ford somersault the Selective
Service approach by applying
these same methods to those
who want to joint ROTC, NRO
TC, Air Science, or enlist. This
seems especially worthwhile as
it is surely more important that
we be convinced of someone's
sincerity before we allow him to
kill in our name (or lead others
in killing) than if he wants to
be peaceful. Nonchalant C-O's
are jailed or converted to sol
diers, too, too, the army should
reject those casual soldiers who
cannot demonstrate a commit
ment to the logic of killing.
Membership in these groups

at Stanford often involves a sal
ary or scholarship money, thus
it is possible that some appli
cants are self-seekers rather
than people of military charac
ter and conviction. Then too,
wearing uniforms, drilling, hav
ing meetings, parades, balls and
military sweethearts are activi
ties which obscure the issue of
killing.
I am serious. There are pres
ently 594 men involved in the
military science programs at
Stanford. They can't all be seri
ous. I suggest that this commu
nity demand of them what the
community at-large demands of
C-O's: a rigorous justification of
their position. Perhaps there are
those, indoctrinated from in
fancy with the strategies of the
cold-war ideologies, who plead
war as their destiny just as the
Quakers plead peace. We should,
too be fair, allow these people
to join the military if they hon
estly believe in a principle, or
supreme being, that recom
mends killing as in its interest.
Otherwise, the procedure would
be exactly as the same as it is
for C-O's: of those who claim
joining the military as a con
scious decision, we must demand
to know their credo.

• Royal Comment
Editor, The Daily:
Cardinals' Board has again
demonstrated that it is some
thing left over from the Stan
ford of the 19305. Failure to
tabulate the votes for Wendy
G. Wonka ignores the majority
of the student body which is
just plain tired of Cardinals'
Board games.
We understand that a small,
but random sample of ballots
showed that Wendy tied with
the announced winner. Cardi
nals' Board would be well-ad
vised to turn over the rest of the
ballots if they want student body
support in the future.
Actually, if Cardinals Board
wishes to suppress the informa

tion, it just makes it easier to
cut the budget for this group
when it comes before LASSU
Spring quarter.

• 300 Year Trial
Editor, The Daily;
Jim Garrigus is grossly misin
formed in interpreting Black
Power and in advising black
people to "try acting like Ameri
can citizens." For three hundred
years black men have tried to
vote like American citizens, earn
a living like American citizens,
become educated like American
citizens, enjoy public facilities
like American citizens, and pur
sue life, liberty, and happiness
like American citizens. Black
men have been enslaved, pillag
ed, lynched, shot, brutalized, our
women raped, our infants bomb
ed in Southern churches UN
LIKE American citizens. Where

lies this thing called nonvio
lence?
Black Power, as defined by
black people, entails self-deter
mination, self-respect, and self
defense for black people. All
three of these ideas. If self-de
fense forces us to violence —
then, in the American way —
Roll 'em, Pete!!
Advice to blacks does not re
quire vast amounts of courage.
If those whites who profess
ever-so-loudly to be liberal are
genuinely and sufficiently con
cerned to act in behalf of human
relationships, do they have the
fortitude to oust the Klan and
the crackers and make Black
Power no longer exigent?

• Election Problems
Editor, The Daily;
I would like to correct yes
terday's election article by Steve

Gruber. He was in error on two
important points.
1) First, the Homecoming
Queen sponsors did not com
plain. Rather, I complained con
cerning the tardiness of their
preparations. In order to pro
vide the Queen candidates with
more exposure before the vot
ers, I extended the election.
2) Secondly, the essence of
the "OFF!" group's complaint is
obscured in Mr. Gruber's article.
The question in "OFF!" leader
Janet Howell's mind was what
week her referendum election
was to be held. Mr. Gruber cor
rectly states that Miss Howell
was confused concerning elec
tion dates. But he incorrectly
implies that this confusion was
due to starting the election Mon
day, October 31 rather than
Tuesday, November 1.
BILL BERRY
Elections Commissioner
Editor, The Dally:
As a student member of the
recently-established General
Studies sub-committee on over
seas campuses, I would like to
clarify a few misconceptions con
cerning the sub-committee's
functions as expressed in your
editorial of October 31.
Contrary to your Indication,
the Martindale Report always
has been and will remain the
first consideration of the sub
committee. The faculty and stu
dent members, as well as Dr.
Walker, are committed to review
fully the report's recommenda
tions concerning curriculum flex
ibility, community relations, civi
lization courses, etc. I think I
can speak for the other student
members in guaranteeing that
this will be the case.
The very establishment of the
sub-committee following last
spring's final draft of the Mar
tindale Report attests to the will
ingness of the students to per
sist and of the faculty and ad
