Five hundred students and 50 facul
ty couples took part in the program
last year. Davis said that there was
difficulty in setting up last year's sym
posium, although all of the problems
were eventually solved. He also re
ported that it was "a shock to find
that 900 students had signed up this
year, but the symposium committee
will be able to handle everybody.

Just another Dinkelspiel seminar.
After the speeches are finished, the
participants and the audience will get

900 Students
Approximately 900 students have
already signed up for the symposium,
according to Nick Davis, a member of
the Student-Faculty Board, the spon
soring group. The signup lists are
still open, he added.

After the meeting in Dinkelspiel,
students will divide into groups of 10
or 12 and have dinner at a faculty
member's home. A discussion will fol
low dinner and students are free to
decide if they want to hold other
meetings.
According to Davis, the purpose of
the Year of Change "is to try to get
the people taking part to communicate
with and understand each other."
