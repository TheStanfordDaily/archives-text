## Harris Sandwich: Stale System And Melba Toast Student Body 
### Tim Haight 
"Advertising slogans which con
you into thinking you're the
one who can do what's never
been done, who can win whafs
never been won, meanwhile out
side life goes all around you."
—Bob Dylan
Committees, and committees,
and committees creep on their
petty pace. They soak up the Is
sues and disgorge the need for
statistics, moderation, and an
eye to the trustees. OK, so it's
life and life only, but the tragedy
is that Dave Harris' administra
tion is getting sucked into it.
Last spring Harris talked
about students on the board of
trustees, LSD at the health ser
vice, and the abolition of all
grades and general studies re
quirements, to mention only a
few issues. This year, he's talk
ing about a pass-fall freshman
year, repealing the science re
quirement, and a coffee house.
Polticis As Art
What happened? Perhaps pol
itics is the art of the possible.
Perhaps goals are influenced by
what a politician thinks he can
get. Dave has seen that there is
a possibility for limited change
without confrontation, and has
opted for it in his action pro
grams.
Why did he do this? Dave
Harris hasn't changed. He still
speaks of rejecting the Univer
sity and of Vietnam and the
draft. But he is sandwiched be

tween a polite, cooperative but
incredibly slow-thinking and
slower-acting University struc
ture and a student body that
does not seem to mean what it
said last spring.
Harris often says that if the
student body voted for him so
that they could "have an inter
esting year," they made a mis
take. "I wish that if all they
wanted was an entertainer,
they'd say so," Dave says. "That
way I'd not only know my role,
but would ask for a higher sal
ary. In our society, entertainers
are much better paid."
Rally Behind
Of course, educational issues
don't immediately seem like the
kind of things that students can
rally behind and demonstrate
about. And demonstrations of
any kind are declining all over
the country. But perhaps the
real problem is that we have
simply narrowed our efforts
down to the wrong things.
The trustees are still there.
Try negotiating anything with
administrators and the all-pow
erful board of nay-sayers comes
into the conversation. The mal
aise is still there, and perhaps
the lack of enthusiasm for spe
cific proposals shows that the
answers have not yet been ar
ticulated.
The answers probably lie in
the gulf between the impossible
vague general complaints about

how this University is not turn
ing out human beings capable of
mastering their society and the
all - too - possible amendments
that we are now running
through the committees.
Cassandra-like
But Dave Harris isn't going
to find these answers by him
self. There is more imagination
and effort needed than any one
man can be expected to put out.
Right now, Harris speaks Cas
sandra-like to students and then
they go back to their books.
Or he rails at administrators
who say, "Well yes, an experi
mental prototype program might
be worked out if some students
did the basic spadework and
worked up a recommendation."
To sum all this up in a simple
imperative: If new and exciting
answers to basic questions are
not offered by students and fac
ulty who have to date remained
silent, the whole student initia
tive in educational change is
going to fall apart.
We have the potential to keep
going a movement of student re
sponsibility and creativity that
will make the education here
something worthy of the pro
paganda the University puts out
about itself. But an elected char
ismatic figure will not be a sup
erhero unless he has the power
of ideas and commitment that
only dedicated supporters can
give him.

tion is getting sucked into it.
Last spring Harris talked
about students on the board of
trustees, LSD at the health ser
vice, and the abolition of all
grades and general studies re
quirements, to mention only a
few issues. This year, he's talk
ing about a pass-fall freshman
year, repealing the science re
quirement, and a coffee house.
Polticis As Art
What happened? Perhaps pol
itics is the art of the possible.
Perhaps goals are influenced by
what a politician thinks he can
get. Dave has seen that there is
a possibility for limited change
without confrontation, and has
opted for it in his action pro
grams.
Why did he do this? Dave
Harris hasn't changed. He still
speaks of rejecting the Univer
sity and of Vietnam and the
draft. But he is sandwiched be

tween a polite, cooperative but
incredibly slow-thinking and
slower-acting University struc
ture and a student body that
does not seem to mean what it
said last spring.
Harris often says that if the
student body voted for him so
that they could "have an inter
esting year," they made a mis
take. "I wish that if all they
wanted was an entertainer,
they'd say so," Dave says. "That
way I'd not only know my role,
but would ask for a higher sal
ary. In our society, entertainers
are much better paid."
Rally Behind
Of course, educational issues
don't immediately seem like the
kind of things that students can
rally behind and demonstrate
about. And demonstrations of
any kind are declining all over
the country. But perhaps the
real problem is that we have
simply narrowed our efforts
down to the wrong things.
The trustees are still there.
Try negotiating anything with
administrators and the all-pow
erful board of nay-sayers comes
into the conversation. The mal
aise is still there, and perhaps
the lack of enthusiasm for spe
cific proposals shows that the
answers have not yet been ar
ticulated.
The answers probably lie in
the gulf between the impossible
vague general complaints about

how this University is not turn
ing out human beings capable of
mastering their society and the
all - too - possible amendments
that we are now running
through the committees.
Cassandra-like
But Dave Harris isn't going
to find these answers by him
self. There is more imagination
and effort needed than any one
man can be expected to put out.
Right now, Harris speaks Cas
sandra-like to students and then
they go back to their books.
Or he rails at administrators
who say, "Well yes, an experi
mental prototype program might
be worked out if some students
did the basic spadework and
worked up a recommendation."
To sum all this up in a simple
imperative: If new and exciting
answers to basic questions are
not offered by students and fac
ulty who have to date remained
silent, the whole student initia
tive in educational change is
going to fall apart.
We have the potential to keep
going a movement of student re
sponsibility and creativity that
will make the education here
something worthy of the pro
paganda the University puts out
about itself. But an elected char
ismatic figure will not be a sup
erhero unless he has the power
of ideas and commitment that
only dedicated supporters can
give him.

Committees, and committees,
and committees creep on their
petty pace. They soak up the Is
sues and disgorge the need for
statistics, moderation, and an
eye to the trustees. OK, so it's
life and life only, but the tragedy
is that Dave Harris' administra
