# College Behaviorial Trends
## 
### LARRY PISCHOFF 
Ever since I fell off a 40-foot
cliff people have been asking
me about experience.
"You fell off a 40-foot cliff:
what about experience?" is a
typical remark.
Being unaccustomed as I am
to alienation and the existential
starts of the Big U, such ques
tions confused and delighted me.
My answers at first—"ln some
ways I like it and in some ways
I don't." "The whole is more
than the sum of its parts." "You
can take a boy out of the coun
try but you can't make him
drink."—l found unsatisfactory.
So naturally for advice I
stumbled over to a visiting lec
turer in Sociology. His intro
ductory remarks were probing.
"You must not take what I say
to you as dogmai. .
"I understand."
". . . since I am not on the
permanent faculty. However, I
can assure you that experience
is not here to stay."
"No?"
"A passing fad," He lit his
pipe. "Basically you've got to un

derstand collegiate behavioral
trends. One year sex is a big
thing. The next year it's swal
lowing goldfish. Then maybe,
sex will be the fad for awhile.
One year it's phone booths; the
next it's sex. I can show you
graphs . .
"No thanks. I'd just like to
know why experience . .
"Ah, experience!" he ex
claimed, smoothing the elbow
patches on his tweed jacket.
"Experience is IN (as any vec
tor analysis will show) because
of the particular sociological
forces that have converged this
year: the war, the draft board,
baseball scandals, existential
ism . .
"And these external condi
tions ..."
Having faced the inner nature
of the problem, thereby tran
scending it, I felt ready to han
dle experiential questions.
My most interesting case study
concerns a jolly fellow, an or
ganizer, well-known and well
liked. He peeped into my com
bination bedroom-study one eve
ning.

"Experience!" I levelled my
eyes at him.
"Yes! Why, yes, I think that's
it."
"I thought so. I think, then,
that I can help you." I relit my
pipe. "About experience we must
remember that there are three
things. There are always three
things."
"What are they?"
"I was just getting to that.
First, denial of traditional de
lusions. Next, standing up to
our inner nothingness. Third ..."
I relit my pipe. "The third thing
..My memory faltered. "There
are always three things," I mut
tered.
He started to offer the third
thing. "No," I said, 'TO get it."
I put away my pipe and lit a
cigarette.
"The third thing is . . . the
Artichoke . .
"The Artichoke?"
. . as a symbol of good. For
. . (I pointed my cigarette
at him for emphasis) "the arti
choke Is good!"
He pondered. "That's true. But
tell me this: what is the reason

that we alienated college stu
dents can't experience?"
"Sunglasses!" I felt to see if
my beard was coming in. "Sun
glasses. 'Appease the masses
with sunglasses.' "
"Could you explain . . ." he
ventured.
"It's self-explanatory, really,
but I'll . . ."
"No, it's not."
. . I'll proceed neverthe
less . . ."
"Answer me this," he contin
ued. "Does experience consist
of intense involvement, detached
identification, or vivid fantasis
ing?"
I paused a moment to reflect.
"It may be the first aforemen
tioned and none of the latter
two. It may be the middle one
and none of the ends. It may
be the last one that you men
tioned. It may be all three . . .
and another one that you never
mentioned. Or any two." I point
ed my glasses for emphasis:
"But basically—you want a good
time, you start a fad." I leaned
forward. "I can tell you about
some panty raids . .."

"And these external condi

Having faced the inner nature
of the problem, thereby tran
scending it, I felt ready to han
dle experiential questions.
My most interesting case study
concerns a jolly fellow, an or
ganizer, well-known and well
liked. He peeped into my com
bination bedroom-study one eve
ning.

"Experience!" I levelled my
eyes at him.
"Yes! Why, yes, I think that's
it."
"I thought so. I think, then,
that I can help you." I relit my
pipe. "About experience we must
remember that there are three
things. There are always three
things."
"What are they?"
"I was just getting to that.
First, denial of traditional de
lusions. Next, standing up to
our inner nothingness. Third ..."
I relit my pipe. "The third thing
..My memory faltered. "There
are always three things," I mut
tered.
He started to offer the third
thing. "No," I said, 'TO get it."
I put away my pipe and lit a
cigarette.
"The third thing is . . . the
Artichoke . .
"The Artichoke?"
. . as a symbol of good. For
. . (I pointed my cigarette
at him for emphasis) "the arti
choke Is good!"
He pondered. "That's true. But
tell me this: what is the reason

that we alienated college stu
dents can't experience?"
"Sunglasses!" I felt to see if
my beard was coming in. "Sun
glasses. 'Appease the masses
with sunglasses.' "
"Could you explain . . ." he
ventured.
"It's self-explanatory, really,
but I'll . . ."
"No, it's not."
. . I'll proceed neverthe
less . . ."
"Answer me this," he contin
ued. "Does experience consist
of intense involvement, detached
identification, or vivid fantasis
ing?"
I paused a moment to reflect.
"It may be the first aforemen
tioned and none of the latter
two. It may be the middle one
and none of the ends. It may
be the last one that you men
tioned. It may be all three . . .
and another one that you never
mentioned. Or any two." I point
ed my glasses for emphasis:
"But basically—you want a good
time, you start a fad." I leaned
forward. "I can tell you about
some panty raids . .."
Ever since I fell off a 40-foot
cliff people have been asking
me about experience.
"You fell off a 40-foot cliff:
what about experience?" is a
typical remark.
Being unaccustomed as I am
to alienation and the existential
starts of the Big U, such ques
tions confused and delighted me.
My answers at first—"ln some
ways I like it and in some ways
I don't." "The whole is more
than the sum of its parts." "You
can take a boy out of the coun
try but you can't make him
drink."—l found unsatisfactory.
So naturally for advice I
stumbled over to a visiting lec
turer in Sociology. His intro
ductory remarks were probing.
"You must not take what I say
to you as dogmai. .
"I understand."
". . . since I am not on the
permanent faculty. However, I
can assure you that experience
is not here to stay."
"No?"
"A passing fad," He lit his
pipe. "Basically you've got to un

derstand collegiate behavioral
trends. One year sex is a big
thing. The next year it's swal
lowing goldfish. Then maybe,
sex will be the fad for awhile.
One year it's phone booths; the
next it's sex. I can show you
graphs . .
"No thanks. I'd just like to
know why experience . .
"Ah, experience!" he ex
claimed, smoothing the elbow
patches on his tweed jacket.
"Experience is IN (as any vec

of the particular sociological
forces that have converged this
year: the war, the draft board,
