## Alum Regrets Present More Than Heroic Past 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Since the election of Mr. David
Harris to the office of student
body President I have followed
the publicity given to him with
increasing dismay. The last blow
seems to me his recent speech
given to the University of Mich
igan students at Ann Arbor.
I am enclosing a partial but
fairly complete list of World
War II fatalities of former Stan
ford students. In his recent
speech Mr. Harris was highly
critical of our long-used selective
service system. I feel certain the
enclosed list would have been
much larger if we had not had
the draft well underway prior
to Pearl Harbor.
It is regrettable that such a
person could be elected to such
an important office as the one he
now holds, and I know that
many alumni are embarrassed
and ashamed to have this per
son representing Stanford Uni
versity.

• Quotable
Editor, The Daily;
The Daily reported last Tues
day a rather distorted view con
cerning the recent bicycle acci

dent on campus. The Daily
seems to be concerned about
what apparently happened and
not what really happened.
"She apparently failed to stop
at the intersection" and she
"was admitted ... with appar
ent multiple fractures and other
injuries" suggests that The
Daily is not really concerned
about being informative, but
only suggestive.
The fact was that Miss Mc-
Aleavey (not McAleavy as was
reported) did indeed fail to stop
at the intersection, but so did
the car that hit her, which fail
ed to give the right of way to a
truck which had reached the in
tersection first. Stanford police
should take note that the bicycle
safety problem is a two-fold one
that concerns both bicyclist and
motorist and that they might
try to insure that the motorists
are driving safelv too.
PETER FERRIS
• Apparently Confused
Editor, The Daily;
I want to point out that I was
misquoted in a front page article
on SCPV activities in yester
day's Daily. I did say that lnaf
leting soldiers is meaningful be
cause soldiers care about the
war, but I continued to say that
this is because they are being
forced to risk their lives in Viet
nam. Many soldiers are aware
that this is a war of self-interest
and is directed against the Viet
namese people themselves; but
the phrase "many soldiers are
aware" was replaced by "they
know" as if soldiers were hiding
what they know.
That is not so; soldiers who
know the truth usually say so,
but often justify the war on
other grounds such as "we have
to teach them a lesson"; them
meaning the world wide Com
munist menace.
The rest of the quote, which
was omitted in The Daily said:
that Ira Arlook and I hoped
that those who joined us in leaf
leting at the S.F. Airport would
be prepared to say "we won't
go to Vietnam, even if it means
jail" when asked where they
stand by the G.l.s. Anti-war ac
tivists must show a strong and
sincere commitment to their be
liefs if they are to make head
way with G.l.s because most of
the soldiers believe in the fierce
anti-communism which has been
drilled into them.

MARC SAPIR
Editor, The Daily:
Since the election of Mr. David
Harris to the office of student
body President I have followed
the publicity given to him with
increasing dismay. The last blow
seems to me his recent speech
given to the University of Mich
igan students at Ann Arbor.
I am enclosing a partial but
fairly complete list of World
War II fatalities of former Stan
ford students. In his recent
speech Mr. Harris was highly
critical of our long-used selective
service system. I feel certain the
enclosed list would have been
much larger if we had not had
the draft well underway prior
to Pearl Harbor.
It is regrettable that such a
person could be elected to such
an important office as the one he
now holds, and I know that
many alumni are embarrassed
and ashamed to have this per
son representing Stanford Uni
versity.

• Quotable
Editor, The Daily;
The Daily reported last Tues
day a rather distorted view con
cerning the recent bicycle acci

dent on campus. The Daily
seems to be concerned about
what apparently happened and
not what really happened.
"She apparently failed to stop
at the intersection" and she
"was admitted ... with appar
ent multiple fractures and other
injuries" suggests that The
Daily is not really concerned
about being informative, but
only suggestive.
The fact was that Miss Mc-
Aleavey (not McAleavy as was
reported) did indeed fail to stop
at the intersection, but so did
the car that hit her, which fail
ed to give the right of way to a
truck which had reached the in
tersection first. Stanford police
should take note that the bicycle
safety problem is a two-fold one
that concerns both bicyclist and
motorist and that they might
try to insure that the motorists
are driving safelv too.
PETER FERRIS
• Apparently Confused
Editor, The Daily;
I want to point out that I was
misquoted in a front page article
on SCPV activities in yester
day's Daily. I did say that lnaf
leting soldiers is meaningful be
cause soldiers care about the
war, but I continued to say that
this is because they are being
forced to risk their lives in Viet
nam. Many soldiers are aware
that this is a war of self-interest
and is directed against the Viet
namese people themselves; but
the phrase "many soldiers are
aware" was replaced by "they
know" as if soldiers were hiding
what they know.
That is not so; soldiers who
know the truth usually say so,
but often justify the war on
other grounds such as "we have
to teach them a lesson"; them
meaning the world wide Com
munist menace.
The rest of the quote, which
was omitted in The Daily said:
