It was also noted that the proposal

eral Studies.
He also told of a recommendation
formulated by the subcommittee at

Forstenzer also warned the Legis

the SCPV has refused "because of the
subpoena the University received and
complied with to give the names of
organization members to the House
Committee on UnAmerican Activi
ties."
Harris elaborated on the SCPV con
troversy and said "The SCPV feels
student organizations should register
with ASSU. All facilities have been
denied to them this weekend." They
had planned the U6e of loudspeakers
in White Plaza and of Cubberley Au
ditorium.
In making his report, Harris com
mented on his approach if some of
his student nominations for Presi
dential Advisory Committees are
turned down. "For any of my recom
mendations not used, I'll consider that
to be a vacant seat. They will be
President Sterling's representatives,"
he said.
In other actions last night, LASSU

contingency fund to send two lIR
