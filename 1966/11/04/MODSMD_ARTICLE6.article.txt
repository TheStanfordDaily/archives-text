# Beye Wins Red Hot Prof Contest; Will Fly From Boston For Game
## 
### BEVERLY CORY 
With the final note of the carillon
chimes at 5:30 p.m. yesterday, the last
votes were accepted in the contest
for Red Hot Prof. Poll tenders packed
money and tally sheets to the ASSU
office, where one hour later they an
nounced the winner, Charles R. Beye,
Associate Professor of Classics at Bos
ton University.
Beye became familiar to Stanford
students as a professor in the Classics
department before leaving the campus
last spring. Friends at Stanford noti
fied him of his nomination and relay
ed progress reports on voting through
out the week.
Ke'th Boyle of the Art Department
talked to Beye last night after he had
learned the results. Beye was appar
ently bewildered by it all, but "de
liriously happy," Boyle reported. He
had been thinking at dinner "Would
n't it be nice if...but could not
quite believe it when a long distance
call announced his victory.
Beye made immediate plans to fly
to Stanford for the homecoming game
Saturday, where he will lead the half
time cheer expected of the winning
Red Hot Prof. He will be arriving
around noon today on TWA flight 79

and plans to remain at Stanford until
Sunday.
The closest Stanford contender was
Jack H. Friedenthal, professor of law,
but his 28,219 votes were nowhere
near Beye's final total of 43,245. In
third place with 21,230 votes was A. S.
Tetelman, Associate Professor of Ma-

and was more than 3500 votes ahead
terials Science and of Engineering
Mechanics.
242 For God
Dean of Chapel B. Davie Napier,
who led the contest most of the way

when the last figures went up on the
blackboard, fell to fourth place as
last-minute donations upped final
6Cores well beyond his 20,371.
Said Napier of his loss, "I'll try
harder." Commenting on the compara
tive totals of 242 for God and 83 for
Beelzebub, he said, "In my judgement,
the vote fails to recognize the appro
priate strength of either at Stanford."
Overseas Campuses Director Ro
bert Walker, doing well in competi
tion all week for the greatest number
of minus votes, took a huge closing
hour drive for a final tally of 442,
well below his nearest rival, LB J at -6.
Brown Over Reagan
In other results Governor Brown
edged out Reagan 200 to 144, while
the Great Pumpkin came on strong
at 140. Ho Chi Minh could rally only
25 votes.
The contest yielded around $1550
for the International Student Fund,
as compared to $900 collected last
year.
Donations are being accepted to
finance Beye's round-trip plane fare
from Boston and his expenses while
here. A collection table will be set up
at Engineering Corner between 11:30
and 1:30 today.

near Beye's final total of 43,245. In
third place with 21,230 votes was A. S.
Tetelman, Associate Professor of Ma-

and was more than 3500 votes ahead
terials Science and of Engineering
Mechanics.
242 For God
Dean of Chapel B. Davie Napier,
who led the contest most of the way

when the last figures went up on the
blackboard, fell to fourth place as
last-minute donations upped final
6Cores well beyond his 20,371.
Said Napier of his loss, "I'll try
harder." Commenting on the compara
tive totals of 242 for God and 83 for
Beelzebub, he said, "In my judgement,
the vote fails to recognize the appro
priate strength of either at Stanford."
Overseas Campuses Director Ro
bert Walker, doing well in competi
tion all week for the greatest number
of minus votes, took a huge closing
hour drive for a final tally of 442,
well below his nearest rival, LB J at -6.
Brown Over Reagan
In other results Governor Brown
edged out Reagan 200 to 144, while
the Great Pumpkin came on strong
at 140. Ho Chi Minh could rally only
25 votes.
The contest yielded around $1550
for the International Student Fund,
as compared to $900 collected last
year.
Donations are being accepted to
finance Beye's round-trip plane fare
from Boston and his expenses while
here. A collection table will be set up
at Engineering Corner between 11:30
and 1:30 today.


CHARLES BEYE
With the final note of the carillon
chimes at 5:30 p.m. yesterday, the last
votes were accepted in the contest
for Red Hot Prof. Poll tenders packed
money and tally sheets to the ASSU
office, where one hour later they an
nounced the winner, Charles R. Beye,
Associate Professor of Classics at Bos
ton University.
Beye became familiar to Stanford
students as a professor in the Classics
department before leaving the campus
last spring. Friends at Stanford noti
fied him of his nomination and relay
ed progress reports on voting through
out the week.
Ke'th Boyle of the Art Department
talked to Beye last night after he had
learned the results. Beye was appar
ently bewildered by it all, but "de
liriously happy," Boyle reported. He
had been thinking at dinner "Would
n't it be nice if...but could not
quite believe it when a long distance
call announced his victory.
Beye made immediate plans to fly
to Stanford for the homecoming game
Saturday, where he will lead the half
time cheer expected of the winning
Red Hot Prof. He will be arriving
around noon today on TWA flight 79

and plans to remain at Stanford until
Sunday.
The closest Stanford contender was
Jack H. Friedenthal, professor of law,
but his 28,219 votes were nowhere
near Beye's final total of 43,245. In
third place with 21,230 votes was A. S.
Tetelman, Associate Professor of Ma-

and was more than 3500 votes ahead
terials Science and of Engineering
Mechanics.
