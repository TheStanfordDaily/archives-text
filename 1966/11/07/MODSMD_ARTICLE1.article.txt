## SCPV Initiates Two Day Vietnam Protest 
### STEVE RUTKUS 
Two members of the Stanford Com
mittee for Peace in Vietnam (SCPV)
last night began in White Memorial
Plaza what they vowed would be a
two-day "fast and vigil" in order to
rally support for their cause.
Despite chilling winds and the clear
threat of rain, the duo claimed that
five others would join them within
hours. "We'll all simply move under
the Union arcade if things get wet,"
one commented.
The two declined to give their names,
one charging, "otherwise the univer
sity administration would not think
we were serious about keeping the
list of our officers out of the Dean's
Office." The remark referred to the
SCPV's stated intent to register only
with the ASSU and not with the uni
versity.
Today at 7:30 p.m. at White Plaza
the SCPV will hold a "Vietnam Fo
rum." Speakers will include Professor
Barton Bernstein of the History De
partment, Professor Charles Dreck
meier of the Political Science Depart
ment and Peter Cameo, who is on
the steering committee of Berkeley's
United Committee Against the War.
In conjunction with other pearo
groups across the nation, the SCPV
designated November 5-8 as "National
Days of Mobilization for Peace." The
fast that began last night and which
is intended to extend into the closing
hours of tomorrow's polling, will bring
to a close an involved slate of SCPV
activities that include a mild demon
stration at Saturday's Air Force game.
Garbed in funeral dress and bran
dishing anti-war placards, the SCPV
delegates were barred entrance to the
game by university officials and Santa
Clara County Sheriff's deputies.
Having earlier announced their in
tent to "make people think about
the war while they are watching the
game," the SCPV members and sym
pathizers were told that long-stand
ing campus policy prohibited demon
strations in a stadium while Univer
sity functions are in progress.
Frederic O. Glover, Executive Assis
tant to the President, informed the
protesters that they would be admit
ted as soon as they disposed of their
banners.
David Ransom, SCPV treasurer,
charged university officials with "not
making clear" present policy on dem
onstrations. He also cited contradic
tory statements on the part of Glover
and Director of Athletics Charles A.
Taylor.
In the presence of a Dally reporter,

Taylor assured SCPV members that,
had they obtained permission from
the Athletic Department on Friday,
they may have been admitted into
the stadium with banners.
Ransom questioned the 'univer
sity's right to insist on approving
certain banners and not others." He
referred to the Wendy G. Wonka ban
ner that was admitted without earlier
approval, commenting, "the univer
sity okays demonstrations as long as
they're a joke and not when they're
serious. It's a clear instance of dis
crimination."
Banners, however, were "smuggled"
into the stands. Blowing noisy plastic
horns, until police requested that they
stop, the SCPV and sympathizers,
about 80 in all, enjoyed the high mark
of their day, when six white doves
were released at halftime.
Ransom insisted that today's fast
ing was being conducted by individ
uals, not by official representatives of
the SCPV

Sheriffs kept the SCPV members con
tained high in the end zone seats
during the SU-AF game.

versity.
Today at 7:30 p.m. at White Plaza
the SCPV will hold a "Vietnam Fo
rum." Speakers will include Professor
Barton Bernstein of the History De
partment, Professor Charles Dreck
meier of the Political Science Depart
ment and Peter Cameo, who is on
the steering committee of Berkeley's
United Committee Against the War.
In conjunction with other pearo
groups across the nation, the SCPV
designated November 5-8 as "National
Days of Mobilization for Peace." The
fast that began last night and which
is intended to extend into the closing
hours of tomorrow's polling, will bring
to a close an involved slate of SCPV
activities that include a mild demon
stration at Saturday's Air Force game.
Garbed in funeral dress and bran
dishing anti-war placards, the SCPV
delegates were barred entrance to the
game by university officials and Santa
Clara County Sheriff's deputies.
Having earlier announced their in
tent to "make people think about
the war while they are watching the
game," the SCPV members and sym
pathizers were told that long-stand
ing campus policy prohibited demon
strations in a stadium while Univer
sity functions are in progress.
Frederic O. Glover, Executive Assis
tant to the President, informed the
protesters that they would be admit
ted as soon as they disposed of their
banners.
David Ransom, SCPV treasurer,
charged university officials with "not
making clear" present policy on dem
onstrations. He also cited contradic
tory statements on the part of Glover
and Director of Athletics Charles A.
Taylor.
In the presence of a Dally reporter,

Taylor assured SCPV members that,
had they obtained permission from
the Athletic Department on Friday,
they may have been admitted into
the stadium with banners.
Ransom questioned the 'univer
sity's right to insist on approving
certain banners and not others." He
referred to the Wendy G. Wonka ban
ner that was admitted without earlier
approval, commenting, "the univer
sity okays demonstrations as long as
they're a joke and not when they're
serious. It's a clear instance of dis
crimination."
Banners, however, were "smuggled"
into the stands. Blowing noisy plastic
horns, until police requested that they
stop, the SCPV and sympathizers,
about 80 in all, enjoyed the high mark
of their day, when six white doves
were released at halftime.
Ransom insisted that today's fast
ing was being conducted by individ
uals, not by official representatives of
the SCPV


An extra concentration of County
Sheriffs kept the SCPV members con

during the SU-AF game.
Two members of the Stanford Com
mittee for Peace in Vietnam (SCPV)
last night began in White Memorial
Plaza what they vowed would be a
two-day "fast and vigil" in order to
rally support for their cause.
Despite chilling winds and the clear
threat of rain, the duo claimed that
five others would join them within
hours. "We'll all simply move under
the Union arcade if things get wet,"
one commented.
The two declined to give their names,
one charging, "otherwise the univer
sity administration would not think
we were serious about keeping the
list of our officers out of the Dean's
Office." The remark referred to the
SCPV's stated intent to register only
with the ASSU and not with the uni
versity.
