# Elections '66: Candidates And Issues
## Election Preview Viet War No Longer Key Issue In Congressional Campaigns 
### HENRY MULLER, NEWS EDITOR CARL P. Leeubsdorf Associated Press Writer 
The Vietnam war, once considered
likely to become a key issue in this
fall's congressional campaigns, ap
pears to have faded as a subject of
partisan contention as election day
approaches.
An Associated Press survey of cam
paign issues indicates most candi
dates in most races support the war
and the administration's basic poli
cies.
Differences are largely a matter of
degree or relate to such peripheral
aspects as what Republicans charge
is a "credibility gap" in administra
tion pronouncements about the war.
Still, the survey shows, more than
three dozen senate and house candi
dates are trying to win with so-called
"peace platforms" despite the gen
erally poor showing by war opponents
in primaries.
Of these candidates, the ones given
the best chances for election are those
who already hold office. Most chal
lengers face stiff uphill fights.
Two Senators who have expressed
reservations about escalation of the
war are John Sherman Cooper, R-
Ky., and Lee Metcalf, D-Mont. Cooper
has been accused by his Democratic
opponent, John Young Brown, of ad
vocating too soft a Vietnam policy.
Metcalf, however, has modified his
position so that it is now about the
same as that of his GOP challenger,
Gov. Tim M. Babcock.
In the Oregon Senate race, earlier

divisions over Vietnam have largely
vanished. Republican Gov. Mark O.
Hatfield, who has been critical of Ad
ministration policy, says the Admin
istration has come around to his way
of thinking. His opponent, Rep. Rob
ert B. Duncan, entered the race pri
marily to support the President on
Vietnam.
A number of peace candidates won
Democratic House nominations in
normally Republican districts. These
Include four in California, running'
against Reps. William S. Maillard,
Charles S. Gubser, H. Allen Smith
and Alphonzo BelL
