# Big Increase In Negro Registration May Be Pivotal Factor In Elections
## 
### WILLIAM T. PEACOCK 
Negro registration zoomed up
sharply in the South in the last year
and probably increased considerably
in the country as a whole.
Negro ballots could weigh heavily—
perhaps be pivotal—in some of this
year's major election contests if a
high percentage of registered Negroes
vote.
Precise figures on the number of
U.S. Negroes qualified to vote are
unobtainable because most states do
not keep registration figures by races.
Louis Martin, Deputy Democratic
National Committee Chairman, a
Negro who works particularly in this
field, estimates the current total at
2.5 million for the South alone.
The Republican National Commit
tee says it has no current figures.
The Justice Department's Civil
Rights Division reports that Negro
registration rose from 687,000 to I,*
106,800 between Aug. 6, 1965 and last
Aug. 6 in these five states: Alabama,
Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and
South Carolina.

The 1965 date is that on which
President Johnson signed the Voting
Rights Act of 1965 which permitted
the dispatch of Federal registrars to
states where the Attorney General
found discrimination to exist.
Aside from actions by federal regis
trars there has been an increase due
to registration drives by civil rights
groups.
Outside the South, the principal
questions with respect to Negro
voters are whether the Republicans
can make inroads in the strong sup
port Democratic candidates have had
such states as Illinois, Michigan, New
in recent years among Negroes in
York, Pennsylvania and California.
In Maryland, one of the reasons
Republican Spiro T. Agnew is given
a chance of election as Governor is
the expectation that many Negroes
who normally vote Democratic will
decline to support their party's nom
inee, George P. Mahoney, an opponent
of open housing.
