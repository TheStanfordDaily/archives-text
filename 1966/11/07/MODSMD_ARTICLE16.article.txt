# Percy, Romney, Rhodes Highlight Republican Ambitions In Midwest
## 
### PAT McMAHON 
Republican hopes for a better split
in Washington next year rest a great
extent in the Midwest.
The Heartland offers such notables
as Chuck Percy, George Romney, and
Ohio Governor James A. Rhodes to
Republicans looking for a standard
bearer. Paul Douglas, Soapy Wil
liams, and Freshman Congressman
John J. Gilligan entice Democrats to
work particularly hard for their can
didates.

Probably the most natable race there
is, is the Illinois battle for the United
States Senate. Charles Percy, young,
vibrant industrialist, and Chairman of
the Board of Bell and Howell at age
29, faces 74-year-old incumbent Paul
Douglas.
Percy's youthful air, and sympathy
for the September slaying of his 19-
year-old daughter, Valerie, combined
with his extensive campaigning give
him the edge on what would other
wise be a hairline close election.

In Minnesota, incumbent Governor
Karl Rolvaag takes on Republican
LeVander in a battle that may bruise
even Hubert Humphrey.
With the split, Republicans hopes
doubled and centered about LeVander
who probably will govern Hubert's
state for at least four years.
Romney
Michigan realms as the first prov
ing ground for Presidential possibility
George Romney. It is certain that he
will wallop over challenger Zolton
Ferency, but that margin and its ef
fects are major concerns.
A large majority would help prove
Romney a successful vote-getter—the
first necessity of a Presidential can
didate.
Other Midwestern states may hold
to the status quo. In Indiana, Mis
souri, and North Dakota where
neither Senatorial or gubernatorial
races highlight the fall elections, Con
gressional ratios will stay as they are.
Republican Nebraska, Kansas, and
South Dakota will remain solidily so.
lowa
Three of lowa's freshman Demo
crats elected in the Johnson landslide
will stick it out with another popular
Democrat at the top of the ticket,
Governor Harold E. Hughes. Tradi
tionally Republican lowa will push up
two more Republicans to the House
of Representatives, however.
It seems that the GOP hopes stand
highest in the Heartland and that the
Midwest may return in part to its
Republican self, but as the farm belt
withers so does the strength of the
Grand Old Party.

liams, and Freshman Congressman
John J. Gilligan entice Democrats to
work particularly hard for their can
didates.

Probably the most natable race there
is, is the Illinois battle for the United
States Senate. Charles Percy, young,
vibrant industrialist, and Chairman of
the Board of Bell and Howell at age
29, faces 74-year-old incumbent Paul
Douglas.
Percy's youthful air, and sympathy
for the September slaying of his 19-
year-old daughter, Valerie, combined
with his extensive campaigning give
him the edge on what would other
wise be a hairline close election.

In Minnesota, incumbent Governor
Karl Rolvaag takes on Republican
LeVander in a battle that may bruise
even Hubert Humphrey.
With the split, Republicans hopes
doubled and centered about LeVander
who probably will govern Hubert's
state for at least four years.
Romney
Michigan realms as the first prov
ing ground for Presidential possibility
George Romney. It is certain that he
will wallop over challenger Zolton
Ferency, but that margin and its ef
fects are major concerns.
A large majority would help prove
Romney a successful vote-getter—the
first necessity of a Presidential can
didate.
Other Midwestern states may hold
to the status quo. In Indiana, Mis
souri, and North Dakota where
neither Senatorial or gubernatorial
races highlight the fall elections, Con
gressional ratios will stay as they are.
Republican Nebraska, Kansas, and
South Dakota will remain solidily so.
lowa
Three of lowa's freshman Demo
crats elected in the Johnson landslide
will stick it out with another popular
Democrat at the top of the ticket,
Governor Harold E. Hughes. Tradi
tionally Republican lowa will push up
two more Republicans to the House
of Representatives, however.
It seems that the GOP hopes stand
highest in the Heartland and that the
Midwest may return in part to its
Republican self, but as the farm belt
withers so does the strength of the
Grand Old Party.
