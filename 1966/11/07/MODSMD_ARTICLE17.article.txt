# CALIFORNIA BALLOT
## 'Clean' Amendment, 1-A Lead Propositions 
### STEVE GRUBER 
Of the seventeen propositions on
the California ballot, numbers 16 and
1-A are drawing the most attention.
Proposition 16, familiarly known as
the "clean" amendment, if passed,
will redefine the words "obscenity"
and "knowingly," provide rules and
procedures for prosecuting obscene
literature violations, and make con
spiracy to violate obscenity laws a
felony.
The measure would set up the fol
lowing definition of obscenity, "A
thing is obsecene if, considered as a
whole, its dominant theme or purpose
is an appeal to prurient interest. Pru
rient interest is defined as a shameful
or morbid interest in nudity, sex, or
excretion, which goes substantially

Deyond customary limits of candor in
description or representation of such
matters."
"Knowlingly" would be redefined as
"having knowledge of the contents of
the subject matter, or recklessly fail
ing to exercise reasonable inspection
which would have disclosed the char
acter of the same."
Police Confiscation
According to the proposed law, any
police officer would be permitted to
confiscate obscene material.
Sponsors of proposition 16 say that
a yes vote will protect children from
"smut and obscenity."
They also claim that it would "con
trol the flood of filth which is engulf
ing California." Furthermore, they
argue, crime and smut are directly re
lated.
Opponents of the measure say that
the proposal is so broad and sweeping
that it might prohibit the works of
Shakespeare and the Bible.
According to the proposition 16
opponents, the measure would freeze
its provisions into law and could be
changed only by a vote of the people.
Present obscenity laws are adequate,
they say.
1A Most Significant
Proposition 1A has avoided most of
the scandalous advertising connected
with 16, but it probably is the most
significant on the ballot.
It would make the following
changes:
• Require the state legislature to
meet annually. It now meets in odd
numbered years only.
• Salaries of legislators would be
set by a two-thirds vote of each house,
instead of by the constitution.
• The number of signatures needed
for an initiative petition for enactment
of a statute would be reduced from 8
to 5 per cent of the votes cast at the
last election for Governor.
• Initiative petition would no longer
have to be submitted to the legislature
for approval.
Proposition 1A is supported by both
Governor Brown and Ronald Reagan.
Will Modernize
Proponents of the measure say that
it is intended to modernize California's
constitution. It is the result of three

years of work by the Constitution Re
vision Commission and will help state
government face new challenges not
dreamed of in 1879, when the present
constitution was adopted, they say.
According to the opponents of prop
osition IA, it would kill off the tradi
tional system of citizen legislators
and create professional politicians.
"The passing of laws in a free coun
try ought not to be a fulltime profes
sion for anyone," they claim.
Furthermore, the opponents say
"Prescribing laws which other people
are to be forced to obey can never be
a primary occupation for any man
who loves liberyt."
Minor Interest
Other propositions which have man
aged to stir up minor interest are
numbers 2, 4, 6, and 8.
• Proposition 2 is a bond issue for
the University of California and the
California State College system.
• Proposition 4 would decrease the
percentage of votes necessary to pass
a school bond proposal from 67 to 60.
• Proposition 6 would have the leg

islature reconvene 30 days after the
end of the session solely to consider
"pocket vetoes."
• Proposition 8 would restrict the
deductions insurance companies could
claim on their taxes. They are present
ly allowed to deduct from their state
taxes what they pay in property taxes.
The proponents say this amend
ment would increase state tax reve
nue by $1 million. It will remove the
unfair advantage held by out-of-state
companies, they add.

Other propositions which have man
aged to stir up minor interest are
numbers 2, 4, 6, and 8.
• Proposition 2 is a bond issue for
the University of California and the
California State College system.
• Proposition 4 would decrease the
percentage of votes necessary to pass
a school bond proposal from 67 to 60.
• Proposition 6 would have the leg

islature reconvene 30 days after the
end of the session solely to consider
"pocket vetoes."
• Proposition 8 would restrict the
deductions insurance companies could
claim on their taxes. They are present
ly allowed to deduct from their state
taxes what they pay in property taxes.
The proponents say this amend
ment would increase state tax reve
nue by $1 million. It will remove the
unfair advantage held by out-of-state
companies, they add.
Of the seventeen propositions on
the California ballot, numbers 16 and
1-A are drawing the most attention.
Proposition 16, familiarly known as
the "clean" amendment, if passed,
will redefine the words "obscenity"
and "knowingly," provide rules and
procedures for prosecuting obscene
literature violations, and make con
spiracy to violate obscenity laws a
felony.
The measure would set up the fol
lowing definition of obscenity, "A
thing is obsecene if, considered as a
whole, its dominant theme or purpose
is an appeal to prurient interest. Pru
rient interest is defined as a shameful
or morbid interest in nudity, sex, or
excretion, which goes substantially

Deyond customary limits of candor in
description or representation of such
matters."
"Knowlingly" would be redefined as
"having knowledge of the contents of
the subject matter, or recklessly fail
ing to exercise reasonable inspection
which would have disclosed the char
acter of the same."
Police Confiscation
According to the proposed law, any
police officer would be permitted to
confiscate obscene material.
Sponsors of proposition 16 say that
a yes vote will protect children from
"smut and obscenity."
They also claim that it would "con
trol the flood of filth which is engulf
ing California." Furthermore, they
argue, crime and smut are directly re
lated.
Opponents of the measure say that
the proposal is so broad and sweeping
that it might prohibit the works of
Shakespeare and the Bible.
According to the proposition 16
opponents, the measure would freeze
its provisions into law and could be
changed only by a vote of the people.
Present obscenity laws are adequate,
they say.
1A Most Significant
Proposition 1A has avoided most of
the scandalous advertising connected
with 16, but it probably is the most
significant on the ballot.
It would make the following
changes:
• Require the state legislature to
meet annually. It now meets in odd
numbered years only.
• Salaries of legislators would be
set by a two-thirds vote of each house,
instead of by the constitution.
• The number of signatures needed
for an initiative petition for enactment
of a statute would be reduced from 8
to 5 per cent of the votes cast at the
last election for Governor.
• Initiative petition would no longer
have to be submitted to the legislature
for approval.
Proposition 1A is supported by both
Governor Brown and Ronald Reagan.
Will Modernize
Proponents of the measure say that
it is intended to modernize California's
constitution. It is the result of three

years of work by the Constitution Re
vision Commission and will help state
government face new challenges not
dreamed of in 1879, when the present
constitution was adopted, they say.
According to the opponents of prop
osition IA, it would kill off the tradi
tional system of citizen legislators
and create professional politicians.
"The passing of laws in a free coun
try ought not to be a fulltime profes
sion for anyone," they claim.
Furthermore, the opponents say
"Prescribing laws which other people
are to be forced to obey can never be
a primary occupation for any man
who loves liberyt."
