# Undecided Voters To Determine Victor In State Gubernatorial Bout
## 
### STEVE GRUBER 
The California gubernatorial elec
tion is too close to make an accurate
prediction, although many signs point
to a Reagan victory.
The California poll predicted, on the
basis of a sample taken October 31
and November 1, that Reagan is fav
ored 46 percent to 41 percent for
Governor Brown. Assuming a one per
cent error in the poll and including
the fairly large number of undecided
voters as of last week, it looks like
a very close race.
Governor Brown has been trying
to make the best of the undecided
voters. In the last two weeks he has
confined his campaign to vote-heavy
Southern California, where all the
polls show him to be the underdog.
Brown has been going where the
votes are and, more important, where

the voters do not necessarily favor
him.
Reagan's substantial gains in the
last month are due, for the most part,
to the fact that he sounds much less
like Barry Goldwater now. In fact,
his campaign is closely following the
guidelines set by George Murphy
wheen he won election to the Senate
in 1964.
It has been important for Reagan
to stay away from the type of cam
paign run by Goldwater in this state.
He has done this well, so well, in fact,
that most voters would probably see
no connection at all. Noticeably,
neither Goldwater nor Nixon was in
vited to California to campaign for
Reagan.
Brown's basic mistake has been his
choice to run a negative campaign.
Instead of standing on his scandal
free record of the last eight years, he
has chosen to attack Reagan with two
different accusations.
The first was that Reagan, as an
actor, has had no preparation for a
political office. The second attempted
to link Reagan with the John Birch
Society.
The charges of right-wing connec
tions worked perfectly when Johnson
ran against Goldwater, but the voters
are tired of having these charges
dragged out again.
Reagan has atter p ced to refute the
claims that he is inexperienced by tell
ing the voters that the state needs
"citizen politicians", not "professional
politicians." This appears to have
gained ground for the Republicans
due to its implication that profession
al politicians are crooked.

Governor Brown conceded yester
day that his popularity has dropped
substantially since 1962, when he was
re-elected to a second term. These are
two issues which have caused this—
the Watts riots and and Berkeley's
Free Speech Movement.
Whether Brown can overcome these
is questionable. The fact remains,
however, that Reagan will not have
to overcome such obstacles.
It is not possible to say who will be
the victor tomorrow evening. The
polls taken over the last three months
have all shown the same thing—most
of the voters haven't made up their
minds.
If Brown does lose, he will have no
one to blame but himself.

The California gubernatorial elec
tion is too close to make an accurate
prediction, although many signs point
to a Reagan victory.
The California poll predicted, on the
basis of a sample taken October 31
and November 1, that Reagan is fav
ored 46 percent to 41 percent for
Governor Brown. Assuming a one per
cent error in the poll and including
the fairly large number of undecided
voters as of last week, it looks like
a very close race.
Governor Brown has been trying
to make the best of the undecided
voters. In the last two weeks he has
confined his campaign to vote-heavy
Southern California, where all the
polls show him to be the underdog.
Brown has been going where the
votes are and, more important, where

the voters do not necessarily favor
him.
Reagan's substantial gains in the
last month are due, for the most part,
to the fact that he sounds much less
like Barry Goldwater now. In fact,
his campaign is closely following the
guidelines set by George Murphy
wheen he won election to the Senate
in 1964.
It has been important for Reagan
to stay away from the type of cam
paign run by Goldwater in this state.
He has done this well, so well, in fact,
that most voters would probably see
no connection at all. Noticeably,
neither Goldwater nor Nixon was in
vited to California to campaign for
Reagan.
Brown's basic mistake has been his
choice to run a negative campaign.
Instead of standing on his scandal
free record of the last eight years, he
has chosen to attack Reagan with two
different accusations.
The first was that Reagan, as an
actor, has had no preparation for a
political office. The second attempted
to link Reagan with the John Birch
Society.
The charges of right-wing connec
tions worked perfectly when Johnson
ran against Goldwater, but the voters
are tired of having these charges
dragged out again.
Reagan has atter p ced to refute the
claims that he is inexperienced by tell
ing the voters that the state needs
"citizen politicians", not "professional
politicians." This appears to have
gained ground for the Republicans
due to its implication that profession
al politicians are crooked.

Governor Brown conceded yester
day that his popularity has dropped
substantially since 1962, when he was
re-elected to a second term. These are
two issues which have caused this—
the Watts riots and and Berkeley's
Free Speech Movement.
Whether Brown can overcome these
is questionable. The fact remains,
however, that Reagan will not have
to overcome such obstacles.
It is not possible to say who will be
the victor tomorrow evening. The
polls taken over the last three months
have all shown the same thing—most
of the voters haven't made up their
minds.
If Brown does lose, he will have no
one to blame but himself.
