# Draft Down For '67
## 
### RICHARD RIORDAN 
Secretary of Defense Robert S.
McNamara told President Johnson
Saturday that the draft call may be
cut in half next year because of a pro
posed slowdown in American military
activity in Vietnam.
An optimistic outlook on the pro
gress of the war and a healthy in
crease in federal revenues for the cur
rent fiscal year explain the planned
slowdown.
The defense chief said U.S. forces
in Vietram will be increased to about
385,000 by the end of next month.
This is a forty thousand increase on
the present level. However next year's
buildup will not approach the 200,000-
man increase of 1966.
McNamara estimated that draft
calls for recent months have averaged
thirty-seven to fifty thousand men.
Calls for the next four months
should average closer to 25,000.
Flndelsen Comments
Walter J. Findeisen, Stanford Na
tional Service Advisor, told The Dally
that no long range prediction on the
draft cut can be made. Certainly those
classified 1-A have a better chance of
escaping the draft now than they did
last year. However, students with
deferred classification might suffer
later on as a result of the current
defense ruling. Student standing, then,
will depend on future draft changes.
McNamara also disclosed plans for
a cutback in the purchase of aircraft
bombs and other ammunition; and
U.S. air activity in general should

follow the same trend toward stabiliza
tion.
Still a note of caution tempered
the defense secretary's optimism. "I
want to emphasize," he remarked,
"that we continue to face a stubborn
enemy."
This hopeful assessment was de
livered at President Johnson's LBJ
ranch. Since it came in the waning
days of state and congressional elec
tion campaigns, the assessment has
a possible bearing upon the unan
swered question of a wartime tax in
crease.
U.S. Revenue Up
Standing besides McNamara, the
President announced the five to seven
billion dollar increase over January
estimates for this year's federal rev
enue and the 4.5 billion dollars of ex
penditure over the anticipated amount.
Apart from a still-to-be-determined
supplemental defense appropriation,
he said, the revenue increase will
more than offset increases in federal
spending.
When Johnson approached the sub
ject of a tax increase, he had no
definite statement. He said that the
question could not be decided until
all the figures are in on the nation's
defense spending.
The President emphasized that a big
factor in determining whether to seek
a tax increase for 1967 from Congress
would be the forthcoming decision on
the supplemental money request. Mc-
Namara and the President have been
deliberating on the question for some
time, yet they expect to take several
more weeks before thev decide.
