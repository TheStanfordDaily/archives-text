# White Backlash Blurs Issues On East Coast
## 
### JAY BOSWORTH 
Twenty-four hours before the first
polls open many of the most hotly
contested Eastern races have not pro
duced favorites or even clear-cut plat
forms.
No common major issue seems to
exist with the possible exception of
the white reaction against the many
recent Negro advances in the civil
rights area.
Massachusetts
Curiously enough, white backlash
is important to the senatorial race in
Massachusetts, a state in which civil
rights has usually taken a back seat
to other regional issues.
Attorney General and Republican
nominee for the senate, Edward W.
Brooke has been among the most out
spoken proponents of the "go slow"
policy. Ironically, Brooke is a Negro
and may fall victim to the anti-Negro

reaction himself. He has repeatedly
emphasized the necessity of giving
Negroes the opportunity to maintain
their self-respect by "doing for thorn
selves" instead of accepting hand-outs.
He condemns extremists, white and
black as "a threat to the nation."
Civil Rights Advocate
Endicott Peabody, Liberal Demo
crat and former Governor, is himself
an ardent civil rights advocate and
accuses Brooke of "trying to run on
my platform". Peabody has the Ken
nedys and President Johnson cam
paigning for him and has seen
Brooke's advantage at the polls
dwindle from seventy to forty per
cent.
In spite of this, Brooke should be
the first Negro U.S. Senator in more
than a century.
New York
Meanwhile, in nearby New York
voters are watching twice as many
candidates and many times more cam
paign funds try to secure the Gov
ernorship in a race of national im
portance.
Democrat Frank O'Conner has en
listed the support of D. Senator Rob
ert Kennedy in what will be the first
head-on clash between the two polit
ical powers in the state, Kennedy and
incumbent Republican Nelson Rocke
feller.
Confidently and methodically,
Rockefeller has been conducting his
own campaign in a professional and
conservative manner. The race has
been obscured by the presence of two
other candidates. Liberal Franklin D.
Roosevelt Jr., and Conservative Paul
Adams who do not figure to win but
have at least given the pollsters and
political theorists a surplus of factors
on which to base their predictions.
Rockefeller has been gaining and
should pull it out.

Roosevelt Jr., and Conservative Paul
Adams who do not figure to win but
have at least given the pollsters and
political theorists a surplus of factors
on which to base their predictions.
Rockefeller has been gaining and
should pull it out.
Twenty-four hours before the first
polls open many of the most hotly
contested Eastern races have not pro
duced favorites or even clear-cut plat
forms.
No common major issue seems to
exist with the possible exception of
the white reaction against the many
recent Negro advances in the civil
rights area.
Massachusetts
Curiously enough, white backlash
is important to the senatorial race in
Massachusetts, a state in which civil
rights has usually taken a back seat
to other regional issues.
Attorney General and Republican
nominee for the senate, Edward W.
Brooke has been among the most out
spoken proponents of the "go slow"
policy. Ironically, Brooke is a Negro
and may fall victim to the anti-Negro

reaction himself. He has repeatedly
emphasized the necessity of giving
Negroes the opportunity to maintain
their self-respect by "doing for thorn
selves" instead of accepting hand-outs.
He condemns extremists, white and
black as "a threat to the nation."
Civil Rights Advocate
Endicott Peabody, Liberal Demo
crat and former Governor, is himself
an ardent civil rights advocate and
accuses Brooke of "trying to run on
my platform". Peabody has the Ken
nedys and President Johnson cam
paigning for him and has seen
Brooke's advantage at the polls
dwindle from seventy to forty per
cent.
In spite of this, Brooke should be
the first Negro U.S. Senator in more
than a century.
New York
Meanwhile, in nearby New York
voters are watching twice as many
candidates and many times more cam
paign funds try to secure the Gov
ernorship in a race of national im
portance.
Democrat Frank O'Conner has en
listed the support of D. Senator Rob
ert Kennedy in what will be the first
head-on clash between the two polit
ical powers in the state, Kennedy and
incumbent Republican Nelson Rocke
feller.
Confidently and methodically,
Rockefeller has been conducting his
own campaign in a professional and
conservative manner. The race has
been obscured by the presence of two
other candidates. Liberal Franklin D.
Roosevelt Jr., and Conservative Paul
Adams who do not figure to win but
have at least given the pollsters and
political theorists a surplus of factors
on which to base their predictions.
Rockefeller has been gaining and
should pull it out.
