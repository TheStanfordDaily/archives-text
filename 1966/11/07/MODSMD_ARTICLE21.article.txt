# 'Peace And Prosperity' Headline Western Races
## 
### PAT McMAHON 
"Peace and prosperity" or so the
expression goes, may well epitomize
the politics of the Western states.
Aside from Oregon, which is top-billed
because of a dove-hawk battle and
California, not considered here, the
West is lit lie concerned by politics.
In Oregon, Mark Hatfield, .Republi
can governor of Oregon running on a
peace platform, meets Robert Duncan,
a Democratic representative. The is
sues are not clear cut other than the
fact that Hatfield has refused to join
with other governors in a statement
backing the war in Vietnam.
No LBJ Visit
Duncan, who has been helped by
Sen. Robert Kennedy's visit had also
expected assistance from President
Johnson, but as it turns out, LBJ won't
be heading West.
As the polls size it up, Duncan may
be dunked, but it will be a rough
flight all the way for "dove" Hatfield.
In Hawaii, incumbent Governor
Burns faces smooth surfing in bid for
reelection, and both Democratic Con
gressmen will probably be sent back
to Washington .although it could be
tightest for Patsy Mink, one of the
two.
Alaska will remain in the solid
Democratic column and can be ex
pected to pick incumbents for both

the Senate and Governor. Arizona will
defeat incumbent Senator Goddard
preferring stead challenger Wil
liams.
GOP Gain
Montana, where incumbent Demo
cratic Senator Metcalf is expected to
be returned to Washington, will main
tain the same 50-50 ratio of one Con
gressman for the GOP and one for
the Demos. Lonely Nevada will re
elect both their sole Congressman and
Governor Sawyer. Neighbor Utah will
however, most likely, increase the
GOP total in Congress by one.
Washington, with GOP Senator
Magnuson busy on Senatorial cam
paigns (he is GOP Senatorial Reelec
tion Committee Chairman) and no
governor to elect or reelect as yet, will
ante its present ratio in the House of
Representatives up to 6-4 for the Re
publicans.
Democratic Roncalio for the Senate
and GOP Hathaway for the Gover
nor's mansion summarize the politics
in Wyoming, except that heir sole
seat in the House looks to be changing
parties again—Republican challenger
has the edge.
Republicans will gain slightly in
the West in this off year election, but
a vacuum of issues make the West not
so wild, and never so wooly.

Duncan, who has been helped by
Sen. Robert Kennedy's visit had also
expected assistance from President
Johnson, but as it turns out, LBJ won't
be heading West.
As the polls size it up, Duncan may
be dunked, but it will be a rough
flight all the way for "dove" Hatfield.
In Hawaii, incumbent Governor
Burns faces smooth surfing in bid for
reelection, and both Democratic Con
gressmen will probably be sent back
to Washington .although it could be
tightest for Patsy Mink, one of the
two.
Alaska will remain in the solid
Democratic column and can be ex
pected to pick incumbents for both

the Senate and Governor. Arizona will
defeat incumbent Senator Goddard
preferring stead challenger Wil
liams.
GOP Gain
Montana, where incumbent Demo
cratic Senator Metcalf is expected to
be returned to Washington, will main
tain the same 50-50 ratio of one Con
gressman for the GOP and one for
the Demos. Lonely Nevada will re
elect both their sole Congressman and
Governor Sawyer. Neighbor Utah will
however, most likely, increase the
GOP total in Congress by one.
Washington, with GOP Senator
Magnuson busy on Senatorial cam
paigns (he is GOP Senatorial Reelec
tion Committee Chairman) and no
governor to elect or reelect as yet, will
ante its present ratio in the House of
Representatives up to 6-4 for the Re
publicans.
Democratic Roncalio for the Senate
and GOP Hathaway for the Gover
nor's mansion summarize the politics
in Wyoming, except that heir sole
seat in the House looks to be changing
parties again—Republican challenger
has the edge.
Republicans will gain slightly in
the West in this off year election, but
a vacuum of issues make the West not
so wild, and never so wooly.


RONALD REAGAN
"Peace and prosperity" or so the
expression goes, may well epitomize
the politics of the Western states.
Aside from Oregon, which is top-billed
because of a dove-hawk battle and
California, not considered here, the
West is lit lie concerned by politics.
In Oregon, Mark Hatfield, .Republi
can governor of Oregon running on a
peace platform, meets Robert Duncan,
a Democratic representative. The is
sues are not clear cut other than the
fact that Hatfield has refused to join
with other governors in a statement
backing the war in Vietnam.
No LBJ Visit
