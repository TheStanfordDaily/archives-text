# SHEERER. PARKER TOP SCORERS
## Aqualetes Beat SJS, O'Club 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER Sports Editor 
Gary Sheerer and John Parker
sparked the Stanford water polo
team to two victories last week
end. The Indians knocked off
San Jose State, 9-6, in a grudge
match at San Jose, and outma
neuvered the San Francisco
Olympic Club with All-World
goalie Milan Muskatirovic, 124.
The Stanford freshmen, who
lost their first game of the sea
son to San Jose's frosh, 9-23,
pushed the Spartababes to the
limit before losing, 14-11, after
the Papoose front line fouled
out. The frosh systematically
handled CSM, 13-6, the follow
ing day.
Sweet Revenge
The Stanford varsity lost to
San Jose, 9-8, early in the sea
son while Garry Sheerer sat
watching with a cast on his
ankle. The Spartans painfully
found out what a first team All-
American can do, as Sheerer
scored three times and tossed
three assist passes.
John Parker scored four
times. Parker took two assist
passes from Sheerer, and recip
rocated by throwing two to
Sheerer.
Stanford opened strong in the
first period when Mark Parmely
burned the back of the San Jose
net with a supercharged back
hand. The Tribe lots its 2-0 lead
in the second quarter when the

Stanford's three soccer gj
teams came up with a 1-2
| record against the Univer- ||
I sity of California at Berke- i
ley Saturday. The Varsity
and the J.V. team bowed by
scores of 3-1 to their Bear :
■; counterparts, but the Indian ||
| frosh scored a 4-2 triumph.

Spartans scoreless in the deep
end of the pool.

the net for the Indians' final

17 fingernail cuts on Stanford

eyelids.
Stanford vs. Muscatirovic
The game against the Olympic
Club was a saga of the Stanford
offense versus Yugoslavia's All-
World goalie Muskatirovic. Mus
katirovic, now a graduate stu

dent at Stanford, blocked 16 at
tempts with the world's best
goalie hands, elbows and shoul
ders.
Sheerer effectively sought out
the holes in Muskatirovic's hu
man curtain, hitting five goals
in three quarters. Mark Parmely
made his outside shots count,
scoring three. Parker tallied two,
and Pete Ready and Greb Buck
ingham hit one each.
Bill Ready, Stanford captain
in 1964, scored on three sweep
shots for the Olympic Club.
Sorem, who stopped 12 shots in

the game, made five of his saves
against Ready.
Ex-Stanford star Marty Hull
could not play with a newly ag
gravated eye infection, and wa
ter wizard Art Lambert was not
able to play, thinning out the
Olympic Club's offensive punch.
Every Stanford player got into
the game, and not one fouled
out.
Papooses Come Close
Wayne Wilson, a bull in the
hole, scored six goals for the
Papooses against San Jose. Wil

son has averaged five a game
for Stanford's 7-4 season. Cap
tain Tom Hill hit two against
San Jose, and five the nex day
against CSM.
The Papooses stayed neck and
neck with San Jose, moving to
a 9-8 advantage at the end 0*
the third period. With the score
tied, 11-11 in the last quarter,
starters Wilson, Hill, Bob Ab
spear and Dennis Daly fouled
out.
San Jose then rallied for the
winning three goals to break a
six game Papoose win streak.
