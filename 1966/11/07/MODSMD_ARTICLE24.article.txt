# Brubabes' Talent Tops Tribe 36-15; 83 Yard TD Snuffs Papoose Rally
## 
### BILL GRAHAM 
A talented UCLA freshman
team overpowered the Card
Frosh, 36-15, Friday, at UCLA.
Despite the lopsided score, the
Papooses appeared to have a
good change of winning the
game until the middle of the
fourth quarter. Trailing 22-7, the
Cards took the ball and drove
down the field to the Brubabe's
one-yard line, where fullback
Dave Parish packed it in for
the score. Ron Fujikawa ran an
option play for the two-point
conversion and the little Indians
found themselves within one
touchdown of UCLA .
The defense was looking good
and it held the Bruins for the
first series after the kick-off. The
next time UCLA got the ball,
it appeared the Papoose defense
was again holding. But quarter
back Bill Bolden, just as he
seemed to be trapped, hit Bill
Farmer with an 83-yard touch
down pass, to put the game on
ice for the Brubabes.
After a scoreless first quarter,

UCLA drew blood, when full
back Mike Garratt powered into
the end zone on a four-yard run.
The Brubabes tried to run the
ball on the conversion, but the
attempt was no good.
The Papooses came storming
right back and took the lead for
the only time in the game, when
Jack Alustiza went in from the
one and Nick DeLurgia kicked
the extra point.
The Cards' lead was short
lived, however, as UCLA got out
of a third down and long yard
age situation on a broken play
that took the ball to the Stan
ford four. From here, Glen Pa
velko carried on a quarterback
sweep for the touchdown. The
Brubabes passed for the extra
point to make the score 14-7 at
the end of the half.
UCLA was still going as it
came out from the start of the
third quarter as Steve Smalley
scored the Brubabes third touch-
Quarterback Pavelko once again
passed for the two-point con
version.

The Papooses seemed to come
back to life with Parish's touch
down, but UCLA's long touch
down pass gave the Little Bruins
a safe seven point edge. Pa
velko added an insurance touch
down with a ten-yard pass to
Drew Sones, and then passed
again for the two points.
Parish, Oliver Praised
Coach Russ Hampton felt that
his boys "played real well" but
that the Brubabes just "over
whemed us with their depth,
size and speed." Hampton
praised fullback Don Parish, who
once again did an outstanding
job on offense gaining 97 yards
in twenty carries, and Dick Oli
ver, whom he said played a very

good game at defensive safety.
Hampton was also pleased
with the two platoon system
which he installed for the game,
although he said that he felt
that the. experience the boy. r
gained playing both ways in the
first thee games was very valu
able.

the end of the half.
UCLA was still going as it
came out from the start of the
third quarter as Steve Smalley
scored the Brubabes third touch-
Quarterback Pavelko once again
passed for the two-point con
version.

The Papooses seemed to come
back to life with Parish's touch
down, but UCLA's long touch
down pass gave the Little Bruins
a safe seven point edge. Pa
velko added an insurance touch
down with a ten-yard pass to
Drew Sones, and then passed
again for the two points.
Parish, Oliver Praised
Coach Russ Hampton felt that
his boys "played real well" but
that the Brubabes just "over
whemed us with their depth,
size and speed." Hampton
praised fullback Don Parish, who
once again did an outstanding
job on offense gaining 97 yards
in twenty carries, and Dick Oli
ver, whom he said played a very

good game at defensive safety.
Hampton was also pleased
with the two platoon system
which he installed for the game,
although he said that he felt
that the. experience the boy. r
gained playing both ways in the
first thee games was very valu
able.
A talented UCLA freshman
team overpowered the Card
Frosh, 36-15, Friday, at UCLA.
Despite the lopsided score, the
Papooses appeared to have a
good change of winning the
game until the middle of the
fourth quarter. Trailing 22-7, the
Cards took the ball and drove
down the field to the Brubabe's
one-yard line, where fullback
Dave Parish packed it in for
the score. Ron Fujikawa ran an
option play for the two-point
conversion and the little Indians
found themselves within one
touchdown of UCLA .
The defense was looking good
and it held the Bruins for the
first series after the kick-off. The
next time UCLA got the ball,
it appeared the Papoose defense
was again holding. But quarter
back Bill Bolden, just as he
seemed to be trapped, hit Bill
Farmer with an 83-yard touch
down pass, to put the game on
ice for the Brubabes.
After a scoreless first quarter,

UCLA drew blood, when full
back Mike Garratt powered into
the end zone on a four-yard run.
The Brubabes tried to run the
ball on the conversion, but the
attempt was no good.
The Papooses came storming
right back and took the lead for
the only time in the game, when
Jack Alustiza went in from the
one and Nick DeLurgia kicked
the extra point.
The Cards' lead was short
lived, however, as UCLA got out
of a third down and long yard
age situation on a broken play
that took the ball to the Stan
ford four. From here, Glen Pa
velko carried on a quarterback
sweep for the touchdown. The
Brubabes passed for the extra
point to make the score 14-7 at
the end of the half.
