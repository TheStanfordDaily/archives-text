### BOB THIERIOT 
Dave Lewis, the forgotten In
dian, came out of nowhere and
led Stanford to a rousing 21-6
victory over the Air Force Sat
urday. Lewis did not start the
game, but came off the bench
near the end of the first half to
throw a 61 yard TD pass to Bob
Conrad. This pass and other
heroics in the second half earned
Lewis a unanimous election as
Back of the Game.
On the TV introductions Lewis
was named as the Stanford kick
er, even though Coach John Ral
ston had said after Thursday's
practice that Lewis would be the
starting halfback.
Chuck Williams started out as
Stanford's quarterback. He had

trouble handling the center
snaps, but still had his team

moving during the first quarter.
After receiving the opening
kickoff, Stanford stalled near
midfield and Dave Lewis punted
to the Air Force 16.
Quarterback Steve Turner
then led the Falcons on an 84
yard march. He himself ran for
23 of the yards and passed for
25. Most of his runs were on
broken plays when all his re
ceivers were covered. He was
able to get out of the pocket and
away from numerous big Red
linemen chasing him. Monty
Mohrman blocked the attempted
kick for the extra point.
Stanford's next drive was stop
ped when Williams fumbled a
center and the Air Force re
covered. But Turner was again
harrassed by the Stanford line,

but could not get clear. Mike
Hibler led the attack and re
covered a fumble on the Stan
ford 50.
3 Scores, No Points
Chuck Williams then directed
Stanford on one of the wierdest
"scoring" drives in history. The
Indians scored a field goal,
thought they had scored a touch
down, and then Shoemaker miss
ed another field goal try. Shoe
maker's first FG attempt from
the 25 was good, but the Air
Force was holding on the play.
Williams elected to take a first
down on the eight. Williams

then hit Bob Blunt in the end
zone with a 7 yard toss, but
Blunt had pushed off to get to
the pass, so Stanford retreated
to the 22.
Williams was surrounded be
hind the line on the next play,
almost got away, but lost six
yards. Shoemaker failed to kick
another field goal, this one from
43 yards.
Throughout the first half the
Air Force could go nowhere af
ter their initial scoring march.
Stanford finally retaliated just
after Williams was hurt running
for a first down. Greg Brough

ton provided most of the yard
age. Gene Washington skirted
left end for the final 5 yards.
Lewis Wails
With only 2:46 left before the
half, Dave Lewis went into ac
tion. On third down he romped
11 yards for a first down. On
the next play he launched a 55
yard aerial to Bob Conrad, who
left two Falcon defenders stand
ing foolishly as he danced into
the end zone.
During the second half Lewis
got his first opportunity at quar
terback this season. His passes
and Root's plunges up the

middle kept the Stanford ofltns»-
on the prowl. One drive Twas
halted in the third quarter when
Tom Zyroll picked off a Lewis'
pass on the goal line.
Stanford ran out the clock-and
increased their lead to 21|> in
the final minutes. Jack toot
raced through the middle f< r 35
yards to put the ball neai the
Air Force goal line. With :4; left
Root leaped over two j irds
strewn with bodies for the TD.
The victory evened Stanf rd's
record at 4-4 with confer »nce
games at UCLA and Cal rer lain
ing.

Chuck Williams then directed
Stanford on one of the wierdest
"scoring" drives in history. The
Indians scored a field goal,
thought they had scored a touch
down, and then Shoemaker miss
ed another field goal try. Shoe
maker's first FG attempt from
the 25 was good, but the Air
Force was holding on the play.
Williams elected to take a first
down on the eight. Williams

then hit Bob Blunt in the end
zone with a 7 yard toss, but
Blunt had pushed off to get to
the pass, so Stanford retreated
to the 22.
Williams was surrounded be
hind the line on the next play,
almost got away, but lost six
yards. Shoemaker failed to kick
another field goal, this one from
43 yards.
Throughout the first half the
Air Force could go nowhere af
ter their initial scoring march.
Stanford finally retaliated just
after Williams was hurt running
for a first down. Greg Brough

ton provided most of the yard
age. Gene Washington skirted
left end for the final 5 yards.

half, Dave Lewis went into ac
tion. On third down he romped
11 yards for a first down. On
the next play he launched a 55
yard aerial to Bob Conrad, who
left two Falcon defenders stand
ing foolishly as he danced into
the end zone.
During the second half Lewis
got his first opportunity at quar
terback this season. His passes
and Root's plunges up the

middle kept the Stanford ofltns»-
on the prowl. One drive Twas
halted in the third quarter when
Tom Zyroll picked off a Lewis'
pass on the goal line.
Stanford ran out the clock-and
increased their lead to 21|> in
the final minutes. Jack toot
raced through the middle f< r 35

led Stanford to a rousing 21-6
victory over the Air Force Sat

game, but came off the bench
near the end of the first half to
throw a 61 yard TD pass to Bob
Conrad. This pass and other
heroics in the second half earned
Lewis a unanimous election as
Back of the Game.
On the TV introductions Lewis
was named as the Stanford kick

practice that Lewis would be the
starting halfback.
Chuck Williams started out as
Stanford's quarterback. He had

trouble handling the center
snaps, but still had his team

moving during the first quarter.

25. Most of his runs were on
broken plays when all his re
ceivers were covered. He was
able to get out of the pocket and
away from numerous big Red
linemen chasing him. Monty
Mohrman blocked the attempted
kick for the extra point.
Stanford's next drive was stop
