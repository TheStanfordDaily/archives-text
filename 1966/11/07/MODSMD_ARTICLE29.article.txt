# 'Amazing' Lewis Is Hero In Cards' Locker Celebration
## 
### NICK SELBY 
"An amazing young man, an
amazing young man," mused a
happy John Ralston after the 21-
6 triumph over the Air Force
Saturday. He was refering, of
course, to halfback-quarterback
Dave Lewis, who guided the
Stanford offense to its most im
pressive showing this year.
Lewis was understandably
excited over the outcome of the
game. The sportswriters honored
him as Back of the Game in his
last game on the Stanford cam
pus, and his 50 yard pass to
split end Bob Conrad at the end
of the first half was the key
play.
First Time
Lewis's performance was out
standing in itself, but especially
amazing because it was the first
time this year he had played
quarterback. Lewis was forced
to step in at quarterback in the
second quarter when starter
Chuck Williams hurt his left el
bow and Air Force realized that
Gene Washington could not
throw.
Lewis said that he enjoyed
playing quarterback, a position
he held the last two years. He ex
plained that on the pass to Con
rad he saw the defensive safety
turn his back on him, and thus
threw the ball as far as he could
to the middle of the field.
Saw Ball At Last Moment
Conrad, who had sprinted
straight downfield, saw the ball
which was slightly underthrown
at the last instant and cut over
for it. He commented that he
was the secondary receiver on
the play and was watching his
defender. He added that it was
the same play as the one before,
and that he told Gene Washing
ton he might be able to get free.
"It's always great to score a
big touchdown — I've waited a
long time to get one like that—
but this one meant something
special since it was my last game
here," Conrad concluded.
One reason Conrad was open
on the play was that several Fal
con defenders covered Gene
Washington, who had lateraled
to Lewis and then cut over the
middle.
Washington earlier scored on

a five yard zigzag in the second
quarter. Washington explained
that he was almost trapped along
the sideline until he saw a small
corridor.
'Root, Root'
Fullback Jack Root set up the
final score with a 35 yard burst
that changed the Stanford cheer
ing section into a Rooting sec
tion. To the cries of "Root,
Root!" he sailed into the end
zone from the three.
Root explained that his 35
yard run came on a dive play.
"I broke through and stepped to
the outside, got a great block
and the middle was left wide
open."
UCLA, UCLA
The esctatic Indians hurried
off the playing field into the club
house, yelling "U.C.-L.A., U.C.-
L.A." in rythmic unison in prep
aration for next week's impor
tant conference contest. Hap
piest of the happy was Marty
Brill, who despite a broken and
bloodied nose, starred on de
fense with 13 tackles.
His cohort Monty Mohrman
displayed tremendous desire all
afternoon pursuing Falcon quar-

terback Steve Turner and break
ing up several screen passes.
Mohrman, Lineman of the
Game, explained that after the
Falcons used the screen pass
once (it went for 35 yards the
first time), he was able to sense
the play coming.
"My man would only brush me
and then drop off very quickly
to the outside. I stayed with
him until the ball was thrown."
Ralston Explains
"I was a little worried at the
start when Air Force jumped
out to that 6-0 lead. The Falcons
fooled us by running more than
we expected them to at the
start," Coach Ralston explained.
"I thought it might be another
case of a poor start ruining our
entire game, but then we qiuckly
got some breaks, fumbles at mid
fleld, and were OK."
Ralston added that he might
continue to use Lewis at quar
terback if Williams and Wash
ington don't recover in time
for UCLA.
As for UCLA, which lost to
Washington, Ralston was upset
—"I hoped we could catch them
asleep," he concluded.

final score with a 35 yard burst
that changed the Stanford cheer
ing section into a Rooting sec
tion. To the cries of "Root,
Root!" he sailed into the end
zone from the three.
Root explained that his 35
yard run came on a dive play.
"I broke through and stepped to
the outside, got a great block
and the middle was left wide
open."

The esctatic Indians hurried
off the playing field into the club
house, yelling "U.C.-L.A., U.C.-
L.A." in rythmic unison in prep
aration for next week's impor
tant conference contest. Hap
piest of the happy was Marty
Brill, who despite a broken and
bloodied nose, starred on de
fense with 13 tackles.
His cohort Monty Mohrman
displayed tremendous desire all
afternoon pursuing Falcon quar-

terback Steve Turner and break
ing up several screen passes.
Mohrman, Lineman of the
Game, explained that after the
Falcons used the screen pass
once (it went for 35 yards the
first time), he was able to sense
the play coming.
"My man would only brush me
and then drop off very quickly
to the outside. I stayed with
him until the ball was thrown."
Ralston Explains
"I was a little worried at the
start when Air Force jumped
out to that 6-0 lead. The Falcons
fooled us by running more than
we expected them to at the
start," Coach Ralston explained.
"I thought it might be another
case of a poor start ruining our
entire game, but then we qiuckly
got some breaks, fumbles at mid
fleld, and were OK."
Ralston added that he might
continue to use Lewis at quar
terback if Williams and Wash
ington don't recover in time
for UCLA.
As for UCLA, which lost to
Washington, Ralston was upset
—"I hoped we could catch them
asleep," he concluded.
"An amazing young man, an
amazing young man," mused a
happy John Ralston after the 21-
6 triumph over the Air Force
Saturday. He was refering, of
course, to halfback-quarterback
Dave Lewis, who guided the
Stanford offense to its most im
pressive showing this year.
Lewis was understandably
excited over the outcome of the
game. The sportswriters honored
him as Back of the Game in his
last game on the Stanford cam
pus, and his 50 yard pass to
split end Bob Conrad at the end
of the first half was the key
play.
First Time
Lewis's performance was out
standing in itself, but especially
amazing because it was the first
time this year he had played
quarterback. Lewis was forced
to step in at quarterback in the
second quarter when starter
Chuck Williams hurt his left el
bow and Air Force realized that
Gene Washington could not
throw.
Lewis said that he enjoyed
playing quarterback, a position
he held the last two years. He ex
plained that on the pass to Con
rad he saw the defensive safety
turn his back on him, and thus
threw the ball as far as he could
to the middle of the field.
Saw Ball At Last Moment
Conrad, who had sprinted
straight downfield, saw the ball
which was slightly underthrown
at the last instant and cut over
for it. He commented that he
was the secondary receiver on
the play and was watching his
defender. He added that it was
the same play as the one before,
and that he told Gene Washing
ton he might be able to get free.
"It's always great to score a
big touchdown — I've waited a
long time to get one like that—
but this one meant something
special since it was my last game
here," Conrad concluded.
One reason Conrad was open
on the play was that several Fal
con defenders covered Gene
Washington, who had lateraled
to Lewis and then cut over the
middle.
Washington earlier scored on

a five yard zigzag in the second
quarter. Washington explained
that he was almost trapped along
the sideline until he saw a small
corridor.
