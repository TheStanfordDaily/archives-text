# Stanford Awaits 'Year Of Change'
## Change 
### MARTHA HUMPHREY 
"Let us on all sides take the role of
truth and commit ourselves to what
Stanford is and what it should be,"
said B. Davie Napier, summing up
the purpose of the "Year of Change"
symposiums at Dinkelspiel Auditor
ium yesterday afternoon.
Napier, Dean of the Chapel, was
one of four speakers who discussed
student responsibilities under a gen
eral topic, "The Challenge." Others
featured were Doug McConnell, Caro
lee Nance, and Fred Fink, all Stan
ford students.
After the session in Dinkelspiel the
audience of 750 split up to go to the
homes of 72 faculty members for din
ner and discussion.
Nick Davis, member of the Student-
Faculty Board, introduced the speak
ers and outlined the aims of the sym
posium.
Lack of Communication
"We see a world with more people
than ever before but with less com
munication," he said. Are the changes
in society that make our a "fall-out,
drop-out, cop-out" world due to moral
decay or to an increase in sophisti
cation? He added that the purpose of
the series was to ask questions, not
to answer them.
Starting with the changes made
here at Stanford, the speakers
stressed the necessity of student re
sponsibility.
Miss Nance asked, "Is the challenge
made to establishments rebellious or
one of thoughtful concern?" She
added that self-respect is essential
when questioning ideas.
Napier added, "the student is ask
ing the twin question: 'Identity?' and
'Authenticity?' " Student worry about
educational institutions is something
new and refreshing, as well as "laud
able and enviable."
Recognizing the importance of in
terpersonal relationships is necessary,
McConnell emphasized. He argued

against the tendency of students to
identify a person with a group, be
it "fraternity, preppies, turkeys, or
bearded left-wingers." The ability to
change the outside environment rests
in the responsibility of examining the
inner self.
"Where but at a university is there
a possibility to think?" inquired Miss
Nance.
The Gospel According- To Peanuts
A problem is the student's tendency
to treat responsibilities superficially.
As Lucy in Peanuts says."I love man
kind. It's just people I hate."
Fink, speaking from behind a face
painted red with a green nose, asked
if under the surface "Has anything
really changed?". Surface changes
here at Stanford are easy. Students
voted for Dave Harris "not because
we agreed with Dave on change but
to sit back and watch the proceed
ings."
We have to start living and stop
painting faces, he added. "Until that
time the Winds of Freedom are blow
ing nothing but hot air," Fink warns,
referring to Stanford's motto.
McConnell says that at the age of
28. Stanford seniors will be in the
older half of the population. He
brought up the issues of automation,
black power, drugs and political ex
tremes.
"How are we going to cope with
these problems if we cay we love
mankind and not our neighbors?"
Napier probed the causes of the un
rest and change. "The old structures
have in fact collapsed. The old god
is dead." Some of the old structures
will appear in a new perspective while
new values will be added.
Glorious And Terrible Demands
Stanford's response to the change
of structures of meaning is essential.
"It is true that universities must fill
the modern void. The demands upon
us are at once glorious and terrible.
We welcome the fact of responsible,
participating worry."


Senator Fred Fink took the occasion
of the "Year Of Change" symposium
last night to demonstrate that not all
change is meaningful.
