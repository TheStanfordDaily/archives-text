# Cheerleaders Confusing

### 
Charles Beye came back to
Stanford Saturday for the most
requested return since the
Blob's.
This year' 6 red-hot prof, now
Associate Professor of Classics
at Boston University, led the
cheering multitudes during half

time at the Air Force Academy
game.
Pointing towards the threaten
ing gray skies and pretending
to shiver, Professor Beye ex
claimed, "It's great to be back
in sunny California!"
He then led the crowd in three
cheers. During the first he jump
ed up and down on the platform.
"That's the way they did it in
the thirties," he exclaimed. "Af
ter all, I've only been to three
football games in my life."
Professor Beye then proposed
a "Mod" cheer in which mem
bers of the crowd would shout
"Rah!" and wave their firsts in
a suggestive manner.
Professor Beye's purple-flow
ered shirt, his red-patterned tie
and his sunglasses added to the
effect.
Professor Beye dedicated his
third and last cheer to the Air
Force Academy: "Hate, Kill,
Hate, Kill, Hate, Kill."
After Beye retired, head yell
leader Mike McLean announced
that volunteers were passing
around blue cans for contribu
tions.
"If you don't put money in
the cans," McLean said, "Pro
fessor Beye won't be able to fly
back to Boston."
In order to stimulate contribu
tions, Professor Beye frugged
with Annabelle Evans, Home
coming Queen, during the third
quarter.
Because of this and other con
fusion on the field during half
time, the Air Force was not able
to unleash its falcon for a flying
exhibition.
In addition to Professor Beye,
the other confusion on the field
included a presentation of Home
coming Decoration Awards by
Miss Evans and her entourage.
In addition, Richard Guggen
hime, President of the Board of
Trustees, presented awards to
five men who had "helped Stan
ford over the years."
The rooting section had one
more gusty cheer before the
game was over. The cheer was
delivered by Otis, the noted con
fectionary dealer at the home
games.

Professor Beye's purple-flow
ered shirt, his red-patterned tie
and his sunglasses added to the
effect.
Professor Beye dedicated his
third and last cheer to the Air
Force Academy: "Hate, Kill,
Hate, Kill, Hate, Kill."
After Beye retired, head yell
leader Mike McLean announced
that volunteers were passing
around blue cans for contribu
tions.
"If you don't put money in
the cans," McLean said, "Pro
fessor Beye won't be able to fly
back to Boston."
In order to stimulate contribu
tions, Professor Beye frugged
with Annabelle Evans, Home
coming Queen, during the third
quarter.
Because of this and other con
fusion on the field during half
time, the Air Force was not able
to unleash its falcon for a flying
exhibition.
In addition to Professor Beye,
the other confusion on the field
included a presentation of Home
coming Decoration Awards by
Miss Evans and her entourage.
In addition, Richard Guggen
hime, President of the Board of
Trustees, presented awards to
five men who had "helped Stan
ford over the years."
The rooting section had one
more gusty cheer before the
game was over. The cheer was
delivered by Otis, the noted con
fectionary dealer at the home
games.
