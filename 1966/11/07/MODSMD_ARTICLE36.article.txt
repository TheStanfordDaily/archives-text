# Prof Swipes At US On UN
## 
### 
A Stanford political scientist has
accused the U.S. government of
being "contemptuous of the evi
dence" in the World Court's re
cently-decided South West Africa
case and of "lending a helping
hand" to a General Assembly
majority which he said is chang
ing the United Nations "into
an instrument of aggression."
Dr. Stefan T. Possony, director
of the international political

studies program at the Univer
sity's Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution, and Peace, made the
charges in remarks prepared for
a luncheon meeting of the Com
monwealth Club last Friday.
Possony testified as an expert
witness in the case on behalf of

the defendant nation, the Re
public of South Africa, during
litigation extending over si x
years. Judgment of the Court—
officially the International Court
of Justice, a part of the UN
structure —was 7 to 6 in favor
of South Africa.
