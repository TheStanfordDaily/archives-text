## Possibility: Harris Left By 'Right' System 
### 
Editor, The Daily;
Tim Haight's editorial indigna
tion ( Nov. 4th) that Dave Harris
has not led a student uprising
to demolish the traditional Stan
ford educational system and
build a glorious edifice from the
rubble seems a little precipitous.
It may be that Dave is begin
ning to run into unsuspected
facts that Tim has not yet fully
confronted. Let me suggest some
possibilities:
It is possible that the cam
pus anarchists have not un
earthed the Wisdom of the Ages
that was heretofore concealed
by self-serving bureaucrats.

It is possible that education
consists of more than "LSD at
the health service' 'and a shape
less, groping muddle without
grades, guidelines, or require
ments. We should even consider
the possibility (Mind you, I'm
not asserting such an outra
geous thing!) that becoming "hu
man beings capable of mastering
their society" might require the
assimilation of some specific
items of knowledge.
It is possible that a student
generation that compusively
confroms to almost anything
that will produce squawks of
outrage from stuffy middle-aged
people (who, 30 years ago, de
lighted in shocking their middle
aged predecessors) would elect
a bearded, radical student-body
president for pure shock effect.
It is even possible (Heresy of
heresies!) that the President, the
administrators, the trustees, the
faculty, and the past student
bodies have built a worthy insti
tution and an honorable tradi
tion of true scholarship, and that
it is neither necessary nor de
sirable to sweep them away in a
tide of revolutionary "reform."

(Editor's Note: To answer
Mr. Aderhold's mistaken impres
sion that Mr. Haighfs column
was an editorial, it seems an ex
planation of editorial is nec
essary. Editorials are prepared
and written by the editor, or If
initialed, by a member of the

• Too Far, Too Bad
Editor, The Daily:
The stupidity of those who cut
Dave Harris' hair is only sur
passed by those who insist that
great psychological and moral
principles can be drawn from the
affair. A not-so-funny prank by
a short-sightod group, it very
well could be. To interpret it as a
castration anxiety or a basis for
condemning the entire fraternity
system, is carrying things too
far. KAY GRIFFIN
• Singular Purpose
Editor, The Daily;
Knowing how dedicated Dave
Harris has been in trying to
develop some kind of rapport
between the students and the
administration, I was surprised
and disappointed to hear that
he nominated only one student
for each of the Presidential Com
mittees when President Sterling

requested the names of two. In
this instance Harris seems to be
purposely anatagonizing the ad
ministration. Ho reminds me of
a stubborn little boy crying.
"Listen to me! You've got to
play the game my way." This
sounds very unlike Dave Harris,
but I would like an explanation
of his action so that I could
once again admire his unreserv
edly as a mature person dedi
cated to his ideals.

• Apology
Editor, The Daily;
I would like to apologize for
the rather stereo typed and self
righteous view of "student ac
tivists" that some Peace Corps
recruiters expressed in the noon
rally and the Stanford Daily. To
suggest that PCV's are brave
and noble poverty-fighters in a
Venezuelan slum (with para
sites. for whatever that is
worth), and the activists are
lazy, superficially-c o m m i 11 ed

pickets (a show-off, I guess) is
being naive about both move
ments. Activists, like Peace
Corps volunteers, have their
phonies and their deeply com
mitted. I personally know and
admire a number of so-called
"student-activists", and the
Peace Corps recruiters only
have to talk to and not at some
SNCC and SDS workers to feel
their deep commitment and hu
manism. Further, their discon
tent with and alienation from
American society finds expres
sion in concrete attempts at
social, political, and educational
reform, of which picketing is
one valid form of expression.
I would also like to apologize
for what some Peace Corps re
cruiters seem to think an appro
priate and effective recruiting
"pitch". Apparently, the way to
attract volunteers is to scold stu
dents for being activists or for
being immature (re.the Harris
scalping). The alternative the
recruiters seem to be offering

is to go overseas, suffer, sacri
fice, and prove that you are a
man or woman. Even Coach Ral
ston probably knows enough
psychology to junk the Knute
Rockne, diefor-yourteam ap
proach. The Peace Corps is all
gi'own-up now, I guess, and it
finds listening to or talking with
another generation increasingly
difficult. Hopefully, the other ac
tivities planned will be more in
formative and on a higher in
tellectual level: The almost non
existent crowd at the rally ought
to suggest that students have
little time to listen to cliches
and naive statements about fel
low students or about solving
world problems.

• A Suggestion . . .
Editor, The Daily;
My friend, Willard S. Webber,
has shown me a copy of his No

vember 2 letter to you regarding
Mr. David Harris and his speech
at Ann Arbor. I agree thorough
ly.
Is there some way this in
creasingly poor joke can l)e
ended and Mr. Harris consigned
to the obscurity he so richly de
serves? In other words, do the
ASSU Constitution and by-laws
provide for recall from office of
student body presidents?

• Judgment
Editor, the Dally:
Our first reatcion upon seeing
the candid photograph of David
Harris in last Friday's Daily
was to notice the striking simi
larity between our president and
St. Bartholomew in Michelange
lo's fresco, The Last Judgment
This is our last judgment.
