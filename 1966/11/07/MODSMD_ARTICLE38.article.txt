"M" IS FOR THE MANY THINGS
YOU'LL TEACH HER
Nobody will dispute—surely not I—that raising children
is a task which requires full time and awesome skills.
Nonetheless, a recent nationwide survey has revealed a
startling fact: mothers who go back to work after their
children are safely through the early years are notably
happier, better adjusted, and more fulfilled than mothers
who simply remain housewives. Moreover—and mark this
well-the children of such working mothers are themselves
happier, better adjusted, and more fulfilled!
All very well, you say, but what's it got to do with you?
Isn't it obvious? If you are underachieving at college, get
your mother a job.
What kind of job? Well sir, your mother is probably
between 35 and 50 years of age, so certain occupations
must immediately be ruled out. Logging, for example. Or
whaling. Orcarhopping.
But don't despair. There are other kinds of jobs-not
many, to be sure, but some. However, you must not stick
Mom in just any old job. You must remember that after
the excitement of raising you, she would be bored to tears
as a file clerk, for instance, or as a dolman. (A dolman, as
we all know, is someone who brings of water to
track layers. With the recent invention of the pail, dolmen
are gradually falling into technological unemployment.)
But I digress. I was saying, find Mom a job worthy of
her talents, something challenging that uses her vast wis
dom and experience but, at the same time, is not too hard
on her obsolescing tissues. That's what Walter Sigafoos
did, and the results were brilliantly successful.
Walter, a sophomore at the Upper Maryland College of
Wickerwork and Belles Lettres, majoring in raffia, ap
proached the problem scientifically. First he asked himself
what his mother did best. Well sir. what she did best was
to keep hollering, "Dress warm, Walter!"
At first glance this seemed a skill not widely in demand,
but Walter was not discouraged. He sent out hundreds of
inquiries and today, I am pleased to report, his mother is
happily employed as wardrobe mistress for the Montreal
Canadiens.
Another fortunate venture was that of Frank C. Grans
mire, a junior at the Oregon State Conservatory of Music
and Optometry, majoring in sties. Frank, like Walter, did
a survey in depth of his mother's talents. Chief among
them, he found, was her ability to make a roast of beef
feed the whole family for three days. So, naturally, Frank
got her a job at the Museum of Natural History.
What has one to do with the other, you ask? Isn't it
obvious? Anyone who can stretch ribs like that belongs in
paleontology.

I cannot conclude this column without saying a few
words about Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades. The
reason I cannot is that this column is sponsored by the
makers of Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades, and
they are inclined to get peckish if I omit to mention their
product.
Not, mind you, that it is a chore for me to plug
Personna. Or, for the matter of that, to shave with
Personna. No sir: no chore. Personna takes the pain out
of shaving, scraps the scrape, negates the nick, repudiates
the rasp, peels the pull, boycotts the burn, blackballs the
bite, ousts the ouch. Furthermore, Personna endures and
abides, gives you luxury shave after luxury shave, day
after day after day. And further furthermore, Personna
is available both in double-edge style and Injector style.
And as if all this were not bounty enough, Personna is
now offering you a chance to grab a fistful of $100 bills!
Stop at your Personna dealer and get an entry blank for
the new Personna Super Stainless Steel Sweepstakes. But
hurry! Time is limited.
