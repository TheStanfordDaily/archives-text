# Phi Delta Theta House Up For Grabs ASSU Housing Comm. Offers Plan
## Vacated 
### ROBERT E. STONE 
At 5 p.m. yesterday the 43 members
of Phi Delta Kappa left their home
in the finst fraternity cluster. They
will not return for the remainder
of the academic year.
The Phi Delts were placed on sus
pension by the University last week.
Tho action was largely the result of
"misconduct" during an exchange
with Mills College on October 8.
The problem facing the administra
tion at the moment is what to do with
the empty house. According to Dean
Robert Gordon the University is los
ing $60 a day every day the house is
empty.
Experiment
The A.S.S.U. Housing Commission
has presented its own plan for use
of the house. In a letter dated Novem
ber 4, the commission proposed that
"the vacated Phi Delta Theta house

be used for an experiment in resi
dential education during the Winter
and Spring Quarters, 3967. This would
allow an opportunity to test a spe
cific set of proposals aimed at im
proving the quality of residential edu
cation at Stanford."
According to Jan Jacobi, Chairman
of the Housing Commission, the 50
places in the house would be filled
by six men and four women from
each class of the student body, in
cluding graduate students. Eight to

ten of these 50 would be foreign stu
dents.
Co-op Structure
In addition the "new" house would
be operated on a co op financial struc
ture. Financial plans are being drawn
up by Ed Shaw, Jon Roise and Mike
Couzens. According to Jacobi the co
op financial structure would mean
that the students would do their own
hashing and clean their own rooms.
Included in the Commission's rec
ommendations was a plan for a fac-

ulty resident as a participating mem
ber of the living group. Suggested
for this position was Doctor Mancall
of the History Department.
Other Suggestions
At the current time two other sug
gestions have been made for the use
of the empty house. The American
Field Service wants the house for a
foreign student residence. The sug
gestion has also been made that the
house could be put to excellent use as
a center for psychological study.
The final decision on the future of
the Phi Delt house will be made at
the next meeting of the Residence
Operating Committee. The date for
the meeting has not yet been set.
Jacobi feels that the minor problems
surrounding the Housing Commis
sion's proposal can be ironed out and
that the Committee will accept their
plan.

the empty house. According to Dean
Robert Gordon the University is los
ing $60 a day every day the house is
empty.
Experiment
The A.S.S.U. Housing Commission
has presented its own plan for use
of the house. In a letter dated Novem
ber 4, the commission proposed that
"the vacated Phi Delta Theta house

be used for an experiment in resi
dential education during the Winter
and Spring Quarters, 3967. This would
allow an opportunity to test a spe
cific set of proposals aimed at im
proving the quality of residential edu
cation at Stanford."
According to Jan Jacobi, Chairman
of the Housing Commission, the 50
places in the house would be filled
by six men and four women from
each class of the student body, in
cluding graduate students. Eight to

ten of these 50 would be foreign stu
dents.
Co-op Structure
In addition the "new" house would
be operated on a co op financial struc
ture. Financial plans are being drawn
up by Ed Shaw, Jon Roise and Mike
Couzens. According to Jacobi the co
op financial structure would mean
that the students would do their own
hashing and clean their own rooms.
Included in the Commission's rec
ommendations was a plan for a fac-

ulty resident as a participating mem
ber of the living group. Suggested
for this position was Doctor Mancall
of the History Department.
Other Suggestions
At the current time two other sug
gestions have been made for the use
of the empty house. The American
Field Service wants the house for a
foreign student residence. The sug
gestion has also been made that the
house could be put to excellent use as
a center for psychological study.
The final decision on the future of
the Phi Delt house will be made at
the next meeting of the Residence
Operating Committee. The date for
the meeting has not yet been set.
Jacobi feels that the minor problems
surrounding the Housing Commis
sion's proposal can be ironed out and
that the Committee will accept their
plan.

At 5 p.m. yesterday the 43 members
of Phi Delta Kappa left their home
in the finst fraternity cluster. They
will not return for the remainder
of the academic year.
The Phi Delts were placed on sus
pension by the University last week.
Tho action was largely the result of
"misconduct" during an exchange
with Mills College on October 8.
The problem facing the administra

the empty house. According to Dean
