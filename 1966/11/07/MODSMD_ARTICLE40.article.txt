# Housing Experiment
## 
### 
With the establishment of the ASSU Hous
ing Commission there has been much talk of
increasing the educational function of the Uni
versity residence system. While major changes
such as this are often discussed in detail by
the University community, there is generally
little opportunity to weigh the merits of a
proposed housing system beyond the level of
discussion and inference from the experience
of other colleges. The case of the last year's
introduction of a faculty-master program at Wil
bur Hall demonstrates the gap between paper
and practice in undertaking innovative housing
reforms.
The vacancy of the Phi Delta Theta house
offers the community an excellent opportunity
to experiment on a small scale with several
of the specific reforms now being discussed.
A Commission proposal presented to the Dean's
Office last Friday outlines a two-quarter experi
ment which could be initiated in January.
The Commission has recommended that the
house be organized as a coeducational resi
dence with graduate students and members of
each undergraduate class. The residence, which
accommodates fifty students in modern two
room suites, would house thirty men and twenty
women chosen on the basis of a draw. With
equal distribution among all the classes, the
environment of the living group would benefit
from the many perspectives and backgrounds
within the community.
The presence of a resident senior faculty
member as a participating member of the living
group would go beyond the relationship of
faculty residents, presently enjoyed only at Wil
bur and Stern, and approximately more closely
a faculty-master arrangement. Last year's ex
periment in Wilbur pointed up the impossibility
of one faculty member sharing his experience
with 720 students. Again there remains some
doubt if one facutly-master can effectively in
spire 250 students, which is the approximate
size of the Moore-Jacks Halls. The Commission's
experiment, with one faculty resident for fifty
students, would provide a bench mark for fu

ture ventures into the faculty-master living sys
tem.
Integration of freshmen with upperclassmen,
and even graduate students, is one of the central
points to be discussed in the Commission's final
report. If integration on a small scale proves suc
cessful for the students involved in the proposed
experiment, then the University might set its
sights to integrating large living units, includ
ing Wilbur, Stern, Florence Moore, and Lag
unita.
The University has a unique chance to test
some fresh approaches to residential education.
We would be greately disappointed if the Uni
versity chose to ignore this opportunity. For
the results of a six month experiment could un
cover many of the unforeseen problems inherent
in large scale innovations being considered for
the future, while at the same time reaffirming
the value of the residence in the educational
process.
