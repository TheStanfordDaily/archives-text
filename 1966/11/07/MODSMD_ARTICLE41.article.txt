We were greatly impressed by the insights
presented last night in the Student-Faculty
Board symposium, 'The Year of Change." Em
phasizing the personal side of man both in
dealing with the problems of the University
community and in dealing with the problems of
society, the program may have seemed anti
intellectual to some observers. However we
rather agree with the speakers that contempo
rary society, particularly the educated society
of a college campus, tends to intellectualize its
problems. And the resulting abstraction bears
little relation to the men who are involved.
Although it may seem paradoxical to attempt
to communicate personally on a mass level, we
are encouraged to see members of the commu
nity address themselves to this problem. Most
of the problems of our society lie not in the
technical complexities of our surroundings, but
rather in finding understanding among our fel
low man who wrestles with the problems.
