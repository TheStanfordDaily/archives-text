## 'Lukewarm' Cadet's Position 
### 
Editor, the Daily;
As a lukewarm (as opposed
to red-hot) ROTC cadet, I feel
it necessary to reply to Mr. Ben
nett's letter of Nov. 4, demand
ing that all ROTC cadets justify
their position, just all conscien
tious objectors are required to
justify theire. First of all, I
would like to try to clear up a
few misconceptions which Mr.
Bennett and many others have
about the ROTC program.
Contrary to popular opinion,
the five hundred plus cadets at
Stanford are not junior killers
who are being raised on a diet
of communist blood. I dare say
that we're just as cowardly as
the next guy. In fact, one of the
first things we learn in ROTC is
that bullets fly in two directions.
But one must surely realize that
there are numerous non-combat
ant positions in the armed for
ces. And as an ROTC graduate

one has a better chance of being
assigned to the unit of his
choice than the regular enlisted
man, draftee, or even the con
scientious objector who suddenly
finds out he isn't as conscien
tious as he thought when faced
with an offer for free room and
board at Leavenworth.
Mr. Bennett's accusations that
some of us may be in the pro
gram merely for riches and
glory reveal a lower opinion of
cadets than I had previously
thought possible. I was surprised
to discover that someone some
where does not think that I, as
a Stanford graduate, would not
be able to find any position,
other than in the army, which
pays the fantastic sum of three
hundred dollars a month. And
if he thinks that we love to wear
our uniforms to classes and
march around the soccer field
every week, he need only look at

our "smiling" faces to think
otherwise.
So why does a sound-minded,
able-bodied college male join the
ROTC program? Perhaps be
cause he is sound-minded and
able-bodied (and consequently
1-A). Perhaps because he recog
nizes the reality of the draft
laws in this country. And per
haps because he even feels that
it is his duty as a citizen of the
United States to contribute a
few years to his country. Sure
I realize that it's corny to talk
about God, mother, and country.
But why not? This is supposed
to be an age of non-conformity.

• Irritating Election
Editor, The Daily;
Thursday's report that the
Cardinals Board has not counted

the ballots for Wendy G. Wonka
for homecoming queen was irri
tating. In making such an arbi
trary decision the Cardinals
Board left no real choice for
students, who were never allow
ed to express whether they
WANTED a homecoming queen.
The institution of homecom
ing queen is one more ego-boost
er for Stanford Dollies, the ma
jority of whom are already self
centered and much over-rated.
I would like to know how
many votes Wendy received.
The true opinion of students
might be revealed.

Editor, The Daily;
Thursday's report that the
Cardinals Board has not counted

the ballots for Wendy G. Wonka
for homecoming queen was irri
tating. In making such an arbi
trary decision the Cardinals
Board left no real choice for
students, who were never allow
ed to express whether they
WANTED a homecoming queen.
The institution of homecom
ing queen is one more ego-boost
er for Stanford Dollies, the ma
jority of whom are already self
centered and much over-rated.
I would like to know how
many votes Wendy received.
The true opinion of students
might be revealed.

GEORGE BARDSLEY
Editor, the Daily;
As a lukewarm (as opposed
to red-hot) ROTC cadet, I feel
it necessary to reply to Mr. Ben
nett's letter of Nov. 4, demand
ing that all ROTC cadets justify
their position, just all conscien
tious objectors are required to
justify theire. First of all, I
would like to try to clear up a
few misconceptions which Mr.
Bennett and many others have
about the ROTC program.
Contrary to popular opinion,
the five hundred plus cadets at
Stanford are not junior killers
who are being raised on a diet
of communist blood. I dare say
that we're just as cowardly as
the next guy. In fact, one of the
first things we learn in ROTC is
that bullets fly in two directions.
But one must surely realize that
there are numerous non-combat
ant positions in the armed for
ces. And as an ROTC graduate

one has a better chance of being
assigned to the unit of his
choice than the regular enlisted
man, draftee, or even the con
scientious objector who suddenly
finds out he isn't as conscien
tious as he thought when faced
with an offer for free room and
board at Leavenworth.
Mr. Bennett's accusations that
some of us may be in the pro
gram merely for riches and
glory reveal a lower opinion of
cadets than I had previously
thought possible. I was surprised
to discover that someone some
where does not think that I, as
a Stanford graduate, would not
be able to find any position,
other than in the army, which
pays the fantastic sum of three
hundred dollars a month. And
if he thinks that we love to wear
our uniforms to classes and
march around the soccer field
every week, he need only look at

our "smiling" faces to think
otherwise.
So why does a sound-minded,
able-bodied college male join the
ROTC program? Perhaps be
cause he is sound-minded and
able-bodied (and consequently
1-A). Perhaps because he recog
nizes the reality of the draft
laws in this country. And per
haps because he even feels that
it is his duty as a citizen of the
United States to contribute a
few years to his country. Sure
I realize that it's corny to talk
about God, mother, and country.
