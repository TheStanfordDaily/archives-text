## Long Range '68 Forecast: Bobby Must Dump HHH 
### William F. Buckley, Jr 
Mr. Richard Nixon has divulg
ed his analysis of the relation
ship of political forces, and com
ing as it does from an old pro,
it is worth meditating. Robert
Kennedy, says Mr. Nixon, is go
ing to have to arrange to be rid
of Hubert Humphrey in 1968,
and to take his place as vice
presidential candidate, if he
wants to be sure of the presi
dential nomination in 1972.
The reason is that if Humph
rey is renominated and serves
as vice-president, he will prob
ably, says Mr. Nixon who ought
to know — but very possibly
doesn't — accumulate enough
power to dominate the Demo
cratic Convention in 1972. If
that happens, Senator Bobby is
out at least until 1976 (if Hum
phrey loses), and possibly until
1980 (if Humphrey wins); by
which time even Bobby will be
getting on and, who knows, may
have lost his appeal to the na
tion's youth.
The analysis is presumably
based on its author's experience
as vice-president. For a while, in
the summer and fall of 1955, and
again in 1959, Mr. Nixon was
wondering whether he would be
ditched by President Eisen
hower. He nevertheless discov
ered that barring determined
opposition from General Eisen
hower — which hadn't happened
to anybody since the Nazis —
Nixon could count on getting
the nomination for himself. The

reasoning was ratified by Rocke
feller's dramatic withdrawal as
a candidate during Christmas
week of 1959.
Nothing 1 Like Him
But in 1959-1960 there was no
counterpart to Bobby Kennedy.
(As a matter of fact, in the his
tory of politics there has been
no counterpart to Bobby Ken
nedy.) Rockefeller had a certain
metropolital popularity, and as
a bigspender was always worth
watching. But he was hardly
mountainous, in the way Robert
is. Sixteen-year-old girls had
been known to pass by Rocke
feller without fainting, whereas
no such thing has even been re
corded about Kennedy. The laws
of American politics are not so
mechanized that one can pre
dict, with any certainty, that
the experience of Richard Nixon
as vice-president will be the ex
perience of future vice-presi
dents.
Harvev Lee Oswald broke a
law in Dallas, and the political
reverberations will alter tradi
tional political formulations for
a very long while.
Even so. Mr. Nixon's analysis
remains interesting, and '68-
watchers have pricked up their
ears to look for signs. Mr. Nixon
fue l * his own analysis by apply
ing it at everv onDortunity. He
told the voters of Minnesota last
Tuesdav that if the Republicans
there did w«ll, and Mr. Rnlvaag
was defeated, Humphrey's
throne would crack. Take a
statement like that by a politi
cian and multiply it, mutatis
mutandis, a thousand times —
and Humphrey will weaken, if
onlv because he is held so often
to be fragile.
Convincing Repetition
It's the old business of telling
your wife she doesn't look well.
Say it often enough and in due
course she will fall ill. Humph
rey will not willingly step down,
and Johnson will not willingly
yield to pressures to replace
him, especially not by a member
of the royal family that once
disdained him. But pressures are
being mounted, and politicians
are made to succumb to pres
sures.
It is interesting to meditate on
Mr. Nixon's own interest in the
developing situation. As things
now stand it will be he who will
run in 1968. One supposes that
he would greatly prefer a John
son-Humphrey ticket to run
against, that a Johnson-Kennery
ticket. Who wouldn't. Why then
should he give public lessons to
Bobby Kennedy on how to pro
ceed if he desires to become
President? You figure it. I have,
and the analysis is not pub
lishable.
