# Floods Hit Florence; No Word From Villa
## 
### KIRK HANSON Managing Editor 
Florence and the Province of Tus
cany this weekend took the brunt of
the worst floods in Italy since the
Middle Ages. Florence, the greatest
world center of art and the location
of a Stanford overseas campus, was
inundated to a depth of six to ten feet
throughout most of the city.
Virtually all communication with
Florence was severed and late last
night overseas campus officials here
still had been unable to contact Villa
San Paolo, the Stanford residence.
However, Mrs. Hersche Allen, ad
ministrative assistant in the Over
seas Campus Program, informed The
Daily she learned last night from the
State Department there are no known
American deaths in Florence.
Villa On High Ground
The Villa is located on high ground
on the outskirts of the city about
two miles from the raging Arno
River. Large sections of the city have

been without water and electricity
during the last few days.
The waters desolated large areas
of central Italy from Venice south
almost to Rome. Florence and Venice
were the hardest hit. Venice yesterday
lay stunned and slime-covered as the
flood waters began to subside.
Dr. Robert A. Walker, Director of
the Overseas Campus Program, ar
rived in Tours at Stanford-in-France
Friday and is scheduled to go to Flor
ence on November 17 to hold the
three day meeting of the Overseas
Campus Directors. He was unavail
able for comment yesterday.
Ponte Vecchio Damaged
In Florence the Arno River swept
over the 14th century Ponte Vecchio,
destroying many of the goldsmith
shops that lined it and hung from its
sides. Water poured into the Piazza
del Duomo and into the Florence Ca
thedral itself.
Saturday water stood three feet
deep between the Duomo and the
Baptistry, wht.'e Ghiberti's famous
doors, the "gates of paradise", stand.
The doors were damaged and five
of the panels depicting Biblical scenes
were loosened or knocked off.
Perhaps the greatest damage was
done to the Ufizzi galleries, where
eight thousand paintings stored i"n
the basement were badly damaged.
The Ufizzi is on the Arno and flood
waters peaked just a few feet below
the third floor rooms housing the
finest collection of Renaissance paint
ings.
The 15th century Strozzi Palace was
badly damaged. All the furnishings
and Renaissance weapons inside the
Bargello Museum were covered by
mud. The wine producing region
around Florence was particularly
hard hit.
Over Hundred Dead
Italian officials fear that more than
one hundred persons may have died
in the floods. Many apparently were
cripples who drowned as flood waters
invaded Florence. More than forty
others were killed as the storm
crossed Europe.
Hundreds of homeless Florentines
huddled inside the Basilica of Santa
Croce, amongst the tombs of Michel
angelo, Machiavelli, Galileo, and other
Reniassance giants.
Late yesterday a new storm was
dumping more water into the swollen
streams and they began to rise again.
The waters had subsided Sunday in
Florence back into the reinforced
banks of the Arno.
