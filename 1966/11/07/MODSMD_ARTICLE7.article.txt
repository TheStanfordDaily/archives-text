# Jacobi Quits Position
## 
### 
University Housing Commission
Chairman Jan Jacobi announced his
resignation Saturday in a letter to
ASSU President Dave Harris.
Jacobi cited pressing personal in
volvements for rendering him tempo
rarily unable to provide the "force
ful intellectual and political leader
ship necessary for the Housing Com
mission to continue its work."
Harris was on a speaking tour of
the East and could not be reached
for comment.
Jacobi will be replaced by junior
Social Thought major, John Trimbur.
Trimbur's nomination faces approval
by LASSU, before becoming official.
In recommending Trimbur, cur
rently a Wilbur sponsor, Jacobi added:
"I know that as an individual he will
be able to give the Commission the
intellectual leadership and drive that
it will truly need in the coming
months."
Jacobi expressed disappointment in
the work of the fraternity sub-com
mittee. "I had hope that we could sit
down and critically and objectively
examine fraternities within the con
text of education. I regret the time we
have lost in petty political squabbles,
but I think this group will be able to
issue a report by the end of the quar
ter."
"I had looked forward to giving
the . . . best of my efforts in attempt
ing to rectify what I consider to be

a housing system that is appallingly
in need of change."
Jacobi indicated a need for total
overhaul of the housing system if it
is "ever to achieve the goal of Stan
ford as an educational community—
with as much of that education com
ing from the residence as the lecture
hall."
Jacobi indicated that a sub-com
mittee on the philosophy of the resi
dence university headed by Mike
Couzens and Jon Roise will have is
sued its report by December 1.
Sub-Committee reports on Indepen
dent Men's Housing, and Domen's
weeks.
Jacobi took time in his letter to
address some sentiments to Harris.
"But one thing further: . . . you have
truly given the intellectual leadership
of this community (and especially the
Freshman Class) the opportunity to
examine Stanford as it must be ex
amined—from the central question of
education, and Stanford as an educa
tional community. If it is ever to be
come one it must honestly face the
questions you have raised and that
no one before you publicly brought
forth."
In related developments, Jacobi an
nounced the appointment of Stewart
Pur key, Peter Ready, and Geoffrey
Smith to the fraternity sub-committee,
and Joel Kugelmass' decision to step
down as co-chairman of same. Kugel
mass will continue as a member of
the committee.
