# Miss Teenage America Wants Engineering Major At Stanford
## NEWS IN BRIEF 
### 
DALLAS, Tex.—Seventeen-year-old Sandy Roberts
from Milpitas, California, candidate-at-large, who
entered the Miss Teenage America Contest "just
to see if I could do it!" won the title Saturday night.
With her $10,000 scholarship, Sandy will study
engineering at Stanford University—that is, if she
makes up the college board exam she missed while
winning the teen queen crown Saturday.

audience—and the 64 Texas A&M University cadets
on stage—with a wriggling "puka puka pants"
hula, wearing hip-hugging bermudas and a match
ing halter. She learned the hula in Hawaii while
her father, Robert N. Roberts, was in military ser
vice.

NEW DELHI—An application by V. K. Krishna

The decision was taken Saturday by the election

wake of the Communist Chinese knockout of the
Indian army in 1962, when Krishna Menon was
fired as defense minister—he is adored in leftist

circles of the governing congress party and by
some pro-Moscow communists.

• Krishna Menon Denied Candidacy
NEW DELHI—An application by V. K. Krishna
Menon to stand for parliament from Bombay in
the February general elections has been rejected.
The decision was taken Saturday by the election
committee of the Bombay State Branch of the gov
erning Congress Party. Informants said the de
cision was unanimous and the committee gave as
a reason that claims of local aspirants should be
given preference over Menon, who is from Kerala
State.
Although he is a much-hated figure in some cir
cles in India—so much hated than even Prime Min
ister Jawaharlal Nehru could not save him in the
wake of the Communist Chinese knockout of the
Indian army in 1962, when Krishna Menon was
fired as defense minister—he is adored in leftist

circles of the governing congress party and by
some pro-Moscow communists.

makes up the college board exam she missed while
winning the teen queen crown Saturday.
The brunette 5-foot-6-inch beauty entranced the
audience—and the 64 Texas A&M University cadets

• Krishna Menon Denied Candidacy
NEW DELHI—An application by V. K. Krishna
Menon to stand for parliament from Bombay in
the February general elections has been rejected.
The decision was taken Saturday by the election
committee of the Bombay State Branch of the gov

cision was unanimous and the committee gave as
a reason that claims of local aspirants should be
given preference over Menon, who is from Kerala
State.
Although he is a much-hated figure in some cir
cles in India—so much hated than even Prime Min
ister Jawaharlal Nehru could not save him in the
wake of the Communist Chinese knockout of the
Indian army in 1962, when Krishna Menon was
fired as defense minister—he is adored in leftist

circles of the governing congress party and by
some pro-Moscow communists.
