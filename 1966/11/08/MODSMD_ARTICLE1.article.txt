# Flexible Self-Designed Majors Suggested
## 
### BOBBIE CONLAN 
Self-styled or self-designed majors is an
idea that is floating around the Stanford cam
pus, but no one seems to be doing anything
concrete about it.
Tracing its origins or finding out who is In
charge of it is like chasing an ephemera.
Professor Robert Wert, former Dean of
Undergraduate Education and chairman of
the Committee on Undergraduate Education,
recalls bringing up the idea three years ago,
but has heard nothing much about it since.
What the idea would entail is a liberalizing
or loosening up of departmental major require
ments as well as a revision of general studies
requirements.
Design Own Major
No one has the mechanics of such a proposal
worked out, but Robert Hind, associate dean
of Undergraduate Education, volunteered
what seemed to be the general consensus.
"It would be a system where students could
design their own major with the help of an
advisor, then justify and explain the program

of study to some sort of faculty reviewing
board.
"Theoretically," he said, "students could do
this at any time during their college years."
Robert Sears, Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences, said he first heard about self-styled ma
jors at the Asilomar Conference this summer.
Cross-disciplinary Interests
"I think it would be well worth considering,"
he said, "to see how much flexibility we will be
able to get into the major program. It would
be especially good for people with cross
disciplinary interests and plans."
Tim Haight, a student who attended the
Asilomar Conference, felt that the present lack
of flexibility leads to a lack of commitment in
students.
"If restrictions and requirements are forced,
there's no internal development," he said. "It
seems that (under the present system) in order
to truly get at problems relevant to a stu
dent's academic desires, he has to cut across
disciplinary lines."
Haight felt that three arguments for a

change to self-styled majors system were: 1)
it would provide more motivation and com
mitment; 21 it would allow for the crossing
of disciplinary lines; and 3) it would allow
students to use the disciplines as a means to
study problems, rather than using problems
as examples within disciplines.
One committee is in existence now and an
other in the process of being formed, either
or both of which may be able to make recom
mendations pertaining to this proposal.
In September of this year, the General
Studies Committee met to discuss the Goals
for General Education at Stanford in the Next
Decade. Commonly called the Next Decade
Study, it makes up Phase II of an extensive
program begun in 1963.
The self-styled majors idea came up in
passing at this meeting.
An Experiment
Peter Dahl, assistant to the Director of
General Studies, said that to his knowledge
the idea has not been explored further and
it may or may not appear in the committee's
final report.

"The idea was suggested as an experiment,"
Dahl said, "and I have no objection to experi
ments. But I don't think the University is pre
pared to move in this direction (towards self
designed majors) until the experiment proves
itself."
"If the idea is tried at all, its effectiveness
would have to be scrutinized carefully," he
said.
The first draft of the General Studies Com
mittee's report has been made available to
the now-forming Committee on Undergraduate
Education.
Whether or not it contained any reference
to this idea Dahl didn't know.
Dissatisfaction With Science
Much of the current dissatisfaction with the
General Studies Program focuses on the sci
ence requirement.
Both Dahl and Dean Hind recognized this
resentment, but neither felt the requirement
would be done away with altogether.
"I suspect that they (students allowed to
design their own majors) will fall into patterns
and develop criteria," Hind said.

If the aim of this type of program is to give
students a broader liberal education, allow
ing them to dabble where they are not now al
lowed to dabble, then a conscientious effort to
attain this goal would cover the same subjects
now required, Hind said.
Requirement Resented
"The resentment now is that it is required.
Most people would agree that some exposure
to science is desirable," he said. "But this dis
content brings up the question is a lab re
quirement sacred?"
Hind felt that the General Studies Commit
tee's report, when it becomes available, should
be discussed widely.
"I am very much in favor of the idea (of
self-styled majors)," Hind said, "but it hasn't
been thought through and no details have been
worked out.
"Whether it can survive the mechanics re
quired to carry it out I wouldn't want to pre
dict right now."

still floating around the Stanford campus.

lowed to dabble, then a conscientious effort to
attain this goal would cover the same subjects
now required, Hind said.
Requirement Resented
"The resentment now is that it is required.
Most people would agree that some exposure
to science is desirable," he said. "But this dis
content brings up the question is a lab re
quirement sacred?"
Hind felt that the General Studies Commit
tee's report, when it becomes available, should
be discussed widely.
"I am very much in favor of the idea (of
self-styled majors)," Hind said, "but it hasn't
been thought through and no details have been
worked out.
"Whether it can survive the mechanics re
quired to carry it out I wouldn't want to pre
dict right now."
Meanwhile, self-designed majors is an idea
still floating around the Stanford campus.
Self-styled or self-designed majors is an
idea that is floating around the Stanford cam
pus, but no one seems to be doing anything
concrete about it.
Tracing its origins or finding out who is In
charge of it is like chasing an ephemera.
Professor Robert Wert, former Dean of
Undergraduate Education and chairman of
the Committee on Undergraduate Education,
recalls bringing up the idea three years ago,
but has heard nothing much about it since.
What the idea would entail is a liberalizing
or loosening up of departmental major require
ments as well as a revision of general studies
requirements.
Design Own Major
No one has the mechanics of such a proposal
worked out, but Robert Hind, associate dean
of Undergraduate Education, volunteered
what seemed to be the general consensus.
"It would be a system where students could
design their own major with the help of an
advisor, then justify and explain the program

of study to some sort of faculty reviewing
board.
"Theoretically," he said, "students could do
this at any time during their college years."
Robert Sears, Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences, said he first heard about self-styled ma
jors at the Asilomar Conference this summer.
Cross-disciplinary Interests
"I think it would be well worth considering,"
he said, "to see how much flexibility we will be
able to get into the major program. It would
be especially good for people with cross
disciplinary interests and plans."
Tim Haight, a student who attended the
Asilomar Conference, felt that the present lack
of flexibility leads to a lack of commitment in
students.
"If restrictions and requirements are forced,
there's no internal development," he said. "It
seems that (under the present system) in order
to truly get at problems relevant to a stu
dent's academic desires, he has to cut across
disciplinary lines."
Haight felt that three arguments for a

change to self-styled majors system were: 1)
it would provide more motivation and com
mitment; 21 it would allow for the crossing
of disciplinary lines; and 3) it would allow
students to use the disciplines as a means to
study problems, rather than using problems
as examples within disciplines.
One committee is in existence now and an
other in the process of being formed, either
or both of which may be able to make recom
mendations pertaining to this proposal.
In September of this year, the General
Studies Committee met to discuss the Goals
for General Education at Stanford in the Next
Decade. Commonly called the Next Decade
Study, it makes up Phase II of an extensive
program begun in 1963.
The self-styled majors idea came up in
passing at this meeting.
An Experiment
Peter Dahl, assistant to the Director of
General Studies, said that to his knowledge
the idea has not been explored further and
it may or may not appear in the committee's
final report.

"The idea was suggested as an experiment,"
Dahl said, "and I have no objection to experi
ments. But I don't think the University is pre
pared to move in this direction (towards self
designed majors) until the experiment proves
itself."
"If the idea is tried at all, its effectiveness
would have to be scrutinized carefully," he
said.
The first draft of the General Studies Com
mittee's report has been made available to
the now-forming Committee on Undergraduate
Education.
Whether or not it contained any reference
to this idea Dahl didn't know.
Dissatisfaction With Science
Much of the current dissatisfaction with the
General Studies Program focuses on the sci
ence requirement.
Both Dahl and Dean Hind recognized this
resentment, but neither felt the requirement
would be done away with altogether.
"I suspect that they (students allowed to
design their own majors) will fall into patterns
and develop criteria," Hind said.

students a broader liberal education, allow

designed majors) until the experiment proves
itself."
"If the idea is tried at all, its effectiveness
would have to be scrutinized carefully," he
said.
The first draft of the General Studies Com
mittee's report has been made available to
the now-forming Committee on Undergraduate
Education.
Whether or not it contained any reference
to this idea Dahl didn't know.
Dissatisfaction With Science
Much of the current dissatisfaction with the
General Studies Program focuses on the sci
ence requirement.
Both Dahl and Dean Hind recognized this
resentment, but neither felt the requirement
would be done away with altogether.
"I suspect that they (students allowed to
design their own majors) will fall into patterns
and develop criteria," Hind said.

If the aim of this type of program is to give
students a broader liberal education, allow
ing them to dabble where they are not now al
lowed to dabble, then a conscientious effort to
attain this goal would cover the same subjects
now required, Hind said.
Requirement Resented
"The resentment now is that it is required.
Most people would agree that some exposure
to science is desirable," he said. "But this dis
content brings up the question is a lab re
quirement sacred?"
Hind felt that the General Studies Commit
tee's report, when it becomes available, should
be discussed widely.
"I am very much in favor of the idea (of
self-styled majors)," Hind said, "but it hasn't
been thought through and no details have been
worked out.
"Whether it can survive the mechanics re
quired to carry it out I wouldn't want to pre
dict right now."
Meanwhile, self-designed majors is an idea
still floating around the Stanford campus.
Self-styled or self-designed majors is an
idea that is floating around the Stanford cam
pus, but no one seems to be doing anything
concrete about it.
Tracing its origins or finding out who is In
charge of it is like chasing an ephemera.
Professor Robert Wert, former Dean of
Undergraduate Education and chairman of
the Committee on Undergraduate Education,
recalls bringing up the idea three years ago,
but has heard nothing much about it since.
What the idea would entail is a liberalizing
or loosening up of departmental major require
ments as well as a revision of general studies
requirements.
Design Own Major
No one has the mechanics of such a proposal
worked out, but Robert Hind, associate dean
of Undergraduate Education, volunteered
what seemed to be the general consensus.
"It would be a system where students could
design their own major with the help of an
advisor, then justify and explain the program

of study to some sort of faculty reviewing
board.
"Theoretically," he said, "students could do
this at any time during their college years."
Robert Sears, Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences, said he first heard about self-styled ma
jors at the Asilomar Conference this summer.
Cross-disciplinary Interests
"I think it would be well worth considering,"
he said, "to see how much flexibility we will be
able to get into the major program. It would
be especially good for people with cross
disciplinary interests and plans."
Tim Haight, a student who attended the
Asilomar Conference, felt that the present lack
of flexibility leads to a lack of commitment in
students.
"If restrictions and requirements are forced,
there's no internal development," he said. "It
seems that (under the present system) in order
to truly get at problems relevant to a stu
dent's academic desires, he has to cut across
disciplinary lines."
Haight felt that three arguments for a

change to self-styled majors system were: 1)
it would provide more motivation and com
mitment; 21 it would allow for the crossing
of disciplinary lines; and 3) it would allow
students to use the disciplines as a means to
study problems, rather than using problems
as examples within disciplines.
One committee is in existence now and an
other in the process of being formed, either
or both of which may be able to make recom
mendations pertaining to this proposal.
In September of this year, the General
Studies Committee met to discuss the Goals
for General Education at Stanford in the Next
Decade. Commonly called the Next Decade
Study, it makes up Phase II of an extensive
program begun in 1963.
The self-styled majors idea came up in
passing at this meeting.
An Experiment
Peter Dahl, assistant to the Director of
General Studies, said that to his knowledge
the idea has not been explored further and
it may or may not appear in the committee's
final report.

"The idea was suggested as an experiment,"
Dahl said, "and I have no objection to experi
ments. But I don't think the University is pre
pared to move in this direction (towards self
designed majors) until the experiment proves
itself."
"If the idea is tried at all, its effectiveness
would have to be scrutinized carefully," he
said.

mittee's report has been made available to
