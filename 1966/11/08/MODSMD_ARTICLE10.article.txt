# Nation's Coeds Enjoying More Liberal Social Regs
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, D.C. (CPS)
—Colleges and universities are
granting more liberal social reg
ulations to women.
This fall ,the University of
Massachusetts abolished a 11
women's hours, and the Univer
sity of Oregon did likewise for
its sophomores and juniors. For
several years, seniors and wom
en over 21 have had this privi
lege at Oregon.
All upperclassmen at the Uni
versity of Utah are now eligible
for keys to the dorms, but only
if they achieve a 2.5 average
(out of 4.0).
The University of Illinois will
experiment this fall with un
limited hours and key privilege
for seniors. If the system is
successful, the loosened regula

tions will extend to juniors and
women over 21.
Women at the University of
Pennsylvania, tired of rushing
back to their dormitories at two
minutes to twelve because they
forgot to sign out, have initiated
a trial system of telephone sign
outs for lates.
Formerly girls had to sign
out personally for lates which
could extend to 1:30 a.m. on
weekdays and 2:15 on Satur
days. Now a girl may call her
dormitory and request someone
to sign her out for those hours.
A girl does not have to sign out
at any time prior to midnight.
Although women must regis
ter their destination with house
proctors in case of emergency,
signout cards are placed in an

envelope and not opened unless
necessary.
Last year, the Penn adminis
tration allowed senior women to
set their own weekend curfews.
Seniors do not have keys, but
ask a friend to wait for their
return.
At the University of Rochester
every class votes on its own
curfews.
After a long battle to allow
men in the rooms, women at
Smith College can now entertain
their male friends from two to
five on Sunday afternoons. Doors
have to be open six inches, and
three feet must be on the floor.
And at the University of
Georgia, administrators are just
now allowing women to visit
men's apartments.
