# KZSU To Provide Continuous Returns
## 
### 
KZSU will participate in a
unique nation-wide coverage to
night. The program, beginning
at 6 p.m. and continuing until at
least midnight, will make exten
sive use of professors who are
experts in political analysis from
Stanford and the University of
California.
KZSU's News Director, Mai
MacKenzie, said that KZSU
would be one of eight California
radio stations to broadcast a
continuous coverage "of all ma
jor national elections, with spe

cific emphasis on California."
Although most of KZSU's 25-
man news team will be at thi-
University of California in
Berkeley — election central for
the network — several report
ers will provide direct voting
results on local county elections
from polling headquarters in
San Mateo and Santa Clar.i
counties.
KZSU will reserve the half
hour to thirty-five minute seg
ment of each hour for results on
these local races.
