Dave Lewis fades back to pass with only seconds
remaining in the first half of the Stanford-Air
Force game. Defensive right end John Hyden ap
plies pressure, hut Lewis uncorked a 55 yard pass
to end Bob Conrad, who collected the ball at the
10 yard line and scored Stanford's second touch
down. This play was the first of Lewis' heroics
against the Falcons, which earned him the honor
as Back of the Game.
