# Arroyo Meets Madera For Wilbur Leadership Today
## 
### 
Two fine freshman football
teams and what is expected to be
a generous portion of Wilbur
Hall will gather at intramural
field at 5 p.m. when Arroyo and
Madera meet to decide the Wil
bur championship.

With both teams unbeaten up
to press time yesterday and des
tined for playoff spots, the game
appears a toss up. Madera has
been the more explosive of the
two, rolling up scores of 40 and
66 to nothing, while Arroyo has

relied on a solid defense and an
opportunistic offense to keep five
opponents at bay.
In two other important games,
Phi Kap, which has remained
unbeaten without really rolling
over anyone, faces an A.T.O.
team which has lost two straight
after an impressive start, and
Theta Xi takes on the Delts,
with the winner having an inside
track to a league title.
Kappa Alpha and Alpha Delt
will take shots at each other's
perfect eight-point record in a
key third-round billiards match
at 7 p.m.
Intramural bowlers try to un
tangle a four-way tie for first
place in this afternoon's league,
in which four teams have identi
cal 9-3 records. A similar knot
occurs in the Friday league, with
four teams deadlocked at 8-4.
Top season marks include a
269 game, 469 series, and 209
average for Ralph Kimball, a
710 average and 12-0 record for
his El Toro team, and an 831
game and 1532 series for the
Rennods.
