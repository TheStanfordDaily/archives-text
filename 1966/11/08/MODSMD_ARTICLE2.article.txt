## Florentine Flood Italian Students Safe 
### BOB DAVIS 
All members of Stanford's Italian
campus have been reported "safe and
well," according to a special call re
ceived yesterday by the Overseas
Campus Office from the State Depart
ment in Washington.
Northern Italy, and especially Flor
ence where the campus is located,
reeled under the impact of severe
flooding this weekend. At least 20
persons were known dead in the city
as the toll for the nation rose to 180.
The Overseas Office placed a phone
call to Florence last Friday morning,
but has not been able to reach the
campus directly. Telephone lines in
the vicinity of Florence have not been
repaired yet.
Aware Of Concern
Mrs. Hersche Allen, administrative
assistant for the Overseas Campus
Program, stated, "The directors at
Stanford-in-Italy undoubtedly have
been in touch with the American Em
bassy and are aware of our inquiries
through the State Department."
Late wire service reports indicated
today that the Villa San Paolo now
has limited water from its own wells,
sufficient food, and electricity. The
heating system is out temporarily.
Weeping Florentines yesterday dug
through mud, trying to rescue art
treasures in the receding afterwash
of the worst flood in about seven cen
turies. Many of the city's 440,000 resi
dents remained dependent on disin
fected flood water, and some battled
over buckets of it in the Piazza della
Sighoria.

From their hillside villa Stanford
students could watch the Arno River
swell its banks and rush in torrents
into Italy's beautiful art center.
Stanford students were reportedly
helping salvage soaked ancient manu
scripts at the national archives with
125 Florida State University students.
Mrs. Allen said that she has re
ceived reports of Stanford students
helping with the rescue and general
clean-up operations. "We probably

won't have students sitting in classes
if they can be of assistance in the city.
It all depends on where they are
needed most," Mrs. Allen said.
Meeting: Still Slated
The Overseas Campus Office has
not yet heard from Director Robert
A. Walker, who is scheduled to be
in Tours, France. Mrs. Allen believed
that the meeting for all the campus
directors would still take place in
Florence on November 17.
Assistant Director of the Overseas
Program Bob Hamrdla stated, "We
see no reason why our students in
Florence would not be cooperating as
much as possible with the authorities.
Now that our primary concern for the
health and welfare of the students has
been eased, we are certain that fac
ulty, staff, and students will work

together to alleviate as many of the
problems as they can.
"We will not give up our efforts, how
ever, to contact the Villa directly," he
concluded.


From the Villa San Paolo, Stanford-In-Italy students can look down on the
damage done by the flood waters of the Amo River in Florence. All 88 students
are reported safe.

concluded.


From the Villa San Paolo, Stanford-In-Italy students can look down on the
damage done by the flood waters of the Amo River in Florence. All 88 students
are reported safe.
All members of Stanford's Italian
campus have been reported "safe and
well," according to a special call re
ceived yesterday by the Overseas
Campus Office from the State Depart
ment in Washington.
Northern Italy, and especially Flor
ence where the campus is located,
reeled under the impact of severe
flooding this weekend. At least 20
persons were known dead in the city
as the toll for the nation rose to 180.
The Overseas Office placed a phone
call to Florence last Friday morning,
but has not been able to reach the
campus directly. Telephone lines in
the vicinity of Florence have not been
repaired yet.
Aware Of Concern
Mrs. Hersche Allen, administrative
assistant for the Overseas Campus
Program, stated, "The directors at
Stanford-in-Italy undoubtedly have
been in touch with the American Em
bassy and are aware of our inquiries
through the State Department."
Late wire service reports indicated
today that the Villa San Paolo now
has limited water from its own wells,
sufficient food, and electricity. The
heating system is out temporarily.
Weeping Florentines yesterday dug
through mud, trying to rescue art
treasures in the receding afterwash
of the worst flood in about seven cen
turies. Many of the city's 440,000 resi
dents remained dependent on disin
fected flood water, and some battled
over buckets of it in the Piazza della
Sighoria.
Students View Torrent
From their hillside villa Stanford
students could watch the Arno River
swell its banks and rush in torrents
into Italy's beautiful art center.
Stanford students were reportedly
helping salvage soaked ancient manu
scripts at the national archives with
125 Florida State University students.
Mrs. Allen said that she has re
ceived reports of Stanford students
helping with the rescue and general
clean-up operations. "We probably

won't have students sitting in classes
if they can be of assistance in the city.
It all depends on where they are
needed most," Mrs. Allen said.
Meeting: Still Slated
The Overseas Campus Office has
not yet heard from Director Robert
A. Walker, who is scheduled to be
in Tours, France. Mrs. Allen believed
that the meeting for all the campus
directors would still take place in
Florence on November 17.
Assistant Director of the Overseas
Program Bob Hamrdla stated, "We
see no reason why our students in
Florence would not be cooperating as
much as possible with the authorities.
Now that our primary concern for the
health and welfare of the students has
been eased, we are certain that fac
ulty, staff, and students will work

together to alleviate as many of the
problems as they can.
"We will not give up our efforts, how
ever, to contact the Villa directly," he
concluded.
