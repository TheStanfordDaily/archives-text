# Trainer Tapes Team Together; Victories Cost $18 Per Ice Bag

### NICK SELBY 
Dave Lewis gets a pitchout
from Gene Washington, stops,
sets, and fires a long bomb to
Bob Conrad good for 61 yards
and a touchdown. The score is
the key play in the Stanford win
over Air Force 21-6.
Most Stanford fans are com
pletely unaware of the true
story behind this exciting action
on the field. The true story lies
hidden in the green and white
rooms of the Stanford training
quarters in Encina Gymnasium
and the talented therapy of head
trainer David 'Doc' Blanchard.
Needed Heat Treatment
. .The entire week before the
game Lewis had been visiting the
Stanford training quarters for
heat treatments on his left shoul
der, which had been badly
strained in the Washington
game. Lewis sat patiently while
Blanchard adjusted the voltage
for the 20 minute treatment.
Lewis used that left shoulder
to good advantage the play be
fore the touchdown when he ran
for a first down. He dropped his
left shoulder into the Falcon de
fender to get the last feet.
If he had been unable to use
the shoulder, he might have been
short of the first down and Stan
ford wouldn't have scored.
To Throw A Wonder
The fact that Lewis threw the
ball at all is a wonder. Earlier
in the season, he was unable to
lift his right arm after another
shoulder injury. Blanchard's
treatments and strengthening
exercises gradually brought the
shou'der back into shape.
'Doc' Blanchard is now in his
second year as head trainer of
athletes at Stanford. Previously,
he was head trainer at San Jose
State and assistant trainer at
Stanford. He and his assistant,
Dennis Channing, who is in his
first year at Stanford, put in ten
hours each day caring for the in
jured.
Ten Hour Day
The day starts at 8:30 when
the two treat injuries. In the
training quarters are three whirl
pool baths, one bathtub for soak
ing, one short-wave diathermy,
an ultra-sonic messager, and a
hydrotherapy machine which
shoots hot and cold water at
the sore spot.
Blanchand and Channing, who
are both licensed physical thera
pists in California, are confident
that they have all they need to
keep the athletes sound. The
two work closely with Dr. Frede

rick L. Behling in treating the
injuries.
Consult Doctor
In all cases concerning sprains,
nerve spasms, and muscle pulls,
the two trainers consult the doc
tor and keep a close record on
the recovery process. Bruises
and abrasions are handled rou
tinely.
The injury treatments con
tinue throughout the day, but
slack off toward one o'clock.
During the five morning hours,
the trainers see runners with
sore feet, give steam packs to
basketball players with bad
backs, and put ice on the sore
necks of wrestlers.
Taping Costs $54
At one o'clock, the trainers be
gin taping operations. In the
next three hours, they use three
speed packs with 32 rolls of tape
(each speed pack costs $18), tap
ing approximately 150 ankles,
knees, and pulled muscles.
Marty Brill, a defensive line
backer, has at times been taped
from neck to toes. The tape
helped Brill play with sore shoul
ders and ribs, a pulled ham
string muscle, a weak knee and
weak ankles.
The number of tapings drops

radically at the end of football
season, but the overall work of
the two trainers doesn't. Blanc
hard and Channing help super
vise meals and plan weight-lift
ing programs, plus treating the
athletes injured in other sports.
Blanchard believes strength is
the key to success in sports con
tests. "It may not allow you to
perform a skill better, but it al
lows you to perform it well over
a long period of time."
From 4 to 5:30, Blanchard
joins the football team at prac
tice, Channing stays in the train
ing room, and, if everyone stays
healthy, has a few moments to

relax. But if an athlete is hurt,
he really has to hustle.
Elevation, Compression
The most important things the
trainers do in the case of an
injury (for example, a sprained
ankle) is to elevate the limb
and apply compression and ice
to prevent swelling. If the sprain
is severe, the ankle is X-rayed
and the athlete is given medicine
to keep the swelling down.
The trainers' day ends around
6:30. Both are physically and
mentally exhausted, for besides
giving treatments all day, the
two try to humor the wounded
to alleviate the pain.
