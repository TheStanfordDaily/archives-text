# Voluntary Groups
## 
### 
As a source of honest dissent, the Stanford
Committee for Peace in Vietnam has contrib
uted to a fuller understanding of the nature of
the war and forced each member of the com
munity to consider the American commitment
beyond the abstractions of the press. However,
in choosing to fight the University policy on
registration of voluntary groups, SCPV seems
to be misdirecting the thrust of these efforts.
In order to enjoy University recognition and
the use of campus facilities, all voluntary groups
must register with the Dean's Office and sub
mit a copy of their constitution. Having re
fused to register, SCPV was denied use of Uni
versity rooms last week by the Committee on
Public Exercises.
Much of the group's protest stems not from
the principle of registration: the group found
no cause for refusal last year, and the University
has not shown any intention to deny recognition
of a group as a form of censorship. Rather
SCPV's concern stems from the University's re
lease of names of leaders and the constitutions
of four voluntary groups, including SCPV, un
der subpoena by the House on Unamerican
Activities Committee during the summer.
SCPV interprets the University's compliance
with the subpoena as another example of the
in loco parentis function of the University
and an obstruction to the body's right to legally
defend itself. Leaders of other organizations
have called the action of the University a
breach in its responsibility to protect students
from allegedly unconstitutional intimidation by
HUAC. Both viewpoints conclude that the Uni
versity ought to have refused to honor the
subpoena.

Of the basic arguments we tind only one to
be pertinent.
We see no cause for concern in the fact that
the University requires groups to name a rep
resentative and to submit a constitution. Free
dom of speech and assembly do not necessitate
a clandestine atmosphere. The University nei
ther has, nor will divulge, the membership list
of any voluntary group beyond the name of its
authorized representative.
The contention that University action usurps
the right of the voluntary group to fight its own
legal battles does, however, seem valid. In
the recent HUAC affair, the University counsel
decided to comply with the subpoena. To op
pose the subpoena would have been to stand
on dubious legal grounds and, in essence, to
have fought a test case in the name of the
voluntary groups. Despite the fact that it would
have been inappropriate for the University to
enter into the legal controversy, the opportunity
to test the merits of its position is one of the
legitimate rights of a group.
Although it is not the University's function to
provide organizations with a convenient cloak
for its activities, we believe the present sys
tem of registration should be altered to allow
voluntary groups greater freedom in their legal
disputes, while maintaining the University's
right to establish conditions for official recogni
tion.
Much of the controversy is symbolic and sec
ondary to the purposes the voluntary groups
most concerned. Hence we hope the issue can
be dealt with quickly by the Dean's Office with
the cooperation of student government.

tion.
Much of the controversy is symbolic and sec
ondary to the purposes the voluntary groups
most concerned. Hence we hope the issue can
be dealt with quickly by the Dean's Office with
the cooperation of student government.
As a source of honest dissent, the Stanford
Committee for Peace in Vietnam has contrib
uted to a fuller understanding of the nature of
the war and forced each member of the com
munity to consider the American commitment
beyond the abstractions of the press. However,
in choosing to fight the University policy on
registration of voluntary groups, SCPV seems
to be misdirecting the thrust of these efforts.
In order to enjoy University recognition and
the use of campus facilities, all voluntary groups
must register with the Dean's Office and sub
mit a copy of their constitution. Having re
fused to register, SCPV was denied use of Uni
versity rooms last week by the Committee on
Public Exercises.
Much of the group's protest stems not from
the principle of registration: the group found
no cause for refusal last year, and the University
has not shown any intention to deny recognition
of a group as a form of censorship. Rather
SCPV's concern stems from the University's re
lease of names of leaders and the constitutions
of four voluntary groups, including SCPV, un
der subpoena by the House on Unamerican
Activities Committee during the summer.
SCPV interprets the University's compliance
with the subpoena as another example of the
in loco parentis function of the University
and an obstruction to the body's right to legally
defend itself. Leaders of other organizations
have called the action of the University a
breach in its responsibility to protect students
from allegedly unconstitutional intimidation by
HUAC. Both viewpoints conclude that the Uni
versity ought to have refused to honor the
subpoena.

Of the basic arguments we tind only one to
be pertinent.
We see no cause for concern in the fact that
the University requires groups to name a rep
resentative and to submit a constitution. Free
dom of speech and assembly do not necessitate
a clandestine atmosphere. The University nei
ther has, nor will divulge, the membership list
of any voluntary group beyond the name of its
authorized representative.
The contention that University action usurps
the right of the voluntary group to fight its own
legal battles does, however, seem valid. In
the recent HUAC affair, the University counsel
decided to comply with the subpoena. To op
pose the subpoena would have been to stand
on dubious legal grounds and, in essence, to
have fought a test case in the name of the
voluntary groups. Despite the fact that it would
have been inappropriate for the University to
enter into the legal controversy, the opportunity
to test the merits of its position is one of the
legitimate rights of a group.
Although it is not the University's function to
provide organizations with a convenient cloak
for its activities, we believe the present sys
tem of registration should be altered to allow
voluntary groups greater freedom in their legal
disputes, while maintaining the University's
right to establish conditions for official recogni
tion.
