# The 						Capitol Scenes
## Voting In D.C. And Vietnam 
### Art Buchwald 
It is very hard for a resident
of Washington, D.C., to explain
the American election system to
a foreigner. Just the other day a
representative of South Vietnam
came here to study our elections
so he could go back to his
country and report on how the
greatest democracy in the world
works.
Let us call him Tri Vang Vin.
"Whom are you going to vote
for on Tuesday?" Tri Vang Vin
asked.
"Nobody," I told him. "We're
not allowed to vote."
"But how can that be?" Tri
Vang Vin asked. "Is this not the
capital of the United States?"
"Exactly," I replied. "That's
why we're not allowed to vote.
You see, anyone who lives in
Washington, D.C., may only vote
once every four years for the
President of the United States.
The rest of the time on elec
tion day we have to stay at
home."
"But who represents you in
Congress?"
"Everybody," I said. "A con
gressman from South Carolina
might tell us how much money
we can have for schools, a repre
sentative from Nevada could dic
tate how much taxes we have to
pay and a senator from West
Virginia will tell us what kind
of police department we can

have. We're too dumb here to
think for ourselves."
Tri Vang Vin said, "How can
you be a democracy if you can
not decide for yourselves who
will represent you?"
"Oh, we are a democracy, all
right. That's why we don't have
the vote. You must understand
that the question of home rule
for Washington has been de
bated many times, and it's al
ways been defeated because Con
gress claims that if they gave
the 800,000 citizens of Washing
ton the right to choose their own
government it would be uncon
stitutional."
"But the people in Washing
ton always keep telling us that
we must allow the people of
South Vietnam to vote."
"That's true. They want the
people of South Vietnam to have
the vote, but they don't want the
people in Washington to have
a say in their own affairs. You
see, Congress trusts you, but
they don't trust us."
"How can I go back to Viet
nam and tell my people that no
body in this city is allowed to
vote?"
"It's easy. Just explain to them
that in order for us to get the
vote we have to persuade Con
gress to give it to us. Since
we have nothing to say about
who gets elected to Congress,

they aren't about to let us have
it."
"Why not?"
"Because Congress likes to run
Washington, D.C. If they gave
us home rule they wouldn't be
able to fix their own traffic tick
ets."
"Ah, that I can understand.
But if this is true of your cap
ital, why couldn't we decide not
to let anyone in Saigon have
the vote?"
"Our Congress would never
stand for that," I said. "We're
pouring a lot of money in there
just so all the people in South
Vietnam can decide their own
destinies. If you disenfranchised
Saigon your elections would be a
fraud and a mockery."
"Buy why aren't your elec
tions a fraud and a mockery if
800,000 people in the nation's
capital have nothing to say about
their destinies?"
"Because we're not a back
ward nation. We have spent bil
lions of dollars persuading
everyone in the world that the
only solution to their problems
is free and open elections. And
this country believes that every
one should have the God-given
right to vote, except, of course,
those people who live in the
District of Columbia. You see,
my friend, the United States has
to draw the line somewhere."

representative of South Vietnam
came here to study our elections
so he could go back to his
country and report on how the
greatest democracy in the world
works.
Let us call him Tri Vang Vin.
"Whom are you going to vote
for on Tuesday?" Tri Vang Vin
asked.
"Nobody," I told him. "We're
not allowed to vote."
"But how can that be?" Tri
Vang Vin asked. "Is this not the
capital of the United States?"
"Exactly," I replied. "That's
why we're not allowed to vote.
You see, anyone who lives in
Washington, D.C., may only vote
once every four years for the
President of the United States.
The rest of the time on elec
tion day we have to stay at
home."
"But who represents you in
Congress?"
"Everybody," I said. "A con
gressman from South Carolina
might tell us how much money
we can have for schools, a repre
sentative from Nevada could dic
tate how much taxes we have to
pay and a senator from West
Virginia will tell us what kind
of police department we can

have. We're too dumb here to
think for ourselves."
Tri Vang Vin said, "How can
you be a democracy if you can
not decide for yourselves who
will represent you?"
"Oh, we are a democracy, all
right. That's why we don't have
the vote. You must understand
that the question of home rule
for Washington has been de
bated many times, and it's al
ways been defeated because Con
gress claims that if they gave
the 800,000 citizens of Washing
ton the right to choose their own
government it would be uncon
stitutional."
"But the people in Washing
ton always keep telling us that
we must allow the people of
South Vietnam to vote."
"That's true. They want the
people of South Vietnam to have
the vote, but they don't want the
people in Washington to have
a say in their own affairs. You
see, Congress trusts you, but
they don't trust us."
"How can I go back to Viet
nam and tell my people that no
body in this city is allowed to
vote?"
"It's easy. Just explain to them
that in order for us to get the
vote we have to persuade Con
gress to give it to us. Since
we have nothing to say about
who gets elected to Congress,

they aren't about to let us have
it."
"Why not?"
"Because Congress likes to run
Washington, D.C. If they gave
us home rule they wouldn't be
able to fix their own traffic tick
ets."
"Ah, that I can understand.
But if this is true of your cap
ital, why couldn't we decide not
to let anyone in Saigon have
the vote?"
"Our Congress would never
stand for that," I said. "We're
pouring a lot of money in there
just so all the people in South
Vietnam can decide their own
destinies. If you disenfranchised
Saigon your elections would be a
fraud and a mockery."
"Buy why aren't your elec
tions a fraud and a mockery if
800,000 people in the nation's
capital have nothing to say about
their destinies?"
"Because we're not a back
ward nation. We have spent bil
lions of dollars persuading
everyone in the world that the
only solution to their problems
is free and open elections. And
this country believes that every
one should have the God-given
right to vote, except, of course,
those people who live in the
District of Columbia. You see,
my friend, the United States has
to draw the line somewhere."
