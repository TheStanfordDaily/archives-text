# Fleeing The Burden Of Critical Thought
## 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Dr. A. H. Maslow, who is
usually grouped with the "ex
istential psychologists," in his
recent book The Psychology of
Science, lists certain traits com
monly associated with "sick" or
pathological attitudes toward
knowing (pages 26-29). Two of
these have to do with acceptance
of authority:
"13. Overrespect for authority,
for the great man. The need to
keep his love. Becoming only a
disciple, a loyal follower, ulti
mately a stooge, unable to be
independent, unable to affirm
himself . . .
"14. Underrespect for author
ity. The need to fight authority.
The inability to learn from one's
elders or teachers."
The healthy, mature attiude
falls between these extremes. It
does not accept authority un
critically, but neither does it re
ject authority uncritically and
compusively. A blind and
sweeping disrespect for author
ity is, on Dr. Maslow's view, as
much a sign of immaturity as its
opposite. The doctrinaire rebel
and the subservent "yes-man"
are brothers under the skin.
Dr. Maslow also lists some
other common characteristics of
the "sick" or pathological atti
tude toward knowledge:
"1. The compulsive need for
certainty . . .
"2. The premature generaliza
tion . . .
"5. The denial of doubt, con
fusion, puzzlement: the need to
appear decisive, certain, con
fident, sure of oneself: the in
ability to be humble . . .
"9. Intolerance of ambuguity
"19. Rubricizing, i.e. patholog
ical categorizing as a flight from
concrete experiencing and cog
nizing . . .
"20. Dichotomizing compusive
ly; two- valued orientation;
either-or; black or white . .
If the aim of education is to
encourage the student to de
velop his own individual capac
ities for critical and independent
thinking, one may question whe
ther student apathy about educa
tion is the only obstacle. A
student who is apathetic may be
too lazy to think critically, but
a student who is blindly rebel
lious can be too impatient to

think critically. In either case
the result is the same—a flight
from the burden of critical
thinking.
Concern by a student for his
own education, with the desire to
have some voice in it, is mature
and healthy, provided it is au
thentic. But, as Sartre has point
ed out, a professed devotion to
authenticity may itself be in
authentic. A sweeping attack on
"role-playing" and a sweeping
demand for absolute "freedom"
can be a platform for self-dram
atization and further role-play
ing. When this occurs there is
no advance; we have the same
immaturity and inauthenticity
as before, wearing a more pre
tentious costume.

Editor, The Daily:
I've always respected Dr. Rob
ert Macafee Brown as a man of
great stature and integrity. How
ever, I am deeply sorry and dis
appointed for the statement
which he made without know
ing all the facts about the Luke
Kabat Memorial Fund.
The whole story which I was
not allowed to publish in The
Daily or Palo Alto Times will be
printed in the Tuesday edition
of Committment and hopefully it
will not only enlighten Dr.
Brown but the whole Stanford
Community.

• Barbarians
Editor, The Daily;
The recent series of articles,
dealing with Austria IT, has
served to clarify Doctor Walk
er's attitude in dealing with the
overseas program. The fact that
a number of students spent a
miserable academic six months
overseas, he calls "not serious."
The isolation argument, as well
as any other argument, he calls
"somewhat questionable."
Our attempt to confront the
administration was not consis
tent with Walker's vision of the
overseas program. All problems
are attributed to student psycho
logy, not to the machines of ad
ministration. Gripes, petitions
and requests, Walker has indi

cated, are futile — not worth
the stamp necessary for the mes
sage to reach home campus.
Discontent was largely a re
sult of the academic load, much
greater than Austria I accord
ing to Miss Mehrl, a German
teacher at the Panhans, and
average grades received. One
need merely look at Professor
Stegner's curve and the average
GPA to understand this discon
tent.
We were shocked to hear Dr.
Kroniger, an administrator at
the campus, state that "travel
on weekends, if at all possible,
will be permissable. You are ex
pected to spend at least one half
of your weekends home study

ing." And Walker can't under
stand why students "should
elect to go abroad and isolate
themselves from the European
experience." Whether the prob
lem is one of misunderstanding
or lack of administrative com
munication, it is a problem in
administration, not student psy
chology.
In Austria our "barbarian"
ways were equated with the
term "typically American."
Thank goodness we can return
to Stanford to be called "belli
gerent" and "complete nuis
sances" by the director of the
barbarians abroad program.
