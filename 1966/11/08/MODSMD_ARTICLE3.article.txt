# Reform Committee Seeks Support For New Ideas
## 
### CHRIS HARTE Associate Editor 
Rick Levin announced plans yes
terday for a group to "coordinate all
work in the area of educational re
form."
Levin, appointed chairman of the
new Committee on Educational Re
form by Dave Harris, plans a meet
ing Thursday for all students "with
ideas and a desire to work for re
form at Stanford." Harris and Levin
will speak to those who attend the
4:15 meeting in Tresidder 270-1.
While the group will use the title
"committee," Levin emphasized that
it was "going to get away from the ex
tensive use of committee structures
that has so often hindered meaning
ful progress."
Active Approach
"We seek an active approach to
change at Stanford. Students with
ideas will be given an opportunity to
work out positive proposals and carry
them through to their fruition," Levin
continued.
"Central to this entire concept is
the notion that meaningful change
comes only when the entire Univer

sity community contributes and when
our decisions are made by administra
tors, faculty, and students, and not by
administrators 'consulting' student
opinion."
Levin said his function will be to
coordinate and direct these efforts
and to mobilize student and faculty
support for new ideas.
Investigation And Action
He listed the following among areas
for investigation and action which will
be worked on:
—A pass-fail system for freshmen.
California Institute of Technology has
used a pass-fail plan for several
years, and has recently made it a
permanent part of freshman year
(see related Wisconsin story this
page).
—General studies. The relevance of
the entire program should be ex
amined and significant changes should
be effected, according to Levin.
—Overseas campuses. As with gen
eral studies, Levin thinks that a thor
ough examination is desperately need
ed.
—Teacher evaluation. Levin would
like to see the development of a
method for evaluating teaching per

formance so that departments can
use the information in consideration
of promotion and in course assign
ments.
—ROTC and intercollegiate athletics.
Their relation to education at Stan
ford would be subjected to intensive
study and review.
—Curriculum reforms in the depart
ments.
—Admissions. Questions about gen
eral admissions policy, and specifically
about policy regarding minority group
admission.
Three Appointees
Three people have already been ap
pointed by Levin to coordinate work
in three "key" areas. They are John
Rakin, whose concern will be fresh
man year; Craig Schindler, general
studies; and Paul Rupert .overseas
campuses.
Levin emphasized that there would
be no selection of committees, but
rather that all those interested in
working in a particular area would
be encouraged to do so.
He also made clear that the new
committee "will in no way supercede
existing committees, but complement
them."
