# Draw System
## Frosh Overseas Selection Revised 
### CICELY BATES 
The advent of deferred grading in
one or more courses for over 50 per
cent of this year's freshmen has nec
essitated the development of a re
vised procedure for the selection of
freshmen for Overseas Campuses.
The new system, while tentative un-

til further experience has been accum
ulated, will be in effect this quarter
and as long as deferred grading is
the practice for many sections in
Freshman English and Western Civi
lization courses; it will apply to all
freshmen regardless of whether or not

the individual student is enrolled in
any course with deferred grading.
In essence, a list of all freshman
applicants (men and women sepa
rated) will be compiled, ranked by
numbers drawn at random rather
than by grade point average. These
applicants will then be treated in
exactly the same manner as students
in other classes (sophomores, juniors,
and seniors) who will continue to be
ranked initially by grade point aver
age.
Personal Qualifications
The applicant's personal qualifica
tions for leadership, stability, and
capacity to adjust to the demands of
another culture will be considered in
each case as before. Once the ranked
lists have been completed, students
will be selected for each campus on
the basis of choices they indicated,
insofar as possible.
For Austria and Britain, the per
centages of freshmen selected will be
based on the percentage of freshmen
who indicate those campuses as first
choice, since Stanford in Austria and
Stanford in Britain have not been in
operation long enough to provide any
other meaningful bases for establish
ing the number of places for fresh
men.

For France, Germany, and Italy,
freshmen will be selected on the basis
of approximate percentages of stu
dents who were freshmen at the time
groups for the last three years were
selected in Autumn or Winter Quar
ter, respectively.
Application Percentage
If the percentage of freshman ap
plicants listing the latter three cam
puses shows a change from the previ
ous patterns, revision of the per
centage of places assigned to fresh
men will be considered.
Freshman applicants doing unsatis
factory work (as defined by the in
structor) in any course being graded
on a deferred basis will be carefully
reviewed to determine whether their
participation should not be postponed.
At the end of each quarter after
selection and prior to departure, the
academic records of all freshman
selectees will again be reviewed, and
any freshman selectee whose cumu
lative grade point average falls to 2.2
or below will be subject to recon
sideration.
Deciding Body
In both the initial selections and pos
sible subsequent revisions of the lists
of selectees for each campus, the
Selection Committee, comprised of
representatives of the Overseas Cam
puses Program, the Office of the Dean
of Students ,and the faculty, will be
the deciding body.
The new procedures were approved
at recent meetings of the full Gen
eral Studies Committee as well as the
General Studies Subcommittee on the
Overseas Campuses.
According to Assistant to the Over
seas Campus Director, Bob Hamrdla,
the new policy does not effect upper
classmen taking Pass-Fail courses be
cause they have at least three quar
ters of grades compiled and would be
taking at the most only one ungraded
subject per quarter.
The Overseas Campus program has
come under increasing fire from stu
dents recently. Students returning
from Austria II have been particu
larly critical of the program.
The change in the method of select
ing freshmen for overseas could be
the first in a scries of reforms in the
whole program.
Hamrdla announced the changes.
Overseas Campus Director Robert A.
Walker is currently in Tours, France,
and was unavailable for comment.
