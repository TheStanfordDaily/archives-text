Sunday night the students built a
fire in the plaza for warmth, after
obtaining a permit from the Stanford
police. Heavy rains finally forced
them to take shelter under the roof
of the Bookstore.
The vigil has encountered little op

position other than the bad weather.
There has been no trouble with other
students.
The vigil is part of the SCPV's in
volvement in the "National Days of
Mobilization for Peace," which in
cludes peace groups from across the
country.

At Stanford the program has in
cluded a film on the war, "Sons and
Daughters," last Friday night; dem
onstrations at the Stanford-Air Force
football game Saturday; the vigil in
White Plaza; and a "Vietnam Forum"
last night in the plaza, which featured
Professors Barton Bernstein of the
History department and Charles
Drekmeier of the Political Science
department.
The SCPV has been denied the use
of university buildings for its rallies
and programs because it has regis
tered only with the ASSU office and
refuses to register with the Dean of
Students.
