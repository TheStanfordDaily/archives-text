###

tant to ASSU President Dave Harris,

sees no need for President Sterling's
opposition to his committee nominees.
Haight spoke in response to a ques
tion asking him to comment on Presi
dent Sterling's rejection of eight out
of the thirty-two Harris nominees.

ency the ASSU president and LASSU
should have the right to make com
mittee appointments. Harris is cur
rently on a lecture tour in Penn
sylvania.

Ground Rules

tant to President Sterling, claimed that
Harris disregarded "presidential
ground rules" by suggesting only one
student for each committee seat in
stead of the two which President
Sterling has insisted on receiving for
the past four years. .
Haight said that Glover would re
lease the list of rejected nominees
to President Harris but has declined
to name their replacements.
Faculty Recommendations?
Glover has not specified the reason

for the rejection of the Harris nomi
nees and has not commented on Sen
ior Class President Jim Binns' specu
lation that Sterling's non-Harris ap
pointees were selected from recom
mendations of various faculty mem
bers.
President Harris hopes that the
eight Sterling appointees will contact
him so that an arrangement can be
reached and negotiations can be
started again.
