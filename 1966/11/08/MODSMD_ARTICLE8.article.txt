# Wisconsin Students Pass Pass-Fail Grading Bill
## 
### 
A pass-fail grading system was ap
proved by (he student legislators at
the University of Wisconsin for all
students except first semester fresh
man and those on academic probation.
(The Legislature of the Associated
Students of Stanford University
passed a similar resolution last Thurs
day, urging the Committee on Under
graduate Education to establish a
pass-fail system for freshmen based
on the highly-successful plan insti
tuted three years ago at Ca! Tech and
recently made a permanent part of
the school's educational process.)
The proposal would limit each stu
dent to 30 credits under the now sys
tem. The bill provides that students
could determine for themselves wheth
er they wanted to take a course under
the pass-fail plan, and that "grades"
received would not affect their grade
point averages.

The bill was passed by the legisla
ture because students at the univer
sity "feel that academic pressures are
becoming so great that many are
afraid to take courses outside their
major fields for fear of failing," ac
cording to the Milwaukee Journal.
The student legislators said that
the proposed grading system would
rncouragc students to explore areas
outside their major fields. They
modeled their plan after similar sys
tems already in operation in several
California colleges and universities.
They were assisted in drafting the bill
by a junior transfer coed from the
University of California at Santa Bar
bara. which already has a similar
plan.
The recommendation will now go
to the student-faculty conference com
mittee on educational affairs.
