# Berkeley Considers New Tenure Policy
## 
### 
A proposal to base faculty
tenure partly on teaching per
formance is being considered at
the University of California at
Berkeley.
The Daily Californian report
ed yesterday that a special meet
ing of the Academic Senate is
being held to consider Recom
mendation One of the Muscatine
Report on the Select Committee
on Education. The report recom
mends that every departmental
promotion to tenure rank be ac
companied by an evaluation of
the teaching performance of the

candidate.
Recommendation One specifies
that such a report should in
clude:
1) Evidence of teacher prep
aration such as source materials
and plans, syllabi, examinations,
and textbooks written by the
candidate;
2) A statement by the candi
date stating the rationale behind
his teaching methods;
3) Written reports by col
leagues, evaluating the candi
date's teaching performance on
the basis of first hand evidence.
The recommendation is de
signed to spell out in detail the
present policies regarding teach
ing evaluation as a criterion for
granting tenure.
The Senate meeting will also
consider a recommendation that
students be allowed to under
take independent study at any
time in their academic career.
