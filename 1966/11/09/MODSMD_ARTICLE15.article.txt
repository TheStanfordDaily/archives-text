## ELECTIONS '66 Few Surprises In Eastern Races; Rockefeller, Brooke Head Winners 
### 
Eastern elections produced few sur
prises with the pre-election favorites
winning in most states.
An off-year record of over six mil
lion New Yorkers went to the polls yes
terday to give Republican Nelson Rocke
feller his third term as Governor. Rock
efeller was elected by a plurality of
335,357 votes over Democrat Frank D.
O'Connor.
One major factor in the race in which
neither Rockefeller nor O'Connor was
favored was the presence of two minor
party candidates, Liberal Franklin D.
Roosevelt Jr. and Conservative Paul
Adams. Surprisingly, Adams polled 9%
of the votes to Roosevelts 9%.
New York City voters overwhelmingly
rejected the civilian police review board

which had the support of most politicians
and civil rights groups.
White backlash sentiment in Massa
chusetts failed to prevent Republican Ed
ward W. Brooke from becoming the first
Negro Senator in almost one hundred
years.
Brooke, the heavy favorite in pre
election polls, defeated former Demo
cratic Governor Endicott peabody.
Incumbent John Volpe, also a Republican,
was re-elected governor.
In another significant eastern contest
Republican Spiro Agnew narrowly de
feated outspoken states-rights advocate
George Mahoney 447,303 to 365,664
Independent Hyman A. Pressman polled
several thousand votes.
Pennsylvania Lieutenant-Governor

Raymond Shafer moved up to Governor
when he decisively beat Democrat Milton
Schapp. Schapp, with his multi-million
dollar campaign, could not overcome the
support given Shafer by retiring
Republican Governor William Scranton.

Democratic New England governors
elected include Phillip Hoff of Vermont,
John King of New Hampshire, Claiborne
Pell of Rhode Island, John Dempsey of
Connecticut, Henry Curtis of Maine.
Margaret Chase Smith was re-elected,
