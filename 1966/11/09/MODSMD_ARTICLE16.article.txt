# OUT WEST
## Hatfield: Salem To Washington 
### 
Mark Hatfield, Oregon's liberal Re
publican governor, was swept into the
state's open U. S. Senate seat yesterday
in an election that echoed Republican
gains throughout the West.
Hatfield, considered a "peace candi
date" because of moderate opposition
to the administration's Vietnam policy,
defeated Democratic Rep. Robert Dun
can, who backed the policy of President
Johnson.
However, Hatfield cautioned, "Let

neither Washington nor Hanoi misread
this election. I have said from the
beginning this is not a single issue
campaign.
"The people of this state want
stronger efforts to end the war," he
said, "but not peace at any price."
The two-term Oregon governor, a
graduate of Stanford, has never been
defeated in an election.
The Oregon race was the only major
contest in the nation in which the Viet-

nam war emerged as a main issue.
Hatfield has professed the belief that
the United States owes the public more
information on its objectives in the
Southeast Asian conflict.
Aside from Ronald Reagan's im
pressive California gubernatorial vic
tory, most Western races were either
too close to call or not far enough along
in counting to predict.
But it was apparent that Republicans
have made significant gains in popu
larity.
In New Mexico's senatorial race,
favored Democratic nominee Lusk was
defeated by Republican Cargo, ac
cording to late television network pre
dictions.
And in Idaho, Conservative Repub
lican Donald Samuelson posted a vic
tory over Democratic candidate And
rus, closest of four opponents in the
governor's race.
Another conservative gain was fore
cast in Wyoming, where conservative
Republican Clifford P. Hansen held a
slender lead over Democrat Tenoßon
calio, who had been favored. Incum
bent Republican Senator Milward L.
Simpson is retiring.
Alaska's incumbent Democratic Sen
ator Egan held a slight lead over
challenger Hickel in a race too close
to call last night. Similarly, in Wyo
ming, Republican Hathaway was lead
ing Wilkerson in another close race.
' In Hawaii, incumbent Governor John
A. Burns, democrat, held only a small
margin over Challenger Crossley.
Colorado's referendum measure fav
oring elimination of capital punish
ment was defeated by a 2-1 margin.
