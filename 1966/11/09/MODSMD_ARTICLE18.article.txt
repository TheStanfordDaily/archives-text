## 
### HENRY MULLER CRAIG LUBBOCK 
Ronald Reagan yesterday led a na
tionwide Republican upset as he
trounced two-term Democratic Gov
ernor Edmund G. Brown by a margin
predicted to exceed one million.
Results early this morning showed
the 55-year-old Reagan leading with
2,302,000 votes to Brown's 1,687,000

as 70% of the precincts reported.
In a race not nearly as decisive,
Republican candidate for Lieutenant
Governor Robert H. Finch was Richard
Governor Robert H. Finch defeated
incumbent Glenn M. Anderson. Finch
was Richard Nixon's campaign man
ager in the 19G0 Presidential
campaign.
The latest results indicated

1,198,000 votes for Finch and 1,340,000
for Anderson.
Brown conceded defeat at 10; 15p.m.,
thanking Californians for the support
they have given him in his eight years
as Governor. "We have lost a battle,
but we will win the war," he added.
Governor - elect Reagan acknow
ledged victory around 11 p.m., say
ing, "We can remember the day No

vember 8 as the day we restored the
two-party system to California."
Reagan told a crowd of cheering sup
porters that this election was "no
narrow partisan victory; we had friends
from the other party and independents.
Partisanship ends as of today, now
the big job begins."
Supporters of the former actor waved
"Reagan for president" signs at the
victory party. Reagan, himself, has
pledged to serve out his full four-year
term, "God willing."
Defeat of the 61-year-old Governor
left the California Democratic party
without a leader. For President John
son, Brown's defeat meant the loss of
a loyal supporter of administration
policies, including the Vietnam war.
Reagan cut deeply into Brown's
Northern California power base and won
heavily in Southern California, home of
almost 60 percent of the state's voters.
He won surprising support in San
Francisco, Brown's hometown.
Brown was the only loser among
three Governors running for third
terms. The victors yesterday were
Nelson Rockefeller of New York, first
elected in 1958, and Michigan's George
Romney, who began his first two-year
term in 1962.
In Santa Clara county, Republican
incumbent Charles Gubser defeated his
opponent, Stanford professor George C.
Leppert, for the 10th District Congres
sional seat. Gubser obtained 17,498
votes to Leppert's 7,808.
In the 11th District, Republican J.
Arthur Younger was re-elected. He
received 102,758 votes to challenger
Mark Sullivan's 73,892.
Several of the statewide contests
were still undecided as THE DAILY
went to press, but the following candi
dates were leading early this morning:
* State Controller -- Incumbent Dem
ocrat Alan Cranston over challenger
Houston Flournoy.
* Attorney General --Incumbent Dem
ocrat Thomas Lynch over Spencer
Williams.
* Treasurer -- Incumbent Democrat
Bert Betts with a very slight margin
over former U.S. Treasurer Ivy
Baker Priest.
* Secretary of State -- Incumbent Re
publican Frank M. Jordan over Nor
bert A. Schlei.
- The GOP also made inroads into the
state's Democratic congressional
majority, which was 24-14 going into
the election.
Proposition 16, familiarly known as
the "Clean" amendment was being re
jected by a significant margin as THE
DAILY went to press. The latest tallies
showed 1,158,000 in favor and 1,796,000
against it. The initiative would have
redefined the words "obscenity" and
"knowingly" and would have provided
rules and procedures for prosecuting
violations of obscenity laws.
proposition 1-A, intended to modern
ize the state legislature, appeared to be
favored by a margin of 3 to 1.
proposition 2, calling for bonds to
increase state college and university
facilities, was winning, but the fate
of Proposition 4 remained uncertain.
Proposition 4 would decrease the per
centage of votes necessary to pass a
school bond proposal from 67 to 60.
