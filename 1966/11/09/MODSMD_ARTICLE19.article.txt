## Mrs. Wallace Wins, Maddox Maybe As Republicans Score In Florida 
### PAMELA LANG 
Interest on the Southern elections cen
tered on three closely contested guber
natorial races, as segregationists led and
the Republican party continued its national
gains.
The possibility of a third Republican
gubernatorial upset emerged as conserva
tive Howard (Bo) Callaway, Georgia's only
Republican Congressman, pulled into a late
315,392 lead over racist Lester G.
Maddox, who showed greatest strength in
rural areas.
Write-in votes for moderate former
Gov. Ellis G. Arnall, whose 37,485 votes

represented 5.6 percent of the total, with
69 percent of Georgia's precincts report
ing, however, threatened the victorious
candidate with a run-off or Legislature
election. Under Georgia law the winning
candidate must poll a majority of the votes
cast.
Major Republican victories came in
Florida and Arkansas, where the GOP
captured its first governorships in the
Deep South since Reconstruction.
Conservative Claude Kirk scored an un
expected 786,751 victory in Florida over
Miami's liberal Democratic Mayor Robert
King High, while moderate Winthrop

Rockefeller barely edged out Orval Faubus'
candidate, Jim Johnson, polling 222,824 to
198,719 votes with 89 percent of the
Arkansas precincts reporting.
White backlash votes favored the three
newly-elected Democratic gubernatorial
candidates, Maddox of Georgia, Lurleen
Wallace of Alabama, and Allen Ellington
of Tennessee.
Two additional Democratic governors,
Bruce McNair of South Carolina and John
Connally of Texas, were re-elected.
In Tennessee, Republican senatorial
candidate George Baker's victory over
Democrat Frank Clement marked a de
cisive 366,469 upset, but the seven
other Southern senatorial races showed
clear victories for favored incumbent
candidates.
Present Senators John Sparkman (D-
Ala.), John McClellan (D-Ark.), Richard
Russell (D-Ga.), John Sherman Cooper
(R-Ky.), Allen Ellender (D-La.), Fred
Harris (D-Okla.), and John Tower (R-Tex.)
easily won their predicted victories.
Congressional results from the South
showed Democrats and Re
publicans elected, going against the na
tional trend toward strong Republican
gains in the House.

captured its first governorships in the
Deep South since Reconstruction.
Conservative Claude Kirk scored an un
expected 786,751 victory in Florida over
Miami's liberal Democratic Mayor Robert
King High, while moderate Winthrop

Rockefeller barely edged out Orval Faubus'
candidate, Jim Johnson, polling 222,824 to
198,719 votes with 89 percent of the
Arkansas precincts reporting.
White backlash votes favored the three
newly-elected Democratic gubernatorial
candidates, Maddox of Georgia, Lurleen
Wallace of Alabama, and Allen Ellington
of Tennessee.
Two additional Democratic governors,
Bruce McNair of South Carolina and John
Connally of Texas, were re-elected.
In Tennessee, Republican senatorial
candidate George Baker's victory over
Democrat Frank Clement marked a de
cisive 366,469 upset, but the seven
other Southern senatorial races showed
clear victories for favored incumbent
candidates.
Present Senators John Sparkman (D-
Ala.), John McClellan (D-Ark.), Richard
Russell (D-Ga.), John Sherman Cooper
(R-Ky.), Allen Ellender (D-La.), Fred
Harris (D-Okla.), and John Tower (R-Tex.)
easily won their predicted victories.
Congressional results from the South
showed Democrats and Re
publicans elected, going against the na
tional trend toward strong Republican
gains in the House.
