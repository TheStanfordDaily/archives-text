## 
### PAT McMAHON 
George Romney and Chuck Percy head
line yesterday's election results from
the Midwest and may well influence the
nation.
Michigan voters sent Governor Rom
ney's 1968 Republican presidential stock

soaring by returning him to the state
house for the third time. They also sent
his choice and ticket-mate, Senator Robert
P. Griffin, back to Washington to serve

a full term.
The big question-mark in the Michigan
election was whether Romney could win a
third term with a wide enough margin to
carry Griffin and some congressional
candidates into office onhiscoattails, thus
enhancing his national stature, and he was
successful.
In Illinois, industrialist Chuck Percy
scored an overwhelming victory over his
opponent, liberal incumbent Paul Douglas
by a margin of 500,000 votes.
Percy, in his second try for election,
led both in Cook County, which includes
the Democratic stronghold of Chicago,
and downstate.
Age was a factor in the campaign,

(Percy is 47, Douglas, 74) although neither
candidate brought it up publicly. Another
factor, although difficult to assess, was
what the white backlash was doing to the
returns. Chicago experienced a troubled
summer as civil rights campaigners fought
for better housing and job opportunities.
Douglas has pioneered the civil rights
movement.
In other elections across the Heartland,
Governor Warren P. Knowles of Wisconsin
won reelection handily. Kansas voters,
nearly always Xing the straight Republican
column, didn't let their Republican Gov
ernor William H. Avery keep his job, but
chose Democrat Robert Docking instead.
Ohio reaffirmed Governor James A.
Rhodes, elected his running mates, and
sent him back for four more years in the
Governor's mansion. South Dakota, with
Kansas-like voters, reelected Senator
Karl Mundt by a large majority.

Governor Harold Hughes of lowa was
reelected as expected.
