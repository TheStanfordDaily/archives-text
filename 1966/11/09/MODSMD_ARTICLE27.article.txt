# VICTORY ANALYSIS
## Lewis May Start At QB 
### Nick Selby 
(Note: The following Is an interview with Stanford football coach
John Ralston on the questions arising from the 21-6 win over Air
Force Saturday.)
Q. Will Dave Lewis start at quarterback Saturday after his tre
mendous performance last Saturday?
Coach Ralston: It all depends on injuries. As it is now, we hav<'
only Dave to play halfback if Bill Shoemaker's ankle is not better.
In the quarterback slot, it's still too early to tell if Gene Washington
(sore shoulder) or Chuck Williams (bad left elbow) can play.
If Shoemaker can't play and Washington can't pass, we'll
probably have to use Washington and Lewis both at quarterback,
with Lewis handling the passing chores.
No matter what, Lewis will see some action at quarterback. How
much he plays there depends on the injuries.
Q. There seems to be a question in Stanford fans' niinds over
whether Lewis would have been quarterback the entire year if he
hadn't been injured at the start of the season. Hadn't you decided
to use Washington there even before Lewis' injury?
Coach Ralston: No, we had Dave working at quarterback and
then he got hurt in the second scrimmage before the San Jose game.
He was unable to throw until the Oregon game, and we kept him
at halfback from then on because our only other halfback was
Shoemaker after Tim Abena got hurt.
Q. Did Lewis really come to you and say he was going to quit?
Coach Ralston: That was a case of Dave being disappointed, that's
all. He was not going to quit, he was just discouraged. It's unfor
tunate that the story had to come out as it did. Dave has so much
talent that we've used him in several positions to help with the
injury situation.
Because we've shifted him so much this year, he hasn't had a
chance to really stand out like he's capable of doing.
Q. What happened on the 61 yard touchdown pass from Lewis to
Conrad?
Coach Ralston: Conrad was covered by both the halfback and the
safety. Lewis threw the ball behind the safety as he moved over to
the right to cover Conrad. Conrad managed to spin away from both
for the ball, which was a little bit underthrown.
The pass usually goes to Washington, but ho was covered by two
linebackers who had forced him to the middle.
Q. How do you feel your defense performed Saturday? Were you
surprised by anything from Air Force?
Coach Ralston: Our defense could have been a lot better in the
first half. I never thought Air Force could run through us the way
it did that first drive. We did not mount a very fierce pass rush
the first half, either.
The second half left me very satisfied with our defensive work.
Air Force got only 65 yards and two first downs. Brill, Mohrman;
Hibler, and Wilburn all were exceptional. Also, Air Force didn't
fool us with the screen passes. We'd practiced them all week, but the
first time we missed four tackles.
Q. What are the chances of your using Gene Washington to run
back kickofTs?
Coach Ralston: Gene has that tremendous speed for kickoff re
turn plays, but so far we've been worried about injuries. Now that
we have only two games left, the possibility of using Washington
and John Guillory back there is very real indeed.
Q. UCLA's quarterback Gary Beban likes to throw off roll outs,
right? The way your defense is set up almost the entire brunt of
closing off the outside falls on the tackle. If the tackle gets blocked;
as has happened often this year, the passer lias an age to throw,
the ball. What do you plan to do?
Coach Ralston: Beban definitely likes to throw off roll-outs and
semi roll-outs. We like to drop our ends off into the flat for pass
coverage, and we also like to keep our linebackers inside to pre
vent long runs through the middle.
The tackle has the responsibility for the outside. If he gets',
knocked down, which has happened, the linebacker must come
up, and if he gets pinned inside, we're in trouble. A real tackle
battle will take place.
UCLA is such a well-balanced team that we can't move those line
backers outside. If we did, Mel Farr, the halfback, could rip through
the middle. It's a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul.
Q. How do you feel about your chances of beating UCLA? What
happened to the Bruins up in Seattle?
Coach Ralston: We will go into the game two touchdown under-,'
dogs to UCLA. We feel we can win, but it will definitely be anj
upset. If UCLA is as strong as it was here last year, we'll cer
tainly have trouble. The boys are really keyed for the upset, though.
The deciding factor in the Washington-UCLA game was of
course the rain. UCLA receivers dropped six passes in the first
half which made a big difference. The second half the field was so
muddy the Bruins were unable to do the precision plays they rely
on. Unfortunately, I'm not expecting rain in Los Angeles.
