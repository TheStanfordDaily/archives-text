The Workshop, edited by Keith
Howard, 10 cents.
Read Miss Yount's "Round
Dance" aloud. It is a celebra
tion. She has taken a troupe of
lusty, overfed and overworked
words — "globular," "languor
ous," "pendulous," "orby," 'rol
licking" etc.—and has taught
them to laugh, to sing and to
dance.
Her technical skill is over
whelming yet unselfconscious;
the words repeat and reflect each
others' sound and meaning
hypnotically; Will you, won't
you, will you, won't you, won't
you join the dance? A master
piece.
Lee Whiting's poem also be
longs in the comic tradition. The
style is memorable of Auden,
and the form of Eliot. The poem
is of course nonsensical: 'Now
time has snuggled between us/
Like a duck." The Beatles, nurs
ery rhymes and collegiate plati
tudes all find a place in "Grow
ing Up And Going To Work."
The tone may be a bit too glib
and the verses too "clever," but
the poem is on the whole very
funny, very suggestive and sad
deningly true. This poem is a
celebration to be chanted dur
ing the winters of our lives.
Plop Of A Pancake
The style of "The Players" by
Philipa Redlich is irritating be

cause people, things and images
keep intruding upon the read
er's train of thought. One would
like to filter out the plop of a
pancake, the prying common
place phrases of Mrs. Prentice
and the House Beautiful glitter
of Melissa's new kitchenette. It's
so hard to concentrate on the
Plot with all those interruptions.
But the story is about these
very intrusions upon the self.
The prime character, Chrissie, is
forever being lured and pushed
and violated by the sounds,
movements and intentions of
others. (Damn that music!) Miss
Redlich suggests finally that
there is a time when one must
be alone and unbound by pur
poses and goals just as there is
a time to love and a time to act.

Miss Redlich's prose "works"
because of her skillful union of
form and content. I see the
graceful shadow of Clarissa Dal
loway in this story, and I won
der how long it will be before
Albee must write another play.
Disgust With Machines
Nick Davis in "The Comp
Center at 0527" pours out his
disgust with machines. The
poem is too long and too topical,
but two Haiku-like phrases seem
to crystallize beautifully his feel
ings: "A bird/begins to make a
sound like a/poor tane record
ing." "The branch/of a tree
moves in a light dawn wind/and
you expect for a moment to feel
the wind brush your/face, but
the glass is in the way."
