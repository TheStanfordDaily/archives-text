"The American University of Beirut
(AUB) Exchange Program is one of
the most unique opportunities that
Stanford offers," enthusiastically de
clares last year's AUB returnee Bob
Phillips.
Applications and detailed informa
tion for next year's exchange student
are now available in Room 219 at the
International Center and are due on
November 28.
"The American University of Beirut
is one of the most distinguished
American institutions outside the con
tinental borders of the United States,"
according to Michel Nabti, Chairman
of the Stanford-AUB Exchange Pro
gram.
"The influence of the AUB is ex
tensive; many of the leaders of the
Arab world have studied there, and
the university is a model and advisor
to all Mid-East education."
New Experience
Founded in 1866 by Presbyterian
and Congregational missionaries, the
university is situated in one of the
largest cities in the Mid-East. Though
it is "American in both administrative
form and general curriculum" (it is
chartered by the state of New York),
Phillips describes his year in Beirut as
"a totally new experience."
"One of the University's major as
sets," says Phillips, is "the diversity of
racial, religious and cultural back
ground." Of the 3200 students, three
fourths are Lebanese. The others
come from more than 60 countries and
20 religious backgrounds.
The faculty likewise is comprised
primarily of Arabians, but approxi
mately one-third of the professors are
American or European.
Compared to the Stanford Overseas
Campuses, Phillips finds the AUB
"much more attractive because it of
fers so much that is completely

unique."
The environment is entirely new:
oriental rather than the familiar An
glo-European one.
Evening Aboard
The primary requirement for ex
change applicants is an interest in
the Mid-East, but the program is most
beneficial in the areas of Mid-East his
tory, political science ,and sociology,
according to Phillips. This year's AUB

student at Stanford is Edmund Ti>
Meh, of the Beta Chi house.
To celebrate the 100 th anniversary
of the opening of the American Uni
versity, "A Lebanese Evening
Abroad" is being held on Sunday, De
cember 4, at Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
The program will include an introduc
tion to the university and its history,
films, folk dances, and Lebanese re
freshments.

"The American University of Beirut
(AUB) Exchange Program is one of
the most unique opportunities that
Stanford offers," enthusiastically de
clares last year's AUB returnee Bob
Phillips.
Applications and detailed informa
tion for next year's exchange student
are now available in Room 219 at the
International Center and are due on
November 28.
"The American University of Beirut
is one of the most distinguished
American institutions outside the con
tinental borders of the United States,"
according to Michel Nabti, Chairman
of the Stanford-AUB Exchange Pro
gram.
"The influence of the AUB is ex
tensive; many of the leaders of the
Arab world have studied there, and
the university is a model and advisor
to all Mid-East education."
New Experience
Founded in 1866 by Presbyterian
and Congregational missionaries, the
university is situated in one of the
largest cities in the Mid-East. Though
it is "American in both administrative
form and general curriculum" (it is
chartered by the state of New York),
Phillips describes his year in Beirut as
"a totally new experience."
"One of the University's major as
sets," says Phillips, is "the diversity of
racial, religious and cultural back
ground." Of the 3200 students, three
fourths are Lebanese. The others
come from more than 60 countries and
20 religious backgrounds.
The faculty likewise is comprised
primarily of Arabians, but approxi
mately one-third of the professors are
American or European.
Compared to the Stanford Overseas
Campuses, Phillips finds the AUB
"much more attractive because it of
fers so much that is completely

unique."
The environment is entirely new:
oriental rather than the familiar An
glo-European one.
Evening Aboard
The primary requirement for ex
change applicants is an interest in
the Mid-East, but the program is most
beneficial in the areas of Mid-East his
tory, political science ,and sociology,
according to Phillips. This year's AUB

student at Stanford is Edmund Ti>
Meh, of the Beta Chi house.
To celebrate the 100 th anniversary
of the opening of the American Uni
versity, "A Lebanese Evening
Abroad" is being held on Sunday, De
cember 4, at Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
The program will include an introduc
tion to the university and its history,
films, folk dances, and Lebanese re
freshments.
