# Letters To The Editor
## Stanford's Anti-Apathy Index 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
What a wonderful fresh breeze
the"Letters" section of Nov. 2's
Daily is! As a matter of fact,
the letters section is most often
the most vital section of The
Daily—and should serve as the
best index of the University com
munity's involvement in the ex
change of ideas.
Cheers for Marcia Cohn, who,
without the slightest malice,
calls with both heart and mind
upon both faculty and students
alike to examine the overseas
campus program in a light other
than "students vs. administra
tion."
And, Mr. Hargrove—bless you
for your perspective, including
that lovely bit about "a big
happy bowl of Jell-o."
And kudos to Carrick Patter
son, who in plain, forceful, and
unsanctimonious English says
something sensible about Gen
eral Studies.
In each of these letters is il
lustrated concern and interest,
open- mindedness, knowledge,
common sense, and—by God—a
sense of humor and proportion.
If that's not education and its
visible results, I don't know
what is.
There are lots of grim things
around, but the monochromat
ic response of grimness had a
dismal record of curing them.
The best of men have been most
helpful when they have taken
problems seriously—but not re
garded themselves as a disaster
area.

• Commitment
Editor, the Daily:
Last Friday evening, as I was
crossing White Plaza, I noticed
a small throng of students po
litely applauding several speak
ers. It was a peace rally. As I
approached, a girl wa6 denoun
cing the oppression of free
speech in the United States.
Then a slightly embarassed stu
dent, wearing a Viet Cong flag
sown to his jacket, affirmed the
lack of freedom in the country,
noting that he was thrown off
the Foothill campus for wearing
sandals.
The microphone was passed
from one student to another, to
anyone who wanted to speak or
protest. They were all listened
to ever so politely until a wom
an in her thirties spoke. She
asked them why they were
there, and she was hissed. She
asked the boy with the Viet
Cong flag why he wore it. He
said he believed in their cause.
She asked him what he knew
of Vietnam and he began to
stumble. Twice students took
the microphone from her and
interrupted with guffaws, not
being able to think of anything
intelligent. The crowd laughed
and booed and hissed and some
one called out from the back,
"Mother," thinking he was ter
ribly clever. One could hardly
hear the woman for the noise
and catcalls. Finally the head of

this movement for peace and
freedom politely pushed her
aside, muttering something
about other people wanting to
speak.
The tragedy of all this is that
these students address only
themselves and will only listen
to themselves. They believe
themselves totally committed,
but they are uncommitted to
anything but their own intoler
ance. The only freedom allowed
is the bleating of sheep. And the
poor sheep are not even aware
of it. BRYON STRONG
• Northern View
Editor, The Daily;
As a Non-Standfordite looking
in from beyond the hallowed
walls, I am wondering just what
kind of "Stanford Image" this
manly Order of Delilah is trying
to establish.

• Bye Beye
Editor, the Daily:
From Professor Charles Beye's
victory in the Red Hot Prof con
test, it appears that it takes
more than a mysterious dis
missal to stifle the sound of a
popular teacher's voice. For
though Professor Beye is now
in Boston, students, faculty, and
friends supported him to an
overwhelming victory and even
flew him out here for the game.
For those who know Profes
sor Beye and admire him for his
wit and brilliance and for those
who would like to see some of
the reasons for his popularity,
we would like to mention that
his book is and for some time
has been available at the Stan
ford bookstore. The Illiad, the
Odyssey, and the Epic Tradition
shows the brilliance of mind and
originality of insight that won
him the lasting respect of many
in the Stanford community. The
book, by the way, is in paper-

• Type Casting?
Editor, The Daily:
In discussion about Stanford's
fraternity system which I have
read or overheard there seems to
be an important consideration
lacking. Rush has been criticized
as being a superficial selection
process which may warp egos of
rejects (or pledges), but this is
the apparent extent of the con
cern expressed for the psycho
logical and social effects of the
system upon nonmembers. It
has been recognized that the fra
ternity system must be studied
and evaluated in its relation to
housing policy as a whole. Well,
one of the aspects of this rela
tionship is the sociological situ
ation which results from the
practice of splitting in half the
male part of the student body
according to criteria established

by what must be considered, at
least in this respect, the priv
ileged half.
I concede that there is a wide
and overlapping range of person
alities and interests among mem
bers of fraternities and Stern
Hall. Yet apparently significant
differences in personality traits
and social development separate
members of these two living
groups. That such divergences
probably exist is indicated by the
well-known stereotypes among
other things. The nature and de
sirability of these divergence
should be questioned on several
grounds. Do they represent a dif
ference between two personality
types (or sets of types) success
fully separated by rush, or do
they reflect an inequality of
social opportunities between the
two groups? Given these differ
ences, is it good for the social
development of individuals for
there to be such limited social
contact between members of the
two groups? In short, what are
the prevailing differences be
tween members of fraternity
and dormitory living groups; are
these differences inherent or en
vironmental; and in such differ
entiation desirable and equitable
for the individuals affected?
These questions are vital to the
Housing Commission investiga
tion now under way. The ans
wers to some of them will be ex
pensive to obtain in that they
involve, not value judgement by
or opinion surveys of interested
parties, but tests and profession
al appraisal of sociological phe
nomena. I hope that this aspect
of the investigation will not suf
fer underemphasis for lack of
funds to conduct such tests. It
would be unfortunate if, while
millions of dollars are budgeted
for constructing and maintaining
student housing, mere hundreds
or thousands were not available
to study the form which that
housing should take.

• Ode To The Fools
Editor, The Daily;
HIS hair is not there.
How much do I care?
"Apathy!" you say.
I say, "My ,
This whole controversy
Shows me no class."
"Immaturity!" you say.
I say, "The hell,
Now, throw him in the lake
And wash off his smell."
"Damn the Frats!" you say.
I say, "You're a fool,
For it's alumni 'brothers'
Who control this school."
Only This query is fair—
Do YOU have any hair?
