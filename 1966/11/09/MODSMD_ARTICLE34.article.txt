## University Hurts Dialogue, Reduces Judicial Powers 
### Joel Kugelmass 
Part of tho judgement of the
A.S.S.U. Judicial Council during
last Spring's sit-in trial was that
the defendants should meet with
officials and faculty of the Univ
ersity to discuss the many con
flicts which had arisen. The
Council had condemned the pro
testors on the grounds that they
had not exhausted the normal
channels of communication and
thus had not behaved as respon
sible members of a democracy.
After successive considera
tions, the University has de
cided not to hold the suggested
seminars on the grounds that
the Council is in no position to
arrange such meetings. Since
apparently no other portion of
the University is in such a posi
tion, the discussions will not be
held.
This year the University has
appealed an Open House viola
tion, which the Council dis
missed, as well as a refusal of
the Council to try a non-student
who participated in the sit-in.
Equitable Distribution
It was proposed by the Coun
cil that the sit-in seminars
should consider whether dia
logue can be meaningful on this
campus, whether a University
lacking an equitable distribution
of power can give any meaning
to a diversity of opinion.
The actions of the University
suggest that such discussion is
essentially frivolous, that the
University will permit dialogue
only in so far as it is irrelevant
to Administrative decision.
The generality of the Fun
damental Standard, the power
of the Council, and importance
of discussion are now clearly
directed towards maintaining
the absolute power of the Ad
ministration while providing
the illusion of democracy.
Unilaterally Undermined
The Judicial Council, conse
quently, is made meaningful
only at the grace of the Univer
sity. The student who appears
before it may be assured that
his rights will be maintained
only if it is convenient adminis
tratively and that the efforts of
the Judicial Council to assist
him rather than punish him
may be unilaterally undermined
by the administration.
The University has been con
tent to keep its students at the

panty-raid status. Yes, it has
given drink and women (not
too oft™, but often enough to
satisfy) and it refuses to con
cede that still we are disen
chanted with the Roman circus.
When students forage into
other areas of human concern
besides sensual gratification
their liberties, their freedoms,
their right of self-determination
vanish. We might well ask how
the Judicial Council can require
that social protest be conducted
in a democratic way when the
very context is authoritarian,
when democratic processes
merely veil the oligarchy be
neath
Superficial Control
When an institution becomes
more interested in its own pre
servation than in its fulfillment,
it is atrophied. When the mem
bers of the University are only
given superficial control over
their life and their children, the
University is no longer a uni
versity.
The committee structure, the
judicial structure, the power
structure—terms rendered near
ly vaccuous by their repetion—
are seen to be more interested
in image than essence, and more
concerned with promoting a
life more pleasant than educa
tional.
It may be possible that Stan
ford is still in the country club
stage, but that does not mean
the student of this University
will accept the role of a child.
The University has made its
decision. The students shall
make theirs.

ministration while providing
the illusion of democracy.
Unilaterally Undermined
The Judicial Council, conse
quently, is made meaningful
only at the grace of the Univer
sity. The student who appears
before it may be assured that
his rights will be maintained
only if it is convenient adminis
tratively and that the efforts of
the Judicial Council to assist
him rather than punish him
may be unilaterally undermined
by the administration.
The University has been con
tent to keep its students at the

panty-raid status. Yes, it has
given drink and women (not
too oft™, but often enough to
satisfy) and it refuses to con
cede that still we are disen
chanted with the Roman circus.
When students forage into
other areas of human concern
besides sensual gratification
their liberties, their freedoms,
their right of self-determination
vanish. We might well ask how
the Judicial Council can require
that social protest be conducted
in a democratic way when the
very context is authoritarian,
when democratic processes
merely veil the oligarchy be
neath
Superficial Control
When an institution becomes
more interested in its own pre
servation than in its fulfillment,
it is atrophied. When the mem
bers of the University are only
given superficial control over
their life and their children, the
University is no longer a uni
versity.
The committee structure, the
judicial structure, the power
structure—terms rendered near
ly vaccuous by their repetion—
are seen to be more interested
in image than essence, and more
concerned with promoting a
life more pleasant than educa
tional.
It may be possible that Stan
ford is still in the country club
stage, but that does not mean
the student of this University
will accept the role of a child.
The University has made its
decision. The students shall
make theirs.
Part of tho judgement of the
A.S.S.U. Judicial Council during
last Spring's sit-in trial was that
the defendants should meet with
officials and faculty of the Univ
ersity to discuss the many con
flicts which had arisen. The
Council had condemned the pro
testors on the grounds that they
had not exhausted the normal
channels of communication and
thus had not behaved as respon
sible members of a democracy.
After successive considera
tions, the University has de
cided not to hold the suggested
seminars on the grounds that
the Council is in no position to
arrange such meetings. Since
apparently no other portion of
the University is in such a posi
tion, the discussions will not be
held.
This year the University has
appealed an Open House viola
tion, which the Council dis
missed, as well as a refusal of
the Council to try a non-student
who participated in the sit-in.
Equitable Distribution
It was proposed by the Coun
cil that the sit-in seminars
should consider whether dia
logue can be meaningful on this
campus, whether a University
lacking an equitable distribution
of power can give any meaning
to a diversity of opinion.
The actions of the University
suggest that such discussion is
essentially frivolous, that the
University will permit dialogue
only in so far as it is irrelevant
to Administrative decision.
The generality of the Fun
damental Standard, the power
of the Council, and importance
of discussion are now clearly
directed towards maintaining
the absolute power of the Ad
ministration while providing
the illusion of democracy.
