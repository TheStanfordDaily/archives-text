# Councilors Rescind Suggestion On Sit-In
## 
### 
The Judicial Council decided Mon
day to rescind its recommendation to
President Sterling that the sit-in dem
onstrators of spring quarter be placed
on probation.
The Council's action, according to
vice-chairman Joel Kugelmass, was in
response to the Administration's re
jection of an important condition of
the probation.
The two-day sit-in in President Ster
ling's office was supposedly in protest
of selective service examinations be
ing given on campus. The demonstra
tors were found guilty by the Judicial
Council of violating the Fundamental
Standard because they had failed to
exhaust possible channels of com
munication with the Administration.
Verdict Remains
Monday night's action of the Coun
cil does not change the verdict; the
demonstrators are still officially guilty,
but they are no longer on probation.
The disputed condition of the pro
bation originally required that the
demonstrators attend seminar meet
ings with faculty and Administration
members to discuss the various rami
fications of the sit-in.
In two letters to the Council Presi
dent Sterling voiced several objections
to the seminars. He felt that the Coun
cil's role was not to arrange academic
programs, and that the seminars
would, in effect, also punish faculty
members.
Fruitful Dialogue
In response to President Sterling's
objections, the Judicial Council main
tained that the seminars were really
not academic programs and that the
seminars need only meet once for a
few hours.
Additionally, the Council submitted
a long list of possible professors and
administrators who might be willing

to participate. The Council also
changed the topic of the seminars
to the question of whether fruitful
dialogue within the University is pos
sible, given its present power struc
ture.
In a third letter to the Council,
President Sterling stated that the sem
inars were still a poor idea because
there were already committees deal
ing more specifically with the ques
tion of dialogue within the University.
Because President Sterling did not

approve of the seminars as a condi
tion of the probation, the Council
decided to rescind the probation en
tirely.
According to Kugelmass, the Coun
cil considers its function to be edu
cational as well as punitive. Since the
probation would have no educational
value without the seminars, the Coun
cil decided that the probation would
therefore be ineffective.
At this time, the Council is unde
cided as to what it will recommend,
if anything.
