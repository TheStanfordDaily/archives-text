# Publication Needed For Tenure
## 
### TIM VIDAL First In A Series 
"In a university setting, a man can't
stay intellectually alive very long un
less he has serious scholarly inter
ests," announced Robert R. Sears,
Dean of Humanities and Sciences and
chairman of the Committee on Ap
pointment and Promotion.
"Such interests usually lead to scho
larly work, which in turn leads to
publications. If his main interest is
in teaching or university service his
publication may be infrequent, but if
he is the kind of man our faculty
wants for a colleague and for a
teachcr of Stanford students, the
quality of what he does publish will
be high."
High Sounding Trash
Jeffrey Smith, associate professor
of humanities and philosophy expres
sed this opinion: "Most universities
give lip service to teaching and put
their main stress on publication. I
think they also give lip service to
quality of publication but actually put
their chief stress on quantity."
"Most academic publication is high
sounding trash. The terrible conse
ouence of this appears in the kind of
PhD. dissertations that American uni
versities produce."
These two quotations reflect a prob
lem that has haunted universities for
years: to what extent should research
and publication be used as criteria for
appointment, promotion, and salary
raises?
Undergrade Neglected
A recent survey of deans at 1,100
colleges and universities by the Amer
ican Council on Education revealed
that they are still the primary con
siderations in evaluating a professor's
ability.
The issue received recent attention

at the annual conference of the Ameri
can Council of Education held in New
Orleans Oct. 12-14. It was generally
agreed at this meeting that overem
phasis on research has led to a neglect
of undergraduate teaching. An in
creased effort should be made to de
termine ways of evaluating teaching
ability.
However, few specific proposals
were made. Dr. Robert A. Nesbitt, pro
fessor of sociologv at the University
of California at Riverside, told the
group that "the primacy of research
... and the nrofessionalization of aca
demic disciplines" are "here to stay,"
despite the conflict of loyalties thev
between teaching and research.
The one student on the program.
James Johnson, former National Af
fairs Vice-President of the U.S. Na
tional Student Association, was un
able to attend the program at the last
minute, but sent a pap°r to be read
Accent Questions
"If vou want to imnrove teaching
. . . performance," Johnson wrote, "you
must be willing to accept student
questions and answers about teaching
... in colleger, arid universities todav.
Facultv teaching subiect matter can
not be confuted wi*h students learn
ing su'niects that matter."
Harold How, United Com
missioner of Education, suggested that
student opinion should be included in
the process of teacher evaluation and
that a professor's colleagues should
play a greater role in this evaluation,
too.
Naturallv tlv*; problem of attempt
ing to evaluate a teacher exists at
Stanford and is a concern of many
people, because some of the most cru
cial decisions made h°re involve the
promotion to tenure. The conse
quences of these decisions depend in

large part upon the ability of vari
out committees to evaluate a per
son's ability as an instructor and a
scholar. These committees must pre
dict how capable he will be in 10 or 20
years as well as in the next year.
Tenure Defined
Tenure represents a commitment on
the part of the university to provide
what the American Association of
University Professors refers to as
"academic freedom and economic
security for the re«t of that person's
career." They are subject to recon
sideration only in extreme cases of
incompetance, moral turpitude, or
financial exigency.
Consequently, filling a tenure posi
tion ir. a department at Stanford or
at any major university involves a
complcx system of selecting and

screening qualified candidates. Pro
cedures vary from department to de
partment, but generally follow the
same pattern.
The first steps are taken by the de
partment; it discovers a position that
needs to be filled, determines what
kind of specialist is needed to fill it
(i.e. microbiologist to fill in the grad
program, psychologist to lecture in
introductory psychology, etc.), and
sets up a committee to search the
country for candidates.
Professors Analyzed
Another committee composed of full
professors in that department then
examines the candidates' records and
publications as well as critiques of
their works by other people in that
field. They select one whom they con
sider qualified enough to warrant se
irous consideration for appointment
and employ him for a three year term
as an assistant professor.
During this time it is expected that
in addition to teaching he will work
towards scholarly publications which
can be used as evidence in the de
cision for promotion.
At the end of the three years his
case is again reviewed, his publica
tions or research examined. Either
he is hired for another three year
term, let go, or given tenure.
Decision Due
The American Association of Unl
versity Professors ruled that a uni«
versity cannot keep a man beyond
seven years without giving him ten
ure, but it is Stanford University pol
icy to let a person know within six
years whether they intend to keep
him.
If the department wants to give a
man tenure, the department head
brings the evidence to Dean Sears
