### 
Local contact with Stanford-in-Flor
ence yesterday confirmed reports that
all Stanford students have safely sur
vived the flooding of Northern Italy.
Mrs. Hersche Allen of the Overseas
Campus' office completed a telephone
call to Dr. Giuseppe Mammarella, Di
rector of Administration for Stan
ford's Italian campus, early yester
day morning. Mammarella said to "tell
parents not to worry, all students are
in good health," and that "there is
no damage to the villa."
In one of the first calls from the
flood-stricken area, Stanford Profes
sor Matthew Kahn contacted his son
Ira here at Stanford yesterday. Ira
told the Overseas Campus' Office that
students were returning to classes
Tuesday after helping to salvage dam
aged manuscripts at the national
archives.
Mrs. Allen also said that Overseas

Campus' Director Robert Walker had
wired her saying he was in contact
with Rome. He will advise the cam
pus later about the meeting of campus
directors scheduled for Florence on
November 17. Full reports from Walk-

Stanford students Gordon von
Richter and Gay Stebbins are orga
nizing a campaign to raise funds
to help restore art treasures dam
aged in the Italian floods. A booth
will be set up in front of the Post
Office today through Friday for
those who want to contribute.

or and Mammarella should be coming
later this week.
Meanwhile, rescue and relief work
continued full scale throughout five
regions of Northern and Central Italy
stricken in last weekend's floods.
In Florence, records, paintings,
sketches, rare manuscripts, and other
art works were still under water in
the Uffizi basement and at the national
library and state archives. Scholars
and curators dug through the slime
and mud left in the city's museums
and art galleries to compile a list of
damaged art treasures and salvage
what they could. It is estimated re
pairs will take years.
