The student who goes places these days
shouldn't make a move without Westinghouse.
Your best traveling companion is the
Westinghouse travel clock-radio. It has a high
impact case that's finished to look like textured
leather. And it has a metal plate for your
engraved initials or name. How's that
for a status symbol?
The clock has a jewelled movement, runs a
day and a half on one winding and doesn't draw
on the batteries.
The miniature radio is fully transistorized with
a sleep switch that shuts it off in case you don't.
And you wake up to music. If you don't, a few
minutes later, there's a bell.
It closes to about the size of a paperback.
Which makes a great traveling companion, too.
There's nothing worse than being stuck
somewhere without a good book and a
Westinghouse! See your librarian for a book. And
see us for the Westinghouse.
