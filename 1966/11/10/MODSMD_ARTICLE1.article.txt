# Activists Switch From Protest To Politics

The student protest movement is shifting
gears. Across the country activists are turning
away from protest demonstrations to get in
volved in politics.
Student dissenters are putting down their
picket signs to campaign for political can
didates, get involved in campus politics and
work for the 18-year-old vote. Many think pro
test tactics have reached a point of diminish
ing returns.
"People are bored with demonstrating," says
Carl Oglesby, immediate past president of Stu
dents for a Democratic Society, the new-left
group that has organized hundreds of protests
during the past year.
"How many people do you have to pile up
in front of the Washington Monument to see
that our demonstrations can't call a halt to the
war in Vietnam or convince anyone that we
are right? The protest has to become po
litical," Oglesby adds.
"We're building a political movement now,"
says Stokely Carmichael, chairman of the Stu
dent Non-Violent Coordinating Committee.
"The demonstrations have served their pur
pose."
The switch involves a multitude of divergent
student groups in national, state, local and
campus politics.
Across the country local Committees to end

the war in Vietnam have devoted their sum
mers to campaigning for peace candidates. On
the state level Young Americans for Freedom
are campainging hard for California guberna
torial candidate Ronald Reagan.
Students in Ann Arbor, Michigan, are push
ing for city council candidates more sympa
thetic to their views and working for the 18-
year-old vote. And on campuses like Stanford,
activists are taking over the student govern
ment.
To be sure, the trend does not mean the
end of demonstrations. At the University of
Chicago, Students Against Rank hopes to co
ordinate nationwide anti-draft protests. On
December 9 there will be a nationwide protest
of American bank loans to South Africa. And
more demonstrations against the war in Viet
nam and various university administrations
are in the offing.
But there is little doubt that the demonstra
tion itself is taking on a secondary role among
student activists. Groups like the Student
Peace Union, that are sticking exclusively
with demonstrations and ignoring politics, are
in trouble. SPU membership has plummeted
to 1,000 from 6,000 only three years ago.
Growing Cynicism
According to Philip Sherburne, past presi
dent of the U.S. National Student Association,
students are "growing cynical about demon
strating because they see little impact result.

They are getting involved with electoral pol
itics to have direct access to the political pro
cess."
An equally important reason why students
are turning away from protest is that they dis
cover they aren't needed for civil rights dem
onstrations.
"First we had to win the right to organize
and vote through four and a half years of pro
testing," explains a SNCC leader. "But now
we're involved in a political movement," she
explains in reference to SNCC's all-Negro
Black Panther party.
"Now we don't need to bring thousands of
northern students down South as we did in
1964. We're involved in registering Negroes to
vote We feel Negroes are better at getting
Negroes to vote than whites."
The shift helps explain why David Harris, a
20-year-old former Mississippi civil rights
worker, spent his summer in balmy Palo Alto,
Calif., instead of the sweltering South this
year.
"We don't fit in there any more," says Har
ris, a student at Stanford University. "The
storm-trooping job is over; it's not a move
ment any more. Most of us who went to
Mississippi feel we have to deal with our own
problems."
Harris campaigned for student body presi
dent in jeans and sandals at Stanford this
spring and won easily. Now he's out working

for his campaign causes: abolition of grades,
required courses and fraternities ,and putting
students on Stanford's board of trustees.
Amicable Administrators
Because many student radicals are running
into amicable university administrators, many
protests never get off the ground. For ex
ample, while colleges across the country were
plagued by demonstrations protesting adminis
trative decisions to hand in student class
rankings to the draft board, the campus of
Wayne State University was noticeably placid.
The reason: After SDS petitioned Wayne
President William B. Keast not to turn in
rankings, he decided the demand was legiti
mate and agreed not to turn in rankings next
year.
More important students are often so pre
occupied with politics they don't have time to
protest. When the University of California at
Berkeley expelled an activist last spring for
violating demonstration regulations some of
the same students who brought the campus to
a standstill in 1964 tried for a repeat perform
ance.
Their efforts flopped. While some cerdit
Berkeley's Ccancellor, Roger Heyns, with
averting chaos through diplomatic handling
of the affairs, informed observers think there
was a more important reason: 1,000 student
activitists were busy campaigning for con
gressional peace candidate Robert Scheer.

Organizations like SDS and the less activist
Young Americans for Freedom find their new
political slant a good selling point for high
school students.
YAF Workers
YAF says its high school membership
doubled in the past two years while its over-21
membership declined. "They'll do mundane
chores no one else will do â€”knocking on doors
and handing out leaflets. A smart politician
will make use of these kids," says YAF Presi
dent Tom Huston.
Principals aren't happy about their high
schools being turned into ideological battle
grounds for the right and left. "SDS is actively
organizing on high school campuses through
out Southern California," says Herbert Aigner,
principal of Palisades High School in Pacific
Palisades, Calif. Left-wing groups are work
ing there to liberalize school regulations.
"These youngsters seem to think they have a
lot of rights and no responsibilities. It's an
noying," says Aigner.
But not all administrators are unhappy
about the trend. At Antioch College, Vice-
President J. Dudley Dawson thinks the shift
will be a key asset to he movement. "There are
many people inside the political system who
are sympathetic with the activist's goals.
By working through political channels the
students have a greater chance of getting
tilings done."
