### 
Veteran GOP Congressman
Charles Gubser of California's
10th Congressional District,
which includes Stanford Univer
sity, will discuss the implications
of the national and statewide Re
publican victory this afternoon
at 4:15 p.m. in Tresidder. The
talk is sponsored by the Stanford
Young Republicans.
Gubser has emerged victorious
in a battle with challenger George
Leppert, a Stanford engineering
professor. The election, whrh
saw strong local interest, ended
in Gubser's 2-1 victory margin,
running well ahead of the rest
of the Republican ticket.
Since his initial election in 1952,
Gubser has risen to become a
ranking member of the House
Armed Services Committee, a' d
in that capacity has had fre
quent contact with high level
Administration personnel respon
sible for conception and imple
mentation of U.S. policy in Viet
nam. He is credited with initiat
ing the concept of an All-Asiar
Conference which evolved in.c
the Manila Conference of last
month.
It is expected that Gubser will
comment on the make-up of the
new House and how the changes
will affect Great Society legisla
tion. Some light may also be sh' % c
on the clouded GOP presidentia
prospects of '68.
