## Bergman, French Cinema Examined 
### Steve Lavine 
A. S. Barnes and Company is
rapidly becoming the foremost
publisher (in the U.S.) of books
on the cinema. Their two most
recent books, The Swedish Cin
ema by Peter Cowie and French
Cinema since 1946: The Person
al Style by Roy Armes are of
particular interest.
The Swedish Cinema (224
pages, cost about $1.95) is a his
tory of the Swedish Cinema.
The finst half of the book, deal
ing with the Swedish film indus
try up to the advent of Berg
man, is not of particular inter
est. Very few of the early Swe
dish films (with the exception
of a few by Sjostrom and Stil
ler) have been shown widely in
the U.S. These films are chiefly
of interest as forerunners and
possible influences on Bergman.
The second half of the book
deals chiefly with Ingmar Berg
man. Each of his films is de
scribed and commented upon.
Many of these reviews are far
more complete than one would
expect in a survey book of this
type. The discussion of The
Seventh Seal, Wild Strawberries,
and Virgin Spring are of par
ticular interest.
Many analogies are drawn be
tween scenes in various films of
Bergman. These are of great
value in both explicating the
films themselves and in charting
Bergman's development. A great
deal more time, however, could
have been spent explaining the
influence of both the early Swe
dish masters and modern film
makers on Bergman's develop
ment.
Cowie has many genuine in
sights into Bergman. His expli
cations fall down only when he
attempts to oversimplify or to
render occurences in the films
into concrete symbols.

Because the book is built
around desc ntions of individ
ual films, it should be very use
ful as a ref> ronce work.
The Fremn ' .neina since 1946
(175 pages, cost about $1.95)
sets it sights on the impossible
... to write a complete yet con
cise history of the last 20 years
of the French cinema. The num
ber of directors and the number
of films involved is simply too
great for one small book. As a
result Hiroshima Mon Amour
receives two pages, Jules and
Jim slightly over one page, and
A Bout de Souffle about three
fourths of a page.
The two great mainstays of
the book are the fantastic num
ber of relatively obscure pieces
of information that are worked
into the text [about Une Fem
me Marie . . . "long passages of
quotation (from Celine for hu
mour in the middle and Racine
for poetry at the end)"] and the
great number of quotations
from the directors [Godard:
"What I like too is the diary
principle. I should like, for ex
ample, to make a film about
myself which would relate my
life during . . . let's say a fort
night, while I would be trying
to write a novel. I don't know
if I should succeed or not. It
would be my life in the course
of trying to write a novel . . ."]
Armes allows the directors to
explain their own theories and
comment on their own films.
Armes draws many analogies
between films and manages to
tie the diverse ends of the mod
ern French cinema into a fairly
coherent scheme. The French
Cinema since 1946 should serve
as both a good introduction to
the modern French cinema and
as a sound reference work for
the filmgoer.
