# GOP Gains Nationally

Republicans cut deeply into
the Democrats' House majority,
gained strength in the Senate,
and evened the count on gover
norships.
Democrats won continued con
trol of the 435-member House of
Representatives in Tuesday's
elections but big Republican
gains plus a pickup in conserva
tive strength in the South spelled
trouble for President Johnson.
Republican gains of 47 seats
exceeded the off-year average
and whittled the Democratic ma
jority to the lowest it has been
since the 1956 elections.
While the Democrats will have
an apparent working majority of
some 25 above the 218 mark, this
could be deceptive since a big
block of these Democrats are
conservative Southerners who
often refuse to accept Johnson's
liberal domestic proposals.
Gain Is Above Average
With the unofficial count com
plete, the Democrats held 248
seats and the Republicans 187
for a 47-seat gain running well
above the average of 40 which
has been traditional for the out
party in off-year elections.
The husky Republican gain
will be reflected also in narrower

majorities for the Democrats on
House committees. With Demo
crats holding a 295-140 margin
in the 89th Congress, committees
were formed roughly on a 2-1
ratio. This ratio may be trimmed
in the 90th Congress to more
nearly reflect the reduced ma
jority.
Big Republican victories for
Govs. George .Romney of Mich
igan and James A. Rhodes in
Ohio carried over into the House
races. In each state the Repub
licans gained five seats at the ex
pense of the Democrats.
Republicans have gained three
new Senate seats and have
scored a dramatic triumph by
electing the first Negro ever
chosen for the body by popular
vote.
They captured the third seat
from the Democrats in Oregon
where Gov. Mark O. Hatfield de
feated Dem. Robert B. Duncan.
The Democrats easily retained
control of the Senate in yester
day's voting but, despite high
hopes in several states, failed to
unseat a single Republican.
With only two races still re
maining unsettled, the Senate
lineup stands at 64-34 Demo
cratic. It was 67-33 in the 89th
Congress which adjourned last
month.
Massachusetts Atty. Gen. Ed
ward B. Brooke was the Negro
victor in one of the nation's most
closely watched Senate races. He
will be the first member of his
race to serve in the Senate since
reconstruction days.
Brooke handily defeated for
mer Massachusetts Gov. Endi
cott Peabody. Brooke's triumph,
along with some of the other
GOP new faces that emerged in
the election, is likely to strength
en the party's liberal wing in the
Senate.
The two GOP pickups of seats
now held by Democrats came in
Illinois where industrialist
Charles H. Percy smashed the
hopes of veteran Sen. Paul H.
Douglas for a fourth term and
in Tennessee where Howard H.
Baker, son-in-law of Senate Re
publican leader Everett M. Dirk
sen, trounced the one-time boy
orator, Gov. Frank G. Clement.
Reagan Leads Charge
Republicans swept to victory
in 20 governor's races with po
litical newcomer Ronald Reagan
and veteran George Romney
leading the charge.
Eight Democratic-held gover
norships fell before the GOP

surge, with the jewel in the Re
publican crown Reagan's one
sided triumph in California over
Democratic incumbent Edmund
G. (Pat) Brown.
Democrats nibbled back by
knocking over the Republican
governors of Kansas and Maine,
but over-all it was a banner day
for the GOP.
Georgia's first two-party race
for governor in a century trig
gered court action and charges
of polling irregularities as
write-in votes of moderates and
liberals led to a no-win elec
tion.
Republican Howard H. Calla
way held a lead over Democrat
Lestern G. Maddox in late re
turns from the Tuesday voting.
But write-in ballots for moderate
Ellis G. Amall, a former gov
ernor, denied either nominee a
required majority.
A no-majority vote under the
state constitution throws the
election into the heavily Demo
cratic legislature. But the Ameri
can Civil Liberties Union (AC
LU) went into federal court to
prevent a decision by the legisla
ture.
Presidential Possibilities
Romney boosted his stock in
the 1968 GOP presidential nom
ination sweepstakes with an easy
third-term victory in Michigan
over Democratic State Chairman
Zolton Ferency. Republicans
took over from the Democrats in
Arizona, Arkansas, Fori d a,
Maryland, Nebraska, New Mexi
co and Nevada, as well as in Cali
fornia.
Republican Ronald Reagan at
tributed his overwhelming vic
tory for governor of California
to a desire among voters for a
pause in social legislation advo
cated by the Democrats.
"This was the biggest kind of
backlash we had in the country,"
said the 55-year-old actor, who
made his debut in the political
arena by burying two-term Dem
ocratic Gov. Edmund G. Brown
under a majority of around a
million votes.
Reagan swept up all but three
of California's 58 counties, win
ning several Democratic strong
holds that went for Brown in
1958 and 1962.

Republicans cut deeply into
the Democrats' House majority,
gained strength in the Senate,
and evened the count on gover
norships.
Democrats won continued con
trol of the 435-member House of
Representatives in Tuesday's
elections but big Republican
gains plus a pickup in conserva
tive strength in the South spelled
trouble for President Johnson.
Republican gains of 47 seats
exceeded the off-year average
and whittled the Democratic ma
jority to the lowest it has been
since the 1956 elections.
While the Democrats will have
an apparent working majority of
some 25 above the 218 mark, this
could be deceptive since a big
block of these Democrats are
conservative Southerners who
often refuse to accept Johnson's
liberal domestic proposals.
Gain Is Above Average
With the unofficial count com
plete, the Democrats held 248
seats and the Republicans 187
for a 47-seat gain running well
above the average of 40 which
has been traditional for the out
party in off-year elections.
The husky Republican gain
will be reflected also in narrower

majorities for the Democrats on
House committees. With Demo
crats holding a 295-140 margin
in the 89th Congress, committees
were formed roughly on a 2-1
ratio. This ratio may be trimmed
in the 90th Congress to more
nearly reflect the reduced ma
jority.
Big Republican victories for

scored a dramatic triumph by

chosen for the body by popular

from the Democrats in Oregon
where Gov. Mark O. Hatfield de

unseat a single Republican.

Massachusetts Atty. Gen. Ed

mer Massachusetts Gov. Endi
cott Peabody. Brooke's triumph,
along with some of the other
GOP new faces that emerged in
the election, is likely to strength
en the party's liberal wing in the

cott Peabody. Brooke's triumph,
along with some of the other
GOP new faces that emerged in
the election, is likely to strength

The two GOP pickups of seats

Reagan Leads Charge
Republicans swept to victory
in 20 governor's races with po
litical newcomer Ronald Reagan
and veteran George Romney
leading the charge.
Eight Democratic-held gover
norships fell before the GOP

surge, with the jewel in the Re
publican crown Reagan's one
sided triumph in California over
Democratic incumbent Edmund
G. (Pat) Brown.
Democrats nibbled back by
knocking over the Republican
governors of Kansas and Maine,
but over-all it was a banner day
for the GOP.
Georgia's first two-party race
for governor in a century trig
gered court action and charges
of polling irregularities as
write-in votes of moderates and
liberals led to a no-win elec
tion.
Republican Howard H. Calla
way held a lead over Democrat
Lestern G. Maddox in late re
turns from the Tuesday voting.
But write-in ballots for moderate
Ellis G. Amall, a former gov

required majority.
A no-majority vote under the
state constitution throws the
election into the heavily Demo

Presidential Possibilities
Romney boosted his stock in
the 1968 GOP presidential nom
ination sweepstakes with an easy
third-term victory in Michigan
over Democratic State Chairman
Zolton Ferency. Republicans
took over from the Democrats in
Arizona, Arkansas, Fori d a,
Maryland, Nebraska, New Mexi
co and Nevada, as well as in Cali
fornia.
Republican Ronald Reagan at
tributed his overwhelming vic
tory for governor of California
to a desire among voters for a
pause in social legislation advo
cated by the Democrats.
"This was the biggest kind of
backlash we had in the country,"
said the 55-year-old actor, who
made his debut in the political
arena by burying two-term Dem
ocratic Gov. Edmund G. Brown
under a majority of around a
million votes.
Reagan swept up all but three
of California's 58 counties, win

holds that went for Brown in
1958 and 1962.

Republicans cut deeply into
the Democrats' House majority,
gained strength in the Senate,
and evened the count on gover
norships.
Democrats won continued con
trol of the 435-member House of
Representatives in Tuesday's
elections but big Republican
gains plus a pickup in conserva
tive strength in the South spelled
trouble for President Johnson.
Republican gains of 47 seats
exceeded the off-year average
and whittled the Democratic ma
jority to the lowest it has been
since the 1956 elections.
While the Democrats will have
an apparent working majority of
some 25 above the 218 mark, this
could be deceptive since a big
block of these Democrats are
conservative Southerners who
often refuse to accept Johnson's
liberal domestic proposals.
Gain Is Above Average
With the unofficial count com
plete, the Democrats held 248
seats and the Republicans 187
for a 47-seat gain running well
above the average of 40 which
has been traditional for the out
party in off-year elections.
The husky Republican gain
will be reflected also in narrower

majorities for the Democrats on
House committees. With Demo
crats holding a 295-140 margin
in the 89th Congress, committees
were formed roughly on a 2-1
ratio. This ratio may be trimmed
in the 90th Congress to more
nearly reflect the reduced ma
jority.
Big Republican victories for
Govs. George .Romney of Mich
igan and James A. Rhodes in
Ohio carried over into the House
races. In each state the Repub
licans gained five seats at the ex
pense of the Democrats.
Republicans have gained three
new Senate seats and have
scored a dramatic triumph by
electing the first Negro ever
chosen for the body by popular
vote.
They captured the third seat
from the Democrats in Oregon
where Gov. Mark O. Hatfield de
feated Dem. Robert B. Duncan.
The Democrats easily retained
control of the Senate in yester
day's voting but, despite high
hopes in several states, failed to
unseat a single Republican.
With only two races still re
maining unsettled, the Senate
lineup stands at 64-34 Demo
cratic. It was 67-33 in the 89th
Congress which adjourned last
month.
Massachusetts Atty. Gen. Ed
ward B. Brooke was the Negro
victor in one of the nation's most
closely watched Senate races. He
will be the first member of his
race to serve in the Senate since
reconstruction days.
