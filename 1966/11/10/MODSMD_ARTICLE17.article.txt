# WILDLIFE SATELLITE?
## 
### 
The next Nimbus weather
satellite may draw a bead on
wildlife as well as storms.
For a start, scientists hope
Nimbus will collect useful data
from a herd of African ele
phants. Eventually, if the ex
periment is successful, the satel
lite may zero in on sea turtles,
polar bears, whales, and other
animals whose day-to-day move
ments are difficult to trace.
By monitoring wildlife, ecolo
gists hope to learn more about
the mysteries of migration and
gather data to protect species
threatened with extinction, the
National Geographic Society
says.
When you have a good steak
for dinner it's obvious you didn't
get a bum steer.
