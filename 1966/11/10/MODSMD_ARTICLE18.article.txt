# Beban Lengthens Lead
## UCLA, SC Again Lead Stats Away We Go 
### 
UCLA and Southern California
continue to dominate the AAWU
team statistics, despite the fact
that both have been upset in
the past two weeks.
The Bruins still lead all three
offensive categories and hold
down second in total and rushing
defense behind the Trojans.
Washington State, the only team
to break into the UCLA-USC
statistical monopoly, retained its
first place position in passing de
fense.
In individual statistics, UCLA
quarterback Gary Beban tight
ened his hold on first place in the
Pacific Eight's total offense race,
and Oregon State's bruising full
back Pete Pifer carried the ball
for 229 yards to put himself
well ahead of Bruin Mel Fair in
league rushing. Stanford's Jack
Root is third in rushing with a
175 yard net season gain
Other individual tares became
much tighter al'lei I.Â»st week's
games. I'ifer, who added three
louchdowir: to his previous to
tal of s<;ven, came within two
points of first place I'ruin Mel
Pair, in seoi ing slat islies.
In receiving, Trojan .Uon Drake
grabbed three passes to creep
up on league leadei Doug Flans
burg of Washington Slate, who
currently has 50 receptions to
Drake's 1(5. Indian Bob Conrad
holds third place with ,'W re
cepl ions.
The Tribe found itself pretty
much out of the running for
team leads. Stanford is third
in total offense behind UCLA
and USC and a precarious fourth
in rushing offense ,only sixteen
yards ahead of Washington. In
all other categories, the Cards
are in the bottom four, including
league standings where they are
last with an 0-3 record.
