## Cold Facts And Punt Returns 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Tim Haight and Carrick Pat
terson have brought up a wide
spread problem. I am quite con
vinced that the so-called "sci
ence requirement," as currently
administered at most colleges,
serves only to deepen the pre
vailing ignorance and suspicion
with which many otherwise
quite literate people view scien
tific subjects. A liberal arts
major spends a year or so in an
introductory science course, in
which he memorizes a series of
rules, learns how to solve cer
tain restricted types of problems,
and performs laboratory exer
cises in which, as he knows in
advance what his results should
be, he chiefly learns to doctor his
data. Not surprisingly, he
emerges with the idea that sci
ence is a coldly factual field,
with little scope for intuition or
creativity, in which one's only
aim is to arrive at a predeter
mined "right" answer.

The aim of a General Studies
type science course should not be
to teach students to solve Phys
ics 1 problems, which they for
get a month after the final. It
should be to give students an
idea of how scientists and engi
neers think and operate.
It would also, hopefully, go
into the impact of the "sci
entific" world-view (and the
many misconceptions thereof)
on modern thought and society.
In short, it would be a course in
the history and philosophy of
science.
I would like to see science ma
jors take such a course, too. In
fact, one feature of my proposed
course might be the formation
of discussion groups consisting
of both science-oriented and hu
manities-oriented people, in
which both groups would be
forced to re-examine some of
their stereotyped conceptions of
each others' fields.
Isn't there anyone at Stan
ford who is capable of—and in
terested in—teaching a General
Studies course of this nature?
There's simply no reason why
it should be so difficult for stu
dents to find out "what the hell
science has been doing all this
time."

As Stanford prepares to travel
to UCLA this weekend, an im
portant question remains unan
swered (Nick Selby fails to ask
it, and I have refrained for 2
full seasons, fearing the label
of "Armchair Quarterback"):
can't we alter our 4th down de
fensive strategy, i.e. punt re
turns?

Our past (and present) policy
has been to rush the entire front
line (plus linebackers) in the
hopes of blocking that kick
(How many Roughing-the-Kicker
penalties have we had?). This
results in a Cecil B. DeMille spec
tacles (debacle) of sorts:
1. The Red Hordes rush in.
2. Th e Blue - Gold - Crimson-
Purple Hordes rush out.
3. The projectile soars over
head (How many punts have we
ever blocked under Coach
John?).
4. The single Red Hero brave
ly (foolishly) receives the pro
jectile.
5. . . . (you guessed it!) . . .

The B.G.C.&P. Hordes massacre
the Red Hero (What is our aver
age yardage gained on punt re
turns in 2 years? How many
Heroes have been injured on
punt returns?).
Come on, Coach, have a heart:
block those offensive linemen at
the line ot scrimmage, don't wait
around to clip later. Let the two
defensive ends see if they can
run 15 yards in 1 second. Let's
beat the Bruins, huh? We're go
ing to need every runback we
can get, and, oh yes, . . . pray
for rain. TED M. LAU

In a week when Stanford stu
dents, for the first time in the
University's 75 - year history,
elected a Homecoming Queen,
complete with Princesses, I find
a picture in a national magazine
showing a "Leland Stanford"
coed—along with ladies From
Bryn Mawr, Vassar and Swarth
more demonstrating outside
the White House with the sign
"MR. PRESIDENT (Wilson)
WHAT WILL YOU DO FOR
WOMAN SUFFRAGE?"
The generation's gap is not
quite the way I thought it was.

• Cherchez!
Editor, The Daily:
I am happy to see that stu
dent discontent with the Over
seas Campus situation has been
defined and focussed through
the pages of the Daily; but I
would be very sad to see this
issue drop from sight, fade with
time and lassitude as do so
many Daily-championed causes.
My own overseas experience
was happy and profitable; my
group, as a whole, was happy
and well-knit, despite a minor
Profumo-type cabinet scandal.
This does not mean that the
Overseas Campus office can sit
on its duff, that Dr. R. A. Walk
er can pat himself on the back,
and ignore the blatant inade
quacies of the system. He can
not gloss over problems of local
administration, location, and
lack of local contact.

Minor irritations, which would
be absorbed by our massive
home campus, achieve major
proportions in a close-packed
community of eighty people. He
cannot dismiss student discon
tent without at least trying to
understand the complex inter
weaving of personal frustration,
disillusionment, and isolation
which may drive a student to
put his foot through a door, or
to reveal a little of the dirt be
neath the veneer of the Hotel
Panhans.
There are grave problems
with the Overseas Campuses.
Dr. Walker would do well to
open his eyes, to try to under
stand the student viewpoint.
When he comes to visit, he does
not have to eat the food we eat,
nor speak the language that we
speak. And who can say which
irritates a Frenchman more—a
bluff, hardy English-speaking
bonhomme tourist, or a bare
footed student who at least tries
to speak the language?
If a calm serene surface is de
sired, alors, cherchez la cause de
ces vagues facheuses!

• Windex Needed
Editor, The Dally:
Friday I attended the Black
Power conference at Berkeley
and was fortunate enough to
hear Stokely Carmichael, Ron
Karenga, James Bevel and oth
ers in person. Fortunate indeed,
for upon reading articles about
the conference in the San Fran
cisco Examiner and the New
York Times, I found little if any
accurate reporting of what went
on.

The Times article dealt with
Reagan-Brown chirping about
the conference, not the confer
ence itself.
The Examiner article bore
some slight resemblance to what
happened, but its headline
("Stokely Lashes at Whites in
UC Rally") and its choice of
quotes and misquotes served to
give a biased and inaccurate pic
ture of the conference. Carmi
chael took pains to explain that
pro-black does not mean anti
white, but that the majority of
the press (whom he called "ad
men") persist in equating the
two. The Examiner article is a
striking example of such distor
tion. What Carmichael and other
upstarts are saying is that may
be, just maybe, white American
society is not so civilized as it
thinks, that the problems of vio
lence and racism here and
abroad come not from the Rock
wells and the Wallaces, but from
you and me, brother, and the
majority of whites in this coun
try.

News media are the windows
through which most of us view
society. We're just beginning to
see, and we need cleaner win
dows. If dirty windows turn you
off, you can find a major por
tion of Carmichael's speech in
the article, "What We Want," in
The Movement, Nov. 1966. Mean
while, have hope that journal
ism is indeed alive and well in
Argentina.

• Write-in For OFF!
Editor, The Daily:
Over half of the undergradu
ate women signed a petition
stating that the policy requiring
them to live on-campus be
changed immediately. This was
how the quarter began. A few
weeks later, the student body
voted on the issue. The result
was overwhelmingly in favor of
immediate action to change this
rule.

In the face of such strong
student opinion, the administra
tion has remained silent. No of
ficial rationale of the status quo
has been made. Could it be that
there ARE no logical arguments
against it? Why is everyone
from the President down to the
lowest dean silent when it is
plain that a clear statement of
the logic behind present policy
is necessary? This is not a con
troversial issue—no one is op
posing it. No one except perhaps
the administration—whose only
response has been to ignore the
issue and rely on inertia to
make their case for them. Their
case so far is: That's the way
we do it at Stanford.
There is, however, a chance
that this issue will be brought
up before the Trustees at their
next meeting on November 17th.
So far, it has been impossible to

obtain a guarantee that the is
sue will be on the agenda. Since
only Sterling and the Trustees
can make a decision of this na
ture, we must make it known
to them that a decision is neces
sary NOW. They could change
present policy on November
17th. They could make off-cam
pus living for undergraduate
women possible WINTER quar
ter. They could also procastinate
on this issue as long as they
like. Don't let this happen!
Write to President Sterling im
mediately and urge him to set
tle the matter on November
17th. If you voted for "OFF!" or
if you signed the petition, you
deserve to be listened to as an
individual by the President. The
more lettens, the more clearly
the urgency of this matter is ex
pressed. JANET HOWELL
