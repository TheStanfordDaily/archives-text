In the current controversy over appointments
to die Presidential Advisory Committees, the
crashing of rhetorical cymbals has become the
clashing of power symbols, with both the Presi
dent of the University and the Student Body
President adding to the clangor.
As in the past President Sterling requested
the Student Body President, Dave Harris, to
submit recommendations for student appoint
ments to the committees. Instead of submitting
two recommendations for each position, Harris
chose to submit only one in the belief that stu
dent members ought to be the express represen
tatives of the Associated Students and respon
sible to ASSU.
When the President's appointments were
made public this week, thirty-two of Harris'
forty nominees found themselves with commit
tee assignments. Contending that representation
on committees should be on a constituency basis,
Harris requested that President Sterling's addi
tional appointees not accept assignments and,
if they chose to serve, that they not be called
student representatives.
Thus the President, as the symbolic source
of power with the right to control committee
memberships ,and David Harris, with his view
that each constituency ought to be accorded a
share of power and allowed to name its own
representatives, have come into conflict. Yet be
neath the din of argument and intransigence
rests untouched the purpose for which the com
mittees are established.
We view the Presidential committees as in
struments of communication and advice for the
President, as sources and focal points for the
best ideas of all three segments of the com
munity. The question of absolute power to
name members becomes less significant when
the primary purpose of the committees is seen

as communication. And hence the criteria for
appointments, while respecting presently con
stituted authority, must assure that all views are
heard.
The Harris recommendations were, in large
part, made from questionnaires filled out during
the spring and early weeks of this quarter. While
the recommendations for several committees
were made with one eye on politics, the ma
jority of Harris' selections were qualified and
interested students chosen without reference to
their membership in the so-called Harris camp.
Prior decision as to the merits of any position
hardly coincides with a call for fresh ideas. Both
the President, in refusing to accept the slate of
Harris' recommendation, and Harris, labelling
the President's additional appointments non-stu
dent, have passed judgment on the value of peo
ple's ideas before discussion has begun.
That Harris' slate did leave some gaps which
in the best interests of several committees re
quired further representation, there can be no
denial. However, we believe that within the
combination of the Harris slate and the addi
tional Presidential appointments lies the locus of
ideas. The question remains whether all the
voices will be heard.
We frankly hope that President Sterling and
David Harris will reflect upon the recent amal
gamation of the Dean's Office study of the
freshman year and a similar study by ASSU.
Having acceded to the locus of ideas, the com
bined committee is advancing with its common
concern of improving the freshman year.

We see no reason why a similar arrangement
might not be effected with Presidential Com
mittees. The locus of power does rest with the
President, but the locus of ideas goes somewhat
further.

Thus the President, as the symbolic source
of power with the right to control committee
memberships ,and David Harris, with his view
that each constituency ought to be accorded a
share of power and allowed to name its own
representatives, have come into conflict. Yet be
neath the din of argument and intransigence
rests untouched the purpose for which the com
mittees are established.
We view the Presidential committees as in
struments of communication and advice for the
President, as sources and focal points for the
best ideas of all three segments of the com
munity. The question of absolute power to
name members becomes less significant when
the primary purpose of the committees is seen

as communication. And hence the criteria for
appointments, while respecting presently con
stituted authority, must assure that all views are
heard.
The Harris recommendations were, in large
part, made from questionnaires filled out during
the spring and early weeks of this quarter. While
the recommendations for several committees
were made with one eye on politics, the ma
jority of Harris' selections were qualified and
interested students chosen without reference to
their membership in the so-called Harris camp.
Prior decision as to the merits of any position
hardly coincides with a call for fresh ideas. Both
the President, in refusing to accept the slate of
Harris' recommendation, and Harris, labelling
the President's additional appointments non-stu
dent, have passed judgment on the value of peo
ple's ideas before discussion has begun.
That Harris' slate did leave some gaps which
in the best interests of several committees re
quired further representation, there can be no
denial. However, we believe that within the
combination of the Harris slate and the addi
tional Presidential appointments lies the locus of
ideas. The question remains whether all the
voices will be heard.
We frankly hope that President Sterling and
David Harris will reflect upon the recent amal
gamation of the Dean's Office study of the
freshman year and a similar study by ASSU.
Having acceded to the locus of ideas, the com
bined committee is advancing with its common
concern of improving the freshman year.

We see no reason why a similar arrangement
might not be effected with Presidential Com
mittees. The locus of power does rest with the
President, but the locus of ideas goes somewhat
further.
In the current controversy over appointments
to die Presidential Advisory Committees, the
crashing of rhetorical cymbals has become the
clashing of power symbols, with both the Presi
dent of the University and the Student Body
President adding to the clangor.
As in the past President Sterling requested
the Student Body President, Dave Harris, to
submit recommendations for student appoint
ments to the committees. Instead of submitting
two recommendations for each position, Harris
chose to submit only one in the belief that stu
dent members ought to be the express represen
tatives of the Associated Students and respon
sible to ASSU.
When the President's appointments were
made public this week, thirty-two of Harris'
forty nominees found themselves with commit
tee assignments. Contending that representation
on committees should be on a constituency basis,
Harris requested that President Sterling's addi
tional appointees not accept assignments and,
if they chose to serve, that they not be called
student representatives.
