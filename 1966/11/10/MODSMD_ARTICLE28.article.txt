## Fringe Benefits Of A Red Hot Prof 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
I wish to thank all my friends
at Stanford who elected me
"Red Hot Prof" and who then
contributed and continue to con
tribute so generously to help
pay for my wife's and my plane
tickets to the Coast.
It was such a delightfully
lunatic weekend from beginning
to end that we sometimes won
der if it were an hallucination.
But the deep affection we met
from so many people reminds
us that it was for real. I am
very proud and happy to have
been so honored; I only wish
that there had been more time
to go to all the parties to which
we were invited.
Teaching has intrinsic re
wards, but occasions like this
are glorious dividends which no
words can describe. Thank you
all. CHARLES R. BEYE

Editor, The Dally:
For the benefit of Mr. Allen
(Letters to the Editor October
28) neither Ulysses nor Crime
and Punishment are short
stories. I would be interested to
hear from Mr. Canzoneri (Let
ters October 27) whether he

really wants editors to Instruct
their reviewers as to how they
should write, and I would re
mind him that publication in
Harper's or New Yorker is in no
sense a guarantee of literary
greatness.

• Woeful Differences
Editor, The Daily:
With all due respect to Char
lotte Ackerley, I believe that the
Austria II articles have under
emphasized the most basic dif
ferences between the first and
second Austria groups:
(1) The hotel staff's antago
nism or whatever it was
toward the students was general
ly the same in each case, but
patience-born restraint naturally
broke after a certain period of
time: Austria II heard the com
plaints kept silent for Austria I.
(2) Curiously, the autumn
winter phase in Semmering of

fers weather superior to that in
the spring-summer phase; we
had either dry, clear weather or
snowy, skiing weather, for the
most part, in Austria I.

(3) There were surely much
less reasonable academic de
mands placed upon the second
group than upon ours.
(4) Most importantly, the
course schedule of Austria I re
lated incomparably more to the
historical, political and cultural
environment of the campus than
did that of Austria 11.
Please accept these considera
tions, along with the more pub
licized student attitude of belli
gerence, in evaluating the woes
of Austria n.

• Library Maze
Editor, The Daily:
Twice this quarter, the library
has not had copies of books I

have needed. Since the inter
library loan program is not nor
mally extended to include under
graduates, I must buy these
books or do without them. Or
dering books through the Stan
ford bookstore gets expensive
and can take two and a half
weeks . . . meanwhile, the paper
must be turned in.
Soon our new library will
open. It will be depressing and
a bit pathetic, I think, if more
well selected books do not ac
company the new structure.

• So Why?
Editor, The Dally:
Presently David Harris is try
ing to abolish fraternities and
first-rate athletics at Stanford,
and I naturally ask why. Does
the answer to this question lie
in Mr. Harris' own shortcom
ings?
Is it because he is lazy and
not willing to put forth the
energy it takes to succeed in
these two areas? Or is it be
cause he is a coward and is
afraid to try in these directions
for fear he might fail?
Finally, I wonder, is it because
he has already tried and failed
and has become embittered? In
any case, it would seem that if
he can not have something,
David Harris does not want any
one else to have it either. I would
say he is very selfish.

Austria I
• Library Maze
Editor, The Daily:
Twice this quarter, the library
has not had copies of books I

have needed. Since the inter
library loan program is not nor
mally extended to include under
graduates, I must buy these
books or do without them. Or
dering books through the Stan
ford bookstore gets expensive
and can take two and a half
weeks . . . meanwhile, the paper
must be turned in.
Soon our new library will
open. It will be depressing and
a bit pathetic, I think, if more
well selected books do not ac
company the new structure.

Editor, The Dally:
Presently David Harris is try
ing to abolish fraternities and
first-rate athletics at Stanford,
and I naturally ask why. Does
the answer to this question lie
in Mr. Harris' own shortcom
ings?
Is it because he is lazy and
not willing to put forth the
energy it takes to succeed in
these two areas? Or is it be
cause he is a coward and is
afraid to try in these directions
for fear he might fail?
Finally, I wonder, is it because
he has already tried and failed
and has become embittered? In
any case, it would seem that if
he can not have something,
David Harris does not want any
one else to have it either. I would
say he is very selfish.

I wish to thank all my friends
at Stanford who elected me
"Red Hot Prof" and who then
contributed and continue to con
tribute so generously to help
pay for my wife's and my plane
tickets to the Coast.
It was such a delightfully
lunatic weekend from beginning
to end that we sometimes won
der if it were an hallucination.
But the deep affection we met
from so many people reminds
us that it was for real. I am
very proud and happy to have
been so honored; I only wish
that there had been more time
to go to all the parties to which
we were invited.
Teaching has intrinsic re
wards, but occasions like this
are glorious dividends which no

For the benefit of Mr. Allen
(Letters to the Editor October

and Punishment are short
stories. I would be interested to
hear from Mr. Canzoneri (Let

really wants editors to Instruct
their reviewers as to how they
should write, and I would re
mind him that publication in
Harper's or New Yorker is in no

• Woeful Differences
Editor, The Daily:
With all due respect to Char
lotte Ackerley, I believe that the
Austria II articles have under
emphasized the most basic dif
ferences between the first and
second Austria groups:
(1) The hotel staff's antago
nism or whatever it was
toward the students was general
ly the same in each case, but
patience-born restraint naturally
broke after a certain period of
time: Austria II heard the com
plaints kept silent for Austria I.
(2) Curiously, the autumn
winter phase in Semmering of

fers weather superior to that in
the spring-summer phase; we
had either dry, clear weather or
snowy, skiing weather, for the
most part, in Austria I.

(3) There were surely much
less reasonable academic de
mands placed upon the second
group than upon ours.
(4) Most importantly, the
course schedule of Austria I re
