## Abolish Scholarships! 
### Kirk Hanen 
Let's abolish scholarships.
Now that I've won the atten
tion —or undying animosity—of
a conspicuous segment of the
University community, let me
proceed.
Over 2.3 million dollars is
given out to Stanford students
in gifts and endowments each
year. None of it finds its way
back into Stanford coffers—ex
cept as it pays for room, board,
books, and tuition.
Naturally, there are often
more applicants than there are
scholarships. The most "eligi
ble" students get the most mon
ey, and the rest go begging—to
loan funds, jobs, assistantships,
et al.
Low Bates
Loan funds, in comparison,
will provide better than 2 million
dollars worth of help at Stan
ford this year, at rates almost
too good to be hoped for. Most
of these loans are negotiated on
a long term basis, with initial
monthly repayment beginning
six months after the recipient
has finished his undergraduate
or graduate education.
My suggestion is that the Uni
versity take all the money cur
rently earmarked for scholar
ships and grants-in-aid and pool
it with money now in its loan
program. Every student who
needs help will then be eligible
to get it from this loan pool.
What are the benefits?
• The most obvious is that

the University will have money
for everyone who has legitimate
need for it. The aid program
will cease to debilitate itself. It
will be replenished each year—
with interest added to fatten the
pot and pay costs of adminis
tering the program.
No Burden
• Those who take out loans
will not be financially burdened
while they pursue their studies.
They will pay their indebtedness
when they are most able—when
they have finished their educa
tion and have either a job or a
husband. Many have argued that
it is somehow unfair to saddle
a young person with the seem
ingly insurmountable debt of,
say, $lO,OOO. Viewed as an in
vestment in himself, the reality
is not so harsh. Maybe the stu
dent recipient fresh out of col
lege will not be able to buy a
new car every year, or put a
down payment on a house, but
doesn't this act as a curb on in
flation?
• Establishment of such a
fund will, to a great extent, re
lieve the University's reliance on
spontoneous or solicited alumni
gifts. Let's not forget that with
financial independence comes
greater academic freedom—cer
tainly one of the cornerstones of
any educational plant.
Self Analysis
• The loan situation will force
many students to ask them
selves just exactly how badly

they want to continue their education.
This will serve to cut out
the "deadwood" and thin the
ranks of the professional student.

they want to continue their edu
cation. This will serve to cut out
the "deadwood" and thin the
ranks of the professional stu
dent.
And, if nothing else comes out
of the program, it will certainly
relieve stress on grades and aca
demic standings as the "cur
rency of education." The sys
tem makes whores of us all, but
some more than others. Scholar
ships will cease to be a means
of luring the better students to
Academe. If a Stanford educa
tion is worth having, it's also
worth paying for.
What I've said is not so radi
cal: we buy everything on time
anyway—so why not education.
