# Freshman English Encourages Creativity In Thinking, Writing
## 
### 
The Freshman English Program this
year has been geared to encourage
students to read more about higher
education and current events. Ac
cording to Prof. Albert Guerard, stu
dents can take more real interest in

the work since much pressure is re
lieved by the higher grades given this
year—a B for average work. Emphasis
is put on student imagination instead
of grades.
Guerard writes in "The Aims of
Freshman English" that colleges
across the country have become dis
gusted with their Freshman English
courses.
"Pervasive discouragement has led
to a number of colleges to abandon
the course, replace it by a general
humanities course on literary, philo
sophical and sociological subjects, or—
in a very few instances—with fresh
man seminars."
For Guerard the chief aim of Fresh
man English is to teach students to
write clear, expository prose, and yet
no single method has a clearly demon
strable effect on this ability. Intelli
gent, sensitive reading of serious liter
ature makes up another important
part of this course.
Guerard hopes the new suggested
grading practices, approved by the de
partment, will relieve "the common
shock of receiving low grades and
severe criticism for the first time in
the opening month of college." This
shock can have "serious and often
lasting consequences: the student
may quickly give up his high ambi
tions and his sense of intellectual ex
citement."
In 1961, a faculty study showed
about one-third of the entering class
received much lower grades than an
ticipated. For one in ten students,
grades dampened morale. Because of
the new programs, the freshman
grade point average has risen steadily
for all courses. Pass-fail and deferred
grades further reduce freshman dis
comfort.
Guerard declares that as a basic
course in writing and reading, Fresh
man English "should be concerned
with the student as a person, with
his capacity to respond to experience
intellectually, emotionly and imagina
tively."
Guerard concludes that, although
many of the failures of students in
society are due to insufficient intel
lect, many other failures result from
lack of imagination and atrophy of
the emotions.
"Our students will not write truly
well unless they are capablp of mas
tering strange analogies and of creat
ing new combinations of words and

images. Nor will they write truly
well unless they are able to impose a
personal accent, a speaking human
voice, on the inherited and sometimes
worn language and often slack
rhythms of prose."
Finally Guerard insists that the aim
of the program is that the student
discover the identity of thought and
expression — complete and focused
thinking. Guerard agrees with Or
well's "Politics and the English Lan
guage." "We can regenerate our
thinking through our writing."
