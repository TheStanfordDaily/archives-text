# Survey Reveals Voters' Apathy
## 
### RENTON ROLPH 
Political apathy still remains wide
spread in the Stanford student body.
Surveys of the polling places sur
rounding the campus (the predomin
ant student precincts are 2544 and
2549) revealed yesterday that only 54
percent of registered student voters
actually went to the polls. This was
the first opportunity for most under
graduates over 21 to vote.
The Stanford faculty, however, lit
erally thronged to the polls. An amaz
ing 92.2 perecnt of the voters regis
tered in precinct 2542, a predomin
atly faculty residence area, visited
their polling place yesterday. Most
faculty have, of course, voted in prev
ious elections.
Having elected one of the nation's
most controversial student body
presidents, the Stanford student body
was thought to be emerging from its
traditional complacency. However,
Tuesday's showing disappointed many
concerned about political commit
ment among students.
Reasons for students' failure to vote
vary from excuse to rationalization:
one resident of Crother's Memorial
Hall commented, "I live in Hawaii
and I haven't been back for quite
awhile. So why vote?" Another la
mented, "In my home state you can't
register by mail." And one admitted,
"I just forgot to write for my absen
tee ballot."
One recent graduate felt that the
54 percent turnout reprsented little
change from the situation during his
Stanford years. He glibly concluded,
'The world is stagnant and shall
always be so."
For whom and for what the 54 per
cent cast their ballots has not been
released by the Santa Clara County
Registrar of Voters. His office in San
Jose disclosed yesterday that a break
down of their precinct tally machines
has caused the delay. Although the
overall count for Santa Clara County
has been completed the machine fail
ure has delayed the individual count
within each of the 900 precincts

spread in the Stanford student body.
