# Bill Proposes Finances To Support 'Experiment'
## 
### HERBERT TERRY 
A bill to provide $1500 for the ad
ministration of the Experiment and
a referendum citing "patronization of
the student body by the President's
office" will be included In discussion
at tonight's LASSU meeting. The
meeting will begin at 7:30 in room
320.
Other proposed resolutions call for
a presentation of the "OFF" refer
endum results to the Board of Trus
tees and for an investigation into the
reecnt Homecoming Queen elections.
Transference of Funds
The bill provides for the transfer
ence of $1500 from the contingency
fund to the ASSU President's com
mittee. It is stipulated that funds be
used for the Experiment, a series of
non-credit seminar counses dealing
with contemporary topics. The Ex
periment has been strongly supported
by ASSU President Dave Harris.
In supporting its charges of patron
ization the first suggested resolution
cites President Sterling's failure to
appoint several selections for advisory
committees made by the ASSU Presi
dent, as well as Sterling's addition
of students of his own choice to the
committees.
Calls For Meeting
The proposed resolution also claims
that President Sterling acted "with
out reference to the LASSU or the
ASSU President." It notes that the
legislature approved the selections
made by the ASSU president as well
as his desire to make student mem
bers responsive to the ASSU.
The resolution calls for the LASSU

to instruct the ASSU President to call
a student body meeting on White
Memorial Plaza and to consider ap
propriate action to insure the recog
nition of the ASSU as the source of
student opinion within the University.
A second resolution, sponsored by
Mimi Wells, concerns the recent
"OFF" referendum which proposed a
choice for undergraduate women be
tween on or off campus housing.
This referendum was approved by a
10-1 majority.
Explaining that "over 60 per cent of
the undergraduate women expressed
their support of this proposition in a
separate petition (and that) the Board
of Trustees is empowered to change
University policy" the resolution calls
for LASSU to inform President Ster
ling of the expressed student opinion
and to urge him to bring the issue
before the November 17 meeting of the
Board of Trustees calling for "an im
mediate revision of University policy."
The resolution also calls for referral
of the matter to the Committee of
Fifteen for discussion and presenta
tion to the various University con
stituencies.
'Doubts' About Elections
A final resolution expresses "grave
doubts as to the true outcome of the
recent election of Cardinals Board's
1966 Homecoming Queen elections."
In writing the bill, Allen Munro, its
sponsor, explains "in the interest of
truth and justice that the Associated
Students of Stanford University be
informed as to the actual result of the
election."

The resolution requests that the
Cardinal's Board be compelled to sur
render the ballots cast in the election
to the speaker of the legislature.

the undergraduate women expressed
their support of this proposition in a
separate petition (and that) the Board
of Trustees is empowered to change
University policy" the resolution calls
for LASSU to inform President Ster
ling of the expressed student opinion
and to urge him to bring the issue
before the November 17 meeting of the
Board of Trustees calling for "an im
mediate revision of University policy."
The resolution also calls for referral
of the matter to the Committee of
Fifteen for discussion and presenta
tion to the various University con
stituencies.
'Doubts' About Elections
A final resolution expresses "grave
doubts as to the true outcome of the
recent election of Cardinals Board's
1966 Homecoming Queen elections."
In writing the bill, Allen Munro, its
sponsor, explains "in the interest of
truth and justice that the Associated
Students of Stanford University be
informed as to the actual result of the
election."

The resolution requests that the
Cardinal's Board be compelled to sur
render the ballots cast in the election
to the speaker of the legislature.
A bill to provide $1500 for the ad
ministration of the Experiment and
a referendum citing "patronization of
the student body by the President's
office" will be included In discussion
at tonight's LASSU meeting. The
meeting will begin at 7:30 in room
320.
Other proposed resolutions call for
a presentation of the "OFF" refer
endum results to the Board of Trus
tees and for an investigation into the
reecnt Homecoming Queen elections.
Transference of Funds
The bill provides for the transfer
ence of $1500 from the contingency
fund to the ASSU President's com
mittee. It is stipulated that funds be
used for the Experiment, a series of
non-credit seminar counses dealing
with contemporary topics. The Ex
periment has been strongly supported
by ASSU President Dave Harris.
In supporting its charges of patron
ization the first suggested resolution
cites President Sterling's failure to
appoint several selections for advisory
committees made by the ASSU Presi
dent, as well as Sterling's addition
of students of his own choice to the
committees.
Calls For Meeting
The proposed resolution also claims
that President Sterling acted "with
out reference to the LASSU or the
ASSU President." It notes that the
legislature approved the selections
made by the ASSU president as well
as his desire to make student mem
bers responsive to the ASSU.
The resolution calls for the LASSU

to instruct the ASSU President to call
a student body meeting on White
Memorial Plaza and to consider ap
propriate action to insure the recog
nition of the ASSU as the source of
student opinion within the University.
A second resolution, sponsored by
Mimi Wells, concerns the recent
"OFF" referendum which proposed a
choice for undergraduate women be
tween on or off campus housing.
This referendum was approved by a
10-1 majority.
Explaining that "over 60 per cent of
the undergraduate women expressed
their support of this proposition in a
separate petition (and that) the Board
of Trustees is empowered to change
University policy" the resolution calls
for LASSU to inform President Ster
ling of the expressed student opinion
and to urge him to bring the issue
