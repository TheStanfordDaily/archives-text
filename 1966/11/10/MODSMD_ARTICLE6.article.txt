# Socialized Medicine Discussed
## 
### CHARLES FULKERSON 
At a panel discussion last night at
Tresidder, three representatives of the
medical profession expressed their
approval of socialized medicine. The
meeting was sponsored by the Pre-
Medical Society, Sigma Phi Sigma.
Dr. William Creger of the Stanford
;School emphasized the necessity to
define what is needed under "a cen
tralized kind of system". In this sys
tem, he noted, it would be necessary
to consider problems of education and
distribution of new physicians. He
also noted increased costs with soical
ized medicine but felt that perhaps
now we were spending too little.
Santa Clara County Medical Secre
tary Thomas Donovan outlined the
past history of socialized medicine
in the U.S. in support of his argu
ment that the A.M.A. has suppressed
the issue.
The final speaker Dr. Keith Taylor,
concluded by giving examples of soc
ialized medicine in England. Although
generally in favor, he hoped that
Americans would not make the same
mistakes as England.
