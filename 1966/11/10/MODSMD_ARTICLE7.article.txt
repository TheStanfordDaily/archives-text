# Publication Requirements Justified
## 
### TIM VIDALE (Second In a Series 
"In a large university there are
more people who cherish the oppor
tunity to do research," says Robert R.
Sears, Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences, "whereas in a small liberal arts
college there are apt to be fewer re
search-minded people."
"Anyone who feels an unhappy
pressure to do scholarly work and
who uses the pejorative term 'publish
or perish' should not be in a faculty
position of a major university. A man
who dislikes scholarly work but nev
ertheless wants to be on a particular
university faculty will usually end up
as one who publishes AND perishes."
There are several reasons why publi
cation and evidence of scholarly re
search remains a major criterion in
the evaluation of teachers being con
sidered for appointment, promotion or
an increase in salary within a uni
versity. One is the assumption that
is made by most university professors
and administrators that the type of
person who is interested in teaching
on the university level is also very
likely to be interested in continuing
research and publication.
A person being considered for a ten
ure position must have demonstrated
his competence in both teaching and
scholarly research. According to Dean
Sears he must be "superb in one area
and at least very good in the other.'
There is no specific requirement
that a person continue research or
publication once he has received ten
ure but presumably he will because
of his interest in keeping up with the
latest developments in his field, and

in sharing with the scholarly world
any discoveries that he has made.
Some also feel that writing helps to
clarify the professor's thoughts.
Professor Albert J. Guerard of the
English department pointed out that
writing forces a person to corroborate
his statements. Teachers that do not
continue with research often become
"irresponsible and whimsical" for this
reason.
Publication is also a major factor
in the evaluation of teachers in higher
education because of the difficulty of
determining a person's teaching abil
ity. This is the reason that everyone
who is considered for a tenure posi
tion at Stanford must have published
something.
"It is hard to evaluate teaching,"
said Dean Sears, "because there are
so many kinds of teachers." A person
might be excellent in a seminar but
ineffective or uninspiring as a lec
turer. Others are best in working
with graduates on a one-to-one basis.
Virgil K. Whitaker, Dean of the
Graduate Division, pointed out three
reasons why publication is the best
criterion for evaluating a teacher. The
first is that personal opinions fre
quently enter in when a person's col
leagues or students are asked to eval
uate his teaching ability.
The second is that it is difficult to
to define what a good teacher is. Is
a good university teacher the one that
is top in his field and slightly dull, or
one that is extremely inspiring and
yet not as knowledgeable? Is it the
professor that has an immediate effect
on the thinking of his students, or
the one that is only appreciated years

later? Until it is possible to define
what is meant by a good teacher, it
will be difficult to objectively evaluate
a teacher's ability.
Dean Whitaker's third reason is
that when publication is used as a cri
terion it is possible to get the opinions

of experts in the specific field from
all over the world. Evaluation com
mittees either read critiques that have
already been written or thoy send
the person's publications and other
evidence of research around to people
whom they hope can determine the
quality of his work.
Dean Sears admitted that there are

some who would make excellent
teachers who have never published,
but said the university "rarely will
take the risk" of awarding tenure
without some evidence of a person's
ability to express himself on paper.
"Publication is a criterion for the
quality of a person's mind," he com
mented.
The three aspects of writing that re
flect the quality of a scholarly publi
cation according to Miss Jacqueline
Strain, a Western Civ instructor are:
"the depth of research that has gone
into the work, the quality of the ideas
that emerge or conceptualization, and
the quality of writing."
Another professor analyzed the sit
uation at Stanford through a different
set of reasoning. "A major reason
why publication remains a prerequis
ite for promotion," according to John
Kaplan, an associate professor in the
Law School, who has published con
siderably, "is that: graduate students
want to work with a scholar (i.e. a
man who has a name for himself
and who can have some influence in
securing his students university jobs
elsewhere) not simply a great class
room teacher.
"But it is only through publication
that faculty members can acquire
the prestige necessary to secure
effectively the graduate students un
der them the type of jobs and posi
tions that they are usually seeking
and the grants that they need for
their research. In addition, the grad
uate students know that they may
get their first notoriety by assisting
their professors in some publication
of work."
