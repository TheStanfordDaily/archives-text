# News In Brief
## Draft Call Easing; Quotas To Lower In '67 
### Compiled From the Associated Press 
WASHINGTON—The Pentagon called yes
terday for a draft of 27,600 men in January,
the lowest total for a full month since last
summer.
The Defense Department's request to the
Selective Service system for December was
12,100, but this reflects an intake only over a 16-
day period preceding the Christmas holiday.
Draft calls in the past six months have
averaged 33,500 a month, but Secretary of De
fense Robert S. McNamara said last weekend
that manpower requests for early 1967 would
drop.
The Pentagon chief said he expects an
average of fewer than 25,000 men a month to
be drafted during the December-March period.
• Possible Test Ban Break
WASHINGTON—The American government
is investigating the possibility of a Soviet
violation of the limited ban on nuclear testing,
the State Department said yesterday.
"We are looking into that," Press Officer Rob
ert J. McCloskey said when the question came
up at his news conference.
"The integrity of the test ban treaty is of
primary importance to the United States."
McCloskey declined to discuss the matter
further. He had been asked about a story in
yesterday's New York Times that there were
indications that a September 27 underground
explosion by the Soviet Union may have vio
lated the test ban treaty by releasing radio
active materials that were carried beyond
Soviet borders.

• Indian Cabinet Change
NEW DELHI, India—Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi took control of India's police yesterday
in a cabinet change forced upon her by bloody
rioting over the slaughter of cows.
With crucial national elections approaching
early next year, Mrs. Gandhi requested the
resignation of Home Minister Gulzari Lai
Nanda, whose responsibilities included the po
lice. President Sarevpalli Radhakr accepted it.
He gave the portfolio temporarily to Mrs.
Gandhi.
The executive committee of the ruling Con
gress Party and opposition groups had accused
Nanda of failing to take adequate measures
to prevent the rampage in the capital Monday
by Hindu extremists demanding a total ban
on the slaughter of cows.

• VC Supplies Captured
SAIGON —Only light, sporadic ground fight
ing was reported across Vietnam yesterday,
but American infantry men turned up a rich
booty in Communist arms and supplies in Tay
Ninh Province, the scene of almost a week of
hard fighting near the Camborian border.
U.S. lst-Division infantrymen combing

Tuesday's battlefield uncovered a tunnel com
plex that had been part of a regimental corn
man post. In it they found a "massive array"
of supplies and equipment and 95 bodies, while
nearby they uncovered a mine factory with 450
Claymore-type mines.
• Erhard On The Way Out
BONN, Germany—West German politicians
weighed the chances yesterday of four candi
dates to head their government after Chan
cellor Ludwig Erhard finally agreed to step
aside.
Stung by a sharp parliamentary setback,
Erhard said Tuesday he would support any one
of those four nominated by leaders of his
Christian Democratic Party.
Christian Democrats in parliament sched

pected to take up the leadership issue until
today. They may make a choice Friday, but
there was also a possibility the decision might
be put off until after the state election in
Bavaria November 20.
• Gemini 12 Postponed
CAPE KENNEDY, Fla.—High hopes dashed

a 24-hour delay because of problems in one of

two automatic pilot systems in the Titan 2

• Sheppard Trial Continues
CLEVELAND— The state rested its second
degree murder charge against Samuel H. Shop
pard yesterday, with surprise testimony from

wife, Marilyn.

• Indian Cabinet Change
NEW DELHI, India—Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi took control of India's police yesterday
in a cabinet change forced upon her by bloody
rioting over the slaughter of cows.
With crucial national elections approaching
early next year, Mrs. Gandhi requested the
resignation of Home Minister Gulzari Lai
Nanda, whose responsibilities included the po
lice. President Sarevpalli Radhakr accepted it.
He gave the portfolio temporarily to Mrs.
Gandhi.
The executive committee of the ruling Con
gress Party and opposition groups had accused
Nanda of failing to take adequate measures
to prevent the rampage in the capital Monday
by Hindu extremists demanding a total ban
on the slaughter of cows.

• VC Supplies Captured
SAIGON —Only light, sporadic ground fight
ing was reported across Vietnam yesterday,
but American infantry men turned up a rich
booty in Communist arms and supplies in Tay
Ninh Province, the scene of almost a week of
hard fighting near the Camborian border.
U.S. lst-Division infantrymen combing

Tuesday's battlefield uncovered a tunnel com
plex that had been part of a regimental corn
man post. In it they found a "massive array"
of supplies and equipment and 95 bodies, while
nearby they uncovered a mine factory with 450
Claymore-type mines.
• Erhard On The Way Out
BONN, Germany—West German politicians
weighed the chances yesterday of four candi
dates to head their government after Chan
cellor Ludwig Erhard finally agreed to step
aside.
Stung by a sharp parliamentary setback,
Erhard said Tuesday he would support any one
of those four nominated by leaders of his
Christian Democratic Party.
Christian Democrats in parliament sched
uled a meeting yesterday, but were not ex
pected to take up the leadership issue until
today. They may make a choice Friday, but
there was also a possibility the decision might
be put off until after the state election in
Bavaria November 20.
• Gemini 12 Postponed
CAPE KENNEDY, Fla.—High hopes dashed
again, the Gemini 12 pilots saw their four-day
satellite hunt and space walk journey stalled
until Friday when new troubles sprang up
yesterday in their rocket booster.
For the second day in a row, officials ordered
a 24-hour delay because of problems in one of

two automatic pilot systems in the Titan 2
rocket tabbed to propel Gemini 12 aloft.
Navy Capt. James A. Lovell Jr. and Air
Force Maj. Edwin E. Aldrin Jr. now are set to
soar skyward at 3:46 p.m. (EST) Friday, r i

• Captain Hears Charges
TREASURE ISLAND, Calif. —It was a wom

Capt. Archie Kuntze in Saigon, the proser i

Kuntze is charged with misconduct during
the time he headed a $60 million supply com
mand in South Vietnam.
Capt. Joseph E. Ross, who presented the
case against Kuntze, claimed in his final argu

misconduct in the defendant's Vietnam affair \
• Sheppard Trial Continues
CLEVELAND— The state rested its second
degree murder charge against Samuel H. Shop
pard yesterday, with surprise testimony from
a trim, gray-haired women crime tracer.
Common Pleas Judge Francis J. Talty thO
directed the defense to proceed today. He
refused to dismiss the charge against Sheppard
in the July 4, 1964, bludgeoning of his first
wife, Marilyn.
The state called 14 witnesses to outline its
case in a trial that began October 24. This was
less than half of the 30 witnesses called by the
state in Sheppard's first trial 12 years ago.
WASHINGTON—The Pentagon called yes
terday for a draft of 27,600 men in January,
the lowest total for a full month since last
summer.
The Defense Department's request to the
Selective Service system for December was
12,100, but this reflects an intake only over a 16-
day period preceding the Christmas holiday.
Draft calls in the past six months have
averaged 33,500 a month, but Secretary of De
fense Robert S. McNamara said last weekend
that manpower requests for early 1967 would
drop.
The Pentagon chief said he expects an
average of fewer than 25,000 men a month to
be drafted during the December-March period.

• Erhard On The Way Out
BONN, Germany—West German politicians
weighed the chances yesterday of four candi
dates to head their government after Chan
cellor Ludwig Erhard finally agreed to step
aside.
Stung by a sharp parliamentary setback,
Erhard said Tuesday he would support any one
of those four nominated by leaders of his
Christian Democratic Party.
Christian Democrats in parliament sched
uled a meeting yesterday, but were not ex
pected to take up the leadership issue until
today. They may make a choice Friday, but
there was also a possibility the decision might
be put off until after the state election in
Bavaria November 20.
• Gemini 12 Postponed
CAPE KENNEDY, Fla.—High hopes dashed
again, the Gemini 12 pilots saw their four-day
satellite hunt and space walk journey stalled
until Friday when new troubles sprang up
yesterday in their rocket booster.

two automatic pilot systems in the Titan 2
rocket tabbed to propel Gemini 12 aloft.
Navy Capt. James A. Lovell Jr. and Air

• Captain Hears Charges
TREASURE ISLAND, Calif. —It was a wom
an who brought about the troubles of Navy
Capt. Archie Kuntze in Saigon, the proser i
tion charged yesterday at his court-martial.
Kuntze is charged with misconduct during
the time he headed a $60 million supply com
mand in South Vietnam.
Capt. Joseph E. Ross, who presented the
case against Kuntze, claimed in his final argu
ments that there was a "continuous thread" of
misconduct in the defendant's Vietnam affair \
• Sheppard Trial Continues
CLEVELAND— The state rested its second
degree murder charge against Samuel H. Shop
pard yesterday, with surprise testimony from
a trim, gray-haired women crime tracer.
Common Pleas Judge Francis J. Talty thO
directed the defense to proceed today. He
refused to dismiss the charge against Sheppard
in the July 4, 1964, bludgeoning of his first
wife, Marilyn.
The state called 14 witnesses to outline its
case in a trial that began October 24. This was
less than half of the 30 witnesses called by the
state in Sheppard's first trial 12 years ago.
WASHINGTON—The Pentagon called yes
terday for a draft of 27,600 men in January,
the lowest total for a full month since last
summer.
The Defense Department's request to the
Selective Service system for December was
12,100, but this reflects an intake only over a 16-
day period preceding the Christmas holiday.
Draft calls in the past six months have
averaged 33,500 a month, but Secretary of De
fense Robert S. McNamara said last weekend
that manpower requests for early 1967 would
drop.
The Pentagon chief said he expects an
average of fewer than 25,000 men a month to
be drafted during the December-March period.
• Possible Test Ban Break
WASHINGTON—The American government
is investigating the possibility of a Soviet
violation of the limited ban on nuclear testing,
the State Department said yesterday.
"We are looking into that," Press Officer Rob
ert J. McCloskey said when the question came
up at his news conference.
"The integrity of the test ban treaty is of
primary importance to the United States."
McCloskey declined to discuss the matter
further. He had been asked about a story in
yesterday's New York Times that there were
indications that a September 27 underground
explosion by the Soviet Union may have vio
lated the test ban treaty by releasing radio
active materials that were carried beyond
Soviet borders.

• Indian Cabinet Change
NEW DELHI, India—Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi took control of India's police yesterday
in a cabinet change forced upon her by bloody
rioting over the slaughter of cows.

early next year, Mrs. Gandhi requested the
resignation of Home Minister Gulzari Lai
Nanda, whose responsibilities included the po
lice. President Sarevpalli Radhakr accepted it.
He gave the portfolio temporarily to Mrs.
Gandhi.
The executive committee of the ruling Con
gress Party and opposition groups had accused
Nanda of failing to take adequate measures
to prevent the rampage in the capital Monday
by Hindu extremists demanding a total ban
on the slaughter of cows.
