Presenting The Drinking Song for Sprite:
"ROAR, SOFT-DRINK, ROAR!"
(To the tune of "Barbara Fritchie")
Traditionally, a lusty, rousing fight song is
de rigeur for every worthy cause and institution.
But we wrote a song for Sprite anyway. We'd like you
to sing it while drinking Sprite, though this may
cause some choking and coughing. So what? It's all in
good, clean fun. And speaking of good, clean things,
what about the taste of Sprite? It's good. It's
clean. However, good clean things may not exactly be
your idea of jollies. In that case, remember that
Sprite is also very refreshing. "Tart and tingling,"
in fact. And very collegiate. And maybe we'd better
quit while we're ahead. So here it is. The Drinking
Song For Sprite. And if you can get a group together
to sing it--we'd be very surprised.
Roar, soft drink, roar!
You're the loudest soft drink
we ever sawr ! 112
So tart and tingling, they 1 U W iM I

to sing it while drinking Sprite, though this may
cause some choking and coughing. So what? It's all in
good, clean fun. And speaking of good, clean things,
what about the taste of Sprite? It's good. It's
clean. However, good clean things may not exactly be
your idea of jollies. In that case, remember that
Sprite is also very refreshing. "Tart and tingling,"
in fact. And very collegiate. And maybe we'd better
quit while we're ahead. So here it is. The Drinking
Song For Sprite. And if you can get a group together
to sing it--we'd be very surprised.

Presenting The Drinking Song for Sprite:
"ROAR, SOFT-DRINK, ROAR!"
(To the tune of "Barbara Fritchie")
Traditionally, a lusty, rousing fight song is
de rigeur for every worthy cause and institution.
But we wrote a song for Sprite anyway. We'd like you
to sing it while drinking Sprite, though this may
