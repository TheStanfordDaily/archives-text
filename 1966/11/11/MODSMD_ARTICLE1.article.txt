# Forced Publishing ‘Chokes Our Libraries'
## 
### TOM VIDAL (Third in a Series) 
"Very few people should publish;"
according to Jeffrey Smith, associate
professor of humanities and philoso
phy, "only those who have something
important to say, and the capacity to
say it well. The extreme pressure to
publish results in publication of ba
nalities and chokes our libraries with
trash."
Smith was referring to American
universities and colleges in general
and said that the emphasis on quan
tity at Stanford was minor. All of the
people interviewed for this series
seemed to agree that publications are
usually carefully analyzed for quality.
Smith went on to say that although
he has written "almost nothing," he
will write when he feels a "great in
ternal pressure to write what I have
to say in my own way and in my own
time, but I have no interest whatso
ever for publication for its own sake.
To put pressure on everyone to pub
lish is to guarantee mediocrity of pub
lication."
He concluded by saying that he felt

that "the essential Ingredient of schol
arship is thought not publication."
This is the most frequently criti
cized aspect of the present method of
evaluating instructors, and one of the
most difficult to correct. The implicit
necessity to publish often puts an un
comfortable pressure on teachers
which can result in inferior teaching
and publication.
Lucio P. Ruotolo, who recently re
ceived tenure as an associate profes
sor in English, said that "pressure to
publish a book definitely exists" dur
ing the six years as an assistant pro
fessor.
He also said that although publica
tion is an important criterion for the
quality of a person's mind the time
used to publish tends to interfere with
the amount of time that a person can
give to his students. To carefully pre
pare for a class, grade examinations
and papers, and be available for per
sonal help takes time, and specifically
time which might be used on the re
search or writing of a paper that
could help to determine an entire ca
reer. It is not essential for the person

to write a book, but as W. Bliss Car
nochan, assistant professor in English
said, "books are safer."
More Time
Robert R. Sears, Dean of Humani
ties and Sciences, and chairman of the
Committee on Appointment and Pro
motion, said that a student would
probably find better classroom teach
ers at a small liberal arts college than
at the undergraduate level in a uni
versity simply because in a small col
lege the teachers have more time to
prepare for class lectures and semi
nars.
Some people claim that the problem
is that instructors in a large univer
sity are hired to teach while they are
evaluated by how well they write.
They claim that this is the reason
that undergradu ate introductory
courses are sometimes taught by a
dull or uninspiring instructor who has
been given a teaching position be
cause of his expertise in research.
Another frequent criticism is that
the pressure of time imposed upon a
person seeking tenure in a particular
university detracts from the quality
of publication.

"To set up a timetable for the
young scholar," insisted Ruotolo, "by
which one can estimate precisely
when the number of articles and The
Book which shall determine his whole
career shall be forthcoming is to de

tract from the purposes of scholar
ship. In many cases it becomes much
easier to put the responsibility of de
termining the quality of a manuscript
upon the editor of a publishing house,
or the United Press International in
their review of the work."
Even the type of material that can
be published is limited by the time
element. Usually, the doctoral disser
tation is expanded for the first major
publication, since it is a topic that
the person has already done some re
search in and can probably finish in
the time alotted to him. Doctoral dis
sertations are almost of necessity on
limited topics, such as examining one
author's works rather than comparing
authors.
Ruotolo said that books which re
quire years of research are often im
possible to complete and have pub
lished during the six year trial peri
od, particularly since the first two or
three years of teaching in a university
are "very traumatic," in terms of prep
aration lectures, establishing methods
of teaching, and adjusting to a new
community.

The fact that publication often
seems to be a more important con
sideration than teaching ability in the
evaluation of a teacher is also a fre
quent source of criticism. Student
opinion reaches the evaluation com
mittees mostly by osmosis. "The de
partment can tell what the students
think of a particular teacher."
A teacher in a department where
students are asked to evaluate their
teachers may submit this as evidence
in his favor, but unless he does the
committees that evaluate him are not
allowed to see the results of these
polls. However, one administrator said
that a teacher rarely brings student
questionnaires for evidence in his fa
vor because "it is almost an admis
sion of his weakness in research and
publication."
Another consequence of the present
emphasis on publication is "The Aca
demic Marketplace" which has been
described by Theodore Caplow and
Reece J. McGee in their book under
that title. Publication allows colleges
and universities across the nation to
