## 
### 
There seems to be a great deal
of support in many phases of
the population for lowering the
voting age to eighteen, a survey
conducted by Moderator maga
zine reports.
Of the persons answering the
poll, an overwhelming majority
of Senators, Representatives,
and student leaders replied that
they thought that the vote
should be extended to eighteen-,
nineteen-, and twenty-year-old
citizens.
President Johnson, and past
Presidents Kennedy, Eisenhow
er, and Roosevelt also have ex
pressed their support of this type
of action. In addition, twenty
one of the Governors respond
ing to the survey favored giving
18-year-olds the vote.
Of the forty-six U.S. Senators
questioned, forty-one reported
that they favored the change in
voting age. One-hundred and
twenty-five members of the
House of Representatives have
endorsed the lower voting age.
Philip Werdell, editor of Mod
erator, said in the survey: "In
Michigan, a proposition for in
creasing suffrage to eighteen-,
nineteen-, and twenty-year-old
citizens was placed on the ballot
for a state-wide referendum. Al
though most state politicians,
Republican and Democrat, en

dorsed the issue, they never cam
paigned for it. They are afraid to
he opposed because they could
alienate young, new voters, yet
they seldom risk as much as one
sentence in one campaign speech
to raise the arguments for the
18-Year-Old Vote."
In addition to the politicians
polled in the survey, the maga
zine also asked leaders in stu
dent governments their opinion
on the question. Only thirty
seven out of 415 students re
plied that they did not favor the
change in voting age.
These students also said that
they believed that there was a
large majority of students who
favored a change in voting age.
But they said that there were
only a few students on each
campus who would be willing to
work for the passage of mea
sures which would allow 18-year
olds to vote.
