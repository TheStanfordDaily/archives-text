# Beauxâ€™ Stratagem Shows Fair Talent
## 
### CURT KECK Entertainment Editor 
Wednesday night's Undergrad
uate Speech and Drama produc
tion of "The Beaux' Stratagem"
was not a deft performance of
George Farquhar's seventeenth
century comedy; however, it
was, "as the saying goes," full
of laughs and potential acting
talent.
The comedy revolves around
the connivances of two brothers
who, disenfranchized by Eng
land's practice of primogeniture,
risk the last two hundred
pounds of their fortune and pose
as the wealthy Viscount Aimwell
(Les Kratter) and his rakish
servant Archer (Darrell Salk).
Plotting to unite Aimwell and
Dorinda (Lesley Crosten), and
not incidentally her dowry, in
connuptial bliss, the brothers
blackmail an Irish priest, put
their minds to seductive wits,
foil the foolery of three high
waymen, and generally bam
boozle everyone in the play.
The performance, played to a
sparse audience in the Nitery,
seemed at times to suffer from a
lack of vitality. Although the
play began well and finished in
the flurry of happiness for
everyone ever after, the middle
acts dragged and sagged. Far

quhar'e rhetoric is heavy and
must be spoken crisply and with
confidence if the myriad roman
ces and schemes are to be suc
cessfully threaded through to
curtain drop.
The overall acting was pleas
ing; but unfortunately the ama
teur undergraduate nature of
the production was born out in
the many slurred and missed
lines.
Far and away the most im
pressive actor, Darrell Salk was
the perfect roue, jostling the
fancies of Cherry (Reba Wa
ters) and Mrs. Sullen (Janis
House), while masterminding
he and his brother's hood
winkery.
Reba Waters as the sauce-box
Cherry, inkeeper's daughter and
promiscuous virgin, also turned
in a fine performance. Miss
Waters radiated beautifully,
style-wise and physically, the na
tural and innocentent charms
of a country girl in love. Also
a standout was Jon Hardy who
played the expatriot Irishman
who was uproariously uncon
vincing in trying to pass him
self off as a French priest. Hardy
was very properly a consum
mate ham in his facial expres
sions and his thick Irish brogue.
Otherwise quite polished, Janis
House's performance as the
georgeous Mrs. Sutten was flaw
ed by a couple lines which she
confused or omitted.
Les Kratter used at least one
quart more syrup than the recipe
for wooing Lesley Crosten called
for. Kratter never came across
as resourceful or confident
enough for the audience to con
sid e r him really rumaging
around Merry Ole England look
ing in bedrooms for beauties
with booty. Miss Costen was
painfully unconvincing after she
received a few laughs at the
start and began to over affect
her role.
The occasional harpsichord
music, composed and played by
Sam Swartz, and the opulent cos
tuming fit well into the produc
tion, both greatly complimenting
the intended atmophere of Eliza
bethan England.
"The Beaux' Stratagem" is not
a professional production, but
neither is it a poor production.
Taking into account that most of
the actors are fledgling histrions,
Director William Sharp's pro
duction is largely excellent, if
only for the fresh talent and
great potential that it brought
before the floodlights.

waymen, and generally bam
boozle everyone in the play.
The performance, played to a
sparse audience in the Nitery,
seemed at times to suffer from a
lack of vitality. Although the
play began well and finished in
the flurry of happiness for
everyone ever after, the middle
acts dragged and sagged. Far

quhar'e rhetoric is heavy and
must be spoken crisply and with
confidence if the myriad roman
ces and schemes are to be suc
cessfully threaded through to
curtain drop.
The overall acting was pleas
ing; but unfortunately the ama
teur undergraduate nature of
the production was born out in
the many slurred and missed
lines.
Far and away the most im
pressive actor, Darrell Salk was
the perfect roue, jostling the
fancies of Cherry (Reba Wa
ters) and Mrs. Sullen (Janis
House), while masterminding
he and his brother's hood
winkery.
Reba Waters as the sauce-box
Cherry, inkeeper's daughter and
promiscuous virgin, also turned
in a fine performance. Miss
Waters radiated beautifully,
style-wise and physically, the na
tural and innocentent charms
of a country girl in love. Also
a standout was Jon Hardy who
played the expatriot Irishman
who was uproariously uncon
vincing in trying to pass him
self off as a French priest. Hardy
was very properly a consum
mate ham in his facial expres
sions and his thick Irish brogue.
Otherwise quite polished, Janis
House's performance as the
georgeous Mrs. Sutten was flaw
ed by a couple lines which she
confused or omitted.
Les Kratter used at least one
quart more syrup than the recipe
for wooing Lesley Crosten called
for. Kratter never came across
as resourceful or confident
enough for the audience to con
sid e r him really rumaging
around Merry Ole England look
ing in bedrooms for beauties
with booty. Miss Costen was
painfully unconvincing after she
received a few laughs at the
start and began to over affect
her role.
The occasional harpsichord
music, composed and played by
Sam Swartz, and the opulent cos
tuming fit well into the produc
tion, both greatly complimenting
the intended atmophere of Eliza
bethan England.
"The Beaux' Stratagem" is not
a professional production, but
neither is it a poor production.
Taking into account that most of
the actors are fledgling histrions,
Director William Sharp's pro
duction is largely excellent, if
only for the fresh talent and
great potential that it brought
before the floodlights.
Wednesday night's Undergrad
uate Speech and Drama produc
tion of "The Beaux' Stratagem"
was not a deft performance of
George Farquhar's seventeenth
century comedy; however, it
was, "as the saying goes," full
of laughs and potential acting
talent.
The comedy revolves around
the connivances of two brothers
who, disenfranchized by Eng
land's practice of primogeniture,
risk the last two hundred
pounds of their fortune and pose
as the wealthy Viscount Aimwell
(Les Kratter) and his rakish
servant Archer (Darrell Salk).
Plotting to unite Aimwell and
Dorinda (Lesley Crosten), and
not incidentally her dowry, in
connuptial bliss, the brothers
blackmail an Irish priest, put
their minds to seductive wits,
foil the foolery of three high
waymen, and generally bam
boozle everyone in the play.
