# Sharp Gives Views On Drama
## 
### SUE RAKER 
Dr. William Sharp, associate
professor of drama and under
graduate drama advisor, has di
rected the department produc
tion of "The Beaux' Stratagem"
which is being presented in the
Nitery Theater through this
week.
Sharp has been at Stanford
since the summer of 1964, when
he directed "The Duchess of
Malfi" in the Shakespeare Festi
val. He acted that fall in a pro
duction of "The Seagull," and
since then, he's directed "The
Critic" (summer of 1965) and
"All's Well That Ends Well"
(with the Stanford Repertory
Company last winter) and has
acted in "The Good Woman of
Setzuan." Sharp has always
worked in academic theater:
"I've never wanted to make my
living as a professional actor,
but I enjoy plays and like to be
in them."
After receiving his B.A. and
M.A. from the University of Chi
cago, he taught English at Rice
Institute—where, incidentally, he
co-directed with Gerald Hiken,
who was working at that time in
a theater in Houston. After two
years of teaching English, Sharp
decided to leave because the field
seemed too impersonal. He re
ceived his doctorate in drama
from Stanford in 1953, followed

by seven years as head of the
drama department at the Univer
sity of California at Riverside.
Sharp has spoken with Hiken
and Robert Loper about the pos
sibility of working together, and
in 1964—when the proposed rep
ertory company seemed a reality

—he and Hiken came to Stan
ford to fill two departmental
positions.
'Tlie Beaux' Strategem'
'The Beaux' Stratagem" is the
first completely undergraduate
production that Sharp has di
rected at Stanford, and he's thor
oughly enjoyed the energy and
enthusiasm of the cast. "There's
a certain curiosity in the under

grads; they're not completely
committed to acting as a career,
and they're still looking and try
ing to find out what it's all about.
There's real excitement in their
investigation."
Sharp likes Restoration comedy
very much, and he chose to pro
duce "The Beaux' Stratagem"
because it's a play for young
people, full of young ideas;
"everyone doesn't seem thirty
five years old as they do in other
plays of this period." The play is
a series of flirtatious games be
tween sexes —"a continual put-on
and one-upmanship." "These are
the sort of games that Stanford
students are 'with' and can un
derstand." Sharp feels that the
"message" of this play lies in the
question: "How—given human
animal energy—can it be chan
neled into an institution like
marriage?"
Sharp feels that since the ar
rival of the repertory company,
the undergraduate department
has expanded greatly. "Now un
dergrads are treated as a sep
arate entity—instead of having
department productions monop
olized by grad students; interest
and participation have increased,
and everyone is more aware of
undergrad potential."
Nitery Like A Lab
The lack of theater facilities is
a definite problem for both
graduates and undergraduates.
"The Nitery is great as a lab,
but a rough place to produce in,
as there's just no space," and in
Memorial Auditorium, produc
tions can't run concurrently in
the Little Theater and on main
stage. This problem should be
greatly improved when the pro
posed theater is built adjacent
to Mem Aud.
Sharp says he has no "dra
matic philosophy" which can be
taken out of context, but he does
feel that the fundamental objec
tive of people in any field—
drama, music, art, English —
should be to discover who they
are. "The drama program Is not
intended to create actors and di
rectors, but to allow that me
dium to help each individual
find out how they work—to dis
cover why drama is a facto;' in
their life. Then they can go on,
to professional theater, commu
nity theater or just a lasting
appreciation of drama. Educa
tion shouldn't be cocktail party
talk of 'I have read this or seen
that'
Psychological Outlet
"One of the beauties of drama
is that it gives you the oppor
tunity to live your impulses
fully. For example, in a love
scene, because you know the end
ing, you can fully explore the sit
uation. Drama is a psychological
outlet for many people, but it
has an educational value in that
it helps a person out of his own
lonely state of self expression.
"Young actors often feel they
have to be someone else on stage
—they don't take the opportun
ity for personal release. All art
is the same —a poem or a paint
ing or a dramatic scene; the
creater can say 'Here I don't
have to be careful; here I can
be myself.' This creation fills a
basic human need to be com
plete; man can stand back and
—for a brief, fleeting moment—
know 'I have made something.' "

since then, he's directed "The
Critic" (summer of 1965) and
"All's Well That Ends Well"
(with the Stanford Repertory
Company last winter) and has
acted in "The Good Woman of
Setzuan." Sharp has always
worked in academic theater:
"I've never wanted to make my
living as a professional actor,
but I enjoy plays and like to be
in them."
After receiving his B.A. and
M.A. from the University of Chi
cago, he taught English at Rice
Institute—where, incidentally, he
co-directed with Gerald Hiken,
who was working at that time in
a theater in Houston. After two
years of teaching English, Sharp
decided to leave because the field
seemed too impersonal. He re
ceived his doctorate in drama
from Stanford in 1953, followed

by seven years as head of the
drama department at the Univer
sity of California at Riverside.
Sharp has spoken with Hiken
and Robert Loper about the pos
sibility of working together, and
in 1964—when the proposed rep
ertory company seemed a reality

—he and Hiken came to Stan
ford to fill two departmental
positions.
'Tlie Beaux' Strategem'
'The Beaux' Stratagem" is the
first completely undergraduate
production that Sharp has di
rected at Stanford, and he's thor
oughly enjoyed the energy and
enthusiasm of the cast. "There's
a certain curiosity in the under

grads; they're not completely
committed to acting as a career,
and they're still looking and try
ing to find out what it's all about.
There's real excitement in their
investigation."
Sharp likes Restoration comedy
very much, and he chose to pro
duce "The Beaux' Stratagem"
because it's a play for young
people, full of young ideas;
"everyone doesn't seem thirty
five years old as they do in other
plays of this period." The play is
a series of flirtatious games be
tween sexes —"a continual put-on
and one-upmanship." "These are
the sort of games that Stanford
students are 'with' and can un
derstand." Sharp feels that the
"message" of this play lies in the
question: "How—given human
animal energy—can it be chan
neled into an institution like
marriage?"
Sharp feels that since the ar
rival of the repertory company,
the undergraduate department
has expanded greatly. "Now un
dergrads are treated as a sep
arate entity—instead of having
department productions monop
olized by grad students; interest
and participation have increased,
and everyone is more aware of
undergrad potential."
Nitery Like A Lab
The lack of theater facilities is
a definite problem for both
graduates and undergraduates.
"The Nitery is great as a lab,
but a rough place to produce in,
as there's just no space," and in
Memorial Auditorium, produc
tions can't run concurrently in
the Little Theater and on main
stage. This problem should be
greatly improved when the pro
posed theater is built adjacent
to Mem Aud.
Sharp says he has no "dra
matic philosophy" which can be
taken out of context, but he does
feel that the fundamental objec
tive of people in any field—
drama, music, art, English —
should be to discover who they
are. "The drama program Is not
intended to create actors and di
rectors, but to allow that me
dium to help each individual
find out how they work—to dis
cover why drama is a facto;' in
their life. Then they can go on,
to professional theater, commu
nity theater or just a lasting
appreciation of drama. Educa
tion shouldn't be cocktail party
talk of 'I have read this or seen
that'

"One of the beauties of drama
is that it gives you the oppor
tunity to live your impulses
fully. For example, in a love
scene, because you know the end
ing, you can fully explore the sit
uation. Drama is a psychological
outlet for many people, but it
has an educational value in that
it helps a person out of his own
lonely state of self expression.
"Young actors often feel they
have to be someone else on stage
—they don't take the opportun
ity for personal release. All art
is the same —a poem or a paint
ing or a dramatic scene; the
creater can say 'Here I don't
have to be careful; here I can
be myself.' This creation fills a
basic human need to be com
plete; man can stand back and
—for a brief, fleeting moment—
know 'I have made something.' "

After receiving his B.A. and
M.A. from the University of Chi
cago, he taught English at Rice
Institute—where, incidentally, he
co-directed with Gerald Hiken,
who was working at that time in
a theater in Houston. After two
years of teaching English, Sharp
decided to leave because the field
seemed too impersonal. He re
ceived his doctorate in drama
from Stanford in 1953, followed

by seven years as head of the
drama department at the Univer
sity of California at Riverside.
Sharp has spoken with Hiken
and Robert Loper about the pos
sibility of working together, and
in 1964—when the proposed rep
ertory company seemed a reality

—he and Hiken came to Stan
ford to fill two departmental
positions.
'Tlie Beaux' Strategem'
'The Beaux' Stratagem" is the
first completely undergraduate
production that Sharp has di
rected at Stanford, and he's thor
oughly enjoyed the energy and
enthusiasm of the cast. "There's
a certain curiosity in the under

grads; they're not completely
committed to acting as a career,
and they're still looking and try
ing to find out what it's all about.
There's real excitement in their
investigation."
Sharp likes Restoration comedy
very much, and he chose to pro
duce "The Beaux' Stratagem"
because it's a play for young
people, full of young ideas;
"everyone doesn't seem thirty
five years old as they do in other
plays of this period." The play is
a series of flirtatious games be
tween sexes —"a continual put-on
and one-upmanship." "These are
the sort of games that Stanford
students are 'with' and can un
derstand." Sharp feels that the
"message" of this play lies in the
question: "How—given human
animal energy—can it be chan
neled into an institution like
marriage?"
Sharp feels that since the ar
rival of the repertory company,
the undergraduate department
has expanded greatly. "Now un
dergrads are treated as a sep
arate entity—instead of having
department productions monop
olized by grad students; interest
and participation have increased,
and everyone is more aware of
undergrad potential."
Nitery Like A Lab
The lack of theater facilities is
a definite problem for both
graduates and undergraduates.
"The Nitery is great as a lab,
but a rough place to produce in,
as there's just no space," and in
Memorial Auditorium, produc
tions can't run concurrently in
the Little Theater and on main
stage. This problem should be
greatly improved when the pro
posed theater is built adjacent
to Mem Aud.
Sharp says he has no "dra
matic philosophy" which can be
taken out of context, but he does
feel that the fundamental objec
tive of people in any field—
drama, music, art, English —
should be to discover who they
are. "The drama program Is not
intended to create actors and di
rectors, but to allow that me
dium to help each individual
find out how they work—to dis
cover why drama is a facto;' in
their life. Then they can go on,
to professional theater, commu
nity theater or just a lasting
appreciation of drama. Educa
tion shouldn't be cocktail party
talk of 'I have read this or seen
that'
Psychological Outlet
"One of the beauties of drama
is that it gives you the oppor
tunity to live your impulses
fully. For example, in a love
scene, because you know the end
ing, you can fully explore the sit
uation. Drama is a psychological
outlet for many people, but it
has an educational value in that
it helps a person out of his own
lonely state of self expression.
"Young actors often feel they
have to be someone else on stage
—they don't take the opportun
ity for personal release. All art
is the same —a poem or a paint
ing or a dramatic scene; the
creater can say 'Here I don't
have to be careful; here I can
be myself.' This creation fills a
basic human need to be com
plete; man can stand back and
—for a brief, fleeting moment—
know 'I have made something.' "


WILLIAM SHARP
Dr. William Sharp, associate
professor of drama and under
graduate drama advisor, has di
rected the department produc
tion of "The Beaux' Stratagem"
which is being presented in the
Nitery Theater through this
week.
Sharp has been at Stanford
since the summer of 1964, when
he directed "The Duchess of
Malfi" in the Shakespeare Festi
val. He acted that fall in a pro
duction of "The Seagull," and
since then, he's directed "The
Critic" (summer of 1965) and
"All's Well That Ends Well"
(with the Stanford Repertory
Company last winter) and has
acted in "The Good Woman of
Setzuan." Sharp has always
worked in academic theater:
