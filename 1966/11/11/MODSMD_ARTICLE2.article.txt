# SIGMA CHI DISAFFILIATES
## Fraternity Breaks With National Devastation 
### HENRY MULLER News Editor 
Stanford's Alpha Omega chapter of
Sigma Chi has unanimously voted to
disaffiliate from the national organi
zation and become a local fraternity.
This decision is the culmination of
a two-year battle between the national
and the local organization over de
facto segregation. Alpha Omega was
suspended from Sigma Chi in April
1965 following disclosure of its inten
tion to pledge a Negro.
The chapter was reinstated on strict
probation last April, after it became
obvious the Negro student who ac
cepted a bid was no longer eligible for
membership because of academic defi
ciencies.
Alpha Omega's move was an
nounced last night by its president
Brock Gowdy at a meeting of the
chapter's alumni in Los Angeles. "Our
chapter is caught between the de facto
discriminatory membership practices
of the National Fraternity on the one
hand and our own beliefs on the oth
er," he told them.
Established Framework
He emphasized that the Stanford
chapter had tried to solve the problem
within the established framework of
Sigma Chi, but could not do so with
out compromising its principles.
"In our opinion, there is no place
for racial discrimination on the mod
ern college campus," said Gowdy.
"Such discrimination is morally re
pugnant to us."
The Sigma Chi National Fraternity
does not openly require its chapters
to practice segregation. Its constitu
tion, however, states that "every chap
ter owes a duty to every other chap
ter ... to refrain from proposing for
membership to our fellowship any
person who for any reason is likely
to be considered personally unaccept
able as a brother by any chapter or
any member anywhere."
Contemptuousness
When Alpha Omega was suspended
last year, National Sigma Chi Presi
dent Harry V. Wade denied any con
nection between this action and the
fraternity's recent decision to pledge
a Negro student. Instead, he said the
suspension was "for a long history of
contemptuousness for the ritual."
"For the last three or four years,
we have struggled with the pseudo
sophisticated attitude of our young
men at Palo Alto," Wade elaborated.
They "are a little bit too small for the
size of their pants."
Gowdy told The Daily yesterday that
Alpha Omega's move was not solely
based on Sigma Chi's alleged discrimi
natory policy, but that it was the re
sult of disagreement with national
rules on several points.
Five-Man Supervision
For one, he stated that, ever since
the house's reinstatement, the Stan
ford chapter has been placed under
the supervision of a five-man group

headed by a non-Stanford alumnus.
Neither the University nor the alumni
of Alpha Omega were informed of the
existence, membership, or purpose of
this committee.
This committee, according to Gow
dy, has continually interfered with
the operation of the house. It has re
quired, for instance, that the students
in the house not hold any meetings
unless a member of the committee
were present.
The committee ordered that this
member be allowed to cast a vote in
any rush meeting.
In addition, the committee has in
sisted that voting on selection of new
members be done only by secret bal
lot. Since the house requires unani
mous approval of its new members,
this would in effect allow the commit
tee member present to "ding" any
rushee not acceptable to him.
Internal Interference
"We believe that the interference in
the internal affairs and traditional op
erating procedures of Alpha Omega
can be explained only by the commit
tee's concern over the chapter's ex
pressed interest in non-discriminatory
rush," Gowdy said to the alumni last
night.
"Many of the officers of this na
tional fraternity seem to be interested
primarily in the preservation of
forms of an institution which were
and continue to be meaningful to
them, rather than trying to relate
that institution to today's young men,
to our changing times," he said.
Informed of the fraternity's move,
President Sterling said: "The chapter,
of its own accord, has shown unusual
patience and persistence in seeking to
end de facto discriminatory practices.
Pursuant to the Board of Trustees'
1957 resolution on racial discrimina
tion, Alpha Omega will continue to
have the University's support."

Gowdy told The Daily that the senti
ment for disaffiliation has been build
ing up for a long time. The members,
however, first wanted to make sure
that they did not want to continue
affiliation with the national.
He said he though the national had
made a mistake by continually pun
ishing the house in order to develop
loyalty within it. Instead, he pointed
out, it should have shown what was
worthwhile in the national organiza
tion.
Faculty Will Help
Nine deans and faculty members
have expressed willingness to work
with Alpha Omega in developing a set
of goals and programs for the fra
ternity. They include Deans Gordon,
Smith, and Napier, and Professors
Brown, Horn, Rhinelander, Hemmes,
Thompson, and Sanford.
Professor Philip Rhinelander told
The Daily last night that he thought
the Stanford Sigma Chis were "abso
lutely right" in disaffiliating and that
the faculty committee would be mak
ing efforts to help these students con
tinue to contribute to the academic
spirit of the campus.
Earlier this week, a Sigma Chi
alumnus from San Diego held up the
initiation of a pledge of Japanese an
cestry at Oregon State University. The
chapter' 6 president has announced
that he will be pledged anyway.
Sigma Chi is the fourth Stanford
fraternity to go local. The Alpha Tau
Omega chapter quit in 1961, when its
attempt to pledge four Jews was re
sisted by the national. It is now Alpha
Tau Omicron. In 1962, Sigma Nu dis
affiliated because of discriminatory re
strictions and became Beta Chi.
Last year, Alpha Kappa Lambda
became Lambda Nu after it, too, re
jected its national organization.

"Such discrimination is morally re
pugnant to us."
The Sigma Chi National Fraternity
does not openly require its chapters
to practice segregation. Its constitu
tion, however, states that "every chap
ter owes a duty to every other chap
ter ... to refrain from proposing for
membership to our fellowship any
person who for any reason is likely
to be considered personally unaccept
able as a brother by any chapter or
any member anywhere."
Contemptuousness
When Alpha Omega was suspended
last year, National Sigma Chi Presi
dent Harry V. Wade denied any con
nection between this action and the
fraternity's recent decision to pledge
a Negro student. Instead, he said the
suspension was "for a long history of
contemptuousness for the ritual."
"For the last three or four years,
we have struggled with the pseudo
sophisticated attitude of our young
men at Palo Alto," Wade elaborated.
They "are a little bit too small for the
size of their pants."
Gowdy told The Daily yesterday that
Alpha Omega's move was not solely
based on Sigma Chi's alleged discrimi
natory policy, but that it was the re
sult of disagreement with national
rules on several points.
Five-Man Supervision
For one, he stated that, ever since
the house's reinstatement, the Stan
ford chapter has been placed under
the supervision of a five-man group

headed by a non-Stanford alumnus.
Neither the University nor the alumni
of Alpha Omega were informed of the
existence, membership, or purpose of
this committee.
This committee, according to Gow
dy, has continually interfered with
the operation of the house. It has re
quired, for instance, that the students
in the house not hold any meetings
unless a member of the committee
were present.
The committee ordered that this
member be allowed to cast a vote in
any rush meeting.
In addition, the committee has in
sisted that voting on selection of new
members be done only by secret bal
lot. Since the house requires unani
mous approval of its new members,
this would in effect allow the commit
tee member present to "ding" any
rushee not acceptable to him.
Internal Interference
"We believe that the interference in
the internal affairs and traditional op
erating procedures of Alpha Omega
can be explained only by the commit
tee's concern over the chapter's ex
pressed interest in non-discriminatory
rush," Gowdy said to the alumni last
night.
"Many of the officers of this na
tional fraternity seem to be interested
primarily in the preservation of
forms of an institution which were
and continue to be meaningful to
them, rather than trying to relate
that institution to today's young men,
to our changing times," he said.
Informed of the fraternity's move,
President Sterling said: "The chapter,
of its own accord, has shown unusual
patience and persistence in seeking to
end de facto discriminatory practices.
Pursuant to the Board of Trustees'
1957 resolution on racial discrimina
tion, Alpha Omega will continue to
have the University's support."

Gowdy told The Daily that the senti
ment for disaffiliation has been build
ing up for a long time. The members,
however, first wanted to make sure
that they did not want to continue
affiliation with the national.
He said he though the national had
made a mistake by continually pun
ishing the house in order to develop
loyalty within it. Instead, he pointed
out, it should have shown what was
worthwhile in the national organiza
tion.
Faculty Will Help
Nine deans and faculty members
have expressed willingness to work
with Alpha Omega in developing a set
of goals and programs for the fra
ternity. They include Deans Gordon,
Smith, and Napier, and Professors
Brown, Horn, Rhinelander, Hemmes,
Thompson, and Sanford.
Professor Philip Rhinelander told
The Daily last night that he thought
the Stanford Sigma Chis were "abso
lutely right" in disaffiliating and that
the faculty committee would be mak
ing efforts to help these students con
tinue to contribute to the academic
spirit of the campus.
Earlier this week, a Sigma Chi
alumnus from San Diego held up the
initiation of a pledge of Japanese an
cestry at Oregon State University. The
chapter' 6 president has announced
that he will be pledged anyway.
Sigma Chi is the fourth Stanford
fraternity to go local. The Alpha Tau
Omega chapter quit in 1961, when its
attempt to pledge four Jews was re
sisted by the national. It is now Alpha
Tau Omicron. In 1962, Sigma Nu dis
affiliated because of discriminatory re
strictions and became Beta Chi.
Last year, Alpha Kappa Lambda
became Lambda Nu after it, too, re
jected its national organization.

the house's reinstatement, the Stan
ford chapter has been placed under
the supervision of a five-man group

headed by a non-Stanford alumnus.
Neither the University nor the alumni
of Alpha Omega were informed of the
existence, membership, or purpose of
this committee.
This committee, according to Gow
dy, has continually interfered with
the operation of the house. It has re
quired, for instance, that the students
in the house not hold any meetings
unless a member of the committee
were present.
The committee ordered that this
member be allowed to cast a vote in
any rush meeting.
In addition, the committee has in
sisted that voting on selection of new
members be done only by secret bal
lot. Since the house requires unani
mous approval of its new members,
this would in effect allow the commit
tee member present to "ding" any
rushee not acceptable to him.
Internal Interference
"We believe that the interference in
the internal affairs and traditional op
erating procedures of Alpha Omega
can be explained only by the commit
tee's concern over the chapter's ex
pressed interest in non-discriminatory
rush," Gowdy said to the alumni last
night.
"Many of the officers of this na
tional fraternity seem to be interested
primarily in the preservation of
forms of an institution which were
and continue to be meaningful to
them, rather than trying to relate
that institution to today's young men,
to our changing times," he said.
Informed of the fraternity's move,
President Sterling said: "The chapter,
of its own accord, has shown unusual
patience and persistence in seeking to
end de facto discriminatory practices.
Pursuant to the Board of Trustees'
1957 resolution on racial discrimina
tion, Alpha Omega will continue to
have the University's support."

Gowdy told The Daily that the senti
ment for disaffiliation has been build
ing up for a long time. The members,
however, first wanted to make sure
that they did not want to continue
affiliation with the national.
He said he though the national had
made a mistake by continually pun
ishing the house in order to develop
loyalty within it. Instead, he pointed
out, it should have shown what was
worthwhile in the national organiza
tion.
Faculty Will Help
Nine deans and faculty members
have expressed willingness to work
with Alpha Omega in developing a set
of goals and programs for the fra
ternity. They include Deans Gordon,
Smith, and Napier, and Professors
Brown, Horn, Rhinelander, Hemmes,
Thompson, and Sanford.
Professor Philip Rhinelander told
The Daily last night that he thought
the Stanford Sigma Chis were "abso
lutely right" in disaffiliating and that
the faculty committee would be mak
ing efforts to help these students con
tinue to contribute to the academic
spirit of the campus.
Earlier this week, a Sigma Chi
alumnus from San Diego held up the
initiation of a pledge of Japanese an
cestry at Oregon State University. The
chapter' 6 president has announced
that he will be pledged anyway.
Sigma Chi is the fourth Stanford
fraternity to go local. The Alpha Tau
Omega chapter quit in 1961, when its
attempt to pledge four Jews was re
sisted by the national. It is now Alpha
Tau Omicron. In 1962, Sigma Nu dis
affiliated because of discriminatory re
strictions and became Beta Chi.
Last year, Alpha Kappa Lambda
became Lambda Nu after it, too, re
jected its national organization.

Stanford's Alpha Omega chapter of
Sigma Chi has unanimously voted to
disaffiliate from the national organi
zation and become a local fraternity.
This decision is the culmination of
a two-year battle between the national
and the local organization over de
facto segregation. Alpha Omega was
suspended from Sigma Chi in April
1965 following disclosure of its inten
tion to pledge a Negro.
The chapter was reinstated on strict
probation last April, after it became
obvious the Negro student who ac
cepted a bid was no longer eligible for
membership because of academic defi
ciencies.
Alpha Omega's move was an
nounced last night by its president
Brock Gowdy at a meeting of the
chapter's alumni in Los Angeles. "Our
chapter is caught between the de facto
discriminatory membership practices
of the National Fraternity on the one
hand and our own beliefs on the oth
er," he told them.
Established Framework
He emphasized that the Stanford
chapter had tried to solve the problem
within the established framework of
Sigma Chi, but could not do so with
out compromising its principles.
"In our opinion, there is no place
for racial discrimination on the mod
ern college campus," said Gowdy.
"Such discrimination is morally re
pugnant to us."
The Sigma Chi National Fraternity
does not openly require its chapters
to practice segregation. Its constitu
tion, however, states that "every chap
ter owes a duty to every other chap
ter ... to refrain from proposing for
membership to our fellowship any
person who for any reason is likely
to be considered personally unaccept
able as a brother by any chapter or
any member anywhere."
Contemptuousness
When Alpha Omega was suspended
last year, National Sigma Chi Presi
dent Harry V. Wade denied any con
nection between this action and the
fraternity's recent decision to pledge
a Negro student. Instead, he said the
suspension was "for a long history of
contemptuousness for the ritual."
"For the last three or four years,
we have struggled with the pseudo
sophisticated attitude of our young
men at Palo Alto," Wade elaborated.
They "are a little bit too small for the
size of their pants."
Gowdy told The Daily yesterday that
Alpha Omega's move was not solely
based on Sigma Chi's alleged discrimi
natory policy, but that it was the re
sult of disagreement with national
rules on several points.
Five-Man Supervision
For one, he stated that, ever since
the house's reinstatement, the Stan
