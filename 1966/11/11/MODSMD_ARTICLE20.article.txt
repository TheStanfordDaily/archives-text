# SECOND UPSET FOR UCLA?
## Cards Lurch Into Bruins' Den 
### 
Mysterious Stanford bangs
helmets against human-after-all
UCLA tomorrow afternoon In
the Los Angeles Coliseum. The
Indians have a lukewarm 4-4
record for the season, but the
last three games have shown a
steady progress toward the pre
cision they will need to stop
UCLA.
Last week, the Bruins found
the showers in Seattle before
they left the mucky field—and
for the first time in 1966 the
UCLA lockerroom did not host
a victory celebration.
The Huskies were humiliated
by the statisticians, but they did
not seem to care as long as the
scoreboard put UCLA on the
muddy end of a 16-3 stick.
UCLA outgained Washington
180-109 on the ground, outpassed
the Huskies 87-82, and pushed
for 16 first downs to Washing
ton's 10. The numbers racket
paid no dividends however.
UCLA could not put together a
consistent drive.
Slippery Fingers
Bruin receivers dropped five
perfect Beban passes in the
first half alone, and All-Ameri
can candidate Mel Farr could

not get out of the mire, gaining
only 32 yards.
The Washington team that
bowled over the third-ranked
Bruins by 13 points needed a last
ditch field goal to scavenge a 2
point victory over Stanford the
week before.
Comparative scores are always
risky, sometimes ludicrous, but

it would appear that Tommy
Prothro's Uclans are in for a
struggle against the Indians. The
Bruins rate as 2 touchdown fav
orites. They were two TD fav
orites over Washington, too.
Bruins 'Down'
What will be the effects on
UCLA's morale after blowing
their third ranking? Will they
be discouraged and let their

standings slide further? Dubi
ous.
Will they be out to tear Stan
ford apart at the seams in a
bitterly furious paroxysm of
spite against the world? That's
hard to say; they are smarter
than that.
Conjecture will probably lead
to nowhexe via a circuitous
route. The stern reality is that
even a "down" UCLA team
would be tough to topple. A
keyed-up Bruin pack would be
even harder to beat, but the deed
can evidently be done.
Dave Lewis showed a skepti
cal Stanford audience at the Air
Force game that his haloed per
formance in Big Game, 1964, was
no fluke. A shoulder injury that
plagued him in the early season
has healed—that shoulder is now
throwing 60 yard touchdown
passes.
Lewis Back To QB
Lewis will come home to his
quarterback position Saturday.
Chuck Williams will sit on the
sidelines with an elbow injury,
and a sore shoulder will cut
down Gene Washington's pass
ing.
Blaine Nye will return to the
defensive lineup, setting up a
246 „ pound roadblock at left
guard.
The Indian defense will be
hard-pressed to contain Beban
and Company. Troy Winslow
used the roll out to gain hours of
free time to pick out USC re
ceivers against Stanford earlier
this season. The Cards cannot
afford to give Beban that much
time, or Beban bombs will be
floating gently into Bruin paws
all afternoon.
Beban adequately demonstrat
ed in the Rose Bowl his willing
ness to pounce upon any slip up
of his > opponent and convert it
into scoreboard decoration. If
Stanford can limit their slip-ups
to an over-estimation of the
enemy, UCLA might very well
swallow its second bitter pill in
a row.
