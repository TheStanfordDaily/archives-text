This Ls the Lewis-to-Conrad pass play that broke the Air Force game
wide open. Washington pivots and laterals to halfback Dave Lewis,
who is moving to his left. Fullback Jack Root moves outside the
tight end to block. Bob Blunt, the flanker, moves straight downfleld
and split end Bob Conrad runs a "post" pattern. Washington circles
right and heads straight downfleld, where two linebackers cover
him. Conrad eludes the defensive halfback and the safety to grab
Lewis' 60 yard pass and dash In for the score.
