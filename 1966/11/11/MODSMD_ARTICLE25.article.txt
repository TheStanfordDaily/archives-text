## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER Sports Editor 
Stanford's varsity water polo
ists face Foothill College at 3:30
today in the Indians' final home
game of the 1966 season. Satur
day, the Cards fly south to play
against traditionally belligerent
Long Beach State.
The Stanford frosh, 7-4 after
a split last weekend, meet the
foothill JV's after the varsity
game today and hoet powerful
Await High School tomorrow at
11:00.
Foothill College has always
been a thorn in the Indians' feet.
Stanford beat the Owls, 7-6, in
the Nor Cal Open Tournament
last year to gain a 2-1 record
against Foothill and undisputed
hold of the nation's second rank
ing.
Owls Weak In Spots
Foothill has lost the core of
last year's team to Cal, Stan
ford, and San Jose State. Foot
hill transfer John Parker cur
rently ranks second behind Gary
Sheerer among Stanford scorers
with 27 goals and 12 assists.

Sheerer has 30 scores and 22
assists.
The Tribe easily clipped the
Owl's wings earlier this season,
114, in Foothill's spacious pool.
Stanford captain and goalie
Mike Sorem and seniors Bill
Derrig and Doug Jensen will
play their last games in the En
cina pool today. Sorem has
made 111 saves in front of the
Stanford cage, 34 in Stanford's
two games with USC.
Lively LBS Rivalry
Long Beach State has a ri
valry punctuated with one-goal
decisions. Stanford beat Long
Beach, 9-8 in double overtime in
1963 to cinch the national cham
pionship. Last year, Bill Meyer
scored two overtime goals to
give the Cards the smile after
a 7-6 squeaker.
Long Beach does not have a
powerhouse squad this year, but
should push the Indians hard,
especially in the Long Beach
tank.
Frosh Look Strong
Prime teamwork efforts last

weekend almost brought the
Papoose poloists revenge for a
San Jose frosh 9-23 shellacking
at the beginning of the season.
However, the Papooses could
not hold a 10-8 lead after four
starters fouled out, and San Jose
won, 14-11.
Wayne Wilson, Tom Hill, Bob
Abshear, Dennis Daly, and
goalie Sam Beasley put in the
top performances they will have
to duplicate to beat Await. Foot
hill should be tough, but not
tough enough.

hill transfer John Parker cur
rently ranks second behind Gary
Sheerer among Stanford scorers
with 27 goals and 12 assists.

Sheerer has 30 scores and 22

The Tribe easily clipped the
Owl's wings earlier this season,
114, in Foothill's spacious pool.
Stanford captain and goalie
Mike Sorem and seniors Bill
Derrig and Doug Jensen will
play their last games in the En
cina pool today. Sorem has
made 111 saves in front of the
Stanford cage, 34 in Stanford's
two games with USC.
Lively LBS Rivalry
Long Beach State has a ri
valry punctuated with one-goal
decisions. Stanford beat Long
Beach, 9-8 in double overtime in
1963 to cinch the national cham
pionship. Last year, Bill Meyer
scored two overtime goals to
give the Cards the smile after
a 7-6 squeaker.
Long Beach does not have a
powerhouse squad this year, but
should push the Indians hard,
especially in the Long Beach
tank.
Frosh Look Strong
Prime teamwork efforts last

weekend almost brought the
Papoose poloists revenge for a
San Jose frosh 9-23 shellacking
at the beginning of the season.
However, the Papooses could
not hold a 10-8 lead after four
starters fouled out, and San Jose
won, 14-11.
Wayne Wilson, Tom Hill, Bob
Abshear, Dennis Daly, and
goalie Sam Beasley put in the
top performances they will have
to duplicate to beat Await. Foot
hill should be tough, but not
tough enough.
Stanford's varsity water polo
ists face Foothill College at 3:30
today in the Indians' final home
game of the 1966 season. Satur
day, the Cards fly south to play
against traditionally belligerent
Long Beach State.
The Stanford frosh, 7-4 after
a split last weekend, meet the
foothill JV's after the varsity
game today and hoet powerful
Await High School tomorrow at
11:00.
Foothill College has always
been a thorn in the Indians' feet.
Stanford beat the Owls, 7-6, in
the Nor Cal Open Tournament
last year to gain a 2-1 record
against Foothill and undisputed
hold of the nation's second rank
ing.
