# SIGMA CHI

The Alpha Omega Chapter's break with
Sigma Chi over defacto discrimination reflects
a two year struggle to remain within the na
tional organization without compromising the
values of the house. But the reasons for dis
affiliation go beyond the national's refusal to
allow autonomous pledging practices and point
up a sharp conflict in philosophies.
At the 1965 national convention, held in the
wake of the chapter's suspension for pledging
a Negro, the members of Alpha Omr>ga wrote
the other delegates, "We are in no way trying
to impose our values upon the fraternity." How
ever the chapter objected to the fraternity's
imposition of the social acceptability clause in
the national constitution which stipulates that a
pledge must be acceptable to any member of
the fraternity at any chapter anywhere in the
country. The members of Alpha Omega main
tained their right to conform to the values and
regulation of the educational institution of
which they were a part, specifically the Board
of Trustees 1957 statement banning discrimina
tory practices. The convention upheld the sus
pension by a three-to-one vote, thereby deny

ing that a local chapter has the right to deter
mine the qualifications of its own membership.
Still refusing to discuss the question of local
autonomy, the national office rescinded the
suspension last April in favor of a strict proba
tion administered by an alumni committee ap
pointed by the national office to oversee all
house business.
Under the mistaken impression that the
benefits of fraternal living can be externally
imposed without regard to the moral and fra
ternal bond among the members of the chapter,
the committee blindly promoted the values and
practices of the national office, and the effect
was to perpetuate the pledge and ritual prac
tices which Alpha Omega chapter could not
accept.
We believe that the chapter, faced with a
choice between its loyalty to an institution
whose values it could not embrace and its
commitment to automomous, non-discriminatory
membership policy and to a ritual which does
not impose "a pre-conceived set of ideals," has
made a wise and courageous choice in disaffiliat
ing with the national office of Sigma Chi.
