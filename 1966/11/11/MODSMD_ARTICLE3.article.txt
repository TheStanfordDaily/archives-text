# Florence Report: Water, Bread Lines, And Candles
## 
### 
(Editor's Note: This "report" con
sists of exerpts from personal letters
received on campus yesterday from
three sophomores studying at Villa
San Paolo, Stanford's Italian Cam
pus. The letters were released to The
Daily.)
Downtown it was unbelievable.
Standing and watching ... I had to
move back a couple of feet every 2 or
3 minutes in order to keep out of the
water which was very dirty and in
some places covered with black oil
used in heating homes.
You could always tell where the
edge of the water was because you
would suddenly run into a group of
people standing around watching and
talking. Watching was about all we

could do. Little rubber rafts were
going and rescuing people who were
stranded in their houses.
One man on the street was holding
a wooden door sideways pushed hard
against his doorway with cloth
around the edges, to keep the water
from going in . . . Great big Army
tanks were roaring around the city
. . . One man was building a brick
wall in his doorway.
There was a service going on at the
improvised chapel—the main church
was flooded. Nuns were praying . . .
they had made a chapel since theirs
was ruined by pews crashing against
the altar and the Crucifix and the
Hosts were in danger. The nuns of the
city were the ones I first noticed yes
terday in any organization.
These people need strength as much
as they need water and bread and
warmth. In two or three days almost
everyone in Florence will collapse
from fatigue and sudden discourage
ment if they are not remarkably
strong . . . they need moral strength.
In this case it helps to be a foreigner
because help has more face in the
impression it gives people ... it gives
them a stronger impression of the hu

manity and real cooperation.
—Mary Todd
It seems like wartime with army
trucks racing through the cities flash
ing their blue lights. The bread lines
stretch for blocks and every time a
water truck drives through all the
people grab their fiascos and rush for
it.
Villa San Paolo has the only well
in the neighborhood and everyone
knows it. Yesterday they finally had
to lock the gates. We seem very very
well protected; it's sort of like a for
tress on a hill. Most of our water is
questionable for drinking but we do
anyway — an amazing quantity is
used making soup and cooking pasta.
The real clutch is there'll be no
showers for another twenty-one days
or until it's certain we have enough
water. This is already causing some
concern. —Carol Abbott
Thursday night some of us went to
the Palazzo Vecchio for a free concert
by a chamber orchestra. Afterwards
as we rode by the river at about 12:30
a.m. We say ropes and a towtruck
being used to pull something from
the Arno. It was raininc hpavilv. At
9 a.m. the next morning the
Piazza della Signorina was flood
ed by three feet of oily water.
By four p.m. Friday, it had
risen to fifteen feet, there and in
other low places in the center of
town. Sometime during the
night a large section (20 feet)
of retaining wall along the Arno
had been washed away and the
river found an escape into the
historic center of Florence.
From early Friday until early
Saturday, the water rushed
through that break and over the
other walls of the river into
Florence. Kids from the Villa
who were going into town Fri
day were stranded there—often
having to wade through waist
deep water to get to a dry street
and then back.
Around noon it became clear
to people in town that the situa
tion was desperate. People drove
their cars into the Centro, where
friends or family had been left,
and had to leave the cars in
many feet of water, abandoned
to soak in oil and be battered by
debris.
I didn't realize the extent of
damage and the seriousness of
the situation in Florence and all
of Italy until Saturday after
noon when fellows here came
back from the Centro to tell of
the devastation. The Uffizi base
ment, where extensive restora
tion was going on, and where
microfilms of the art in Italy

was kept, had been completely
flooded.
The water had flooded the
floor of the Duomo. Five of the
ten bronze panels on Ghiberti's
"Gates of Paradise" had fallen
off. Several other major church
es (Santa Maria Novella, Santa
Croce, San Lorenzo) had been
flooded, plus two floors of the
Pitti Palace. Yet this was just
(just!) the damage done to the
historic and art treasures of
Florence.
Individual stores, homes, and
apartments were completely
wiped out. The newscast on TV
Saturday night was still lacking,
but moving pics of the water
levels, of the center of town,
of cars and trucks floating down
streets gave a good idea of the
damage.
The flooding apparently took
the city by surprise. Municipal

action was completely lacking;
mobilization of individuals im
possible. Yesterday most people
downtown stood near shops or
homes which were no more, oft
en hip-deep in the water, and
blankly tried to understand what
had happened. Even today, by
which time the water on this
side of the river had receded
people were aimlessly walking
around, psychologically numbed.
At dinner last night, the as
sistant to the directors an
nounced that some help was
needed at the Biblioteca Nazio
nale to transport books from the
flooded basement to upper floors.
Today about 15 of us at various
times went there to help. My
roommate and I got there
around 2:30, having taken a bus
only as far as San Marco, then
walking (they weren't running
any farther) by way of the Pon

te Verchio to the Biblioteca.
The Ponte Vecchio, although
still standing, is divested of its
shops. Most of them have their
back wall ripped out. All are
completely destroyed. Yesterday
and today soldiers have been
stationed there to prevent in
dividuals from picking up the
gold and silver buried in the
mud on the bridge. It is a pitiful
sight.
Fortunately we have electrici
ty, though no water to wash
with. Drinking water is ample,
from the well, and there is a
good stock of food. We are hard
ly inconvenienced. I am glad to
be able to write that all classes
are cancelled tomorrow morning
and most of us will be dis
patched to three or four very
needy areas, such as the Biblio
teca, to help out as we can. We
all want to do it.

I feel a real sense of involve
ment, but more, a terrible sense
of loss, sort of personal, and an
incapacity just to plod on doing
ordinary things when so much
else has to be done. If we do
nothing but work in town all
week it is fine with me.
—Bob Fries
The fund drive "for the art
and people of Florence" will
conclude today. A table will be
set up in front of the Post
Office until 4 p.m. Tomorrow
the funds will be wired to Dr.
Mammarella, Director of Stan
ford-in-Italy. Over $200 has
been collected in the past two
days.
Italian officials yesterday
estimated damage to art works
in Florence alone at $160 mil
lion. More than $3 million is
needed for emergency repairs
to save damaged paintings.

people grab their fiascos and rush for
it.
Villa San Paolo has the only well
in the neighborhood and everyone
knows it. Yesterday they finally had
to lock the gates. We seem very very
well protected; it's sort of like a for
tress on a hill. Most of our water is
questionable for drinking but we do
anyway — an amazing quantity is
used making soup and cooking pasta.
The real clutch is there'll be no
showers for another twenty-one days
or until it's certain we have enough
water. This is already causing some
concern. —Carol Abbott
Thursday night some of us went to
the Palazzo Vecchio for a free concert
by a chamber orchestra. Afterwards
as we rode by the river at about 12:30
a.m. We say ropes and a towtruck
being used to pull something from
the Arno. It was raininc hpavilv. At
9 a.m. the next morning the
Piazza della Signorina was flood
ed by three feet of oily water.
By four p.m. Friday, it had
risen to fifteen feet, there and in
other low places in the center of
town. Sometime during the
night a large section (20 feet)
of retaining wall along the Arno
had been washed away and the
river found an escape into the
historic center of Florence.
From early Friday until early
Saturday, the water rushed
through that break and over the
other walls of the river into
Florence. Kids from the Villa
who were going into town Fri
day were stranded there—often
having to wade through waist
deep water to get to a dry street
and then back.
Around noon it became clear
to people in town that the situa
tion was desperate. People drove
their cars into the Centro, where
friends or family had been left,
and had to leave the cars in
many feet of water, abandoned
to soak in oil and be battered by
debris.
I didn't realize the extent of
damage and the seriousness of
the situation in Florence and all
of Italy until Saturday after
noon when fellows here came
back from the Centro to tell of
the devastation. The Uffizi base
ment, where extensive restora
tion was going on, and where
microfilms of the art in Italy

was kept, had been completely
flooded.
The water had flooded the
floor of the Duomo. Five of the
ten bronze panels on Ghiberti's
"Gates of Paradise" had fallen
off. Several other major church
es (Santa Maria Novella, Santa
Croce, San Lorenzo) had been
flooded, plus two floors of the
Pitti Palace. Yet this was just
(just!) the damage done to the
historic and art treasures of
Florence.
Individual stores, homes, and
apartments were completely
wiped out. The newscast on TV
Saturday night was still lacking,
but moving pics of the water
levels, of the center of town,
of cars and trucks floating down
streets gave a good idea of the
damage.
The flooding apparently took
the city by surprise. Municipal

action was completely lacking;
mobilization of individuals im
possible. Yesterday most people
downtown stood near shops or
homes which were no more, oft
en hip-deep in the water, and
blankly tried to understand what
had happened. Even today, by
which time the water on this
side of the river had receded
people were aimlessly walking
around, psychologically numbed.
At dinner last night, the as
sistant to the directors an
nounced that some help was
needed at the Biblioteca Nazio
nale to transport books from the
flooded basement to upper floors.
Today about 15 of us at various
times went there to help. My
roommate and I got there
around 2:30, having taken a bus
only as far as San Marco, then
walking (they weren't running
any farther) by way of the Pon

te Verchio to the Biblioteca.
The Ponte Vecchio, although
still standing, is divested of its
shops. Most of them have their
back wall ripped out. All are
completely destroyed. Yesterday
and today soldiers have been
stationed there to prevent in
dividuals from picking up the
gold and silver buried in the
mud on the bridge. It is a pitiful
sight.
Fortunately we have electrici
ty, though no water to wash
with. Drinking water is ample,
from the well, and there is a
good stock of food. We are hard
ly inconvenienced. I am glad to
be able to write that all classes
are cancelled tomorrow morning
and most of us will be dis
patched to three or four very
needy areas, such as the Biblio
teca, to help out as we can. We
all want to do it.

I feel a real sense of involve
ment, but more, a terrible sense
of loss, sort of personal, and an
incapacity just to plod on doing
ordinary things when so much
else has to be done. If we do
nothing but work in town all
week it is fine with me.

The fund drive "for the art
and people of Florence" will
conclude today. A table will be
set up in front of the Post
Office until 4 p.m. Tomorrow
the funds will be wired to Dr.
Mammarella, Director of Stan
ford-in-Italy. Over $200 has
been collected in the past two
days.
Italian officials yesterday
estimated damage to art works
in Florence alone at $160 mil
lion. More than $3 million is
needed for emergency repairs
to save damaged paintings.

sists of exerpts from personal letters
received on campus yesterday from
three sophomores studying at Villa
San Paolo, Stanford's Italian Cam

Downtown it was unbelievable.
Standing and watching ... I had to
move back a couple of feet every 2 or
3 minutes in order to keep out of the
water which was very dirty and in
some places covered with black oil
used in heating homes.
You could always tell where the
edge of the water was because you
would suddenly run into a group of
people standing around watching and
talking. Watching was about all we

could do. Little rubber rafts were
going and rescuing people who were
stranded in their houses.
One man on the street was holding
a wooden door sideways pushed hard
against his doorway with cloth
around the edges, to keep the water
from going in . . . Great big Army
tanks were roaring around the city
. . . One man was building a brick
wall in his doorway.
There was a service going on at the
improvised chapel—the main church
was flooded. Nuns were praying . . .
they had made a chapel since theirs
was ruined by pews crashing against
the altar and the Crucifix and the
Hosts were in danger. The nuns of the
city were the ones I first noticed yes
terday in any organization.
These people need strength as much
as they need water and bread and
warmth. In two or three days almost
everyone in Florence will collapse
from fatigue and sudden discourage
ment if they are not remarkably
strong . . . they need moral strength.
In this case it helps to be a foreigner
because help has more face in the
impression it gives people ... it gives
them a stronger impression of the hu

manity and real cooperation.

was flooded. Nuns were praying . . .
they had made a chapel since theirs
was ruined by pews crashing against
the altar and the Crucifix and the
Hosts were in danger. The nuns of the
city were the ones I first noticed yes
terday in any organization.
These people need strength as much
as they need water and bread and
warmth. In two or three days almost
everyone in Florence will collapse
from fatigue and sudden discourage
ment if they are not remarkably
strong . . . they need moral strength.
In this case it helps to be a foreigner
because help has more face in the
impression it gives people ... it gives
them a stronger impression of the hu

manity and real cooperation.

It seems like wartime with army
trucks racing through the cities flash
ing their blue lights. The bread lines
stretch for blocks and every time a
water truck drives through all the
people grab their fiascos and rush for
it.
Villa San Paolo has the only well
in the neighborhood and everyone
knows it. Yesterday they finally had
to lock the gates. We seem very very
well protected; it's sort of like a for
tress on a hill. Most of our water is
questionable for drinking but we do
anyway — an amazing quantity is
used making soup and cooking pasta.
The real clutch is there'll be no
showers for another twenty-one days
or until it's certain we have enough
water. This is already causing some
concern. —Carol Abbott
Thursday night some of us went to
the Palazzo Vecchio for a free concert
by a chamber orchestra. Afterwards
as we rode by the river at about 12:30
a.m. We say ropes and a towtruck
being used to pull something from
the Arno. It was raininc hpavilv. At
9 a.m. the next morning the
Piazza della Signorina was flood
ed by three feet of oily water.
By four p.m. Friday, it had
risen to fifteen feet, there and in
other low places in the center of
town. Sometime during the
night a large section (20 feet)
of retaining wall along the Arno
had been washed away and the
river found an escape into the
historic center of Florence.
From early Friday until early
Saturday, the water rushed
through that break and over the
other walls of the river into
Florence. Kids from the Villa
who were going into town Fri
day were stranded there—often
having to wade through waist
deep water to get to a dry street
and then back.
Around noon it became clear
to people in town that the situa
tion was desperate. People drove
their cars into the Centro, where
friends or family had been left,
and had to leave the cars in
many feet of water, abandoned
to soak in oil and be battered by
debris.
I didn't realize the extent of
damage and the seriousness of
the situation in Florence and all
of Italy until Saturday after
noon when fellows here came
back from the Centro to tell of
the devastation. The Uffizi base
ment, where extensive restora
tion was going on, and where
microfilms of the art in Italy

was kept, had been completely
flooded.
The water had flooded the
floor of the Duomo. Five of the
ten bronze panels on Ghiberti's
"Gates of Paradise" had fallen
off. Several other major church
es (Santa Maria Novella, Santa
Croce, San Lorenzo) had been
flooded, plus two floors of the
Pitti Palace. Yet this was just
(just!) the damage done to the
historic and art treasures of
Florence.
Individual stores, homes, and
apartments were completely
wiped out. The newscast on TV
Saturday night was still lacking,
but moving pics of the water
levels, of the center of town,
of cars and trucks floating down
streets gave a good idea of the
damage.
The flooding apparently took
the city by surprise. Municipal

action was completely lacking;
mobilization of individuals im
possible. Yesterday most people
downtown stood near shops or
homes which were no more, oft
en hip-deep in the water, and
blankly tried to understand what
had happened. Even today, by
which time the water on this
side of the river had receded
people were aimlessly walking
around, psychologically numbed.
At dinner last night, the as
sistant to the directors an
nounced that some help was
needed at the Biblioteca Nazio
nale to transport books from the
flooded basement to upper floors.
Today about 15 of us at various
times went there to help. My
roommate and I got there
around 2:30, having taken a bus
only as far as San Marco, then
walking (they weren't running
any farther) by way of the Pon

te Verchio to the Biblioteca.
The Ponte Vecchio, although
still standing, is divested of its
shops. Most of them have their
back wall ripped out. All are
completely destroyed. Yesterday
and today soldiers have been
stationed there to prevent in
dividuals from picking up the
gold and silver buried in the
mud on the bridge. It is a pitiful
sight.
Fortunately we have electrici
ty, though no water to wash
with. Drinking water is ample,
from the well, and there is a
good stock of food. We are hard
ly inconvenienced. I am glad to
be able to write that all classes
are cancelled tomorrow morning
and most of us will be dis
patched to three or four very
needy areas, such as the Biblio
teca, to help out as we can. We
all want to do it.

I feel a real sense of involve
ment, but more, a terrible sense
of loss, sort of personal, and an
incapacity just to plod on doing
ordinary things when so much
else has to be done. If we do
nothing but work in town all
week it is fine with me.

The fund drive "for the art

conclude today. A table will be
set up in front of the Post
Office until 4 p.m. Tomorrow
the funds will be wired to Dr.
Mammarella, Director of Stan
ford-in-Italy. Over $200 has
been collected in the past two

Italian officials yesterday
estimated damage to art works
in Florence alone at $160 mil

Downtown it was unbelievable.
Standing and watching ... I had to
move back a couple of feet every 2 or
3 minutes in order to keep out of the
water which was very dirty and in
some places covered with black oil
used in heating homes.
You could always tell where the
edge of the water was because you
would suddenly run into a group of
people standing around watching and
talking. Watching was about all we

could do. Little rubber rafts were
going and rescuing people who were
stranded in their houses.
One man on the street was holding
a wooden door sideways pushed hard
against his doorway with cloth
around the edges, to keep the water
from going in . . . Great big Army
tanks were roaring around the city
. . . One man was building a brick
wall in his doorway.
There was a service going on at the
improvised chapel—the main church
was flooded. Nuns were praying . . .
they had made a chapel since theirs
was ruined by pews crashing against

back wall ripped out. All are
completely destroyed. Yesterday
and today soldiers have been
stationed there to prevent in
dividuals from picking up the
gold and silver buried in the
mud on the bridge. It is a pitiful
sight.
Fortunately we have electrici
ty, though no water to wash
with. Drinking water is ample,
from the well, and there is a
good stock of food. We are hard
ly inconvenienced. I am glad to
be able to write that all classes
are cancelled tomorrow morning
and most of us will be dis
patched to three or four very
needy areas, such as the Biblio
teca, to help out as we can. We
all want to do it.

I feel a real sense of involve
ment, but more, a terrible sense
of loss, sort of personal, and an
incapacity just to plod on doing
ordinary things when so much
else has to be done. If we do
nothing but work in town all
week it is fine with me.

The fund drive "for the art
and people of Florence" will
conclude today. A table will be
set up in front of the Post
Office until 4 p.m. Tomorrow
the funds will be wired to Dr.
Mammarella, Director of Stan
ford-in-Italy. Over $200 has
been collected in the past two
days.
Italian officials yesterday
estimated damage to art works
in Florence alone at $160 mil
lion. More than $3 million is
needed for emergency repairs
to save damaged paintings.

Downtown it was unbelievable.
Standing and watching ... I had to
move back a couple of feet every 2 or
3 minutes in order to keep out of the
water which was very dirty and in
some places covered with black oil
used in heating homes.
You could always tell where the
edge of the water was because you
would suddenly run into a group of
people standing around watching and
talking. Watching was about all we

could do. Little rubber rafts were
going and rescuing people who were
stranded in their houses.
One man on the street was holding
a wooden door sideways pushed hard
against his doorway with cloth
around the edges, to keep the water
from going in . . . Great big Army
tanks were roaring around the city
. . . One man was building a brick
wall in his doorway.
There was a service going on at the
improvised chapel—the main church
was flooded. Nuns were praying . . .
they had made a chapel since theirs
was ruined by pews crashing against
the altar and the Crucifix and the
Hosts were in danger. The nuns of the
city were the ones I first noticed yes
terday in any organization.
These people need strength as much
as they need water and bread and
warmth. In two or three days almost
everyone in Florence will collapse
from fatigue and sudden discourage
ment if they are not remarkably
strong . . . they need moral strength.
In this case it helps to be a foreigner
because help has more face in the
impression it gives people ... it gives
them a stronger impression of the hu

manity and real cooperation.

It seems like wartime with army
trucks racing through the cities flash
ing their blue lights. The bread lines
stretch for blocks and every time a
water truck drives through all the
people grab their fiascos and rush for
it.
Villa San Paolo has the only well
in the neighborhood and everyone
knows it. Yesterday they finally had
to lock the gates. We seem very very
well protected; it's sort of like a for
tress on a hill. Most of our water is
questionable for drinking but we do
anyway — an amazing quantity is
used making soup and cooking pasta.
The real clutch is there'll be no
showers for another twenty-one days
or until it's certain we have enough
water. This is already causing some
concern. —Carol Abbott
Thursday night some of us went to
the Palazzo Vecchio for a free concert
by a chamber orchestra. Afterwards
as we rode by the river at about 12:30
a.m. We say ropes and a towtruck
being used to pull something from
the Arno. It was raininc hpavilv. At
9 a.m. the next morning the
Piazza della Signorina was flood
ed by three feet of oily water.
By four p.m. Friday, it had
risen to fifteen feet, there and in
other low places in the center of
town. Sometime during the
night a large section (20 feet)
of retaining wall along the Arno
had been washed away and the
river found an escape into the
historic center of Florence.
From early Friday until early
Saturday, the water rushed
through that break and over the
other walls of the river into
Florence. Kids from the Villa
who were going into town Fri
day were stranded there—often
having to wade through waist
deep water to get to a dry street
and then back.
Around noon it became clear
to people in town that the situa
tion was desperate. People drove
their cars into the Centro, where
friends or family had been left,
and had to leave the cars in
many feet of water, abandoned
to soak in oil and be battered by
debris.
I didn't realize the extent of
damage and the seriousness of
the situation in Florence and all
of Italy until Saturday after
noon when fellows here came
back from the Centro to tell of
the devastation. The Uffizi base
ment, where extensive restora
tion was going on, and where
microfilms of the art in Italy

was kept, had been completely
flooded.
The water had flooded the
floor of the Duomo. Five of the
ten bronze panels on Ghiberti's
"Gates of Paradise" had fallen
off. Several other major church
es (Santa Maria Novella, Santa
Croce, San Lorenzo) had been
flooded, plus two floors of the
Pitti Palace. Yet this was just
(just!) the damage done to the
historic and art treasures of
Florence.
Individual stores, homes, and
apartments were completely
wiped out. The newscast on TV
Saturday night was still lacking,
but moving pics of the water
levels, of the center of town,
of cars and trucks floating down
streets gave a good idea of the
damage.
The flooding apparently took
the city by surprise. Municipal

action was completely lacking;
mobilization of individuals im
possible. Yesterday most people
downtown stood near shops or
homes which were no more, oft
en hip-deep in the water, and
blankly tried to understand what
had happened. Even today, by
which time the water on this
side of the river had receded
people were aimlessly walking
around, psychologically numbed.
At dinner last night, the as
sistant to the directors an
nounced that some help was
needed at the Biblioteca Nazio
nale to transport books from the
flooded basement to upper floors.
Today about 15 of us at various
times went there to help. My
roommate and I got there
around 2:30, having taken a bus
only as far as San Marco, then
walking (they weren't running
any farther) by way of the Pon

te Verchio to the Biblioteca.
The Ponte Vecchio, although
still standing, is divested of its
shops. Most of them have their
back wall ripped out. All are
completely destroyed. Yesterday
and today soldiers have been
stationed there to prevent in
dividuals from picking up the
gold and silver buried in the
mud on the bridge. It is a pitiful
