# Florence Report: Water, Bread Lines, And Candles

(Editor's Note: This "report" con
sists of exerpts from personal letters
received on campus yesterday from
three sophomores studying at Villa
San Paolo, Stanford's Italian Cam
pus. The letters were released to The
Daily.)
Downtown it was unbelievable.
Standing and watching ... I had to
move back a couple of feet every 2 or
3 minutes in order to keep out of the
water which was very dirty and in
some places covered with black oil
used in heating homes.
You could always tell where the
edge of the water was because you
would suddenly run into a group of
people standing around watching and
talking. Watching was about all we

could do. Little rubber rafts were
going and rescuing people who were
stranded in their houses.
One man on the street was holding
a wooden door sideways pushed hard
against his doorway with cloth
around the edges, to keep the water
from going in . . . Great big Army
tanks were roaring around the city
. . . One man was building a brick
wall in his doorway.
There was a service going on at the
improvised chapel—the main church
was flooded. Nuns were praying . . .
they had made a chapel since theirs
was ruined by pews crashing against
the altar and the Crucifix and the
Hosts were in danger. The nuns of the
city were the ones I first noticed yes
terday in any organization.
These people need strength as much
as they need water and bread and
warmth. In two or three days almost
everyone in Florence will collapse
from fatigue and sudden discourage
ment if they are not remarkably
strong . . . they need moral strength.
In this case it helps to be a foreigner
because help has more face in the
impression it gives people ... it gives
them a stronger impression of the hu

manity and real cooperation.
—Mary Todd
It seems like wartime with army
trucks racing through the cities flash
ing their blue lights. The bread lines
stretch for blocks and every time a
water truck drives through all the
people grab their fiascos and rush for
it.
Villa San Paolo has the only well
in the neighborhood and everyone
knows it. Yesterday they finally had
to lock the gates. We seem very very
well protected; it's sort of like a for
tress on a hill. Most of our water is
questionable for drinking but we do
anyway — an amazing quantity is
used making soup and cooking pasta.
The real clutch is there'll be no
showers for another twenty-one days
or until it's certain we have enough
water. This is already causing some
concern. —Carol Abbott
Thursday night some of us went to
the Palazzo Vecchio for a free concert
by a chamber orchestra. Afterwards
as we rode by the river at about 12:30
a.m. We say ropes and a towtruck
being used to pull something from
the Arno. It was raininc hpavilv. At
