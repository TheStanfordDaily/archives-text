## Mannheim And The University: Bureaucratic Mind Boggles 
### Tim Haight 
"The administrative, legalistic
mind has its own peculiar type
of rationality. When faced with
the play of hitherto unharnessed
forces, as, for example, the erup
tion of collective energies in a
revolution, it can conceive of
them only as momentary dis
turbances.
"It is, therefore, no wonder that
in every revolution the bureau
cracy tries to find a remedy by
means of arbitrary decrees rath
er than to meet the political sit
uation on its own grounds.
"It regards revolution as an
untoward event within an other
wise ordered system and not as
the living expression of funda
mental social forces on which
the existence, the preservation,
and the development of society
depends." â€” Karl Mannheim,
Ideology and Utopia
Last summer Dave Harris
told President Sterling that he
thought students should appoint
students to the Presidential Ad
visory Committees. Because of
this feeling, Dave decided to ap
point only one nominee for
each position on the committees.
He told President Sterling this.
On September 20 President
Sterling asked for nominees for
the student positions. At that
time the President neither re
stated the usual ground rules of
"choose six get three" not spec
ified any other method. He sim
ply listed the positions open and
mentioned that he would seek
further nominations from other
sources.
Dave then selected members
for the committees, after solicit
ing applications from an an
nouncement in The Dally. They

were approved by the Legisla
ture and sent to the President on
October 21.
Last week, word began to
trickle out of Building 10 that
the student members had been
chosen. After much on-campus
speculation had gone on, It was
found that eight of Dave's nom
inations had not been approved
by Sterling.
Communication Break
What is at stake here? First,
all the interchange between Pres
ident Sterling and President Har
ris has been on the actlon-reac
tion level. Communication or
negotiation has been minimal.
Fred Glover, Dr. Sterling's ad
ministrative assistant has furth
er stated that he believed there
could be no negotiation of Presi
dent Sterling's right to name all
the members of his own advisory
committees.
President Sterling does have
a legal right to do as he pleases
with his committees. It is what
pleases him that bothers us. He
seems to like to discourage every
student attempt to change the
University. Student support for
an issue seems to be its kiss
of death in his mind. He then
cries "student pressure" to which
of course he cannot yield.
Yet, who else is really advo
cating any specific programs for
improvements? Pick an issue
and see where it started. That's
the real crime, the incredible
failure of the non-student popu
lation here to make more than
sporadic attempts to relate them
selves to the pressing problems
of undergraduate education.
They seem content in the knowl
edge that students will do all the
advocating leaving them with

the much-easier role of knocker.
For example, Sterling could
have negotiated with us, or at
least made some gesture that
he cared about our input and rec
ognized our responsibility. The
committee seats aren't really a
sign of this in themselves. They
had to be fought for, too.
Or he could get the momentum
for a re-examination of educa
tion out of a committee into
some of his own comments.
Where is stimulation to come
from for re-examination. Not
from committees.
The committee issue is not the
disease; it is a symptom. It is
a symptom of the bureaucratic
mind that cannot realize that
students with a strong interest
in education and with a willing
ness to fight for it are the best
friends a university aspiring to
greatness has got.
