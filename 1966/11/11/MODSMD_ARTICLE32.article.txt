## University Administration Run From Underground 
### Bob Fishman 
A concrete bunker forty feet
below Inner Quad is the head
quarters of an administrative
department so secret that even
the mention of its name causes
Building 10 to tremble notice
ably.
For this department is the
guardian of a machine that is
the real source of all power at
Stanford: the Stanford Image
Meter.
Many years ago a genius in
the Electrical Engineering De
partment conceived of a way
to end all problems of decision
making. He invented a tiny,
transistorized device which could
be inserted in the visceral re
gions of prominent alumni, don
ors, businessmen, and hometown
newspaper editors.
Button Curbs Panic
When a button is pushed, these
devices project the "gut" reac
tions of all these leaders to any
Stanford problem. The men In
volved don't even have to think.
Here at Stanford the signals
are weighted according to se
cret formula devised by Dunn
& Bradstreet, and finally are con
verted to a number which ap
pears on the face of the image
meter.
"We don't worry about prin
ciples any more," one Dean was
overheard saying. "All our de
cisions are now objective."
Because of the secrecy sur
rounding the Image Meter, many
students are unaware of the pro
cess by which decisions are
really made. Take, for example,
the suspension of the Phi Delts.
Sample Problem
The problem first arose when
the house stole 11,000 Dailies.
The Image Meter disclosed that
the reaction to this was strongly
positive.
The Dean's Office was about to
send out a form letter congratu
lating the Phi Delts on their
"image building" when reports
of the Mills exchange produced

a negative rating on the Image
Meter that was too strong to be
ignored.
Least Emotional
After feeding in many possible
solutions ,it was found that sus
pending the house for one year
aroused the least emotions.
This solution was automatic
ally accepted.
The task of finding reasons
for the decision was delegated by
the Image Meter to the Dean's
Office and the Interfraternity
Board. Despite the machine's
notable success with problems
like this one ,a few critics have
questioned its accuracy.
Accuracy Relative
It is true that in moments of
crisis the machine has been skit
tish. For three months after the
election of Dave Harris no ac
curate readings could be ob
tained.
A bad word or two about Stan
ford in TIME magazine always
upsets the machine for at least
a week.
And some questions, such as
the dispensing of birth control
pills and the Vietnam demonstra
tions ,are so controversial that
they are not even fed into the
machine at all. Nonetheless, the
influence of the Image Meter
has grown steadily.
A Little Image-nation
The machine now has full
control over admissions. (The
results of this change have not
been apparent.)
All freshman English and
Western Civ compositions are
now graded by the machine.
A few radicals have even
argued that the President and
all the Deans are now obsolete
and should be replaced by a data
processing system.
There is little chance, how
ever, that this change will ever
occur. The Image Meter has dis
closed a strong negative reaction
to it.

notable success with problems
like this one ,a few critics have
questioned its accuracy.
Accuracy Relative
It is true that in moments of
crisis the machine has been skit
tish. For three months after the
election of Dave Harris no ac
curate readings could be ob
tained.
A bad word or two about Stan
ford in TIME magazine always
upsets the machine for at least
a week.
And some questions, such as
the dispensing of birth control
pills and the Vietnam demonstra
tions ,are so controversial that
they are not even fed into the
machine at all. Nonetheless, the
influence of the Image Meter
has grown steadily.
A Little Image-nation
The machine now has full
control over admissions. (The
results of this change have not
been apparent.)
All freshman English and
Western Civ compositions are
now graded by the machine.
A few radicals have even
argued that the President and
all the Deans are now obsolete
and should be replaced by a data
processing system.
There is little chance, how
ever, that this change will ever
occur. The Image Meter has dis
closed a strong negative reaction
to it.
A concrete bunker forty feet
below Inner Quad is the head
quarters of an administrative
department so secret that even
the mention of its name causes
Building 10 to tremble notice
ably.
For this department is the
guardian of a machine that is
the real source of all power at
Stanford: the Stanford Image
Meter.
Many years ago a genius in
the Electrical Engineering De
partment conceived of a way
to end all problems of decision
making. He invented a tiny,
transistorized device which could
be inserted in the visceral re
gions of prominent alumni, don
ors, businessmen, and hometown
newspaper editors.
Button Curbs Panic
When a button is pushed, these
devices project the "gut" reac
tions of all these leaders to any
Stanford problem. The men In
volved don't even have to think.
Here at Stanford the signals
are weighted according to se
cret formula devised by Dunn
& Bradstreet, and finally are con
verted to a number which ap
pears on the face of the image
meter.
"We don't worry about prin
ciples any more," one Dean was
overheard saying. "All our de
cisions are now objective."
Because of the secrecy sur
rounding the Image Meter, many
students are unaware of the pro
cess by which decisions are
really made. Take, for example,
the suspension of the Phi Delts.
Sample Problem
The problem first arose when
the house stole 11,000 Dailies.
The Image Meter disclosed that
the reaction to this was strongly
positive.
The Dean's Office was about to
send out a form letter congratu
lating the Phi Delts on their
"image building" when reports
of the Mills exchange produced

a negative rating on the Image
Meter that was too strong to be
ignored.
Least Emotional
After feeding in many possible
solutions ,it was found that sus
pending the house for one year
aroused the least emotions.
This solution was automatic
ally accepted.
The task of finding reasons
for the decision was delegated by
the Image Meter to the Dean's
Office and the Interfraternity
Board. Despite the machine's
