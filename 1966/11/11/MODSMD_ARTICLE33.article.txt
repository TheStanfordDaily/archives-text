# Letters To The Editor
## Election Coverage Praised 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Thanks are due for your elec
tion reporting. While inexact in
sertions hexed some catch-up
line leads, the tables were there
to back up the stories. No other
newspaper I have seen had any
thing like it so soon. For those
watching the East as well as
the West, you had A-l coverage.

â€¢ The New Trinity
Editor, The Daily:
I must confess that Mr. Lau's
approach to ROTC (as expressed
in Monday's Daily) left me at
once elated and frustrated. I
was elated to learn that there
were indeed Cadets to whom Mr.
Bennett's letter applied, yet
frustrated by Mr. Lau's evasive
defense of his position.
If Mr. Lau abhors killing, how
can he justify trying to avoid it
by indenturing himself to an

organization that exists for the
sole purpose of killing? More
over, how can he use a phrase
such as "the reality of the draft
laws in this country" without
realizing that latent fascism that
resides in such a phrase?
And when we talk of "God,
mother, and country" do we
have to assume that the three
are inseparable? In my opinion,
it would be much more worth
while to contribute a few years
for my country, rather than to
my country. JIM FREEMAN
