# Stunt Cards Only Hidden
## 
### 
Axe Comm was faced with a mys
tery last week.
The Stanford card section was left
empty-handed when all the computer
programmed cards disappeared.
With Big Game only two weeks
away, there was immediate suspicion
that Berkeley students were involved
in the theft. Ernie Fretter, in charge
of card stunts for Cal's Rally Comm,
denied knowledge of the incident.
The first clue came Saturday morn
ing when the Stanford Athletic De
partment received a tip from the
Chronicle that the cards we re
"buried" In the stadium. They later
appeared, not under the turf, but be
low the room where they are usually
stored.
The theft was an RF by four Cal
sophomores, who called the Chronicle
to report their success, not expecting
the leak to Stanford.
This week Axe Comm is taking no
chances. The cards have been care
fully hidden, not to appear again until
Big Game when the stunts will be
staged in their usual technicolor in
stead of red and white.
