# Education Committee Considers Pass-Fail, Teaching, Admissions
## 
### LIZ EMERY 
Forty students met at 4:15 in Tres
idder yesterday to discuss the poten
tials and possible goals of ASSU's
newly formed Education Committee.
Dave Harris opened the meeting by
asserting that "many structures at
this university really aren't going to
do anything about education." He sees
the new Education Committee as part
of a reconstruction of the university,
with its purpose to formulate "hard
lined" proposals.
He stressed that the Committee
"shouldn't be oriented toward practi
cal politics: the idea is not to find
something acceptable; it is to find

something good." Once good ideas are
presented, it would be the job of
smaller committees to make them ac
ceptable.
Rick Levin, the Education Commit
tee's chairman, outlined possible areas
for research and action by subcom
mittees. He proposed intensive study
of the workability of a Pass-Fail grad
ing system for freshman year.
This study should include surveys
of general opinion and personal talks
with as many students and faculty
members as possible. An evaluation of
the success of the Pass-Fail system at
Cal Tech would also be in order.

Levin also suggested a more
thoroughgoing study of the overseas
campus program than the Martindale
report provides.
Describing a survey taken this fall
to study Stanford's criteria for stu
dent admission. Levin said forms
were sent to all rejected freshman
applicants, for information on which
to base an admissions appraisal.
Levin said the idea of a program of
teacher evaluation is backed by many
members of the faculty and adminis
tration. "Some," he quipped, "are
quite willing to concede that teaching
Is important around here."
