# Harris To Clarify His ASSU Appointments
## 
### BARBARA WARREN 
Student Body President Dave Harris
will speak at noon today in White
Plaza to explain his position on stu
dent appointments to Presidential Ad
visory Committees.
Harris announced his intention of
speaking after the Legislature last
night passed a resolution requesting
such communication to the student
body. The resolution also urged the
students not appointed by Harris to
refuse or resign their positions on
the Presidential Advisory Committees.
Speaker Tom Forstenzer indicated
his concern for getting the "issue out
of the upstairs office of the ASSU
down to where the people can talk
about it."
Harris had earlier stated that the
central issue was the matter of con
stituency. He reported that the Office
of the President had refused to tell
him which of his appointees had been
accepted. He described the proposed
resignations as a "kind of symbolic
principle" indicating that students
should not participate on the adminis
tration's terms, but rather on their
own ( terms as student representatives.
He told LASSU that this was the first
year applications had been taken for
the positions.
The last resolved clause referred
the issue to the Committee of Fifteen
and urged appropriate action on the
administrative committee structure.
The "Off" Movement sponsored a
resolution urging President Sterling to
bring the results of the recent refer
endum on Women Off Campus living
to the next meeting of the Board of
Trustees, the only place where action

can be taken. The motion was amend
ed to send the issue to the Committee
of Fifteen before the Trustees as a
more expedient route.
A bill was passed which would end
the short-lived tradition of electing
a Homecoming Queen one year after
its beginning, but was amended to put
the question on the ballot in next
week's campus wide election for grad
uate and off-campus LASSU repre
sentatives.
The bill stated "There shall not be
a Homecoming Queen or a person
elected to a similar role for ever and
ever." To make it less frivolous, the
bill will be reworded on the ballot to
read, "Shall there be a Homecoming
Queen in the future?"
In the President's report, Harris an
nounced the official resignation of Jan
Jacobi as chairman of the Housing
Commission and named John Trimber
as his replacement. Harris also men
tioned that .although no action was
taken, pass-fail Freshman year was
brought up favorably at the latest
meeting of the Committee on Under
graduate Education. He ended his re
port with the hope that LASSU would
soon make some kind of statement
about Student Organizations register
ing with the ASSU rather than the
University.
On the financial end, two important
appropriation bills, for the Exepri
ment and the Housing Commission,
were referred to the Finance Commit
tee for study. A loan to Guthrie House
of $650 for a color television was ap
proved.
An AFS request for $70 was ap
proved.

Speaker Tom Forstenzer indicated
his concern for getting the "issue out
of the upstairs office of the ASSU
down to where the people can talk
about it."
Harris had earlier stated that the
central issue was the matter of con
stituency. He reported that the Office
of the President had refused to tell
him which of his appointees had been
accepted. He described the proposed
resignations as a "kind of symbolic
principle" indicating that students
should not participate on the adminis
tration's terms, but rather on their
own ( terms as student representatives.
He told LASSU that this was the first
year applications had been taken for
the positions.
The last resolved clause referred
the issue to the Committee of Fifteen
and urged appropriate action on the
administrative committee structure.
The "Off" Movement sponsored a
resolution urging President Sterling to
bring the results of the recent refer
endum on Women Off Campus living
to the next meeting of the Board of
Trustees, the only place where action

can be taken. The motion was amend
ed to send the issue to the Committee
of Fifteen before the Trustees as a
more expedient route.
A bill was passed which would end
the short-lived tradition of electing
a Homecoming Queen one year after
its beginning, but was amended to put
the question on the ballot in next
week's campus wide election for grad
uate and off-campus LASSU repre
sentatives.
The bill stated "There shall not be
a Homecoming Queen or a person
elected to a similar role for ever and
ever." To make it less frivolous, the
bill will be reworded on the ballot to
read, "Shall there be a Homecoming
Queen in the future?"
In the President's report, Harris an
nounced the official resignation of Jan
Jacobi as chairman of the Housing
Commission and named John Trimber
as his replacement. Harris also men
tioned that .although no action was
taken, pass-fail Freshman year was
brought up favorably at the latest
meeting of the Committee on Under
graduate Education. He ended his re
port with the hope that LASSU would
soon make some kind of statement
about Student Organizations register
ing with the ASSU rather than the
University.
On the financial end, two important
appropriation bills, for the Exepri
ment and the Housing Commission,
were referred to the Finance Commit
tee for study. A loan to Guthrie House
of $650 for a color television was ap
proved.
An AFS request for $70 was ap
proved.
Student Body President Dave Harris
will speak at noon today in White
Plaza to explain his position on stu
dent appointments to Presidential Ad
visory Committees.
Harris announced his intention of
speaking after the Legislature last
night passed a resolution requesting
such communication to the student
body. The resolution also urged the
students not appointed by Harris to
refuse or resign their positions on
the Presidential Advisory Committees.
