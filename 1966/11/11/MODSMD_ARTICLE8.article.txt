# Program On Sunday

### 
"Is Oakland Burning," an
hour-long documentary taped in
the Oakland flatlands by Stan
ford junior George Howson, will
be heard on radio station KPFA
(94.1 FM) this Sunday at 1 p.m.
and again on Nov. 25 at 12:30
p.m.
Howson's recordings of the
"voices of the poor" were an
outgrowth of volunteer work
with the East Oakland Parish.
He commented that he hopes
the documentary will broaden
public awareness "of people for
whom deprivation and poverty
are a way of life."
