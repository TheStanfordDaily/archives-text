# Alums Support Frat Decision
## 
### JAMES BRISCOE 
Alumni reaction to Alpha Omega's
decision to disaffiliate from the na
tional Sigma Chi fraternity has been
overwhelmingly favorable, reports
Brock Gowdy, house president.
Gowdy, who spoke to a gathering
of alumni in the Los Angeles area this
weekend, said all but three or four
of the 55 men present expressed ap
proval of the action. "A lot of them
said they were ashamed of Sigma
Chi," he added.
Many alumni have phoned the fra
ternity, most applauding the decision
to disaffiliate, Gowdy said. However,
several have disagreed bitterly with
the action.
Unfavorable Comment
"One man called and started off
with, 'Would you want your sister to
marry a nigger?' " he recalled.
The controversy which led to Alpha
Omega's disaffiliation was precipitated
when the local chapter was suspended
by the national immediately after vot
ing to pledge a Negro in April, 1965.
No word has been received from the
national Sigma Chi organization since
the chapter voted to disaffiliate, Gowdy
said, "but a couple of guys came and
took away everything that had Sigma
Chi on it, mostly ritualistic stuff and
the letters on the door. They wanted
to take the chairs in the dining room
which also bear the Sigma Chi em
blem, but we felt that was a bit too
much."
No Comment
Officials of the national contacted
last night by The Daily declined to
comment on the affair, although John
Ablan, chairman of the committee
which had been set up to oversee the
activities of the local chapter, said
discrimination was not an issue in the
controversy.
Another row over Sigma Chi's mem
bership policies has broken out at
Oregon State University, where a San
Diego alumnus has threatened to
blackball a boy of Japanese ancestry
pledged by the local chapter.
According to Jay Greenwood, presi
dent of the OSU chapter, the alumnus,
George Reynolds, wrote in part:
'Our Own Kind'
"There is nothing wrong with our
adhering to our own kind in a social
situation as close as Sigma Chi. I
will vote to suspend Beta Pi (the OSU
chapter) if this matter is brought to
a vote."
Reynolds is on Sigma Chi's national
membership committee, any member
of which can veto any pledge proposed
by a chapter.
Greenwood said the house planned
to talk directly with Reynolds in an
effort to convince him to drop his
opposition. If Reynolds refuses to
withdraw his objection ,and the local
chapter initiates the pledge, it will
face immediate revocation of its char
ter by the national. However, refusal
to initiate him will be in violation of
the fraternity anti-discriminatory
guidelines set down by the Oregon
Board of Higher Education.

effort to convince him to drop his
opposition. If Reynolds refuses to
withdraw his objection ,and the local
chapter initiates the pledge, it will
face immediate revocation of its char
ter by the national. However, refusal
to initiate him will be in violation of
the fraternity anti-discriminatory
guidelines set down by the Oregon
Board of Higher Education.
Alumni reaction to Alpha Omega's
decision to disaffiliate from the na
tional Sigma Chi fraternity has been
overwhelmingly favorable, reports
Brock Gowdy, house president.
Gowdy, who spoke to a gathering
of alumni in the Los Angeles area this
weekend, said all but three or four
of the 55 men present expressed ap
proval of the action. "A lot of them
said they were ashamed of Sigma
Chi," he added.
Many alumni have phoned the fra
ternity, most applauding the decision
to disaffiliate, Gowdy said. However,
several have disagreed bitterly with
the action.
Unfavorable Comment
"One man called and started off
with, 'Would you want your sister to
marry a nigger?' " he recalled.
The controversy which led to Alpha
Omega's disaffiliation was precipitated
when the local chapter was suspended
by the national immediately after vot
ing to pledge a Negro in April, 1965.
No word has been received from the
national Sigma Chi organization since
the chapter voted to disaffiliate, Gowdy
said, "but a couple of guys came and
took away everything that had Sigma
Chi on it, mostly ritualistic stuff and
the letters on the door. They wanted
to take the chairs in the dining room
which also bear the Sigma Chi em
blem, but we felt that was a bit too
much."
No Comment
Officials of the national contacted
last night by The Daily declined to
comment on the affair, although John
Ablan, chairman of the committee
which had been set up to oversee the
activities of the local chapter, said
discrimination was not an issue in the
controversy.
Another row over Sigma Chi's mem
bership policies has broken out at
Oregon State University, where a San
Diego alumnus has threatened to
blackball a boy of Japanese ancestry
pledged by the local chapter.
According to Jay Greenwood, presi
dent of the OSU chapter, the alumnus,
George Reynolds, wrote in part:
'Our Own Kind'
"There is nothing wrong with our
adhering to our own kind in a social
situation as close as Sigma Chi. I
will vote to suspend Beta Pi (the OSU
chapter) if this matter is brought to
a vote."
Reynolds is on Sigma Chi's national
membership committee, any member
of which can veto any pledge proposed
by a chapter.
Greenwood said the house planned
to talk directly with Reynolds in an
effort to convince him to drop his
opposition. If Reynolds refuses to
withdraw his objection ,and the local
chapter initiates the pledge, it will
face immediate revocation of its char
ter by the national. However, refusal
to initiate him will be in violation of
