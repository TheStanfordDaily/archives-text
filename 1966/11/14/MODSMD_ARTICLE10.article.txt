# Canada, U.S.S.R. Ask For Nuclear Arms Pact Now
## News In Brief Compiled From the Associated Press 
### 
MOSCOW—Foreign Minister Paul Martin of
Canada joined Soviet leaders in Moscow Sun
day in a call for the earliest possible signing of
a treaty to prevent the spread of nuclear wea

A joint communique issued at the end of

cance of the resolutions of the United Nations
dealing with the prevention of actions which
could hinder agreement on this matter."
But the communique indicated Martin had
made no progress in his attempts to bring
peace closer in Vietnam.
The communique said both sides agreed the
Vietnamese war represented a threat to the
cause of world peace. But it added only that
Martin and Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gro
myko had "stated the respective positions of
their governments."
Martin said earlier he and Gromyko found
themselves far apart on Vietnam. From Mos
cow, Martin flew to Rome for conferences on
Vietnam and other problems with Italian of
ficials and Pope Paul VI.

• Student Kills Ma, Hangs Self
NEW YORK —A college dropout charged
with stabbing his mother to death late Sunday
night in their Queens home hanged himself

Stephen Worrall, 21, who had been bicker

stabbed my mother."

nerve condition since he switched from en
gineering to law school and then dropped out

• Student Kills Ma, Hangs Self
NEW YORK —A college dropout charged
with stabbing his mother to death late Sunday
night in their Queens home hanged himself
yesterday in his cell at the Queens House of
Detention, police said.
Stephen Worrall, 21, who had been bicker
ing with his mother for two months, called
police himself Sunday to tell them "I've just
stabbed my mother."

Worrall had been under medical care for a
nerve condition since he switched from en
gineering to law school and then dropped out
of college altogether.
His father, William, told police the daily
argument between his son and wife had
reached such a pitch Sunday he thought it wise
to refill a transquilizer prescription his son had
used up.
He returned to find his wife dead on the
kitchen floor and police already there.
Detectives said Mrs. Worrall had been

MOSCOW—Foreign Minister Paul Martin of
Canada joined Soviet leaders in Moscow Sun
day in a call for the earliest possible signing of
a treaty to prevent the spread of nuclear wea

A joint communique issued at the end of
Martin's five-day visit "underlined the signifi

could hinder agreement on this matter."
But the communique indicated Martin had
made no progress in his attempts to bring
peace closer in Vietnam.
The communique said both sides agreed the
Vietnamese war represented a threat to the
cause of world peace. But it added only that
Martin and Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gro
myko had "stated the respective positions of
their governments."
Martin said earlier he and Gromyko found
themselves far apart on Vietnam. From Mos
