# Hoover Tower To Open Grilled Deck
## 
### DON HARVEY 
Before the end of November
the observation platform at
Hoover Tower will be opened to
the public for the first time in
over a year. Michel and PfefFer,
an Iron works firm in Sam Fran
cisco, will erect a steel frame
work over each tower window
to insure the safety of all
visitors.
Since the suicides a year ago
last August, Hoover Tower ap
pears to have undergone little
physical chance in spite of the
warning sign on the first level,
"closed indefinitely for construc
tion."
At first, the Planning Office

considered closing the tower
permanently since the platform
was never designed to be a tour
ist attraction.
Later, they decided to build
grills for the windows which
would allow the visitors to con
tinue to visit the top of the land
mark.
Contract Signed
On July 11, Michel and Pfef
fer signed a contract to build
the iron frameworks for a cost
of about $36,000. The Business
Office had hoped to have the
grills in place by the end of the
summer, but, because of the low
cost of the job, the office felt
they have no right to require
the firm to work over-time just
to meet a specified deadline.
Since no construction is going
on even yet atop Hoover Tower,
the opening of the observation
tower may still seem remote.

The grills are, however, in the
final stages of prefabrication at
the construction yard. All the
bars have been welded and are
now being ground and sanded.
This week the firm workers
and University planners are dis
cussing the plans for erecting

the frameworks.
In mid-November, according
to present plans, large cranes
will hoist the grills into place.
The area around the Tower will
be closed off from all pedestrian
traffic that day while the hoist
ing takes place.
