# Pass-Fail Students Notified
## 
### 
Mid-term reports submitted to
the Registrar's Office show that
776 undergraduates have en
rolled in a course on a Pass-Fail
basis in the first quarter of the
Pass-Fail system.
Students will receive Mid-quar
ter deficiency notices so that
they will know that the arrange
ment has been reported to the
Registrar's Office on the Mid-
Quarter Report by the instruc
tor concerned. Regular deficien
cies are reported on the same
slip whether the student is en
rolled on a Pass-Fail basis or
not.
In future quarters students
will be asked to file a Pass-Fail
Declaration card signed by the
student and his instructor to as
sure the student's knowledge of
the following conditions: "A
Pass-Fail course may not be
used to satisfy general studies
or major requirements. Only one
course may be taken on this
basis per quarter. Up to 27
Pass-Fail units may count to
ward an A.B. or B.S. degree."
