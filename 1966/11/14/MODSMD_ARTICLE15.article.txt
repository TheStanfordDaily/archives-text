# Ripe Fumble Harvest Destroys Farm
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER Sports Editor 
Forty-six thousand LA Coli
seum theater-goers watched a
comedy of errors that had un
happy endings for both Stanford
and UCLA. The Bruins won,
10-0, but lost Gary Beban. Stan
ford, frustrated by six fumbles
and two interceptions, could not
get Dave Lewis' inspired offense
across the goal line.
Beban, who scored the only
touchdown of the game on a 24
yard end-sweep in the first quar
ter, cracked a bone in his leg
when he was hit behind the line
in the third period. Second QB
Norm Dow utilized Mel Farr's
strong running to guide the
Bruins to a fourth quarter field
goal to wrap up the scoring.
Ten fumbles lost in the game
amounted to an AAWU record.
Stanford's six were a Coast
record, also. Three passes ended
up in arms wrapped in the
wrong-colored jerseys. Seventeen
penalties cost the two teams
159 yards.
Rampant Slopplness
The impression of rampant
sloppiness that possesses one
after the UCLA game unfortu
nately hides some truly great
individual and team play.
Dave Lewis took back his
quarterback job with finesse that
Stanford has not seen all sea
son. Lewis passed 33 times and
connected on 17. Bob Conrad
grabed 10. Lewis' aerials gained
181 yards.
Lewis was cool behind the line,
scrambling away from Bruin
blitzers and throwing more good
passes than were caught. On
one series, Lewis moved the
Tribe 63 yards with three con
secutive shots.
Lewis also punted like the
NCAA champion, averaging 46.8
yards.
Rough Defensive Play
Both defensive teams played
bruising, extremely hard-hitting
games, reaping the bumper crop
of fumbles. Most of the game
went on between the 20 yard
lines. UCLA penetrated the 20
twice to get their 10 points and
Stanford moved inside three
times with less fruitful results.
Linebacker Marty Brill, picked
Lineman of the Game, led an
Indian blitzing pass rush that
kept Beban to an unimpressive
3/10 passing day. Stanford twice
held the Bruins on downs.
Back of the Game Mel Farr,
UCLA's All-American candidate
left halfback, turned out to be
the workhorse of the day for the
Bruins. Farr gained 128 yards,
moving up to second place
among UCLA's yard gainers.
Farr averaged 6.75 yards per
carry.
Good Start But...
Stanford opened the game on
an auspicious note. The Cards
rattled off 20 yards in no time

and appeared to be on a one
way street to the goal line when
UCLA forced a Lewis fumble
and gobbled it up.
UCLA then took over the lm
press-me opening drive, ripping
off 19 yards on 2 carries. John
Guillory put an abrupt stop to
the UCLA drive when he inter
cepted a patented Beban to Bus
by TD bomb and ran it back to
the Stanford 26.
Stanford absorbed a holding
penalty and Lewis punted 54
yards to the UCLA 30. On the
following drive, UCLA made
few mistakes. The Bruins moved
to the Indian 24 on a 12 yard
run by Beban, a 15 yard burst
by Farr, and a 17 yard pass to
fullback Rick Purdy.
Beban Scores
Beban then swept left end,
broke into open ground, and put
the game's only TD on the score
board.
It appeared that Stanford was
going to return the favor, as

Lewis hit 4 of 5 passes to move
the Cards to the UCLA 17. Woe
in the person of UCLA's safety
Tim McAteer then descended.
The Bruins intercepted on their
own 6 yard line.
Deep in their own territory,
the Bruins ran to a third and
one situation. Brill smeared
Beban behind the line on the
next play forcing a punt.
A 40 yard Lewis to Washing
ton pass play barely missed
and Stanford punted. The Cards
got the ball back in a hurry,
however, as Farr fumbled a
Beban hand-off and Guillory
pounced on the lose ball on
UCLA's 34 yard line.
Field Goal Shot Misses
Lewis, under pressure, passed
the Cards to the 10, hitting Bob
Blunt and Conrad. With first and
goal, UCLA's defense allowed
naught. Bill Shoemaker came in
on the fourth and 9. Shoemak
er's 25 yard field goal attempt
went wide.
UCLA could not move the In
dian line on the next series and
punted.

The Tribe lost the ball again,
this time on a questionable call.
Bob Blunt took a Lewis pass
and was hit from behind simul
taneous with the ball's arrival.
The ball ended upon the ground
with a Bruin on top of it, and
the ref said "Fumble."
Stanford blitzing kept the
UCLA roll-out from going any
where, but the Tribe couldn't
muster a threat either. The hal'
ended with a blue-clad 7-0 lead
trotting into the UCLA dressing
room.
Card Defense Gets Stingy
UCLA opened the second half
with a 28 yard Beban-Purdy
pass play, but then the going got
rocky. Blaine Nye dropped Beban
for a loss, Monte Mohrma.i
blocked a pass, and Bob Bittner
stopped Beban in his tracks,
forcing a UCLA punt
Jack Root's 13 yard run, a
pass to Conrad, and an escape
artist scramble play by Lewis
moved Stanford to the Bruins'
half of the field. With fourti.
down and a foot to go on the
Bruin 33, however, Root found
a brick Bruin wall and UCLA
took over on downs.
Brill smashed UCLA fullback
Purdy on the next play—hard
enough to pop the ball loose for
Indian safety Dave Nelson. Stai,
ford ate a holding penalty, then
Lewis fumbled. Then Donn
Rennwick wrested the ball from
Farr so A 1 Wilburn could pick it
up. Then . . .
Volleyball With Shoulder Pads
Confusing? It looked like a
volleyball game. In 9 plays, th.
poor football went through 3
fumbles, 3 penalties, and one in
terception ... all of which boiled
down to possession for UCLA.
On third and 8, Beban was
dumped as he threw an incom
plete pass. The tackle broke his
leg, and Beban limped off th
field never to return in 1966.
UCLA punted to the Stanford
2, where the Bruins held. Lewis
cut loose a 53 yard punt, which
coupled with a UCLA holding
penalty, pushed the Uclans back
to their own 26.
Same Old Story
UCLA could not move, and
punted to the Stanford 37. Stan
ford again appeared to be on
the move. After a bomb to Blunt
on the UCLA 20 missed its tar
get, passes to John Mason, Blunt,
and Conrad netted a first down
on the UCLA 42. Then Stanford
fumbled.
UCLA made the break count.
A 28 yard run by Fair moved
UCLA to the Stanford 5. Brill
piled up two plays and Mike
Hibler deflected a pass, so UCLA
kicked . . . accurately. Kurt
Zimmerman's field goal was
good.
After another raft of penalties
and fumbles, Stanford got the
ball on its own 31. Lewis fired
a 21 yard pass to Bunt, and Gene
Washington turned his reception
into a 32 yard gain on the next
play. Conrad hauled down »
Lewis pass on the 3 on the next
play.
First Down On The Seven
Two penalties slid the ball
back to the 7. With a first down
on the seven, three Lewis to Con
rad passes failed to connect.
Bill Shoemaker lined up to
kick the field goal, but
pumped up with the snap and
fired a pass that skidded of John
Mason's outstretched fingertips.

UCLA made the break count.
A 28 yard run by Fair moved
UCLA to the Stanford 5. Brill
piled up two plays and Mike
Hibler deflected a pass, so UCLA
kicked . . . accurately. Kurt
Zimmerman's field goal was
good.
After another raft of penalties
and fumbles, Stanford got the

a 21 yard pass to Bunt, and Gene
Washington turned his reception
into a 32 yard gain on the next
play. Conrad hauled down »
Lewis pass on the 3 on the next

First Down On The Seven
Two penalties slid the ball
back to the 7. With a first down
on the seven, three Lewis to Con
rad passes failed to connect.
Bill Shoemaker lined up to
kick the field goal, but
pumped up with the snap and
fired a pass that skidded of John
Mason's outstretched fingertips.
Forty-six thousand LA Coli
seum theater-goers watched a
comedy of errors that had un
happy endings for both Stanford
and UCLA. The Bruins won,
10-0, but lost Gary Beban. Stan
ford, frustrated by six fumbles
and two interceptions, could not
get Dave Lewis' inspired offense
across the goal line.
Beban, who scored the only
touchdown of the game on a 24
yard end-sweep in the first quar
ter, cracked a bone in his leg
when he was hit behind the line
in the third period. Second QB
Norm Dow utilized Mel Farr's
strong running to guide the
Bruins to a fourth quarter field
goal to wrap up the scoring.
Ten fumbles lost in the game
amounted to an AAWU record.
Stanford's six were a Coast
record, also. Three passes ended
up in arms wrapped in the
wrong-colored jerseys. Seventeen

159 yards.
Rampant Slopplness
The impression of rampant
sloppiness that possesses one
after the UCLA game unfortu

individual and team play.
Dave Lewis took back his
quarterback job with finesse that
Stanford has not seen all sea
son. Lewis passed 33 times and
connected on 17. Bob Conrad
grabed 10. Lewis' aerials gained
181 yards.
Lewis was cool behind the line,
scrambling away from Bruin
blitzers and throwing more good
passes than were caught. On
one series, Lewis moved the
Tribe 63 yards with three con
secutive shots.
Lewis also punted like the
NCAA champion, averaging 46.8
yards.
Rough Defensive Play
Both defensive teams played
bruising, extremely hard-hitting
games, reaping the bumper crop
of fumbles. Most of the game
went on between the 20 yard
lines. UCLA penetrated the 20
twice to get their 10 points and
Stanford moved inside three
times with less fruitful results.
Linebacker Marty Brill, picked
Lineman of the Game, led an
Indian blitzing pass rush that
kept Beban to an unimpressive
3/10 passing day. Stanford twice
held the Bruins on downs.
Back of the Game Mel Farr,
UCLA's All-American candidate
left halfback, turned out to be
the workhorse of the day for the
Bruins. Farr gained 128 yards,
moving up to second place
among UCLA's yard gainers.
Farr averaged 6.75 yards per
carry.
Good Start But...
Stanford opened the game on
an auspicious note. The Cards
rattled off 20 yards in no time

and appeared to be on a one
way street to the goal line when
UCLA forced a Lewis fumble
and gobbled it up.
UCLA then took over the lm
press-me opening drive, ripping
off 19 yards on 2 carries. John
Guillory put an abrupt stop to
the UCLA drive when he inter
cepted a patented Beban to Bus
by TD bomb and ran it back to
the Stanford 26.
Stanford absorbed a holding
penalty and Lewis punted 54
yards to the UCLA 30. On the
following drive, UCLA made
few mistakes. The Bruins moved
to the Indian 24 on a 12 yard
run by Beban, a 15 yard burst
by Farr, and a 17 yard pass to
fullback Rick Purdy.
Beban Scores
Beban then swept left end,
broke into open ground, and put
the game's only TD on the score
board.
It appeared that Stanford was
going to return the favor, as

Lewis hit 4 of 5 passes to move
the Cards to the UCLA 17. Woe
in the person of UCLA's safety
Tim McAteer then descended.
The Bruins intercepted on their
own 6 yard line.
Deep in their own territory,
the Bruins ran to a third and
one situation. Brill smeared
Beban behind the line on the
next play forcing a punt.
A 40 yard Lewis to Washing
ton pass play barely missed
and Stanford punted. The Cards
got the ball back in a hurry,
however, as Farr fumbled a
Beban hand-off and Guillory
pounced on the lose ball on
UCLA's 34 yard line.
Field Goal Shot Misses
Lewis, under pressure, passed
the Cards to the 10, hitting Bob
Blunt and Conrad. With first and

went wide.
UCLA could not move the In
dian line on the next series and
punted.

The Tribe lost the ball again,
this time on a questionable call.
Bob Blunt took a Lewis pass
and was hit from behind simul
taneous with the ball's arrival.
The ball ended upon the ground
with a Bruin on top of it, and
the ref said "Fumble."
Stanford blitzing kept the
UCLA roll-out from going any
where, but the Tribe couldn't
muster a threat either. The hal'
ended with a blue-clad 7-0 lead
trotting into the UCLA dressing
room.
Card Defense Gets Stingy
UCLA opened the second half
with a 28 yard Beban-Purdy
pass play, but then the going got
rocky. Blaine Nye dropped Beban
for a loss, Monte Mohrma.i
blocked a pass, and Bob Bittner
stopped Beban in his tracks,
forcing a UCLA punt
Jack Root's 13 yard run, a
pass to Conrad, and an escape
artist scramble play by Lewis
moved Stanford to the Bruins'
half of the field. With fourti.
down and a foot to go on the
Bruin 33, however, Root found
a brick Bruin wall and UCLA
took over on downs.
Brill smashed UCLA fullback
Purdy on the next play—hard
enough to pop the ball loose for
Indian safety Dave Nelson. Stai,
ford ate a holding penalty, then
Lewis fumbled. Then Donn
Rennwick wrested the ball from
Farr so A 1 Wilburn could pick it
up. Then . . .
Volleyball With Shoulder Pads
Confusing? It looked like a
volleyball game. In 9 plays, th.
poor football went through 3
fumbles, 3 penalties, and one in
terception ... all of which boiled
down to possession for UCLA.
On third and 8, Beban was
dumped as he threw an incom
plete pass. The tackle broke his
leg, and Beban limped off th
field never to return in 1966.
UCLA punted to the Stanford
2, where the Bruins held. Lewis
cut loose a 53 yard punt, which
coupled with a UCLA holding
penalty, pushed the Uclans back

fumbles, 3 penalties, and one in
terception ... all of which boiled
down to possession for UCLA.

dumped as he threw an incom
plete pass. The tackle broke his
leg, and Beban limped off th
field never to return in 1966.
UCLA punted to the Stanford
2, where the Bruins held. Lewis
cut loose a 53 yard punt, which
coupled with a UCLA holding
penalty, pushed the Uclans back
to their own 26.
Same Old Story
UCLA could not move, and
punted to the Stanford 37. Stan
ford again appeared to be on
the move. After a bomb to Blunt
on the UCLA 20 missed its tar
get, passes to John Mason, Blunt,
and Conrad netted a first down
on the UCLA 42. Then Stanford
fumbled.
UCLA made the break count.
A 28 yard run by Fair moved
UCLA to the Stanford 5. Brill
piled up two plays and Mike
Hibler deflected a pass, so UCLA

on the seven, three Lewis to Con

Bill Shoemaker lined up to
kick the field goal, but
pumped up with the snap and
fired a pass that skidded of John
Mason's outstretched fingertips.
Forty-six thousand LA Coli
seum theater-goers watched a
comedy of errors that had un
happy endings for both Stanford
and UCLA. The Bruins won,
10-0, but lost Gary Beban. Stan
ford, frustrated by six fumbles
and two interceptions, could not
get Dave Lewis' inspired offense
across the goal line.
Beban, who scored the only
touchdown of the game on a 24
yard end-sweep in the first quar

NCAA champion, averaging 46.8

Rough Defensive Play
Both defensive teams played
bruising, extremely hard-hitting
games, reaping the bumper crop
of fumbles. Most of the game
went on between the 20 yard
lines. UCLA penetrated the 20
twice to get their 10 points and
Stanford moved inside three
times with less fruitful results.
Linebacker Marty Brill, picked
Lineman of the Game, led an
Indian blitzing pass rush that
kept Beban to an unimpressive
3/10 passing day. Stanford twice
held the Bruins on downs.
Back of the Game Mel Farr,
UCLA's All-American candidate
left halfback, turned out to be
the workhorse of the day for the
Bruins. Farr gained 128 yards,
moving up to second place
among UCLA's yard gainers.
Farr averaged 6.75 yards per
carry.
Good Start But...
Stanford opened the game on
an auspicious note. The Cards
rattled off 20 yards in no time

and appeared to be on a one
way street to the goal line when
UCLA forced a Lewis fumble
and gobbled it up.
UCLA then took over the lm
press-me opening drive, ripping
off 19 yards on 2 carries. John
Guillory put an abrupt stop to
the UCLA drive when he inter
cepted a patented Beban to Bus
by TD bomb and ran it back to
the Stanford 26.
Stanford absorbed a holding
penalty and Lewis punted 54
yards to the UCLA 30. On the
following drive, UCLA made
few mistakes. The Bruins moved
to the Indian 24 on a 12 yard
run by Beban, a 15 yard burst
by Farr, and a 17 yard pass to
fullback Rick Purdy.
Beban Scores
Beban then swept left end,
broke into open ground, and put
the game's only TD on the score
board.
It appeared that Stanford was
going to return the favor, as

Tim McAteer then descended.
The Bruins intercepted on their

Deep in their own territory,
the Bruins ran to a third and
one situation. Brill smeared
Beban behind the line on the
next play forcing a punt.
A 40 yard Lewis to Washing

Beban hand-off and Guillory
pounced on the lose ball on
UCLA's 34 yard line.
Field Goal Shot Misses

the Cards to the 10, hitting Bob
Blunt and Conrad. With first and

went wide.
UCLA could not move the In

punted.

The Tribe lost the ball again,
this time on a questionable call.
Bob Blunt took a Lewis pass
and was hit from behind simul
taneous with the ball's arrival.
The ball ended upon the ground
with a Bruin on top of it, and
the ref said "Fumble."
Stanford blitzing kept the
UCLA roll-out from going any
where, but the Tribe couldn't
muster a threat either. The hal'
ended with a blue-clad 7-0 lead
trotting into the UCLA dressing
room.
Card Defense Gets Stingy
UCLA opened the second half
with a 28 yard Beban-Purdy
pass play, but then the going got
rocky. Blaine Nye dropped Beban
for a loss, Monte Mohrma.i
blocked a pass, and Bob Bittner
stopped Beban in his tracks,
forcing a UCLA punt
Jack Root's 13 yard run, a
pass to Conrad, and an escape
artist scramble play by Lewis
moved Stanford to the Bruins'
half of the field. With fourti.
down and a foot to go on the
Bruin 33, however, Root found
a brick Bruin wall and UCLA
took over on downs.
Brill smashed UCLA fullback
Purdy on the next play—hard
enough to pop the ball loose for
Indian safety Dave Nelson. Stai,
ford ate a holding penalty, then
Lewis fumbled. Then Donn
Rennwick wrested the ball from
Farr so A 1 Wilburn could pick it
up. Then . . .

blocked a pass, and Bob Bittner
stopped Beban in his tracks,
forcing a UCLA punt
Jack Root's 13 yard run, a
pass to Conrad, and an escape
artist scramble play by Lewis
moved Stanford to the Bruins'
half of the field. With fourti.
down and a foot to go on the
Bruin 33, however, Root found
a brick Bruin wall and UCLA
took over on downs.
Brill smashed UCLA fullback
Purdy on the next play—hard
enough to pop the ball loose for
Indian safety Dave Nelson. Stai,
ford ate a holding penalty, then
Lewis fumbled. Then Donn
Rennwick wrested the ball from
Farr so A 1 Wilburn could pick it
up. Then . . .
Volleyball With Shoulder Pads
Confusing? It looked like a
volleyball game. In 9 plays, th.
poor football went through 3
fumbles, 3 penalties, and one in
terception ... all of which boiled
down to possession for UCLA.
On third and 8, Beban was
dumped as he threw an incom
plete pass. The tackle broke his
leg, and Beban limped off th
field never to return in 1966.
UCLA punted to the Stanford
2, where the Bruins held. Lewis
cut loose a 53 yard punt, which
coupled with a UCLA holding
penalty, pushed the Uclans back
to their own 26.
Same Old Story
UCLA could not move, and
punted to the Stanford 37. Stan
ford again appeared to be on
the move. After a bomb to Blunt
on the UCLA 20 missed its tar
get, passes to John Mason, Blunt,
and Conrad netted a first down
on the UCLA 42. Then Stanford
fumbled.
UCLA made the break count.
A 28 yard run by Fair moved
UCLA to the Stanford 5. Brill
piled up two plays and Mike
Hibler deflected a pass, so UCLA
kicked . . . accurately. Kurt
Zimmerman's field goal was
good.
After another raft of penalties
and fumbles, Stanford got the
ball on its own 31. Lewis fired
a 21 yard pass to Bunt, and Gene
Washington turned his reception
into a 32 yard gain on the next
play. Conrad hauled down »
Lewis pass on the 3 on the next
play.
First Down On The Seven
Two penalties slid the ball
back to the 7. With a first down
on the seven, three Lewis to Con
rad passes failed to connect.
Bill Shoemaker lined up to
kick the field goal, but
pumped up with the snap and
fired a pass that skidded of John
Mason's outstretched fingertips.
Forty-six thousand LA Coli
seum theater-goers watched a
comedy of errors that had un
happy endings for both Stanford
and UCLA. The Bruins won,
10-0, but lost Gary Beban. Stan
ford, frustrated by six fumbles
and two interceptions, could not
get Dave Lewis' inspired offense
across the goal line.
Beban, who scored the only
touchdown of the game on a 24
yard end-sweep in the first quar
ter, cracked a bone in his leg
when he was hit behind the line
in the third period. Second QB
Norm Dow utilized Mel Farr's
strong running to guide the
Bruins to a fourth quarter field
goal to wrap up the scoring.
Ten fumbles lost in the game
amounted to an AAWU record.
Stanford's six were a Coast
record, also. Three passes ended
up in arms wrapped in the
wrong-colored jerseys. Seventeen
penalties cost the two teams
159 yards.
Rampant Slopplness
The impression of rampant
sloppiness that possesses one
after the UCLA game unfortu
nately hides some truly great
individual and team play.
Dave Lewis took back his
quarterback job with finesse that
Stanford has not seen all sea
son. Lewis passed 33 times and
connected on 17. Bob Conrad
grabed 10. Lewis' aerials gained
181 yards.
Lewis was cool behind the line,
scrambling away from Bruin
blitzers and throwing more good
passes than were caught. On
one series, Lewis moved the
Tribe 63 yards with three con
secutive shots.
Lewis also punted like the
NCAA champion, averaging 46.8
yards.
Rough Defensive Play
Both defensive teams played
bruising, extremely hard-hitting
games, reaping the bumper crop
of fumbles. Most of the game
went on between the 20 yard
lines. UCLA penetrated the 20
twice to get their 10 points and
Stanford moved inside three
times with less fruitful results.
Linebacker Marty Brill, picked
Lineman of the Game, led an
Indian blitzing pass rush that
kept Beban to an unimpressive
3/10 passing day. Stanford twice
held the Bruins on downs.
Back of the Game Mel Farr,
UCLA's All-American candidate
left halfback, turned out to be
the workhorse of the day for the
Bruins. Farr gained 128 yards,
moving up to second place
among UCLA's yard gainers.
Farr averaged 6.75 yards per
carry.
Good Start But...
Stanford opened the game on
an auspicious note. The Cards
rattled off 20 yards in no time

and appeared to be on a one
way street to the goal line when
UCLA forced a Lewis fumble
and gobbled it up.
UCLA then took over the lm
press-me opening drive, ripping
off 19 yards on 2 carries. John
Guillory put an abrupt stop to
the UCLA drive when he inter
cepted a patented Beban to Bus
by TD bomb and ran it back to
the Stanford 26.
Stanford absorbed a holding
penalty and Lewis punted 54
yards to the UCLA 30. On the
following drive, UCLA made
few mistakes. The Bruins moved
to the Indian 24 on a 12 yard
run by Beban, a 15 yard burst
by Farr, and a 17 yard pass to
fullback Rick Purdy.
Beban Scores
Beban then swept left end,
broke into open ground, and put
the game's only TD on the score
board.
It appeared that Stanford was
going to return the favor, as

Lewis hit 4 of 5 passes to move
the Cards to the UCLA 17. Woe
in the person of UCLA's safety
Tim McAteer then descended.
The Bruins intercepted on their
own 6 yard line.
Deep in their own territory,
the Bruins ran to a third and
one situation. Brill smeared
Beban behind the line on the
next play forcing a punt.
A 40 yard Lewis to Washing
ton pass play barely missed
and Stanford punted. The Cards
got the ball back in a hurry,
however, as Farr fumbled a
Beban hand-off and Guillory
pounced on the lose ball on
UCLA's 34 yard line.
Field Goal Shot Misses
Lewis, under pressure, passed
the Cards to the 10, hitting Bob
Blunt and Conrad. With first and
goal, UCLA's defense allowed
naught. Bill Shoemaker came in
on the fourth and 9. Shoemak
er's 25 yard field goal attempt
went wide.
UCLA could not move the In
dian line on the next series and
punted.

The Tribe lost the ball again,
this time on a questionable call.
Bob Blunt took a Lewis pass
and was hit from behind simul
taneous with the ball's arrival.
The ball ended upon the ground
with a Bruin on top of it, and
the ref said "Fumble."
Stanford blitzing kept the
UCLA roll-out from going any
where, but the Tribe couldn't
muster a threat either. The hal'
ended with a blue-clad 7-0 lead
trotting into the UCLA dressing
room.
Card Defense Gets Stingy
UCLA opened the second half
with a 28 yard Beban-Purdy
pass play, but then the going got
rocky. Blaine Nye dropped Beban
for a loss, Monte Mohrma.i
blocked a pass, and Bob Bittner
stopped Beban in his tracks,
forcing a UCLA punt
Jack Root's 13 yard run, a
