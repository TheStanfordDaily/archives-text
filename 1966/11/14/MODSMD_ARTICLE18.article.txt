Stanford's defense held the Bruins' potent offense
to only 10 points Saturday, and defensive guard
Mike Hibled (69) shows why here as his tackle
launches flying Uclan halfback Mel Farr. Btibler's
cohort on defense, linebacker Marty Brill, was
named Lineman of the Game for his rushes on
quarterback Gary Beban whom the Cards limited
to 61 yards passing. The Tribe offense failed to
produce any points, however, and Stanford lost
10-0.
