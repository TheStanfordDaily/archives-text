## 
### GREG PSALTIS 
Stanford's varsity cross coun
try team fell in defeat at the
hands of UCLA, 23-32, at the
Bruins' course Saturday.
Indians Jim Letterer and Bob
Kelley both ran outstanding

races, but UCLA's team strength
overpowered the Cards.
The Bruins' Rick Romero won
the 4.2 mile race with a 21:35
clocking. Letterer and Kelley
finished second and third, 10
and 13 seconds, respectively, be
hind Romero.
UCLA then ran its next four
men in all together in a string
leaving Stanford's Randy Hyvo
nen, Bob Anchondo and Brook
Thomas in eighth, ninth and
tenth.
The trio came in just six
seconds apart. Hyvonen's 22:36
clocking was only 14 seconds
behind seventh place finisher
Kevin Goffe's time.
Coach Jerry Barland said that
he was especially pleased with
Bob Kelley. He said that Kelley
has been improving all year and
that this was his most outstand
ing race of the season.
Barland also said that Letter
er did his usual consistent good
job.
Barland felt that the course
may have had a bearing on the

outcome of the race. Hyvonen,
Anchonodo and Thomas all finish
ed fast, probably because they
didn't know what to expect in
the first part of the course.
Thursday the varsity and
freshman teams will travel to
Berkeley for a meet with Cali
fornia's teams. California's var
sity beat the Cards earlier this
year in a meet at the Stanford
Golf Course.
Frosh Put Record On Line
The freshmen will be trying
to extend their undefeated sea
son record. Their victories in
clude three over the California
freshmen.
The freshman race will begin
at 4. The varsity race will come
immediately after the freshman
race.
Last Thursday the freshmen
ran their two mile race for the
postal meet with Kansas Uni
versity's freshmen. Greg Brock
led the Stanford runners with a
9:18.6 effort. He was followed
by Steve Karpinos, Chuck Menz,
Dave Redwine and Sterling
Speirn.
