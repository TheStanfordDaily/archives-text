# Traditional RF's Usher In Big Game Week
## 
### 
A sparkling Cal-blue dye in Mem Claw and blue
C's sprayed randomly through White Plaza last
Friday launched Big Game week, which annually
inspires hundreds of dollars of vandalism in the
name of school spirit.
Maintenance crews were soon at work methodi
cally erasing the damage, and red-hot freshmen
rallied to participate in a roving guard which
might prevent further successful Cal RFs, but
the blue sprayed taunts from Cal continued to ap
pear over the weekend.
It is all a part of hallowed Big Game tradition,
which creates the impression that each Stanford
student, when he pledges to observe the Honor
Code and Fundamental Standard, must also place
his hand on a Bible and utter the sacred oath
"Beat Cal."
Overseas, Too
The spirit annually spread thousands of miles
overseas. This year, Stanford-in-Britain students
report success in hanging a "Beat Cal" banner
from the Tower of London.
The banner, composed of blood-red lettering on
sheets stitched firmly together, dangled only briefly

from the tower as a wind flipped it about, thwart
ing eager Stanford photographers. British guards
confiscated the banner when it fell to the ground.
The students original goal was Big Ben, but they
were denied access to the clock tower.
Back on the home campus, Cardinals' Board has
raised the battle cry "Six in '66" to inspire a Big
Game victory, which would be Sstanford's sixth
in a row over Cal. They will distribute buttons,
pencils, and bumper JUic'.rers on this theme begin
ning Wednesday .which has been declared Red
and White Day.
Red And White
Students are encouraged to wear Stanford colors
to Wednesday's noon rally in front of the book
store. That evening members of the football team
will dine in women's residences.
A "Bury the Bear" rally planned for Thursday
noon at Tresidder will feature the case and killing
of a fraudulent Oskie, Cal's mascot, by a Stanford
Indian.
Climaxing Big Game activities will be the tra
ditional bonfire in Lake Lag at 6:30 Friday eve
ning. Freshman boys will work all week under

the direction of Kirk Brown, collecting wood to
construct a mammoth 45 foot C, pierced by an In
dian arrow.
Telephone Poles
The twenty telephone poles supporting the bon
fire will be erected Monday morning, necessitating
a 24-hour vigil all week by freshman guards.
Crews must watch the Lagunita floodgates as well
as the poles, and will patrol with fire extinguishers
to guard against premature lighting of the fire by
Cal.
Work on the project will begin at 5:30 Friday
morning, while freshman dollies serve coffee and
doughnuts to the laborers.
Football flicks will be shown to the public at
Wilbur this year ,and are scheduled to begin
directly after dinner Monday through Thursday.
The closely guarded Stanford Axe, Big Game
trophy since 1930, is being kept in a bank vault this
week and will only be removed for triumphant dis
play at rallies and the bonfire. Protected through
the year behind a burglar proof case in Tresidder,
it is a tempting prize for ingenious Cal pranksters.
