# Poloists Beat Foothill, LBS; Frosh Rally For Two Wins
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Stanford's water polo teams
climbed out of the pool with
four victories last weekend. The
varsity made no mountain out
of Foothill, winning 9-6. Satur
day the Indians beat Long
Beach State.
The freshman water polo
team went out of its way to
grab its glory. The Papooses
dunked the Foothill JV's, 9-8.
Stanford scored the winning
goal in the last 10 seconds, after
spotting the Owls a 6-2 lead.
Saturday, against Await High
School, the frosh swallowed gas
filled water until Await picked
up a 7-2 halftime lead. The Pa
pooses revered the flow of
points in the second half to win
its second 9-8, last-minute game
of the weekend.
1 Stanford had little problem
with the Foothill varsity. The
Indians applied a water-tight full
court press in the first half to
limit Foothill to three shots.
Stanford secored two, missing
more than the Card's 45 per
cent average could stand.
Leading 2-0 at the half, Stan
ford broke the game open. Gary
Sheerer slammed in his fourth

of the game, while Pete Ready,
Pete Siebert, and Luis Nicolao
each hit one.
Stanford coach Jim Gaughran
substituted widely in the fourth
quarter, riding atop a comfort
able 8-1 advantage. Foothill had
a big fourth period and brought
the score up to the final 9-6.
The Indians shot a poor 25
per cent in the game, keeping
the score from soaring as it
probably should have. No Stan
ford players fouled out of the
contest.
Fool's Gold For 49'ers
Stanford played always troub
lesome Long Beach State in the
49'ers home pool. Sheerer,
Ready, and Mark Parmely gave
the Cards a 3-2 lead after one
quarter.
Parmely, John Parker, and
Greg Buckingham each hit once
in the second quarter to widen
the Indians' lead to 6-2 at half
time.
Pete Siebert scored the only
Stanford goal in the third period
as Long Beach narrowed the
gap to 74. The three goal mar
gin was enough, for both teams
played even through the last
period.

Parker and Buckingham each
scored their second of the game
and Parmely tagged in his third
to bury the gold-diggers.
Stanford now holds a 10-5
record, losing those five by a
total of 6 points.
Frosh Win Squeaker
Foothill's JV's wailed to a 3-0
first quarter lead over the Stan
ford frosh. Hans Dankers and
Neal McMahon scored in the
second quarter, but Foothill
added 3 more to make it 6-2 at
the half.
Freshman team captain Tom
Hill and Dennis Daly made shots
count in the third period as the
frosh shaved the Owl lead to
7-4. Goals by leading scorer
Wayne Wilson and Hill brought
the count to 8-6 with less than
two minutes remaining.
Tucker Stanwood chucked in
a backhand and Wilson powered
a shot past the goalie to tie the
game. With 12 seconds left, Hill
stuck a sweep shot in the upper
corner of the net to win, 9-8.
Owl Foul Maims Wayne
Wilson, who averages four
goals a game, could not play
against Await. His eye was cut

8 stitches worth against Foot
hill.
The game plan against Await
was the same as against Foot
hill — only worse. Hill and Greg
Amondson scored the only goals
for Stanford in the first half.
The Papoose defense harden
ed and Sam Beasley allowed
only one Await shot to get by
him in the entire second half.
The Papoose point-making ma
chine got stuck in high gear.
Hill, Stanwood, and Bob Ab
shear stung Await for four goals
in the third period.
Behind, 7-6, in the fourth quar
ter, the Papooses rested their
case with Tom Hill. Hill aced
the goalie for the fourth, fifth,
and sixth time — the last shot
with seconds remaining to win,
9-8, in the second thriller in a
row.
Jimmie Smith's Papooses now
take a 94 record to Cal next
Friday.
