# Big Game Pranks

### 
This may be the scientific era of James Bond,
two-man orbital flights around the earth, and
computerized learning, but the art of Big Game
pranks is receding into the dark ages of lack
luster imagination, as witnessed by last week's
visit by Cal. Gone are the days when Cal men
had the courage or ingenuity to purloin the axe
or to proclaim to the world that they could best
Big Red.
We can readily understand why the boys at
Berkeley are distraught these days: they have
seen neither victory nor the axe in five years.
But we suggest they use their buckets for their
tears rather than blue paint.
Perhaps the onslaught of activism in the sen

ous 'sixties has dampened Big Game fever
at both campuses and laid dormant that peculiar
virus which drove Stanford's Immortal 21 to
regain the axe and led countless other genera
tions of Stanford men to herald the superiority
of Big Red with swims to Alcatraz and banners
off the Tower of Pisa.
But alas the week is young and Big Game is
still five days off. Perhaps that rare strain of
Doodles Weaver mentality has not vanished
from the campus scene. Come next Monday,
however, we would much prefer to see the Uni
versity maintenance crews massaging over
worked funny bones rather than vestiges of
azure assertions on the walls of campus build
ings.
