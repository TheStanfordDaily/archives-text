## Glover Explains Policy 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
In the November issue of The
Daily, Student Body President
David Harris is quoted as say
ing that the President's Office
had refused to tell him which of
Mr. Harris' appointees had been
accepted.
This is simply not so. I gave
the names of the Harris nomi
nees which had not been ap
proved by the President to Mr.
Tim Haight, Mr. Harris' assis
tant, on Monday, November 7.
The effect of the Student Body
President's position in encourag
ing students to resign from Pres
idential committees is to restrict
student participation in Univer
sity affairs, and this is regret
table.
Since so much has been said
that is inaccurate about the com
mittee appointment procedure,
let me set the record straight:
Mr. Harris made 32 nomina
tions to 11 committees or sub
committees. All but eight of
these nominations were ap
proved. The changes made were
intended to strengthen and
broaden the student representa
tion. As an example, the Presi
dent of the Institute of Interna
tional Relations was named to
the Committee on Foreign Visi
tors and Students.
Each was informed, in Presi
dent Sterling's letter, that they
had not been nominated by Mr.
Harris, and that he had taken
the position that if this were not
the case, they would not be con
sidered ASSU representatives.
Of those so nominated, six
have accepted and two have de
clined. When these vacancies
have been filled, the complete list
will be announced.
I declined to give Mr. Haight
the names of those invited by
the President to serve on com
mittees, although they had not
been nominated by Mr. Harris,
because Dr. Sterling wanted
these students to make up their
minds about acceptance of this
invitation without pressure from
anyone.
FREDREIC O. GLOVER
Executive Assistant
to the President
Editor's note: The November
11 Issue of The Dally Incorrectly
quoted Mr. Harris. Harris re
ported that the Office of the
President had not given him the
names of Dr. Sterling's appoint
ments, rather than refusing the
names of his appointees who had
been accepted.
• Grazie
Edltor, The Daily:
The sympathy and interest
shown by so many persons in
Stanford-in-Florence and on cam
pus for the devastation that has

fallen on my country in the
past few days are indeed great
manifestations of human solidar
ity. In this occasion I would like
to express on the part of all
Italians and myself our sincere
gratitude and admiration.

• Sing Along
Editor, The Dally:
In his speech in White Plaza,
Dave Harris focused the whole
issue of appointments to the
Presidential Advisory Commit
tees on one basic question: Do
Stanford students have a right
of real representation in the de
cision-making mechanisms of
the University? Harris thinks
they certainly do. His actions
with regard to the Presidential
committees reflect nothing but
an honest effort to obtain real
student representation in the
committees. Hi s appointees,
given the full support of LASSU,
are representative.
But the question remains: do
students at Stanford have the
right to a voice in University
decisions that affect their lives?
The principal mode of argument
directed against the affirmation
of this right might be called the
"Grace of God" argument. It
goes something like this: we
are here because Someone let
us come here, and since we
agreed to come here, we must
do all the things that Someone
tells us to. We've heard this
line before.
Harris himself pointed out the
analogy between our situation
here and that of the early Amer
ican colonists. They, too, were
told that their rights to live
in America were granted by
Someone (the king of England,
in this case) who could thereby
make them do whatever he
whimmed. After all, they didn't
have to live in America. If they
didn't like it, they couid break
their "voluntary association"
and go to Spain or hell or wher
ever.
And Stanford students are told
that if they don't like it, they
can transfer to San Jose State.
Power, however, doesn't come
down to us like the Grace of
God. In the colonies, it took
spirit leadership. But more than
that, it took the efforts of
the people. We have the spirited
leadership at Stanford in the
person of our student body presi
dent. What we need is an ex
pression of student support.
Let's get real student representa
tion on the Presidential Advisory
Committees. We can't do it if
we sit back and watch Dave Har
ris do his "song and dance."

• Rejoice, Rejoice
Editor, The Daily:
To our great disappointment
a historical, and for us encour
aging, election has been passed
by with a scarcely a comment.
TTiat election was the first Re
publican governor of Arkansas
in a century, Winthrop Rocke
feller, the choice of the people,
over Jim Johnson, a politician
who tried to exploit race and
religion.
The significance of this elec
tion has several dimensions.
For those concerned about the
lack of debate within the south
ern one-party system, rejoice;
here is an example that the
rigidity is crumbling. For those
liberal Republicans who might
wonder if perhaps racism as re
action to riots effected more
votes in California than in the
southern areas combined, re
joice; one man was elected
under the Republican label in
resistance to that issue. If you
are a person anxious for the
South to turn her back on seg
regation and the type of govern
ment that fosters it, take heart
from this election.
After all, Tuesday was a day
of decision for progress in Ar
kansas, and this decision should
be noticed. FROM ARKANSAS
• Appreciation
Editor, The Dally;
Not wishing to repudiate what
Mr. Keck no doubt considered
an honest and competent criti
cism of The Beaux' Stratgem, I
would like to thank him for his
brief acknowledgement of the
costuming. It was indeed heart
ening to learn that in attempt
ing to capture the silhoutte of
the 1830's (thereby updating the
play from the eighteenth cen
tury), we complimented the "in
tended atmosphere of Elizabeth
an England." GINA SWAIN
• Scandal Sheet
Despite the anticipation with
which members of the Stanford
community awaited Barth's lec
ture and the early unavailability
of tickets, there were vacant
seats in Dinkelspiel. The policy
of distributing tickets to En
glish classes deprived many peo
ple who actually wanted to at
tend the lecture, convincing them
that there would be no seats.
Hopefully this situation will be
remedied in the future.
