# The 						Capitol Scenes
## Something Old, But Not Too Much New 
### Art Buchwald 
Last week we had a chance
to see the "new Johnson" and
the "old Nixon" all within the
period of a few days.
When I turned on my tele
vision to see the President's
press conference on Thursday
morning, I thought I was going
to see the old Johnson — re
laxed, sure of himself and above
politics. But suddenly in answer
to a question about former Vice-
President Nixon, President
Johnson called him a "chronic
campaigner" and said, "He
never did really recognize and
realize what was going on when
he had an official position in the
government..From there on
out he verbally assaulted Nixon
in a way that, according to news
papermen on the scene, even
made Mrs. Johnson blush.
The conclusion was that this
was the "new Johnson" speak
ing, a man who was getting
tired of being told what he
should or should not do in Viet
nam. It was the first time he
publicly attalked a Republican
in such strong language, and
those of us who know the "old
Johnson" were very much in
trigued. We were also curious
to know which Nixon would re
act.
Bather Be Bight
For several years now we've
been treated to the "new Nix
on," a man who puts his party
before his personal ambitions.
A man who has worked harder
for Republican candidates
throughout the land than anyone
else, a man who no longer is
mad at the press and a man who
would, he says, rather be right
than President.
The "new Nixon" immediately
reacted to the "new Johnson"
attack by chuckling and saying
he didn't want to indulge in per
sonalities. "I regret," he said in
a speech in New Hampshire,
"that the President has chosen
to reduce this debate to personal
levels, and I will not travel that
road with him."
It was a great show of re
straint on Nixon's part, and
everywhere I went for the next
few days people kept saying,
"Isn't Nixon a regular new
guy?"
Big Break
But at the same time Johnson
watchers in Washington kept
asking, "Why did President
Johnson suddenly change his
image and give Richard Nixon
his most important break of the
year?" Up until the President's
press conference Nixon was
plodding his way around the
country scarcely getting any
thing he said on page 14 of the
newspapers. Suddenly, thanks to
the "new Johnson," the former
Vice-President became page one
news and they even gave him a
half-hour of time on Sunday
afternoon to speak for the Re
publican Party.
"Maybe," one expert said, "this
is really the 'old Johnson,' pre
tending he is a 'new Johnson.'"

"What do you mean?" I asked
him.
"Perhaps Mr. Johnson wants
to run against Nixon in 1968.
What better way to make Nixon
the candidate than to attack him
personally at a press confer
ence?"
"But won't the 'new Nixon'
be difficult to beat?" I asked.
"Nixon can only remain 'new
Nixon' when he doesn't think
he's got a chance to win the
nomination. As soon as he gets
his hopes up, he'll revert to the
'old Nixon.'"
Old Nixon Returns
"Then President Johnson at
tacked the 'new Nixon' just to
see the 'old Nixon' in action
again?"
"Exactly. That's the way the
'old Johnson' would do it."
Last Sunday I anxiously turn
ed on my TV set and there was
the former Vice-President speak
ing logically and without heat
about the problems that beset
this nation.
For most of the half-hour we
saw the "new Nixon," but in the
final moments the "old Nixon"
of the "Checkers" days re
turned.
He addressed his last words
to the President. "I respect you
for the great energies you de
vote to your office, and my re
spect has not changed because
of the personal attack you made
on me. You see, I can under
stand how a man can be very
tired and how his temper can be
very short."
We don't know what Mr.
Johnson's words were when he
heard Nixon say this, but White
House sources have assured me
that whether it was the "new
Johnson" or the "old Johnson"
speaking, he probably uttered
the same thing.

Johnson called him a "chronic
campaigner" and said, "He
never did really recognize and
realize what was going on when
he had an official position in the
government..From there on
out he verbally assaulted Nixon
in a way that, according to news
papermen on the scene, even
made Mrs. Johnson blush.
The conclusion was that this
was the "new Johnson" speak
ing, a man who was getting
tired of being told what he
should or should not do in Viet
nam. It was the first time he
publicly attalked a Republican
in such strong language, and
those of us who know the "old
Johnson" were very much in
trigued. We were also curious
to know which Nixon would re
act.
Bather Be Bight
For several years now we've
been treated to the "new Nix
on," a man who puts his party
before his personal ambitions.
A man who has worked harder
for Republican candidates
throughout the land than anyone
else, a man who no longer is
mad at the press and a man who
would, he says, rather be right
than President.
The "new Nixon" immediately
reacted to the "new Johnson"
attack by chuckling and saying
he didn't want to indulge in per
sonalities. "I regret," he said in
a speech in New Hampshire,
"that the President has chosen
to reduce this debate to personal
levels, and I will not travel that
road with him."
It was a great show of re
straint on Nixon's part, and
everywhere I went for the next
few days people kept saying,
"Isn't Nixon a regular new
guy?"
Big Break
But at the same time Johnson
watchers in Washington kept
asking, "Why did President
Johnson suddenly change his
image and give Richard Nixon
his most important break of the
year?" Up until the President's
press conference Nixon was
plodding his way around the
country scarcely getting any
thing he said on page 14 of the
newspapers. Suddenly, thanks to
the "new Johnson," the former
Vice-President became page one
news and they even gave him a
half-hour of time on Sunday
afternoon to speak for the Re
publican Party.
"Maybe," one expert said, "this
is really the 'old Johnson,' pre
tending he is a 'new Johnson.'"

"What do you mean?" I asked
him.
"Perhaps Mr. Johnson wants
to run against Nixon in 1968.
What better way to make Nixon
the candidate than to attack him
personally at a press confer
ence?"
"But won't the 'new Nixon'
be difficult to beat?" I asked.
"Nixon can only remain 'new
Nixon' when he doesn't think
he's got a chance to win the
nomination. As soon as he gets
his hopes up, he'll revert to the
'old Nixon.'"
Old Nixon Returns
"Then President Johnson at
tacked the 'new Nixon' just to
see the 'old Nixon' in action
again?"
"Exactly. That's the way the
'old Johnson' would do it."
Last Sunday I anxiously turn
ed on my TV set and there was
the former Vice-President speak
ing logically and without heat
about the problems that beset
this nation.
For most of the half-hour we
saw the "new Nixon," but in the
final moments the "old Nixon"
of the "Checkers" days re
turned.
He addressed his last words
to the President. "I respect you
for the great energies you de
vote to your office, and my re
spect has not changed because
of the personal attack you made
on me. You see, I can under
stand how a man can be very
tired and how his temper can be
very short."
We don't know what Mr.
Johnson's words were when he
heard Nixon say this, but White
House sources have assured me
that whether it was the "new
Johnson" or the "old Johnson"
speaking, he probably uttered
the same thing.
Last week we had a chance
to see the "new Johnson" and
the "old Nixon" all within the
period of a few days.
When I turned on my tele
vision to see the President's
press conference on Thursday
morning, I thought I was going
to see the old Johnson — re
laxed, sure of himself and above
politics. But suddenly in answer
to a question about former Vice-
President Nixon, President
Johnson called him a "chronic

nam. It was the first time he
publicly attalked a Republican
in such strong language, and
those of us who know the "old
Johnson" were very much in
trigued. We were also curious
to know which Nixon would re
act.
Bather Be Bight
For several years now we've
been treated to the "new Nix
on," a man who puts his party
before his personal ambitions.
A man who has worked harder
for Republican candidates
throughout the land than anyone
else, a man who no longer is
mad at the press and a man who
would, he says, rather be right
than President.
The "new Nixon" immediately
reacted to the "new Johnson"
attack by chuckling and saying
he didn't want to indulge in per
sonalities. "I regret," he said in
a speech in New Hampshire,
"that the President has chosen
to reduce this debate to personal
levels, and I will not travel that
road with him."
It was a great show of re
straint on Nixon's part, and
everywhere I went for the next
few days people kept saying,
"Isn't Nixon a regular new
guy?"
Big Break
But at the same time Johnson
watchers in Washington kept
asking, "Why did President
Johnson suddenly change his
image and give Richard Nixon
his most important break of the
year?" Up until the President's
press conference Nixon was
plodding his way around the
country scarcely getting any
thing he said on page 14 of the
newspapers. Suddenly, thanks to
the "new Johnson," the former
Vice-President became page one
news and they even gave him a
half-hour of time on Sunday
afternoon to speak for the Re
publican Party.
"Maybe," one expert said, "this
is really the 'old Johnson,' pre
tending he is a 'new Johnson.'"

"What do you mean?" I asked
him.
"Perhaps Mr. Johnson wants
to run against Nixon in 1968.
What better way to make Nixon
the candidate than to attack him
personally at a press confer
ence?"
"But won't the 'new Nixon'
be difficult to beat?" I asked.
"Nixon can only remain 'new
Nixon' when he doesn't think
he's got a chance to win the
nomination. As soon as he gets
his hopes up, he'll revert to the
'old Nixon.'"
Old Nixon Returns
"Then President Johnson at
tacked the 'new Nixon' just to
see the 'old Nixon' in action
again?"
"Exactly. That's the way the
'old Johnson' would do it."
Last Sunday I anxiously turn
ed on my TV set and there was
the former Vice-President speak
ing logically and without heat
about the problems that beset
this nation.
For most of the half-hour we
saw the "new Nixon," but in the
final moments the "old Nixon"
of the "Checkers" days re
turned.
He addressed his last words
to the President. "I respect you
for the great energies you de
vote to your office, and my re
spect has not changed because
of the personal attack you made
on me. You see, I can under
stand how a man can be very
tired and how his temper can be
very short."
We don't know what Mr.
Johnson's words were when he
heard Nixon say this, but White
House sources have assured me
that whether it was the "new
Johnson" or the "old Johnson"
speaking, he probably uttered
the same thing.
