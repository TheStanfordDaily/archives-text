# Yell Leader, 'Wendy' Highlight Voting
## 
### 
LASSU elections on two issues will
be held November 15 and 16.
Included on the ballot will be run
off elections for head cheerleader.
The two candidates are Bruce Braden
and Craig Brown.
The runoff was necessitated by the
fact that none of the three original
candidates received a majority of
votes In the first election.
Controversy over the Homecoming
Queen issue precipitated a LASSU
resolution which will also be voted
on. The proposition reads: "The Leg
islature proposes that Stanford Uni

versity shall not have a Homecoming
Queen or like institution. Do you
agree or disagree with this proposi
tion?"
The resolution was proposed at last
week's LASSU meeting after the
legislature had defeated a resolution
that the Cardinals' Board turn over
the Homecoming Queen ballots to the
legislature.
Controversy was generated by the
movement to write in Wendy G. Won
ka for Homecoming Queen as a pro
test against the new institution. The
Cardinals' Board refused to count

these votes.
The write-in movement began with
the appearance of the following
anonymous letter in the Halloween
issue of The Daily:
"Stanford, long on the proverbial
edge of greatness, has finally toppled
over and joins Chico State, San Jose
State, and Sam Houston Institute of
Technology.
"What I refer to, gentlemen, is this
homecoming queen crap. The only
effective way to protest this insanity
is a write-in vote for the fairest
woman of them all, Wendy G. Wonka."
