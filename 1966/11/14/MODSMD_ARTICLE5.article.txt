# Harris Explains Stand On Student Representatives
## Beat Cal! 
### BARBARA WARREN 
"The key is not that students
serve on Committees but that the
mass thing called students choose
their own representatives," stated Stu
dent Body President Dave Harris Fri
day noon in White Plaza.
Speaking in an open discussion on
Presidential Advisory Committee ap

pointments, Harris declared that "any
one not appointed by me and approved
by the Legislature will not be con
sidered a student representative." He
explained what was at stake was "not
the practical issue of what comes out
of the committees, the principle of
how it's done."
Harris rejected the assumptions
that to be a student representative
means just being a student, that the
administration knows students better
than students do, and that the final
right to appointment of student rep
resentatives is President Sterling's.
Harris made his position clear saying,
"If we participate, we'll not go as
guests of anybody, but we'll go as rep
resentatives."
No Serious Response
Harris presented his position to Pres
ident Sterling in July. Describing what
happened at that time, Harris said,
"I couldn't find any serious response,
I don't think they thought I meant it,
but I don't feel like I've pulled
something out of a hat."
Harris submitted 32 names as there
were 32 student positions to be filled
on 11 Presidential Advisory Commit
tees and Subcommittees. This action
violated the traditional procedure of
sending approximately double the
number of names as needed.
Harris told the assembled group
that this was the first year applica
tions and interviews had been used
to prepare the nominations. He made
the point that the names had been
approved by LASSU, the only repre
sentative body on campus.
Constituency Not Status
Harris explained his deviation from
the past as an effort to make the posi
tion an indication of constituency,
rather than status. He later com
mented, "We did everything I know of
to make them( the nominees) repre
sentative."
Eight of the 32 nominations were
not approved by President Sterling.
Frederic O. Glover, Executive Assis
tant to President Sterling, in his let
ter to the editor, stated reasons for
the changes in Harris' nominations as
intentions "to strengthen and broaden
the student representation."
Immediate Plans
When questioned about his immed
iate plans, Harris replied, "Wait," and
later indicated he wanted to get to
gether with Sterling's appointees.
Harris mentioned that five out of
the eight had talked to him about the
possibility of resigning while two had
accepted their positions. Glover's let
ter gave a different version of these
statistics, stating that "six have ac
cepted and two have declined."
Harris stipulated there was a pos
sibility of LASSU creating a conflict
in law over the matter of Presidential
Appointments. He also said that de
cisions would not be binding where
the students had not been represented.
Speaking without a microphone,
Harris repeatedly declared, "This is
an open discussion," and urged any
one who disagreed with him to speak
up. The conversation turned quickly
to a general discussion of decision
making in the University.
Colonial Government
Harris compared Stanford under
the control of a president responsible
only to the Board of Trustees to a
colonial government.
Harris equated University decision
making with community decision mak
ing. He postulated that stud en ts
should make the decisions governing
their own lives, because he saw no rea
son why students should not be given
the normal rights of controlling their
lives that exist in the outside world.
A person in the crowd asked Harris,
"What is the difference between the
free community of Palo Alto and
a voluntary association?" The ques
tioner stated "rules here have a dif
ferent meaning." Harris commented
that there still should be rights of
membership.
