# SUBSTITUTE FOR 'PUBLISH OR PERISH'?
## Student Views Should Influence Tenure Posture 
### TIM VIDAL 
The problem of evaluating teachers
and developing criteria for promotion
is an old and complex one. It has
been the topic of innumerable books,
speeches and conferences. Yet de
spite the vociferous criticisms that
have been made against the present
system, no one seems to have come
up with a better one.
Whenever one must evaluate ob
jectively the quality of a person or
of his work, difficulties arise. How
can one determine who deserves an
A- and who a B+? Who really knows
whether one student should be ad
mitted to Stanford and another re
jected? How can a university know
which instructors should be offered
tenure? What are the criteria for de
termining a person's quality and po
tential?
This does not mean that a draw
system for tenure should be estab

lished, nor that the present method
of evaluating teachers is as good as
it might be. Rather, it means that
the problems resulting from the pres
ent system are partially due to the
inherent difficulty involved in any
attempt to evaluate objectively a
human being.
The present method of evaluation
seems to be basically sound. Publica
tion is certainly evidence of the qual
ity of a person's mind, his knowledge
of the subject that he is working
with, his ability to reason, create
and substantiate, and provides con
crete evidence of his work that can
be evaluated by experts in his field
across the nation. But a university
is seeking more than simply intelli
gent people, it is also searching
for good teachers.
One aspect of consideration i'or
tenure that is often criticized is the
infrequency of the use of student

questionaires in evaluating teaching
ability.
"Although student rating has flaws,
it is judged the most effective way to
appraise teaching ability. Con
sistency of ratings are not markedly
influenced by anticipated or awarded
grades or student level."
This statement comes from a re
port given on Dec. 21, 1964 by Robert
R. Hind, Associate Dean of Under
graduate Education. The report fol
lowed an extensive review of litera
ture on student evaluation experi
ments that had been made at various
colleges and universities including
Stanford and Berkeley.
The report also concluded that the
best questionnaires were those that
were faculty origirated, voluntary by
the instructors, unsigned and confi
dential, and carefully planned and
tested before going into use.
Nevertheless, committees at Stan

ford that are evaluating an instructor
for consideration of tenure in the
Humanities and Sciences are not
allowed to use student questionnaires
that may have been given by his
department. Questionnaires have
been tested in several graduate
schools including the school of edu
cation. An instructor may use them
in his favor, but this is considered
by some as an admission of weakness
in research, and rarely done.
A recent study made by the Ameri
can Council on Education strongly
endorsed consideration of carefully
planned student questionnaires. It
noted that over 40 per cent of the
1,100 colleges and universities studied
reported that they considered student
opinion informally, gathered at ran
dom from casual or overheard con
versations. Student questionnaires
were used in slightly over 21 per cent
of the cases.

Some feel student questionnaires
should be given in every course and
should include objective as well as
essay questions in order to obtain
complete and fair evaluations. The
questionnaires should be used by the
teachers to improve their teaching
habits, and by the evaluation commit
tees in determining the teaching abil
ity of the instructor.
Perhaps some students would use
the questionnaires to vent their frus
trations with their grades, but the
group of evaluations when considered
together would probably present a
fair appraisal of the students' impres
sion of the teacher.
The evaluation committees could
then consider it in whatever perspec
tive they wished, but at least they
would have a fair and concrete sam
pling of student opinion. As it is
many teachers rely upon the Course
Review (which offers to students an

"opportunity to engage in mass, con
structive wrath") and random com
ments.
The American Council on Educa
tion study also recommended direct
classroom observation as a means of
evaluating teaching ability. It is gen
erally agreed that this is only pos
sible in a lecture.
Many instructors complain that it
would interfere with their academic
freedom to have members of evalua
tion committees sitting in on their
lectures, but if a person is employed
at least partly for the purposes of
lecturing it seems reasonable for
members of the evaluation committee
to have a first hand knowledge of his
lecturing ability which requires hear
ing him lecture. Committee members
would have to attend more than one
lecture to give the instructor several
opportunities to demonstrate his skill.
