# SUBSTITUTE FOR 'PUBLISH OR PERISH'?
## Student Views Should Influence Tenure Posture 
### TIM VIDAL 
The problem of evaluating teachers
and developing criteria for promotion
is an old and complex one. It has
been the topic of innumerable books,
speeches and conferences. Yet de
spite the vociferous criticisms that
have been made against the present
system, no one seems to have come
up with a better one.
Whenever one must evaluate ob
jectively the quality of a person or
of his work, difficulties arise. How
can one determine who deserves an
A- and who a B+? Who really knows
whether one student should be ad
mitted to Stanford and another re
jected? How can a university know
which instructors should be offered
tenure? What are the criteria for de
termining a person's quality and po
tential?
This does not mean that a draw
system for tenure should be estab

lished, nor that the present method
of evaluating teachers is as good as
it might be. Rather, it means that
the problems resulting from the pres
ent system are partially due to the
inherent difficulty involved in any
attempt to evaluate objectively a
human being.
The present method of evaluation
seems to be basically sound. Publica
tion is certainly evidence of the qual
ity of a person's mind, his knowledge
of the subject that he is working
with, his ability to reason, create
and substantiate, and provides con
crete evidence of his work that can
be evaluated by experts in his field
across the nation. But a university
is seeking more than simply intelli
gent people, it is also searching
for good teachers.
One aspect of consideration i'or
tenure that is often criticized is the
infrequency of the use of student

questionaires in evaluating teaching
ability.
"Although student rating has flaws,
it is judged the most effective way to
appraise teaching ability. Con
sistency of ratings are not markedly
influenced by anticipated or awarded
grades or student level."
This statement comes from a re
port given on Dec. 21, 1964 by Robert
R. Hind, Associate Dean of Under
graduate Education. The report fol
lowed an extensive review of litera
ture on student evaluation experi
ments that had been made at various
colleges and universities including
Stanford and Berkeley.
The report also concluded that the
best questionnaires were those that
were faculty origirated, voluntary by
the instructors, unsigned and confi
dential, and carefully planned and
tested before going into use.
Nevertheless, committees at Stan

ford that are evaluating an instructor
for consideration of tenure in the
Humanities and Sciences are not
allowed to use student questionnaires
that may have been given by his
department. Questionnaires have
been tested in several graduate
schools including the school of edu
cation. An instructor may use them
in his favor, but this is considered
by some as an admission of weakness
in research, and rarely done.
A recent study made by the Ameri
can Council on Education strongly
endorsed consideration of carefully
planned student questionnaires. It
noted that over 40 per cent of the
1,100 colleges and universities studied
reported that they considered student
opinion informally, gathered at ran
dom from casual or overheard con
versations. Student questionnaires
were used in slightly over 21 per cent
of the cases.

Some feel student questionnaires
should be given in every course and
should include objective as well as
essay questions in order to obtain
complete and fair evaluations. The
questionnaires should be used by the
teachers to improve their teaching
habits, and by the evaluation commit
tees in determining the teaching abil
ity of the instructor.
Perhaps some students would use
the questionnaires to vent their frus
trations with their grades, but the
group of evaluations when considered
together would probably present a
fair appraisal of the students' impres
sion of the teacher.
The evaluation committees could
then consider it in whatever perspec
tive they wished, but at least they
would have a fair and concrete sam
pling of student opinion. As it is
many teachers rely upon the Course
Review (which offers to students an

"opportunity to engage in mass, con
structive wrath") and random com
ments.
The American Council on Educa
tion study also recommended direct
classroom observation as a means of
evaluating teaching ability. It is gen
erally agreed that this is only pos
sible in a lecture.
Many instructors complain that it
would interfere with their academic
freedom to have members of evalua
tion committees sitting in on their
lectures, but if a person is employed
at least partly for the purposes of
lecturing it seems reasonable for
members of the evaluation committee
to have a first hand knowledge of his
lecturing ability which requires hear
ing him lecture. Committee members
would have to attend more than one
lecture to give the instructor several
opportunities to demonstrate his skill.
The study reported that the
distribution of grades in a partic
ular class of a multi-section
course employing departmental
examinations can be a signifi
cant indication of teaching abil
ity if the instructors are aware
of the specific educational ob
jectives of the course and if
ability is considered in rating
student performance. Just as
grades are a dubious reflection
of what has been learned, this
seems to me to be a dubious re
flection of what has been taught,
but might have a value in some
cases.
There have been many sug
gestions made by various people
for extending the evaluation pe
riod or distinguishing between
lecturing and research profes
sors, but there are so many com
plications and subtle assump
tions or necessities in the award

ing of tenure that it would re
quire a much deeper study than
has been attempted here to make
any worthwhile comments along
these lines.
However, it seems apparent
that one way in which the pres
ent system could be improved
considerably is to improve the
quality of teaching that goes on
after an instructor receives ten
ure. According to Dr. Leonard
I. Schiff, former Executive Head
of the Physics Department, and
chairman of the Advisory Board
of the Academic Council, "Al
most anyone who has a high
degree of scholarly attainment
in his field and is deeply in
terested in teaching can be a
good teacher."
"The process of becoming a
good teacher," he continued, "can
be expedited by help from more
experienced faculty." He was
specifically referring to the mon
_ itor system in the physics de
partment. Any member of the
faculty in this department can
ask his colleagues to sit in on
his lectures and then offer sug
gestions for improving his pres
entation of the material.
Ironically, often in a univer
sity, it is assumed by instructors
that the material is more im
portant than the method of pres
entation, and by the students
that the method is more impor
tant than the material.
Another improvement could
be an increased awareness of
the type of teaching that a per
son is good at. Some of the pro
fessors that are lecturing under
graduate courses would be far

more effective in seminars, and
vice versa.
In a recent interview Student
Body President Dave Harris sug
gested that students be included
in the evaluation committees,
but the problems presented by
such a move seem to outweigh
the advantages. While student
opinion should definitely play a
more clearly defined role in the
process of evaluation than it
does now, it would be difficult to
find a sufficient number ol un
biased students who knew some
thing of each candidates' field as
weU as being acquainted with
how effective he was in lectures,
seminars and graduate work and
who could also keep everything
that went on in the evaluation
meetings confidential.
The University of California
at Berkeley is considering ways
of improving their method of
evaluating teachers. Recom
mendation One of the Muscatine
Report is now being discussed
by the Academic Senate. This
recommendation suggests ways,
of bringing further concrete evi
dence of an instructor's teach
ing ability and philosophy to the
departmental promotion commit
tees.
At Stanford the method of
evaluating instructors is better
than at many places, and per
haps even Berkeley, but as long
as there continue to be stu
dents complaining of uninspir
ing or incompetent teachers,
and teachers complaining of
"pressures of dubious worth"
there is a need for improve
ment
