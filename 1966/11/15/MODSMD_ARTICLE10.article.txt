# Band, Pom-Pon Girls Rise High On Big Game Spirits
## Lunch Bunch High Note 
### 
The campus was treated to an un
expected concert at noon as the Stan
ford Band mounted now closed Hoo
ver Tower to play fight songs.
The pavement reverberated as the
entire community and maybe even
Cal knew that Big Game week is
here.
Over in the depths of dry Lake
Lagunita, Pacific Gas and Electric
erected the twenty power poles that
will serve as the frame for the bon
fire Friday night. Freshman men
took up stations to guard them as the
long week began.
The football team began to tune up
for the game which at times seems
engulfed by all the other festivities.
A bay area newspaper reported the
odds were better than even that both
teams would show for the game, but
others in a more serious note said
Stanford should go into the game
very strong and the favorite.
The Roble girls have begun their
annual plea for Big Game dates, mak
ing full use of the letters to the edi
tor and the open house hours. Mean

while the sponsors in Roble and
Branner have been holding their ses
sions to tell the girls of Big Game
overnights, the Big Game "dutch
treat," and about terrible old "Oskie."
The Big Game Gaieties,
"AAAUUUGH" opens its three night
stand tomorrow night and tickets are
still available.
Crowds of alumni are also expected
for the game with five classes plan
ning reunions during the weekend.
Tomorrow is "Red and White" day
with a noon trial of Oskie and Foot
ball night with the team eating at the
University residences. Students are
encouraged to wear red and white.
Friday morning early the fresh
man men will begin work on the bon
fire. In the evening, the bonfire will
begin at 6:30 with a giant rally to be
held on the boathouse deck.
This evening at 9 KZSU is broad
casting a special Big Game program,
"Stanford Sadie." The humorous of
fering is a rebroadcast of a KZSU
classic first aired in 1958. The broad
cast will be heard on AM only.
