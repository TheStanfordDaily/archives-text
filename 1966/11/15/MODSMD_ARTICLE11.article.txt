# Harvard Boosts Tuition To Combat Rising Costs
## 
### 
The tuition at Harvard College
will be raised next year to
$2,000. Since 1964, tuition has
been $1,760.
The increase will affect Rad
cliffe College, the Harvard Grad
uate School of Arts and Sci
ences, the Graduate School of
Education, and the John F. Ken
nedy School of Government.
The tuition rise brings Har
vard's central group of Faculties
into line with tuition costs at
other Ivy League and similar
private universities.
The Faculty of Arts and Sci

ences, which teaches both the
undergraduates of Harvard and
Radcliffe and graduate students,
faces a deficit at the end of this
year. Dean Franklin L. Ford
noted that, as costs continue to
rise, tuition has been supplying
a smaller share of educational
costs. Traditionally, tuition has
provided about 50 per cent of tho
income of the college (exclusive
of government grants). This
year, it provides only 44 per cent.
The new tuition increase will
bring the figure back to about.
50 per cent.
