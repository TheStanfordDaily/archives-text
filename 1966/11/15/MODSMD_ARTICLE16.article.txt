# Otto And Crane Tie Record In Otherwise Dreary Play
## 
### 
The WCCL saw little action
during the past midterm period.
Seven casino games were played
as Crane and Otto split the series
three wins for Crane, four for
Otto.
Otto won the first three games
m a row. This included two
games won 58 to 41 which tied
the record score in a single
game (previously held by the
Crane). The three game winning
streak was cut short by Crane's
victory of 58 to 30, a:; the record
was tied again.
Crane went on to win two
more games, 50 tr 38 and 53 to
35. Bounding bac' Otto won the
last game 53 to 46 in a tight
g&me which was decided by the
last hand.
TAt the end of this series,
Otto had gained one game to put

him behind in total games, 127
to 121. Even with the two record
tying scores and the extra win,
Otto gave up five total points.
His lead is down to only 227
points after 248 games.
Recently there have been no
long scoring trends set by
either player. Whereas previous
ly it was not uncommon to see

a five to ten game winning
streak, during the past ten
months only the Otto has had
a streak which was longer than
four games.
Now that the high point rec
ord has been tied for the sixth
time, it appears that the maxi
mum of 60 points is in the near
future.
