• High Priority.
Editor, the Daily:
I should like to express my
concern over the views expres
sed in justifying publication as
a primary criterion for the se
lection of faculty.
No one could reasonably dis
regard the relevance of high
quality publications as a con
sideration in the selection of
faculty. The issue, rather, is one
of priorities — what weight is
to be given to these formal
scholarly achievements relative
to less tangible qualities such as
teaching ability?
Some of the reasons present
ed for making publications the
preeminent consideration to me
seem rather cynical. Professor
Kaplan, for example, argues

that graduate students want to
work for a scholar, not simply
a great classroom teacher, be
cause by associating with these
prestigious scholars they are
more likely to secure the type
of job and position they desire.
The primary purpose of an in
stitution such as Stanford, how
ever, should not so much be to
groom its students for presti
gious positions as to prepare
them so that they will lend pres
tige to whatever position they
fill. Professor Kaplan, I think,
is putting the cart before the
horse in stressing the scholar's
importance in lending prestige
rather than transmitting
knowledge.
Dean Sears and Dean Whit
aker, on the other hand, seem to
be arguing that scholarship
should be weighted more heav
ily than teaching because it is
more easy to evaluate. One may
agree without concluding that
this difficulty in evaluation is
insurmountable. I suspect that
as much unanimity could be
reached on the quality of a
teacher as on the quality of a
scholar. The problem is not so
much in reaching valid evalua
tions as in deciding what value
to place on such evaluations.
There is no insurmountable dif
ficulty in selecting good teach
ers, but one has to seek them
first.
My argument, then, is for the
importance of teaching as a cen

tral aim of the University, an
aim that is quite compatable
with and indeed dependent on a
community of scholars, but
which does "not stress the func
tion of these scholars in pro
ducing publications at the ex
pense of teaching. Although
none of the deans or faculty
members emphasizing the im
portance of publications have
argued that this activity should
take precedence over teaching,
I sense the implication that they
value it more highly — and that
this judgement is in fact deter
mining the shape of our educa
tional community. With this I
take issue.

• Starting Point
Editor, The Daily:
Professor John Kaplan has
stated (Daily, November 10):
"Experience has shown that men
who do not publish and are
promoted solely for their bril
liant classroom teaching ability
are usually either ignored or
looked down upon by the grad
uate students who are looking
for people whose recommenda
tions will have some influence
across the nation."
Is the Professor being repre
sentative? His brilliant teachers
seem overcome by modesty and
his graduate students consumed
by ambition. I cannot believe
this resembles the real world, or

even the School of Law. If a
man is a brilliant teacher and
publishes too, then so much the
better. Probably the very best do
fall into this category. But there
are far too few "real" teachers
around to consider throwing
any away whether they pub
lish or not; they can contribute
at both undergraduate and grad
uate level.
As for the problem of evaluat
ing a teacher: how do we rec
ognize a "real" teacher when we
find one? Dean Robert Sears
(same Daily article) says he
doesn't know, and rules are cer
tainly hard to come by. But how
about a basic one to start off
with? "A real teacher inspires
his students to search for more
substantial things than influen
tial recommendations."
