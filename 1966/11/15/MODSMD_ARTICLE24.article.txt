# Voice From A Submarine In The Midst Of Nowhere
## 
### 
There were once eighty Ameri
can students who lived in a
yellow submarine in the Middle
of Nowhere in a country called
marine, and at their arrival their
key factor had been 100 per cent.
But after a few weeks they be
gan to ask, "Why are we here?
Everyday we must get up, go
to class, eat lunch, study our
books, eat dinner, study some
more, and go to bed. Is that why
we have come so far: to do
exactly as we are supposed to do
at home?"
To that, the little boy full of
wisdom, whose ofiice was right
next door to that of the Captain
of the yellow submarine, replied,
"Go out and meet the people."

So a few students went out
and met the people of the Middle
of Nowhere and came back and
said they were interesting and
nice. Other students packed their
bags and travelled north to a big
city named Vienna, where they
bought knickers, spoke German,
and found that they actually
liked Baroque art.
Redeeoration
One day at lunch a student
said, "I now see that the world
outside the yellow submarine is
different than inside. Even the
Middle of Nowhere, where tour
ists outnumber the citizens, is
different than inside the sub
marine. Outside, people don't al
ways dress up for dinner and
talk in low voices. People out
side laugh and sing, play foot
ball on the grass, and make new
friends." With this, the student
stood up, threw off his tie, and
climbed through the window of
the yellow submarine to pick
flowers.
Other students said, "Let us
make the yellow submarine like
the outside world, and then we
can all live here and be happy."
And so it came to pass. The
students built a room in the
basement where they could talk
and drink beer, where they could
not be watched by the bald
headed man in the tuxedo. And
they played football on the grass
right outside the yellow sub
marine. The students threw wa
ter balloons at each other from
their windows, and the inhabi
tants of the Middle of Nowhere
stopped and laughed as they
walked by. It was the first time
they had dared to laugh near
the yellow submarine.
But this happy state did not
last long. For the Captain of
the yellow submarine closed the
rooms in the basement; the staff
of the yellow submarine took
away the football and told the
students throwing water bal
loons and laughing that they
were worse than the barbarians
from the Eastern plains.
Final Words
On the last night before they
were to leave the yellow sub
marine, the Captain spoke to
the students. He spoke in Ger
man, so that nobody would un
derstand what he had to say.
"You have refused to accept the
real world, which is that of the
yellow submarine," he said. "The
world of laughter and singing
and dancing is foreign to this
land, though common in the land
from which you all have come.
You have tried to make Austria
and the Yellow Submarine like
the land from which you came,
and for that reason you have
not learned and were unhappy."
The few student who under
stood him wept in pity of the
Captain's ignorance. Other stu
dents shouted, "Sink the yellow
submarine!" and threw things
down the elevator shaft and into
the streets. But most of the stu
dents simply packed their bags
and one by one slowly left to
return to the golden land from
which they had come. As they
left, they were both happy and
sad. Happy to leave forever
the yellow submarine, but sad,
so sad, to leave beloved Aus
tria, and even sad to leave the
Middle of Nowhere.
