# Donner: Non-Conformity Inspires Spying In The Modern University
## 
### 
"The attitude of the FBI toward
universities is that student political
consciousness is based on a Com
munist plot," stated lawyer Frank
Donner at Dinkelspiel yesterday.
"The surveillance-informing system
has become rooted in universities for
one simple reason—the emergence of
strong currents of political dissent and
non-conformity among students."

Government surveillance is deeply
destructive of the freedoms of speech
and assembly. "There is a mocking
gap," he added, "between the govern
ment's professions of freedom and its
actual practice."
The nation-wide spread of investiga
tory activity by the FBI, HUAC, CIA
and ultra-right-wing groups seriously
blights the heart processes of democ

racy. "The systematic expansion of
these secret practices represents an
effort to insure conformity without
seeming to."
Donner noted that surveillance and
informing have become "as American
as Coca-Cola and apple pie." He called
FBI investigation of individuals' past
and present associations "common
place."
Denial Of Rights
Legislative restraints on freedom
are not as dangerous as the investi
gative processes that accompany them.
The techniques of intimidation pro
duce fear and anxiety; further, the in
dividual is prejudged and denied his
rights to self-defense and judicial
review. Thus "the general effect is a
maximum return of repression for a
minimum investment of power."
The FBI investigation is preventive
—based on attempts to ferret out "the
kind of people who might at some
time in the future participate in
some activity that might be illegal."
The right to free political association
is thus irreparably damaged by the
fact that a person's past may at some
future date be used against him.
Turning to specific instances of sur
veillance on the college campus, Don
ner noted that investigation, while
shrinking in scope among adults, is
greatly expanding among students.
Many of the larger or urban cam
puses, he noted, have permanent FBI
agents assigned to them posing as
students. Besides these, there are field
agents who check in on the less active
campuses from time to time.
Administrative Collaboration
Donner gave examples of tailing,
intimidation, opening mail, infiltra
tion of organizations by informers,

and other activities among not only
"campus radicals" but also those as
sociated with them. Most of these re
lated to what seemed to be the biggest
problem on the campus—administra
tive collaboration with the FBI.
The role of university administra
tions, he said, ranges from regarding
themselves as a branch of the secur
ity establishment to outright refusal
to cooperate. In many instances uni
versity administrations turn over po
litical material about individuals to
the FBI and even helping secret in
vestigations.
He emphasized that informers were
more important even than the full
time government agents. They are in
dispensable to the policing of thought,
speech, and association. He illustrated
this by comparing it to a physical
crime. These, he noted, can be de
tected by the act itself and the traces
it leaves. A deviation from standards
in speech or "subversive" thinking,
on the other hand, leave no trace;
informers are thus needed to es
mittod.
Informers Are Important
Informers, he maintained, are more
than mere suppliers of information;
they are enlisted for the purpose of
falsely professing sympathy with an
organization in order to betray it.
The FBI and other agencies "poison
relations of trust which must prevail
between a university and students,
professors and students, students and
students.
"Many rightist students are experts
as this business of informing. Others
are encouraged to spy on their fel
low students if they feel their life
or career might be 'blighted' by past
membership in controversial organiza
tions."

intimidation, opening mail, infiltra
tion of organizations by informers,

and other activities among not only
"campus radicals" but also those as
sociated with them. Most of these re
lated to what seemed to be the biggest
problem on the campus—administra
tive collaboration with the FBI.
The role of university administra
tions, he said, ranges from regarding
themselves as a branch of the secur
ity establishment to outright refusal
to cooperate. In many instances uni
versity administrations turn over po
litical material about individuals to
the FBI and even helping secret in
vestigations.
He emphasized that informers were
more important even than the full
time government agents. They are in
dispensable to the policing of thought,
speech, and association. He illustrated
this by comparing it to a physical
crime. These, he noted, can be de
tected by the act itself and the traces
it leaves. A deviation from standards
in speech or "subversive" thinking,
on the other hand, leave no trace;
informers are thus needed to es
mittod.
Informers Are Important
Informers, he maintained, are more
than mere suppliers of information;
they are enlisted for the purpose of
falsely professing sympathy with an
organization in order to betray it.
The FBI and other agencies "poison
relations of trust which must prevail
between a university and students,
professors and students, students and
students.
"Many rightist students are experts
as this business of informing. Others
are encouraged to spy on their fel
low students if they feel their life
or career might be 'blighted' by past
membership in controversial organiza
tions."
"The attitude of the FBI toward
universities is that student political
consciousness is based on a Com
munist plot," stated lawyer Frank
Donner at Dinkelspiel yesterday.
"The surveillance-informing system
has become rooted in universities for
one simple reason—the emergence of
strong currents of political dissent and
non-conformity among students."

Government surveillance is deeply
destructive of the freedoms of speech
and assembly. "There is a mocking
gap," he added, "between the govern
ment's professions of freedom and its
actual practice."
The nation-wide spread of investiga
tory activity by the FBI, HUAC, CIA
and ultra-right-wing groups seriously
blights the heart processes of democ

racy. "The systematic expansion of
these secret practices represents an
effort to insure conformity without
seeming to."
Donner noted that surveillance and
informing have become "as American
as Coca-Cola and apple pie." He called
FBI investigation of individuals' past
and present associations "common
place."
Denial Of Rights
Legislative restraints on freedom
are not as dangerous as the investi
gative processes that accompany them.
The techniques of intimidation pro
duce fear and anxiety; further, the in
dividual is prejudged and denied his
rights to self-defense and judicial
review. Thus "the general effect is a
maximum return of repression for a
minimum investment of power."
The FBI investigation is preventive
—based on attempts to ferret out "the
kind of people who might at some
time in the future participate in
some activity that might be illegal."
The right to free political association
is thus irreparably damaged by the
fact that a person's past may at some
future date be used against him.
Turning to specific instances of sur
veillance on the college campus, Don
ner noted that investigation, while
shrinking in scope among adults, is
greatly expanding among students.
Many of the larger or urban cam
puses, he noted, have permanent FBI
agents assigned to them posing as
students. Besides these, there are field
agents who check in on the less active
campuses from time to time.
Administrative Collaboration
Donner gave examples of tailing,
intimidation, opening mail, infiltra
tion of organizations by informers,

and other activities among not only
"campus radicals" but also those as
sociated with them. Most of these re
lated to what seemed to be the biggest
