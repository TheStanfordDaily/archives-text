# NSA Plans Fast For Civil Liberty
## 
### 
A Fast for Freedom will be held
Thursday night in Cubberley Auditor
ium. Sponsored by the National Stu
dent Association, the demonstration
has been planned to occur simulta
neously throughout the country.
Students will gather at the auditor
ium at dinner time and forego their
evening meal.
They are invited to contribute the
money they save by fasting to the
NSA, which will use it to support food
distribution programs and to assist
self-help co-operatives in the South.
Speaking during the Fast will be
Robert McAfee Brown, Professor of
Religion; Dave Harris, ASSU Presi
dent, and Chris Wilson, senior. All
three have worked with the civil
rights movement in Mississippi, and
will hold a discussion on civil rights.
Mark Edleson, Stanford NSA co
ordinator, believes the Fast will stress
"the new importance of economic in
timidation. The question of equal
rights is more than simply passing
laws against racial discrimination. It
has economic implications as well."
