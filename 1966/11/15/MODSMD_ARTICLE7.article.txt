# STUDENTS ABROAD
## Going European Next Summer? 
### 
An introduction to the Student
Abroad Program, which enables stu
dents to live with European families
during the summer, will be presented
Thursday at 4 p.m. in the Tresidder
upstairs lounge. Jean-Louis Baudoin,
European Director of the program
will speak.
Formerly under the auspices of
People-to-People, the Student Abroad
Program is now under the adminis
tration of Educational Travel, Inc., the
travel department of the United
States National Student Association.

Last summer students attended a
three-day orientation session in Wash
ington, D.C., where they met with
U.S. educators and government of
ficials, before departing for a Euro
pean reception in Brussels, Belgium.
After leaving Brussels they proceeded
to different areas of Europe where
their homestays and various other ac
tivities were planned.
Students Abroad members then
stayed with each of three families for
a week in three different cities of the
area they had chosen. They also at

tended conferences discussing various
European and international problems.
The area programs enable students
to spend about a month in either
Belgium-France, Greece, Scandinavia,
Germany, the British Isles, or Yugo
slavia. The remainder of the summer
was free for independent travel. Thus,
members of the program were able to
combine close personal contact with
a foreign culture with the advantages
of free and independent travel.
The only language requirement was
a conversational ability in Gorman or
French for those students who elected
to participate in the Germany or the
Belgium-France Program.
The Student Abroad Program seeks
to promote international understand
ing through close personal contact
with individuals of a foreign culture.
Such personal contact with outstand
ing people in a foreign country is
often very difficult to obtain when a
student is making the "grand tour"
of Europe. The Student Abroad Pro
gram attempts to bridge this gap,
especially for the person who is going
to Europe for the first time, or who
is visiting a country or area where
he has no friends or acquaintances.
