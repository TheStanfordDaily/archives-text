# Lytton Art Exhibit Opens; California Works Shown
## 
### 
The Stanford Museum is the first
stop of a traveling exhibition of mod
ern art from the Lytton collection.
Entitled "Contemporary California
Art from the Lytton Collection," the
exhibition contains 60 works by 46
California painters and sculptors. In
addition, it includes 18 works by
artists in other parts of this country
and the world.
The collection, which usually adorns
the statewide offices of Lytton Sav
ings and Loan Association, was gath
ered by the company president, Bart
Lytton. It is considered by many art
critics to be the most significant and
complete cross-section ever assembled
by a private corporation.
The exhibit stated yesterday and
will run through December 4. It can
be seen without charge at the museum
from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays and
1 p.m. to 5 p.m. Saturdays and Sun
days.
Art Part Of Business
Lytton, who considers art an in
tergal part of his business, has said,
"Art nurtures our soul, lifts our spirit
and, we think, makes us special in a

wonderful wayâ€”a rollicking, lusty,
participating, even creative way."
Noting that support of art is also
good business, he observes, "We tend
to find exciting and useful ways to
make money."
Lytton, emphasizing the work of
living artists, says,"The role of selec
tively preserving the past to give us
a better understanding of the present
*s more properly played by the mu
seum. Living industries' principal chal
lenge should be to support living art
ists in order to encourage creative
output now and for the future."
Sculpture
Focal point of the exhibition is Jack
Zajac's "Deposition," a 48-inch high,
86-inch long bronze sculpture of a life
less human form. Other artists rep
resented include Moore, Braques,
Jawlensky, Soulages, and Wotruba.
Nathan Oliveira of the Stanford art
faculty, and sculptor Arnoldo Pomo
doro of Milan, Italy, who is this year's
artist -in - residence, also have their
works displayed.
