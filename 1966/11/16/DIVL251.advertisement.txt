: A New Value, Face
i y
" r By DON PATTERSON
1 The Bart Lytton Collection at the Stanford Museum, through De
' t'ember 4.
, In front, as you travel stairways,
I hunk-gray folds of cast iron
I plowshare and winged in flight:
beauty born in Lady Remington by
Peter Voulkos.
On black, ordinary ground of a
r thwart against the brazen village:
On black, ordinary blocks:
? thwart against the wise and aged.
Commissioned by Lytton, collector of
. monies and art of the land, see
the: new faces for our hours.
Old Leland reborn and Jane crying.
Sieze the freedom of aesthetic ages
past and present. Journey with me.
t Children in tall grass, 1961; Oil on
? canvas streaked upstairs and east,
t Form of blue grass of multifoliate
glass: undone kin and last echoes of
t grasses blown full to face our free.
Nathan Oliveira, you may meet him anytime.
Sleeping woman, wheat in straw mats left
vacant as undone, unwon art of ages.
Seat of all shadows bereft, unkempt.
1 Women and tables cast by Wonner dripped
hastily, formed lastly and torn
1 in its birth by blue green, horizoned
1 table of seething pain to hunger.
Robert Frame, Coast Terraine.
All here on one circled out of its
square proportions, structured
in dreams of death's other bits,
by luck cured in revolutions. WHiere?
Jones Umber next to Barbara or Stinton's
Foothills: all oil of California,
the land of the keeper of dreams
changing rust of signature-posted
events that shape arts aria and destiny.
Finch: curious carnivorous yellow courage
to bleed blacks and yellows on this
night of masonite. Fire to seven
Suburbia's enchanted self-giving
self. Cast well formed, shape
within creation of destruction.
Acropolis 11, William; house of Moor.
Expanding down the sap of sad
Civilizations within sounds' shape.
Boyle's boils on bird feathers. See the:
point of sound, circle and line.
Smell the joint, trickle and smell
of the room in which he painted.
There is blue wire beyond.
Adam's untitled. Best, of most there.
Knowing the seeing of set and all
sun's trees of forest green,
ferns wild and the fire creating
while still cheating.
Zajac Genius Ram's Head (no organ here);
this is Stanford seen as it is.
Holes of Henry Moore! Standing man
cast bronze, trigrammed union of all
self oil cannot dimension out
of existence of nature. Yew, yes and
terrible still wonder of nature's body
seen again and again. Lit behind, the
attn: of the traveler, the occasional boy.
Summer Bernard, you Rosenthal, chief of light
born in darkness of the night,
Cast in shadow peeling bright:
Wonder cast of Welded Steel,
the sounds of bells now unpealed. See It.
Back room, now. Travel sideways. Miss the:
wonder of the centre, the synthesis of the
Shadow and the Light. Wait for it It
comes upon you as the title piece. Nature
abstracted to neuter form. Love of space by
beauty born, free of form yet still.
Silence Manned by Anguish. Zajac still
the genius of Deposition surpasses any
holes of holy Henry Moore before and ever.
This one, title, date and time unmattered.
He cried on the block of Germany, Poland
and the America he knew to be. Stillness
molded his absence from himself: untold
Deposition! Sorrow, unheard song, unwanted
creation. Love this man whole in his form.
Boy and Girl makes four. Still, sure.
Sarah or Job, shape and cast of this
one called Chadwick and her song.
At last the English tradition of least
standing pair, the boy the air; the girl
the ground. Love this one, for it is you.
And Rosenthal again. His spirit is not of
Stanford but of Lytton. 1961 blown rose
to death and '63. Blown rose blown
brown and walled white: display (like the
whole exhibit) of care of centuries
of close attention to Shape, Cast,
Oil and Bronze.
Horfuchi, Chinese, wishing to be admitted,
Casein and rice paper collage of best
in pieces of food tuned poetry turned
all the art of their, our civilizations.
Best of 111 Oil, without dimension within
his own dimension: Shelgrove's Allston,
at night of view of night sounds and color.
It could be Stanford, seeing grounds of
retention, this Lytton-collected master
piece of the art of California. Where
is, in every turn, this mad synthesis of
music, form, solids, words and motion?
