# Performing Arts Need Dollar Help
## 
### WILLIAM GROVER 
The performing arts in this
country are going to need more
and more dollar help to survive,
a team of economists reported
yesterday.
The reason: all of them —mu-
sic, drama, dance and opera—
are "Beyond the reach of th e
efficiency expert" in a souped-up
technological civilization.
"Human ingenuity has de
vised ways to reduce the labor
necessary to produce an auto
mobile," it was pointed out,
"But no one has succeeded in
decreasing the human effort ex
pended at a live performance

of a 45-minute Schubert quar
tet."
Attention focuses on the sur
vey as the most comprehensive,
detailed business appraisal ever
made in the national arts field.
Based on three years of ex
tensive research, the study by
the Twentieth Century Fund es
timates that a present "income
gap" of between $20 and $23
million for professional activi
ties will grow to $60 million by.
1975.
Income gap was defined as
the difference between expendi
tures and receipts, which has to
be overcome via private, corpor
ate and governmental contribu
tions.
Hopeful Note
"Viewed in the context of the
total economy," a hopeful note
was struck, "the net deficits are
small. The sums needed are by
no means beyond the capabili
ties of a wealthy and expanding
economy and energetic individ
uals dedicated to the welfare of
the arts."
"Now that it has been done,
I can understand why it wasn't
done before," says William G.
Bowen of the monumental ana
lytic task. Bowen and William
J. Baumol, both Princeton Univ
ersity professors, are co-authors
of the 582-page digest of field
findings.
The sponsoring Twentieth
Century Fund is a private re
search organization.
In Tandem
The study was launched in
tandem with an investigation by
the Rockefeller Brothers Fund,
completed 18 months ago, which
concentrated on the aesthetic
values and growth prospects of
performing arts in the United
States.
The Baumol-Bowen reports
concern only professional work
in live performance. Excluded
are amateur activities and the
mass entertainment efforts of
the radio, television, film and
record industries.

The performing arts in this
country are going to need more
and more dollar help to survive,
a team of economists reported
yesterday.
The reason: all of them —mu-
sic, drama, dance and opera—
are "Beyond the reach of th e
efficiency expert" in a souped-up
technological civilization.
"Human ingenuity has de
vised ways to reduce the labor
necessary to produce an auto
mobile," it was pointed out,
"But no one has succeeded in
decreasing the human effort ex
pended at a live performance

of a 45-minute Schubert quar
tet."
Attention focuses on the sur
vey as the most comprehensive,
detailed business appraisal ever
made in the national arts field.
Based on three years of ex
tensive research, the study by
the Twentieth Century Fund es
timates that a present "income
gap" of between $20 and $23
million for professional activi
ties will grow to $60 million by.
1975.
Income gap was defined as
the difference between expendi
tures and receipts, which has to
be overcome via private, corpor
ate and governmental contribu
tions.
Hopeful Note
"Viewed in the context of the
total economy," a hopeful note
was struck, "the net deficits are
small. The sums needed are by
no means beyond the capabili
ties of a wealthy and expanding
economy and energetic individ
uals dedicated to the welfare of
the arts."
"Now that it has been done,
I can understand why it wasn't
done before," says William G.
Bowen of the monumental ana
lytic task. Bowen and William
J. Baumol, both Princeton Univ
ersity professors, are co-authors
of the 582-page digest of field
findings.
The sponsoring Twentieth
Century Fund is a private re
search organization.
In Tandem
The study was launched in
tandem with an investigation by
the Rockefeller Brothers Fund,
completed 18 months ago, which
concentrated on the aesthetic
values and growth prospects of
performing arts in the United
States.
The Baumol-Bowen reports
concern only professional work
in live performance. Excluded
are amateur activities and the
mass entertainment efforts of
the radio, television, film and
record industries.
