• Students Fight Police
PROVIDENCE, R. 1., —A dozen stu

tempt to reach Wheeler.
After police cleared the hall, more

an "extension" of Communist aggres

been imposed upon the (Vietnamese)
peoples for 20 years."

ment building with negotiating teams
at their sides. Notable absentee:
chancellor Konrad Adenauer.

in hiding here since late 1959, was ex
tradited to Bonn last night to stand
trial for the alleged mass murder of

brother's kidney was transplanted to
her.

year. On Oct. 8, 1965, he underwent 2
hours and 15 minutes of surgery for

ney stone.
