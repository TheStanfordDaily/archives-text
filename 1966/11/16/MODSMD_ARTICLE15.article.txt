# Black Orpheus Termed Excellent Film

Black Orpheus and Mandrag<
ola are presently playing at the
Guild theater in Menlo Park.
Black Orpheus is an excellent
film. It takes the legend of
Orpheus and Eurydice and trans
plants it to modern day Rio de
Janeiro during the Mardi Gras.
The legend is well translated
into modern terms.
It would be well to review the
section of Ovid that deals with
Orpheus before seeing the film
for while many of the transla
tions are disturbingly obvious
others are quite subtle.
The presence of the small boys
in the film, for example, is ac
counted for by the fact that
after the original Orpheus lost
Eurydice for the second time,
he "preferred to center his af
fections on boys of tender years,
and to enjoy the brief spring
and early flowering of their
youth . .
Lurking Death
The presence of decadence in
the film is overwhelming. Wher
ever there is beauty there is
also ugliness. The carnival it
self is one last fling of sin be
fore Lent. The dancers look very
attractive from a distance but
as the camera moves closer it
picks out the sweat and the soil.
Then one notices the costumes
themselves and realizes that the
oppressed are dressed up as
their oppressors. And perhaps
one remembers the old man

who must beg for food because
he has spent all his earnings on
his costume. It is not by chance
that Orpheus is from the Baby
lonia district.
Both the costume character
death and real death are al
ways nearby, casting their pall
over the proceedings. This too
is present in Ovid. As Orpheus

says to the gods of the under
world, "We are mortals and all
that is ours are fated to fall to
you, and after a little time, soon
er or later, we hasten to this one
abode."
Only Love Eternal
The key to the film may be
found in the songs that Orpheus

sings. When he sings that happi
ness lasts for only a moment,
the words are not idle verse.
Against the decay are set the
beautiful harbor of Rio, Sugar
loaf, and Corcovado peak, and
the rising sun. These appear to
be things of eternal beauty but
we find that these hinge on
Orpheus' presence. It is his

singing that makes the sun rise.
(Here, of course, there is a con
flict, for the sun would rise even
if Orpheus did not sing but
without Orpheus to observe its
beauty perhaps it would cease to
be beautiful.)
Perhaps the only thing then
that is actually eternal is love
and the capacity for love.
