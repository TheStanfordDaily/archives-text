# Proust's Letters Powerful
## 
### BRUCE MERRY 
letters of Marcel Proust trans
lated and edited by Mina Cur
tiss (Vintage Books), $1.95.
This selection of Proust's let
ters is a powerful and fasci
nating book. The translator slips
behind an unpretentious render
ing, content to unmask for the
general reader a little more of
the arcane magic of Proust's
genius.
Not only is her academic in
tegrity irreproachable; her re
search in Paris and amongst
Proust's surviving acquaint -
ances in the late '40's fully en
titles her to the choice of letters
which she makes. She offers a
brief and sensative summary of
Proust's relationship with each
new correspondent that is in
troduced and sorts out his let
ters to them so that they stand
in chronological order as a sin
gle continuous commentary on
the novelist's mind and work.
She adds —always welcome—
an index and provides useful
notes with page-reference at the
back of the collection. There is
a workmanlike introduction by
Harry Levin which one could
recommend without misgivings
to anyone who has not yet
opened Proust.
Love For Mother
The early letters show Proust
as an ambitious and enter
taining member of French so
ciety. We watch his passion for
Ruskin develop and flower in
the painstaking translation of
Sesame and Lilies.
Three previously unpublished
letters to his mother confirm

what we know of Proust's for
midable love for her. Letters
thanking friends for their sym
pathy at her death provide us
with a further key to the nar
rator's towering description of
his grandmother's destruction
by old age in the novel.
As weakness and disease
gradually overhaul him, his let
ters begin to groan with fatigue
and exhaustion. He takes in
jections of caffeine so as to fin
ish a letter, scribbling page
after page on his knees in bed.
We watch the relentless involve
ment with French literary jour
nalism, and witness the care
which he devoted to every last
detail in his newspaper articles.
Gide Misjudged Him
In a letter to princess Bibesco
of 1912 he encloses a declaration
of great significance, for it
shows that the style and tech
nique of the whole work was
already in his mind before
Swann's Way had struggled into
print a year or two later: "A
sensation, however disinterested
it may be, a perfume, a ray of
light, if they are there, are still
too much in my power to make
me happy. It is when they bring
back to my mind some other
sensation, when I savor them
between the present and the
past, that they do so."
Turn to p. 259, to the thrilling
and famous letter by Andre
Gide in which he apologises
bitterly for having misjudged
Proust's early notebooks and re
jected Swann's Way for the
Nouville Revue Franealse, of
which he was a founder and di

rector: "I thought of you, shall
I confess it, as a snob, a man of
the world and a dilettante—the
worst possible thing for our re
view."
Perhaps Proust's closest cor
respondent, the only friend with
whom he never had a serious
quarrel, was Emile Straus, who,
in her youth, had married an
unknown composer called Bizet.
The rich and voluminous ex
change between Proust and
Straus is the high mark of Miss
Curtiss' eclectic edition. A letter
of hers from 1921 thanks him
for having sent the "daring and
magnificent book", his Guer
mantes volumes, where the
Duchess Oriane is largely based
on the elegance, refinement and
wit of Bizet's widow.
Sickness Sensitizes
"Sickness sensitizes man for
observation" — wrote the Gon
courts, a generation before
Proust proved this formula stu
pendously and for all time. A
few days before his death, still
feverishly writing letters, scrib
bling notes and correcting
proofs, he sends a page of his
"hideous and illegible handwrit
ing" to Vettard. He says that
his novel has perhaps been "like
a telescope which is pointed at
time."
Deep within the novel Proust
had said that real books must
be children not of broad day
light and small-talk, but of dark
ness and silence. With her ad
mirable selection from his let
ters, Miss Curtiss has thrown a
little more light on the un
fathomable penumbra from
which this century's greatest
novel emerged.

letters of Marcel Proust trans
lated and edited by Mina Cur

This selection of Proust's let
ters is a powerful and fasci
nating book. The translator slips
behind an unpretentious render
ing, content to unmask for the
general reader a little more of
the arcane magic of Proust's
genius.
Not only is her academic in
tegrity irreproachable; her re
search in Paris and amongst
Proust's surviving acquaint -
ances in the late '40's fully en
titles her to the choice of letters
which she makes. She offers a
brief and sensative summary of
Proust's relationship with each
new correspondent that is in
troduced and sorts out his let
ters to them so that they stand
in chronological order as a sin
gle continuous commentary on
the novelist's mind and work.
She adds —always welcome—
an index and provides useful
notes with page-reference at the
back of the collection. There is
a workmanlike introduction by
Harry Levin which one could
recommend without misgivings
to anyone who has not yet
opened Proust.
Love For Mother
The early letters show Proust
as an ambitious and enter
taining member of French so
ciety. We watch his passion for
Ruskin develop and flower in
the painstaking translation of
Sesame and Lilies.
Three previously unpublished
letters to his mother confirm

what we know of Proust's for
midable love for her. Letters
thanking friends for their sym
pathy at her death provide us
with a further key to the nar
rator's towering description of
his grandmother's destruction
by old age in the novel.
As weakness and disease
gradually overhaul him, his let
ters begin to groan with fatigue
and exhaustion. He takes in
jections of caffeine so as to fin
ish a letter, scribbling page
after page on his knees in bed.
We watch the relentless involve
ment with French literary jour
nalism, and witness the care
which he devoted to every last
detail in his newspaper articles.
Gide Misjudged Him
In a letter to princess Bibesco
of 1912 he encloses a declaration
of great significance, for it
shows that the style and tech
nique of the whole work was
already in his mind before
Swann's Way had struggled into
print a year or two later: "A
sensation, however disinterested
it may be, a perfume, a ray of
light, if they are there, are still
too much in my power to make
me happy. It is when they bring
back to my mind some other
sensation, when I savor them
between the present and the
past, that they do so."
Turn to p. 259, to the thrilling
and famous letter by Andre
Gide in which he apologises
bitterly for having misjudged
Proust's early notebooks and re
jected Swann's Way for the
Nouville Revue Franealse, of
which he was a founder and di

rector: "I thought of you, shall
I confess it, as a snob, a man of
the world and a dilettante—the
worst possible thing for our re
view."
Perhaps Proust's closest cor
respondent, the only friend with
whom he never had a serious
quarrel, was Emile Straus, who,
in her youth, had married an
unknown composer called Bizet.
The rich and voluminous ex
change between Proust and
Straus is the high mark of Miss
Curtiss' eclectic edition. A letter
of hers from 1921 thanks him
for having sent the "daring and
magnificent book", his Guer
mantes volumes, where the
Duchess Oriane is largely based
on the elegance, refinement and
wit of Bizet's widow.
Sickness Sensitizes
"Sickness sensitizes man for
observation" — wrote the Gon
courts, a generation before
Proust proved this formula stu
pendously and for all time. A
few days before his death, still
feverishly writing letters, scrib
bling notes and correcting
proofs, he sends a page of his
"hideous and illegible handwrit
ing" to Vettard. He says that
his novel has perhaps been "like
a telescope which is pointed at
time."
Deep within the novel Proust
had said that real books must
be children not of broad day
light and small-talk, but of dark
ness and silence. With her ad

This selection of Proust's let
ters is a powerful and fasci
nating book. The translator slips
behind an unpretentious render
ing, content to unmask for the
general reader a little more of
the arcane magic of Proust's
genius.
Not only is her academic in
tegrity irreproachable; her re
search in Paris and amongst
Proust's surviving acquaint -
ances in the late '40's fully en
titles her to the choice of letters
which she makes. She offers a
brief and sensative summary of
Proust's relationship with each
new correspondent that is in
troduced and sorts out his let
ters to them so that they stand
in chronological order as a sin
gle continuous commentary on
the novelist's mind and work.
She adds —always welcome—
an index and provides useful
notes with page-reference at the
back of the collection. There is
a workmanlike introduction by
Harry Levin which one could
recommend without misgivings
to anyone who has not yet
opened Proust.
Love For Mother
The early letters show Proust
as an ambitious and enter
taining member of French so
ciety. We watch his passion for
Ruskin develop and flower in
the painstaking translation of
Sesame and Lilies.
Three previously unpublished
letters to his mother confirm

what we know of Proust's for
midable love for her. Letters
thanking friends for their sym
pathy at her death provide us
with a further key to the nar
rator's towering description of
his grandmother's destruction
by old age in the novel.
As weakness and disease
gradually overhaul him, his let
ters begin to groan with fatigue
and exhaustion. He takes in
jections of caffeine so as to fin
ish a letter, scribbling page
after page on his knees in bed.
We watch the relentless involve
ment with French literary jour
nalism, and witness the care
which he devoted to every last
detail in his newspaper articles.
Gide Misjudged Him
In a letter to princess Bibesco
of 1912 he encloses a declaration
of great significance, for it
shows that the style and tech
nique of the whole work was
already in his mind before
Swann's Way had struggled into
print a year or two later: "A
sensation, however disinterested
it may be, a perfume, a ray of
light, if they are there, are still
too much in my power to make
me happy. It is when they bring
back to my mind some other
sensation, when I savor them
between the present and the
past, that they do so."
Turn to p. 259, to the thrilling
and famous letter by Andre
Gide in which he apologises
bitterly for having misjudged
Proust's early notebooks and re
jected Swann's Way for the
Nouville Revue Franealse, of
which he was a founder and di

rector: "I thought of you, shall
I confess it, as a snob, a man of
the world and a dilettante—the
worst possible thing for our re
view."
Perhaps Proust's closest cor
respondent, the only friend with
whom he never had a serious
quarrel, was Emile Straus, who,
in her youth, had married an
unknown composer called Bizet.
The rich and voluminous ex
change between Proust and
Straus is the high mark of Miss
Curtiss' eclectic edition. A letter
of hers from 1921 thanks him
for having sent the "daring and
magnificent book", his Guer
mantes volumes, where the
Duchess Oriane is largely based
on the elegance, refinement and
wit of Bizet's widow.
Sickness Sensitizes
"Sickness sensitizes man for
observation" — wrote the Gon
courts, a generation before
Proust proved this formula stu
pendously and for all time. A
few days before his death, still
feverishly writing letters, scrib
bling notes and correcting
proofs, he sends a page of his
"hideous and illegible handwrit
ing" to Vettard. He says that
his novel has perhaps been "like
a telescope which is pointed at
time."
