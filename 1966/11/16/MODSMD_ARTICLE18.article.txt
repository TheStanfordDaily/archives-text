# COACHE'S ANALYSIS
## Too Many Fumbles 
### NICK SELBY 
(Note: The following is an interview with Stanford football
coach John Ralston on the questions arising from the 10-0 loss to
UCLA Saturday.)
Q. What changes did you make in your defense to control the
UCLA passing attack? Did you concede the ground game to stop
the Bruins in the air?
Coach Ralston: We went into the game with our prime objective
to stop the passing of Beban. For this reason, we spread our line
men and played our linebackers a shade wider, and we got a good
rush on the passer. We stopped the rollout also, but this left our
middle open, and in the second half Mel Farr had some long runs.
We did not really concede the ground game, because we knew
to do that would use a lot of time. In the first half, UCLA had only
24 scrimmage plays, but the final count had us with 83 plays to
UCLA's 65. We hoped for a count of 90-55. UCLA ran the ball
better the second half and got more plays.
Q. How did UCLA gain the yardage on the ground? What hap
pened on the two pass plays from Beban to fullback Rick Purdy
which each gained 30 yards?
Coach Ralston: UCLA was trapping our tackle, Blaine Nye, very
easily because we were a little more spread out. On the pass
plays, UCLA broke down our coverage very effectively. Our de
fensive backs were occupied with long receivers ,and Beban faked
twice, once to Purdy and then to Farr.
Our linebacker was tied up with the fake to Farr, and couldn't
move out in the flat to cover the fullback. Our end was charging and
thus no one could cover. Later, Monty Mohrman, our tackle, batted
down one of those passes. We were ready for the play, but Beban
made very good fakes to Farr.
Q. What happened on the play Beban scored on?
Coach Ralston: UCLA ran what we call an odd split—they split
the tight end a few yards. Tom Hazelrigg, our right defensive end,
charged through the hole between the end and the tackle, and was
blocked off from the outside. The halfback and the fullback moved
around our right end and Beban followed.
The fullback knocked our linebacker Marty Brill down. Farr, the
halfback, knocked Don Renwick, our halfback, down also. Our
safety, Dave Nelson, kept to the inside, thinking that Renwick
would turn the play in. Renwick didn't, Beban kept outside, and
Nelson didn't have a shot at him. The real mistake was Hazelrigg
going inside the end.
(J. Who were your defensive standouts Saturday?
Coach Ralston: Hazelrigg actually played a great game. John
Guillory turned in another good performance. Blaine Nye, consid
ering that he played off an injury, was also good.
Q. What about Marty Brill, who was named player of the game?
Coach Ralston: Well, Brill sort of "freelances." We'd be a lot
happier if he played his position. He's a real crowd pleaser in that
he comes up with the big play.
Q. How do you evaluate Lewis's performance at quarterback?
Will he start there against Cal?
Coach Ralston: Lewis did a fine job at quarterback, but he also
fumbled five times. Fumbling's been a problem of Dave's for the
last two years. He's a little careless with the ball.
Dave will start at quarterback Saturday. But Gene Washington
can throw the ball well now, too, so both will see action there.
Q. What were the reasons for not scoring? What is your strategy
near the goal line? Do you like to throw the ball as much as you
did against UCLA?
Coach Ralston: Once again, it was a breakdown of the team play
ing as a unit. A few mistakes ruin the whole play. Our strategy is
determined by the situation. For example, we had to pass four times
in a row late in the game because of the lack of time.
We also had some bad breaks near the end zone. Once we had a
penalty, another time we had first and goal on the ten, which is
a very tough situation. In that case, we had Root carry the ball, and
after looking at the play on the films, we saw that if Root had cut
the right way he would have gone all the way.
We don't usually throw the ball as much as we did, but UCLA
had our running game pretty well stopped. In 41 carries, we aver
aged only 2.78 yards per carry. We felt we had to throw.
Q. How do you feel about this season, having won only four
games with only Big Game left?
Coach Ralston: I'm very disappointed about the year. Our
conference record is 0-4-0. We just haven't been able to win the
close games. With the exception of the Minnesota game, however,
we were in every game at least to the middle of the fourth quarter.
Let me say that the players have had higher morale, have shown
better dedication than any other group before. Football has become
a real way of life for these boys, and I'm proud of them all. We
just have lacked that extra something which means a 10*0-0 season
instead of a 5-5 one.
Q. What is the key to your magic over Cal in the Big Game?
What do you worry about most from the golden Bears?
Coach Ralston: We have to be mighty humble about winning five

in a row in such a series as this.
Since I've been here, we've won
three in a row, and I feel the
law of averages is going to catch
up with us sometime. I think it
will be the first time for six wins
in a row, which is very rare
when the series record shows
only a two game edge for Stan
ford.

after looking at the play on the films, we saw that if Root had cut
the right way he would have gone all the way.
We don't usually throw the ball as much as we did, but UCLA
had our running game pretty well stopped. In 41 carries, we aver
aged only 2.78 yards per carry. We felt we had to throw.
Q. How do you feel about this season, having won only four
games with only Big Game left?
Coach Ralston: I'm very disappointed about the year. Our
conference record is 0-4-0. We just haven't been able to win the
close games. With the exception of the Minnesota game, however,
we were in every game at least to the middle of the fourth quarter.
Let me say that the players have had higher morale, have shown
better dedication than any other group before. Football has become
a real way of life for these boys, and I'm proud of them all. We
just have lacked that extra something which means a 10*0-0 season
instead of a 5-5 one.
Q. What is the key to your magic over Cal in the Big Game?
What do you worry about most from the golden Bears?
Coach Ralston: We have to be mighty humble about winning five

in a row in such a series as this.
Since I've been here, we've won
three in a row, and I feel the
law of averages is going to catch
up with us sometime. I think it
will be the first time for six wins
in a row, which is very rare
when the series record shows
only a two game edge for Stan
ford.
(Note: The following is an interview with Stanford football
coach John Ralston on the questions arising from the 10-0 loss to
UCLA Saturday.)
Q. What changes did you make in your defense to control the
UCLA passing attack? Did you concede the ground game to stop
the Bruins in the air?
Coach Ralston: We went into the game with our prime objective
to stop the passing of Beban. For this reason, we spread our line
men and played our linebackers a shade wider, and we got a good
rush on the passer. We stopped the rollout also, but this left our
middle open, and in the second half Mel Farr had some long runs.
We did not really concede the ground game, because we knew
to do that would use a lot of time. In the first half, UCLA had only
24 scrimmage plays, but the final count had us with 83 plays to
UCLA's 65. We hoped for a count of 90-55. UCLA ran the ball
better the second half and got more plays.
Q. How did UCLA gain the yardage on the ground? What hap
pened on the two pass plays from Beban to fullback Rick Purdy
which each gained 30 yards?
Coach Ralston: UCLA was trapping our tackle, Blaine Nye, very
easily because we were a little more spread out. On the pass
plays, UCLA broke down our coverage very effectively. Our de
fensive backs were occupied with long receivers ,and Beban faked
twice, once to Purdy and then to Farr.
Our linebacker was tied up with the fake to Farr, and couldn't
move out in the flat to cover the fullback. Our end was charging and
thus no one could cover. Later, Monty Mohrman, our tackle, batted
down one of those passes. We were ready for the play, but Beban
made very good fakes to Farr.
Q. What happened on the play Beban scored on?
Coach Ralston: UCLA ran what we call an odd split—they split
the tight end a few yards. Tom Hazelrigg, our right defensive end,
charged through the hole between the end and the tackle, and was
blocked off from the outside. The halfback and the fullback moved
around our right end and Beban followed.
The fullback knocked our linebacker Marty Brill down. Farr, the
halfback, knocked Don Renwick, our halfback, down also. Our
safety, Dave Nelson, kept to the inside, thinking that Renwick
would turn the play in. Renwick didn't, Beban kept outside, and
Nelson didn't have a shot at him. The real mistake was Hazelrigg
going inside the end.
(J. Who were your defensive standouts Saturday?
Coach Ralston: Hazelrigg actually played a great game. John
Guillory turned in another good performance. Blaine Nye, consid
ering that he played off an injury, was also good.
Q. What about Marty Brill, who was named player of the game?
Coach Ralston: Well, Brill sort of "freelances." We'd be a lot
happier if he played his position. He's a real crowd pleaser in that
he comes up with the big play.
Q. How do you evaluate Lewis's performance at quarterback?
Will he start there against Cal?
Coach Ralston: Lewis did a fine job at quarterback, but he also
fumbled five times. Fumbling's been a problem of Dave's for the
last two years. He's a little careless with the ball.
Dave will start at quarterback Saturday. But Gene Washington
can throw the ball well now, too, so both will see action there.
Q. What were the reasons for not scoring? What is your strategy
near the goal line? Do you like to throw the ball as much as you
did against UCLA?
Coach Ralston: Once again, it was a breakdown of the team play
ing as a unit. A few mistakes ruin the whole play. Our strategy is
determined by the situation. For example, we had to pass four times
in a row late in the game because of the lack of time.
We also had some bad breaks near the end zone. Once we had a
penalty, another time we had first and goal on the ten, which is
a very tough situation. In that case, we had Root carry the ball, and
after looking at the play on the films, we saw that if Root had cut
the right way he would have gone all the way.

Nelson didn't have a shot at him. The real mistake was Hazelrigg
going inside the end.
(J. Who were your defensive standouts Saturday?
Coach Ralston: Hazelrigg actually played a great game. John
Guillory turned in another good performance. Blaine Nye, consid
ering that he played off an injury, was also good.
Q. What about Marty Brill, who was named player of the game?
Coach Ralston: Well, Brill sort of "freelances." We'd be a lot
happier if he played his position. He's a real crowd pleaser in that
he comes up with the big play.
Q. How do you evaluate Lewis's performance at quarterback?
Will he start there against Cal?
Coach Ralston: Lewis did a fine job at quarterback, but he also
fumbled five times. Fumbling's been a problem of Dave's for the
last two years. He's a little careless with the ball.
Dave will start at quarterback Saturday. But Gene Washington
can throw the ball well now, too, so both will see action there.
Q. What were the reasons for not scoring? What is your strategy
near the goal line? Do you like to throw the ball as much as you
did against UCLA?
Coach Ralston: Once again, it was a breakdown of the team play
ing as a unit. A few mistakes ruin the whole play. Our strategy is
determined by the situation. For example, we had to pass four times
in a row late in the game because of the lack of time.
We also had some bad breaks near the end zone. Once we had a
penalty, another time we had first and goal on the ten, which is
a very tough situation. In that case, we had Root carry the ball, and
after looking at the play on the films, we saw that if Root had cut
the right way he would have gone all the way.
We don't usually throw the ball as much as we did, but UCLA
had our running game pretty well stopped. In 41 carries, we aver
aged only 2.78 yards per carry. We felt we had to throw.
Q. How do you feel about this season, having won only four
games with only Big Game left?
Coach Ralston: I'm very disappointed about the year. Our
conference record is 0-4-0. We just haven't been able to win the
close games. With the exception of the Minnesota game, however,
we were in every game at least to the middle of the fourth quarter.
Let me say that the players have had higher morale, have shown
better dedication than any other group before. Football has become
a real way of life for these boys, and I'm proud of them all. We
just have lacked that extra something which means a 10*0-0 season
instead of a 5-5 one.
Q. What is the key to your magic over Cal in the Big Game?
What do you worry about most from the golden Bears?
Coach Ralston: We have to be mighty humble about winning five

in a row in such a series as this.
Since I've been here, we've won
three in a row, and I feel the
law of averages is going to catch
up with us sometime. I think it
will be the first time for six wins
in a row, which is very rare
when the series record shows
only a two game edge for Stan
ford.
(Note: The following is an interview with Stanford football
coach John Ralston on the questions arising from the 10-0 loss to
UCLA Saturday.)
Q. What changes did you make in your defense to control the
UCLA passing attack? Did you concede the ground game to stop
the Bruins in the air?
Coach Ralston: We went into the game with our prime objective
to stop the passing of Beban. For this reason, we spread our line
men and played our linebackers a shade wider, and we got a good
rush on the passer. We stopped the rollout also, but this left our
middle open, and in the second half Mel Farr had some long runs.
We did not really concede the ground game, because we knew
to do that would use a lot of time. In the first half, UCLA had only
24 scrimmage plays, but the final count had us with 83 plays to
UCLA's 65. We hoped for a count of 90-55. UCLA ran the ball
better the second half and got more plays.
Q. How did UCLA gain the yardage on the ground? What hap
pened on the two pass plays from Beban to fullback Rick Purdy
which each gained 30 yards?
Coach Ralston: UCLA was trapping our tackle, Blaine Nye, very
easily because we were a little more spread out. On the pass
plays, UCLA broke down our coverage very effectively. Our de
fensive backs were occupied with long receivers ,and Beban faked
twice, once to Purdy and then to Farr.
Our linebacker was tied up with the fake to Farr, and couldn't
move out in the flat to cover the fullback. Our end was charging and
thus no one could cover. Later, Monty Mohrman, our tackle, batted
down one of those passes. We were ready for the play, but Beban
made very good fakes to Farr.
Q. What happened on the play Beban scored on?
Coach Ralston: UCLA ran what we call an odd split—they split
the tight end a few yards. Tom Hazelrigg, our right defensive end,
charged through the hole between the end and the tackle, and was
blocked off from the outside. The halfback and the fullback moved
around our right end and Beban followed.
The fullback knocked our linebacker Marty Brill down. Farr, the
halfback, knocked Don Renwick, our halfback, down also. Our
safety, Dave Nelson, kept to the inside, thinking that Renwick
would turn the play in. Renwick didn't, Beban kept outside, and
Nelson didn't have a shot at him. The real mistake was Hazelrigg
going inside the end.
