# Freshmen Still Guarding Bonfire, Trying To Prevent Cal Sabotage
## 
### CHRISTOPHER HARGROVE 
Sleep well tonight knowing that
your National Guard is awake and
that the freshmen of Wilbur and
Stern Halls are keeping very careful
watch.
As most Stanford students must be
aware, the Big Game at Berkeley is
scheduled for Saturday. And in keep
ing with the finest Stanford tradi
tions, the freshmen and the Cardinals
Board are planning a huge bonfire
for the grand rally Friday night in
Lake Lagunita's dry bed.
Sabotage
In keeping with the finest Cal tra
dition, the Bears from Berkeley are
expected to try to sabotage the bon
fire and, in general, wreak mild havoc
this week here on campus.
The bonfire committee, under the
able leadership of freshman Kirk
Brown, is anxious that their bonfire
will not be ignited prematurely be
fore about 7 o'clock Friday evening.
Therefore, they are taking elaborate
precautions.
According to Brown, the tele
phone poles now in Lagunita, which
will serve as the bonfire's skeleton,

will be under guard 24 hours a day
this week. About a half dozen fresh
men man their posts during the day.
At night about 40 men are on duty.
Two safari tents have been eet up
to accommadate the all-night men,
and periodic patrols are made around
the perimeter of Lagunita.
No Attempts
As of yesterday afternoon, the
Bears had made no attempts on the
telephone poles. The men on guard
said they were not expecting any
trouble, since it was broad daylight
and the fraternity clusters were just
a short distance away. The guards in
tended, nevertheless, to stay on the
alert.
While one group of freshmen is
keeping watch in Lake Lag at night,
another group will be roaming the
campus to keep an eye out for suspic- #
ious looking characters. With the
guidance and encouragement of the
Axe Committee, about a dozen fresh
men per night will be co-operating
with the Stanford Police to try to
prevent a recurrence of the sign
painting incidents of last week.
Monday night, these vigilantes were

kept on their toes by a mysterious
car that cruised around the Quad,
stopping once in a while, then moving
on when approached. Also that night,
a small group of men with knapsacks
was spied near Hoover Tower, When
challenged, they fled into the con
struction work near the tower and
were not seen again.

Friday, of course, is the day of the
great conflagration. The bonfire com
mittee has made plans for tight secur
ity in Lake Lagunita. As the great
mountain of wood takes shape, some
200 men will be placed around it in
three concentric circles to ward off
saboteurs.
