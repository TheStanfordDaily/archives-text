An intramural football season
of seemingly unending "big
games" may have been saving
the best until last, as the Psyche
delics and Neutrinos — psycho
logy against physics — meet to
days to decide a league cham
pionship, at least.
The Neutrinos, who have done
an incredible tightrope act to
remain undefeated up to "now,
can do no worse than a tie for
first place. But a victory by the
Psychedelics, coupled with a
Beta Biz defeat of Law, would
throw the graduate league into
a three-way tie. Both teams
have been pointing all season
for this one.
Also in the spotlight today
are the first round of "B" foot
ball playoffs, with two frater
nity and two independent lea
gue titlists composing a field
from which will emerge a cham
pion tomorrow. Theta Delt-Don
ner and Phi Kap-Blackacro
games could well produce an all
fraternity final, but with the
wet fields and the recent run
of upsets, nobody is making any
predictions.
Negotiations with the intra
mural office at Berkeley have
produced a schedule of at least
six playoff games between in
tramural champions of Stanford
and Cal, to be played here at
3:30 this Friday.
Cal will be represented by
teams from Sigma Chi, Beta and
Psi Upsilon fraternities, Griffith
and Deutsch halls and the Nuc
lear Physics department; itr
mural office is hopeful of adding
an additional graduate team and
a co-op champion so as to pro
vide each of Stanford's "A" lea
gue representatives with an op
ponent.
