## Present Voting Age Increases Student Activist Frustrations 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Student activism was con
ceived and delivered into the
world by the Civil Rights Move
ment. In its second stages of
life this newest form of higher
education explored other areas
of social and political activity,
eventually reaching today's
stage of inquiry into American
education.
I believe concerned students
must make one more stand.
Those who now picket, preach,
sit-in, and march and those who
watch and do nothing for lack
of a morally acceptable vocabu
lary of protest should be al
lowed the lawful, traditional
right of other Americans — The
Vote. Frustrations could then be
channeled into voting booths
rather than loud, angry, and
potentially violent demonstra
tions. If the legal age were to
be lowered to 18, student ideas
could be voiced by student repre
sentatives in legal assemblies.
Perhaps they would be defeated
every time by those already In
power — but they would be
heard.
Today's high school graduate
is at least as well versed in the
American theory of government
as the "average" voter. The col
lege student possesses the added
political virtue of openness to
and knowledge of alternatives to
American democracy and the
basic American materialist phi
losophy. We are qualified to vote
in all ways except age. I don't
think that is much of a qualifi

cation. We students must be
given the right to vote.

Editor, the Daily:
It is disgusting to open the
Daily each morning to find on
the last page the vague, unqual
ified moans of frustrated, dis
contented gripers pointing out
the countless "administrative
atrocities" inflicted upon them.
Why hasn't this column seen a
long overdue letter of commen
dation—commendation of any
kind, in any direction?
If this really is the year of
the change, why not approach
student problems rationally—
within a perspective of transi
tion, rather than one of total
eradication of the existing then
meager hope on the part of a
"select few" for some improb
able reconstruction. Wasted
time is lost forever. Awareness
of the countless "goods" at Stan
ford is no necessary evil; those
who express some degree of sat
isfaction and appreciation for
their academic and residential
lives at Stanford are not merely
sluggish and apathetic, but per
haps have a broader insight to

the purpose of a university com
munity.
True, we all experience con
fusion in evaluation but why
not direct this confusion toward
the end of a positive, construc
tive challenge without ineffec
tive, meaningless protest and
the necessity to incessantly dis
credit the work of our adminis
trative decision-makers on the
inner quad?

It is disgusting to open the
Daily each morning to find on
the last page the vague, unqual
ified moans of frustrated, dis
contented gripers pointing out
the countless "administrative
atrocities" inflicted upon them.
Why hasn't this column seen a
long overdue letter of commen
dation—commendation of any
kind, in any direction?
If this really is the year of
the change, why not approach
student problems rationally—
within a perspective of transi
tion, rather than one of total
eradication of the existing then
meager hope on the part of a
"select few" for some improb
able reconstruction. Wasted
time is lost forever. Awareness
of the countless "goods" at Stan
ford is no necessary evil; those
who express some degree of sat
isfaction and appreciation for
their academic and residential
lives at Stanford are not merely
sluggish and apathetic, but per
haps have a broader insight to

the purpose of a university com
munity.
True, we all experience con
fusion in evaluation but why
not direct this confusion toward
the end of a positive, construc
tive challenge without ineffec
tive, meaningless protest and
the necessity to incessantly dis
credit the work of our adminis
trative decision-makers on the
inner quad?
ANN SHAFFER
Editor, The Daily:
Student activism was con
ceived and delivered into the
world by the Civil Rights Move
ment. In its second stages of
life this newest form of higher
education explored other areas
of social and political activity,
eventually reaching today's
stage of inquiry into American
education.
I believe concerned students
must make one more stand.
Those who now picket, preach,
sit-in, and march and those who
watch and do nothing for lack
of a morally acceptable vocabu
lary of protest should be al
lowed the lawful, traditional
right of other Americans — The
Vote. Frustrations could then be
channeled into voting booths
rather than loud, angry, and
potentially violent demonstra
tions. If the legal age were to
be lowered to 18, student ideas
could be voiced by student repre
sentatives in legal assemblies.
Perhaps they would be defeated
every time by those already In
power — but they would be
heard.
Today's high school graduate
is at least as well versed in the
American theory of government
as the "average" voter. The col
lege student possesses the added
political virtue of openness to
and knowledge of alternatives to
American democracy and the
basic American materialist phi
losophy. We are qualified to vote
in all ways except age. I don't
think that is much of a qualifi

cation. We students must be
