## New Case Against Socrates: Teacher Refused To Publish 
### Tim Vidal 
Was Socrates the type of per
son to whom Stanford Univer
sity would give tenure?
This is not an entirely absurd
question considering that he is
often regarded as one of the
wisest teachers that has ever
lived, and certainly one of the
most influential in the develop
ment of our Western educational
system. There is considerable
reason to doubt that he would
have been offered a permanent
position in this or any other
major university.
No Concrete Evidence
First, he never published any
thing or, for that matter, wrote
anything. How could a univer
sity take the risk of hiring per
manently a man who had not
concretely demonstrated the
quality of his mind through writ
ing? Could they rely upon his
popularity with the throngs of
students that followed him
around Athens? Certainly no
graduate students would want to
study under him since his rec
ommendations would be mean
ingless to them for a position in
Sparta.
Perhaps the heads of his de
partment would have sensed his
potentiality and sponsored his
promotion anyway. But who
would have headed the depart
ments in his day? Meletos?
Anytos? Or was there anyone
in his day, for that matter, out
side of Plato and perhaps a few
of his other students or friends
who sensed the quality and sig
nificance of what he was say
ing? If there was, we have no
evidence of them.
The Image Factor
There was another factor too;
he stirred up and "corrupted the
minds of the young." One of his

students had been Alcibiades,
who was considered a traitor
and the cause of the loss of the
war to Sparta. Furthermore, he
was accused of "criminal med
dling," inquiring "into things
below the earth and in the sky,"
and making "the weaker argu
ment defeat the stronger," and
teaching "others to follow his
example."
This could be considered tan
tamount today to meddling into
the roots of Christianity and
the American political tradition,
since the "things below the
earth and in the sky" were the
roots of Athenian religion, and
discourse the root of their pol
itics. A person questioning each
basic element of our society
would soon have had the CIA,
HUAC and PTA after him.
One of the major differences
between the figurative death of
some Stanford instructors and
the literal death of Socrates was
that Socrates had the opportun
ity to present personally his
case to the jury.
And what would the parents,
alumni, and Board of Trustees
have said when they heard of
the drunken parties that Soc
rates sometimes attended (The
Symposium) at which there is
some suspicion of homosexual
activitiy? Certainly they would
not have allowed such a per
son to remain permanently in a
Stanford faculty position.
(Editor's Note: In this col
umn, Tim Vidal presents a final
word of a theoretical nature for
his four-part series on "Pub
lish or Perish." His attempt to
answer this question has be
come the basis for his humani
ties paper.)

Anytos? Or was there anyone
in his day, for that matter, out
side of Plato and perhaps a few
of his other students or friends
who sensed the quality and sig
nificance of what he was say
ing? If there was, we have no
evidence of them.
The Image Factor
There was another factor too;
he stirred up and "corrupted the
minds of the young." One of his

students had been Alcibiades,
who was considered a traitor
and the cause of the loss of the
war to Sparta. Furthermore, he
was accused of "criminal med
dling," inquiring "into things
below the earth and in the sky,"
and making "the weaker argu
ment defeat the stronger," and
teaching "others to follow his
example."
This could be considered tan
tamount today to meddling into
the roots of Christianity and
the American political tradition,
since the "things below the
earth and in the sky" were the
roots of Athenian religion, and
discourse the root of their pol
itics. A person questioning each
basic element of our society
would soon have had the CIA,
HUAC and PTA after him.
One of the major differences
between the figurative death of
some Stanford instructors and
the literal death of Socrates was
that Socrates had the opportun
ity to present personally his
case to the jury.
And what would the parents,
alumni, and Board of Trustees
have said when they heard of
the drunken parties that Soc
rates sometimes attended (The
Symposium) at which there is
some suspicion of homosexual
activitiy? Certainly they would
not have allowed such a per
son to remain permanently in a
Stanford faculty position.
(Editor's Note: In this col
umn, Tim Vidal presents a final
word of a theoretical nature for
his four-part series on "Pub
lish or Perish." His attempt to
answer this question has be
come the basis for his humani
ties paper.)
Was Socrates the type of per
son to whom Stanford Univer
sity would give tenure?
This is not an entirely absurd
question considering that he is
often regarded as one of the
wisest teachers that has ever
lived, and certainly one of the
most influential in the develop
ment of our Western educational
system. There is considerable
reason to doubt that he would
have been offered a permanent
position in this or any other
major university.
No Concrete Evidence
First, he never published any
thing or, for that matter, wrote
anything. How could a univer
sity take the risk of hiring per
manently a man who had not
concretely demonstrated the
quality of his mind through writ
ing? Could they rely upon his
popularity with the throngs of
students that followed him
around Athens? Certainly no
graduate students would want to
study under him since his rec
ommendations would be mean
ingless to them for a position in
Sparta.
Perhaps the heads of his de
partment would have sensed his
potentiality and sponsored his
promotion anyway. But who
would have headed the depart
ments in his day? Meletos?
Anytos? Or was there anyone
in his day, for that matter, out
side of Plato and perhaps a few
of his other students or friends
who sensed the quality and sig
nificance of what he was say
ing? If there was, we have no
