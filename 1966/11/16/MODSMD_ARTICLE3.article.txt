# Final Ballots Cast Today For Reps, Yell Leaders
## 
### MARY NEWTON 
Balloting began yesterday and will
continue today for head yell-leader
and off-campus undergraduate LA
SSU representatives.
Also on the ballot is a referendum
concerning the Homecoming Queen.
The two candidates for yell leader
are Craig Brown and Bruce Braden.
In the election two weeks ago none

of the throe candidates running for
that position received a clear ma
jority.
The duties of the newly elected
cheerleader will begin with the open
ing of the basketball season.
LASSU Representatives
Undergraduates living off campus
will be voting for representatives to
the Legislature. There are 10 such

members of LASSU, but the present
election is for only four. The ten stu
dents who were elected to these posi
tions last spring will remain in office
until the general elections next
spring. There are 10 candidates for
the four positions.
The proposition concerning the
Homecoming Queen is on the ballot
due to the conflict over the Queen
this year. As a protest against the
original decision to have a queen, it
was suggested that students write in
Wendy G. Wonka on the ballot two
weeks ago. But by refusing to count
Wendy's votes, the Cardinals' Board
ignored the protest.
Referendum
After defeating a measure requir
ing the Board to hand the missing
votes over to LASSU, the Legislature
approved a resolution placing on the
present ballot the following referen
dum: "The Legislature proposes that
Stanford University shall not have a
Homecoming Queen. Do you agree or
disagree with this proposition?"
Candidates for graduate represen
tatives to LASSU were also to have
been on this ballot, but there are not
enough applicants to fill the 67 avail
able offices.
The Business School has already
supplied its seven representatives,
but there have been only nine peti
tions for the remaining 60 openings.
The Humanities and Sciences
School, which is entitled to 22 repre
sentatives, had two candidates; En
gineering, allowed 19 officials, has
offered five candidates; the Medical
School, five representatives, has two
petitions.
All of these candidates will auto
matically receive the positions. The
other schools—Law, six representa
tives; Education, seven; and Earth
Sciences, one—have advanced no can
didates.
