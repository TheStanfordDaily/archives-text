# Spitz Names Vienna Location As Austria's Only Alternative
## 
### 
In a letter to the Stanford Daily,
Lewis W. Spitz, a History professor
at Stanford-in-Austria, has sharply
criticized the location of the present
Austrian Overseas Campus. He stated
that the problem of locality "is funda
mental and the situation critical."
(the letter appears on Page 6 of to
day's Daily.)

Spitz bases his argument for change
on the "physical and cultural isola
tion" of the Panhans.
He said that Stanford students
must be exposed to and involved in
the higher culture of Austrian civili
zation.
Vienna, Spitz says, is the only ac
ceptable alternative.
Although Spitz doesn't discount the
advantages of contact with the more
primitive society of the villagers he
feels that the present campus in the
mountains of Semmering "is an im
possible location for attaining effec
tively the educational objectives for
which the campus was designed." In
Vienna students would be immersed
in "the cultural and political center
of the country," within easy walking
distance of museums, concert halls
and libraries.
Spitz does not accept the argument
that location in Vienna is an impossi
bility. He is certain that with the
conscientious effort of the overseas
campus office in conjunction with
Austrian connections the change
could be effected by the time the Pan
hans* lease expires.
