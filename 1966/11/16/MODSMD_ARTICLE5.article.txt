Voluntary Service in South Vietnam.)

After a month in Vietnam, these are
some impressions I have gathered
about the attitudes of the Vietnamese
towards the Americans in this coun
try.

Vietnamese attitudes towards the
Americans have to be understood in
terms of the sudden and great impact
of American men and materials here.
The military escalation, which began
in earnest last year, has brought
over 318,000 soldiers to Vietnam.
The Agency for International De
velopment has 800 civilians here and
the American construction firm, RMK
BRJ employs another 2,000 Ameri
cans. In addition, there are many

private and government organizations
which employ still more Americans.
The sudden presence of so many
foreigners, who have different cus
toms and manners, in a country the
size of Vietnam, has created strains
and problems of adjustment for the
Vietnamese people.
American Money
In addition to the presence of so
many Americans, the heavy influx of
American money has also created dif
ficulties. America is spending over $1
million a day here on military con
struction alone.
USAID has an annual budget of
$300 million, which will double next
year. Military spending here is simi
larly increasing. Secretary McNamara
has said that after the November elec
tions he will ask Congress for an ad
ditional 10 to 12 billion dollar de
fense supplement. All this money
has created serious inflation in Viet
nam.
Inflation
A pedicab ride, which two years ago
cost 2 piastres, now costs 20 piastres.
There have been similar increases
in many other goods and services.
This has created hardships for many
Vietnamese whose earnings have not
always kept pace with the rise in
prices.
For the mass of Vietnamese people
approval or disapproval of the Ameri
cans rarely rests on political reasons.
The man in the street here is quite
apolitical. Instead his feelings and
opinions are largely formed on the
basis of personal experiences, and his
attitudes are quite mixed.
On the positive side the Vietnamese
—especially the people in the villages
and the rural areas—see the Ameri

can presence as protection against the
Viet Cong. Before the American build
up these people often had no choice
but to submit to rule by the Viet
Cong or the National Liberation
Front. This is no longer the case.
In addition to providing protection,
the military has been working with
USAID and other private and govern
ment groups on aid and development
projects.
While there is much question about
the effectiveness of these programs,
many Vietnamese realize that Ameri
cans are interested in helping them
improve their health conditions, agri
cultural production, education and to
foster community and national de
velopment.
The behavior of Americans here is
often objectionable and consequently
breeds animosity. One month ago
Premier Ky and his wife were forced
to leave a restaurant in Dalat because
a group of drunken Seabees insisted
on using loud and obscene language.
(This week, however, Ky had his
innings by declaring Dalat off limits
to American personnel on leaves.)
Such an incident is only a grosser
example of what takes place con
tinually on a smaller scale through
out Vietnam. Cyclo boys have told me
me that sometimes American soldiers
refuse to pay for their ride. If the
cyclo boys protest, they get hurt. I
have also seen an American take a
bowl of soup and some rice out of a
restaurant without paying.
The Vietnamese
Thousands of Vietnamese work for
the American military, government
and private organizations here. Con
sequently they come into close, daily
contact with Americans, and
often there is friction. For in
stance, many Vietnamese re
sent the fact that if an Ameri
can and a Vietnamese have
similar jobs, the American will
get a much higher wage.
Americans are often conde
scending and rude to the Viet
namese with whom they work.
A Vietnamese woman told me
that her husband refused to
work for the Americans because,
he said, the Americans "despise"
the Vietnamese. This is not true
for many — perhaps most —
Americans here, and yet such
impressions are understandable.

The American presence here
has caused countless inconven
iences for the Vietnamese peo
ple. When the military builds a
compound or other installation
here it is declared off limits to
the Vietnamese. An example is
the new airport and harbor un
der construction at Cam Ranh
Bay. The Americans have com
pletely taken over one of Viet
nam's best, natural harbors.
True, the Vietnamese had not
developed Cam Ranh Bay, and
after the war the facilities there
will be a major asset to them.
But for the present the Viet
namese knows that he can not

use one of his country's best
harbors.
American Navy
Similar problems arise when
the American Navy anchors its
ships in harbors such as the
one here in Nha Trang. The
areas around the ships are im
mediately declared a military
zone and off limits. This has
been disastrous to much of
Vietnam's fishing industry, be
cause the military zones often
happen to be in the best fishing
areas.
Consequently, fish, long a
staple of the Vietnamese diet,
has become scarce and its price
has skyrocketed. A Vietnamese
boat which erringly strays into
the military zones is shot at.
A particularly unfortunate ac
cident happened here in Nha
Trang a couple of months ago.
A fisherman, who was hurry
ing back to the harbor to escape

a hurricane at sea, unwittingly
sailed into the military zone
His boat was sunk and he wa<
killed.
Prostitution
The American presence here
is largely responsible for the
phenomenal rise in prostitution
and bar girls. Neither institutior
is new in Vietnam, but it is only
recently that it has achieved
such proportions, and only re
cently that the prostitute and
the bargirl have nearly reached
the top of the economic ladder.
Such a situation is an affront
to the traditional Vietnamesi
and justifiably they blame it
on the Americans. The large in
crease in prostitution and bar
girls has created difficulties for
other Vietnamese women. For
merly a Vietnamese housewife
has been able to afford two or
three servants, but now a gii.
can earn much more by work
ing in a bar than she can as a
servant. Consequently, only the
very rich can afford services.
In addition, Vietnamese wom
en are now wary of walking
alone at night or going to the
beach, lest they be mistaken b>
the Americans for prostitutes.
It is difficult to judge the ef
fect of Vietnamese hostility
towards Americans. Certainly
many of the 40,000 South Viet
namese who fight with the VC
■choose to do so because of
hatred for the Americans. The
various terrorist attacks on
Americans are another symptom
of this hostility.
Generally, however, despite the
propaganda efforts of the VC
and the National Liberation
Front, the Vietnamese people
have displayed remarkably little
open hostility or resentment to
wards the Americans. Much of
this can probably be attributed
to the tolerance and forebear
ance of the Vietnamese who,
after 25 years of almost con
stant war, have learned to live
with the presence of foreigners
on their soil.

On the positive side the Vietnamese
—especially the people in the villages
and the rural areas—see the Ameri

can presence as protection against the
Viet Cong. Before the American build
up these people often had no choice
but to submit to rule by the Viet
Cong or the National Liberation
Front. This is no longer the case.
In addition to providing protection,
the military has been working with
USAID and other private and govern
ment groups on aid and development
projects.
While there is much question about
the effectiveness of these programs,
many Vietnamese realize that Ameri
cans are interested in helping them
improve their health conditions, agri
cultural production, education and to
foster community and national de
velopment.
The behavior of Americans here is
often objectionable and consequently
breeds animosity. One month ago
Premier Ky and his wife were forced
to leave a restaurant in Dalat because
a group of drunken Seabees insisted
on using loud and obscene language.
(This week, however, Ky had his
innings by declaring Dalat off limits
to American personnel on leaves.)
Such an incident is only a grosser
example of what takes place con
tinually on a smaller scale through
out Vietnam. Cyclo boys have told me
me that sometimes American soldiers
refuse to pay for their ride. If the
cyclo boys protest, they get hurt. I
have also seen an American take a
bowl of soup and some rice out of a
restaurant without paying.
The Vietnamese
Thousands of Vietnamese work for
the American military, government
and private organizations here. Con
sequently they come into close, daily
contact with Americans, and
often there is friction. For in
stance, many Vietnamese re
sent the fact that if an Ameri
can and a Vietnamese have
similar jobs, the American will
get a much higher wage.
Americans are often conde
scending and rude to the Viet
namese with whom they work.
A Vietnamese woman told me
that her husband refused to
work for the Americans because,
he said, the Americans "despise"
the Vietnamese. This is not true
for many — perhaps most —
Americans here, and yet such
impressions are understandable.

The American presence here
has caused countless inconven
iences for the Vietnamese peo
ple. When the military builds a
compound or other installation
here it is declared off limits to
the Vietnamese. An example is
the new airport and harbor un
der construction at Cam Ranh
Bay. The Americans have com
pletely taken over one of Viet
nam's best, natural harbors.
True, the Vietnamese had not
developed Cam Ranh Bay, and
after the war the facilities there
will be a major asset to them.
But for the present the Viet
namese knows that he can not

use one of his country's best
harbors.
American Navy
Similar problems arise when
the American Navy anchors its
ships in harbors such as the
one here in Nha Trang. The
areas around the ships are im
mediately declared a military
zone and off limits. This has
been disastrous to much of
Vietnam's fishing industry, be
cause the military zones often
happen to be in the best fishing
areas.
Consequently, fish, long a
staple of the Vietnamese diet,
has become scarce and its price
has skyrocketed. A Vietnamese
boat which erringly strays into
the military zones is shot at.
A particularly unfortunate ac
cident happened here in Nha
Trang a couple of months ago.
A fisherman, who was hurry
ing back to the harbor to escape

a hurricane at sea, unwittingly
sailed into the military zone
His boat was sunk and he wa<
killed.
Prostitution
The American presence here
is largely responsible for the
phenomenal rise in prostitution
and bar girls. Neither institutior
is new in Vietnam, but it is only
recently that it has achieved
such proportions, and only re
cently that the prostitute and
the bargirl have nearly reached
the top of the economic ladder.
Such a situation is an affront
to the traditional Vietnamesi
and justifiably they blame it
on the Americans. The large in
crease in prostitution and bar
girls has created difficulties for
other Vietnamese women. For
merly a Vietnamese housewife
has been able to afford two or
three servants, but now a gii.
can earn much more by work
ing in a bar than she can as a
servant. Consequently, only the
very rich can afford services.
In addition, Vietnamese wom
en are now wary of walking
alone at night or going to the
beach, lest they be mistaken b>
the Americans for prostitutes.
It is difficult to judge the ef
fect of Vietnamese hostility
towards Americans. Certainly
many of the 40,000 South Viet
namese who fight with the VC
■choose to do so because of
hatred for the Americans. The
various terrorist attacks on
Americans are another symptom
of this hostility.
Generally, however, despite the
propaganda efforts of the VC
and the National Liberation
Front, the Vietnamese people
have displayed remarkably little
open hostility or resentment to
wards the Americans. Much of
this can probably be attributed
to the tolerance and forebear
ance of the Vietnamese who,
after 25 years of almost con
stant war, have learned to live
with the presence of foreigners
on their soil.
(Editor's note: Clark Brown, former
student body vice-president, recounts
first-hand experiences with the Viet
namese people. A June graduate,
Brown is working with International
Voluntary Service in South Vietnam.)

After a month in Vietnam, these are
some impressions I have gathered
about the attitudes of the Vietnamese
towards the Americans in this coun
try.

Vietnamese attitudes towards the
Americans have to be understood in
terms of the sudden and great impact
of American men and materials here.
The military escalation, which began
in earnest last year, has brought
over 318,000 soldiers to Vietnam.
The Agency for International De
velopment has 800 civilians here and
the American construction firm, RMK
BRJ employs another 2,000 Ameri
cans. In addition, there are many

private and government organizations
which employ still more Americans.
The sudden presence of so many
foreigners, who have different cus
toms and manners, in a country the
size of Vietnam, has created strains
and problems of adjustment for the
Vietnamese people.
American Money
In addition to the presence of so
many Americans, the heavy influx of
American money has also created dif
ficulties. America is spending over $1
million a day here on military con
struction alone.
USAID has an annual budget of
$300 million, which will double next
year. Military spending here is simi
larly increasing. Secretary McNamara
has said that after the November elec
tions he will ask Congress for an ad
ditional 10 to 12 billion dollar de
fense supplement. All this money
has created serious inflation in Viet
nam.
Inflation
A pedicab ride, which two years ago
cost 2 piastres, now costs 20 piastres.
There have been similar increases
in many other goods and services.
This has created hardships for many
Vietnamese whose earnings have not
always kept pace with the rise in
prices.
For the mass of Vietnamese people
approval or disapproval of the Ameri
cans rarely rests on political reasons.
The man in the street here is quite
apolitical. Instead his feelings and
opinions are largely formed on the
basis of personal experiences, and his
attitudes are quite mixed.
On the positive side the Vietnamese
—especially the people in the villages
and the rural areas—see the Ameri

can presence as protection against the

the American construction firm, RMK
BRJ employs another 2,000 Ameri
cans. In addition, there are many

private and government organizations
which employ still more Americans.
The sudden presence of so many
foreigners, who have different cus
toms and manners, in a country the
size of Vietnam, has created strains
and problems of adjustment for the
Vietnamese people.
American Money
In addition to the presence of so
many Americans, the heavy influx of
American money has also created dif
ficulties. America is spending over $1
million a day here on military con
struction alone.
USAID has an annual budget of
$300 million, which will double next
year. Military spending here is simi
larly increasing. Secretary McNamara
has said that after the November elec
tions he will ask Congress for an ad
ditional 10 to 12 billion dollar de
fense supplement. All this money
has created serious inflation in Viet
nam.
Inflation
A pedicab ride, which two years ago
cost 2 piastres, now costs 20 piastres.
There have been similar increases
in many other goods and services.
This has created hardships for many
Vietnamese whose earnings have not
always kept pace with the rise in
prices.
For the mass of Vietnamese people
approval or disapproval of the Ameri
cans rarely rests on political reasons.
The man in the street here is quite
apolitical. Instead his feelings and
opinions are largely formed on the
basis of personal experiences, and his
attitudes are quite mixed.
On the positive side the Vietnamese
—especially the people in the villages
and the rural areas—see the Ameri

can presence as protection against the
Viet Cong. Before the American build
up these people often had no choice
but to submit to rule by the Viet
Cong or the National Liberation
Front. This is no longer the case.
In addition to providing protection,
the military has been working with
USAID and other private and govern
ment groups on aid and development
projects.
While there is much question about
the effectiveness of these programs,
many Vietnamese realize that Ameri
cans are interested in helping them
improve their health conditions, agri
cultural production, education and to
foster community and national de
velopment.
The behavior of Americans here is
often objectionable and consequently
breeds animosity. One month ago
Premier Ky and his wife were forced
to leave a restaurant in Dalat because
a group of drunken Seabees insisted
on using loud and obscene language.
(This week, however, Ky had his
innings by declaring Dalat off limits
to American personnel on leaves.)
Such an incident is only a grosser
example of what takes place con
tinually on a smaller scale through
out Vietnam. Cyclo boys have told me
me that sometimes American soldiers
refuse to pay for their ride. If the
cyclo boys protest, they get hurt. I
have also seen an American take a
bowl of soup and some rice out of a
restaurant without paying.
The Vietnamese
Thousands of Vietnamese work for
the American military, government
and private organizations here. Con
sequently they come into close, daily
contact with Americans, and
often there is friction. For in
stance, many Vietnamese re
sent the fact that if an Ameri
can and a Vietnamese have
similar jobs, the American will
get a much higher wage.
Americans are often conde
scending and rude to the Viet
namese with whom they work.
A Vietnamese woman told me
that her husband refused to
work for the Americans because,
he said, the Americans "despise"
the Vietnamese. This is not true
for many — perhaps most —
Americans here, and yet such
impressions are understandable.

The American presence here
has caused countless inconven
iences for the Vietnamese peo
ple. When the military builds a
compound or other installation
here it is declared off limits to
the Vietnamese. An example is
the new airport and harbor un
der construction at Cam Ranh
Bay. The Americans have com
pletely taken over one of Viet
nam's best, natural harbors.
True, the Vietnamese had not
developed Cam Ranh Bay, and
after the war the facilities there
will be a major asset to them.
But for the present the Viet
namese knows that he can not

use one of his country's best
harbors.
American Navy
Similar problems arise when
the American Navy anchors its
ships in harbors such as the
one here in Nha Trang. The
areas around the ships are im
mediately declared a military
zone and off limits. This has
been disastrous to much of
Vietnam's fishing industry, be
cause the military zones often
happen to be in the best fishing
areas.
Consequently, fish, long a
staple of the Vietnamese diet,
has become scarce and its price
has skyrocketed. A Vietnamese
boat which erringly strays into
the military zones is shot at.
A particularly unfortunate ac
cident happened here in Nha
Trang a couple of months ago.
A fisherman, who was hurry
ing back to the harbor to escape

a hurricane at sea, unwittingly
sailed into the military zone
His boat was sunk and he wa<
killed.
Prostitution
The American presence here
is largely responsible for the
phenomenal rise in prostitution
and bar girls. Neither institutior
is new in Vietnam, but it is only
recently that it has achieved
such proportions, and only re
cently that the prostitute and
the bargirl have nearly reached
the top of the economic ladder.
Such a situation is an affront
to the traditional Vietnamesi
and justifiably they blame it
on the Americans. The large in
crease in prostitution and bar
girls has created difficulties for
other Vietnamese women. For
merly a Vietnamese housewife

three servants, but now a gii.

servant. Consequently, only the
very rich can afford services.
In addition, Vietnamese wom
en are now wary of walking
alone at night or going to the
beach, lest they be mistaken b>
the Americans for prostitutes.
It is difficult to judge the ef
fect of Vietnamese hostility
towards Americans. Certainly
many of the 40,000 South Viet
namese who fight with the VC
■choose to do so because of
hatred for the Americans. The
various terrorist attacks on
Americans are another symptom
of this hostility.
Generally, however, despite the
propaganda efforts of the VC
and the National Liberation
Front, the Vietnamese people
have displayed remarkably little
open hostility or resentment to
wards the Americans. Much of
this can probably be attributed
to the tolerance and forebear

After a month in Vietnam, these are
some impressions I have gathered
about the attitudes of the Vietnamese
towards the Americans in this coun
try.

Vietnamese attitudes towards the
Americans have to be understood in
terms of the sudden and great impact
of American men and materials here.
The military escalation, which began
in earnest last year, has brought
over 318,000 soldiers to Vietnam.
The Agency for International De
velopment has 800 civilians here and
the American construction firm, RMK
BRJ employs another 2,000 Ameri

beach, lest they be mistaken b>
the Americans for prostitutes.
It is difficult to judge the ef
fect of Vietnamese hostility
towards Americans. Certainly
many of the 40,000 South Viet
namese who fight with the VC
■choose to do so because of
hatred for the Americans. The
various terrorist attacks on
Americans are another symptom
of this hostility.
Generally, however, despite the
propaganda efforts of the VC
and the National Liberation
Front, the Vietnamese people
have displayed remarkably little
open hostility or resentment to
wards the Americans. Much of
this can probably be attributed
to the tolerance and forebear
ance of the Vietnamese who,
after 25 years of almost con
stant war, have learned to live
with the presence of foreigners
on their soil.

student body vice-president, recounts
first-hand experiences with the Viet

Brown is working with International
Voluntary Service in South Vietnam.)

After a month in Vietnam, these are
some impressions I have gathered
about the attitudes of the Vietnamese
towards the Americans in this coun
try.

Vietnamese attitudes towards the
Americans have to be understood in
terms of the sudden and great impact
of American men and materials here.
The military escalation, which began
in earnest last year, has brought
over 318,000 soldiers to Vietnam.
The Agency for International De
velopment has 800 civilians here and
the American construction firm, RMK
BRJ employs another 2,000 Ameri
cans. In addition, there are many

private and government organizations
which employ still more Americans.
The sudden presence of so many
foreigners, who have different cus
toms and manners, in a country the
size of Vietnam, has created strains
and problems of adjustment for the
Vietnamese people.
American Money
In addition to the presence of so
many Americans, the heavy influx of
American money has also created dif
ficulties. America is spending over $1
million a day here on military con
struction alone.
USAID has an annual budget of
$300 million, which will double next
year. Military spending here is simi
larly increasing. Secretary McNamara
has said that after the November elec
tions he will ask Congress for an ad
ditional 10 to 12 billion dollar de
fense supplement. All this money
has created serious inflation in Viet
nam.
Inflation
A pedicab ride, which two years ago
cost 2 piastres, now costs 20 piastres.
There have been similar increases
in many other goods and services.
This has created hardships for many
Vietnamese whose earnings have not
always kept pace with the rise in
prices.
For the mass of Vietnamese people
approval or disapproval of the Ameri
cans rarely rests on political reasons.
The man in the street here is quite
apolitical. Instead his feelings and
opinions are largely formed on the
basis of personal experiences, and his
attitudes are quite mixed.
On the positive side the Vietnamese
—especially the people in the villages
and the rural areas—see the Ameri

can presence as protection against the
Viet Cong. Before the American build
up these people often had no choice
but to submit to rule by the Viet
Cong or the National Liberation
Front. This is no longer the case.
In addition to providing protection,
the military has been working with
USAID and other private and govern
ment groups on aid and development
projects.
While there is much question about
the effectiveness of these programs,
many Vietnamese realize that Ameri
cans are interested in helping them
improve their health conditions, agri
cultural production, education and to
foster community and national de
velopment.
The behavior of Americans here is
often objectionable and consequently
breeds animosity. One month ago
Premier Ky and his wife were forced
to leave a restaurant in Dalat because
a group of drunken Seabees insisted
on using loud and obscene language.
(This week, however, Ky had his
innings by declaring Dalat off limits
to American personnel on leaves.)
Such an incident is only a grosser
example of what takes place con
tinually on a smaller scale through
out Vietnam. Cyclo boys have told me
me that sometimes American soldiers
refuse to pay for their ride. If the
cyclo boys protest, they get hurt. I
have also seen an American take a
bowl of soup and some rice out of a
restaurant without paying.
The Vietnamese
Thousands of Vietnamese work for
the American military, government
and private organizations here. Con
sequently they come into close, daily
contact with Americans, and
often there is friction. For in
stance, many Vietnamese re
sent the fact that if an Ameri
can and a Vietnamese have
similar jobs, the American will
get a much higher wage.
Americans are often conde
scending and rude to the Viet
namese with whom they work.
A Vietnamese woman told me
that her husband refused to
work for the Americans because,
he said, the Americans "despise"
the Vietnamese. This is not true
for many — perhaps most —
Americans here, and yet such
impressions are understandable.

The American presence here
has caused countless inconven
iences for the Vietnamese peo
ple. When the military builds a
compound or other installation
here it is declared off limits to
the Vietnamese. An example is
the new airport and harbor un
der construction at Cam Ranh
Bay. The Americans have com
pletely taken over one of Viet
nam's best, natural harbors.
True, the Vietnamese had not
developed Cam Ranh Bay, and
after the war the facilities there
will be a major asset to them.
But for the present the Viet
namese knows that he can not

use one of his country's best
harbors.
American Navy
Similar problems arise when
the American Navy anchors its
ships in harbors such as the
one here in Nha Trang. The
areas around the ships are im
mediately declared a military
zone and off limits. This has
been disastrous to much of
Vietnam's fishing industry, be
cause the military zones often
happen to be in the best fishing
areas.
Consequently, fish, long a
staple of the Vietnamese diet,
has become scarce and its price
has skyrocketed. A Vietnamese
boat which erringly strays into
the military zones is shot at.
A particularly unfortunate ac
cident happened here in Nha
Trang a couple of months ago.
A fisherman, who was hurry
ing back to the harbor to escape

a hurricane at sea, unwittingly
sailed into the military zone
His boat was sunk and he wa<
killed.
Prostitution
The American presence here
is largely responsible for the
phenomenal rise in prostitution
and bar girls. Neither institutior
is new in Vietnam, but it is only
recently that it has achieved
such proportions, and only re
cently that the prostitute and
the bargirl have nearly reached
the top of the economic ladder.
Such a situation is an affront
to the traditional Vietnamesi
and justifiably they blame it
on the Americans. The large in
crease in prostitution and bar
girls has created difficulties for
other Vietnamese women. For
merly a Vietnamese housewife
has been able to afford two or
three servants, but now a gii.
can earn much more by work
ing in a bar than she can as a
servant. Consequently, only the
very rich can afford services.
In addition, Vietnamese wom
en are now wary of walking
alone at night or going to the
beach, lest they be mistaken b>
the Americans for prostitutes.

fect of Vietnamese hostility
