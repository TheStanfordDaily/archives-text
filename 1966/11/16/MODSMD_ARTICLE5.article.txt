After a month in Vietnam, these are
some impressions I have gathered
about the attitudes of the Vietnamese
towards the Americans in this coun
try.

Vietnamese attitudes towards the
Americans have to be understood in
terms of the sudden and great impact
of American men and materials here.
The military escalation, which began
in earnest last year, has brought
over 318,000 soldiers to Vietnam.
The Agency for International De
velopment has 800 civilians here and
the American construction firm, RMK
BRJ employs another 2,000 Ameri
cans. In addition, there are many

private and government organizations
which employ still more Americans.
The sudden presence of so many
foreigners, who have different cus
toms and manners, in a country the
size of Vietnam, has created strains
and problems of adjustment for the
Vietnamese people.
American Money
In addition to the presence of so
many Americans, the heavy influx of
American money has also created dif
ficulties. America is spending over $1
million a day here on military con
struction alone.
USAID has an annual budget of
$300 million, which will double next
year. Military spending here is simi
larly increasing. Secretary McNamara
has said that after the November elec
tions he will ask Congress for an ad
ditional 10 to 12 billion dollar de
fense supplement. All this money
has created serious inflation in Viet
nam.
Inflation
A pedicab ride, which two years ago
cost 2 piastres, now costs 20 piastres.
There have been similar increases
in many other goods and services.
This has created hardships for many
Vietnamese whose earnings have not
always kept pace with the rise in
prices.
For the mass of Vietnamese people
approval or disapproval of the Ameri
cans rarely rests on political reasons.
The man in the street here is quite
apolitical. Instead his feelings and
opinions are largely formed on the
basis of personal experiences, and his
attitudes are quite mixed.
On the positive side the Vietnamese
—especially the people in the villages
and the rural areas—see the Ameri

can presence as protection against the
Viet Cong. Before the American build
up these people often had no choice
but to submit to rule by the Viet
Cong or the National Liberation
Front. This is no longer the case.
In addition to providing protection,
the military has been working with
USAID and other private and govern
ment groups on aid and development
projects.
While there is much question about
the effectiveness of these programs,
many Vietnamese realize that Ameri
cans are interested in helping them
improve their health conditions, agri
cultural production, education and to
foster community and national de
velopment.
The behavior of Americans here is
often objectionable and consequently
breeds animosity. One month ago
Premier Ky and his wife were forced
to leave a restaurant in Dalat because
a group of drunken Seabees insisted
on using loud and obscene language.
(This week, however, Ky had his
innings by declaring Dalat off limits
to American personnel on leaves.)
Such an incident is only a grosser
example of what takes place con
tinually on a smaller scale through
out Vietnam. Cyclo boys have told me
me that sometimes American soldiers
refuse to pay for their ride. If the
cyclo boys protest, they get hurt. I
have also seen an American take a
bowl of soup and some rice out of a
restaurant without paying.
The Vietnamese
Thousands of Vietnamese work for
the American military, government
and private organizations here. Con
sequently they come into close, daily
