# Prince Lightfoot Attacks Indian Discrimination

### 
"Discriniation against the Ameri
can Indian is worse than that against
the American Negro because our dis
crimination is political discrimina
tion," said Tim Williams, 42, leader
of the Yurok Indians and for 15 years
Stanford's Prince Lightfoot.
In a speech last night in the Toyon
Hall lounge Williams recounted the
recent struggles of the California In
dians to get the $96 million promised
them by treaty to pay them for the
state of California. This struggle has
been complicated by the official posi
tion that Indians cannot go to court.
Indians are not regulated by regu
lar U.S. law. Since their ancestors
signed treaties with the Federal gov
ernment, they are regarded as for
eigners in their own land. Indians

can vote in elections but have no say
in Indian affairs and are not included
in programs like the GI Bill though
many have served in the armed
forces. According to Williams, In
dians are subject to the whim of the
Bureau of Indian Affairs, part of the
Department of the Interior.
Williams pointed out that the aver
age life span of the California Indian
is 42 years. Indians live in substan
dard housing on their reservations
and can be deprived of their lands
at any time. Eighty to ninety percent
of the Yuroks, William's tribe, are un
educated and unemployed.
Citing the average Indian's current
annual income of $1100, Williams
said, "For my people I want educa
tion, I want sufficient medical care,
and I want decent housing."
