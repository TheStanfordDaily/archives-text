# Confusion, Secrecy Shroud Judicial Decisions

### GAIL ANDERSON (First in a series) 
"The greatest problem with the judicial
process at Stanford is that it is constructed
under the underlying norms of two different
communities."
ASSU Administrative Assistant Tim Haight's
statement emphasizes the basis for the con
fusion surrounding Stanford's judicial struc
ture: conflicts within this system are symp
tomatic of general conflicts in the power struc
ture of the University.
Recent events at Stanford have focused
attention on the workings and problems of
the judicial system. There seems to be a uni
versal lack of knowledge and understanding
of the system not only in the student body
but even among members of the various
judicial bodies.
Ambiguities
One difficulty is generated by the disagree
ment between students and administration as
to the idea of education—and specifically the
nature of student government. As Haight has
pointed out, "Law is based on social conven
tion and mores but the ideas of the student
and those of the administration about edu
cating students are fundamentally different."
The setup of the judicial system gives nominal
power to the students but ultimate, and there
fore actual, power only to the administration.
Thus it must operate in two different spheres

—the "underlying norms of two different com
mittees."
This creates ambiguities as to the jurisdic
tion and powers of the various judiciai bodies.
Theoretically the ASSU judicial system has
exclusive original jurisdiction in all cases in
volving a violation of the Fundamental Stan
dard; in practice this is often untrue. Ex
amination of the structure itself reveals the
problems that lie within it.
The basic instrument of judicial procedure
is the ASSU Judicial Council, composed of
Men's Council and Women's Council. Below
this are the subordinate councils of groups
such as fraternities and residences. Above it
is the Interim Judicial Board (IJB) the basic
appeals mechanism. None of these groups has
any decision-making power. All decisions are
in the form of recommendations to the Presi
dent.
Three Routes
A normal case may take one of three routes
to the ultimate decision by the administration.
A student or faculty member may refer a
violation to H. Donald Winbigler, Dean of
Students, who may either decide to let the
case go or refer it to the Judicial Council; the
person may go directly to the Judicial Council;
or the defendant may opt to take his entire
case through the Dean, bypassing the Judicial
Council.
All violations reported to the Dean of Stu

dents' office are turned over to Dean Gordon,
Associate Dean of Students for Counselling.
He evaluates the nature of the case and de
cides whether the factors involved could best
be handled through counselling or through the
judicial process. For this reason many cases
never reach the Judicial Council.
Further, in many cases the Judicial Council
is bypassed for reasons unknown or obscure.
An example is the Phi Delt case. Members
of the Council feel that this should have been
handled by them, but as Vice-Chairman Joel
Kugelmass put it, "We weren't even asked."
Since the ASSU Constitution states "The
Judicial Council shall have exclusive original
jurisdiction in all cases involving a violation
of the Fundamental Standard by any student
organization" as well as over individual stu
dents, the Council did theoretically have the
right to try the case. (The Constitution and
Bylaws also gives the right to try fraternity
houses as corporate entities to the Interfra
ternity Council—an unresolved ambiguity.)
The Constitution also provides that when four
Council members deem it necessary they may
try any case; once more this proves to be
more theory than practice.
In the Phi Delt case the members of the
Judicial Council were told by Interfraternity
Council President Drennen Jones that they
"weren't involved."
Another source of confusion is that Judicial

Council's purpose is to enforce ambiguity of
Fundamental Standard. Unless there is a
specific University or ASSU policy or stan
dard of conduct applicable to a case, a de
fendant must be judged as to whether his
conduct was a violation of the Fundamental
Standard and whether he knew it at the time.
Turnover on the Judicial Council as well as
the changing nature of its role have resulted
in a lack of precedent; thus decisions as to
what is a violation are completely up to the
members of the existing council.
Possible courses of action recommended by
the Council are another problem. The range
of sentences include formal warning, strong
formal warning, probation, suspended sus
pension, suspension, and expulsion—a range
which Kugelmass termed "absurd."
Serious Problem
Professor Morris Zelditch of the Sociology
Department, member of IJB, noted a serious
problem. There is no clear conception of
what sentences are commensurate with what
violation. And for those violations when sus
pension is too serious, there is little effective
action that the Judicial Council can recom
mend.
Another difficulty is the problem of secrecy
in the judicial processes. This is one of the
major reasons why few people on campus
seem to know what's going on. Judicial actions
are shrouded in secrecy; groups hold closed

hearings; cases are handled without the Uni
versity community realizing one was in
question; facts about specific cases are un
disclosed.
This problem is accentuated by conflicting
philosophies among those persons involved in
the judicial process. The general excuse of
fered is that secrecy "protects the student."
One member of the IJB expressed the opinion
that "We're not dealing with hardened crim
inals. Where there are errors of judgment,
publicity can be harmful even when the stu
dent is found innocent." (This, of course,
ignores the fact that a person's name does not
have to be revealed in order to publicize a
judicial structure to the juvenile court sys
tem.
A less common point of view is that stu
dents are adults and "should be prepared to
accept the consequences of their actions and
decisions," in Dean Gordon's phrase. The
preponderance of the first point of view—
in loco parentis—is a major cause of the
secrecy problem.
Investigation of these problems reveals that
they lie not in superficial structures but in
the basis on which the structure is founded.
"Judicial procedures," as Dave Harris has
said, "really aren't what they're passed off to
be that is, student self-government." The
problems which have arisen seem to call for
a re-evaluation of the system.
