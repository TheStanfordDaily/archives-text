# Judicial Compromises Result In Bifarity
## 
### JAMES BRISCOE (Second in a series) 
Implicit in the bifarious nature of
the present judicial system and its at
tempt to serve "both God and mam
mon" is recognition of the existence
of two sets of "rules" or "laws"
within the University.
The notion that ASSU "law" might
exist separate from University "law"
is not new, dating at least from Fall
Quarter, 1962 when the Legislature de
creed that ASSU liquor policy "shall
be in accordance with state law," thus
conflicting with the administration's
ban of liquor on campus. However, it
was not until the judicial shakeup of
1965 that the concept of "conflict in
law" was built into the system.
Dissatisfaction
Dissatisfaction with judicial pro
cesses had long existed, both among
students who felt that student partici
pation in the system was essentially
token and in the Deans' office, where
some administrators wondered if the
Deans' role as judges might not im
pair their ability to act as counselors.
It was the much-publicized "Frank
Morse Case" in the spring of 1964,

however, which first brought wide
spread campus attention to the issue.
Morse was charged with willfully
breaking a door panel at the Stanford
Italian campus on the last day of
residence of Group VII. He was tried
by the student council at the cam
pus and given five work hours at the
corporation yard at Stanford.
Suspension
However, when he returned to the
home campus, Morse was informed
by Dean of Students H. Donald Win
gibler that he had been suspended for
the quarter.
Morse complained that he had never
been informed of the precise nature
of the charges against him, and at
tempted to appeal the decision.
The student Judicial Council main
tained that any review of the case
and any appeal should be handled by
them, and retried the case in an open
hearing. They recommended a sen
tence of ten corp yard hours for
Morse and another student involved
in the incident. However, the Deans'
office declared the case closed and
Morse's suspension stood.
The issue continued to simmer,
nonetheless.

At the start of the 1964-65 school
year, Vice-Provost Robert Wert set up
a committee to look into appeal pro
cedures, while Darrell Halverson,
chairman of Judicial Council during
the Morse affair, began work on a
report on the irregularities in the
handling of that case.
Halverson was joined by Nora Crow,
former chairman of Women's Coun
cil. Together they prepared a report
on student judiciary-administration
relations, stating that the "working
relationship" between the Deans' office
and the student judicial councils had
virtually broken down.
The report questioned certain aspects
of Dean Winbigler's handling of the
Morse case and charged that Dean of
Women Lucile Allen failed to "recog
nize Women's Council as an inde
pendent organization," but rather
"considers it part of her administra
tive staff."
Miss Crow and Halverson also ques
tioned the ability of an administrator
to function as both counselor and
disciplinairian and suggested a per
manent appeals board with the power
of ultimate decision. The report al
leged that Dean Allen had attempted

to convince several members of Wom
en's Council to gather information
about the use of "salacious material"
by English instructors in their fresh
man classes.
The report was published in The
Stanford Dally, on Feb. 4, 1965. The
following evening, the Legislature ap
proved by a narrow margin a resolu
tion asserting "the ASSU shall have
sole jurisdiction over student affairs
and conduct."
Amendment
Three weeks later a by-laws amend
ment was overwhelmingly adopted de
fining more precisely the ASSU's posi
tion on judicial competence.
The amendment provided that stu
dent judicial councils could render
judgment on violations of Univer
sity policy only when such policy had
been approved by a two-thirds vote
of LASSU.
In response to this action, a joint
meeting of the Committee on Uni
versity Policy (COUP) and the ad
visory board of the Academic Council
called for designated "faculty and Uni
versity officer members of COUP to
meet with appropriately constituted
representatives of the student govern

ment" to explore the dispute over
judicial procedures.
The committee formed to study
the question consisted of five students,
five faculty members, and five ad
ministrative officials ,and was the
precursor of the present Committee
of Fifteen.
Views Differ
Views on the exact role of this com
mittee differ. Wert says its most val
uable function was to improve com
munication between the three con
stituencies, faculty members, adminis
trators ,and students. "It was quite
an education for us all,' 'he added.
On the other hand, Ed Shaw, Speak
er of Legislature at the time and a
student member of the committee,
characterized it as similar in func
tion to a labor negotiating body.
Shaw recalls wryly some lessons
learned, however. "Prof. McDonough
(John McDonough, School of Law)
would come in every day with his list
of proposals and topics to be dis
cussed. We soon learned to prepare
our own list, if we didn't want to
spend the entire period discussing
matters on his terms."
The committee was able to reach a

compromise on the issue of judicial
competence, however, which was ac
cepted with some modifications by the
ASSU Legislature, by COUP and the
Advisory Board of the Academic
Council.
The resolution approved by the com
mittee reasserted that original juris
diction of all cases should rest with
the students, unless a person ex
pressly requested that his case be
handled by the Dean of Students.
On the question of conflicts in law
between the ASSU and the University,
the resolution provides that student
judicial councils must enforce all
University and ASSU policies, except
when a conflict exists between them,
when the ASSU "laws" are control
ling.
However, in the event of such a
conflict, the University may set up
separate faculty bodies to try the case.
The committee also recommended
a permanent Committee of Fifteen be
set up in which "duly appointed rep
resentatives of the Academic Coun
cil, President of the University and
the Legislature meet to discuss Uni
versity problems and policies.
