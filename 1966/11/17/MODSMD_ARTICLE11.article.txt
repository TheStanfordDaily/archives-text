Dear Miss Howell:
You have stated your position clearly and
forcefully and that this matter Is one of great Import
ance to you I have no doubt. However, as for your
request that the matter be acted on by the Board of
Trustees at the November 17th meeting, let me respect
fully call your attention to the following aspects of
the matter:
1. The Board of Trustees would not act In an
area of this kind except after a full report by the
President of the University, and I find It difficult
to believe that such a report would be available within
a week.
2. For many years Stanford has been a
residence university Insofar as women undergraduate
students are concerned, and In light of this long
custom and tradition It Is unlikely, In my personal
opinion, that this longstanding policy will be reversed
without considering all aspects of the matter - of
which there are many.
3. Insofar as discrimination as between men
and women are concerned in the matter of campus living,
it may well be that if there were sufficient university
residences available for all Stanford undergraduate
men, they too might be required to live on campus. As
a long range objective Stanford has expressed its inten
tion to be a residence university.
4. When you chose to come to Stanford you
must have known its longstanding policy in respect to
resident requirements and you were free to choose
Stanford or another institution where the rules are
different. In other words, I cannot frankly see what
ever may be the merits of your position that you can
logically expect from your personal standpoint a pre
cipitous change in a condition which has prevailed for
many years.
Very truly yours,
See story on page 1.
