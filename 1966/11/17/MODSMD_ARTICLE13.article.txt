# Econ 190 Learns Accounting Playing Game Of 'Simulation'
## 
### WILL HUBBS 
Econ 190 is experiencing a
new and interesting way to
learn accounting: it plays
"games."
In a Daily interview, Lyle
Jacobson, Asst. Professor of Ac
counting in the Graduate School
of Business explained the game,
Simulation, first tried in the
Graduate School of Business in
Lima, Peru.

Prof. Jacobson brought hi 6
"game" supplement to Econ 190
after using it in executive de
velopment programs and in the
regular student Masters pro
gram at the Stanford-founded
school in Lima.
Ten Companies
For the simulation, Econ 190
is divided into two industries of
five companies each. Competi
tion is limited to companies (5-6

students) with an industry. Stu
dents are asked to make deci
sions about the purchase of raw
materials; they then prepare
bids which are reviewed by the
market, or supplier — the prof.
The market awards purchase of
raw materials to the companies.
After the student companies
make decisions about the pro
duction and sales of finished
goods, they make a final offer to
the market.
Monopoly
Prof. Jacobson expressed keen
interest in the yet-undecided out
come of the simulation. The
game lasts two weeks per quar
ter, and is now in the fourth of
six quarters. In Lima the simu
lation "ended up in a monopoly
situation — one dominant com
pany." Jacobson theorized that
a monopoly might have been a
characteristic Latin American
solution; he is interested in see
ing if Stanford students can
come up with a more competi
tive solution.
Prof. Jacobson listed the simu
lation's objectives:
• "for students to become ac
tivists in the preparing of finan
cial statements for decision mak
ing purposes."
• "to gain insights into what
data is necessary for various de
cisions.
• "to get some impressions of
how business enterprise oper
ates."
After four quarters of play,
Jacobson sees the simulation as
"definitely good for capturing
enthusiasm." Professor Jacob
son does see a future for "busi
ness games," which were first
developed five or six years ago.
A critical appraisal of the Econ
190 game must wait until its
companies win or lose their eco
nomic game. But then maybe
how they play is more im
portant.

game lasts two weeks per quar
ter, and is now in the fourth of
six quarters. In Lima the simu
lation "ended up in a monopoly
situation — one dominant com
pany." Jacobson theorized that
a monopoly might have been a
characteristic Latin American
solution; he is interested in see
ing if Stanford students can
come up with a more competi
tive solution.
Prof. Jacobson listed the simu
lation's objectives:
• "for students to become ac
tivists in the preparing of finan
cial statements for decision mak
ing purposes."
• "to gain insights into what
data is necessary for various de
cisions.
• "to get some impressions of
how business enterprise oper
ates."
After four quarters of play,
Jacobson sees the simulation as
"definitely good for capturing
enthusiasm." Professor Jacob
son does see a future for "busi
ness games," which were first
developed five or six years ago.
A critical appraisal of the Econ
190 game must wait until its
companies win or lose their eco
nomic game. But then maybe
how they play is more im
portant.
Econ 190 is experiencing a
new and interesting way to
learn accounting: it plays
"games."
In a Daily interview, Lyle
Jacobson, Asst. Professor of Ac
counting in the Graduate School
of Business explained the game,
Simulation, first tried in the
Graduate School of Business in
Lima, Peru.

Prof. Jacobson brought hi 6
"game" supplement to Econ 190
after using it in executive de
velopment programs and in the
regular student Masters pro
gram at the Stanford-founded
school in Lima.
Ten Companies
For the simulation, Econ 190
is divided into two industries of
five companies each. Competi
tion is limited to companies (5-6

students) with an industry. Stu
dents are asked to make deci
sions about the purchase of raw
materials; they then prepare
bids which are reviewed by the
market, or supplier — the prof.
The market awards purchase of
raw materials to the companies.
After the student companies
make decisions about the pro
duction and sales of finished
goods, they make a final offer to
the market.
Monopoly
Prof. Jacobson expressed keen
interest in the yet-undecided out
come of the simulation. The
game lasts two weeks per quar
ter, and is now in the fourth of
six quarters. In Lima the simu
lation "ended up in a monopoly
situation — one dominant com
