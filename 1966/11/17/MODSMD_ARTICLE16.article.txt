# ACLU Asks Colleges To Resist Subpoenas
## 
### 
The American Civil Liberties
Union last Sunday wrote to 900
college and university presidents
across the nation, urging them
to resist any future subpoena
by the House Committee on Un-
American Activities for the
membership lists of campus or
ganizations.
The plea came in the wake of
HUAC's subpoenas of member
ship lists at Berkeley and the
the University of Michigan.
According to the ACLU, the
Committee's action was "one of
the most serious breaches of
academic freedom in recent de
cades, not excluding the Mc-
Carthy era."
Last summer on the advice of
university attorneys, Stanford
officials submitted the names of
the officers of several campus
organizations to the Committee.
President Sterling has received
a letter from the ACLU, and this
letter is presently under study
by university officials.
The ACLU's letter asked uni
versity leaders to take steps

against the danger posed by the
HUAC action. Urging the col
leges to "resist, in every possi
ble legal manner, subpoenas
seeking membership lists," the
ACLU said there i6 a strong
likelihood that if universities
did contest a subpoenia in the
courts such a challenge would
be upheld. In support of its posi
tion ,the ACLU cited several
Supreme Court decisions whicn
uphold the privacy of organiza
tion membership lists.
The ACLU pressed
and universities to issue public
statements "expressing concers
over threats to academic free
dom." These statements, th*
Union declared, should also as
sert "determination, if the sit
uation should arise, to refuse te
comply" with HUAC subpoenal
The ACLU said it was prepare®
to lend legal assistance to anf
university which believed its aca
demic freedom was
by HUAC. «
