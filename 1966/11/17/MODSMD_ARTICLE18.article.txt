# Ten Countries Submit Resolution To Seat Red China
## News In Brief Compiled From the Associated Press 
### 
UNITED NATIONS—Three Communist and
seven nonaligned countries submitted a resolu
tion yesterday to have the General Assembly
seat Red China in the United Nations and
expel Nationalist China.
The Communist countries are Albania, Cuba
and Romania. The others are Algeria, Cam
bodia, the Congo (Brazzaville), Guinea, Mali,
Pakistan and Syria.
The same 10 sponsored a somewhat similar
resolution last year along with Ghana and
Somalia. That resolution failed on a 47-47
tie vote when a two-thirds majority was
needed. Backers of Nationalist China predict a
vote of 55-48 against the new one.
Cambodia is expected to introduce the pro-
Communist resolution formally when it opens
the assembly's annual debate on the China
seating issue Friday morning.
In other developments, Japan's former For
eign Minister, Zentaro Kosaka, said yesterday
it would be a good thing if the U.N. General
Assembly "moved in the direction of granting
representation to Communist China."

Kosaka, in an interview, said, however, prac
tical circumstances which impede Peking's
admittance to the United Nations should not
be lost sight of .
• Birth Control Expanded
WASHINGTON—Wives of servicemen may
obtain free contraceptive devices and steriliza
tion operations at military hospitals under an
expanded birth control program being put
into effect by the defense departments.
Guidelines for the program, effective Jan
uary 1, provide that such an operation may
be performed if a dependent wife requests
it and if the attending physician is of the
opinion it would be "accordance with sound
medical practice in the particular case under
consideration."
• Colleges Want Decision
WASHINGTON—More than 200 state col
leges and universities joined yesterday a drive
to force federal court decision on the consti

tutionality of federal aid to church-related
schools.
The Association of State Colleges and Uni
versities departed from a joint legislative plank
with the National Association of State Uni
versities and Land-Grant Colleges in passing
the resolution.
The state college association's stand fol
lowed the U.S. Supreme Court's refusal Mon-

day to review a Maryland court decision that
declared unconstitutional grants of state
money to three church-affliated colleges.
• U.S. Aiding Viet Cong?
NORMAN, Okla.—A young Oklahoma Ma
rine says blood plasma and medical supplies

from America are helping the Communists
to keep their fighting forces in the field in
Vietnam.
"Why are Americans helping to kill us?" de
manded 20-year-old Corp. Donnie R. Fountain
of Norman in a letter to his parents, Mr. and
Mrs. Tommie Dee Fountain.
Fountain said four members of his patrol
were cut down by Viet Cong fire in a village
earlier this month. He said a Marine com
pany returned to the village the next day and
"besides finding the dead they found 15 tons
of rice, 6,000 rounds of red ammunition.
"They also found boxes of blood plasma and
medical supplies stamped 'Berkeley, Calif.' "
(In Washington, the Defense Department
said it had no knowledge of blood and re
lated supplies being shipped from this coun
try to the Viet Cong, or of any such supplies
being recovered from the Communist.)
• Johnson In Good Shape
WASHINGTON —President Johnson came
through a dual operation on his throat and

abdomen in good shape yesterday and his doc
tor said he is quite confident the President
would be as good as new by January 1.
Johnson had been concerned about the sur
gery and what he called the curtain hanging
over him. But his physicians said there was
no evidence of cancer.
• Meteorites Expected
NEW YORK—A once-in-a-lifetime shower ol
Leonid meteroites was expected to lighten up
American skies during last night, but the
weather bureau said clouds would keep most
groundbound watchers from seeing them.
Dr. Thomas D. Nicholson, chairman of the
Hayden Planetarium, said the meteorites be
gan to light up American skies early yester
day morning, falling at the rate of 15 to
20 an hour.
He said before the shower finishes it max
imum display early this morning brilliant
meteroites probably would be falling at a
rate of 250 an hour which might lead people
to call it"the night the stars fell."

Vietnam.
"Why are Americans helping to kill us?" de
manded 20-year-old Corp. Donnie R. Fountain
of Norman in a letter to his parents, Mr. and

Fountain said four members of his patrol
were cut down by Viet Cong fire in a village
earlier this month. He said a Marine com
pany returned to the village the next day and
"besides finding the dead they found 15 tons
of rice, 6,000 rounds of red ammunition.

medical supplies stamped 'Berkeley, Calif.' "

being recovered from the Communist.)
• Johnson In Good Shape
WASHINGTON —President Johnson came
through a dual operation on his throat and

abdomen in good shape yesterday and his doc
tor said he is quite confident the President
would be as good as new by January 1.
Johnson had been concerned about the sur
gery and what he called the curtain hanging
over him. But his physicians said there was
no evidence of cancer.
• Meteorites Expected
NEW YORK—A once-in-a-lifetime shower ol
Leonid meteroites was expected to lighten up
American skies during last night, but the
weather bureau said clouds would keep most
groundbound watchers from seeing them.
Dr. Thomas D. Nicholson, chairman of the
Hayden Planetarium, said the meteorites be
gan to light up American skies early yester
day morning, falling at the rate of 15 to
20 an hour.
He said before the shower finishes it max
imum display early this morning brilliant
meteroites probably would be falling at a
rate of 250 an hour which might lead people
to call it"the night the stars fell."
UNITED NATIONS—Three Communist and
seven nonaligned countries submitted a resolu
tion yesterday to have the General Assembly
seat Red China in the United Nations and
expel Nationalist China.
The Communist countries are Albania, Cuba
and Romania. The others are Algeria, Cam
bodia, the Congo (Brazzaville), Guinea, Mali,
Pakistan and Syria.
The same 10 sponsored a somewhat similar
resolution last year along with Ghana and
Somalia. That resolution failed on a 47-47
tie vote when a two-thirds majority was
needed. Backers of Nationalist China predict a
vote of 55-48 against the new one.
Cambodia is expected to introduce the pro-
Communist resolution formally when it opens
the assembly's annual debate on the China
seating issue Friday morning.
In other developments, Japan's former For
eign Minister, Zentaro Kosaka, said yesterday
it would be a good thing if the U.N. General
Assembly "moved in the direction of granting
representation to Communist China."

Kosaka, in an interview, said, however, prac
tical circumstances which impede Peking's
admittance to the United Nations should not
be lost sight of .
• Birth Control Expanded
WASHINGTON—Wives of servicemen may
obtain free contraceptive devices and steriliza
tion operations at military hospitals under an
expanded birth control program being put
into effect by the defense departments.
Guidelines for the program, effective Jan
uary 1, provide that such an operation may
be performed if a dependent wife requests
it and if the attending physician is of the
opinion it would be "accordance with sound
medical practice in the particular case under
consideration."
• Colleges Want Decision
WASHINGTON—More than 200 state col
leges and universities joined yesterday a drive
to force federal court decision on the consti

tutionality of federal aid to church-related
schools.
The Association of State Colleges and Uni
versities departed from a joint legislative plank
with the National Association of State Uni
versities and Land-Grant Colleges in passing
the resolution.
The state college association's stand fol
lowed the U.S. Supreme Court's refusal Mon-

day to review a Maryland court decision that
declared unconstitutional grants of state
money to three church-affliated colleges.
