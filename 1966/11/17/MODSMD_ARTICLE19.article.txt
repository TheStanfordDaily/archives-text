# 'AAAUUGH!' Rated Musical Success
## 
### CURT KECK Entertainment Editor 
"Okay, everybody up for the
kick-off." The crammed stands
gave a torrential cheer as the
Ram's Head 1966 Big Game
Gaieties took its place to receive
the kick. A single, silent prayer
brought all the Gaieties rooters
to one mind: "Com'on you In
dians don't fumble, don't let it
slip through that grease paint."
If Ram's Head was to tri
umph in yet one more of these
annual bouts, the opposing team
(boo—hiss) — Calcified Abcess
on the Larnyx or Cataclysmic
Acting Largess (CAL) — would
have to be trampled in encores.
The kick by CAL, always a for
midable threat, went deep into
the Ram's Head end zone. The
crowd shrieked, "AAAUUGH,"
as the touchdown potential slip
ped through the fingers of deep
man Joel Mills and was then
bobbled by Alan Mokler. Was
all lost? No, streaking out of
the sideline shadows, the re
doubtable wingtip-tailback com

bo, Robert Sevra and Ronee
Blakeley, scooped up the prize
and lugged it to a touchdown
and eventual victory. And the
band played on.
Notably less purient than past
successes, the Ram's Head pro
duction combines the best of
costuming, scenery, music and
orchestrations in a grand song
fest that scitters in your feet
and snaps in your fingers long
after the finale.
Episodic Plot
In author-director Joel Mills'
episodic plot, the Kremlin's In
security Committee, fearing es
pionage hanky-panky camou
flaged in the pomp and gore of
Big Game, dispatches Russia's
foremost female spy, Mata Hari
ovitch, on her first big assign
ment. She teams up with com
rade Branovitch at Stanford and
together they tip-toe through
the cloisters attempting to un
cover the capitalist skulldug
gery behind Big Game.
A secondary plot-line of Wil
bur Hall's super-sponsor, Peter

Dagger combatting the frustra
tions of The Mothers Club, a
rich alumna, a hungry Roble
sponsor, and an epileptic frosh
dolly swerves in and out of the
Hariovitch and Branovitch an
tics.
All ends happily witn every
one in love and Mata Hariovitch
the proud possessor of Brano
vitch's heart and the Insecurity
Committee' praise, despite
Hariovitch's unwitting efforts to
bungle her assignment.
It is surprising to find that
the glitter and gaiety of the pro
duction can filter through an
ill-conceived and porous plot.
Joel Mills seems to have blown
his mind in the zaniness of the
script. Few of the gags come off
and the two plot lines never
mesh.
Never in the show was it ap
parent that the theme of Big
Game was at all integral to the
production. With a few minor
alterations, a spoof of the Chi
Psi Pie Eating Contest or the
Zete Lagunity Seca could have
been substituted for the Big
Game and none, save the au
thor, would have been the wiser.
The Big Game motif seems con
ceived strictly as a convenient
theme for theme's sake.
Virtuoso Performance
Robert Sevra, as Peter Dag
ger, surpassed his virtuoso per
formance last year in "Lysis
trata'.' Mr. Sevra has the voice
and confidence on stage of a
Broadway veteran. He por
trayed to perfection the tribula
tions of the handsome BMOC
who is continually under fire

from The Mother's Club, a frosh
dolly, a girl sponsor, and the
rich alumna Talula Bulkhead
(Lindi Press).
The chorus, directed by Car
rick Patterson, was difficult to
understand at times, but on the
whole sang well in unison.
Christi Atkinson's choreography
gave a liveliness to the show.
Particularly the CIA and the
ballet numbers were artfully
done.
The costuming also added
much to the show. Mata Hario
vitch's cigarette girl and Bat
man disguises and Mandolino
vitch's Beethoven attire add
spice and hilarity to the show.
For most intensive purposes
the finale of the show came in
Act 11, Scene 11, with Polly
Adams, as Nance the Roble
Sponsor, and Robert Serva sing
ing "I Wonder," an imaginative
number sung flawlessly.
Crazy, Wild, Bumbling:
Miss Adams' other song, "The
Merry-Go-'Round," was also a
high point of the production as
was Miss Blakeley's "Mata's
Waltz."
In the lead Ronee Blakeley
turned in a fine performance as
Mata Hario. She was crazy, wild,
bumbling, and always unedu
cated in the subleties of espion
age.
The dispeptic Branovitch,
Alan Mokler, was never force
ful enough to attract any atten
tion. Even in his major songs
and speeches, he always seemed
to be a cipher. In a moment of
pelrcention, Branovitch moaned,

"I get tired of being a supervis
or for a static process." In
"AAUUGH", Mr. Mokler unfor
tunately added to that process.
Playing Dolly, Becky White
house put into words and
actions the exact image that
Stanford's frat set was conjured
up to describe the freshman
girl. She was fantastic and
Ram's Head is luck to have her
around for three more years.
Dick Livermore and Ridge
Watson as Insecurity Commit
tee heads, Brezhnev and Kosy
gin, were both excellent in their
performances. Their Ruski ac
cents and loud arrogant com
mands did much to set the stage
of the Insecurity Committee.
The CIA agents, George Howe,
Joe Califf, Dave Miller, and
Susan Holmes expertly handled
the tricky disected dialogue.
When Miss Holmes left the CIA
to find more agreeable compan
ionship with the Russian man
dolin playing and singing idol,
Mandolinovitch (Bill Graham),
the CIA agents lost their punch
lines and havoc ensued. Their
uncompleted lines completed
comic appeal as a group.
The music, composed by Ted
Lau and Alan Mowler and di
rected by Errol Gay, was indeed
the stalward on which the whole
production leaned. The dozen
musical numbers and sundry
other smaller arrangements
were in the jazz mood and
always blended into the show.
The opportunity to hear the or
chestra is well worth the price
of admission.
