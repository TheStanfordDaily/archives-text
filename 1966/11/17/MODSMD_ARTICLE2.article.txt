# SU To Build New Hospital?
## 
### 
President J. E. Wallace Sterling of
ficially announced the University's in
tention to build a new hospital on the
site of the Palo Alto-Stanford Hos
pital Center. In a letter to Palo Alto
Mayor Frances Dias, President Ster
ling made formal response to the
City Council's rejection of the Uni
versity's offer to purchase Palo Alto's
wing of the now jointly owned Palo
Alto-Stanford Hospital.
Frederic O. Glover, Executive As
sistant to President Sterling, stressed
that the letter represented "no new
development" in negotiations concern
ing the hospital. The purpose of the
letter was to put the University's in
tentions "formally on the record." It
had been previously indicated that if
the City Council should not accept
the University's offer of purchase,
Stanford would proceed with plans
for the construction of its own hos
pital.
History Of Negotiations
President Sterling's letter is the
most recent consequence of over one
and a half years of investigation
and discussion concerning the hos
pital. Discussion of the possible ter
mination of joint-ownership started
in May of 1965 when the then city
manager Jerry Keithley indicated that
joint operation of the hospital "had
not worked smoothly." Not until
January of 1966 was a concrete sug
gestion made. On the recommenda
tion of Dean Robert Glaser of the
Medical School, President Sterling
asked the City Council to negotiate
terms "whereby the University could
acquire the Palo Alto-Stanford Hospi
tal." This request was met with seven
months of inaction by the council.
Stanford then made its purchase offer
of five million dollars and was turned
down.
The University's desire for expan
sion of the present hospital system
has stemmed from a shortage of hos
pital beds and a lack of teaching
facilities. Difficulties arising from
joint-ownership of the hospital have
also been named as motivation for
the University's purchase offer. Prob
lems of duplication of equipment for
purposes of research and patient care
have caused unnecessary inconven
ience and expense. The Palo Alto-
Stanford Hospital presently utilizes
two X-ray departments.
Medical School sources report that
no definite plans have been made
concerning the proposed new hospital
and that extensive negotiations would
be necessary before plans could be
formulated.
