## 
### 
The Experiment, Stanford's
new voluntary student organi
zation, is beginning this week
to put together its catalogue for
winter quarter seminars, ac
cording to coordinator Barry
Greenberg.
Members of the Stanford
Community are invited to sub
mit proposals for seminars they
"would like to see conducted
through Experiment auspices.
Deadline for such proposals is
Wednesday, November 23. They
may be sent to the Experiment,
c/o ASSU, Stanford, Calif.
"The Experiment is particu
larly anxious," says Greenberg,
"to receive seminar proposals
from undergraduate and faculty
members. Almost all of the fail
seminars are being conducted
by graduate students and we
would like to get more diver
sity."
In order to get the seminars
underway at the very beginning
of winter quarter, The Experi
ment will conduct a pre-regis
tration period on December 5,
6, 7.
