# THE 						ISSUE:
## WHOM DOES BUSINESS WANT?

Dear Mr. Kokalas:
Business has room for every type of college
graduate including the liberal arts major.
I'll admit that the English major may have to
look a little harder than the engineer. But
consider some of the possibilities. There's
plenty of room, as well as a definite need, for
this kind of background in advertising, public
relations and employee relations, marketing
and sales —in publishing companies, in firms
developing educational tools and in banks,
insurance companies, and brokerage houses.
Every successful organization needs men who
know how to analyze, how to reach conclu
sions, and how to communicate.
The language major can look into possibilities
with companies that have large foreign sales
or factories in other countries. At Motorola
we're planning to construct a major facility
in Toulouse. Obviously, we'll be needing
some personnel who can communicate fluently
in French.
Often, the non-technically trained young man,
or generalist, will find after a few years of
on-the-job experience that he's absorbed
enough specific knowledge to move freely
across a wide range of activities. A social
science major may not know how to construct
or design a computer, but he certainly can
make some pertinent observations on its po
tential uses and how it might be programmed.
A history major may be ideally suited to use
his training, mind, and perspective as an in
vestment analyst—studying the growth and
development of modern corporations.
Actually, the academic background of busi
nessmen is quite varied. Recently, Fortune
surveyed more than 1,000 businessmen. They
found that one-fourth studied engineering,
another quarter majored in business, a fifth
were social science majors, 12 per cent ma
jored in finance or accounting, and 11 per cent
had a background in the humanities. That's
quite a range of interests, and one that's essen
tial to the constantly changing, diverse chal
lenges confronting today's businessman.
In recent years, most large companies have
expended a considerable amount of money
and effort on programs of continuing educa
tion for their employees. They know that the
ability to adapt to change requires new think
ing and knowledge that will link past, present,
and future. Courses in the humanities and
the social sciences are offered to engineers
and scientists. Management personnel are en
couraged to familiarize themselves with the
new technologies and to upgrade their man
agerial and decision-making skills.

This is the fourth round in an exchange of ideas and opin
ions between Robert IV. Calvin, Motorola Chairman, and
Edward Kokalas, Michigan State student. The subject: busi
ness. What do college students think about the business
world? How does it measure up to other career choices?
What are its strengths and weaknesses?
Mr. Calvin's words answer one of the many issues raised by
Mr. Kokalas in a letter carried in this paper. Shortly, Mr.
Kokalas will have an opportunity to rebut and the dialogue
will continue as Jong as there are informative points to
be made.
This and 5 other dialogues are appearing regularly in col
lege papers throughout the country.

tion for individuals who wish to get their Mas
ters or Ph.D. degrees. This year, Motorola
undertook a new educational venture and
brought the campus to corporation headquar
ters. Through an arrangement with Northern
Illinois University, executives, without leav
ing the building, can take courses leading to
an M.B.A. or an M.S. in Business Administra
tion. Or they can participate in these or other
classes for no credit at all—simply to stretch
their minds and broaden their viewpoints.
I think, however, that the issue of technician
or generalist is one that is still unresolved.
Every year brings another chapter in the great
debate —education for what? Underlying this
discussion, is the fear, shared by many in
business and education, that the liberal arts
and the humanities will become passe. That
the clamor and demand for specialists will
turn us into a country of technocrats. That
the time is coming when a B.A. will be looked
on as an educational drop-out.
This cannot and should not happen. We need
the technician and the generalist. More im
portantly, we need men in both areas who
understand the language and the environment
of the other. We need men who have compre
hensive and flexible outlooks —engineers who
can talk to marketing people; writers who
understand the potentials of computers and
automation. People who understand and are
interested in other people.
Evolutionary changes are obviously in order.
University deans must take a long, hard look
at curricula —at the goals and objectives of
higher education. Business will have to show
the student and educator, over and over again,
that it practices what it preaches. That the
personnel director really understands what
the president or board chairman is talking
about.
I'm not surprised that the arts student some
times feels left out of the recruiting rush. I
do think, however, the pendulum is beginning
to swing back. You don't hear much talk any
more about the science gap and the knowl
edge gap. You do hear a lot of talk about the
people gap —or the understanding gap.
Technology can only take a company so far
it must be supplemented by individuals with
vision and understanding to organize that
technology into products and services to help
other people. A biochemist can discover a
new drug —but he needs non-scientific part
ners to get that drug into hospitals and doc
tors' offices.

This cannot and should not happen. We need
the technician and the generalist. More im

can talk to marketing people; writers who
understand the potentials of computers and
automation. People who understand and are
interested in other people.

Dear Mr. Kokalas:
Business has room for every type of college
graduate including the liberal arts major.
I'll admit that the English major may have to
look a little harder than the engineer. But
consider some of the possibilities. There's
plenty of room, as well as a definite need, for
this kind of background in advertising, public
relations and employee relations, marketing
and sales —in publishing companies, in firms
developing educational tools and in banks,
insurance companies, and brokerage houses.
Every successful organization needs men who
know how to analyze, how to reach conclu
sions, and how to communicate.
The language major can look into possibilities
with companies that have large foreign sales
or factories in other countries. At Motorola
we're planning to construct a major facility
in Toulouse. Obviously, we'll be needing
some personnel who can communicate fluently
in French.
Often, the non-technically trained young man,
or generalist, will find after a few years of
on-the-job experience that he's absorbed
enough specific knowledge to move freely
across a wide range of activities. A social
science major may not know how to construct
or design a computer, but he certainly can
make some pertinent observations on its po
tential uses and how it might be programmed.
A history major may be ideally suited to use
his training, mind, and perspective as an in
vestment analyst—studying the growth and
development of modern corporations.
Actually, the academic background of busi
nessmen is quite varied. Recently, Fortune
surveyed more than 1,000 businessmen. They
found that one-fourth studied engineering,
another quarter majored in business, a fifth
were social science majors, 12 per cent ma
jored in finance or accounting, and 11 per cent
had a background in the humanities. That's
quite a range of interests, and one that's essen
tial to the constantly changing, diverse chal
lenges confronting today's businessman.
In recent years, most large companies have
expended a considerable amount of money
and effort on programs of continuing educa
tion for their employees. They know that the
ability to adapt to change requires new think
ing and knowledge that will link past, present,
and future. Courses in the humanities and
the social sciences are offered to engineers
and scientists. Management personnel are en
couraged to familiarize themselves with the
new technologies and to upgrade their man
agerial and decision-making skills.

This is the fourth round in an exchange of ideas and opin

Edward Kokalas, Michigan State student. The subject: busi
ness. What do college students think about the business
world? How does it measure up to other career choices?
What are its strengths and weaknesses?
Mr. Calvin's words answer one of the many issues raised by
Mr. Kokalas in a letter carried in this paper. Shortly, Mr.
Kokalas will have an opportunity to rebut and the dialogue
will continue as Jong as there are informative points to
be made.

an M.B.A. or an M.S. in Business Administra

the time is coming when a B.A. will be looked
on as an educational drop-out.
This cannot and should not happen. We need
the technician and the generalist. More im

understand the language and the environment

can talk to marketing people; writers who
understand the potentials of computers and

interested in other people.

Dear Mr. Kokalas:
Business has room for every type of college
graduate including the liberal arts major.
I'll admit that the English major may have to
look a little harder than the engineer. But
consider some of the possibilities. There's
plenty of room, as well as a definite need, for
this kind of background in advertising, public
relations and employee relations, marketing
and sales —in publishing companies, in firms
developing educational tools and in banks,
insurance companies, and brokerage houses.
Every successful organization needs men who
know how to analyze, how to reach conclu
sions, and how to communicate.
The language major can look into possibilities
with companies that have large foreign sales
or factories in other countries. At Motorola
we're planning to construct a major facility
in Toulouse. Obviously, we'll be needing
some personnel who can communicate fluently
in French.
Often, the non-technically trained young man,
or generalist, will find after a few years of
on-the-job experience that he's absorbed
enough specific knowledge to move freely
across a wide range of activities. A social
science major may not know how to construct
or design a computer, but he certainly can
make some pertinent observations on its po
tential uses and how it might be programmed.
A history major may be ideally suited to use
his training, mind, and perspective as an in
vestment analyst—studying the growth and
development of modern corporations.
Actually, the academic background of busi
nessmen is quite varied. Recently, Fortune
surveyed more than 1,000 businessmen. They
found that one-fourth studied engineering,
another quarter majored in business, a fifth
were social science majors, 12 per cent ma
jored in finance or accounting, and 11 per cent
had a background in the humanities. That's
