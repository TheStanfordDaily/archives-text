# Gain Mural Playoffs
## Neutrinos Down Psychedelics 
### BOB EGELKO 
Burke Jackson hit Steve
Agard with a 35-yard scoring
pass and ran one in himself
from a yard out to lead the
Neutrinos to a 12-7 decision over
the Psychedelics and complete
an undefeated intramural foot
ball season yesterday.
Agard, whose nine receptions
were instrumental in the Neu
trinos' successful ball-control
game, slipped behind his de
fender on a third and long yard
age situation to take Jackson's
floating toss the first time his
team had the ball.
Last-Minute Score
Two interceptions by Bruce
Thompson kept the Psychedelics
bottled up most of the first half,
and the Neutrinos got moving
again shortly before halftime on
a Jackson pass to Dick Zdarko,
who took the ball away from
two defenders. Jackson scored
on a sweep with 45 seconds left.
The psychology squad got its

short passing attack rolling
after the break, as Bob Madix,
often firing without a huddle,
moved his team sixty yards in
short spurts, and finally found
Ed Sadalla in the end zone with
3:30 left. Madix' conversion pass
was successful, and the Neu
trinos were faced with the task
of holding onto the ball for over
three minutes.
Jackson made it look easy,
however, as he connected on a
third-down option pass, found
Zdarko on a third-and-five play
and ran for another first down
that left the physics team ten
yards from its opponents' goal
line as the game ended.
The victory gave the Neutri
nos one of the two graduate
league championships (the Dis
locations having clinched the
other last week) and relegated
the Psychedelics to third, as
Beta Biz gained a playoff spot
with a come-from-behind 21-7
win over Law.

The "B" playoff semifinals
found Theta Delt breezing by
Donner, 27-0 and Phil Kap hold
ing off Blackacre, 6-0. Several in
juries to Theta Delt players
have forced the final game, orig-

inally set for this afternoon, to
be rescheduled for next week.
Two league titles are up for
grabs in today's three-game
football slate. The Phi Kaps,
who have survived several close

calls to post six straight wins,
face a Phi Sig team which has
not lost since it dropped an over
time decision to Sigma Chi early
in the season.
Tie Possible
A Phi Kap win would send it
and Alpha Omega (formerly
Sigma Chi) to Monday's play
offs, but a Phi Sig victory would
throw the league into a three
way tie.
A four-way deadlock will be
untangled in another fraternity
league today when the Delts
play the Zetes and Lambda Nu
meets Kappa Alpha in re
matches of games played earlier
this week.
Upset victories by the Zetes
and KA's gave two losses to
each of the four teams. Today's
winners will become co-cham
pions as far as the point totals
are concerned, with the team
with the widest margin of vic
tory getting the first-place play
off seed.
