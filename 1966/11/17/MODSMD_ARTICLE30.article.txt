# Elections— A Joke?
## 
### 
It is difficult enough nowadays to find stu
dents who will take a campus election seriously.
The manner in which elections have been
handled this year makes it a wonder that the
process survives.
The first problem this quarter arose over the
confusion regarding the presence of the "OFF"
proposition on the October 31 ballot. Janet
Howell, who initiated the movement to allow
women to live off campus, did not know the
measure would be on the ballot until the day
voting began. This, in effect, denied the pro
ponents of the initiative the traditional week
of campaigning.
A more basic problem that day, however,
was that the election was not scheduled to be
held until the following day. The Legislature
had set November 1 and 2 as the dates for this
election.
Elections Commissioner Bill Berry was un
fortunately not up to date on either question.
He was just planning for a yell leader election
and learned the Friday before that the "OFF''
issue would be on the ballot. "The whole thing
is a mess," he later commented to The Daily.
Indeed, it was a mess. Apparently there had
been no communication at all among the per
sons involved.
We had hoped that after this confusing series
of events, there would be no more problems
in communication in the following election.
However, when contacted last Sunday, the Elec
tions Commissioner told The Daily there would
be no voting for off-campus LASSU representa
tives on the next day's ballot. Evidently the
was as surprised as we were the
next day when he found the names of LASSU
candidates on his ballot.

In addition, we found the arrangements for
this election strikingly amateurish. Admist the
bedlam around the voting tables, one male stu
dent proudly announced that he had signed the
register with someone else's name. "Last time,"
he elaborated, "I stated my campus residence as
Flo Mo.'"
We also wonder if the Elections Commis
sioner realizes that students living on campus
could on yesterday's ballot vote for off-campus
Legislature representatives. Legislature may not
be the most representative democratic body
in existence, but we can certainly make a bet
ter effort than this. In past years, students living
on campus have had this part of their ballots
crossed out.
Another problem concerns the votes cast for
Wendy G, Wonka in the Homecoming Queen
election. There are reasons to believe that
Wendy received strong support at the polls,
perhaps even more votes than the number cast
for the winner. The write-in campaign for
Wendy was initiated as a protest against the
idea of having a Homecoming Queen and those
who went out of their way to express them
selves on this question should not have been
ignored, even if Cardinals Board had to com
promise its own interests.
The results of yesterday's Homecoming
Queen proposition certainly left no doubts that
the Board short-changed the student body in
the original election.
If the so-called democratic process is to sur
vive on this campus, then care should be given
to insure that students will have at least a
minimum of confidence in the aspect that most
concerns them—voting.
