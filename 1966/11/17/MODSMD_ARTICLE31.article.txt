# Today And Tomorrow
## Report From Europe 
### Walter Lippmann 
What struck me most in West
ern Europe was how far theory
has been overtaken and sur
passed by the facts. The ideas
and issues we have been so hot
and bothered about during my
lifetime have in these days be
come largely irrelevant, like old
maps of cities that are being re
built or the snapshots and the
invitations and the theater pro
grams which we accumulated
when we were young.
The old fighting faiths have
faded out, and for the genera
tion that has grown up since
the war they are for the most
part curiosities that are no long
er interesting.
The modern world, as I am
using the term, is the world that
is being shaped by the new in
dustrial revolution of this cen
tury. Its core is, of course, the
very rapid technological ad
vance, indeed explosion, which
includes the whole gamut of in
ventions from the jet engine and
computers to the synthetic fibers
and the contraceptives, the al
most indescribable multitude of
products of nuclear, electronic,
chemical, metallurgical, medical
and agricultural ingenuity.
An integral element of the
new industrial revolution is the
growing knowledge of how to
manage a modem economy for
the promotion of progressive af
fluence.
Out of Date
In the advanced countries the
kind of life men are living today
was not even imagined when
they were still at school. There
fore they are not prepared for
it. Because their ideas are out
of date while their lives are be
ing changed so rapidly, modern
men are driven to concentrate
their attention and their ener
gies on working out the detailed
consequences of change for
themselves and their families.
They have become, they have
had to become, "pragmatic" in
the sense that they deal with the
details of living and making a
living and have put aside the
great world. They do not have
the ambition to participate in
history and to shape the future.
Modern men are predominant
ly isolationist. They are preoc
cupied with the more immediate

things which may help or hurt
them. Their state of mind is
marked by a vast indifference
to big issues, and in this indif
ference there is a feeling that
they are incompetent to do much
about the big issues.
This indifferent ism can best
be understood, I think, by noting
how the conflict between capital
ism and communism, which has
dominated so much of the
world's public passion for 50
years, is being transformed by
the evolution of events.
The technological revolution
of our time has made obsolete
"capitalism" as it was under
stood at the beginning of this
century, as it is still understood
by romantic reactionaries like
Barry Goldwater. And "commu
nism" as it was conceived by
Lenin or by Marx before him
does not describe what is actual
ly going on in the Soviet Union.
There are now so many va
rieties of social organization —
in the United States, France,
Germany, Scandinavia, Yugosla
via and the Soviet Union itself
— that only a pedant or a fana
tic could pretend to draw a line
where the market economy ends
and central planning begins. The
differences between capitalism
and communism are ceasing to
be ideological and are becoming
increasingly managerial and
technical.
New Foundations
The torrent of changes has
washed away the foundations
of the structures built up be
cause of the cold war. Thus,
when the Common Market was
conceived after World War 11,
it was thought of as the core
of a new Western anti-Commu
nist state which would stand
guard as a great power against
Eastern Europe and the Soviet
Union. That conception has been
generally abandoned, and the
Common Market has been cut
down to a size where it is a suc
cessful Western European eco
nomic union which may, indeed
should, be opened and enlarged
to include more and more of
Europe.
There has also been a decay
of the NATO military establish
ment. Men have simply ceased
to believe what they took for

granted when, under Gen.
Dwight EisenTiower as supreme
commander, the NATO estab
lishment was put together. The
proof of this is that the United
States, Britain and Germany are
arguing about the exchange
costs of their troops. If they
really believed these troops were
vital to their security, the argu
ment would be regarded as dis
graceful.
Along with the decay of such
a great and reputable postwar
institution as the NATO estab
lishment, there is a resounding
indifference and lack of interest
in the traditional rhetoric of
power politics. The old notions
of the Western white man's
burden and his duty to run the
world and save it — a notion
which has taken innumerable
forms — has, with negligible
exceptions, ceased to interest
Europeans.
It can be said with some truth
that the reason Europeans are
no longer interested in imperial
problems is that they have lost
their empires. But that is not
the whole truth. They have
learned that the white man's
burden has become an unbear
able burden in the world that
has come into existence since
World War 11.
Because of the obsolescene of
the power politics of the 19th
century and the early 20th, the
idiom of American diplomacy
today often sounds as if it be
longed to the horse-and-buggy
age. There is not much virulent
anti-Americanism in Western
Europe. But there is a wide
spread distaste for our moral
pretensions and a rude tendency
to judge our exhortations and
our advice by the material con
tent alone, conceding to us little
extra credit and influence for
truth and wisdom.
This lamentable condition is
due, I think, to the fact that
since President Kennedy's death
our foreign policy has been con
ducted by men whose minds
were formed and whose convic
tions hardened about 25 years
ago.
So I come back home thinking
how much we have to do in
order to catch up with the world
that is passing us bv.
