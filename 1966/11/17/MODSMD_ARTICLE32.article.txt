## In Defense Of Publication 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Your recent series of articles
on "Publish or Perish" treats
the issue more comprehensively
and with greater sensitivity than
is to be found in most campus
newspapers. Much student dis
cusion of "Publish or Perish,"
here as elsowhere, however, is
based on the following miscon
ceptions:
(1) That the University pro
fessor is or ought to be primarily
a teacher. The universitas orig
inated as a community of schol
ars, where disciples could learn
toy associating with masters.
Even today, at any university
of Stanford's eminence, the ma
jority of professors consider
themselves to be scholar-teach
ers or teacher-scholars. If they
could not devote much of their
time to research, they would not
be here. They are not merely
their students' employees.
(2) That, as a general rule,
distinguished scholars are bad
teachers and the best teachers
do not publish. My own experi
ence tells me the exact opposite.
In my field (French literature),
I have never known a truly
distinguished scholar or critic
who was not also a good teach
er, nor an unusually inspiring
teacher who did not also pub
lish. The two go hand in hand.
If a professor loves his field of
work, his enthusiasm cannot
help but pass over into the class
room; if he loves and knows
the material he teaches and has
original ideas, he cannot help
but desire to express them in
print for the benefit of others.
(3) That young professors do
not have the time both to teach
and do research—i.e., that if
they seek to write a book, the
quality of their teaching will
suffer. The course load at a uni
versity such as Stanford is suf
ficiently light so that every one
willing to work has time to pre
pare classes, associate with stu
dents, and develop a scholarly
career.
Although the present system
for evaluating and promoting
faculty is a good one, I do not
wish to suggest that it is per
fect. Objective, carefully pre
pared student questionnaires can
certainly help senior professors
and the administration evaluate
faculty. I favor them. But the
desire for better teaching should
not be transformed into an anti
intellectual reaction.

• Plato's Publishing
Editor, The Daily:
A university by definition, I
take it, is an institution that
fosters learning on all levels
beyond secondary school. The
university wishes all its perma
nent members, the faculty with
tenure, to foster learning at all
levels of advancement in their
own schools and departments.
That is, professors aid others to
learn, and they are bidden to go
on learning themselves.
Here teaching and research
come most clearly into connec
tion. Research is simply learn
ing, whether it be done by the
most neophyte undergraduate or
the most advanced scholar. Put
the other way, learning is simply
research. And research issues in
teaching. This is true of the re
search that goes into the teach
er's lecture preparation, into the
student's papers and blue books
(I often learn from undergradu
ates — what they teach me is
sometimes worth knowing), and
into the scholar's published ar
ticles and books.
What is publication but an
advanced form of teaching?
Publications aimed at the un
initiated, like elementary under
graduate courses, are at one
level of teaching (and some
scholars are too nearly contemp
tuous of what they like to term
"popularization"); those aimed
at one's colleagues, like advanc
ed and graduate courses, are no
less a means of instruction in
a situation where teaching and
learning consist in debate among
experts. I would protest against
the distinction between teaching
and publication, because in fact

they are different modes of the
same thing.
Let us not restrict the teach
ing function of faculty members
to what they do with and about
the students who by choice or
inadvertance sit in their classes.
Just as no faculty member may
suppose that the only learning
his students ought to do is what
they do at his tutelage, so no
student may suppose that the
only teaching his professors
ought to do is directed at him.
Finally, a propos of Mr. Vi
dal's concluding note, we would
know nothing at all about Soc
rates' teaching had Plato not
published. EDWIN M. GOOD

• Funds Flood
Editor, The Daily:
What a heartening experience
it has been heading up the
Funds for Florence drive. Our
goal of $1000 was successfully
reached when the last pennies
were counted Monday evening.
The money was cabled yester
day to Dr. Mammarella, Direc
tor of the Florence campus, to
be distributed immediately to
the various committees involved
in art restoration and personal
welfare.
We wish to express our warm
appreciation to all who made
this drive a success, both as
workers and as contributors.
Our special thanks go to Lynn
Baker, Chris Bassett and Lisa
Hart.
Anyone wishing to make furth
er contributions should direct
their checks to A.S.S.U.—Funds
for Florence. Thanks you for
your cooperation.

• Holy McCarthy !
Editor, The Daily:
Holy Big Brother! The cam
pus is crawling with spies and
informers. Holy paranoia!
There's a secret, sinister con
spiracy involving the FBI, CIA,
HUAC, administration, rightists,
moderates, Coca-Cola, apple pie,
Yogi-Bear, . . . These frighten
ing thoughts crossed by mind
after reading about Frank Don
ner's speech in Tuesday's Daily.
All this alleged activity is di
rected against poor, helpless
(non) students who merely want
to express their thoughtful, con
stitutionally guaranteed dissent
(e.g. by aiding the Viet Cong,
starting riots, taking narcotics
or showing how to make Molo
tov cocktails). Of course, these
gallant, temperate people (Don
ner, Filthy Speech advocates,
the New Left, Attila the Hun
. . .) staunchly defend others'
rights to free speech by shout
ing them down, calling them
names, physical assault and oth
er methods that expose both
sides of the issue (e.g. that of
SNCC vs. the Communists, of
the Worker's vs. Pravda's). To
this end they suggest burning
the FBI, HUAC, witches, . . .
And, if you disagree with Don
ner and company you're obvi
ously a McCarthyite.

• Brothers
Editor, The Dally:
Wilfred Stone, in his letter
praising Beta Chi, says that the
Beta Chis, by abolishing rush,
are not giving up brotherhood.
I disagree. The men who will
be members of Beta Chi, I am
sure, will be close friends, but
men who live together in a dorm
for a couple of years become
close friends too. Without a uni
fying concept such as selective
membership to promote a corn

mon bond, loyalty and pride in
the fraternity, major compo
nents of brotherhood, will cease
to exist. The new Beta Chi
might prove to be a very dy
namic and worthwhile living
group, but that is not the issue
here. The point is that it is no
longer a true fraternity.
When. Mr. Stone speaks of the
"wisdom" and "integrity" of
Beta Chi and the "moral exam
ple" which it has set, he is
alienating fraternity men (ex
cept for Beta Chis), who natu
rally take offense. He is in es

sence condemning the judgment
of the hundreds of fraternity
men on campus. Is this his goat';
If he is advocating a change iij
the system he would have a bet>
ter chance for success if he ar
gued rationally and calmly while
possibly conceding that there
are some good points In the
present fraternity system. If, on
the other hand, he feels that ail
fraternity men (except for Beta
Chis) are unequivocally ound,
then he is succeeding in letting
his opinion be known.
