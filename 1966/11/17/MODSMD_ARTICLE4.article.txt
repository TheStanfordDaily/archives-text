# Board President Doubts Trustee Action On 'OFF'
## 
### CHRIS HARTE Associate Editor 
The Board of Trustees probably
will not consider the proposal that
women be allowed to live off campus
at its meeting today in San Fran
cisco, according to a letter from board
president Richard E. Guggenhime to
"OFF" sponsor Janet Howell.
Miss Howell, while "encouraged
that Mr. Guggenhime took time and
thought to answer us," nevertheless
termed the letter "firm but vague."
She issued a statement last night
countering each of the four reasons
Mr. Guggenhime gave for saying that
the issue probably would not come up
today and for implying that it would
not be acted upon favorably anyway.
Detailed Report
Guggenhime first asserted that the
board would not take action without
a detailed report from President Ster
ling, which he said he doubted would
be ready by today.
Miss Howell discounted this as an
excuse for lack of speed, stating that
the board president failed to take into
account the time factor: "Students
call for a change in policy immedi
ately."
Mr. Guggenhime next pointed out

that "For many years Stanford has
been a 100 percent residence univers
ity insofar as women undergraduate
students are concerned," and that he
doubted, "in light of this long custom
and tradition," that any action would
be taken before there had been ex
tensive deliberation.
Miss Howell questioned how he
could call Stanford a residence uni
versity at all when only women are
required to live on campus, but
agreed that "the powers of inertia . . .
are great."
Guggenhime's third point was that
Stanford intended to be a residence
university, and, he said, "it may well
be that if there were sufficient uni
versity residences available for all
Stanford undergraduate men, they
too might be required to live on cam
pus."
Deliberate Rejection
But, contended Miss Howell, Stan
ford "is not now, nor do I think it
will ever be, a residence university:
it has outgrown its chance to be one."
She alleged that the University "de
liberately rejected" the idea of a resi
dence university when it first ad
mitted more students than campus
residences could house.

Guggenhime's fourth point is his
"least valid," according to the "OFF"
leader. It is that "When you chose
to come to Stanford you must have
known its long-standing policy in re
spect to resident requirements and
you were free to choose Stanford or
another institution where the rules
are different."
Miss Howell states, however, that
"to ask a person to avoid the sort of
involvement in the university which
results in his trying to better the in
stitution is to ask him not to use his
education."
