# Judicial Board Will Re-Examine Council's Traister Case Decision
## 
### KIRK HANEN Associate Editor 
Interim Judicial Board will review
Judicial Council's decision not to hear
the case of draft sit-in Alan Traister
tonight at 7:30 in the Law Annex.
Traister is one of two non-students
who participated in the 50-hour draft
examination protest held in the offices
.112 President J. E. Wallace Sterling
during Spring quarter.
Technicality
Judicial Council ruled against hear
ing the Traister case on technical
grounds. According to Chairman
Mimi Sherman, the Council did not
feel that its jurisdiction extended to
violations by non-students, or stu
dents who committed violations while
not registered. The body felt that the
precedent established might be detri
mental to its future effectiveness.
Traister, a Master of Arts candidate
in Latin American Studies, alleges
that he and the other non-student
sit-In, Marc Sapir, asked that charges
be brought against them at the time
the 34 other demonstrators' cases
were reviewed by Judicial oCuncll.
Administration officials advised the

two that no charges would be brought
against them—civil or otherwise.
When Traister attempted to regis
ter this quarter, he was told he would
have to consult Dean of Students H.
Donald Winbigler before his ma
terials could be processed. Winbigler
then, according to Traister, told him
that his part in the sit-in demonstra
tions would be reviewed by Judicial
Council.
Winbigler was unavailable for com
ment on the matter.
Could Recur
Sapir, currently on leave of ab
sence, will register at the Medical
School winter quarter. He anticipates
that his case will come up when he
re-registers.
Judicial Council found the draft
demonstrators guilty of violating the
Fundamental Standard on the ground
that they had failed to exhaust pos
sible channels of communication with
the University Administration.
At the time the Selective Service
tests were administered. Administra
tion officials told the protestors that
they were holding the tests on cam
pus only as a convenience to male

students—not necessarily as a sub
scription to United States war policy
in Vietnam.
The tests will not be offered at
Stanford this year.
