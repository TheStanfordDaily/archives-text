# LASSU To Discuss Election
## 
### 
The result of this week's elections
and several appropriations will oc
cupy the attention of LASSU delegates
at tonight's meeting.
LASSU must ratify the results of
the balloting in the runoff for Head
Yell Leader and off-campus under
graduate LASSU representatives.
Four delegates out of ten candidates
were to be elected by undergraduates
living off-campus.
According to Barbara Herwig, lack
of interest along with inadequate pub
licity is responsible for the absence
of sufficient candidates to fill out the
ballot for graduate representatives
for LASSU. Since LASSU delegates

are in a ratio of 1:75 with the student
body, graduate students are entitled
to 67 seats. All candidates are ex
pected to be approved by the Legisla
ture regardless of the number of
votes received because of this short
age.
Three appropriations are to be re
corded out. The $1500 asked for by
"The Experiment" has been paired
down to $500 for the current quarter.
Because of the uncertasin require
ments of "The Experiment," future
grants will be considered on a quar
terly basis.
In addition, the Housing Commis
sion Is asking for $500 which will

pay for the publication of their report
on student housing.
LASSU will also consider a request
from the Student-Faculty Admissions
Committee for a grant of $400. The
money will be used to buy computer
time with which the committee hopes
to analyze the data already compiled.
If a National Student Association
plan is approved, low-cost life in
urance may be made available to
Stanford students.
LASSU delegates will also attempt
to rectify an inconsistency in the by
laws which came about when last
year's Legislature failed to make
previously agreed upon changes in
the by-laws.
