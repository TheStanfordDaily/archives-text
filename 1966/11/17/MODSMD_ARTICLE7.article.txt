# Farm Elects Brown; Votes Against Queen
## 
### STEVE GRUBER 
Stanford University has had one
Homecoming Queen. It will not have
another.
The institution of Homecoming
Queen at Stanford, only 20 days old,
was smashed in a referendum yester
day, 791 to 619.
The two day vote also saw Craig
Brown win the Head Yell Leader
spot for the coming year. Brown de
feated Bruce Braden, 739 to 460.
Four off-campus Legislature repre
sentatives, John Achtenkirchen. Jeff
rey Kane, Steve McMillan, and
Christopher Murlaf, were elected.

The Homecoming Queen, who
reigned at the Air Force football
game, was the first elected at Stan
ford in its 75 year history.
An apparent protest vote in the
Homecoming Queen election two
weeks ago for Wendy G. Wonka was
not counted by Cardinals' Board, the
sponsoring group. Consequently, the
Legislature voted last Thursday to
put the referendum on the ballot.
"The freshmen are sick of the
gross cheers," Brown told the Daily
yesterday,"and people in the fresh
man class worked hard for me."
Brown, who used the slogan "Brown
Power", also commented, "You just
don't get people behind yau to yell
gross cheers."

He distributed 1500 brown-colored
buttons without any words on them
as the main gimmick of his campaign.
According to Brown, he got the but
tons from Avis Rent-A-Car at the San
Francisco Airport. "I took every one
that they had," he said.
Brown would like to reinstate the
Homecoming Queen next year, but
does not see how it would be possible.
"If the Homecoming Queen election
were handled better, then it would be
worthwhile," he said.
Brown Reveals Plan
Both the Stanford team and the op
posing team stay at Rickey's Hyatt
House the night before a game,"
Brown noted, and he has plans for
them, too; he wants to hold rallies at
Rickey's while both teams are there
to demoralize Stanford's opponents.
The election saw 1387 voters make
their way to the polls, compared to
960 last year. The turnout for the pri
mary election was 2713.
Queen Referendum
The exact wording of the Queen
referendum was "The Legislature
proposes that Stanford University
shall not have a Homecoming Queen.
Do you agree or disagree with this
proposition?"
Although the Homecoming Queen
election was held along with the pri
mary election for cheerleader and the
referendum to allow women to live
off-campus, Cardinals' Board counted
the queen ballots. When several stu
dents protested that Wendy G. Won
ka, a fictitious candidate, had actually
won the election, the Board refused
to reveal the ballots. The matter was
then taken up by the Legislature.

as the main gimmick of his campaign.
According to Brown, he got the but
tons from Avis Rent-A-Car at the San
Francisco Airport. "I took every one
that they had," he said.
Brown would like to reinstate the
Homecoming Queen next year, but
does not see how it would be possible.
"If the Homecoming Queen election
were handled better, then it would be
worthwhile," he said.
Brown Reveals Plan
Both the Stanford team and the op
posing team stay at Rickey's Hyatt
House the night before a game,"
Brown noted, and he has plans for
them, too; he wants to hold rallies at
Rickey's while both teams are there
to demoralize Stanford's opponents.
The election saw 1387 voters make
their way to the polls, compared to
960 last year. The turnout for the pri
mary election was 2713.
Queen Referendum
The exact wording of the Queen
referendum was "The Legislature
proposes that Stanford University
shall not have a Homecoming Queen.
Do you agree or disagree with this
proposition?"
Although the Homecoming Queen
election was held along with the pri
mary election for cheerleader and the
referendum to allow women to live
off-campus, Cardinals' Board counted
the queen ballots. When several stu
dents protested that Wendy G. Won
ka, a fictitious candidate, had actually
won the election, the Board refused
to reveal the ballots. The matter was
then taken up by the Legislature.

Stanford University has had one
Homecoming Queen. It will not have
another.
The institution of Homecoming
Queen at Stanford, only 20 days old,
was smashed in a referendum yester
day, 791 to 619.
The two day vote also saw Craig
Brown win the Head Yell Leader
spot for the coming year. Brown de
feated Bruce Braden, 739 to 460.
Four off-campus Legislature repre
sentatives, John Achtenkirchen. Jeff
rey Kane, Steve McMillan, and
Christopher Murlaf, were elected.

The Homecoming Queen, who
reigned at the Air Force football
game, was the first elected at Stan
ford in its 75 year history.
An apparent protest vote in the
Homecoming Queen election two
weeks ago for Wendy G. Wonka was
not counted by Cardinals' Board, the
sponsoring group. Consequently, the
Legislature voted last Thursday to
put the referendum on the ballot.
"The freshmen are sick of the
gross cheers," Brown told the Daily
yesterday,"and people in the fresh
man class worked hard for me."
Brown, who used the slogan "Brown
Power", also commented, "You just
don't get people behind yau to yell
gross cheers."

He distributed 1500 brown-colored
buttons without any words on them
as the main gimmick of his campaign.

tons from Avis Rent-A-Car at the San
