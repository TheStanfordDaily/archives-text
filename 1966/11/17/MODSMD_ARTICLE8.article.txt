# Ex-Leftist To Challenge Donner Over 'New Left'
## 
### GAIL ANDERSON 
Phillip Luce, well-known defector
from the ranks of the New Left, will
debate labor lawyer Frank Donner
tonight at 7:30 p.m. in Tresidder
Large Lounge. Luce's topic will be
"Investigation of the New Left."
Luce, a graduate of Mississippi
State College, was formerly a leader
of the Progressive Labor Party in
New York and editor of Progressive
Labor. He was also one of the chief
organizers of the illegal trips to Cuba
a few years ago.
After his return from Cuba, he testi
fied in the House Un-American Activi
ties Committee hearings concerning
visas to Cuba. Later he was a leader
in the May 2nd movement.

In January 1965 he broke with the
left and began speaking and writing
from a conservative point of view in
criticism of the "new left," its lead
ers, and its motives.
His book, The New Left, is a criti
c is m of left-wing organizations
through a review of his history with
these groups. In it he explains his
reasons for leaving the movement.
Last summer he testified before
HUAC, where he was variously
termed a "renegade" or "fink."
He is currently editing a book en
titled The Red China Lobby and work
ing on another book that discusses the
feasibility of guerrilla warfare in the
United States.
Donner, who 6poke earlier this

week on surveillance and informing
in the university, also will speak this
afternoon at 4:15 p.m. in Dinkelspiel
on "HUAC Subpoenae and the Univer
sity." He will explore the university's
role in aiding HUAC investigation. His
position is that the university has an
affirmative duty not to surrender lists
of names. Discussing the problem
with him will be Professor John Kap
lan of the Law School, whose position
is that the only duty of the university
is to inform students that the sub
poena has been issued and give them
a chance to get an injunction.
HUAC Investigations
Donner, who is legal counsel for
the International Electrical Workers
Union, represented Anatole Anton and
Stuart Mcßae this summer. He has
won Supreme Court decisions against
HUAC contempt of Congress citations
and is the author of a book, The Un
americans, which deals with HUAC
investigatory procedures.
According to Anton, Donner's in
terest in the subject stems from his
experience in the McCarthy era, when
he felt that universities had in many
cases acquitted themselves poorly in
their collaborations with the investi
gations.
Donner feels that in the sixties, faced
with the problem of HUAC subpoenas,
universities had a chance to redeem
themselves and failed miserably.
Anton reported that attempts to find
someone in the Law School who would
debate whether Stanford could legally
have refused to cooperate with the
subpoenas failed because no one
would support the other side. The ad
ministration also would not defend
their position.

ministration also would not defend
their position.
Phillip Luce, well-known defector
from the ranks of the New Left, will
debate labor lawyer Frank Donner
tonight at 7:30 p.m. in Tresidder
Large Lounge. Luce's topic will be
"Investigation of the New Left."
Luce, a graduate of Mississippi
State College, was formerly a leader
of the Progressive Labor Party in
New York and editor of Progressive
Labor. He was also one of the chief
organizers of the illegal trips to Cuba
a few years ago.
After his return from Cuba, he testi
fied in the House Un-American Activi
ties Committee hearings concerning
visas to Cuba. Later he was a leader
in the May 2nd movement.

In January 1965 he broke with the
left and began speaking and writing
from a conservative point of view in
criticism of the "new left," its lead
ers, and its motives.
His book, The New Left, is a criti
c is m of left-wing organizations
through a review of his history with
these groups. In it he explains his
reasons for leaving the movement.
Last summer he testified before
HUAC, where he was variously
termed a "renegade" or "fink."
He is currently editing a book en
titled The Red China Lobby and work
ing on another book that discusses the
feasibility of guerrilla warfare in the
United States.
Donner, who 6poke earlier this

week on surveillance and informing
in the university, also will speak this
afternoon at 4:15 p.m. in Dinkelspiel
on "HUAC Subpoenae and the Univer
sity." He will explore the university's
role in aiding HUAC investigation. His
position is that the university has an
affirmative duty not to surrender lists
of names. Discussing the problem
with him will be Professor John Kap
lan of the Law School, whose position
is that the only duty of the university
is to inform students that the sub
poena has been issued and give them
a chance to get an injunction.
HUAC Investigations
Donner, who is legal counsel for
the International Electrical Workers
Union, represented Anatole Anton and
Stuart Mcßae this summer. He has
won Supreme Court decisions against
HUAC contempt of Congress citations
and is the author of a book, The Un
americans, which deals with HUAC
investigatory procedures.
According to Anton, Donner's in
terest in the subject stems from his
experience in the McCarthy era, when
he felt that universities had in many
cases acquitted themselves poorly in
their collaborations with the investi
gations.
Donner feels that in the sixties, faced
with the problem of HUAC subpoenas,
universities had a chance to redeem
themselves and failed miserably.
Anton reported that attempts to find
someone in the Law School who would
debate whether Stanford could legally
have refused to cooperate with the
subpoenas failed because no one
would support the other side. The ad
ministration also would not defend
their position.
