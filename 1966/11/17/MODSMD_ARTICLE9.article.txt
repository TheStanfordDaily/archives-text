# Rights Supporters Fast For Freedom
## 
### 
The fifth annual "Fast for
Freedom" will be held tonight
from 6 to 6:45 p.m. in Cubberley
Auditorium. Students interested
in the civil rights movement are
asked to display a renewed
commitment by sacrificing the
evening meal. This nation-wide
event is sponsored by the Na
tional Student Association. Last
year approximately 75,000 peo
ple across the country partici
pated.
Mark Edleson, Stanford Co
ordinator of NSA, emphasizes
that "Fast for Freedom" will be
an "educational program, not a

demonstration." Students will
have an opportunity to discuss
the subject of civil rights with
people directly involved in the
movement. Featured speakers
for the evening include theolo
gian Robert McAfee Brown,
Professor of Religion, ASSU
Pres. Dave Harris, and Stan
ford senior Chris Wilson.
Donations will be requested
at the door. The majority of the
money will go to the Poor Peo
ple's Corporation, an organiza
tion working to make the Ne
groes of the South economically
independent. It is felt that eco
nomic dependence forces many
Negroes to refrain from exer
cising political rights. The Poor
People's Corporation attempts to
correct this by establishing self
help co-operatives throughout
the South.
The questions of economic in
timidation characterizes much
of the thought surrounding the
civil rights movement, and thus
will form the basis for much of
the discussion tonight.
Edleseon states, "The ques
tion of equal rights involves
more that simply passing laws
against racial discrimination. It
has economic implications as
well."
