# BURN, BEAR, BURN
## Mrs. Sterling... 'Stanford By 7' 
### STEVE RUTKUS 
A giant letter "C", pierced by an
arrow of the intrepid Stanford Indian,
will be engulfed in fateful flames to
night at 7:10 in Lake Lag, site of the
annual "Beat Cal" bonfire rally.
Dangling helplessly from the ar
rowhead will be an effigy of the Cali
fornia Bear. His plight is to presage
the calamity of the Berkeley pandas
in tomorrow's grid titanic, the Big
Game.
Spirits in Berkeley, however, are
reportedly very high. Peter Van Hou
ton, associate dean of students at Cal,
told The Daily, "students here are
counting on getting the Axe back."
Van Houton admitted that, due to the
Farm's five-year domination of Big
Game, "many at Berkeley don't even
know what the Axe looks like."
The Axe
At tonight's rally Stanford students
get one last look at the famed hatchet
before it is again relinquished to the
uncertainties of 60 minutes of foot
ball.
Sergeant Tom Casey, an "old Stan
ford friend" and former local radio
announcer, joins Paul B. Fay, Jr.,
(class of '41), former Undersecretary
of the Navy, in addressing the stu
dents.
Bob Murphy, from the Board of
Athletic Control, will emcee tonight's
rally, which begins at 6:30. The Stan
ford University Band will greet ar
riving students, while head yell leader

Mike Mc Lean and Prince Lightfoot
will atterApt to rouse student cheers
to a fever pitch.
The Fire
The conflagration begins at 7:10
when four Indians will run through
the crowd with flaming torches and
light the bonfire.
Following the bonfire tonight is the
final showing of "1966 Big Game
Gaieties." Curtain rises for the Ram's
Head production at 9 p.m. in Memorial
Auditorium.
While student patrols about Stan
ford have successfully prevented any
demoralizing RF's by Berkeley van
dals, Cal's Dean Van Houton has veri
fied reports that red paint practically
covers Sather Gate, the traditional
entrance to the campus. He termed
the painting "not serious," however.
No Shows
Among the absent at Saturday's
game will be ASSU President David
Harris, who told The Daily, "I don't
think enough about Big Game to care
who wins."
University President Wallace Sterl
ing may not attend, although Mrs.
Sterling picked Stanford by 7.
Cranston To Come
Alan Cranston, State Controller,
told The Daily, "I absolutely am go
ing to the game. Stanford will win,
of course. We've got the better team."
Doodles Weaver, class of '36, actor
comedian, predicted Stanford by 12
points. "I thought they'd beat UCLA."

Gaieties." Curtain rises for the Ram's
Head production at 9 p.m. in Memorial
Auditorium.
While student patrols about Stan
ford have successfully prevented any
demoralizing RF's by Berkeley van
dals, Cal's Dean Van Houton has veri
fied reports that red paint practically
covers Sather Gate, the traditional
entrance to the campus. He termed
the painting "not serious," however.
No Shows
Among the absent at Saturday's
game will be ASSU President David
Harris, who told The Daily, "I don't
think enough about Big Game to care
who wins."
University President Wallace Sterl
ing may not attend, although Mrs.
Sterling picked Stanford by 7.
Cranston To Come
Alan Cranston, State Controller,
told The Daily, "I absolutely am go
ing to the game. Stanford will win,
of course. We've got the better team."
Doodles Weaver, class of '36, actor
comedian, predicted Stanford by 12
points. "I thought they'd beat UCLA."

A giant letter "C", pierced by an
arrow of the intrepid Stanford Indian,
will be engulfed in fateful flames to
night at 7:10 in Lake Lag, site of the
annual "Beat Cal" bonfire rally.
Dangling helplessly from the ar
rowhead will be an effigy of the Cali
fornia Bear. His plight is to presage
the calamity of the Berkeley pandas
in tomorrow's grid titanic, the Big
Game.
Spirits in Berkeley, however, are
reportedly very high. Peter Van Hou
ton, associate dean of students at Cal,
told The Daily, "students here are
counting on getting the Axe back."
Van Houton admitted that, due to the
Farm's five-year domination of Big
Game, "many at Berkeley don't even
know what the Axe looks like."
The Axe
At tonight's rally Stanford students
get one last look at the famed hatchet

of the Navy, in addressing the stu

rally, which begins at 6:30. The Stan
ford University Band will greet ar
riving students, while head yell leader

The Fire
The conflagration begins at 7:10

the crowd with flaming torches and
light the bonfire.

final showing of "1966 Big Game
Gaieties." Curtain rises for the Ram's
