# Stanford Coeds Study Archeology In Britain
## 
### 
Working under a program
sponsored by the Association for
Cultural Exchange, two Stan
ford coeds, Laurie Terr and
Sharon Herbert, spent last sum
mer excavating an ancient Ro
man fort in England. The pro
gram is designed to give stu
dents a practical knowledge of
archeology.
The two girls first attended a
three-week seminar in British
archeology at Westminister
College, Oxford. They spent the
next three weeks excavating at
Maryport in company with two
other American students. The
fort was at the western tip of
Hadrian's wall and was used as
a lookout for pirates. There is
evidence that the fort was used
as a base for an abortive Ro
man expedition to Ireland.
At the end of the six-week
term, they toured Europe and
stayed in London for a short
time.
Applications are now being
taken for this summer's pro
gram. Interested students should

write Professor lan A. Lowson,
Association for Cultural Ex
change, 539 W. 112 th Street, New
York, N.Y. 10025. Closing date
for applications i6 January 1,
