# 'Beat Cal': Words Heard Round The Globe
## 
### GAIL ANDERSON 
There scarcely exists an area
of the world which has not at
some time in its history seen
that ultimate manifestation of
the presence of Stanford—a ban
ner proclaiming in one fashion
or another: Beat Cal.
Many of these tributes have
been accomplished by students
at the various overseas cam
puses.
On October 22, 1960, forty-five
students from Florence invaded
Pisa, ascended its Leaning Tow
er, and told the world in six
and one-half foot letters to
"Beat Cal."
The 80-foot banner was smug
gled to the top of the tower in
suitcases by the students dis
guised as tourists. When accost
ed by tower guards as they
lowered ropes on the tower, they
explained that the ropes were to
measure the 180-foot structure.
Minor Panic
Guards, alarmed when the
ropes reached the ground and
were secured, began screaming
"Alto!" meaning to take the
ropes up. Quick-thinking Stan
ford students pulling on the
ropes answered merely "grazie,
prego" (thank you, you're wel
come) and continued to pull.
Since the Italian elections were
at hand, guards thought the
sign carried a political slogan.
When the nature of the sign
was explained, they extracted
from the students a solemn
promise that the next time they
hung a banner they would ask
permission.
Word came in October of 1961
that a banner had been hung
from the clock tower of the
Main Hall of the University Col
lege of East Africa, the "most

significant landmark of the
area."
Historical Proof
A picture sent back from Ecua
dor showed a statue equipped
with a sign and the following
report: "After intensive research
four Stanford grads, three Peace
Corps volunteers and one Ecua
dorian, uncovered what it was
that Simon Bolivar said to San
Martin at their historic en
counter on the banks of the
River Guayas: "BEAT CAL."
Four Stanford alumni last year
flew a blood-red and white ban
ner proclaiming the same thing
from the halyard of their car
rier off the coast of Vietnam.
A group of students on vaca
tion from their overseas cam
puses unfurled a Beat Cal ban
ner on the top of the Matter
horn.
Red Banner In Red Square
During a tour of Iron Curtain
countries by another group of
overseas campus students, a
similar banner found its way
to fame at Red Square.
Last year more such tales and
photographs returned to the
campus revealed pictures of a
huge sign being paraded down
a crowded, "bull-infested" street
in Pamplona, Spain, and one
masterpiece by biology students
on the Te Vega expedition stop
at the island of Tikopia in the
South Pacific. It was reported
that most of the natives in the
picture were supporting Stan
ford.
Lambda Nu, then AKL, mem
bers were responsible for a ban
ner hung from San Francisco's
Coit Tower a few years ago. A
more recent attempt was foiled
by the fact that the tower was
closed on the arranged night.

One of the Austria I group's
major accomplishments was also
in this field. Four Austria I
students on a four-day weekend
to Vienna arranged to have their
picture taken with a Beat Cal
banner with some horses and
riders from the famous Lip
pizaner Ridittg Academy. It was
the first time the Austrian gov
ernment had ever permitted the
use of the horses for a "gag"
picture.
And this year students at
Stanford in Britain made their
contribution to the tradition by

floating a banner from the Tow
er of London.
The most famous banner ever
unfurled, however, did not fly
in Vienna or Moscow. In 1959
a group of students from the
Chappie paid a visit to a certain
campus across the Bay. With a
giant banner weighted with
chains at one end and supplied
with ropes at the other, they
climbed to the top of Cal's cam
panile tower. The banner flut
tered from the tower for some
30 or 40 minutes, which must
be some kind of record.

a group of students from the

chains at one end and supplied
with ropes at the other, they
climbed to the top of Cal's cam

Italian guards thought banner carried a political slogan

There scarcely exists an area
of the world which has not at
some time in its history seen
that ultimate manifestation of
the presence of Stanford—a ban
ner proclaiming in one fashion
or another: Beat Cal.
Many of these tributes have
been accomplished by students
at the various overseas cam
puses.
On October 22, 1960, forty-five
students from Florence invaded
Pisa, ascended its Leaning Tow
er, and told the world in six
and one-half foot letters to
"Beat Cal."
The 80-foot banner was smug
gled to the top of the tower in
suitcases by the students dis
guised as tourists. When accost
ed by tower guards as they
lowered ropes on the tower, they
explained that the ropes were to
measure the 180-foot structure.
Minor Panic
Guards, alarmed when the
ropes reached the ground and
were secured, began screaming
"Alto!" meaning to take the
ropes up. Quick-thinking Stan
ford students pulling on the
ropes answered merely "grazie,
prego" (thank you, you're wel
come) and continued to pull.
Since the Italian elections were
at hand, guards thought the
sign carried a political slogan.
When the nature of the sign
was explained, they extracted
from the students a solemn
promise that the next time they
hung a banner they would ask
permission.
Word came in October of 1961
that a banner had been hung
from the clock tower of the
Main Hall of the University Col
lege of East Africa, the "most

significant landmark of the
area."

And this year students at
Stanford in Britain made their
contribution to the tradition by

floating a banner from the Tow
er of London.
The most famous banner ever
unfurled, however, did not fly
in Vienna or Moscow. In 1959
a group of students from the
Chappie paid a visit to a certain
campus across the Bay. With a
giant banner weighted with
chains at one end and supplied
with ropes at the other, they
climbed to the top of Cal's cam
panile tower. The banner flut
tered from the tower for some
30 or 40 minutes, which must
be some kind of record.
