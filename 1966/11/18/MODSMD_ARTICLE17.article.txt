# Operation 'Immortal 21' Highlights Spirited History Of Stanford's Axe
## 
### DAVID ALKIRE 
Surely you've heard of Glen
ford Brunson, William Eber
wine, Robert Loofbourow and
James Trimmingham. Well,
then perhaps you remember
Gerald Bettman and Gordon
Snodgrass? Don Kropp?
And you call yourself a Stan
ford student! For shame! Those
men are immortal, as every
Stanford student should know.
For they and fourteen other
conspirators comprise the "Im
mortal 21," a group that will no
doubt live forever in the minds
and hearts of old grads every
where. * * *
Thursday, April 3, 1930. The
stock market was down, banks
were reporting decreased de
posits, the New York Times was
urging employers to avoid lay
ing off workers with families to
support—and President Herbert
Hoover was busy with plans for
his long weekend of fishing in
the Virginia mountains.
Little did bankers, journalists
or Presidents suspect that it was
a day when 21 Stanford men,
undergraduates, and—yes, Vir
ginia—grad students too, were
to gain immortality.
Two Days
For two days (not three
years, as one apocryphal
version of the legend would
have us believe) they planned
their adventure. Since 1899 the
axe, a ten pound chunk of
metal, had been in the clutches
of Berkeley students. It was
Stanford property to begin with,
but had been stolen and locked
in a bank vault.
But the slow-witted Bears
from across the Bay did not
reckon with the ingenuity of the
Immortal 21.
April 3 was the day of the
annual axe rally at Cal. Why
asked them what was the rush,
April 3, you ask? Why not De
cember 25, or July 4?
Well, it happens that in the

old days baseball was a specta
tor sport on college campuses.
Baseball, (four bases, a bat and
a hardball . . . yeah, that game).
And April 3 was the day before
the annual Stanford-Cal baseball
game. Hence, an axe rally.
The 21 left Stanford in three
cars for the rally in Bejfceley's
Greek Theater. Rather than
watch from the sidelines, they
joined in the spirit of the event,
and helped push the armored
car containing the axe into the
theater.
But it was not yet time for
them to make their move.
Five of the 21 left the rally
a few minutes before it ended,
and drove to the bank where the
axe was stored.
Rumble Seat
They backed their car onto
the sidewalk in front of the
bank, and two of them climbed
into the rumble seat, where they
posed as press photographers.
The armored car arrived, com
plete with a complement of
freshmen assigned to guard the
precious symbol of, well, some
thing or other. The door of the
car opened, and the Stanford
"cameramen" shouted "Smile!"
As the hapless custodian of
the axe stepped from the car,
the cameramen set off a blind
ing flash of powder. At this
moment another conspirator
leaped from atop the car to atop
the man with the axe, and after
a brief struggle wrenched the
prize away from him.
More of the 21 had arrived by
this time, and the axe was
passed from man to man, fire
bucket fashion, until it reached
Robert Loofbourow.
After tucking it under his
sweater he walked with exem
plary coolness to the camera
car, which was now the getaway
car, and which immediately got
away.
As the axe-bearing car pulled
away, one Stanford man ex

ploded a tear-gas bomb right in
front of the bank. The crowd
scattered.
Other members of the 21 im
mediately organized search par
ties from the Cal students as
sembled, and led them off in all
directions but the right one.
Bay Bridge
The driver of the getaway car
decided not to take the Oakland
Bay Bridge, since it had not yet
been built. Fearing a delay on
the San Mateo Bridge, he sped
to Stanford via San Jose.
Coineidentally, the operator
on duty at the San Mateo Bridge
was a Stanford graduate stu
dent. When hordes of Cal stu
dents began flooding across the
bridge in chase of the axe, he
and when they told him, he
stopped traffic and raised the
drawbridge.
But the damage was done, and

Stanford had regained is pre
cious chunk of metal. There was
a rally next day on the steps of
the library to celebrate the suc
cessful thievery, and speakers
included the Acting President of
the school. The 21 redeemers
were awarded block "S" letters
and given gold axe charms.
Not To Cool
The reaction at Berkeley was
uncharitable, to say the least,
and uncool, to say the worst.
The editor of the Daily Call
fornian threatened that "the
clever boys who stole the Axe
may have returned to paint the
town red, but they may find the
place painted Blue and Gold be
fore the night is over . . . Stan
ford, despairing of an honest
burglary, imported Chicago
methods. Tear (gas) bombs may
bo fair play at Stanford—but
then, that is Stanford!"

Meanwhile, the axe was hit.-
den away in the vault of the
American Trust Company In
Palo Alto. Three years later,
representatives of both schools
agreed that it should be made
a trophy, and go to the winner
of the annual Big Game.
Shenanigans
This agreement did not pre
vent future fun and games with
the axe. But no shenanigans
since f930 have been so daring,
dangerous and exciting as the
one that gave "immortality" to
those 21 larcenous post-adoles
cents of the days when cars sthi
had rumble seats.

but had been stolen and locked
in a bank vault.
But the slow-witted Bears
from across the Bay did not
reckon with the ingenuity of the
Immortal 21.
April 3 was the day of the
annual axe rally at Cal. Why
asked them what was the rush,
April 3, you ask? Why not De
cember 25, or July 4?
Well, it happens that in the

old days baseball was a specta
tor sport on college campuses.
Baseball, (four bases, a bat and
a hardball . . . yeah, that game).
And April 3 was the day before
the annual Stanford-Cal baseball
game. Hence, an axe rally.
The 21 left Stanford in three
cars for the rally in Bejfceley's
Greek Theater. Rather than
watch from the sidelines, they
joined in the spirit of the event,
and helped push the armored
car containing the axe into the
theater.
But it was not yet time for
them to make their move.
Five of the 21 left the rally
a few minutes before it ended,
and drove to the bank where the
axe was stored.
Rumble Seat
They backed their car onto
the sidewalk in front of the
bank, and two of them climbed
into the rumble seat, where they
posed as press photographers.
The armored car arrived, com
plete with a complement of
freshmen assigned to guard the
precious symbol of, well, some
thing or other. The door of the
car opened, and the Stanford
"cameramen" shouted "Smile!"
As the hapless custodian of
the axe stepped from the car,
the cameramen set off a blind
ing flash of powder. At this
moment another conspirator
leaped from atop the car to atop
the man with the axe, and after
a brief struggle wrenched the
prize away from him.
More of the 21 had arrived by
this time, and the axe was
passed from man to man, fire
bucket fashion, until it reached
Robert Loofbourow.
After tucking it under his
sweater he walked with exem
plary coolness to the camera
car, which was now the getaway
car, and which immediately got
away.
As the axe-bearing car pulled
away, one Stanford man ex

ploded a tear-gas bomb right in
front of the bank. The crowd
scattered.
Other members of the 21 im
mediately organized search par
ties from the Cal students as
sembled, and led them off in all
directions but the right one.
Bay Bridge
The driver of the getaway car
decided not to take the Oakland
Bay Bridge, since it had not yet
been built. Fearing a delay on
the San Mateo Bridge, he sped
to Stanford via San Jose.
Coineidentally, the operator
on duty at the San Mateo Bridge
was a Stanford graduate stu
dent. When hordes of Cal stu
dents began flooding across the
bridge in chase of the axe, he
and when they told him, he
stopped traffic and raised the
drawbridge.
But the damage was done, and

Stanford had regained is pre
cious chunk of metal. There was
a rally next day on the steps of
the library to celebrate the suc
cessful thievery, and speakers
included the Acting President of
the school. The 21 redeemers
were awarded block "S" letters
and given gold axe charms.
Not To Cool
The reaction at Berkeley was
uncharitable, to say the least,
and uncool, to say the worst.
The editor of the Daily Call
fornian threatened that "the
clever boys who stole the Axe
may have returned to paint the
town red, but they may find the
place painted Blue and Gold be
fore the night is over . . . Stan
ford, despairing of an honest
burglary, imported Chicago
methods. Tear (gas) bombs may
bo fair play at Stanford—but
then, that is Stanford!"

Meanwhile, the axe was hit.-
den away in the vault of the
American Trust Company In
Palo Alto. Three years later,
representatives of both schools
agreed that it should be made
a trophy, and go to the winner
of the annual Big Game.
Shenanigans
This agreement did not pre
vent future fun and games with
the axe. But no shenanigans
since f930 have been so daring,
dangerous and exciting as the
one that gave "immortality" to
those 21 larcenous post-adoles
cents of the days when cars sthi
had rumble seats.

Thursday, April 3, 1930. The

thing or other. The door of the
car opened, and the Stanford
"cameramen" shouted "Smile!"
As the hapless custodian of
the axe stepped from the car,
the cameramen set off a blind
ing flash of powder. At this
moment another conspirator
leaped from atop the car to atop
the man with the axe, and after
a brief struggle wrenched the
prize away from him.
More of the 21 had arrived by
this time, and the axe was
passed from man to man, fire
bucket fashion, until it reached
Robert Loofbourow.
After tucking it under his
sweater he walked with exem
plary coolness to the camera
car, which was now the getaway
car, and which immediately got
away.
As the axe-bearing car pulled
away, one Stanford man ex

ploded a tear-gas bomb right in
front of the bank. The crowd
scattered.
Other members of the 21 im
mediately organized search par
ties from the Cal students as
sembled, and led them off in all
directions but the right one.
Bay Bridge
The driver of the getaway car
decided not to take the Oakland
Bay Bridge, since it had not yet
been built. Fearing a delay on
the San Mateo Bridge, he sped
to Stanford via San Jose.
Coineidentally, the operator
on duty at the San Mateo Bridge
was a Stanford graduate stu
dent. When hordes of Cal stu
dents began flooding across the
bridge in chase of the axe, he
and when they told him, he
stopped traffic and raised the
drawbridge.
But the damage was done, and

Stanford had regained is pre
cious chunk of metal. There was
a rally next day on the steps of
the library to celebrate the suc
cessful thievery, and speakers
included the Acting President of
the school. The 21 redeemers
were awarded block "S" letters
and given gold axe charms.
Not To Cool
The reaction at Berkeley was
uncharitable, to say the least,
and uncool, to say the worst.
The editor of the Daily Call
fornian threatened that "the
clever boys who stole the Axe
may have returned to paint the
town red, but they may find the
place painted Blue and Gold be
fore the night is over . . . Stan
ford, despairing of an honest
burglary, imported Chicago
methods. Tear (gas) bombs may
bo fair play at Stanford—but
then, that is Stanford!"

Meanwhile, the axe was hit.-
den away in the vault of the
American Trust Company In
Palo Alto. Three years later,
representatives of both schools
agreed that it should be made
a trophy, and go to the winner
of the annual Big Game.
Shenanigans
This agreement did not pre
vent future fun and games with
the axe. But no shenanigans
since f930 have been so daring,
dangerous and exciting as the
one that gave "immortality" to
those 21 larcenous post-adoles
cents of the days when cars sthi
had rumble seats.

Thursday, April 3, 1930. The
stock market was down, banks
were reporting decreased de
posits, the New York Times was
urging employers to avoid lay
ing off workers with families to
support—and President Herbert
Hoover was busy with plans for
his long weekend of fishing in
the Virginia mountains.
Little did bankers, journalists
or Presidents suspect that it was
a day when 21 Stanford men,
undergraduates, and—yes, Vir
ginia—grad students too, were
to gain immortality.
Two Days
For two days (not three
years, as one apocryphal
version of the legend would
have us believe) they planned
their adventure. Since 1899 the
axe, a ten pound chunk of
metal, had been in the clutches
of Berkeley students. It was
Stanford property to begin with,
but had been stolen and locked
in a bank vault.
But the slow-witted Bears
from across the Bay did not
reckon with the ingenuity of the
Immortal 21.
April 3 was the day of the
annual axe rally at Cal. Why
asked them what was the rush,
April 3, you ask? Why not De
cember 25, or July 4?
Well, it happens that in the

old days baseball was a specta
tor sport on college campuses.
Baseball, (four bases, a bat and
a hardball . . . yeah, that game).
And April 3 was the day before
the annual Stanford-Cal baseball
game. Hence, an axe rally.
The 21 left Stanford in three
cars for the rally in Bejfceley's
Greek Theater. Rather than
watch from the sidelines, they
joined in the spirit of the event,
and helped push the armored
car containing the axe into the
theater.
But it was not yet time for
them to make their move.
Five of the 21 left the rally
a few minutes before it ended,
and drove to the bank where the
axe was stored.
Rumble Seat
They backed their car onto
the sidewalk in front of the
bank, and two of them climbed
into the rumble seat, where they
posed as press photographers.
The armored car arrived, com
plete with a complement of
freshmen assigned to guard the
precious symbol of, well, some
thing or other. The door of the
car opened, and the Stanford
"cameramen" shouted "Smile!"
As the hapless custodian of
the axe stepped from the car,
