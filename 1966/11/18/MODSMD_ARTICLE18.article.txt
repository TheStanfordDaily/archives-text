## Cal's Oski Short, Mean 
### TANDA DYKES 
Bears better beware this week
end, as Stanford Indians hatch
ets-in-hand set out in pursuit of
the ever-elusive pelt of Oski,
the Cal mascot.
"Translated for freshman or
neophyte at the Farm, an Oskie
is a Cal male temporarily trans
formed into a cavorting bear
during football seasons.
Not one but two anonymous
bear-impersonators appear in
each gameâ€”the first at the be
ginning and the other at half
time, the malevolent purpose of
the four-legged clowns being to
incite Cal fans on to further out
rages (such as the notorious
case of the vanishing card
stunts).

The rigid requirements for
membership in the clandestine
Oskie society include acrobatic
agility, a strong appetite (to
make up for the 5 pounds lost
during a performance), and an
underendowment in the height
department (all Oskiites must
be under 5 feet 5).
Silence also spells safety con
sidering the $50,000 lawsuit
brought by Charles Davis, 12,
against "a certain mascot and
clown dressed in a bear costume
who at all intercollegiate athletic
contests of said UC entertains
and amuses the spectators there
of."
Cal students sympathized with
"the severe nervous shock"
Charles experienced during the

chaos Oski created by throwing
ice cream into the stands. How
ever, everyone (including the
school newspaper and the presi
dent of the ASUC) swore ignor
ance as to the identity of the
mischievous bear.
Still the bear reappears at
every game, upholding a sacred
Cal tradition which originated
25 years ago. When two venture
some UC boys showed up at
football game in bear masks, an
unsung fan cried out the im
mortal word "Oski"; and Oski
was born.
But Stanford braves, fearless
of threatened insanity still
haunt the Cal campus in search
of an Oskipelt to keep them
warm at the Friday night bon
fire.
