# Chief Lightfoot Dances On Through 15th Year
## 
### MILTON BENNETT 
As the drunk lady reeled back
to her seat on the plane, some
one yelled, "Don't take any
wooden nickels." She turned,
looked squarely as possible at
the man sitting next to me, and
said, "I ain't no Indian."
The plane was carrying the

band to Los Angeles for the
Stanford • U.C.L.A. game, and
the man next to me was Timm
Williams, Stanford's "Prince
Lightfoot." He dismissed the in
cident with "That's the way
drunk people are about Indians."
Timm likes to repeat the ad
vice of his grandfather, who was

a U.S. Cavalry scout in Custer's
era: if someone doesn't like
you because you're an Indian,
ignore them. Timm does.
But then our Indian has been
ignoring things all his life. As
a child, he ignored the doctor's
prediction that he could never
use his legs again after an at
tack of spinal meningitis. He
spent twelve years learning to
walk with one leg an inch
shorter than the other.
At the age of 22, he fought
through a seemingly mortal
bout with a lung disease. Today,
at 42, he frequently ignores the
pain of a pinched neck nerve to
dance at the Stanford football
and basketball games.
In the fifteen years Timm has
been the "Stanford Indian," he
has never missed a home foot
ball game. And his efforts are
entirely voluntary — at first he
even paid his own transporta
tion to out-of-town games.
Now Prince Lightfoot has
been allowed to travel on the
band or team planes. However,
he still foots the bill for his ex
pensive costumes and his trans

portation to games and rallies
from Marin County.
"I was luckier than most In
dians," says Timm of being able
to ride 20 miles each day to a
public high school. "I was living
in an earth-floor barn at the
time because our house had
been washed away in a flood of
the Klamath river. The kids
used to say 'there's the Indian
who lives in a barn,' but I got
an education."
Timm continued his study at
the University of San Francisco
and is now employed by Matson
Steamship Lines in the docu
mentation division. His main
work, however, is in the fight
for Indian civil rights.
As Leader-Spokesman and at
torney-in-fact for the Yurok
Tribe, he wages a frustrating
struggle with the government
to remove the American Indian
from the classification of "a
foreign power living within the
United States."
"It is rough," Timm says, "to
be absolutely controlled by the
government of a country you
don't even exist in."

Prince Lightfoot is a busy
man, but he will always add tu
the list of his activities: "Satur
days are for Stanford." For a
week proceeding the Stanford-
Air Force game Timm had been
in bed with the flu. Saturday
morning he got out of bed, slip
ped out of his neck brace and
into his colorful costume.
"I've never missed a game,
and I didn't want that to be the
first one," he explained. "I have
a real feeling for Stanford — it
is a great school with great stu
dents. I like to think, too, that
the students appreciate my be
ing at the games."
