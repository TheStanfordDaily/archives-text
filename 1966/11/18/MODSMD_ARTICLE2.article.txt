### BARBARA WARREN 
Legislature last night voted to give
$500 to the Experiment to help it stay
out of the red.
The Experiment, a venture in "re
levant education," had requested the
appropriation in order to make up
this quarter's deficit. According to
Experiment coordinator Barry Green
berg, the membership fees collected
$10 per participant — were not suf
ficient to allow the program to break
even.
ASSU Vice President Mike Collins
reported that Harris's office and some
ad hoc assistants had presented a pro
posal to the Committee of Undergrad
uate Education.
Residence Proposal
The proposal, drawn up by Rick
Levin and Chris Harte, involved set
ting up a special living unit in the
vacant Phi Delt House including all
living groups in the university, men,
women, undergraduates, graduates,
and faculty. No action has been taken,
but a full report is expected after
Thanksgiving.
The appropriation for the Housing
Commission of $1550 was approved.
The majority of the money is to be
used in printing the final report
which will be distributed to each of
the 800 members of the Academic
Council and 700 copies for students.
Life Insurance
A resolution which will make avail
able to Stanford students the NSA
Life Insurance program passed. Legis

lativo sponsor, Mark Edelson, out
lined the NSA program.
Rick Montgomery, Director of the
Stanford Management Intern Pro
gram, gave a report of the program.
He announced that a meeting will be
held Tuesday, November 22, at 4:15
in the Tresidder Large Lounge. "The
program is an excellent opportunity
for Stanford students to get summer
jobs in big business at the middle
management level," said Montgomery.
He encouraged Junior males to apply
