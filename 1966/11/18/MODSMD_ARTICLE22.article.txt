# Gypsy: Vaudeville To Nudeville
## 
### BRUCE MERRY 
"Gypsy" Circle Star Theatre,
San Carlos.
The memoirs of Gypsy Rose
Lee, flamboyant show-business
personality of the Twenties, are
the basis for this musical frolic
dealing with the decline of vau
deville. Giselle MacKenzie star
red as Rose, the grimly ambi
tious mother who lashes both
her daughters into stage careers
without first telling them the
facts of life. Her dynamic pres
ence on the stage holds an other
wise laborious show together
and provides an effective foil to
Lois Roberts, as her younger
daughter, Louise—the girl who
matures from vaudeville to
nudesville with her virtue in
tact.
The plot is nebulous, a mix
ture of pathos and vulgarity

that is really too weak to run
the length of "Ben Hur." Will
Rose marry Herbie, the good
time Charlie who strings along
as her press-agent—played in a
bluff, I-luv-you manner by Lew
Parker—or won't she? Can vau
deville survive? Can good girls
be strippers? This momentous
question is a key theme of the
show, since Rose preserves her
children in a state of psychotic
innocence.
Navigated Puberty
Thus Louise, when she has
apparently navigated puberty,
gets a lamb for a birthday gift
and lovingly cuddles thjs real
live mini-sheep, which is
brought on the stage in a red
ribbon and plastic diapers.
A fey little six year old, Susan
Joy, gives a charming perfor
mance of Baby June when the

daughters are at the Kiddy Con
test stage of their mother's am
bition for them. Next, June is
a big, blonde girl, played by
Tracy Moyer looking like an ad
vertisement for Dutch cheese;
eventually she rejects her moth
er's possessiveness and breaks
away on her own. Rose then
turns to Louise and attempts
to force her to stardom.
Shake A Tail Feather
Louise's first insight into the
technique of undressing comes
in a brilliantly grotesque scene
with three professional strippers
at a burlesque theatre lurching
onto the stage before the dazed
eyes o fthe heroine. One a dis
gruntled Roman gladiator in a
bikini, another a faded tart in
green feathers with electric
bulbs flashing on vital spots of
her anatomy, the third a

straight invitation to sin, they
rotate their mobile portions to
the accompaniment of voices
that would cut a piece of con
crete. The Roman gladiator
snaps her pelvis in and out as
she keeps time on a dented
trumpet; meanwhile, Green
Feathers scratches her itches
and all of them join in their
number: "You Gotta Have A
Gimmick."
Overworked Ear
This persuades Louise: in
spired by the electrifying demon
stration, she goes the way of all
flesh and makes good in a strip
number during which, for some
odd reason, you only see her
shou'ders. She quarrels and
makes up with "Momma", and
by now Miss MacKenzie's per
formance has a certain breath
lessness, for she belts out those
numbers at the top of her voice.
What with her and the metallic,
over-amplified jangle of the or
chestra, the ear is kept hard at
work during the show.
There are few other funny
scenes, and the sentimentality
of poor, repected mother, stifled
sobs, empty theatres at night,
kids coming and going with suit
cases—simply cannot carry the
amount of time spent on it.
Generous Santa Claus
But the staging is good and
there are some nice supporting
acts: leggy girls is pseudo-Span
ish head-dress, for example, and
a Christmas sequence in which
Gypsy Rose Lee (that is Louise
in all her fame) finally emerges
from a parcel with a white fur
jacket and pink thighs, the
work of £our Santa Claus.
Jule Styne's music is catchy,
though played like an air-raid
warning, and the songs are very
attractive in a light, inconse
quential way. This is a musical
which, like so many others, has
the advantage of requiring no
thought from the audience.

"Gypsy" Circle Star Theatre,

The memoirs of Gypsy Rose
Lee, flamboyant show-business
personality of the Twenties, are
the basis for this musical frolic
dealing with the decline of vau
deville. Giselle MacKenzie star
red as Rose, the grimly ambi
tious mother who lashes both
her daughters into stage careers
without first telling them the
facts of life. Her dynamic pres
ence on the stage holds an other
wise laborious show together
and provides an effective foil to
Lois Roberts, as her younger
daughter, Louise—the girl who
matures from vaudeville to
nudesville with her virtue in
tact.
The plot is nebulous, a mix
ture of pathos and vulgarity

that is really too weak to run
the length of "Ben Hur." Will
Rose marry Herbie, the good
time Charlie who strings along
as her press-agent—played in a
bluff, I-luv-you manner by Lew
Parker—or won't she? Can vau
deville survive? Can good girls
be strippers? This momentous
question is a key theme of the
show, since Rose preserves her
children in a state of psychotic
innocence.

Thus Louise, when she has

A fey little six year old, Susan

Tracy Moyer looking like an ad
vertisement for Dutch cheese;
eventually she rejects her moth
er's possessiveness and breaks
away on her own. Rose then
turns to Louise and attempts
to force her to stardom.
Shake A Tail Feather
Louise's first insight into the
technique of undressing comes
in a brilliantly grotesque scene
with three professional strippers
at a burlesque theatre lurching
onto the stage before the dazed
eyes o fthe heroine. One a dis
gruntled Roman gladiator in a
bikini, another a faded tart in
green feathers with electric
bulbs flashing on vital spots of
her anatomy, the third a

straight invitation to sin, they
rotate their mobile portions to
the accompaniment of voices
that would cut a piece of con
crete. The Roman gladiator
snaps her pelvis in and out as
she keeps time on a dented
trumpet; meanwhile, Green
Feathers scratches her itches
and all of them join in their
number: "You Gotta Have A
Gimmick."
