# 'Professionals': Blood & Sex
## 
### MAURICE CHEPEPIK 
For an evening of sheer en
tertainment, "The Profession
als" fills all the requirements.
Blood, sex (domestic style), Lee
Marvin-type dialogue, and exis
tential philosophy abound in
this move, not to mention its
all star cast: Lee Marvin, Burt
Lancaster, Jack Palance, Robert
Ryan, Ralph Bellamy, Woody
Strode, Claudia Cardinale, and
a genuine "one hundred proof
woman" named Chiquita.

"You've gotta see 'em to believe
it."
The plot seems fairly simple.
Rich gringo (Ralph Bellamy)
hires four expert eccentrics
(Marvin, Lancaster, Ryan, and
Strode) to recover "kidnapped"
wife (Cardinale) from evil Mex
ican bandito (Palance) without
having to pay the $100,000 ran
som. (Natura'ly the four experts
are to be paid $10,000 each). The
scene is sometime around the
Pancho Villa era, so there are
plenty of good props: trains,
dynamite, machine guns, and
low-cut dresses.
Fearsome Foursome
After a treacherous journey
through the Mexican dessert the
fearsome foursome reaches the
lair of Palance. They then lay
plans for a successful diversion
ary tactic, namely, to dynamite
the place. While the banditos
are thus diverted, they plan to
re-kidnap the lady.
Here, however, the plot takes
a turn. Our heroes discover that
the lady has not been kidnapped

at all, that in fact, she has run
off with her lover (Palance) and
they are, thus, the indirect vic
tims of the old shakedown
game. "Cozy," says Lancaster.
But they steal her anyway and
retrace their way across the
dessert back to the U.S.A., with
Palance in hot pursuit of course.
There is plenty of action and
a great gunfight between Pa
lance and Lancaster, during
which each expounds his respec
tive philosophy of life to the
other.
Bizarre Twist To End
The end of the movie has an
equally bizarre twist to it, but
that remains to be seen by the
intellectually curious.
The only great problem with
the movie is that sometimes the
audience is not sure whether
the lines were meant to be funny
or they just turned out that
way. Giving these few instances
the benefit of the doubt, The
Professionals carries on in the
Cat Ballou tradition, and is defi
nitely worth seeing.

There is plenty of action and
a great gunfight between Pa
lance and Lancaster, during
which each expounds his respec
tive philosophy of life to the
other.
Bizarre Twist To End
The end of the movie has an
equally bizarre twist to it, but
that remains to be seen by the
intellectually curious.
The only great problem with
the movie is that sometimes the
audience is not sure whether
the lines were meant to be funny
or they just turned out that
way. Giving these few instances
the benefit of the doubt, The
Professionals carries on in the
Cat Ballou tradition, and is defi
nitely worth seeing.
For an evening of sheer en
tertainment, "The Profession
als" fills all the requirements.
Blood, sex (domestic style), Lee
Marvin-type dialogue, and exis
tential philosophy abound in
this move, not to mention its
all star cast: Lee Marvin, Burt
Lancaster, Jack Palance, Robert
Ryan, Ralph Bellamy, Woody
Strode, Claudia Cardinale, and
a genuine "one hundred proof
woman" named Chiquita.

"You've gotta see 'em to believe
it."
The plot seems fairly simple.
Rich gringo (Ralph Bellamy)
hires four expert eccentrics
(Marvin, Lancaster, Ryan, and
Strode) to recover "kidnapped"
wife (Cardinale) from evil Mex
ican bandito (Palance) without
having to pay the $100,000 ran
som. (Natura'ly the four experts
are to be paid $10,000 each). The
scene is sometime around the
Pancho Villa era, so there are
plenty of good props: trains,
dynamite, machine guns, and
low-cut dresses.
Fearsome Foursome
After a treacherous journey
through the Mexican dessert the
fearsome foursome reaches the
lair of Palance. They then lay
plans for a successful diversion
ary tactic, namely, to dynamite
the place. While the banditos
are thus diverted, they plan to
re-kidnap the lady.
Here, however, the plot takes
a turn. Our heroes discover that
the lady has not been kidnapped

at all, that in fact, she has run
off with her lover (Palance) and
they are, thus, the indirect vic
tims of the old shakedown
game. "Cozy," says Lancaster.
But they steal her anyway and
retrace their way across the
dessert back to the U.S.A., with
Palance in hot pursuit of course.
There is plenty of action and
