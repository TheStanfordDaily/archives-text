THEATER
Ram's Hoad production of the 1966 Big Game Gaieties,AAAUUGH,'
will close its three day run tonight. Gaieties offers much in the '
way of music, costumes, singing, and scenery. However into each '
bright life a little rain must fall—and fall it does.
Director-author Joel Mills' plot is not only supremely unfunny
and unwitty, but belabors a schizophrenia of focus that leaves the i
audience ragged and frustrated at the finale. But as I mentioned,
the music is excellent and Robert Sevra, Polly Adams, and Ronee
Blakeley sing superbly.
TINY ALICE plays this evening at 25 W. San Salvador St., San
Jose. Curtain opens at 8:30 p.m.
The ILLEGITIMATE THEATRE continues its improvisational
show this weekend at tlie Tangent, 9 and 10:30 p.m.

ances will begin nightly at 8:30 with matinees Wednesday and Sat
urday at 2 p.m.

of how avarice brings about the destruction of two derelicts who, !

claim their share of the gelt.

LOTTE, gruesome grisly starring Bette Davis.
