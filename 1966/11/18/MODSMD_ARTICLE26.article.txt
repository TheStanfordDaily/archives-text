# Broadway Reviles Critics But They Have Last Word
## 
### 
NEW YORK, (AP) — Over
the years, the critics have been
attacked, barred, sued. Right
now, the war waxes hot on
Broadway and in addition two
investigations are underway. Are
critics a menace to the arts?
That depends on whom you ask.
The war of the theater critics
is heating up. It is simply that
recent assaults from several di
rections are the most varied and
vigorous since Mae West threat
ened a horse-whipping for the
Aisle Gang and Maxwell Ander
son branded them "the Jukes
family of journalism."
"In the opinion racket it's al
ways touch and go between spit
and hug," one reviewer noted
recently.
Since the start of this show
season, various critics have
found themselves barred from
premieres in New York, Boston,
Philadelphia and Washington on
grounds of being incompetent,
dull, late or maybe all three.
Pliny Twerps
Top producers and prize play
wrights in augmented force have
been sounding off about the
breed as "puny," or "twerps" or
"threats to culture."
Some critics, in chivalric laps
es, have taken to bluntly fault
ing colleagues, and a TV man
snarled at the New York drama
critics circle for not admitting
airwave reviewers.
Most significant and potential
ly important, both the federal
government's national endow
ment for the arts and the pri
vately-financed Twentieth Cen
tury Fund have launched studies
of critical standards in drama
and all the other arts.
Multiple Stirrings
One reason for such multiple
stirrings, especially the last, is
the growing countrywide inter
est in aesthetic matters, with re
sultant concern over the calibre
of comment. Another reason, at
least around Broadway, is the
decrease in the number of New
York City newspapers, from
seven in 1962 to four today.
Whether critics are ogres or
angels depends, of course, upon
whether at any moment their
pens are flowing with acid or
honey. "Critics — Murderers!,"
cried Samuel Taylor Coleridge
in terse epitaph. "The most in
corruptible group of men I
know," beamed Marc Connelly.
Playwright Arthur Miller
terms the public's reliance upon
reviews a "disaster which is
scaring the artist to death." But
another author, Edward Albee,
while in accord with Miller on
the general incompetence of

critics, feels theatergoers are
getting smart enough to make
up their own minds about plays.
Producers, of course, are in
the best position to do something
directly. For many years the
Shubert Interests, with control
of more than half New York's
theaters, blacklisted such emi
nents as Alexander Woollcott,
Alan Dale and Walter Winchell.
David Belasco is the only impre
sario on record who actually got
a critic fired.
Bearer of the cudgels current
ly is David Merrick. A man of
multiple wiles in combat, he last
season cancelled a preview per
formance to compel one slow
working aisle-sitter to attend in
stead the official premiere.
In recent weeks Merrick has
banned two radio-TV commenta
tors and, keeping the media dis
pleasure balanced, two press
representatives. Against one of
the air observers he threatened
legal reprisal if the man bought
a ticket and then reviewed.
Carrying out such a threat
could create a precedent in U.S.
jurisprudence.
Under English common law,
courts have held a producer can
collect if he can prove malice
by a ticket-buying reviewer. In
a rare libel suit here in 1917,
however, a court decided that
Heywood Broun, in on a press
pass, was well within his rights
for saying a performer gave
"the worst performance ever
seen on any stage."

Multiple Stirrings
One reason for such multiple
stirrings, especially the last, is
the growing countrywide inter
est in aesthetic matters, with re
sultant concern over the calibre
of comment. Another reason, at
least around Broadway, is the
decrease in the number of New
York City newspapers, from
seven in 1962 to four today.
Whether critics are ogres or
angels depends, of course, upon
whether at any moment their
pens are flowing with acid or
honey. "Critics — Murderers!,"
cried Samuel Taylor Coleridge
in terse epitaph. "The most in
corruptible group of men I
know," beamed Marc Connelly.
Playwright Arthur Miller

another author, Edward Albee,
while in accord with Miller on
the general incompetence of

critics, feels theatergoers are

up their own minds about plays.
Producers, of course, are in
the best position to do something
directly. For many years the
Shubert Interests, with control
of more than half New York's
theaters, blacklisted such emi

Alan Dale and Walter Winchell.
David Belasco is the only impre

a critic fired.
Bearer of the cudgels current

multiple wiles in combat, he last

working aisle-sitter to attend in

In recent weeks Merrick has
banned two radio-TV commenta
tors and, keeping the media dis
pleasure balanced, two press
representatives. Against one of
the air observers he threatened
legal reprisal if the man bought
a ticket and then reviewed.
Carrying out such a threat
could create a precedent in U.S.
jurisprudence.
Under English common law,
courts have held a producer can

by a ticket-buying reviewer. In
a rare libel suit here in 1917,

Heywood Broun, in on a press
pass, was well within his rights
for saying a performer gave
"the worst performance ever

NEW YORK, (AP) — Over
the years, the critics have been
attacked, barred, sued. Right
now, the war waxes hot on
Broadway and in addition two
investigations are underway. Are
critics a menace to the arts?
That depends on whom you ask.
The war of the theater critics
is heating up. It is simply that
recent assaults from several di
rections are the most varied and
vigorous since Mae West threat
ened a horse-whipping for the
Aisle Gang and Maxwell Ander
son branded them "the Jukes
family of journalism."
"In the opinion racket it's al
ways touch and go between spit
and hug," one reviewer noted
recently.
Since the start of this show

found themselves barred from
premieres in New York, Boston,
Philadelphia and Washington on
grounds of being incompetent,
dull, late or maybe all three.

Some critics, in chivalric laps
