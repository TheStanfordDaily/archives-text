# Indians Swing Sixth Big Game Axe
## 
### NICK SELBY 
A fired-up tribe of Stanford foot
ball players faces three major ob
stacles when it meets the golden
Bears of the University of California
at Berkeley tomorrow in the 69th
annual Big Game.
First, the Indians will battle tradi
tion. Never before in the long series

has a team won six games in a row.
Stanford has won five in a row once
before, from 1904 to 1908. Cal turned
the trick with its "Wonder Teams"
from 1919 to 1923.
Bears 3-6-0
Second, the Indians face a Cal team
hungry for a final win to have face
for a dismal 3-6-0 season. The Bears

have triumphed, however, in two of
their four conference games to now,
posting a 24-20 win over Washington
and a 21-6 victory over Washington
State.
California will be extra hungry to
erase the stigma of a four game los
ing streak as it enters the contest.
A Bear win combined with Oregon

St.and UCLA losses would give Cal
a conference second place.
Third, the Indians face a jinx
which has prevented any victories in
conference play this year. The Tribe
has lost only one game outside of
the conference, to Minnesota, but has
dropped AAWU games to USC, Ore
gon, Washington, and UCLA.
The main obstacle on the field will
be the combination of quarterback
Barry Bronk and fleet receiver Jerry
Bradley. Bronk is only b4 yards short
of 1000 yards passing this season. He
has completed 80 of 164 passes for
seven touchdowns ,and has 3.92 yard
average in total offense.
Bradley is perhaps the best receiver
in Cal's history, having broken four
career records and one season record.
Over his three year career, he has
totaled 1127 yards and scored 12
times. His 71 passes caught is second
in Bear records.
17 Seniors Fight Obstacles
Fighting these obstacles lor Stan
ford will be 17 seniors, who would
like nothing more than to keep the
Big Game Axe on campus one more
year. Leading the Tribe will be senior
co-captains A 1 Wilburn, a defensive
end, and Monty Mohrman, a defensive
tackle.
Backing up Wilburn and Mohrman
on the defensive unit will be line
backer Marty Brill, who was named
the outstanding lineman of the UCLA
game, and senior John Guillory, a
standout defensive back all year for
the Cards. Another senior seeing
final defensive action for Stanford
is guard Mike Hibler.
Lewis At QB
Leading the Tribe offensively will be
senior Dave Lewis, who will start at

quarterback. Assisting Lewis at the
controls will be sophomore Gene
Washington, whose shoulder is now
fully healed.
Lewis and Washington will be
throwing to three, split end Bob Con
rad, who had his best day ever with
ten receptions against UCLA, tight
end John Mason, and flanker Bob
Blunt. Stanford will probably rely
heavily on the passing attack after its
success against UCLA.
Can Stanford Score?
The big question facing the Stan
ford team is its power to score points.
The Tribe had adequate scoring op
portunities to beat UCLA, but was un
able to place the ball in the end zone.
This has been a major problem for
the team all yearâ€”it hasn't scored
when it needed the points.
The contest should be a low scor
ing one, primarily because neither
team has displayed a powerful of
fense during the year. Also, Stanford's
defense has been the bright spot of
the team, and excluding the Minnesota

game, has kept the Indians in winning
distance to the final minutes.
Cards 6 Point Favorites
On the basis of the anticipated low
scoring game, and the strength of
the Stanford defense, the Indians have
been given a six point edge in pre
game predictions. Stanford will lose
starters Rick Derby and Bob Shore
to knee injuries, and placekicker Bill
Shoemaker is still not 100 per cent.
