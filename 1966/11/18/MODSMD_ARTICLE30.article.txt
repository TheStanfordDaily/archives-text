# EIGHT BIG GAMES
## Mural Champs Face Cal 
### BOB EGELKO 
Intramural football teams take a
day's truce in their civil war to face
a common enemy today, as eight
league champions from Berkeley in
vade the Stanford fields to challenge
their Farm counterparts.
Despite differences in the two
school's mural programs, the 3:30 p.m.
Tames will match teams drawn from
similar groups, and which played
their regular seasons under similar
rules.
Nuclear War
Although the strength of the Cal
representatives is hard to predict, a
number of "natural" matches suggest
'themselves. One pits K.X.S., a team
from Berkeley's Nuclear Physics Lab,
against Stanford's Neutrinos.
Alpha Omega, formerly the local

Sigma Chi chapter and traditionally
a fraternity power, meets the Cal
Sigma Chi squad in another natural
pairing. Phi Kap and Lambda Nu,
both of which played big games yes
terday, face teams from Cal's Beta
Theta Pi and Psi Upsilon chapters in
other fraternity encounters.
Stanford eating club and Cal co-op
chapions will be matched in another
game as defense-minded El Toro takes
on Ridge House. Toro allowed just
two points to opponents while com
pleting an unbeaten league schedule.
Dislocations Face Test
In what could be the best game of
the day, the Dislocations (Metallurgi
cal Science), probably pre-tournament
favorites for next week's university
playoffs, face a team from Bowles
Hall, a dorm composed largely of grad

uate students and .according to the
Cal mural office, perennially one of
the top teams in the school.
Unbeaten dorm champions Fremont
and Madera will meet Griffith and
Norton Hall squads to round out the
schedule.
After this weekend's festivities, in
tramural squads begin the four-round
playoff grind Monday, with interest
centering on Fremont-Theta Delt and
Alpha Omega-Dislocations encounters.
Fifteen games will be needed to de
termine a university champion, with
the final round expected shortly be
fore Dead Week.

vade the Stanford fields to challenge
their Farm counterparts.

Nuclear War
Although the strength of the Cal
representatives is hard to predict, a
number of "natural" matches suggest
'themselves. One pits K.X.S., a team
from Berkeley's Nuclear Physics Lab,
against Stanford's Neutrinos.
Alpha Omega, formerly the local

Sigma Chi chapter and traditionally
a fraternity power, meets the Cal
Sigma Chi squad in another natural
pairing. Phi Kap and Lambda Nu,
both of which played big games yes
terday, face teams from Cal's Beta
Theta Pi and Psi Upsilon chapters in
other fraternity encounters.
Stanford eating club and Cal co-op
chapions will be matched in another
game as defense-minded El Toro takes
on Ridge House. Toro allowed just

the top teams in the school.
Unbeaten dorm champions Fremont
and Madera will meet Griffith and
Norton Hall squads to round out the

After this weekend's festivities, in
tramural squads begin the four-round
playoff grind Monday, with interest
