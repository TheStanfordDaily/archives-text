# Big Game Theme: Look For Unexpected
## 
### RAFAEL PALACIO 
In the most important game of the
year, as far as Stanford rooters are
concerned, the Indian journey to
Berkeley to play the pesky California
Golden Bears, in the 69th Big Game,
which dates back to 1892.
The history of the Big Game has
been a long and colorful one. The

Big Game has always been one of the
most exciting college football games
played.
In the first Big Game, Stanford
was the underdog, but the Indians
managed to upset the powerful Cal
team by a 14-10 score. An interesting
sidelight to this game is the fact that
the start of the game was held up
an hour because neither team had
remembered to bring a football.
The greatest Big Game is gen
erally considered to be the 1924
battle. Cal had a very powerful team,
commonly touted as the "Andy Smith
Wonder team." But the Cardinals by
playing inspired ball managed to score
a moral victory, with a 20-20 tie.
The greatest game in modern times
has to be the 1959 contest held on
the farm. Stanford quarterback Dick
Norman set two N.C.A.A. records
as he completed 34 of 39 passes for
401 yards. But even so, the Indians
were turned back 20-17 by a deter
mined Cal squad.
The Big Game has seen players
come into their own as stars, as Nor
man did in 1959. In 1924 Bobby Sher
man, getting a chance to play only
because the first stringer "Locomotive
Smith" had been declared ineligible,
ran back a punt 105 yards for the
winning touchdown.
And in more recent years, take
1964, big chief Dave Lewis in his
sophomore year, defeated the Bears
almost single-handedly as he put on
a passing and running show that
obscured the brilliant performance of
Cal quarterback Craig Morton.
There it leaves to oe seen who will
blossom into a star in tomorrow's
ballgame. Perhaps somewhere un
noticed and sitting on the bench for
nine straight games lies a man who
will win Big Game for his team.
