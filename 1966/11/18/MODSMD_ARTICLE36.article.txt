# Dave Harris May Get Big Game Ball
## 
### BOB THIERIOT 
If Stanford wins this year's Big Game, Dave Harris could be
sporting the game ball in his trophy case next week, should Stan
ford end John Mason have anything to say about it. Comment
ing on the upcoming game, he said, "Gosh and Golly, I sure
hope we can do it for the student body. (P.S. And if we win

we'll dedicate it to Ole Harris.)"
Some of the players did not
want to discuss the game of the
season. The most frequent state
ment was, "No." Jack Root,
fullback and Stanford's leading
rusher this year, though was
definite, saying the Indians
would romp over the Bears by
two touchdowns. The Indians are
six point favorites to win their
sixth straight Big Game.
Defensive star Donn Ren
wick was unsure of what he
wanted to say, but fiinally
blurted out, "We'll win." Later,
upon further consideration he
wanted that changed to "We will
win."
Tom Hazelrigg sees the key
to victory. "I think that they
have very poor pass coverage
and that Lewis will complete at
least 70 per cent of his passes.
I think we will do much more
passing than running." Cal's de
fense is practically the worst in
the conference.
Sophomore Year
Andy Carrigan had an en
couraging outlook on this sea
son, which for many Stanford

fans has been a tremendous dis
appointment. He commented, "I
think, considering the number
of sophomores on the team, we
had a great year and next year
we'll have a great team. The
Cal game will be a big indica
tion of how the sophomores have
come around."
Center Tim Sheehan had a dif
ferent point of view—"Most of
the players have let themselves
and the coaches down by losing
close games because we did not
score when it was important, i.e.
the UCLA game. In this last
game we will give 100 per cent
to regain our lost pride and
finish the season as strong as
we can." Stanford was inside the
UCLA 20 yards line three times
without scoring at all.
Bill Shoemaker has been one
of Stanford's more spectacular
sophomores this season. He is
an ace place kicker, holding the
Stanford record for longest field
goal. With help from his laugh
ing roommate, he said, "We
will try to make Cal toe the
mark."

season. The most frequent state
ment was, "No." Jack Root,
fullback and Stanford's leading
rusher this year, though was
definite, saying the Indians
would romp over the Bears by
two touchdowns. The Indians are
six point favorites to win their
sixth straight Big Game.
Defensive star Donn Ren
wick was unsure of what he
wanted to say, but fiinally
blurted out, "We'll win." Later,
upon further consideration he
wanted that changed to "We will
win."
Tom Hazelrigg sees the key
to victory. "I think that they
have very poor pass coverage
and that Lewis will complete at
least 70 per cent of his passes.
I think we will do much more
passing than running." Cal's de
fense is practically the worst in
the conference.
Sophomore Year
Andy Carrigan had an en
couraging outlook on this sea
son, which for many Stanford

fans has been a tremendous dis
appointment. He commented, "I
think, considering the number
of sophomores on the team, we
had a great year and next year
we'll have a great team. The
Cal game will be a big indica
tion of how the sophomores have
come around."
Center Tim Sheehan had a dif
ferent point of view—"Most of
the players have let themselves
and the coaches down by losing
close games because we did not
score when it was important, i.e.
the UCLA game. In this last
game we will give 100 per cent
to regain our lost pride and
finish the season as strong as
we can." Stanford was inside the
UCLA 20 yards line three times
without scoring at all.
Bill Shoemaker has been one
of Stanford's more spectacular
sophomores this season. He is
an ace place kicker, holding the
Stanford record for longest field
goal. With help from his laugh
ing roommate, he said, "We
will try to make Cal toe the
mark."
If Stanford wins this year's Big Game, Dave Harris could be
sporting the game ball in his trophy case next week, should Stan
ford end John Mason have anything to say about it. Comment
ing on the upcoming game, he said, "Gosh and Golly, I sure
hope we can do it for the student body. (P.S. And if we win

we'll dedicate it to Ole Harris.)"
Some of the players did not
want to discuss the game of the
season. The most frequent state
