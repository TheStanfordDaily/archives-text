# Soccer Team Faces Chico In Final Contest Of Season
## 
### BILL GRAHAM 
Stanford's injury-ridden var
sity soccer team travels to Chico
State for the final game of the
season, Friday at 1 p.m.
Chico's team has grown
stronger with each week and
Card coach Fred Priddle looks
for a hard game. Chico has re
cently lost two squeakers, to the
University of San Francisco and
Cal, losing to Cal in overtime.
The Tribe goes into the game
missing three starters. Two
were laid low by injuries and
one succumbed to the draft test.
Guther Brandt, who was con
verted to goalie earlier in the
season after the Indians lost all
their regular goal tenders, is still
out with an ankle injury that
he suffered against the Univer
sity of Pacific. Kenny Nystrom
has a six-stitch gash in his head
and inside Bill Hurlburt is
struggling with his draft board.
Four Honored
Four Stanford players were
honored by being selected to
play in a game against a team
made up of area club players,
to determine who would go to
St. Louie for the final picks for
the U.S. Olympic soccer team.
John Cox, Bill Palmer, Dave

Wytock and Pete Mooch played
on the team that beat the club
players, 3-2. Cox and Palmer
each scored a goal and Cox had
an assist on the only other
score. The players who will go
to St. Louis will be announced
on Monday.
