# 'BIG SPLASH' IN BERKELEY
## Polo Torpedoes Aimed At Cal 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER Sports Editor 
Nothing softens your BEARd
like a hot, steaming pool.
And after Bear Hair is soft,
the Stanford water poloists
will be out to cut it off—cut it
all off—in what could hardly
be termed a comfort shave.
Stanford (10-5) travels to
Berkeley thi6 afternoon to face
the Bears at 3 p.m. The fresh
man teams play at 4 p.m.
Cal beat the Indians, 10-9
early in the season. Stanford
first team Ail-American Gary
Sheerer had to watch the abor
tive encounter from the side
lines, nursing an injured ankle.
Big 1 Chance
Stanford's water polo team
now bears little resemblance to
the squad that lost to Cal. The
poloists have marked steady
improvement, though frustrated
by one goal losses to USC (7-6)
and UCLA (9-8). UCLA bombed
Cal, 13-6, in their last match.
Cal's big gun is loaded with
Barry Weitzenberg, who scored
six of Cal's 10 goals against
Stanford. John Shores gives the
Berkeley front line great hurt
potential.
Gary Sheerer leads the Stan
ford scorers with 35 goals and
22 assists—which boils down to
about 5 goals a game. John
Parker has hit 30 goals and 14
assists. Mark Parmely, with 27
goals, stands the Indian shoot
ers on a firm tripod.

Greg Buckingham, Luis Ni
colao, Bill Meyer, Pete Ready,
and Bill Derrig, who have all
accounted for better than 15
goals for the season, can make
the net burn if an opponent's
defense looks at Sheerer, Park
er, and Parmely too long.
Mike Sorem has been cement
ing bricks in front of the In
dian goal at an ever-increasing
rate. Sorem has made 130
saves in the season, allowing
only 69 goals, an incredibly low
ratio.
The varsity will have a chance
to repeat the little Big Game

next week in the Northern Cali
fornia Open Water Polo Tourna
ment.
The Stanford frosh swallowed
large quantities of gas-filled wa
ter in their first three games,
losing one of them to Cal by
15 goals. Since then, the Pa
pooses have won 9 of their last
10.
Relying on the strong and ac
curate arms of Wayne Wilson
and Tom Hill and a highly devel
oped teamwork that was utterly
absent at the season's start, the
Papooses will be out for a mini
scalping of the Cal Cubs.

Berkeley thi6 afternoon to face
the Bears at 3 p.m. The fresh
man teams play at 4 p.m.
Cal beat the Indians, 10-9
early in the season. Stanford
first team Ail-American Gary
Sheerer had to watch the abor
tive encounter from the side
lines, nursing an injured ankle.
Big 1 Chance
Stanford's water polo team
now bears little resemblance to
the squad that lost to Cal. The
poloists have marked steady
improvement, though frustrated
by one goal losses to USC (7-6)
and UCLA (9-8). UCLA bombed
Cal, 13-6, in their last match.
Cal's big gun is loaded with
Barry Weitzenberg, who scored
six of Cal's 10 goals against
Stanford. John Shores gives the
Berkeley front line great hurt
potential.
Gary Sheerer leads the Stan
ford scorers with 35 goals and
22 assists—which boils down to
about 5 goals a game. John
Parker has hit 30 goals and 14
assists. Mark Parmely, with 27
goals, stands the Indian shoot
ers on a firm tripod.

Greg Buckingham, Luis Ni
colao, Bill Meyer, Pete Ready,
and Bill Derrig, who have all
accounted for better than 15
goals for the season, can make
the net burn if an opponent's
defense looks at Sheerer, Park
er, and Parmely too long.
Mike Sorem has been cement
ing bricks in front of the In
dian goal at an ever-increasing
rate. Sorem has made 130
saves in the season, allowing
only 69 goals, an incredibly low
ratio.
The varsity will have a chance
to repeat the little Big Game

next week in the Northern Cali
fornia Open Water Polo Tourna
ment.
The Stanford frosh swallowed
large quantities of gas-filled wa
ter in their first three games,
losing one of them to Cal by
15 goals. Since then, the Pa
pooses have won 9 of their last
10.
Relying on the strong and ac
curate arms of Wayne Wilson
and Tom Hill and a highly devel
oped teamwork that was utterly
absent at the season's start, the
Papooses will be out for a mini
scalping of the Cal Cubs.
Nothing softens your BEARd
like a hot, steaming pool.
And after Bear Hair is soft,
the Stanford water poloists
will be out to cut it off—cut it
all off—in what could hardly
be termed a comfort shave.
