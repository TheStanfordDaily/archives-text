# Monkey On My Back
## Split Spirit Haunts Stanford; Can Two Cultures Coexist? 
### Mike Couzens 
"There is harmony in the bend
ing back, as in the case of the
bow and lyre."
—Heraclitus
Are skill at archery and lyri
cal sensitivity truly complemen
tary? Perhaps the time has come
to challenge this ancient rubric.
Athlete and scholar can al
ways exist side by side. The
combination of their virtues,
seen at its best in the Rhodes
Scholar, is a high ideal.
But what works with a few
persons clashes with the com
munity. A bow culture the
athlete and a lyre culture
the scholar do not build upon
one another.
Each strives to exemplify
"The Spirit of Stanford.", (This
was the name of a 1940 movie
starring football hero Frankie
Albert, playing a football hero.)
Queenly Conflict
The two cultures conflicted
last week when Cardinals' Board
named the first homecoming
queen in the history of the uni
versity. The lyre culture voted
for an apocryphal character
named Wendy G. Wonka. The
bow culture simply ignored the
protest. They did not reveal
Wendy Wonka's vpte, which
may well have been the true
plurality.
At stake here is more than a
few garlands. Stanford the old
stud farm and Stanford the seat
of higher learning are two iden
tities. And Stanford must
choose.
David Harris' celebrated hair
cut was another incident which
brought the clash into focus.
Those who lauded the "prank"
spoke for one culture. They al
so dated it. Approval came from
those who remembered Frankie
Albert's Stanford. They can
reminisce about panty raids but
they can never understand the
Vietnam protest.
Those who castigated missed
a broader point. The barbers
were a product of their culture,
where the action was probably
not considered malicious.
Athlete's Fossil
The vortex, if not the source,
of the bow culture is bigtime
intercollegiate athletics. Even
though the vestigial remains of
that culture social starata, so
rorities, fraternities gradual
ly disappear, Stanford must
choose. To do so, it must decide
about bigtime intercollegiate
athletics.
Athletic skills, which at their
best can be exhilarating for the
crowd and the player, are not
to be minimized. But profession
alism and public adulation sus
tain a climate which is anti-in
tellectual and anachronistic.
They breed an institutional
chauvanism quite at odds with
the movement against super
national feeling and toward a
world view.
Writing "Cal" on Stanford
buildings, or painting Sather
Gate red was never clever. Now
it is not even funny. "Hate Cal,"
"Eat Bear Meat" may be an out
let. At best it is well-intentioned
duplicity. At worst it provides
verbal banter around an alumni
table.

Social activities, like over
nights, which vastly supersede
the game in importance to stu
dents, bespeak a lack of other
outlets, or of imagination. Is
Big Game a necessary pretense?
Where bigtime intercollegiate
athletics reaches outside the uni
versity its appeal is to bow cul
ture in its finest era. Winning
football attracts and pleases the
alumni who remember Stanford
as it used to be.
The effect of the bigtime in
side is direct when it hires the
archers and pays them to shoot.
Indirectly, it affects campus life

through the activities surround
ing it: Axe Commission, Cardi
nals' Board and general yahoo
ism. It also confers approval on
the many cultural expressions
of the bow.
The question of whether the
two cultures should coexist is
far more important than the
question of whether they can.
Unfortunately, it will probably
never be asked.
Change will only come, as it
did at Chicago, if a long succes
sion of mediocre seasons be
comes an embarrassment to
everybody.

David Harris' celebrated hair
cut was another incident which

Those who lauded the "prank"
spoke for one culture. They al
so dated it. Approval came from
those who remembered Frankie
Albert's Stanford. They can
reminisce about panty raids but
they can never understand the

Those who castigated missed
a broader point. The barbers
were a product of their culture,
where the action was probably
not considered malicious.
Athlete's Fossil
The vortex, if not the source,
of the bow culture is bigtime
intercollegiate athletics. Even
though the vestigial remains of
that culture social starata, so
rorities, fraternities gradual
ly disappear, Stanford must
choose. To do so, it must decide
about bigtime intercollegiate
athletics.
Athletic skills, which at their
best can be exhilarating for the
crowd and the player, are not
to be minimized. But profession
alism and public adulation sus
tain a climate which is anti-in
tellectual and anachronistic.
They breed an institutional
chauvanism quite at odds with
the movement against super
national feeling and toward a
world view.
Writing "Cal" on Stanford
buildings, or painting Sather
Gate red was never clever. Now
it is not even funny. "Hate Cal,"
"Eat Bear Meat" may be an out
let. At best it is well-intentioned
duplicity. At worst it provides
verbal banter around an alumni
table.

Social activities, like over
nights, which vastly supersede
the game in importance to stu
dents, bespeak a lack of other
outlets, or of imagination. Is
Big Game a necessary pretense?
Where bigtime intercollegiate
athletics reaches outside the uni
versity its appeal is to bow cul
ture in its finest era. Winning
football attracts and pleases the
alumni who remember Stanford
as it used to be.
The effect of the bigtime in
side is direct when it hires the
archers and pays them to shoot.
Indirectly, it affects campus life

through the activities surround
ing it: Axe Commission, Cardi

the many cultural expressions
of the bow.
The question of whether the
two cultures should coexist is
far more important than the
question of whether they can.
Unfortunately, it will probably
never be asked.
Change will only come, as it
did at Chicago, if a long succes

everybody.
