Heck With Keck— Go Gaieties!

Editor, The Daily:
Let us endeavor to see who
really has done the most to
cause the potential touchdown
threat of the 1966 Gaieties to
slip through the anxious and de
serving fingers of the cast—the
alleged deficiencies of the pro
duction or the depreciations of
Entertainment Editor Curt
Keck. It is difficult to realize
how name-calling and finger
pointing can enter into any sort
of communication of the gen
eral feelings of the Wednesday
night audience by Keck to
those yet to attend.
We as Stanford students don't
even communicate any delib
erately and seriously injurious
obsterperousness to the Cal stu
dents, let alone to the hard
working cast and productional
and directional staff of Gaieties.
Who, not so incidently, put on
a highly entertaining and suc
cessful show, which was not
just a musical success, but an
obvious success on behalf of
the individual and group per
formances of all members and
on behalf of the creative imag
ination of it's originator and
staff.
In very bad taste and judg
ment were comments slung at
Mr. Alan Mokler's performance.
Mr. Mokler's alleged lack of
forcefulness is just that, (i.e.
alleged). However, we can more
properly examine his perform
ance in the light of effective
ness, rather than irrelevant
forcefullness. Mokler's Jerry
Lewis gestures, entertaining
conversation and ingrating an
tics continually reaffirmed his
endearment to the audience
throughout the play. Mr. Keck
must have been absently-mind
edly scribbling down petty de
preciations during Mokler's pro
fessional performance of "It's
the Tricks."
If Mr. Keck gagged all night
long on the gags that didn't
come off, 99 others out of 100
were laughing, almost tearfully

at times, at the subtle and pert
inent gags that did come off.
Moreover, Mr. Keck lauds the
imaginative and flawlessly sung
number of Miss Adams and Mr.
Serva and at the same time
judges the big-game motif as
being "conceived strictly as a
convenient theme for theme's
sake." There seems to be a
fundamental paradox here; the
fact that a love scene in Big
Game war-time should be ap
plauded and the lack of com
plete relevance of every act to
the Big Game theme should be
depreciated is absurd.
All's fair in Love and War,
Mr. Keck, and in the Ram's
Head Production of Big Game
Gaieties. I propose a toast to
the success of a highly enter
taining production. Oops, you
dropped your glass, Mr. Keck.

• Co-ed Co-op
Editor, The Daily:
Having heard complaints from
both the sexes concerning the
Stanford "dating situation," we
would like to suggest an alter
native, cooperative system that
could be developed quite easily
in our artificial and closed
scholastic system.
We conducted an informal
poll to determine the existent
problems in the Stanford dating
environment.
At first, we hoped to establish
a broad spectrum of student
opinion, but the five student
members of the Committee of
Fifteen were unavailable for
comment. Undaunted, we found
the following principal prob
lems:
Superficiality, lack of mean
ingful contact between the
sexes. Overwhelming competi
tion among the men for only a
few women, leading to "cut
throat techniques." Pinning the
first girl you meet, just for se

curity, with flagrant use of alco
hol to encourage snap decisions.
The Stanford Community, un
deniably poised excitingly on
the "Edge of Greatness," should
grasp this problem by the horns.
A system of draw dating would
eliminate all the problems and
superficiality of the present, se
lective system.
At the beginning of every
school year there would be a
three week moratorium on off
campus contact followed by one
week of free, off-campus con
tact between all male and fe
male students. After this oppor
tunity to realistically acquaint
himself with all of the alterna
tives, each male student would
fill out a list of preferred com
panions, listing all girls on cam
pus in order of his preference.
Each girl, in turn, would pro
vide the university with an ap
proximation of how many hours
per week she's willing to devote
to dating. From this figure a
dating quota would be assigned
to each girl.
Each male, now, would draw
a number and be assigned a
place to begin on his list in re
lation to the availability of space
within the dating order.
Though the selective dating
system worked well in past
years the time has come for us
to re-evaluate a redundant and
harmful system: to fight, mili
tate and even petition against
the misled and conservative stu
dent body and bring Stanford
dating into the modern world.
It has been argued that a
great deal of the problem with
the current selective system is
brought about by immature in
dividuals who lack the consid
eration to call two weeks in ad
vance for a coffee date. But this
is not an isolated few; any one
of 2000 undergraduate men
could and would do the very
same thing if they thought of it
in time.
