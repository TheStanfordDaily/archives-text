## Rumors Cloud Zany List Of Doodle's Daring Deeds 
### Steve Gruber 
Doodles Weaver must head
anyone's list of Stanford prank
sters.
That is, anyone who has ever
heard of him. And most of to
day's students have not. Sur
prisingly, the people who do
know of the Doodles Legend
have the story wrong.
It is rumored that when Win
stead S. (Doodles) Weaver came
to the Farm in 1932, he pulled
up to Encina Hall (then the
men's dormitory) and had his
chauffeur roll a red carpet up to
the door. Not so, says Doodles.
The rumors don't stop there,
however.
It has been said that Doodles
was kicked out of school be
cause he had a picture of Jesus
Christ on the wall, inscribed "To
Doodles with love, J. Christ."
But Doodles denies all of this.
In fact, in a letter written to
a Daily staffer this summer, he
said of the Christ picture,
"What sort of revolutionary per
vert would desecrate a picture
of Jesus?"
Horsing Around
Other rumors say that Doo
dles took a horse up to Encina
where he shot him in a rest
room. The horse had to be
carted out in small pieces after
he went into rigor mortis. Not
so, says Doodles.
Or, how about Doodles betting
his fraternity brothers (he was
a Beta) that he could drive to
Los Angeles in four hours?
Guess again, says Doodles.

All of these rumors tend to
ruin Doodles' real image. If
there ever was a "Legend in
his own time" at Stanford, it
had to be Doodles Weaver.
Really Yours
The real Weaver is still fun
ny, even if he didn't shoot
\horses and have pictures of
Christ in his room.
He was a comedian with the
Spike Jones band for several
years during the late forties. He
often appeared as a television
comedian during the early fif
ties.
While he was at Stanford
from 1931 to 1936, he was an
honor student, a three year let
terman, and director of several
Big Game Gaieties.
But the stories about Doodles
that are true still boggle the
mind.
First Night Club
When his parents went to
Europe in the summer of 1932,
Doodles opened the Weaver
Night Club in his parents' Los
Angeles home. According to
him, he coined the term "night
club."
"I.was the MC-maitre de, and
another pal put together a fine
15 piece band," Doodles said.
"We had dancing contests, en
tertainment, community sings,
imitation gambling, and even
poured soft drinks from whis
key and champagne bottles . . .
it was delightful."
Weaver did reveal last week
in a special telephone interview
that some of his older friends
brought booze to the night club.
Even though this was during
prohibition, he said he didn't
care what they did if they were
over 21.
Dear Son...
Finally Doodles' father heard
about his exploits while still in
Europe and cabled "Dear son. I
understand you have turned our
home into a night club. Are you
making any money?"
One of Doodles fraternity
brothers, Narjeeb E. Halby, now
Vice-president of Pan American
Airways, reported that Doodles
had two cars here, both Model
A Fords.
"He fancied himself as a race
car driver," Halby continued,
"And he would drive around the
circular driveway in front of
the Beta house as fast as he
could much to the annoyance of
the brothers, who would throw
water bags at him."
Kenneth Cuthbertson, who
also went to Stanford when
Doodles was here, and is now
Stanford's Vice President for
Finance, recalled some of Doo
dles' exploits when he was the
head yell-leader.
"He often did a baby-killing
act," Cuthbertson said, "Which
demonstrated the different ways
that you could kill babies."
Cuthbertson also added that
you had to know Doodles or
had to have seen him in person
to appreciate the baby-killing
stunt.
Circular History
But he did take one of his
roadsters to the middle of Palm
Drive, according to the rumors
that Cuthbertson heard, where
he tied the steering wheel and
allowed the car to run around
in circles while Doodles watched
from the side of the road.
And furthermore, Doodles did
not roller skate up to President
Wilbur to receive his diploma.
Doodles must have had a
good time here, at any rate, for
as he wrote in the Stanford
Mosaic, "Because of these di
verse activities and an attitude
of pleasant optimism which I
have never lost, my tangible
status with the interior mechan
istics of the University powers
was somewhat ephemeral, and
twice Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur
had questioned me at length
concerning my objectives."

years during the late forties. He
often appeared as a television
comedian during the early fif
ties.
While he was at Stanford
from 1931 to 1936, he was an
honor student, a three year let
terman, and director of several
Big Game Gaieties.
But the stories about Doodles
that are true still boggle the
mind.
First Night Club
When his parents went to
Europe in the summer of 1932,
Doodles opened the Weaver
Night Club in his parents' Los
Angeles home. According to
him, he coined the term "night
club."
"I.was the MC-maitre de, and
another pal put together a fine
15 piece band," Doodles said.
"We had dancing contests, en
tertainment, community sings,
imitation gambling, and even
poured soft drinks from whis
key and champagne bottles . . .
it was delightful."
Weaver did reveal last week
in a special telephone interview
that some of his older friends
brought booze to the night club.
Even though this was during
prohibition, he said he didn't
care what they did if they were
over 21.
Dear Son...
Finally Doodles' father heard
about his exploits while still in
Europe and cabled "Dear son. I
understand you have turned our
home into a night club. Are you
making any money?"
One of Doodles fraternity
brothers, Narjeeb E. Halby, now
Vice-president of Pan American
Airways, reported that Doodles
had two cars here, both Model
A Fords.
"He fancied himself as a race
car driver," Halby continued,
"And he would drive around the
circular driveway in front of
the Beta house as fast as he
could much to the annoyance of
the brothers, who would throw
water bags at him."
Kenneth Cuthbertson, who
also went to Stanford when
Doodles was here, and is now
Stanford's Vice President for
Finance, recalled some of Doo
dles' exploits when he was the
head yell-leader.
"He often did a baby-killing
act," Cuthbertson said, "Which
demonstrated the different ways
that you could kill babies."
Cuthbertson also added that
you had to know Doodles or
had to have seen him in person
to appreciate the baby-killing
stunt.
Circular History
But he did take one of his
roadsters to the middle of Palm
Drive, according to the rumors
that Cuthbertson heard, where
he tied the steering wheel and
allowed the car to run around
in circles while Doodles watched
from the side of the road.
And furthermore, Doodles did
not roller skate up to President
Wilbur to receive his diploma.
Doodles must have had a
good time here, at any rate, for
as he wrote in the Stanford
Mosaic, "Because of these di
verse activities and an attitude
of pleasant optimism which I
have never lost, my tangible
status with the interior mechan
istics of the University powers
was somewhat ephemeral, and
twice Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur
had questioned me at length
concerning my objectives."
Doodles Weaver must head
anyone's list of Stanford prank
sters.
That is, anyone who has ever
heard of him. And most of to
day's students have not. Sur
prisingly, the people who do
know of the Doodles Legend
have the story wrong.
It is rumored that when Win
stead S. (Doodles) Weaver came
to the Farm in 1932, he pulled
up to Encina Hall (then the
men's dormitory) and had his
chauffeur roll a red carpet up to
the door. Not so, says Doodles.
The rumors don't stop there,
however.
It has been said that Doodles
was kicked out of school be
cause he had a picture of Jesus
Christ on the wall, inscribed "To
Doodles with love, J. Christ."
But Doodles denies all of this.
In fact, in a letter written to
a Daily staffer this summer, he
said of the Christ picture,
"What sort of revolutionary per
vert would desecrate a picture
of Jesus?"
Horsing Around
Other rumors say that Doo
dles took a horse up to Encina
where he shot him in a rest
room. The horse had to be
carted out in small pieces after
he went into rigor mortis. Not
so, says Doodles.
Or, how about Doodles betting
his fraternity brothers (he was
a Beta) that he could drive to
Los Angeles in four hours?
Guess again, says Doodles.

All of these rumors tend to
ruin Doodles' real image. If
there ever was a "Legend in
his own time" at Stanford, it
had to be Doodles Weaver.

Doodles was here, and is now
Stanford's Vice President for
Finance, recalled some of Doo
dles' exploits when he was the
head yell-leader.
"He often did a baby-killing
act," Cuthbertson said, "Which
demonstrated the different ways
that you could kill babies."
Cuthbertson also added that
you had to know Doodles or
had to have seen him in person
to appreciate the baby-killing
stunt.
Circular History
But he did take one of his
roadsters to the middle of Palm
Drive, according to the rumors
that Cuthbertson heard, where
he tied the steering wheel and
allowed the car to run around
in circles while Doodles watched
from the side of the road.
And furthermore, Doodles did
not roller skate up to President
Wilbur to receive his diploma.
Doodles must have had a
good time here, at any rate, for
as he wrote in the Stanford
Mosaic, "Because of these di
verse activities and an attitude
of pleasant optimism which I
have never lost, my tangible
status with the interior mechan
istics of the University powers
was somewhat ephemeral, and
twice Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur
had questioned me at length
concerning my objectives."
Doodles Weaver must head
anyone's list of Stanford prank
sters.
That is, anyone who has ever
heard of him. And most of to
day's students have not. Sur
prisingly, the people who do
know of the Doodles Legend
have the story wrong.
It is rumored that when Win
stead S. (Doodles) Weaver came
to the Farm in 1932, he pulled
up to Encina Hall (then the
men's dormitory) and had his
chauffeur roll a red carpet up to
the door. Not so, says Doodles.
The rumors don't stop there,
however.
It has been said that Doodles
was kicked out of school be
cause he had a picture of Jesus
Christ on the wall, inscribed "To
Doodles with love, J. Christ."
But Doodles denies all of this.
In fact, in a letter written to
a Daily staffer this summer, he
said of the Christ picture,
"What sort of revolutionary per
vert would desecrate a picture
of Jesus?"
Horsing Around
Other rumors say that Doo
dles took a horse up to Encina
where he shot him in a rest
room. The horse had to be
carted out in small pieces after
he went into rigor mortis. Not
so, says Doodles.
Or, how about Doodles betting
his fraternity brothers (he was
a Beta) that he could drive to
Los Angeles in four hours?
Guess again, says Doodles.

All of these rumors tend to
ruin Doodles' real image. If
there ever was a "Legend in
his own time" at Stanford, it
had to be Doodles Weaver.
Really Yours
The real Weaver is still fun
ny, even if he didn't shoot
\horses and have pictures of
Christ in his room.
He was a comedian with the
Spike Jones band for several
years during the late forties. He
often appeared as a television
comedian during the early fif
ties.
While he was at Stanford
from 1931 to 1936, he was an
honor student, a three year let
terman, and director of several
Big Game Gaieties.
But the stories about Doodles
that are true still boggle the
mind.
First Night Club
When his parents went to
Europe in the summer of 1932,
Doodles opened the Weaver
Night Club in his parents' Los
Angeles home. According to
him, he coined the term "night
club."
"I.was the MC-maitre de, and
another pal put together a fine
15 piece band," Doodles said.
"We had dancing contests, en
tertainment, community sings,
imitation gambling, and even
poured soft drinks from whis
key and champagne bottles . . .
it was delightful."
Weaver did reveal last week
in a special telephone interview
that some of his older friends
brought booze to the night club.
Even though this was during
prohibition, he said he didn't
care what they did if they were
over 21.
Dear Son...
Finally Doodles' father heard
about his exploits while still in
Europe and cabled "Dear son. I
understand you have turned our
home into a night club. Are you
making any money?"
One of Doodles fraternity
brothers, Narjeeb E. Halby, now
Vice-president of Pan American
Airways, reported that Doodles
had two cars here, both Model
A Fords.
"He fancied himself as a race
car driver," Halby continued,
"And he would drive around the
circular driveway in front of
the Beta house as fast as he
could much to the annoyance of
the brothers, who would throw
water bags at him."
