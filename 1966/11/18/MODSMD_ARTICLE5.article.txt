# Bear-Beheading Cards Grip Axe
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER Sports Editor 
The University of California has
not seen Big Game's traditional axe
for five full years (with the exception
of a few evanescent, RF-initiated pe
riods of gleeful possession).
The Indians' hatchet, gory from the
blood of five Bear varsity football
teams, must once again stand the
annual risk of leaving its hot, sweaty
Stanford hands. Stanford faces the
Berkeley Bears Saturday at 1:30 in
the California Memorial Stadium.
The Indians will be dangling their
toes over the edge of greatness when
they charge onto the field. Never has
anyone won six Big Games in a row.
(Indian toes got stubbed sorely last
weekend, when the Tribe lost an
AAWU-record six fumbles over the
edge of grease-ness.)
Cool Wind In Berkeley
Cal has come far from burning up
the gridiron grass in 1966, logging an
anemic 3-6 record. Stanford is 4-5.
However, two of the Bears' wins have
come against conference foes. The
AAWU has been unkind to Indians,
this year, to the count of 0-4.
Cal beat Washington State, 21-6, in
an early-season game, and later bump
ed off Washington, 24-20. Washington
slipped by Stanford, 22-20, and poured
cement into UCLA's shoes, 16-3. San
Jose stung the Bears brutally, 24-0.
Dave Lewis will be back at the
quarterback position he made for him
self in the 1964 Big Game. Lewis mov
ed the Tribe to three touchdowns to

overcome a 3-0 halftime Bear advan
tage in '64.
Lewis Baek To Business
A sore shoulder moved Lewis away
from the throwing chores at the start
of the year. Injuries to Gene Wash
ington and Chuck Williams left Stan
ford with a gaping hole behind the
line against Air Force. Lewis plugged
f he hole with more than casual in
terest.
Lewis threw 17 completed passes
for 181 yards against UCLA last week
in a frustrating cause. Washington's
injury has healed, and the Indians
can now post two quarterbacks in the
backfield.
No anti-war demonstration will in
terfere with the Stanford bombs.
Rugged Red Defense
The Stanford defense blunted Il
linois' running attack, and effectively
contained UCLA's Gary Beban. UC
LA's 10 points against Stanford were
the Bruins' second lowest output.
Monte Mohrman and A1 Wilburn,
both stalwarts of the defensive line,
will represent the Stanford team as
season captains tomorrow. Mohrman
and Wilburn, both seniors, will take
Mike Hibler, Blaine Nye, Bob Bittner,
Marty Brill and Tom Hazelrigg on a
SDoarhead attack against Cal's QB
Barry Bronk.
John Guillory, who intercepted two
John Morton passes in the 1964 Big
Game, is still lurking about the de
fensive secondary. Dave Nelson has
grabbed four errant passes this sea
son and is hungry.
