# Donner, Kaplan Clash
## 
### 
"The University must be willing to
stand behind its students in their ex
ercise of freedom of speech and as
sociation if it is to defend academic
freedom," stated labor lawyer Frank
Donner yesterday.
Law Professor John Kaplan ans
wered with the contention that "aca
demic freedom is a term that the
courts brush aside as soft-headed.' "
The two clashed in a debate over
Stanford's role in turning over lists
of officers of campus po'itical organi
zations to the House Un-American
Activities Committee last summer.
Donner first mentioned that he had
contended in an article in Nation that
Stanford had not even waited for the
names to be subpoenaed before turn
ing them over. He supported this con
tention with evidence but added that
he would consider the problem in the
debate as if it were not true. The is
sue then became simply the Univer
sity's role or obligation to students.
Stand Up
Donner pointed to the subpoena as
an opportunity for "a University that
claims it borders on greatness" to
stand up for academic freedom.
First he maintained and substantiat
ed that anonymity was important to
freedom.
Turning to legality of resisting the
subpoena, he said that any confronta
tion of Stanford with HUAC would
have resulted in defeat for the com
mittee and that past Supreme Court
decisions have shown that such a sub
poena as illegal.

Donner listed six reasons why the
University should have defied HUAC:
(1) academic freedom of the Univer
sity was invaded; (2) the academic
freedom of the students was invaded;
(3) the mandate of HUAC was in
valid; (4) the fact that the University
had the names implied a confidential
relationship which the University
would have to violate; (5) the identi
fication of a student with an organi
zation condemned him for views he
did not necessarily hold; and (6) the
names roceived by HUAC are put in
dossiers available to all Congressmen
for their purposes.
Professor Kaplan discounted the
importance of academic freedom in
his replies. He stated that he was con
vinced that the subpoena was valid
despite Supreme Court decisions to
the contrary. He also expressed the
opinion that Stanford could not win
in a case of defiance, despite the ex
ample of Haverford which did defy
the same subpoena action and re
ceived no repercussions.
Bungling
Kaplan maintained that the failure
to notify the students was a case of
bureaucratic bungling. If the admini
stration had to take time to think
about things, he said, they couldn't
get anything done.
He disagreed with Donner's propo
sition that the University had an ob
ligation to preserve academic values.
"The proper role of the University,"
he said, "Is to let the student and the
government fight it out."
