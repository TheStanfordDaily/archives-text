### 
SOFIA, BULGARIA—The Little Communist Parties of the world
heaped abuse on Red China today at the Bulgarian Party Congress.
China is being accused of blackening the name of Communism
by the things done in the "Great Cultural Revolution" and in pro
moting "the thinking of Mao Tse-Tung."
The Little Parties of the western and underdeveloped world
are worried over losing influence at home—some of them have
almost none to begin with—because of public revulsion from
China's errant brand of Communism.
• Russia Peace Desire Noted
OTTAWA — Canada's Foreign Secretary Paul Martin told Parl
iament today he is convinced Russia and Poland want to reach
a peaceful settlement of the Vietnam War.
But he said he told them forcefully on his recent visits to Moscow
and Warsaw that over-simplified suggestions for ending the war
are not realistic.
He cited as one unrealistic suggestion the proposal for an Ameri
can decision to stop the bombing of North Vietnam unconditionally
and permanently without any indication as to what concessions
Hanoi might make in return.
• Possible U.IS.-China Formula
UNITED NATIONS — A formula for dealing with the U.N. China
question on the basis of "political realities" was reported gaining
ground today on the eve of the General Assembly's annual debate
on the question.
It was regarded as a step toward the eventual seating of Commu
nist China and keeping Nationalist China in the United Nations.
But for this year at least, the Peking government was expected to
be kept out.
• t/./V. Helps Non-Nuclear Nations
UNITED NATIONS — The U.N. General Assembly overwhelm

ingly approved a resolution today aimed at guaranteeing the se
curity of non-nuclear nations.
Adopted 97 to 2, with 3 abstentions, it calls on the 17-nation Ge
neva Disarmament Committee to "consider urgently" a proposal
that nulcear powers promise not to use, or threaten to use, atomic
weapons against non-nuclear states.
• Viet Cong Deterioration Seen
WASHINGTON — Signs of enemy deterioration in South Viet
nam are mounting and some Pentagon officials believe the Viet
Cong and North Vietnamese are finding it harder than ever to en
force their military will.
Sources said today they are basing this optimistic assessment on
these factors:
The North Vietnamese and Viet Cong have not been able to in
crease their net number of troops in the past 15 weeks after a long
period of steady growth.
Viet Cong atrocities are mounting. Last month there were about
190 reported assassinations and sources said nearly half of the vic
tims were local village officials. These are viewed as desparation
moves.
Enemy defections are mounting. Last week 611 men returned to
the South Vietnamese ranks.
Enemy food losses are growing. Last week U.S. forces captured
a record total of over 2,000 tons o frice.
• U.S. War Capability Confirmed
WASHINGTON — U.S. officials moved today to assure critics
that the United States always will be in a position to destroy its
enemies even if they attack first.
Responding in effect to those who hace criticized the U.S. today
in employing an antimissle defense, officials stressed that the
United States now has and always will have—capability to destroy
its enemies.

• Catholic Friday Meat Re-evaluated
WASHINGTON — U.S. Roman Catholic Bishops tonight delayed
announcement about the Church's no-meat-on-Friday rule, although
reports circulated increasingly that they are about to abolish it.
At the end of the fourth day's meeting of the National Confer
ence of Catholic Bishops it was indicated that a decision surely will
be forthcoming tomorrow.
Asked whether a statement could be expected tomorrow, the last
day of the Conference, Bishop Walter W. Curtis of Bridgeport,
interjected:
"I am sure we could not go home without one."
"Especially on Friday," added Archbishop Hannan.
