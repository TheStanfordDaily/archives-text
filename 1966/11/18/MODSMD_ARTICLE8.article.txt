# Carleton Fires Student In Rules Fight

NORTHFIELD, MINN. (CPS)
—"You don't want someone
working for you that wants you
fired."
Carleton College Dean of Men
Merrill Jarehow gave this rea
son last week for dismissal of
a student dormitory counselor
who demanded the dean's resig
nation in the student newspaper,
The Carletonian. His action has
exacerbated a controversy over
campus social regulations that
has disturbed this small, liberal
arts school throughout the se
mester.
Dormitory counselor Pete
Iverson, president of the Carle
ton Students Association, de

manded the resignations of
Dean of Men Jarehow, Dean of
Women Jean Phillips, and Carle
ton President John Nason fol
lowing the issuance of a trus
tees' report denying student re
quests for a liberalization of
school social policy.
Imposed Values
Iverson's column, co-authored
by Men's League President Bob
Masur, criticized the report as
an attempt to impose College
values on students and called
for a policy of non-cooperation
with the school's newly formed
Faculty-Administration Commit
tee on social policy. The Carle
ton Student Association is the
official student government, and
the Men's League has the re
sponsibility for student govern
ment in the men's dormitories.
"We cannot cooperate with a
body whose basic reasons and
premises for existence are ones
which we believe to be invalid,"
the two student leaders said.
The F-A Committee, set up by
the trustees' report to determine
social regulations, includes no

students. Its establishment was
a major issue in the trustees'
deliberations.
Trustee Stands
The trustees took several
other stands which were reject
ed by many students:
• The report said that Carle
ton College does not "condone"
sexual intercourse by unmarried
students and considers such be
havior grounds for disciplinary
action. No provisions were set
for enforcing this policy;
• The College continued its
policy of barring cars on cam
pus.
• The school reaffirmed its
policy of prohibiting students
from living off-campus;
• The question of drinking on
campus, now prohibited by col
lege rules, was referred to the
F-A committee for further
study;
• The trustees gave the F-A
committee the power to deter
mine the number of "open
houses" in the dormitories
throughout the semester, but

said that these visiting periods
for men and women in each
other's rooms must be "well
proctored" and students must
keep their doors open at least
six-inches.
Moral Responsibility
The trustees said they took
these positions because the Col
lege has a responsibility for the
moral development of students
as well as their intellectual
growth.
After the issuance of the trus
tees' report, Iverson co-signed
The Carletonian column demand
ing the ouster of the top admini
strators. Two days later, he was
dropped from the College pay
roll as a dormitory proctor by
his superior, the Dean of Men,
Merrill Jarehow.
The proctors are hired by the
College to counsel students and
to enforce school rules, Jarehow
said. "Pete is still in good stand
ing as a student in the school,"
he added, "but as a proctor he
showed a lack of loyalty and
couldn't work with me."
