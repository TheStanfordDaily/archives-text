The Collegiate Press Service
SAIGON (CPS)—Last year at this time I
was writing editorials calling the American
war in Vietnam unjust, illegal and anti-demo
cratic.
I could still make a case for the last two (it
has occurred to me since that a just war is
a contradiction in terms). But after a month
in Vietnam I am clear on one thing: nothing
here is that simple, nothing is that black-and
white.
Those who talk about Vietnam in these
terms, and on the other hand those who mouth
cliches about defending democracy and free
dom against Communist aggression, have re
duced one of the most complicated and agoniz
ing situations in modern history to shibboleths.
Worse, they have succeeded in making these
shibboleths virtually the only terms of the
public debate on Vietnam.
The following analysis is quasi-sociological.
It may strike some as an intellectual game;
I see it rather as an attempt to step back a
bit and establish a frame of reference against

which further analysis and interpretation may
be measured. It may also suggest some of the
hazards involved in basing value judgments
either on deadline press reports or on personal
political preferences.
It is based on three assumptions: (1) What
is happening here is as important as what
should be happening here; (2) What is hap
pening may in the course of time affect what
should happen, i.e., the use of power and the
objective conditions to which it gives rise
may either undermine or create a moral
prerogative: morality, like power, is not static,
and must sometimes be measured in relative
terms; (3) Neither what is happening here nor
what should be happening here are very
adequately understood by most Americans.

There is a struggle going on in South Viet
nam between two groups of people, each of
them numbering several millions: in effect
they are two separate societies, co-existing
within the same geographical boundaries. Each
is trying to organize, strengthen and sanction
itself while weakening or destroying the other.
Though each group numbers millions, they
are both led by relatively small elites which
have developed their own traditions, their
own social values, and their own vested in
terests.

The majority in each group are people
who, through varying degrees of sophistica
tion, are influenced by the traditions and
values of their elite but have little stake in its
vested interests.
Staying Alive
They are people like civil servants, inter
ested in salaries and a modicum of culture,
personal freedom and opportunity for advance
ment; or merchants, interested in the free
flow of trade and economic stability; or sol
diers, interested in winning without getting
killed, recognition for bravery and home leave;
or farmers, interested in the weather, the
market for pigs, owning their land and being
left alone. These people have been at war for
over 20 years; almost all of them are inter
ested instaying alive.
This is not to say that the majority in each
group do not participate in the culture of their
elites—they do, and often by choice. But it
seems likely that in a showdown many in
either group would be willing to dissociate
themselves from their own elite and ex
change its culture for that of the other, so
long as their own popular and private in
terests were not seriously threatened.
In other words, the ideological and ma
terial interests of the two elites are not quite
so important to their respective sub-groups,

except where expert and intense propaganda
has taken effect over long periods of time (as
it has in some areas on both sides).
This means that fundamentally at issue
within South Vietnam are the traditions, social
values and vested interests of two opposing
elites, fighting to destroy each other's control
over substantial portions of the population.
♦ * * ♦
In such a situation, the distinction between
being supported by and exercising control
over different elements of the population
is at best a hazy one. The question is illustrated
by the importance that both sides attach to
the concept of "infrastructure" or its equiva
lent in Vietnamese, ha tang co so. Broadly
speaking, an infrastructure is any system of
organized authority.
Implicit in the concept is the idea that an
infrastructure —whether at the hamlet or na
tional level—cannot exercise control over peo
ple without having their support in substantial
degree. Conversely, if control can be estab
lished, support may be developed over time
through popular administration.
The personnel of their respective infras
tructures are the primary weapons in the
power struggle going on here at every level
between the government and the Viet Cong.
Major elements of each infrastructure are

devoted to strengthening it and weakening the
opposing infrastructure (e.g., both sides lay
great stress on the development of strong re
cruiting and propaganda teams, both practice
selective assassination to destroy key lines In
the enemy's infrastructure). Furthermore,
each infrastructure is said to be heavily in
filtrated by agents of the opposing one.
Significiantly but not surprisingly, many
Vietnamese believe that both Viet Cong and
government village infrastructures are now
much weaker than the traditional village pow
er structure prior to the coming of colonialism
or communims.
The Elite
To gain its political—and cultural—ends, the
elite infrastructure on each side has mobi
lized substantial portions of the population it
controls. Each has developed weapons—tech
nological, psychological, logistical—which are
being tested wherever one side can find a
weakness in the other. At the present time,
one side has technological and logistical su
periority within the contested area, whereas
the other appears to enjoy psychological ad
vantage. This is a struggle for power, and no
holds are barred. The skill in highest demand
is that of employing the appropriate weapon
at the right time, whether it be a mortar or
a lie.
