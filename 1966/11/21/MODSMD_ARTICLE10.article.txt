# SUPER GRANDMOTHER
## Mistress Lives On 
### JEFF BINGAMAN 
Saturday night the San Fran
cisco Opera presented the Amer
ican premiere of THE MAK
ROPULOS CASE by the Czech
composer Leos Janacek. Take
the proverbial "casual opera
goers," run a word association
test using the title, and you
would probably elicit some re
sponse about Greek beer or the
high price of rare alligator hide.
Considering that the opera was
written in 1925 and first per
formed in Europe in 1926, to
what can we attribute its rela
tive obscurity and the 40 years
delay in bringing it to America?
For anyone interested in pur
suing such a question, the San
Francisco production makes
plain that the answer does not
lie in the quality of the opera
or in its capacity for being effec
tively performed.
Alive At 342
The sets, the music, the plot,
and the male members of the
cast revolve around the person
of Elina Makropulos (alias
Emilia Marty, Ellian MacGre
gor, Eugenia Montez, Ekaterina
Myskina and Elsa Muller), su
purbly portrayed by Marie Col
lier. The heroine was born in
1565 and at the time of the
play is a cool (in more ways
than seven) 342. As she points
out to her principal suitor, "I
am your great-great-great-great
great-great-grandmother."
To the untutored eye this
sort of arrangement might ap
pear to border on the ludicrous.
As a matter of fact, even the
playwright, Karel Capek, refer
red to his creation as a comedy.
Janacek, while retaining the
humor, manages to give it a bit
ter, almost foreboding touch.
In combining the humorous and

the bizarre, he is forced to make
extremely fast mood changes
in the music.
Orchestra Adjusts Slowly
The orchestra under the di
rection of Jascha Horenstein
manages these changes admir
ably in the second and third
acts, was less sensitive and more
rushed during the first.
Marie Collier is complemented
in her leading role by Gregory
Dempsey as Gregor, Leon Lish
ner in his San Francisco Opera
debut as Dr. Kolenaty, Howard
Fried as Hauk, and Chester
Ludgin as Joroslav Prus. Col
lier and Dempsey had their
same parts in the extremely suc
cessful Covent Garden produc
tion two years ago. Dempsey
convincingly portrays the weak,
grovelling suitor of Emilia, et.
al., whom he discovers to be his
great-etc.-grandmother. Fried
and Ludgin do fine jobs of giv
ing character to their small,
overshadowed parts.
Paul Hager, the director of
the production, is deserving of
special praise as are the set de
signers Leni Bauer-Ecsy and
Davis L. West.

Most critics have taken the
message of the opera to be that
living to the ripe middle age of
342 has its disadvantages. A
more relevant message for most
of us might be that you can
avoid will contests by keeping
your great - great - great - great
great-grandfather's mistress
around to tell you what the old
man meant to do with his prop
erty.
Whichever message you pre
fer, it will be forcefully driven
home twice more this season—
Tuesday, November 22, and Fri
day, November 25.

out to her principal suitor, "I
am your great-great-great-great
great-great-grandmother."
To the untutored eye this
sort of arrangement might ap
pear to border on the ludicrous.
As a matter of fact, even the
playwright, Karel Capek, refer
red to his creation as a comedy.
Janacek, while retaining the
humor, manages to give it a bit
ter, almost foreboding touch.
In combining the humorous and

the bizarre, he is forced to make
extremely fast mood changes
in the music.
Orchestra Adjusts Slowly
The orchestra under the di
rection of Jascha Horenstein
manages these changes admir
ably in the second and third
acts, was less sensitive and more
rushed during the first.
Marie Collier is complemented
in her leading role by Gregory
Dempsey as Gregor, Leon Lish
ner in his San Francisco Opera
debut as Dr. Kolenaty, Howard
Fried as Hauk, and Chester
Ludgin as Joroslav Prus. Col
lier and Dempsey had their
same parts in the extremely suc
cessful Covent Garden produc
tion two years ago. Dempsey
convincingly portrays the weak,
grovelling suitor of Emilia, et.
al., whom he discovers to be his
great-etc.-grandmother. Fried
and Ludgin do fine jobs of giv
ing character to their small,
overshadowed parts.
Paul Hager, the director of
the production, is deserving of
special praise as are the set de
signers Leni Bauer-Ecsy and
Davis L. West.

Most critics have taken the
message of the opera to be that
living to the ripe middle age of
342 has its disadvantages. A
more relevant message for most
of us might be that you can
avoid will contests by keeping
your great - great - great - great
great-grandfather's mistress
around to tell you what the old
man meant to do with his prop
erty.
Whichever message you pre
fer, it will be forcefully driven
home twice more this season—
Tuesday, November 22, and Fri
day, November 25.
Saturday night the San Fran
cisco Opera presented the Amer
ican premiere of THE MAK
ROPULOS CASE by the Czech
composer Leos Janacek. Take
the proverbial "casual opera
goers," run a word association
test using the title, and you
would probably elicit some re
sponse about Greek beer or the
high price of rare alligator hide.
Considering that the opera was
written in 1925 and first per
formed in Europe in 1926, to
what can we attribute its rela
tive obscurity and the 40 years
delay in bringing it to America?
For anyone interested in pur
suing such a question, the San
Francisco production makes
plain that the answer does not
lie in the quality of the opera
or in its capacity for being effec
tively performed.
Alive At 342
The sets, the music, the plot,
and the male members of the
cast revolve around the person
of Elina Makropulos (alias
Emilia Marty, Ellian MacGre
gor, Eugenia Montez, Ekaterina
Myskina and Elsa Muller), su
purbly portrayed by Marie Col
lier. The heroine was born in
1565 and at the time of the
play is a cool (in more ways
than seven) 342. As she points
out to her principal suitor, "I
am your great-great-great-great
great-great-grandmother."
