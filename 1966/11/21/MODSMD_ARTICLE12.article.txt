# 'Intern' Program Beginning Third Year Of Job Placement
## 
### 
The Stanford Management In
tern Program enters its third
year of placing students inter
ested in industrial management
into summer jobs with various
comporations.
The program was organized
two years ago by Scott Mc-
Bride, a senior. Together with
a group of his friends, Mc√üride
started a program which would
introduce qualified students to
the kind of work found in busi

ness careers, and provide th
students with well-paying sum
mer jobs at the same time.
The idea behind the program
was to provide the opportunity
for students to learn whether or
not they are really interested
in pursuing a career in business.
Previously many students woUiiu
finish college still having no
tidea what career to pursue.
SMIP tries to help some of these
students make up their minds
before graduation.
Active Interest
The program does more th<n
provide a group of companies
with a bunch of messenger boys
for the summer, primarily be
cause the corporations partici
pating in the program take an
active interest in the students
who work for them during the
summer.
When the student reports to
the corporation to which he is
assigned, a member of the
personnel department gives him
a week of orientation in the
company's structure, tradition,
and policies. The intern then
works under different depar'-
ment heads who oversee his per
formance in their respective
areas. During the ten to twelve
weeks of his summer job, the
intern works as a temporary of
ficer in the firm.
The program is a highly selec
tive program, due to both tl""'
limited number of positions
available with the participating
companies, and due to the fact
that, since the companies spend
a lot of time and money on
their interns, they want only
students that are the most in
terested and qualified.
More To Participate
At this time ten corporations,
Bank of America, Fibreboard
Paper Products, General Dy
namics, I. Magnin, Kern Coun
ty Land, North American Avia
tion, Pacific Telephone, Proctor
and Gamble, R. R. Donnelly and
Sons, and Stanford University,
are taking part in the program.
However, Tom Shanahan, SMIP
Director, hopes to get the sup
port of several more corpora
tions during the coming sum
mer to provide the interns with
a broader choice of jobs.
SMIP will hold an introduc
tory meeting in Tresidder Large
Lounge at 4:15 p.m. tomorrow.
