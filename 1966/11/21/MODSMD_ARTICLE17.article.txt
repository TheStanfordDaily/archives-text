### GREG PSALTIS 
Stanford's cross country
teams started the Big Game
weekend right as they both
edged their California oppo
nents Thursday afternoon at the
Bears' 4.0 mile course.
The varsity squad upset the
Bears 26-29. Earlier this year
California was a 21-35 victor
over the Indians. Coach Jerry
Barland said that the fact that
the varsity could come back
and defeat the same team after
a previous defeat spoke highly
for the Cards' competitive cour
age and team spirit.
Price Wins Race
California's Bob Price won the
race. For the Indians, Jim Let
terer took stcond, Bob Kelley
fourth, Brook Thomas fifth, Bob
Anchondo seventh and Randy
Hyvonen ninth. The win put the
varsity's final season record at
2-4.
Looking back on the just com
pleted season, Barland had sev
eral comments about his varsity
runners. He feels that Jim Let
ttrer, a junior, started laying
the foundation to becoming a
truly outstanding distance run
ner.
Letterer Named Captain
His consistency this year has
been instrumental in the Cards'
success. Barland named Letterer
this year's outstanding varsity
runner and team captain.

Junior Bob Kelley was termed
the most improved runner by
Barland. He showed throughout
the season that he was a tough
competitor in distance races.
Last week he missed most of
the workouts due to having (he
flu, yet still placed fourth
against California.
Sophomore Brook Thomas
was cited for improving all year
long. Barland pointed out that
Thomas did a very good job
Thursday against California.
Bob Anchodo, another sopho
more, came up with several
good, solid performances over
the year.
Randy Hyvonen, the only sen
ior in Stanford's top seven vars
ity runners, has improved his
time by almost a minute over
his best last year. Barland is
looking for Hyvonen to be
strong in the mile and a half
this spring.
Others who ran with the vars
ity this year include senior Jack
O'Brien, juniors Mike Jacobs
and John Boeschen and sopho
mores Mike Donley, Bruce
Sramtk and Rich Douglas.
Perfect Record
The Stanford freshman team
ended its season with a perfect
record as it defeated California,
27-30. The team's overall
strength was shown in the fact
that California runners took
first and second in the race, but

the Indians still won the meet.
Greg Brock led the freshmen
as he finished third. Rounding
out the scoring members of the
fi-eshman team wtre Sterling
Sperin fourth, Chuck Men/ fifth.
Dave Red wine seventh and Tom
Ross eighth.
Barland, as would be ex
pected, was very proud of this
year's undefeated freshm a n
team. He said that the whole
team exemplified the kind of
team spirit and pride that all
coaches hope for their teams to
have.
Brock, Menz Co-captains
Barland named Greg Brock
and Chuck Menz as the 1966
co-captains. These two runners
led the freshman all year to
their perfect record as well as
first places in the Sacramento
Invitational and Northern Call
fornia Invitational meets.
Other freshman runners this
year included Steve Karpinos,
Bruce Masse, Bob Rund, Gary
Montante, Morris Wee, Paul
Kaplan, Allan Jakosa and
Chuck Jordan.
Barland said of all his runners
that they were willing to pay
the price to succeed. Without
this willingness, he said, they
never would have enjoyed the
season they had.
In light of the fact that prac
tically the entire varsity will re
turn next year, plus the fresh
men, Barland is looking forward
to having a highly successful
season next year.
The California meet closc-d the
dual meet seasons for both
teams. Saturday the freshman
team and Jim Letterer, repre
senting the varsity, will com
pete in a meet at Lake Tahoe.
