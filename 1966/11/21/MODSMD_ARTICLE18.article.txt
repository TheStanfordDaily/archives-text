# Undergraduate Library Opens Today
## 
### PAT McMAHON 
Alter weeks of delay, the new
Undergraduate Library opens
today.
According to Warren B. Kuhn,
librarian of the new addition to
the campus, the library will pro
vide, "a continual invitation to
books ... in the subject-oriented
book pavilions and reading
rooms . . . attractive alcoves of
open shelved volumes."
The library opens with a col
lection of over 43,000 books as
well as 423 periodicals and ten
daily newspapers.
Changes
The changes of the new li
brary over other Stanford li
braries and libraries in general
are numerous, varied, and im
proved. It opens at 8 a.m. Mon
days through Saturdays, and at
1 p.m. on Sundays. Closing time
is midnight every night.
The two-hour reserves will be
held at the loan desk on the
second floor, but the one day,
and one week books will be in
terfiled in the general collection.

Books will be checked out for
two week periods.
Book returns also can be made
at the loan desk. The two-hours
books at the chute on the left
end of the desk, and the others
on the right end. After closing
hours, books can be returned at
the return chute by the Escon
dido road entrance.
Reference Librarians
Also outstanding in the new
library is the reference librarian
system. In addition to the Chief
Librarian, they have reference
librarians who have specialities
in particular areas.
Mrs. Ann Coder will assist
students in classics, French lit
erature, philosophy, and reli
gion. Peter Johnson specializes
in sociology, and political sci
ence, Frederick Lynden in world
and American history, and eco
nomics.
Miss Joan Martus takes in the
areas of fine arts, archaeology,
foreign laugauges and litera
tures. Mrs. Trudi Ralston ex
perts in general bibliography;

and Mrs. Isabel Sewell in gen
eral literature, English and
American literature.
Smoking
Smoking will be permitted on
the first floor, the outdoor ter
races, and in area 330 of the
third floor. No food or beverages
are permitted in the library prop
er, but a snack lounge on the
first floor will be opened short
ly.
Another change is the fact
that every student, in fact, every
person using the library will
have all his belongings checked
upon leaving to make sure that
all his books are properly
checked out.
These, and the planning of the
library, can be accredited not
only to Dr. Rutherford D. Rog
ers, Director of University Li
braries, and to Warren B. Kuhn,
Director of the new library, but
also to David Weber and Elmer
Grieder, Associate Directors ol
University Libraries, and Jack
Plotkin, head of circulation for
the libraries.

The new library is truly a hy
brid of many features that have
been successfully used in other
libraries.
The alcove arrangement was
adopted from Quincy House at
Harvard, while the idea of the
reference alcove stems from the
Lamont Library, also at Har
vard.
Signs
The area signs are derived
from those at the University of
Santa Clara Library. The char
acter of the pavilions had their
start at the Tower Library at
Dartmouth, the Alumni Room
at Bowdoin, and the Morrison
Room at Cal.
The form of the check-out
desk comes from Michigan as
well as the transitory nickname
of "UGLY" until the library is
officially named, supplied by the
students.
All in all, the library has taken
ideas from various places, added
some very original ideas of their
own and developed a first class
library for undergraduates.

a Libraries, and Warren B. Kuhn, Librarian of the
v nevv library, inspect the shelves to insure every
thing is set for the opening.

The new library is truly a hy
brid of many features that have
been successfully used in other
libraries.
The alcove arrangement was
adopted from Quincy House at
Harvard, while the idea of the
reference alcove stems from the
Lamont Library, also at Har
vard.
Signs
The area signs are derived
from those at the University of
Santa Clara Library. The char
acter of the pavilions had their
start at the Tower Library at
Dartmouth, the Alumni Room
at Bowdoin, and the Morrison
Room at Cal.
The form of the check-out
desk comes from Michigan as
well as the transitory nickname
of "UGLY" until the library is
officially named, supplied by the
students.
All in all, the library has taken
ideas from various places, added
some very original ideas of their
own and developed a first class
library for undergraduates.

Alter weeks of delay, the new
Undergraduate Library opens
today.
According to Warren B. Kuhn,
librarian of the new addition to
the campus, the library will pro
vide, "a continual invitation to
books ... in the subject-oriented
book pavilions and reading
rooms . . . attractive alcoves of
open shelved volumes."
The library opens with a col
lection of over 43,000 books as
well as 423 periodicals and ten
daily newspapers.
Changes
The changes of the new li
brary over other Stanford li
braries and libraries in general
are numerous, varied, and im
proved. It opens at 8 a.m. Mon
days through Saturdays, and at
1 p.m. on Sundays. Closing time
is midnight every night.
The two-hour reserves will be
held at the loan desk on the
second floor, but the one day,
and one week books will be in
terfiled in the general collection.

Books will be checked out for
two week periods.
Book returns also can be made
at the loan desk. The two-hours
books at the chute on the left
end of the desk, and the others
on the right end. After closing
hours, books can be returned at
the return chute by the Escon
dido road entrance.
Reference Librarians
Also outstanding in the new
library is the reference librarian
system. In addition to the Chief
Librarian, they have reference
librarians who have specialities
in particular areas.
Mrs. Ann Coder will assist
students in classics, French lit
erature, philosophy, and reli
gion. Peter Johnson specializes
in sociology, and political sci
ence, Frederick Lynden in world
and American history, and eco
nomics.
Miss Joan Martus takes in the
areas of fine arts, archaeology,
foreign laugauges and litera
tures. Mrs. Trudi Ralston ex
perts in general bibliography;

and Mrs. Isabel Sewell in gen
eral literature, English and
American literature.
Smoking
Smoking will be permitted on
the first floor, the outdoor ter
races, and in area 330 of the
third floor. No food or beverages
are permitted in the library prop
er, but a snack lounge on the
first floor will be opened short
ly.
Another change is the fact
that every student, in fact, every
person using the library will
have all his belongings checked
upon leaving to make sure that
all his books are properly
checked out.
These, and the planning of the
library, can be accredited not
only to Dr. Rutherford D. Rog
ers, Director of University Li
braries, and to Warren B. Kuhn,
Director of the new library, but
also to David Weber and Elmer

lection of over 43,000 books as
well as 423 periodicals and ten
daily newspapers.
Changes
The changes of the new li
brary over other Stanford li
braries and libraries in general
are numerous, varied, and im
proved. It opens at 8 a.m. Mon
days through Saturdays, and at
1 p.m. on Sundays. Closing time
is midnight every night.
The two-hour reserves will be
held at the loan desk on the
second floor, but the one day,
and one week books will be in
terfiled in the general collection.

Books will be checked out for
two week periods.
Book returns also can be made
at the loan desk. The two-hours
books at the chute on the left
end of the desk, and the others
on the right end. After closing
hours, books can be returned at
the return chute by the Escon
dido road entrance.
Reference Librarians
Also outstanding in the new
library is the reference librarian
system. In addition to the Chief
Librarian, they have reference
librarians who have specialities
in particular areas.
Mrs. Ann Coder will assist
students in classics, French lit
erature, philosophy, and reli
gion. Peter Johnson specializes
in sociology, and political sci
ence, Frederick Lynden in world
and American history, and eco
nomics.
Miss Joan Martus takes in the
areas of fine arts, archaeology,
foreign laugauges and litera
tures. Mrs. Trudi Ralston ex
perts in general bibliography;

and Mrs. Isabel Sewell in gen
eral literature, English and
American literature.
Smoking
Smoking will be permitted on
the first floor, the outdoor ter
races, and in area 330 of the
third floor. No food or beverages
are permitted in the library prop
er, but a snack lounge on the
first floor will be opened short
ly.
Another change is the fact
that every student, in fact, every
person using the library will
have all his belongings checked
upon leaving to make sure that
all his books are properly
checked out.
These, and the planning of the
library, can be accredited not
only to Dr. Rutherford D. Rog
ers, Director of University Li
braries, and to Warren B. Kuhn,
Director of the new library, but
also to David Weber and Elmer
Grieder, Associate Directors ol
University Libraries, and Jack
Plotkin, head of circulation for
the libraries.

The new library is truly a hy
brid of many features that have
been successfully used in other
libraries.
The alcove arrangement was
adopted from Quincy House at
Harvard, while the idea of the
reference alcove stems from the
Lamont Library, also at Har
vard.
Signs
The area signs are derived
from those at the University of
Santa Clara Library. The char
acter of the pavilions had their
start at the Tower Library at
Dartmouth, the Alumni Room
at Bowdoin, and the Morrison
Room at Cal.
The form of the check-out
desk comes from Michigan as
well as the transitory nickname
of "UGLY" until the library is
officially named, supplied by the
students.
All in all, the library has taken
ideas from various places, added
some very original ideas of their
own and developed a first class
library for undergraduates.
