# SU Libes—Pursuit Of Excellence?

"A university, it is said, has
three functions: the develop
ment, storage and transmission
of knowledge. For "storage' read
'library.' Our ability to preserve
experience in books is what
makes development possible —
and the more of this experience
we preserve and pass on, the
faster we develop." Dan Endsley,
Stanford Review, Jan-Feb., 1966.
The Stanford University Li
braries have, in recent years,
come under increasing attack
for their alleged failures in pre
serving experience: an inadequ
ate collection of books, a com
plex and seemingly inefficient
system for locating books and
other materials, lack of enough
study space.
R<\s4'iireh Libraries
The new library is intended
as a library for undergraduates,
not as a research library. For
Stanford to have a good library
system, the Main Library and
the departmental libraries must
become good research libraries.
Perhaps the most strongly —
and most justifiably — criticized
aspect of the Stanford Library
has been its books. Stanford
ranks eighth in the nation in
number of volumes (10,400,000),

yet students and faculty have
charged that there are gaping
holes in the collection; that the
books are sloppily catalogued;
that the Library fails to stock
many standard texts; and that
even when the Library does have
the books, there are insufficient
copies to satisfy student de
mand.
In May of 1966, Rutherford D.
Rogers, director of university
libraries, declared, "Deficits in
the book collections, despite
some bright spots, are a matter
of deep and abiding concern to
the faculty and administration."
Fund Shortage
Almost all of the major gaps
in the book collection are the
result of an historical shortage
of library funds. "The library
has never had lavish support,"
said Rogers.
When the new Undergraduate
Library was offered as a prior
ity package to PACE donors,
for instance, no major giver
supported it; it eventually had
to be financed by allocation of
general PACE funds.
"Many of the gaps in the col
lection today," said Rogers, "are
a result of the neglect of the Li
brary during the Depression of
the 30's and during and after
World War 11, when money was
scarce and much basic research

was going on. Subscriptions to
periodicals were often simply
let expire, so that today basic
journals and periodicals are
missing wnich must be pur
chased.
"The library must both fill in
the holes and still acquire an
adequate number of current
books. We are attempting to do
two things at once."
Budget Increases
Until the late 1950'5, financial
support for the Library, while
increasing from year to year,
represented a declining portion
of total University expenditures.
In 1963 the University spent
only 3 per cent of its total bud
get on its libraries — compared
with 5.8 per cent by Berkeley
and 4.6 per cent by UCLA. In
the past few years, however,
there has been a notable jump
in the Library budget. Despite
a 31 per cent increase in 1965-66,
library expenditures still repre
sented only 4.3 per cent of the
total budget. Approximately 5
per cent of the total budget, ac
cording to Rogers, is necessary
for a good library.
More funds are needed parti
cularly to increase the rate of
acquisition of new books.
150,000 by Berkeley.
"Despite the fact that Stan
ford now has the eighth largest

library in the nation, we are not
keeping pace. We must increase
our rate of acquisition."
Curators Added
In response to complaints
about the general unevenness of
the Library collections, four
years ago the Library began to
hire curators to handle the ac
quisition of new books.
"There are four: once each
in Germanic languages. Latin
American materials, Slavic ma
terials, and Romance materials.
Each curator supplies works in
all areas — philosophy, history,
literature, etc. — in his particu
lar area. The curators are re
sponsible for a significant im
provement in collection build
ing. ... To a large extent this
has become a Library respon
sibility," declared Rogers in his
1966 report. "Many departments
have been releasing their allot
ments for books to the general
fund.
Student Suggestions
Library purchases are made
also as a result of faculty and
student suggestions. Both the
Main and Undergraduate Li
braries provide suggestion boxes
for student use.
"I can't emphasize too much
that the library is very happy
to receive students' sugges
tions," said Rogers. "If you need

a book urgently, come directly
to the order department, and
perhaps we can help you."
The opening the Undergradu
ate Library will not solve the
problems of the collections or
the Main Library.
According to Warren B. Kuhn,
books for the Undergraduate Li
brary are chiefly of three types:
books for the required read
ing, supplementary and corol
lary reading which the professor
suggests and foundation works.
Closer Contact
One of its chief purposes will
be to bring books closer to the
students. Instead of having to
hunt through mammoth stacks
of books geared mostly to re
search purposes, students may
go directly to the library and
find the books the want.
But the Main Library collec
tion must be maintained and
improved. The holes in its collec
tion must be filled.
The point was probably best
made by Rogers at the close
of his 1966 report, "The new
Undergradute Library is a
marvelous step toward a new
level of library operation at
Stanford. It will take persis
tence and persuasion to demon
strate that this is the first major
step, not the last."
