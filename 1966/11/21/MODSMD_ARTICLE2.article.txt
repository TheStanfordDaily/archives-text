# Cards Swamp Cal For Sixth Straight
## Out Of Sight 
### NICK SELBY 
"We've got the Axe! We've got the
Axe!" Ecstatic Stanford fans and foot
ball players ignored the heavy rain
and chanted together at the end of
a historic 13-7 victory over the Uni
versity of California at Berkeley Sat
urday.
The big game triumph marked the
first time in 69 contests that either
team had won six games in a row.
Stanford jumped out to a 13-0 ltad
in the first half and held on by the
strength of ball-control, strong punt
ing, and a stalwart defense.
Big Red Whitewash
The football win completed a sweep
of California in fall sports Big Game
competition. The Varsity Water Polo
team rebounded from an early-season
sans-Sheerer 10-9 loss to drown the
Bears 9-1, and the frosh poloists also
avenged an earlier loss to win 10-8.
The Varsity Cross Country team

reversed a 21-35 loss to upset the Bear
runners 26-29, and the frosh won
27-30.
Broughton Gets Winning- Score
The winning score came on a 17
yard dash by sophomore fullback
Greg Broughton early in the second
quarter. Broughton broke through a
huge hole in the Cal line and raced
up the middle into the end zone.
The play followed two similar pow
er plays up tht soggy middle, one by
sophomore halfback Jon Huss for 28
yards and the other by fullback Jack
Root for seven yards. The three play,
52 yard drive was capped by Bill
Shoemaker's 25 yard kick for the
extra point.
Card's Score First
Stanford scox-ed the first time it got
the ball. Safety Dave Nelson picked
off an errant pass from the hand of
Cal's sophomore quarterback Barry
Bronk and returned it 25 yards to

give the Tribe excellent field position
on the Cal 40.
Fullback Jack Root picked up a cru
cial first down when he dove one yard
on fourth down after three runs
gained nine yards. Quarterback Dave
Lewis, in his last game for the In
dians, passed for eight yards to split
end Bob Conrad, and Root gained 18
more in three carries.
Root scored from the three yard
line when his dive for the end zone
was stopped, and he landed on his
feet to bull over the last Bear de
fender, Mike Stone. Bill Shoemaker's
try for the extra point was spoiled by
the stiff wind and torrential rain.
The Golden Bears were in range of
stealing the victory until the final
ten seconds. Cal had scored earlier on
a spectacular 58 yard return of a
Dave Lewis third down punt by
safety Don Guest.
