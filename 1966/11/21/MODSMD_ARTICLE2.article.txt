# Cards Swamp Cal For Sixth Straight
## Out Of Sight 
### NICK SELBY 
"We've got the Axe! We've got the
Axe!" Ecstatic Stanford fans and foot
ball players ignored the heavy rain
and chanted together at the end of
a historic 13-7 victory over the Uni
versity of California at Berkeley Sat
urday.
The big game triumph marked the
first time in 69 contests that either
team had won six games in a row.
Stanford jumped out to a 13-0 ltad
in the first half and held on by the
strength of ball-control, strong punt
ing, and a stalwart defense.
Big Red Whitewash
The football win completed a sweep
of California in fall sports Big Game
competition. The Varsity Water Polo
team rebounded from an early-season
sans-Sheerer 10-9 loss to drown the
Bears 9-1, and the frosh poloists also
avenged an earlier loss to win 10-8.
The Varsity Cross Country team

reversed a 21-35 loss to upset the Bear
runners 26-29, and the frosh won
27-30.
Broughton Gets Winning- Score
The winning score came on a 17
yard dash by sophomore fullback
Greg Broughton early in the second
quarter. Broughton broke through a
huge hole in the Cal line and raced
up the middle into the end zone.
The play followed two similar pow
er plays up tht soggy middle, one by
sophomore halfback Jon Huss for 28
yards and the other by fullback Jack
Root for seven yards. The three play,
52 yard drive was capped by Bill
Shoemaker's 25 yard kick for the
extra point.
Card's Score First
Stanford scox-ed the first time it got
the ball. Safety Dave Nelson picked
off an errant pass from the hand of
Cal's sophomore quarterback Barry
Bronk and returned it 25 yards to

give the Tribe excellent field position
on the Cal 40.
Fullback Jack Root picked up a cru
cial first down when he dove one yard
on fourth down after three runs
gained nine yards. Quarterback Dave
Lewis, in his last game for the In
dians, passed for eight yards to split
end Bob Conrad, and Root gained 18
more in three carries.
Root scored from the three yard
line when his dive for the end zone
was stopped, and he landed on his
feet to bull over the last Bear de
fender, Mike Stone. Bill Shoemaker's
try for the extra point was spoiled by
the stiff wind and torrential rain.
The Golden Bears were in range of
stealing the victory until the final
ten seconds. Cal had scored earlier on
a spectacular 58 yard return of a
Dave Lewis third down punt by
safety Don Guest.

Thousands of Stanford fans turned
out Friday night for the symbolic
burning of the bear, above. Earlier
that day, Phi Sigs Michael Dennis
and Alan Gillespie burned the bears
by hanging an 18-foot BEAT CAL
banner from the campanile on the
Berkeley campus, left.
Guest slipped between two
would be Stanford tacklers and
then cut to the outside where
he got a key block from sopho
more end Rich Laven. The In
dians were unable to reverse
their momentum in the mud and
could only watch as Guest raced
into the endzone. Dan Sinclair
kicked the PAT.
Defense Shines In Rain
Thus Cal was only behind by
six points, a margin too slim for
Stanford to rest on. But the In
dian defense prevented the

Bears from running more than
four plays in a row the entire
second half. The Golden Bears'
only first down was erased by a
penalty.
Cal ran only 25 plays, gained
no yardage (In fact, lost 53
yards rushing), and punted six
times in the scoreless second
half. The sloppy field prevented
both the Bears and the Indians
from running outside or throw
ing to any extent. However, the
big Card runners waded
through the middle to allow the
offense to run 41 plays and
generally control the ball.

The powerful Card fullbacks
Broughton and Root and half
backs Huss and Shoemaker
found gaping holes provided by
the standout blockers from
tackle to tackle of George Beuh
ler, Larry Volmert, center Tim
Sheehan, Don Swatz, and Mal
colm Snider.
The defense never looked bet
ter than it did in the last two
minutes of the game. With first
and ten on the 31 and a shot
at victory still present, Barry

Bronk faded to pass. Lineman
of the game Monty Mohrman
broke through and smothered
him for a 14 yard loss.
Three other pass attempts fell
incomplete, one being nearly in
tercepted by Donn Renwick.
Stanford took over on the 17
and the game ended with the
Cards on the seven.
The second half turned out to
be a battle of punters, Dave
Lewis for the Indians and Rick
Berry for the Bears. Lewis's av
erage was ruined by an eleven

yard punt at the start of the
fourth quarter, but he prevented
Cal from getting good field posi
tion every time.
Guillory Intercepts
The only time Cal threatened
came in the second quarter on
a seven play dirve that ended
on the Stanford 10 when half
back John Guillory intercepted
a Bronk pass intended for
flanker Jerry Bradley.
Guillory explained after the
game that he expected a slant
in from Bradley and decided to
give him the outside. Bronk
threw the ball over the middle
and Guillory was in perfect posi
tion to pick it off. "If they'd
gone to the outside, " Guillory
added, "I'd have been dead."
Jubilant Pandemonium
The scene in the Stanford
locker room after the win was
one of jubilant pandemonium.
The players picked up coaches
Dick Vermeil and Rodney Rust
and gave them an impromptu
shower. Head Coach John Ral
ston received a similar fate.
Ralston praised his players as
the most dedicated he has
coached, and had especial praise
for the offensive and defensive
lines, as well as his assistant
coaches.
Ralston's Anxious Moments
Ralston felt that the win was
due to his team's scoring early
in the contest. "You couldn't
move the ball in the second half
at all." He felt that the key to
the ground attack was the great
blocking and the size of the
Stanford runners.
The coach was obviously re
laxed, but admitted that he had
some very "anxious" moments
on the field. "Cal was just this
far," he said symbolizing an
inch, "from victory all afternoon
long."
"We've got the Axe! We've got the
Axe!" Ecstatic Stanford fans and foot

and chanted together at the end of

a seven play dirve that ended
on the Stanford 10 when half
back John Guillory intercepted
a Bronk pass intended for
flanker Jerry Bradley.
Guillory explained after the
game that he expected a slant
in from Bradley and decided to
give him the outside. Bronk
threw the ball over the middle
and Guillory was in perfect posi
tion to pick it off. "If they'd
gone to the outside, " Guillory
added, "I'd have been dead."
Jubilant Pandemonium
The scene in the Stanford
locker room after the win was
one of jubilant pandemonium.
The players picked up coaches
Dick Vermeil and Rodney Rust
and gave them an impromptu
shower. Head Coach John Ral
ston received a similar fate.
Ralston praised his players as
the most dedicated he has
coached, and had especial praise
for the offensive and defensive
lines, as well as his assistant
coaches.
Ralston's Anxious Moments
Ralston felt that the win was
due to his team's scoring early
in the contest. "You couldn't
move the ball in the second half
at all." He felt that the key to
the ground attack was the great
blocking and the size of the
Stanford runners.
The coach was obviously re
laxed, but admitted that he had
some very "anxious" moments
on the field. "Cal was just this
far," he said symbolizing an
inch, "from victory all afternoon
long."
"We've got the Axe! We've got the
Axe!" Ecstatic Stanford fans and foot
ball players ignored the heavy rain
and chanted together at the end of
a historic 13-7 victory over the Uni
versity of California at Berkeley Sat
urday.
The big game triumph marked the
first time in 69 contests that either
team had won six games in a row.
Stanford jumped out to a 13-0 ltad
in the first half and held on by the
strength of ball-control, strong punt
ing, and a stalwart defense.
Big Red Whitewash
The football win completed a sweep
of California in fall sports Big Game
competition. The Varsity Water Polo
team rebounded from an early-season
sans-Sheerer 10-9 loss to drown the
Bears 9-1, and the frosh poloists also
avenged an earlier loss to win 10-8.
The Varsity Cross Country team

reversed a 21-35 loss to upset the Bear
runners 26-29, and the frosh won
27-30.
Broughton Gets Winning- Score
The winning score came on a 17
yard dash by sophomore fullback
Greg Broughton early in the second
quarter. Broughton broke through a
huge hole in the Cal line and raced
up the middle into the end zone.
The play followed two similar pow
er plays up tht soggy middle, one by
sophomore halfback Jon Huss for 28
yards and the other by fullback Jack
Root for seven yards. The three play,
52 yard drive was capped by Bill
Shoemaker's 25 yard kick for the
extra point.
Card's Score First
Stanford scox-ed the first time it got
the ball. Safety Dave Nelson picked
off an errant pass from the hand of
Cal's sophomore quarterback Barry
Bronk and returned it 25 yards to

give the Tribe excellent field position
on the Cal 40.
Fullback Jack Root picked up a cru
cial first down when he dove one yard
on fourth down after three runs
gained nine yards. Quarterback Dave
Lewis, in his last game for the In
dians, passed for eight yards to split
end Bob Conrad, and Root gained 18
more in three carries.
Root scored from the three yard
line when his dive for the end zone
was stopped, and he landed on his
feet to bull over the last Bear de
fender, Mike Stone. Bill Shoemaker's
try for the extra point was spoiled by
the stiff wind and torrential rain.
The Golden Bears were in range of
stealing the victory until the final
ten seconds. Cal had scored earlier on
a spectacular 58 yard return of a
Dave Lewis third down punt by
safety Don Guest.

Thousands of Stanford fans turned
out Friday night for the symbolic
burning of the bear, above. Earlier
that day, Phi Sigs Michael Dennis
and Alan Gillespie burned the bears
by hanging an 18-foot BEAT CAL
banner from the campanile on the
Berkeley campus, left.
Guest slipped between two
would be Stanford tacklers and
then cut to the outside where
he got a key block from sopho
more end Rich Laven. The In
dians were unable to reverse
their momentum in the mud and
could only watch as Guest raced
into the endzone. Dan Sinclair
kicked the PAT.
Defense Shines In Rain
Thus Cal was only behind by
six points, a margin too slim for
Stanford to rest on. But the In
dian defense prevented the

Bears from running more than
four plays in a row the entire
second half. The Golden Bears'
only first down was erased by a
penalty.
Cal ran only 25 plays, gained
no yardage (In fact, lost 53
yards rushing), and punted six
times in the scoreless second
half. The sloppy field prevented
both the Bears and the Indians
from running outside or throw
ing to any extent. However, the
big Card runners waded
through the middle to allow the
offense to run 41 plays and
generally control the ball.

The powerful Card fullbacks
Broughton and Root and half
backs Huss and Shoemaker
found gaping holes provided by
the standout blockers from
tackle to tackle of George Beuh
ler, Larry Volmert, center Tim
Sheehan, Don Swatz, and Mal
colm Snider.
The defense never looked bet
ter than it did in the last two
minutes of the game. With first
and ten on the 31 and a shot
at victory still present, Barry

Bronk faded to pass. Lineman
of the game Monty Mohrman
broke through and smothered
him for a 14 yard loss.
Three other pass attempts fell
incomplete, one being nearly in
tercepted by Donn Renwick.
Stanford took over on the 17
and the game ended with the
Cards on the seven.
The second half turned out to
be a battle of punters, Dave
Lewis for the Indians and Rick
Berry for the Bears. Lewis's av
erage was ruined by an eleven

yard punt at the start of the
fourth quarter, but he prevented
Cal from getting good field posi
tion every time.

times in the scoreless second
half. The sloppy field prevented
both the Bears and the Indians
from running outside or throw
ing to any extent. However, the
big Card runners waded
through the middle to allow the
offense to run 41 plays and
generally control the ball.

The powerful Card fullbacks
Broughton and Root and half
backs Huss and Shoemaker
found gaping holes provided by
the standout blockers from
tackle to tackle of George Beuh
ler, Larry Volmert, center Tim
Sheehan, Don Swatz, and Mal
colm Snider.
The defense never looked bet
ter than it did in the last two
minutes of the game. With first
and ten on the 31 and a shot
at victory still present, Barry

Bronk faded to pass. Lineman
of the game Monty Mohrman
broke through and smothered
him for a 14 yard loss.
Three other pass attempts fell
incomplete, one being nearly in
tercepted by Donn Renwick.
Stanford took over on the 17
and the game ended with the
Cards on the seven.
The second half turned out to
be a battle of punters, Dave
Lewis for the Indians and Rick
Berry for the Bears. Lewis's av
erage was ruined by an eleven

yard punt at the start of the
fourth quarter, but he prevented
Cal from getting good field posi
tion every time.
Guillory Intercepts
The only time Cal threatened
came in the second quarter on
a seven play dirve that ended
on the Stanford 10 when half
back John Guillory intercepted
a Bronk pass intended for
flanker Jerry Bradley.
Guillory explained after the
game that he expected a slant
in from Bradley and decided to
give him the outside. Bronk
threw the ball over the middle
and Guillory was in perfect posi
tion to pick it off. "If they'd
gone to the outside, " Guillory
added, "I'd have been dead."
Jubilant Pandemonium
The scene in the Stanford
locker room after the win was
one of jubilant pandemonium.
The players picked up coaches
Dick Vermeil and Rodney Rust
and gave them an impromptu
shower. Head Coach John Ral
ston received a similar fate.
Ralston praised his players as
the most dedicated he has
coached, and had especial praise
for the offensive and defensive
lines, as well as his assistant
coaches.
Ralston's Anxious Moments
Ralston felt that the win was
due to his team's scoring early
in the contest. "You couldn't
move the ball in the second half
at all." He felt that the key to
the ground attack was the great
blocking and the size of the
Stanford runners.
The coach was obviously re
laxed, but admitted that he had
some very "anxious" moments
on the field. "Cal was just this
far," he said symbolizing an
inch, "from victory all afternoon
long."
"We've got the Axe! We've got the
Axe!" Ecstatic Stanford fans and foot
ball players ignored the heavy rain
and chanted together at the end of
a historic 13-7 victory over the Uni
versity of California at Berkeley Sat
urday.
The big game triumph marked the
first time in 69 contests that either
team had won six games in a row.
Stanford jumped out to a 13-0 ltad
in the first half and held on by the
strength of ball-control, strong punt
ing, and a stalwart defense.
Big Red Whitewash
The football win completed a sweep
of California in fall sports Big Game
competition. The Varsity Water Polo
team rebounded from an early-season
sans-Sheerer 10-9 loss to drown the
Bears 9-1, and the frosh poloists also
avenged an earlier loss to win 10-8.
The Varsity Cross Country team

reversed a 21-35 loss to upset the Bear
runners 26-29, and the frosh won
27-30.
Broughton Gets Winning- Score
The winning score came on a 17
yard dash by sophomore fullback
Greg Broughton early in the second
quarter. Broughton broke through a
huge hole in the Cal line and raced
up the middle into the end zone.
The play followed two similar pow
er plays up tht soggy middle, one by
sophomore halfback Jon Huss for 28
yards and the other by fullback Jack
Root for seven yards. The three play,
52 yard drive was capped by Bill
Shoemaker's 25 yard kick for the
extra point.
Card's Score First
Stanford scox-ed the first time it got
the ball. Safety Dave Nelson picked
off an errant pass from the hand of
Cal's sophomore quarterback Barry
Bronk and returned it 25 yards to

give the Tribe excellent field position
on the Cal 40.
Fullback Jack Root picked up a cru
cial first down when he dove one yard
on fourth down after three runs
gained nine yards. Quarterback Dave
Lewis, in his last game for the In
dians, passed for eight yards to split
end Bob Conrad, and Root gained 18
more in three carries.
Root scored from the three yard
line when his dive for the end zone
was stopped, and he landed on his
feet to bull over the last Bear de
fender, Mike Stone. Bill Shoemaker's
try for the extra point was spoiled by
the stiff wind and torrential rain.
The Golden Bears were in range of
stealing the victory until the final
ten seconds. Cal had scored earlier on
a spectacular 58 yard return of a
Dave Lewis third down punt by
safety Don Guest.

Defense Shines In Rain
Thus Cal was only behind by

Bears from running more than

was stopped, and he landed on his
feet to bull over the last Bear de
fender, Mike Stone. Bill Shoemaker's
try for the extra point was spoiled by
the stiff wind and torrential rain.
The Golden Bears were in range of
stealing the victory until the final
ten seconds. Cal had scored earlier on
a spectacular 58 yard return of a
Dave Lewis third down punt by
safety Don Guest.

Thousands of Stanford fans turned
out Friday night for the symbolic
burning of the bear, above. Earlier
that day, Phi Sigs Michael Dennis
and Alan Gillespie burned the bears
by hanging an 18-foot BEAT CAL
banner from the campanile on the
Berkeley campus, left.
Guest slipped between two
would be Stanford tacklers and
then cut to the outside where
he got a key block from sopho
more end Rich Laven. The In
dians were unable to reverse
their momentum in the mud and
could only watch as Guest raced
into the endzone. Dan Sinclair
kicked the PAT.
Defense Shines In Rain
Thus Cal was only behind by
six points, a margin too slim for
Stanford to rest on. But the In
dian defense prevented the

Bears from running more than
four plays in a row the entire
second half. The Golden Bears'
only first down was erased by a
penalty.
Cal ran only 25 plays, gained
no yardage (In fact, lost 53
yards rushing), and punted six
times in the scoreless second
half. The sloppy field prevented
both the Bears and the Indians
from running outside or throw
ing to any extent. However, the
big Card runners waded
through the middle to allow the
offense to run 41 plays and
generally control the ball.

The powerful Card fullbacks
Broughton and Root and half
backs Huss and Shoemaker
found gaping holes provided by
the standout blockers from
tackle to tackle of George Beuh
ler, Larry Volmert, center Tim
Sheehan, Don Swatz, and Mal
colm Snider.
The defense never looked bet
ter than it did in the last two
minutes of the game. With first
and ten on the 31 and a shot
at victory still present, Barry

Bronk faded to pass. Lineman
of the game Monty Mohrman
broke through and smothered
him for a 14 yard loss.
Three other pass attempts fell
incomplete, one being nearly in
tercepted by Donn Renwick.
Stanford took over on the 17
and the game ended with the
Cards on the seven.
The second half turned out to
be a battle of punters, Dave
Lewis for the Indians and Rick
Berry for the Bears. Lewis's av
erage was ruined by an eleven

yard punt at the start of the
fourth quarter, but he prevented
Cal from getting good field posi
tion every time.
Guillory Intercepts
The only time Cal threatened
came in the second quarter on
a seven play dirve that ended
on the Stanford 10 when half
back John Guillory intercepted
a Bronk pass intended for
flanker Jerry Bradley.
Guillory explained after the
game that he expected a slant
in from Bradley and decided to
give him the outside. Bronk
threw the ball over the middle
and Guillory was in perfect posi
tion to pick it off. "If they'd
gone to the outside, " Guillory
added, "I'd have been dead."
Jubilant Pandemonium
The scene in the Stanford
locker room after the win was
one of jubilant pandemonium.
The players picked up coaches
Dick Vermeil and Rodney Rust
and gave them an impromptu
shower. Head Coach John Ral
ston received a similar fate.
Ralston praised his players as
the most dedicated he has
coached, and had especial praise
for the offensive and defensive
lines, as well as his assistant
coaches.
Ralston's Anxious Moments
Ralston felt that the win was
due to his team's scoring early
in the contest. "You couldn't
move the ball in the second half
at all." He felt that the key to
the ground attack was the great
blocking and the size of the
Stanford runners.
The coach was obviously re
laxed, but admitted that he had
some very "anxious" moments
on the field. "Cal was just this
far," he said symbolizing an
inch, "from victory all afternoon
long."
