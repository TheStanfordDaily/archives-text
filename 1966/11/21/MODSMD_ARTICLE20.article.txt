# Stanford Water Poloists Butcher Bears, 9-1
## Sorem Stops Bear Bomb 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER Sports Editor 
The sun shone Friday, but
Stanford's poloists wreaked
havoc in Berkeley water regard
less. The Indians bombed the
Bears, 9-1, to thoroughly avenge
a 10-9 loss earlier this year.
Immediately after the varsity
sated itself with regenge, the
Papooses got a measure of their
own.
The frosh spit back a bitter
early-season 18-9 dose of castor
oil and crammed it down the Cal
Cubs' throats, 10-8.
Portrait Of Futility
The Stanford defense turned

the Harmon Gym pool into Jello.
When the Cal offense managed
to get into Stanford's half of
the pool, it did it little good,
for Mike Sorem had the Stan
ford goal completely boarded
up.
The Indian offense rode down
on billows of steam. Gary
Sheerer scored one goal every
quarter, leaving the smell of
burned goalie heavy on the air.
Bill Meyer threw for two scores.
Pete Ready, Mark Parmely, and
Greg Buckingham each hit one.
Surprise, Surprise!
Cal beat Stanford, 10-9, early
in the year, right after Gary

Sheerer sustained a crippling
ankle injury. Friday, the Bears
ran uo against two players they
hadn't seen in the first game.
Sheerer, a sophomore Ail-
American and AAU 'Outstand
ing Player,' turned on the of
fensive and defensive moves
that earned him his titles. Mike

Sorem has developed from a
disappointingly slow start into
the best goalie in the conference.
Sorem made 12 saves in the
game.
Cal's All-American Barry Weit
zenberg, who did six goals worth
of damage in the first Cal
game this season, could not

squeeze a shot by Sorem. Sorem
stopped seven Weiizenberg
shots, once sutting down the big
Bear on two one-on-one blasts
in machinegun succession.
Bears Bog Down
Stanford put a gluey full
court press on the Bears in the
first quarter. Cal couldn't get off
a single good shot. Stanford,
however, was not so hesitant.
Pete Ready took a pass from
Sheerer and powered the ball
past the Bear goaltender. Sheer
er got one of his own on a lob
later in the period.
Sheerer hit another and Buck
ingham laced the yellow ball into
the cage to give the Tribe a
dainty 4-0 halftime lead. Cal
broke onto the scoreboard in the
third period for the first and
last time.
Cards Chop Out 3 More
The third period was good
for the Indians, too. Sheerer
scored on a fast break, then
Parniely tossed across to Meyer,

who laid in a perfect lob. Par
mely drove across the third goal
of the quarter on a left-hand
launched rocket.
Sorem kept the Tribe goal
chaste for the rest of the game,
while Stanford added two more
to the rout.
Pete Siebert passed to Meyer,
who duly slammed it into the
goal. For the nightcap, Sheerer
sat at half court, faked twice,
and then struck the yellow ball
behind the goalie's ear( which
was already quite full of Stan
ford water polo).
Frosh Swing Soggy Axe
The pool water had barely
washed the Bear blood off the In
dians' axe when the Papooses
got it dirty all over again.
The Papooses jumped out to a
2-1 first quarter lead on shots
by Wayne Wilson and Tom Hill.
In the second quarter, Hill and
Wilson stretched the lead to 5-1
before the Cubs rallied. Half
time left the score 5-3.

Cal outscored the Papooses
in the third period, leaving {Stan
ford with a tenuous 6-5 lead.
Stanford held on in the -last
period. Wilson scored three in
the quarter and Hill made good
his fifth of the day to chalk up
a 10-8 victory.
Sweet Revenge
Jimmie Smith's freshmen lost
18-9 to the Cubs earlier this
season. After losing their first
three, the Papooses have won 10
of 11 games. They will have the
chance to carry the upward
swing to the top tonight.
The freshman compete in the
Northern California Closed
Tournament at San Francisco
State. The frosh must repeat
their their victory over Cal .to
make the finals against San Jose
State. I
The varsity, now 11-5, enters
the NorCal Open Tournament
Tuesday and Wednesday against
Cal, the SF Olympic Club, Foot
hill, and San Jose.

Bear on two one-on-one blasts
in machinegun succession.
Bears Bog Down
Stanford put a gluey full
court press on the Bears in the
first quarter. Cal couldn't get off
a single good shot. Stanford,
however, was not so hesitant.
Pete Ready took a pass from
Sheerer and powered the ball
past the Bear goaltender. Sheer
er got one of his own on a lob
later in the period.
Sheerer hit another and Buck
ingham laced the yellow ball into
the cage to give the Tribe a
dainty 4-0 halftime lead. Cal
broke onto the scoreboard in the
third period for the first and
last time.
Cards Chop Out 3 More
The third period was good
for the Indians, too. Sheerer
scored on a fast break, then
Parniely tossed across to Meyer,

who laid in a perfect lob. Par
mely drove across the third goal
of the quarter on a left-hand
launched rocket.
Sorem kept the Tribe goal
chaste for the rest of the game,
while Stanford added two more
to the rout.
Pete Siebert passed to Meyer,
who duly slammed it into the
goal. For the nightcap, Sheerer
sat at half court, faked twice,
and then struck the yellow ball
behind the goalie's ear( which
was already quite full of Stan
ford water polo).
Frosh Swing Soggy Axe
The pool water had barely
washed the Bear blood off the In
dians' axe when the Papooses
got it dirty all over again.
The Papooses jumped out to a
2-1 first quarter lead on shots
by Wayne Wilson and Tom Hill.
In the second quarter, Hill and
Wilson stretched the lead to 5-1
before the Cubs rallied. Half
time left the score 5-3.

Cal outscored the Papooses
in the third period, leaving {Stan
ford with a tenuous 6-5 lead.
Stanford held on in the -last
period. Wilson scored three in
the quarter and Hill made good
his fifth of the day to chalk up
a 10-8 victory.
Sweet Revenge
Jimmie Smith's freshmen lost
18-9 to the Cubs earlier this
season. After losing their first
three, the Papooses have won 10
of 11 games. They will have the
chance to carry the upward
swing to the top tonight.
The freshman compete in the
Northern California Closed
Tournament at San Francisco
State. The frosh must repeat
their their victory over Cal .to

Stanford's water polo goalie,
senior Mike Sorem, here re
enters the water after making
one of his 12 saves against Cal
Friday. Sorem's standout play
was a key to the poloists' 9-1
win over Cal. Sorem lias made
142 saves while allowing only 70
goals this year.
The sun shone Friday, but
Stanford's poloists wreaked
havoc in Berkeley water regard
less. The Indians bombed the
Bears, 9-1, to thoroughly avenge
a 10-9 loss earlier this year.
Immediately after the varsity
sated itself with regenge, the
Papooses got a measure of their
own.
The frosh spit back a bitter
early-season 18-9 dose of castor
oil and crammed it down the Cal
Cubs' throats, 10-8.
Portrait Of Futility
The Stanford defense turned

the Harmon Gym pool into Jello.
When the Cal offense managed
to get into Stanford's half of
the pool, it did it little good,
for Mike Sorem had the Stan
ford goal completely boarded
up.
The Indian offense rode down
on billows of steam. Gary
Sheerer scored one goal every
quarter, leaving the smell of
burned goalie heavy on the air.
Bill Meyer threw for two scores.
Pete Ready, Mark Parmely, and
Greg Buckingham each hit one.
Surprise, Surprise!
Cal beat Stanford, 10-9, early

Sheerer sustained a crippling
ankle injury. Friday, the Bears
ran uo against two players they
hadn't seen in the first game.
Sheerer, a sophomore Ail-

fensive and defensive moves
that earned him his titles. Mike

Sorem has developed from a
disappointingly slow start into

Sorem made 12 saves in the
game.

Stanford's water polo goalie,
senior Mike Sorem, here re
enters the water after making
one of his 12 saves against Cal
Friday. Sorem's standout play
was a key to the poloists' 9-1
win over Cal. Sorem lias made
142 saves while allowing only 70
goals this year.
The sun shone Friday, but
Stanford's poloists wreaked
havoc in Berkeley water regard
less. The Indians bombed the
Bears, 9-1, to thoroughly avenge
a 10-9 loss earlier this year.
Immediately after the varsity
sated itself with regenge, the
Papooses got a measure of their
own.
The frosh spit back a bitter
early-season 18-9 dose of castor
oil and crammed it down the Cal
Cubs' throats, 10-8.
Portrait Of Futility
The Stanford defense turned

the Harmon Gym pool into Jello.
When the Cal offense managed
to get into Stanford's half of
the pool, it did it little good,
for Mike Sorem had the Stan
ford goal completely boarded
up.
The Indian offense rode down
on billows of steam. Gary
Sheerer scored one goal every
quarter, leaving the smell of
burned goalie heavy on the air.
Bill Meyer threw for two scores.
Pete Ready, Mark Parmely, and
Greg Buckingham each hit one.
Surprise, Surprise!
Cal beat Stanford, 10-9, early
in the year, right after Gary

Sheerer sustained a crippling
ankle injury. Friday, the Bears
ran uo against two players they
hadn't seen in the first game.
Sheerer, a sophomore Ail-
American and AAU 'Outstand
ing Player,' turned on the of
fensive and defensive moves
that earned him his titles. Mike

Sorem has developed from a
disappointingly slow start into
the best goalie in the conference.
Sorem made 12 saves in the
game.
Cal's All-American Barry Weit
zenberg, who did six goals worth
of damage in the first Cal
game this season, could not

squeeze a shot by Sorem. Sorem
stopped seven Weiizenberg
shots, once sutting down the big
Bear on two one-on-one blasts
in machinegun succession.
Bears Bog Down
Stanford put a gluey full
court press on the Bears in the
first quarter. Cal couldn't get off
a single good shot. Stanford,
however, was not so hesitant.
Pete Ready took a pass from
Sheerer and powered the ball
past the Bear goaltender. Sheer
er got one of his own on a lob
later in the period.
Sheerer hit another and Buck
ingham laced the yellow ball into
the cage to give the Tribe a
dainty 4-0 halftime lead. Cal
broke onto the scoreboard in the
third period for the first and
last time.
Cards Chop Out 3 More
The third period was good
for the Indians, too. Sheerer
scored on a fast break, then
Parniely tossed across to Meyer,

who laid in a perfect lob. Par
mely drove across the third goal
of the quarter on a left-hand
launched rocket.
Sorem kept the Tribe goal
chaste for the rest of the game,
while Stanford added two more
to the rout.
Pete Siebert passed to Meyer,
who duly slammed it into the
goal. For the nightcap, Sheerer
sat at half court, faked twice,
and then struck the yellow ball
behind the goalie's ear( which
was already quite full of Stan
ford water polo).
Frosh Swing Soggy Axe
The pool water had barely
washed the Bear blood off the In
dians' axe when the Papooses
got it dirty all over again.
The Papooses jumped out to a
2-1 first quarter lead on shots
by Wayne Wilson and Tom Hill.
In the second quarter, Hill and
Wilson stretched the lead to 5-1
before the Cubs rallied. Half
time left the score 5-3.

in the third period, leaving {Stan
