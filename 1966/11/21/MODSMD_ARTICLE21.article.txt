# S.U. Rooters' Yells Embarraxe Cal Wit
## 
### NICK SELBY 
"Kiss Our Axe!" roared the
rooting section of the Cal fans
after Stanford partisans has just
competed the lengthy Axe cheer.
The parry was weak—Stanford
rooters countered with "You
have no Axe." Cal's rooters,
completely embarraxed (sic.),
were left speechless.
This give and take was typical
of the rivalry between the cheer
ing sections of Stanford and the
University of California at Big
Game Saturday. The Stanford
fans reinforced the victory on
the field with a sound drubbing
of the Bear in the vocal division
of the competition.
McLean At Best
Head Cheer leader Mike Mc-
Lean was at his season's best as
he led the SU rooters to squelch
after squelch of Berkeley yells.
Once, after Stanford had missed
a scoring opportunity, Cal
roared, "Stanford Got Nothing."
Seizing the initiative Stanford
countered, "We've got the Axe!"
There was total silence from
Cal's side, where the truth of
the statement was all too real.
The Axe is now destined for
another year in its case in the
student union.
Perhaps the best RF came
early in the game after Stanford
had completed the elaborate
Stanford spell. Cal roared,
"8.F.D." Puzzled, SU roters
asked, "What does that mean?"
Ignorant silence ensued.
Spirit Tops
The spirit of the SU crowd
was the best of the year, and
one reason was the inspired
steps of the pom-pon girls, who
braved the rain and wind in
their short tunics all afternoon.
One unidentified player from
Stanford thanked all five with
a muddy hug and kiss at the
end of the game.
The Stanford Band, a work

horse all of Big Game week,
was not to fatigued to play in
the rain, either. And finally, not
content with vicarious thrills,
the Stanford fans ripped a Cal
banner into shreds.
