Survivors of six weeks of in
tramural football competition
embark over rain-swept fields
today on the first round of the
University championships. Bar
ring high tides, four first-round
games will be played today and
four more tomorrow, all start
ing at 3:45 p.m.
Pre-tournament seeding pairs
league winners with second
place squads from other leagues,
but past experience has shown
that the runners-up win as often
as not, and from the looks of to
day's schedule the tradition
could well be continued.
Donner vs. Madera: If Brian
Swift can evade the Madera
rush, Donner should be able to
move the ball against the frosh
secondary, not one of their
strongest points. But Donner's
pass defense proved porous
against Fremont, and Madera's
Ken Philpot, a calm and ac
curate passer, will exploit the
weaknesses.
Neutrinos vs. Delts—The Delts
are big and fast enough to give
the Neutrinos trouble, but the
Neutrinos' scrambling attack has
been pulling them out of trouble
all season, and it seems difficult
to pick against them in this one.
Alpha Omega vs. Dislocations
—As Sigma Chi, the fraternity
team's offense showed a ten
dency to roll up a big score
against the weaker teams but
be stymied by the strong ones,
and the change of name should
make no difference. The Disloca
tions will probably score often
enough even against the best
defensive team they've faced.
Fremont vs. Theta Delt —
Theta Delt's high-powered at
tack will severely test the fine
Fremont secondary. The big
ger fraternity squad will put
similar pressure on the Fremont
offense, but Jim Blaschke, if he
plays, could well be quarterback
enough to overcome both ob
stacles.
