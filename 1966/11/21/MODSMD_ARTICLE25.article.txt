"The structure seems admirably to fulfill the
demands upon it created by conditions of the
present day. Those who follow in the future
doubtless will find much they would like to
have otherwise. But it is not expected that the
building will last indefinitely, and ample space
has been left for expansion . . . made for future
needs as they develop . .
George Thomas Clark, Librarian
On the Opening of the Main Library,
July 7,1919
And, today, on the opening of the five million
dollar Undergraduate Library, Dr. Rutherford
D. Rogers, Director of University Libraries,
and others directly concerned with the new
library can proudly announce the same.
Yet the University had better not point too
proudly at the newest addition to the campus,
for even the fledgling might ask about the
quality of Stanford's library system.
What can we tell him?
Perhaps we should impress him with the
fact that Stanford Libraries rank eighth in the
nation by number of volumes.
Maybe an introduction such as the one in
"Your Libraries" is justified: "The Stanford Uni
versity Libraries rank high in resources and
services among the great libraries of the world."
He might also discover that Hoover Library
is one of the finest libraries of its kind, and
many of its collections are unmatched. If he's
interested in medicine, or education, or geology,

he'll find superior collections.
But shelter the poor visitor to Stanford! How
do we explain 31 foot ceilings in the Main
Library? The random separation of books into
Dewey Decimal and Library of Congress classi
fications?
Can the visiting lawyer ignore the fact that
Stanford's Law Library has only 115,000 vol
umes while Harvard Law School Library holds
over one million. Don't let him know that the
Law Library ranks only twenty-third!
But eighth place overall that's first rate.
First rate, if you don't notice that Stanford ac
quires 100,000 books each year, while Harvard
takes in 225,000; Cornell, 167,000; and Berkeley,
152,000. What is first rate in '66, may well be
worst rate in '68.
The Undergraduate Library's opening with
an exceptional collection of general books for
undergrads, but complacency cannot let the
library improvement stop here.
Dr. Rogers, new director of University Li
braries who left his second-in-command posi
tion at the Library of Congress to come here
two years ago, has said, "It is estimated that
at least ten million dollars will be needed to see
the library through two decades of greatly ac
celerated growth."
The new library represents only the first hur
dle, well met, in a long trek towards a compre
hensive library system.

Law Library ranks only twenty-third!
But eighth place overall that's first rate.
First rate, if you don't notice that Stanford ac
quires 100,000 books each year, while Harvard
takes in 225,000; Cornell, 167,000; and Berkeley,
152,000. What is first rate in '66, may well be
worst rate in '68.
The Undergraduate Library's opening with
an exceptional collection of general books for
undergrads, but complacency cannot let the
library improvement stop here.
Dr. Rogers, new director of University Li
braries who left his second-in-command posi
tion at the Library of Congress to come here
two years ago, has said, "It is estimated that
at least ten million dollars will be needed to see
the library through two decades of greatly ac
celerated growth."
The new library represents only the first hur
dle, well met, in a long trek towards a compre
hensive library system.

"The structure seems admirably to fulfill the
demands upon it created by conditions of the
present day. Those who follow in the future
doubtless will find much they would like to
have otherwise. But it is not expected that the
building will last indefinitely, and ample space
has been left for expansion . . . made for future
needs as they develop . .
George Thomas Clark, Librarian
On the Opening of the Main Library,
July 7,1919
And, today, on the opening of the five million
dollar Undergraduate Library, Dr. Rutherford
D. Rogers, Director of University Libraries,
and others directly concerned with the new
library can proudly announce the same.
Yet the University had better not point too
proudly at the newest addition to the campus,
for even the fledgling might ask about the
quality of Stanford's library system.
What can we tell him?
Perhaps we should impress him with the
fact that Stanford Libraries rank eighth in the
nation by number of volumes.
Maybe an introduction such as the one in
"Your Libraries" is justified: "The Stanford Uni
versity Libraries rank high in resources and
services among the great libraries of the world."
He might also discover that Hoover Library
is one of the finest libraries of its kind, and
many of its collections are unmatched. If he's
interested in medicine, or education, or geology,

he'll find superior collections.
But shelter the poor visitor to Stanford! How
do we explain 31 foot ceilings in the Main
Library? The random separation of books into
Dewey Decimal and Library of Congress classi
fications?
Can the visiting lawyer ignore the fact that
Stanford's Law Library has only 115,000 vol
umes while Harvard Law School Library holds
over one million. Don't let him know that the
Law Library ranks only twenty-third!
