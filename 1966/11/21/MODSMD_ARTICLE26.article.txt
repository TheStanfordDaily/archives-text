# Lines Of Communication
## 
### 
Last week's exchange of letters between the
Board of Trustees and members of the student
body underscored the importance of student
trustee communication in the life of a chang
ing university. Both the Student Body Presi
dent's invitation to members of the Board to
attend a conference in January and the reply of
Board President Richard Guggenhime to the
sponsors of the OFF campaign forcused at
tentions on the Board as the source of major
decisions. Yet both letters pointed to a certain
lack of communication which has made the
trustee and student perspectives increasingly
incompatible in the recent years.
While the Guggenhime letter was less than
encouraging to the immediate hope of the OFF
proponents, it did provide a sketch of the
Board's method for considering new proposals
and hinted at the complex ramifications of a
change such as allowing women to live off
campus. However the conflict of student-trustee
perspectives became apparent as Guggenhime
contrasted the OFF proponents expectations of
"preciptious change" with the Board's reliance
upon tradition and longstanding policy. And
much of student-trustee misunderstanding
seems to stem from this very point.
Harris' invitation to the members of the Board
cited the long, "tedious network of bureaucracy"
which separates students from the Board. That
network is, of course, the administration and
principally the Office of the President which
prepares much of the material presented to the
Board. The resulting handicap of indirect stu

dent-trustee relationships was evident last year
in the delays in Changing the liquor policy and
especially in bringing freedom of religion to
campus. The surge in religious activity and the
calm over the liquor changes indicates to us
that direct trustee-student contact would have
brought these changes about much quicker than
the isolated seige of committee reports and
Daily editorial campaigns. Much the same can
be said for the student body's current concern
over open house regulations.
President Sterling's hospitality is making it
possible for trustees to meet informally with
small groups of students, and thus there is a
recognition of the gap between student and
trustee perspectives. But for the majority, stu
dents and student views remain distant from the
trustees, while trustees and trustee procedures
are no closer to students. Consequently we hope
that the members of the Board will accept the
Harris invitation as an opportunity for students
and trustees to share and, we hope, to broaden
their perspective of the changing University.
