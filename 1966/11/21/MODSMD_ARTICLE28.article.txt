## Trustee Letter Irks Student 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
Re. Mr. Guggenhime's reply
to Miss Howell's request: OFF
was the most pompous, preten
tious letter I have ever seen.
Mr. Guggenhime is obviously in
the wrong profession. Since he
apparently thinks he has "the
truth", he should perhaps apply
for a new position. Like God, for
instance.
Mr. Guggenhime's first point
is well-taken. The Board of
Trustees has a right to obtain
all pertinent information before
making so far-reaching a deci
sion as allowing off-campus
women's housing.
His second point is not well
taken. Custom and tradition are
well and good as long as they
are harmless. But when they
impose definite injunctions
against rational desires, they
have outlived their usefulness.
Their influence becomes perni
cious, and they should then be
expunged from University life.
As to Mr. Guggenhime's third
point, I have only questions. If
it is the intention of the Board
that Stanford be a 100 per cent
residence university, then why

haven't new dorms been built,
and men forced to live on cam
pus? Why are more men admit
ted than there on-campus living
facilities for? Could it be that
the Board is inconsistent?
It is not until point four that
Mr. Guggenhime reveals the
pomposity he apparently enjoys
indulging in. And in answer, I
say that upon entering this uni
versity each student, male and
female, does not surrender his
sovereignty to tin gods who sit
on the Board of Trustees. The
students of Stanford are free
adults, and they do not give the
Board a moral blank check to
legislate standards and behav
ior. It is the students who like
Stanford most who wish to
change it, to reform it, to re
move injustice from its institu
tions. The calibre of student who
would accept edicts of whimsy
from the Board of Trustees is
not to be found at Stanford. I
am afraid Mr. Guggenhime
would be much happier at a
junior college, where his caprice
might stand a better chance of
going unchallenged.

â€¢ Please, Operator!
Editor, The Daily:
Last year, when a friend was
living in Roble, the operator
would actually offer to take a
message if I telephoned and my
friend was not in. Moreover, she
seemed to take a personal inter
est in making sure the word got
through. This year my friend
lives in Lagunita. Every time I
try to leave a message I have a
five minute telephonic fight with
the operator before she will take
a simple four or five word note.
Furthermore, this is but one
symptom of the general unpleas
antness and animosity that pre
vails at the Lag reception desk.
The receptionists seem to go out
of their ways to avoid being
helpful. I had been under the
impression that these women
were hired to serve the students
by facilitating communications
rather than frustrating them.
What gives at Lag?
