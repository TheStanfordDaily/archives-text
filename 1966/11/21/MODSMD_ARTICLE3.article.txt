# Delta Tau Delta Barbers Receive Year Of Probation
## 
### CHRIS HARTE Associate Editor 
The 34 Delts who shaved Dave
Harris' head have been placed on pro
bation.
The penalty, in effect until the end
of spring quarter, was announced
yesterday by both the ASSU Judicial
Council and Dean of Students H. Don
ald Winbigler.
Twelve of the students elected to be
tried by Winbigler, an option allowed
under Stanford judicial procedure. All
34 decided against open hearings, an
other standard option.
All 34, in the words of Dean Win

bigler, "violated the Fundamental
Standard in infringing upon the per
sonal rights of David Harris by force
ably restraining him and cutting his
hair against his will."
Winbigler also said that while none
of the 12 who decided to be tried by
him had originally considered his ac
tion a violation of the Fundamental
Standard, all agreed at the time of
their hearing that it was.
Judicial Council Chairman Mimi
Sherman and Dean Winbigler agreed
that concern over Harris' dress and
public image were the major motiva
tion for the head-shaving.
A Protest?
Winbigler felt that the action had
been "a protest against aspects of
Mr. Harris' conduct as ASSU Presi
dent and as a public representative of
the Stanford students and the Uni
versity."
Judicial Council added that "calling
it a prank does not make it a better
action, merely more thoughtless and
irrational."
Both Judicial Council and Winbig
ler judged the incident to be the
action of individuals and not of the
fraternity.
The Council found the students
guilty by a unanimous vote, but split
5-3 on the penalty.
Dissenting members of the council,

contacted last night, declined to give
paticulars of their dissent until they
had completed a final draft of it. A
University release, however, said that
"the minority felt some individuals
should receive stiffer penalties."
The two decisions, reached entirely
separately, agreed on the penalty, pro
bation for the academic year, and
differed only slightly on other terms.
Exercise Responsibility
Dean Winbigler said, "As a specific
condition of the probation, each . . .
is asked to submit ... in writing at
the end of his probation an account
of the means by which he has exer
cised his rights and responsibilities of
citizenship in the University commu
nity . . . including the means he has
used to bring his views to bear upor
any issues of concern to him within
the University."
Judicial Council's report stated, "In
order to fulfill our constructive, edu
cative function, written and oral dis
cussions with the members of coun
cil was made a term of probation."
Contacted last night, members of
the fraternity informed The Daily
that the house had decided that no
member should make any comment
to the press.
The students may appeal the de
cision to the five-member faculty In
terim Judicial Board, but no such
action was expected.
