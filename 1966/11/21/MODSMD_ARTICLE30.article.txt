## America's Task In Asia: Coexistence, Not Control 
### Walter Lippmanns 
As described by President
Johnson, this country is now
committed to enforcing peace in
Asia and to promoting a revo
lutionary improvement in the
standard of life on that conti
nent. This, we are told, is our
imperative duty; this is what
our vital interests demand.
If these pledges and promises,
this torrent of commitments and
threats were regarded here at
home or anywhere else as the
considered declaration of policy
of the responsible chief of a
great power, they would create
general consternation. For there
cannot be another case on rec
ord where so much has been
promised so lavishly to such a
heterogeneous mass of people.
Indifference and inattention at
home to the President's trip has
been matched abroad by almost
total disbelief in our present
conception of our role and mis
sion in Asia. If the President's
words were credible, he would
not have found himself meeting
in Manila with client Asian
states and only Australia and
New Zealand beside him to pro
vide a semblance of independent
allies. For in this new world
mission in which we are sup
posed to be leading mankind to
peace and prosperity there is not
a single independent state in
Europe or in Asia which follows
our lead.
Disavowed and Rejected
We say we are doing in Asia
what Europeans know was so
well done in Europe. Yet no
European government could sur
vive today if it joined us on the
battlefield. The mere insinuation
that the Wilson government,
which supports us "morally,"
might send a few soldiers to
Vietnam has had to be denied,
refuted, disavowed and rejected.
In the face of the record of
almost universal abstention, in
difference, avoidance and dis
sent, is there not reason to ask
whether there is not some fal
lacy in the official conception of
our role in Asia? I believe there
is.
The basic defect of the John
son policy is that it is out of
date and out of place. It as
sumes that all the world in the
1960s is like what Europe was
in the 19405. This is a radically
fallacious misreading of the
world as it has become since the
liquidation of the European em
pires and the emergence of the
Asia peoples.
Messianic Policy
The inwardness of our mes
sianic policy is the unavowed
(often formally disavowed) as
sumption that the old mission of

the Western white man, which
Europe can no longer afford to
carry on, has devolved upon us.
The official ideology of the ad
ministration is a hand-me-down
from the ideology of the two
world wars. I am well acquaint
ed with it, having lived with, be
lieved in it and worked for it.
The ideology was invented in
England immediately after the
shock and surprise of the Ger
man invasion of Belgium in
1914, and it was worked up into
the rationale to justify Ameri
can intervention in World War
I. I thought then, and I think
now, that the invention was
necessary and that the cause
was good.
But that does not alter the
historic fact that the ideology of
Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt
(though the latter was not whol
ly a true believer) was based on
what was then regarded as a
self-evident truth â€” that the
international order over which
Britain had presided in the 19th
century was necessary to civili
zation and that, therefore, with
some modifications it must be
perpetuated. The central pillar
of that international order was
the concert of the great powers
in Europe who governed the
globe.
Nucleus of Powers
The modification of this con
ception, which was introduced
in this century, was that Ameri
ca, grown from a provincial to
a great power, was to join the
nucleus of great powers who
presided over the destiny of all
the world.
In attempting to apply this
ideology of the world wars to
the Asia of the 19605, the Presi
dent and Secretary of State
Dean Rusk are involving the
United States in a mission which
cannot be fulfilled because it is
based on a pervasive fallacy.
They have not taken truly into
account the cataclysmic conse
quences of the collapse of the
empires and of the decoloniza
tion of the enormous masses of
the Asia continent.
We have, quite certainly, a
great historic mission to per
form in the Pacific and in Asia.
But it cannot be performed by
invading the continent of Asia,
and it is preposterous to think
that we can regulate and deter
mine the course of the revolu
tionary upheaval through which
the people of Asia are fated to
pass. Our task is to coexist
peaceably and helpfully with
them while they find their way.
But we can coexist only if we
forego the messianic megalo
mania which is the Manila mad
ness.
