# DETRIMENTAL PRECEDENTS
## IJB Delays Traister Sit-In Decision 
### 
Interim Judicial Board wound up
testimony in its review of the Alan
Traister case Thursday night, after
more than twoand-one-half hours of
hearings. No decision was reached.
The five-member board will meet
in closed session Tuesday to issue an
opinion.
At stake was Judicial Council's
right not to hear the Traister case.
According to Chairman Mimi Sher
man, the Council feels that violations
involving non-students are outside its
jurisdiction.
Precedents established by 6uch
cases might, Miss Sherman added, be
detrimental to Judicial Council's fu
ture effectiveness. She indicated that
IJB might remand the case to Judicial
Council.

IJB Chairman, 1 a w professor
Joseph T. Sneed, declined extensive
comment, saying only that the board
"will try to reach a decision that is
fair to all" and that "Alan Traister
will be at the heart of the matter."
Traister is one of two non-students
who participated in the 50-hour draft
examination protest held in the offices
of President J. E. Wallace Sterling
during Spring quarter.
Traister, a Master of Arts candi
date in Latin American Studies,
claimed at the Thursday hearing that
he and Marc Sapir, the other non
student sit-in, had asked Administra
tion officials that charges be brought
against them at the time the 34 other
demonstrators' cases were reviewed
by Judicial Council. Associate Dean

Joel Smith, acting as the University's
representative, declined to comment.
Last spring Judicial Council found
the demonstrators guilty of a Funda
mental Standard violation on the
grounds that they had failed to ex
haust possible channels of communi
cation with the University Adminis
tration. The Council recommended
probation for the demonstrators plus
mandatory participation in certain
seminars.
President Sterling rejected the lat
ter recommendation. Judicial Council
members in attendance at Thursday
night's hearing contended that in re
jecting the seminar recommendation,
President Sterling technically did not
approve the probation recommenda
tion.

Sitting on IJB are Lawrence Ryan,
professor of English; William R.
Rambo, Associate Dean of the School
of Electrical Engineering; Morris
Zelditch, Executive Head of the Soci
ology department; Robert A. Horn,
professor of Political Science; and
Sneed.
