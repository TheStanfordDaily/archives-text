### 
Yellow Springs, Ohio (AP)â€”Sparks
flew at Antioch College during a con
ference on draft reform yesterday
when the Adoption of several far
reaching proposals resulted in the
walkout of Yale and Lawrence Uni
versities.
Conference delegates, making it
clear they acted as individuals and
not as representatives of some 40 in
stitutions with which they are associ
ated as students, faculty and admin
istrators, adopted a report that called
for:

A draft only in time of national
peril.
Abolition of the present system of
selective service in favor of a lottery.
Abolition of the student deferment
classification and the class ranking on
which it can be based.
Expansion of the conscientious ob
jector category to include philoso
phical grounds for objection.
Alternative national service equiv
alent to military service when con
scription is invoked.
And, except in a state of declared
war, no conscriptee be forced to go
overseas.

The walkout occurred at mid-morn
ing when the proposal on conscien
tious objection was being debated.
Protesting delegates claimed that the
conferees did not want to reform the
selective service act but to destroy it.
At the close of the conference. Dr.
James P. Dixon, Antioch College
President and chairman of the final
plenary session, said the list of recom
mendations proved that "Persons with
strong anti-war feelings were able to
suspend those feelings and address
themselves to problems of military
manpower procurement."
