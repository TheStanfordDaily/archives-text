# Judiciary Limited By ‘Administrative Fiat’
## 
### GAIL ANDERSON Third in a Series 
"Students will exercise responsibility,"
opined Professor Morris Zelditch of the In
terim Judicial Board, "when they're given re
sponsibility to exercise."
"When student councils are dealing respon
sibly," stated Robert Hind, assistant dean
of Undergraduate Education, "there is a gen
uine willingness on the part of the administra
tion to leave matters in student hands."
But the inconsistency and confusion in the
present judicial system leads to the question:
is the administration really giving the students
responsibility?
Complex Answers
The answers to these problems are mag
nified in complexity by the fact that, as LASSU
Speaker Tom Forstenzer pointed out, "The
student judiciary is grafted onto a system of
non-student rules." This leads to the ques
tion: is the Judicial Council really what it pur
ports to be—student self-government?
Council member Joel Kugelmass pointed

out that "It doesn't mean a great deal to be
judged by your peers when your peers don't
set the rules."
The construction of the judicial system as
the executor of university policy, plus the
fact that all judicial decisions are subject to
administrative fiat, cast doubt on the validity
of the Council as a real means of student
government. When the administration has
the power to make rules, to determine to an
extent what cases are tried by the Council, and
to overturn Council decisions, it is no wonder
that the Council is frequently accused of being
a "front" for the Dean of Students' Office.
The structure of the system makes it obvious.
No Legal System
Although it seems an obvious contradic
tion, one real problem—according to some
people within the system—is a lack of any
legal system upon which to base judicial de
cisions. If it is true that the administration
has absolute power, as seems to be the case,
then this absence of law either does not mat
ter, since the Council has no power, or gives
students more free rein, since it leaves in

terpretation of the Fundamental Standard
up to them.
But it seems that all it really feads to is
confusion.
Cases before the Judicial Council may in
clude anything from a traffic violation to
theft or property damage to an Honor Code
violation to a psychotic or neurotic problem,
but all are tried as "violations of the Funda
mental Standard." Because the Fundamental
Standard is by nature subject to individual
interpretation, there is no consistent way in
which to respond to a situation. The Council
is a judicial, not a legal, body; on one hand
it is i-esponsible to university rules and
policy, but on the other hand it is responsible
for formulating its own interpretations of
the Fundamental Standard—a case once more
of the conflict between the student and ad
ministrative systems.
But even in this area there is no solidarity
of opinion.
Codification
Some Council members feel a codification of
the Fundamental Standard is necessary. It

would remove the possibility of irresponsible
interpretations by different Councils. It would
clarify the Council's position in relations with
administration and students by providing a
definition of its purpose that could be un
derstood by both. It would provide an area
in which student rule-making power, although
limited, would be real.
But others feel the entire purpose of the
Fundamental Standard would be negated by
any attempts to codify it. Council member
Fred Poorbaugh stated:
"The Fundamental Standard is a recogni
tion that as a thinking individual in the
university community each of us is respon
sible for developing his own moral codes. The
Fundamental Standard expresses concepts
with which a person must come to terms in
developing a moral code. Were it to be
codified and assume the form of a prohibitive
code, its value would be lost."
Prohibitive Code
"Yet a Judicial Council decision in essence
does just that—it reduces the Fundamental
Standard to a prohibitive code."

If this is so, then perhaps the whole idea
of the Council's basing its decisions on the
Fundamental Standard is wrong. The only
way, it seems ,to reconcile the two points of
view is to adapt the Council so that it en
forces a set of student-made rules separate
from the Fundamental Standard.
But even this would leave a defect in the
system as student self-government: the fact
that anything can happen to a Judicial Coun
cil decision. Ultimately the Council has no pow
er. Its only function is to "recommend" that
action be taken.
One member of the Council stated that "our
connection with the Dean's office (Dean of
Students) is unclear, but somehow he always
gets involved in our cases. The administration
keeps this relationship deliberately vague be
cause that decreases the Council's influence
and increases the administration's."
"These conflicts of judicial power are rep
resentative of more general conflicts in the
entire structure," he added. "The power strug
gle situation is so confused that no one can
get angry about it—just depressed"
