# Skill Needed To Use Libraries
## 
### BARB EHRLICH Second in a series 
Many student complaints of
the library's inefficiency and in
adequacy have resulted simply
from not knowing how to use
the library.
Rutherford D. Rogers, Direc
tor of the University Libraries,
stated in his report for 1965-66,
"A few members of the faculty
who are adept in using the li
braries have expressed the
opinion that Stanford's libraries
are much better than is gen
erally acknowledged.
"The truth is that many peo
ple are not sufficiently skilled to
find what is here."
A 196-1 Syracuse University
study on the ability of students
to use university libraries found
that "few students know how
to make good use of the library
resources available to them."
The study found that the vast
increase in published materials
Jn recent years—and the in
crease in the different types of
materials published—had made
it much more difficult for stu
dents to use the libraries.
At the same time, the report
found, the greater emphasis on
independent study and research
had made it much more neces
sary for students to use the li
brary.

M any students, however,
lacked basic skills such as knowl
edge of how to use a card
catalogue. Staff energy was
therefore used teaching rudi
ments to students rather than
aiding them in research.
"Coupled with the rise in stu
dent population, the inability of
students to use library resources
competently and on their own
is a complicating factor in a sit
uation that is already straining
library services and staff ener
gies," the report concluded.
The study recommended that
entering freshmen be taught, be
sides basic library skills such
things as the classification sys
tem used by the specific uni
versity, how to locate special
reference materials, the physi
cal lay-out of the library, and
where to go for help.
Much confusion resulted at
Stanford last year when the
freshmen tours of the library
were discontinued.
Which Library?
"They just assigned us papers
and expected us to be able to
figure out how to use the li
brary," commented one sopho
more. "I didn't even know which
library to go to."
Many students also did not un
derstand the multiple system of
classification used at Stanford.

The many services of the li
brary were not explained. Ref
erence materials were difficult to
find. Many students did not un
derstand the multiplicity of uni
versity libraries, and there were
too few reference librarians to
give adequate help.
New Library
The new Undergraduate Li
brary will greatly alleviate
most of these problems. It is
organized so that material will
be easy to find and help can be
readily obtained. Freshman tours
have also been reinstated this
year, including a tour of the
new library.
In general it will be much
easier to locate materials in the
Undergraduate Library than in
the Main Library. Encyclopedias,
indices, and other reference
materials will be grouped at the
entrance to each separate sub
ject pavilion and in a general
references area.
"In addition the library will
furnish four-page pamphlets list
ing important reference books
for the personal use of each
student," stated Warren B.
Kuhn, Librarian of the UGL.
A guide to the Undergraduate
Library, with floor plans, will
be available at all exits and at
the main entrance.
Much more individual help

from reference librarians will
be available to students. The un
dergraduate library employs six
reference librarians, each skilled
in a different subject area.
Phones will also be available in
each pavilion for students to
contact the librarians.
"People are often too reluc
tant to ask for help," said
Rodgers. "We want people to
ask for help."
However, any in-depth research
must still be done in the Main
Library or in one of the depart
mental libraries on campus.
A course in library science is
taught by Kuhn. However, stu
dents who only occasionally use
the Main Library, "tend to be
overwhelmed by a research li
brary," said Rogers.
Perhaps individual instructors
could arrange for students in
honors programs to have in
struction in the use of special li
brary materials in their field.
The library does publish
pamphlets explaining the Stan
ford Libraries. Many students,
however, are unfamiliar with
them. They could be compiled,
along with basic information
on the use of the library, into
one library handbook and dis
tributed in Freshman English
classes and throughout the uni
versity.

from not knowing how to use
the library.
Rutherford D. Rogers, Direc
tor of the University Libraries,
stated in his report for 1965-66,
"A few members of the faculty
who are adept in using the li
braries have expressed the
opinion that Stanford's libraries
are much better than is gen
erally acknowledged.
"The truth is that many peo
ple are not sufficiently skilled to
find what is here."
A 196-1 Syracuse University
study on the ability of students
to use university libraries found
that "few students know how
to make good use of the library
resources available to them."
The study found that the vast
increase in published materials
Jn recent years—and the in
crease in the different types of
materials published—had made
it much more difficult for stu
dents to use the libraries.
At the same time, the report
found, the greater emphasis on
independent study and research
had made it much more neces
sary for students to use the li
brary.

M any students, however,
lacked basic skills such as knowl
edge of how to use a card
catalogue. Staff energy was
therefore used teaching rudi
ments to students rather than
aiding them in research.
"Coupled with the rise in stu
dent population, the inability of
students to use library resources
competently and on their own
is a complicating factor in a sit
uation that is already straining
library services and staff ener
gies," the report concluded.
The study recommended that
entering freshmen be taught, be
sides basic library skills such
things as the classification sys
tem used by the specific uni
versity, how to locate special
reference materials, the physi
cal lay-out of the library, and
where to go for help.
Much confusion resulted at
Stanford last year when the
freshmen tours of the library
were discontinued.
Which Library?
"They just assigned us papers
and expected us to be able to
figure out how to use the li
brary," commented one sopho
more. "I didn't even know which
library to go to."
Many students also did not un
derstand the multiple system of
classification used at Stanford.

The many services of the li
brary were not explained. Ref
erence materials were difficult to
find. Many students did not un
derstand the multiplicity of uni
versity libraries, and there were
too few reference librarians to
give adequate help.
New Library
The new Undergraduate Li
brary will greatly alleviate
most of these problems. It is
organized so that material will
be easy to find and help can be
readily obtained. Freshman tours
have also been reinstated this
year, including a tour of the
new library.
In general it will be much
easier to locate materials in the
Undergraduate Library than in
the Main Library. Encyclopedias,
indices, and other reference
materials will be grouped at the
entrance to each separate sub
ject pavilion and in a general
references area.
"In addition the library will
furnish four-page pamphlets list
ing important reference books
for the personal use of each
student," stated Warren B.
Kuhn, Librarian of the UGL.
A guide to the Undergraduate
Library, with floor plans, will
be available at all exits and at
the main entrance.
Much more individual help

from reference librarians will
be available to students. The un
dergraduate library employs six
reference librarians, each skilled
in a different subject area.
Phones will also be available in
each pavilion for students to
contact the librarians.
"People are often too reluc
tant to ask for help," said
Rodgers. "We want people to
ask for help."
However, any in-depth research
must still be done in the Main
Library or in one of the depart
mental libraries on campus.
A course in library science is
taught by Kuhn. However, stu
dents who only occasionally use
the Main Library, "tend to be
overwhelmed by a research li
brary," said Rogers.
Perhaps individual instructors
could arrange for students in
honors programs to have in
struction in the use of special li
brary materials in their field.
The library does publish
pamphlets explaining the Stan
ford Libraries. Many students,
however, are unfamiliar with
them. They could be compiled,
along with basic information
on the use of the library, into
one library handbook and dis
tributed in Freshman English
classes and throughout the uni
versity.

stated in his report for 1965-66,
"A few members of the faculty
who are adept in using the li
braries have expressed the
opinion that Stanford's libraries
are much better than is gen
erally acknowledged.
"The truth is that many peo
ple are not sufficiently skilled to
find what is here."
A 196-1 Syracuse University
study on the ability of students
to use university libraries found
that "few students know how
to make good use of the library
resources available to them."
The study found that the vast
increase in published materials
Jn recent years—and the in
crease in the different types of
materials published—had made
it much more difficult for stu
dents to use the libraries.
At the same time, the report
found, the greater emphasis on
independent study and research
had made it much more neces
sary for students to use the li
brary.

M any students, however,
lacked basic skills such as knowl
edge of how to use a card
catalogue. Staff energy was
therefore used teaching rudi
ments to students rather than
aiding them in research.
"Coupled with the rise in stu
dent population, the inability of
students to use library resources
competently and on their own
is a complicating factor in a sit
uation that is already straining
library services and staff ener
gies," the report concluded.
The study recommended that
entering freshmen be taught, be
sides basic library skills such
things as the classification sys
tem used by the specific uni
versity, how to locate special
reference materials, the physi
cal lay-out of the library, and
where to go for help.
Much confusion resulted at
Stanford last year when the
freshmen tours of the library
were discontinued.
Which Library?
"They just assigned us papers
and expected us to be able to
figure out how to use the li
brary," commented one sopho
more. "I didn't even know which
library to go to."
Many students also did not un
derstand the multiple system of
classification used at Stanford.

The many services of the li
brary were not explained. Ref
erence materials were difficult to
find. Many students did not un
derstand the multiplicity of uni
versity libraries, and there were
too few reference librarians to
give adequate help.
New Library
The new Undergraduate Li
brary will greatly alleviate
most of these problems. It is
organized so that material will
be easy to find and help can be
readily obtained. Freshman tours
have also been reinstated this
year, including a tour of the
new library.
In general it will be much
easier to locate materials in the
Undergraduate Library than in
the Main Library. Encyclopedias,
indices, and other reference
materials will be grouped at the
entrance to each separate sub
ject pavilion and in a general
references area.
"In addition the library will
furnish four-page pamphlets list
ing important reference books
for the personal use of each
student," stated Warren B.
Kuhn, Librarian of the UGL.
A guide to the Undergraduate
Library, with floor plans, will
be available at all exits and at
the main entrance.
Much more individual help

from reference librarians will
be available to students. The un
dergraduate library employs six
reference librarians, each skilled
in a different subject area.
Phones will also be available in
each pavilion for students to
contact the librarians.
"People are often too reluc
tant to ask for help," said
Rodgers. "We want people to
ask for help."
However, any in-depth research
must still be done in the Main
Library or in one of the depart
mental libraries on campus.
A course in library science is
taught by Kuhn. However, stu
dents who only occasionally use
the Main Library, "tend to be
overwhelmed by a research li
brary," said Rogers.
Perhaps individual instructors
could arrange for students in
honors programs to have in
struction in the use of special li
brary materials in their field.
The library does publish
pamphlets explaining the Stan
ford Libraries. Many students,
however, are unfamiliar with
them. They could be compiled,
along with basic information
on the use of the library, into
one library handbook and dis
tributed in Freshman English
classes and throughout the uni
versity.
