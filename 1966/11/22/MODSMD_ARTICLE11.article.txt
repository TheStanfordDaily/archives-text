• Sex At Johns Hopkins
BALTIMORE, M.D. — Break
ing with traditional taboos, doc
tors at Johns Hopkins Hospital
are using surgical techniques to
change the sex of what they
term "transsexual" patients.
Dr. John E. Hoopes, Assistant
Professor of Plastic Surgery at
the hospital who heads the Gen
der Identity Clinic, said yester
day that it was only after much
study and soul-searching that a
full team was assembled and em
barked upon the project.

So far, the Hopkins team has
operated on two patients, both
men. The 3 1/2-hour surgical
procedure involves removing the
genital organs and creating a
vaginal passage. The technique
is coupled with hormone treat
ments which reduce the male

characteristics such as body
hair, and cause development of
breasts and wider hips.
• Jordan Blasts Israel
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. —
Jordan called on the Security
Council yesterday to apply eco

nomic penalties against Israel
for its November 13 attack on
Jordanian villages that killed
18 persons.
Jordanian Ambassador Mu
hammad H. El-Farra told the 15-
nation council it must clearly
condemn Israel for what he
called a flagrant violation of the
U.N. charter and armed ag
gression.
El-Farra told the council that
failure to condemn Israel "would
serve clear notice on the victims
of aggression that from now on
they are on their own."
