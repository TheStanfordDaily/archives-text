# USC Will Represent AAWU In The Rose Bowl Against Purdue
## 
### BOB THIERIOT 
The AAWU voters elected USC
as the most representative team
in the West Coast conference,
and gave them a berth in the
January Ist Rose Bowl game
against the Big Ten's Purdue, it
was announced yesterday in San
Francisco.
Other teams which had out
side chances were Oregon State
and UCLA. Although OSU had a

7-3 record they were beaten by
USC 21-0, and Michigan 41-0.
They did finish by winning six
in a row. UCLA has a better
overall record than USC— 9-1 to
7-2.
The Bruins also upset the Tro
jans last Saturday, despite the
loss of Gary Beban, who is pos
sibly the most outstanding play
er in college football. But the
Uclans went to the Rose Bowl

last year. USC did have a better
conference record than UCLA—
4-1 to 3-1.
The decision of the league
voters came as no surprise to
most fans, though many felt
that the bid should have gone
to UCLA, because they beat the
Trojans. UCLA beat Michigan
State in the Rose Bowl last
year 14-12, in one of the greatest
upsets in the Bowl's history.
Michigan State was the No. 1
team in the nation.
Both Oregon State and USC
have been to the bowl in recent
years. Purdue did not finish first
in the Big Ten. Michigan State,
which tied No. 1 Notre Dame
10-10 last Saturday, finished un
defeated, but is uneligible for
the post-season because the Big
Ten prohibits their teams from
going to the Rose Bowl in con
secutive years. Purdue finished
second; they were soundly
crushed by the Spartans 41-20.
