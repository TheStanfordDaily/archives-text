# League Leaders Primed
## Cards & Bears Split IM Games 
### 
Four more interleague games
will complete the first round of
the intramural football cham
pionships this afternoon. The
3:45 p.m. action will advance the
last of eight teams into next
week's quarter-finals.
Two unbeaten fraternity teams,
S.A.E. and Phi Kap, face chal
lenges from runners-up in fresh
man and grad leagues, while
Kappa Alpha, which won a coin
toss for the first place seed in its
league, takes on El Cuadro and
Beta Biz pits its offense against
an El Toro defense which has
met every test up to now.
Frat vs. Grads
S.A.E.-Blaokacre: Two teams
which came along fast in the last
weeks of the season match
firm defenses, with the guess
from here that the fraternity
squad will be able to come up
with the big play, the intercep
tion or the key completion, as it
has consistently done.
KA-Cuadro: El Cuadro has a
passing attack which can shake
up any defense, but it doesn't
seem likely they'll be able to

stay with the much-improved,
larger Kappa Alpha squad for
more than a half.
Phi Kap-Arroyo: Should be a
low-scoring affair, but the frosh
defense, good as it is ,is not
likely to hold off the persistent
Phi Kaps tho whole game, and
one touchdown could be enough.
Beta Biz-El Toro: Toro takes
pride in its defense, which has
yet to allow a touchdown. Beta
Biz seems a good bet to end that
record with its blitz-style of
fense, but Toro has some punch
of its own, as it has shown in
recent 19- and 31 -point victories.
Though it can't afford to get
careless, barring too many bad
breaks Toro should win.
Little Big Games
In a round of Intramural Big
Games, Stanford intramural
teams edged their opponents

from Cal. Last Friday's action
on Indian fields saw the Stan
ford representative teams from
the fraternity, Stern, eating club,
graduate, and freshman leagues
pitted against the corresponding
champs from Berkeley.
The Stanford teams had a 4-3-1
record. Among the winners was
Stern's Fremont which beat Grif
fith House 2G-7. Also maintaining
their unbeaten record were El
Toro which blanked Ridge
House, a Cal co-op, 31-0, and the
Dislocations who smashed
Bowles Hall, perennially one of
Cal's top teams, 57-0.
Oylotron Overpowers Linac
The Alpha Omegas, previous
ly Sigma Chi, defeated their
brothers from Cal 7-2; while the
physics team, the Neutrinos,
were defeated 26-0 by the Cal
Rad Lab's KXS.
