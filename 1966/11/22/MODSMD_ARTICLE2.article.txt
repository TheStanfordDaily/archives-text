# Professors Available For Special Seminars
## 
### BILL BLY 
A list of professors available for
Undergraduate Special seminars will
be posted tomorrow on the ASSU
bulletin board. All students who have
topics that particularly interest them
but which are not offered in the pres
ent curriculum are urged to contact
a professor listed in that field.
Senior Bob Fellmeth, of the ASSU
Education Commission said that any
g -oup of at least seven students can
propose a seminar topic. Upon ap
proval of the professor and Deans
Walker and Hind of the Undergrad
uate Seminar department, the semin
ar could be offered Winter quarter.
Professors to be listed cover every
imaginable field, "ranging from EE
to Speech and Drama," Fellmeth ex
plained. Any group of students can
organize a seminar, however Fell
meth stressed that living groups pro
vide an especially valuable source.
"Although subject to approval by
the Dean of Undergraduate Educa
tion, the courses are virtually unlim
ited as to subject matter, method of
research, class meetings, and grad
ing." Up to two units of credit are
available.
Replace SCs
Some of the professors to be listed
tomorrow are Hilgard, Taira,
Schrage, Anderson, Hastings, Dunn,
Levin, Sears, Solomon, Hanna and
Boeninger. At least nine or ten other
full professors will also be posted.
Their office and telephone numbers
will be listed, and students interested
in special seminars in upcoming quar
ters are urged to contact them.
Fellmeth, chairman of the senior
class committee for curriculum re
form, originally intended the Under
graduate Special seminars to replace
the Senior Colloquia requirement. He
explained that since the colloquia can
only be taken as a senior and are
restricted in subject matter, many
students are dissatisfied.
Instead he proposes that special
seminars may be taken during the
junior or senior year with the subject

matter up to the students themselves.
As yet the ASSU legislature has
taken no atcion on Fellmeth's pro
posals.
Express Purpose
Fellmeth obtained the list of in
terested professors last spring in a
poll of the faculty and student body.
He found that the majority of seniors
believed that their colloquia did not
satLsfy the expressed purpose of the
program, and that over ninety per
cent of the faculty endorsed his alter
nate program of special seminars.
Such a program insures only the
inclusion of those positively inter
ested in the course plan, and a stu
dent dent can take up to thirty sem
inar units without feeling "forced",
Fellmeth explained.

program, and that over ninety per
cent of the faculty endorsed his alter
nate program of special seminars.
Such a program insures only the
inclusion of those positively inter
ested in the course plan, and a stu
dent dent can take up to thirty sem
inar units without feeling "forced",
Fellmeth explained.
A list of professors available for
Undergraduate Special seminars will
be posted tomorrow on the ASSU
bulletin board. All students who have
topics that particularly interest them
but which are not offered in the pres
ent curriculum are urged to contact
a professor listed in that field.
Senior Bob Fellmeth, of the ASSU
Education Commission said that any
g -oup of at least seven students can
propose a seminar topic. Upon ap
proval of the professor and Deans
Walker and Hind of the Undergrad
uate Seminar department, the semin
ar could be offered Winter quarter.
Professors to be listed cover every
imaginable field, "ranging from EE
to Speech and Drama," Fellmeth ex
plained. Any group of students can
organize a seminar, however Fell
meth stressed that living groups pro
vide an especially valuable source.
"Although subject to approval by
the Dean of Undergraduate Educa
tion, the courses are virtually unlim
ited as to subject matter, method of
research, class meetings, and grad
ing." Up to two units of credit are
available.
Replace SCs
Some of the professors to be listed
tomorrow are Hilgard, Taira,
Schrage, Anderson, Hastings, Dunn,
Levin, Sears, Solomon, Hanna and
Boeninger. At least nine or ten other
full professors will also be posted.
Their office and telephone numbers
will be listed, and students interested
in special seminars in upcoming quar
ters are urged to contact them.
Fellmeth, chairman of the senior
class committee for curriculum re
form, originally intended the Under
graduate Special seminars to replace
the Senior Colloquia requirement. He
explained that since the colloquia can
only be taken as a senior and are
restricted in subject matter, many
students are dissatisfied.
Instead he proposes that special
seminars may be taken during the
junior or senior year with the subject

matter up to the students themselves.
As yet the ASSU legislature has
taken no atcion on Fellmeth's pro
posals.
Express Purpose
Fellmeth obtained the list of in
terested professors last spring in a
poll of the faculty and student body.
He found that the majority of seniors
believed that their colloquia did not
satLsfy the expressed purpose of the
program, and that over ninety per
cent of the faculty endorsed his alter
nate program of special seminars.
Such a program insures only the
inclusion of those positively inter
ested in the course plan, and a stu
dent dent can take up to thirty sem
inar units without feeling "forced",
