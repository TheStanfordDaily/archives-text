## New Congress Worries Labor 
### William F. Buckley, Jr 
The composition of the new
Congress having been lightly
conservatised, what can we now
expect? Big Labor, apparently,
is apprehensive. Mr. W. Don
Ellinger, political director for the
Internal Association of Machin
ists, has called the election "a
catastrophe." It is worth paus
ing to inquire why Big Labor
was so disappointed, and wheth
er its disappointment is a so
cial misfortune — or maybe a
blessing.
Big Labor suffered the loss of
approximately 40 obedient con
gressmen. I capitalize the Labor
because it is important to dis
tinguish between the two—the
interests of organized Big Labor,
and the interests of labor, which
are frequently at odds.
In the last analysis, what is
good for American labor is good
for the country, which however
does not mean that what is good
for the monopoly labor unions
is good for the country. The
hold Big Labor exercises over
its constituency rests on the false
assumption that the big monop
oly labor unions are friends of
the working man.

Big Labor endeavored, during
the last session of a Congress it
all but controlled, to repeal Sec
tion 14(b) of the Taft-Hartley
Law which concedes the right
of the individual states to permit
an individual laborer to join or
not join a labor union, without
prejudice to his right to earn
a living. Big Labor was also
concerned to establish federal,
as distinct from state, standards
of unemployment benefits—yet
another move to centralize the
economic function and deny the
states the power to establish
comparative economic advan
tages sufficient to encourage the
kind of mobility that prevents
stagnation.
And Big Labor has chafed at
existing legislation having to do
with the limited rights of labor
unions to picket construction
sites, the intent of which is to
prevent a single labor union
from automatically paralyzing
construction by the device of
setting up a picket.
Labor's fear is that the new
Congress will, as a couple of
others since the War have done,
look the labor problem square in

the face. If Congres did so, and
if its intellectual and moral
facilities were in good order, it
would pass legislation of a kind
that would deprive key labor
unions of the power to tie up
whole cities, let alone whole in
dustries—let alone the entire
nation.
It is estimated by Labor head
counters that only 200 of the 435
members of the House of Repre
sentatives that will be sworn in
next January can absolutely be
counted on to scratch them
selves when Walter Reuther
itches, and the prospect of a
Congress so incompletely con
trolled is more than the Labor
bosses can bear.
Unfortunately, their fears are
probably groundless. Whereas it
is now predictable that the new
Congress will not pass any leg
islation expanding Big Labor's
powers over the economy and
free men, it is by no means pre
dictable that the new Congress
will pass a new Taft-Hartley or
Landrum-GrifFin law designed
to diminish the power of the new
monopolists over their fellow
men.

The elections of 1968 are not
far away, and anyway the man
date of 1966 is not by any means
clear on the subject of labor
abuses. The Congress-elect did
not go to the polls pledged to
reform the labor laws. A pity,
since they so greatly need re
forming. And for the good of
labor, even as it was for the
good of management that Big
Management was contained by
a series of reforms passed by
Congress over the turn of the
century.
Senator Robert Taft is dead
—very very dead, one needs
painfully to remind oneself,
when asking who among the
major figures in the Republican
Party will exercise the leader
ship to say what so much needs
saying, namely, that a free and
robust society cannot indulge—
at the expense of the poor work
er, the worker who needs a job,
who needs an opportunity — a
system which guarantees mo
nopoly leverage to the few. What
Labor has to fear is a courage
ous Republican voice of great in
fluence, which is to say that it
has very little to fear.
