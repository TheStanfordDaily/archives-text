# Letters To The Editor
## Double Downpour: Rain And Spirit 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Congratulations. Last Friday's
Dnily was unsurpassed in spirit
building for Stanford's last and
greatest game of the season. Un
fortunately, though, the editorial
page displayed a somewhat un
timely lament on the "dual cul
ture" described in Mr. Couzens'
oversimplified analogy with the
boy and lyre cultures.
I for one, however, see no
such dichotomy of cultures nec
essarily existing at Stanford.
Any real sense of community to
be achieved here must have its
foundation in a unifying school
spirit—and I don't mean a rah
rah football spirit as opposed to
an academic or intellectual one.
My point is that these aren't
two separate, opposing cultures,
but one single spirit that has
as its essence a deep pride in
one's school, along with an un
derlying attitude that extols
excellence in any field.
Sure, there are legitimate crit
icism to be made of big-time
athletics, and we all hope they
will lead to constructive, sensi
ble change where change is
needed. But meanwhile our ath
letic teams, however "profes
sional" they may be, deserve
our support and pride as much
as any other aspect of Stan
ford. We've done a lot to elimi
nate the image of the stud
farm and the "Stanford snob,"
but it seems we've gotten car
ried away and ended up at the
other extreme, displaying a
widespread lack of pride in our
school. A critical, inquiring atti
tude is wonderful, but if it de
stroys every bit of pride in an
institution, it is killing the
school spirit that is the life
blood of a university commu
nitv.

I may be an idealist or an
optimist, but I think of the
"general yahooism" Friday night
and again during the downpour
in Berkeley Saturday, not as
pure chauvinism or anything
else directed specifically at the
New Left's world view, but
rather as a fantastic display of
students' pride and support. For
me, Mr. Couzens, Big Game is
not pretense. It is one, very im
portant outward manifestation
of a great school spirit.

The most famous 'BEAT CAL'
banner . . .
To me 1959 does not seem too
long ago, but it seems your
records are clouded when you
give credit to the wrong group
of students in the hanging of the
Cal Campanile banner. To
my way of thinking, this group
is second to the "Immortal 21,"
and I hate to see them ignored.
By group designation, you
must credit this even to the then
vital RALLY COMM, with
sprinklings of Beta's and D.U.'s.
Three people of significant note
were the plans organizer (Rich
Garlinghouse), the gal who as
sumed a temporary pregnant
look to get the banner up into
the tower (Lynn Chatterton) and
a Stanford graduate attending
Cal law school who acquired
necessary student body cards
(Jim Herbert). Also, the plan
could not have been carried out
without dozens more helping.

• Primitive?
Editor, The Daily:
I think the members of Aus
tria I and Austria II owe Pro

fessor Spitz a vote of thanks
for supporting us in our
claims that Semmering is not
the place for the Austrian Cam
pus. However I feel his choice
of the word "primitive" to de
scribe Semmering gets to the
root of the problem that has
faced the students in both
groups I and 11. They found
something in Semmering that
they could not come to grips
with, something that ran against
their good old American grain.
For a lack of a better word
they labeled it primitive, at least
subconsciously. I contend that
this is not something peculiar
to Semmering but a basic part
of the Austrian character and
must be accepted as such.
One does not feel this as
strongly in Vienna due to its cos
mopolitan nature, but after
spending a number of weeks
there, begin to feel this some
thing. However, you wouldn't
think of calling a great cultural
center such as Vienna primitive.
Just what is this something? It
is that conservatism, almost to
the point of being reactionary,
is very deeply rooted in
the Habsburg tradition. It is
something that will be found
everywhere you go in Austria
and it is that which makes
Austrians different from Ameri
cans. It cannot be escaped by
running to Vienna, although
Vienna has much more to offer
in the way of cultural events.
It is this basic failure to rec
ognize Austrians as Austrians
and not Americans, or Germans
for that matter, that has caused
much of this discontent in Sem
mering. There is really no pur
pose in travelling six thousand
miles to meet people who think
and live much the same as you
do. The Austrians are a wonder
fully hospitable people and there
is a great deal to be learned
from getting to know them.
However, you will never see this
until you can step outside of
yourself once in a while and
accept the Austrian culture, tra
ditionalism and all.

Editor, The Dally:
It appears Dr. Good has miss
ed the point of Mr. Vidal's cri
ticism of tenure by publication.
Mr. Vidal does not suggest that
there is not a place for Platos
in the university, rather that

Stanford is rejecting the Socra
tes. It might be added that in
this day of gushing publication
from the bowels of the univer
sity, a few more good teachers
would provide the students with
a more balanced diet.
Dr. Good, would Christ de

TOM FERGODA
• Student Failure
Editor, The Daily:
The return of Austria II to
the home campus has been ac
complished by a certain amount
of publicized criticism concerning
the entire overseas program.
That the Overseas Campuses
are not perfect is news to no
one. There exist and most likely
will always exist certain inher
ent problems in such a program
—indeed, as in all educational
systems. No one says that living
at an Overseas Campus is
Utopian.
Given these basic facts of
overseas life and the objectives
of the program, what was so
unique about Austria II?
To the many reasons of mis
understanding already cited, I
would like to add another vari
able which has been denied by
others: the students themselves.
Instead of trying to work with
and around the basic problems
which confronted them, some
students in Austria II not only
accentuated (exacerbated) these
problems, but also created new
antagonisms. Instead of trying
to alleviate these problems by
initiating new programs, stu
dents repeatedly criticized and
emphasized the unpleasant side
of life in the Hotel Panhans.
They objected to certain rules
and policies which could not be
(and hence were not) immed
iately remedied—if they could
be remedied at all. I certainly
would not blame the Director of
Stanford in Austria for the an
tagonisms resulting from these
complaints.
In addition to the failure of
many to balance or at least at
tempt to balance the disadvan
tages of life at an Overseas
Campus, there were those who
made no attempt to make con
tact, not only with the people
of Semmering, but even with
others in the group. I am not
referring to students who are
not interested in such contacts,
rather to those who said they
were and yet did nothing to
achieve them. These students
were usually some of the most
vocal complainers on this sub
ject.
Briefly then the main cause
of the troubles in Austria II
can be traced to the manner in
which this group reacted with
out understanding or coopera
tion to all of the aforesaid real
ities of the situation. What Aus
tria II lacked was sense of re
sponsibility and above all ma
turity. RENEE MOSS

• Roving Prof
Editor, The Daily:
I agree with Mr. Vidal!
The solution to the publish
or parish dilemma is to require
non-publishing professors to use
their "publishing" time in rov
ing the campus, sitting here by
a tree and there by a fountain,
rambling on to enraptured stu
dents whose awestruck "yes's"
and "no's" would punctuate the
steady flow of knowledge.

• Kal Lost
Editor, The Daily:
I joined the Stanford Band
this year with no better reason
in mind than to get out the
neglected clarinet, oil it up, and
doodle around a bit to see what
notes I could still reach. Slightly
shocked by the great number
of hours per week the Band
would take out of my schedule, I
beleived that it could never be
worth it. Now that the season
is over, I see that nothing could
have been more worthwhile.
The Band has had an "unblem
ished" season, scoring successes
against such top-rated bands as
UCLA's and such not-so-impres
sive bands as "Kal's." But what
made this Band so great was not
the fact that it was made up of
100-odd super-musicians, be
cause it wasn't. The sensitive
tone qualities which make a
quality orchestra count zero in
the marching band — musical
blasts from blown-out guts
count everything, and the latter
is what you've been hearing out
there. Combine that with the
competitive spirit and you have
a winner. But the Band's spirit
had a way of spreading out over
the school. Unlike many others,
this Band wasn't an added-on
optional extra, but an integral
part of the overall school spirit.
The Big Game culminated
many weeks of hard work and
particularly two days of lost
sleep. And what a payoff! With
the keyed-up spectators, the
spirited Soto-men, the quick-wit
ted cheerleaders, the red-hot
Dollies, and the super-bltchln'
Stanford band right there when
the mighty Stanford football
team set the new 6-game-win
ning-streak record, everyone
knew the Cal bear had bit hard.

UCLA's and such not-so-impres
sive bands as "Kal's." But what
made this Band so great was not
the fact that it was made up of
100-odd super-musicians, be
cause it wasn't. The sensitive
tone qualities which make a
quality orchestra count zero in
the marching band — musical
blasts from blown-out guts
count everything, and the latter
is what you've been hearing out
there. Combine that with the
competitive spirit and you have
a winner. But the Band's spirit
had a way of spreading out over
the school. Unlike many others,
this Band wasn't an added-on
optional extra, but an integral
part of the overall school spirit.
The Big Game culminated
many weeks of hard work and
particularly two days of lost
sleep. And what a payoff! With
the keyed-up spectators, the
spirited Soto-men, the quick-wit
ted cheerleaders, the red-hot
Dollies, and the super-bltchln'
Stanford band right there when
the mighty Stanford football
team set the new 6-game-win
ning-streak record, everyone
knew the Cal bear had bit hard.

Editor, The Daily:
Congratulations. Last Friday's
Dnily was unsurpassed in spirit
building for Stanford's last and
greatest game of the season. Un
fortunately, though, the editorial
page displayed a somewhat un
timely lament on the "dual cul
ture" described in Mr. Couzens'
oversimplified analogy with the
boy and lyre cultures.
I for one, however, see no
such dichotomy of cultures nec
essarily existing at Stanford.
Any real sense of community to
be achieved here must have its
foundation in a unifying school
spirit—and I don't mean a rah
rah football spirit as opposed to
an academic or intellectual one.
My point is that these aren't
two separate, opposing cultures,
but one single spirit that has
as its essence a deep pride in
one's school, along with an un
derlying attitude that extols
excellence in any field.
Sure, there are legitimate crit
icism to be made of big-time
athletics, and we all hope they
will lead to constructive, sensi
ble change where change is
needed. But meanwhile our ath
letic teams, however "profes
sional" they may be, deserve
our support and pride as much
as any other aspect of Stan
ford. We've done a lot to elimi
nate the image of the stud
farm and the "Stanford snob,"
but it seems we've gotten car
ried away and ended up at the
other extreme, displaying a
widespread lack of pride in our
school. A critical, inquiring atti
tude is wonderful, but if it de
stroys every bit of pride in an
institution, it is killing the
school spirit that is the life
blood of a university commu
nitv.

I may be an idealist or an
optimist, but I think of the
"general yahooism" Friday night
and again during the downpour
in Berkeley Saturday, not as
pure chauvinism or anything
else directed specifically at the
New Left's world view, but
rather as a fantastic display of
students' pride and support. For
me, Mr. Couzens, Big Game is
not pretense. It is one, very im
portant outward manifestation
of a great school spirit.

The most famous 'BEAT CAL'
banner . . .
To me 1959 does not seem too
long ago, but it seems your
records are clouded when you
give credit to the wrong group
of students in the hanging of the
Cal Campanile banner. To
my way of thinking, this group
is second to the "Immortal 21,"
and I hate to see them ignored.
By group designation, you
must credit this even to the then
vital RALLY COMM, with
sprinklings of Beta's and D.U.'s.
Three people of significant note
were the plans organizer (Rich
Garlinghouse), the gal who as
sumed a temporary pregnant
look to get the banner up into
the tower (Lynn Chatterton) and
a Stanford graduate attending
Cal law school who acquired
necessary student body cards
(Jim Herbert). Also, the plan
could not have been carried out
without dozens more helping.

Editor, The Daily:
I think the members of Aus
tria I and Austria II owe Pro

fessor Spitz a vote of thanks
for supporting us in our
claims that Semmering is not
the place for the Austrian Cam
pus. However I feel his choice
of the word "primitive" to de
scribe Semmering gets to the
root of the problem that has
faced the students in both
groups I and 11. They found
something in Semmering that
they could not come to grips
with, something that ran against
their good old American grain.
For a lack of a better word
they labeled it primitive, at least
subconsciously. I contend that
this is not something peculiar
to Semmering but a basic part
of the Austrian character and
must be accepted as such.
One does not feel this as
strongly in Vienna due to its cos
mopolitan nature, but after
spending a number of weeks
there, begin to feel this some
thing. However, you wouldn't
think of calling a great cultural
center such as Vienna primitive.
Just what is this something? It
is that conservatism, almost to
the point of being reactionary,
is very deeply rooted in
the Habsburg tradition. It is
something that will be found
everywhere you go in Austria
and it is that which makes
Austrians different from Ameri
cans. It cannot be escaped by
running to Vienna, although
Vienna has much more to offer
in the way of cultural events.
It is this basic failure to rec
ognize Austrians as Austrians
and not Americans, or Germans
for that matter, that has caused
much of this discontent in Sem
mering. There is really no pur
pose in travelling six thousand
miles to meet people who think
and live much the same as you
do. The Austrians are a wonder
fully hospitable people and there
is a great deal to be learned
from getting to know them.
However, you will never see this
until you can step outside of
yourself once in a while and
accept the Austrian culture, tra

TOM FERGODA
• Student Failure
Editor, The Daily:
The return of Austria II to
the home campus has been ac
complished by a certain amount
of publicized criticism concerning
the entire overseas program.
That the Overseas Campuses
are not perfect is news to no
one. There exist and most likely
will always exist certain inher
ent problems in such a program
—indeed, as in all educational
systems. No one says that living
at an Overseas Campus is
Utopian.
Given these basic facts of
overseas life and the objectives
of the program, what was so
unique about Austria II?
To the many reasons of mis
understanding already cited, I
would like to add another vari
able which has been denied by
others: the students themselves.
Instead of trying to work with
and around the basic problems
which confronted them, some
students in Austria II not only
accentuated (exacerbated) these
problems, but also created new
antagonisms. Instead of trying
to alleviate these problems by
initiating new programs, stu
dents repeatedly criticized and
emphasized the unpleasant side
of life in the Hotel Panhans.
They objected to certain rules
and policies which could not be
(and hence were not) immed
iately remedied—if they could
be remedied at all. I certainly
would not blame the Director of
Stanford in Austria for the an
tagonisms resulting from these
complaints.
In addition to the failure of
many to balance or at least at
tempt to balance the disadvan
tages of life at an Overseas
Campus, there were those who
made no attempt to make con
tact, not only with the people
of Semmering, but even with
others in the group. I am not
referring to students who are
not interested in such contacts,
rather to those who said they
were and yet did nothing to
achieve them. These students
were usually some of the most
vocal complainers on this sub
ject.
Briefly then the main cause
of the troubles in Austria II
can be traced to the manner in
which this group reacted with
out understanding or coopera
tion to all of the aforesaid real
ities of the situation. What Aus
tria II lacked was sense of re
sponsibility and above all ma
turity. RENEE MOSS

• Kal Lost
Editor, The Daily:
I joined the Stanford Band
this year with no better reason
in mind than to get out the
neglected clarinet, oil it up, and
doodle around a bit to see what
notes I could still reach. Slightly
shocked by the great number
of hours per week the Band
would take out of my schedule, I
beleived that it could never be
worth it. Now that the season
is over, I see that nothing could
have been more worthwhile.
The Band has had an "unblem

against such top-rated bands as

I joined the Stanford Band
this year with no better reason
in mind than to get out the
neglected clarinet, oil it up, and
doodle around a bit to see what
notes I could still reach. Slightly
shocked by the great number
of hours per week the Band
would take out of my schedule, I
beleived that it could never be
worth it. Now that the season
is over, I see that nothing could
have been more worthwhile.
The Band has had an "unblem
ished" season, scoring successes
against such top-rated bands as
UCLA's and such not-so-impres
sive bands as "Kal's." But what
made this Band so great was not
the fact that it was made up of
100-odd super-musicians, be
cause it wasn't. The sensitive
tone qualities which make a
quality orchestra count zero in
the marching band — musical
blasts from blown-out guts
count everything, and the latter
is what you've been hearing out
there. Combine that with the
competitive spirit and you have
a winner. But the Band's spirit
had a way of spreading out over
the school. Unlike many others,
this Band wasn't an added-on
optional extra, but an integral
part of the overall school spirit.
The Big Game culminated
many weeks of hard work and
particularly two days of lost
sleep. And what a payoff! With
the keyed-up spectators, the
spirited Soto-men, the quick-wit
ted cheerleaders, the red-hot
Dollies, and the super-bltchln'
Stanford band right there when
the mighty Stanford football
team set the new 6-game-win
ning-streak record, everyone
knew the Cal bear had bit hard.

Editor, The Daily:
Congratulations. Last Friday's
Dnily was unsurpassed in spirit
building for Stanford's last and
greatest game of the season. Un
fortunately, though, the editorial
page displayed a somewhat un
timely lament on the "dual cul
ture" described in Mr. Couzens'
oversimplified analogy with the
boy and lyre cultures.
I for one, however, see no
such dichotomy of cultures nec
essarily existing at Stanford.
Any real sense of community to
be achieved here must have its
foundation in a unifying school
spirit—and I don't mean a rah
rah football spirit as opposed to
an academic or intellectual one.
My point is that these aren't
two separate, opposing cultures,
but one single spirit that has
as its essence a deep pride in
one's school, along with an un
derlying attitude that extols
excellence in any field.
Sure, there are legitimate crit
icism to be made of big-time
athletics, and we all hope they
will lead to constructive, sensi
ble change where change is
needed. But meanwhile our ath
letic teams, however "profes
sional" they may be, deserve
our support and pride as much
as any other aspect of Stan
ford. We've done a lot to elimi
nate the image of the stud
farm and the "Stanford snob,"
but it seems we've gotten car
ried away and ended up at the
other extreme, displaying a
widespread lack of pride in our
school. A critical, inquiring atti
tude is wonderful, but if it de
stroys every bit of pride in an
institution, it is killing the
school spirit that is the life
blood of a university commu
nitv.

I may be an idealist or an
optimist, but I think of the
"general yahooism" Friday night
and again during the downpour
in Berkeley Saturday, not as
pure chauvinism or anything
else directed specifically at the
New Left's world view, but
rather as a fantastic display of
students' pride and support. For
me, Mr. Couzens, Big Game is
not pretense. It is one, very im
portant outward manifestation
of a great school spirit.

The most famous 'BEAT CAL'
banner . . .
To me 1959 does not seem too
long ago, but it seems your
records are clouded when you
give credit to the wrong group
of students in the hanging of the
Cal Campanile banner. To
my way of thinking, this group
is second to the "Immortal 21,"
and I hate to see them ignored.
By group designation, you
must credit this even to the then
vital RALLY COMM, with
sprinklings of Beta's and D.U.'s.
Three people of significant note
were the plans organizer (Rich
Garlinghouse), the gal who as
sumed a temporary pregnant
look to get the banner up into
the tower (Lynn Chatterton) and
a Stanford graduate attending
Cal law school who acquired
necessary student body cards
(Jim Herbert). Also, the plan
could not have been carried out
without dozens more helping.

Editor, The Daily:
I think the members of Aus
tria I and Austria II owe Pro

fessor Spitz a vote of thanks
for supporting us in our
claims that Semmering is not
the place for the Austrian Cam
pus. However I feel his choice
of the word "primitive" to de
scribe Semmering gets to the
root of the problem that has
faced the students in both
groups I and 11. They found
something in Semmering that
they could not come to grips
with, something that ran against
their good old American grain.
For a lack of a better word
they labeled it primitive, at least
subconsciously. I contend that
this is not something peculiar
to Semmering but a basic part
of the Austrian character and
must be accepted as such.
One does not feel this as
strongly in Vienna due to its cos
mopolitan nature, but after
spending a number of weeks
there, begin to feel this some
thing. However, you wouldn't
think of calling a great cultural
center such as Vienna primitive.
Just what is this something? It
is that conservatism, almost to
the point of being reactionary,
is very deeply rooted in
the Habsburg tradition. It is
something that will be found
everywhere you go in Austria
and it is that which makes
Austrians different from Ameri
cans. It cannot be escaped by
running to Vienna, although
Vienna has much more to offer
in the way of cultural events.
It is this basic failure to rec
ognize Austrians as Austrians
and not Americans, or Germans
for that matter, that has caused
much of this discontent in Sem
mering. There is really no pur
pose in travelling six thousand
miles to meet people who think
and live much the same as you
do. The Austrians are a wonder
fully hospitable people and there
is a great deal to be learned
from getting to know them.
However, you will never see this
until you can step outside of
yourself once in a while and
accept the Austrian culture, tra

TOM FERGODA
• Student Failure
Editor, The Daily:
The return of Austria II to
the home campus has been ac
complished by a certain amount
of publicized criticism concerning
the entire overseas program.
That the Overseas Campuses
are not perfect is news to no
one. There exist and most likely
will always exist certain inher
ent problems in such a program
—indeed, as in all educational
systems. No one says that living
at an Overseas Campus is
Utopian.
Given these basic facts of
overseas life and the objectives
of the program, what was so
unique about Austria II?
To the many reasons of mis
understanding already cited, I
would like to add another vari
able which has been denied by
others: the students themselves.
Instead of trying to work with
and around the basic problems
which confronted them, some
students in Austria II not only
accentuated (exacerbated) these
problems, but also created new
antagonisms. Instead of trying
to alleviate these problems by
initiating new programs, stu
dents repeatedly criticized and
emphasized the unpleasant side
of life in the Hotel Panhans.
They objected to certain rules
and policies which could not be
(and hence were not) immed
iately remedied—if they could
be remedied at all. I certainly
would not blame the Director of
Stanford in Austria for the an
tagonisms resulting from these
complaints.
In addition to the failure of
many to balance or at least at
tempt to balance the disadvan
tages of life at an Overseas
Campus, there were those who
made no attempt to make con
tact, not only with the people
of Semmering, but even with
others in the group. I am not
referring to students who are
not interested in such contacts,
rather to those who said they
were and yet did nothing to
achieve them. These students

• Student Failure
Editor, The Daily:
The return of Austria II to
the home campus has been ac
complished by a certain amount
of publicized criticism concerning
the entire overseas program.
That the Overseas Campuses
are not perfect is news to no
one. There exist and most likely
will always exist certain inher
ent problems in such a program
—indeed, as in all educational
systems. No one says that living
at an Overseas Campus is
Utopian.
Given these basic facts of
overseas life and the objectives
of the program, what was so
unique about Austria II?
To the many reasons of mis
understanding already cited, I
would like to add another vari
able which has been denied by
others: the students themselves.
Instead of trying to work with
and around the basic problems
which confronted them, some
students in Austria II not only
accentuated (exacerbated) these
problems, but also created new
antagonisms. Instead of trying
to alleviate these problems by
initiating new programs, stu
dents repeatedly criticized and
emphasized the unpleasant side
of life in the Hotel Panhans.
They objected to certain rules
and policies which could not be
(and hence were not) immed
iately remedied—if they could
be remedied at all. I certainly
would not blame the Director of
Stanford in Austria for the an
tagonisms resulting from these
complaints.
In addition to the failure of
many to balance or at least at
tempt to balance the disadvan
tages of life at an Overseas
Campus, there were those who
made no attempt to make con
tact, not only with the people
of Semmering, but even with
others in the group. I am not
referring to students who are
not interested in such contacts,
rather to those who said they
were and yet did nothing to
achieve them. These students
were usually some of the most
vocal complainers on this sub
ject.
Briefly then the main cause
of the troubles in Austria II
can be traced to the manner in
which this group reacted with
out understanding or coopera
tion to all of the aforesaid real
ities of the situation. What Aus
tria II lacked was sense of re
sponsibility and above all ma
turity. RENEE MOSS

The solution to the publish

non-publishing professors to use
their "publishing" time in rov

I joined the Stanford Band
this year with no better reason
in mind than to get out the
neglected clarinet, oil it up, and
doodle around a bit to see what
notes I could still reach. Slightly
shocked by the great number
of hours per week the Band
would take out of my schedule, I
beleived that it could never be
worth it. Now that the season
is over, I see that nothing could
have been more worthwhile.
The Band has had an "unblem
ished" season, scoring successes
against such top-rated bands as
UCLA's and such not-so-impres
sive bands as "Kal's." But what
made this Band so great was not
the fact that it was made up of
100-odd super-musicians, be
cause it wasn't. The sensitive
tone qualities which make a
quality orchestra count zero in
the marching band — musical
blasts from blown-out guts
count everything, and the latter
is what you've been hearing out
there. Combine that with the
competitive spirit and you have
a winner. But the Band's spirit
had a way of spreading out over
the school. Unlike many others,
this Band wasn't an added-on
optional extra, but an integral
part of the overall school spirit.
The Big Game culminated
many weeks of hard work and
particularly two days of lost
sleep. And what a payoff! With
the keyed-up spectators, the
spirited Soto-men, the quick-wit
ted cheerleaders, the red-hot
Dollies, and the super-bltchln'
Stanford band right there when
the mighty Stanford football
team set the new 6-game-win
ning-streak record, everyone
knew the Cal bear had bit hard.

Editor, The Daily:
Congratulations. Last Friday's
Dnily was unsurpassed in spirit
building for Stanford's last and
greatest game of the season. Un
fortunately, though, the editorial
page displayed a somewhat un
timely lament on the "dual cul
ture" described in Mr. Couzens'
oversimplified analogy with the
boy and lyre cultures.
I for one, however, see no
such dichotomy of cultures nec
essarily existing at Stanford.
Any real sense of community to
be achieved here must have its
foundation in a unifying school
spirit—and I don't mean a rah
rah football spirit as opposed to
an academic or intellectual one.
My point is that these aren't
two separate, opposing cultures,
but one single spirit that has
as its essence a deep pride in
one's school, along with an un
derlying attitude that extols
excellence in any field.
Sure, there are legitimate crit
icism to be made of big-time
athletics, and we all hope they
will lead to constructive, sensi
ble change where change is
needed. But meanwhile our ath
letic teams, however "profes
sional" they may be, deserve
our support and pride as much
as any other aspect of Stan
ford. We've done a lot to elimi
nate the image of the stud
farm and the "Stanford snob,"
but it seems we've gotten car
ried away and ended up at the
other extreme, displaying a
widespread lack of pride in our
school. A critical, inquiring atti
tude is wonderful, but if it de
stroys every bit of pride in an
institution, it is killing the
school spirit that is the life
blood of a university commu
nitv.

I may be an idealist or an
optimist, but I think of the
"general yahooism" Friday night
and again during the downpour
in Berkeley Saturday, not as
pure chauvinism or anything
else directed specifically at the
New Left's world view, but
rather as a fantastic display of
students' pride and support. For
me, Mr. Couzens, Big Game is
not pretense. It is one, very im
portant outward manifestation
of a great school spirit.

The most famous 'BEAT CAL'
banner . . .
To me 1959 does not seem too
long ago, but it seems your
records are clouded when you
give credit to the wrong group
of students in the hanging of the
Cal Campanile banner. To
my way of thinking, this group
is second to the "Immortal 21,"
and I hate to see them ignored.
By group designation, you
must credit this even to the then
vital RALLY COMM, with
sprinklings of Beta's and D.U.'s.
Three people of significant note
were the plans organizer (Rich
Garlinghouse), the gal who as
sumed a temporary pregnant
look to get the banner up into
the tower (Lynn Chatterton) and
a Stanford graduate attending
Cal law school who acquired
necessary student body cards
(Jim Herbert). Also, the plan
could not have been carried out
without dozens more helping.

Editor, The Daily:
I think the members of Aus
tria I and Austria II owe Pro

fessor Spitz a vote of thanks
for supporting us in our
claims that Semmering is not
the place for the Austrian Cam
pus. However I feel his choice
of the word "primitive" to de
scribe Semmering gets to the
root of the problem that has
faced the students in both
groups I and 11. They found
something in Semmering that
they could not come to grips
with, something that ran against
their good old American grain.
For a lack of a better word
they labeled it primitive, at least
subconsciously. I contend that
this is not something peculiar
to Semmering but a basic part
of the Austrian character and
must be accepted as such.
One does not feel this as
strongly in Vienna due to its cos
mopolitan nature, but after
spending a number of weeks
there, begin to feel this some
thing. However, you wouldn't
think of calling a great cultural
center such as Vienna primitive.
Just what is this something? It
is that conservatism, almost to
the point of being reactionary,
is very deeply rooted in
the Habsburg tradition. It is
something that will be found
everywhere you go in Austria
and it is that which makes
Austrians different from Ameri
cans. It cannot be escaped by
running to Vienna, although
Vienna has much more to offer
in the way of cultural events.
It is this basic failure to rec
ognize Austrians as Austrians
and not Americans, or Germans
for that matter, that has caused
much of this discontent in Sem
mering. There is really no pur
pose in travelling six thousand
miles to meet people who think
and live much the same as you
do. The Austrians are a wonder
fully hospitable people and there
is a great deal to be learned
from getting to know them.
However, you will never see this
until you can step outside of
yourself once in a while and
accept the Austrian culture, tra
ditionalism and all.

cans. It cannot be escaped by
running to Vienna, although
Vienna has much more to offer
in the way of cultural events.
It is this basic failure to rec
ognize Austrians as Austrians
and not Americans, or Germans
for that matter, that has caused
much of this discontent in Sem
mering. There is really no pur
pose in travelling six thousand
miles to meet people who think

do. The Austrians are a wonder
fully hospitable people and there
is a great deal to be learned

However, you will never see this

Mr. Vidal does not suggest that

• Student Failure
Editor, The Daily:
The return of Austria II to
the home campus has been ac
complished by a certain amount
of publicized criticism concerning
the entire overseas program.
That the Overseas Campuses
are not perfect is news to no
one. There exist and most likely
will always exist certain inher
ent problems in such a program
—indeed, as in all educational
systems. No one says that living
at an Overseas Campus is
Utopian.
Given these basic facts of
overseas life and the objectives
of the program, what was so
unique about Austria II?
To the many reasons of mis
understanding already cited, I
would like to add another vari
able which has been denied by
others: the students themselves.
Instead of trying to work with
and around the basic problems
which confronted them, some
students in Austria II not only
accentuated (exacerbated) these
problems, but also created new
antagonisms. Instead of trying
to alleviate these problems by
initiating new programs, stu
dents repeatedly criticized and
emphasized the unpleasant side
of life in the Hotel Panhans.
They objected to certain rules
and policies which could not be
(and hence were not) immed
iately remedied—if they could
be remedied at all. I certainly
would not blame the Director of
Stanford in Austria for the an
tagonisms resulting from these
complaints.
In addition to the failure of
many to balance or at least at
tempt to balance the disadvan
tages of life at an Overseas
Campus, there were those who
made no attempt to make con
tact, not only with the people
of Semmering, but even with
others in the group. I am not
referring to students who are
not interested in such contacts,
rather to those who said they
were and yet did nothing to
achieve them. These students
were usually some of the most
vocal complainers on this sub
ject.
Briefly then the main cause
of the troubles in Austria II
can be traced to the manner in
which this group reacted with
out understanding or coopera
tion to all of the aforesaid real
ities of the situation. What Aus
tria II lacked was sense of re
sponsibility and above all ma
turity. RENEE MOSS

The solution to the publish

I joined the Stanford Band
this year with no better reason
in mind than to get out the
neglected clarinet, oil it up, and
doodle around a bit to see what
notes I could still reach. Slightly
shocked by the great number
of hours per week the Band
would take out of my schedule, I
beleived that it could never be
worth it. Now that the season
is over, I see that nothing could
have been more worthwhile.
The Band has had an "unblem
ished" season, scoring successes
against such top-rated bands as
UCLA's and such not-so-impres
sive bands as "Kal's." But what
made this Band so great was not
the fact that it was made up of
100-odd super-musicians, be
cause it wasn't. The sensitive
tone qualities which make a
quality orchestra count zero in
the marching band — musical
blasts from blown-out guts
count everything, and the latter
is what you've been hearing out
there. Combine that with the
competitive spirit and you have
a winner. But the Band's spirit
had a way of spreading out over
the school. Unlike many others,
this Band wasn't an added-on
optional extra, but an integral
part of the overall school spirit.
The Big Game culminated
many weeks of hard work and
particularly two days of lost
sleep. And what a payoff! With
the keyed-up spectators, the
spirited Soto-men, the quick-wit
ted cheerleaders, the red-hot
Dollies, and the super-bltchln'
Stanford band right there when
the mighty Stanford football
team set the new 6-game-win

knew the Cal bear had bit hard.

Editor, The Daily:
Congratulations. Last Friday's
Dnily was unsurpassed in spirit
building for Stanford's last and
greatest game of the season. Un
fortunately, though, the editorial
page displayed a somewhat un
timely lament on the "dual cul
ture" described in Mr. Couzens'
oversimplified analogy with the
boy and lyre cultures.
I for one, however, see no
such dichotomy of cultures nec
essarily existing at Stanford.
Any real sense of community to
be achieved here must have its
foundation in a unifying school
spirit—and I don't mean a rah
rah football spirit as opposed to
an academic or intellectual one.
My point is that these aren't
two separate, opposing cultures,
but one single spirit that has
as its essence a deep pride in
one's school, along with an un
derlying attitude that extols
excellence in any field.
Sure, there are legitimate crit
icism to be made of big-time
athletics, and we all hope they
will lead to constructive, sensi
ble change where change is
needed. But meanwhile our ath
letic teams, however "profes
sional" they may be, deserve
our support and pride as much
as any other aspect of Stan
ford. We've done a lot to elimi
nate the image of the stud
farm and the "Stanford snob,"
but it seems we've gotten car
ried away and ended up at the
other extreme, displaying a
widespread lack of pride in our
school. A critical, inquiring atti
tude is wonderful, but if it de
stroys every bit of pride in an
institution, it is killing the
school spirit that is the life
blood of a university commu
nitv.

I may be an idealist or an
optimist, but I think of the
"general yahooism" Friday night
and again during the downpour
in Berkeley Saturday, not as
pure chauvinism or anything
else directed specifically at the
New Left's world view, but
rather as a fantastic display of
students' pride and support. For
me, Mr. Couzens, Big Game is
not pretense. It is one, very im
portant outward manifestation
of a great school spirit.

The most famous 'BEAT CAL'
banner . . .
To me 1959 does not seem too
long ago, but it seems your
records are clouded when you
give credit to the wrong group
of students in the hanging of the
Cal Campanile banner. To
my way of thinking, this group
is second to the "Immortal 21,"
and I hate to see them ignored.
By group designation, you
must credit this even to the then
vital RALLY COMM, with
sprinklings of Beta's and D.U.'s.
Three people of significant note
were the plans organizer (Rich
Garlinghouse), the gal who as
sumed a temporary pregnant
look to get the banner up into
the tower (Lynn Chatterton) and
a Stanford graduate attending
Cal law school who acquired
necessary student body cards
(Jim Herbert). Also, the plan
could not have been carried out
without dozens more helping.

Editor, The Daily:
I think the members of Aus

fessor Spitz a vote of thanks
for supporting us in our
claims that Semmering is not
the place for the Austrian Cam
pus. However I feel his choice
of the word "primitive" to de
scribe Semmering gets to the
root of the problem that has
faced the students in both
groups I and 11. They found
something in Semmering that
they could not come to grips
with, something that ran against
their good old American grain.
For a lack of a better word
they labeled it primitive, at least
subconsciously. I contend that
this is not something peculiar
to Semmering but a basic part
of the Austrian character and
must be accepted as such.
One does not feel this as
strongly in Vienna due to its cos
mopolitan nature, but after
spending a number of weeks
there, begin to feel this some
thing. However, you wouldn't
think of calling a great cultural
center such as Vienna primitive.
Just what is this something? It
is that conservatism, almost to
the point of being reactionary,
is very deeply rooted in
the Habsburg tradition. It is
something that will be found
everywhere you go in Austria
and it is that which makes

sumed a temporary pregnant
look to get the banner up into
the tower (Lynn Chatterton) and
a Stanford graduate attending
Cal law school who acquired
necessary student body cards
(Jim Herbert). Also, the plan
could not have been carried out
without dozens more helping.

• Primitive?
Editor, The Daily:
I think the members of Aus
tria I and Austria II owe Pro

fessor Spitz a vote of thanks
for supporting us in our
claims that Semmering is not
the place for the Austrian Cam
pus. However I feel his choice
of the word "primitive" to de
scribe Semmering gets to the
root of the problem that has
faced the students in both
groups I and 11. They found
something in Semmering that
they could not come to grips
with, something that ran against
their good old American grain.
For a lack of a better word
they labeled it primitive, at least
subconsciously. I contend that
this is not something peculiar
to Semmering but a basic part
of the Austrian character and
must be accepted as such.
One does not feel this as
strongly in Vienna due to its cos
mopolitan nature, but after
spending a number of weeks
there, begin to feel this some
thing. However, you wouldn't
think of calling a great cultural
center such as Vienna primitive.
Just what is this something? It
is that conservatism, almost to
the point of being reactionary,
is very deeply rooted in
the Habsburg tradition. It is
something that will be found
everywhere you go in Austria
and it is that which makes
Austrians different from Ameri
cans. It cannot be escaped by
running to Vienna, although
Vienna has much more to offer
in the way of cultural events.
It is this basic failure to rec
ognize Austrians as Austrians
and not Americans, or Germans
for that matter, that has caused
much of this discontent in Sem
mering. There is really no pur
pose in travelling six thousand
miles to meet people who think
and live much the same as you
do. The Austrians are a wonder
fully hospitable people and there
is a great deal to be learned
from getting to know them.
However, you will never see this
until you can step outside of
yourself once in a while and
accept the Austrian culture, tra
ditionalism and all.

• Change
Editor, The Daily:
A slight correction to the quo
tation from me. That I shall
write when I feel the internal
pressure should read publish. I
have written and discarded
enough manuscripts to make I
don't know how many books.
Publishing is another matter.

• Ifp For Tenure
Editor, The Dally:
It appears Dr. Good has miss
ed the point of Mr. Vidal's cri
ticism of tenure by publication.
Mr. Vidal does not suggest that
there is not a place for Platos
in the university, rather that

Stanford is rejecting the Socra
tes. It might be added that in
this day of gushing publication
from the bowels of the univer
sity, a few more good teachers
would provide the students with
a more balanced diet.
Dr. Good, would Christ de
serve tenure?

• Student Failure
Editor, The Daily:
The return of Austria II to
the home campus has been ac
complished by a certain amount
of publicized criticism concerning
the entire overseas program.
That the Overseas Campuses
are not perfect is news to no
one. There exist and most likely
will always exist certain inher
ent problems in such a program
—indeed, as in all educational
systems. No one says that living
at an Overseas Campus is
Utopian.
Given these basic facts of
overseas life and the objectives
of the program, what was so
unique about Austria II?
To the many reasons of mis
understanding already cited, I
would like to add another vari
able which has been denied by
others: the students themselves.
Instead of trying to work with
and around the basic problems
which confronted them, some
students in Austria II not only
accentuated (exacerbated) these
problems, but also created new
antagonisms. Instead of trying
to alleviate these problems by
initiating new programs, stu
dents repeatedly criticized and
emphasized the unpleasant side
of life in the Hotel Panhans.
They objected to certain rules
and policies which could not be
(and hence were not) immed
iately remedied—if they could
be remedied at all. I certainly
would not blame the Director of
Stanford in Austria for the an
tagonisms resulting from these
complaints.
In addition to the failure of
many to balance or at least at
tempt to balance the disadvan
tages of life at an Overseas
Campus, there were those who
made no attempt to make con
tact, not only with the people
of Semmering, but even with
others in the group. I am not
referring to students who are
not interested in such contacts,
rather to those who said they
were and yet did nothing to
achieve them. These students
were usually some of the most
vocal complainers on this sub
ject.
Briefly then the main cause
of the troubles in Austria II
can be traced to the manner in
which this group reacted with
out understanding or coopera
tion to all of the aforesaid real
ities of the situation. What Aus
tria II lacked was sense of re
sponsibility and above all ma
turity. RENEE MOSS

• Roving Prof
Editor, The Daily:
I agree with Mr. Vidal!
The solution to the publish
or parish dilemma is to require
non-publishing professors to use
their "publishing" time in rov
ing the campus, sitting here by
a tree and there by a fountain,
rambling on to enraptured stu
dents whose awestruck "yes's"
and "no's" would punctuate the
steady flow of knowledge.

• Kal Lost
Editor, The Daily:
I joined the Stanford Band
this year with no better reason
in mind than to get out the
neglected clarinet, oil it up, and
doodle around a bit to see what
notes I could still reach. Slightly
shocked by the great number
of hours per week the Band
would take out of my schedule, I
beleived that it could never be
worth it. Now that the season
is over, I see that nothing could
have been more worthwhile.
The Band has had an "unblem
ished" season, scoring successes
against such top-rated bands as
UCLA's and such not-so-impres
sive bands as "Kal's." But what
made this Band so great was not
the fact that it was made up of
100-odd super-musicians, be
cause it wasn't. The sensitive
tone qualities which make a
quality orchestra count zero in
the marching band — musical
blasts from blown-out guts
count everything, and the latter
is what you've been hearing out
there. Combine that with the
competitive spirit and you have
a winner. But the Band's spirit
had a way of spreading out over
the school. Unlike many others,
this Band wasn't an added-on
optional extra, but an integral
part of the overall school spirit.
The Big Game culminated
many weeks of hard work and
particularly two days of lost
sleep. And what a payoff! With
the keyed-up spectators, the
spirited Soto-men, the quick-wit
ted cheerleaders, the red-hot
Dollies, and the super-bltchln'
Stanford band right there when
the mighty Stanford football
team set the new 6-game-win
ning-streak record, everyone
knew the Cal bear had bit hard.
