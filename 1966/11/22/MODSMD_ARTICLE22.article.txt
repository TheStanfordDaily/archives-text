# The 						Capitol Scene
## Listen For Lyndon's New Image 
### Art Buchwald 
Now that President Johnson's
operation on his throat has been
so successful, I can reveal the
reason the President decided to
have it done.
It has been no secret that for
the past few months the Presi
dent's popularity has been slip
ping. Despite the fact that he
had got more legislation through
than any other President, and
although the country is riding
its greatest wave of prosperity,
many people seemed to be voic

ing suspicions of their leader.
The President, who rules by con
sensus, was smart enough to
know that something had to be
done about his image. But what?
He called in all his advisers
just before he left for Manila
and laid it on the line. He
wanted them to speak frankly
and make any suggestions that
they thought would make the
people love him again.
Wedding Bells
One adviser said, "I think we
should put more stress on pre
senting you as a statesman and
less on the fact that you re try
ing to think of new ways of
spending the taxpayer's money."
Another adviser said, Mr.
President, your popu'arity was
at its height when Luci got
married. Couldn't you arrange a
Christmas wedding for Linda?"
"Ah probably could," the
President said, "but that wouid
give us all of 1967 with nothing
to do."
A third adviser said, "Mr.
President, you asked us to speak
frankly and I will. A recent poll
taken by Zlonk Brothers asked
people what was the one thing
that annoyed them the most
about your television appear
ance, and 73 per cent of those
questioned said it was your
Texas accent."
Overnight Change
"Well, what am ah supposed
to do about that?" the President
said angrily.
"Now don't get mad, Mr. Presi
dent. I'm just quoting the poll.
Perhaps if we could change
your accent we could change
your image."
"It's a little late for that."
The President flushed.
"No it isn't, sir. There's a doc
tor at Johns Hopkins who can
perform a minor operation on
your throat which could change
your speech overnight. He can
give you any accent you want."
The President said, still angry,
"And what accent do ah want?"
"I was thinking of a New

England accent with perhaps a
slight Harvard twang."
Texas Blood
"Never," the President said,
slamming his fist on the con
ference table. "Ah was born in
Taxas, raised in Texas and as
love Texas."
Just then an adviser came in
with the latest popularity polls.
They revealed the President had
slipped another two percentage
points.
The President studied the polls
for several minutes and then
said, "Will the operation hurt?"
"No, sir. It's just like having
a polyp removed. I assure you,
sir, with your dynamism and
a New England accent, you'll be
unbeatable."
"What about Lady Bird?"
"People like her accent so
she won't have to do a thing."
Alternative
"Of course," another adviser
said, "if you did have the opera
tion you'd have to sell the
ranch."
"Then where would ah go on
vacation ?" the President
shouted.
"They say Hyannis Port is
very nice in the summertime."
"All right, all right. But if it
doesn't work, there's going to be
some very sorry people around
here."
"Don't worry. It will work, Mr.
President, and I can't wait to see
the expression on Bobby and
Teddy's faces when you give
your State of the Union message
to Congress in January of next
year."

Overnight Change
"Well, what am ah supposed
to do about that?" the President
said angrily.
"Now don't get mad, Mr. Presi
dent. I'm just quoting the poll.
Perhaps if we could change
your accent we could change
your image."
"It's a little late for that."
The President flushed.
"No it isn't, sir. There's a doc
tor at Johns Hopkins who can
perform a minor operation on
your throat which could change
your speech overnight. He can
give you any accent you want."
The President said, still angry,
"And what accent do ah want?"
"I was thinking of a New

England accent with perhaps a
slight Harvard twang."
Texas Blood
"Never," the President said,
slamming his fist on the con
ference table. "Ah was born in
Taxas, raised in Texas and as
love Texas."
Just then an adviser came in
with the latest popularity polls.
They revealed the President had
slipped another two percentage
points.
The President studied the polls
for several minutes and then
said, "Will the operation hurt?"
"No, sir. It's just like having
a polyp removed. I assure you,
sir, with your dynamism and
a New England accent, you'll be
unbeatable."
"What about Lady Bird?"
"People like her accent so
she won't have to do a thing."
Alternative
"Of course," another adviser
said, "if you did have the opera
tion you'd have to sell the
ranch."
"Then where would ah go on
vacation ?" the President
shouted.
"They say Hyannis Port is
very nice in the summertime."
"All right, all right. But if it
doesn't work, there's going to be
some very sorry people around
here."
"Don't worry. It will work, Mr.
President, and I can't wait to see
the expression on Bobby and
Teddy's faces when you give
your State of the Union message
to Congress in January of next
year."
Now that President Johnson's
operation on his throat has been
so successful, I can reveal the
reason the President decided to
have it done.
It has been no secret that for
the past few months the Presi
dent's popularity has been slip
ping. Despite the fact that he
had got more legislation through
than any other President, and
although the country is riding
its greatest wave of prosperity,
many people seemed to be voic

ing suspicions of their leader.
The President, who rules by con
sensus, was smart enough to
know that something had to be
done about his image. But what?
He called in all his advisers
just before he left for Manila
and laid it on the line. He
wanted them to speak frankly
and make any suggestions that
they thought would make the
people love him again.
Wedding Bells
One adviser said, "I think we
should put more stress on pre
senting you as a statesman and
less on the fact that you re try
ing to think of new ways of
spending the taxpayer's money."
Another adviser said, Mr.
President, your popu'arity was
at its height when Luci got
married. Couldn't you arrange a
Christmas wedding for Linda?"
"Ah probably could," the
President said, "but that wouid
give us all of 1967 with nothing
to do."
A third adviser said, "Mr.
President, you asked us to speak
frankly and I will. A recent poll
taken by Zlonk Brothers asked
people what was the one thing
that annoyed them the most
about your television appear
ance, and 73 per cent of those
questioned said it was your
Texas accent."
