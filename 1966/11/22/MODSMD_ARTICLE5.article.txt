# Freshman Concern Organizes Ad Hoc Social Regs Committee
## 
### BARBARA LEVIN 
The reasons for the formation of an
Ad Hoc Social Regulations Committee
were discussed yesterday by Mimi
Sherman, Judicial Council chairman.
She cited the need for studying the
freshman orientation to the rules as
one jf the primary factors.
"The study group," Miss Sherman
stated, "is an appropriate response to
a pressing problem."
Concern in Roble and Branner
about the objectives behind certain
regulations led to discussion with
members of Judiical Council. The
sponsors and directors in these
houses felt that further explanation
was necessary to make the rules
viable and understandable for fresh
men women.
Committee of Six Refusal
A few weeks ago this problem be
came distressing to Roble's Commit
tee of Six which felt that the "red
tape" involved in the system was not
increasing responsibility nor serving
any other function. A sponsor mem
ber of the group, felt that this opin
ion was a reflection of the general
discontent among the freshman wom
en.
As a response to the problem, the
Committee of Six, an auxiliary body
of Judicial Council, decided not to
hear cases of minor social infractions,
such as pink slip violations, failure
to pull red tabs, etc. At this point the
Judicial Council was contacted to ap
prove the actions of the house group.
The Judicial Council, in attempting
to reaffirm this decision, found that
they could not do so. As Miss Sher
man explained, "The Judicial Coun

cil has no power to change existing
regulations." For this reason, a study
committee was set up to determine
the freshmen women's attitude to
ward the rules and a proper means of
enforcement, she said.
Two Earlier Meetings
The Ad Hoc Committee was for
mulated during two preliminary
meetings with house directors and
members of the Dean of Students Of
fice as well as sponsors and members
of Judicial Council. Leslie Galliard,
ASSU Social Secretary, was placed in
charge of the group because social
regulations come within her area of
administrative responsibility.
At these meetings, both the present
problem and the relevant background
were discussed. Barbara Glidden, Ac
tivities Advisor, spoke at the second
meeting and explained the status of
the existing regulations.
She said that the regulations which
are now in effect were accepted by
the Board of Trustees in the spring
of 1965. A three-year moratorium was
placed upon further changes at that
time. It was felt that this stipulation
was necessary to control the validity
of this experimental policy.
Also mentioned in the discussion
was the fact that the LASSU-AWS
Social Regulations Committee abol
ished itself last spring because it
deemed its tak unneceary. In it place
a Social Adviory Committee under
the ASSU Social Secretary was to be
established to consider all problems
related to regulations of this nature.
The Social Advisory Committee
was designed as a co-educational
body, Miss Galliard commented. Since

this issue involved only women stu
dents, the organizing group felt that
another committee was necessary to
study the problem.
This new committee was organized
by those present at the original ses
sions. Included in the group were
two students from Roble and Branner
(a freshman and a sponsor), one stu
dent each from Lagunita, the Row,
and Florence Moore, one member of
the Dean of Students staff, two dorm
directors (one from a freshman house
and one from an upperclass house),
and a member of Judicial Council.
Mimi Sherman stressed that the
function of the group is terminal.
"This committee has been organized
to study a specific problem; the de
velopment in freshmen of responsi
bility necessary for the system. It
is 'ad hoc' and is working towards
its own abolishment—upon the reso
lution of the problem or upon the
realization that a practical solution
does not exist."
Survey Completed
Since its formation, the Committee
has done a survey to determine the
attitudes of freshmen women toward
the regulations. Miss Galliard said,
"The study has two basic aims. One
is to determine how this year's fresh
men regarded the rules and how these
regulations compare with their re
strictions at home during their senior
year in high school. The other, which
can be achieved by relating the re
sults to last spring's study of the
regulations, was to ascertain any per
ceivable difference in attitude be
tween this group of freshmen and the
last one."

The Ad Hoc Committee was for
mulated during two preliminary
meetings with house directors and
members of the Dean of Students Of
fice as well as sponsors and members
of Judicial Council. Leslie Galliard,
ASSU Social Secretary, was placed in
charge of the group because social
regulations come within her area of
administrative responsibility.
At these meetings, both the present
problem and the relevant background
were discussed. Barbara Glidden, Ac
tivities Advisor, spoke at the second
meeting and explained the status of
the existing regulations.
She said that the regulations which
are now in effect were accepted by
the Board of Trustees in the spring
of 1965. A three-year moratorium was
placed upon further changes at that
time. It was felt that this stipulation
was necessary to control the validity
of this experimental policy.
Also mentioned in the discussion
was the fact that the LASSU-AWS
Social Regulations Committee abol
ished itself last spring because it
deemed its tak unneceary. In it place
a Social Adviory Committee under
the ASSU Social Secretary was to be
established to consider all problems
related to regulations of this nature.
The Social Advisory Committee
was designed as a co-educational
body, Miss Galliard commented. Since

this issue involved only women stu
dents, the organizing group felt that
another committee was necessary to
study the problem.
This new committee was organized
by those present at the original ses
sions. Included in the group were
two students from Roble and Branner
(a freshman and a sponsor), one stu
dent each from Lagunita, the Row,
and Florence Moore, one member of
the Dean of Students staff, two dorm
directors (one from a freshman house
and one from an upperclass house),
and a member of Judicial Council.
Mimi Sherman stressed that the
function of the group is terminal.
"This committee has been organized
to study a specific problem; the de
velopment in freshmen of responsi
bility necessary for the system. It
is 'ad hoc' and is working towards
its own abolishment—upon the reso
lution of the problem or upon the
realization that a practical solution
does not exist."
Survey Completed
Since its formation, the Committee
has done a survey to determine the
attitudes of freshmen women toward
the regulations. Miss Galliard said,
"The study has two basic aims. One
is to determine how this year's fresh
men regarded the rules and how these
regulations compare with their re
strictions at home during their senior
year in high school. The other, which
can be achieved by relating the re
sults to last spring's study of the
regulations, was to ascertain any per
ceivable difference in attitude be
tween this group of freshmen and the
last one."
The reasons for the formation of an
Ad Hoc Social Regulations Committee
were discussed yesterday by Mimi
Sherman, Judicial Council chairman.
She cited the need for studying the
freshman orientation to the rules as
one jf the primary factors.
"The study group," Miss Sherman
stated, "is an appropriate response to
a pressing problem."
Concern in Roble and Branner
about the objectives behind certain
regulations led to discussion with
members of Judiical Council. The
sponsors and directors in these
houses felt that further explanation
was necessary to make the rules
viable and understandable for fresh
men women.
Committee of Six Refusal
A few weeks ago this problem be
came distressing to Roble's Commit
tee of Six which felt that the "red
tape" involved in the system was not
increasing responsibility nor serving
any other function. A sponsor mem
ber of the group, felt that this opin
ion was a reflection of the general
discontent among the freshman wom
en.
As a response to the problem, the
Committee of Six, an auxiliary body
of Judicial Council, decided not to
hear cases of minor social infractions,
such as pink slip violations, failure
to pull red tabs, etc. At this point the
Judicial Council was contacted to ap
prove the actions of the house group.
The Judicial Council, in attempting
to reaffirm this decision, found that
they could not do so. As Miss Sher
man explained, "The Judicial Coun

cil has no power to change existing
regulations." For this reason, a study
committee was set up to determine
the freshmen women's attitude to
ward the rules and a proper means of
enforcement, she said.

directors (one from a freshman house
and one from an upperclass house),
and a member of Judicial Council.
Mimi Sherman stressed that the
function of the group is terminal.
"This committee has been organized
to study a specific problem; the de
velopment in freshmen of responsi
bility necessary for the system. It
is 'ad hoc' and is working towards
its own abolishment—upon the reso
lution of the problem or upon the
realization that a practical solution
does not exist."
Survey Completed
Since its formation, the Committee
has done a survey to determine the
attitudes of freshmen women toward
the regulations. Miss Galliard said,
"The study has two basic aims. One
is to determine how this year's fresh
men regarded the rules and how these
regulations compare with their re
strictions at home during their senior
year in high school. The other, which
can be achieved by relating the re
sults to last spring's study of the
regulations, was to ascertain any per
ceivable difference in attitude be
tween this group of freshmen and the
last one."
