# IN DELT CASE
## Judicial Council Dissenters Urge Re-Examination 
### CHUCK FULKERSON 
A Judicial Council dissent announced
yesterday urged the University ad
ministration not to accept the ma
jority's sentence of probation for the
Delt head-shavers, while administra
tors attempted to make clearer the
exact provisions of the sentence.
Fred Poorbaugh, acting as spokes
man for the Judicial Council dis
senters in the 5-3 split, said the dis
agreement was over the question of
judicial procedure as well as stiffer
punishments. Poorbaugh claimed that
although the Council agreed to hear
the Delts involved in the hair cut
ting incident as individuals, their
final decision ignored the individual
attitudes of the offenders. The final
decision stipulated that all twenty-two
men found guilty should be punished
equally by placing them on proba
tion.
Poorbaugh, in conjunction with Bob
Taylor and Martin Gerry, has pre
pared a text which more explicitly
states the reasons for their dissatis
faction with the present decision.
Quoting from the text, he said, "We
strongly dissent from the recom
mended penalty for all defendents
which: fails to fulfill the Judicial
Council's responsibility to the Stan
ford community, fails to respect the
Judicial Council's obligations to the
defendents, and severely isolates ac
ceptable procedures."
Three Attitudes
Asked to comment in more detail,
Poorbaugh commented that the of
fenders held three different attitudes,
• A few felt their actions were to
tally admissible and would do the
same thing over again; they were glad
they had done it.
• The second group considered their
actions to be in the form of a protest.
Although they were sorry that the
incident turned out as it did, they too
would do it again. Poorbaugh dif
ferentiates between the two by saying
that "the second group is thinking at
least" and since their action was not
totally irrational, there is a chance for
reform.
• The last group, which was in the
majority, was sincerely sorry for their
actions and understood why they were
unjust.
Unfair
"Obviously," Poorbaugh said, "with
a range of attitudes as divergent as
these, the same punishment for the

entire group is grossly unfair." The
dissenters felt the Judicial Commit
tee had failed in its responsibility to
the Stanford Community by allowing
the offenders, where action was totally
irrational, to remain on campus. There
is nothing to prevent a recurring in
cident, Poorbaugh claimed. It is also
unjust, he said, to rank the first group
of individuals with those who felt
sincere remorse for their actions.
The text states that the entire matter
should be discussed in greater detail
with the offenders, but also recom
mends the first group be suspended
from campus because of their threat
to the University community. Social
and disciplinary action is recom
mended for the latter two.
Overseas Campus
The question of exactly what the
terms of the probation were, arose
in the consideration of overseas cam
puses. Three of the students involved
in the sit-in last spring in President
Sterling's office, were penalized with
suspended suspension, had their ad
missions to foreign campuses revoked.
In the present case, none of the
twenty-two students tried by the
Judicial Council had already been ac
cepted for an overseas group. Several
of those tried by Dean Winbigler had
been, however, and according to Bob
Hamrdla, assistant to the director of
the Overseas Campus Office, "their
cases will be reviewed."
Hamrdla emphasized that the pro
bation itself did not automatically
mean the acceptance would be re
voked, but that any decision depended
entirely on the individual case. Dean
Winbigler added that "it is not the
function of this penalty to make any
decision whatever about their ability
to go overseas."
