W'e're looking
for Ph.Ds who'd
appreciate the
university atmosphere
with the personal
advantages of working
for private industry.
THE Avco Everett Research Laboratory is a somewhat unusual institution, at least by the
normal standards of industry.
It is run by Research Scientists who are engaged in pure research in Aero Physics,
Atomic Physics, Plasma Physics, Re-entry Physics, Gas Lasers and Magnetohydrodynamics. Many of
its people have made for themselves an international reputation in the scientific world. And in the
process, they have given the Laboratory a worldwide reputation in the field of high temperature
gas dynamics.
The university atmosphere, and the use of an interdisciplinary approach, account for the
accomplishments and high reputation of the Laboratory and its Research Scientists. It is certainly one
of the factors which continues to attract men and women with their doctorates to the Avco Everett
Research Laboratory.
Right now, we're looking for some particularly qualified Research Scientists who would
appreciate working in this academic climate, and who would equally appreciate the personal
ad/antages of working for private industry. Within obvious and reasonable boundaries, they'll be
able to do the work they wish to do, and add to their personal reputations in the scientific world.
The publication of papers is encouraged; indeed, the Laboratory's output of meaningful
papers on high temperature gas dynamics is unique by any objective standards.
Interested? We'll send you a bibliography and abstracts of recent research papers published by
staff members to assist you in your evaluation. Write to Mr. Louis Rudzinsky, Avco Everett
