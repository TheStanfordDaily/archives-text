# Libraries Suffering From Lack Of Funds
## 
### BARB EHRLICH 
Within twenty years the Stanford libraries
will need an additional 300,00 square feet of
space — an area larger than that of either
the Main or the Undergraduate Library.
"The Main Library at present holds ap
proximately one millon books," said Ruther
ford O. Rogers, director of the university li
braries.
Inadequate Space
"We are currently acquiring 50,000 books
per year for the Main Library alone. If we
only maintain our rate of acquisition we will
Liave an additional million books within twenty
years."
In his 1966 report Rogers estimated that
"present available facilities will be exhausted
by 1970, and even if book stacks are provided
in the second half of the Undergraduate Li
brary basement, the research collections will
run out of space by 1973."
Crowding in the Main Library has already
resulted in "inadequate work space to cata
logue books needed and purchased," said
Rogers.
Catalogue Backlog
The backlog of uncatalogued books is, in
fact, one of the biggest problems. Rogers de
clared in his 1965 report that he was "shock
ed" to learn when he reached Stanford that
33,000 books were still uncatalogued.
Although the library staff catalogued 30

per cent more books last year than in the year
previously, the backlog remained because pur
chases increased. The library receives many
requests for books it already has simply be
cause they are not catalogued.
"We have to be able to catalogue the books,
or increasing our rate of acquisition will do
no good whatsoever," said Rogers. "The big
gest potential problem is the inexorable
growth of the research collections without
space for their accommodation and for the
larger staff needed for processing."
Turnover of Staff
The rapid turnover of library staff members
increases the difficulty of improving efficiency.
"The library enjoys the questionable distinc
tion of paying salary requisition personnel the
lowest rate on campus," said Rogers in his
1966 report.
"An unconscionable amount of very valuable
time has been spent in recruiting and training
staff, and there is little question that this has
had an adverse effect on cataloguing produc
tion."
Salary schedules were raised by the Univer
sity for non-professional library staff members
this year. However, salaries of the professional
staff will not be raised for at least another
year.
Improvement Through Automation
Automation in the library will probably
vastly improve cataloguing effciency. The

Undergraduate Library, which has no backlog
of uncatalogued books, at present uses a com
puter-based book catalogue.
Print-outs of the book lists from the com
puter are photographed and reduced, and then
published in book form. Supplements are
printed every two or three months, and books
not yet in the catalogue are kept in a file at
the main desk. A new book is published once
each year.
In addition, "the Libraries are extremely
sensitive to developments in computer tech
niques and are monitoring the whole field to
take advantage of worthwhile applications,"
said Rogers in his 1966 report.
One possible system is one that would en
able a student to find if the library has a cer
tain book, and if so, exactly where it is (in
cluding whether someone else is using it.) It
may even be possible to do this from office
consoles.
To install such a system would take years,
however. In his report the Chairman of the
Libraries Automation Committee remarked,
"Meanwhile we have to contend with a manual
system which is a jungle of cumbersome pro
cedures. Stanford should work intensively at
cleaning up its manual system concurrently
with designing computer systems."
Outstanding Special Collections
Stanford does have certain outstanding
specialty collections, such as the autonomous

Hoover Library. Approximately one-third of
the total library holdings of the University
are contained in the Hoover Library, including
800,000 books, 150,000 government documents,
and 1,800 periodicals.
The library's curators "covered the globe
in search of original records" according to
the Hoover Institute's 1966 Report. It pur
chases approximately 30,000 books each year,
and has perhaps the best collection on the
growth of Communism outside the Iron Cur
tain. These resources attract several hundred
scholars each year.
In addition, the Hoover Library is building
the Lou Henry Hoover building chiefly to
"provide much-needed space for the research
staff and for the steadily expanding library
collections." The building is financed entirely
by private contributions.
The Hoover Library, however, has only a
very specialized collection and cannot be used
by the majority of Stanford students. It also
has a great deal of private support.
Little Private Support
Even though funds for the libraries have
been increasing in recent years, the libraries
have received little private support. When the
Undergraduate Library was offered as a prior
ity package to PACE donors, for instance, no
major giver supported it. It eventually had
to be financed by allocation of general PACE
funds.

The greatest need of the library right now
is for an increased budget — to increase the
rate of acquisition, to expand the library's
physical facilities, to raise staff salaries, to
automate, and to get through the logjam in
the catalogue.
The University Libraries have two excel
lent administrators in Rogers and Warren B.
Kuhn, the librarian of the Undergraduate Li
brary and former assistant librarian at Prince
ton.
Desire For Improvement
The library has improved in recent years:
purchases have increased, cataloguing has at
least kept pace, and the Undergraduate Li
brary represents an enormous advance.
Interlibrary loans, one of the checks on the
quality of a library, also indicates the im
provement. Stanford borrowed 12 per cent
less books from other libraries last year and
lent 10 per cent more.
But the momentum must be continued. Said
Rogers at the conclusion of his 1966 report,
"The most gratifying aspect of working in
Stanford's libraries is the feeling that there
is a widespread desire for great improvement
and a recognition of the resources essential to
bring it about.
"If this atmosphere persists for five to ten
years, conspicuous enhancement of Stanford's
libraries seems a certainty."
