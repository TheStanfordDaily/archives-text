Stanford's chess-playing IBM 7090 computer carried off the
honors Monday by defeating Carnegie Tech's Control Data Corpo
ration 6-20 computer.
Fresh from victory, the 7090's programmers have launched into
four simultaneous matches with a new rival—the M-20 computer
at Moscow's Institute of Experimental and Theoretical Physics.
The first set of moves was received from Moscow last week.
Never daunted, Carnegie Tech has prepared an improved pro
gram for a rematch expected to start this week by mail.
The chess moves between Stanford and Moscow will be trans
mitted by telegraph. The match is expected to last about 40 moves
and will take about a year to complete.
With four games being played at once between Stanford's IBM
7090 and Moscow's M-20, each side is playing two "blacks" and two
"whites."
