# Flexibility Would Enhance 'European Experience'
## 
### PAUL RUPERT 
Editor's note: Paul Rupert was presi
dent of Italy XI and is currently serving
as coordinator of Overseas Campus study
and reform for the ASSU Education Com
mittee. His quotations in the following ana
lysis are taken from the Stanford bulletin
Stanford Overseas Campuses.

In 1958 Stanford established its first over
seas campus in Germany in what proved to
be the pilot program for the present five
campuses.
This was an experiment in liberal educa
tion — an effort to set up an educational com
munity in a European environment. The meth
od was somewhat less than experimental in
the academic realm, however.
Aside from the hope that courses might be
relevant to the foreign setting and that stu
dents and professors might profit from close
association, general study requirements, stock
courses, and the lecture method came to domi
nite the campuses as the General Studies Com
mittee apparently indendcd.
The development of "new insights and per
spectives" through exposure to different so
cial and cultural values was left to the stu
dent in his extra-curricular hours.
Occasional Success
While occasional successes have been regi
stered in integrating courses and countries or
in creating an informal community of scho
lars, the program remains for the most part
a compromise of experimental zeal in the

interest of "an academic standard fully equal
to that at the home campus."
The Stanford of 1966 differs a great deal
from that of 1958. A higher caliber of student
body, a greater interest in seminar work and
independent study, and a demand for greater
freedom and responsibility in course planning
and work exist alongside a very recent empha
sis on reform and the maintenance of a criti
cal and creative attitude toward existing insti
tutions.
While the home campus has attempted to
meet student requests in some of these areas
the relatively new overseas campuses have
only begun to entertain seriously thoughts of
such flexibility.
Further hesitancy might well result, how
ever, in a much-increased vocal barrage if
student voices — as heard in the recent Aus
tria issue or in the forthcoming proposals of
the new subcommittee which will consider
implementation of the Martindale report —
are not encouraged and utilized for construc
tive change.
Recently, the tone and the validity of much
student commentary have been the subject
of administrative criticism. Unfortunately
there seems to be a failure of understanding
between the overseas campuses office and the
critics.
Those who return from their six months
abroad will maintain with Dr. Walker that
"This opportunity is unprecedented in Ameri
can high education."
They will further contend, however, that

much needs to be done before the campuses
become the "voyage of discovery" they are
claimed to be.
The not unreasonable demand that stu
dents are making is for a dual flexibility: an
openness to the perceptions and the proposals
of those who — unlike most of the university
staff — have lived and tried to learn in this
unique environment; and a primary option
in influencing the way those six months of
his intellectual and personal life will be spent.
Until the former occurs its does not seem
likely that we shall enjoy the latter, and there
in lies the fallacy of token reforms and mini
scule changes achieved by lengthy courting of
of an administrative fiat. Only when a certain
daring reigns at the home office can any sort
of freedom and initiative flourish abroad.
I would suggest that the first consideration
of those who question the ends and the means
of the program should be a re-definition of
The European Experience
One might do well to re-consider the hyper
ambitious goal of achieving the General
Studies Committee's definition of "normal
academic progress" in conjunction with Euro
pean exposure of any depth.
It is, after all, the university which sets
the norm of academic progress and it would
seem that if it has spent its time and effort
to establish these costly European branches,
they might well have an intrinsic liberal edu
cational worth which would justify scrapping
some of the general studies requirements
which ostensibly seek an equivalent broaden
ing for those who stay in Palo Alto.

Such an act would require some review of
the purposes and successes of the general
studies program — perhaps a study long over
due.
Were we to conclude that indeed the tight
structure of 'general studies abroad' is con
stricting, we should be free to entertain many
a novel proposal.
The reduction of the number of units from
sixteen to fourteen or less is conceivable.
In eliminating course area rigidity one
would free a greater variety of courses and
professors who fall outside the general studies
realm for inclusion in the program and local
instructors could teach when it was advisable.
The adoption of pass-fail grading in langu
age courses and in non-major general courses
would be both possible and desirable if the
general studies burden were removed; and in
fact one might logically insist that language
courses be graded on this pass-fail option now
since Dr. Walker's argument that language
teachers could not cope with such a system
seems to be side-stepping the issue.
Finally, within such a context the possibility
of substituting a journal for the two-unit civ
course, tutoring or playground work with na
tives for a few units of language, and specially
designed individual or group projects for
courses or course requirements is both appeal
ing and feasible.
Draw Selection
Even if the general studies impasse could
not be overcome, a variety of these changes
would still be possible. Independent of them a

draw system of selection could replace the
present grade-oriented method.
Some positive steps in student evaluation
(and hopefully selection) of professors might
add an imaginative and critical touch to the
process which now returns professors whose
forte is not this experience and which doea
not tap a terribly wide range of young and
interested professors.
A last necessity should be the elimination
of mid-terms and final examinations and the
substitution of seminars and individual and
collective papers and projects which would
encourage the intellectual inter-action of the
community. Present library conditions com
bined with professorial imagination should al
low this.
Regardless of the merit of these specific
ideas it is clear, I think, that the program as
it now stands need radical re-evaluation. The
goal of Stanford abroad must be more than
the mechanical fusion of extant conventional
institutions and foreign exposure.
The criteria for judging an overseas cam
pus' success should be its educational effec
tiveness measured not by this novel program's
compliance with an inadequate model, but by
its response to and its exploitation of the uni
que value of six months in Europe.
If the university were to re-define "normal
academic progress' as personal intellectual
growth, it might reach the conclusion that
the overseas campuses are falling short of
their tx*uly educational potential and are much
in need of a creative critique. Perhaps a re
formation shall follow.
