The recent flury of criticism directed at the Overseas
Campus Program has assumed or overlooked much of
what the program has to offer. Only extended private
travel, which finances, graduation requirements, or the
draft deny most students, offers a comparable addition
to liberal education.
Yet much of the official literature is also incomplete,
for it neglects the personal aspects of an overseas ex
perience, including both the shortcomings and high
lights of the campuses. Today's supplement is written
from a personal point of view, and each contributor
draws from his own experiences at one of the five
foreign campuses.
As most returning students agree, the success or
failure of a six month stay in Europe turns upon the
individual's willingness to immerse himself in the
language and culture of the host nation. Each campus
assists students in making contacts with the people
and provides frequent opportunity for trips and local
excursions. But regardless of the quality of the formal
program, students can gain little more than floss if they
are content to meet a foreign culture only in the class
room or on guided tours.
Perhaps the most important requisite for an overseas
stay is a spirit of adventurous curiosity. Europe is not
the United States, and none of the overseas centers
rivals the home campus in comfort or accomodations.
However, it is the brisk contrast in cultural and intel
lectual environments that makes for a challenging liv
ing and learning experience. Students find their per
sonal and intellectual horizons greatly expanded dur
ing their quarters abroad.
The Overseas Campus Program has become an im
portant part of undergraduate education for a majority
of Stanford students. Like most far-reaching programs,
however, it is in need of constant reevaluation and im
provement. But we are thoroughly convinced of the
role of the Overseas Campus Program in fostering lib
eral education.
