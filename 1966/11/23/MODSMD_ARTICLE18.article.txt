# Overseas Impact Changes The Farm
## 
### GEORGE R. HAMRDLA 
Editor's note: Mr. Hamrdla Is the
Assistant to the Director of the Over
seas Campus Office. He was a student
member of Germany II and has since
been a part of seven additional Ger
many groups in one capacity or an
other.

The freshman at Stanford in the middle
fifties went through pre-reg week, com
lained about the ratio at the Jolly-Up,
planned courses, studied four years, and
graduated.
He attended somewhat automatically
the almost weekly "all-campus reunions"
at Rudy's or Rossotti's, ID's were a farce,
and "Stanford-in-wherever" did not exist.
Some students lamented the lack of mean
ingful intellectual atmosphere, but not
many really cared.
The freshman who came to Stanford two
months ago cannot realize how much
greater are the opportunities for an edu
cation full of solid content, for participa
tion in a vital campus life offering cultural
and intellectual events too numerous to
mention—or to attend.
International Campus
On what must now be one of the most in
ternationally minded campuses in this
country, scarcely a day will go by during
which each person does not talk and think
about events in the "outside" world or
read an article or letter in the Daily about
study overseas.
These are days of active concern on the
part of students; the "silent fifties" have
given way to a changed and energized
campus on which every other undergradu
ate has been or will be studying overseas.
The Overseas Campuses Program is not
responsible for all the transformations of
the past decade, but for those who knew
Stanford before its inception, the impact

of this unique educational venture has be
come particularly noteworthy.
It is a tribute to the innate vigor in the
University that the Overseas Campuses
Program was conceived in a period of rela
tive intelletcual calm. It began as an ex
periment involving 126 students each year,
and immediate, overriding success engen
dered its more permanent status as an
integral part of the University by which
802 undergraduates and some twenty fac
ulty members go to Europe annually.
In a very brief six years, the program
itself has changed in size and scope: a six
fold increase in students and from one
country to five. The fact remains, though,
that the undergraduate at Stanford,
whether overseas or not, regards the Over
seas Campuses as a fully constituent com
ponent of his University—a rather remark
able change in itself, since no one had any
inkling of such expansion at Stanford ten
years ago.
A glance at statistics comparing the
autumn quarters of 1959 and of this year
reveals a surprising trend. The undergrad
uate enrollment has increased 9.4 percent,
while the number of undergraduates ma
joring in the School of Humanities and
Sciences has risen by 29 percent.
The emphasis on the liberal arts is clear
—and a bit surprising in our age. Thus the
student's new orientation toward the out
side, toward life away from the campus,
has significantly altered the aacdemic pro
file of the entire University, and the Over
seas Campuses Program has both supple
mented and encouraged this development.
Today's Stanford undergraduate is much
more likely to have close friends outside
of his freshman house or corridor and his
present living group. The reason? If he
went overseas, he met many students from
other parts of campus whom he would
never have encountered otherwise.

More important, he grew to know them
and have more confidence in his ability to
relate easily to contemporaries of sharply
varying backgrounds.
Most important, many of these relation
ships continue after return from Europe.
And if the student coming back from over
seas has exerted any effort at all, he will
return having become closely acquainted
with professors and their families, the
strongest antidote to the toxic lack of asso
ciation between students and faculty.
These two major readjustments in the
circle of a student's friends and acquaint
ances have resulted in an unbelievable (for
the student of ten years ago) intensifica
tion and interatcion between members of
the Stanford community. The change has
obviously affected those who have not been
overseas as well.
Vigor And Elan
The edifying experience of living In a
Stanford group overseas has contributed
vigor and elan to the more sterile and life
less residential situation which prevailed
on the campus some years ago.
American collegiate "social pressure"
and custom in the abstract do not cease
to have relevance overseas, but as one stu
dent stated about the campus he attended,
"It was the only place where a guy could
ask a girl to borrow her car to go with
another girl."
Co-educational aspects of daily life are
not fettered by the traditional expectation
that any man-woman association must be
accompanied by dating or die.
Living at an overseas campus has also
left its mark on student's more frequent
attempts to evaluate their living groups
here intelligently. Efforts to make the resi
dential facet of the University commensur
ate with and directly supportive to the
learning on the academic side are fostered
and finally, many students realize that liv
ing in a group need not be tantamount to
stifling the benefits which all agree can
be gained from it.
But these changes can only have been
outgrowths of another aspect of the pro
gram, ultimately the most essential one:
what have been the changes in the individ
ual student who goes overseas, who is
lifted from the Quad for six months, to
be sure with some peers along, but essen
tially deposited in a new environment
which demands more of him while remov
ing many familiar bases for determining
his own actions?
Another overseas returnee, faced with
this question, replied, "You can't just pin
it down like that." And for most "alumni,"
what has happened to them eventually be
comes recognizable, but is seldom easy to
articulate.
Not everyone who goes overseas comes
back mature, nor do those who elect not
to go consign themselves to immaturity.
The basic fact remains, however, that for
those who do go, the period overseas more
often than not becomes, in retrospect,
their maturing period, or at least the time
during which gestation of maturation be
gan. Returning students find the Weltan
schauung has markedly evolved.
They are possessed of an ability to com
municate sienificantlv more pasllv with
peers and with outsiders; they
have become much more aware
of the complexity of the human
community, and yet also of the
paradoxical similarities in all its
members.
They have witnessed the
effects of mental lassitude which
permit generalities about other
nationalities and emerged with
attentive respect to its pitfalls.
Friendship has assumed new
meaning in the sharing of things
totally new.
Study becomes an adjunct to
living in situations where one
can be more easily surrounded
by the pertinence of his aca
demic pursuit, where one has to
believe that people can really
speak that complicated langu
age. "Dating and study and go
ing out Friday night" are rele
gated in the proper perspective
to somewhat less than the trinity
of life at Stanford.

And not least, each student
has known people and cities and
landscape and customs of an
other country first hand and
been inevitably broadened by the
exposure.
It must be obvious that not
every student feels all these
things or brings the same ex
perience home with him: such an
asertion would be oversimplifi
cation. But most students over
seas do find their thoughts ad
mitting to similar ideas, even if
conscious acknowledgement to
the home campus can be an
emotional metamorphosis caused
by the virtual opening of one's
eyes to what is around him and
his attendant frustration at not
being physically or mentally
capable of doing it all justice.
The road to maturity is pitted
with "discouragement, disillus
ionment, and frustration," and
"deliverance, delight, and felic
ity," as Dean Napier has neatly
articulated some of our more im
portant emotions. The Overseas
Campuses Program has awak
ened many of us to the existence,
shape, and perhaps inevitability
of the first three of them as
forces with which we must cope.
More than any other vehicle
at Stanford, the Overseas Cam
puses have provided opportuni
ties and incentive for students
to enjoy, to think, to travel, to
study, to feel, to learn, and to
grow.
The Overseas Campuses Pro
gram, for some faults which it
may have, has changed many
hundreds of students' lives by
breaking down mental, social,
and cultural barriers.
Its contribution to undergrad
uate education encompasses
more than changed majors, or
revitalized living groups, or see
ing Europe; it is a miniature
renaissance in itself.

The freshman at Stanford in the middle

graduated.
He attended somewhat automatically
the almost weekly "all-campus reunions"
at Rudy's or Rossotti's, ID's were a farce,
and "Stanford-in-wherever" did not exist.
Some students lamented the lack of mean

International Campus
On what must now be one of the most in
ternationally minded campuses in this
country, scarcely a day will go by during
which each person does not talk and think
about events in the "outside" world or
read an article or letter in the Daily about
study overseas.
These are days of active concern on the
part of students; the "silent fifties" have
given way to a changed and energized
campus on which every other undergradu
ate has been or will be studying overseas.
The Overseas Campuses Program is not
responsible for all the transformations of
the past decade, but for those who knew
Stanford before its inception, the impact

of this unique educational venture has be
come particularly noteworthy.
It is a tribute to the innate vigor in the
University that the Overseas Campuses
Program was conceived in a period of rela
tive intelletcual calm. It began as an ex
periment involving 126 students each year,
and immediate, overriding success engen
dered its more permanent status as an
integral part of the University by which
802 undergraduates and some twenty fac
ulty members go to Europe annually.
In a very brief six years, the program
itself has changed in size and scope: a six
fold increase in students and from one
country to five. The fact remains, though,
that the undergraduate at Stanford,
whether overseas or not, regards the Over
seas Campuses as a fully constituent com
ponent of his University—a rather remark
able change in itself, since no one had any
inkling of such expansion at Stanford ten
years ago.
A glance at statistics comparing the
autumn quarters of 1959 and of this year
reveals a surprising trend. The undergrad
uate enrollment has increased 9.4 percent,
while the number of undergraduates ma
joring in the School of Humanities and
Sciences has risen by 29 percent.
The emphasis on the liberal arts is clear
—and a bit surprising in our age. Thus the
student's new orientation toward the out
side, toward life away from the campus,
has significantly altered the aacdemic pro
file of the entire University, and the Over
seas Campuses Program has both supple
mented and encouraged this development.
Today's Stanford undergraduate is much
more likely to have close friends outside
of his freshman house or corridor and his
present living group. The reason? If he
went overseas, he met many students from
other parts of campus whom he would
never have encountered otherwise.

More important, he grew to know them
and have more confidence in his ability to
relate easily to contemporaries of sharply
varying backgrounds.
Most important, many of these relation
ships continue after return from Europe.
And if the student coming back from over
seas has exerted any effort at all, he will
return having become closely acquainted
with professors and their families, the
strongest antidote to the toxic lack of asso
ciation between students and faculty.
These two major readjustments in the
circle of a student's friends and acquaint
ances have resulted in an unbelievable (for
the student of ten years ago) intensifica
tion and interatcion between members of
the Stanford community. The change has
obviously affected those who have not been
overseas as well.
Vigor And Elan
The edifying experience of living In a
Stanford group overseas has contributed
vigor and elan to the more sterile and life
less residential situation which prevailed
on the campus some years ago.
American collegiate "social pressure"
and custom in the abstract do not cease
to have relevance overseas, but as one stu
dent stated about the campus he attended,
"It was the only place where a guy could
ask a girl to borrow her car to go with
another girl."
Co-educational aspects of daily life are
not fettered by the traditional expectation
that any man-woman association must be
accompanied by dating or die.
Living at an overseas campus has also
left its mark on student's more frequent
attempts to evaluate their living groups
here intelligently. Efforts to make the resi
dential facet of the University commensur
ate with and directly supportive to the
learning on the academic side are fostered
and finally, many students realize that liv
ing in a group need not be tantamount to
stifling the benefits which all agree can
be gained from it.
But these changes can only have been
outgrowths of another aspect of the pro
gram, ultimately the most essential one:
what have been the changes in the individ
ual student who goes overseas, who is
lifted from the Quad for six months, to
be sure with some peers along, but essen
tially deposited in a new environment
which demands more of him while remov
ing many familiar bases for determining
his own actions?
Another overseas returnee, faced with
this question, replied, "You can't just pin
it down like that." And for most "alumni,"
what has happened to them eventually be
comes recognizable, but is seldom easy to
articulate.
Not everyone who goes overseas comes
back mature, nor do those who elect not
to go consign themselves to immaturity.
The basic fact remains, however, that for
those who do go, the period overseas more
often than not becomes, in retrospect,
their maturing period, or at least the time
during which gestation of maturation be
gan. Returning students find the Weltan

ships continue after return from Europe.
And if the student coming back from over
seas has exerted any effort at all, he will
return having become closely acquainted
with professors and their families, the
strongest antidote to the toxic lack of asso
ciation between students and faculty.
These two major readjustments in the
circle of a student's friends and acquaint
ances have resulted in an unbelievable (for
the student of ten years ago) intensifica
tion and interatcion between members of
the Stanford community. The change has
obviously affected those who have not been
overseas as well.
Vigor And Elan
The edifying experience of living In a
Stanford group overseas has contributed
vigor and elan to the more sterile and life
less residential situation which prevailed
on the campus some years ago.
American collegiate "social pressure"
and custom in the abstract do not cease
to have relevance overseas, but as one stu
dent stated about the campus he attended,
"It was the only place where a guy could
ask a girl to borrow her car to go with
another girl."
Co-educational aspects of daily life are
not fettered by the traditional expectation
that any man-woman association must be
accompanied by dating or die.
Living at an overseas campus has also
left its mark on student's more frequent
attempts to evaluate their living groups
here intelligently. Efforts to make the resi
dential facet of the University commensur
ate with and directly supportive to the
learning on the academic side are fostered
and finally, many students realize that liv
ing in a group need not be tantamount to
stifling the benefits which all agree can
be gained from it.
But these changes can only have been
outgrowths of another aspect of the pro
gram, ultimately the most essential one:
what have been the changes in the individ
ual student who goes overseas, who is
lifted from the Quad for six months, to
be sure with some peers along, but essen
tially deposited in a new environment
which demands more of him while remov
ing many familiar bases for determining
his own actions?
Another overseas returnee, faced with
this question, replied, "You can't just pin
it down like that." And for most "alumni,"
what has happened to them eventually be
comes recognizable, but is seldom easy to
articulate.
Not everyone who goes overseas comes
back mature, nor do those who elect not
to go consign themselves to immaturity.
The basic fact remains, however, that for
those who do go, the period overseas more
often than not becomes, in retrospect,
their maturing period, or at least the time
during which gestation of maturation be
gan. Returning students find the Weltan
schauung has markedly evolved.
They are possessed of an ability to com
municate sienificantlv more pasllv with
peers and with outsiders; they
have become much more aware
of the complexity of the human
community, and yet also of the
paradoxical similarities in all its
members.
They have witnessed the
effects of mental lassitude which
permit generalities about other
nationalities and emerged with
attentive respect to its pitfalls.
Friendship has assumed new
meaning in the sharing of things
totally new.
Study becomes an adjunct to
living in situations where one
can be more easily surrounded
by the pertinence of his aca
demic pursuit, where one has to
believe that people can really
speak that complicated langu
age. "Dating and study and go
ing out Friday night" are rele
gated in the proper perspective
to somewhat less than the trinity
of life at Stanford.

And not least, each student
has known people and cities and
landscape and customs of an
other country first hand and
been inevitably broadened by the
exposure.
It must be obvious that not
every student feels all these
things or brings the same ex
perience home with him: such an
asertion would be oversimplifi
cation. But most students over
seas do find their thoughts ad
mitting to similar ideas, even if
conscious acknowledgement to
the home campus can be an
emotional metamorphosis caused
by the virtual opening of one's
eyes to what is around him and
his attendant frustration at not
being physically or mentally
capable of doing it all justice.
The road to maturity is pitted
with "discouragement, disillus
ionment, and frustration," and
"deliverance, delight, and felic
ity," as Dean Napier has neatly
articulated some of our more im
portant emotions. The Overseas
Campuses Program has awak
ened many of us to the existence,
shape, and perhaps inevitability
of the first three of them as
forces with which we must cope.
More than any other vehicle
at Stanford, the Overseas Cam
puses have provided opportuni
ties and incentive for students
to enjoy, to think, to travel, to
study, to feel, to learn, and to
grow.
The Overseas Campuses Pro
gram, for some faults which it
may have, has changed many
hundreds of students' lives by
breaking down mental, social,
and cultural barriers.
Its contribution to undergrad
uate education encompasses
more than changed majors, or
revitalized living groups, or see
ing Europe; it is a miniature
renaissance in itself.

at Rudy's or Rossotti's, ID's were a farce,

International Campus
On what must now be one of the most in
ternationally minded campuses in this
country, scarcely a day will go by during
which each person does not talk and think
about events in the "outside" world or
read an article or letter in the Daily about
study overseas.
These are days of active concern on the
part of students; the "silent fifties" have
given way to a changed and energized
campus on which every other undergradu
ate has been or will be studying overseas.
The Overseas Campuses Program is not
responsible for all the transformations of
the past decade, but for those who knew
Stanford before its inception, the impact

of this unique educational venture has be
come particularly noteworthy.
It is a tribute to the innate vigor in the
University that the Overseas Campuses
Program was conceived in a period of rela
tive intelletcual calm. It began as an ex
periment involving 126 students each year,
and immediate, overriding success engen
dered its more permanent status as an
integral part of the University by which
802 undergraduates and some twenty fac
ulty members go to Europe annually.
In a very brief six years, the program
itself has changed in size and scope: a six
fold increase in students and from one
country to five. The fact remains, though,
that the undergraduate at Stanford,
whether overseas or not, regards the Over
seas Campuses as a fully constituent com
ponent of his University—a rather remark
able change in itself, since no one had any
inkling of such expansion at Stanford ten
years ago.
A glance at statistics comparing the
autumn quarters of 1959 and of this year
reveals a surprising trend. The undergrad
uate enrollment has increased 9.4 percent,
while the number of undergraduates ma
joring in the School of Humanities and
Sciences has risen by 29 percent.
The emphasis on the liberal arts is clear
—and a bit surprising in our age. Thus the
student's new orientation toward the out
side, toward life away from the campus,
has significantly altered the aacdemic pro
file of the entire University, and the Over
seas Campuses Program has both supple
mented and encouraged this development.
Today's Stanford undergraduate is much
more likely to have close friends outside
of his freshman house or corridor and his
present living group. The reason? If he
went overseas, he met many students from
other parts of campus whom he would
never have encountered otherwise.

More important, he grew to know them
and have more confidence in his ability to
relate easily to contemporaries of sharply
varying backgrounds.
Most important, many of these relation
ships continue after return from Europe.

ternationally minded campuses in this
country, scarcely a day will go by during
which each person does not talk and think
about events in the "outside" world or
read an article or letter in the Daily about
study overseas.
These are days of active concern on the
part of students; the "silent fifties" have
given way to a changed and energized
campus on which every other undergradu
ate has been or will be studying overseas.
The Overseas Campuses Program is not
responsible for all the transformations of
the past decade, but for those who knew
Stanford before its inception, the impact

of this unique educational venture has be
come particularly noteworthy.
It is a tribute to the innate vigor in the
University that the Overseas Campuses
Program was conceived in a period of rela
tive intelletcual calm. It began as an ex
periment involving 126 students each year,
and immediate, overriding success engen
dered its more permanent status as an
integral part of the University by which
802 undergraduates and some twenty fac
ulty members go to Europe annually.
In a very brief six years, the program
itself has changed in size and scope: a six
fold increase in students and from one
country to five. The fact remains, though,
that the undergraduate at Stanford,
whether overseas or not, regards the Over
seas Campuses as a fully constituent com
ponent of his University—a rather remark
able change in itself, since no one had any
inkling of such expansion at Stanford ten
years ago.
A glance at statistics comparing the
autumn quarters of 1959 and of this year
reveals a surprising trend. The undergrad
uate enrollment has increased 9.4 percent,
while the number of undergraduates ma
joring in the School of Humanities and
Sciences has risen by 29 percent.
The emphasis on the liberal arts is clear
—and a bit surprising in our age. Thus the
student's new orientation toward the out
side, toward life away from the campus,
has significantly altered the aacdemic pro
file of the entire University, and the Over
seas Campuses Program has both supple
mented and encouraged this development.
Today's Stanford undergraduate is much
more likely to have close friends outside
of his freshman house or corridor and his
present living group. The reason? If he
went overseas, he met many students from
other parts of campus whom he would
never have encountered otherwise.

More important, he grew to know them
and have more confidence in his ability to
relate easily to contemporaries of sharply
varying backgrounds.
Most important, many of these relation
ships continue after return from Europe.
And if the student coming back from over
seas has exerted any effort at all, he will
return having become closely acquainted
with professors and their families, the
strongest antidote to the toxic lack of asso
ciation between students and faculty.
These two major readjustments in the
circle of a student's friends and acquaint
ances have resulted in an unbelievable (for
the student of ten years ago) intensifica
tion and interatcion between members of
the Stanford community. The change has
obviously affected those who have not been
overseas as well.
Vigor And Elan
The edifying experience of living In a
Stanford group overseas has contributed
vigor and elan to the more sterile and life
less residential situation which prevailed
on the campus some years ago.
American collegiate "social pressure"
and custom in the abstract do not cease
to have relevance overseas, but as one stu
dent stated about the campus he attended,
"It was the only place where a guy could
ask a girl to borrow her car to go with
another girl."
Co-educational aspects of daily life are
not fettered by the traditional expectation
that any man-woman association must be
accompanied by dating or die.
Living at an overseas campus has also
left its mark on student's more frequent
attempts to evaluate their living groups
here intelligently. Efforts to make the resi
dential facet of the University commensur
ate with and directly supportive to the
learning on the academic side are fostered
and finally, many students realize that liv
ing in a group need not be tantamount to
stifling the benefits which all agree can
be gained from it.
But these changes can only have been
outgrowths of another aspect of the pro
gram, ultimately the most essential one:
what have been the changes in the individ
ual student who goes overseas, who is
lifted from the Quad for six months, to
be sure with some peers along, but essen
tially deposited in a new environment
which demands more of him while remov
ing many familiar bases for determining
his own actions?
Another overseas returnee, faced with
this question, replied, "You can't just pin
it down like that." And for most "alumni,"
what has happened to them eventually be
comes recognizable, but is seldom easy to
articulate.
Not everyone who goes overseas comes
back mature, nor do those who elect not
to go consign themselves to immaturity.
The basic fact remains, however, that for
those who do go, the period overseas more
often than not becomes, in retrospect,
their maturing period, or at least the time
during which gestation of maturation be
gan. Returning students find the Weltan
schauung has markedly evolved.
They are possessed of an ability to com
municate sienificantlv more pasllv with
peers and with outsiders; they
have become much more aware
of the complexity of the human
community, and yet also of the
paradoxical similarities in all its
members.
They have witnessed the
effects of mental lassitude which
permit generalities about other
nationalities and emerged with
attentive respect to its pitfalls.
Friendship has assumed new
meaning in the sharing of things
totally new.
Study becomes an adjunct to
living in situations where one
can be more easily surrounded
by the pertinence of his aca
demic pursuit, where one has to
believe that people can really
speak that complicated langu
age. "Dating and study and go
ing out Friday night" are rele
gated in the proper perspective
to somewhat less than the trinity
of life at Stanford.

And not least, each student
has known people and cities and
landscape and customs of an
other country first hand and
been inevitably broadened by the
exposure.
It must be obvious that not
every student feels all these
things or brings the same ex
perience home with him: such an
asertion would be oversimplifi
cation. But most students over
seas do find their thoughts ad
mitting to similar ideas, even if
conscious acknowledgement to
the home campus can be an
emotional metamorphosis caused
by the virtual opening of one's
eyes to what is around him and
his attendant frustration at not
being physically or mentally
capable of doing it all justice.
The road to maturity is pitted
with "discouragement, disillus
ionment, and frustration," and
"deliverance, delight, and felic
ity," as Dean Napier has neatly
articulated some of our more im
portant emotions. The Overseas
Campuses Program has awak
ened many of us to the existence,
shape, and perhaps inevitability
of the first three of them as
forces with which we must cope.
More than any other vehicle
at Stanford, the Overseas Cam
puses have provided opportuni
ties and incentive for students
to enjoy, to think, to travel, to
study, to feel, to learn, and to
grow.
The Overseas Campuses Pro
gram, for some faults which it
may have, has changed many
hundreds of students' lives by
breaking down mental, social,
and cultural barriers.
Its contribution to undergrad
uate education encompasses
more than changed majors, or
revitalized living groups, or see
ing Europe; it is a miniature
renaissance in itself.
Editor's note: Mr. Hamrdla Is the
Assistant to the Director of the Over

member of Germany II and has since

The freshman at Stanford in the middle
fifties went through pre-reg week, com

planned courses, studied four years, and
graduated.
He attended somewhat automatically
the almost weekly "all-campus reunions"
at Rudy's or Rossotti's, ID's were a farce,
and "Stanford-in-wherever" did not exist.
Some students lamented the lack of mean
ingful intellectual atmosphere, but not
many really cared.
The freshman who came to Stanford two
months ago cannot realize how much
greater are the opportunities for an edu
cation full of solid content, for participa
tion in a vital campus life offering cultural
and intellectual events too numerous to
mention—or to attend.

It must be obvious that not
every student feels all these
things or brings the same ex
perience home with him: such an
asertion would be oversimplifi
cation. But most students over
seas do find their thoughts ad
mitting to similar ideas, even if
conscious acknowledgement to
the home campus can be an
emotional metamorphosis caused
by the virtual opening of one's
eyes to what is around him and
his attendant frustration at not
being physically or mentally
capable of doing it all justice.
The road to maturity is pitted
with "discouragement, disillus
ionment, and frustration," and
"deliverance, delight, and felic
ity," as Dean Napier has neatly
articulated some of our more im
portant emotions. The Overseas
Campuses Program has awak
ened many of us to the existence,
shape, and perhaps inevitability
of the first three of them as
forces with which we must cope.
More than any other vehicle
at Stanford, the Overseas Cam
puses have provided opportuni
ties and incentive for students
to enjoy, to think, to travel, to
study, to feel, to learn, and to
grow.
The Overseas Campuses Pro
gram, for some faults which it
may have, has changed many
hundreds of students' lives by
breaking down mental, social,
and cultural barriers.
Its contribution to undergrad
uate education encompasses
more than changed majors, or
revitalized living groups, or see
ing Europe; it is a miniature
renaissance in itself.
