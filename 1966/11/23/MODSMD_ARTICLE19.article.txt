# OVERSEAS PROGRAM
## Faculty Analysis Similar To Students' 
### KIRK HANEN Associate Editor 
Much has been said about student life
and attitudes toward the Overseas Pro
gram, but the Overseas Campus professor
can be just as vocal in praise and criticism.
The consensus is often the same—the
reasons are, as expected, frequently differ
ent.
Most agree that the Overseas program
provided possibly the best chance they will
ever get to acquaint themselves with a
group of students.
'Trailblazer'
As George Knoles, a trailblazing veteran
of England I, and France I and VII, puts
it,"It may not be impossible at Stanford
to really get to know a large body of stu
dents, but it doesn't seem to happen.
"There's no one in my three groups that
I don't know as a person. These people are
real people to me, not just names. You see
them under stresses and strains that you
wouldn't even have a chance to notice at
Stanford. This is what was most important
to me."
William L. Rivers, professor of Com
munication and former Washington cor
respondent, who just returned from two
quarters in Stuttgart, Germany, feels that
"almost anyone going overseas will find
himself doing less work — particularly
less writing of papers."
"This may be peculiar to my classes,
though", Rivers adds.
"I liked the German campus precisely
because it is a campus—there are four or
five buildings instead of just one."
Closer To Students
For Religion professor Edwin M. Good,
six months in Germany provided an oppor
tunity to get to know students that just
isn't found at Stanford.
"Just the business of being there of
being "on tap" all the time—was exhaust
ing, though."
"It was enjoyable, but it was no vacation.
I had to work. I had two new courses to
prepare. There were no readers, so I had
to read all the papers myself.
As much as each of the three benefitted
from and enjoyed their Overseas experi
ence, they all saw room for change in the
present system.
Knoles doubts that the Overseas Cam
pus experience is for everyone. "It's just
not designed for those who want to be
come specialists in the country they visit.
After all, this is a General Studies pro
gram—there are other, better ways of im
mersing oneself in a culture.

"I wouldn't want to bar the student who
has travelled extensively in Europe, but I
think he gets less out of his investment in
time than someone who has never been
out of Los Altos."
Enthusiastic
"Don't get me wrong, though. I'm not
one of the Young Turks in the current re
action toward the Overseas program. I'm
really very enthusiastic about it."
Stressing the need for increased infor
mality, Rivers says that he would "relax
the rules about travel," referring especi
ally to the three-day weekends, which
many feel cause excessive haste on the
part of the traveller. "And, I'd particularly
try to make sure that the course material
is Europe-oriented."
Rivers himself put the principle into
practice. He will include at least four
papers done by his students overseas in his
forthcoming anthology for Harper and

Row, The Adversaries: Politics And The
Press. In the project, Rivers stressed first
hand interviews with German politicians
and journalists. He regrets space limita
tions since at least a dozen were "eminently
publishable."
Good found that some of his students in
Germany weren't properly prepared for
the overseas stay. "I would try to persuade
people to take a more coherent apporach
to the whole Overseas program. I think
they ought to place emphasis on 'country'
rather than on 'Europe.' This notion seems
to enter few minds, though."
Wants To Return
Would he care to go back again?
"Definitely," Good said. "I'd love to re
turn to Germany. When we were there
with Germany XIII and XIV my children
had a tremendous opportunity to attend
the local school. They were at an age
when they could really absorb the lan
guage.' '


An audience with the Pope Is a traditional part of every Rome field trip. But only the Germany II group received a private audience
(above) with Pope .John XXIII. (Twenty-fifth from the right is Bob Hamrdla, who's come a long way« and lost a little hair since this
picture. He's presently Assistant Director of the Overseas Program.)
