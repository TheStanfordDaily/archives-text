# Dean Lyman To Assume Provost's Post
## 
### JIM SELNA Editor 
President Wallace Sterling yester
day announced the appointment of
Professor Richard W. Lyman to the
post of Vice-President and Provost.
The Provost, second ranking Uni
versity officer and chief academic of
ficer under the president is responsible
for academic budgets .student services,
the libraries, and all schools except
medicine.
Lyman, currently Associate Dean of
Humanities and Sciences, succeeds
Frederick Terman who retired in 1965.
He will assume his new duties with
the beginning of winter quarter.
Vice-Provost
Sterling also announced the ap
pointment of Herbert L. Packer, pro
fessor of law, as Vice-Provost for
Academic Planning. Packer, one of

the nation's leading criminologists,
will serve with E. Howard Brooks
who was named Vice-Provost for Aca
demic Operations earlier in the year.
In a Daily interview, Lyman said he
was "enormously complimented," by
the appointment and somewhat awed
by his new responsibilities.
In light of the general reappraisal
of Stanford education, Lyman viewed
the filling of the long vacant provost
post as timely. "We will be able to
give the study more careful and sus
tained attention," he noted.
No Importance
Lyman said Packer would be a
working member of the study com
mittee.
The new provost attached no spe
cial importance to the fact that he
comes from the humanities in contrast
to his predecessor, a professor of elec

trical engineering. Lyman noted the
strength of the sciences and social
sciences which grew during Terman's
tenure. Although he acknowledged the
lag in the humanities which national
surveys have underscored, he at
tributed this to a lack of federal
funds available to support the hu
manities.
"In humanities we have some build
ing to do but the way to build a Uni
versity is not to cut back where you
are strong," he said.
Asked if he viewed the appointment
as a caretaker assignment, Lyman re
plied, "A University like Stanford can
not wait. It cannot leave blanks in the
top leadership."
Plenty of Work
In his new position Lyman said he
would be looking far ahead for the
University. He said, "I will have
plenty of work to do without worry
ing about my personal future. And
this University is an exciting place
to be working for."
Packer, who will assume responsi
bility for long range planning, will
play an "integrative role" with the
University as a whole being his main
concern.
Lyman caDed Packer a "one-man
brain trust" in praising the ability of
the new Vice-Provost.
Essential Job
Lyman also had praise for E.
Howard Brooks who has been serving
as Vice-Provost since September. "He
has been doing a tremendously essen
tial job, and I will be relying upon
him heavily in the future."
Lyman came to Stanford in 1958 as
Associate Professor of history, and
in 1964 was named Associate Dean of
Humanities and Sciences. He is chair
man of the President's Advisory Com
mittee on Religious Affairs, and is
also a member of the Committee on
Undergraduate Education.
Having done his undergraduate
work at Swathmore, Lyman took his
doctorate at Harvard in modern Eng
lish history. His published works in
clude, The First Labor Government

and Major Crises in Western-Civiliza
tion, which he co-edited.
Packer is currently a member of
the Executive Committee of the Aca
demic Council. He earned his bachelor
and law degrees at Yale University.
