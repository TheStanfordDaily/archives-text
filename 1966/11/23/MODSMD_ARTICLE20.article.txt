# O.C. Board Attempts Constructive Criticism
## 
### DAVE HAKKEN Germany XVI 
Student criticism of the Over
seas Campus Program often
seems ineffective. The attitude
expressed by the overseas cam
pus office — to "wait and see"
concerning the location of the
Austrian campus—leads many
students to think that criticism
of the location, like many other
criticisms, will be ignored.
Criticism of the Overseas Cam
pus Program has on occasion,
however, led to constructive in
quiry into the structure of the
program and this inquiry has re
sulted in significant changes.
Nevertheless, there has been a
noticeable lack of constructive
communication between the
Overseas Campus Office and
students critical of the Overseas
Campus Program.

The Overseas Campus Board,
an organization of alumni from
all the overseas campuses, has
expressed a desire over the past
two years to facilitate this com
munication by acting as a gath
ering point for constructive stu
dent criticism, and directing it
effectively to the Overseas Cam
pus Office, as well as assisting
the office in explaining to stu
dents the nature of its decisions.
The apparent inability of the
Board to do this effectively is
partly a result of poor communi
cation between the members of
the board and students and pro
fessors critical of the overseas
campus program.
The Board is presently estab
lishing committees to consider
specific problems within the pro
gram such as the location of the
Austrian campus, antiquated
judicial procedures at overseas
campuses, hostels, and the bias
toward rural locations presently
asumed by the overseas campus
office.
Membership in these commit
tees is to include interested mem
bers of the Stanford community
who are not members of the
board.
It is the hope of the Board
that interested students would
express their opinions through
the file in the overseas campus
office or in the open meetings
of the Board.
The Overseas Campus Pro
gram is generally accepted by
the student body and yet it is
also the center of much criticism.
Through the reorganization of
its structure, the Overseas Cam
pus Board hopes to facilitate the
transmission of this criticism in
a meaningful way.
