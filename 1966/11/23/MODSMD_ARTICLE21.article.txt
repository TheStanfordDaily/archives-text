# STANFORD IN BRITAIN
## Britain: No Language Barrier Makes A World Of Difference 
### HENRY MULLER BRITAIN I 
Despite rumors to the contrary,
there is no language barrier at
Harlaxton Manor.
This unique factor has enabled
students at Stanford in Britain
to have more contact with the
native culture and population
than most of those studying at
the other campuses. In addition,
the rural setting and the ex
ceptional hospitality of the Brit
ish people have made it easier
for students to get out of Aemri
ca's little island.
The philosophy of having a
campus in England is often ques
tioned. Why have a campus
there if you can't learn a foreign
language?
The answer points to one of
the often neglected aspects of
the "European experience" of
fered by Stanford. It is as true
of the other campuses that one
of the benefits of going over
seas lies in the opportunity to
absorb a culture different from
the one the student has been
raised in.
Different Values
Being abroad exposes the stu
dent to laws, customs, and philo
sophies — in short, to a set of
values — that he is not ac
quainted with. Particularly in
Britain, this becomes a valuable
experience because so much that
is American has its roots in
Great Britain.
Harlaxton Manor is just out
side of Grantham, conveniently
situated on the main north-south
highway and train line. The 115
miles to London takes an hour
and 45 minutes by train and
about two and half hours by
car.
Grantham itself is not a very
exciting town. It is located on
the border between the indus
trial East Midlands and the ag
ricultural county of Lincoln
shire. Its population of 20,000
consists mostly of factory work
ers, clerks, and small business
men. Grantham has a high ratio
of pubs to population, although
most students ended up prefer
ring the atmosphere of the num
erous country pubs in the area.
Harlaxton Village
Much of the contact between
Stanford students and the Bri
tish people was through acquain
tances in Harlaxton village, lo
cated approximately one mile
from the Manor. Except for two
small stores, the village has no
businesses or industries: most of
its 200 inhabitants work either
in Grantham or in the fields
nearby.
Contact with students from
local universities is not as ex
tensive as would be desirable.

An effort is made by inviting
Englishmen from the nearby
Universities of Nottingham and
Leicester to attend various func
tions at the Manor, such as
parties or concerts, but Stan
ford's short academic week and
the numerous demands upon
most students' time prevent
them from pursuing any ac
quaintances very extensively.
The academic program at
Stanford in Britain each quarter
consists of two 4-unit courses
taught by the Stanford profes
sors in residence at the Manor
and two courses taught by visit
ing lecturers from the Univer
sities of Nottingham and Lei
cester. One, entitled "British
Civilization," is a quick survey
of British literature, art, politics,
music, and architecture.
Technology Course
The other, replacing the
usual intensive language courses
at other campuses, concentrates
on the social and governmental
implications of technology, with
a specific emphasis the second
quarter on current political
events and economic policies.
The topics covered by the two
Stanford professors depends on
their respective fields, although
they generally attempt to relate
the course to Britain. In Britain
111, for instance, Professor Ro
bert Horn of the Political Science
department will teach a course
entitled "The American Consti
tution and its British Antece
dents."
As at the other campuses, the
academic week is four days long.
This allows the students to
spend the remaining three days
either pursuing local contacts or
traveling around the country.
Occasionally, they also use the
weekends to catch up on some
studying.
Crossing the channel, especial
ly with an automobile, is such a
major undertaking that students
find they can only travel within
Britain over weekends. This has
its advantages, for it allows
them to become much more
thoroughly familiar with Britain,
which, after all, is the country
they are living in for six months.
TTiere is a break of approxi
mately 24 days between quarters
during which students are free
to explore the continent on their
own. In addition, there is a one
week field trip each quarter in
which all students are taken to
a city of major interest. The uni
versity tried to make the trip as
"educational" as possible by pro
viding guides and tours, al
though leaving the students
plenty of time to look around
themselves.
The Manor itself is not a

palace or castle, as photographs
of the exterior might indicate.
Students familiarly refer to its
architecture as "neo-grotesque."
It is actually 19th century gothic
in style and pre-Victorian in
execution.
The inside offers striking con
trasts in comfort and luxury.
A typical example is the lecture
hall, which was originally built
as a ballroom and was trans
formed into a chapel when the
Jesuits bought the Manor after
the last war. The chandelier in it
may well be worth $15,000 but
students still go blind on an
overcast day and the wooden
pews with their vertical backs
cannot be said to be as comfort
able as the soft seats students
are accustomed to on Quad.
The student living area used
to be the servants' quarters. The
men live in large rooms holding
from two to six persons, but
manage to get some privacy, be
cause each has his own six-by
eight "cubicle," with walls that
do not reach the ceiling and
without doors. The differ only
from toilet stalls in that they are
a bit larger.
But then again, the student
who is principally interested in
comfortable quarters might as
well stay in Stern Hall or in his
fraternity cluster house.
The Manor is also a museum.
It houses many paintings, sculp
tures, and other works of art,
as well as architectural and land
scaping features that would a
rouse envy from many a curator.
Hide and Go Seek
It is probably large enough
to house two Stanford groups at
the same time, and the chances
are they would never have to
run into each other. The size of
the Manor was often the source
of some embarrassment to the
administration, for they could
never keep track of all the ways
to get to the women's quarters.
Even within the Manor, stu
dents cannot escape Britain. The
student bar offers several va
rieties of English ale and one
of the favorite pastimes on
"study nights" consists of watch
ing local rock and roll bands per
form on the "telly."
Harlaxton Manor is not known
for its cuisine, but then neither
is England. If Stanford were to
provide better meals for its stu
dents in Britain, this would cut
deeply into the business of the
prosperous Chinese restaurants
in Grantham.
The opportunity to become
thoroughly acquainted with the
country certainly exists for the
students at Stanford in Britain.
Whether they do or not is a
measure of their initiative. Eng
land is there.

of British literature, art, politics,
music, and architecture.
Technology Course
The other, replacing the
usual intensive language courses
at other campuses, concentrates
on the social and governmental
implications of technology, with
a specific emphasis the second
quarter on current political
events and economic policies.
The topics covered by the two
Stanford professors depends on
their respective fields, although
they generally attempt to relate
the course to Britain. In Britain
111, for instance, Professor Ro
bert Horn of the Political Science
department will teach a course
entitled "The American Consti
tution and its British Antece
dents."
As at the other campuses, the
academic week is four days long.
This allows the students to
spend the remaining three days
either pursuing local contacts or
traveling around the country.
Occasionally, they also use the
weekends to catch up on some
studying.
Crossing the channel, especial
ly with an automobile, is such a
major undertaking that students
find they can only travel within
Britain over weekends. This has
its advantages, for it allows
them to become much more
thoroughly familiar with Britain,
which, after all, is the country
they are living in for six months.
TTiere is a break of approxi
mately 24 days between quarters
during which students are free
to explore the continent on their
own. In addition, there is a one
week field trip each quarter in
which all students are taken to
a city of major interest. The uni
versity tried to make the trip as
"educational" as possible by pro
viding guides and tours, al
though leaving the students
plenty of time to look around
themselves.
The Manor itself is not a

palace or castle, as photographs
of the exterior might indicate.
Students familiarly refer to its
architecture as "neo-grotesque."
It is actually 19th century gothic
in style and pre-Victorian in
execution.
The inside offers striking con
trasts in comfort and luxury.
A typical example is the lecture
hall, which was originally built
as a ballroom and was trans
formed into a chapel when the
Jesuits bought the Manor after
the last war. The chandelier in it
may well be worth $15,000 but
students still go blind on an
overcast day and the wooden
pews with their vertical backs
cannot be said to be as comfort
able as the soft seats students
are accustomed to on Quad.
The student living area used
to be the servants' quarters. The
men live in large rooms holding
from two to six persons, but
manage to get some privacy, be
cause each has his own six-by
eight "cubicle," with walls that
do not reach the ceiling and
without doors. The differ only
from toilet stalls in that they are
a bit larger.
But then again, the student
who is principally interested in
comfortable quarters might as
well stay in Stern Hall or in his
fraternity cluster house.
The Manor is also a museum.
It houses many paintings, sculp
tures, and other works of art,
as well as architectural and land
scaping features that would a
rouse envy from many a curator.
Hide and Go Seek
It is probably large enough
to house two Stanford groups at
the same time, and the chances
are they would never have to
run into each other. The size of
the Manor was often the source
of some embarrassment to the
administration, for they could
never keep track of all the ways
to get to the women's quarters.
Even within the Manor, stu
dents cannot escape Britain. The
student bar offers several va
rieties of English ale and one
of the favorite pastimes on
"study nights" consists of watch
ing local rock and roll bands per
form on the "telly."
Harlaxton Manor is not known
for its cuisine, but then neither
is England. If Stanford were to
provide better meals for its stu
dents in Britain, this would cut
deeply into the business of the
prosperous Chinese restaurants
in Grantham.
The opportunity to become
thoroughly acquainted with the
country certainly exists for the
students at Stanford in Britain.
Whether they do or not is a
measure of their initiative. Eng
land is there.


HARLAXTON MANOR
Despite rumors to the contrary,
there is no language barrier at
Harlaxton Manor.
This unique factor has enabled
students at Stanford in Britain
to have more contact with the
native culture and population
than most of those studying at
the other campuses. In addition,
the rural setting and the ex
ceptional hospitality of the Brit
ish people have made it easier
for students to get out of Aemri
ca's little island.
The philosophy of having a
campus in England is often ques
tioned. Why have a campus
there if you can't learn a foreign
language?
The answer points to one of
the often neglected aspects of
the "European experience" of
fered by Stanford. It is as true
of the other campuses that one
of the benefits of going over
seas lies in the opportunity to
absorb a culture different from
the one the student has been
raised in.
Different Values
Being abroad exposes the stu
dent to laws, customs, and philo
sophies — in short, to a set of
values — that he is not ac
quainted with. Particularly in
Britain, this becomes a valuable
experience because so much that
is American has its roots in
Great Britain.
Harlaxton Manor is just out
side of Grantham, conveniently
situated on the main north-south
highway and train line. The 115
miles to London takes an hour
and 45 minutes by train and
about two and half hours by
car.
Grantham itself is not a very
exciting town. It is located on
the border between the indus
trial East Midlands and the ag
ricultural county of Lincoln
shire. Its population of 20,000
consists mostly of factory work
ers, clerks, and small business
men. Grantham has a high ratio
of pubs to population, although
most students ended up prefer
ring the atmosphere of the num
erous country pubs in the area.
Harlaxton Village
Much of the contact between
Stanford students and the Bri
tish people was through acquain
tances in Harlaxton village, lo
cated approximately one mile
from the Manor. Except for two
small stores, the village has no
businesses or industries: most of
its 200 inhabitants work either
in Grantham or in the fields
nearby.
Contact with students from
local universities is not as ex
tensive as would be desirable.

An effort is made by inviting
Englishmen from the nearby
Universities of Nottingham and
Leicester to attend various func
tions at the Manor, such as
parties or concerts, but Stan
ford's short academic week and
the numerous demands upon
most students' time prevent
them from pursuing any ac
quaintances very extensively.
The academic program at
Stanford in Britain each quarter
consists of two 4-unit courses
taught by the Stanford profes
sors in residence at the Manor
and two courses taught by visit
ing lecturers from the Univer
sities of Nottingham and Lei
cester. One, entitled "British
Civilization," is a quick survey
of British literature, art, politics,
music, and architecture.

as well as architectural and land
scaping features that would a
rouse envy from many a curator.
Hide and Go Seek
It is probably large enough
to house two Stanford groups at
the same time, and the chances
are they would never have to
run into each other. The size of
the Manor was often the source
of some embarrassment to the
administration, for they could
never keep track of all the ways
to get to the women's quarters.
Even within the Manor, stu
dents cannot escape Britain. The
student bar offers several va
rieties of English ale and one
of the favorite pastimes on
"study nights" consists of watch
ing local rock and roll bands per
form on the "telly."
Harlaxton Manor is not known
for its cuisine, but then neither
is England. If Stanford were to
provide better meals for its stu
dents in Britain, this would cut
deeply into the business of the
prosperous Chinese restaurants
in Grantham.
The opportunity to become
thoroughly acquainted with the
country certainly exists for the
students at Stanford in Britain.
Whether they do or not is a
measure of their initiative. Eng
land is there.


HARLAXTON MANOR
Despite rumors to the contrary,
there is no language barrier at
Harlaxton Manor.
This unique factor has enabled
students at Stanford in Britain
to have more contact with the
native culture and population
than most of those studying at
the other campuses. In addition,
the rural setting and the ex
ceptional hospitality of the Brit
ish people have made it easier
for students to get out of Aemri
ca's little island.
The philosophy of having a
campus in England is often ques
tioned. Why have a campus
there if you can't learn a foreign
language?
The answer points to one of
the often neglected aspects of
the "European experience" of
fered by Stanford. It is as true
of the other campuses that one
of the benefits of going over
seas lies in the opportunity to
absorb a culture different from
the one the student has been
raised in.
Different Values
Being abroad exposes the stu
dent to laws, customs, and philo
sophies — in short, to a set of
values — that he is not ac
quainted with. Particularly in
Britain, this becomes a valuable
experience because so much that
is American has its roots in
Great Britain.
Harlaxton Manor is just out
side of Grantham, conveniently
situated on the main north-south
highway and train line. The 115
miles to London takes an hour
and 45 minutes by train and
about two and half hours by
car.
Grantham itself is not a very
exciting town. It is located on
the border between the indus
trial East Midlands and the ag
ricultural county of Lincoln
shire. Its population of 20,000
consists mostly of factory work
ers, clerks, and small business
men. Grantham has a high ratio
of pubs to population, although
most students ended up prefer
ring the atmosphere of the num
erous country pubs in the area.
Harlaxton Village
Much of the contact between
Stanford students and the Bri
tish people was through acquain
tances in Harlaxton village, lo
cated approximately one mile
from the Manor. Except for two
small stores, the village has no
businesses or industries: most of
its 200 inhabitants work either
in Grantham or in the fields
nearby.
Contact with students from
local universities is not as ex
tensive as would be desirable.

An effort is made by inviting
Englishmen from the nearby
Universities of Nottingham and
Leicester to attend various func
tions at the Manor, such as
parties or concerts, but Stan
ford's short academic week and
the numerous demands upon
most students' time prevent
them from pursuing any ac
quaintances very extensively.
The academic program at
Stanford in Britain each quarter
consists of two 4-unit courses
taught by the Stanford profes
sors in residence at the Manor
and two courses taught by visit
ing lecturers from the Univer
sities of Nottingham and Lei
cester. One, entitled "British
Civilization," is a quick survey
of British literature, art, politics,
music, and architecture.
Technology Course
The other, replacing the
usual intensive language courses
at other campuses, concentrates
on the social and governmental
implications of technology, with
a specific emphasis the second
quarter on current political
events and economic policies.
The topics covered by the two
Stanford professors depends on
their respective fields, although
they generally attempt to relate
the course to Britain. In Britain
111, for instance, Professor Ro
bert Horn of the Political Science
department will teach a course
entitled "The American Consti
tution and its British Antece
dents."
As at the other campuses, the
academic week is four days long.
This allows the students to
spend the remaining three days
either pursuing local contacts or
traveling around the country.
Occasionally, they also use the
weekends to catch up on some
studying.
Crossing the channel, especial
ly with an automobile, is such a
major undertaking that students
find they can only travel within
Britain over weekends. This has
its advantages, for it allows
them to become much more
thoroughly familiar with Britain,
which, after all, is the country
they are living in for six months.
TTiere is a break of approxi
mately 24 days between quarters
during which students are free
to explore the continent on their
own. In addition, there is a one
week field trip each quarter in
which all students are taken to
a city of major interest. The uni
versity tried to make the trip as
"educational" as possible by pro
viding guides and tours, al
though leaving the students
plenty of time to look around
themselves.
The Manor itself is not a

palace or castle, as photographs
of the exterior might indicate.
Students familiarly refer to its
architecture as "neo-grotesque."
It is actually 19th century gothic
in style and pre-Victorian in
execution.
The inside offers striking con
trasts in comfort and luxury.
A typical example is the lecture
hall, which was originally built
as a ballroom and was trans
formed into a chapel when the
Jesuits bought the Manor after
the last war. The chandelier in it
may well be worth $15,000 but
students still go blind on an
overcast day and the wooden
pews with their vertical backs
cannot be said to be as comfort
able as the soft seats students
are accustomed to on Quad.
The student living area used
to be the servants' quarters. The
men live in large rooms holding
from two to six persons, but
manage to get some privacy, be
cause each has his own six-by
eight "cubicle," with walls that
do not reach the ceiling and
without doors. The differ only
from toilet stalls in that they are
a bit larger.
But then again, the student
who is principally interested in
comfortable quarters might as
well stay in Stern Hall or in his
fraternity cluster house.
The Manor is also a museum.
It houses many paintings, sculp
tures, and other works of art,
as well as architectural and land
scaping features that would a
rouse envy from many a curator.

ring the atmosphere of the num
erous country pubs in the area.
Harlaxton Village
Much of the contact between
Stanford students and the Bri
tish people was through acquain
tances in Harlaxton village, lo
cated approximately one mile
from the Manor. Except for two
small stores, the village has no
businesses or industries: most of
its 200 inhabitants work either
in Grantham or in the fields
nearby.
Contact with students from
local universities is not as ex
tensive as would be desirable.

An effort is made by inviting
Englishmen from the nearby
Universities of Nottingham and
Leicester to attend various func
tions at the Manor, such as
parties or concerts, but Stan
ford's short academic week and
the numerous demands upon
most students' time prevent
them from pursuing any ac
quaintances very extensively.
The academic program at
Stanford in Britain each quarter
consists of two 4-unit courses
taught by the Stanford profes
sors in residence at the Manor
and two courses taught by visit
ing lecturers from the Univer
sities of Nottingham and Lei
cester. One, entitled "British
Civilization," is a quick survey
of British literature, art, politics,
music, and architecture.
Technology Course
The other, replacing the
usual intensive language courses
at other campuses, concentrates
on the social and governmental
implications of technology, with
a specific emphasis the second
quarter on current political
events and economic policies.
The topics covered by the two
Stanford professors depends on
their respective fields, although
they generally attempt to relate
the course to Britain. In Britain
111, for instance, Professor Ro
bert Horn of the Political Science
department will teach a course
entitled "The American Consti
tution and its British Antece
dents."
As at the other campuses, the
academic week is four days long.
This allows the students to
spend the remaining three days
either pursuing local contacts or
traveling around the country.
Occasionally, they also use the
weekends to catch up on some
studying.
Crossing the channel, especial
ly with an automobile, is such a
major undertaking that students
find they can only travel within
Britain over weekends. This has
its advantages, for it allows
them to become much more
thoroughly familiar with Britain,
which, after all, is the country
they are living in for six months.
TTiere is a break of approxi
mately 24 days between quarters
during which students are free
to explore the continent on their
own. In addition, there is a one
week field trip each quarter in
which all students are taken to
a city of major interest. The uni
versity tried to make the trip as
"educational" as possible by pro
viding guides and tours, al
though leaving the students
plenty of time to look around
themselves.
The Manor itself is not a

palace or castle, as photographs
of the exterior might indicate.
Students familiarly refer to its
architecture as "neo-grotesque."
It is actually 19th century gothic
in style and pre-Victorian in
execution.
The inside offers striking con
trasts in comfort and luxury.
A typical example is the lecture
hall, which was originally built
as a ballroom and was trans
formed into a chapel when the
Jesuits bought the Manor after
the last war. The chandelier in it
may well be worth $15,000 but
students still go blind on an
overcast day and the wooden
pews with their vertical backs
cannot be said to be as comfort
able as the soft seats students
are accustomed to on Quad.
The student living area used
to be the servants' quarters. The
men live in large rooms holding
from two to six persons, but
manage to get some privacy, be
cause each has his own six-by
eight "cubicle," with walls that
do not reach the ceiling and
without doors. The differ only
from toilet stalls in that they are
a bit larger.
But then again, the student
who is principally interested in
comfortable quarters might as
well stay in Stern Hall or in his
fraternity cluster house.
The Manor is also a museum.
It houses many paintings, sculp
tures, and other works of art,
as well as architectural and land
scaping features that would a
rouse envy from many a curator.
Hide and Go Seek
It is probably large enough
to house two Stanford groups at
the same time, and the chances
are they would never have to
run into each other. The size of
the Manor was often the source
of some embarrassment to the
administration, for they could
never keep track of all the ways
to get to the women's quarters.
Even within the Manor, stu
dents cannot escape Britain. The
student bar offers several va
rieties of English ale and one
of the favorite pastimes on
"study nights" consists of watch
ing local rock and roll bands per
form on the "telly."
Harlaxton Manor is not known
for its cuisine, but then neither
is England. If Stanford were to
provide better meals for its stu
dents in Britain, this would cut
deeply into the business of the
prosperous Chinese restaurants
in Grantham.
The opportunity to become
thoroughly acquainted with the
country certainly exists for the
students at Stanford in Britain.
Whether they do or not is a
measure of their initiative. Eng
land is there.


HARLAXTON MANOR
Despite rumors to the contrary,
there is no language barrier at
Harlaxton Manor.
This unique factor has enabled
students at Stanford in Britain
to have more contact with the
native culture and population
than most of those studying at
the other campuses. In addition,
the rural setting and the ex
ceptional hospitality of the Brit
ish people have made it easier
for students to get out of Aemri
ca's little island.
The philosophy of having a
campus in England is often ques
tioned. Why have a campus
there if you can't learn a foreign
language?
The answer points to one of
the often neglected aspects of
the "European experience" of
fered by Stanford. It is as true
of the other campuses that one
of the benefits of going over
seas lies in the opportunity to
absorb a culture different from
the one the student has been
raised in.
Different Values
Being abroad exposes the stu
dent to laws, customs, and philo
sophies — in short, to a set of
values — that he is not ac
quainted with. Particularly in
Britain, this becomes a valuable
experience because so much that
is American has its roots in
Great Britain.
Harlaxton Manor is just out
side of Grantham, conveniently
situated on the main north-south
highway and train line. The 115
miles to London takes an hour
and 45 minutes by train and
about two and half hours by
car.
Grantham itself is not a very
exciting town. It is located on
the border between the indus
trial East Midlands and the ag
ricultural county of Lincoln
shire. Its population of 20,000
consists mostly of factory work
ers, clerks, and small business
men. Grantham has a high ratio
of pubs to population, although
most students ended up prefer
ring the atmosphere of the num
erous country pubs in the area.
