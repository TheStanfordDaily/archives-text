# THE 						FRENCH EXPERIENCE
## Burden Of Enjoyment Rests With The Student 
### CRAIG LUBBOCK France IX 
You can lead a horse to
water, but you cannot
make him drink.
And at Stanford in France
no one forces you to drink.
The student is thrust into what
is initially a hostile environment.
He can react by refusing to leave
the security of the campus
where everyone plays at being
French, but is still American.
Here he becomes bogged down
in administrative redtape and
in the physical limitations of the
campus.
Or he can gather his courage,
fight-off the anxiety of isolation,
and plunge into the fray of
Monoprix (a department store)
on a Saturday looking for a
special plug for an electric razor
or a bar of soap. The first falter
ing word is the hardest, and if
the student can beat discourage
ment, it's all downhill from
there.
French Families
The administration has done
a remarkable job in smoothing
the entrance into the foreign en
vironment. Most successful has
been the effort to breakdown the
social barriers which character
ize the exclusiveness of the
French family.
Not only is there an opportu
nity to enter the French home;
there is also an active encour
agement of contacts with the
French students in Tours. While
much criticism has centered on
the relatively younger age of
the French students, meaning
ful experiences can be had. And,
of course, the language gap
diminishes.
Probably the weakest point in
the Tours arrangement is the
general introduction or orienta
tion as presented in the French
Civilization course, but the ad
ministration has taken steps to
stimulate the program. Speci
fically, organization and prep
aration for field trips has been
superb, and for this, the Tours
administration is to be compli
mented.
Campus Philosophy
The philosophy of the campus
is to provide the student with
unlimited opportunities for ex
posure to French life, history,

and culture, but the essence of
the overseas experience is in
volvement. The burden of en
joyment and fulfillment rests
with the student.
If the physical campus is ster
ile, it is still certainly a con
venient and adequate home base
for exploring France and the
French. If the work load is too
much, it can be overcome by
better use of time during the
four-day school week. Very rare
ly is work assigned for the week
end and most often assignment
deadlines are flexible. And if the
rules are a bit confining at times,
a little finesse can go a long way
in opening locked doors.
The French experience begins
right at home in Tours. A city
of 100,000, it holds treasures
from the reign of Charlemagne
up to the modern World War II
reconstruction. The stores are
many and varied, from the
quaint flower stand to a suoer
market. There are some forty
churches and ten times that
many bars and cafes to get lost
in. The gare is a relic and the
postal service is buried in the
infamous bureaucracy, but it's
all France.
Local Personalities
It is the local personalities
that stand out. The pleasant old
winemaker, the drunk postman,
the efficient lady who sells
stamps around the corner, Pat
rice, the wild Indian daughter of
the concierge — these make the
local experience.
The highlight of the area are
the chateaux of Renaissance
France which grace the banks
of the beautiful Loire. Even the
autumn-winter groups are al
lowed a few sunny weeks to pic
nic along the river as a Sunday
outing.
When the need to escape
arises, and it does, Paris is just
a weekend away. In three hours
the student has a new world of
opportunities before him. All
the conservative provincialism
and the aristocratic stiffness
which characterize the two main
population elements of Tours
comes into a broader perspec
tive.
People of Paris
Paris is great any time of the
year and always full of excite

ment, except, perhaps, in August
when the French abandon their
city to the tourists. Art, music,
and drama abound. But again
it's the people, their frankness,
it's the people—their frankness,
cessive pride of things French,
their uncanny sense of a good
time, their spirit, and energy—
which make Paris.
All the monuments, museums,
and concerts lose their signi
ficance and their vitality if the
student does not take time out
to stroll along the Seine, spend
an afternoon in a cafe, or "slum
it in the Latin Quarter."
As far as music, the Paris
opera is better than the Tours
opera, which is not saying much.
Far more impressive are the
special concerts by world famous
artists who are drawn to Paris.
And not to be overlooked are
the almost insignificant im

promptu performances which
characterize the nightlife on the
Left Bank or in Montemartre.
Art and The Louvre
Art can be appreciated as it
is being created during an after
noon in Pigalle or along the
banks of the Seine. The old
masters can be viewed in the
famous Louvre, which tends to
be confusing and overwhelming
if not tackled with restraint.
Even so famous an edifice as
this has its share of junk.
The smaller galleries, Jeu de
Paume (Impressionist), the Mu
seum of Modern Art and the
Rodin collection are well worth
any time spent on them.
The essential thing is to re
main flexible and to explore. The
greatest frustration comes to
the student who tries to channel
his experience into some pre

formed image and thus is im
mediately on the defensive.
Areas in addition to Paris
with easy access to the student
are Normandy and Brittany
with the beaches of World War
11, a different cultural base, and
the greatest apple cider. To the
south is the Riviera which can
be reached during the four-day
weekend each group is allowed
per quarter. To the east is Ge
neva and the ski slopes of Mont
Blanc. To the west is the Atlan
tic Ocean.
In the middle of it all is the
Stanford student. All that is re
quired is that he choose some
direction and set out. If he
avoids the stagnation of apathy
and discouragement, he will
come back to California to tell
of a meaningful, growing experi
ence during six months at Stan
ford in France.
