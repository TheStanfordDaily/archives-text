# STANFORD IN FRANCE
## The 						Tours Campus: Pros And Cons 
### VAWTER PARKER France IX 
Assuming that the reader is
about to make an "objective"
choice of an overseas campus
and has not already accumulated
26 units of Italian, I will try to
set forth a few of the pros and
cons of the study center located
in Tours, France.
Tours, although only about
three and a half hours by train
from Paris, is the major city
of an area interesting in Its own
right, the Loire Valley. Students
there find themselves in the
heart of early Renaissance
France, within a few miles of
many of the most famous cha
teaux, intriguing in their his
tory and fascinating to anyone
even remotely interested in the
development of art and archi
tecture.
The center itself, although a
rather uninspiring example of
post-World War II architecture,
is located almost in the center
of downtown Tours and fronts
the Loire River. Thus the ment
al anguish often created by an
interior decorator who got a good
deal on grey paint, virtually non
existent closets and a heating
system of independent spirit
is alleviated by virtually unlimit
ed opportunities for mixing with
the French people.
Central Location
Equally important, the central
location of the campus makes it
easily accessible to French stu

dents at the lycees and univer
sity, many of whom attend al
most all campus social func
tions and frequent the center on
weekday afternoons as well. Due
to the generally good relations
between the center and towns
people, and an administration
more than willing to help a stu
dent become acquainted with
French families, only a student's
own reticence prevents him from
taking part in French life out
side the center.
Although geographical factors
make it almost impossible to
leave France other than during
the field trips or the three-week
break, students spend many
weekends in Paris. Although
students will need their own
transportation to get there, Nor
mandy and Brittany, more tra
ditional and culturally quite dif
ferent from the rest of France,
are nearby "escapes" and are
especially interesting to a stu
dent with a sense of history.
Cars can be rented in Tours by
anyone over 21, even without
an internation driver's license.
The field trips, one to Rome
and one to Madrid, London or
Amsterdam, are (or at least
were in 1964-65) amazingly well
planned, providing transporta
tion, housing, entertainment and
outstanding guides at very little
cost to the student. The field
trips balance organized tours

and free time so that students
can still explore a city on their
own.
Criticism
Criticism of the French cam
pus is generally directed at the
building (which, it might be re
membered, would not have been
constructed in the first place
had the American forces not
bombed the city in driving back
the Nazis), and the food, which
has been described by every
term from "exciting to the pal
ate" to "appalling." In the end,
girls tend to gain weight, guys
to lose it.
The course in "French Civili
zation," a two-unit catch-all that
unfortunately ends in an exam,
has also come under fire, as the
quality of the guest lecturers
varies tremendously. The langu
age program also varies depend
ing on the level of the group in
which a student is placed; some
students consider it a necesssary
evil; others, an unnecessary evil;
and still others, generally in the
lowest or highest group, enjoy
able and worthwhile.
Students rumored to have
tried them report that study fa
cilities could be improved. Sports
facilities are adequate but are
unfortunately not near the
center.
But even though improve
ments could and should be made,
I am convinced that they would
be improvements on what is al
ready a very "good thing."

Central Location
Equally important, the central
location of the campus makes it
easily accessible to French stu

dents at the lycees and univer
sity, many of whom attend al
most all campus social func
tions and frequent the center on
weekday afternoons as well. Due
to the generally good relations
between the center and towns
people, and an administration
more than willing to help a stu
dent become acquainted with
French families, only a student's
own reticence prevents him from
taking part in French life out
side the center.
Although geographical factors
make it almost impossible to
leave France other than during
the field trips or the three-week
break, students spend many
weekends in Paris. Although
students will need their own
transportation to get there, Nor
mandy and Brittany, more tra
ditional and culturally quite dif
ferent from the rest of France,
are nearby "escapes" and are
especially interesting to a stu
dent with a sense of history.
Cars can be rented in Tours by
anyone over 21, even without
an internation driver's license.
The field trips, one to Rome
and one to Madrid, London or
Amsterdam, are (or at least
were in 1964-65) amazingly well
planned, providing transporta
tion, housing, entertainment and
outstanding guides at very little
cost to the student. The field
trips balance organized tours

and free time so that students
can still explore a city on their
own.
Criticism
Criticism of the French cam
pus is generally directed at the
building (which, it might be re
membered, would not have been
constructed in the first place
had the American forces not
bombed the city in driving back
the Nazis), and the food, which
has been described by every
term from "exciting to the pal
ate" to "appalling." In the end,
girls tend to gain weight, guys
to lose it.
The course in "French Civili
zation," a two-unit catch-all that
unfortunately ends in an exam,
has also come under fire, as the
quality of the guest lecturers
varies tremendously. The langu
age program also varies depend
ing on the level of the group in
which a student is placed; some
students consider it a necesssary
evil; others, an unnecessary evil;
and still others, generally in the
lowest or highest group, enjoy
able and worthwhile.
Students rumored to have
tried them report that study fa
cilities could be improved. Sports
facilities are adequate but are
unfortunately not near the
center.
But even though improve
ments could and should be made,
I am convinced that they would
be improvements on what is al
ready a very "good thing."

Assuming that the reader is
about to make an "objective"
choice of an overseas campus
and has not already accumulated
26 units of Italian, I will try to
set forth a few of the pros and
cons of the study center located
in Tours, France.
Tours, although only about
three and a half hours by train
from Paris, is the major city
of an area interesting in Its own
right, the Loire Valley. Students
there find themselves in the
heart of early Renaissance
France, within a few miles of
many of the most famous cha
teaux, intriguing in their his
tory and fascinating to anyone
even remotely interested in the
development of art and archi
tecture.
The center itself, although a
rather uninspiring example of
post-World War II architecture,
is located almost in the center
of downtown Tours and fronts
the Loire River. Thus the ment
al anguish often created by an
interior decorator who got a good
deal on grey paint, virtually non
existent closets and a heating
system of independent spirit
is alleviated by virtually unlimit
ed opportunities for mixing with
the French people.
