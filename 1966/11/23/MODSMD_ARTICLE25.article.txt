# DEUTSCHLAND ZIEMLICH GUT
## Burg Great But No EE STANFORD IN GERMANY 
### JAMES B. BRISCOE Germany XVI 
"The Stanford Overseas pro
gram is great. But it could be
so much better."
This statement, I suspect, re
flects the feelings of a large
part, i! not a majority of the
overseas alumni. It certainly
mirrors my feelings as I try to
evaluate the six months I spent
with the Germany XVI Group.
The program is a compromise,
a middle course between a tra
ditional Junior year abroad pro
gram in a European University,
and no program at all. The com
promise is based on the notion
that overseas study can be of
value to students not fluent in
the language of the country, a
premise Implicitly rejected by
most programs with language
proficiency requirements.

Some eight years ago, after
the sort of painstaking exami
nation that habitually precedes
any major action, Stanford
made what many consider one
of the most far-sighted and
courageous decisions of recent
times and inaugurated an over
seas program for the general
student body, a program for
which extensive language train
ing would not be a prerequisite.
It went over like a helium
filled balloon, and judging from
the number of imitators (and
mixing a metaphor for good
measure) quite a few people
saluted.
To gain an impression of the
effect the program has had on
the farm, one needs only listen
to conversations among students
about the Italian floods or the
German political shakeup. With
803 students per year (Isn't that
right, Margaret?) going to the
continent, interest in European
affairs is widespread. And the
number of students who return
to take further courses in lan
guage, history, political science,
art or music that they might
otherwise have never considered,
can only be guessed at.
Great, But...
It's a great program.
But, damn it all, it could be
so much better.
(I should interject here that
I can vouch for the validity of
what follows only so far as it
pertains to the German campus,
though I suspect many of the
problems noted are common to
all the centers.)
In many ways the overseas
campuses provide an almost
ideal academic environment.
Student-faculty contact is con
stant and unstructured; intel
lectual motivation is high, stu
dents are interested in studying
almost anything pertaining to
the culture into which they've
been dropped; and extracurricu
lar activities, or indeed any ac
tivities, are so limited, particu
larly during the winter, that
study is sometimes the only di
version.
But the academic program at
the Burg is disappointing. All
courses save the language sec
tions, are taught in a large lec
ture hall with 73 students placid
ly taking notes while the pro
fessor lectures. And (all to
gether now) The Courses Are
Frequently Not Relevent To The
Country (or even continent) In
Which They're Being Taught.
(Riiight).
Seminars
If the students could study

what they spend much of their
spare time reading about and
discussing — Germany and Eu
rope, and if these subjects could
be taught, at least partially, in
small seminar groups or discus
sion sections, then academically
the program would be much
more rewarding.
Such a curriculum would
place a heavier load on the pro
fessors in residence, but even if
added on top of their present
three lectures a week, the load
would hardly seem crushing.
Contact with the natives is not
all it could be either. True, the
Burg has a "special relation
ship" with the villagers in Beu
telsbach, and each student is
adopted by a German family,
but unfortunately, many of the
families have "had" students in
all of the past XVII groups, and
by now are more "Stanfordized"
than most of the students. Fur
thermore, the conversational
ability of a student with two or
three quarters of German is just
about limited to the weather
and maybe the quality of the
food. Opportunities to meet oth
er Germans ("there are many
kinds of Germans") outside the
village are few, and encounters
with indigenous students occur
only once or twice a quarter at
social functions or ad hoc dis
cussion groups.
More Contact
More contact might be
brought about in two ways: by
requiring more language study,
and/or by moving the campus
out of the sticks. The first pro
posal is probably undesirable as
substantially higher language
requirements would severely re
duce the number of students eli
gible to participate in the pro
gram. However more effort
could be made to put students in
the country with whose lan
guage they are most fluent,
minimizing the cases in which a
student with four years of
French (and two quarters of
German) goes to Germany.
The second proposal, however,
is more feasible. Putting 73
Stanford students atop a hill in
rural Germany and calling it a
"European experience" has al
ways seemed a bit unrealistic.
The Burg, and the other cam
puses as well, I suspect, remains
an American enclave, in which
European customs and ideas,
and it might be added, European
languages, gain only a precari
ous toehold.
Ne»v Location?
How different might the pro
gram be, if the campus were lo

cated in a populated area, pref
erably near a German Univer
sity? The curriculum might be
substantially the same as now,
courses taught in English by
Stanford Professors, but stu
dents could associate daily with
a wide cross-section of natives,
particularly students, and par
ticipate, as far as their lan
guage ability would permit, in
the extracurricular life of the
University, and the activities of
the community.
I must confess to strong feel
ings of ambivalence about this
measure, however, for the isola
tion of the present campus,
while detracting from the pro
gram in one sense, adds greatly
to it in another. Perhaps the
merits of isolation can be ex
pressed as follows:
If it were possible to distin
guish two separate "experi
ences" associated with attend
ing an overseas campus as
presently set up, one a
"European experience," study
ing and traveling in Europe, and
the other a "group experience,"
living and working in a close
knit klan of 80-odd students, pro
fessors and administrators; and
if it were necessary to choose
between them, if I were permit
ted only one and not the other,
I would unhesitatingly choose
the group experience.
Desire To Talk
One Branner sponsor, when
asked what she wanted to do at
this University, replied, "I want
to talk to people." And the pres
ent overseas arrangement al
lows just that, an invaluable op
portunity to talk with people,
75 or 80 people, and to live and
eat and share experiences with
them.
Because a group is forced by
its isolation to turn in upon it
self, each campus becomes a re
warding experience in commu
nal living, a model of what a
residence university at its best,
might be (as opposed to the
university of residences toward
which Stanford now seems
headed.)
But, however valuable the
present program may be in this
respect, as a European experi
ence it rates no more than a C.
And that's what all the shout
ing is about.

stant and unstructured; intel
lectual motivation is high, stu
dents are interested in studying
almost anything pertaining to
the culture into which they've
been dropped; and extracurricu
lar activities, or indeed any ac
tivities, are so limited, particu
larly during the winter, that
study is sometimes the only di
version.
But the academic program at
the Burg is disappointing. All
courses save the language sec
tions, are taught in a large lec
ture hall with 73 students placid
ly taking notes while the pro
fessor lectures. And (all to
gether now) The Courses Are
Frequently Not Relevent To The
Country (or even continent) In
Which They're Being Taught.
(Riiight).
Seminars
If the students could study

what they spend much of their
spare time reading about and
discussing — Germany and Eu
rope, and if these subjects could
be taught, at least partially, in
small seminar groups or discus
sion sections, then academically
the program would be much
more rewarding.
Such a curriculum would
place a heavier load on the pro
fessors in residence, but even if
added on top of their present
three lectures a week, the load
would hardly seem crushing.
Contact with the natives is not
all it could be either. True, the
Burg has a "special relation
ship" with the villagers in Beu
telsbach, and each student is
adopted by a German family,
but unfortunately, many of the
families have "had" students in
all of the past XVII groups, and
by now are more "Stanfordized"
than most of the students. Fur
thermore, the conversational
ability of a student with two or
three quarters of German is just
about limited to the weather
and maybe the quality of the
food. Opportunities to meet oth
er Germans ("there are many
kinds of Germans") outside the
village are few, and encounters
with indigenous students occur
only once or twice a quarter at
social functions or ad hoc dis
cussion groups.
More Contact
More contact might be
brought about in two ways: by
requiring more language study,
and/or by moving the campus
out of the sticks. The first pro
posal is probably undesirable as
substantially higher language
requirements would severely re
duce the number of students eli
gible to participate in the pro
gram. However more effort
could be made to put students in
the country with whose lan
guage they are most fluent,
minimizing the cases in which a
student with four years of
French (and two quarters of
German) goes to Germany.
The second proposal, however,
is more feasible. Putting 73
Stanford students atop a hill in
rural Germany and calling it a
"European experience" has al
ways seemed a bit unrealistic.
The Burg, and the other cam
puses as well, I suspect, remains
an American enclave, in which
European customs and ideas,
and it might be added, European
languages, gain only a precari
ous toehold.
Ne»v Location?
How different might the pro
gram be, if the campus were lo

cated in a populated area, pref
erably near a German Univer
sity? The curriculum might be
substantially the same as now,
courses taught in English by
Stanford Professors, but stu
dents could associate daily with
a wide cross-section of natives,
particularly students, and par
ticipate, as far as their lan
guage ability would permit, in
the extracurricular life of the
University, and the activities of
the community.
I must confess to strong feel
ings of ambivalence about this
measure, however, for the isola
tion of the present campus,
while detracting from the pro
gram in one sense, adds greatly
to it in another. Perhaps the
merits of isolation can be ex
pressed as follows:
If it were possible to distin
guish two separate "experi
ences" associated with attend
ing an overseas campus as
presently set up, one a
"European experience," study
ing and traveling in Europe, and
the other a "group experience,"
living and working in a close
knit klan of 80-odd students, pro
fessors and administrators; and
if it were necessary to choose
between them, if I were permit
ted only one and not the other,
I would unhesitatingly choose
the group experience.
Desire To Talk
One Branner sponsor, when
asked what she wanted to do at
this University, replied, "I want
to talk to people." And the pres
ent overseas arrangement al
lows just that, an invaluable op
portunity to talk with people,
75 or 80 people, and to live and
eat and share experiences with
them.
Because a group is forced by
its isolation to turn in upon it
self, each campus becomes a re
warding experience in commu
nal living, a model of what a
residence university at its best,
might be (as opposed to the
university of residences toward
which Stanford now seems
headed.)
But, however valuable the
present program may be in this
respect, as a European experi
ence it rates no more than a C.
And that's what all the shout
ing is about.

"The Stanford Overseas pro
gram is great. But it could be
so much better."
This statement, I suspect, re
flects the feelings of a large
part, i! not a majority of the
overseas alumni. It certainly
mirrors my feelings as I try to
evaluate the six months I spent
with the Germany XVI Group.
The program is a compromise,
a middle course between a tra
ditional Junior year abroad pro
gram in a European University,
and no program at all. The com
promise is based on the notion
that overseas study can be of
value to students not fluent in
the language of the country, a
premise Implicitly rejected by
most programs with language
proficiency requirements.

Some eight years ago, after
the sort of painstaking exami
nation that habitually precedes
any major action, Stanford
made what many consider one
of the most far-sighted and
courageous decisions of recent
times and inaugurated an over
seas program for the general
student body, a program for
which extensive language train
ing would not be a prerequisite.
It went over like a helium
filled balloon, and judging from
the number of imitators (and
mixing a metaphor for good
measure) quite a few people
saluted.
To gain an impression of the
effect the program has had on
the farm, one needs only listen
to conversations among students
about the Italian floods or the
German political shakeup. With
803 students per year (Isn't that
right, Margaret?) going to the
continent, interest in European
affairs is widespread. And the
number of students who return
to take further courses in lan
guage, history, political science,
art or music that they might
otherwise have never considered,
can only be guessed at.
Great, But...
It's a great program.
But, damn it all, it could be
so much better.
(I should interject here that
I can vouch for the validity of
what follows only so far as it
pertains to the German campus,
though I suspect many of the
problems noted are common to
all the centers.)

requirements would severely re
duce the number of students eli
gible to participate in the pro
gram. However more effort
could be made to put students in
the country with whose lan
guage they are most fluent,
minimizing the cases in which a
student with four years of
French (and two quarters of
German) goes to Germany.
The second proposal, however,
is more feasible. Putting 73
Stanford students atop a hill in
rural Germany and calling it a
"European experience" has al
ways seemed a bit unrealistic.
The Burg, and the other cam
puses as well, I suspect, remains
an American enclave, in which
European customs and ideas,
and it might be added, European
languages, gain only a precari
ous toehold.
Ne»v Location?
How different might the pro
gram be, if the campus were lo

cated in a populated area, pref
erably near a German Univer
sity? The curriculum might be
substantially the same as now,
courses taught in English by
Stanford Professors, but stu
dents could associate daily with
a wide cross-section of natives,
particularly students, and par
ticipate, as far as their lan
guage ability would permit, in
the extracurricular life of the
University, and the activities of
the community.
I must confess to strong feel
ings of ambivalence about this
measure, however, for the isola
tion of the present campus,
while detracting from the pro
gram in one sense, adds greatly
to it in another. Perhaps the
merits of isolation can be ex
pressed as follows:
If it were possible to distin
guish two separate "experi
ences" associated with attend
ing an overseas campus as
presently set up, one a
"European experience," study
ing and traveling in Europe, and
the other a "group experience,"
living and working in a close
knit klan of 80-odd students, pro
fessors and administrators; and
if it were necessary to choose
between them, if I were permit
ted only one and not the other,
I would unhesitatingly choose
the group experience.
Desire To Talk
One Branner sponsor, when
asked what she wanted to do at
this University, replied, "I want
to talk to people." And the pres
ent overseas arrangement al
lows just that, an invaluable op
portunity to talk with people,
75 or 80 people, and to live and
eat and share experiences with
them.
Because a group is forced by
its isolation to turn in upon it
self, each campus becomes a re
warding experience in commu
nal living, a model of what a
residence university at its best,
might be (as opposed to the
university of residences toward
which Stanford now seems
headed.)
But, however valuable the
present program may be in this
respect, as a European experi
ence it rates no more than a C.
And that's what all the shout
ing is about.

"The Stanford Overseas pro
gram is great. But it could be
so much better."
This statement, I suspect, re
flects the feelings of a large
part, i! not a majority of the
overseas alumni. It certainly
mirrors my feelings as I try to
evaluate the six months I spent
with the Germany XVI Group.
The program is a compromise,
a middle course between a tra
ditional Junior year abroad pro
gram in a European University,
and no program at all. The com
promise is based on the notion
that overseas study can be of
value to students not fluent in
the language of the country, a
premise Implicitly rejected by
most programs with language
proficiency requirements.

Some eight years ago, after
the sort of painstaking exami
nation that habitually precedes
any major action, Stanford
made what many consider one
of the most far-sighted and
courageous decisions of recent
times and inaugurated an over
seas program for the general
student body, a program for
which extensive language train
ing would not be a prerequisite.
It went over like a helium
filled balloon, and judging from
the number of imitators (and
mixing a metaphor for good
measure) quite a few people
saluted.
To gain an impression of the
effect the program has had on
the farm, one needs only listen
to conversations among students
about the Italian floods or the
German political shakeup. With
803 students per year (Isn't that
right, Margaret?) going to the
continent, interest in European
affairs is widespread. And the
number of students who return
to take further courses in lan
guage, history, political science,
art or music that they might
otherwise have never considered,
can only be guessed at.
Great, But...
It's a great program.
But, damn it all, it could be
so much better.
(I should interject here that
I can vouch for the validity of
what follows only so far as it
pertains to the German campus,
though I suspect many of the
problems noted are common to
all the centers.)
In many ways the overseas
campuses provide an almost
ideal academic environment.
Student-faculty contact is con
stant and unstructured; intel
lectual motivation is high, stu
dents are interested in studying
almost anything pertaining to
the culture into which they've
been dropped; and extracurricu
lar activities, or indeed any ac
tivities, are so limited, particu
larly during the winter, that
study is sometimes the only di
version.
But the academic program at
the Burg is disappointing. All
courses save the language sec
tions, are taught in a large lec
ture hall with 73 students placid
ly taking notes while the pro
fessor lectures. And (all to
gether now) The Courses Are
Frequently Not Relevent To The
Country (or even continent) In
Which They're Being Taught.
(Riiight).
Seminars
If the students could study

what they spend much of their
spare time reading about and
discussing — Germany and Eu
rope, and if these subjects could
be taught, at least partially, in
small seminar groups or discus
sion sections, then academically
the program would be much
more rewarding.
Such a curriculum would
place a heavier load on the pro
fessors in residence, but even if
added on top of their present
three lectures a week, the load
would hardly seem crushing.
Contact with the natives is not
all it could be either. True, the
Burg has a "special relation
ship" with the villagers in Beu
telsbach, and each student is
adopted by a German family,
but unfortunately, many of the
families have "had" students in
all of the past XVII groups, and
by now are more "Stanfordized"
than most of the students. Fur
thermore, the conversational
ability of a student with two or
three quarters of German is just
about limited to the weather
and maybe the quality of the
food. Opportunities to meet oth
er Germans ("there are many
kinds of Germans") outside the
village are few, and encounters
with indigenous students occur
only once or twice a quarter at
social functions or ad hoc dis
cussion groups.
More Contact
More contact might be
brought about in two ways: by
requiring more language study,
and/or by moving the campus
out of the sticks. The first pro
posal is probably undesirable as
substantially higher language
requirements would severely re
duce the number of students eli
gible to participate in the pro
gram. However more effort
could be made to put students in
the country with whose lan

ent overseas arrangement al
lows just that, an invaluable op
portunity to talk with people,
75 or 80 people, and to live and
eat and share experiences with
them.
Because a group is forced by
its isolation to turn in upon it
self, each campus becomes a re
warding experience in commu
nal living, a model of what a
residence university at its best,
might be (as opposed to the
university of residences toward
which Stanford now seems
headed.)
But, however valuable the
present program may be in this
respect, as a European experi
ence it rates no more than a C.
And that's what all the shout
ing is about.

"The Stanford Overseas pro
gram is great. But it could be
so much better."
This statement, I suspect, re
flects the feelings of a large
part, i! not a majority of the
overseas alumni. It certainly
mirrors my feelings as I try to
evaluate the six months I spent
with the Germany XVI Group.
The program is a compromise,
a middle course between a tra
ditional Junior year abroad pro
gram in a European University,
and no program at all. The com
promise is based on the notion
that overseas study can be of
value to students not fluent in
the language of the country, a
premise Implicitly rejected by
most programs with language
proficiency requirements.

Some eight years ago, after
the sort of painstaking exami
nation that habitually precedes
any major action, Stanford
made what many consider one
of the most far-sighted and
courageous decisions of recent
times and inaugurated an over
seas program for the general
student body, a program for
which extensive language train
ing would not be a prerequisite.
It went over like a helium
filled balloon, and judging from
the number of imitators (and
mixing a metaphor for good
measure) quite a few people
saluted.
To gain an impression of the
effect the program has had on
the farm, one needs only listen
to conversations among students
about the Italian floods or the
German political shakeup. With
803 students per year (Isn't that
right, Margaret?) going to the
continent, interest in European
affairs is widespread. And the
number of students who return
to take further courses in lan
guage, history, political science,
art or music that they might
otherwise have never considered,
can only be guessed at.
Great, But...
It's a great program.
But, damn it all, it could be
so much better.
(I should interject here that
I can vouch for the validity of
what follows only so far as it
pertains to the German campus,
though I suspect many of the
problems noted are common to
all the centers.)
In many ways the overseas
campuses provide an almost
ideal academic environment.
Student-faculty contact is con
stant and unstructured; intel
lectual motivation is high, stu
dents are interested in studying
almost anything pertaining to
the culture into which they've
been dropped; and extracurricu
lar activities, or indeed any ac
tivities, are so limited, particu
larly during the winter, that
study is sometimes the only di
version.
But the academic program at
the Burg is disappointing. All
courses save the language sec
tions, are taught in a large lec
ture hall with 73 students placid
ly taking notes while the pro
fessor lectures. And (all to
gether now) The Courses Are
Frequently Not Relevent To The
Country (or even continent) In
Which They're Being Taught.
(Riiight).
Seminars
If the students could study

what they spend much of their
spare time reading about and
discussing — Germany and Eu
rope, and if these subjects could
be taught, at least partially, in
small seminar groups or discus
sion sections, then academically
the program would be much
more rewarding.
Such a curriculum would
place a heavier load on the pro
fessors in residence, but even if
added on top of their present
three lectures a week, the load
would hardly seem crushing.
Contact with the natives is not
all it could be either. True, the
Burg has a "special relation
ship" with the villagers in Beu
telsbach, and each student is
adopted by a German family,
but unfortunately, many of the
families have "had" students in
all of the past XVII groups, and
by now are more "Stanfordized"
than most of the students. Fur
thermore, the conversational
ability of a student with two or
three quarters of German is just
about limited to the weather
and maybe the quality of the
food. Opportunities to meet oth
er Germans ("there are many
kinds of Germans") outside the
village are few, and encounters
with indigenous students occur
only once or twice a quarter at
social functions or ad hoc dis
cussion groups.
More Contact
More contact might be
brought about in two ways: by
requiring more language study,
and/or by moving the campus
out of the sticks. The first pro
posal is probably undesirable as
substantially higher language
requirements would severely re
duce the number of students eli
gible to participate in the pro
gram. However more effort
could be made to put students in
the country with whose lan
guage they are most fluent,
minimizing the cases in which a
student with four years of
French (and two quarters of
German) goes to Germany.
The second proposal, however,
is more feasible. Putting 73
Stanford students atop a hill in
rural Germany and calling it a
"European experience" has al
ways seemed a bit unrealistic.
The Burg, and the other cam
puses as well, I suspect, remains
an American enclave, in which
European customs and ideas,
and it might be added, European
languages, gain only a precari
ous toehold.
Ne»v Location?
How different might the pro
gram be, if the campus were lo

cated in a populated area, pref
erably near a German Univer
sity? The curriculum might be
substantially the same as now,
courses taught in English by
Stanford Professors, but stu
dents could associate daily with
a wide cross-section of natives,
particularly students, and par
ticipate, as far as their lan
guage ability would permit, in
the extracurricular life of the
University, and the activities of
the community.
I must confess to strong feel
ings of ambivalence about this
measure, however, for the isola
tion of the present campus,
while detracting from the pro
gram in one sense, adds greatly
to it in another. Perhaps the
merits of isolation can be ex
pressed as follows:
If it were possible to distin
guish two separate "experi
ences" associated with attend
ing an overseas campus as
presently set up, one a
"European experience," study
ing and traveling in Europe, and
the other a "group experience,"
living and working in a close
knit klan of 80-odd students, pro
fessors and administrators; and
if it were necessary to choose
between them, if I were permit
ted only one and not the other,
I would unhesitatingly choose
the group experience.
Desire To Talk
One Branner sponsor, when
asked what she wanted to do at
this University, replied, "I want
to talk to people." And the pres
ent overseas arrangement al
lows just that, an invaluable op
portunity to talk with people,
75 or 80 people, and to live and
eat and share experiences with
them.
