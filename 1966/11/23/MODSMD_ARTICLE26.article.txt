# Life And The Villa
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER Italy XII 
Stanford in Italy is a huge
realm of "never before's": for
°ign landscape, foreign tongues,
foreign people; painting and
sculpture stretching back past
the foundation of Rome; Re
naissance culture in a modern
city matrix.
But Stanford in Italy provides
till a further key to experience,
knowing the people one lives
with and confronting oneself are
two intangibly yet immeasurably
valuable outgrowths of the
"Italian experience."
A member of Italy VII once
said, "Overseas, you get to know
and enjoy knowing — people
•'ou would never even meet at
Stanford. You get to know your
old friends as you've never
known them before, or will ever
again. And you get to know girls
as you will never again have a
chance to."
Villa Paola Affects All
These levels of experience —
he ones one can bring back on
slides, the ones one can talk
about with friends, and the ones
(hat manifest themselves more
subtly.
The Villa functions academi
cally, physically, and philosophi
cally as a warm body of mem
orable experiences. Yet there
remain a number of improve

ments in the academic structure,
the physical operation, and the
philosophical substructure of the
Villa that could amplify the
benefits of Villa life consider
ably.
Courses Concern Italy
For Italy XII every course
was integrated into the Italian
environment: Roman History,
Renaissance Art, Renaissance
Philosophy, Italian Political His
tory, the Ideology of Fascism,
and the Italian Communist
Party.
Intimate contact with profes
sors can be one of the most valu
able results of living overseas.
In Italy XII, professors Doyle,
Triska, and Kahn accompanied
the students, or rather led the
way, on jaunts to Machiavelli's
house for an afternoon over a
battle of Chianti Classico, or on
skin-diving expeditions, or
prowling around and slithering
into Etruscan tombs.
Grading in most courses was
fair, and the work load adjusted
to allow appreciation of extra
curricular Italy. However, some
gross inequities cropped up in
the 6 unit Italian classes.
The Villa San Paola directors
collaborate on a masterpiece of
administration. Dr. Giuseppe
Mammarella, one of Italy's most
prominent political scientists, is
probably the most capable or
ganizer on the Peninsula. Dr.
Guelfo Frulla is the master of
the fine and forgotten art of
humanity.
Barnabiti Own Villa
The Villa San Paola dates back
to the heart of the Renaissance,
and is currently owned by the
Barnabiti order of teaching
priests. The Barnabiti, who raise
the rental of the Villa every
year, appear to take advantage
of their contract in their man
agement of the Villa.
The Villa's food is famous
among Stanford students visit
ing Florence from other foreign
campuses. Pasta and panini,
however, tend to take from the
boys the pounds that the girls
acquire.
Stanford students learn to eat
(but not to appreciate) the Con
tinental breakfast of a roll and
a cup of crankcase coffee. The
evening meal comes around 7:30,
and lasts a leisurely hour: time
for bridge-making among stu
dents.
Godlike Garden
The Villa garden in the sum
mertime is a flower-filled, peace
ful place to talk or study. Its use
as a true place for relaxation is
severly hindered by strictures
issued by the Barnabiti.

Guys cannot take off their
shirts or girls wear shorts, even
in a secluded corner of the gar
den. And Florence turns into a
steam oven in July.
The Villa library is grossly in
adequate as a reference source,
although a building-up program
is finally being considered. The
one criticism of the Villa al
most unanimously leveled in a
recent poll was that there was
no place to study at night.
Regulations Don't Fit
A number of the foreign cam
pus regulations do not coincide
with any form of reality in hu
man behavior, and these regu
lations are intepreted rather sub
jectively.
For example, a foreign cam
pus regulation states that girls
may not travel singly or alone
with a boy. If regulations are set
up as parent-pacifiers, this rule
might have some substance. But
if 'Mommy' can't trust Sally
alone with a boy (dangerous!),
'Mommy' must be really crazy
to send her off to Europe for
a whole six months.
The Villa has absolutely no
place where a boy and a girl can
talk in the evening — with the
exception of an auditorium-like
entrance lobby. Neither is any
sort of open-house (girl in boys'
room, dangerous again) official
ly permitted. This regulation,


In Vicenza this summer, stu
dents from Italy XII explore the
architecture of Palladio. Terry
Ross, iK>intiii£, was the spring
president of the group. The
.ununer's field trip also took the
roup to Venice, and Padua.

Barnabiti Own Villa
The Villa San Paola dates back
to the heart of the Renaissance,
and is currently owned by the
Barnabiti order of teaching
priests. The Barnabiti, who raise
the rental of the Villa every
year, appear to take advantage
of their contract in their man
agement of the Villa.
The Villa's food is famous
among Stanford students visit
ing Florence from other foreign
campuses. Pasta and panini,
however, tend to take from the
boys the pounds that the girls
acquire.
Stanford students learn to eat
(but not to appreciate) the Con
tinental breakfast of a roll and
a cup of crankcase coffee. The
evening meal comes around 7:30,
and lasts a leisurely hour: time
for bridge-making among stu
dents.
Godlike Garden
The Villa garden in the sum
mertime is a flower-filled, peace
ful place to talk or study. Its use
as a true place for relaxation is
severly hindered by strictures
issued by the Barnabiti.

Guys cannot take off their
shirts or girls wear shorts, even
in a secluded corner of the gar
den. And Florence turns into a
steam oven in July.
The Villa library is grossly in
adequate as a reference source,
although a building-up program
is finally being considered. The
one criticism of the Villa al
most unanimously leveled in a
recent poll was that there was
no place to study at night.
Regulations Don't Fit
A number of the foreign cam
pus regulations do not coincide
with any form of reality in hu
man behavior, and these regu
lations are intepreted rather sub
jectively.
For example, a foreign cam
pus regulation states that girls
may not travel singly or alone
with a boy. If regulations are set
up as parent-pacifiers, this rule
might have some substance. But
if 'Mommy' can't trust Sally
alone with a boy (dangerous!),
'Mommy' must be really crazy
to send her off to Europe for
a whole six months.
The Villa has absolutely no
place where a boy and a girl can
talk in the evening — with the
exception of an auditorium-like
entrance lobby. Neither is any
sort of open-house (girl in boys'
room, dangerous again) official
ly permitted. This regulation,

Regulations Don't Fit
A number of the foreign cam
pus regulations do not coincide
with any form of reality in hu
man behavior, and these regu
lations are intepreted rather sub
jectively.
For example, a foreign cam
pus regulation states that girls
may not travel singly or alone
with a boy. If regulations are set
up as parent-pacifiers, this rule
might have some substance. But
if 'Mommy' can't trust Sally
alone with a boy (dangerous!),
'Mommy' must be really crazy
to send her off to Europe for
a whole six months.
The Villa has absolutely no
place where a boy and a girl can
talk in the evening — with the
exception of an auditorium-like
entrance lobby. Neither is any
sort of open-house (girl in boys'
room, dangerous again) official
ly permitted. This regulation,

Stanford in Italy is a huge

A member of Italy VII once
said, "Overseas, you get to know
and enjoy knowing — people

Stanford. You get to know your

again. And you get to know girls
as you will never again have a
chance to."
Villa Paola Affects All

about with friends, and the ones

The Villa functions academi
cally, physically, and philosophi
cally as a warm body of mem

Courses Concern Italy
For Italy XII every course
was integrated into the Italian
environment: Roman History,
Renaissance Art, Renaissance
Philosophy, Italian Political His
tory, the Ideology of Fascism,
and the Italian Communist
Party.
Intimate contact with profes
sors can be one of the most valu
able results of living overseas.
In Italy XII, professors Doyle,
Triska, and Kahn accompanied
the students, or rather led the
way, on jaunts to Machiavelli's
house for an afternoon over a
battle of Chianti Classico, or on
skin-diving expeditions, or
prowling around and slithering
into Etruscan tombs.
Grading in most courses was
fair, and the work load adjusted
to allow appreciation of extra
curricular Italy. However, some
gross inequities cropped up in
the 6 unit Italian classes.
The Villa San Paola directors
collaborate on a masterpiece of
administration. Dr. Giuseppe
Mammarella, one of Italy's most
prominent political scientists, is
probably the most capable or
ganizer on the Peninsula. Dr.
Guelfo Frulla is the master of
the fine and forgotten art of
humanity.
Barnabiti Own Villa
The Villa San Paola dates back
to the heart of the Renaissance,
and is currently owned by the
Barnabiti order of teaching
priests. The Barnabiti, who raise
the rental of the Villa every
year, appear to take advantage
of their contract in their man
agement of the Villa.
The Villa's food is famous
among Stanford students visit
ing Florence from other foreign
campuses. Pasta and panini,
however, tend to take from the
boys the pounds that the girls
acquire.
Stanford students learn to eat
(but not to appreciate) the Con
tinental breakfast of a roll and
a cup of crankcase coffee. The
evening meal comes around 7:30,
and lasts a leisurely hour: time
for bridge-making among stu
dents.
Godlike Garden
The Villa garden in the sum
mertime is a flower-filled, peace
ful place to talk or study. Its use
as a true place for relaxation is
severly hindered by strictures
issued by the Barnabiti.

Guys cannot take off their
shirts or girls wear shorts, even
in a secluded corner of the gar
den. And Florence turns into a
steam oven in July.
The Villa library is grossly in
adequate as a reference source,
