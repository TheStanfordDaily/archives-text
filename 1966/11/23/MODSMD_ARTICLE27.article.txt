Liquor is absolutely not per
mitted in rooms. This regulation
is no longer in accord with Stan
ford regs, and it certainly does
not parallel any Italian restric
tion.
No Sandals, Please
Heathen sandals, lascivious
shorts, and seductive slacks are
out of the question as far as the
rules go. Some American stu
dents still sneak off and wear
them anyway, however, to the
"insensate wrath" (?) of the
Italian populace.
Other regulations, such as that
restricting weekend departures
to Friday morning, seem unduly
hindering.
In conclusion, the academic
structure at Stanford in Italy is
a healthy and beneficial one,
with minor exceptions. The Villa
has a number of physical limita
tions, but improvements and
imagination can conquer these.
As far as regulations are con
cerned, the back road often pro

them, seem hostile and difficult.
And they say the Florentines
are hard to know. Yet it is really
a matter of the student taking
the initiative, for once you do
get to know them, you have a
lasting friendship.
It is true they won't take too
much initiative in making the
contacts, except with American
girls where Italian persistence
is unbelievable, but if you show
some interest in knowing them,
you are well rewarded. The cam
pus is lacking in organized ex
change programs with the Ital
ians, but Florence is not lacking
in opportunities—you have to
take advantage of them your
self.
Florentine Art
The art and history of Flor
ence are unquestionable, and
despite the flood, you will stand
in wonder at what is collected
here. Every building within the
walls has a history and your
sightseeing will never cease.
With the Villa so close to down
town, (about ten minutes by
bus), the afternoons and eve
nings of the week are put to
most valuable use in museums
and churches, —and in walking
and talking.
When you leave Florence you
have innumerable places to visit
within a weekend's range. Cen
tral Italy is speckled by historic
little towns where St. Francis or
Dante or Leonardo walked.
The Ages Of Rome
To the south, only four hours
away, is unequalled Rome. There
you find the Etruscan and the
Roman and the Renaissance and
even the modern. You go from
the Coliseum to St. Peters to the


At the famous "Palio" in Siena, Janis McClain took every oppor
tunity to iwet the Italians. During the festival the townspeople
wear medieval costumes such as this. This year's event attracted
over seventy thousand spectators and most of the residents of the
Villa.
