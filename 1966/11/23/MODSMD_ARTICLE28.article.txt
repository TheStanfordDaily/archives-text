# Firenze: Medici City
## 
### KIRK HANSON Italy XII Managing Editor 
Arriving at the Villa late at
night, you are not sure where
your overseas experience has
landed you, but by the morning
light you look down on the 15th
century city of the Medici.
But Florence is the outside
world and you have to walk out
those front gates of the Villa,
called the goldfish bowl on the
hill, to reach it. At times this is
the hardest thing you do, for the

Via Veneto and you have trans
versed two thousand years.
You can reach even Naples, or
the French Riviera on a three
day weekend, but it is in the little
out of the way places that you
learn the most about the Ital
ians.
The Italians are wonderful and
yet frustrating. Their easy-going
approach to life is unnerving to
many students. Often they see
life as a lark and live for the
moment. Others only live in the
past. The Florentine is proud, for
he considers himself the cultured
and most distinguished of the
Italians.
The Sicilian is looked down
upon by many, yet it is he who is
the most friendly and warm. The
Italian from Milan is
and pragmatic and business
like, as Italy's economy is cen
tered there.
Italian Male
The Italian male is one of the
most discussed topics at the
Villa. Sidney Alexander, Ameri
can author living in Florence
and occasional lecturer at th
Villa, terms him "bothersome
but not really dangerous." In a
way, the Italian male seems
strangely naive in a country
where sex appears such a pre
occupation. But he's there and
all the girls quickly know it.
The joys of Italian life are
many, but there are also unique
experiences you will remember
but not necessarily miss: the
packed buses sailing down the
narrow streets and ways, postal
strikes so often you wonder
when you will next hear from
homo; and the "partisan" ref
erees in the games with the Uni
versity of Florence.
There are places to get away
from it all too. The experience is
keyed and intense and there are
times you just have to get away.
In the summer the best places
are the beaches at Viareggio or
Rimini, but there are also dozens
of little mountain villages where
you can go and camp and relax.
The danger is that these places
will become your total existence
and you will spend the summer
on these beaches, or the Isle of
Elba. The experience is what the
individual makes it.
At times the opportunity to
travel and see Florence comes in
direct conflict with the wonder
ful life of the Villa. The experi
ence of living together is so val
uable that it is hard to leave and
at times you may feel you have
to decide against the group and
leave them to get to the Italians.
But you really don't, for it is
all part of the one experience.
You learn about yourself and
your friends and the Italiansâ€”it
is all learning about people.
