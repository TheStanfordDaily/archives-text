# Letters Urge Harris; Cut Hair, Read Bible
## 
### BOB DAVIS 
"The first thing you should do is to
get a very short haircut to startle
your adversaries into admiration," a
lady from Walla Walla, Washington
wrote Dave Harris last spring.
Since Harris was elected ASSU
president and received national pub
licity, he has been getting consider
able advice through the mails from
people who are totally unknown to
him. "The crank letters usually come
right after Dave's name has been in
the paper," Sue Horst, Harris' secre
tary explained.
They often attempt to be morally
instructive.
The lady from Walla Walla contin
ued, "I thank God that I have no
friends at Stanford University to be
influenced by your outlook on life;
and I hope you will read the Psalm
David in the Bible every day that
you are serving the students at Stan
ford as their President."
Hairy Chests To Match
The writer of a letter signed "Dis
gusted Parents of L. A." insisted that
"I am sick and tired of being exposed
to shaggy heads, grizzly faces, and
Wairy chests to match."
One elderly gentleman from Palo
Alto has sent Harris a series of news
paper clippings and a short note.
A clipping from the Examiner
showed before-and-after pictures of
several "Hell's Angels" who were
lailed in San Mateo County and or
uered "shorn, shaved, and scrubbed."
The man wrote, "You don't like Old
Timers and the established routines,
that has taken GOOD VIRILE MEN,
ages to build into a real Republic . . .
Gad d.d.d.d. (sic)"
Amy Vanderbilt Says...
Another clipping was an Amy Van
derbilt column on manners for teen
age boys. Harris' Palo Alto friend is
fond of underlining pertinent pas
sages with red ink:
"Your appearance begins with your
hair. To make a favorable impression,
all it has to be is neat and healthy,
combing should not be public."
How does Harris react to the abuse?
Miss Horst, who sees most of the mail
first, says that he reads all of it, but
remains nonchalent about the cranks.
"He usually laughs about them, but
there is nothing he can do."
Delt Encounter
The single incident which triggered
the greatest volume of mail was the
Harris encounter with several Delta
Tau Delta fraternity members.
One writer praised the Delts and

insisted that it is necessary to use
force when confronted with "willful
stupidity, selfishness, and stubborn
ness." But most of the letters support
ed Harris.
Several people wrote to encourage
Harris to wear his hair short as an
affront to the Delts. A member of the
English Department at Washington
State University suggested that:
. . you keep your head shaved
during the school year. You look good,
you can wear a watchcap/beret/tam/
sombrero (sic) if it gets cold, but
most of all you will be a walking
memory of the essential and inescapa
ble idiocy and immaturity of the fra
ternity system."
One local fraternity member wrote
that Harris had grown "several feet"
in his estimation, though it was not a
house consensus.
An ASSU president of the early
1930's wrote to praise Harris and sug
gest that he put the matter of his hair
length to a general campus vote. He
offered Harris financial help to pay
for the printing bill.
More Than Fun and Games
A man from Oakland saw more in
the Harris-Delt unpleasantness than
fun and games:
"This matter goes much deeper than
just some students frolic-making! The
driving spirit behind it has been en
gendered by your stand for civil lib
erties and your courageous fight
against our dirty, murderous war in
Vietnam."
Perhaps the most succinct note of
encouragement came from a young
lady. "Dave, don't let the bastards
grind you down."
