### CARL MUNDT Austria I 
A Stanford student chosen
for a six-month stay in Austria
will find Switzerland, N. Italy,
S. Germany, N. Yugoslavia,
Czechoslavakia and Hungary
within easy travelling distance
on a weekend.
Transportation is available by
all the usual methods including
train service which, along with
private automobile, is probably
most convenient. In addition the
train is very reasonably priced.
The climate of this alpine land
varies from cold, snowy winters
to warm, pleasant summers. The
mountain areas of the west are
commonly colder than the flat
lands near the Hungarian
border.
To describe all of the places
and objects of interest in Austria
would not be feasible. Vienna is
one of the cultural capitals of
the world. The collections of
and musical events are continu
ous and varied.
Almost every Austrian city
has its own orchestra and sev
eral museums. The local popu
lation is very conscious of the
fact that their ancestors were
the geniuses of classical and
baroque music. The works of
Mozart, Haydn and Beethoven
are heard everywhere at fantas
tically low prices.
Vienna
Some of the points of interest
to be found in and around Vien
na are the Grinsing nightclub
district, the ice shows, Vienna
Choir Boy performances, Span
ish Riding School and many
sports events.
The shops and restaurants of
Vienna are world-famous for a
wide variety of fine merchandise
and foods and for the reasonable
prices.
The Austrians make good use
of their extensive mountain
chains for skiing in the winter
and hiking in the spring and
summer.
The slopes of central and west
ern Austria universally have fa
cilities for skiing and the young
sters everywhere will amaze
visitors with their prowess. Les
sons for amateurs are especially
excellent and standard.
Festivals
Festivals, dances, folk singing
and other excuses for partaking
of the fine Austrian beer round

out the many types of amuse
ment available to the Stanford
student.
Perhaps most important, how
ever, are the people themselves.
Austrians are among the friend
liest of Europeans and are eager
to meet Americans. It is quite
common for travelers to become
acquainted with them on trains
and buses or when simply sight
seeing.
The town of Semmering,
where Stanford campus is lo
cated, is situated in a rural
mountain area 60 miles west of
Vienna. The inhabitants are
mainly farmers and small store
keepers and number approxi
mately 700, spread over a fairly
large area on both sides of a
mountain pass.
In general, the populace is
conservative in behaviour and
manner and tends to be wary of
the American students for a
while. However, their reserve
quickly breaks down over a glass
of beer in one of the local "bier
stuben".
The town of Murzzuschlag, 17
kilometers away, is consider
ably larger than Semmering and
offers a broader cross-section of
Austrian society and concep
tions. There is a high-school in
Murzzuschlag and the students
are eager to meet the Ameri
cans and to challenge them in
basketball and soccer.
The climate in the mountains
is cold and snowy in the winter
and warm in the summer. The
spring can be rainy at Sem
mering and the fall is usually
sunny and brisk.
The Panhans Hotel provides

comfortable accomodations —
perhaps too comfortable. Be
cause the Hotel is accessible only
to the wealthy upper levels of
Austrian society, the people of
Semmering are quite naturally
cautious in forming friendships
with any of the Hotel guests in
cluding the Americans.
Opportunities
Educational opportunities
range from developing apprecia
tion for music and art, learning
how to ski and travelling widely
behind the Iron Curtain to the
real purpose of living in Aus
tria — knowing and understand
ing Austrians.
Yet all of these opportunities
will be largely precluded if the
student does not arrive at Sem
mering with certain preconceiv
ed goals. The greatest of these
is the intention to make a sin
cere effort in becoming acquaint
ed with Austrians.
Often it is up to the stu
dent to make the first advances
from which a profitable relation
ship can grow.
Yet it is all too easy to re
main within the sheltering walls
of the Panhans and thus limit
contact with the people of Sem
mering and Murzzuschlag dis
asterously. Nevertheless, even in
these cases, the experience of
living in close proximity with
80 students, half of whom are
members of the opposite sex,
can be educational.
Individual Responsibilty
In general, then, it is entirely
the responsibility of each in
dividual student to create a
profitable sojourn in Austria.
The greatest strength of the

Stanford Overseas Campus pro
gram lies in the simple fact of
presence in a foreign country for
six months. No other university
in America enables such a
great percentage of its student
body to study in Europe.
On the other hand, it is the
greatest weakness of this pro
gram that 80 students live and
study together as a group of
Americans in a foreign land.
Contact with the natives is
not innate in this system but
must be actively sought outside
the group. Those who do not
choose to create contact simply
do not experience contact and
must be considered to have
largely wasted their six months
stay.
In the case of Austria, contact
is made especially difficult due
to the aura of aristocracy sur
rounding the Panhans Hotel and
further by the relative isolation
from large segments of the Aus
trian population.
Hidden Strength
Yet paradoxically this frame
work of living and studying as a
group of Americans may become
the real hidden strength of the
Overseas Campus program. By
delegating responsibility to the
student himself for developing
his own contact with an alien
culture, the system creates a
much more personal relationship
with foreigners, one which
springs from genuine interest.
Each student must succeed or
fail on his or her own merits.
To the victors fall unquestion
ably one of the most rewarding
experiences of Stanford educa
tion.
