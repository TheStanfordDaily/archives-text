# USC FIRST BUT...
## UCLA Tops AAWU Stats

Although USC has two foot
ball games left to play, one
against Notre Dame next week
end and the other against Pur
due in the Rose Bowl on Janu
ary 2, the 1966 AAWU confer
ence race is over and the final
statistics have been tabulated.
Throughout the season it was
a battle between USC and UCLA

the Rose Bowl. USC won both.
Statistically the Bruins were
first in the conference with a
9-1 season record and topped
the league with an average of
374 yards per game in total
offense. However, the Trojans
were crowned conference
champs with their 4-1 league
record. UCLA had a 3-1 record.
Statistically Stanford stayed
in the middle of the pack but
finished last in the conference
with 14 record. The Indians
were fifth in the league with a
5-5 record.
One of the few bright spots

for the Indians this season was
Jack Root's third place finish
in the conference with 582 yards
gained rushing. Pete Pifer led
the conference with 1101, to be
come the first man in Pacific-
Eight football history to gain
1000 yards twice. Pifer also won
the conference scoring crown.
Although missing last week
end's game against USC, Gary
Beban of UCLA topped the lea
gue in total offense with 1699
yards. He gained 454 of these
rushing while compiling 1245
yards in the air. Beban was sec
ond in the conference in scor
ing with 64 points.
In passing Jerry Henderson of
Washington State had the most
pass completions, 95. However,
Troy Winslow, of USC, had the
best percentage having connect
ed on 57.9 per cent of his

passes. Dave Lewis of Stanford
was fourth in the conference
in passing percentage having
hit 53.8 per cent of his attempts.
Gene Washington had a 38.2 per
cent average.
Lewis failed to win the confer
ence punting title three years
in a row by coming in third place
with a 40.2 average behind Gary
Houser of OSIJ and Don Martin
of Washington. Houser won the
conference with a 42.6 average.
The University of Washington
produced one surprise in the
conference by leading everyone
in points scored. They led with
114 points to USC's 101. How
ever, the Huskies also gave up
t.he most points with 102 while
playing seven conference games.
They were the only team in the
AAWU that played each of the
teams in the conference.
