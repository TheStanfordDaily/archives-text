# Consensus Beats Staff In Daily Football Picks
## 
### 
The concensus won the 1966
football prediction race by two
games over resurgent Tom Edi
son, who rose from his last place
finish in 1965 to lead all the in
dividual predictors.
Due to a small (?) error by
the Predictor Planner, the final
standings are not available, be
cause the George Washington-
Villanova game still has to be
played Thanksgiving Day.
Neither first, nor second, nor
sixth place will be affected. But
second, third and fourth are still
messed up. Wells Shoemaker

(Sports Editor) has sixth place
clinched. But Joe Hernandez,
John Merrill, and Bob Thieriot
still have to fight it out. Her
na"ndez and Merrill picked
George Washington. Everyone
else picked Villanova.
The consensus won with 72
correct. Edison got 70, Hernan
dez 66, Merrill 67, Thieriot 66,
Shoemaker 64. Last year the
consensus did fairly poorly.
Thieriot won last year's race by
six games, with Merrill and
Hernandez tied for second. This
Is Wells Shoemaker's first year
in the prediction box.
Edison led most of the \yay
through the season, but with
three weeks remaining, there
was a four way tie for first wirt;
Thieriot 3 games behind in lasl"
the consensus was ahead of Hk
Individual predictors throughtur
