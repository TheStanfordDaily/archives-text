# The 						New Provost
## 
### 
We were pleased to learn yesterday that
President Sterling has filled the long-vacant
post of Vice-President and Provost. For more
than a year the administration's bureaucratic
machinery has churned without the aid of the
University's number two academic officer. With
the increased pressure of academic reform and
University expansion, the absence of the Provost
has meant increased work for the President's
Office.
We applaud the President's selection of
Richard W. Lyman. Lyman brings an open
mind to his new post and a first hand knowledge
of the problems affecting undergraduate educa
tion. He commented yesterday that the most
important requisite for his post was the ability
to learn. Lyman's list of committee assignments
leaves little question of his ability to tackle new
problems.

Lyman has served as Associate Dean of Hu
manities and Sciences for the past two years,
and has been a member of the Committee on
Undergraduate Education. While holding an
administrative position, he has continued to
teach and maintain his contact with under
graduates.
We strongly agree with the new Provost that
it is time for Stanford to move ahead. Lyman's
determination and the appointment of Herbert
L. Packer as Vice-Provost for Academic Plan
ning are assurances that the University is
seriously committed to consummating its flirta
tions with academic greatness.
Lyman sees no reason why the Provost's
office cannot take the lead in stimulating aca
demic innovations and improvement in the
quality of Stanford education. We sincerely
hope that the new Provost will exercise that
leadership.
