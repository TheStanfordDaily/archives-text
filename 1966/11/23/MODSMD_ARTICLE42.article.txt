## Kaplan Protests 'Slanted' Story; Reviews Legality Of Statements 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Your coverage of the discus
sion between Mr. Donner and
myself illustrates what happens
when a newspaper fails to con
trol its own biases. I have no
doubt that you and your report
er sided with Mr. Donner, whose
position you reported carefully
and accurately. However, when
a reporter covers a position
with which he or she does not
agree, and often does not quite
understand, that should be a
reason for listening more care
fully rather than less carefully.
To be specific, your coverage
of what I had to say was to my
mind a crude parody. For in
stance, you quote quite correct
ly my statement that "academic
freedom is a term that the
courts brush aside as soft-head
ed," but you do not point out
the preceding idea that the rea
son for this is that there is
nothing about "academic free
dom" in the constitution —
though there are of course cer
tain guarantees of freedom of
speech, etc.
Similarly, you are distorting
what I had to say when you as
sert: "Professor Kaplan dis
counted the importance of aca
demic freedom in his replies.
He stated that he was con
vinced that the subpoena was
valid despite Supreme Court de
cisions to the contrary."
It is true that I do not think
academic freedom is a relevant
legal consideration when a prop
erly constituted agency of gov
ernment subpoenas the member
ship list of a politically active
organization. If freedom of
speech and association protects
this type of list, that is one
thing, but it strikes me as not
discounting the importance of
academic freedom to say that
the law extends no further pro
tection. Of course very different
considerations would apply if
the committee had attempted to
subpoena a student's examina
tion or a professor's class notes
(and this was somewhat closer
to the issue at Haverford) but
in that case I think that, "aca
demic freedom" to one side, the
Constitution would protect —
and indeed require — a Univer
sity refusal.
Your reference to "despite Su
preme Court decisions to the
contrary" is your reporters'
(and Mr. Donner's) view of the
Supreme Court decisions not, as
one might think, mine. Mr. Don
ner lectured the audience of non
lawyers by reading them some
passages out of context from
cases that were not nearly as
relevant as others which pointed
clearly in the other direction.
I took the view that this was
an improper arguing of legal
principles to laymen. We require
three years at law school, not
just to kill time, but to instill
the competence to interpret
cases. I made very clear that so
far as I am concerned, there are
no Supreme Court decisions to
the contrary and I am willing to
stand on my position that when
and if it is ever litigated the
House Committee will be upheld
in its right to get this type of
Information.
Your quotation of me as say

ing, "The appropriate role of the
University is to let the student
and government fight it out," is
jso blatantly out of context that
I find it appalling. It so happens
that I do believe that in this
case the University should have
given the students notice so that
the students and the govern
ment could fight it out. The rea
son for this, though, has nothing
to do with the proper role of
the University generally, as
your quotation would make it
appear. Since I believe that the
University itself has no legal
right to refuse to comply, I do
not think the University should
use delaying tactics or abuse the
court system or fight cases in
bad faith. On the other hand, the
University should inform the
students concerned so that they
may be given the opportunity to
make meaningful their legal
right.
Of course, I realize that this
letter, concentrating as it does
on the legal issue—the main one
for discussion—leaves me open
to the charge that I have ig
nored all moral considerations.
The fact is I believe there are
strong moral issues involved
here and though there are some
on both sides, for me the deter
minative point is that a Univer
sity should not defy the lawful
— although perhaps morally
questionable — requirements of
a democratic government.
While it is true that my main
purpose is to point out the dis
tortions in my own views, I
should really point out that an
apology is due the University,
too. Your story asserts:
"Donner first mentioned that
he had contended in an article
in Nation that Stanford had not
even waited for the names to be
subpoenaed before turning them
over. He supported this conten
tion with evidence but added
that he would consider the
problem in the debate as if it
were not true."
A somewhat more forthright
account would have either left
this point out or pointed out
that Mr. Donner had adduced
said evidence. It consisted solely
of the fact that an FBI agent
and a HUAC representative
knew, in advance of the sub
poena, the partial contents of
the list demanded. The flimsi
ness of this evidence to prove—
or even to give reasonable
grounds to suspect—that the
University was untrue in its de
nial that it furnished the list in
advance of the subpoena is ap
parent, it would seem that if
Mr. Donner (who has elsewhere
asserted that the campus was
ridden with spies) did not wish
to apologize for making such a
serious charge on the basis of
such little evidence, then the
Dally should have either printed
the whole story or refrained
from asserting that he "sup
ported this contention with evi
dence."
I urge you, with these points
in mind, to re-read your story
and to see whether it inspires
you with a certain sense that
perhaps it is true that student
newspapers just like University
administrators do not always

have the time to think about
things before doing them.

• Emotional Sanction
Editor, The Daily:
I am writing in reference to
the article in today's (Nov. 18)
Daily entitled, "DONNER, KAP
LAN CLASH." In my opinion,
the extremely slanted report in
this article did a disservice in
two ways: (1) it deprived the
academic community of a fair
report of what happened; and
(2) it has given Professor Kap
lan the opportunity to rebut the
injustice done him and thereby
gain an unwarranted emotional
sanction for his views.
My observation was that Mr.
Donner made a sincere and de
liberate presentation suggesting
what he feels should be the
moral relationships between and
among the university adminis
tration, government bodies such
as HUAC, and students, and in
dicating legal steps which the
administration could have taken
to defend its moral position.
Mr. Kaplan answered, appar
ently extemporaneously and in
his characteristic omniscient,
omnisarcastic manner, by at
tacking Mr. Donner's legal con
clusions and by pointing out ap
parent inconsistencies in stu
dents' demands.
Mr. Kaplan did NOT discount
the importance of academic
freedom, however, but rather he
discounted there being a threat
to it. His "world view" seems to
be that people generally strive
for good and that their working
relationships are justly defined
by the Law, and so he feels that
the administration had to obey
the subpoena and that failure to
notify the students was most
probably an administrative mis
take.
I submit that the basic issue
between Mr. Donner and Mr.
Kaplan is not pro or con aca
demic freedom, or even whether
the one man is "paranoid" or
the other an "ego-maniac," but
rather whether moral relation
ships can be differentiated from
and even stand against legal re
lationships. Although Mr. Kap
lan could be right in this par
ticular case, his arguments ap
parently rest on a concept of
the LAW as being ultimately
just and moral in defining hu
man interactions, and this ten
dency to replace human relation
ships such as trust and loyality
with legal relationships is dis
turbing to me. No doubt Profes
sor Kaplan is "king" in a world
defined by complex legal rela
tions, but in such a world, the
more average man might be iso
lated from truth and justice.

• Stanford World View
Editor of the Daily:
I don't feel like stooping to
address you "Dear Sir" or even
by your name—l am just in
closing something that you
might possibly like to read.
Another student newspaper —
from a completely different
world than Stanford.
Three years ago I sent my

son to Stanford with the idea
that I was sending him to one
of the greatest schools in our
nation. As the years have
passed, I have subscribed to The
Stanford Daily and I have
watched him come home for
visits. He was a good clean cut
boy who wanted a good educa
tion more than anything.
Now, in his junior year, he
does not know what he wants.
His dress has become sloppy—
his hair worse. He talks radical
nonsense that he cannot back
up with any facts. I suppose he
is trying to be a carbon copy of
Dave Harris. I really don't
know. Even though he is my
son, I must admit he has be
come a socialistic slob. He no
longer knows what our country
stands for—any more than the
Stanford Daily does. His school
spirit is nil.
This fall, I sent my daughter,
a replica of my son three years
ago, off to George Washington
University at St. Louis, Mis
souri. This is the type of paper
I get from there. No word of
rebellion, no talks on "rights of
the students"—no marches or
picketing. She is weighted down
with classes and thrilled with
what she is learning. Her school
spirit could not be higher. The
papers are always full of things
just like this one.
What is going on on their
and other campuses. They are
well informed and high spirited.
Lots of times I think a lot of it
is nonsense, but this is what
college is for. To grow up, to
learn, to be able to tell the dif
ference from nonsense and fact
and fiction and Socialism and
Communism and a Democratic
world.
Your paper is quite influential
on campus. You should give
more thought to what you print,
unless you are deliberately try
ing to give the impression you
are giving. If your paper is giv
ing a true picture of Stanford
life, then I am sorry indeed that
my son is a part of it. We are
very seriously trying to get him
to transfer to an eastern univer
sity. More of Stanford, he does
not need.

a Fort Worth Mother.
• Hands Up!
Editor, The Dally:
Checking purses is not enough.
Perhaps the librarians at the
new Undergraduate Library
should frisk the students walk
ing past the check-out desk. Af
ter all, it's as easy to hide a
book under my coat as it is to
drop one into my purse.

NORMA DONALDSON
Editor, The Daily:
Your coverage of the discus
sion between Mr. Donner and
myself illustrates what happens
when a newspaper fails to con
trol its own biases. I have no
doubt that you and your report
er sided with Mr. Donner, whose
position you reported carefully
and accurately. However, when
a reporter covers a position
with which he or she does not
agree, and often does not quite
understand, that should be a
reason for listening more care
fully rather than less carefully.
To be specific, your coverage
of what I had to say was to my
mind a crude parody. For in
stance, you quote quite correct
ly my statement that "academic
freedom is a term that the
courts brush aside as soft-head
ed," but you do not point out
the preceding idea that the rea
son for this is that there is
nothing about "academic free
dom" in the constitution —
though there are of course cer
tain guarantees of freedom of
speech, etc.
Similarly, you are distorting
what I had to say when you as
sert: "Professor Kaplan dis
counted the importance of aca
demic freedom in his replies.
He stated that he was con
vinced that the subpoena was
valid despite Supreme Court de
cisions to the contrary."
It is true that I do not think
academic freedom is a relevant
legal consideration when a prop
erly constituted agency of gov
ernment subpoenas the member
ship list of a politically active
organization. If freedom of
speech and association protects
this type of list, that is one
thing, but it strikes me as not
discounting the importance of
academic freedom to say that
the law extends no further pro
tection. Of course very different
considerations would apply if
the committee had attempted to
subpoena a student's examina
tion or a professor's class notes
(and this was somewhat closer
to the issue at Haverford) but
in that case I think that, "aca
demic freedom" to one side, the
Constitution would protect —
and indeed require — a Univer
sity refusal.
Your reference to "despite Su
preme Court decisions to the
contrary" is your reporters'
(and Mr. Donner's) view of the
Supreme Court decisions not, as
one might think, mine. Mr. Don
ner lectured the audience of non
lawyers by reading them some
passages out of context from
cases that were not nearly as
relevant as others which pointed
clearly in the other direction.
I took the view that this was
an improper arguing of legal
principles to laymen. We require
three years at law school, not
just to kill time, but to instill
the competence to interpret
cases. I made very clear that so
far as I am concerned, there are
no Supreme Court decisions to
the contrary and I am willing to
stand on my position that when
and if it is ever litigated the
House Committee will be upheld
in its right to get this type of
Information.
Your quotation of me as say

ing, "The appropriate role of the
University is to let the student
and government fight it out," is
jso blatantly out of context that
I find it appalling. It so happens
that I do believe that in this
case the University should have
given the students notice so that
the students and the govern
ment could fight it out. The rea
son for this, though, has nothing
to do with the proper role of
the University generally, as
your quotation would make it
appear. Since I believe that the
University itself has no legal
right to refuse to comply, I do
not think the University should
use delaying tactics or abuse the
court system or fight cases in
bad faith. On the other hand, the
University should inform the
students concerned so that they
may be given the opportunity to
make meaningful their legal
right.
Of course, I realize that this
letter, concentrating as it does
on the legal issue—the main one
for discussion—leaves me open
to the charge that I have ig
nored all moral considerations.
The fact is I believe there are
strong moral issues involved
here and though there are some
on both sides, for me the deter
minative point is that a Univer
sity should not defy the lawful
— although perhaps morally
questionable — requirements of
a democratic government.
While it is true that my main
purpose is to point out the dis
tortions in my own views, I
should really point out that an
apology is due the University,
too. Your story asserts:
"Donner first mentioned that
he had contended in an article
in Nation that Stanford had not
even waited for the names to be
subpoenaed before turning them
over. He supported this conten
tion with evidence but added
that he would consider the
problem in the debate as if it
were not true."
A somewhat more forthright
account would have either left
this point out or pointed out
that Mr. Donner had adduced
said evidence. It consisted solely
of the fact that an FBI agent
and a HUAC representative
knew, in advance of the sub
poena, the partial contents of
the list demanded. The flimsi
ness of this evidence to prove—
or even to give reasonable
grounds to suspect—that the
University was untrue in its de
nial that it furnished the list in
advance of the subpoena is ap
parent, it would seem that if
Mr. Donner (who has elsewhere
asserted that the campus was
ridden with spies) did not wish
to apologize for making such a
serious charge on the basis of
such little evidence, then the
Dally should have either printed
the whole story or refrained
from asserting that he "sup
ported this contention with evi
dence."
I urge you, with these points
in mind, to re-read your story
and to see whether it inspires
you with a certain sense that
perhaps it is true that student
newspapers just like University
administrators do not always

have the time to think about
things before doing them.

• Emotional Sanction
Editor, The Daily:
I am writing in reference to
the article in today's (Nov. 18)
Daily entitled, "DONNER, KAP
LAN CLASH." In my opinion,
the extremely slanted report in
this article did a disservice in
two ways: (1) it deprived the
academic community of a fair
report of what happened; and
(2) it has given Professor Kap
lan the opportunity to rebut the
injustice done him and thereby
gain an unwarranted emotional
sanction for his views.
My observation was that Mr.
Donner made a sincere and de
liberate presentation suggesting
what he feels should be the
moral relationships between and
among the university adminis
tration, government bodies such
as HUAC, and students, and in
dicating legal steps which the
administration could have taken
to defend its moral position.
Mr. Kaplan answered, appar
ently extemporaneously and in
his characteristic omniscient,
omnisarcastic manner, by at
tacking Mr. Donner's legal con
clusions and by pointing out ap
parent inconsistencies in stu
dents' demands.
Mr. Kaplan did NOT discount
the importance of academic
freedom, however, but rather he
discounted there being a threat
to it. His "world view" seems to
be that people generally strive
for good and that their working
relationships are justly defined
by the Law, and so he feels that
the administration had to obey
the subpoena and that failure to
notify the students was most
probably an administrative mis
take.
I submit that the basic issue
between Mr. Donner and Mr.
Kaplan is not pro or con aca
demic freedom, or even whether
the one man is "paranoid" or
the other an "ego-maniac," but
rather whether moral relation
ships can be differentiated from
and even stand against legal re
lationships. Although Mr. Kap
lan could be right in this par
ticular case, his arguments ap
parently rest on a concept of
the LAW as being ultimately
just and moral in defining hu
man interactions, and this ten
dency to replace human relation
ships such as trust and loyality
with legal relationships is dis
turbing to me. No doubt Profes
sor Kaplan is "king" in a world
defined by complex legal rela
tions, but in such a world, the
more average man might be iso
lated from truth and justice.

Three years ago I sent my

son to Stanford with the idea
that I was sending him to one
of the greatest schools in our
nation. As the years have
passed, I have subscribed to The
Stanford Daily and I have
watched him come home for
visits. He was a good clean cut
boy who wanted a good educa
tion more than anything.
Now, in his junior year, he
does not know what he wants.
His dress has become sloppy—
his hair worse. He talks radical
nonsense that he cannot back
up with any facts. I suppose he
is trying to be a carbon copy of
Dave Harris. I really don't
know. Even though he is my

Editor of the Daily:
I don't feel like stooping to
address you "Dear Sir" or even
by your name—l am just in
closing something that you
might possibly like to read.
Another student newspaper —
from a completely different
world than Stanford.
Three years ago I sent my

son to Stanford with the idea
that I was sending him to one
of the greatest schools in our
nation. As the years have
passed, I have subscribed to The
Stanford Daily and I have
watched him come home for
visits. He was a good clean cut
boy who wanted a good educa
tion more than anything.
Now, in his junior year, he
does not know what he wants.
His dress has become sloppy—
his hair worse. He talks radical
nonsense that he cannot back
up with any facts. I suppose he
is trying to be a carbon copy of
Dave Harris. I really don't
know. Even though he is my
son, I must admit he has be
come a socialistic slob. He no
longer knows what our country
stands for—any more than the
Stanford Daily does. His school
spirit is nil.
This fall, I sent my daughter,
a replica of my son three years
ago, off to George Washington
University at St. Louis, Mis
souri. This is the type of paper
I get from there. No word of
rebellion, no talks on "rights of
the students"—no marches or
picketing. She is weighted down
with classes and thrilled with
what she is learning. Her school
spirit could not be higher. The
papers are always full of things
just like this one.
What is going on on their
and other campuses. They are
well informed and high spirited.
Lots of times I think a lot of it
is nonsense, but this is what
college is for. To grow up, to
learn, to be able to tell the dif
ference from nonsense and fact
and fiction and Socialism and
Communism and a Democratic
world.
Your paper is quite influential
on campus. You should give
more thought to what you print,
unless you are deliberately try
ing to give the impression you
are giving. If your paper is giv
ing a true picture of Stanford
life, then I am sorry indeed that
my son is a part of it. We are
very seriously trying to get him
to transfer to an eastern univer
sity. More of Stanford, he does
not need.

Editor, The Dally:

ter all, it's as easy to hide a
book under my coat as it is to

NORMA DONALDSON
Editor, The Daily:
Your coverage of the discus
sion between Mr. Donner and
myself illustrates what happens
when a newspaper fails to con
trol its own biases. I have no
doubt that you and your report
er sided with Mr. Donner, whose
position you reported carefully
and accurately. However, when
a reporter covers a position
with which he or she does not
agree, and often does not quite
understand, that should be a
reason for listening more care
fully rather than less carefully.
To be specific, your coverage
of what I had to say was to my
mind a crude parody. For in
stance, you quote quite correct
ly my statement that "academic
freedom is a term that the
courts brush aside as soft-head
ed," but you do not point out
the preceding idea that the rea
son for this is that there is
nothing about "academic free
dom" in the constitution —
though there are of course cer
tain guarantees of freedom of
speech, etc.
Similarly, you are distorting
what I had to say when you as
sert: "Professor Kaplan dis
counted the importance of aca
demic freedom in his replies.
He stated that he was con
vinced that the subpoena was
valid despite Supreme Court de
cisions to the contrary."
It is true that I do not think
academic freedom is a relevant
legal consideration when a prop
erly constituted agency of gov
ernment subpoenas the member
ship list of a politically active
organization. If freedom of
speech and association protects
this type of list, that is one
thing, but it strikes me as not
discounting the importance of
academic freedom to say that
the law extends no further pro
tection. Of course very different
considerations would apply if
the committee had attempted to
subpoena a student's examina
tion or a professor's class notes
(and this was somewhat closer
to the issue at Haverford) but
in that case I think that, "aca
demic freedom" to one side, the
Constitution would protect —
and indeed require — a Univer
sity refusal.
Your reference to "despite Su
preme Court decisions to the
contrary" is your reporters'
(and Mr. Donner's) view of the
Supreme Court decisions not, as
one might think, mine. Mr. Don
ner lectured the audience of non
lawyers by reading them some
passages out of context from
cases that were not nearly as
relevant as others which pointed
clearly in the other direction.
I took the view that this was
an improper arguing of legal
principles to laymen. We require
three years at law school, not
just to kill time, but to instill
the competence to interpret
cases. I made very clear that so
far as I am concerned, there are
no Supreme Court decisions to
the contrary and I am willing to
stand on my position that when
and if it is ever litigated the
House Committee will be upheld
in its right to get this type of
Information.
Your quotation of me as say

ing, "The appropriate role of the
University is to let the student
and government fight it out," is
jso blatantly out of context that
I find it appalling. It so happens
that I do believe that in this
case the University should have
given the students notice so that
the students and the govern
ment could fight it out. The rea
son for this, though, has nothing
to do with the proper role of
the University generally, as
your quotation would make it
appear. Since I believe that the
University itself has no legal
right to refuse to comply, I do
not think the University should
use delaying tactics or abuse the
court system or fight cases in
bad faith. On the other hand, the
University should inform the
students concerned so that they
may be given the opportunity to
make meaningful their legal
right.
Of course, I realize that this
letter, concentrating as it does
on the legal issue—the main one
for discussion—leaves me open
to the charge that I have ig
nored all moral considerations.
The fact is I believe there are
strong moral issues involved
here and though there are some
on both sides, for me the deter
minative point is that a Univer
sity should not defy the lawful
— although perhaps morally
questionable — requirements of
a democratic government.
While it is true that my main
purpose is to point out the dis
tortions in my own views, I
should really point out that an
apology is due the University,
too. Your story asserts:
"Donner first mentioned that
he had contended in an article
in Nation that Stanford had not
even waited for the names to be
subpoenaed before turning them
over. He supported this conten
tion with evidence but added
that he would consider the
problem in the debate as if it
were not true."
A somewhat more forthright
account would have either left
this point out or pointed out
that Mr. Donner had adduced
said evidence. It consisted solely
of the fact that an FBI agent
and a HUAC representative
knew, in advance of the sub
poena, the partial contents of
the list demanded. The flimsi
ness of this evidence to prove—
or even to give reasonable
grounds to suspect—that the
University was untrue in its de
nial that it furnished the list in
advance of the subpoena is ap
parent, it would seem that if
Mr. Donner (who has elsewhere
asserted that the campus was
ridden with spies) did not wish
to apologize for making such a
serious charge on the basis of
such little evidence, then the
Dally should have either printed
the whole story or refrained
from asserting that he "sup
ported this contention with evi
dence."
I urge you, with these points
in mind, to re-read your story
and to see whether it inspires
you with a certain sense that
perhaps it is true that student
newspapers just like University
administrators do not always

have the time to think about
things before doing them.

• Emotional Sanction
Editor, The Daily:
I am writing in reference to
the article in today's (Nov. 18)
Daily entitled, "DONNER, KAP
LAN CLASH." In my opinion,
the extremely slanted report in
this article did a disservice in
two ways: (1) it deprived the
academic community of a fair
report of what happened; and
(2) it has given Professor Kap
lan the opportunity to rebut the
injustice done him and thereby
gain an unwarranted emotional
sanction for his views.
My observation was that Mr.
Donner made a sincere and de
liberate presentation suggesting
what he feels should be the
moral relationships between and
among the university adminis
tration, government bodies such
as HUAC, and students, and in
dicating legal steps which the
administration could have taken
to defend its moral position.
Mr. Kaplan answered, appar
ently extemporaneously and in
his characteristic omniscient,
omnisarcastic manner, by at
tacking Mr. Donner's legal con
clusions and by pointing out ap
parent inconsistencies in stu
dents' demands.
Mr. Kaplan did NOT discount
the importance of academic
freedom, however, but rather he
discounted there being a threat
to it. His "world view" seems to
be that people generally strive
for good and that their working
relationships are justly defined
by the Law, and so he feels that
the administration had to obey
the subpoena and that failure to
notify the students was most
probably an administrative mis
take.
I submit that the basic issue
between Mr. Donner and Mr.
Kaplan is not pro or con aca
demic freedom, or even whether
the one man is "paranoid" or
the other an "ego-maniac," but
rather whether moral relation
ships can be differentiated from
and even stand against legal re
lationships. Although Mr. Kap
lan could be right in this par
ticular case, his arguments ap
parently rest on a concept of
the LAW as being ultimately

• Emotional Sanction
Editor, The Daily:
I am writing in reference to
the article in today's (Nov. 18)
Daily entitled, "DONNER, KAP
LAN CLASH." In my opinion,
the extremely slanted report in
this article did a disservice in
two ways: (1) it deprived the
academic community of a fair
report of what happened; and
(2) it has given Professor Kap
lan the opportunity to rebut the
injustice done him and thereby
gain an unwarranted emotional
sanction for his views.
My observation was that Mr.
Donner made a sincere and de
liberate presentation suggesting
what he feels should be the
moral relationships between and
among the university adminis
tration, government bodies such
as HUAC, and students, and in
dicating legal steps which the
administration could have taken
to defend its moral position.
Mr. Kaplan answered, appar
ently extemporaneously and in
his characteristic omniscient,
omnisarcastic manner, by at
tacking Mr. Donner's legal con
clusions and by pointing out ap
parent inconsistencies in stu
dents' demands.
Mr. Kaplan did NOT discount
the importance of academic
freedom, however, but rather he
discounted there being a threat
to it. His "world view" seems to
be that people generally strive
for good and that their working
relationships are justly defined
by the Law, and so he feels that
the administration had to obey
the subpoena and that failure to
notify the students was most
probably an administrative mis
take.
I submit that the basic issue
between Mr. Donner and Mr.
Kaplan is not pro or con aca
demic freedom, or even whether
the one man is "paranoid" or
the other an "ego-maniac," but
rather whether moral relation
ships can be differentiated from
and even stand against legal re
lationships. Although Mr. Kap
lan could be right in this par
ticular case, his arguments ap
parently rest on a concept of
the LAW as being ultimately
just and moral in defining hu
man interactions, and this ten
dency to replace human relation
ships such as trust and loyality
with legal relationships is dis
turbing to me. No doubt Profes
sor Kaplan is "king" in a world
defined by complex legal rela
tions, but in such a world, the
more average man might be iso
lated from truth and justice.

• Stanford World View
Editor of the Daily:
I don't feel like stooping to
address you "Dear Sir" or even
by your name—l am just in
closing something that you
might possibly like to read.
Another student newspaper —
from a completely different
world than Stanford.
Three years ago I sent my

son to Stanford with the idea
that I was sending him to one
of the greatest schools in our
nation. As the years have
passed, I have subscribed to The
Stanford Daily and I have
watched him come home for
visits. He was a good clean cut
boy who wanted a good educa
tion more than anything.
Now, in his junior year, he
does not know what he wants.
His dress has become sloppy—
his hair worse. He talks radical
nonsense that he cannot back
up with any facts. I suppose he
is trying to be a carbon copy of
Dave Harris. I really don't
know. Even though he is my
son, I must admit he has be
come a socialistic slob. He no
longer knows what our country
stands for—any more than the
Stanford Daily does. His school
spirit is nil.
This fall, I sent my daughter,
a replica of my son three years
ago, off to George Washington
University at St. Louis, Mis
souri. This is the type of paper
I get from there. No word of
rebellion, no talks on "rights of
the students"—no marches or
picketing. She is weighted down
with classes and thrilled with
what she is learning. Her school
spirit could not be higher. The
papers are always full of things
just like this one.
What is going on on their
and other campuses. They are
well informed and high spirited.
Lots of times I think a lot of it
is nonsense, but this is what
college is for. To grow up, to
learn, to be able to tell the dif
ference from nonsense and fact
and fiction and Socialism and
Communism and a Democratic
world.
Your paper is quite influential
on campus. You should give
more thought to what you print,
unless you are deliberately try
ing to give the impression you
are giving. If your paper is giv
ing a true picture of Stanford
life, then I am sorry indeed that
my son is a part of it. We are
very seriously trying to get him
to transfer to an eastern univer
sity. More of Stanford, he does
not need.

• Hands Up!
Editor, The Dally:
Checking purses is not enough.
Perhaps the librarians at the
new Undergraduate Library
should frisk the students walk
ing past the check-out desk. Af
ter all, it's as easy to hide a
book under my coat as it is to
drop one into my purse.
NORMA DONALDSON
Editor, The Daily:
Your coverage of the discus
sion between Mr. Donner and
myself illustrates what happens
when a newspaper fails to con
trol its own biases. I have no
doubt that you and your report
er sided with Mr. Donner, whose
position you reported carefully
and accurately. However, when
a reporter covers a position
with which he or she does not
agree, and often does not quite
understand, that should be a
reason for listening more care
fully rather than less carefully.
To be specific, your coverage
of what I had to say was to my
mind a crude parody. For in
stance, you quote quite correct
ly my statement that "academic
freedom is a term that the
courts brush aside as soft-head
ed," but you do not point out
the preceding idea that the rea
son for this is that there is
nothing about "academic free
dom" in the constitution —
though there are of course cer
tain guarantees of freedom of
speech, etc.
Similarly, you are distorting
what I had to say when you as
sert: "Professor Kaplan dis
counted the importance of aca
demic freedom in his replies.
He stated that he was con
vinced that the subpoena was
valid despite Supreme Court de
cisions to the contrary."
It is true that I do not think
academic freedom is a relevant
legal consideration when a prop
erly constituted agency of gov
ernment subpoenas the member
ship list of a politically active
organization. If freedom of
speech and association protects
this type of list, that is one
thing, but it strikes me as not
discounting the importance of
academic freedom to say that
the law extends no further pro
tection. Of course very different
considerations would apply if
the committee had attempted to
subpoena a student's examina
tion or a professor's class notes
(and this was somewhat closer
to the issue at Haverford) but
in that case I think that, "aca
demic freedom" to one side, the
Constitution would protect —
and indeed require — a Univer
sity refusal.
Your reference to "despite Su
preme Court decisions to the
contrary" is your reporters'
(and Mr. Donner's) view of the
Supreme Court decisions not, as
one might think, mine. Mr. Don
ner lectured the audience of non
lawyers by reading them some
passages out of context from
cases that were not nearly as
relevant as others which pointed
clearly in the other direction.
I took the view that this was
an improper arguing of legal
principles to laymen. We require
three years at law school, not
just to kill time, but to instill
the competence to interpret
cases. I made very clear that so
far as I am concerned, there are
no Supreme Court decisions to
the contrary and I am willing to
stand on my position that when
and if it is ever litigated the
House Committee will be upheld
in its right to get this type of
Information.
Your quotation of me as say

ing, "The appropriate role of the
University is to let the student
and government fight it out," is
jso blatantly out of context that
I find it appalling. It so happens
that I do believe that in this
case the University should have
given the students notice so that
the students and the govern
ment could fight it out. The rea
son for this, though, has nothing
to do with the proper role of
the University generally, as
your quotation would make it
appear. Since I believe that the
University itself has no legal
right to refuse to comply, I do
not think the University should
use delaying tactics or abuse the
court system or fight cases in
bad faith. On the other hand, the
University should inform the
students concerned so that they
may be given the opportunity to
make meaningful their legal
right.
Of course, I realize that this
letter, concentrating as it does
on the legal issue—the main one
for discussion—leaves me open
to the charge that I have ig
nored all moral considerations.
The fact is I believe there are
strong moral issues involved
here and though there are some
on both sides, for me the deter
minative point is that a Univer
sity should not defy the lawful
— although perhaps morally
questionable — requirements of
a democratic government.
While it is true that my main
purpose is to point out the dis
tortions in my own views, I
should really point out that an
apology is due the University,
too. Your story asserts:
"Donner first mentioned that
he had contended in an article
in Nation that Stanford had not
even waited for the names to be
subpoenaed before turning them
over. He supported this conten
tion with evidence but added
that he would consider the
problem in the debate as if it
were not true."
A somewhat more forthright
account would have either left
this point out or pointed out
that Mr. Donner had adduced
said evidence. It consisted solely
of the fact that an FBI agent
and a HUAC representative
knew, in advance of the sub
poena, the partial contents of
the list demanded. The flimsi
ness of this evidence to prove—
or even to give reasonable
grounds to suspect—that the
University was untrue in its de
nial that it furnished the list in
advance of the subpoena is ap
parent, it would seem that if
Mr. Donner (who has elsewhere
asserted that the campus was
ridden with spies) did not wish
to apologize for making such a
serious charge on the basis of
such little evidence, then the
Dally should have either printed
the whole story or refrained
from asserting that he "sup
ported this contention with evi
dence."
I urge you, with these points
in mind, to re-read your story
and to see whether it inspires
you with a certain sense that
perhaps it is true that student
newspapers just like University
administrators do not always

have the time to think about
things before doing them.

While it is true that my main
purpose is to point out the dis
tortions in my own views, I
should really point out that an
apology is due the University,
too. Your story asserts:
"Donner first mentioned that
he had contended in an article
in Nation that Stanford had not
even waited for the names to be
subpoenaed before turning them
over. He supported this conten
tion with evidence but added
that he would consider the
problem in the debate as if it
were not true."
A somewhat more forthright
account would have either left
this point out or pointed out
that Mr. Donner had adduced
said evidence. It consisted solely
of the fact that an FBI agent
and a HUAC representative
knew, in advance of the sub
poena, the partial contents of
the list demanded. The flimsi
ness of this evidence to prove—
or even to give reasonable
grounds to suspect—that the
University was untrue in its de
nial that it furnished the list in
advance of the subpoena is ap
parent, it would seem that if
Mr. Donner (who has elsewhere
asserted that the campus was
ridden with spies) did not wish
to apologize for making such a
serious charge on the basis of
such little evidence, then the
Dally should have either printed
the whole story or refrained
from asserting that he "sup
ported this contention with evi
dence."
I urge you, with these points
in mind, to re-read your story
and to see whether it inspires
you with a certain sense that
perhaps it is true that student
newspapers just like University
administrators do not always

have the time to think about
things before doing them.

• Emotional Sanction
Editor, The Daily:
I am writing in reference to
the article in today's (Nov. 18)
Daily entitled, "DONNER, KAP
LAN CLASH." In my opinion,
the extremely slanted report in
this article did a disservice in
two ways: (1) it deprived the
academic community of a fair
report of what happened; and
(2) it has given Professor Kap
lan the opportunity to rebut the
injustice done him and thereby
gain an unwarranted emotional
sanction for his views.
My observation was that Mr.
Donner made a sincere and de
liberate presentation suggesting
what he feels should be the
moral relationships between and
among the university adminis
tration, government bodies such
as HUAC, and students, and in
dicating legal steps which the
administration could have taken
to defend its moral position.
Mr. Kaplan answered, appar
ently extemporaneously and in
his characteristic omniscient,
omnisarcastic manner, by at
tacking Mr. Donner's legal con
clusions and by pointing out ap
parent inconsistencies in stu
dents' demands.
Mr. Kaplan did NOT discount
the importance of academic
freedom, however, but rather he
discounted there being a threat
to it. His "world view" seems to
be that people generally strive
for good and that their working
relationships are justly defined
by the Law, and so he feels that
the administration had to obey
the subpoena and that failure to
notify the students was most
probably an administrative mis
take.
I submit that the basic issue
between Mr. Donner and Mr.
Kaplan is not pro or con aca
demic freedom, or even whether
the one man is "paranoid" or
the other an "ego-maniac," but
rather whether moral relation
ships can be differentiated from
and even stand against legal re
lationships. Although Mr. Kap
lan could be right in this par
ticular case, his arguments ap
parently rest on a concept of
the LAW as being ultimately
just and moral in defining hu
man interactions, and this ten
dency to replace human relation
ships such as trust and loyality
with legal relationships is dis
turbing to me. No doubt Profes
sor Kaplan is "king" in a world
defined by complex legal rela
tions, but in such a world, the
more average man might be iso
lated from truth and justice.

Editor of the Daily:
I don't feel like stooping to
address you "Dear Sir" or even
by your name—l am just in
closing something that you
might possibly like to read.
Another student newspaper —
from a completely different
world than Stanford.
Three years ago I sent my

son to Stanford with the idea
that I was sending him to one
of the greatest schools in our
nation. As the years have
passed, I have subscribed to The
Stanford Daily and I have
watched him come home for
visits. He was a good clean cut
boy who wanted a good educa
tion more than anything.
Now, in his junior year, he
does not know what he wants.
His dress has become sloppy—
his hair worse. He talks radical
nonsense that he cannot back
up with any facts. I suppose he
is trying to be a carbon copy of
Dave Harris. I really don't
know. Even though he is my
son, I must admit he has be
come a socialistic slob. He no
longer knows what our country
stands for—any more than the
Stanford Daily does. His school
spirit is nil.
This fall, I sent my daughter,
a replica of my son three years
ago, off to George Washington
University at St. Louis, Mis
souri. This is the type of paper
I get from there. No word of
rebellion, no talks on "rights of
the students"—no marches or
picketing. She is weighted down
with classes and thrilled with
what she is learning. Her school
spirit could not be higher. The
papers are always full of things
just like this one.
What is going on on their
and other campuses. They are
well informed and high spirited.
Lots of times I think a lot of it
is nonsense, but this is what
college is for. To grow up, to
learn, to be able to tell the dif
ference from nonsense and fact
and fiction and Socialism and
Communism and a Democratic
world.
Your paper is quite influential
on campus. You should give
more thought to what you print,
unless you are deliberately try
ing to give the impression you
are giving. If your paper is giv
ing a true picture of Stanford
life, then I am sorry indeed that
my son is a part of it. We are
very seriously trying to get him
to transfer to an eastern univer
sity. More of Stanford, he does
not need.

• Hands Up!
Editor, The Dally:
Checking purses is not enough.
Perhaps the librarians at the
new Undergraduate Library
should frisk the students walk
ing past the check-out desk. Af
ter all, it's as easy to hide a
book under my coat as it is to

NORMA DONALDSON
Editor, The Daily:
Your coverage of the discus
sion between Mr. Donner and
myself illustrates what happens
when a newspaper fails to con
trol its own biases. I have no
doubt that you and your report
er sided with Mr. Donner, whose
position you reported carefully
and accurately. However, when
a reporter covers a position
with which he or she does not
agree, and often does not quite
understand, that should be a
reason for listening more care
fully rather than less carefully.
To be specific, your coverage
of what I had to say was to my
mind a crude parody. For in
stance, you quote quite correct
ly my statement that "academic
freedom is a term that the
courts brush aside as soft-head
ed," but you do not point out
the preceding idea that the rea
son for this is that there is
nothing about "academic free
dom" in the constitution —
though there are of course cer
tain guarantees of freedom of
speech, etc.
Similarly, you are distorting
what I had to say when you as
sert: "Professor Kaplan dis
counted the importance of aca
demic freedom in his replies.
He stated that he was con
vinced that the subpoena was
valid despite Supreme Court de
cisions to the contrary."
It is true that I do not think
academic freedom is a relevant
legal consideration when a prop
erly constituted agency of gov
ernment subpoenas the member
ship list of a politically active
organization. If freedom of
speech and association protects
this type of list, that is one
thing, but it strikes me as not
discounting the importance of
academic freedom to say that
the law extends no further pro
tection. Of course very different
considerations would apply if
the committee had attempted to
subpoena a student's examina
tion or a professor's class notes
(and this was somewhat closer
to the issue at Haverford) but
in that case I think that, "aca
demic freedom" to one side, the
Constitution would protect —
and indeed require — a Univer
sity refusal.
Your reference to "despite Su
preme Court decisions to the
contrary" is your reporters'
(and Mr. Donner's) view of the
Supreme Court decisions not, as
one might think, mine. Mr. Don
ner lectured the audience of non
lawyers by reading them some
passages out of context from
cases that were not nearly as
relevant as others which pointed
clearly in the other direction.
I took the view that this was
an improper arguing of legal
principles to laymen. We require
three years at law school, not
just to kill time, but to instill
the competence to interpret
cases. I made very clear that so
far as I am concerned, there are
no Supreme Court decisions to
the contrary and I am willing to
stand on my position that when
and if it is ever litigated the
House Committee will be upheld
in its right to get this type of
Information.
Your quotation of me as say

ing, "The appropriate role of the
University is to let the student
and government fight it out," is
jso blatantly out of context that
I find it appalling. It so happens
that I do believe that in this
case the University should have
given the students notice so that
the students and the govern
ment could fight it out. The rea
son for this, though, has nothing
to do with the proper role of
the University generally, as
your quotation would make it
appear. Since I believe that the
University itself has no legal
right to refuse to comply, I do
not think the University should
use delaying tactics or abuse the
court system or fight cases in
bad faith. On the other hand, the
University should inform the
students concerned so that they
may be given the opportunity to
make meaningful their legal
right.
Of course, I realize that this
letter, concentrating as it does
on the legal issue—the main one
for discussion—leaves me open
to the charge that I have ig
nored all moral considerations.
The fact is I believe there are
strong moral issues involved
here and though there are some
on both sides, for me the deter
minative point is that a Univer
sity should not defy the lawful
— although perhaps morally
questionable — requirements of
a democratic government.
While it is true that my main
purpose is to point out the dis
tortions in my own views, I
should really point out that an
apology is due the University,
too. Your story asserts:

three years at law school, not
just to kill time, but to instill
the competence to interpret
cases. I made very clear that so
far as I am concerned, there are
no Supreme Court decisions to
the contrary and I am willing to
stand on my position that when
and if it is ever litigated the
House Committee will be upheld
in its right to get this type of
Information.
Your quotation of me as say

ing, "The appropriate role of the
University is to let the student
and government fight it out," is
jso blatantly out of context that
I find it appalling. It so happens
that I do believe that in this
case the University should have
given the students notice so that
the students and the govern
ment could fight it out. The rea
son for this, though, has nothing
to do with the proper role of
the University generally, as
your quotation would make it
appear. Since I believe that the
University itself has no legal
right to refuse to comply, I do
not think the University should
use delaying tactics or abuse the
court system or fight cases in
bad faith. On the other hand, the
University should inform the
students concerned so that they
may be given the opportunity to
make meaningful their legal
right.
Of course, I realize that this
letter, concentrating as it does
on the legal issue—the main one
for discussion—leaves me open
to the charge that I have ig
nored all moral considerations.
The fact is I believe there are
strong moral issues involved
here and though there are some
on both sides, for me the deter
minative point is that a Univer
sity should not defy the lawful
— although perhaps morally
questionable — requirements of
a democratic government.
While it is true that my main
purpose is to point out the dis
tortions in my own views, I
should really point out that an
apology is due the University,
too. Your story asserts:
"Donner first mentioned that
he had contended in an article
in Nation that Stanford had not
even waited for the names to be
subpoenaed before turning them
over. He supported this conten
tion with evidence but added
that he would consider the
problem in the debate as if it
were not true."
A somewhat more forthright
account would have either left
this point out or pointed out
that Mr. Donner had adduced
said evidence. It consisted solely
of the fact that an FBI agent
and a HUAC representative
knew, in advance of the sub
poena, the partial contents of
the list demanded. The flimsi
ness of this evidence to prove—
or even to give reasonable
grounds to suspect—that the
University was untrue in its de
nial that it furnished the list in
advance of the subpoena is ap
parent, it would seem that if
Mr. Donner (who has elsewhere
asserted that the campus was
ridden with spies) did not wish
to apologize for making such a
serious charge on the basis of
such little evidence, then the
Dally should have either printed
the whole story or refrained
from asserting that he "sup
ported this contention with evi
dence."
I urge you, with these points
in mind, to re-read your story
and to see whether it inspires
you with a certain sense that
perhaps it is true that student
newspapers just like University
administrators do not always

have the time to think about
things before doing them.

Associate Professor of Law
• Emotional Sanction
Editor, The Daily:
I am writing in reference to
the article in today's (Nov. 18)
Daily entitled, "DONNER, KAP
LAN CLASH." In my opinion,
the extremely slanted report in
this article did a disservice in
two ways: (1) it deprived the
academic community of a fair
report of what happened; and
(2) it has given Professor Kap
lan the opportunity to rebut the
injustice done him and thereby
gain an unwarranted emotional
sanction for his views.
My observation was that Mr.
Donner made a sincere and de
liberate presentation suggesting
what he feels should be the
moral relationships between and
among the university adminis
tration, government bodies such
as HUAC, and students, and in
dicating legal steps which the
administration could have taken
to defend its moral position.
Mr. Kaplan answered, appar
ently extemporaneously and in
his characteristic omniscient,
omnisarcastic manner, by at
tacking Mr. Donner's legal con
clusions and by pointing out ap
parent inconsistencies in stu
dents' demands.
Mr. Kaplan did NOT discount
the importance of academic
freedom, however, but rather he
discounted there being a threat
to it. His "world view" seems to
be that people generally strive
for good and that their working
relationships are justly defined
by the Law, and so he feels that
the administration had to obey
the subpoena and that failure to
notify the students was most
probably an administrative mis
take.
I submit that the basic issue
between Mr. Donner and Mr.
Kaplan is not pro or con aca
demic freedom, or even whether
the one man is "paranoid" or
the other an "ego-maniac," but
rather whether moral relation
ships can be differentiated from
and even stand against legal re
lationships. Although Mr. Kap
lan could be right in this par
ticular case, his arguments ap
parently rest on a concept of
the LAW as being ultimately
just and moral in defining hu
man interactions, and this ten
dency to replace human relation
ships such as trust and loyality
with legal relationships is dis
turbing to me. No doubt Profes
sor Kaplan is "king" in a world
defined by complex legal rela
tions, but in such a world, the
more average man might be iso
lated from truth and justice.

• Stanford World View
Editor of the Daily:
I don't feel like stooping to
address you "Dear Sir" or even
by your name—l am just in
closing something that you
might possibly like to read.
Another student newspaper —
from a completely different
world than Stanford.
Three years ago I sent my

son to Stanford with the idea
that I was sending him to one
of the greatest schools in our
nation. As the years have
passed, I have subscribed to The
Stanford Daily and I have
watched him come home for
visits. He was a good clean cut
boy who wanted a good educa
tion more than anything.
Now, in his junior year, he
does not know what he wants.
His dress has become sloppy—
his hair worse. He talks radical
nonsense that he cannot back
up with any facts. I suppose he
is trying to be a carbon copy of
Dave Harris. I really don't
know. Even though he is my
son, I must admit he has be
come a socialistic slob. He no
longer knows what our country
stands for—any more than the
Stanford Daily does. His school
spirit is nil.
This fall, I sent my daughter,
a replica of my son three years
ago, off to George Washington
University at St. Louis, Mis
souri. This is the type of paper
I get from there. No word of
rebellion, no talks on "rights of
the students"—no marches or
picketing. She is weighted down
with classes and thrilled with
what she is learning. Her school
spirit could not be higher. The
papers are always full of things
just like this one.
What is going on on their
and other campuses. They are
well informed and high spirited.
Lots of times I think a lot of it
is nonsense, but this is what
college is for. To grow up, to
learn, to be able to tell the dif
ference from nonsense and fact
and fiction and Socialism and
Communism and a Democratic
world.
Your paper is quite influential
on campus. You should give
more thought to what you print,
unless you are deliberately try
ing to give the impression you
are giving. If your paper is giv
ing a true picture of Stanford
life, then I am sorry indeed that
my son is a part of it. We are
very seriously trying to get him
to transfer to an eastern univer
sity. More of Stanford, he does
not need.

• Hands Up!
Editor, The Dally:
Checking purses is not enough.
Perhaps the librarians at the
new Undergraduate Library
should frisk the students walk
ing past the check-out desk. Af
ter all, it's as easy to hide a
book under my coat as it is to
drop one into my purse.
