# Two Minutes of Haight
## Why Play Pre-Reg Bingo 
### Tim Haight 
It's pre-reg time and time to
ask yourself what kind of an
education you want.
Do you feel that your time in
lectures is mostly wasted? Or
that you don't have time to go
into anything in depth on your
own? Take some directed read
ing next quarter.
It's not that difficult. Most, if
not all, departments have a
course number designated for
directed reading. Professors will
balk if you want an hour of
their time every week, but most
will give you a reading list and
grade a paper or an exam for
you. All you have to do is accept
the responsibility for your own
education.
Honors-Type
If a lot of people begin doing
directed reading, many depart
ments will be encouraged
enough to give it credit toward
their major requirements. Also,
some may institutionalize hon
ors-type independent study for
non-honors students who have
the desire for that kind of work.
Do you feel that examinations
do not fairly measure your per
formance? Go to your profes
sors now and offer an alterna
tive — a paper, a take-home
exam, whatever you think is a
fair measure. Do not be afraid
of "the system": many courses
have no finals now. But a de
facto system will continue until
students demonstrate at the
grass-roots level that we want
a better education.
All the Dave Harrises in the
world could not change the cur
riculum here as fast as if every
student took the initiative to
get some new way of studying
into his program next quarter.

How about more interdiscipli
nary work? Did you know that
any group of students who can
get a professor to teach can set
up a two-unit course on the sub
ject of their choice as an Under
graduate Special? The only lim
itation is that not more than
50% of the students in the
course can come from one liv
ing group. See Dean Robert
Hind for details.
Do you perchance feel ham
strung by major and general
studies requirements? Go to
your department, and offer an
alternative.

Freshmen please note: God
did not will you to take nothing
except English, Civ, language or
math, and Science this year.
Even if you are in a Freshman
Seminar, consider taking some
course in a field of interest that
you were thinking of taking
next year. You might really en
joy loosening up your schedule
from the usual freshman grind.
Don't be afraid of a course with
upperclassmen; many of them
are afraid of courses with red
hot industrious freshmen.
Every department in the Uni
versity should have a permanent
curriculum committee with stu
dents on it. The way to get this
organized is for students in the
department to bug their profes
sors until they organize it, or
for a group of students to take
their own departmental survey.
As long as the self-effacing,
non-raging Stanford student
doesn't take the initiative to im
prove his own system of educa
tion, faculties will believe he
doesn't care. And then they
won't care, either. Dave Harris
can make the professor contem
plate some ideas in education,
but the student in his office has
the best chance of making him
change it.
Second Stop
Naturally, some professors
and some programs will still
restrict you. Some of you may
be turned down. Then go to
Harris' office. He will be happy
to co-ordinate any efforts need
ed for formal, structural change.
Part of the reason for the
waste of potential at Stanford is
the vicious circle where profes
sors do not encourage creativity
because they do not see it and
students do not display creativi
ty because it isn't encouraged.

If a lot of people begin doing

enough to give it credit toward

Do you feel that examinations
do not fairly measure your per

fair measure. Do not be afraid
of "the system": many courses
have no finals now. But a de

students demonstrate at the
grass-roots level that we want
a better education.

any group of students who can
get a professor to teach can set
up a two-unit course on the sub
