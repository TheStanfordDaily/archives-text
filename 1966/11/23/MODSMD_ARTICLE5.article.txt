# Anything Can Happen In The Wilburness
## 
### BENTON ROLPH 
Let there be a Happening in the
Wilburness. And let this Happening
be mightier than any and all parties,
scenes, soirees that Stanford has ever
known.
And let the Happening start in all
of Wilbur Hall at 8 p.m. on Saturday,
December 3 and last for a night, a
week, or a year, whatever shall be.
Each of the eight houses in the
Wilburness has a lounge and a dining
room. And for these sixteen areas the
freshmen of Wilbur are planning a
phantasmagoria ot scenes and spec
tacles.
Music, Music, Music
Big Brother and the Holding Com
pany will descend into the Wilburness
to play hard-rock for flying, sinning,
dancing, spinning. Taking off with the
Holding Company will be a second
group, the San Andreas Fault Finders,
whose sound echoes that of Paul But
terfield. Bill Ham who runs the extra
psychic effects at the Fillmore Audi
torium will provide the glycerine and
strobe lightshow to accompany the
two bands.
Bernie Gunther, from Big Sur, an
expert in the field of physical com
munication, will conduct a festival of
sensory awareness in the Madera
Lounge.
Back To The Womb
Trancos invites everyone to return
to the womb in the undulating soft
ness of the house lounge. Toys and
sandboxes will be there to speed one's
voyage into the past. In addition to
Playdough, Tinker Toys and finger
paints, ultra-violet mattresses will
facilitate a euphoric return to nirvana
and pre-existence.
Junipero House, whose President,
H. Levinson, heads the Inter-Wilbur
Council and is the creater of the Hap
pening, will have films that can only
be called wild, excitingly weird. Any
one who has films of this ilk may
bring them to have them screened.
Spontaneous Creation Anybody?
A mass of paper-mache and buckets
of paint will be available in the Cedro
Lounge for anyone's passions of in
vention. A moo-cow, alive, and a car,
dead, will be standing outside the
lounge. The cow is for loving; the car,
smashing. Inside a ballet artist will
dance through the paint and the paint
ers in a number that features the peel
ing of bananas. An ocean of cereal
boxes will beckon anyone to drown.
A jazz quartet, led by Stanford grad

student Michael Menke will create
soul, rhythm and blues in the Cedro
dining hall.
Otero House will stage a spontan
eous jam-session. A group of Otero
guitar players and drummers will pro
vide the initial sound. Everyone who
can play may bring his instrument
and join in. Kazoos and harmonicas
will be provided for those who don't
own an instrument.
There will be absolute darkness in
the Soto House Lounge except for a
blue spotlight on a flutist and a red
one on a conga player.
The Happening in the Wilburness is
open to anyone who can hear the
Sirens, and has one dollar.

lounge. The cow is for loving; the car,
smashing. Inside a ballet artist will
dance through the paint and the paint
ers in a number that features the peel
ing of bananas. An ocean of cereal
boxes will beckon anyone to drown.
A jazz quartet, led by Stanford grad

student Michael Menke will create
soul, rhythm and blues in the Cedro
dining hall.
Otero House will stage a spontan
eous jam-session. A group of Otero
guitar players and drummers will pro
vide the initial sound. Everyone who
can play may bring his instrument
and join in. Kazoos and harmonicas
will be provided for those who don't
own an instrument.
There will be absolute darkness in
the Soto House Lounge except for a
blue spotlight on a flutist and a red
one on a conga player.
The Happening in the Wilburness is
open to anyone who can hear the
Sirens, and has one dollar.
Let there be a Happening in the
Wilburness. And let this Happening
be mightier than any and all parties,
scenes, soirees that Stanford has ever
known.
And let the Happening start in all
of Wilbur Hall at 8 p.m. on Saturday,
December 3 and last for a night, a
week, or a year, whatever shall be.
Each of the eight houses in the
Wilburness has a lounge and a dining
room. And for these sixteen areas the
freshmen of Wilbur are planning a
phantasmagoria ot scenes and spec
tacles.
Music, Music, Music
Big Brother and the Holding Com
pany will descend into the Wilburness
to play hard-rock for flying, sinning,
dancing, spinning. Taking off with the
Holding Company will be a second

terfield. Bill Ham who runs the extra
psychic effects at the Fillmore Audi
torium will provide the glycerine and
strobe lightshow to accompany the
two bands.
Bernie Gunther, from Big Sur, an
expert in the field of physical com
munication, will conduct a festival of
sensory awareness in the Madera
Lounge.
Back To The Womb
Trancos invites everyone to return
to the womb in the undulating soft
ness of the house lounge. Toys and
sandboxes will be there to speed one's
voyage into the past. In addition to
Playdough, Tinker Toys and finger
paints, ultra-violet mattresses will
facilitate a euphoric return to nirvana
and pre-existence.
Junipero House, whose President,
H. Levinson, heads the Inter-Wilbur
Council and is the creater of the Hap
pening, will have films that can only
be called wild, excitingly weird. Any
one who has films of this ilk may
bring them to have them screened.
Spontaneous Creation Anybody?
A mass of paper-mache and buckets
of paint will be available in the Cedro
Lounge for anyone's passions of in
vention. A moo-cow, alive, and a car,
dead, will be standing outside the
lounge. The cow is for loving; the car,
smashing. Inside a ballet artist will
dance through the paint and the paint
ers in a number that features the peel
ing of bananas. An ocean of cereal
