# Need For Overseas Judicial Procedure Revision
## 
### GAIL ANDERSON (fourth in a series) 
"There is an element of trust overseas be
" 'tween the Director in charge of student affairs
fand the student judicial body," noted Assist
ant Director of Overseas Campuses Bob
'Hamrdla.
n "The Director appreciates the students'
.closeness to the problem; the students appre
ji ciate the Director's experience and knowledge
,jjwhich ho applies to the situation."
mr Hamrdla, who has been both a director at
overseas campus and a student member of
ii aii overseas judicial council, pointed out one
' reason why difficulties of overseas judicial
,, -procedure do not concern the structure itself
j, |but its relation to the system on the Stanford
campus.
Overseas Procedure
y' The judicial procedure overseas operates
roughly the same as the home campus system.
The student judicial body consists of the cabi

net, or officers, of the campus, plus two elected
judicial representatives.
The addition of these representatives, one
man and one woman, came about as a result
of the recent re-evaluation of the judicial sys
tem. Before the group leaves for overseas, the
two representatives are briefed on judicial
procedure by members of the ASSU Judicial
Council. They are then responsible for in
structing the other cabinet members on as
pects of procedure and for making sure these
are followed.
As on the home campus, a student charged
with a violation has the option of being tried
by students or an administrator. In this case
the Director in charge of student affairs acts
in the capacity the Dean of Students fulfills
on the home campus. Otherwise, the case goes
through the channels of student trial similar
to the proceeding of the Judicial Council.
Possible penalties recommended by the ju
dicial council may include probation, service
functions (such as working in the orphanage

at Tours), suspension of weekend privileges,
or in serious cases suspension or expulsion.
The two directors of the overseas campus
and the resident faculty members from the
home campus serve as board of review for
serious cases and for appeals. If the recom
mendation of the student judicial council is
for suspension, for example, the Review
Board automatically considers it. It also acts
as the appeals mechanism for the campus.
In other cases only approval by the Director
is necessary for the recommended action to go
into effect.
Review Board
If the Review Board feels the student rec
ommendation is either too lenient or too strict,
they can remand the case to the student coun
cil for reconsideration. They can either accept
a new recommendation from the students or
submit one of their own to the Director of
Overseas Campuses and through him to the
Dean of Students.
If a student has chosen to take his case

through the Director, he may also appeal to
the Review Board, but such a case cannot be
remanded to the student judicial council.
If a student is dissatisfied with the final de
cision of the overseas campus director, he
may, according to the memo issued by the
Overseas Campus office, appeal to the Dean
of Students. However, Dean Winbigler main
tains that in such a case, unless the penalty
extends past the period of the overseas ses
sion, the overseas director is the ultimate au
thority. He says that in such a case the home
campus structuie is not involved.
Morse Case
The ASSU Constitution and Bylaws pro
vides that if a violation occurs within 10 days
before the end of the second quarter, "appeal
of decisions shall be taken as a matter of
right to the Judicial Council."
In the Frank Morse case the violation oc
curred on the last day of the overseas session,
yet the Judicial Council was not given juris
diction. The appeal instead went directly to

Dean Winbigler. The Council thought it should
have gone to them and held an open hearing
to retry the case. This incident touched off
the investigation of the Dean's role in judicial
procedures.
Since then the Interim Judicial Board (IJB)
has been set up as the campus appeal mech
anism, but no one knows its relation to over
seas campus decisions.
TtÂ«t Case Needed
In a case where penalty exceeds the dura
tion of the session, Dean Winbigler maintains
it is handled through ordinary judicial pro
cedure, beginning with the Judicial Council.
The current IJB policy maintains that such
an appeal can only be to the IJB.
The overseas campus office insists it may
be only to the Dean.
It seems that, if the past is any indicator,
a test case will probably be required to resolve
this difficulty. But if the overseas structure is
working as well as everyone says it is, it may
be a long time before such a case occurs.
