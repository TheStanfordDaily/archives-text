# Co-operation Brings Imaginative' Changes
## 
### CHRISTOPHER HARGROVE 
The History Department has extensively
revised the requirements for a history major
this fall. The revision, described by department
head David Potter as, "one of the most imag
inative changes the department has made in
a number of years," will affect all students
graduating later than winter quarter, 1968.
Students graduating before this time may
elect the new program if they desire, however.
Three major changes are involved: first, all
students will take a Comparative Reading
course which will be identical for all, regard
less of areas of individual interest. Each year
the department will draw up a list of books
dealing with some broad topic. From Jan
uary to June, for 10 units, the students will
be on their own—no papers, no classes. And
in June, everyone will take the same four
hour exam on what they have read.
The second major change involves the Basic
Seminar program. Beginning this year, His
tory majors will take the seminar in their
junior year. More important, the seminars

have been made more uniform and will deal
primarily with historical research, in precept
and in practice, :;ather than satisfy the in
dividual instructor's attempt to make up for
whatever deficiencies he thinks the History
program might have. The third change is the
elimination of the requirement of a minor.
These innovations are the result of action
taken by the History faculty on a report sub
mitted by an ad hoc committee of three His
tory students and three History professors.
According to Prof. Philip Dawson, who was
a member of this committee, the sequence
of events beginning about a year ago occurred
something like this:
For some time, it has been the general
feeling of the History Department that the
undergraduate program could stand improve
ment. It was felt that too many students were
plunging into a special area of study much too
early in their academic careers. A historian,
more than most professionals, needs a broad
base of knowledge. If he wants to be able to
relate many different trends and events and

put them in good perspective, he has to know
a little of everything—sociology, economics,
political science, anthropology, and so on.
The minors program was intended to provide
some of this diversification.
But the drawback of the minors program
was that, while it forced a student to take
courses he might easily otherwise pass by, it
still required no diversification within the His
tory Department itself. That is, if a student
wanted to specialize in, say, modern Europe,
a minors program meant that he would simply
take fewer courses related to modern Europe.
And so the faculty felt that something was
needed to give a student a wider background
in History itself. Let him specialize in graduate
school.
To correct this, it was proposed that under
graduates be given a comprehensive final
examination. It sounded like a fine idea, but
how should it be implemented?
This was just one of a number of related
problems discussed at length and sometimes
late into the night by the History faculty be

ginning last year. The discussions often turned
to fundamental questions of education, like
"just what are we trying to do here any
way?" Arguments were heated and progress
was very slow.
Then last November, Professor Otis Pease
was approached by ASSU President Sandy
MacKenzie and Vice President Clark Brown
with the idea of setting up a student-faculty
committee to consider how the undergraduate
History program could be bettered.
The department approved the idea and the
committee went to work at the end of last
January. At many a luncheon meeting, the
students and the teachers worked over every
idea that came into their heads. Some ideas
were quite radical, some not at all.
According to Professor Dawson, the meet
ings took on none of the aspects of a con
frontation or a test of strength by either
side, such as one might expect to find on
issues like draft deferment tests and coffee
houses. The talks never came down to three
students opposing three professors. The more

radical proposals were thought out to their
practical consequences, and most were dis
carded.
By the end of March, the committee had
come up with a report that was more a state
ment of principals than a detailed program,
although many specific suggestions were in
cluded. Also by this time, the rest of the His
tory faculty had become more dissatisfied with
the undergraduate program the more they
talked about it.
The report was given over to the faculty,
which received it with as much relief as en
thusiasm. The student-faculty committee had
done what the History faculty had not been
able to do because of its sheer size: come up
with a list of basic principles most of them
could agree on ,and a list of practical sug
gestions they could now set themselves to
sorting out.
Eventually, none of the committee's pro
posals were adopted intact. The principles were
there, however, and it was mostly a matter
of agreeing on details.

frontation or a test of strength by either
side, such as one might expect to find on
issues like draft deferment tests and coffee
houses. The talks never came down to three
students opposing three professors. The more

radical proposals were thought out to their
practical consequences, and most were dis
carded.
By the end of March, the committee had
come up with a report that was more a state
ment of principals than a detailed program,
although many specific suggestions were in
cluded. Also by this time, the rest of the His
tory faculty had become more dissatisfied with
the undergraduate program the more they
talked about it.
The report was given over to the faculty,
which received it with as much relief as en
thusiasm. The student-faculty committee had
done what the History faculty had not been
able to do because of its sheer size: come up
with a list of basic principles most of them
could agree on ,and a list of practical sug
gestions they could now set themselves to
sorting out.
Eventually, none of the committee's pro
posals were adopted intact. The principles were
there, however, and it was mostly a matter
of agreeing on details.
The History Department has extensively
revised the requirements for a history major
this fall. The revision, described by department
head David Potter as, "one of the most imag
inative changes the department has made in
a number of years," will affect all students
graduating later than winter quarter, 1968.
Students graduating before this time may
elect the new program if they desire, however.
Three major changes are involved: first, all
students will take a Comparative Reading
course which will be identical for all, regard
less of areas of individual interest. Each year
the department will draw up a list of books
dealing with some broad topic. From Jan
uary to June, for 10 units, the students will
be on their own—no papers, no classes. And
in June, everyone will take the same four
hour exam on what they have read.
The second major change involves the Basic
Seminar program. Beginning this year, His
tory majors will take the seminar in their
junior year. More important, the seminars

have been made more uniform and will deal
primarily with historical research, in precept
and in practice, :;ather than satisfy the in
dividual instructor's attempt to make up for
whatever deficiencies he thinks the History
program might have. The third change is the
elimination of the requirement of a minor.
These innovations are the result of action
taken by the History faculty on a report sub
mitted by an ad hoc committee of three His
tory students and three History professors.
According to Prof. Philip Dawson, who was
a member of this committee, the sequence
of events beginning about a year ago occurred
something like this:
For some time, it has been the general
feeling of the History Department that the
undergraduate program could stand improve
ment. It was felt that too many students were
plunging into a special area of study much too
early in their academic careers. A historian,
more than most professionals, needs a broad
base of knowledge. If he wants to be able to
relate many different trends and events and

put them in good perspective, he has to know
a little of everything—sociology, economics,
political science, anthropology, and so on.
The minors program was intended to provide
some of this diversification.
But the drawback of the minors program
was that, while it forced a student to take
courses he might easily otherwise pass by, it
still required no diversification within the His
tory Department itself. That is, if a student
wanted to specialize in, say, modern Europe,
a minors program meant that he would simply
take fewer courses related to modern Europe.
And so the faculty felt that something was
needed to give a student a wider background
in History itself. Let him specialize in graduate
school.
To correct this, it was proposed that under
graduates be given a comprehensive final
examination. It sounded like a fine idea, but
how should it be implemented?
This was just one of a number of related
problems discussed at length and sometimes
late into the night by the History faculty be

ginning last year. The discussions often turned
to fundamental questions of education, like
"just what are we trying to do here any
way?" Arguments were heated and progress
was very slow.
Then last November, Professor Otis Pease
was approached by ASSU President Sandy
MacKenzie and Vice President Clark Brown
with the idea of setting up a student-faculty
committee to consider how the undergraduate
History program could be bettered.
The department approved the idea and the
committee went to work at the end of last
January. At many a luncheon meeting, the
students and the teachers worked over every
idea that came into their heads. Some ideas
were quite radical, some not at all.

And so the faculty felt that something was
needed to give a student a wider background
in History itself. Let him specialize in graduate
school.
To correct this, it was proposed that under
graduates be given a comprehensive final
examination. It sounded like a fine idea, but
how should it be implemented?
This was just one of a number of related
problems discussed at length and sometimes
late into the night by the History faculty be

ginning last year. The discussions often turned
to fundamental questions of education, like
"just what are we trying to do here any
way?" Arguments were heated and progress
was very slow.
Then last November, Professor Otis Pease
was approached by ASSU President Sandy
MacKenzie and Vice President Clark Brown
with the idea of setting up a student-faculty
committee to consider how the undergraduate
History program could be bettered.
The department approved the idea and the
committee went to work at the end of last
January. At many a luncheon meeting, the
students and the teachers worked over every
idea that came into their heads. Some ideas
were quite radical, some not at all.
According to Professor Dawson, the meet
ings took on none of the aspects of a con
frontation or a test of strength by either
side, such as one might expect to find on
issues like draft deferment tests and coffee
houses. The talks never came down to three
students opposing three professors. The more

radical proposals were thought out to their
practical consequences, and most were dis
carded.
By the end of March, the committee had
come up with a report that was more a state
ment of principals than a detailed program,
although many specific suggestions were in
cluded. Also by this time, the rest of the His
tory faculty had become more dissatisfied with
the undergraduate program the more they
talked about it.
The report was given over to the faculty,
which received it with as much relief as en
thusiasm. The student-faculty committee had
done what the History faculty had not been
able to do because of its sheer size: come up
with a list of basic principles most of them
could agree on ,and a list of practical sug
gestions they could now set themselves to
sorting out.
Eventually, none of the committee's pro
posals were adopted intact. The principles were
there, however, and it was mostly a matter
of agreeing on details.
The History Department has extensively
revised the requirements for a history major
this fall. The revision, described by department
head David Potter as, "one of the most imag
inative changes the department has made in
a number of years," will affect all students
graduating later than winter quarter, 1968.
Students graduating before this time may
elect the new program if they desire, however.
Three major changes are involved: first, all
students will take a Comparative Reading
course which will be identical for all, regard
less of areas of individual interest. Each year
the department will draw up a list of books
dealing with some broad topic. From Jan
uary to June, for 10 units, the students will
be on their own—no papers, no classes. And
in June, everyone will take the same four
hour exam on what they have read.
The second major change involves the Basic
Seminar program. Beginning this year, His
tory majors will take the seminar in their
junior year. More important, the seminars

have been made more uniform and will deal
primarily with historical research, in precept
and in practice, :;ather than satisfy the in
dividual instructor's attempt to make up for
whatever deficiencies he thinks the History
program might have. The third change is the
elimination of the requirement of a minor.
These innovations are the result of action
taken by the History faculty on a report sub
mitted by an ad hoc committee of three His
tory students and three History professors.
According to Prof. Philip Dawson, who was
a member of this committee, the sequence
of events beginning about a year ago occurred
something like this:
For some time, it has been the general
feeling of the History Department that the
undergraduate program could stand improve
ment. It was felt that too many students were
plunging into a special area of study much too
early in their academic careers. A historian,
more than most professionals, needs a broad
base of knowledge. If he wants to be able to
relate many different trends and events and

put them in good perspective, he has to know
a little of everything—sociology, economics,
political science, anthropology, and so on.
The minors program was intended to provide
some of this diversification.
But the drawback of the minors program
was that, while it forced a student to take
courses he might easily otherwise pass by, it
still required no diversification within the His
tory Department itself. That is, if a student
wanted to specialize in, say, modern Europe,
a minors program meant that he would simply
take fewer courses related to modern Europe.
And so the faculty felt that something was
needed to give a student a wider background
in History itself. Let him specialize in graduate
school.
To correct this, it was proposed that under

examination. It sounded like a fine idea, but
