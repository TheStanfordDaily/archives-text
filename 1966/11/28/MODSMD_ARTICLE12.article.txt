# Half Of U.S. Colleges Now Prescribe 'Pill'
## 
### 
Dr. Ralph M. Buttermore of
the American College Health
Association announced that al
most half of the nation's college
health services will now pre
scribe contraceptive pills.
However, of the 315 member
institutions, only one in 25 will
do so to single women who have
no immediate plans of marriage.
The returns of the national sur
vey, compiled earlier this year,
are as follows:
• 174 do not prescribe con
traceptive pills
• 77 prescribe only to married
women students
• 23 prescribe only for medi
cal purposes
• 28 prescribe for single wom
en who display intent to marry
soon

• 13 prescribe for unmarried
women
The main reason given by
those institutions which do not
distribute the pill is that this
was out of the sphere of the col
lege health service. Use requires
the careful supervision of the
private physician.
"Others thought prescribing
the pill would express approval
for premarital relations, imply
ing that colleges accept a re
sponsibility that does not prop
erly belong to it and runs coun
ter to the great majority of par
ents," said Dr. Buttermore.
Those health services prescrib
ing contraceptives felt that the
pill should be treated as any
other drug.
Only 19 institutions had writ
ten policies concerning contra
ceptives.
