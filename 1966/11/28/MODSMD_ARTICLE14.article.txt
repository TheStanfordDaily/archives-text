## 'Films' Way Out Of Focus 
### Steve Lavine 
The best thing that one can
say about Michael F. Mayer's
book Foreign Films on Ameri
can Screens (Arco, 119 pages,
$2.00) is that it has several good
appendices. Mr. Mayer is the
director of the Independent Film
Importers and Distributors of
America. One would expect him
to know a great deal about
foreign films, and it is evident
from the text that he has seen
a great many films, but his inter
ests appear to be chiefly those
of a businessman. When he talks
about obscenity controls, cen
sorship, film raters, or theater
construction, he is in control of
his topic, but when he tries to
summarize the New Wave in
3 1/2 pages he fails miserably.
Part of the problem, of course,
is that Mr. Mayer is trying to
do too much. There is no way
that one can write an explication
of "foreign films" in 119 pages
. . . not even for the person who

wants only an "introduction."
One hundred and nineteen pages
is just about enough space to list
the important films and to give a
one line plot summary of each
(and there is pitifully little in
this world of less worth than a
one line plot summary). For
tunately, Mr. Mayer does not
sink this low. Rather, he leaves
out a great many films and
writes a paragraph or so about
each of the many films that he
does include.
Mr. Mayer, seems very reluc
tant to rely on his own critical
opinion. Again and again, he re
fers to New York Times, the
Saturday Review, or ,even worse,
Time when he requires a critical
appraisal. These are often "in
correct" and even when they
do touch upon something impor
tant, only rarely do they provide
a genuine insight. Mr. Mayer
tries very conscientiously to pro
vide both sides of the issue when
he deals with a controversial
film. The book would be much
more fun if it were a little more
one-sided.
As was mentioned earlier,
there are good appendices: lists
of 16mm and 35mm film distrib
utors, lists of film winners from
the big festivals (Cannes, Ven
ice, Mar Del Plata, Berlin, etc.),
and even a list of theaters in the
United States that regularly
show foreign films.
The book is abundantly illus
trated with stills from motion
pictures. Too many of the photo
graphs deal with sexual scenes.
While these shots may be of
independent interest, they often
fail to convey any feel for the
film as a whole.
W. C. Fields' fans should be
very happy this week. Wednes
day night at 12:30 on channel
five Million Dollar Legs is be
ing shown. The films was made

Charles Ruggles will be shown.
Bank Dick (1940) will be on

this world of less worth than a
one line plot summary). For
tunately, Mr. Mayer does not
sink this low. Rather, he leaves
out a great many films and
writes a paragraph or so about
each of the many films that he
does include.
Mr. Mayer, seems very reluc
tant to rely on his own critical
opinion. Again and again, he re
fers to New York Times, the
Saturday Review, or ,even worse,
Time when he requires a critical
appraisal. These are often "in
correct" and even when they
do touch upon something impor
tant, only rarely do they provide
a genuine insight. Mr. Mayer
tries very conscientiously to pro
vide both sides of the issue when
he deals with a controversial
film. The book would be much
more fun if it were a little more
one-sided.
As was mentioned earlier,
there are good appendices: lists
of 16mm and 35mm film distrib
utors, lists of film winners from
the big festivals (Cannes, Ven
ice, Mar Del Plata, Berlin, etc.),
and even a list of theaters in the
United States that regularly
show foreign films.
The book is abundantly illus
trated with stills from motion
pictures. Too many of the photo
graphs deal with sexual scenes.
While these shots may be of
independent interest, they often
fail to convey any feel for the
film as a whole.
W. C. Fields' fans should be
very happy this week. Wednes
day night at 12:30 on channel
five Million Dollar Legs is be
ing shown. The films was made
in 1932 and also features Jack
Oakie. Thursday night on chan
nel five at 12:50 Six of a Kind
(1934) starring Fields and
Charles Ruggles will be shown.
Bank Dick (1940) will be on
channel five at 2:55 Saturday
morning. Don't miss this one!
Also of interest this week is
Divorce Italian Style (1962) star
ring Marcello Mastroianni and

Friday at 11:30 p.m. on chan

The best thing that one can
say about Michael F. Mayer's
book Foreign Films on Ameri
can Screens (Arco, 119 pages,
$2.00) is that it has several good
appendices. Mr. Mayer is the
director of the Independent Film
Importers and Distributors of
America. One would expect him
to know a great deal about
foreign films, and it is evident
from the text that he has seen
a great many films, but his inter
ests appear to be chiefly those
of a businessman. When he talks
about obscenity controls, cen
sorship, film raters, or theater
construction, he is in control of
his topic, but when he tries to
summarize the New Wave in
3 1/2 pages he fails miserably.
Part of the problem, of course,
is that Mr. Mayer is trying to
do too much. There is no way
that one can write an explication
of "foreign films" in 119 pages
. . . not even for the person who

wants only an "introduction."
One hundred and nineteen pages
is just about enough space to list
the important films and to give a
one line plot summary of each
(and there is pitifully little in
this world of less worth than a
one line plot summary). For
tunately, Mr. Mayer does not
sink this low. Rather, he leaves
out a great many films and
