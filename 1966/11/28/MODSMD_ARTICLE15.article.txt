## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER Sports Editor 
The Stanford water polo team
took four straight to win the
NorCal Open Tournament last
week and wrap up its season
with a 15-5 record. The Indians
beat Foothill, 7-4; Cal, 7-3; SF
Olympic Club, 6-3; and San Jose
State, 3-1.
The Card poloists will be a
toss-up choice for second in the
country with USC. Undefeated
UCLA winds up on top for the
second year in a row. Stanford
and USC split overtime decisions
(11-10 and 6-7) this season, and
both lost two games to UCLA by
a total of 3 goals.
Sheerer Picked
The NorCal coaches unani
mously picked Gary Sheerer, Ail-
American Stanford junior, as the
Tournament's Outstanding Play
er. Sheerer, Stanford Athlete' of
the Month, scored 7 goals and
threw 6 assists in the four Tribe
victories.
Stanford got off to a cold
start against Foothill. The Tribe
beat the Owls easily twice ear
lier in the season. Scores by
Sheerer and John Parker left
the Indians behind, 3-2, after one
quarter. Bill Derrig tied the
score at halftime.
Mark Parmely fired in a back
hand in the fourth period, while
the Owls' George Watson scored

his third goal to force the game
into overtime. Finally awake, the
Stanford offense got into gear.
Parker scored and Sheerer
followed with two goals to put
the 7-4 game on ice.
Cards Beat Cal, 7-3
After the almost - too â€¢ rude
awakening against Foothill, the

Cards made no bones about
their intentions again Cal. Stan
ford had beaten Cal, 9-1, in a
Big Game butcher job four days
earlier.
Sheerer made two shots good
in the first period for a 2-1

Stanford lead. The Card offense
broke loose in the third period
while the defense held the Bears
down. Parker scored twice on
passes from Sheerer, and Sheer
er converted a Parker pass into
a tally.
Greg Buckingham lobbed in
Stanford's sixth goal in the
fourth period. Luis Nicolao
crunched a power sweep past
Cal's 6'9" shallow end goalie to
lace up the 7-3 decision.
Face Tough Olympic Club
Stanford's next game put the
Tribe against the San Francisco
Olympic Club and All - World
goalie Milan Muskatirovic. The
O' Club competed against Stan
ford without Stanford coach Jim
Gaughran.
The Olympic Club jumped
ahead early in the game, and
held a 3-2 lead at the half. John
Parker hit to tie the score, and
Pete Ready blasted in the go
ahead goal in the third period.
Parker scored his third in the
last quarter. Parmely, who
threw two assists in the game,

ended the scoring with a fierce
backhand that left even the best
goalie in the world helpless.
Parmely won every one of his
sprints through the Tournament.
San Jose In Finals
Stanford rode hard into San
Jose in the final game of the
tournament. Games with San
Jose always seem to have a
grudge character. San Jose beat
the Cards, 9-8, early in the sea
son right after Sheerer was laid
up with an ankle injury.
Stanford returned the compli
ment three weeks ago with a
9-6 torque job in the Spartans'
pool. The win cost the Cards one

cut eye, a few handfuls of fin
gernail scratches, and a few
bruised thighs.
Sparkling Defense
The San Jose game in the
tournament was a defensive
jewel. The Tribe kept the ball in
San Jose's half of the pool 70
per cent of the time with pin
point passing, alert and aggres
sive guarding, and consistent
thievery of the Spartans passes.
Mike Sorem made 7 saves in
front of the Indian goal cage.
Gary Sheerer scored one of
Stanford's three goals in the
game, and threw the cross-goal
passes that set up the other two.

Pete Ready converted Sheer
er's pass for the only goal of the
first half. Parker made it 2-0
in the third period. Sheerer took
a fast break into the goal for
a 3-0 lead. A cross goal spike by
San Jose's Jack Likens spoiled
the shut out.
Close, But No ...
Stanford's season was disap
pointing in several ways. The In
dians outscored their opponents
204-106 for the season, but lost
five games by a total of 6 goals.
The low point of the season
came early. Right after Sheerer
and Parker were injured in a car
accident, the Tribe dropped a 9-8

gfcme to San Jose and a 10-9
contest to Cal.
The Cards still had a chance to
take over the nation's first rank
ing when they travelled south to
Los Angeles. The Indians lost a
7-6 double overtime game to
USC. UCLA's Stan Cole scored
with two seconds left to beat
Stanford, 9-8, the following day.
Indians Rebound
While the national champion
ship hopes were out the window,
the Cards did not let down their
guard. They won their last 9
in a row, thoroughly drubbing
Cal, 9-1, for the highlight of the
year.
