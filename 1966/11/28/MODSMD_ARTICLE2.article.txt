# 'OFF' Leader Howell Cautiously Optimistic
## 
### CHRIS HARTE Associate Editor 
"OFF" leader Janet Howell yester
day expressed cautious optimism over
recent developments in the campaign
to allow women to live off campus.
Miss Howell's prime cause for
optimism was a discussion with Presi
dent Sterling last Tuesday, in which
she says"the lines of communication
were opened" for the first time.
"He said he would mention the issue
to the trustees for their own consid
eration, although it will not formally
be brought up at this time," she said.
Students' Responsibility
Miss Howell guarded her enthusi
asm, however, cautioning "the proof
of his concern for the students' posi
tion will be how much and what he
gets done in the near future. And if
nothing happens next quarter it will
be up to the students to keep pub
licizing the injustice of the present
situation and perhaps come up with
new tactics."
President Sterling said that there is
no official rationale for the present
rule requiring women to live on
campus and allowing men to live off,
according to Miss Howell.

"He said the rule is based on tradi
tion and history, and that changing
it would go against the grain of a lot
of people. He does realize, however,
that the students consider the policy
dated," she commented.
Referendum Not Influential
"He also said he found the student
opinion (as expressed in the recent
referendum in which students voted
for a policy to allow women to live
off campus by a ten-to-one margin)
very interesting, but that the final
decision would be influenced more by
financial considerations and consid
eration of what a change would do to
Stanford's image."
"President Sterling said he was glad
to see students concerned with and
trying to change the University, but
also said that student agitation was
not going to bring action," Miss
Howell continued.
Legislature referred the "OFF" pro
posal to the Committee of Fifteen
at its last meeting, and speaker Tom
Forstenzer said yesterday he would
make the formal referral early this
week. Forstenzer also expressed hope
the committee would take up the mat
ter soon, this quarter if possible.
