## Policy Shift Cracks Bonn Axis 
### Walter Lippmann 
A few days after Chancellor
Ludwig Erhard returned from
his visit to the President I hap
pened to find myself in Bonn.
The roof had fallen in.
Even then, in early October
and some weeks before the co
-1 alition cracked up, it was evident
that nothing would ever be the
r same again. The Federal Repub
* lie had come abruptly face to
• face with a radical change in
' German-American relations. The
Washington-Bonn axis, which
has been the mainspring of U.S.

policy in Europe, was broken.
The shock in Germany was all
the more severe because, ap
parently, nothing had been done
in Washington or in Bonn to
prepare the way for so radical a
change in U.S. policy. What Dr.
Erhard learned in Washington
was that the Federal Republic is
no longer our principal military
and political partner in Euro
pean affairs.
This amounted to saying that
the present level of NATO forces
was not vital to the peace of

Europe. He was told, too, that
the idea of nuclear sharing was
now subordinated to an effort to
induce the Soviet Union to play a
more active role in Asia.
These two American decisions
gutted the postwar idea that
West Germany is the principal
partner of the United States in
Europe.
In Bonn it was as if a glass
house had been struck by a big
hammer. Suddenly it was ob
vious that virtually nobody be
lieved in the postwar edifice of
ideas: that West Germany was
the bastion of the West against
the invading hordes of the East;
that West Germany was the
nucleus of industrial excellence
and military power around
which a new European great
state would be constructed; that
France, Britain and Italy would
follow the American-German
lead; that the overwhelming
riches and military power and
moral attractiveness of the
Washington-Bonn axis would
pull East Germany out of the
clutches of the Soviet Union and
would roll back the Red tide in
Eastern Europe.
Veils Of Illusion
The veils of illusion having
dropped, it was generall recog
nized that the reunification of
Germany and the restoration of
Germany to a place among the
powers could not be imposed by
Washington-Bonn, but could
come only as a result of a rec
onciliation with the East and a
thaw in the cold war.
What happened in Bonn really
originated in Washington. In the
President's exceptionally mature
speech of October 7 to the edi
torial writers we see the new
official point of view and the
first public statement of the new
policy. Better late than never.
Nevertheless, the damage done
by years of stubborn adherence
to decaying ideas is very great.
For the promotion of the
Washington-Bonn axis during
the postwar period has set back
badly Germany's reconciliation
with the European victors in
World War 11. It has poisoned
relations with France. It has
kept alive in Britain the war
time distrust and dislike of the
Germans.
Experience Of Reality
The damage inside Germany is
severe. For the Germans, hav
ing depended so long on Ameri
can corsets and American
crutches, have been denied the
experience of reality which is
essential to their independence.
Now that the postwar illusions
are swept away, the Germans
find themselves with very few
public men who are fitted for the
new times to come.
The former Nazis, even the
comparatively innocent ones, do
not find acceptance; with few
exceptions the anti-Nazis lack
experience in governing. The
German economy has recovered
from the war, but the German
body politic has not recovered
from Nazism, defeat and parti
tion.
We must, therefore, not be
surprised if it takes a long
time to work out of the German
political crisis. For it will take
time to resolve the internal con
flicts and issues which have
been masked or damped down
artificially during the postwar
period.

the more severe because, ap
parently, nothing had been done
in Washington or in Bonn to
prepare the way for so radical a
change in U.S. policy. What Dr.
Erhard learned in Washington
was that the Federal Republic is
no longer our principal military
and political partner in Euro
pean affairs.
This amounted to saying that
the present level of NATO forces
was not vital to the peace of

Europe. He was told, too, that
the idea of nuclear sharing was
now subordinated to an effort to
induce the Soviet Union to play a
more active role in Asia.
These two American decisions
gutted the postwar idea that
West Germany is the principal
partner of the United States in
Europe.
In Bonn it was as if a glass
house had been struck by a big
hammer. Suddenly it was ob
vious that virtually nobody be
lieved in the postwar edifice of
ideas: that West Germany was
the bastion of the West against
the invading hordes of the East;
that West Germany was the
nucleus of industrial excellence
and military power around
which a new European great
state would be constructed; that
France, Britain and Italy would
follow the American-German
lead; that the overwhelming
riches and military power and
moral attractiveness of the
Washington-Bonn axis would
pull East Germany out of the
clutches of the Soviet Union and
would roll back the Red tide in
Eastern Europe.
Veils Of Illusion
The veils of illusion having
dropped, it was generall recog
nized that the reunification of
Germany and the restoration of
Germany to a place among the
powers could not be imposed by
Washington-Bonn, but could
come only as a result of a rec
onciliation with the East and a
thaw in the cold war.
What happened in Bonn really
originated in Washington. In the
President's exceptionally mature
speech of October 7 to the edi
torial writers we see the new
official point of view and the
first public statement of the new
policy. Better late than never.
Nevertheless, the damage done
by years of stubborn adherence
to decaying ideas is very great.
For the promotion of the
Washington-Bonn axis during
the postwar period has set back
badly Germany's reconciliation
with the European victors in
World War 11. It has poisoned
relations with France. It has
kept alive in Britain the war
time distrust and dislike of the
Germans.
Experience Of Reality
The damage inside Germany is
severe. For the Germans, hav
ing depended so long on Ameri
can corsets and American
crutches, have been denied the
experience of reality which is
essential to their independence.
Now that the postwar illusions
are swept away, the Germans
find themselves with very few
public men who are fitted for the
new times to come.
The former Nazis, even the
comparatively innocent ones, do
not find acceptance; with few
exceptions the anti-Nazis lack
experience in governing. The
German economy has recovered
from the war, but the German
body politic has not recovered
from Nazism, defeat and parti
tion.
We must, therefore, not be
surprised if it takes a long
time to work out of the German
political crisis. For it will take
time to resolve the internal con
flicts and issues which have
been masked or damped down
artificially during the postwar
period.
