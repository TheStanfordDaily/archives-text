## Frosh Hit Wilbur Food: 'An Explanation, Please?' 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
As Freshmen living in Wilbur
Hall, we feel that an explanation
from the Administration is due
us. The University Food Service
which currently receives the
blame for the minute quantity
and even poorer quality of the
food served us, deserves absolu
tion from the accusations of
many Freshmen. But if the re
sponsibility for the quality of the
food does not lie with the food
service, where or to whom
should we look?
On the night of November 21
in the Wilbur Dining Halls, the
excuse given to eighty Fresh
men who sat for forty minutes
waiting to be served *was "some
one sliced the roast beef too
thick and there just isn't enough
to go around." To their chagrin,
they were treated after their
wait to mistreated morsels of
hamburger meat.
The explanation, please? $220
for sinewy hamburger meat
after a forty minute delay?
What happens to the exorbitant
board fee and why are we being
cheated by a university claimed
to be "sensitive" to student prob
lems and demands?

Editor, The Dally:
Thank you Dr. Spitz and Mark
Edwards for your letters on
Stanford - in - Austria. Hopefully
the discussion is now closed and
the work will begin. There is no
need for any more committee
type reviews under Dr. Walker.
The stage is now entirely his
and he must begin the task of
finding a new location for Stan
ford-in-Austria. The contract
with the Grandhotel Panhans
can be terminated by mutual
agreement at any time. Other
wise, I believe, it is open for re
newal in two years. Students
now know that if they are inter
ested in the Overseas Campus
Program they would do best not
to choose the one in Semmering.
Dr. Walker, the director of
the campus and all the officers

spent one afternoon in August
discussing the question of loca
tion. At that time we reached
an agreement that there were
problems due to the location.
But Dr. Walker said he wanted
to wait to see what Austria 111
had to say. The word is in. Now
Dr. Walker begin.

Editor, The Daily:
Congratulations Mr. Couzens!
Your clear and logical analysis
of the effects of intercollegiate
athletics at Stanford has cer
tainly insured a long life and
rosy future to the Athletic De
partment.
As a self-proclaimed scholar
surely you ought to have ap
proached the subject of competi
tive athletics in a scholarly man
ner. Yet your article in Friday's
Stanford Daily revealed a fright
ening lack of intellectual integ
rity. Why, Mr. Couzens?
Every scholar is entitled to
hypothesize. Thus, your attempt
to associate current intercolle
giate athletics with a) the out
rage over Dave Harris' hair b)
30 year old movies c) the panty
raids d) the culture of fraterni
ties (whatever that is) and e)
the war in Viet Nam, is your
privilege.
However, Mr. Couzens, hypo
thesis must be coupled with
documentation and logical
thought before it becomes valid.
Unfortunately for your attack
on athletics both of these factors
are totally lacking.
It is possible that competitive
athletics are detrimental to an
intellectual atmosphere, but not
for any of the reasons listed in
your article. I would suggest
that in the future you think
before you write. Perhaps then
a valid hypothesis which has
some basis in fact will result
from which an intelligent and
logical solution will arise.
Mere emotional iconoclasm
has no place in a society of
scholars. CARL MTJNDT
