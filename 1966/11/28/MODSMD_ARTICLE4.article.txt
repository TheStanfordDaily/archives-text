# Council Members Clash On Issue Of Judicial Publicity
## 
### GAIL ANDERSON (Fifth In a Series) 
"There is an irreconciliable conflict
in the Judicial Council between the
individual's right of confidence and
the University community's right to
know what the Council does," noted
Council member Joel Kugelmass.
This conflict is manifested in the
opposing attitudes of Council mem
bers concerning the proper role of
publicity in the judicial system. The
Council is split over where its pri
mary responsibility lies. Some mem
bers consider the Council an inde
pendent, secret body responsible only
lo the defendant and to itself. Others
conceive of a responsibility to the
community as a whole.
"Our concern is for the individual
as a person—not for 'removing threats
to the University community,'" con
tends Council chairman Mimi Sher
man.
Fundamental Standard
But Council member Fred Poor
baugh maintains, "Our responsibility
io the community is expressed in the
terms of the Fundamental Standard:
our function is only to protect the
interests of the community against
antisocial acts, to weed out antisocial
elements."
The dichotomy illustrated here leads
inevitably to opposing outlooks on
the role of publicity vis-a-vis the ju
dicial system.
With a few notable exceptions, such
as the Frank Morse case, facts about
Council proceedings and decisions are
generally not released to the public.
"People should know what's going
<m in Judicial Council," contends Miss
Sherman. "I see no reason for all this
secrecy. In the past, the problem has
been an inability to coordinate with
The Daily."
Poorbaugh takes a slightly different
point of view.
Simple Reporting
"Publicity is more detrimental than
worthwhile," he maintains. "News
paper reporting is rarely fair and
tends to oversimplify." What about a
release of facts by the Council itself?
"That would mislead people," he said,
but added, "If we get too specific,
everyone will know what's going on."
Poorbaugh expressed shock at dis
covering the following passage in the
ASSU Bylaws, Article 111, Section 4
(other council members were also
surprised that it existed):
"The Judicial Councils shall sub

mit to the Fundamental Standard and
Honor Code Commission detailed re
ports of cases heard by the Judicial
Councils. . . . These reports shall be
summarized by the Fundamental
Standard and Honor Code Commis
sion, to be submitted, after approval
by the Judicial Councils, to The
Stanford Daily for twice monthly pub
lication."
'A Bad Thing'
"That's a bad thing," commented
Poorbaugh.
The presence of this section in the
Bylaws indicates that at least in the
past someone felt the Judicial Coun
cil should be responsible to the Uni
versity community.
But there are two problems.
First, the provisions of the passage
were never followed.
Second, the Fundamental Standard
and Honor Code Commission was
abolished last year (although some
Council members were not aware of
this). So although the section, through
"an oversight" (in LASSU Speaker
Tom Forstenzer's words) has not been
revised, it is obsolete, and the Council
no longer has even a theoretical re
sponsibility to publicize its cases.
"Release of information about
cases," slates Poorbaugh, "would
amount to codification and subsequent

rigidity of the Fundamental Standard
in the public mind." He added that this
was the worst thing that could hap
pen to the judicial system.
Precedent Cases
Yet last year Council members and
LASSU representatives planned to
publish a book of what they con
sidered precedents. The project has
been abandoned—some Council mem
bers were unaware of its existence.
But ip the past, once more, someone
apparently thought it would be a good
idea for the University community to
know what its judicial structure was
doing.
This question of publicity leads to
the question of how much the Coun
cil is influenced by public opinion.
The Council has been heavily criti

cized on this point, but the criticism
has come from two opposite direc
tions.
On one hand is the criticism that
the Council, operating as it does under
the norms of two communities, must
feel the pressure of both administra
tive and student reaction, and adjust
its policies accordingly.
"The Council is too politically
minded," says ASSU Administrative
Assistant Tim Haight. "It must serve
two masters and consider the opinions
of each. And its area of authority is
vague enough to make every action a
political one. Test cases, for example,
are always political in nature. De
cisions in these cases are not interpre
tations—they are Declarations of In
dependence."

Dean Robert Hind agrees: "The
problem with the Judicial Council
is that it becomes a political-reforming
body rather than a judicial body."
But on the other hand, Tom For
stenzer states simply, "I don't agree.
I don't think they're sensitive to any
thing."
Perhaps this dichotomy is due to
the dissension within the Council con
cerning the extent of its independence
and responsibility.
The problem may be capsulized in
a statement by Miss Sherman in reply
to assusations of political-conscious
ness:
"That's not a valid criticism," she
said. "Why should we be influenced
by public opinion? None of what we
do gets outside the Council anyway."

conceive of a responsibility to the
community as a whole.
"Our concern is for the individual
as a person—not for 'removing threats
to the University community,'" con
tends Council chairman Mimi Sher
man.
Fundamental Standard
But Council member Fred Poor
baugh maintains, "Our responsibility
io the community is expressed in the
terms of the Fundamental Standard:
our function is only to protect the
interests of the community against
antisocial acts, to weed out antisocial
elements."
The dichotomy illustrated here leads
inevitably to opposing outlooks on
the role of publicity vis-a-vis the ju
dicial system.
With a few notable exceptions, such
as the Frank Morse case, facts about
Council proceedings and decisions are
generally not released to the public.
"People should know what's going
<m in Judicial Council," contends Miss
Sherman. "I see no reason for all this
secrecy. In the past, the problem has
been an inability to coordinate with
The Daily."
Poorbaugh takes a slightly different
point of view.
Simple Reporting
"Publicity is more detrimental than
worthwhile," he maintains. "News
paper reporting is rarely fair and
tends to oversimplify." What about a
release of facts by the Council itself?
"That would mislead people," he said,
but added, "If we get too specific,
everyone will know what's going on."
Poorbaugh expressed shock at dis
covering the following passage in the
ASSU Bylaws, Article 111, Section 4
(other council members were also
surprised that it existed):
"The Judicial Councils shall sub

mit to the Fundamental Standard and
Honor Code Commission detailed re
ports of cases heard by the Judicial
Councils. . . . These reports shall be
summarized by the Fundamental
Standard and Honor Code Commis
sion, to be submitted, after approval
by the Judicial Councils, to The
Stanford Daily for twice monthly pub
lication."
'A Bad Thing'
"That's a bad thing," commented
Poorbaugh.
The presence of this section in the
Bylaws indicates that at least in the
past someone felt the Judicial Coun
cil should be responsible to the Uni
versity community.
But there are two problems.
First, the provisions of the passage
were never followed.
Second, the Fundamental Standard
and Honor Code Commission was
abolished last year (although some
Council members were not aware of
this). So although the section, through
"an oversight" (in LASSU Speaker
Tom Forstenzer's words) has not been
revised, it is obsolete, and the Council
no longer has even a theoretical re
sponsibility to publicize its cases.
"Release of information about
cases," slates Poorbaugh, "would
amount to codification and subsequent

rigidity of the Fundamental Standard
in the public mind." He added that this
was the worst thing that could hap
pen to the judicial system.
Precedent Cases
Yet last year Council members and
LASSU representatives planned to
publish a book of what they con
sidered precedents. The project has
been abandoned—some Council mem
bers were unaware of its existence.
But ip the past, once more, someone
apparently thought it would be a good
idea for the University community to
know what its judicial structure was
doing.
This question of publicity leads to
the question of how much the Coun
cil is influenced by public opinion.
The Council has been heavily criti

cized on this point, but the criticism
has come from two opposite direc
tions.
On one hand is the criticism that
the Council, operating as it does under
the norms of two communities, must
feel the pressure of both administra
tive and student reaction, and adjust
its policies accordingly.
"The Council is too politically
minded," says ASSU Administrative
Assistant Tim Haight. "It must serve
two masters and consider the opinions
of each. And its area of authority is
vague enough to make every action a
political one. Test cases, for example,
are always political in nature. De
cisions in these cases are not interpre
tations—they are Declarations of In
dependence."

Dean Robert Hind agrees: "The
problem with the Judicial Council
is that it becomes a political-reforming
body rather than a judicial body."
But on the other hand, Tom For
stenzer states simply, "I don't agree.
I don't think they're sensitive to any
thing."
Perhaps this dichotomy is due to
the dissension within the Council con
cerning the extent of its independence
and responsibility.
The problem may be capsulized in
a statement by Miss Sherman in reply
to assusations of political-conscious
ness:
"That's not a valid criticism," she
said. "Why should we be influenced
by public opinion? None of what we
do gets outside the Council anyway."
"There is an irreconciliable conflict
in the Judicial Council between the
individual's right of confidence and
the University community's right to
know what the Council does," noted
Council member Joel Kugelmass.
This conflict is manifested in the
opposing attitudes of Council mem
bers concerning the proper role of
publicity in the judicial system. The
Council is split over where its pri
mary responsibility lies. Some mem
bers consider the Council an inde
pendent, secret body responsible only
lo the defendant and to itself. Others
conceive of a responsibility to the
community as a whole.

the role of publicity vis-a-vis the ju
dicial system.
With a few notable exceptions, such
as the Frank Morse case, facts about
Council proceedings and decisions are
generally not released to the public.
"People should know what's going
<m in Judicial Council," contends Miss
Sherman. "I see no reason for all this
secrecy. In the past, the problem has
been an inability to coordinate with
The Daily."
Poorbaugh takes a slightly different
point of view.
Simple Reporting
"Publicity is more detrimental than
worthwhile," he maintains. "News
paper reporting is rarely fair and
tends to oversimplify." What about a
release of facts by the Council itself?
"That would mislead people," he said,
but added, "If we get too specific,
everyone will know what's going on."
Poorbaugh expressed shock at dis
covering the following passage in the
ASSU Bylaws, Article 111, Section 4
(other council members were also
surprised that it existed):
"The Judicial Councils shall sub

mit to the Fundamental Standard and
Honor Code Commission detailed re
ports of cases heard by the Judicial
Councils. . . . These reports shall be
summarized by the Fundamental
Standard and Honor Code Commis
sion, to be submitted, after approval
by the Judicial Councils, to The
Stanford Daily for twice monthly pub
lication."
'A Bad Thing'
"That's a bad thing," commented
Poorbaugh.
The presence of this section in the
Bylaws indicates that at least in the
past someone felt the Judicial Coun
cil should be responsible to the Uni
versity community.
But there are two problems.
First, the provisions of the passage
were never followed.
Second, the Fundamental Standard
and Honor Code Commission was
abolished last year (although some
Council members were not aware of
this). So although the section, through
"an oversight" (in LASSU Speaker
Tom Forstenzer's words) has not been
revised, it is obsolete, and the Council
no longer has even a theoretical re
sponsibility to publicize its cases.
"Release of information about
cases," slates Poorbaugh, "would
amount to codification and subsequent

rigidity of the Fundamental Standard
in the public mind." He added that this
was the worst thing that could hap
pen to the judicial system.
Precedent Cases
Yet last year Council members and
LASSU representatives planned to
publish a book of what they con
sidered precedents. The project has
been abandoned—some Council mem
bers were unaware of its existence.
But ip the past, once more, someone
apparently thought it would be a good
idea for the University community to
know what its judicial structure was
doing.
This question of publicity leads to
the question of how much the Coun
cil is influenced by public opinion.
The Council has been heavily criti

cized on this point, but the criticism
has come from two opposite direc
tions.
On one hand is the criticism that
the Council, operating as it does under
the norms of two communities, must
feel the pressure of both administra
tive and student reaction, and adjust
its policies accordingly.
"The Council is too politically
minded," says ASSU Administrative
Assistant Tim Haight. "It must serve
two masters and consider the opinions
of each. And its area of authority is
vague enough to make every action a
political one. Test cases, for example,
are always political in nature. De
cisions in these cases are not interpre
tations—they are Declarations of In
dependence."

Dean Robert Hind agrees: "The
problem with the Judicial Council
is that it becomes a political-reforming
body rather than a judicial body."
But on the other hand, Tom For
stenzer states simply, "I don't agree.
I don't think they're sensitive to any
thing."
Perhaps this dichotomy is due to
the dissension within the Council con
cerning the extent of its independence
and responsibility.
The problem may be capsulized in
a statement by Miss Sherman in reply
to assusations of political-conscious
ness:
"That's not a valid criticism," she
said. "Why should we be influenced
by public opinion? None of what we
do gets outside the Council anyway."
"There is an irreconciliable conflict
in the Judicial Council between the
individual's right of confidence and
the University community's right to
know what the Council does," noted
Council member Joel Kugelmass.
This conflict is manifested in the
opposing attitudes of Council mem
bers concerning the proper role of
publicity in the judicial system. The
Council is split over where its pri
mary responsibility lies. Some mem
bers consider the Council an inde
pendent, secret body responsible only
lo the defendant and to itself. Others
conceive of a responsibility to the
community as a whole.
"Our concern is for the individual
as a person—not for 'removing threats
to the University community,'" con
tends Council chairman Mimi Sher
man.
Fundamental Standard
But Council member Fred Poor
baugh maintains, "Our responsibility
io the community is expressed in the
terms of the Fundamental Standard:
our function is only to protect the
interests of the community against
antisocial acts, to weed out antisocial
elements."
