# CUE Watches Pass-Fail
## 
### 
Stanford's official "experiment" in
pass-fail grading this fall seems to be
progressing satisfactorily with no
snags yet in sight.
This was the consensus of opinion
among students and faculty members
contacted by The Daily last week.
Meanwhile the more controversial
proposal to grade all freshman
courses on a pass-fail basis has been
passed to the Committee on Under
graduate Education (CUE) for further
consideration.
CUE okayed the limited pass-fail
system in effect this fall, as part of
a three-year experiment to encourage
students to take courses outside their
major fields.
In this it has been quite successful.
As Dan Hirchberg, a Junior in his
tory, notes, "I'm not in the mood to
shoot my CPA taking a course in art
when I can't draw, but if it's offered
pass-fail, sure I'll take it."

A question commonly raised con
cerns the amount of work done in a
pass-fail course. As one student re
marked, "do you realize how little
study you need to do for a pass-fail
final?"
However, faculty members hope in
tellectual motivation will replace sim
ple competition for grades.
Dr. Albert Guerard of the English
Department comments, "We'll prob
ably get somewhat less time from
students, but we will get devoted ef
fort."
Mike Couzens, a senior econ major,
concurs, "No I probably wouldn't
work as hard (in a pass-fail course),
but I'd learn more."
A pass-fail freshman year is being
urged to reduce grade pressures on
freshmen, and to "place the emphasis
on achievement in a subject rather
than simply doing what's necessary to
get a grade."

Guerard notes that a pass-fail fresh
man program is looked upon with
special favor in the English depart
ment. A recent study of the motivation
of Stanford freshmen showed that the
commonest aim in the sciences and in
foreign language courses was to mas
ter the subject matter, and in the
Freshman Seminars to explore issues,
whereas the commonest aim in West
ern Civilization and Freshman English
was to do whatever is necessary to
secure a good grade.
The English and History depart
ments currently have a program of
deferred grading in their freshman
courses where students receive no
grades until the end of the year.
An ungraded freshman year has al
ready been adopted by the California
Institute of Technology, and pre
liminary studies show it has been very
successful.

Institute of Technology, and pre
liminary studies show it has been very
successful.
Stanford's official "experiment" in
pass-fail grading this fall seems to be
progressing satisfactorily with no
snags yet in sight.
This was the consensus of opinion
among students and faculty members
contacted by The Daily last week.
Meanwhile the more controversial
proposal to grade all freshman
courses on a pass-fail basis has been
passed to the Committee on Under
graduate Education (CUE) for further
consideration.
CUE okayed the limited pass-fail
system in effect this fall, as part of
a three-year experiment to encourage
students to take courses outside their
major fields.
In this it has been quite successful.
As Dan Hirchberg, a Junior in his
tory, notes, "I'm not in the mood to
shoot my CPA taking a course in art
when I can't draw, but if it's offered
pass-fail, sure I'll take it."

A question commonly raised con
cerns the amount of work done in a
pass-fail course. As one student re
marked, "do you realize how little
study you need to do for a pass-fail
final?"
However, faculty members hope in
tellectual motivation will replace sim
ple competition for grades.
Dr. Albert Guerard of the English
Department comments, "We'll prob
ably get somewhat less time from
students, but we will get devoted ef
fort."
Mike Couzens, a senior econ major,
concurs, "No I probably wouldn't
work as hard (in a pass-fail course),
but I'd learn more."
A pass-fail freshman year is being
urged to reduce grade pressures on
freshmen, and to "place the emphasis
on achievement in a subject rather
than simply doing what's necessary to
get a grade."

Guerard notes that a pass-fail fresh
man program is looked upon with
special favor in the English depart
ment. A recent study of the motivation
of Stanford freshmen showed that the
commonest aim in the sciences and in
foreign language courses was to mas
ter the subject matter, and in the
Freshman Seminars to explore issues,
whereas the commonest aim in West
ern Civilization and Freshman English
was to do whatever is necessary to
secure a good grade.
The English and History depart
ments currently have a program of
deferred grading in their freshman
courses where students receive no
grades until the end of the year.
An ungraded freshman year has al
ready been adopted by the California
Institute of Technology, and pre
liminary studies show it has been very
successful.
