# Reply Offered To Council Minority In Shaving Case
## 
### HENRY MULLER News Editor 
Chairman of Judicial Council Mimi
Sherman has issued a rebuttal to the
three members who last week ex
pressed their dissent of the Council's
majority decision to place the Delt
head-shavers on probation.
Miss Sherman said she found three
basic contradictions in the arguments
presented to The Daily by Council
member and minority spokesman
Fred Poorbaugh.
—For one, she did not agree that
the attitudes of the individual of
fenders should determine the punish
ment. According to Miss Sherman,
the Council should first look at the
act itself and determine what sort of
punishment it merits.
She emphasized that this procedure
conformed with that used in courts
throughout the country.
Three Categories
Poorbaugh had suggested that the
head-shavers be divided into three
categories: those who felt their ac
tions were admissible and would com-

Mit the act again, those who con
sidered the head-shaving to be in the
form of a protest, and those who
were sincerely sorry for their actions.
He had also recommended that the
students in the first category not be
allowed to remain on campus.
"If they didn't want everyone sus
pended or placed on suspended sus
pension, then it shows they did not
feel the act itself merited suspension,"
argues Miss Sherman.
Individual Punishment
—Miss Sherman also did not feel it
was possible for individual punish
ment to be given out as long as
everyone had been tried together.
She said that the Council had de
cided to treat the defendants as in
dividuals rather than as members of
a house, but the question of trying
each of them separately never came
up.
Miss Sherman emphasized that the
dissenting members of the Council
never requested individual trials. She
also mentioned that the Council had
made it their policy not to try to find
out the specific roles played by par
ticular individuals in the head-shaving
incident.
"Faced with undifferentiated in
volvement, we could not in all con
science differentiate degrees of guilt,"
she added.
Inconsistent Dissent
—Miss Sherman pointed out that dis
senter Poorbaugh's statement in last
Tuesday's Daily was inconsistent with
what he had said in the "official" dis
senting opinion. In the latter, he ap
parently said that those students who
considered the head-shaving to be a
protest should have been suspended.
In the statement made to The Daily,
Poorbaugh said the students who did
it as a protest should only receive
"social and disciplinary action" be
cause "the second group is thinking at
least."
"My concern in offering a rebuttal
was both to clarify the majority's
position and to fulfill our responsi
bility to the community by explaining
the rationale behind our decision,"
Miss Sherman emphasized.

"Faced with undifferentiated in
volvement, we could not in all con
science differentiate degrees of guilt,"
she added.
Inconsistent Dissent
—Miss Sherman pointed out that dis
senter Poorbaugh's statement in last
Tuesday's Daily was inconsistent with
what he had said in the "official" dis
senting opinion. In the latter, he ap
parently said that those students who
considered the head-shaving to be a
protest should have been suspended.
In the statement made to The Daily,
Poorbaugh said the students who did
it as a protest should only receive
"social and disciplinary action" be
cause "the second group is thinking at
least."
"My concern in offering a rebuttal
was both to clarify the majority's
position and to fulfill our responsi
bility to the community by explaining
the rationale behind our decision,"
Miss Sherman emphasized.
Chairman of Judicial Council Mimi
Sherman has issued a rebuttal to the
three members who last week ex
pressed their dissent of the Council's
majority decision to place the Delt
head-shavers on probation.
Miss Sherman said she found three
basic contradictions in the arguments
presented to The Daily by Council
member and minority spokesman
Fred Poorbaugh.
—For one, she did not agree that
the attitudes of the individual of
fenders should determine the punish
ment. According to Miss Sherman,
the Council should first look at the
act itself and determine what sort of
punishment it merits.
She emphasized that this procedure
conformed with that used in courts
throughout the country.
Three Categories
Poorbaugh had suggested that the
head-shavers be divided into three
categories: those who felt their ac
tions were admissible and would com-

Mit the act again, those who con
sidered the head-shaving to be in the
form of a protest, and those who
were sincerely sorry for their actions.
He had also recommended that the
students in the first category not be
allowed to remain on campus.
"If they didn't want everyone sus
pended or placed on suspended sus
pension, then it shows they did not
feel the act itself merited suspension,"
argues Miss Sherman.
Individual Punishment
—Miss Sherman also did not feel it
was possible for individual punish
ment to be given out as long as
everyone had been tried together.
She said that the Council had de
cided to treat the defendants as in
dividuals rather than as members of
a house, but the question of trying
each of them separately never came
up.
Miss Sherman emphasized that the
dissenting members of the Council
never requested individual trials. She
also mentioned that the Council had
made it their policy not to try to find
out the specific roles played by par
ticular individuals in the head-shaving
incident.
"Faced with undifferentiated in
volvement, we could not in all con
science differentiate degrees of guilt,"
she added.
