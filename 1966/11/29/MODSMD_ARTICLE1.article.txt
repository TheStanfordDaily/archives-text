# Interim Judicial Board: Calm In Turmoil
## 
### GAIL ANDERSON (sixth in a series) 
Amid the confusion concerning the roles of
students and administration in the judicial
process, an institution adding an element of
stability is the Interim Judicial Board (IJB).
The Board consists of five faculty members:
Profs. Sneed (Law School), Zelditch (Sociol
ogy), Ryan (English), Rambo (Engineering)
and Horn (Political Science). It is constituted
as the basic appeals mechanism of the judicial
system.
The Board had its origins in the conflict
over appeals which broke out at the time of
the Frank Morse case. Judicial developments
led to the Crow-Halverson Report, which cast
doubts on the appropriateness of the ap
peals system through the Dean of Students.
Exclusive Jurisdiction
In response to this report, LASSU passed
a resolution calling for exclusive original
jurisdiction of ASSU over student affairs—a
demand which, according to Prof. McDonough
of the Law School, head of the judicial sub

committee of the Committee of Fifteen "went
somewhat further than some of the rest of
us throught it should."
In order to bring the two opposing sides
together, the Committee of Fifteen was set
up. Among its goals was to structure an ap
peals mechanism to replace the Dean of Stu
dents. Discussions as to the possibility of a
joint student-faculty appeals board went on
for a year without the Committee making
any conclusions.
When it became evident that the Commit
tee's deliberations were far from over, Presi
dent Sterling appointed the IJB to serve as
an appeals mechanism until such time as a
Clsrecommended board could be set up.
Three Types Of Cases
The IJB may take jurisdiction in three
types of cases: appeals from the Judicial
Council and in some cases from overseas
campus proceedings; cases of conflict be
tween University policy and ASSU policy: and
cases in which the student Judicial council
refuses to hear a case, or when no appropriate
council exists.

In review proceedings the IJB is empowered
to determine whether the procedural rights
of a party were violated, whether the Coun
cil's findings of fact were in error, whether
the Council did not consider all relevant fac
tors, whether the recommended penalty is in
appropriate, or whether the Council's pro
ceedings were inconsistent with applicable
policy or law.
A de novo hearing may be conducted if it is
determined that the Judicial Council acted
arbitrarily or irresponsibly.
Overseas Violation
If an overseas campus penalty extends be
yond the duration of the overseas session,
that part of the penalty may be appealed
upon return to the IJB.
The IJB is necessary, says Prof. Sneed,
chairman of the IJB, for two reasons: first,
the President needs the thought and study of
an independent body; and second, the Uni
versity faculty should play a role in policy
determination.
Other members of the Board added that it

prevents capricious administrative action, and
provides a more explicable and orderly pro
cedure than the system of appeal through the
Dean.
The IJB has heard only one case—an Honor
Code violation last year in which the Judicial
Council concluded after the appeal that they
had failed to take all evidence into considera
tion. The Board did not reverse the Council's
verdict.
Open House Issue
Presently the open house issue is pending
before the Board.
All members of the Board agreed that It
should be used as little as possible.
"We, and the administration, would prefer
to have all cases when possible tried by stu
dents," said Horn.
Zelditch added, "I would not like to see a
situation develop in which many cases were
appealed to the IJB. If this happens we are not
serving our proper function. There is no better
way to make a group such as the Judicial
Council irresponsible than to give it the op

portunity to pass Its responsibility to a higher
court."
And Prof. Sneed emphasized that "Every
member of the IJB hopes frevently that the
actions of the student Judicial Council will
reduce to the vanishing point the necessity
of our taking action."
He hopes that the IJB can strengthen the
Council by example, by advice, and by sug
gestions for procedural improvement.
Professor Zelditch commented that he was
"unhappy that no students are on the IJB."
He emphasized the necessity of having stu
dents in the appeals process.
Professor Horn agreed: "It is a matter of
great regret to me—and to the administration
—that a student-faculty review board has not
been set up."
The matter of such a board is presently still
in Committee of 15, and the probability of any
action in the near future is not good. But as
an interim structure the IJB is adding to an
otherwise confused situation the important
element of independence which makes for
stability.
