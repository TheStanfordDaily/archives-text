'TIS THE SEASON TO BE JOLLY
I know how busy you are-studying, going to class, help
ing old grads find their dentures after Homecoming—but,
hark, the Yuletide is almost upon us and it's time we
turned our thoughts to Christmas shopping.
We'll start with the hardest gift problem of all: what to
give the man who has everything. Well sir, here are some
things I'll bet he doesn't have: 1) A dentist s chair. 2) A
Mach number. 3) A street map of Perth, Australia. 4)
Fifty pounds of chicken fat. 5) A pack of Personna Super
Stainless Steel Blades.
"What?" you exclaim, your eyebrows leaping in wild
incredulity. "The man who has everything doesn't have
Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades? What arrant non
sense!" you scoff, making a coarse gesture.
But I insist. The man who has everything doesn't have
Personna because everyone in the dorm is always borrow
ing them. And small wonder! Wouldn't you be there with
an empty razor and a supplicating sidle if you heard some
body had super-blades that were super-sharp and super
durable; that scrape not, neither do they nick; that shave
you easily and breezily, quickly and slickly, scratchlessly
and matchlessly; that come both in Double-Edge style and
Injector style? Of course you would!
So here is our first gift suggestion. If you know a man
who shaves with Personna, give him a safe.
Next let us take up the thorny problem of buying gifts
when you have no money. Well sir, there are many won
derful gifts which cost hardly anything. A bottle of good
clear water, for example, is always welcome. A nice smooth
rock makes a charming paperweight. In fact, one Christ
mas back in my own college days, these are exactly the
gifts I gave a beauteous coed named Norma Glebe. I took
a rock, a bottle of water, a bit of ribbon, and attached a
card with this tender sentiment:
Here's some water
And here's a rock.
1 love you, daughter,
Around the clock.
Norma was so moved, she seized the rock, smashed the
bottle, and plunged the jagged edge into my sternum.

Here now is a lovely gift for an American History major
-a bronze statuette of Millard Fillmore with a clock in
the stomach. (Mr. Fillmore, incidentally, was the only
American president with a clock in his stomach. James K.
Polk had a stem-winder in his head and William Henry
Harrison chimed the quarter-hour, but only Mr. Fillmore
of all our chief executives had a clock in his stomach.
Franklin Pierce had a sweep second hand and Zachary
Taylor had 17 jewels and Martin Van Buren ticked but, I
repeat, Mr. Fillmore and Mr. Fillmore alone had a clock
in his stomach. Moreover, Mr. Fillmore was the first presi
dent with power steering. No wonder they called him
"Old Hickory!")
But I digress. Returning to Christmas gifts, here s one
that's sure to please—a gift certificate from the American
Society of Chiropractors. Accompanying each certificate
is this fetching little poem :
Merry Christ was, Happy Neiv Year,
Joyous sacro-iliac!
May your spine forever shine,
Blessings on your aching back!
May you r lum ha r ne'er grow number,
May your backbone ne'er dislodge,
May your caudal never dawdle,
Joyeux Noel! Heureux massage!

Injector, and from Personna's partner in sharing lux
ury, Burma-Shave, regular or menthol.

repeat, Mr. Fillmore and Mr. Fillmore alone had a clock
in his stomach. Moreover, Mr. Fillmore was the first presi

"Old Hickory!")
But I digress. Returning to Christmas gifts, here s one
that's sure to please—a gift certificate from the American
Society of Chiropractors. Accompanying each certificate
is this fetching little poem :
Merry Christ was, Happy Neiv Year,
Joyous sacro-iliac!
May your spine forever shine,
Blessings on your aching back!
May you r lum ha r ne'er grow number,
May your backbone ne'er dislodge,
May your caudal never dawdle,
Joyeux Noel! Heureux massage!

'TIS THE SEASON TO BE JOLLY
I know how busy you are-studying, going to class, help
ing old grads find their dentures after Homecoming—but,
hark, the Yuletide is almost upon us and it's time we
turned our thoughts to Christmas shopping.
We'll start with the hardest gift problem of all: what to
give the man who has everything. Well sir, here are some
things I'll bet he doesn't have: 1) A dentist s chair. 2) A
Mach number. 3) A street map of Perth, Australia. 4)
Fifty pounds of chicken fat. 5) A pack of Personna Super
Stainless Steel Blades.
"What?" you exclaim, your eyebrows leaping in wild
incredulity. "The man who has everything doesn't have
Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades? What arrant non
sense!" you scoff, making a coarse gesture.
But I insist. The man who has everything doesn't have
Personna because everyone in the dorm is always borrow
ing them. And small wonder! Wouldn't you be there with
an empty razor and a supplicating sidle if you heard some
body had super-blades that were super-sharp and super
durable; that scrape not, neither do they nick; that shave
you easily and breezily, quickly and slickly, scratchlessly
and matchlessly; that come both in Double-Edge style and
Injector style? Of course you would!
So here is our first gift suggestion. If you know a man
who shaves with Personna, give him a safe.
Next let us take up the thorny problem of buying gifts
when you have no money. Well sir, there are many won
derful gifts which cost hardly anything. A bottle of good
clear water, for example, is always welcome. A nice smooth
rock makes a charming paperweight. In fact, one Christ
mas back in my own college days, these are exactly the
gifts I gave a beauteous coed named Norma Glebe. I took
a rock, a bottle of water, a bit of ribbon, and attached a
card with this tender sentiment:
Here's some water
And here's a rock.
1 love you, daughter,
Around the clock.
Norma was so moved, she seized the rock, smashed the
bottle, and plunged the jagged edge into my sternum.

Here now is a lovely gift for an American History major
-a bronze statuette of Millard Fillmore with a clock in
the stomach. (Mr. Fillmore, incidentally, was the only
American president with a clock in his stomach. James K.
Polk had a stem-winder in his head and William Henry
Harrison chimed the quarter-hour, but only Mr. Fillmore
of all our chief executives had a clock in his stomach.
Franklin Pierce had a sweep second hand and Zachary
Taylor had 17 jewels and Martin Van Buren ticked but, I
repeat, Mr. Fillmore and Mr. Fillmore alone had a clock
in his stomach. Moreover, Mr. Fillmore was the first presi
dent with power steering. No wonder they called him
"Old Hickory!")
