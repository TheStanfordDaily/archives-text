# The 						Stanford Athlete—Paradox In An Intellectual Community
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER Sports Editor 
The college athlete is probably the
easiest and most often stereotyped
Individual in our society. A casual
glance beyond the stereotype, how
ever, yields a picture of a Stanford
athlete that hardly fits any framed
impression.
Stanford's 800 intercollegiate ath
letes find themselves in a peculiar
place—immersed in a community of
pressing intellectual demands and
simultaneously competing in an ath
letic environment where the stan
dards of excellence are no less rigor
ous.
Those who have not experienced
intercollegiate athletics proclaim
quite vocally that intercollegiate ath
letics must necessari'y interfere with
the true purpose <■ the university,
and should there & be withdrawn
from their positios >jf prominence on
campus.
Academics, Athh-tlcs Compatible
Stanford experience has consistent
ly proved, however, that achievement
on the field and excellence in the
classroom are not mutually exclusive
propositions. To the contrary, the two
often complement each other on cam
pus and continue to do so throughout
life.
A duality of pui jose does exist,
most definitely, and it is the Stan
ford athlete's reaction to this duality
that determines whether or not he
will be able to reconcile the two into
a complementing relationship. The
success of Stanford's intercollegiate
teams hinges correspondingly upon
the student-athlete's handling of this
duality.
The Stanford student-athlete faces
a number of hardships that his oppon
ents have not experienced. His aca
demic load is the same as any Stan
ford student 9, and that makes it con
siderably heavier than that of ath
letes from most other schools.
Values Questioned
The Stanford athlete encounters, on
occasion, righteous hostility from the
faculty. He also must answer to him
self a barrage of philosophical chal
lenges to justify his very existence.
His opponents, for the large part, are
spared this problem.
On the field such additional bur
dens do not bias the outcome of a
game. The Stanford athlete must
compete on a par with his opponents,
regardless of outside hardships, if he
hopes to succeed. And he succeeds—
not all the time, but often enough.
Freshman's Crucial Decision
More than 80 percent of Stanford's
freshman men entered the University
with a high school varsity letter. Very
early in his Stanford career, a fresh
man athlete must make a crucial
decision.
How much of my time, initiative,
and enthusiasm will I devote to ath
letics over the next four years? How
much can I afford? Three categories
of athletes emerge after this ques
tion is answered.
One man will put every faculty at
his hand toward achievement in ath
letics. Stanford sees few of these.

Such a man is usually striving for
acceptance into the ranks of the pro
fessional athlete. He produces or he
goes hungry.
Sacrifice Too Great?
A large number of freshman ath
letes judge the sacrifice of training
for intercollegiate athletics too great.
These men provide the bulk of Stan
ford intramural teams and spectator
sections.
The third category finds the student
who tries to do both the athletics and
the academics. His success will de
pend on his ability to budget his time,
study selectively, make the deter
mined play in the academic or ath
letic pinch, and make sacrifices when
called for. This man is the Stanford
Athlete.
The Stanford athlete is a versatile
and a flexible man. Swimming and
Water Polo coach Jim Gaughran, a
graduate of the Stanford Law School,
says, "My attitude toward the Stan
ford athlete is one of admiration and
awe. He does so many things, partici
pates in so many activities, studies
so hard, and still puts enough into
his sport to get something out of it."
No Breaks In Academics
The Stanford athlete gets no breaks
as far as his curriculum goes. The
athlete must take the same courses
and satisfy the same departmental
requirements as anyone else.
Ninety-four per ent of Stanford
varsity athletes graduate in four
years, compared with 84 percent for
the student body as a whole. One
cannot graduate from Stanford in
four years by sandbagging his
courses.
Stanford has no Physical Educa
tion major, the traditional standby
for the stereotype athlete.
Certainly, an athlete may take an
occasional mickey mouse course—the
Health series offers the greatest num
ber of micks—but he cannot graduate
by saturating his study list with
these. And he does graduate. The
Health series is by no means the only
mick on campus, and it is quite open
to anyone.
Can't Slack Off
Generally, the athlete will take a
lighter load during season than he
usually would, but he obviously
doesn't slack off for the whole year.
He can't at Stanford.
The Stanford athlete, then, has the
same academic program and oppor
tunity as anyone on campus. His obli
gation stiffens, however, as a result
of the time and the enery he spends
on athletics.
The student-athlete generally
spends more than 15 hours a week at
practice, games, and in the locker
room. When he comes home at night,
he's tired, and that can't increase
booking efficiency an awful lot. He
misses a lot of Friday classes because
of away games.
Regiment Study Tim©
To counteract the bind, Stanford
athletes must learn to regiment the
time they do have, and use it effici
ently
Some sort of sacrifice must be made
to survive in both the academic and

athletic realms simultaneously. This
sacrifice does not necessarily mean a
cut in GPA, although it ca.. without
much trouble. The successful Stan
ford athlete usually makes his sacri
fice in his social life.
The varsity athletes' GPA last year
was 2.57, compared with a 2.64 All
Men's figure.
The Stanford athlete must cope not
only with an academic burden in
creased by lack of time, but with

"If we bring those of sound body and sound mind to this great study and
this great practice, and so educate them, we shall save both city and con
stitutions." Pluto, Book VII

attacks launched from within the
Stanford community.
Hard Nosed Prof
Some professors make it unduly
hard to make up tests, laboratories,
and the like. The athlete, explaining
that he has a meet at 3:00 on Thurs
day, is often greeted by the cursory
"Well, what's more important? Ath
letics or academics?"
Both are important, and both can
be accommodated with leniency and
flexibility on the not-so-important de-

tails such as exactly what time one
makes up a test.
Stanford has, in many places, a
transient faculty. A professor has
been here two or three years, and
will move on after two or three more.
This professor may have experienced
a stifling predominance of athletics
over academics at another institution,
and assuming it to be the same here,
reacts obstinately to an athlete's
legitimate request.

Stanford faculty members who
have taken the time to get to know
the student athlete recognize that he
can be just as sensitive, intellectually
and emotionally, as any other Stan
ford student. These professors do
mu to break down the imaginary
walls between an athlete and an in
tellectual entity.
Student Attitudes Change
Student attitudes toward athletics
have changed, even in the last decade.
The rah-rah spirit, the huge rallies,

the blindly enthusiastic cheering sec
tion—all are disappearing. At Stan
ford, the value of continuing inter
collegiate football has been ques
tioned. (Imagine questioning the
value of football at Notre Dame or
Alabama. . . .)
Stanford fans are, in general, a
cynical lot. They, like all fans, like
success and deprecate defeat and ask
why things don't work.
Such value questioning can hurt or
help an athlete, depending upon his
strength as an individual. If he can
justify to himself his dual role, he
becomes more solid in that role—a
better athlete and a better student.
Of course, every individual does not
have such strength. For these, chal
lenging of his basis of existence can
cause both his academic and his ath
letic potency to quaver.
Why Go On?
The Stanford athlete has many
reasons for continuing in intercolleg
iate athletics, despite the particular
hardships that Stanford places upon
him.
Intercollegiate athletics provide the
opportunity for achievement that can
not be found in less highly toned
intramurals. An athlete can find his
limits as a person and as a competi
tor, testing himself against another
man.
Athletics can measure a man's

ability to handle the vicissitudes of
life. He learns what it is to lose some
thing that he put his biggest stakes
into. And he finds out whether he can
bounce back. He learns to accept de
feat graciously but not finalistically,
and return to win.
Can We Ever Win?
How, then, are Stanford athletics
as a whole affected by the Stanford
athletes' position? Stanford has gone
many years since its last NCAA
championship team, but overall, Its
teams have fared well against some
of the toughest competition in the
country.
An NCAA championship tepr must
function with 100 percent cov rr
tion through the entire seasor i
part of every member. At 5
every member of a team can -
to devote himself entirely to
all the time. Every team
can't be "up" for every gar
season.
While it is hard to come 1
a consistently winning team, 112
athletes can put together the
efforts on occasion to handle tb<
opponent.
A good Stanford athlete can pr,
out 100 percent while he is at j
tice, and handle his other resp< isi
bilities afterwards. A team of sur
ful Stanford athletes can be th< na
tion's tops.

of athletes emerge after this ques
tion is answered.
One man will put every faculty at
his hand toward achievement in ath
letics. Stanford sees few of these.

Such a man is usually striving for
acceptance into the ranks of the pro
fessional athlete. He produces or he
goes hungry.
Sacrifice Too Great?
A large number of freshman ath
letes judge the sacrifice of training
for intercollegiate athletics too great.
These men provide the bulk of Stan
ford intramural teams and spectator
sections.
The third category finds the student
who tries to do both the athletics and
the academics. His success will de
pend on his ability to budget his time,
study selectively, make the deter
mined play in the academic or ath
letic pinch, and make sacrifices when
called for. This man is the Stanford
Athlete.
The Stanford athlete is a versatile
and a flexible man. Swimming and
Water Polo coach Jim Gaughran, a
graduate of the Stanford Law School,
says, "My attitude toward the Stan
ford athlete is one of admiration and
awe. He does so many things, partici
pates in so many activities, studies
so hard, and still puts enough into
his sport to get something out of it."
No Breaks In Academics
The Stanford athlete gets no breaks
as far as his curriculum goes. The
athlete must take the same courses
and satisfy the same departmental
requirements as anyone else.
Ninety-four per ent of Stanford
varsity athletes graduate in four
years, compared with 84 percent for
the student body as a whole. One
cannot graduate from Stanford in
four years by sandbagging his
courses.
Stanford has no Physical Educa
tion major, the traditional standby
for the stereotype athlete.
Certainly, an athlete may take an
occasional mickey mouse course—the
Health series offers the greatest num
ber of micks—but he cannot graduate
by saturating his study list with
these. And he does graduate. The
Health series is by no means the only
mick on campus, and it is quite open
to anyone.
Can't Slack Off
Generally, the athlete will take a
lighter load during season than he
usually would, but he obviously
doesn't slack off for the whole year.
He can't at Stanford.
The Stanford athlete, then, has the
same academic program and oppor
tunity as anyone on campus. His obli
gation stiffens, however, as a result
of the time and the enery he spends
on athletics.
The student-athlete generally
spends more than 15 hours a week at
practice, games, and in the locker
room. When he comes home at night,
he's tired, and that can't increase
booking efficiency an awful lot. He
misses a lot of Friday classes because
of away games.
Regiment Study Tim©
To counteract the bind, Stanford
athletes must learn to regiment the
time they do have, and use it effici
ently
Some sort of sacrifice must be made
to survive in both the academic and

athletic realms simultaneously. This
sacrifice does not necessarily mean a
cut in GPA, although it ca.. without
much trouble. The successful Stan
ford athlete usually makes his sacri
fice in his social life.
The varsity athletes' GPA last year
was 2.57, compared with a 2.64 All
Men's figure.
The Stanford athlete must cope not
only with an academic burden in
creased by lack of time, but with

"If we bring those of sound body and sound mind to this great study and
this great practice, and so educate them, we shall save both city and con
stitutions." Pluto, Book VII

attacks launched from within the
Stanford community.
Hard Nosed Prof
Some professors make it unduly
hard to make up tests, laboratories,
and the like. The athlete, explaining
that he has a meet at 3:00 on Thurs
day, is often greeted by the cursory
"Well, what's more important? Ath
letics or academics?"
Both are important, and both can
be accommodated with leniency and
flexibility on the not-so-important de-

tails such as exactly what time one
makes up a test.
Stanford has, in many places, a
transient faculty. A professor has
been here two or three years, and
will move on after two or three more.
This professor may have experienced
a stifling predominance of athletics
over academics at another institution,
and assuming it to be the same here,
reacts obstinately to an athlete's
legitimate request.

Stanford faculty members who
have taken the time to get to know
the student athlete recognize that he
can be just as sensitive, intellectually
and emotionally, as any other Stan
ford student. These professors do
mu to break down the imaginary
walls between an athlete and an in
tellectual entity.
Student Attitudes Change
Student attitudes toward athletics
have changed, even in the last decade.
The rah-rah spirit, the huge rallies,

the blindly enthusiastic cheering sec
tion—all are disappearing. At Stan
ford, the value of continuing inter
collegiate football has been ques
tioned. (Imagine questioning the
value of football at Notre Dame or
Alabama. . . .)
Stanford fans are, in general, a
cynical lot. They, like all fans, like
success and deprecate defeat and ask
why things don't work.
Such value questioning can hurt or
help an athlete, depending upon his
strength as an individual. If he can
justify to himself his dual role, he
becomes more solid in that role—a
better athlete and a better student.
Of course, every individual does not
have such strength. For these, chal
lenging of his basis of existence can
cause both his academic and his ath
letic potency to quaver.
Why Go On?
The Stanford athlete has many
reasons for continuing in intercolleg
iate athletics, despite the particular
hardships that Stanford places upon
him.
Intercollegiate athletics provide the
opportunity for achievement that can
not be found in less highly toned
intramurals. An athlete can find his
limits as a person and as a competi
tor, testing himself against another
man.
Athletics can measure a man's

ability to handle the vicissitudes of
life. He learns what it is to lose some
thing that he put his biggest stakes
into. And he finds out whether he can
bounce back. He learns to accept de
feat graciously but not finalistically,
and return to win.
Can We Ever Win?
How, then, are Stanford athletics
as a whole affected by the Stanford
athletes' position? Stanford has gone
many years since its last NCAA
championship team, but overall, Its
teams have fared well against some
of the toughest competition in the
country.
An NCAA championship tepr must
function with 100 percent cov rr
tion through the entire seasor i
part of every member. At 5
every member of a team can -
to devote himself entirely to
all the time. Every team
can't be "up" for every gar
season.
While it is hard to come 1
a consistently winning team, 112
athletes can put together the
efforts on occasion to handle tb<
opponent.
A good Stanford athlete can pr,
out 100 percent while he is at j
tice, and handle his other resp< isi
bilities afterwards. A team of sur
ful Stanford athletes can be th< na
tion's tops.
The college athlete is probably the
easiest and most often stereotyped
Individual in our society. A casual
glance beyond the stereotype, how
ever, yields a picture of a Stanford
athlete that hardly fits any framed
impression.
Stanford's 800 intercollegiate ath
letes find themselves in a peculiar
place—immersed in a community of
pressing intellectual demands and
simultaneously competing in an ath
letic environment where the stan
dards of excellence are no less rigor
ous.
Those who have not experienced
intercollegiate athletics proclaim
quite vocally that intercollegiate ath
letics must necessari'y interfere with
the true purpose <■ the university,
and should there & be withdrawn
from their positios >jf prominence on
campus.
Academics, Athh-tlcs Compatible
Stanford experience has consistent
ly proved, however, that achievement
on the field and excellence in the
classroom are not mutually exclusive
propositions. To the contrary, the two
often complement each other on cam
pus and continue to do so throughout
life.
A duality of pui jose does exist,
most definitely, and it is the Stan
ford athlete's reaction to this duality
that determines whether or not he
will be able to reconcile the two into
a complementing relationship. The
success of Stanford's intercollegiate
teams hinges correspondingly upon
the student-athlete's handling of this
duality.
The Stanford student-athlete faces
a number of hardships that his oppon
ents have not experienced. His aca
demic load is the same as any Stan
ford student 9, and that makes it con
siderably heavier than that of ath
letes from most other schools.
Values Questioned
The Stanford athlete encounters, on
occasion, righteous hostility from the
faculty. He also must answer to him
self a barrage of philosophical chal
lenges to justify his very existence.
His opponents, for the large part, are
spared this problem.
On the field such additional bur
dens do not bias the outcome of a
game. The Stanford athlete must
compete on a par with his opponents,
regardless of outside hardships, if he
hopes to succeed. And he succeeds—
not all the time, but often enough.
Freshman's Crucial Decision
More than 80 percent of Stanford's
freshman men entered the University
with a high school varsity letter. Very
early in his Stanford career, a fresh
man athlete must make a crucial
decision.
How much of my time, initiative,
and enthusiasm will I devote to ath
letics over the next four years? How
much can I afford? Three categories
of athletes emerge after this ques
tion is answered.
One man will put every faculty at
his hand toward achievement in ath
letics. Stanford sees few of these.

acceptance into the ranks of the pro

practice, games, and in the locker
room. When he comes home at night,
he's tired, and that can't increase
booking efficiency an awful lot. He
misses a lot of Friday classes because
of away games.
Regiment Study Tim©
To counteract the bind, Stanford
athletes must learn to regiment the
time they do have, and use it effici
ently
Some sort of sacrifice must be made
to survive in both the academic and

athletic realms simultaneously. This
sacrifice does not necessarily mean a
cut in GPA, although it ca.. without
much trouble. The successful Stan
ford athlete usually makes his sacri
fice in his social life.
The varsity athletes' GPA last year
was 2.57, compared with a 2.64 All
Men's figure.
The Stanford athlete must cope not
only with an academic burden in
creased by lack of time, but with

"If we bring those of sound body and sound mind to this great study and
this great practice, and so educate them, we shall save both city and con
stitutions." Pluto, Book VII

attacks launched from within the
Stanford community.
Hard Nosed Prof
Some professors make it unduly
hard to make up tests, laboratories,
and the like. The athlete, explaining
that he has a meet at 3:00 on Thurs
day, is often greeted by the cursory
"Well, what's more important? Ath
letics or academics?"
Both are important, and both can
be accommodated with leniency and
flexibility on the not-so-important de-

tails such as exactly what time one
makes up a test.
Stanford has, in many places, a
transient faculty. A professor has
been here two or three years, and
will move on after two or three more.
This professor may have experienced
a stifling predominance of athletics
over academics at another institution,
and assuming it to be the same here,
reacts obstinately to an athlete's
legitimate request.

Stanford faculty members who
have taken the time to get to know
the student athlete recognize that he
can be just as sensitive, intellectually
and emotionally, as any other Stan
ford student. These professors do
mu to break down the imaginary
walls between an athlete and an in
tellectual entity.
Student Attitudes Change
Student attitudes toward athletics
have changed, even in the last decade.
The rah-rah spirit, the huge rallies,

the blindly enthusiastic cheering sec
tion—all are disappearing. At Stan
ford, the value of continuing inter
collegiate football has been ques
tioned. (Imagine questioning the
value of football at Notre Dame or
Alabama. . . .)
Stanford fans are, in general, a
cynical lot. They, like all fans, like
success and deprecate defeat and ask
why things don't work.
Such value questioning can hurt or
help an athlete, depending upon his
strength as an individual. If he can
justify to himself his dual role, he
becomes more solid in that role—a
better athlete and a better student.
Of course, every individual does not
have such strength. For these, chal
lenging of his basis of existence can
cause both his academic and his ath
letic potency to quaver.
Why Go On?
The Stanford athlete has many
reasons for continuing in intercolleg
iate athletics, despite the particular
hardships that Stanford places upon
him.
Intercollegiate athletics provide the
opportunity for achievement that can
not be found in less highly toned
intramurals. An athlete can find his
limits as a person and as a competi
tor, testing himself against another
man.
Athletics can measure a man's

ability to handle the vicissitudes of
life. He learns what it is to lose some
thing that he put his biggest stakes
into. And he finds out whether he can
bounce back. He learns to accept de
feat graciously but not finalistically,
and return to win.
Can We Ever Win?
How, then, are Stanford athletics
as a whole affected by the Stanford
athletes' position? Stanford has gone
many years since its last NCAA
championship team, but overall, Its
teams have fared well against some
of the toughest competition in the
country.
An NCAA championship tepr must
function with 100 percent cov rr
tion through the entire seasor i
part of every member. At 5
every member of a team can -
to devote himself entirely to
all the time. Every team
can't be "up" for every gar
season.
While it is hard to come 1
a consistently winning team, 112
athletes can put together the
efforts on occasion to handle tb<
opponent.
A good Stanford athlete can pr,
out 100 percent while he is at j
tice, and handle his other resp< isi
bilities afterwards. A team of sur
ful Stanford athletes can be th< na
tion's tops.
The college athlete is probably the
easiest and most often stereotyped
Individual in our society. A casual
glance beyond the stereotype, how
ever, yields a picture of a Stanford
athlete that hardly fits any framed
impression.
Stanford's 800 intercollegiate ath
letes find themselves in a peculiar
place—immersed in a community of
pressing intellectual demands and
simultaneously competing in an ath
letic environment where the stan
dards of excellence are no less rigor
ous.
Those who have not experienced
intercollegiate athletics proclaim
quite vocally that intercollegiate ath
letics must necessari'y interfere with
the true purpose <■ the university,
and should there & be withdrawn
from their positios >jf prominence on
campus.
Academics, Athh-tlcs Compatible
Stanford experience has consistent
ly proved, however, that achievement
on the field and excellence in the
classroom are not mutually exclusive
propositions. To the contrary, the two
often complement each other on cam
pus and continue to do so throughout
life.
A duality of pui jose does exist,
most definitely, and it is the Stan
ford athlete's reaction to this duality
that determines whether or not he
will be able to reconcile the two into
a complementing relationship. The
success of Stanford's intercollegiate
teams hinges correspondingly upon
the student-athlete's handling of this
duality.
The Stanford student-athlete faces
a number of hardships that his oppon
ents have not experienced. His aca
demic load is the same as any Stan
ford student 9, and that makes it con
siderably heavier than that of ath
letes from most other schools.
Values Questioned
The Stanford athlete encounters, on
occasion, righteous hostility from the
faculty. He also must answer to him
self a barrage of philosophical chal
lenges to justify his very existence.
His opponents, for the large part, are
spared this problem.
On the field such additional bur
dens do not bias the outcome of a
game. The Stanford athlete must
compete on a par with his opponents,
regardless of outside hardships, if he
hopes to succeed. And he succeeds—
not all the time, but often enough.
Freshman's Crucial Decision
More than 80 percent of Stanford's
freshman men entered the University
with a high school varsity letter. Very
early in his Stanford career, a fresh
man athlete must make a crucial
decision.
How much of my time, initiative,
and enthusiasm will I devote to ath
letics over the next four years? How
much can I afford? Three categories
of athletes emerge after this ques
tion is answered.
One man will put every faculty at
his hand toward achievement in ath
letics. Stanford sees few of these.

Such a man is usually striving for
acceptance into the ranks of the pro
fessional athlete. He produces or he
goes hungry.
Sacrifice Too Great?
A large number of freshman ath
letes judge the sacrifice of training
for intercollegiate athletics too great.
These men provide the bulk of Stan
ford intramural teams and spectator
sections.
The third category finds the student
who tries to do both the athletics and
the academics. His success will de
pend on his ability to budget his time,
study selectively, make the deter
mined play in the academic or ath
letic pinch, and make sacrifices when
called for. This man is the Stanford
Athlete.
The Stanford athlete is a versatile
and a flexible man. Swimming and
Water Polo coach Jim Gaughran, a
graduate of the Stanford Law School,
says, "My attitude toward the Stan
ford athlete is one of admiration and
awe. He does so many things, partici
pates in so many activities, studies
so hard, and still puts enough into
his sport to get something out of it."
No Breaks In Academics
The Stanford athlete gets no breaks
as far as his curriculum goes. The
athlete must take the same courses
and satisfy the same departmental
requirements as anyone else.
Ninety-four per ent of Stanford
varsity athletes graduate in four
years, compared with 84 percent for
the student body as a whole. One
cannot graduate from Stanford in
four years by sandbagging his
courses.
Stanford has no Physical Educa
tion major, the traditional standby
for the stereotype athlete.
Certainly, an athlete may take an
occasional mickey mouse course—the
Health series offers the greatest num
ber of micks—but he cannot graduate
by saturating his study list with
these. And he does graduate. The
Health series is by no means the only
mick on campus, and it is quite open
to anyone.
Can't Slack Off
Generally, the athlete will take a
lighter load during season than he
usually would, but he obviously
doesn't slack off for the whole year.
He can't at Stanford.
The Stanford athlete, then, has the
same academic program and oppor
tunity as anyone on campus. His obli
gation stiffens, however, as a result
of the time and the enery he spends
on athletics.
The student-athlete generally
spends more than 15 hours a week at
practice, games, and in the locker
room. When he comes home at night,
he's tired, and that can't increase
booking efficiency an awful lot. He

value of football at Notre Dame or
Alabama. . . .)
Stanford fans are, in general, a
cynical lot. They, like all fans, like
success and deprecate defeat and ask
why things don't work.
Such value questioning can hurt or
help an athlete, depending upon his
strength as an individual. If he can
justify to himself his dual role, he
becomes more solid in that role—a
better athlete and a better student.
Of course, every individual does not
have such strength. For these, chal
lenging of his basis of existence can
cause both his academic and his ath
letic potency to quaver.
Why Go On?
The Stanford athlete has many
reasons for continuing in intercolleg
iate athletics, despite the particular
hardships that Stanford places upon
him.
Intercollegiate athletics provide the
opportunity for achievement that can
not be found in less highly toned
intramurals. An athlete can find his
limits as a person and as a competi
tor, testing himself against another
man.
Athletics can measure a man's

ability to handle the vicissitudes of
life. He learns what it is to lose some
thing that he put his biggest stakes
into. And he finds out whether he can
bounce back. He learns to accept de
feat graciously but not finalistically,
and return to win.
Can We Ever Win?
How, then, are Stanford athletics
as a whole affected by the Stanford
athletes' position? Stanford has gone
many years since its last NCAA
championship team, but overall, Its
teams have fared well against some
of the toughest competition in the
country.
An NCAA championship tepr must
function with 100 percent cov rr
tion through the entire seasor i
part of every member. At 5
every member of a team can -
to devote himself entirely to
all the time. Every team
can't be "up" for every gar
season.
While it is hard to come 1
a consistently winning team, 112
athletes can put together the
efforts on occasion to handle tb<
opponent.
A good Stanford athlete can pr,
out 100 percent while he is at j
tice, and handle his other resp< isi
bilities afterwards. A team of sur
ful Stanford athletes can be th< na
tion's tops.
The college athlete is probably the
easiest and most often stereotyped
Individual in our society. A casual
glance beyond the stereotype, how
ever, yields a picture of a Stanford
athlete that hardly fits any framed
impression.
Stanford's 800 intercollegiate ath
letes find themselves in a peculiar
place—immersed in a community of
pressing intellectual demands and
simultaneously competing in an ath
letic environment where the stan
dards of excellence are no less rigor
ous.
Those who have not experienced
intercollegiate athletics proclaim
quite vocally that intercollegiate ath
letics must necessari'y interfere with
the true purpose <■ the university,
and should there & be withdrawn
from their positios >jf prominence on
campus.
Academics, Athh-tlcs Compatible
Stanford experience has consistent
ly proved, however, that achievement
on the field and excellence in the
classroom are not mutually exclusive
propositions. To the contrary, the two
often complement each other on cam
pus and continue to do so throughout
life.
A duality of pui jose does exist,
most definitely, and it is the Stan
ford athlete's reaction to this duality
that determines whether or not he
will be able to reconcile the two into
a complementing relationship. The
success of Stanford's intercollegiate
teams hinges correspondingly upon
the student-athlete's handling of this
duality.
The Stanford student-athlete faces
a number of hardships that his oppon
ents have not experienced. His aca
demic load is the same as any Stan
ford student 9, and that makes it con
siderably heavier than that of ath
letes from most other schools.
Values Questioned
The Stanford athlete encounters, on
occasion, righteous hostility from the
faculty. He also must answer to him
self a barrage of philosophical chal
lenges to justify his very existence.
His opponents, for the large part, are
spared this problem.
On the field such additional bur
dens do not bias the outcome of a
game. The Stanford athlete must
compete on a par with his opponents,
regardless of outside hardships, if he
hopes to succeed. And he succeeds—
not all the time, but often enough.
Freshman's Crucial Decision
More than 80 percent of Stanford's
freshman men entered the University
with a high school varsity letter. Very
early in his Stanford career, a fresh
man athlete must make a crucial
decision.
How much of my time, initiative,
and enthusiasm will I devote to ath
letics over the next four years? How
much can I afford? Three categories
of athletes emerge after this ques
tion is answered.
One man will put every faculty at
his hand toward achievement in ath
letics. Stanford sees few of these.

Such a man is usually striving for
acceptance into the ranks of the pro
fessional athlete. He produces or he
goes hungry.
Sacrifice Too Great?
A large number of freshman ath
letes judge the sacrifice of training
for intercollegiate athletics too great.
These men provide the bulk of Stan
ford intramural teams and spectator
sections.
The third category finds the student
who tries to do both the athletics and
the academics. His success will de
pend on his ability to budget his time,
study selectively, make the deter
mined play in the academic or ath
letic pinch, and make sacrifices when
called for. This man is the Stanford
Athlete.
The Stanford athlete is a versatile
and a flexible man. Swimming and
Water Polo coach Jim Gaughran, a
graduate of the Stanford Law School,
says, "My attitude toward the Stan
ford athlete is one of admiration and
awe. He does so many things, partici
pates in so many activities, studies
so hard, and still puts enough into
his sport to get something out of it."
No Breaks In Academics
The Stanford athlete gets no breaks
as far as his curriculum goes. The
athlete must take the same courses
and satisfy the same departmental
requirements as anyone else.
Ninety-four per ent of Stanford
varsity athletes graduate in four
years, compared with 84 percent for
the student body as a whole. One
cannot graduate from Stanford in
four years by sandbagging his
courses.
Stanford has no Physical Educa
tion major, the traditional standby
for the stereotype athlete.
Certainly, an athlete may take an
occasional mickey mouse course—the
Health series offers the greatest num
ber of micks—but he cannot graduate
by saturating his study list with
these. And he does graduate. The
Health series is by no means the only
mick on campus, and it is quite open
to anyone.
Can't Slack Off
Generally, the athlete will take a
lighter load during season than he
usually would, but he obviously
doesn't slack off for the whole year.
He can't at Stanford.
The Stanford athlete, then, has the
same academic program and oppor
tunity as anyone on campus. His obli
gation stiffens, however, as a result
of the time and the enery he spends
on athletics.
The student-athlete generally
spends more than 15 hours a week at
practice, games, and in the locker
room. When he comes home at night,
he's tired, and that can't increase
booking efficiency an awful lot. He
misses a lot of Friday classes because
of away games.
Regiment Study Tim©
To counteract the bind, Stanford
athletes must learn to regiment the
time they do have, and use it effici
ently
Some sort of sacrifice must be made
to survive in both the academic and

athletic realms simultaneously. This
sacrifice does not necessarily mean a
cut in GPA, although it ca.. without
much trouble. The successful Stan
ford athlete usually makes his sacri
fice in his social life.
The varsity athletes' GPA last year
was 2.57, compared with a 2.64 All
Men's figure.
The Stanford athlete must cope not
only with an academic burden in
creased by lack of time, but with

"If we bring those of sound body and sound mind to this great study and
this great practice, and so educate them, we shall save both city and con
stitutions." Pluto, Book VII

attacks launched from within the
Stanford community.
Hard Nosed Prof
Some professors make it unduly
hard to make up tests, laboratories,
and the like. The athlete, explaining
that he has a meet at 3:00 on Thurs
day, is often greeted by the cursory
"Well, what's more important? Ath
letics or academics?"
Both are important, and both can
be accommodated with leniency and
flexibility on the not-so-important de-

tails such as exactly what time one
makes up a test.
Stanford has, in many places, a
transient faculty. A professor has
been here two or three years, and
will move on after two or three more.
This professor may have experienced
a stifling predominance of athletics
over academics at another institution,
and assuming it to be the same here,
reacts obstinately to an athlete's
legitimate request.

Stanford faculty members who
have taken the time to get to know
the student athlete recognize that he
can be just as sensitive, intellectually
and emotionally, as any other Stan
ford student. These professors do
mu to break down the imaginary
walls between an athlete and an in
tellectual entity.
Student Attitudes Change
Student attitudes toward athletics
have changed, even in the last decade.
The rah-rah spirit, the huge rallies,

the blindly enthusiastic cheering sec
tion—all are disappearing. At Stan
ford, the value of continuing inter
collegiate football has been ques
tioned. (Imagine questioning the
value of football at Notre Dame or
Alabama. . . .)
Stanford fans are, in general, a
cynical lot. They, like all fans, like
success and deprecate defeat and ask
why things don't work.

letes find themselves in a peculiar
place—immersed in a community of
pressing intellectual demands and
simultaneously competing in an ath
letic environment where the stan
dards of excellence are no less rigor
ous.
Those who have not experienced
intercollegiate athletics proclaim
quite vocally that intercollegiate ath
letics must necessari'y interfere with
the true purpose <■ the university,
and should there & be withdrawn
from their positios >jf prominence on
campus.
Academics, Athh-tlcs Compatible
Stanford experience has consistent
ly proved, however, that achievement
on the field and excellence in the
classroom are not mutually exclusive
propositions. To the contrary, the two
often complement each other on cam
pus and continue to do so throughout
life.
A duality of pui jose does exist,
most definitely, and it is the Stan
ford athlete's reaction to this duality
that determines whether or not he
will be able to reconcile the two into
a complementing relationship. The
success of Stanford's intercollegiate
teams hinges correspondingly upon
the student-athlete's handling of this
duality.
The Stanford student-athlete faces
a number of hardships that his oppon
ents have not experienced. His aca
demic load is the same as any Stan
ford student 9, and that makes it con
siderably heavier than that of ath
letes from most other schools.
Values Questioned
The Stanford athlete encounters, on
occasion, righteous hostility from the
faculty. He also must answer to him
self a barrage of philosophical chal
lenges to justify his very existence.
His opponents, for the large part, are
spared this problem.
On the field such additional bur
dens do not bias the outcome of a
game. The Stanford athlete must
compete on a par with his opponents,
regardless of outside hardships, if he
hopes to succeed. And he succeeds—
not all the time, but often enough.
Freshman's Crucial Decision
More than 80 percent of Stanford's
freshman men entered the University
with a high school varsity letter. Very
early in his Stanford career, a fresh
man athlete must make a crucial
decision.
How much of my time, initiative,
and enthusiasm will I devote to ath
letics over the next four years? How
much can I afford? Three categories
of athletes emerge after this ques
tion is answered.
One man will put every faculty at
his hand toward achievement in ath
letics. Stanford sees few of these.

Such a man is usually striving for
acceptance into the ranks of the pro
fessional athlete. He produces or he
goes hungry.
Sacrifice Too Great?
A large number of freshman ath
letes judge the sacrifice of training
for intercollegiate athletics too great.
These men provide the bulk of Stan
ford intramural teams and spectator
sections.
The third category finds the student
who tries to do both the athletics and
the academics. His success will de
pend on his ability to budget his time,
study selectively, make the deter
mined play in the academic or ath
letic pinch, and make sacrifices when
called for. This man is the Stanford
Athlete.
The Stanford athlete is a versatile
and a flexible man. Swimming and
Water Polo coach Jim Gaughran, a
graduate of the Stanford Law School,
says, "My attitude toward the Stan
ford athlete is one of admiration and
awe. He does so many things, partici
pates in so many activities, studies
so hard, and still puts enough into
his sport to get something out of it."
No Breaks In Academics
The Stanford athlete gets no breaks
as far as his curriculum goes. The
athlete must take the same courses
and satisfy the same departmental
requirements as anyone else.
Ninety-four per ent of Stanford
varsity athletes graduate in four
years, compared with 84 percent for
the student body as a whole. One
cannot graduate from Stanford in
four years by sandbagging his
courses.
Stanford has no Physical Educa
tion major, the traditional standby
for the stereotype athlete.
Certainly, an athlete may take an
occasional mickey mouse course—the
Health series offers the greatest num
ber of micks—but he cannot graduate
by saturating his study list with
these. And he does graduate. The
Health series is by no means the only
mick on campus, and it is quite open
to anyone.
Can't Slack Off
Generally, the athlete will take a
lighter load during season than he
usually would, but he obviously
doesn't slack off for the whole year.
He can't at Stanford.
The Stanford athlete, then, has the
same academic program and oppor
tunity as anyone on campus. His obli
gation stiffens, however, as a result
of the time and the enery he spends
on athletics.
The student-athlete generally
spends more than 15 hours a week at
practice, games, and in the locker
room. When he comes home at night,
he's tired, and that can't increase
booking efficiency an awful lot. He
misses a lot of Friday classes because
of away games.
Regiment Study Tim©
To counteract the bind, Stanford
athletes must learn to regiment the
time they do have, and use it effici
ently
Some sort of sacrifice must be made
to survive in both the academic and

athletic realms simultaneously. This
sacrifice does not necessarily mean a
cut in GPA, although it ca.. without
much trouble. The successful Stan
ford athlete usually makes his sacri
fice in his social life.
The varsity athletes' GPA last year
was 2.57, compared with a 2.64 All
Men's figure.
The Stanford athlete must cope not
only with an academic burden in
creased by lack of time, but with

"If we bring those of sound body and sound mind to this great study and
this great practice, and so educate them, we shall save both city and con
stitutions." Pluto, Book VII

attacks launched from within the
Stanford community.
Hard Nosed Prof
Some professors make it unduly
hard to make up tests, laboratories,
and the like. The athlete, explaining
that he has a meet at 3:00 on Thurs
day, is often greeted by the cursory
"Well, what's more important? Ath
letics or academics?"
Both are important, and both can
be accommodated with leniency and
flexibility on the not-so-important de-

tails such as exactly what time one
makes up a test.
Stanford has, in many places, a
transient faculty. A professor has
been here two or three years, and
will move on after two or three more.
This professor may have experienced
a stifling predominance of athletics
over academics at another institution,
and assuming it to be the same here,
reacts obstinately to an athlete's
legitimate request.

Stanford faculty members who
have taken the time to get to know
the student athlete recognize that he
can be just as sensitive, intellectually
and emotionally, as any other Stan
ford student. These professors do
mu to break down the imaginary
walls between an athlete and an in
tellectual entity.
Student Attitudes Change
Student attitudes toward athletics
have changed, even in the last decade.
The rah-rah spirit, the huge rallies,

the blindly enthusiastic cheering sec
tion—all are disappearing. At Stan
ford, the value of continuing inter
collegiate football has been ques
tioned. (Imagine questioning the
value of football at Notre Dame or
Alabama. . . .)
Stanford fans are, in general, a
cynical lot. They, like all fans, like
success and deprecate defeat and ask
why things don't work.
Such value questioning can hurt or
help an athlete, depending upon his
strength as an individual. If he can
justify to himself his dual role, he
becomes more solid in that role—a
better athlete and a better student.
Of course, every individual does not
have such strength. For these, chal
lenging of his basis of existence can
cause both his academic and his ath
letic potency to quaver.
Why Go On?
The Stanford athlete has many
reasons for continuing in intercolleg
iate athletics, despite the particular
hardships that Stanford places upon
him.
Intercollegiate athletics provide the
opportunity for achievement that can
not be found in less highly toned
intramurals. An athlete can find his
limits as a person and as a competi
tor, testing himself against another
man.
Athletics can measure a man's

ability to handle the vicissitudes of
life. He learns what it is to lose some
thing that he put his biggest stakes
into. And he finds out whether he can
bounce back. He learns to accept de
feat graciously but not finalistically,
and return to win.
Can We Ever Win?
How, then, are Stanford athletics
as a whole affected by the Stanford
athletes' position? Stanford has gone
many years since its last NCAA
championship team, but overall, Its
teams have fared well against some
of the toughest competition in the
country.
An NCAA championship tepr must
function with 100 percent cov rr
tion through the entire seasor i
part of every member. At 5
every member of a team can -
to devote himself entirely to
all the time. Every team
can't be "up" for every gar
season.
While it is hard to come 1
a consistently winning team, 112
athletes can put together the
efforts on occasion to handle tb<
opponent.
A good Stanford athlete can pr,
out 100 percent while he is at j
tice, and handle his other resp< isi
bilities afterwards. A team of sur
ful Stanford athletes can be th< na
tion's tops.
The college athlete is probably the
easiest and most often stereotyped
Individual in our society. A casual
glance beyond the stereotype, how
ever, yields a picture of a Stanford
athlete that hardly fits any framed
impression.
