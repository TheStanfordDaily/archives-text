# DESPITE DEFECTS
## Mural Sports Flourish 
### BOB EGELKO 
If there is a point to the Stanford
intramural program, it begins to get
a little obscure around the end of
football season. Protestations of bat
tles won on the playing fields of Eton,
mens sana in eorpore sano, or even
of the great football game of life ring
hollow in the face of wholesale re
cruiting, use of varsity athletes from
other sports, often under assumed
names, growing injury lists, and the
mass scouting and weighty play files
that are becoming more and more
vital to a winning season.
Yet intramurals have an appeal to
sport-minded Stanford that neither
pick-up games nor the selective vars
ity teams can match. Upwards of a
thousand took a half-dozen afternoons
off this quarter to play in intramural
football games, which often drew
large crowds complete with organized
cheers and rudimentary brass bands.
What brings them out in such great
numbers is not just the exercise.
Competition Lures
Competition, of course, is a strong
lure. Intramural director Gary Ness
sees the program as primarily "a
chance for the great mass of boys
not on a varsity team to take part
in competitive athletics on a semi
organized basis," and it is a chance
that few graduates of Little League,
the junior-senior game, or the sixth
grade marbles tournament wish to
pass up. A rigidly enforced dictum
of American culture states that the
only real way to enjoy oneself
through athletics is with a real team,
in a real league, with real uniforms
(the intramural fields a kaleidoscope
of Fremont red, Sigma Chi blue, Don
nor green and Chi Psi yellow), and
the intramuralist is a willing adher
ent.
Competitive athletics, at least on
the intramural level, also present a
straightforward simplicity often miss
ing from the academic grind. What

ever pressures may adhere to a
fourthand-five situation, two last
second free throws with a one-point
deficit, or a 3-10 split with the match
riding on the outcome can be removed
quickly, decisively, and with the feel
ing that, one way or another, one can
rise or fall on one's own efforts—a
feeling hard to come by elsewhere.
Charismatic IM Chairman
But what brings them out more
than anything else is the intramural
chairman, a charismatic figure who,
by making inough of a nuisance of
himself, can generally decide the uni
versity championship. A mass In
vasion of such sports as wrestling,
weight lifting and bowling can be
more productive of points than the
hours spent—and they are—drilling
a house football team. The representa
tive intramuralist may be—nay, Is—
not the former freshman football star
who quarterbacks the university
champion, but instead the 5-8, 105-
pounder who is impressed into the
penny-weight division of the wrest
ling tournament and wins two
matches by default before he is
pinned in twenty seconds in the semi
finals, and thus assures his team of
a championship worth 25 intramural
points.
Too Much Talent
In fact, if the intramural program
has any one weak point it is not at the
lower end—participation and interest
are, if anything, growing—but at the
upper end, where both the caliber
of athlete and the competitive spirit
merge, somewhate indistinctly, with
those of a more serious level of play.
Varsity athletes, of course, are ban
ned from competing in sports they
have lettered in, but there is no law
except the coaches' against playing in
another sport, and while it hardly
seems fair to exclude a varsity team
member from playing in another in
tramural sport if he wants to, groups
which can attract varsity athletes as

well as former freshman players
(who are allowed to play in the same
sport) form a ruling class, as it were,
which dominates the major sports,
year in and year out. Not that foot
ball scores of 64-0 are that unhealthy
in themselves—they mirror, as they
are supposed to, simply a disparity in
football talent and organization be
tween the two groups, and one that
is often made up for in other sports—
but they do reflect a competition
which is often reduced to how many
of these athletes one can recruit. Nor
is all recruiting above board.
Victory Always Goal
When as diverse groups as Stan
ford's teams represent, with their di
verse images and group egos to de
fend and the outcome to be exactly
and publicly measured, are turned
loose on each other and on a com
petitive sports program, it is difficult
to set boundaries on what means may
be used to obtain what the groups are
told is the goal, victory. Everyone is
out for a good time in intramurals,
and rules are sidestepped, presum
ably, in the same spirit in which they
were made. But for anyone who takes
the program he is in and the way he
spends his time seriously—seriously
enough, if it comes down to it, to face
the risk of injuries which happen
every day in sports that really re
quire more protective equipment than
is used—the gulf between a "success
ful team" and the good time and
group participation ideals must seem
wide even here. Perhaps it is wide in
any devisable program.
But the intramural program is,
above all, enjoyable. If an excess of
competitive spirit has led to some de
fects, the same spirit provides the life
of the program, and, whatever can
be said about the price of finishing
first, that which leads one to pay such
a price- that, and no ideal of mens
sana is what makes the program not
only worthwhile but possible at all.

is often made up for in other sports—
but they do reflect a competition
which is often reduced to how many
of these athletes one can recruit. Nor
is all recruiting above board.
Victory Always Goal
When as diverse groups as Stan
ford's teams represent, with their di
verse images and group egos to de
fend and the outcome to be exactly
and publicly measured, are turned
loose on each other and on a com
petitive sports program, it is difficult
to set boundaries on what means may
be used to obtain what the groups are
told is the goal, victory. Everyone is
out for a good time in intramurals,
and rules are sidestepped, presum
ably, in the same spirit in which they
were made. But for anyone who takes
the program he is in and the way he
spends his time seriously—seriously
enough, if it comes down to it, to face
the risk of injuries which happen
every day in sports that really re
quire more protective equipment than
is used—the gulf between a "success
ful team" and the good time and
group participation ideals must seem
wide even here. Perhaps it is wide in
any devisable program.
But the intramural program is,
above all, enjoyable. If an excess of
competitive spirit has led to some de
fects, the same spirit provides the life
of the program, and, whatever can
be said about the price of finishing
first, that which leads one to pay such
a price- that, and no ideal of mens
sana is what makes the program not
only worthwhile but possible at all.
If there is a point to the Stanford
intramural program, it begins to get
a little obscure around the end of
football season. Protestations of bat
tles won on the playing fields of Eton,
mens sana in eorpore sano, or even
of the great football game of life ring
hollow in the face of wholesale re
cruiting, use of varsity athletes from
other sports, often under assumed
names, growing injury lists, and the
mass scouting and weighty play files
that are becoming more and more
vital to a winning season.
Yet intramurals have an appeal to
sport-minded Stanford that neither
pick-up games nor the selective vars
ity teams can match. Upwards of a
thousand took a half-dozen afternoons
off this quarter to play in intramural
football games, which often drew
large crowds complete with organized
cheers and rudimentary brass bands.
What brings them out in such great
numbers is not just the exercise.
Competition Lures
Competition, of course, is a strong
lure. Intramural director Gary Ness
sees the program as primarily "a
chance for the great mass of boys
not on a varsity team to take part
in competitive athletics on a semi
organized basis," and it is a chance
that few graduates of Little League,
the junior-senior game, or the sixth
grade marbles tournament wish to
pass up. A rigidly enforced dictum
of American culture states that the
only real way to enjoy oneself
through athletics is with a real team,
in a real league, with real uniforms
(the intramural fields a kaleidoscope
of Fremont red, Sigma Chi blue, Don
nor green and Chi Psi yellow), and
the intramuralist is a willing adher
ent.
Competitive athletics, at least on
the intramural level, also present a
straightforward simplicity often miss
ing from the academic grind. What

ever pressures may adhere to a
fourthand-five situation, two last
second free throws with a one-point
deficit, or a 3-10 split with the match
riding on the outcome can be removed
quickly, decisively, and with the feel
ing that, one way or another, one can
rise or fall on one's own efforts—a
feeling hard to come by elsewhere.
Charismatic IM Chairman
But what brings them out more
than anything else is the intramural
chairman, a charismatic figure who,
by making inough of a nuisance of
himself, can generally decide the uni
versity championship. A mass In
vasion of such sports as wrestling,
weight lifting and bowling can be
more productive of points than the
hours spent—and they are—drilling
a house football team. The representa
tive intramuralist may be—nay, Is—
not the former freshman football star
who quarterbacks the university
champion, but instead the 5-8, 105-
pounder who is impressed into the
penny-weight division of the wrest
ling tournament and wins two
matches by default before he is
pinned in twenty seconds in the semi
finals, and thus assures his team of
a championship worth 25 intramural
points.
Too Much Talent
In fact, if the intramural program
has any one weak point it is not at the
lower end—participation and interest
are, if anything, growing—but at the
upper end, where both the caliber
of athlete and the competitive spirit
merge, somewhate indistinctly, with
those of a more serious level of play.
Varsity athletes, of course, are ban
ned from competing in sports they
have lettered in, but there is no law
except the coaches' against playing in
another sport, and while it hardly
seems fair to exclude a varsity team
member from playing in another in
tramural sport if he wants to, groups
which can attract varsity athletes as

well as former freshman players
(who are allowed to play in the same
sport) form a ruling class, as it were,
which dominates the major sports,
year in and year out. Not that foot
ball scores of 64-0 are that unhealthy
in themselves—they mirror, as they
are supposed to, simply a disparity in
football talent and organization be
tween the two groups, and one that
is often made up for in other sports—
but they do reflect a competition
which is often reduced to how many
of these athletes one can recruit. Nor
is all recruiting above board.

a house football team. The representa
tive intramuralist may be—nay, Is—
not the former freshman football star
who quarterbacks the university
champion, but instead the 5-8, 105-
pounder who is impressed into the
penny-weight division of the wrest
ling tournament and wins two
matches by default before he is
pinned in twenty seconds in the semi
finals, and thus assures his team of
a championship worth 25 intramural
points.
Too Much Talent
In fact, if the intramural program
has any one weak point it is not at the
lower end—participation and interest
are, if anything, growing—but at the
upper end, where both the caliber
of athlete and the competitive spirit
merge, somewhate indistinctly, with
those of a more serious level of play.
Varsity athletes, of course, are ban
ned from competing in sports they
have lettered in, but there is no law
except the coaches' against playing in
another sport, and while it hardly
seems fair to exclude a varsity team
member from playing in another in
tramural sport if he wants to, groups
which can attract varsity athletes as

well as former freshman players
(who are allowed to play in the same
sport) form a ruling class, as it were,
which dominates the major sports,
year in and year out. Not that foot
ball scores of 64-0 are that unhealthy
in themselves—they mirror, as they
are supposed to, simply a disparity in
football talent and organization be
tween the two groups, and one that
is often made up for in other sports—
but they do reflect a competition
which is often reduced to how many
of these athletes one can recruit. Nor
is all recruiting above board.
Victory Always Goal
When as diverse groups as Stan
ford's teams represent, with their di
verse images and group egos to de
fend and the outcome to be exactly
and publicly measured, are turned
loose on each other and on a com
petitive sports program, it is difficult
to set boundaries on what means may
be used to obtain what the groups are
told is the goal, victory. Everyone is
out for a good time in intramurals,
and rules are sidestepped, presum
ably, in the same spirit in which they
were made. But for anyone who takes
the program he is in and the way he
spends his time seriously—seriously
enough, if it comes down to it, to face
the risk of injuries which happen
every day in sports that really re
quire more protective equipment than
is used—the gulf between a "success
ful team" and the good time and
group participation ideals must seem
wide even here. Perhaps it is wide in
any devisable program.
But the intramural program is,
above all, enjoyable. If an excess of
competitive spirit has led to some de
fects, the same spirit provides the life
of the program, and, whatever can
be said about the price of finishing
first, that which leads one to pay such
a price- that, and no ideal of mens
sana is what makes the program not
only worthwhile but possible at all.
If there is a point to the Stanford
intramural program, it begins to get
a little obscure around the end of
football season. Protestations of bat
tles won on the playing fields of Eton,
mens sana in eorpore sano, or even
of the great football game of life ring
hollow in the face of wholesale re
cruiting, use of varsity athletes from
other sports, often under assumed
names, growing injury lists, and the
mass scouting and weighty play files
that are becoming more and more
vital to a winning season.
Yet intramurals have an appeal to
sport-minded Stanford that neither
pick-up games nor the selective vars
ity teams can match. Upwards of a
thousand took a half-dozen afternoons
off this quarter to play in intramural
football games, which often drew
large crowds complete with organized
cheers and rudimentary brass bands.
What brings them out in such great
numbers is not just the exercise.
Competition Lures
Competition, of course, is a strong
lure. Intramural director Gary Ness
sees the program as primarily "a
chance for the great mass of boys
not on a varsity team to take part
in competitive athletics on a semi
organized basis," and it is a chance
that few graduates of Little League,
the junior-senior game, or the sixth
grade marbles tournament wish to
pass up. A rigidly enforced dictum
of American culture states that the
only real way to enjoy oneself
through athletics is with a real team,
in a real league, with real uniforms
(the intramural fields a kaleidoscope
of Fremont red, Sigma Chi blue, Don
nor green and Chi Psi yellow), and
the intramuralist is a willing adher
ent.
Competitive athletics, at least on
the intramural level, also present a
straightforward simplicity often miss
ing from the academic grind. What

ever pressures may adhere to a
fourthand-five situation, two last
second free throws with a one-point
deficit, or a 3-10 split with the match
riding on the outcome can be removed
quickly, decisively, and with the feel
ing that, one way or another, one can
rise or fall on one's own efforts—a
feeling hard to come by elsewhere.
Charismatic IM Chairman
But what brings them out more
than anything else is the intramural
chairman, a charismatic figure who,
by making inough of a nuisance of
himself, can generally decide the uni
versity championship. A mass In
vasion of such sports as wrestling,
weight lifting and bowling can be
more productive of points than the
hours spent—and they are—drilling
a house football team. The representa
tive intramuralist may be—nay, Is—
not the former freshman football star
who quarterbacks the university
champion, but instead the 5-8, 105-
pounder who is impressed into the
