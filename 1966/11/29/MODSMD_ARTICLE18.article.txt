# BAC Cuts Distinctions Between Intercollegiate Athletics, Phys Ed
## 
### TOM EDISON 
The athletic department at Stan
ford plays a role shared by few uni
versities in the country.
This uniqueness originated ten
years ago when the academic council
at Stanford dropped the two-year phy
sical education requirement and sub
stituted in its place a six-quarter
"Group Activity" requirement. With
this change in the physical education
program at Stanford came a change
in the overall structure of the athletic
department.
The uniqueness of Stanford's role
in athletics originates in the duality
of its program; no longer is there a
distinct separation between intercol
legiate athletics and physical educa
tion.
Taylor: Two Roles
At the present time Chuck Taylor
holds the dual role as Director of
Athletics and Physical Education. The
financing, staff members and physical
plant of athletics and physical edu
cation are virtually inseparable.
Intramurals exist as a buffer be
tween the two systems and contri
butes a continuity to the athletic pro
gram. The IM program rivals any
academic system at Stanford for its
diversity but singularity of purpose.
It too is supervised and financed by

the Athletic Department and has
vastly extended its resources in the
last ten years with competition
throughout the year existing in 16
different sports.
Six Areas of Involvement
In a handbook prepared for the De
partment of Physical Education and
Athletics by Wes Ruff, Associate Pro
fessor of Physical Education and Edu
cation, is outlined the six areas of
involvement of the department;
— The intercollegiate sports pro
gram is for Stanford's physically
gifted students who excel in and en
joy vigorous competitive athletics.
— The intramural sports program
is offered for students who enjoy and
seek out competition in organized
athletics, but who, for various rea
sons, are not participants in the inter
collegiate program.
— The physical education instruc
tion program is open to all Stanford
students for instruction and participa
tion in sports and fitness activities.
— The informal recreation pro
gram is for those students and facul
ty-staff members who wish to partici
pate in sports on an individual and
informal basis.
— The profession preparation pro
gram is provided in cooperation with
the School of Education for those in
terested in pursuing physical educa
tion as a profession.
— The University-community ser
vice program involves the operation
of coaching camps for children and
the summer recreation program of
swimming and tennis for faculty,
staff, and students.
BAC Advisory Function
Assisting the athletic programs at
Stanford is a committee of 24 alumni
appointed by President Sterling. This
committee serves merely as an ad
visory board through which the Ath
letic and Physical Education Depart
ment can obtain advice and opinion
from supposedly unbiased profession
al men in regards to problems that
may come up. This committee is The
Board of Athletic Control.
The Department of Physical Edu
cation and Athletics has a staff of 23
coaches to assist in running an effec
tive intercollegiate program of ath
letics. Numerous teaching assistants
are also used in organizing this pro
gram and they also handle most of
the instruction in the physical educa
tion classes.
The financial resources of the De
partment of Physical Education and
changes in the last four years.
Athletics Not Independent
Several years ago the athletic pro
gram at Stanford was able to exist
almost on its own. There was little
assistance from the University. How
ever, because of the increase in the
upkeep of its facilities and a decrease
in outside revenue the Department
has come to rely more and more on
University aid.
According to Assistant Athletic Di
rector, Bob Young, the University
previously only relinquished around
$40,000 to the athletic budget. Pres
ently, however, the University contri
butes around $200,000.
The athletic budget is under the
close scrutiny of Bob Butler through
whom must come salaries for the
coaches, the physical education in
structors, the intramural assistances,
and the expenses for each intercolleg
iate sport, physical education class,
and intramurai event.
Reevaluatlon
The financial burden that all these
items place on the Department of
Physical Education and Athletics has
caused a reevaluation of its areas of
involvment. One cut back that was
initiated this year was in the number

of sports the University would be
come involved in. This number was
set at 14.
This means that all other sports
activities must receive financial as
istance outside the athletic depart
ment. The responsibility for handling
the finances of these other "clubs"
has been given to the Dean of Stu
dents. The Dean's Office has been pro
vided with a limited sum of money
to assist in the sponsoring of these
minor sports.
Help For "Club" Teams
The Department of Physical Educa
tion and Athletics does, however, still
provide advice, assistance, and facili
ties for these clubs. Some of these
clubs are lacrosse, cycling, and
cricket.

The Department through the a us
pices of the Department of Educa
tion also provides instruction in
coaching and administrating athletics.
The classes, although under the guid
ance of the Education Department are
also financed by the Department of
Physical Education and Athletics.
No PE Degrees
Although no four-year physical
education degrees as such are
awarded at Stanford, the Department
of Education has an intensified five
year program for individuals who are
interested in physical education as a
profession. Under the guidance ( 1
John E. Nixon this limited program
requires regular four-year acader
subjects with preparation for tea
ing credentials in physical educr. 1
