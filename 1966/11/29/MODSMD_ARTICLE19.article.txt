# PE Courses Change, Improve With Years
## 
### BILL GRAHAM 
Freshmen coming into Stanford are
in very good physical condition. They
can, for example, do six more pull-ups
than their counterparts around the
country. The aim of the university's
physical education program is to
maintain and improve this condition
ing. help the student develop new
skills, foster an interest in various
sports, and show the student that he
has a body as well as a mind.
Ten years ago the Academic Coun
cil dropped its requirement that stu
dents take physical education for all
six quarters of their first two years
at Stanford, changing to the present
six unit group activity requirement,
only two of which must be in physical
education. This was done because al
though it was felt that sports were
important, it was thought that they
shouldn't overshadow other activities.
Expansion
The change in the requirement
meant that the physical education de
partment would have to Improve and
expand in order to maintain interest
and its enrollment.
Formerly the department had only
offered instruction in the major
sports, those in which Stanford al
ready had a director. Slowly regular
physical education instructors were
added, beginning with tennis, until
the department accumulated its pres
ent varied curriculum. The success of
this program is shown by the fact
that last quarter there were 2,200 men
in physical education classes.
In addition to offering more courses,
the department recently began to of
fer choices on a group activity basis.
This means that students can form
and organize a group and under the
supervision of a faculty sponsor to
check attendance, may be given one
group activity credit.
From this plan dubs in skiing, sail
ing, karate and folk dancing have
been formed. These clubs are admini
stered through the Associated Stu
dents, not the Department of Physical
Education, due tr a lack of funds, al
though the department offers advice
and facilities.
Play, Not Instruction
A further ramification of this new
policy is courses which are designed
for those who desire to play and do
not want instruction. Although a
teaching assistant supervises the
classes and is available to help, the
primary goal is for the boys In It to
participate actively In the sport they
have chosen.

The newest innovation undertnk
by the department is that of an
tivity club under the direction of i
student leader. Last year one fresl"
man house was allowed to form
groups of from five to ten men who
wished to engage in a sport together
These groups elected a leader who
was responsible for attendance, sche
dule facilities and instruction. In ad
dition a professional instructor visit
ed the classes once every three meet
ings.
This program offered not only more
direct student participation but also
gave valuable training to the leader.
Student response to the program
proved to be enthusiastic and it is
possible in the future that physical
education instruction will tend to be
come more and more like this.
Grades?
This constant revision of the physi
cal education program makes the de
partment a very interesting one. The
question remains, however, as to
whether or not grades should be given
for the classes in an institution such
as Stanford which is well known for
its academic excellence, and where
there are no physical education
majors.
Dr. Wesley Ruff, Associate Profes
sor of Physical Education and Educa
tion, feels that since the courses are
given as part of university activity,
grades should be given, providing
"some of the status that the activity
needs."
Undeniably grades also give an add
ed incentive to the participants. Des
pite the belief of some that you only
have to show up to get an "A", stand
ards have been set in many of the
courses which the students must
meet for a high giade. These goals
provide more interest even for those
who are taking a class for a non-cre
dit activity unit. The standards are
constantly reevaluated and the de
partment is trying to establish them
in those classes where there are none
as yet.
In addition to fulfilling the needs
of the students, the physical educa
tion program often serves as a step
ping stone to varsity teams. This is
particularly true in sports such as
boxing, which is offered by relatively
few high schools and in which the
department offers excellent Instruc
tion. Last year's captain of the gym
nastics team, Bob Cook, started off i
the gymnastics class offered by "ie

From this plan dubs in skiing, sail
ing, karate and folk dancing have
been formed. These clubs are admini
stered through the Associated Stu
dents, not the Department of Physical
Education, due tr a lack of funds, al
though the department offers advice
and facilities.
Play, Not Instruction
A further ramification of this new
policy is courses which are designed
for those who desire to play and do
not want instruction. Although a
teaching assistant supervises the
classes and is available to help, the
primary goal is for the boys In It to
participate actively In the sport they
have chosen.

The newest innovation undertnk
by the department is that of an
tivity club under the direction of i
student leader. Last year one fresl"
man house was allowed to form
groups of from five to ten men who
wished to engage in a sport together
These groups elected a leader who
was responsible for attendance, sche
dule facilities and instruction. In ad
dition a professional instructor visit
ed the classes once every three meet
ings.
This program offered not only more
direct student participation but also
gave valuable training to the leader.
Student response to the program
proved to be enthusiastic and it is
possible in the future that physical
education instruction will tend to be
come more and more like this.
Grades?
This constant revision of the physi
cal education program makes the de
partment a very interesting one. The
question remains, however, as to
whether or not grades should be given
for the classes in an institution such
as Stanford which is well known for
its academic excellence, and where
there are no physical education
majors.
Dr. Wesley Ruff, Associate Profes
sor of Physical Education and Educa
tion, feels that since the courses are
given as part of university activity,
grades should be given, providing
"some of the status that the activity
needs."
Undeniably grades also give an add
ed incentive to the participants. Des
pite the belief of some that you only
have to show up to get an "A", stand
ards have been set in many of the
courses which the students must
meet for a high giade. These goals
provide more interest even for those
who are taking a class for a non-cre
dit activity unit. The standards are
constantly reevaluated and the de
partment is trying to establish them
in those classes where there are none
as yet.
In addition to fulfilling the needs
of the students, the physical educa
tion program often serves as a step
ping stone to varsity teams. This is
particularly true in sports such as
boxing, which is offered by relatively
few high schools and in which the
department offers excellent Instruc
tion. Last year's captain of the gym
nastics team, Bob Cook, started off i
the gymnastics class offered by "ie
department.
Freshmen coming into Stanford are
in very good physical condition. They
can, for example, do six more pull-ups
than their counterparts around the
country. The aim of the university's
physical education program is to
maintain and improve this condition
ing. help the student develop new
skills, foster an interest in various
sports, and show the student that he
has a body as well as a mind.
Ten years ago the Academic Coun
cil dropped its requirement that stu
dents take physical education for all
six quarters of their first two years
at Stanford, changing to the present
six unit group activity requirement,
only two of which must be in physical
education. This was done because al
though it was felt that sports were
important, it was thought that they
shouldn't overshadow other activities.
Expansion
The change in the requirement
meant that the physical education de
partment would have to Improve and
expand in order to maintain interest
and its enrollment.
Formerly the department had only
offered instruction in the major
sports, those in which Stanford al
ready had a director. Slowly regular
physical education instructors were
added, beginning with tennis, until
the department accumulated its pres
ent varied curriculum. The success of
this program is shown by the fact
that last quarter there were 2,200 men
in physical education classes.
In addition to offering more courses,
the department recently began to of
fer choices on a group activity basis.
This means that students can form
and organize a group and under the
supervision of a faculty sponsor to
check attendance, may be given one
group activity credit.
From this plan dubs in skiing, sail
ing, karate and folk dancing have
been formed. These clubs are admini

majors.
Dr. Wesley Ruff, Associate Profes
sor of Physical Education and Educa
tion, feels that since the courses are
given as part of university activity,
grades should be given, providing
"some of the status that the activity
needs."
Undeniably grades also give an add
ed incentive to the participants. Des
pite the belief of some that you only
have to show up to get an "A", stand
ards have been set in many of the
courses which the students must
meet for a high giade. These goals
provide more interest even for those
who are taking a class for a non-cre
dit activity unit. The standards are
constantly reevaluated and the de
partment is trying to establish them
in those classes where there are none
as yet.
In addition to fulfilling the needs
of the students, the physical educa
tion program often serves as a step
ping stone to varsity teams. This is
particularly true in sports such as
boxing, which is offered by relatively
few high schools and in which the
department offers excellent Instruc
tion. Last year's captain of the gym
nastics team, Bob Cook, started off i
the gymnastics class offered by "ie
department.
