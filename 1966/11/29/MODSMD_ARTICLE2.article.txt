# Panel Studies Role Of Frats
## 
### 
The Programs Division of the Tres
idder Union Board will sponsor a
panel discussion on "Fraternities and
the University" tonight at 8 p.m. In
the TMU lounge.
Members of the panel will be Dave
Harris, ASSU President, Leith Ander
son, Dick Williams, Peter Love, and
Dale Matschullat. The panel will at
tempt to define the role of the fra
ternity within the university, and to
clarify the issues which will deter
mine the future of fraternities at
Stanford.
Dave Harris, Student Body President,
disapproves of the selective member
ship system and feels that fraternities
could contribute more to the Univer
sity than they do vt present.
Leith Anderson is a deactivated
Kappa Sigma who co-authored "A
Second Look," a pamphlet which asks
freshmen to reconsider before rush
ing or pledging a fraternity. This
year Anderson is a sponsor in Otero.
Dick Williams is president of Beta
Chi, and it was under his leadership
that this fraternity recently decided to
adopt an "open-door" policy. Selec
tion has been dropped in favor of a
draw system for living spaces. Any
one can be a member of the fra
ternity and thus eat in the house and
join its activities.
Peter Love is an active member of
Theta Delta Chi and is considered by
many to be a staunch supporter of
the fraternity system.
Dale Matschullat, a member of Phi
Sigma Kappa, was the IFC represen
tative to the Fraternity Subcommittee
of the Housing Commission this fall
until it was reconstituted.
Philip H. Rinelander, Professor of
Philosophy and chairman of the Com
mittee of 15, will moderate the dis
cussion.
