# VISTA Finds Stanford Responsive
## 
### WILL HOBBS 
Though forced under Book
store and Post Office rafters by
yesterdays rain, VISTA recruit
ers report considerable Stanford
interest in the Great Society
backed "domestic Peace Corps."
Today they conclude their ef
forts by maintaining a booth in
White Plaza throughout the day
and showing a VISTA movie in
Tresidder at 12 noon and at 7
p.m.
Biology graduate student Rick
Gibbs, contacted by The Daily,
told of his year long experience
working with farm laborers near
Sarasota, Florida. Working
with a team of VISTA Volun
teers in an out-of-the-way mi
grant labor camp, Gibbs was in
volved in pre-school and after
school study projects, commu
nity organizations, and local
health and emergency work.
Poor Pay More
He said that the adage "the
poor pay more" is unfortunately
very true: they are paying "out
rageous prices" for food and

clothing. Five and six-year-old
children have never seen a doc
tor, and quickly slip behind in
school.
Gibbs termed VISTA relations
with the local white community
generally good. Much of VIS
TA's work materials were do
nated by local church groups.
He said that relations with the
local growers started satisfac
torily, but their attitude degen
erated to "toleration" when it
became clear that the VISTA
volunteers stood for such goals
as a minimum wage and bar
gaining rights for workers.
Some considered them Commu
nist troublemakers.
Mary Ann Lindblade, repre
senting VISTA's national office
in the organization's two-day
drive at Stanford, stressed that
the need for volunteers is very
great. A total of 8,705 volunteers
has been requested to serve on
714 projects in all 50 states, the
District of Columbia and the
U.S. territories.
Applicants are allowed consid

erable choice among VISTA
projects: they generally work
with the urban or rural poor,
and often specialize in work
with migrant laborers, Indians,
the mentally ill, and Job Corps
enlistees.
In the present drive at Stan
ford, VISTA is offering gradu
ating seniors and graduate stu
dents immediate interviews and
decisions. Interested applicants

can also choose the normal de
layed decision.
She expressed a present need
for volunteers in Appalachla,
New York City, Job Corps
camps, conservation centers, and
in recreation centers next sum
mer. Summer volunteers are
free from the normal year-long
commitment and bi-week train
ing period.
VISTA works by responding

to local requests for help. Si
soring agencies within a c
munity spell out a project
supply support lor VISTA w
it arrives. VISTA volunt*
tend to come from very diffci
social and educational b;
grounds, and work for v
little pay. VISTA provides a
ing allowance and pays its
unteers $50 per month a
their year of service.
