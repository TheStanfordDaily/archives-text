# New Student Directory Generates Excitement

The Autumn 1966 Student Di
rectory is the University's major
production of the year and for
1966 it is a pleasure to say that
it is an outstanding success.

Flipping through the Direc
tory is an experience in itself.
Ranging from David Aaker to
Stephen Zwick, the Directory in
cludes every student at Stanford.
And as an added attraction,
the Directory features the
1965 Dean's List. The List
exciting as well as informative,
separates the men from the
boys, the girls from the women,
and the women from the men.
It is a youthful publication,
with 33 Youngs and only two
Olds. It takes no stand on the
War In Vietnam, with one Dover
and one Hawk.
Governor Reagan's investigat
ing committee will have diffi
culty when they visit Stanford
— there Is only one Redd. Of
course, there are three Regans.
Perhaps the Directory at
tempts to predict the outcome
of the 1968 election, too, telling
us that there are 11 Kennedys
and 74 Johnsons here.
Black Power appears to be
losing at Stanford. There are
only 14 Blacks compared to 23
Whites. But what about the 52
Browns, the 20 Greens (and
Greenes) and the 14 Grays?
Significantly, there is no trace
of Purple power.
There are four McNamaras,
but only one Rusk.
