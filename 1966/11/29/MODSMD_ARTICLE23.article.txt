# Otto Crumbles In 250th Game; League Expansion Voted Out
## 
### 
The WCCL reached its 250 th
game last week with Otto still
trailing by six garrvs 128-122,
but leading by 228 total points.
This milestone was attained
amid rumors of discrimination.
It seems that the two charter
members of the WCCL don't
want to expand the league.
"It would lose its identity, its
oneness, and it wouldn't be ir
revocable anymore," claimed
Otto. Two aspirants—Rook and
Marcus want "in." Both claim
that they could dominate the
conference. Crane felt that if
they wanted to play Casino they
could start their own league.
Both WCCL members felt that
it would be a waste of many
hours to start all over again.
It's taken about 130 hours for

the first 250 games. "Also, we
have to start scheduling games,
and that's a bore." Neither
would consider the possibility of
incoporating the two new mem
bers without creating new stand
ings. Both agree that it would
have been nice to have had a
four man league at the outset,
but "we couldn't get anyone else
to join then."
Rook and Marcus want to join
the league but don't want to
start one of their own. "Two
team leagues are absurd," feels
Marcus, "and that's why we
won't start another one."
It appears as though there
won't be any expansion, there
fore, for "negotiations" have
broken down. Both sides have
stated their case.
