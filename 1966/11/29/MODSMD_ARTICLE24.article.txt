LAS VEGAS (AP) — Soviet
and French athletes may be get
ting an edge on U.S. competitors
in the 1968 Mexico City Olym
pics by constantly training at
high altitudes, says an Ameri
can physician.
Dr. Roy F. Goddard of Al
buquerque, N.M., said in an in
terview at the American Medical
Association annual clinical con
vention yesterday:
"The thin air at Mexico City
at 7,300-foot altitudes means per
formance times will be longer—
there probably will be no rec
ords set in maximum endurance
events such as swimming and
running.
"The Olympic committee has
set the limit of four weeks of
training in Mexico City prior
to the games—but there is no
prohibition against training at
high altitudes elsewhere be
tween now and then.
"We know that camps have

been established in mountainous
areas of Russia and France for
potential Olympic contestants,
and I personally think American
athletes would benefit too from a
similar program in this coun
try."
Goddard, director of pediatrics
research at the Lovelace Foun
dation, Albuquerque, recently
made a study showing swim
mers in the October 1965 in
ternational sports week at Mex
ico City failed to approach their
previous records at see level.
"The body needs time—at least
three weeks, and six weeks prob
ably would be better—to adjust
to high altitudes, to increase the
intake of oxygen and in an at
mosphere where less oxygen is
available," he said.
"This adjustment period can
be reduced with periodic train
ing at high altitude. Athletes
who do this will acclimatize
more quickly in Mexico City
and probably do better in com
petition."
Goddard said his study showed
some indications that athletes
gained by high altitude training
prior to events calling for all

out performance, even if the
events are held at sea level.
He said swimmers trained at
the 5,300-foot level at Albuquer
que lowered their times in com
petition at sea level.
Dr. Merrit Stiles of Spokane,
Wash., second vice president of
the U.S. Olympic committee,
told the convention there is no
reason to fear for the safety
of athletes in the 1958 games.
"Competitors will be in no
greater danger than they would
be competing with an equivalent
effort at sea level," he said.
He agreed, however, that per
formances will not be as good
as at sea level.
Goddard said he foresees no
danger in running events up to
10,000 meters or swimming
events up to 1,500 meters.

greater danger than they would
be competing with an equivalent
effort at sea level," he said.
He agreed, however, that per
formances will not be as good
as at sea level.
Goddard said he foresees no
danger in running events up to
10,000 meters or swimming
events up to 1,500 meters.
LAS VEGAS (AP) — Soviet
and French athletes may be get
ting an edge on U.S. competitors
in the 1968 Mexico City Olym
pics by constantly training at
high altitudes, says an Ameri
can physician.
Dr. Roy F. Goddard of Al
buquerque, N.M., said in an in
terview at the American Medical
Association annual clinical con
vention yesterday:
"The thin air at Mexico City
at 7,300-foot altitudes means per
formance times will be longer—
there probably will be no rec
ords set in maximum endurance
events such as swimming and
running.
"The Olympic committee has
set the limit of four weeks of
training in Mexico City prior
to the games—but there is no
prohibition against training at
high altitudes elsewhere be
tween now and then.
"We know that camps have

been established in mountainous
areas of Russia and France for
potential Olympic contestants,
and I personally think American
athletes would benefit too from a
similar program in this coun
try."
Goddard, director of pediatrics
research at the Lovelace Foun
dation, Albuquerque, recently
made a study showing swim
mers in the October 1965 in
ternational sports week at Mex
ico City failed to approach their
previous records at see level.
"The body needs time—at least
three weeks, and six weeks prob
ably would be better—to adjust
to high altitudes, to increase the
intake of oxygen and in an at
mosphere where less oxygen is
available," he said.
"This adjustment period can
be reduced with periodic train
ing at high altitude. Athletes
who do this will acclimatize
more quickly in Mexico City
and probably do better in com
petition."
Goddard said his study showed
some indications that athletes
gained by high altitude training
prior to events calling for all

out performance, even if the
events are held at sea level.
He said swimmers trained at
the 5,300-foot level at Albuquer
que lowered their times in com
petition at sea level.
Dr. Merrit Stiles of Spokane,
Wash., second vice president of
the U.S. Olympic committee,
told the convention there is no
reason to fear for the safety
of athletes in the 1958 games.
"Competitors will be in no
greater danger than they would
be competing with an equivalent
effort at sea level," he said.
He agreed, however, that per
formances will not be as good
as at sea level.
