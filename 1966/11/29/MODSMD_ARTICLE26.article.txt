The outlook is wet footballs
bathed in mud, but intramural
action is expected to continue
today as the playoff field is
pared to four.
Though the complete sched
ule, which depended on yester
day's outcomes, was not avail
able at press time, one key
game is certain: S.A.E. against
Beta Biz.
The remarkable win streak of
S.A.E.'s "Cardiac Kids," pro
longed in last week's 7-6 de
feat of Blackacre, Is in real
jeopardy against the Business
School, which had things its own
way in an impressive 19-0 white
washing of El Toro.
