# SIMMERING OVER SEMMERING
## Walker Replies To Austria Critics 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
May I express my apprecia
tion for the fine series of articles
on the Overseas Campuses in
the issue of Wednesday, Novem
ber 23. They do much to restore
balance to a discussion that
seemed to be getting rather
more frenetic than enlightening!
I have just returned from Eu
rope, where I visited our cam
puses and participated in a
highly rewarding conference
with all of the European Cam
pus Directors. The dedication of
our European staff to the inter
ests of Stanford students and
the University has once again
impressed me greatly. They care
a great deal about the success
of each of their campuses in
providing a valuable educational
opportunity for each student
who attends. At the same time
they all agree with one of the
central themes of last Wednes
day's articles — they can pro
vide the opportunity, but capital
izing upon it depends greatly
upon individual student initiative
and intelligent self-direction. To
improve and strengthen the op
portunities, in the light of the
many suggestions that have been
made, the Directors have unani
mously recommended a series of
changes in the academic pro
gram and in the übiquitous
"regs."
But that is a separate story to
be reported soon. My trip also
took me to Austria. There I
learned for the first time about
the letter from Professor Spitz
and Mark Edwards, President of
Austria 111, which had been
mailed to The Daily just three
days before my arrival at the
Panhans. I was a bit puzzled at
the obvious desire to make the
public prints in advance of any
possible discussion of the ques
tions involved. I was even more
puzzled when I learned that the
letters had been discussed with
neither Professor Koringer, Di
rector of Studies, nor Dr. Straub,
the Director of Administration.
Both of these men are life-long
residents of Vienna. Professor
Korninger is both Chairman of
the Department of English and,
this year, Dean of the Faculty
of Letters at the University of
Vienna. Dr. Straub has been
working with Americans in Aus
tria for over twenty years, form
erly with the American Embassy
and now with Stanford. They are
keenly interested in the suc
cess and best interests of Stan
ford's program in Austria, and
both were frankly rather
shocked that Professor Spitz
should have written so cate
gorical a denunciation of the
present location of Stanford in
Austria without any consulta
tion. I repeat, both men know
Vienna intimately and they know
the pros and cons of locating
there, as well as the difficulties
of finding a place. But avoiding
consultations is Professor Spitz's
privilege. The question is wheth
er or not he is right
Vienna Disadvantages
He might be. But the Directors
both expressed the opinion that
there are disadvantages to being
in Vienna that Professor Spitz
had ignored. Opera, theater, and
concerts would be more accessi
ble, it is true. So also would be
a host of non-cultural diversions
and other American students.
Austrian students do not gen
erally congregate around Uni
versity buildings for easy access
in the evenings. There Is no
campus life in the American
sense; students commute to lec
tures and disappear again into
the enormous sponge of a great
city. Meeting them would take
effort and organization, just as
it does now. More serious, how

ever, is the fact that it would be
easy to lose entirely one of the
major values of an overseas
campus—a real community of
students, faculty, and staff mem
bers living, eating, and talking
together to establish the per
sonal rapport so rarely found
on the Quad. Faculty and staff,
as well as students, would tend
more to disperse to private
pursuits after classes.
One of the more experienced
Stanford professors teaching
overseas has observed, in com
menting upon moving to Vienna,
that there is a great difference
between the great city and
smaller towns in the accessibility
of the people to oar students. In
tensive contact with nationals,
he suggests, varies inversely
with the size of the town and
the number of American tour
ists. This contact has been one
of the more valuable aspects of
Stanford overseas study, and
our experience to date supports
his observation.
It is not at all certain that
facilities in Vienna can be found
readily. The housing shortage is
severe. Rent controls based on
World War I index figures have
killed virtually all private con
struction in recent years. Gov
ernment housing is under full
control of the ruling political
parties with resulting complica
tions of party identification in
securing access to it. So tight is
the situation that the University
of Vienna has reportedly en
countered difficulty in recruiting
faculty from the provincial uni
versities because suitable hous
ing was not available. Be that as
it may, we have looked for fa
cilities in Vienna. When Mr.
Dwight Adams, the University
Business Manager, and I orig
inally explored the possibilities,
we located two in Vienna, one
in Baden (about 20 km. from
Vienna), one in the Tyrol, and
the Panhans Hotel. Both Vienna
locations were impossible, one
too small and one too ancient.
Baden was promising, but the
owners insisted on keeping the
central and best building of a
three-building complex for hotel
guests, with Stanford students
barred except for meals. The
Tyrol we rejected as too isolated.
Hence the Semmering.
Semmering Too Far?
Which leaves the question of
whether or not the Semmering
is too far from Vienna for any
good educational use. Perhaps,
but Professor Spitz's dramatic
arrival at certainty is a bit pre
mature. It is most difficult to
judge such a complex issue defi
nitely after only one year's
operating experience. Not all of
the professors who have taught
there agree with him, nor do all
of the students—as Carl Mundt
of Austria I made clear last
Wednesday. Being within street
car distance of downtown Vienna
might not make all that much
difference on weekday nights.
Studies still take time. I found
this true, for example, at the
Intercollegiate Center for Classi
cal Studies which is fifteen min
utes from the heart of Rome.
Students seldom go out on week

nights. Also, Dr. Straub finds
that if he gets nine tickets for a
performance of the Vienna Phil
harmonic, the Opera, or the
theater for Wednesday night,
then provides a free bus leaving
at five o'clock and returning
after the event (usually 12 or
1 a.m. at the Semmering), he
cannot find enough "takers"
among eighty students. If they
lived on the outskirts of Vienna
and took public transportation,
as proposed, they would have to
leave by six and wouldn't be
back until eleven or later. Hence
the excuse I heard at the Pan
hans that "it takes too much
time" is not entirely convincing.
But there is a problem of dis
tance, and what are we doing to
help deal with it? First, no one
is opposed to being nearer Vien
na if this should prove possible.
That was our original hope. I
have asked our Austrian Direc
tors to look into every cogent
possibility for new locations. In
fact, Dr. Straub had looked at
one a day or two before Dr.
Spitz sent his letter. It was much
too small. I have asked Profes
sor Spitz to send me his sug
gestions for such a search.
Secondly, Stanford in Austria
has launched a new and inex
pensive bus run to Vienna each
Friday morning. Round trip will
be 80 cents, not the railway's
$4. It will leave early in the day,
return late—after the cultural
attractions have closed, and the
Heurigen have been reasonably
sampled. This time and sched
ule were suggested by cabinet
officers of Austria 111. Obviously,
students need not return on the
bus. They can remain in Vienna
for the weekend or take off for
further travels as they wish.
Window To The East
Finally, I want to suggest that
being sixty miles from Vienna
does not automatically wipe out
the educational value of Stan
ford in Austria. Stanford stu
dents are just not that immobi
lized. One of the great values of
being in Austria has been ob
scured by all of the recent
hoopla over location, maid ser
vice, and "oppressive" dress
standards. Austria is and will
remain for many years the
West's "Window to the East"—a
phrase from Chancellor Klaus'
dedication address at the Cen
ter. The Campus is excellently
located for access to the East,
and all Stanford students going
to Austria will travel behind the
Iron Curtain, on official trips and
often on their own. If this be not
educational in the best sense,
then reports from the hundreds
of students overseas who have
made such trips are without
value. Here indeed is a rich
source of new insights and
broadened perspectives—and our
aim is liberal education.
Stanford in Austria offers a
valuable dimension in general
education whether it is at the
Semmering or near Vienna. Aus
trians abound sixty miles south
of Vienna, and they are not idiots
suitable only lor the observation
of quaint folkways or the prac
tice of elementary German, as
Professor Spitz suggests. TTiey

may come for a few days of
relaxation, they may live at the
Semmering, they may be found
in the nearby county seat of
Murzzuschlag or at Gloggnitz
ten minutes down the road. As
at the other European campuses,
they are not always the nation's
intellectuals, but with only a
little effort at getting acquainted
they will tell students what
they think about contemporary
problems, about the War and
the all-too-recent Russian occu
pation, and about what they
value most in their way of life.
And it will be in German. Just
a little effort is all it takes, even
as education on the Quad.
Overseas Subcommittee
In closing, I note that Pro
cessor Spitz calls for interest
by the faculty of Humanities
and Sciences. This we welcome,
as indeed we welcome construc
tive comments and suggestions
from students. To facilitate han
dling such suggestions, the
Committee on General Studies
recently created a Subcommit
tee on Overseas Campuses to
advise it on relevant matters.
The faculty members are Pro
fessors George Knoles (His
tory), John Loftis (English),
Lorie Tarshis (Economics), Da
vid Regnery (Biology), and F.
W. Strothmann (Modern Euro
pean Languages). The student
members are Martha Bell (Aus
tria I), Sheldon Shaeffer (Ger
many XIV), Steve Tipton (Italy
XI), and Bob Vestal (France
IX). The student members are
members also of the Overseas
Campuses Board, which is a
highly useful channel of stu
dent opinion and of assistance
in the orientation of new groups.
It is my sincere hope that we
can now get useful and construc
tive suggestions into proper
lines for serious consideration.
With such weighty matters as
coping with maid service, adapt
ing to European (not just Aus
tria) ideas about the American
use of electricity, and dressing
in a manner which does not of
fend European standards, we
shall continue to grapple in the
preparatory session. We have
our home-grown examples of the
American who rejects out of
hand the idea that he should
adapt to any foreing cultural dif
ferences (cf. Lederer and Bur
dick), but it is not a major
problem. Stanford students are,
one the whole, well liked in the
areas in which we have cam
puses and have done an excel
lent job of maintaining local
receptivity for those who will
follow them. The Overseas Cam
puses have much to offer, in
Austria as elsewhere. Let us
continue to capitalize on these
opportunities, tackle our prob
lems as they come, and work on
improvements as efficiently and
quickly as we can. Finally, I
hope we can expend more effort
working together on a fully in
formed basis and spend less
valuable time on unproductive
polemics.

sor Spitz to send me his sug
gestions for such a search.
Secondly, Stanford in Austria
has launched a new and inex
pensive bus run to Vienna each
Friday morning. Round trip will
be 80 cents, not the railway's
$4. It will leave early in the day,
return late—after the cultural
attractions have closed, and the
Heurigen have been reasonably

students need not return on the

Window To The East
Finally, I want to suggest that
being sixty miles from Vienna
does not automatically wipe out
the educational value of Stan
ford in Austria. Stanford stu
dents are just not that immobi
lized. One of the great values of
being in Austria has been ob
scured by all of the recent
hoopla over location, maid ser
vice, and "oppressive" dress
standards. Austria is and will
remain for many years the
West's "Window to the East"—a
phrase from Chancellor Klaus'
dedication address at the Cen
ter. The Campus is excellently
located for access to the East,
and all Stanford students going
to Austria will travel behind the
Iron Curtain, on official trips and
often on their own. If this be not
educational in the best sense,
then reports from the hundreds
of students overseas who have
made such trips are without
value. Here indeed is a rich
source of new insights and
broadened perspectives—and our
aim is liberal education.
Stanford in Austria offers a
valuable dimension in general
education whether it is at the
Semmering or near Vienna. Aus
trians abound sixty miles south
of Vienna, and they are not idiots
suitable only lor the observation
of quaint folkways or the prac
tice of elementary German, as
Professor Spitz suggests. TTiey

may come for a few days of
relaxation, they may live at the
Semmering, they may be found
in the nearby county seat of
Murzzuschlag or at Gloggnitz
ten minutes down the road. As
at the other European campuses,
they are not always the nation's
intellectuals, but with only a
little effort at getting acquainted
they will tell students what
they think about contemporary
problems, about the War and
the all-too-recent Russian occu
pation, and about what they
value most in their way of life.
And it will be in German. Just
a little effort is all it takes, even
as education on the Quad.
Overseas Subcommittee
In closing, I note that Pro
cessor Spitz calls for interest
by the faculty of Humanities
and Sciences. This we welcome,
as indeed we welcome construc
tive comments and suggestions
from students. To facilitate han
dling such suggestions, the
Committee on General Studies
recently created a Subcommit
tee on Overseas Campuses to
advise it on relevant matters.
The faculty members are Pro
fessors George Knoles (His
tory), John Loftis (English),
Lorie Tarshis (Economics), Da
vid Regnery (Biology), and F.
W. Strothmann (Modern Euro
pean Languages). The student
members are Martha Bell (Aus
tria I), Sheldon Shaeffer (Ger
many XIV), Steve Tipton (Italy
XI), and Bob Vestal (France
IX). The student members are
members also of the Overseas
Campuses Board, which is a
highly useful channel of stu
dent opinion and of assistance
in the orientation of new groups.
It is my sincere hope that we
can now get useful and construc
tive suggestions into proper
lines for serious consideration.
With such weighty matters as
coping with maid service, adapt
ing to European (not just Aus
tria) ideas about the American
use of electricity, and dressing
in a manner which does not of
fend European standards, we
shall continue to grapple in the
preparatory session. We have
our home-grown examples of the
American who rejects out of
hand the idea that he should
adapt to any foreing cultural dif
ferences (cf. Lederer and Bur
dick), but it is not a major
problem. Stanford students are,
one the whole, well liked in the
areas in which we have cam
puses and have done an excel
lent job of maintaining local
receptivity for those who will
follow them. The Overseas Cam
puses have much to offer, in
Austria as elsewhere. Let us
continue to capitalize on these
opportunities, tackle our prob
lems as they come, and work on
improvements as efficiently and
quickly as we can. Finally, I
hope we can expend more effort
working together on a fully in

Robert A, Walker
Director, Stanford
Overseas Campuses
Editor, The Daily:
May I express my apprecia
tion for the fine series of articles
on the Overseas Campuses in
the issue of Wednesday, Novem
ber 23. They do much to restore
balance to a discussion that
seemed to be getting rather
more frenetic than enlightening!
I have just returned from Eu
rope, where I visited our cam
puses and participated in a
highly rewarding conference
with all of the European Cam
pus Directors. The dedication of
our European staff to the inter
ests of Stanford students and
the University has once again
impressed me greatly. They care
a great deal about the success
of each of their campuses in
providing a valuable educational
opportunity for each student
who attends. At the same time
they all agree with one of the
central themes of last Wednes
day's articles — they can pro
vide the opportunity, but capital
izing upon it depends greatly
upon individual student initiative
and intelligent self-direction. To
improve and strengthen the op
portunities, in the light of the
many suggestions that have been
made, the Directors have unani
mously recommended a series of
changes in the academic pro
gram and in the übiquitous
"regs."
But that is a separate story to
be reported soon. My trip also
took me to Austria. There I
learned for the first time about
the letter from Professor Spitz
and Mark Edwards, President of
Austria 111, which had been
mailed to The Daily just three
days before my arrival at the
Panhans. I was a bit puzzled at
the obvious desire to make the
public prints in advance of any
possible discussion of the ques
tions involved. I was even more
puzzled when I learned that the
letters had been discussed with
neither Professor Koringer, Di
rector of Studies, nor Dr. Straub,
the Director of Administration.
Both of these men are life-long
residents of Vienna. Professor
Korninger is both Chairman of
the Department of English and,
this year, Dean of the Faculty
of Letters at the University of
Vienna. Dr. Straub has been
working with Americans in Aus
tria for over twenty years, form
erly with the American Embassy
and now with Stanford. They are
keenly interested in the suc
cess and best interests of Stan
ford's program in Austria, and
both were frankly rather
shocked that Professor Spitz
should have written so cate
gorical a denunciation of the
present location of Stanford in
Austria without any consulta
tion. I repeat, both men know
Vienna intimately and they know
the pros and cons of locating
there, as well as the difficulties
of finding a place. But avoiding
consultations is Professor Spitz's
privilege. The question is wheth
er or not he is right
Vienna Disadvantages
He might be. But the Directors
both expressed the opinion that
there are disadvantages to being
in Vienna that Professor Spitz
had ignored. Opera, theater, and
concerts would be more accessi
ble, it is true. So also would be
a host of non-cultural diversions
and other American students.
Austrian students do not gen
erally congregate around Uni
versity buildings for easy access
in the evenings. There Is no
campus life in the American
sense; students commute to lec
tures and disappear again into
the enormous sponge of a great
city. Meeting them would take
effort and organization, just as
it does now. More serious, how

ever, is the fact that it would be
easy to lose entirely one of the
major values of an overseas
campus—a real community of
students, faculty, and staff mem
bers living, eating, and talking
together to establish the per
sonal rapport so rarely found
on the Quad. Faculty and staff,
as well as students, would tend
more to disperse to private
pursuits after classes.
One of the more experienced
Stanford professors teaching
overseas has observed, in com
menting upon moving to Vienna,
that there is a great difference
between the great city and
smaller towns in the accessibility
of the people to oar students. In
tensive contact with nationals,
he suggests, varies inversely
with the size of the town and
the number of American tour
ists. This contact has been one
of the more valuable aspects of
Stanford overseas study, and
our experience to date supports
his observation.
It is not at all certain that
facilities in Vienna can be found
readily. The housing shortage is
severe. Rent controls based on
World War I index figures have
killed virtually all private con
struction in recent years. Gov
ernment housing is under full
control of the ruling political
parties with resulting complica
tions of party identification in
securing access to it. So tight is
the situation that the University
of Vienna has reportedly en
countered difficulty in recruiting
faculty from the provincial uni
versities because suitable hous
ing was not available. Be that as
it may, we have looked for fa
cilities in Vienna. When Mr.
Dwight Adams, the University
Business Manager, and I orig
inally explored the possibilities,
we located two in Vienna, one
in Baden (about 20 km. from
Vienna), one in the Tyrol, and
the Panhans Hotel. Both Vienna
locations were impossible, one
too small and one too ancient.
Baden was promising, but the
owners insisted on keeping the
central and best building of a
three-building complex for hotel
guests, with Stanford students
barred except for meals. The
Tyrol we rejected as too isolated.
Hence the Semmering.
Semmering Too Far?
Which leaves the question of
whether or not the Semmering
is too far from Vienna for any
good educational use. Perhaps,
but Professor Spitz's dramatic
arrival at certainty is a bit pre
mature. It is most difficult to
judge such a complex issue defi
nitely after only one year's
operating experience. Not all of
the professors who have taught
there agree with him, nor do all
of the students—as Carl Mundt
of Austria I made clear last
Wednesday. Being within street
car distance of downtown Vienna
might not make all that much
difference on weekday nights.
Studies still take time. I found
this true, for example, at the
Intercollegiate Center for Classi
cal Studies which is fifteen min
utes from the heart of Rome.
Students seldom go out on week

nights. Also, Dr. Straub finds
that if he gets nine tickets for a
performance of the Vienna Phil
harmonic, the Opera, or the
theater for Wednesday night,
then provides a free bus leaving
at five o'clock and returning
after the event (usually 12 or
1 a.m. at the Semmering), he
cannot find enough "takers"
among eighty students. If they
lived on the outskirts of Vienna
and took public transportation,
as proposed, they would have to
leave by six and wouldn't be
back until eleven or later. Hence
the excuse I heard at the Pan
hans that "it takes too much
time" is not entirely convincing.
But there is a problem of dis
tance, and what are we doing to
help deal with it? First, no one
is opposed to being nearer Vien
na if this should prove possible.
That was our original hope. I
have asked our Austrian Direc
tors to look into every cogent
possibility for new locations. In
fact, Dr. Straub had looked at
one a day or two before Dr.
Spitz sent his letter. It was much
too small. I have asked Profes
sor Spitz to send me his sug
gestions for such a search.
Secondly, Stanford in Austria
has launched a new and inex
pensive bus run to Vienna each
Friday morning. Round trip will
be 80 cents, not the railway's
$4. It will leave early in the day,
return late—after the cultural
attractions have closed, and the
Heurigen have been reasonably
sampled. This time and sched
ule were suggested by cabinet
officers of Austria 111. Obviously,
students need not return on the
bus. They can remain in Vienna
for the weekend or take off for
further travels as they wish.

Finally, I want to suggest that

the educational value of Stan
ford in Austria. Stanford stu
dents are just not that immobi

of finding a place. But avoiding
consultations is Professor Spitz's
privilege. The question is wheth
er or not he is right
Vienna Disadvantages
He might be. But the Directors
both expressed the opinion that
there are disadvantages to being
in Vienna that Professor Spitz
had ignored. Opera, theater, and
concerts would be more accessi
ble, it is true. So also would be
a host of non-cultural diversions
and other American students.
Austrian students do not gen
erally congregate around Uni
versity buildings for easy access
in the evenings. There Is no
campus life in the American
sense; students commute to lec
tures and disappear again into
the enormous sponge of a great
city. Meeting them would take
effort and organization, just as
it does now. More serious, how

ever, is the fact that it would be
easy to lose entirely one of the
major values of an overseas
campus—a real community of
students, faculty, and staff mem
bers living, eating, and talking
together to establish the per
sonal rapport so rarely found
on the Quad. Faculty and staff,
as well as students, would tend
more to disperse to private
pursuits after classes.
One of the more experienced
Stanford professors teaching
overseas has observed, in com
menting upon moving to Vienna,
that there is a great difference
between the great city and
smaller towns in the accessibility
of the people to oar students. In
tensive contact with nationals,
he suggests, varies inversely
with the size of the town and
the number of American tour
ists. This contact has been one
of the more valuable aspects of
Stanford overseas study, and
our experience to date supports
his observation.
It is not at all certain that
facilities in Vienna can be found
readily. The housing shortage is
severe. Rent controls based on
World War I index figures have
killed virtually all private con
struction in recent years. Gov
ernment housing is under full
control of the ruling political
parties with resulting complica
tions of party identification in
securing access to it. So tight is
the situation that the University
of Vienna has reportedly en
countered difficulty in recruiting
faculty from the provincial uni
versities because suitable hous
ing was not available. Be that as
it may, we have looked for fa
cilities in Vienna. When Mr.
Dwight Adams, the University
Business Manager, and I orig
inally explored the possibilities,
we located two in Vienna, one
in Baden (about 20 km. from
Vienna), one in the Tyrol, and
the Panhans Hotel. Both Vienna
locations were impossible, one
too small and one too ancient.
Baden was promising, but the
owners insisted on keeping the
central and best building of a
three-building complex for hotel
guests, with Stanford students
barred except for meals. The
Tyrol we rejected as too isolated.
Hence the Semmering.
Semmering Too Far?
Which leaves the question of
whether or not the Semmering
is too far from Vienna for any
good educational use. Perhaps,
but Professor Spitz's dramatic
arrival at certainty is a bit pre
mature. It is most difficult to
judge such a complex issue defi
nitely after only one year's
operating experience. Not all of
the professors who have taught
there agree with him, nor do all
of the students—as Carl Mundt
of Austria I made clear last
Wednesday. Being within street
car distance of downtown Vienna
might not make all that much
difference on weekday nights.
Studies still take time. I found
this true, for example, at the
Intercollegiate Center for Classi
cal Studies which is fifteen min
utes from the heart of Rome.
Students seldom go out on week

nights. Also, Dr. Straub finds
that if he gets nine tickets for a
performance of the Vienna Phil
harmonic, the Opera, or the
theater for Wednesday night,
then provides a free bus leaving
at five o'clock and returning
after the event (usually 12 or
1 a.m. at the Semmering), he
cannot find enough "takers"
among eighty students. If they
lived on the outskirts of Vienna
and took public transportation,
as proposed, they would have to
leave by six and wouldn't be
back until eleven or later. Hence
the excuse I heard at the Pan
hans that "it takes too much
time" is not entirely convincing.
But there is a problem of dis
tance, and what are we doing to
help deal with it? First, no one
is opposed to being nearer Vien
na if this should prove possible.
That was our original hope. I
have asked our Austrian Direc
tors to look into every cogent
possibility for new locations. In
fact, Dr. Straub had looked at
one a day or two before Dr.
Spitz sent his letter. It was much
too small. I have asked Profes
sor Spitz to send me his sug
gestions for such a search.
Secondly, Stanford in Austria
has launched a new and inex
pensive bus run to Vienna each
Friday morning. Round trip will
be 80 cents, not the railway's
$4. It will leave early in the day,
return late—after the cultural
attractions have closed, and the
Heurigen have been reasonably
sampled. This time and sched
ule were suggested by cabinet
officers of Austria 111. Obviously,
students need not return on the
bus. They can remain in Vienna
for the weekend or take off for
further travels as they wish.
Window To The East
Finally, I want to suggest that
being sixty miles from Vienna
does not automatically wipe out
the educational value of Stan
ford in Austria. Stanford stu
dents are just not that immobi
lized. One of the great values of
being in Austria has been ob
scured by all of the recent
hoopla over location, maid ser
vice, and "oppressive" dress
standards. Austria is and will
remain for many years the
West's "Window to the East"—a
phrase from Chancellor Klaus'
dedication address at the Cen
ter. The Campus is excellently
located for access to the East,
and all Stanford students going
to Austria will travel behind the
Iron Curtain, on official trips and
often on their own. If this be not
educational in the best sense,
then reports from the hundreds
of students overseas who have
made such trips are without
value. Here indeed is a rich
source of new insights and
broadened perspectives—and our
aim is liberal education.
Stanford in Austria offers a
valuable dimension in general
education whether it is at the
Semmering or near Vienna. Aus
trians abound sixty miles south
of Vienna, and they are not idiots
suitable only lor the observation
of quaint folkways or the prac
tice of elementary German, as
Professor Spitz suggests. TTiey

may come for a few days of
relaxation, they may live at the
Semmering, they may be found
in the nearby county seat of
Murzzuschlag or at Gloggnitz
ten minutes down the road. As
at the other European campuses,
they are not always the nation's
intellectuals, but with only a
little effort at getting acquainted
they will tell students what
they think about contemporary
problems, about the War and
the all-too-recent Russian occu
pation, and about what they
value most in their way of life.
And it will be in German. Just
a little effort is all it takes, even
as education on the Quad.
Overseas Subcommittee
In closing, I note that Pro
cessor Spitz calls for interest
by the faculty of Humanities
and Sciences. This we welcome,
as indeed we welcome construc
tive comments and suggestions
from students. To facilitate han
dling such suggestions, the
Committee on General Studies
recently created a Subcommit
tee on Overseas Campuses to
advise it on relevant matters.
The faculty members are Pro
fessors George Knoles (His
tory), John Loftis (English),
Lorie Tarshis (Economics), Da
vid Regnery (Biology), and F.
W. Strothmann (Modern Euro
pean Languages). The student
members are Martha Bell (Aus
tria I), Sheldon Shaeffer (Ger
many XIV), Steve Tipton (Italy
XI), and Bob Vestal (France
IX). The student members are
members also of the Overseas
Campuses Board, which is a
highly useful channel of stu
dent opinion and of assistance
in the orientation of new groups.
It is my sincere hope that we
can now get useful and construc
tive suggestions into proper
lines for serious consideration.
With such weighty matters as
coping with maid service, adapt
ing to European (not just Aus
tria) ideas about the American
use of electricity, and dressing
in a manner which does not of
fend European standards, we
shall continue to grapple in the
preparatory session. We have
our home-grown examples of the
American who rejects out of
hand the idea that he should
adapt to any foreing cultural dif
ferences (cf. Lederer and Bur
dick), but it is not a major
problem. Stanford students are,
one the whole, well liked in the
areas in which we have cam
puses and have done an excel
lent job of maintaining local
receptivity for those who will
follow them. The Overseas Cam
puses have much to offer, in
Austria as elsewhere. Let us
continue to capitalize on these
opportunities, tackle our prob
lems as they come, and work on
improvements as efficiently and
quickly as we can. Finally, I
hope we can expend more effort
working together on a fully in
formed basis and spend less
valuable time on unproductive
polemics.
Robert A, Walker
Director, Stanford
Overseas Campuses
Editor, The Daily:
May I express my apprecia
tion for the fine series of articles
on the Overseas Campuses in
the issue of Wednesday, Novem
ber 23. They do much to restore
balance to a discussion that
seemed to be getting rather
more frenetic than enlightening!
I have just returned from Eu
rope, where I visited our cam
puses and participated in a
highly rewarding conference
with all of the European Cam
pus Directors. The dedication of
our European staff to the inter
ests of Stanford students and
the University has once again
impressed me greatly. They care
a great deal about the success
of each of their campuses in
providing a valuable educational
opportunity for each student
who attends. At the same time
they all agree with one of the
central themes of last Wednes
day's articles — they can pro
vide the opportunity, but capital
izing upon it depends greatly
upon individual student initiative
and intelligent self-direction. To
improve and strengthen the op
portunities, in the light of the
many suggestions that have been
made, the Directors have unani
mously recommended a series of
changes in the academic pro
gram and in the übiquitous
"regs."
But that is a separate story to
be reported soon. My trip also
took me to Austria. There I
learned for the first time about
the letter from Professor Spitz
and Mark Edwards, President of
Austria 111, which had been
mailed to The Daily just three
days before my arrival at the
Panhans. I was a bit puzzled at
the obvious desire to make the
public prints in advance of any
possible discussion of the ques
tions involved. I was even more
puzzled when I learned that the
letters had been discussed with
neither Professor Koringer, Di
rector of Studies, nor Dr. Straub,
the Director of Administration.
Both of these men are life-long
residents of Vienna. Professor
Korninger is both Chairman of
the Department of English and,
this year, Dean of the Faculty
of Letters at the University of
Vienna. Dr. Straub has been
working with Americans in Aus
tria for over twenty years, form
erly with the American Embassy
and now with Stanford. They are
keenly interested in the suc
cess and best interests of Stan
ford's program in Austria, and
both were frankly rather
shocked that Professor Spitz
should have written so cate
gorical a denunciation of the
present location of Stanford in
Austria without any consulta
tion. I repeat, both men know
Vienna intimately and they know
the pros and cons of locating
there, as well as the difficulties
of finding a place. But avoiding
consultations is Professor Spitz's
privilege. The question is wheth
er or not he is right
Vienna Disadvantages
He might be. But the Directors
both expressed the opinion that
there are disadvantages to being
in Vienna that Professor Spitz
had ignored. Opera, theater, and
concerts would be more accessi

a host of non-cultural diversions
and other American students.

In closing, I note that Pro
cessor Spitz calls for interest
by the faculty of Humanities
and Sciences. This we welcome,
as indeed we welcome construc
tive comments and suggestions
from students. To facilitate han
dling such suggestions, the
Committee on General Studies
recently created a Subcommit
tee on Overseas Campuses to
advise it on relevant matters.
The faculty members are Pro
fessors George Knoles (His
tory), John Loftis (English),
Lorie Tarshis (Economics), Da
vid Regnery (Biology), and F.
W. Strothmann (Modern Euro
pean Languages). The student
members are Martha Bell (Aus
tria I), Sheldon Shaeffer (Ger
many XIV), Steve Tipton (Italy
XI), and Bob Vestal (France
IX). The student members are
members also of the Overseas
Campuses Board, which is a
highly useful channel of stu
dent opinion and of assistance
in the orientation of new groups.
It is my sincere hope that we
can now get useful and construc
tive suggestions into proper
lines for serious consideration.
With such weighty matters as
coping with maid service, adapt
ing to European (not just Aus
tria) ideas about the American
use of electricity, and dressing
in a manner which does not of
fend European standards, we
shall continue to grapple in the
preparatory session. We have
our home-grown examples of the
American who rejects out of
hand the idea that he should
adapt to any foreing cultural dif
ferences (cf. Lederer and Bur
dick), but it is not a major
problem. Stanford students are,
one the whole, well liked in the
areas in which we have cam
puses and have done an excel
lent job of maintaining local
receptivity for those who will
follow them. The Overseas Cam
puses have much to offer, in
Austria as elsewhere. Let us
continue to capitalize on these
opportunities, tackle our prob
lems as they come, and work on
improvements as efficiently and
quickly as we can. Finally, I
hope we can expend more effort
working together on a fully in
formed basis and spend less
valuable time on unproductive
polemics.
Robert A, Walker
Director, Stanford
Overseas Campuses
Editor, The Daily:
May I express my apprecia
tion for the fine series of articles
on the Overseas Campuses in
the issue of Wednesday, Novem
ber 23. They do much to restore
balance to a discussion that
seemed to be getting rather
more frenetic than enlightening!
I have just returned from Eu
rope, where I visited our cam
puses and participated in a
highly rewarding conference
with all of the European Cam
pus Directors. The dedication of
our European staff to the inter
ests of Stanford students and
the University has once again
impressed me greatly. They care
a great deal about the success
of each of their campuses in
providing a valuable educational
opportunity for each student
who attends. At the same time
they all agree with one of the
central themes of last Wednes
day's articles — they can pro
vide the opportunity, but capital
izing upon it depends greatly
upon individual student initiative
and intelligent self-direction. To
improve and strengthen the op
portunities, in the light of the
many suggestions that have been
made, the Directors have unani
mously recommended a series of
changes in the academic pro
gram and in the übiquitous
"regs."
But that is a separate story to
be reported soon. My trip also
took me to Austria. There I
learned for the first time about
the letter from Professor Spitz
and Mark Edwards, President of
Austria 111, which had been
mailed to The Daily just three
days before my arrival at the
Panhans. I was a bit puzzled at
the obvious desire to make the
public prints in advance of any
possible discussion of the ques
tions involved. I was even more
puzzled when I learned that the
letters had been discussed with
neither Professor Koringer, Di
rector of Studies, nor Dr. Straub,
the Director of Administration.
Both of these men are life-long
residents of Vienna. Professor
Korninger is both Chairman of
the Department of English and,
this year, Dean of the Faculty
of Letters at the University of
Vienna. Dr. Straub has been
working with Americans in Aus
tria for over twenty years, form
erly with the American Embassy
and now with Stanford. They are
keenly interested in the suc
cess and best interests of Stan
ford's program in Austria, and
both were frankly rather
shocked that Professor Spitz
should have written so cate
gorical a denunciation of the
present location of Stanford in
Austria without any consulta
tion. I repeat, both men know
Vienna intimately and they know
the pros and cons of locating
there, as well as the difficulties
of finding a place. But avoiding
consultations is Professor Spitz's
privilege. The question is wheth
er or not he is right
Vienna Disadvantages
He might be. But the Directors
both expressed the opinion that
there are disadvantages to being
in Vienna that Professor Spitz
had ignored. Opera, theater, and
concerts would be more accessi
ble, it is true. So also would be
a host of non-cultural diversions
and other American students.
Austrian students do not gen
erally congregate around Uni
versity buildings for easy access
in the evenings. There Is no
campus life in the American
sense; students commute to lec
tures and disappear again into
the enormous sponge of a great
city. Meeting them would take
effort and organization, just as
it does now. More serious, how

ever, is the fact that it would be
easy to lose entirely one of the
major values of an overseas
campus—a real community of
students, faculty, and staff mem
bers living, eating, and talking
together to establish the per
sonal rapport so rarely found
on the Quad. Faculty and staff,
as well as students, would tend
more to disperse to private
pursuits after classes.
One of the more experienced
Stanford professors teaching
overseas has observed, in com
menting upon moving to Vienna,
that there is a great difference
between the great city and
smaller towns in the accessibility
of the people to oar students. In
tensive contact with nationals,
he suggests, varies inversely
with the size of the town and
the number of American tour
ists. This contact has been one
of the more valuable aspects of
Stanford overseas study, and
our experience to date supports
his observation.
It is not at all certain that
facilities in Vienna can be found
readily. The housing shortage is
severe. Rent controls based on
World War I index figures have
killed virtually all private con
struction in recent years. Gov
ernment housing is under full
control of the ruling political
parties with resulting complica
tions of party identification in
securing access to it. So tight is
the situation that the University
of Vienna has reportedly en
countered difficulty in recruiting
faculty from the provincial uni
versities because suitable hous
ing was not available. Be that as
it may, we have looked for fa
cilities in Vienna. When Mr.
Dwight Adams, the University
Business Manager, and I orig
inally explored the possibilities,
we located two in Vienna, one
in Baden (about 20 km. from
Vienna), one in the Tyrol, and
the Panhans Hotel. Both Vienna
locations were impossible, one
too small and one too ancient.
Baden was promising, but the
owners insisted on keeping the
central and best building of a
three-building complex for hotel
guests, with Stanford students
barred except for meals. The
Tyrol we rejected as too isolated.
Hence the Semmering.
Semmering Too Far?
Which leaves the question of
whether or not the Semmering
is too far from Vienna for any
good educational use. Perhaps,
but Professor Spitz's dramatic
arrival at certainty is a bit pre
mature. It is most difficult to
judge such a complex issue defi
nitely after only one year's
operating experience. Not all of
the professors who have taught
there agree with him, nor do all
of the students—as Carl Mundt
of Austria I made clear last
Wednesday. Being within street
car distance of downtown Vienna
might not make all that much
difference on weekday nights.
Studies still take time. I found
this true, for example, at the
Intercollegiate Center for Classi
cal Studies which is fifteen min
utes from the heart of Rome.
Students seldom go out on week

nights. Also, Dr. Straub finds
that if he gets nine tickets for a
performance of the Vienna Phil
harmonic, the Opera, or the
theater for Wednesday night,
then provides a free bus leaving
at five o'clock and returning
after the event (usually 12 or
1 a.m. at the Semmering), he
cannot find enough "takers"
among eighty students. If they
lived on the outskirts of Vienna
and took public transportation,
as proposed, they would have to
leave by six and wouldn't be
back until eleven or later. Hence
the excuse I heard at the Pan
hans that "it takes too much
time" is not entirely convincing.
But there is a problem of dis
tance, and what are we doing to
help deal with it? First, no one
is opposed to being nearer Vien
na if this should prove possible.
That was our original hope. I
have asked our Austrian Direc
tors to look into every cogent
possibility for new locations. In
fact, Dr. Straub had looked at
one a day or two before Dr.
Spitz sent his letter. It was much
too small. I have asked Profes
sor Spitz to send me his sug
gestions for such a search.
Secondly, Stanford in Austria
has launched a new and inex
pensive bus run to Vienna each
Friday morning. Round trip will
be 80 cents, not the railway's
$4. It will leave early in the day,
return late—after the cultural
attractions have closed, and the
Heurigen have been reasonably
sampled. This time and sched
ule were suggested by cabinet
officers of Austria 111. Obviously,
students need not return on the
bus. They can remain in Vienna
for the weekend or take off for
further travels as they wish.
Window To The East
Finally, I want to suggest that
being sixty miles from Vienna
does not automatically wipe out
the educational value of Stan
ford in Austria. Stanford stu
dents are just not that immobi
lized. One of the great values of
being in Austria has been ob
scured by all of the recent
hoopla over location, maid ser
vice, and "oppressive" dress
standards. Austria is and will
remain for many years the
West's "Window to the East"—a
phrase from Chancellor Klaus'
dedication address at the Cen
ter. The Campus is excellently
located for access to the East,
and all Stanford students going
to Austria will travel behind the
Iron Curtain, on official trips and
often on their own. If this be not
educational in the best sense,
then reports from the hundreds
of students overseas who have
made such trips are without
value. Here indeed is a rich
source of new insights and
broadened perspectives—and our
aim is liberal education.
Stanford in Austria offers a
valuable dimension in general
education whether it is at the
Semmering or near Vienna. Aus
trians abound sixty miles south
of Vienna, and they are not idiots
suitable only lor the observation
of quaint folkways or the prac
tice of elementary German, as
Professor Spitz suggests. TTiey

may come for a few days of
relaxation, they may live at the
Semmering, they may be found
in the nearby county seat of
Murzzuschlag or at Gloggnitz
ten minutes down the road. As
at the other European campuses,
they are not always the nation's
intellectuals, but with only a
little effort at getting acquainted
they will tell students what
they think about contemporary
problems, about the War and
the all-too-recent Russian occu
pation, and about what they
value most in their way of life.
And it will be in German. Just
a little effort is all it takes, even
as education on the Quad.

cessor Spitz calls for interest

Baden was promising, but the
owners insisted on keeping the
central and best building of a
three-building complex for hotel
guests, with Stanford students
barred except for meals. The
Tyrol we rejected as too isolated.
Hence the Semmering.
Semmering Too Far?
Which leaves the question of
whether or not the Semmering
is too far from Vienna for any
good educational use. Perhaps,
but Professor Spitz's dramatic
arrival at certainty is a bit pre
mature. It is most difficult to
judge such a complex issue defi
nitely after only one year's
operating experience. Not all of
the professors who have taught
there agree with him, nor do all
of the students—as Carl Mundt
of Austria I made clear last
Wednesday. Being within street
car distance of downtown Vienna
might not make all that much
difference on weekday nights.
Studies still take time. I found
this true, for example, at the
Intercollegiate Center for Classi
cal Studies which is fifteen min
utes from the heart of Rome.
Students seldom go out on week

nights. Also, Dr. Straub finds
that if he gets nine tickets for a
performance of the Vienna Phil
harmonic, the Opera, or the
theater for Wednesday night,
then provides a free bus leaving
at five o'clock and returning
after the event (usually 12 or
1 a.m. at the Semmering), he
cannot find enough "takers"
among eighty students. If they
lived on the outskirts of Vienna
and took public transportation,
as proposed, they would have to
leave by six and wouldn't be
back until eleven or later. Hence
the excuse I heard at the Pan
hans that "it takes too much
time" is not entirely convincing.
But there is a problem of dis
tance, and what are we doing to
help deal with it? First, no one
is opposed to being nearer Vien
na if this should prove possible.
That was our original hope. I
have asked our Austrian Direc
tors to look into every cogent
possibility for new locations. In
fact, Dr. Straub had looked at
one a day or two before Dr.
Spitz sent his letter. It was much
too small. I have asked Profes
sor Spitz to send me his sug
gestions for such a search.
Secondly, Stanford in Austria
has launched a new and inex
pensive bus run to Vienna each
Friday morning. Round trip will
be 80 cents, not the railway's
$4. It will leave early in the day,
return late—after the cultural
attractions have closed, and the
Heurigen have been reasonably
sampled. This time and sched
ule were suggested by cabinet
officers of Austria 111. Obviously,
students need not return on the
bus. They can remain in Vienna
for the weekend or take off for
further travels as they wish.
Window To The East
Finally, I want to suggest that
being sixty miles from Vienna
does not automatically wipe out
the educational value of Stan
ford in Austria. Stanford stu
dents are just not that immobi
lized. One of the great values of
being in Austria has been ob
scured by all of the recent
hoopla over location, maid ser
vice, and "oppressive" dress
standards. Austria is and will
remain for many years the
West's "Window to the East"—a
phrase from Chancellor Klaus'
dedication address at the Cen
ter. The Campus is excellently
located for access to the East,
and all Stanford students going
to Austria will travel behind the
Iron Curtain, on official trips and
often on their own. If this be not
educational in the best sense,
then reports from the hundreds
of students overseas who have
made such trips are without
value. Here indeed is a rich
source of new insights and
broadened perspectives—and our
aim is liberal education.
Stanford in Austria offers a
valuable dimension in general
education whether it is at the
Semmering or near Vienna. Aus
trians abound sixty miles south
of Vienna, and they are not idiots
suitable only lor the observation
of quaint folkways or the prac
tice of elementary German, as
Professor Spitz suggests. TTiey

may come for a few days of
relaxation, they may live at the
Semmering, they may be found
in the nearby county seat of
Murzzuschlag or at Gloggnitz
ten minutes down the road. As
at the other European campuses,
they are not always the nation's
intellectuals, but with only a
little effort at getting acquainted
they will tell students what
they think about contemporary
problems, about the War and
the all-too-recent Russian occu
pation, and about what they
value most in their way of life.
And it will be in German. Just
a little effort is all it takes, even
as education on the Quad.
Overseas Subcommittee
In closing, I note that Pro
cessor Spitz calls for interest
by the faculty of Humanities
and Sciences. This we welcome,
as indeed we welcome construc
tive comments and suggestions
from students. To facilitate han
dling such suggestions, the
Committee on General Studies
recently created a Subcommit
tee on Overseas Campuses to
advise it on relevant matters.
The faculty members are Pro
fessors George Knoles (His
tory), John Loftis (English),
Lorie Tarshis (Economics), Da
vid Regnery (Biology), and F.
W. Strothmann (Modern Euro
pean Languages). The student
members are Martha Bell (Aus
tria I), Sheldon Shaeffer (Ger
many XIV), Steve Tipton (Italy
XI), and Bob Vestal (France
IX). The student members are
members also of the Overseas
Campuses Board, which is a
highly useful channel of stu
dent opinion and of assistance
in the orientation of new groups.
It is my sincere hope that we
can now get useful and construc
tive suggestions into proper
lines for serious consideration.
With such weighty matters as
coping with maid service, adapt
ing to European (not just Aus
tria) ideas about the American
use of electricity, and dressing
in a manner which does not of
fend European standards, we
shall continue to grapple in the
preparatory session. We have
our home-grown examples of the
American who rejects out of
hand the idea that he should
adapt to any foreing cultural dif
ferences (cf. Lederer and Bur
dick), but it is not a major
problem. Stanford students are,
one the whole, well liked in the
areas in which we have cam
puses and have done an excel
lent job of maintaining local
receptivity for those who will
follow them. The Overseas Cam
puses have much to offer, in
Austria as elsewhere. Let us
continue to capitalize on these
opportunities, tackle our prob
lems as they come, and work on
improvements as efficiently and
quickly as we can. Finally, I
hope we can expend more effort
working together on a fully in
formed basis and spend less
valuable time on unproductive
polemics.
Robert A, Walker
Director, Stanford
Overseas Campuses
Editor, The Daily:
May I express my apprecia
tion for the fine series of articles
on the Overseas Campuses in
the issue of Wednesday, Novem
ber 23. They do much to restore
balance to a discussion that
seemed to be getting rather
more frenetic than enlightening!
I have just returned from Eu
rope, where I visited our cam
puses and participated in a
highly rewarding conference
with all of the European Cam
pus Directors. The dedication of
our European staff to the inter
ests of Stanford students and
the University has once again
impressed me greatly. They care
a great deal about the success
of each of their campuses in
providing a valuable educational
opportunity for each student
who attends. At the same time
they all agree with one of the
central themes of last Wednes
day's articles — they can pro
vide the opportunity, but capital
izing upon it depends greatly
upon individual student initiative
and intelligent self-direction. To
improve and strengthen the op
portunities, in the light of the
many suggestions that have been
made, the Directors have unani
mously recommended a series of
changes in the academic pro
gram and in the übiquitous
"regs."
But that is a separate story to
be reported soon. My trip also
took me to Austria. There I
learned for the first time about
the letter from Professor Spitz
and Mark Edwards, President of
Austria 111, which had been
mailed to The Daily just three
days before my arrival at the
Panhans. I was a bit puzzled at
the obvious desire to make the
public prints in advance of any
possible discussion of the ques
tions involved. I was even more
puzzled when I learned that the
letters had been discussed with
neither Professor Koringer, Di
rector of Studies, nor Dr. Straub,
the Director of Administration.
Both of these men are life-long
residents of Vienna. Professor
Korninger is both Chairman of
the Department of English and,
this year, Dean of the Faculty
of Letters at the University of
Vienna. Dr. Straub has been
working with Americans in Aus
tria for over twenty years, form
erly with the American Embassy
and now with Stanford. They are
keenly interested in the suc
cess and best interests of Stan
ford's program in Austria, and
both were frankly rather
shocked that Professor Spitz
should have written so cate
gorical a denunciation of the
present location of Stanford in
Austria without any consulta
tion. I repeat, both men know
Vienna intimately and they know
the pros and cons of locating
there, as well as the difficulties
of finding a place. But avoiding
consultations is Professor Spitz's
privilege. The question is wheth
er or not he is right
Vienna Disadvantages
He might be. But the Directors
both expressed the opinion that
there are disadvantages to being
in Vienna that Professor Spitz
had ignored. Opera, theater, and
concerts would be more accessi
ble, it is true. So also would be
a host of non-cultural diversions
and other American students.
Austrian students do not gen
erally congregate around Uni
versity buildings for easy access
in the evenings. There Is no
campus life in the American
sense; students commute to lec
tures and disappear again into
the enormous sponge of a great
city. Meeting them would take
effort and organization, just as
it does now. More serious, how

ever, is the fact that it would be
easy to lose entirely one of the
major values of an overseas
campus—a real community of
students, faculty, and staff mem
bers living, eating, and talking
together to establish the per
sonal rapport so rarely found
on the Quad. Faculty and staff,
as well as students, would tend
more to disperse to private
pursuits after classes.
One of the more experienced
Stanford professors teaching
overseas has observed, in com
menting upon moving to Vienna,
that there is a great difference
between the great city and
smaller towns in the accessibility
of the people to oar students. In
tensive contact with nationals,
he suggests, varies inversely
with the size of the town and
the number of American tour
ists. This contact has been one
of the more valuable aspects of
Stanford overseas study, and
our experience to date supports
his observation.
It is not at all certain that
facilities in Vienna can be found
readily. The housing shortage is
severe. Rent controls based on
World War I index figures have
killed virtually all private con
struction in recent years. Gov
ernment housing is under full
control of the ruling political
parties with resulting complica
tions of party identification in
securing access to it. So tight is
the situation that the University
of Vienna has reportedly en
countered difficulty in recruiting
faculty from the provincial uni
versities because suitable hous
ing was not available. Be that as
it may, we have looked for fa
cilities in Vienna. When Mr.
Dwight Adams, the University
Business Manager, and I orig
inally explored the possibilities,
we located two in Vienna, one
in Baden (about 20 km. from
Vienna), one in the Tyrol, and
the Panhans Hotel. Both Vienna
locations were impossible, one
too small and one too ancient.
Baden was promising, but the
owners insisted on keeping the
central and best building of a
three-building complex for hotel
guests, with Stanford students
barred except for meals. The
Tyrol we rejected as too isolated.
Hence the Semmering.
Semmering Too Far?
Which leaves the question of

with all of the European Cam
pus Directors. The dedication of
our European staff to the inter
ests of Stanford students and
the University has once again
impressed me greatly. They care
a great deal about the success
of each of their campuses in
providing a valuable educational
opportunity for each student
who attends. At the same time
they all agree with one of the
central themes of last Wednes
day's articles — they can pro
vide the opportunity, but capital
izing upon it depends greatly
upon individual student initiative
and intelligent self-direction. To
improve and strengthen the op
portunities, in the light of the
many suggestions that have been
made, the Directors have unani
mously recommended a series of
changes in the academic pro
gram and in the übiquitous
"regs."
But that is a separate story to
be reported soon. My trip also
took me to Austria. There I
learned for the first time about
the letter from Professor Spitz
and Mark Edwards, President of
Austria 111, which had been
mailed to The Daily just three
days before my arrival at the
Panhans. I was a bit puzzled at
the obvious desire to make the
public prints in advance of any
possible discussion of the ques
tions involved. I was even more
puzzled when I learned that the
letters had been discussed with
neither Professor Koringer, Di
rector of Studies, nor Dr. Straub,
the Director of Administration.
Both of these men are life-long
residents of Vienna. Professor
Korninger is both Chairman of
the Department of English and,
this year, Dean of the Faculty
of Letters at the University of
Vienna. Dr. Straub has been
working with Americans in Aus
tria for over twenty years, form
erly with the American Embassy
and now with Stanford. They are
keenly interested in the suc
cess and best interests of Stan
ford's program in Austria, and
both were frankly rather
shocked that Professor Spitz
should have written so cate
gorical a denunciation of the
present location of Stanford in
Austria without any consulta
tion. I repeat, both men know
Vienna intimately and they know
the pros and cons of locating
there, as well as the difficulties
of finding a place. But avoiding
consultations is Professor Spitz's
privilege. The question is wheth
er or not he is right
Vienna Disadvantages
He might be. But the Directors
both expressed the opinion that
there are disadvantages to being
in Vienna that Professor Spitz
had ignored. Opera, theater, and
concerts would be more accessi
ble, it is true. So also would be
a host of non-cultural diversions
and other American students.
Austrian students do not gen
erally congregate around Uni
versity buildings for easy access
in the evenings. There Is no
campus life in the American
sense; students commute to lec
tures and disappear again into
the enormous sponge of a great
city. Meeting them would take
effort and organization, just as
it does now. More serious, how

ever, is the fact that it would be
easy to lose entirely one of the
major values of an overseas
campus—a real community of
students, faculty, and staff mem
bers living, eating, and talking
together to establish the per
sonal rapport so rarely found
on the Quad. Faculty and staff,
as well as students, would tend
more to disperse to private
pursuits after classes.
One of the more experienced
Stanford professors teaching
overseas has observed, in com
menting upon moving to Vienna,
that there is a great difference
between the great city and
smaller towns in the accessibility
of the people to oar students. In
tensive contact with nationals,
he suggests, varies inversely
with the size of the town and
the number of American tour
ists. This contact has been one
of the more valuable aspects of
Stanford overseas study, and
our experience to date supports
his observation.
It is not at all certain that
facilities in Vienna can be found
readily. The housing shortage is
severe. Rent controls based on
World War I index figures have
killed virtually all private con
struction in recent years. Gov
ernment housing is under full
control of the ruling political
parties with resulting complica
tions of party identification in
securing access to it. So tight is
the situation that the University
of Vienna has reportedly en
countered difficulty in recruiting
faculty from the provincial uni
versities because suitable hous
ing was not available. Be that as
it may, we have looked for fa
cilities in Vienna. When Mr.
Dwight Adams, the University
Business Manager, and I orig
inally explored the possibilities,
we located two in Vienna, one
in Baden (about 20 km. from
Vienna), one in the Tyrol, and
the Panhans Hotel. Both Vienna
locations were impossible, one
too small and one too ancient.
Baden was promising, but the
owners insisted on keeping the
central and best building of a
three-building complex for hotel
guests, with Stanford students
barred except for meals. The
Tyrol we rejected as too isolated.
Hence the Semmering.
Semmering Too Far?
Which leaves the question of
whether or not the Semmering
is too far from Vienna for any
good educational use. Perhaps,
but Professor Spitz's dramatic
arrival at certainty is a bit pre
mature. It is most difficult to
judge such a complex issue defi
nitely after only one year's
operating experience. Not all of
the professors who have taught
there agree with him, nor do all
of the students—as Carl Mundt
of Austria I made clear last
Wednesday. Being within street
car distance of downtown Vienna
might not make all that much
difference on weekday nights.
Studies still take time. I found
this true, for example, at the
Intercollegiate Center for Classi
cal Studies which is fifteen min
utes from the heart of Rome.
Students seldom go out on week

nights. Also, Dr. Straub finds
that if he gets nine tickets for a
performance of the Vienna Phil
harmonic, the Opera, or the
theater for Wednesday night,
then provides a free bus leaving
at five o'clock and returning
after the event (usually 12 or
1 a.m. at the Semmering), he
cannot find enough "takers"
among eighty students. If they
lived on the outskirts of Vienna
and took public transportation,
as proposed, they would have to
leave by six and wouldn't be
back until eleven or later. Hence
the excuse I heard at the Pan
hans that "it takes too much
time" is not entirely convincing.
But there is a problem of dis
tance, and what are we doing to
help deal with it? First, no one
is opposed to being nearer Vien
na if this should prove possible.
That was our original hope. I
have asked our Austrian Direc
tors to look into every cogent
possibility for new locations. In
fact, Dr. Straub had looked at
one a day or two before Dr.
Spitz sent his letter. It was much
too small. I have asked Profes
sor Spitz to send me his sug
gestions for such a search.
Secondly, Stanford in Austria
has launched a new and inex
pensive bus run to Vienna each
Friday morning. Round trip will
be 80 cents, not the railway's
$4. It will leave early in the day,
return late—after the cultural
attractions have closed, and the
Heurigen have been reasonably
sampled. This time and sched
ule were suggested by cabinet
officers of Austria 111. Obviously,
students need not return on the
bus. They can remain in Vienna
for the weekend or take off for
further travels as they wish.
Window To The East
Finally, I want to suggest that
being sixty miles from Vienna
does not automatically wipe out
the educational value of Stan
ford in Austria. Stanford stu
dents are just not that immobi
lized. One of the great values of
being in Austria has been ob
scured by all of the recent
hoopla over location, maid ser
vice, and "oppressive" dress
standards. Austria is and will
remain for many years the
West's "Window to the East"—a
phrase from Chancellor Klaus'
dedication address at the Cen
ter. The Campus is excellently
located for access to the East,
and all Stanford students going
to Austria will travel behind the
Iron Curtain, on official trips and
often on their own. If this be not
educational in the best sense,
then reports from the hundreds
of students overseas who have
made such trips are without
value. Here indeed is a rich
source of new insights and
broadened perspectives—and our
aim is liberal education.
Stanford in Austria offers a
valuable dimension in general
education whether it is at the
Semmering or near Vienna. Aus
trians abound sixty miles south
of Vienna, and they are not idiots
suitable only lor the observation
of quaint folkways or the prac
tice of elementary German, as
Professor Spitz suggests. TTiey

may come for a few days of
relaxation, they may live at the
Semmering, they may be found
in the nearby county seat of
Murzzuschlag or at Gloggnitz
ten minutes down the road. As
at the other European campuses,
they are not always the nation's
intellectuals, but with only a
little effort at getting acquainted
they will tell students what
they think about contemporary
problems, about the War and
the all-too-recent Russian occu
pation, and about what they
value most in their way of life.
And it will be in German. Just
a little effort is all it takes, even
as education on the Quad.
Overseas Subcommittee
In closing, I note that Pro
cessor Spitz calls for interest
by the faculty of Humanities
and Sciences. This we welcome,
as indeed we welcome construc
tive comments and suggestions
from students. To facilitate han
dling such suggestions, the
Committee on General Studies
recently created a Subcommit
tee on Overseas Campuses to
advise it on relevant matters.
The faculty members are Pro
fessors George Knoles (His
tory), John Loftis (English),
Lorie Tarshis (Economics), Da
vid Regnery (Biology), and F.
W. Strothmann (Modern Euro
pean Languages). The student
members are Martha Bell (Aus
tria I), Sheldon Shaeffer (Ger
many XIV), Steve Tipton (Italy
XI), and Bob Vestal (France
IX). The student members are
members also of the Overseas
Campuses Board, which is a
highly useful channel of stu
dent opinion and of assistance
in the orientation of new groups.
It is my sincere hope that we
can now get useful and construc
tive suggestions into proper
lines for serious consideration.
With such weighty matters as
coping with maid service, adapt
ing to European (not just Aus
tria) ideas about the American
use of electricity, and dressing
in a manner which does not of
fend European standards, we
shall continue to grapple in the
preparatory session. We have
our home-grown examples of the
American who rejects out of
hand the idea that he should
adapt to any foreing cultural dif
ferences (cf. Lederer and Bur
dick), but it is not a major
problem. Stanford students are,
one the whole, well liked in the
areas in which we have cam
puses and have done an excel
lent job of maintaining local
receptivity for those who will
follow them. The Overseas Cam
puses have much to offer, in
Austria as elsewhere. Let us
continue to capitalize on these
opportunities, tackle our prob
lems as they come, and work on
improvements as efficiently and
quickly as we can. Finally, I
hope we can expend more effort
working together on a fully in
formed basis and spend less
valuable time on unproductive
polemics.

Overseas Campuses
Editor, The Daily:
May I express my apprecia
tion for the fine series of articles
on the Overseas Campuses in
the issue of Wednesday, Novem
ber 23. They do much to restore
balance to a discussion that
seemed to be getting rather
more frenetic than enlightening!
I have just returned from Eu
