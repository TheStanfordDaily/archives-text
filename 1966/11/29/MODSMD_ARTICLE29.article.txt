# Gruber Speaks
## Memories Of A Lost Past: Golden Days Of The RBR 
### Steve Gruber 
President Tarnished put down
his pipe and turned to his ad
ministrative assistant, Fred Pup
pet.
"I guess we blew it this time,
Fred"
"Yeah, Boss."
"Right when we had the stu
dents where we wanted them,

those idiots at the library had to
go build a library that's com
fortable."
"We was duped, Boss."
"So we were. Doublecrossed
too."
"I tell you Boss, when War
necke came to me with the plans,
he promised me it would be
another Tresidder."
'What A Building'
President Tarnished's face lit
up at the mention of Tresidder.
"What a building," he said, now
smiling, "You can't eat in it,
you can't sleep in it, you can't
study in it. What a building.' '
"Yeah Boss, but Warnecke
done wrong when he planned
that library."
Tarnished was suddenly seri
ous. "It's terrible, Puppet, just
terrible. Why, the students are
actually happy now when they
have to go to the library."
"It's nothing like the old li
brary, Boss."
"What a library," Tarnished
said, now flashing the famous
smile with which he led Stan
ford's WOMB (We're Out for
More Bucks) project.
"At least the old library was a
disgrace, Fred," President Tar
nished slapped his knee, roaring
with laughter. "It was so confus
ing that some of those bastards
couldn't even find their way out
of the stacks."
Puppet was rolling on the
floor, giving forth with high
pitched spasms of giggles. "And
how about the RBR, Boss," he
said.
Peace Creeps
"We fixed those peace creeps
with the RBR, all right," Presi
dent Tarnished said, falling off
his chair in mirth, his mouth
foaming with glee. "It was just
like New York City—too hot in
summer, too cold in winter."
"Remember when the War on
Poverty classified it as a slum
area, Boss?" Tears of joy were
rolling down Puppet's cheeks.
President Tarnished climbed
back into his chair. "All that is
gone now, Fred. Just when we
had the students thinking that
Stanford was the best of all
possible worlds. Now they'll
probably start demanding more."
Watermelon
"Yeah, Boss. Rember when we
could keep the students happy
by bringing in a truckload of
watermelon and fried chicken?"
"Sure Puppet, I remember.
When that old truck used to
come rumbling down the Bay
shore once a quarter during the
fifties, they were all happy. They
used to put on their biggest
smiles and their Sunday best.
It was all one big happy fam
ily then."
"That was about the same
time that we built Wilbur, Boss."
"They were really happy about
that, weren't they? It was also
the first thing that we ever built
here that was condemned before
it was completed."
"If those idiots at the library
only knew what the good old
days were like, right, Boss?"
No Alumni Money
"That stupid library won't
bring in a cent of Alumni
money," Tarnished said, his
jowl drooping with disappoint
ment.
"Dean Bigloser said they'll
probably have pot over there too,
Boss. After all, students can
smoke anyplace on the first
floor."
"And they will start reading
books agains," Tarnished said,
frowning. "Then they'll gripe
about education, once they find
out what it's all about."
"It's no use, Boss. You've done
a sterling job, but you just can't
fight the Middle City."
President Tarnished put down

"What a library," Tarnished
said, now flashing the famous
smile with which he led Stan
ford's WOMB (We're Out for
More Bucks) project.
"At least the old library was a
disgrace, Fred," President Tar
nished slapped his knee, roaring
with laughter. "It was so confus
ing that some of those bastards
couldn't even find their way out
of the stacks."
Puppet was rolling on the
floor, giving forth with high
pitched spasms of giggles. "And
how about the RBR, Boss," he
said.
Peace Creeps
"We fixed those peace creeps
with the RBR, all right," Presi
dent Tarnished said, falling off
his chair in mirth, his mouth
foaming with glee. "It was just
like New York City—too hot in
summer, too cold in winter."
"Remember when the War on
Poverty classified it as a slum
area, Boss?" Tears of joy were
rolling down Puppet's cheeks.
President Tarnished climbed
back into his chair. "All that is
gone now, Fred. Just when we
had the students thinking that
Stanford was the best of all
possible worlds. Now they'll
probably start demanding more."
Watermelon
"Yeah, Boss. Rember when we
could keep the students happy
by bringing in a truckload of
watermelon and fried chicken?"
"Sure Puppet, I remember.
When that old truck used to
come rumbling down the Bay
shore once a quarter during the
fifties, they were all happy. They
used to put on their biggest
smiles and their Sunday best.
It was all one big happy fam
ily then."
"That was about the same
time that we built Wilbur, Boss."
"They were really happy about
that, weren't they? It was also
the first thing that we ever built
here that was condemned before
it was completed."
"If those idiots at the library
only knew what the good old
days were like, right, Boss?"
No Alumni Money
"That stupid library won't
bring in a cent of Alumni
money," Tarnished said, his
jowl drooping with disappoint
ment.
"Dean Bigloser said they'll
probably have pot over there too,
Boss. After all, students can
smoke anyplace on the first
floor."
"And they will start reading
books agains," Tarnished said,
frowning. "Then they'll gripe
about education, once they find
out what it's all about."
"It's no use, Boss. You've done
a sterling job, but you just can't
fight the Middle City."
President Tarnished put down
his pipe and turned to his ad
ministrative assistant, Fred Pup
pet.
"I guess we blew it this time,
Fred"
"Yeah, Boss."
"Right when we had the stu
dents where we wanted them,

those idiots at the library had to
go build a library that's com
fortable."
"We was duped, Boss."
"So we were. Doublecrossed
too."
"I tell you Boss, when War
necke came to me with the plans,
he promised me it would be
another Tresidder."
'What A Building'
President Tarnished's face lit
up at the mention of Tresidder.
"What a building," he said, now
smiling, "You can't eat in it,
you can't sleep in it, you can't
study in it. What a building.' '
"Yeah Boss, but Warnecke
done wrong when he planned
that library."
Tarnished was suddenly seri
ous. "It's terrible, Puppet, just
terrible. Why, the students are
actually happy now when they
have to go to the library."
"It's nothing like the old li
brary, Boss."
"What a library," Tarnished
said, now flashing the famous
smile with which he led Stan
ford's WOMB (We're Out for
