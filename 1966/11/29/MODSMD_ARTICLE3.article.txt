# County Officials Conduct SU Police Force Review
## 
### 
The Santa Clara County counsel's
office has begun a special study of
Stanford University's police depart
ment. This study could alter the status
of the 29-member force.
Stanford policemen currently have
the status of special deputies of the
county sheriff's office, with authoriza
tion to carry guns and make arrests.
Sources indicated that the review
could lead to the loss of the right to
carry guns and to make arrests other
than citizens' arrests.
Neither Stanford officials nor coun
ty officials would speculate on possi
ble changes in the status of the Stan
ford police department. They did not
explain why the review was ordered.
Stanford police have been special
deputies for about 40 years, and dur
ing that period their status has been
"reviewed from time to time," said
Stanford Police Chief Gordon Davis.
Davis described the review now un
der way as an "administrative inves
tigation just to make sure everything
is all right. . . . Laws change and from
time to time it's a good idea to check
everything."

He also said that "as far as I
know, there will be no change" in the
status of members of the University
force.
The current review is being con
ducted through the business office
rather than through the police de
partment.
