# Sanford and Katz Debate Theory Of Social Regs
## 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
The philosophy rather than actual
restrictions of current women's social
regulations came under fire yesterday
from R. Nevitt Sanford and Joseph
Katz, leading psychologists from the
Institute for the Study of Human
Problems.
Speaking before an Ad Hoc Social
Regulations Committee meeting at
Tresidder, Sanford and Katz urged
that Stanford social regulations for
women should make "law conform to
custom."
Adjustment To College Life
The main reason for keeping regu
lations for freshman women, accord
ing to Dr. Sanford, is to "provide for
some kind of a gradation" in the ad
justment to college life. When asked

if freshmen and sophomore women
are not mature enough to handle
their own regulations, Dr. Sanford
answered, "Some are, but some aren't
at all prepared for the liberal college
environment."
He explained that "responsibility is
often developed through experience,
and freshmen year regulations often
provide that transition." Social regu
lations, though, should only stimulate
social responsibility; they should not
control. "It may delay taking respon
sibility if they are ready but are un
duly restricted," he commented.
System Unworkable
Present social regulations were ap
proved by President Wallace Sterling
and the Board of Trustees in May,
1965, for a three year trial period. In
a study of last year's freshmen
women, almost 70 percent found the
present system unworkable. The Ad
Hoc Committee was then set up this
fall by the Judicial Council to study
the situation and offer possible reme
dies.
Leslie Gaillard, chairman of the
committee, noted that "the 70 per
cent of last year's Freshmen who
found the present system objection
able thought that there should either
be unlimited hours or none at all."
Dr. Katz asked what the remaining
30 percent of the women thought.
Leslie answered that the matter was
largely one of apathy. "Comments

from the poll indicate that they
thought they were not being unduly
restricted at present or that they
needed the rules to keep themselves
in line," she explained.
Dr. Katz cited a study that he con
ducted at Berkeley in 1961. In that
survey, he found that freshmen
women living in sororities were effec
tively helped through the transition
period by a series of social regs that
regulated their lives, even telling
them when to study. "Since many of
the women came from small towns,
small high schools, and provincial
environments, the sororities came to
serve as 'Momma' to the women. This
was a useful transition climate that
in the long run developed a greater
sense of responsibility.
Widespread Dissatisfaction
Both Leslie and Mimi Sherman,
chairman of the Judicial Council, ex
pressed some concern for the effect
of the widespread dissatisfaction with
current policy on the judicial process.
"Rules should fit the culture, but
definitely are not right now," Leslie
commented. "It's an undermining of
our judicial system."
Mimi finds the present judicial sys
tem partly at fault for the current
problems. Rather than a central judi
cial policy, "each house should con
trol. Any persons who are disturbing
others should be controlled by those
who are disturbed."
