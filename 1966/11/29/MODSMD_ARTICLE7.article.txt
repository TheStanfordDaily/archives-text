# Michigan Students Break With University
## 
### 
ANN ARBOR, Mich. (CPS)—The
University of Michigan student gov
ernment has recently voted to sever
relations with the school following
an administration ban on sit-ins.
Shortly thereafter the Michigan
faculty supported the student de
mands, asking the administration to
suspend its regulations against sit-ins
and reexamine them with student and
faculty consideration.
The sit-in ban was issued Nov. 12
in anticipation of a "vigorous protest
movement against the- administra
tion's policy on a Nov. 16 student
referendum on the draft. The school
said it would refuse to accept the
results of the vote as binding.
No Class Rank
The referendum, with the largest
number of University of Michigan
students ever to vote in a school
election, demanded 6,389 to 3,508
that the University cease supplying
the Selective Service with a student's
class ranks.
With nearly 10,000 out of an Ann
Arbor student body of 30,000 casting
their ballots, 64.5 per cent opted to
cease ranking. Student government
sources said the vote was twice as

high as in any previous election on
the campus.
The ban was enacted by University
Vice-President for Student Affairs
Richard L. Cutler under special au
thority granted to him last month by
the Michigan Regents. The ruling was
Cutler's first application of interim
powers which give him unlimited
authority to establish non-academic
rules while he prepares a new cam
pus judiciary code.
Possible Suspension
Penalties for interfering with the
"normal and orderly operations of
the University" may include proba
tion, monetary fine or suspension.
The Student Government Council
protested Nov. 15 that the establish
ment of the new regulation by-passed
the rightful channels for student con
sultation on rules which affect them.
SGC threatened at that time to break
off ties with Cutler's Office of Stu
dent Affairs if the sit-in regulation
was not rescinded.
"Our quarrel Is not so much with
substantive policies but with the pro
cedures by which they are formu
lated," SGC stated.

"We feel we have an obligation to
express students' opinions in all areas
which concern them, and since the
structure and actions of the OSA
have obstructed the fulfillment of this
role we feel that there will be no
other course than to declare our inde
pendence."
Leaders Unsure
The OSA provides financial support
for SGC as well as controlling the use
of campus facilities for meetings.
Through Nov. 17, when SGC carried
out its threat to break off with the
OSA after a stormy five-and-one-half
hour debate, student leaders seemed
unsure just what the breach would
technically entail.
In a meeting Nov. 18, which packed
the Michigan Union ballroom, some
1,000 students and faculty members
decided to hold a teach-in Nov. 21.
Speakers were to include students,
faculty, and administrators, but the
primary purpose of the meeting was
to determine what course student
government will chart from here and
in what form it will proceed should
it continue the separation.
The underlying issue, Cutler indi

cated to the Regents the day before
he issued the sit-in ban, is one of
student power. "There are strident
demands," he said, "that the Univers
ity accept the results of (the draft)
referendum as binding."
"We are faced once again with the
issue of student powers in the man
agement of the University's affairs,"
he continued. If the referendum were
to go against the University's prac
tices—which it eventually did—Cutler
predicted that the school would be
faced with "demonstrations and sit
ins designed to force the University
to change its policy."
He indicated that sit-ins similar to
those earlier this fall protesting the
University's cooperation with the
House Committee on Un-American
Activities, "won't be allowed to hap
pen again."
Following the SGC break, the Uni
versity President Harlan Hatcher de
plored the action, saying it was a
"most ill-advised and mistaken ac
tion." Several student organizations,
ranging from Panhellenic to the Law
Club, have indicated their support for
the measure, however.
