pus, among them Lewis W. Spitz, now
professor in residence at The Sem
mering.
Walker cites the housing shortage
and the "disadvantages to being in

Vienna" in rejecting "so categorical
a denunciation of the present loca
tion."
He also notes the many educational
opportunities available in Semmering.
"Just a little effort is all it takes,
even as education on the Quad," he
writes.
Austria Controversy
Controversy flared recently when
troubles encountered by Austria II
during this spring and summer high
lighted great dissatisfaction amongst
students and some faculty members
who have spent six months at the
Austrian Campus. The campus opened
in the Panhans Hotel in The Sem
mering one year ago in the expansion
from three to five overseas campuses.
Most critics of the location in The
Semmering have suggested Vienna
as the only location for a campus in
Austria. While admitting that opera,
theater and concerts would be more
accessible, Walker states: "So also
would be a host of non-cultural di
versions and other American stu
dents."
Walker also notes that it would be
just as difficult to meet Austrian
students, who "commute to lectures
and disappear again into the enorm
ous sponge of a great city. Meeting
them would take effort and organiza
tion, just as it does now."
Would Hurt Community
He also expressed fears that such
a move would hurt the "real commu
nity of students, faculty, and staff
members living, eating, and talking
together to establish the personal
rapport so rarely found on the Quad."

During the past few weeks many
disagreements have been aired con
cerning the availability of housing
in Vienna. One professor was quoted
as saying he knew of two locations
available there.
In his letter two weeks ago, Spitz
said: "I will not accept the answer
that it is not possible to find a suit
able location within streetcar distance
of the inner city. The opinion of well
informed and kindly-<lisposed Vien
nese is that an energetic, intelligent,
informed, systematic, independent,
and determined effort to find a suit
able location in Vienna would be suc
cessful." Walker denies this is true.
Two Locations Rejected
"It is not at all certain that facilities
in Vienna can be found readily."
Walker tells of the original search
over two years ago which located
two places in Vienna but that the
two were rejected: "one too small
and one too ancient."
Walker also had criticism for the
cultural desire of the Stanford stu
dents. He said Dr. Straub, Director of
Stanford-in-Austria, cannot get nine
students among the eighty to go to
the opera in Vienna on a free bus
with free tickets.
He cites inexpensive bus service the
campus has initiated as one measure
to alleviate the distance problems. He
also has great praise for the directors,
whom he says are "keenly interested
in the success and best interests of
Stanford's program in Austria."
In closing, Walker calls for getting
"useful and constructive suggestions
into proper lines for serious considera
tions."

Two Locations Rejected
"It is not at all certain that facilities
in Vienna can be found readily."
Walker tells of the original search
over two years ago which located
two places in Vienna but that the
two were rejected: "one too small
and one too ancient."
Walker also had criticism for the
cultural desire of the Stanford stu
dents. He said Dr. Straub, Director of
Stanford-in-Austria, cannot get nine
students among the eighty to go to
the opera in Vienna on a free bus
with free tickets.
He cites inexpensive bus service the
campus has initiated as one measure
to alleviate the distance problems. He
also has great praise for the directors,
whom he says are "keenly interested
in the success and best interests of
Stanford's program in Austria."
In closing, Walker calls for getting
"useful and constructive suggestions
into proper lines for serious considera
tions."

pus, among them Lewis W. Spitz, now
professor in residence at The Sem
mering.
Walker cites the housing shortage
and the "disadvantages to being in

Vienna" in rejecting "so categorical
a denunciation of the present loca
tion."
He also notes the many educational
opportunities available in Semmering.
"Just a little effort is all it takes,
even as education on the Quad," he
writes.
Austria Controversy
Controversy flared recently when
troubles encountered by Austria II
during this spring and summer high
lighted great dissatisfaction amongst
students and some faculty members
who have spent six months at the
Austrian Campus. The campus opened
in the Panhans Hotel in The Sem
mering one year ago in the expansion
from three to five overseas campuses.
Most critics of the location in The
Semmering have suggested Vienna
as the only location for a campus in
Austria. While admitting that opera,
theater and concerts would be more
accessible, Walker states: "So also
would be a host of non-cultural di
versions and other American stu
dents."
Walker also notes that it would be
just as difficult to meet Austrian
students, who "commute to lectures
and disappear again into the enorm
ous sponge of a great city. Meeting
them would take effort and organiza
tion, just as it does now."
Would Hurt Community
He also expressed fears that such
a move would hurt the "real commu
nity of students, faculty, and staff
members living, eating, and talking
together to establish the personal
rapport so rarely found on the Quad."

During the past few weeks many
disagreements have been aired con
cerning the availability of housing
in Vienna. One professor was quoted
as saying he knew of two locations
available there.
In his letter two weeks ago, Spitz
said: "I will not accept the answer
that it is not possible to find a suit
able location within streetcar distance
of the inner city. The opinion of well
informed and kindly-<lisposed Vien
nese is that an energetic, intelligent,
informed, systematic, independent,
and determined effort to find a suit

cessful." Walker denies this is true.
