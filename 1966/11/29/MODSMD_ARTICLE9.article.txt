# Mancall, Anderson Hold ASSU Seminar
## 
### 
Students looking for a chance to
spend three days working closely
with two distinguished professors, or
simply trying to get away from the
normal classroom situation for a short
time, can sign up for the ASSU win
ter seminar this morning.
Professors Mark Mancall of the his
tory department and Bo Anderson of
sociology will lead the seminar, titled
"Convulsive Politics and Development
in the Third World."
Begins Winter Quarter
It will start the Friday afternoon
after winter quarter registration and

continue through Sunday evening. It
will be held off campus, perhaps at the
mountain camp south of Santa Cruz
where the first of the new seminars,
with Professor Nevitt Sanford, was
held at the beginning of fall quarter.
The signup, which will begin at 9
a.m. this morning in the ASSU office,
is limited to 15 students, not more
than three of whom may come from
any one residence.
Credit Given
Participants will receive two units
of credit for directed reading in either
history or sociology, and will study
selected problems dealing with social
and political development in under
developed courses.
As Professor Anderson explained,
"Underdeveloped countries generally
have a greater political instability,
often have revolutionary situations,
and over a long period of time there
are going to be upheavals in these
countries.
"We intend to examine some of
these instances and try to understand
more about the factors that lead to
these instabilities."
Prior Preparation
All students in the seminar will
have to complete a reading list be
fore going, and work during the
seminar will consist of discussion and
additional reading. No papers will be
required.
The new program was set up last
spring by ASSU Vice-President Clark
Brown, who pointed out that many
educators had long pointed out that
the undergraduate's academic exper
ience is fragmented by short class
hours and limited by his infrequent
contact with scholars.
Overcomes Deficiencies
According to Brown, this program
hopes to overcome some of these de
ficiencies by providing the student
with an opportunity for extended in
teraction with a professor and the
chance to examine an intellectual area
in depth and with some leisure.
An eight dollar deposit for food will
be required at the signup, with all
other expenses being taken care of.
