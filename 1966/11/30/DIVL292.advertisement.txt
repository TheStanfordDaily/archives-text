DO YOU HAVE THE COURAGE
JUDGE FOR YOURSELF?
You have been hearing about Objectivism. You will be hearing
a great deal more with every year that passes. Reports, pro or
con, are often less than reliable. Why not find out first hand?
"Objectivism has forged a revolution among today's intellec
tuals. It stands in complete opposition to the political, social
and religious attitudes of our day." We are perhaps the only
advocates of reason amidst the irrationalism of today's culture.
THE OBJECTIVIST is a monthly journal, edited by Ayn Rand
and Nathaniel Branden, that deals with the theoretical aspects
of Objectivism, with its application to modern problems, and
with the evaluation of today's cultural trends. It features articles
by Ayn Rand, Nathaniel Branden and other contributors, on
ethics, political economy, psychology, literature.
