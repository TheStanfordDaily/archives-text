We'll award the brass figligee with bronze oak-leaf palm
to anybody out there who can identify the author and the
novel referred to in this quotation from a review in the Ntu>
York Post: "The author obviously grew up in a Chicago
shadowed Indiana mill-town and he . . . emerges with a
spirited and enteitaining tale of well-spent youth. All of
the characters are so believable we'd like to get to know
them better, and many incidents are gloriously funny."
Okay, we'll give you a hint. This author (let's call him
Charlie Applerot for the moment) has been described by
the New York Times as "one of the greatest raconteurs in
the history of radio." Satyr, the humor magazine of UCLA
said "Applerot is a unique phenomenon: a social critic in
the mass medium."
What's that? No, it's NOT Susan Sontag, for crying out
loud!
Who? Nat Hentoff? The Catcher in the WHAT? Holy
Smoke! Isn't there anybody out there who listens to the
radio?
Look. This guy once played the sousaphone. He won the
Playboy Humor Satire Award in 1965. (And again in 1966.
Wow! Consecutive! The first time in Playboy history!) He
appears every Saturday night at a place called the Village
Limelight. He's been a columnist for the Village Voice and
the Realist.
He's written plays, movies, compiled anthologies, and
acted on the legitimate stage. He performs at colleges. Six
nights a week he tells them on the Jersey Turnpike what life
is all about. Now he's written a novel which gets down to
the furry, evil, green-eyed reality inside all of us!
The syllables in his name are blank, blank-blank. All
right, all together gang, who is it?
Who said John Updike? Look kid, why don't you go out
and get yourself a job this summer. Maybe you'll learn
something for a change. We have just what you need. It's
called the Summer Employment Guide 1967 and we put
it out in paperback for the National Employment Services
institute and sell it for $2.95. It has over 50,000 job possi
bilities in recreation, government, and business arranged
geographically and by type of job. There must be something
somewhere you can do.
Oh, all right. Don't cry. You really want to know about
the other thing? Okay, bring it up in the control room — a
little of that Reality Razzmatazz. Shepherd! Yes, as a
public service, Mr. Jean Shepherd, everybody's favorite,
has written a novel of reality entitled In God We Trust,
All Others Pay Cash. It is at your college store now and
it costs $4.50 and if you want one more reason to buy it
Miles Smith of the good old A.P. says: "This is a genuinely
funny book . . . about a 20th century Tom Sawyer ... It
isn't funny-bitter; it is funny ha-ha . . . Grab it for a real
adventure into unabashed pleasure."
