# Overseas Campus Directors Agree On Program Changes
## 
### KIRK HANSON Managing Editor 
The directors of the Overseas Cam
puses last week unanimously recom
mended changes in curriculum and
social regulations in the Overseas
Campus program.
The academic changes are now sub
ject to approval by the Committee on
General Studies and will be presented
to the subcommittee on Overseas
Campuses today. The changes in so
cial regulations will be considered by
the Dean of Students Office.
"The Directors approved and un
animously recommended greatly im
proved flexibility in the academic pro
gram," Robert A. Walker, Director of
the Overseas Campus Program, told
The Daily yesterday.

They called for an expanded course
schedule and greater choice of cours
es for the individual student. Two 2-
unit "culture" courses are recom
mended for each quarter at each cam
pus. American professors at the cam
puses are also to be asked to give a
seminar as well the lecture course
they are presently asked to give.
These seminars would be readily ac
cessible to all, with students not re
quired to take the lecture course ex
cept where the professor feels it im
perative.
Each student could sign up for
courses totalling 14, 16, or 18 units.
Included among these would be at
least one course or seminar by an
American professor, the language

course, and at least one 2-unit culture
course.
The expanded offering in 2-unit cul
ture courses will include one related
to the civilization of the country and
the other concerning the history, liter
ature, or art of the country. They
would be taught by nationals of the
country where the campus is located.
Social Regs
In social regulations, the directors
recommended limited open houses
whereas none are presently allowed,
a modification of the restriction re
quiring women to travel always in
groups of at least two, and an adjust
ment in the liquor policy.
The present liquor regulation in ef
fect overseas is stated: "No liquor is
to be kept in rooms and students are

not permitted to consume or serve
hard liquor at the Centers."
"The hard liquor prohibition will
remain," says Walker. He indicated
the directors favored putting more
emphasis on "disorderly conduct" re
sulting from the drinking of liquor.
The changes made partially paral
leled changes outlined in the Martin
dale Report, a set of recommendations
prepared last spring by an ad-hoc
committee of students. "We consider
ed point by point the Martindale Re
port," said Walker.
Civ Courses Overseas
One of the recommendations of the
Martindale Report was for a civiliza
tion course to be taught to students
before they attended an overseas cam
pus.
According to Dr. Walker, the direc
tors do not feel the civilization course
should be taken before coming to the
overseas campus. However, they "re
commend strongly that students take
a background history of the country.
They do not recommend this as a re
quirement."
No recommendation was made by
the directors on dress regulations, the
prohibition of motorcycles, or the re
quired hours of leaving and returning
from weekend trips. They also re
jected as "meaningless' the national
versus European experience contro
versy.
General Studies
Dr. Walker pointed out that with
the changes in the academic program
and the pass-fail grading introduced
this quarter at the overseas campuses
as well as here, students who attend
an overseas campus no longer auto
matically fulfill their humanities and
social science requirements of the
general studies program.
General studies requirements may
not be taken pass-fail and if the direc
tors' recommendations are adopted,
students will no longer have to even
take all the humanities and social
science courses.
Language courses must still be
taken on a graded basis and the adop
tion of pass-fail grading in the culture
courses is left to each campus. Simil
ar requirements are in effect at the
English campus where language
courses are not taken as such.
"It is my hope that we can put
these social regulations into effect at
the beginning of Winter Quarter,"
said Walker yesterday. "Putting the
academic changes into effect will be
a gradual thing as can be done with
the Stanford professors already going
overseas."
Walker returned late last week
from Rome where the directors met
for three days. The conference was
originally scheduled for Florence but
was moved due to the floods.

"The hard liquor prohibition will
remain," says Walker. He indicated
the directors favored putting more
emphasis on "disorderly conduct" re
sulting from the drinking of liquor.
The changes made partially paral
leled changes outlined in the Martin
dale Report, a set of recommendations
prepared last spring by an ad-hoc
committee of students. "We consider
ed point by point the Martindale Re
port," said Walker.
Civ Courses Overseas
One of the recommendations of the
Martindale Report was for a civiliza
tion course to be taught to students
before they attended an overseas cam
pus.
According to Dr. Walker, the direc
tors do not feel the civilization course
should be taken before coming to the
overseas campus. However, they "re
commend strongly that students take
a background history of the country.
They do not recommend this as a re
quirement."
No recommendation was made by
the directors on dress regulations, the
prohibition of motorcycles, or the re
quired hours of leaving and returning
from weekend trips. They also re
jected as "meaningless' the national
versus European experience contro
versy.
General Studies
Dr. Walker pointed out that with
the changes in the academic program
and the pass-fail grading introduced
this quarter at the overseas campuses
as well as here, students who attend
an overseas campus no longer auto
matically fulfill their humanities and
social science requirements of the
general studies program.
General studies requirements may
not be taken pass-fail and if the direc
tors' recommendations are adopted,
students will no longer have to even
take all the humanities and social
science courses.
Language courses must still be
taken on a graded basis and the adop
tion of pass-fail grading in the culture
courses is left to each campus. Simil
ar requirements are in effect at the
English campus where language
courses are not taken as such.
"It is my hope that we can put
these social regulations into effect at
the beginning of Winter Quarter,"
said Walker yesterday. "Putting the
academic changes into effect will be
a gradual thing as can be done with
the Stanford professors already going
overseas."
Walker returned late last week
from Rome where the directors met
for three days. The conference was
originally scheduled for Florence but
was moved due to the floods.
The directors of the Overseas Cam
puses last week unanimously recom
mended changes in curriculum and
social regulations in the Overseas
Campus program.
The academic changes are now sub
ject to approval by the Committee on
General Studies and will be presented
to the subcommittee on Overseas
Campuses today. The changes in so
cial regulations will be considered by
the Dean of Students Office.
"The Directors approved and un
animously recommended greatly im
proved flexibility in the academic pro
gram," Robert A. Walker, Director of
the Overseas Campus Program, told
The Daily yesterday.

They called for an expanded course
schedule and greater choice of cours
es for the individual student. Two 2-
unit "culture" courses are recom
mended for each quarter at each cam
pus. American professors at the cam
puses are also to be asked to give a
seminar as well the lecture course
they are presently asked to give.
These seminars would be readily ac
cessible to all, with students not re
quired to take the lecture course ex
cept where the professor feels it im
perative.
Each student could sign up for
courses totalling 14, 16, or 18 units.
Included among these would be at
least one course or seminar by an
American professor, the language

course, and at least one 2-unit culture
course.
The expanded offering in 2-unit cul
ture courses will include one related
to the civilization of the country and
the other concerning the history, liter
ature, or art of the country. They
would be taught by nationals of the
country where the campus is located.
Social Regs
In social regulations, the directors
recommended limited open houses
whereas none are presently allowed,
a modification of the restriction re
quiring women to travel always in
groups of at least two, and an adjust
ment in the liquor policy.
The present liquor regulation in ef
fect overseas is stated: "No liquor is
to be kept in rooms and students are

not permitted to consume or serve
hard liquor at the Centers."
"The hard liquor prohibition will
remain," says Walker. He indicated
the directors favored putting more
emphasis on "disorderly conduct" re
