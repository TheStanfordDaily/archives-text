## There Is An Italian Campus 
### BARBARA WARREN 
Contrary to rumor, Stanford-in-
Italy Group XIII will not be com
ing home early.
George R. Hamrdla, Assistant
Director of the Overseas Program,
called the various rumors now cir
culating on the home campus, "com
pletely untrue." Hamrdla said the
Villa itself was unaffected by the
flood, and there are definitely no
plans to bring the students home
or to move the campus to Rome,
as other reports had speculated.
The group was rumored to have
started a petition to come back
at the end of this quarter because
of the inconveniences in flood
ravaged Florence. Dr. Robert Walk
er, writing from Rome last week,
noticed no such indication on the
part of the students. Mrs. Allen of

the Overseas Campus office, who
has talked to most of the students'
parents, reported that the letters
sent home have been enthusiastic
about staying.
The complaints trickling back to
Stanford in correspondence tell of
water supply shortages. Hamrdla
said the Villa had its own well
which provides a limited supply of
drinking water, but that other ar
rangements were made for the rest
of the water supply.
The heat failure at the Villa hap
pening at the same time had no
connection with the flood. The coin
cidental breakage in the heating
system could not be fixed Im
mediately, however, because the re
pairman's shop had been wiped out
by the flood. The heat was back
in working order before Walker

left Italy, however.
Mrs. Allen flatly denied the
stories that students had been for
bidden to travel or were confined
to quarters. She stated that the
second weekend many from the
Italy group joined Britain ll's field
trip in Rome.
An epidemic scare of infectious
hepititus hail been started by a
faulty press release. Dr. Giuseppe
Mammarella, Director of the Flor
ence Campus, sent word reassuring
the Overseas Office that all stu
dents had been vaccinated with
gamma gloublin as a precaution
and no epidemics have materialized.
IVlammareila, concerned by the
exaggerated accounts of the dis
aster, emphasized that Florence
itself is picking itself out of the
mud and returning to normal.
