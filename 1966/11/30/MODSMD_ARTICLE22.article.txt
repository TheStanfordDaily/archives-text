The Truman Administration:
A Documentary History, Edited
by Barton J. Bernstein and
Allen J. Matusow, (Harper &
Row), $10.
Asked to name the outstand
ing developments during the
Truman administration, one
would probably include the Kor
ean War, the beginning of the
Cold War, the problems of our
China Policy, the McCarthy
hearings, and the Fair Deal.
At any rate, these topics,
along with the Atomic bomb pol
icy and inflation and politics in
the immediate post-war period
serve as the major events and
policies represented in The
Truman Administration: A Doc
umentary History, edited by
Barton J. Bernstein and Allen
J. Matusow.
Each of the seven sections
opens with a lucid introductory
sketch of background informa
tion; the individual documents
in each subdivision are then in
troduced and related by similar
ly well written explanatory
paragraphs.
In choosing the documents,
the editors were obviously con
fronted with an overwhelming
assortment of material: this is
reflected in their final selections,
which are excellent, although
one wishes that more attention
had been paid to Truman's role
and personality.
Over-Ambitious
Unfortunately, the editors
seem over-ambitious in trying
to include a number of sources
sufficient to give a detailed pic
ture of the evolution of policies
and of the course of events. As
a result, selections tend to be
extremely short excerpts of let
ters reports, and speeches, and
these brief exposures deprive
the selections of their value as

first-hand source material: one
cannot Judge the tone, content,
or Import of a speech or letter
from a mere paragraph or two.
Those documents which are'
reprinted at length, such as
Mac Arthur's speech to the Con
gress and Kennan's telegram
concerning post-war Russian
policy, provide the reader with
much for feeling for the
events. More selections of simi
lar length should have been in
cluded.
As it is, the editors try to
document in fair detail the de
velopment of events and poli
cies, but because of the complex
ity of the events they choose,
they must limit the scope and
depth of too many of the selec
tions. More comprehensive In
troductions and fewer, moife
complete selections would have
made for much more interesting
and meaningful reading.
Logical Progression
The seven chapter headings
include the major events of the
Truman Administration and the
documentation, despite its frag
mentation, is pertinent and rep
resentative. In most cases there
is a logical progression from
document to document, transi
tions being east-d by short intro
ductory paragraphs.
While the sections on the
Atomic bomb and on our China
policy are good in this respect,
those on inflation and politics
In 1945 and 1946 and on the Fair
Deal tend to be somewhat cha
otic if only because there is not
a specific event or series of
events around which to organize
the material.
The Truman Administration,
then, provides a broad but often
spotty coverage of the major
events of Truman's
perhaps adequate and interest
ing to a casual reader.
