# MURAL PLAYOFFS
## Four Greek Squads Remain 
### 
Four touch football teams, out
of eighty-four entries, remain in
the running for the university
championship, and all represent
fraternities.
The last two non-Greek squads,
Madera and Beta Biz, were elim
inated by Theta Delt and S.A.E.
yesterday, setting up today's all
fraternity semifinals, with the
championship round scheduled
for Friday.
Theta Delt, which encountered
stiff resistance from the frosh
before winning 13-8, will be
opposed by Phi Kap, a 19-7 win
ner over the K.A.'s on Monday.

They will play on Field 3, along
side their respective "B" teams
who are meeting for their divi
sion championship on Field 2.
S.AE., whose defense proved
a match for a much bigger Beta
Biz squad in a 7-0 win, will
face newly-dubbed Sigma Chi
Omega, who jumped off to a
two â€¢ touchdown lead and then
had to survive a late Delt rally
for a bruising 13-7 decision.
That game is on Field 5, and
everything starts at 3:45 p.m.
In addition to the finals berths,
two winning streaks are on the
line. S.A.E.'s victory yesterday

was its eighth straight, and the
Phi Kaps' win Monday was their
ninth in a row.
