# Sheerer Selected To All-Conference Team
## 
### 
Gary Sheerer's selection as the
NorCal Tournament's Outstand
ing Player and AAWA All-Con
ference mark the latest step
ping stones down a watery road
paved with success. And that
road leads to Mexico City, and
beyond.
Sheerer earned recognition as
a first team All-American last
year as a sophomore. He played
only 2/3 of the season, missing
a chunk in the middle with a
broken wrist.
Summer, 1966, brought more
of a good thing. The nation's
AAU coaches selected Sheerer
as the AAU Outstanding Player
for his performance in the AAU
National Tournament (which his
team won). After the Nationals,
Sheerer toured Europe with

teammate John Parker and the
victorious Foothill Aquatic Club.
Sheerer got off this season on
the wrong foot—he nearly broke
it in a car accident. Sheerer was
soon back in the pool with the
ankle hidden by tape. Gary
scored 46 times for the season
and threw an incredible 29 as
sist passes. This boils down to
5 goals a game for the 5'9", 160
pound graduate of Await High
School.
Stick'ney's named Sheerer
Stanford Athlete of the Month
for November. Sheerer, who
broke the NCAA freshman rec
ord for the 200 freestyle as a
freshman, now looks forward to
the swimming season that may
put Stanford on the pinnacle
the Indians missed in water
polo.

side.
GOLF CHAMPIONSHIP
George Bevan and Leith An
derson will play 36 holes Satur
day for the University golf
championship on the Stanford
golf course.


GARY SHEERER
Gary Sheerer's selection as the
NorCal Tournament's Outstand
ing Player and AAWA All-Con
ference mark the latest step
ping stones down a watery road
paved with success. And that
road leads to Mexico City, and
beyond.
Sheerer earned recognition as
a first team All-American last
year as a sophomore. He played
only 2/3 of the season, missing
a chunk in the middle with a
broken wrist.
Summer, 1966, brought more
of a good thing. The nation's
AAU coaches selected Sheerer
as the AAU Outstanding Player
for his performance in the AAU
National Tournament (which his
team won). After the Nationals,
Sheerer toured Europe with

teammate John Parker and the
victorious Foothill Aquatic Club.
Sheerer got off this season on
the wrong foot—he nearly broke
it in a car accident. Sheerer was
soon back in the pool with the
ankle hidden by tape. Gary
scored 46 times for the season
and threw an incredible 29 as
sist passes. This boils down to
5 goals a game for the 5'9", 160
pound graduate of Await High
School.
Stick'ney's named Sheerer
Stanford Athlete of the Month
for November. Sheerer, who
broke the NCAA freshman rec
ord for the 200 freestyle as a
freshman, now looks forward to
the swimming season that may
put Stanford on the pinnacle
the Indians missed in water
polo.
