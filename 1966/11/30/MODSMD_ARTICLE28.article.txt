## The 						Status Of Fun Stan: Violated Or Still Viable 
### Bob Fishman 
Whatever happened to the
Fundamental Standard?
That noble statute which used
to protect the honor of Stan
ford men and the virtue of
Stanford women seems to have
accompanied Dean Allen on her
"terminal leave of absence."
In the "golden age of the Fun
damental Standard," a broken
door panel could mean a year's
suspension. Now, assault-and
battery draws only a mild re
buke.
'I'll Scratch Yours ..
Initial jurisdiction over fra
ternity incidents has been given
to the Interfraternity Council.
This is a little like giving initial
jurisdiction over ganglang kill
ings to the Mafia.
Last year the Fundamenta
Standard Committee was abol
ished,and even the committee
members did not know it.
The Daily has finally run a
series of articles on judicial
procedures, which means that
the subject must really be dead.
But the coup de grace has
been delivered by the Under
graduate Library.
New Covenant
Procedures at the Library are
based on the Fundamental Stan
dard's assertion that students
can be — and ought to be —
trusted.
But attempting to leave ULib
is an experience paralleled only
by attempting to leave the Tow
er of London after the Crown
Jewels have been stolen. At each
exit a guard is stationed with
express instructions to examine
the personal effects (and per
sons) of all students.
Not only are books looked

through to make sure that they
have been checked out, but stu
dents are also requested on
occasion to open their pocket
books or take off their jackets.
Luckily, books are fairly easy
to spot.
But when the Undergraduate
Library starts stocking micro
films, who knows what may hap
pen? The library might have to
put male and female clerks at
each exit.
More Than A Lib Plot
A few students have reasoned
that the new procedures are too
good for a mere library.
In fact, rumors are rapidly
spreading that the basement of
the Undergraduate Library is
the secret headquarters of the
Strategic Air Command.
Scattered at random through

the stacks are the top-secret
plans for the defense of the free
world. They are bound in book
covers with title like "The His
tory of Akron, Ohio from 1946-
1802."
Check Point Charlie
The checkers exist to make
sure that no student inadvertant
ly takes out the plans. The
checkout procedure, therefore, is
vital to the security of the free
world.
But if this rumor is false, and
the checkout procedure exists
only to keep the students hon
est, then it seems to me that
the whole thing is a waste of
time.
Stanford students are all hon
est, and I can prove it. It says
so in the Fundamental Stan
dard.
