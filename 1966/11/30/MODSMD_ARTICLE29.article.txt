## Variations On A German Tune With New Two Part Harmony 
### Art Buchwald 
There was a spate of so-called
neo-Nazi activity in last week's
Bavarian elections in Germany
and naturally everyone who
lived through World War II is
slightly nervous.
What the emergence of a new
right wing in Germany means is
hard to say, but it's quite pos
sible that after denying for 20
years that they were Nazis,
many former members of the
party feel it politically wise to
insist they were.
"Hen* Schmidt, you're very
kind to see me in your Bavarian
Schloss. There are rumors that
you were a member of the
Nazi Party."
"Vat do you mean rumors I
was a loyal Nazi til the very
end."
"But in your testimony at the
Nuremberg trials you denied it."
"Lies, all lies. Ask anyone.
Ven you thought of Schmidt,
you thought of Nazis, and ven
you thought of Nazis, you
thought of Sohmidt."
"But surely, sir, you were a
minor functionary, a victim of
circumstances."
Ruination
"Are you trying to ruin my
political career? I was Gauleiter
in charge of an entire district.
Would you like to see my black
boots?"

"But even so, you said at
your trial that you didn't know
Eichmann."
"Vat do you mean I didn't
know Eichmann? I was his best
friend. We worked side by side
in the same office. Ve shared
the same locker."
"But isn't it true that you only
followed orders?"
"Vat kind of question is that?
I gave the orders. Vas I some
sort of robot who just did what
people told me to do?"
"I guess what has confused
me was your testimony at
Nuremberg."
It's All Coming Back
"I vas in a daze at Nurem
berg. I couldn't remember any
thing. But it's all come back to
me now. If you don't believe
me, read the record."
"You said you had become
disillusioned with Adolph Hitler
in 1933 and you only stayed in
the party because you were
afraid of being put into prison."
"That's ridiculous. I luffed
Hitler like a brother. He gave
me the Iron Cross and I still
have an autographed photo
taken with him and Eva Braun.
Here it is in my campaign litera
ture."
"Then you were not in on the
plot to kill Hitler in 1944?"

"I vas the one who discovered
the plot and saved his life."
"You also said at Nuremberg
that you never knew there were
any concentration camps in Ger
many."
"How could I say such a thing
ven I built them? I vas the
father of the concentration
camps."
"You certainly seem to be a
different man that you were in
1946."
"I vas caught up in the emo
tions of the time. I hope people
will judge me now, not by
what I said in 1946, but by what
I did in 1939."
"Well, thank you, sir."
"It vas my pleasure, and by
the way, Heil Hitler."
