# Panel Debates Fraternities' Place In University Residence Program
## 
### MIKE MORTON 
Six members of the University com
munity met last night at Tresidder in
a panel discussion of "Fraternities
and the University." The participants
represented a wide variety of opin
ions on the subject and were able to
concretize and clarify many of the
issues which may well determine the
future existence or non-existence of
fraternities at Stanford.
The panel, moderated by Professor
of Philosophy Philip H. Rhinelander,
consisted of Dave Harris, ASSU Presi
dent; Dale Matschullat, Phi Sigma
Kappa; Peter Love, Theta Delta Chi;
Leith Anderson, de-activated Kappa
Sigma and presently sponsor at Otero;
Dick Williams, president of Beta Chi
and prime mover behind this fratern
ity's new "open-door" policy.
The discussion immediately sprang
to life with Prof. Rhinelander posing
the question, "What is the function of
living groups in general and fra
ternities in particular, and how do the
Stanford fraternities fulfill this role?"
Matschullat considered living groups
primarily an aid to education. In this
respect, he said, the fraternity is par
ticularly useful because it "provides
community" which facilitates the ed
ucation process. Williams concurred
in this view, adding that we must con
stantly challenge the fraternities, "Is
a community of scholars being de
veloped?"
Dave Harris immediately took to
the offensive, attacking the concept of
selective living.He stated what he con
sidered a fundamental contradiction
between the professed fraternity ideal
of brotherhood and the exclusive char
acter of selective living.

In rebuttal to Harris, Matschullat
pointed out that pratical considera
tions demand some sort of selection
to allow for any sort of community
feeling and inter-member commit
ment.
At this point, Prof. Rhinelander of
fered a second question, "Is the rush
system the best possible? What about
the 'no-contact' rule?"

It is in the "lack of humanity" of
rushing that Harris found the source
of many of his objections to fratern
ities. Attacking the "salesman" tech
niques of fraternity men, he stated
that "rush treats people as commodi
ties to be bought and sold," an atti
tude, in his mind, destructive to any
concept of brotherhood.
