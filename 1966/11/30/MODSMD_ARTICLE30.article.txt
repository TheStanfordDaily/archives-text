## Lib Has Everything From A To... z z z z 
### Nick Selby 
Well, it took me an entire
week, but I finally found out
what really is wrong with the
new Undergraduate library. No,
Mr. McMahon, you chastiser of
University and Library officials,
the shortage of books is not the
library's problem.
The key shortage in the new
library is a lack of No-Doz pills
to keep students awake. What
with the soft colors, chairs you
can sink into half a mile, and
unbelievable quiet, it is easy
to drop your eyelids for an
hour or so.
The problem with the library
is that is too comfortable. After
a two hour respite in dream
land from the rigors of studying,
I was curious to see how many
other students were as eager in
their pursuit of knowledge as I
was.
Rip Roarln' Philosophy
Being too tired after my sleep
to walk up and down the stairs,
and too groggy to think of the
elevators, I examined only the
main floor of the library. I then
had to rely on the principles of
Mathematics to estimate the
total number of sleepers.
Sure enough, as I pushed the
sand out of my eyes, I per
ceived several others locked in
on the land of Rip Van Winkle.
Three were snoring silently in
the large easy chairs; their
heavy chins supported by a palm
and an elbow in the other palm.
The pose looked very philosoph
ical.
Two others had just collapsed
at their places on the big desks.
Their cheeks were buried in a
mountain of books, note cards,
and papers, a position I found
far more comfortable than that
in the easy chairs.
Good Terms
I think it's a safe bet that
more than one term paper won't
make it to the prof before the

start of Dead Week. One sleeper
had dozed off standing up while
filling out a card.
I quickly remembered that
there were two other floors,
which, although they had less
chairs, were less frequented and
more silent, therefore having
more appeal to the sly cat-nap
per. So I estimated ten sleepers
for each of these two floors.
This gave a total of 26.
But I figured at least two peo
ple had fallen asleep listening to
German tapes, probably three
more listening to Chinese in the
new language lab on the first
floor. Aha! 31 sleepers, and may
be a few more in the seminar
rooms to bring the tally to 35.
Hooray!
Affair Of The Heart
Where is the heart of this
great University, I ask? The li
brary, you answer. And you'll
be right as soon as the snack
bar is added to the other fea
tures, such as the turnstiles,
photocopiers, typewriters, and
pretty librarians.
Yes, you'll be able to eat,
sleep and study, without ever
leaving the confines of the li
brary. It's an exciting prospect,
and one that raises new prob
lems for University officials.
'On And In'
Overcrowding will be the main
fear. Miss Janet Howell will
probably demand the right to
live in the library, distributing
"Back On and In" buttons, and
blankets for each easy chair.
This might be a good way to
achieve Dave Harris' hopes of
a co-ed dorm. Surely, the library
couldn't be split up.
So how about it, you Library
officials? Let's get some good
old fashioned hard, uncomfort
able chairs in there so we stu
dents can get some work done.
You'll save yourself some prob
lems in the long run, too.

leaving the confines of the li
brary. It's an exciting prospect,
and one that raises new prob
lems for University officials.
'On And In'
Overcrowding will be the main
fear. Miss Janet Howell will
probably demand the right to
live in the library, distributing
"Back On and In" buttons, and
blankets for each easy chair.
This might be a good way to
achieve Dave Harris' hopes of
a co-ed dorm. Surely, the library
couldn't be split up.
So how about it, you Library
officials? Let's get some good
old fashioned hard, uncomfort
able chairs in there so we stu
dents can get some work done.
You'll save yourself some prob
lems in the long run, too.
Well, it took me an entire
week, but I finally found out
what really is wrong with the
new Undergraduate library. No,
Mr. McMahon, you chastiser of
University and Library officials,
the shortage of books is not the
library's problem.
The key shortage in the new
library is a lack of No-Doz pills
to keep students awake. What
with the soft colors, chairs you
can sink into half a mile, and
unbelievable quiet, it is easy
to drop your eyelids for an
hour or so.
The problem with the library
is that is too comfortable. After
a two hour respite in dream
land from the rigors of studying,
I was curious to see how many
other students were as eager in
their pursuit of knowledge as I
was.
Rip Roarln' Philosophy
Being too tired after my sleep
to walk up and down the stairs,
and too groggy to think of the
elevators, I examined only the
main floor of the library. I then
had to rely on the principles of
Mathematics to estimate the
total number of sleepers.
Sure enough, as I pushed the
sand out of my eyes, I per
ceived several others locked in
on the land of Rip Van Winkle.
Three were snoring silently in
the large easy chairs; their
heavy chins supported by a palm
and an elbow in the other palm.
The pose looked very philosoph
ical.
Two others had just collapsed
at their places on the big desks.
Their cheeks were buried in a
mountain of books, note cards,
and papers, a position I found
far more comfortable than that
in the easy chairs.
Good Terms
I think it's a safe bet that
more than one term paper won't
make it to the prof before the

start of Dead Week. One sleeper
had dozed off standing up while
filling out a card.
I quickly remembered that
there were two other floors,
which, although they had less
chairs, were less frequented and
more silent, therefore having
more appeal to the sly cat-nap
per. So I estimated ten sleepers
for each of these two floors.
This gave a total of 26.
But I figured at least two peo
ple had fallen asleep listening to
German tapes, probably three
more listening to Chinese in the
new language lab on the first
floor. Aha! 31 sleepers, and may
be a few more in the seminar
rooms to bring the tally to 35.
Hooray!
Affair Of The Heart
Where is the heart of this
great University, I ask? The li
brary, you answer. And you'll
be right as soon as the snack
bar is added to the other fea
tures, such as the turnstiles,
photocopiers, typewriters, and
pretty librarians.
Yes, you'll be able to eat,
sleep and study, without ever
leaving the confines of the li
brary. It's an exciting prospect,
