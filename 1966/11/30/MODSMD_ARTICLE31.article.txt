## Relative Judgment Of Frats 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Well, it seems that both the
Administration and the Judicial
Council are quick to note the in
dependence of the Delta Tau's
from the fraternity system in
the Harris haircut fiasco. Ap
parently, this action, which re
quired the severe penalty of sus
pension, was simply developed
by a bunch of guys who were
not representative of those noble
Greek clusters out there. This
seems a blatant attempt to
justify the system by what good
it does and not by what bad it
does. When the system does a

Good, it is immediately seen as
further evidence to justify its
existence. When it does a Bad, it
is claimed to be an independent
action by an unrepresentative
collection of guys who just hap
pen to be members of a fra
ternity.
The point is just what is repre
sentative of those people. Are
the Delta Taus unique and not
reflective of the system? Are
the Phi Delts the same? And
what about the fraternities in
the past who were kicked off
campus? Am I really supposed
to divorce these people from the

system as a whole? Winbigler,
apparently, would like me to.
I have often asked myself
what constructive purpose the
fraternity system serves. To
date, no positive answer has
been given by myself, friends,
or the fraternity group. The sys
tem does solve a housing prob
lem, but is that justification
enough? While I have been
here, I have not attended one
function of that system whicli
seemed relevant to Stanford's
"greatness" image. I have wit
nessed a few of the atrociously
absurd by-products of the sys
tem which I am led to believe
are isloated, independent phe
nomena. In one sense, fraterni
ties represent an archaic institu
tion which has outlived its func
tion. Yet it remains.
Ironically, those of us who
would like to see the system
abolished will not see it. Private
universities are alumni sensitive,
unfortunately. And at least a
significant portion of those who
donate money are graduates of
the system. Thus it seems highly
unlikely that the system will
ever be tossed out.
I have often talked to peo
ple about the academic spirit
and general intellectual pursuits
of the campus as representa
tive of this university. Those of
us who seek this ideal are a
minority and will remain so as
long as the fraternities prevail.
The sheer number of these
people is evidence enough.
But there is one refreshing
thing about this, my last year
here, and that is Dave Harris.
For once, sensible alternatives to
education are offered, alterna
tives which were last heard in
the days of Rosencranz and
Woolsey. 808 IVARIE

Editor, The Daily:
Regarding "Fort Worth Moth

er's" depiction of the Stanford
influence:
She speaks of her "socialist'
clod" son, who spouts "radicr'
nonsense" in an effort "to bo r
carbon copy of Dave Haris."
She compares him to her dauch
ter, who is "thrilled with wh?'
she is learning" at George Wash
ington University.
It is unfortunate that she
condemns her son for being "a
carbon copy Dave Harris,"
which is dangerous only insofar
as trying to be a carbon copy of
anyone is often an inauthentic
answer to one's problem of
identity.
But one thing she says rings
true. Where indeed in the Stan
ford community is that love of
learning she claims her daugh
ter has and her son has lost?
In high school, adolescent social
pressures condemn the "egg
head" and the "brain." At Stan
ford the situation is worse.
Getting good grades is all right
(A fella has to get into grad
school, doesn't he?) Taking a
lively interest in a class is taboo.
Actually deriving pleasure from
research and problem solving is
unadmittable.
How does the turkey syndrome
come about? Why should a
healthy interest in learning (as
opposed to roosting-in-the-coop
grade-grubbing) be condemned?
