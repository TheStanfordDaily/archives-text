# Ein 						Jahr In Berlin Umsonst?
## 
### 
A year In Berlin? Free? So
the lIR advertises.
How? The ASSU exchange pro
gram to the Free University of
Berlin.
Under the program, one Ger
man student from the FU
comes each year to Stanford with
a scholarship from the ASSU,
while a Stanford student goes
to Berlin on a similar scholarship
provided by the student organiza
tion at the FU.
Currently at Stanford Is Uwe
Nagel, while Valerie Olander Is
attending the Free University.
The lIR Is accepting applicants
for next year's program now. All
students are eligible to apply, al
though fluency In German Is es
sential. Interested persons should
drop by the lIR office In Trcsld
der and pick up applications.
