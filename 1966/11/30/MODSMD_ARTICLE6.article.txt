"We don't have funds for our con
tinued over-production of guns and for
domestic programs for the 32 million
people who by very conservative gov
ernment standards live in poverty in
this country," Detroit's Democratic
Congressman John Conyers told stu
dents in a discussion in the Donner
Lounge last night.
Conyers, a Negro and Stern Hall's
guest-in-residence, attacked the no
tions of what he called "the guns-and
butter nuts" who believe that the na
tion can sustain escalation of the
Vietnam conflict as well as anti
poverty programs. 'Our foreign
policy," Conyers said in reference to
Vietnam, "has blinded us and led us
down the most dangerous road any
one has ever followed."
The Michigan Democrat stated that
he has "consistently opposed any de
velopment of the war in Southeast
Asia." He said he found arguing
against the war on economic grounds
was most convincing. According to the
Congressman, taxes will have to be
raised to support the Vietnam war,
which now officially costs about $30
billion a year.

The Congressman hopes that grow
ing dissent in the Democratic Party
and in the nation will convince Ad
ministration leaders to spend less
money in Vietnam and more in Ameri
can poverty areas. The President, Con
yers said, would understand the threat
of not being re-elected in 1968.
"The Poverty Program," Conyers
said in other comments, "as I have
seen it is a welfare program with all
the detriments of every welfare pro
gram ever devised." The attack on
proverty is "too light and too oc
casional," according to Conyers.
