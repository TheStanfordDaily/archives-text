# JUDICIAL SYSTEM FLAWS
## Conflicts Mar Council's 'Educative' Role 
### GAIL ANDERSON (Last in a Series) 
The first article in this series sug
gested that examination of Stanford's
judicial structure might necessitate a
call for re-evaluation.
With the facts and opinions sur
rounding the system in mind, two
questions seem germane.
What should be the purposes of the
judicial system?
Is the system presently fulfilling
those purposes?
The judicial structure should first
of all exercise responsibility and sec
ondly aid in clarification of the judi
cial process.
Its responsibility should be twofold,
according to Judicial Council member
Fred Poorbaugh — responsibility to
the defendant and responsibility to
the community.
The three elements of the Univer
sity community agree that the system

should perform an educative function
to the individual.
Judicial Council chairman Mimi
Sherman maintains: "A major prob
lem is how to get away from a strictly
punitive setup. A few years ago the
council began to shift to an educative
influence."
Individual Differences
"Our purpose should be educative
and rehabilitative, taking individual
differences into consideration," adds
Fred Poorbaugh.
Joel Kugelmass cites Council recom
mendations which prescribe writing
papers, taking seminars and working
in the Con Home rather than merely
punitive measures.
Professor Robert Horn of the IJB
notes "The spirit of discipline should
be rehabilitative, not punitive."
Dean Robert Gordon says,"The
function should be to treat the indi
vidual, not the incident."

Dean Robert Hind adds, "There
should be no attempt to be punitive.
We're not here to destroy people who
are having difficulties but to help
them out of their difficulties."
It is probably safe to say this opi
nion is unanimous.
There can be no question, then, that
if this function is not being fulfilled,
some restructuring or re-evaluation of
the system is necessary.
Rang« of Sentences
Yet the range of sentences which
the Judicial Council can recommend
— from "formal warning" to expul
sion — is not structured so as to be
educative in nature. Those which can
properly be termed penalties at all are
strictly punitive.
Kugelmass termed the range of sen
tences "absurb," and expressed incre
dulity at the fact that the Council was
expected to perform an educative
function with such limited tools.

While it is true that the present
Council is attempting to remedy the
problem by prescribing nonpunitive
sentences, such action is a function
of this particular council and not of
the system itself. The actual structure
of the system makes no attempt to
come to terms with the problem of
educative action.
If there is a general consensus
about the proper role of the Council
to the defendant, there is a definite
conflict as to the posture of the Coun
cil toward the community.
Does the Council's public responsi
bility involve a duty to inform the
community of what is going on in the
system?
This specifically is the question of
publicity vs. secrecy concerning judi
cial proceedings.
Secrecy
The present system works on the
basis of secrecy. Neither cases nor
decisions are made public. Some judi
cial council members agree with this
principle. Others prefer the present
system, and they apparently predomi
nate.
The usual argument given to de
fend the system is protection of the
defendant. Yet as one Council member
notes, this is not the reason given in
defining the Council's role toward the

individual and so seems out of place;
in the second place it assumes that
this supposed duty must always take
precedence over public responsibility.
In the third place it assumes names
would be publicized, thus causing em
barrassment to the defendant; it does
not explain why all facts about cases,
proceedings and verdicts are kept
secret.
The difficulty is in defining public
responsibility, and the lack of con
sensus does not help the system reach
its goals.
The second purpose of clarification
is obscured by the issues of student
administrative conflict. This conflict
tends to keep issues clouded because
each side, in attempting to present
its case most strongly, refuses to com
promise or to get together and clear
up isues.
A Point of Conflict.
One point of conflict is the fact
that anything can happen to a Judi
cial Council decision, although Dean
Donald Winbigler discounts the im
portance of this.
"The Judicial Council,"he says,
"has a tremendous power to influence
administrative decisions. The fact that
its power is not ultimate does nof
limits its influence."
"While practically speaking
this may be true," commented
ASSU Vice-President Mike Col
lins, "the psychological effect
the Council's limitation has on
student attitudes creates a de
fensive attitude toward the ad
ministration."
There is also the disagree
ment over the nature of stu
dent government. The students
maintain this concept implies
independence.
"The trouble is that the stu
dent judiciary is grafted onto
a system of nonstudent rules,"
says LASSU Speaker Tom For
stenzer.
"That's a rather meaningless
cliche to mo," rebutts Winbigler.
"The Judicial Council is expect
ed to enforce University regu
lations, but often there is stu
dent participation in making
these rules. The social regula
tions, for example, were drafted
by the AWS."

The question — perhaps an in
soluble one — is whether the
student judicial system must be
autonomous in order to be effec
tive.
If the question is indeed in
soluble — if complete autonomy
is impossible and the student
judicial system must operate
under the "underlying norms of
two different communities,"
what will be the resultant con
fusion and conflict?
Area of Jurisdiction
One basis for confusion is the
area of jurisdiction.
Several problems occur here.
First, it is the Dean of Students
who decides whether an inci
dent is to be considered a "case."
This gives the administration a
hand in the jurisdiction of the
Judicial Council.
There is conflict between the
Interfraternity system and the
Judicial Council. The Phi Delt
case is an example in which the
Council felt it should have had

jurisdiction but was not given
the opportunity.
Another difficulty is the rela
tion of overseas campus judicial
systems to the on-campus struc
ture. The question of appeal is
unresolved. The Overseas Cam
pus office says appeals after the
session is over go to Winbigler.
He says they go to the Judicial
Council. The IJB setup provides
that it goes to them.
A second area of confusion
concerns the basis for enforce
ment — the Fundamental Stand
ard.
"The Judicial Council,"says
chairman Mimi Sherman, "is es
sentially constituted as a moral
sanctioning body — a role which
I fmd really repugnant."
The fact that the Judicial
Council is based on enforcement
of the Fundamental Standard
leads to a conflict over the ques
tion of precedent and codifica
tion. Council members are split
on the issues.
The present system is ambigu
ous as to what violations merit
what penalties.
But if the Fundamental Stand
ard were codified, individual dif
ferences would be neglected in
favor of legalism and a punitive
system.

Out of this confusion rises the
question: is it the act or the
attitude that is being punished?
Noneodified
The present noneodified sys
tem would seem to indicate the
latter — consideration of the in
dividual, as the Council mem
bers advocate.
But Miss Sherman's position
in the Delt case indicates a be
lief that it is the act itself
which is being punished — not

the individual attitude.
There seems to be a conflict
of theory and practice.
If the purpose of the judicial
structure is rehabilitation rather
than punishment, education
rather than secrecy, clarity rath
er than conflict, then it is indeed
negating its purposes.
Judicial "competence" is not
enough. There must be such a
thing as judicial purpose, judi
cial direction, and most of all
judicial responsibility.

those purposes?
The judicial structure should first
of all exercise responsibility and sec
ondly aid in clarification of the judi
cial process.
Its responsibility should be twofold,
according to Judicial Council member
Fred Poorbaugh — responsibility to
the defendant and responsibility to
the community.
The three elements of the Univer
sity community agree that the system

should perform an educative function
to the individual.
Judicial Council chairman Mimi
Sherman maintains: "A major prob
lem is how to get away from a strictly
punitive setup. A few years ago the
council began to shift to an educative
influence."
Individual Differences
"Our purpose should be educative
and rehabilitative, taking individual
differences into consideration," adds
Fred Poorbaugh.
Joel Kugelmass cites Council recom
mendations which prescribe writing
papers, taking seminars and working
in the Con Home rather than merely
punitive measures.
Professor Robert Horn of the IJB
notes "The spirit of discipline should
be rehabilitative, not punitive."
Dean Robert Gordon says,"The
function should be to treat the indi
vidual, not the incident."

Dean Robert Hind adds, "There
should be no attempt to be punitive.
We're not here to destroy people who
are having difficulties but to help
them out of their difficulties."
It is probably safe to say this opi
nion is unanimous.
There can be no question, then, that
if this function is not being fulfilled,
some restructuring or re-evaluation of
the system is necessary.
Rang« of Sentences
Yet the range of sentences which
the Judicial Council can recommend
— from "formal warning" to expul
sion — is not structured so as to be
educative in nature. Those which can
properly be termed penalties at all are
strictly punitive.
Kugelmass termed the range of sen
tences "absurb," and expressed incre
dulity at the fact that the Council was
expected to perform an educative
function with such limited tools.

While it is true that the present
Council is attempting to remedy the
problem by prescribing nonpunitive
sentences, such action is a function
of this particular council and not of
the system itself. The actual structure
of the system makes no attempt to
come to terms with the problem of
educative action.
If there is a general consensus
about the proper role of the Council
to the defendant, there is a definite
conflict as to the posture of the Coun
cil toward the community.
Does the Council's public responsi
bility involve a duty to inform the
community of what is going on in the
system?
This specifically is the question of
publicity vs. secrecy concerning judi
cial proceedings.
Secrecy
The present system works on the
basis of secrecy. Neither cases nor
decisions are made public. Some judi
cial council members agree with this
principle. Others prefer the present
system, and they apparently predomi
nate.
The usual argument given to de
fend the system is protection of the
defendant. Yet as one Council member
notes, this is not the reason given in
defining the Council's role toward the

individual and so seems out of place;
in the second place it assumes that
this supposed duty must always take
precedence over public responsibility.
In the third place it assumes names
would be publicized, thus causing em
barrassment to the defendant; it does
not explain why all facts about cases,
proceedings and verdicts are kept
secret.
The difficulty is in defining public
responsibility, and the lack of con
sensus does not help the system reach
its goals.
The second purpose of clarification
is obscured by the issues of student
administrative conflict. This conflict
tends to keep issues clouded because
each side, in attempting to present
its case most strongly, refuses to com
promise or to get together and clear
up isues.
A Point of Conflict.
One point of conflict is the fact
that anything can happen to a Judi
cial Council decision, although Dean
Donald Winbigler discounts the im
portance of this.
"The Judicial Council,"he says,
"has a tremendous power to influence
administrative decisions. The fact that
its power is not ultimate does nof
limits its influence."
"While practically speaking
this may be true," commented
ASSU Vice-President Mike Col
lins, "the psychological effect
the Council's limitation has on
student attitudes creates a de
fensive attitude toward the ad
ministration."
There is also the disagree
ment over the nature of stu
dent government. The students
maintain this concept implies
independence.
"The trouble is that the stu
dent judiciary is grafted onto
a system of nonstudent rules,"
says LASSU Speaker Tom For
stenzer.
"That's a rather meaningless
cliche to mo," rebutts Winbigler.
"The Judicial Council is expect
ed to enforce University regu
lations, but often there is stu
dent participation in making
these rules. The social regula
tions, for example, were drafted
by the AWS."

The question — perhaps an in
soluble one — is whether the
student judicial system must be
autonomous in order to be effec
tive.
If the question is indeed in
soluble — if complete autonomy
is impossible and the student
judicial system must operate
under the "underlying norms of
two different communities,"
what will be the resultant con
fusion and conflict?
Area of Jurisdiction
One basis for confusion is the
area of jurisdiction.
Several problems occur here.
First, it is the Dean of Students
who decides whether an inci
dent is to be considered a "case."
This gives the administration a
hand in the jurisdiction of the
Judicial Council.
There is conflict between the
Interfraternity system and the
Judicial Council. The Phi Delt
case is an example in which the
Council felt it should have had

jurisdiction but was not given
the opportunity.
Another difficulty is the rela
tion of overseas campus judicial
systems to the on-campus struc
ture. The question of appeal is
unresolved. The Overseas Cam
pus office says appeals after the
session is over go to Winbigler.
He says they go to the Judicial
Council. The IJB setup provides
that it goes to them.
A second area of confusion
concerns the basis for enforce
ment — the Fundamental Stand
ard.
"The Judicial Council,"says
chairman Mimi Sherman, "is es
sentially constituted as a moral
sanctioning body — a role which
I fmd really repugnant."
The fact that the Judicial
Council is based on enforcement
of the Fundamental Standard
leads to a conflict over the ques
tion of precedent and codifica
tion. Council members are split
on the issues.
The present system is ambigu
ous as to what violations merit
what penalties.
But if the Fundamental Stand
ard were codified, individual dif
ferences would be neglected in
favor of legalism and a punitive
system.

Out of this confusion rises the
question: is it the act or the
attitude that is being punished?
Noneodified
The present noneodified sys
tem would seem to indicate the
latter — consideration of the in
dividual, as the Council mem
bers advocate.
But Miss Sherman's position
in the Delt case indicates a be
lief that it is the act itself
which is being punished — not

the individual attitude.
There seems to be a conflict
of theory and practice.
If the purpose of the judicial
structure is rehabilitation rather
than punishment, education
rather than secrecy, clarity rath
er than conflict, then it is indeed
negating its purposes.
Judicial "competence" is not
enough. There must be such a
thing as judicial purpose, judi
cial direction, and most of all
judicial responsibility.
The first article in this series sug
gested that examination of Stanford's
judicial structure might necessitate a
call for re-evaluation.
With the facts and opinions sur
rounding the system in mind, two
questions seem germane.
What should be the purposes of the
judicial system?

Judicial Council chairman Mimi
Sherman maintains: "A major prob
lem is how to get away from a strictly
punitive setup. A few years ago the
council began to shift to an educative
influence."
Individual Differences
"Our purpose should be educative
and rehabilitative, taking individual
differences into consideration," adds
Fred Poorbaugh.
Joel Kugelmass cites Council recom
mendations which prescribe writing
papers, taking seminars and working
in the Con Home rather than merely
punitive measures.
Professor Robert Horn of the IJB
notes "The spirit of discipline should
be rehabilitative, not punitive."
Dean Robert Gordon says,"The
function should be to treat the indi
vidual, not the incident."

Dean Robert Hind adds, "There
should be no attempt to be punitive.
We're not here to destroy people who
are having difficulties but to help
them out of their difficulties."
It is probably safe to say this opi
nion is unanimous.
There can be no question, then, that
if this function is not being fulfilled,
some restructuring or re-evaluation of
the system is necessary.
Rang« of Sentences
Yet the range of sentences which
the Judicial Council can recommend
— from "formal warning" to expul
sion — is not structured so as to be
educative in nature. Those which can
properly be termed penalties at all are
strictly punitive.
Kugelmass termed the range of sen
tences "absurb," and expressed incre
dulity at the fact that the Council was
expected to perform an educative
function with such limited tools.

While it is true that the present
Council is attempting to remedy the
problem by prescribing nonpunitive
sentences, such action is a function
of this particular council and not of
the system itself. The actual structure
of the system makes no attempt to
come to terms with the problem of
educative action.
If there is a general consensus
about the proper role of the Council
to the defendant, there is a definite
conflict as to the posture of the Coun
cil toward the community.
Does the Council's public responsi
bility involve a duty to inform the
community of what is going on in the
system?
This specifically is the question of
publicity vs. secrecy concerning judi
cial proceedings.
Secrecy
The present system works on the
basis of secrecy. Neither cases nor
decisions are made public. Some judi
cial council members agree with this
principle. Others prefer the present
system, and they apparently predomi
nate.
The usual argument given to de
fend the system is protection of the
defendant. Yet as one Council member
notes, this is not the reason given in
defining the Council's role toward the

individual and so seems out of place;
in the second place it assumes that
this supposed duty must always take
precedence over public responsibility.
In the third place it assumes names
would be publicized, thus causing em
barrassment to the defendant; it does
not explain why all facts about cases,
proceedings and verdicts are kept
secret.
The difficulty is in defining public
responsibility, and the lack of con
sensus does not help the system reach
its goals.
The second purpose of clarification
is obscured by the issues of student
administrative conflict. This conflict
tends to keep issues clouded because
each side, in attempting to present
its case most strongly, refuses to com
promise or to get together and clear
up isues.
A Point of Conflict.
One point of conflict is the fact
that anything can happen to a Judi
cial Council decision, although Dean
Donald Winbigler discounts the im
portance of this.
"The Judicial Council,"he says,
"has a tremendous power to influence
administrative decisions. The fact that
its power is not ultimate does nof
limits its influence."
The first article in this series sug
gested that examination of Stanford's
judicial structure might necessitate a
call for re-evaluation.
With the facts and opinions sur
rounding the system in mind, two
questions seem germane.
What should be the purposes of the
judicial system?
Is the system presently fulfilling
those purposes?
The judicial structure should first
of all exercise responsibility and sec
ondly aid in clarification of the judi
cial process.
Its responsibility should be twofold,
according to Judicial Council member
Fred Poorbaugh — responsibility to
the defendant and responsibility to
the community.
The three elements of the Univer
sity community agree that the system

should perform an educative function
to the individual.
Judicial Council chairman Mimi
Sherman maintains: "A major prob
lem is how to get away from a strictly
punitive setup. A few years ago the
council began to shift to an educative
influence."

One point of conflict is the fact
that anything can happen to a Judi
cial Council decision, although Dean
Donald Winbigler discounts the im
portance of this.
"The Judicial Council,"he says,
"has a tremendous power to influence
administrative decisions. The fact that
its power is not ultimate does nof
limits its influence."
"While practically speaking
this may be true," commented
ASSU Vice-President Mike Col
lins, "the psychological effect
the Council's limitation has on
student attitudes creates a de
fensive attitude toward the ad
ministration."
There is also the disagree
ment over the nature of stu
dent government. The students
maintain this concept implies
independence.
"The trouble is that the stu
dent judiciary is grafted onto
a system of nonstudent rules,"
says LASSU Speaker Tom For
stenzer.
"That's a rather meaningless
cliche to mo," rebutts Winbigler.
"The Judicial Council is expect
ed to enforce University regu
lations, but often there is stu
dent participation in making
these rules. The social regula
tions, for example, were drafted
by the AWS."

The question — perhaps an in
soluble one — is whether the
student judicial system must be
autonomous in order to be effec
tive.
If the question is indeed in
soluble — if complete autonomy
is impossible and the student
judicial system must operate
under the "underlying norms of
two different communities,"
what will be the resultant con
fusion and conflict?
Area of Jurisdiction
One basis for confusion is the
area of jurisdiction.
Several problems occur here.
First, it is the Dean of Students
who decides whether an inci
dent is to be considered a "case."
This gives the administration a
hand in the jurisdiction of the
Judicial Council.
There is conflict between the
Interfraternity system and the
Judicial Council. The Phi Delt
case is an example in which the
Council felt it should have had

jurisdiction but was not given
the opportunity.
Another difficulty is the rela
tion of overseas campus judicial
systems to the on-campus struc
ture. The question of appeal is
unresolved. The Overseas Cam
pus office says appeals after the
session is over go to Winbigler.
He says they go to the Judicial
Council. The IJB setup provides
that it goes to them.
A second area of confusion
concerns the basis for enforce
ment — the Fundamental Stand
ard.
"The Judicial Council,"says
chairman Mimi Sherman, "is es
sentially constituted as a moral
sanctioning body — a role which
I fmd really repugnant."
The fact that the Judicial
Council is based on enforcement
of the Fundamental Standard
leads to a conflict over the ques
tion of precedent and codifica
tion. Council members are split
on the issues.
The present system is ambigu
ous as to what violations merit
what penalties.
But if the Fundamental Stand
ard were codified, individual dif
ferences would be neglected in
favor of legalism and a punitive
system.

Out of this confusion rises the
question: is it the act or the
attitude that is being punished?
Noneodified
The present noneodified sys
tem would seem to indicate the
latter — consideration of the in
dividual, as the Council mem
bers advocate.
But Miss Sherman's position
in the Delt case indicates a be
lief that it is the act itself
which is being punished — not

the individual attitude.
There seems to be a conflict
of theory and practice.
If the purpose of the judicial
structure is rehabilitation rather
than punishment, education
rather than secrecy, clarity rath
er than conflict, then it is indeed
negating its purposes.
Judicial "competence" is not
enough. There must be such a
thing as judicial purpose, judi
cial direction, and most of all
judicial responsibility.
"While practically speaking
this may be true," commented
ASSU Vice-President Mike Col
lins, "the psychological effect
the Council's limitation has on

papers, taking seminars and working
in the Con Home rather than merely
punitive measures.
Professor Robert Horn of the IJB
notes "The spirit of discipline should
be rehabilitative, not punitive."
Dean Robert Gordon says,"The
function should be to treat the indi
vidual, not the incident."

Dean Robert Hind adds, "There
should be no attempt to be punitive.
We're not here to destroy people who
are having difficulties but to help
them out of their difficulties."
It is probably safe to say this opi
nion is unanimous.
There can be no question, then, that
if this function is not being fulfilled,
some restructuring or re-evaluation of
the system is necessary.
Rang« of Sentences
Yet the range of sentences which
the Judicial Council can recommend
— from "formal warning" to expul
sion — is not structured so as to be
educative in nature. Those which can
properly be termed penalties at all are
strictly punitive.
Kugelmass termed the range of sen
tences "absurb," and expressed incre
dulity at the fact that the Council was
expected to perform an educative
function with such limited tools.

While it is true that the present
Council is attempting to remedy the
problem by prescribing nonpunitive
sentences, such action is a function
of this particular council and not of
the system itself. The actual structure
of the system makes no attempt to
come to terms with the problem of
educative action.
If there is a general consensus
about the proper role of the Council
to the defendant, there is a definite
conflict as to the posture of the Coun
cil toward the community.
Does the Council's public responsi
bility involve a duty to inform the
community of what is going on in the
system?
This specifically is the question of
publicity vs. secrecy concerning judi
cial proceedings.
Secrecy
The present system works on the
basis of secrecy. Neither cases nor
decisions are made public. Some judi
cial council members agree with this
principle. Others prefer the present
system, and they apparently predomi
nate.
The usual argument given to de
fend the system is protection of the
defendant. Yet as one Council member
notes, this is not the reason given in
defining the Council's role toward the

individual and so seems out of place;
in the second place it assumes that
this supposed duty must always take
precedence over public responsibility.
In the third place it assumes names
would be publicized, thus causing em
barrassment to the defendant; it does
not explain why all facts about cases,
proceedings and verdicts are kept
secret.
The difficulty is in defining public
responsibility, and the lack of con
sensus does not help the system reach
its goals.
The second purpose of clarification
is obscured by the issues of student
administrative conflict. This conflict
tends to keep issues clouded because
each side, in attempting to present
its case most strongly, refuses to com
promise or to get together and clear
up isues.
A Point of Conflict.
One point of conflict is the fact
that anything can happen to a Judi
cial Council decision, although Dean
Donald Winbigler discounts the im
portance of this.
"The Judicial Council,"he says,
"has a tremendous power to influence
administrative decisions. The fact that
its power is not ultimate does nof
limits its influence."
"While practically speaking
this may be true," commented
ASSU Vice-President Mike Col
lins, "the psychological effect
the Council's limitation has on
student attitudes creates a de
fensive attitude toward the ad
ministration."
There is also the disagree
ment over the nature of stu
dent government. The students
maintain this concept implies
independence.
"The trouble is that the stu
dent judiciary is grafted onto
a system of nonstudent rules,"
says LASSU Speaker Tom For
stenzer.
"That's a rather meaningless
cliche to mo," rebutts Winbigler.
"The Judicial Council is expect
ed to enforce University regu
lations, but often there is stu
dent participation in making
these rules. The social regula
tions, for example, were drafted
by the AWS."

The question — perhaps an in
soluble one — is whether the
student judicial system must be
autonomous in order to be effec
tive.
If the question is indeed in
soluble — if complete autonomy
is impossible and the student
judicial system must operate
under the "underlying norms of
two different communities,"
what will be the resultant con
fusion and conflict?
Area of Jurisdiction
One basis for confusion is the
area of jurisdiction.
Several problems occur here.
First, it is the Dean of Students
who decides whether an inci
dent is to be considered a "case."
This gives the administration a
hand in the jurisdiction of the
Judicial Council.
There is conflict between the
Interfraternity system and the
Judicial Council. The Phi Delt
case is an example in which the
Council felt it should have had

jurisdiction but was not given
the opportunity.
Another difficulty is the rela
tion of overseas campus judicial
systems to the on-campus struc
ture. The question of appeal is
unresolved. The Overseas Cam
pus office says appeals after the
session is over go to Winbigler.
He says they go to the Judicial
Council. The IJB setup provides
that it goes to them.
A second area of confusion
concerns the basis for enforce
ment — the Fundamental Stand
ard.
"The Judicial Council,"says
chairman Mimi Sherman, "is es
sentially constituted as a moral
sanctioning body — a role which
I fmd really repugnant."
The fact that the Judicial
Council is based on enforcement
of the Fundamental Standard
leads to a conflict over the ques
tion of precedent and codifica
tion. Council members are split
on the issues.
The present system is ambigu
ous as to what violations merit
what penalties.
But if the Fundamental Stand
ard were codified, individual dif
ferences would be neglected in
favor of legalism and a punitive
system.

Out of this confusion rises the
question: is it the act or the
attitude that is being punished?
Noneodified
The present noneodified sys
tem would seem to indicate the
latter — consideration of the in
dividual, as the Council mem
bers advocate.
But Miss Sherman's position
in the Delt case indicates a be
lief that it is the act itself
which is being punished — not

the individual attitude.
There seems to be a conflict
of theory and practice.
If the purpose of the judicial
structure is rehabilitation rather
than punishment, education
rather than secrecy, clarity rath
er than conflict, then it is indeed
negating its purposes.
Judicial "competence" is not
enough. There must be such a
thing as judicial purpose, judi
cial direction, and most of all
judicial responsibility.
The first article in this series sug
gested that examination of Stanford's
judicial structure might necessitate a
call for re-evaluation.
With the facts and opinions sur
rounding the system in mind, two
questions seem germane.
What should be the purposes of the
judicial system?
Is the system presently fulfilling
those purposes?
The judicial structure should first
of all exercise responsibility and sec
ondly aid in clarification of the judi
cial process.
Its responsibility should be twofold,
according to Judicial Council member
Fred Poorbaugh — responsibility to
the defendant and responsibility to
the community.
The three elements of the Univer
sity community agree that the system

should perform an educative function
to the individual.
Judicial Council chairman Mimi
Sherman maintains: "A major prob
lem is how to get away from a strictly
punitive setup. A few years ago the
council began to shift to an educative
influence."
Individual Differences
"Our purpose should be educative
and rehabilitative, taking individual
differences into consideration," adds
Fred Poorbaugh.
Joel Kugelmass cites Council recom
mendations which prescribe writing
papers, taking seminars and working
in the Con Home rather than merely
punitive measures.
Professor Robert Horn of the IJB
notes "The spirit of discipline should
be rehabilitative, not punitive."

vidual, not the incident."
