# JUDICIAL SYSTEM FLAWS
## Conflicts Mar Council's 'Educative' Role 
### GAIL ANDERSON (Last in a Series) 
The first article in this series sug
gested that examination of Stanford's
judicial structure might necessitate a
call for re-evaluation.
With the facts and opinions sur
rounding the system in mind, two
questions seem germane.
What should be the purposes of the
judicial system?
Is the system presently fulfilling
those purposes?
The judicial structure should first
of all exercise responsibility and sec
ondly aid in clarification of the judi
cial process.
Its responsibility should be twofold,
according to Judicial Council member
Fred Poorbaugh — responsibility to
the defendant and responsibility to
the community.
The three elements of the Univer
sity community agree that the system

should perform an educative function
to the individual.
Judicial Council chairman Mimi
Sherman maintains: "A major prob
lem is how to get away from a strictly
punitive setup. A few years ago the
council began to shift to an educative
influence."
Individual Differences
"Our purpose should be educative
and rehabilitative, taking individual
differences into consideration," adds
Fred Poorbaugh.
Joel Kugelmass cites Council recom
mendations which prescribe writing
papers, taking seminars and working
in the Con Home rather than merely
punitive measures.
Professor Robert Horn of the IJB
notes "The spirit of discipline should
be rehabilitative, not punitive."
Dean Robert Gordon says,"The
function should be to treat the indi
vidual, not the incident."

Dean Robert Hind adds, "There
should be no attempt to be punitive.
We're not here to destroy people who
are having difficulties but to help
them out of their difficulties."
It is probably safe to say this opi
nion is unanimous.
There can be no question, then, that
if this function is not being fulfilled,
some restructuring or re-evaluation of
the system is necessary.
Rang« of Sentences
Yet the range of sentences which
the Judicial Council can recommend
— from "formal warning" to expul
sion — is not structured so as to be
educative in nature. Those which can
properly be termed penalties at all are
strictly punitive.
Kugelmass termed the range of sen
tences "absurb," and expressed incre
dulity at the fact that the Council was
expected to perform an educative
function with such limited tools.

While it is true that the present
Council is attempting to remedy the
problem by prescribing nonpunitive
sentences, such action is a function
of this particular council and not of
the system itself. The actual structure
of the system makes no attempt to
come to terms with the problem of
educative action.
If there is a general consensus
about the proper role of the Council
to the defendant, there is a definite
conflict as to the posture of the Coun
cil toward the community.
Does the Council's public responsi
bility involve a duty to inform the
community of what is going on in the
system?
This specifically is the question of
publicity vs. secrecy concerning judi
cial proceedings.
Secrecy
The present system works on the
basis of secrecy. Neither cases nor
decisions are made public. Some judi
cial council members agree with this
principle. Others prefer the present
system, and they apparently predomi
nate.
The usual argument given to de
fend the system is protection of the
defendant. Yet as one Council member
notes, this is not the reason given in
defining the Council's role toward the

individual and so seems out of place;
in the second place it assumes that
this supposed duty must always take
precedence over public responsibility.
In the third place it assumes names
would be publicized, thus causing em
barrassment to the defendant; it does
not explain why all facts about cases,
proceedings and verdicts are kept
secret.
The difficulty is in defining public
responsibility, and the lack of con
sensus does not help the system reach
its goals.
The second purpose of clarification
is obscured by the issues of student
administrative conflict. This conflict
tends to keep issues clouded because
each side, in attempting to present
its case most strongly, refuses to com
promise or to get together and clear
up isues.
A Point of Conflict.
One point of conflict is the fact
that anything can happen to a Judi
cial Council decision, although Dean
Donald Winbigler discounts the im
portance of this.
"The Judicial Council,"he says,
"has a tremendous power to influence
administrative decisions. The fact that
its power is not ultimate does nof
limits its influence."
