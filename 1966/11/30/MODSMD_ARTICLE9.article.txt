# Lytton Exhibit At Museum
## 
### 
The exhibit of "Contemporary Cali
fornia Art from the Lytton Collection"
is being held over at the Stanford
Museum until December 28. From
here, the works of painting and
sculpture move onto other museums
and galleries throughout the country.
Bart Lytton, president of Lytton
Savings and Loan and the man most
responsible for and enthusiastic about
his corporation's collection, was on
campus last night to take part in a
panel discussion on the satisfactions
of collecting.
Lytton, a dynamic and idealistic
businessman and patron of the arts,
dominated the discussion. He and five
Bay Area collectors approached col

lecting from psychological, historical,
corporate and individual viewpoints,
Lytton denied that he was a "col
lector," and preferred to say he was
a "user" of art. "I have a passionate
wish to get away from the narrow
confines of 'collecting,'" he said. He
expressed a practical view of art
acquisition, considering both purpose
and price.
"I buy art to adorn the surround
ings of Lytton Savings, and only if
it is a 'good buy.' Cezanne might have
snob appeal," he noted, "but one
wouldn't cover the wall."
On the other hand, most of the
other panelists believed no price too
great for one piece of art if it
moved the collector.
