# 'Experiment' To Offer Additional Seminars
## 
### CHRISTOPHER HARGROVE 
The Experiment, a new student
group devoted to exploring new ap
proaches to education, will conduct
registration for its winter quarter
seminars next Monday, Tuesday and
Wednesday from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
In the former Western Civilization
Library. The quarterly membership
fee is $10. Thirty-two seminars are
being offered.
After one quarter of operation, the
Experiment is moving along quite
well. This optimistic appraisal by the
principal founder and mover, Barry
Greenberg, is based on the enthusias
tic support of the participants and
the quiet encouragement of a number
of faculty members.
The purpose of the Experiment as
seen by its founders and members, Ls
to fill a gap in the education of Stan
ford students. It offers seminars and
projects on a variety of subjects not
offered by the university, and it treats
them as they relate to the individual
student, not as cold and impersonal
bodies of fact and abstraction.
17 New Seminars
The initial success of the Experi
ment is reflected in the fact that the
number of seminars has jumped for
next quarter from 19 to 32. Four old
ones are being dropped and 17 new
ones added. A' complete list with de
scriptions will be available Monday
in the Experiment's winter quarter
catalogue. •

Greenberg points out that the Ex
periment is still just that, but he is
encouraged by the response. The larg
est percentage of members, he says,
could not be construed as activists in
the popular sense. They are merely
students who are "just becoming
aware of themselves as individuals,
and beginning to ask the purposive
questions." The Experiment wants to
return to the Socratic maxim "Know
thyself," and to relate "essence to
existence.
Stifling Stanford
Most of the members, Greenberg
suspects, are people who have had a
taste of the real world (for example
on a trip to Europe) and returned to
find Stanford's atmospHlre stifling
and artificial. They are decidedly- not
people who are satisfied with their
lot.
The seminars range from the di
rectly creative workshops (e.g. sculp
ture or film-making) to discussions of
basic questions (e.g. the psychedelic
experience) to political seminars on
such things as Black Power.
Some students find they can get
directed reading credit for Experi
ment seminars. Greenberg states,
however, that ideally a student should
sign up for the Experiment not for
credit but because he just wants to:
Competition from the regular Stan
ford curriculum sometimes gets
heavy. If a student has a midterm to
study for or a paper to complete, he

is inclined to skip that evening's Ex
periment seminar. Toward the end of
the quarter, attendance is expected to
drop even more. This is unavoidable,
says Greenberg, with today's pres
sures to get high grades.
In the meantime, the Experiment
continues to grow. Among the 17 new
seminars to be offered next quarter
are "Technology and Human Values,"
to be taught by Engineering Profes
sor George Leppert, "City Planning,"
"The New Radicals" and "Gestalt Psy
chology and Therapy."
The Experiment will also print a
newsletter for all its members, and
the newspaper Commitment will con
tinue to be published on a regular
basis.
Some of the seminars become more
like research projects. For example,
one group this quarter worked to
draw up a plan of incorporation for
East Palo Alto. Another has delved
into the Kennedy assassination and
hopes to have its findings published
nationally.
For next quarter Greenberg en
visions hostels and extended week
ends to supplement the once-a-week
seminars.
Greenberg emphasizes that the Ex
periment's long-range success is not
yet by any means assured. In fact,
he says that even a definition of suc
cess would have to be held in abey
ance. What if, for example, the uni
versity decided it liked the idea of

the Experiment and adopted the semi
nars as part of the regular curricu
lum? Would this be success? Green
berg considers the posibility very un
likely as, he says, the difference of
approach between the university and
the Experiment is quite fundamental.
It involves questions not just of the
techniques of teaching but of the very
purposes.
Over 200 Enrolled
Success might be measured by the
Experiment's enrollment/ Last quar
ter 275 students signed up. Of those,
190 paid their $10 registration fee and
about 220 attended the seminars. Next
quarter, the last two figures will be
expected to coincide. Greenberg says
the Experiment can't afford to allow
students who wor\'t pay. In any case,
he hopes that the enrollment will
eventually reach 300 and stay some
where near there.
Although the Experiment has the
support of some faculty members, it
is still basically a student organiza
tion. The seminar leaders are mostly
graduate students who come up with
their own ideas for seminar topics.
Professors would be welcome, Green
berg says, but he attributes their re
ticence to several things: many of
them have heavy work loads already;
many of them are reluctant to come
all out behind a student effort that
might fall on its face nejrt year; many
of them disagree with the founding
premises of the Experiment and think

that the Stanford educational system
is all right the way it is; and many
of them simply don't care.
One of the Experiment's main prob
lems is its lack of cohesion. Though
there is certainly no lack of communi
cation among the members of any
particular seminar, there is a gap
from one seminar to another. They
meet in private homes often, and at
various times. Greenberg is hopeful
that the new location in the old West
ern Civ library can become a meeting
place, a common territory for all the
Experiment's members. Many of the
seminars are expected to meet there
eventually.
Reaction to Modem Education
On a philosophical level, the Ex
periment is *a reaction against mod
ern education. The system as practic
ed at Stanford (and most other such
institutions in this country) is dedi
cated to the ingestion of facts and
the comprehension, on an abstract
level, of ideas which have little or no
bearing on many students' personal
experiences. This process is consider
ed by many to serve the purpose of
manufacturing "yes men" for modern
American society.
Stanford can be considered a reflec
tion of society at large in that it
idolizes the useful. "Nobody can
touch us," says Greenberg, "when it
comes to know how."
Eor the Experiment, Stanford is
basically a hostile environment. This

is not to say actively hostile. Indeed,
the administration here has been
quite flexible in its accommodation of
the Experiment (for example, in pro
viding space for it in the old Civ li
brary). The faculty has generally
been passive — skeptical in a polite
way, but not overtly opposed.
Stanford is seen as a hostile en
is concerned not with "how" but with
"why." Thus it hits the very founda
tions of the kind of education one re
ceives at Stanford and the justifica
tions for it. These days the question
of why a student should want to learn
something is usually either ignored
or answered in materialist, terms: we
go to school to get a degree to get a
nice job to make a lot of money to
live in comfort.
The latest issue of Commitment,
the Experiment's newspaper, carries
excerpts from an article by Michael
Novak, now an assistant professor of
Religion at Stanford. The article ap
peared in Harper's five year ago; it
could have been written yesterday.
Novak 'says in part: "The Anglo-
American university has committed
itself to all that is objective, count
able, precise, publicly verifiable....
(The student) may never fully grasp
the fact that education is not so much
information and technique as self
confrontation and change in his own
conscious life."
The Experiment is intended as an
answer to this implicit challenge.
