# IJB Holds Hearing In Open Hours Case
## 
### GAIL ANDERSON 
The IJB heard University and Judi
cial Council arguments concerning
the open house question at the hear
ing last night of the Couzens-Ackerley
test case.
Stating the University's position,
Dean of Students H. Donald Winbig
ler said that the LASSU open house
policy had the express purpose of
creating a conflict of law and that stu
dents were informed that they were
expected to respect University policy
on this point.
The Judicial Council finding was
that neither ASSU policy nor relevant
University policy on open houses was
violated, and therefore the defendants
were innocent and there existed no
conflict of law.
"If this proposition were accepted,"
noted Winbigler, "it would threaten
law and order on campus."
He pointed to five cases which had
come before the Council in the past
concerning open house regulations,
saying this justified rejection of the
idea that the University had rescinded
its policy.
Explaining his motives for initiating
the test case, Mike Couzens said since

the University policy on open house
was not enforced, students were con
fused as to what regulations to fol
low and that a test case might initiate
proceedings to clarify this situation.
He cited the."notorious" lack of en
forcement of stated University policy
as indicating a conflict between the
stated regulation and the actual po
licy.
Prof. Joseph Sneed, chairman of the
IJB, asked Deah Winbigler if there
were many violations of University
open house rules in men's residences.
Winbigler replied that he had the im
pression that there were.
In the hearing it developed that
RA's were not enforcing the Univer
sity policy.
The main question in the hearing
was the difference between University
regulations and University policy.
However while the Judicial Council
position was that since the University
policy wag not enforced it was not
valid, evidence from the ASSU Bylaws
showed that the Council has the re
sponsibility to enforce University reg
ulations as well as University "policy."
The IJB will meet for deliberation
Sunday as to its actions in the case.
