# COWERS SPEAKS
## Police Mistreat Minorities 
### GEOFFREY STEVENS 
Congressman John Conyers of De
troit gave the second lecture of a
series on police brutality last night
in Tresidder.
Tonight at 7:15 in Tresidder Lt.
William J. Osterloh of the San Fran
cisco Police Department will speak on
what San Francisco police are doing
to improve police-community rela
tions.
Review Boards Insufficient
Congressman Conyers emphasized
that prejudiced policemen don't al
ways physically abuse members of
minority groups, but frequently ha
rass and mistreat these "lower sta
tus" citizens. He stated that citizen
review boards cannot change the at
titudes of bigoted policemen.

According to 'Conyers, Negroes in
urban ghettoes feel as if they are
ruled by a colonial power, and be
cause they feel that policemen are
their enemies, Negroes are acutely
sensitive to mistreatment. On the
other hand, policemen are underpaid,
untrained in community relations, and
short of patience when dealing with
members of minorities. This explains,
Conyers said, why so many of the re
cent race riots such as those in Watts
and Detroit were "triggered by inci
dents with police."
Concerning citizen review boards,
Conyers made several proposals for
improving police-community relations.
He suggested that police forces must
become fully integrated, reflecting
the actual percentages of Negroes in

a community.
Because Negroes don't want to Join
an institution considered oppressive
by their fellows the images of police
forces across the nation must be com
pletely changed. Conyers proposed
that the quickest way to change the
image of a police force, his instant
"integration plan," is to appoint a
Negro as the police commissioner.
This appointment, argued Conyers,
would cause bigoted officers to resign
thus creating more positions for Ne
gro police candidates. .
Thte Congressman also said if the
problems of crime and police brutal
ity are ever to be solved, the ghettos
must be destroyed, and policemen
must receive better training and more
pay.
