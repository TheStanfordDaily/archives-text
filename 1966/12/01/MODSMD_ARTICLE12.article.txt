# 12 Die In Lake Huron Disaster; Hope Fades For 20 Missing
## News In Brief Complied From the Associated Press 
### 
HARBOR BEACH, Mich.—Cracked in
in half by 25-foot waves, the freighter
Daniel J. Morrell plunged to the icy
bottom of Lake Huron before dawn
Tuesday amid a storm that concealed
her fate for 34 hours.
The tragedy became the worst on
the Great Lakes in eight years with
the recovery of 12 bodies, and the fate
of the 20 missing Morrell crew mem
bers darkened as snow moved into the
search area last night.
Earlier in the day, the Coast Guard
plucked the only apparent survivor
from a raft in the choppy waters.
• Ex-Nazi Gets Top Post
BONN, Germany—Kurt Georg Kie
singer won Social Democratic endorse
ment early today, thus clearing his
last hurdle to succeed Ludwig Erhard
as West Germany's Chancellor.
Kiesinger's own Christian Democrats
endorsed him last night. His rise to the
top government job, complicated for a
time by controversies over his Nazi
past will be climaxed by formal elec
tion later today.
Erhard stepped down as Chancellor
yesterday, making way for a "Grand
Coalition" Government of Christian
Democrats and the Social Democrats.

• Clash With VC Ends Luss
SAlGON—Ending a four-day combat
lull, U.S. ground and air forces killed 64
Communist troops and suffered no
casualties themselves in a series of
clashes 25 miles north of Saigon yester
day, U.C. military headquarters said.
The report of the fighting—involv
ing units of the U.S. Ist Infrantry Di
vision—was coupled with a U.S. dis
closure that two new operations were
under way by other elements of the
division and that Australian troops also
launched a new search-and-destroy
sweep.
So far little contact with the enemy
was reported in any of the new opera
tions.
All three of them are near Saigon.
• Arabs Confer On Israel
CAIRO — The Joint Arab Defense
Council has been summoned to meet in
Cairo December 7 against a background
of worsening Middle East tension, in
formed sources said yesterday.
Arab foreign ministers also were in
vited to attend the Defense Council
Meeting, the sources said.
Plans for the meeting were reported
after Israel said it shot down two

Soviet-built Egyptian jet planes. Gun
fire crackled along the Israeli-Jordan
border and Syria's ruling Baath So
cialist Party called for overthrow of
Jordan's King Hussein and creation of
"the necessary climate for the return to
Palestine."
• Rhodesia Solution Near?
LONDON — Prime Minister Wilson
last night called two special meetings
of ministers on the Rhodesian crisis for
today, heightening speculation among
British lawmakers that a breakthrough
may be near in the long-deadlocked
dispute.
The key issue is whether the rebel
lious Rhodesians are prepared to drop
their insistence on the right to regu
late the pace of African political ad
vancement toward majority -rule. Wil
son is demanding guarantees that Afri
can progress toward power will be un
impeded.
Britain is considering offering a reso

lution to the Security Council calling
for imposition of certain compusory
sanctions against the Smith Regime.
• Budget Excess Foreseen
AUSTIN, Tex.—Government experts
are speculating that the new federal
budget that goes to Congress in Jan
uary will range up to around $140 bil
lion.
As the fiscal authorities view it, the
budget for the present fiscal year end
ing next June 30 will reach a minimum
of $127 billion and a possible maximum
of $130 billion. This compares with
nearly $113 billion in expenditures pro
posed by President Johnson when he
submitted his original budget for the
year last January.
• Rusk Cites Truce Danger
CHlCAGO—Secretary of State Dean
Rusk said yesterday U.S. military
forces in Vietnam, remembering last
year, will be cautious about the holiday
truce and be ready for shooting.
"Everybody remembers last year and
the violations of the truce by the other
side," Rush told newsmen. "We will
have to watch ourselves and keep our
selves in a position to shoot back."
Asked whether the holiday truce

agreement might be a stepping stone
toward negotiations for peace, Rush re
plied:
"We have not seen any basis for that."
Asked about the forecasts that the
Vietnam war could run on for 3 to 10
years, Rusk replied.
"As long as they keep coming from
the North we'll be there to meet them."
• Countdown Goes *AOK 9
BAY ST. LOUIS, Miss.—The count
down of the accident-plagued seer nd
stage of America's first Saturn Five
rocket proceeded yesterday without in
cident with the test firing set for 11
p.m. last night.
Liquid hydrogen and oxygen were
ready to be loaded aboard in the final
step before testing the engine that
would one day become a part of in
effort to lift a man to the moon.
The booster produces one million
pounds of thrust. The project is al
ready four months behind schedule
after an earlier model blew up damag

The engine will be fired for nearly
six minutes—the time it must open !e
when it pushes a 47-ton Apollo moon
ship into the skies.

• Ex-Nazi Gets Top Post
BONN, Germany—Kurt Georg Kie
singer won Social Democratic endorse
ment early today, thus clearing his
last hurdle to succeed Ludwig Erhard
as West Germany's Chancellor.
Kiesinger's own Christian Democrats
endorsed him last night. His rise to the
top government job, complicated for a
time by controversies over his Nazi
past will be climaxed by formal elec
tion later today.
Erhard stepped down as Chancellor
yesterday, making way for a "Grand
Coalition" Government of Christian
Democrats and the Social Democrats.

• Clash With VC Ends Luss
SAlGON—Ending a four-day combat
lull, U.S. ground and air forces killed 64
Communist troops and suffered no
casualties themselves in a series of
clashes 25 miles north of Saigon yester
day, U.C. military headquarters said.
The report of the fighting—involv
ing units of the U.S. Ist Infrantry Di
vision—was coupled with a U.S. dis
closure that two new operations were
under way by other elements of the
division and that Australian troops also
launched a new search-and-destroy
sweep.
So far little contact with the enemy
was reported in any of the new opera
tions.
All three of them are near Saigon.
• Arabs Confer On Israel
CAIRO — The Joint Arab Defense

Cairo December 7 against a background
of worsening Middle East tension, in
formed sources said yesterday.
Arab foreign ministers also were in
vited to attend the Defense Council
Meeting, the sources said.
Plans for the meeting were reported
after Israel said it shot down two

Soviet-built Egyptian jet planes. Gun
fire crackled along the Israeli-Jordan
border and Syria's ruling Baath So
cialist Party called for overthrow of
Jordan's King Hussein and creation of
"the necessary climate for the return to
Palestine."
• Rhodesia Solution Near?
LONDON — Prime Minister Wilson
last night called two special meetings
of ministers on the Rhodesian crisis for
today, heightening speculation among
British lawmakers that a breakthrough
may be near in the long-deadlocked
dispute.
The key issue is whether the rebel
lious Rhodesians are prepared to drop
their insistence on the right to regu
late the pace of African political ad
vancement toward majority -rule. Wil
son is demanding guarantees that Afri
can progress toward power will be un
impeded.
Britain is considering offering a reso

for imposition of certain compusory
sanctions against the Smith Regime.
• Budget Excess Foreseen
AUSTIN, Tex.—Government experts
are speculating that the new federal
budget that goes to Congress in Jan
uary will range up to around $140 bil
lion.
As the fiscal authorities view it, the
budget for the present fiscal year end
ing next June 30 will reach a minimum
of $127 billion and a possible maximum
of $130 billion. This compares with
nearly $113 billion in expenditures pro
posed by President Johnson when he
submitted his original budget for the
year last January.
• Rusk Cites Truce Danger
CHlCAGO—Secretary of State Dean
Rusk said yesterday U.S. military
forces in Vietnam, remembering last
year, will be cautious about the holiday
truce and be ready for shooting.
"Everybody remembers last year and
the violations of the truce by the other
side," Rush told newsmen. "We will
have to watch ourselves and keep our
selves in a position to shoot back."
Asked whether the holiday truce

agreement might be a stepping stone
toward negotiations for peace, Rush re
plied:
"We have not seen any basis for that."
Asked about the forecasts that the
Vietnam war could run on for 3 to 10
years, Rusk replied.
"As long as they keep coming from
the North we'll be there to meet them."
• Countdown Goes *AOK 9
BAY ST. LOUIS, Miss.—The count
down of the accident-plagued seer nd

p.m. last night.
Liquid hydrogen and oxygen were
ready to be loaded aboard in the final

The booster produces one million

The engine will be fired for nearly
six minutes—the time it must open !e

lull, U.S. ground and air forces killed 64

The report of the fighting—involv
ing units of the U.S. Ist Infrantry Di
vision—was coupled with a U.S. dis
closure that two new operations were
under way by other elements of the
division and that Australian troops also
launched a new search-and-destroy
sweep.
So far little contact with the enemy
was reported in any of the new opera
tions.
All three of them are near Saigon.

of ministers on the Rhodesian crisis for
today, heightening speculation among

can progress toward power will be un
impeded.

• Budget Excess Foreseen
AUSTIN, Tex.—Government experts
are speculating that the new federal
budget that goes to Congress in Jan
uary will range up to around $140 bil
lion.
As the fiscal authorities view it, the
budget for the present fiscal year end
ing next June 30 will reach a minimum
of $127 billion and a possible maximum
of $130 billion. This compares with
nearly $113 billion in expenditures pro
posed by President Johnson when he

forces in Vietnam, remembering last
year, will be cautious about the holiday
truce and be ready for shooting.
"Everybody remembers last year and
the violations of the truce by the other

have to watch ourselves and keep our
selves in a position to shoot back."

agreement might be a stepping stone
toward negotiations for peace, Rush re

"We have not seen any basis for that."

Vietnam war could run on for 3 to 10
years, Rusk replied.
"As long as they keep coming from
the North we'll be there to meet them."
• Countdown Goes *AOK 9
BAY ST. LOUIS, Miss.—The count
down of the accident-plagued seer nd
stage of America's first Saturn Five
rocket proceeded yesterday without in
cident with the test firing set for 11
p.m. last night.
Liquid hydrogen and oxygen were
ready to be loaded aboard in the final
step before testing the engine that
would one day become a part of in
effort to lift a man to the moon.
The booster produces one million
pounds of thrust. The project is al
ready four months behind schedule
after an earlier model blew up damag
ing the test stand.
The engine will be fired for nearly
six minutes—the time it must open !e
when it pushes a 47-ton Apollo moon
ship into the skies.
HARBOR BEACH, Mich.—Cracked in
in half by 25-foot waves, the freighter
Daniel J. Morrell plunged to the icy
bottom of Lake Huron before dawn
Tuesday amid a storm that concealed
her fate for 34 hours.
The tragedy became the worst on
the Great Lakes in eight years with
the recovery of 12 bodies, and the fate
of the 20 missing Morrell crew mem
bers darkened as snow moved into the
search area last night.
Earlier in the day, the Coast Guard
plucked the only apparent survivor
from a raft in the choppy waters.

time by controversies over his Nazi
past will be climaxed by formal elec
tion later today.
Erhard stepped down as Chancellor
yesterday, making way for a "Grand
Coalition" Government of Christian
Democrats and the Social Democrats.
