# New Installation Project Replaces Power Circuit
## 
### STEVE GRUBER Construction Editor 
The streets are torn up in
front of Stern Hall again, this
time to install new electrical
power circuits.
Cars have been circumventing
the ditches at the corner of
Galvez and Escondido for three
weeks, but will probably be able
to drive through the area with
out delay by the first of Jan
uary.
John Lerry, one of the Uni
versity's Planning Engineers ex
plained the project as a switch
from the present 4.16 kilovolt
lines to new 12 kilovolt wires.
The conduits will extend as far
as Escondido Village, which is
presently served by the Pacific
Gas and Electric Company.
The University wishes to put
Escondido Village on its own
circuits to reduce costs, accord
ing to Lerry.
All of the new construction
is part of the northeast loop
which will provide sufficient cir
cuits for future campus develop
ment south of Wilbur Hall.

Lerry explained that only one
third of the possible lines will
be used at first to allow for ex
pansion. Computer circuits and
closed circuit television may
utilize some of the new conduits.
"Stanford has undergrounded
11 miles of ducts since the war,"
Lerry said. The University has
a policy of putting telephone and
power lines underground when
ever possible.
The laying of the ducts will be
finished sometime early in Jan
uary, but the actual installation
of the cables will not be com
pleted until August due to short
ages caused by the Vietnam war.
Lerry stated that the total cost
of the northeast loop will be
about $350,000. Other extensions
of water, steam, and electric
lines will raise the total to about
$1 million.
The project, presently being
completed by the Underground
Construction Company, is not
supported by the PACE pro
gram, but is paid for by the
various departments who will
benefit from its installation.
