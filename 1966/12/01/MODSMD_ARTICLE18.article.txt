# Students Find 'The News' In Search For Values
## 
### 
"What is so surprising is that
religion is news," said Malcolm
Boyd, Episcopal priest and
hungry i entertainer, when he
spoke to over 1200 students
here a few weeks ago.
It is news, particularly here
at Stanford this fall, but why?
Has the student changed; is he
suddenly aware of religion? Or
has religion changed and is it
suddenly aware of the student?
The answer is a combination
of the two and the phenomenon
has been growing for several
years. "Having rejected corny
Christianity and Judaism, but
still holding on to his values,
the student is left without a
language," says Michael Novak.
Rediscovery of Secular
Students are now searching
for a basis for these values, and
religion is providing them with
an intellectual approach that
meets most needs. Robert Mc-
Afee Brown calls this approach
"the rediscovery of the secular
as the real arena of the reli
gious."
The search for values has no
where to go in the modern uni
versity, except into religion
courses, as limited as they might
be. Political science professor
Charles Drekmeier says:"The
courses we offer don't complete

ly offer what the students need
and this explains the success of
things like religion courses and
Mr. Greenberg's Experiment."
'The religion course is a place
where the talking about these
values is a primary concern,"
says Michael Novak. "The old
shell of religion collapses and a
new life emerges. Everyone feels
there is a creativity here and
this is the excitement."
Relevant To Life
Brown cites two more factors
in the new interest of the stu
dent: the ecumencial concern
of all faiths, and the whole theo
logical ferment around such
works as Honest to God, and
The Phenomenon of Man. The
basic question according to
Brown is, "whether religion has
a contribution to make in re
gard to life."
William A. Clebsch, professor
of religious studies, sees a grad
ual change over the last twenty
to twenty-five years. "It is now
realized that religion has a val
ue as a humanistic discipline â€”
it is wise to learn about religion
if people are to understand the
world about them."
But the new interest in reli
gion goes beyond faith and the
search for values. It involves
commitment too. Clebsch and
Edwin M. Good and campus min

isters Stuart McLean and Lane
Barton all called for commit
ment to understand the world.
To follow the values of hu
man dignity and freedom that
they hold, students must now
overcome what Barton calls
"the fear of accepting the risk
of stepping out." Involvement
may come in East Palo Alto,
Hong Kong, the Peace Corps, or
simply Mississippi, but these
men claim it must come and is
a part of the phenomenon of
religious concern.
Brown points out that many
are "not yet ready to walk into
a worship service, but they are
ready to walk into a discussion."
So the importance of a religion
curriculum and extracurricular
program that meets these needs,
is evident.
Drekmeier asserts such dis
cussion and study will lead to
a "calling." "People today want
to prepare for a vocation and
not for a profession."
The student has changed and
seeks new types of intellectual
challenge and stimulation. When
he finds it in a secular context
that he can understand, when
religion has realized how it
must speak to man, then the
student suddenly grasps it and
values lead to commitment.
