# Religion Changes And Napier Bring New Breath Of Enthusiasm, Concern
## 
### CICELY BATES KIRK HANSON 
The introduction of denomina
tional worship and B. Davie Na
pier's arrival at Stanford as
Dean of the Chapel have created
a new climate of enthusiasm and
concern for religion.
Attendance at services and at
speeches by clergymen this au
tumn quarter is the largest in
Stanford's history.
Denominational worship was
adopted last February by ac
tion of the Board of Trustees
on a "trial" basis. At the time
they stated if enough interest
was shown in continuing such
worship, they would take the
necessary legal action to allow
it premanently.
Napier From Yale
Dean Napier came to Stanford
this fall from Yale where he was
dean of an undergraduate col
lege and a professor of Old
Testament. "There is vigor in
carnate," says Richard W. Ly
man, new Provost of the Univer
sity and chairman of the Presi
dent's Advisory Committee on
Religious Activities.
"He has something to say, he
is prepared to say it, and the
people can understand it,"says
Edwin M. Good, professor of
Religious Studies. Napier speaks
to the people and is sensitive to
the contemporary spirit, accord
ing to Stuart McLean, one of
the ministers of the United Cam
pus Christian Ministry (UCCM).
Dean Napier received an en
thusiastic welcome to Stanford
during pre-reg week when he
spoke to the freshmen. He spoke
of "yellow submarines" and the
new life both he and the fresh
men would encounter at Stan
ford.
Jewish Worship
Denominational services did
not begin until this fall because
of a controversy over Jewish
worship. The Trustees' original
resolution allowed sectarian ser
vices only in Memorial Church.
Many Jewish students object
ed to the Christian symbolism
of the Church and Rabbi Charles
Familant said he "would find
it impossible to conduct services
in the Memorial Church build
ing." Action this September al
lowed Jewish worship in the
Clubhouse.
Many services are now being
held in Memorial Church and in
the Clubhouse. All are open to
the entire Stanford community.
Mass according to the Roman
Catholic liturgy, Communion
according to the Book of Com
mon Prayer, Devotion according

to the Lutheran tradition are
held each week in Memorial
Church.
Sabbath Evening and Morn
ing Services, Prayers led by the
Stanford Christian Fellowship,
and Testimonial Meetings led
by the Christian Scientists are
all held in the Clubhouse.
Crowds At Mass
The Sunday afternoon Mass
has attracted crowds of four to
nine hundred, without a signifi
cant decline in attendance at the
Masses held at the Newman
Catholic Center in Palo Alto.
"Having Mass in Memorial
Church has increased our con
gregation 40-50 per cent," ac
cording to Father John Duryea,
Catholic chaplain. "It certainly
has been a great convenience for
the students," he says.
Attendance at the Sabbath ser
vices has varied from fifteen
to thirty-five. Rabbi Familant
and students have introduced
speakers into the Sabbath ser
vices. "I have my doubts a lib
eral service without this sort
of content is going to attract
this modern generation," he
says.
However, most Protestant de
nominations have chosen to
identify with the Sunday morn
ing service led by Dean Napier.
"I think the Protestant denom
inations are less denominational
ly-minded than ever before,"
says Napier.
Episcopal minister Lane Bar
ton says he is "not out to sell
Anglicans." The great coopera
tion which has grown out of
this spirit is reflected in the
Stanford United Ministry estab
lished by Dean Napier at the
beginning of the quarter.
Napier had great praise for
the group of ministers. "I think
we are terribly fortunate to
have the personnel we do."
Clubhouse Offices
The UCCM and ministers have
offices in the Clubhouse. Rabbi
Familant says, "since I have
had my office on campus, I have
seen so many more students."
All ministers expressed the val
ue of having offices on campus.
Dean Napier and J. Gordon
Verplank, Assistant Dean of the
Chapel and last year a graduate
of Yale Divinity School, have in
troduced many changes into the
regular worship services in Me
morial Church. Dean Napier's
sermons have been directed
toward the student and his real
problems.
"Whenever Dean Napier
speaks, I feel he must have call

ed me up the night before and
asked me what my problems
are," comments one sophomore
coed. Memorial Church is al
most filled every Sunday for the
11 a.m. service.
Communion Service
Verplank has developed a
Communion Service held each
Sunday at 9 a.m. based on an
Anglican liturgy developed for
use in Africa. Community par
ticipation is emphasized in all
services.
According to Dean Napier,
"There has been some attrition
in the Palo Alto, Menlo Park,
and Atherton people who have
liked to come here, but we are
ministering to a university com
munity." He expressed great en
thusiasm that such a high per
centage of the congregation
was student.
However, Dean Napier sees
certain problems remaining. "I
think it is right we go slowly
and play it by ear as we pro
ceed." One of the issues in ques
tion is the inclusion of a collec
tion in the services. "It has a
liturgical meaning," says Na
pier. "It's a truncated, incom

plete service of worship without
it." He envisions such collec
tions not for the support of any
Memorial Church activities, but
for world charities or other out
side special needs.
Church House
Recommendations have been
aired during the last two years
for the building of a church
house with facilities for offices
and a small chapel. Napier is
hesitant about this. "I like the
Clubhouse because it is not ex
clusively a religious center. If
I thought a church house would
not be downgraded because of
its exclusive commitment to re
ligion, I would be more enthu
siastic."
Action by the Trustees mak
ing denominational worship per
manent is still pending, but the
"trial" worship appears an un
qualified success.
Students have responded to
the changes made in the reli
gious program at Stanford.
Gordon Verplank told The Daily
earlier this week: "Both' Napier
and I are overwhelmed with the
responsiveness of the students.
There is a real hunger here."
