# THE ISSUE:
## Is it really business vs. government? 
### 
Business now has a significant
competitor—the government.
—Edward Kokalas, Michigan State University

Dear Mr. Kokalas:
The entire field of government-business relations
is a complicated one, but at least one thing is
clear. Government and business both compete
and cooperate.
.Your point is that government has become a
significant competitor in terms of students making
a career choice. This is healthy. Our society is a
system. Business and government are essential
parts of this system. We in business respect the
need for able and talented people in government.
Those who choose government for a career must
likewise have respect for the businessman.
In your letter you say that many students
subscribe to a new maxim: "What's good for the
Federal Government is good for the country." If
from this we are to imply, however, that only
government careers are important, satisfying, and
rewarding, then we disagree.
In your letter, you enumerate four important
career goals: "Challenging work, job security,
financial rewards, and . . . a contribution to
society/' Let's examine the opportunities business
offers to meet these goals.
Depending on how far up the ladder you go,
there is no question that financial rewards are

greater in business,. Job security certainly exists
in business where, of course, it depends primarily
on merit. And, business does offer a person
challenging work and the opportunity to make a
contribution to society. So does government,
but in a different fashion.
Ask yourself this question: "Do I want to be
employed by an organization that devotes its
energies to identifying problems, or one which is
concerned with solving problems?" As a rule,
the responsibility of solving problems falls to
business and industry.
Look at the Job Corps. Most urban centers are
run by private industry—companies like Graflex,
Inc., IBM, Xerox, U.S. Industries, Inc., IT&T,
Philco-Ford, Packard Bell, and Burroughs. To rely
on prominent businesses to do this job was a
decision that made sense. After all, the young
men and women benefiting from Job Corps
programs are being trained to later hold real jobs
in the real world. They'll-most likely find these
jobs in private industry.
Recently, the Peace Corps turned to business to
supplement their hitherto university-directed
training programs for volunteers. The companies
involved include such names as General Dynamics
Corp., Westinghouse, and Litton. Here's a

comment from a Peace Corps official it
appeared in a recent "Business Week" article,
"Private industry is more flexible, less
compartmentalized. We've got a better chance
to experiment and innovate when business
is involved/'
In the field of municipal government, Mayor .
john Lindsay of New York recently appointed a
Management Advisor Council, composed of 6
top industrialists, to study and improve city
administration. The move was made in the hope
that "our municipal government . . . can be
operated as smoothly'for the benefit of the people
as the complex organizations headed by these
executives in the private sector."
I think that with the proliferation of government
programs and resulting duplication and red tape,
more and more businessmen will have to be
called.on by government officials to help
straighten things out for reasons of effectiveness,
economy, and efficiency.
This is where the real organizational strength of
business lies. This is how its performance is •
measured. This is one of the reasons why business
is the pacesetter in our society providing the
creative and economic foundation for all else
to happen.
Business, in common with government, succeeds
when it is established "of the people, by the
people, and for the people/' As you choose your
career, consider both business and government
in terms of how each renders its service to all
people and how each challenges you personally.

For the last seven weeks, this paper has been publishing a unique (exchange of
views—a dialogue between Robert W. Galvin, Motorola Chairman, and Edward Kokalas,
Michigan State student.
At Mr. Galvin's invitation, Mr. Kokalas presented some of the opinions—positive and
negative—that students have about business. This is Mr. Galvin's answer to one of the issues
raised. Responses to additional issues will appear in this paper and, shortly, Mr. Kokalas
will comment on what Mr. Galvin has to say. The dialogue will continue as long as there
are points to discuss.
This and similar dialogues are appearing in college newspapers throughout the country.
