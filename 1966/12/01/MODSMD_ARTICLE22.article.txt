# Minnesota Supports Draft In Referendum
## 
### 
• MINNEAPOLIS, Minn. (CPS)
— The present draft policy of
choosing some men for govern
ment service while deferring
others was endorsed by slightly
more than half of the University
of Minnesota students voting in
a campus referendum here Nov.
16.
By better than a three-to-one
margin, however, the students
called for giving draftees the
opportunity to choose either
military service or "alternative
government approved service"
once they are in. "Approved ser
vice" would include alternatives
such as VISTA or the Peace
Corps.
Although there were frequent
ly long linos at the polls, only
2,436 students voted in the one
day referendum. The Univer
sity's student population num
bers close to 40,000.
On the first section of the
complex ballot, students were
asked to choose among various
alternatives for tapping the na
tional manpower pool to pro
vide for the armed forces.

Twenty-one per cent (529)
favored universal military ser
vice. A lottery system with the
abolition of all deferments was
preferred by 10 per cent (252).
A selective system of the
present type which grants de
ferments found approval in 52
per cent of the students (1,272).
Twelve per cent (383) said they
thought the government should
cease conscription, period. Ap
proximately five per cent of the
voters did not mark the first bal
lot section at all.
Under a system of the present
type, the students had definite
ideas on whom they would like
to see deferred. Over 88 per cent
favored deferments for students
which would continue until the
completion of their education.
More than 66 per cent approv
ed of deferring men with "criti
cal skills." Twenty-seven per
cent endorsed putting married
men without children low on
the call-up priority, and 42 per
cent indicated that married men
with children should be deferred.
Ten per cent of the voters

wrote in additional opinions on
deferments ranging in categor
ies from Conscientious Objectors
to convicted felons.
On the final section of the
referendum, 1,529 students vot
ed to expand the concept of na
tional service to allow draftees,
regardless of how they are se
lected, more alternatives for
their service than the armed
forces.
Only 484 advocated continuing
to require all service in the mili
tary.
