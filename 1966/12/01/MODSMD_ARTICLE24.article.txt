WASHINGTON, D.C. (CPS) â€”
While students may not be to
tally opposed to government
conscription, they want to
choose their area of service, ac
cording to referenda at four ma
jor universities last week.
Students at the City College
of New York favored giving
draftees the choice of service
opportunities ether than mili
tary by an 84.3 percent margin
Nov. 18. On the same day 82.5
percent of the voters at the Uni
versity of Connecticut endorsed
an identical plan.
In a Nov. 16 vote the largest
number of students ever to par
ticipate in a University of Mich
igan election approved the alter
native service idea by 81.6 per
cent. At the University of Min
nesota 76.4 percent ballotted
similarly.
Proposals for a national draft
lottery to select conscriptees by
chance received little support on
any of the campuses. When ask
ed to choose between universal

service, a selective service, the
lottery or, in the case of the last
three schools, no conscription
whatever, only 9.9 percent of
the Connecticut students opted
for the lottery. Michigan follow
ed suit with 9.0 percent, Minne
sota with 10 and CCNY with 7.0
A selective system granting
deferments similar to the pres
ent. draft apparatus was endors
ed by a majority at all the
schools: Michigan, 62.3 percent;
Minnesota, 52 percent; CCNY
54.2 percent and Connecticut
58.2 percent.
Other alternatives received
support as follows: universal
military training Michigan
16.5, CCNY 14.2, Minnesota 21
and Connecticut 32; no conscrip
tion whatever Michigan 12.2,
CCNY 24.5, and Minnesota 12.
The question was put different
ly at Connecticut where 38 per
cent thought that there should
be no peacetime draft while 7.7
percent said that the nation is
never justified in conscripting.
