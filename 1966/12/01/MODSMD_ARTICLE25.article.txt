# Frosh Actors Will Perform
## 
### DILIP MIRCHANDANI 
The Freshman Drama Group
presents its first annual Christ
mas Revels production, "Mys
tery, Mayhem, and Mirth" this
afternoon at 4:15.
Under the sponsorship of the
Freshman English Department
60 freshman will offer two mys
tery plays, "The Sheparas Play"
and "Magnus Herod." Both
plays were chosen for their
comic spirit and communal at
titude they retain despite the
centuries which have passed
since they were first performed
by roving amateurs.
Festivities begin at noon
when the actors and part of
the choir present a preview in
the form of a scene from each
of the plays.
The pageant begins with a 4
p.m. religious procession of
Biblical figures, singers, and in
strumentalists which proceeds
from White Memorial Plaza to
the front of Memorial Church.
There on a raised platform the
actors will present "The Shep
herd's Play." "Magnus Herod,"
the story of King Herod and the
slaughter of the innocents, will
be presented immediately after
ward inside the Church.
