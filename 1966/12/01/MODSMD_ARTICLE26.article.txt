# McAfee-Brown Article Defends 'Archaic' University Structure
## 
### 
Preserving the sanctity of the
individual person is the "domi
nant concern" of today's college
students, Prof. Robert McAfee-
Brown states in the current is
sue of Presbyterian Life.
Prof. Brown comments that
students see the university as
a '"microcosm of the whole cul
ture, a culture characterized by
impersonality."
Students react in various ways
to this situation: "A few have
given up on the structures as
archaic and beyond hope of re
demption." Others, including
some at Stanford, have decided
to experiment with parallel
structures, using small classes,
give-and-take discussions, and
less rigidity to create an atmo
sphere for learning.
Students are inclined to dis
count those dimensions of edu
cation that are not strictly in
the realm of interpersonal rela
tions, he continues. "The univer
sity is more than one vast ex
perience in group dynamics, and
education is more than human
exchange of points in view 'in
depth.' There is a content, a sub
ject matter, to master, and some
of it has to be gotten from meth
ods as old-fashioned as reading
books and engaging from time

to time in writing a blue book
or a term paper."
In similar fashion, some stu
dents feel that "the university
belongs to the students." This
is only partially true, Brown re
plies.
"Students are not the whole
of the university. One can ima
gine the uproar which would

follow another such sweeping
claim 'the university belongs
to the faculty.' The universitj
is not only a place students in
habit, but a place where reserch
is conducted, where writing i.<
done, where scholarly resource.'
