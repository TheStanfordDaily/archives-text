# Cards Take On USF In Basketball Opener
## 
### RAFAEL PALACIO 
With the football season now
over, the sports eye
"«now focuses on the upcoming
*' collegiate basketball season,
which opens for Stanford to
■-night at 8 p.m. against the al
.ways tough USF Dons.
I • Looking over his troops, In
'» dian Coach Howie Dallmar faces
•\ a year of tough Pacific 8 com
;■ petition against the likes of
. mammoth Lew Alcindor and the
> UCLA Bruins, and defending
it conference champions Oregon
State.
Indians On The Bun
\\ ■ This year the Indians will
. practically have to "run" for
their lives. With the loss of grad-
I* uated seniors Ray Kosanke
U (6'9") and Bob Bedell (6'7"),
' who were stalwarts on the
last year, the Tribe Is

faced with a definite lack of
height up front.
In order to make up for this
deficiency the Indians will have
to run and keep that ball mov
ing. but all is not gloom, the
Indians do have a few things
going for them. One of these big
plusses is Arthur Harris, a first
team All-Conference guard last
year, and this year a potential
Ail-American.
Harris At Forward
Harris, who was the leading
scorer on the team last year, and
the third leading scorer in the
league, will move up to the for
ward spot this year. Dallmar is
hoping that the 6'4" Harris will
be able to make up for his lack
of height at forward with his
fine jumping ability.
Another returning first string
er is junior guard Gary Peters
meyer. Petersmeyer is a fine

ball-handler and a dangerous
outside shooter. He performed
well last year, and should be
the steadying influence in the
backcourt this year.
Up from the freshman squad
to join Petersmeyer at the other
guard spot will be Don Griffin,
who was the leading scorer on
the frosh team last year. Grif
fin at 6'4" is an excellent shoot
er, and should get his fair share
of rebounds.
Another returning letterman
who will be starting at the for
ward spot is Howard Hassen.

Hassen at 6'4" will also be play
ing under a height disadvantage,
but he is a strong player and
is highly skilled in the funda
mentals of basketball.
Hassen To Pick Up Scoring
Hassen is very important in
Coach Dallmar's plans, for he
will have to pick up the scoring
void which resulted with the loss
of the high scoring Bob Bedell.
Last year Hassen's best game
was against UCLA. He will have
to perform up to this caliber
in every game if the Indians
are to go anywhere.

Bearing the brunt of work un
der the backboards will be cen
ter Rich Baker, At 6'7", Baker
is one of the shorter centers In
the conference. But he is an ag
gressive and hard-nosed playet,
and will make up with strength
whatever he lacks in finesse.
The only other senior on the
squad, along with Hassen and
Baker is guard Tom Nisbet.
Nisbet, the leading scorer on
the 1964 freshman squad, is a
rugged competitor, who though
handicapped by a lack of height
(5'10") makes up for it with
speed, aggressiveness, and
hustle. In the past Nisbet has
had a tendency to become tense,
but he has gained more confi
dence and will be a good man to
have around.
Sophomores Predominate
This year Coach Dallmar does
not have a junior varsity squad,
and there are many sophomores
on the squad. Some of the out
standing sophomores are Mai
McElwain, one of the top frosh
scorers last year, and guard
Bill Halligan.
Overall, the team lacks solid
bench strength, and has a short
age of tall men. In order to win
consistently the squad will have
to run and shoot well. Defense
will have to be good, and team
play is undoubtedly the key to
a successful season.
If Art Harris can perform as
well in the forward spot as he
did at guard and if Hassen can
improve in the scoring depart
ment, the squad has a fighting
chance. But these are ifs, and
you just can't count on ifs when
you're playing Lew Alcindor
and UCLA.
Spirit Key To Victory
Another thing which could
play an important part in how
well the team does, is something
which is seldom considered. This
is spirit. The team does not have
the heralded names and super
material, but if the players can
get together and generate posi
tive enthusiasm and desire, they
could erase all of the ifs.
