from inciting or participating in Uni
versity demonstrations.
The Sheriff's Deputies placed their
prisoners in a bus and when it at
tempted to leave, about 500 persons
swarmed around it. Police with night
sticks pushed back the crowd and the
bus moved out through it.
Early in the demonstration, about
50 persons staged a sit-in in the lower
level where the recruiting table had
been set up.
Savio, talking with the students In
the upper levels, said the sit-ins
should remain in the building until
after the 12 midnight closing hour
"as a matter of principle."
Shortly before 6 p.m., however, the

Campus Police started removing pej-
sons from the lower level and the uni

variety of charges.
Eight persons were arrested early
in the proceedings and more arrests
were being made. Among the first ar

the anti-Vietnam war group, The Viet

group called The Provos.
The demonstration began when the
students, some of them members of
the Students For A Democratic So

cruiters, police said. They estimated
the crowd at 400.
