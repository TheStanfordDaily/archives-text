## 'Off' Issue Has Quiet Funeral; Buried In Daily 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
On November 17, a letter
from Richard E. Guggenhime,
President of the Board of Trus
tees, was buried on the second
page of The Stanford Daily. The
letter was written to Janet
Howell, leader of the "OFF!"
movement, and contained a
statement of the Board's archaic
policies regarding the "OFF!"
issue and other direct
ed toward the humanization of
the Stanford campus. A weak
article on the first page men
tioned Guggenhime's letter, but
the letter never had the impact
it could have had if it had been
placed in prime front page
space. <
Guggenhime's letter suffered
the fate common to all situation
with inherent explosive poten*
tial this year. It died a quiet
death with very few mourners
in attendance.
Filled with similar funerals,
the quarter has been a sad
spectacle to watch. There is the
potential for many constructive
, changes, even for the beginning
. • of development toward an in
dividual-oriented academic com
munity. The raw material is still
here. David Harris has expressed
the kind of ideas that have gen
'' erated more ideas among stu-
X dents. There may even remain
• an enthusiasm that could be
* channeled into action. And there

are issues that require strong
action.
But nothing has ignited. Noth
ing has really got the Univer
sity on fire — and that fire is
a prerequisite for the attain
ment of any of the major goals
that excited so many people last
spring when they were present
ed by David Harris, who caught
the imagination of concerned in
dividuals when as dangled be
fore their eyes visions of a vital
campus.
What's gone wrong? Why
hasn't anything happened? Un
fortunately, the ideas and vi
sions haven't been sufficiently
intensified to catalyze action,
caused the necessary impact
have been lacking.
The Daily should have been
one of these forces, and it de
serves to be admonished not for
what it's done this quarter but
for what it hasn't done. News
coverage has been adequate,
but a university newspaper
must be more than just a collec
tion of reportorial prose.
Through its editorial polity it
must be a major instrument
for positive change. This role
necessitates that the paper have
a cohesive philosophy — both of
itself and of the comunity it
serves.
It seems that the Daily has
neither. The only policy the
Daily has followed this quarter

is one of vacillation. Sometimes
it affirms. Sometimes it negates.
Sometimes it does both. Instead,
it must foist ideas upon the Uni*
yersity community, encourage
discussion of them (which it
can do by taking strong stands
— on either side of an issue),
and expedite synthesis and ac
tion on the part of the commu
nity.
Another force that has failed
i§ student government. David
Harris, had he been a leader,
could have precipitated much
more activity than he has. But
he has viewed himself more as
a stimulant. He has taken a
philosophical stand that does
not allow him to use his chari
sma as the tool it could be. This
may have been a mistake in
terms of tangible results.
There are ideas floating over
the campus — exciting and
workable ideas. There must be
a transformation within our
inadequate activating forces so
that the potential energy around
here can be converted Into
kinetic energy. But if we let
our complaints become a self
fulfilling prophesy of doom, we
will have wasted the year.

• Spirits Instilled
Editor, The Dally:
Representing the Department
of Physical Education and Ath
letics, I would like to publicly
commend the Stanford Band for
its tremendous performances
throughout the fall quarter, an<i
particularly the football season.
All the coaching staff and ad
ministrative staff of this De
partment join with me in expres
sion of appreciation.
The performances of the Stan
ford Band have been superb
even under several instances of
adverse conditions, and we are
very proud to take our "hats off"
to a group of dedicated young
men who have done much to in
still the Stanford spirit.

• This Ole House . . .
Editor, The Daily:
As the University strives for
greatness, the fate of the Phi
Delt House is yet unresolved:
What has become of the early
November suggestions .for an
educationel experiment in co-ed
living? What has become of the
goodhearted faculty willing to

participate in this attempt at
liberal social reform? Has the
idealism subsided to such an
extent that we might expect
the characteristic revelation
that economics has overpowered
progressive education? Has the
possibility of a "Stanford-in-
Stanford" gone by the balance
sheet?
So let us turn to the Flo Mo
mortgage. Will the rent of 15
girls, reinvested in the Phi Delt
House, upset the solvency of
University Residences? And —
might the increased enrollment
of women upset the delicate
ration?
Be sure to drop by the Phi
Delt House early next quarter
to see just who is living there!

• Freedom, To Associate
Editor, The Daily:
If a group of scientists, pub
lishing under a collective pseud
onym like "Giordano Bruno,"
"Cassius" or "Bourbake," de
cided to exhibit the statistical
evidence for Marxist theory, evi
dence which in their view con
firmed that theory, surely it
would be an invasion of aca
demic freedom to subpoena a
membership list of the group.
After all, many academics have
suffered greatly from engaging in

similar forms of social criticism.
Thorstein Veblen, C. Wright
Mills and Paul Baran are only
the first three names that come
to mind.
So this group of men might be
trying to protect themselves
from such possible repercussions
as loss of a job or loss of the
prospect of academic promotion.
Prof. Kaplan's recent letter to
The Daily strongly suggests
both that in this situation the
courts would brush aside as
softheaded any defense relying
on the idea of academic freedom
and that the university would
not be obligated to defend the
group's freedom of association.
But, Indiana courts, for ex
ample, could not brush the mat
ter aside, because one section of
that state's constitution begins,
"Knowledge and learning gen
erally diffused through a com
munity being essential to the

preservation of free govern
ment, . .
Second, it would be out of char
acter for a court containing
Douglas, Black or Warren to be
insensitive to such questions.
Certainly, they wouldn't be
swayed by the fact that aca
demic freedom isn't explicitly
mentioned in the Constitution;
for neither is freedom to travel
to foreign countries, to take only
one example, and two of these
justices have held recently that
restrictions on free travel vio
late the first amendment.
As for the moral question, the
fact that Prof. Kaplan does not
think that making membership
lists of such organizations priv
iliged information is something
universities should fight for,
only shows that he has no sense
of the university as an indepen
dent force in American life.
