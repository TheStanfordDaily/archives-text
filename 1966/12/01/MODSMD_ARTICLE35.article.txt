# Residential Experiment?
## 
### 
This University has long needed an alternative
to the poor choice of residences it now offers.
But year after year student requests for co
educational, cooperative, self-governing, or even
just low-priced and attractive housing have been
ignored by the administration.
Yesterday a perfect opportunity to reverse
this trend was rejected. The Committee on Un
dergraduate Education has decided to use the
house for an experiment with ten males from
each undergraduate class and six graduate
males living in. Coeducation was lost because
a false financial argument was accepted. Co
operative financial structure was deemed too
complicated. Unaccountably graduate students
were all but excluded from the program. Ran
dom selection fell victim to administrative
vagueness. And the academic part of the "ex
periment" was not even announced.
CUE had the benefit of several proposals
which worked out in detail the specific arrange
ments necessary for their implementation. These
reports were not considered by the whole com
mittee, however, but were given to former Dean
of Undergraduate Education, Robert Wert, who
read them and made one proposal to the Com
mittee. These student proposals, most of which
were more imaginative and far reaching than
the final plan, were not even given to the mem

hers of CUE when Wert's plan came up for ap
proval, thus leaving no chance to debate al
ternative proposals.
Wert cited a loss of $18,000 in revenue from
women's dorms as the reason for the rejection
of coeducational housing. The actual loss would
be close to a third or a fourth of the figure,
however, because transfer students could be ad
mitted to fill some of the vacancies, the rooms
in Lagunita now doing emergency service as
doubles could be returned to singles, and the
money lost in board bills would still be lost
under the approved plan. Even with the higher
figure, though the students and faculty who
worked to prepare the proposals could easily
have raised the money if they had been told it
would permit coeducation.
Perhaps the real reason coeducation was
dropped is slightly different: there is consider
able hesitancy in the administration, and espe
cially among those who have worked on the
project since its inception, to allow a coed
dormitory before Moore and Jacks houses open
in the fall of 1968. Stanford is at least ten
years behind most colleges in housing, however,
and coeducation has become well enough ac
cepted that even at Stanford it would be safe
to try it.

were all but excluded from the program. Ran
dom selection fell victim to administrative
vagueness. And the academic part of the "ex
periment" was not even announced.
CUE had the benefit of several proposals
which worked out in detail the specific arrange
ments necessary for their implementation. These
reports were not considered by the whole com
mittee, however, but were given to former Dean
of Undergraduate Education, Robert Wert, who
read them and made one proposal to the Com
mittee. These student proposals, most of which
were more imaginative and far reaching than
the final plan, were not even given to the mem

hers of CUE when Wert's plan came up for ap
proval, thus leaving no chance to debate al
ternative proposals.
Wert cited a loss of $18,000 in revenue from
women's dorms as the reason for the rejection
of coeducational housing. The actual loss would
be close to a third or a fourth of the figure,
however, because transfer students could be ad
mitted to fill some of the vacancies, the rooms
in Lagunita now doing emergency service as
doubles could be returned to singles, and the
money lost in board bills would still be lost
under the approved plan. Even with the higher
figure, though the students and faculty who
worked to prepare the proposals could easily
have raised the money if they had been told it
would permit coeducation.
Perhaps the real reason coeducation was
dropped is slightly different: there is consider
able hesitancy in the administration, and espe
cially among those who have worked on the
project since its inception, to allow a coed
dormitory before Moore and Jacks houses open
in the fall of 1968. Stanford is at least ten
years behind most colleges in housing, however,
and coeducation has become well enough ac
cepted that even at Stanford it would be safe
to try it.

This University has long needed an alternative
to the poor choice of residences it now offers.
But year after year student requests for co
educational, cooperative, self-governing, or even
just low-priced and attractive housing have been
ignored by the administration.
Yesterday a perfect opportunity to reverse
this trend was rejected. The Committee on Un
dergraduate Education has decided to use the
house for an experiment with ten males from
each undergraduate class and six graduate
males living in. Coeducation was lost because
a false financial argument was accepted. Co
operative financial structure was deemed too
complicated. Unaccountably graduate students
were all but excluded from the program. Ran
dom selection fell victim to administrative
vagueness. And the academic part of the "ex
periment" was not even announced.
