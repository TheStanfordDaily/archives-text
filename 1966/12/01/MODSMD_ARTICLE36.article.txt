# Overseas Campus Changes
## 
### 
The results of the Overseas Campus Directors'
Conference, held in Rome earlier this month,
provide an encouraging sign of better student
administration relations. While criticism of
the program has been something more than a
tempest in a teapot since the publication of the
Martindale Report, students and administrators
have by and large avoided the usual pattern
of obdurate student demands, followed by
closed reaction from the administration.
The Martindale Report, prepared last spring
by an ad hoc committee of the Overseas Cam
pus Board, was considered point by point at
the directors' meeting, and many of the final
recommendations paralleled the conclusions of
the student report. Rarely has a student report
received such careful and speedy attention.
The specific academic and social changes
suggested by the directors wfll serve to im
prove the quality of the overseas experience.
With flexibility in the offerings by American
and native faculty, students will have a greater
opportunity to tailor their academic programs
to fit particular interests. Just as a steady diet
of lecture courses becomes boring on Quad, so
too does it at an overseas campus. The intro
duction of the seminar option points up a
long overlooked opportunity to take advantage

of the limited enrollment. The ability to ad
just the academic load between fourteen and
eighteen units also provides definite advantages
to students.
The various recommendations of the direc
tors must be considered by the Dean's Office
and the Committee on General Studies. We
trust that the proposals will receive s>yift ap
proval. m
We would very much like to believe that the
spirit in which the overseas campus contro
versy was handled signifies a new trend in stu
dent-administration relations. Current debate
over social regulations, open house and aca
demic innovations would benefit greatly from
a similar approach. Constructive suggestion and
not dogmatic ultimatim was the essence of
the Martindale Report; considered response
and not closed reaction was the reply of the
directors and the Overseas Campus Office.
The directors' final recommendations indicate
that neither students nor administrators had a
monopoly of the best ideas and approaches
to the problems of the program. We gladly
note that in this instance student-administra
tion dialogue has produced a good deal more
than words.
