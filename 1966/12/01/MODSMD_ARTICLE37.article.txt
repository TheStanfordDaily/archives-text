# Legislature And Finances
## 
### 
ASSU finance is a matter of more than
$100,000. Since no one can major in accounting
at Stanford, this fact does not make many stu
dents hearts go pitter-patter.
But how this money is used is important.
New projects and traditional boards and com
missions depend upon ASSU funds. And be
cause this money comes out of tuition, surely
everybody cares how it is spent.
Even Legislature, the official spender of all
this, doesn't seem to care how it is spent.
At its last meeting it approved the appointment
of the Student Financial Manager as Chairman
of the Legislature Finance Committee. This is
both unwise and illegal.
The Student Financial Manager (SFM) is
an administrator of student monies. He reports
to the Student Body President, expedites Legis
lature's appropriations, and palliates the Dean
of Students, who oversees all.
As a paid administrator, he should know more
about student finance than anybody. And Leg
islature, knowing in its political heart of hearts
that knowledge is power, should always have
its own financiers to act as a check.
This is the whole reason for having a Finance
Committee. But it only works if the SFM
comes there both to advise and to be held ac
countable. The final power should rest with
Legislature and its knowledgable committee.

This is impossible if the Committee does not
even have the independence of its own chair
man. Any pretense of being an "expert" com
mittee is lost since it depends upon the SFM
for all its information.
The By-Laws did not intend the Student Fi
nancial Manager to be his own check and his
own balance. In fact, as we read them, the
appointment is illegal.
Section 8, 3b states: "This committee shall
consist of seven voting members including the
chairman. The Student Financial Manager shall
be an ex-officio member without vote on this
committee."
If the chairman must be a voting member,
and the SFM must not be, anyone with one of
the jobs is prohibited by statute from assuming
the other.
Terry Murphy, the SFM, is certainly a con
scientious officer. But he and the Association
will suffer if his conflicting roles are maintained.
And the precedent would be set, for abuse by an
irresponsible successor.
Murphy should resign immediately as Chair
man of the Finance Committee.
If Legislature cannot find a competent chair
man within its ranks, it does not deserve to be
the policy-making body of the Associated Stu
dents.
