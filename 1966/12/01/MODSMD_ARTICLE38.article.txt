# POORBAUGH'S POSITION
## Council Faces Dual Obligation 
### 
(Editor's note: Mr. Poorbaugh's
statement clarifies his views on
the role and responsibility of
the Judicial Council. Poorbaugh
is one of the ten council mem
bers.
The recent Daily series on the
Judicial Council induces a real
disgust toward the attitudes at
tributed to Council member Fred
Poorbaugh. The last straw was
the remark in Monday's Daily
that "our function (the Judicial
Council's) is only to protect the
interests of the community
against anti-social acts, to weed
out anti-social elements." This
image, coupled with other re
marks about publicizing nothing
and judging people on their re
morse, brings to mind the Star
Chamber, and makes me wonder
if this person should not be
removed from the Judicial Coun
cil.
If he is indeed there.
To set the record straight, The
Daily has allotted me this space
to present my own position as
to what I believe, and what I
said.
I believe that the Judicial
Council is primarily an educa
tive, not a punitive body.
When an act committed by a
Stanford student is judged a
violation of the Fundamental
Standards, it is important that
the students understand why the
act is considered wrong. The
Judicial Council has a respon
sibility to seek a response ap
propriate to this end, which is
educative and rehabilitative.
The Council has an obligation
also, to the community, to take
reasonable precaution against
the threat (if any) posed by the
defendant for future violation.
This threat is indicated in a
record of previous offenses, but

also by thÂ£ individual's attitude
toward his act.
Finally, the Council must fol
low proper procedure, to prevent
arbitrary action.
I am in favor of having the
proceedings of the Council made
public, except insofar that inter
feres with the functioning of the
Council, as expressed above.
Nothing should be released
which would reveal the identity
of the defendant, except at his
request. Released opinions
should be published in full, or
not at all. A judicial opinion is
not just a correlation of act and
penalty. The substance of the
opinion is what comes between
act and penalty (if any), and it
is impossible to omit part or
parts of this opinion and un
derstand it.
The divergence between what
I believe and what I have read
that I believed indicates that:
(1) I changed my beliefs rad
ically for a half-hour interview
with Miss Anderson two weeks
ago, (2) I am so incoherent as
to mislead her, in some cases
180 degrees, or (3) there was
some deficiency in the reporting.
I did not change my beliefs.
During the interview, on only
one occasion was a statement
made slowly, and repeated, so
that it could be taken down
exactly. This was my idea of the
value of the Fundamental Stan
dard, which ran correctly. Miss
Anderson, who does not know
shorthand, assures me that she
is able to take down paragraph
long statements, such as the
"weeding-out" remark, verbatim
from normal speech, and not
miss what is being said while
she is writing. Except for the
one quote, no attempt was made,
during or after the interview, to

verify any correlation between
what I said and what she wrote,
and later published as my exact
words.
Behind the words which ap
peared in print, I can remotely
see ideas I presented. For ex
ample, the danger that a full
release of facts concerning a

case could reveal the identity of
the defendant comes out as "If
we get too specific, everyone will
know Vhat's going on."
If I ever really said anything
like "our only function Is . . .
to week out anti-social ele
ments," then I must make public
apology. FRED POORBAUGH
