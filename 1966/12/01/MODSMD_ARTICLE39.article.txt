# In Glass Houses
## New Cause Stirs Acitivists; Barnes-Storming Planned 
### Robert E. Stone 
Winter Quarter is fast ap
proaching. It is the time of year
when campus activity grinds to
a shuddering halt. Although it
is a shorter quarter than the
present one, # it always appears
to go on forever.
In the past, Quarter
has been the ideal time for stu
dent activists to start shaking
up the status quo. "Write your
congressman" has been the
rallying cry, and parades and
demonstrations have 'been the
order of the day.
This coming winter presents a
new challenge to these students.
The status quo has not yielded
to their pressure, and their
congressmen, and perhaps even
they themselves, have become
tired of the never-ending string
of telegrams
New Rebel Banner
There is, however, a solution.
While it is well known that most
of these students have never
been to a football game, with
one notable exception, they are
all aware of Dr. Arthur Barnes
stirring arrangement of the
Star-Spangled Banner. This piece
of music must surely embody
everything that has been pro
tested for in the past, and every
thing that could be possibly pro
tested for in the future.
Even the everyday students at
Stanford feel that Dr. Barnes'
arrangement is something spe
cial, and they are proud that it
now belongs to them.
Dr. Barnes has made several
attempts to get his arrangement
published, but the stodgy mem
bers of New York's publishing
companies have refused to touch
it. They consider any arrange
ment of the Star-Spangled Ban
ner which is not in the tradi
tional form to be immodest, at
best, and seditious at worst.
Applause Bating
• Stanford students know, how
ever, that Dr. Barnes rendition
is perhaps the most emotional
they have ever heard. One need
only compare the applause that

follows a traditional rendition
to the applause that follows Dr.
Barnes'. The difference is
astounding. At Stanford, the stu
dents applaud for the piece, not
for the fact that it is over. •
The solution to these two
dilemmas, the activists' and Dr.
Barnes', are happily the same.
Every student should write his
or her congressman protesting
the lack of creativity displayed
in traditional renditions
Diverse Unity
Congressmen on both sides of
the aisle cannot fail to heed the
voices of 20,000 people raised
in favor of patriotism. The coun
ter-attack of the conservatives
Should keep the New-Left busy
for months. Dr. Barnes, the Stan
ford Band* and the students of
the Farm will all be able to sit
back and enjoy the glory derived
from supporting creativity with
out selfish motives.
