# Beta Chi's Draw System To Begin Winter Quarter
## 
### 
Beta Chi has decided to begin im
plementing its new system for choos
ing members by allowing 28 persons
to draw into the house at the be
ginning of winter quarter.
Only freshman men will not be
allowed to participate in the draw.
In compliance with University regu
lations on rush, Beta Chi will begin
to rush freshmen only at the same
time other fraternities do, usually
toward the middle of winter quarter,
ter.
By drawing in 28 new members
Beta Chi will be increasing its mem
bership to 83, which will be one less
than double the number of men liv

ing in the house.
According to Beta Chi Vice-Presi
dent Brad Zebal, this means that a
majority of Beta Chis will still be
living in, thus retaining the house's
status as a â€¢ traditional living group.
From January 4 to January 8, per
sons interested in membership will
appear at the house and obtain a card
for drawing. On January 9, a house
meeting will be held at which all the
cards will be rendered similar to an
observer who will randomly select 28
of them.
For the first quarter at least, all
new membership will be non-resi
dential.
