# Wert Defines 'House' Living Group
## 
### GEOFFREY STEVENS 
The vacated Phi Delt fraternity
house will be used in a group living
experiment winter quarter.
Prof. Robert Wert, working with
the Committee on Undergraduate Edu
cation, announced to The Daily that
an "interdisciplinary seminar" under
the direction of three to five profes
sors will be required for those living
in the house. The topic of the sem

inar and the professors teaching it
have not yet been chosen.
Ten male students from each un
dergraduate class and six male grad
uate students from different fields will
live in the house. Those students who
wish to stay in the Phi Delt house
"should submit their names to Dean
Robert Hind in the Education office.
Foreign students are encouraged to
apply.
If a large number of students do
apply, then selection will be done on a
random basis. Costs and rules will be
the same as for any university liv
ing group.
When asked about the experimental
aspects of the proposal for the Phi
Delt house, Wert replied that he is
interested in seeing how a course
being taken by all members of a liv
ing group affects the living group. He
added that students have voiced in
terest in interdisciplinary seminars
and that this will be an opportunity
to gauge student reaction to these
seminars.
• When asked how the proposed pro
gram for the new living group differs
from freshman dorms where all stu

dents take English and Western Civili
zation, Wert pointed out that the new
living group will not be limited to
one class.
The idea of a co-education living
group was rejected because the uni
versity would have lost $18,000 due to.
vacancies that would exist in girls'
dormitories. However, 15-20 women
will be allowed to take meals and the
seminar in the house. Female students
interested in participating in the pro

gram should also submit their names
to Dean Robert Hind.
Wert suggested the following pos
sible topics for the three unit sem
inar: "contemporary urban problems,"
"use or misuse of natural resources,"
"science and human problems." He
hopes that the faculty chairman of
the seminar will live in the house, and
that the professors and students will
participate in some form of house
government.

added that students have voiced in
terest in interdisciplinary seminars
and that this will be an opportunity
to gauge student reaction to these
seminars.
• When asked how the proposed pro
gram for the new living group differs
from freshman dorms where all stu

dents take English and Western Civili
zation, Wert pointed out that the new
living group will not be limited to
one class.
The idea of a co-education living
group was rejected because the uni
versity would have lost $18,000 due to.
vacancies that would exist in girls'
dormitories. However, 15-20 women
will be allowed to take meals and the
seminar in the house. Female students
interested in participating in the pro

gram should also submit their names
to Dean Robert Hind.
Wert suggested the following pos
sible topics for the three unit sem
inar: "contemporary urban problems,"
"use or misuse of natural resources,"
"science and human problems." He
hopes that the faculty chairman of
the seminar will live in the house, and
that the professors and students will
participate in some form of house
government.
