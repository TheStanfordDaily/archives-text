# LASSU To Consider Phi Delt House Uses
## 
### 
Problems of housing and represen
tation head a crowded agenda as
LASSU convenes tonight at 7:30 in
room 370.'
A resolution will be entered calling
for LASSU's opposition to the hous-.
ing plan approved by the Committee

on Undergraduate Education for the
vacated Phi Delt house. Under this
plan ten male students from each un
dergraduate class and six male stu
dents from different fields would live
in the house and participate in a
seminar. Sponsors of the bill will ask
LASSU to recommend that a more
meaningful use be found for the resi
dence.
A $400 appropriation for the admis
sions sub-committee, held over - from
last week, and two emergency appro
priations will be discussed.
First reading will be given a bill
seeking to abolish consideration of
units accumulated as a criterion for
serving on the Judicial Council. Dis
cussion will also be held on vacancies
in Graduate representation to the
Legislature.
Growing out of the October 20
LASSU resolution on Guaranteed
Stable Costs, an ad-hoc committee of
students and university officers has
been formed. The committee, headed
by resolution sponsor Craig Venator,
will explore the problem of how the
University can assist students in meet
ing the problems of rising tuition and
housing costs.
Other members of the committee
are University officials E. Howard
Brooks, Kenneth Cuthbertson, Dwight
B. Adams, Robert P. Huff, Douglas
Walker, and Michael Roberts.
Several positions on the committee
are open to interested students. Appli
cants should contact the ASSU office.
Areas of study will include the rea
sons for tuition and residence fee in
creases. discussions of current poli
cies of the University concerning fees,
an appraisal of the student's financial
problems, and an attempt to recom
mend new policies to meet the prob
lems. The committee will investigate
Guaranteed Stable Cost plans estab
lished at other schools and examine
their applicability to Stanford.
