# Undergrad TA's Would Stimulate Learning
## 
### ROBERTA CONLAN 
"Undergraduate seniors are a scholarly re
source for the University and I always believe
in using all your resources."
"I'm instinctively in favor of anything like
this. Students educate themselves as much as
they are educated by the faculty and in some
ways more."
These are some of the reactions by Stanford
faculty to the idea of using undergraduates
(seniors in particular) as discussion leaders
or tutors — a suggestion raised at a confer
ence of students, faculty, and administrators,
called this summer by ASSU President David
Harris.
The first statement was made by Robert
Sears, Dean of Humanities and Sciences, who
suggested a plan whereby the seniors would

conduct tutorial sessions with freshmen and
sophomores.
"From the standpoint of motivation, I think
seniors have a lot to rfret," Dean Sears said.
"But it would have to be carefully supervised
and highly selective."
Professor Gordon Wright of the History De
partment, whose statement is the second one
quoted above, favored a more natural senior
upperclassman relationship.
"The problem is in finding the right students
to take on the responsibility and in getting
other students to accept it. It would be a little
artificial (in the classroom), whereas in a liv
ing situation it would be more natural,"
Wright said.
In an experimental dorm, he said, if you had
a variety of highly motivated honors program
students (in physics, history, social thought,
etc.), "they could challenge each other over

dinner and look at their own subject more in
telligently."
Professor Joseph Pettit of Engineering said
this type of thing has been brought up before
and didn't think there was any "magic" in
the proposal.
He said he defends the general principle of
TA's, but "why would anyone throwing rocks
at the present system (of using graduate stu
dent's as TA's) accept going one step lower?"
"The whole thing depends on the avail
ability of qualified people, whether they're
seniors, graduates, or Ph.D's." Pettit said.
"Selection and supervision would be the es
sential ingredients."
Although Professor Pettit did not think the
idea would be too practical in the engineering
department, Professor Albert Guerard thought
it would be quite feasible in English.
"Anybody can teach anybody if he's quali

fled," Guerard said. "The problem is in finding
the people. The value of such a program would
be in breaking down a big course."
Guerard's Experiment
He said he tried something like this in Eng
lish 172 (Forms of the Modern Novel) this
quarter, but that it was entiroly voluntary
and not too many people took advantage of it.
Political Science Professor Charles Drek
meicr recalled using student lecturers in a
course in Contemporary Political Questions
about a year and a half ago.
The lectures were "different," he said. "With
people speaking from the heart and often
from personal experience, they tended to be
closer to sermons than lectures.
"But it gave the students a chance to an
swer me — if they thought I bent the evi
dence."

As for the basic idea Drekmeier said, "I
don't know that it's an unqualified good. There
would be some instances where students
would benefit and some where there'd be a lot
of confusion. I think the most immediate bene
fit would be for the one teaching.
"But perhaps older, more experienced un
dergraduates would be helpful to freshmen
and sophomores in the way we admit sponsors
as helpful."
Most of the faculty members interviewed
did not think the undergraduate teaching as
sistants should be allowed to do any grading,
but Dean Sears felt that the distance between
seniors and freshmen and spohomores was
sufficient to allow it.
All of them felt that some sort of recom
pense should be given, in the form of a salary
or in units of credit.
