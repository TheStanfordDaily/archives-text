talked to students and gives his im

By KIRK HANEN
BERKELEY — U.C. kicked off its
social season Wednesday at festivities
attended by more than two thousand
students and non-students.
By 6 p.m. Thursday the last of the
guests had left the party. The Berke
ley campus seemed almost deserted,
shut down tighter than most Texas
hamlets after sunset.
It was unfortunate that the party
turned into a brawl. The power elite
of both student and Administration
factions said things and made deci
sions they will regret. Once more the
jewel of the California state schools
aired its dirty laundry in public.
Savio Home
Mario Savio, who had been arrest
ed Wednesday and released on bail,
was home forgeting the role of non
student activist for a few hours. He
and his wife were helping their son
Steffan celebrate his first birthday —
one day late.
About 15 of the most active activists
were painting signs in the garage
below the student union, not sure
when they would be called into action
again.
The campus police were off being
brutal at the local basketball game.
I had to go to the police station in
the basement of Sproul Hall to find
one. There weren't any in sight. And
all the two hundred Alameda county
deputy sheriffs were gone too.
Back To Normal
Things were back to normal — or,
at least, as normal as they ever get in
these parts.
But some were still talking.
A freshman picketer from Carnaby
Street told me he was "kind of tired
of the Administration being able to
arbitrarily decide which non-campus,
non-student organizations are allowed
and which aren't. It seemed to be de
termined by the inner politics of the
Administration itself. And the stu
dent and faculty don't seem to have
much voice in it."
I asked the next interviewee — a
junior Social Science major, if she
had crossed any picket lines: "Yes,
because I don't, agree with anything
that is going on."
Why?
"Because there are so many aspects

to this problem that I don't think
anyone knows what it is all about."
Sho doesn't entertain any prejudices
about Mario Savio, though.
"So many of the students think he
is the greatest thing going. And he is,
as far as intelligence goes. He's as
close to a genius as I have ever seen.
Ho has quite a way of stimulating
people and generating interest."
Another picketer, who seemed to
be the leader of his group, was wear
ing a "PEOPLE MUST CONTROL
THEIR POLICE" button. He calmly
told me of police brutality.
Beaten Up
"I was beaten up Wednesday night
downstairs in the union. I was hit on
the back of the head with a billy club.
I was threatened several times with
gross bodily violence. I wasn't arrest
ed though, because they were only
after non-students."
What caused the demonstration?
"The Administration's position has
been quite unreasonable so far. They
recently made a statement that they
would bargain only with representa
tives of the ASUC. Several who wore
there tell me that the Administration
said it would not accept the bargain
ing committee which we set up last
night and which was ratified today on
the steps of Sproul Hall."
Some called the whole thing "a
matter of principle;" others "a mat
ter of Leftists wanting a confronta
tion."
Then there are always those who
can't be bothered, like the last stu
dent I talked to. He told me hadn't
attended classes that day.
Was it because of sympathies with
the strikers, or because of the picket
lines?
"Nope, I just overslept."

one day late.
About 15 of the most active activists
were painting signs in the garage
below the student union, not sure
when they would be called into action
again.
The campus police were off being
brutal at the local basketball game.
I had to go to the police station in
the basement of Sproul Hall to find
one. There weren't any in sight. And
all the two hundred Alameda county
deputy sheriffs were gone too.
Back To Normal
Things were back to normal — or,
at least, as normal as they ever get in
these parts.
But some were still talking.
A freshman picketer from Carnaby
Street told me he was "kind of tired
of the Administration being able to
arbitrarily decide which non-campus,
non-student organizations are allowed
and which aren't. It seemed to be de
termined by the inner politics of the
Administration itself. And the stu
dent and faculty don't seem to have
much voice in it."
I asked the next interviewee — a
junior Social Science major, if she
had crossed any picket lines: "Yes,
because I don't, agree with anything
that is going on."
Why?
"Because there are so many aspects

to this problem that I don't think
anyone knows what it is all about."
Sho doesn't entertain any prejudices
about Mario Savio, though.
"So many of the students think he
is the greatest thing going. And he is,
as far as intelligence goes. He's as
close to a genius as I have ever seen.
Ho has quite a way of stimulating
people and generating interest."
Another picketer, who seemed to
be the leader of his group, was wear
ing a "PEOPLE MUST CONTROL
THEIR POLICE" button. He calmly
told me of police brutality.
Beaten Up
"I was beaten up Wednesday night
downstairs in the union. I was hit on
the back of the head with a billy club.
I was threatened several times with
gross bodily violence. I wasn't arrest
ed though, because they were only
after non-students."
What caused the demonstration?
"The Administration's position has
been quite unreasonable so far. They
recently made a statement that they
would bargain only with representa
tives of the ASUC. Several who wore
there tell me that the Administration
said it would not accept the bargain
ing committee which we set up last
night and which was ratified today on
the steps of Sproul Hall."
Some called the whole thing "a
matter of principle;" others "a mat
ter of Leftists wanting a confronta
tion."
Then there are always those who
can't be bothered, like the last stu
dent I talked to. He told me hadn't
attended classes that day.
Was it because of sympathies with
the strikers, or because of the picket
lines?
"Nope, I just overslept."

BERKELEY — U.C. kicked off its
social season Wednesday at festivities
attended by more than two thousand
students and non-students.
By 6 p.m. Thursday the last of the
guests had left the party. The Berke
ley campus seemed almost deserted,
shut down tighter than most Texas
hamlets after sunset.
It was unfortunate that the party
turned into a brawl. The power elite
of both student and Administration
factions said things and made deci
sions they will regret. Once more the
jewel of the California state schools
aired its dirty laundry in public.
Savio Home
Mario Savio, who had been arrest
ed Wednesday and released on bail,
was home forgeting the role of non
student activist for a few hours. He
and his wife were helping their son
Steffan celebrate his first birthday —
