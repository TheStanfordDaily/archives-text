## 
### 
PARIS — President Charles De Gaulle made
a plea tonight for a united Europe to include
the Soviet Union. He posed the question of
whether there would now be a war in Viet
nam if Europe had been united.
De Gaulle spoke at a glittering state dinner
at the Elysee Palace in honor of Soviet Pre
mier Alexei N. Kosygin, who arrived this
morning for a nine-day state visit. Kosygin
was received with honors usually reserved for
a Chief of State, and special attention not
usually shown to a chief of government.
• Ex-Nazi Now Chancellor
BONN, Germany — Kurt Georg Kiesinger,
once a Nazi, was named Chancellor today to
head a government welding his Christian De
mocrats to the Social Democrats in a coalition
without precedent in West Germany. He
promptly named a cabinet with a Pro-French
tinge.
The Vice Chancellor will be Socialist Willy
Brandt, who ceased to be mayor of West Ber
lin when he was sworn into the cabinet. Brandt
also will hold the post of Foreign Minister and
thus may be able to brake any policy shift

toward France that might damage U.S. rela
tions.
As head of the Social Democratic Party,
Brandt is a strong advocate of firm ties with
Washington. His party has been the chief op
position to the ruling Christian Democrats
through the 17-year history of the Federal
Republic.
• Thant To Stay In U.N.
UNITED NATIONS — U Thant agreed to
night to be drafted for a new five-year term

Security Council sources said the council
will meet tomorrow morning to approve a
recommendation that he be given a new term,
and the 121-nation General Assembly will con
vene later in the day to ratify the council's
recommendations.
This set the stage for a formal end to 11
months of suspense over the intentions of the
57-year-old Burmese to remain in office. He
made known last January that he was con
sidering stepping down at the Expiration of
his current five-year term Nov. 3.
