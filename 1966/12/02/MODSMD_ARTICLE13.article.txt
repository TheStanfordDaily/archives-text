• Truce Not To Aid VC
WASHINGTON — U.S. officials discounted
today the possibility that Communist forces
will be able to take substantial military advan

tage of the forthcoming Christmas and New
Year truces in the war in Vietnam.
The question whether North Vietnamese and
Viet Cong combat troops would be able to re
group and move in additional forces and sup
plies while the guns are silent arose at a For
eign Policy Conference at the State Depart
ment attended by news reporters and editors.
The Viet Cong command ordered two-day
cease-fires at Christmas and the western New
Year. The United States and its allies agreed
to this and proposed a four-day lull on the
lunar New Year in February — traditionally
a major holiday for the Vietnamese and other
orientals.
• RFK: No FBI Birchers
NEW YORK — Senator Robert F. Kennedy,
has expressed opposition to members of the
John Birch Society and other extremist groups
serving with the FBI and the Secret Service,
in a statement published today.
"These agencies have special responsibilities
in the field of nat-ional security," he said, "and
... it does not seem to me to be wise to allow

members of any extremist group to serve on
them."
John Rousellot, Public Relations Director
of the John Birch Society, said in Los Angelqp
that it was "certainly no surprise that Senator
Kennedy would take the tack that he has in
this article."
• Speck Trial Moved
CHICAGO — Richard F. Speck's trial on
charges of murdering eight student nurs* i
will be held somewhere away from Chicago.
Judge Herbert C. Paschen, in granting a de
fense motion today for such a switch, said he
will announce Dee. 19 the county in which the
trial will be conducted.
Public Defender Gerald Getty, who repre
sents Speek, had asked for a change in sites
previously on grounds that the publicity tl *
crime received in the city where it occurred
would have an influence on Chicago jurors.
The eight victims were stabbed and strangl
ed, one by one, in their living quarters on
Chicago's south side July 14.
The coverage of the case by Chicago media,
Getty said, "created an unfair climate."
