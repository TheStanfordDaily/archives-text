# Kennedy Lab Studies Mental Illness
## 
### BEVERLY CORY 
Startling assertions indicate
that three per cent of the popu
lation of the United States is
afflicted with mental retardation.
While this is at best a "guesti
mate," the figure is large enough
to compel expanded efforts in
scientific and medical research.
With this in mind, the Stan
ford School of Medicine applied
for and received a grant of $1
million from the Joseph P. Ken
nedy, Jr., Memorial Foundation
in 1961-62. The gift was used to
build the Kennedy Laboratories
for Molecular Medicine on the
third floor of the new Clinical
Sciences Research Building, dedi
cated in May of this year.
Lt. Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr.,
for whom the laboratories were
named, was killed in action in
World War II while on a secret,
volunteer mission over the En
glish Channel. Lieutenant Ken
nedy's fondness for children has
inspired the Foundation to spon
sor research programs dedicated
to children's diseases, particu
larly mental retardation.
Nobel Laureate
Dr. Joshua Lederberg, winner
of the Nobel Prize in 1958 and
head of the Department of Ge
netics, directs the research and
educational activities of the lab
oratories. "Mental retardation is
one of the most compelling
challenges to the humanitarian
and social instincts of medicine,"
says Dr. Lederberg.
He maintains, "It is also one
of the most provocative chal
lenges to investigate insight and
experimentation across a broad
frontier of scientific studies. It
concerns the development of the
most complex of biological func
tions, the most highly evolved
organ of the body—the intelli
gent human brain."
Pediatrics, genetics, obstetrics,
and neurology are among the
main disciplines represented in
the program. Side by side with
skilled scientists in these fields,
medical students learn and prac
tice research in the basic labs
and see patients in the clinics.
Genetics
Dr. Lederberg coordinates the
Kennedy Laboratory studies be
ing done in gentics, which in
clude computer analysis of large
populations to determine eco
nomic, social, and seasonal pat

terns relating to mental retarda
tion.
Associate Professor Dr. Eric
Shooter is especially concerned
with the mechanisms of learn
ing and memory. He seeks to
learn how information is coded
and stored in the mind.
Heading lab work in pediatrics
are Dr. Norman Kretchmer, pro
fessor and executive head of
pediatrics, and Associate Pro
fessor Dr. Guy McKhann. Ani
mals and humans are studied
here in research on the develop
ing vervous system.
Dr. Frank Morrell leads neu
rological research in the labs.
Of particular interest in this
area is the development of the
learning system in normal and
abnormal children.
Child Service
The Pediatrics and Neurology
departments conduct many of
their studies in clinics at the
Medical Center, where research
progresses through service to
children afflicted with mental
retardation.
Activities in obstetrics, under
the department's executive head
and Professor, Dr. Charles Mc-
Lennan, and Assistant Profes
sor Dr. Robert Goodlin, are sim
ilarly oriented around clinical
work.
The Kennedy Foundation sup
plies a pool of floating funds
each year to help continue re
search and initiate new projects
in the laboratories. It has also
established faculty fellowships
around the country to support
professors interested in mental
retardation.
Dr. McKhann holds this honor
at Stanford as a Lt. Joseph P.
Kennedy, Jr., senior research
scholar.
Nervous System
Specific questions Dr. Mc-
Khann is investigating deal with
the developing nervous system.
Once it is discovered how neu
rones develop and how myelin,
the insulating material around
the nerve fiber, is formed, it will
be possible to study causes of de
fects which may occur at early
stages of growth.

Other causes for mental re
tardation are sought in research
done with individual retarded
children to determine specific
diseases and metabolic defects
which may affect normal devel
opment.
Work in the Kennedy Labora
tories extends beyond the medi
cal school to the community.

Doctors help train people for
service in centers of mentrJ
retardation and act as consul
tants to such centers.
Assistance goes to clinics as
close as the Children's Health
Council, a day-care center for
retarded children located on the
Stanford campus, and as far as
the Children's hospital of tip
East Bay in Oakland.

in 1961-62. The gift was used to
build the Kennedy Laboratories
for Molecular Medicine on the
third floor of the new Clinical
Sciences Research Building, dedi
cated in May of this year.
Lt. Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr.,
for whom the laboratories were
named, was killed in action in
World War II while on a secret,
volunteer mission over the En
glish Channel. Lieutenant Ken
nedy's fondness for children has
inspired the Foundation to spon
sor research programs dedicated
to children's diseases, particu
larly mental retardation.
Nobel Laureate
Dr. Joshua Lederberg, winner
of the Nobel Prize in 1958 and
head of the Department of Ge
netics, directs the research and
educational activities of the lab
oratories. "Mental retardation is
one of the most compelling
challenges to the humanitarian
and social instincts of medicine,"
says Dr. Lederberg.
He maintains, "It is also one
of the most provocative chal
lenges to investigate insight and
experimentation across a broad
frontier of scientific studies. It
concerns the development of the
most complex of biological func
tions, the most highly evolved
organ of the body—the intelli
gent human brain."
Pediatrics, genetics, obstetrics,
and neurology are among the
main disciplines represented in
the program. Side by side with
skilled scientists in these fields,
medical students learn and prac
tice research in the basic labs
and see patients in the clinics.
Genetics
Dr. Lederberg coordinates the
Kennedy Laboratory studies be
ing done in gentics, which in
clude computer analysis of large
populations to determine eco
nomic, social, and seasonal pat

terns relating to mental retarda
tion.
Associate Professor Dr. Eric
Shooter is especially concerned
with the mechanisms of learn
ing and memory. He seeks to
learn how information is coded
and stored in the mind.
Heading lab work in pediatrics
are Dr. Norman Kretchmer, pro
fessor and executive head of
pediatrics, and Associate Pro
fessor Dr. Guy McKhann. Ani
mals and humans are studied
here in research on the develop
ing vervous system.
Dr. Frank Morrell leads neu
rological research in the labs.
Of particular interest in this
area is the development of the
learning system in normal and
abnormal children.
Child Service
The Pediatrics and Neurology
departments conduct many of
their studies in clinics at the
Medical Center, where research
progresses through service to
children afflicted with mental
retardation.
Activities in obstetrics, under
the department's executive head
and Professor, Dr. Charles Mc-
Lennan, and Assistant Profes
sor Dr. Robert Goodlin, are sim
ilarly oriented around clinical
work.
The Kennedy Foundation sup
plies a pool of floating funds
each year to help continue re
search and initiate new projects
in the laboratories. It has also
established faculty fellowships
around the country to support
professors interested in mental
retardation.
Dr. McKhann holds this honor
at Stanford as a Lt. Joseph P.
Kennedy, Jr., senior research
scholar.
Nervous System
Specific questions Dr. Mc-
Khann is investigating deal with
the developing nervous system.
Once it is discovered how neu
rones develop and how myelin,
the insulating material around
the nerve fiber, is formed, it will
be possible to study causes of de
fects which may occur at early
stages of growth.

Other causes for mental re
tardation are sought in research
done with individual retarded
children to determine specific
diseases and metabolic defects
which may affect normal devel
opment.
Work in the Kennedy Labora
tories extends beyond the medi
cal school to the community.

Doctors help train people for
service in centers of mentrJ
retardation and act as consul
tants to such centers.
Assistance goes to clinics as
close as the Children's Health
Council, a day-care center for
retarded children located on the
Stanford campus, and as far as
the Children's hospital of tip
East Bay in Oakland.
Startling assertions indicate
that three per cent of the popu
lation of the United States is
afflicted with mental retardation.
While this is at best a "guesti
mate," the figure is large enough
to compel expanded efforts in
scientific and medical research.
With this in mind, the Stan
ford School of Medicine applied
for and received a grant of $1
million from the Joseph P. Ken
nedy, Jr., Memorial Foundation
in 1961-62. The gift was used to

inspired the Foundation to spon
sor research programs dedicated
to children's diseases, particu
larly mental retardation.
Nobel Laureate
Dr. Joshua Lederberg, winner
of the Nobel Prize in 1958 and
head of the Department of Ge
netics, directs the research and
educational activities of the lab
oratories. "Mental retardation is
one of the most compelling
challenges to the humanitarian
and social instincts of medicine,"
says Dr. Lederberg.
He maintains, "It is also one
of the most provocative chal
lenges to investigate insight and
experimentation across a broad
frontier of scientific studies. It
concerns the development of the
most complex of biological func
tions, the most highly evolved
organ of the body—the intelli
gent human brain."
Pediatrics, genetics, obstetrics,
and neurology are among the
main disciplines represented in
the program. Side by side with
skilled scientists in these fields,
medical students learn and prac
tice research in the basic labs
and see patients in the clinics.
Genetics
Dr. Lederberg coordinates the
Kennedy Laboratory studies be
ing done in gentics, which in
clude computer analysis of large
populations to determine eco
nomic, social, and seasonal pat

terns relating to mental retarda
tion.
Associate Professor Dr. Eric
Shooter is especially concerned
with the mechanisms of learn
ing and memory. He seeks to
learn how information is coded
and stored in the mind.
Heading lab work in pediatrics
are Dr. Norman Kretchmer, pro
fessor and executive head of
pediatrics, and Associate Pro
fessor Dr. Guy McKhann. Ani
mals and humans are studied
here in research on the develop
ing vervous system.
Dr. Frank Morrell leads neu
rological research in the labs.
Of particular interest in this
area is the development of the
learning system in normal and
abnormal children.
Child Service
The Pediatrics and Neurology
departments conduct many of
their studies in clinics at the
Medical Center, where research
progresses through service to
children afflicted with mental
retardation.
Activities in obstetrics, under
the department's executive head
and Professor, Dr. Charles Mc-
Lennan, and Assistant Profes
sor Dr. Robert Goodlin, are sim
ilarly oriented around clinical
work.
The Kennedy Foundation sup
plies a pool of floating funds
each year to help continue re
search and initiate new projects
in the laboratories. It has also
established faculty fellowships
around the country to support
professors interested in mental
retardation.
Dr. McKhann holds this honor
at Stanford as a Lt. Joseph P.
Kennedy, Jr., senior research
scholar.
Nervous System
Specific questions Dr. Mc-
Khann is investigating deal with
the developing nervous system.
Once it is discovered how neu
rones develop and how myelin,
the insulating material around
the nerve fiber, is formed, it will
be possible to study causes of de
fects which may occur at early
stages of growth.

Other causes for mental re
tardation are sought in research
done with individual retarded
children to determine specific
diseases and metabolic defects
which may affect normal devel
opment.
Work in the Kennedy Labora
tories extends beyond the medi
cal school to the community.

Doctors help train people for
service in centers of mentrJ
retardation and act as consul
tants to such centers.
Assistance goes to clinics as
close as the Children's Health
Council, a day-care center for
retarded children located on the
Stanford campus, and as far as
the Children's hospital of tip
East Bay in Oakland.
