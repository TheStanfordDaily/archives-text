### RENTON ROLPH 
A car-smashing session will
occur today at 11 a.m. in White
Memorial Plaza as a preview ol
Saturday night's Happening in
the Wiburness. Anyone can par
ticipate in the car-smashing for
free and the Happening for
$1.50.
There will be a second car
smash at the Happening in ad
dition to a multitude of other
destructive, creative, spiritual
and sensual activities.
Whatever one wants he will
probably find at the Happening,
starting tomorrow at 8 p.m. in
Wilbur Hall. Highlighting the
festival will be two hard-rock
bands: Big Brother and the
Holding Company and the more
Butterfleld-Blues oriented San
Andreas Fault Finders.
Gary Euing, who runs the
lightshows at the Avalon Ball
room in San Francisco, will
project glycerine, film and
strobe-light psychedelics to ac
company the bands. Euing has
often worked with Big Brother
and the Holding Company at
Avalon and the sound and light
harmony they have achieved is
wondrous.
The sensation of the San Fran
cisco State Happening, Bernard
Gunther, will conduct his sen
sory awareness experiments
that he has popularized recently
in the Big Sur area.
Chloe Scott, a professional
dancer, will sail through soft
music to achieve group kinesthe
tic awareness. And a number of
Stanford ballet dancers will per
form about the toilet-seat gal
lery in the Cedro Lounge.
Materials will be available for
those who want to create paper
mache statues and pastel-paint
pictures.
Music of all types will flood
the Wilburness. Mike Menke's
quartet will play alone and also
spark a jam-session for all
comers. The cools of cangas and
filutes will beckon all to wallow
in the womb room to realize pre
existence.
Henry Levinson, the organizer
of the Happening, has comment
ed on his creation to be: "We
want the Happening to be just
that, to happen, to come on
spontaneously, a fabulous joy.
We hope everyone will bring
whatever they can—a bottle, a
pin, a cork, or old shoe—to
trade with whomever they can.
The Happening is a swap-fair of
items and understanding."
