# In 'Boozeland': On-Campus Parties Disturb Faculty
## 
### RENTON ROLPH 
Stanford's new liquor policy may
not have changed the life of the aver
age campus drinker too drastically,
but it has caused decided and disturb
ing changes in the lives of his faculty
neighbors.
By far the most significant change
since last spring is that fraternities
now hold parties in their own houses
on campus. In past years, because of
the University liquor prohibition, fra
ternities invariably decided to give
their parties off campus.
Before April 25, 1966, no student
was permitted to drink alcohol on the
Stanford campus. This rule, then, pro
hibited graduate students as well as
over-21 undergraduates from consum
ing liquor in a state where they could
legally imbide.
Faculty Complaints
Now with fraternity parties on cam
pus in full force and volume, there

has been expression of faculty disap
proval over what many of them con
sider excessive noise and disturbance.
One professor and his wife, who re
side next to a fraternity, have called
the situation "unliveable." Faculty
families, upset after enduring electric
guitar uproars midnight upon mid
night, have sent letters of complaint
to Robert A. Walker, Chairman of the
Faculty Housing Committee. Another
faculty wife, a longtime Stanford re
sident, recently found it necessary to
call the University police for the first
time.
Stanford Police Chief Gordon R.
Davis, whose men have this year fre
quently responded to distress calls
from faculty homes, notes "some
change," although he does not consid
er the current situation "alarming."
He continued, "I hope the student
body reviews the liquor regulations

and that it has firm policies for avoid
ing violations."
President Drennen Jones of the In
ter-Fraternity Council does not feel
that more people are drinking than
before the change in the liquor po
licy. However, aware of faculty un
rest, he has urged fraternities to noti
fy their neighbors when a party is
scheduled. Bob Crowell, who heads
the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, which
has been involved in the furor, has
contacted and soothed his neighbors.
Crowell feels that "there has been a
definite increase in nightly noise."
However, accord was reached without
administrative intervention.
On Nov. 4 Dr. Walker's Faculty
Housing Committee met to consider
the issue and complaints. After the
proceedings one committeeman view
ed "in some people's minds, a definite
connection between the new liquor
law and noise on campus." The Com

mittee later decided to send a com
munique to the President's Office. On
Nov. 14 Prof. William R. Rambo com
posed the letter which stated: "An
intolerable situation of student-gen
erated noise and general disorder has
developed in the residential area. We
urge that quick arid effective mea
sures be taken to correct this prob
lem."
President Sterling has placed the
matter in Dean Winbigler's hands.
Despite the current noise-liquor
party problem, advantages of the new
policy are discernible. Assistant Chief
of University Police Thomas Bell com
ments that thei-e are probabaly fewer
accidents directly attributable to
drinking on campus now than before
the change. With parties on campus
there is little or no post-party driving.
Statistics, though, are presently un
available.
Local media heralded last April's

policy shift as Stanford's "bold step
into boozeland." Realistically, though,
liquor and the ensuing problems have
been with this University since its
founding. David Starr Jordan, Stan
ford's first President, recognized that
the frequency of liquor on campus
was mushrooming. And, although
many students were "coming in drunk
through the windows (of Encina Hall,
then a dorm) to sleep with their boots
on," Dr. Jordan was having a hard
time catching them.
'Boozers' in 1908
In 1908 the severity of the problem
became obvious to the entire commu
nity. Late on the night of Feb. 5, one
well-polluted Stanford student, return
ing from a Menlo Park soiree, enter
ed the wrong house in Palo Alto
which he thought was his own. Mis
taken for a burglar, he was shot to
death by the fearful resident.
Yet the specific problem of party

noise on campus has not existed be
fore in its present proportions. This
problem may be a direct result of the
introduction of legal liquor o"nto the
campus last spring. The problem can
also represent students' failure to as
sume necessary responsibility.
The new policy has affected areas
of campus life beyond the fraternity
living groups. Joe Higgins, the Direc
tor of Wilbur Hall, feels that the more
realistic liquor policy will alter fresh
men atitudes towards this year!s
rush. The openness with which fra
ternities now imbide has "destroyed
the "novelty of it (drinking)." Drink
ing no longer "plies on the student
conscience" as it might have earlier.
Now that the guilt has been legally
eliminated, much of the adventure
has gone out of the alcohol mania.
Realistic legislation might be on the
way to dethroning our national stu
porfaetaftt.
