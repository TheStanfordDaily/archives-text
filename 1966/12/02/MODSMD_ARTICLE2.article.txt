# LASSU Asks CUE To Effect Coed Housing
## 
### 
Legislature last night requested
that the Committee on Undergradu
ate Education (CUE) immediately re
consider including coeducation in the
Phi Delt house experiment.
Tim Haight, student CUE member,
reported that the argument used in
the committee for the exclusion of
women was that the University would
lose $18,000 because of the vacancies
created in the women's dorms.
Figures cited in the resolution esti
mated the loss to the University at
about $4000.
$500 Pledged
LASSU pledged $500 toward under
writing the University loss and prom
ised to solicit the remaining sum if
necessary. Legislative sponsor, Chris
Harte, said private donors and small
foundations could be approached for
the rest of the money. He cited the
appropriation as an indication of
LASSU support.
Contacted by The Daily after the
LASSU meeting last night, Associate
Dean of Undergraduate Education
Robert Hind said he had no choice
but to accept the business office fig
ures of $18,000 additional cost for
coeducational housing.
"Whether the cost would be $4000
or $18,000, I simply can't determine,"
he stated. "Either way, it's a lot of
money."
He said CUE did not consider the
addition of another coeducational pro
ject (besides the overseas campuses
and the proposed Moore Jacks) would
be worth the expenditure of this sum.
Cal Support Tabled
A resolution on Academic Freedom
in supporting the recent action taken
by Cal students was tabled after long
debate. The constitutionality of the
resolution was questioned under the
by-law limiting LASSU business to
affairs pertaining to Stanford. The
chair's ruling of its relevance to Stan
ford was upheld.
Proponents of the measure argued
:hat an attack on academic freedom
at another university becomes an at
tack on freedom of expression at
Stanford, "since we all exist in the
same tradition."
Speaking of the Berkeley incident,
Dave Harris said that it was "an act
by the University to control, not only
the area of speech, but also the con
tent of speech."
More Grads
The resolution on the Phi Delt
house experiment also requested that
CUE increase the number of gradu
ates to live in the house. CUE'S recom
mendation presently calls for 6 resi
dent graduates.
Hind stated that past experience
with graduate students in undergradu
ate housing had shown that from an
educational standpoint 6 graduate stu
dents was a reasonable number. He
added that usually it turned out that
the graduate students acted as ment
ors rather than participants in the
housing situation.
