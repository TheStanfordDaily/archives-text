# Vigil To Begin At Navy Depot
## 
### 
Bar Area professors, Including
many from Stanford, have announced
their intention to participate in a vigil
for peace at Port Chicago on Decem
ber 4.
The United States Naval Weapons
Station at Port Chicago — near Ra
fael — is a major depot for Vietnam
war material. A round-the-clock vigil
has been maintained at the station
since August 7 as a silent expression
of opposition to the war.
Professor Paul Wallin of the So
ciology Department, a member of the
Stanford Faculty and Staff Committee
for Peace in Vietnam, has helped or
ganize the movement at Stanford.
Among the many student marches
and sit-ins, this stands out as the first
organized all-faculty demonstration.
Protests Still Strong
"The group intends to demonstrate,"
said Professor Wallin, "that, contrary
to a recent column by James Reston
in the New York Times, the protest
movement on the country's campuses
has not subsided."
Stanford Professors David Levin
and Wilfred H. Stone of the English
Department and Charles Dreckmeier
of Political Science, with faculty mem
bers of Cal at Berkeley and San Fran
cisco State, have assumed leadership
in sponsoring the vigil.
Demonstrators will meet at the two
gates of the Weapons Station to con
tinue the protest from 1-4 p.m. No
activity or speeches have been plan
ned, and the vigil will not involve
civil disobedience.
An on-site press conference is sche
duled to draw attention to renewed
protests of the government's commit
ment to the war.
