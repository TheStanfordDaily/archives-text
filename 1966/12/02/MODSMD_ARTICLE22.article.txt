.... And the nameless shall be
named, and dedicated ....
That will be the state of affairs
for the new Undergraduate Library
today. Secretary of Health, Education,
and Welfare John W. Gardner will
give the convocation speech this after
noon in Dinkelspiel Auditorium at
4:15.
At the same time the donors of the
library, heretofore anonymous, will be
announced at the dedication cere
mony. Other speakers for the occasion
include President J. E. Wallace Ster
ling, and Dr. Rutherford D. Rogers,
Director of University Libraries.
The library was built with 5.2 mil
lion dollars donated to Stanford from
anonymous (until now) philanthrop
ists. Another million came from a
federal grant from the Department of
Health, Education, and Welfare.
Dedication invitations have been
accepted by a great number of
patrons of the library and others, so
that anyone wishing to attend the
ceremony may have to listen to the
speeches piped into room 270 of Tre
sidder.
The library was opened on the 21st
of Noyember, the earliest possible
opening for an already delayed date,
and was met with near-universal ap
proval of the student body.
The library has been designed pri
marily for the undergraduate stu
dents, although it has so far been open
to the Stanford community and the
general public.
The library has many new features
many of which are new to Stanford
libraries, and some of which are not
yet completed. They include:
• A book catalogue, replacing a
card catalogue. Every book has been
recorded on IBM cards and are cata
logued into two different sets of

books, one by author, one by subject
matter. These book catalogues will be
and some are distributed about the
campus in various locations.
• A snack lounge. Vending ma
chines and lounge furniture will pro
vide a smoking and eating area near
the main vestibule on the first floor.
• Six full time reference librarians.
Four reference areas located near the
four corners of each floor will have
book catalogues, other reference ma
terials, and a house phone direct to
the reference librarian on the second
floor.
• Series of pamphlets explaining
how to get the most out of reference
materials. The booklets will deal more
with what books are appropriate for
what uses than how these books are
used.
• Air-conditioning. The cooled air
in the new library is piped into the
rooms through narrow slits in the
ceiling to avoid excessive noise and
cold drafts.
• A new audio library. A listening
room with over 50 booths will be pro
vided on the main floor with a large
library of music and the spoken
word. Hopefully, it will be ready by
February, 1967.
• Four outdoor study decks. On the
fourth floor are four decks, which
will have furniture similar to the out
door furniture at Tresidder.
• More seating, carrels. 1500 seats
will be scattered throughout the li
brary in interesting and stylish ar
rangements.
