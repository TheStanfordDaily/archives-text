# Harris: All-American 'Reborn' As An Anti-President
## 
### CHARLES KITE 
Watching forlornly from a
cork noteboard on the presi
dent's office door in LASSU cor
ner, Charlie Brown philosophizes
from his pitcher's mound, "We
never win any ball games but
we sure have some interesting
discussions."
Inside the Tresidder cubicle re
clines the antithesis of a student
body president. "He never ran
with the intention of winning
and he didn't want the job after
he won," emphasizes his secre
retary, Susan Horst. President
Dave Harris would be the first
to concur. It seems he started
his campaign to generate discus
sion, but ended up leading it.
But however foreign the regu
lar hours and enforced routine
may be, President Harris comes
to his office religiously (if that
is the right word), and quickly
dispatches accumulated paper
work. He then adds more notes
to an already engagement-ob
scured wall calendar, while sip
ping coffee or smoking one of
his numerous Camels. For the
rest of his diurnal hour-in-resi
dence, he will discuss anything
with anybody who cares to
enter.
'Presence Of God'
Thus the ethos of an anti
president, grudgingly immersed
in his job, spreads about him.
Alumni feel goaded into writ

ing letters to The Daily, or mak
ing such snide asides as "He
would slouch in the presence
presence of God himself." To
which Harris retorts, "Yes, I
would slouch i nthe presence
of anybody." Crank letters are
a regular occurrence this year.
One such memo from an atro
phied mind called Harris' atten
tion to the "Good Virile Young
Men" he seemingly disparages.
And current campus campness
means looking in the 1963 Quad
to see how Dave Harris appeared
as a freshman.
Yet all these visions are nec
essarily shallow due to Har
ris' own confessed complexity.
He swept in, lanky frame hid
den in the drab folds of a rain
soaked Army issue trench coat,
discarding it to the ante-room.
The uncovered Harris was wear
ing his 'uniform,' wide black
leather belt, blue jeans, and
Navy denim work shirt. He
drapped himself into his chair,
immediately reclining. He asked
for his first cup of coffee while
reaching for a Danish pastry.
Rubbing his beard, boots out
stretched, he smiles broadly. "I
haven't stayed the same person
for more than a week." "Thank
God," remarked one of his
friends who had walked in. Har
ris would insist that his pres
ent image is in no way an "aber
ration of my true self. My grand

father used to be a union or
ganizer."
Wuh boots now propped up on
a slide out desk panel, Harris
related his freshman image to
the group that had settled into
his office. "I was a regular all-
American-frosh when I ar
rived, but I was reborn." His
friends variously gagged and
moaned over the final word,
coming from the usually elo
quent Harris. "'Reborn' — Oh,
David?" they chorused. But
Harris retorted, "It's the only
way to say it. 'Reborn.' "
Born for the first time on Feb
ruary 28, 1946, David Victor Har
ris was raised in Fresno, Calif.
His father is a lawyer. A friend
of Harris' since junior high in
Fresno, Bob Klein, comments,
"He was active throughout high
school in sports, playing football
for three years; his senior year
as varsity center." Continuing
his all-American imagery, Harris
was on the debating team, and
was president, for a term, of
the Fresno High Senate—an or
ganization which Klein points
out, "Is the oldest debating so
ciety west of the Mississippi."
Theater Group
Harris refers to the Senate
group retrospectively as "stag
ing kind of a show. Politics did
n't mean much, just games. No
body knew what they were do

ing." His only political involve
ment in high school was a Con
ference of American Friends on
civil rights.
The first deep look our presi
dent took of himself came dur
ing his freshman year. "My
first quarter, I ran around a lot,
down to San Jose to see the
Hell's Angels, and up to San
Francisco." Harris added, run
ning both hands through his
now close-cropped hair, "I didn't
date much, or call freshman
girls 'dollies." I did protect the
bonfire; I went to get drunk,
and then slept in the mud." That
comment brought laughter from
his friends, but was abruptly
squelched when Harris added,
twisting a corner of his mus
tache, "and the next morning
Kennedy was dead."
Ending his first quarter with
a "whopping 2.0" average David
Harris spent his next term as
a 'monk.' "I sometimes read 13
hours a day,"he remembers,
"Dwight Clark and Richard Roo
son were my greatest influence.
In Western Civ., they turned on
my mind."
Crucial Year
Mississippi and civil rights
where the largest national is

sues in 1963. But it wasn't until
his sophomore year, 1964, that
Dave Harris' activism increased.
He found a car leaving the next
morning for two weeks of a
house-to-house voter registration
drive in the South. Learning of
an extra seat available, he went
home and packed a bag, and left
the next morning for Mississip
pi. There he experienced, overt
hatred and bigotry for the first
time. His group was forced out
of openly hostile towns with
guns and knives. A friend was
waylayed and beaten. Harris
states simply of those two
weeks, "The Mississippi experi
ence blew my mind."
What put Harris over the ac
tivism top was Vietnam. This,
also in his sophomore year. With
slow intent, hands still in his
lap, he states, "I was never on
its side. I found that stopping
the war would bring out real so
cial problems for the U.S. A
whole social reconstruction
would be necessary." Moddiness
broken by a questioner, Harris
picked up speed, gestures and
now familiar mannerisms again,
as he discussed the wording of

the official proposal for the use
of the soon to be vacated Phi
Delt house.
Books also trace Harris'
evolvement. As a freshman, it
was James Joyce, and Eric
Fromm's "Escape from Free
dom." Now in his senior year,
Conrad, Faulkner, Nietsche, and
Garcia Larca predominate.
"They all come closer to under
standing man than anyone, in
their own strange fashion," ex
pounds Harris, hand on head,
when pressed for a similarity be
tween the authors. "Lorca is the
greatest poet I have ever read."
Harris is now seriously writing
poetry, and trying to keep up
with his painting, which was
his major avocation last year.
Muddy Waters
Music, especially folk blues, on
300-400 tapes, fills the house of
Harris and his roommates. Mis
sissippi John Hurt, Bob Dylan,
and Muddy Waters are his fav
orites. "That type of music is
real American culture," hums
Harris. "What is happening in
American is happening in the
slums. And you know, when
John Hurt died, nobody printed
a thing," he said, pointedly re
ferring to Chris Harte, Associate

Editor of The Daily, who sat
listening.
Dave Harris is still changing.
According to Bob Klein, whom
Dave defeated in a run off for
president last year, "Dave and I
discussed running together. We
found our own views now totally
diverse. To maintain our politi
cal integrity, we couldn't run
together."
To Dave Harris the past four
years have been used to throw
off his chackles. 'I' don't know
yet what I'm going to say 'yes'
to, but 1 do know what I'll say
'no' to.' And after a short dis
cussion on which luncheon in
vitation to accept, Dave Harris
and company left his office.
Watching forlornly from a

dent's office door in LASSU cor
ner, Charlie Brown philosophizes

300-400 tapes, fills the house of
Harris and his roommates. Mis
sissippi John Hurt, Bob Dylan,
and Muddy Waters are his fav
orites. "That type of music is
real American culture," hums
Harris. "What is happening in
American is happening in the
slums. And you know, when
John Hurt died, nobody printed
a thing," he said, pointedly re
ferring to Chris Harte, Associate

Editor of The Daily, who sat

Dave Harris is still changing.
According to Bob Klein, whom
Dave defeated in a run off for
president last year, "Dave and I
discussed running together. We
found our own views now totally
diverse. To maintain our politi
cal integrity, we couldn't run
together."
To Dave Harris the past four
years have been used to throw
off his chackles. 'I' don't know
yet what I'm going to say 'yes'
to, but 1 do know what I'll say
'no' to.' And after a short dis
cussion on which luncheon in
vitation to accept, Dave Harris
and company left his office.
Watching forlornly from a
cork noteboard on the presi
dent's office door in LASSU cor
ner, Charlie Brown philosophizes
from his pitcher's mound, "We
never win any ball games but
we sure have some interesting

Inside the Tresidder cubicle re
clines the antithesis of a student
body president. "He never ran
with the intention of winning
and he didn't want the job after
he won," emphasizes his secre
retary, Susan Horst. President
Dave Harris would be the first
to concur. It seems he started
his campaign to generate discus
sion, but ended up leading it.
But however foreign the regu
lar hours and enforced routine
may be, President Harris comes
to his office religiously (if that
is the right word), and quickly
dispatches accumulated paper
work. He then adds more notes
to an already engagement-ob
scured wall calendar, while sip
ping coffee or smoking one of
his numerous Camels. For the

'Presence Of God'
Thus the ethos of an anti
president, grudgingly immersed
in his job, spreads about him.
Alumni feel goaded into writ

ing letters to The Daily, or mak
ing such snide asides as "He
would slouch in the presence
presence of God himself." To
which Harris retorts, "Yes, I
would slouch i nthe presence
of anybody." Crank letters are
a regular occurrence this year.
One such memo from an atro
phied mind called Harris' atten
tion to the "Good Virile Young
Men" he seemingly disparages.
And current campus campness
means looking in the 1963 Quad
to see how Dave Harris appeared
as a freshman.
Yet all these visions are nec
essarily shallow due to Har
ris' own confessed complexity.
He swept in, lanky frame hid
den in the drab folds of a rain
soaked Army issue trench coat,
discarding it to the ante-room.
The uncovered Harris was wear
ing his 'uniform,' wide black
leather belt, blue jeans, and
Navy denim work shirt. He
drapped himself into his chair,
immediately reclining. He asked
for his first cup of coffee while
reaching for a Danish pastry.
Rubbing his beard, boots out
stretched, he smiles broadly. "I
haven't stayed the same person
for more than a week." "Thank
God," remarked one of his
friends who had walked in. Har
ris would insist that his pres
ent image is in no way an "aber
ration of my true self. My grand

father used to be a union or
ganizer."
Wuh boots now propped up on
a slide out desk panel, Harris
related his freshman image to
the group that had settled into
his office. "I was a regular all-
American-frosh when I ar
rived, but I was reborn." His
friends variously gagged and
moaned over the final word,
coming from the usually elo
quent Harris. "'Reborn' — Oh,
David?" they chorused. But
Harris retorted, "It's the only
way to say it. 'Reborn.' "
Born for the first time on Feb
ruary 28, 1946, David Victor Har
ris was raised in Fresno, Calif.
His father is a lawyer. A friend
of Harris' since junior high in
Fresno, Bob Klein, comments,
"He was active throughout high
school in sports, playing football
for three years; his senior year
as varsity center." Continuing
his all-American imagery, Harris
was on the debating team, and
was president, for a term, of
the Fresno High Senate—an or
ganization which Klein points
out, "Is the oldest debating so
ciety west of the Mississippi."
Theater Group
Harris refers to the Senate
group retrospectively as "stag
ing kind of a show. Politics did
n't mean much, just games. No
body knew what they were do

ing." His only political involve
ment in high school was a Con
ference of American Friends on
civil rights.
The first deep look our presi
dent took of himself came dur
ing his freshman year. "My
first quarter, I ran around a lot,
down to San Jose to see the
Hell's Angels, and up to San
Francisco." Harris added, run
ning both hands through his
now close-cropped hair, "I didn't
date much, or call freshman
girls 'dollies." I did protect the
bonfire; I went to get drunk,
and then slept in the mud." That
comment brought laughter from
his friends, but was abruptly
squelched when Harris added,
twisting a corner of his mus
tache, "and the next morning
Kennedy was dead."
Ending his first quarter with
a "whopping 2.0" average David
Harris spent his next term as
a 'monk.' "I sometimes read 13
hours a day,"he remembers,
"Dwight Clark and Richard Roo
son were my greatest influence.
In Western Civ., they turned on
my mind."
Crucial Year
Mississippi and civil rights
where the largest national is

sues in 1963. But it wasn't until
his sophomore year, 1964, that
Dave Harris' activism increased.
He found a car leaving the next
morning for two weeks of a
house-to-house voter registration
drive in the South. Learning of
an extra seat available, he went
home and packed a bag, and left
the next morning for Mississip
pi. There he experienced, overt
hatred and bigotry for the first
time. His group was forced out
of openly hostile towns with
guns and knives. A friend was
waylayed and beaten. Harris
states simply of those two
weeks, "The Mississippi experi
ence blew my mind."
What put Harris over the ac
tivism top was Vietnam. This,
also in his sophomore year. With
slow intent, hands still in his
lap, he states, "I was never on
its side. I found that stopping
the war would bring out real so
cial problems for the U.S. A
whole social reconstruction
would be necessary." Moddiness
broken by a questioner, Harris
picked up speed, gestures and
now familiar mannerisms again,
as he discussed the wording of

the official proposal for the use
of the soon to be vacated Phi
Delt house.
Books also trace Harris'
evolvement. As a freshman, it
was James Joyce, and Eric
Fromm's "Escape from Free
dom." Now in his senior year,
Conrad, Faulkner, Nietsche, and
Garcia Larca predominate.
"They all come closer to under
standing man than anyone, in
their own strange fashion," ex
pounds Harris, hand on head,
when pressed for a similarity be
tween the authors. "Lorca is the
greatest poet I have ever read."
Harris is now seriously writing
poetry, and trying to keep up
with his painting, which was
his major avocation last year.

Harris is now seriously writing
poetry, and trying to keep up

Muddy Waters
Music, especially folk blues, on
300-400 tapes, fills the house of
Harris and his roommates. Mis
sissippi John Hurt, Bob Dylan,
and Muddy Waters are his fav

real American culture," hums
Harris. "What is happening in
American is happening in the

John Hurt died, nobody printed

Editor of The Daily, who sat

Dave Harris is still changing.
According to Bob Klein, whom
Dave defeated in a run off for
president last year, "Dave and I
discussed running together. We
found our own views now totally
diverse. To maintain our politi
cal integrity, we couldn't run
together."
To Dave Harris the past four
years have been used to throw
off his chackles. 'I' don't know
yet what I'm going to say 'yes'
to, but 1 do know what I'll say
'no' to.' And after a short dis
cussion on which luncheon in
vitation to accept, Dave Harris
and company left his office.
Watching forlornly from a
cork noteboard on the presi
dent's office door in LASSU cor
ner, Charlie Brown philosophizes
from his pitcher's mound, "We
never win any ball games but
we sure have some interesting

Inside the Tresidder cubicle re
clines the antithesis of a student
body president. "He never ran
with the intention of winning
and he didn't want the job after
he won," emphasizes his secre
retary, Susan Horst. President
Dave Harris would be the first
to concur. It seems he started
his campaign to generate discus
sion, but ended up leading it.
But however foreign the regu
lar hours and enforced routine
may be, President Harris comes
to his office religiously (if that
is the right word), and quickly
dispatches accumulated paper
work. He then adds more notes
to an already engagement-ob
scured wall calendar, while sip
ping coffee or smoking one of
his numerous Camels. For the

'Presence Of God'
Thus the ethos of an anti
president, grudgingly immersed

Alumni feel goaded into writ

would slouch in the presence
presence of God himself." To
which Harris retorts, "Yes, I
would slouch i nthe presence
of anybody." Crank letters are
a regular occurrence this year.
One such memo from an atro
phied mind called Harris' atten
tion to the "Good Virile Young
Men" he seemingly disparages.
And current campus campness
means looking in the 1963 Quad
to see how Dave Harris appeared
as a freshman.
Yet all these visions are nec
essarily shallow due to Har
ris' own confessed complexity.
He swept in, lanky frame hid
den in the drab folds of a rain
soaked Army issue trench coat,
discarding it to the ante-room.
The uncovered Harris was wear
ing his 'uniform,' wide black
leather belt, blue jeans, and
Navy denim work shirt. He
drapped himself into his chair,
immediately reclining. He asked
for his first cup of coffee while
reaching for a Danish pastry.
Rubbing his beard, boots out
stretched, he smiles broadly. "I
haven't stayed the same person
for more than a week." "Thank
God," remarked one of his
friends who had walked in. Har
ris would insist that his pres
ent image is in no way an "aber
ration of my true self. My grand

father used to be a union or
ganizer."
Wuh boots now propped up on
a slide out desk panel, Harris
related his freshman image to
the group that had settled into
his office. "I was a regular all-
American-frosh when I ar
rived, but I was reborn." His
friends variously gagged and
moaned over the final word,
coming from the usually elo
quent Harris. "'Reborn' — Oh,
David?" they chorused. But
Harris retorted, "It's the only
way to say it. 'Reborn.' "
Born for the first time on Feb
ruary 28, 1946, David Victor Har
ris was raised in Fresno, Calif.
His father is a lawyer. A friend
of Harris' since junior high in
Fresno, Bob Klein, comments,
"He was active throughout high
school in sports, playing football
for three years; his senior year
as varsity center." Continuing
his all-American imagery, Harris
was on the debating team, and
was president, for a term, of
the Fresno High Senate—an or
ganization which Klein points
out, "Is the oldest debating so
ciety west of the Mississippi."
Theater Group
Harris refers to the Senate
group retrospectively as "stag
ing kind of a show. Politics did
n't mean much, just games. No
body knew what they were do

ing." His only political involve
ment in high school was a Con
ference of American Friends on
civil rights.
The first deep look our presi
dent took of himself came dur
ing his freshman year. "My
first quarter, I ran around a lot,
down to San Jose to see the
Hell's Angels, and up to San
Francisco." Harris added, run
ning both hands through his
now close-cropped hair, "I didn't
date much, or call freshman
girls 'dollies." I did protect the
bonfire; I went to get drunk,
and then slept in the mud." That
comment brought laughter from
his friends, but was abruptly
squelched when Harris added,
twisting a corner of his mus
tache, "and the next morning
Kennedy was dead."
Ending his first quarter with
a "whopping 2.0" average David
Harris spent his next term as
a 'monk.' "I sometimes read 13
hours a day,"he remembers,
"Dwight Clark and Richard Roo
son were my greatest influence.
In Western Civ., they turned on
my mind."
Crucial Year
Mississippi and civil rights
where the largest national is

sues in 1963. But it wasn't until
his sophomore year, 1964, that
Dave Harris' activism increased.
He found a car leaving the next
morning for two weeks of a
house-to-house voter registration
drive in the South. Learning of
an extra seat available, he went
home and packed a bag, and left
the next morning for Mississip
pi. There he experienced, overt
hatred and bigotry for the first
time. His group was forced out
of openly hostile towns with
guns and knives. A friend was
waylayed and beaten. Harris
states simply of those two
weeks, "The Mississippi experi
ence blew my mind."
What put Harris over the ac
tivism top was Vietnam. This,
also in his sophomore year. With
slow intent, hands still in his
lap, he states, "I was never on
its side. I found that stopping
the war would bring out real so

whole social reconstruction

Harris spent his next term as
a 'monk.' "I sometimes read 13

"Dwight Clark and Richard Roo

In Western Civ., they turned on
my mind."
Crucial Year
Mississippi and civil rights
where the largest national is

sues in 1963. But it wasn't until
his sophomore year, 1964, that
Dave Harris' activism increased.
He found a car leaving the next
morning for two weeks of a
house-to-house voter registration
drive in the South. Learning of
an extra seat available, he went
home and packed a bag, and left
the next morning for Mississip
pi. There he experienced, overt
hatred and bigotry for the first
time. His group was forced out
of openly hostile towns with
guns and knives. A friend was
waylayed and beaten. Harris
states simply of those two
weeks, "The Mississippi experi
ence blew my mind."
What put Harris over the ac
tivism top was Vietnam. This,
also in his sophomore year. With
slow intent, hands still in his
lap, he states, "I was never on
its side. I found that stopping
the war would bring out real so
cial problems for the U.S. A
whole social reconstruction
would be necessary." Moddiness
broken by a questioner, Harris
picked up speed, gestures and
now familiar mannerisms again,
as he discussed the wording of

the official proposal for the use
of the soon to be vacated Phi
Delt house.
Books also trace Harris'
evolvement. As a freshman, it
was James Joyce, and Eric
Fromm's "Escape from Free
dom." Now in his senior year,
Conrad, Faulkner, Nietsche, and
Garcia Larca predominate.
"They all come closer to under
standing man than anyone, in
their own strange fashion," ex
pounds Harris, hand on head,
when pressed for a similarity be
tween the authors. "Lorca is the
greatest poet I have ever read."
Harris is now seriously writing
poetry, and trying to keep up
with his painting, which was
his major avocation last year.
Muddy Waters
Music, especially folk blues, on
300-400 tapes, fills the house of
Harris and his roommates. Mis
sissippi John Hurt, Bob Dylan,
and Muddy Waters are his fav
orites. "That type of music is
real American culture," hums
Harris. "What is happening in
American is happening in the
slums. And you know, when
John Hurt died, nobody printed
a thing," he said, pointedly re
ferring to Chris Harte, Associate

Editor of The Daily, who sat
listening.
Dave Harris is still changing.
According to Bob Klein, whom
Dave defeated in a run off for
president last year, "Dave and I
discussed running together. We
found our own views now totally
diverse. To maintain our politi
cal integrity, we couldn't run
together."
To Dave Harris the past four
years have been used to throw
off his chackles. 'I' don't know
yet what I'm going to say 'yes'
to, but 1 do know what I'll say
'no' to.' And after a short dis
cussion on which luncheon in
vitation to accept, Dave Harris
and company left his office.
Watching forlornly from a
cork noteboard on the presi
dent's office door in LASSU cor
ner, Charlie Brown philosophizes
from his pitcher's mound, "We
never win any ball games but
we sure have some interesting
discussions."
Inside the Tresidder cubicle re
clines the antithesis of a student
body president. "He never ran
with the intention of winning
and he didn't want the job after
he won," emphasizes his secre
retary, Susan Horst. President
Dave Harris would be the first
to concur. It seems he started
his campaign to generate discus
sion, but ended up leading it.
But however foreign the regu
lar hours and enforced routine
may be, President Harris comes
to his office religiously (if that
is the right word), and quickly
dispatches accumulated paper
work. He then adds more notes
to an already engagement-ob
scured wall calendar, while sip
ping coffee or smoking one of
his numerous Camels. For the
rest of his diurnal hour-in-resi
dence, he will discuss anything
with anybody who cares to
enter.
'Presence Of God'
Thus the ethos of an anti
president, grudgingly immersed
in his job, spreads about him.
Alumni feel goaded into writ

ing letters to The Daily, or mak
ing such snide asides as "He
would slouch in the presence
presence of God himself." To
which Harris retorts, "Yes, I
would slouch i nthe presence
of anybody." Crank letters are
a regular occurrence this year.
One such memo from an atro
phied mind called Harris' atten
tion to the "Good Virile Young
Men" he seemingly disparages.
And current campus campness
means looking in the 1963 Quad
to see how Dave Harris appeared
as a freshman.
Yet all these visions are nec
essarily shallow due to Har
ris' own confessed complexity.
He swept in, lanky frame hid
den in the drab folds of a rain
soaked Army issue trench coat,
discarding it to the ante-room.
The uncovered Harris was wear
ing his 'uniform,' wide black
leather belt, blue jeans, and
Navy denim work shirt. He
drapped himself into his chair,
immediately reclining. He asked
for his first cup of coffee while
reaching for a Danish pastry.
Rubbing his beard, boots out
stretched, he smiles broadly. "I
haven't stayed the same person
for more than a week." "Thank
God," remarked one of his
friends who had walked in. Har
ris would insist that his pres
ent image is in no way an "aber
ration of my true self. My grand

father used to be a union or
ganizer."
Wuh boots now propped up on
a slide out desk panel, Harris
related his freshman image to
the group that had settled into
his office. "I was a regular all-
American-frosh when I ar
rived, but I was reborn." His
friends variously gagged and
moaned over the final word,
coming from the usually elo
quent Harris. "'Reborn' — Oh,
David?" they chorused. But
Harris retorted, "It's the only
way to say it. 'Reborn.' "
Born for the first time on Feb
ruary 28, 1946, David Victor Har
ris was raised in Fresno, Calif.
His father is a lawyer. A friend
of Harris' since junior high in
Fresno, Bob Klein, comments,
"He was active throughout high
school in sports, playing football
for three years; his senior year
as varsity center." Continuing
his all-American imagery, Harris
was on the debating team, and
was president, for a term, of
the Fresno High Senate—an or
ganization which Klein points
out, "Is the oldest debating so
ciety west of the Mississippi."
Theater Group
Harris refers to the Senate
group retrospectively as "stag
ing kind of a show. Politics did
n't mean much, just games. No
body knew what they were do

ing." His only political involve
ment in high school was a Con
ference of American Friends on
civil rights.
The first deep look our presi
dent took of himself came dur
ing his freshman year. "My
first quarter, I ran around a lot,
down to San Jose to see the
Hell's Angels, and up to San
Francisco." Harris added, run
ning both hands through his
now close-cropped hair, "I didn't
date much, or call freshman
girls 'dollies." I did protect the
bonfire; I went to get drunk,
and then slept in the mud." That
comment brought laughter from
his friends, but was abruptly
squelched when Harris added,
twisting a corner of his mus
tache, "and the next morning
Kennedy was dead."
Ending his first quarter with
a "whopping 2.0" average David
Harris spent his next term as
a 'monk.' "I sometimes read 13
hours a day,"he remembers,
"Dwight Clark and Richard Roo
son were my greatest influence.
In Western Civ., they turned on
