# Computer Center Plans Future
## 
### NANCY KAHN 
A recent concept in computer
systems known as "time shar
ing" will bring computers to 90
per cent of the University com
munity within five years, ac
cording to Edward A. Feigen
baum, director of Stanford's
Computation Center.
The computers will be used
through consoles — typewriters
and teletypewriters—which are
connected to the computer but
located anywhere on campus.
Dr. Feigenbaum hopes to see
consoles in all dorms, as well
as offices, classrooms, and
homes.
At first, use will be limited
to 30 consoles at one time, but
the Computation Center expects
to expand this limit to 60 and
then to 90 users simultaneously.
Pioneering 1 System
IBM's 360/ Model 67 Time
Sharing System is the computer
Stanford will acquire next year,
early in May. The University
will be one of the first in the

nation to pioneer the relatively
new concept.
Under the present computer
system, users often must wait
hours to have a program re
turned, only to find errors. With
the instant response provided
by time sharing, errors can be
located and corrected immedi
ately.
Present computers must go
through an entire program at
one time. The IBM 360/ Model
67, however, takes advantage of
the high speed of computers to
give many users the illusion of
receiving smiultaneous respon
ses.
View Work
Programmers will be able to
view the work of the computer
as it goes along, step by step.
They can see what happens to
the data, and if the results are
not the desired ones, they can
change or stop the program.
However, pioneering in the
development of a new computer
will also have its disadvantages
in the beginning. Programmers

will be faced with the inconveni
ence of converting to "new lan
guages."
Also, Dr. Feigenbaum expects
long response time and frequent
failures for several months, un
til the new system can be per
fected.
Other Expansion
The Computation Center is
also expanding its other facili
ties. SLAC will have a computer
for use in high energy physics,
theoretical work, data analysis,
and engineering design.
ACME, a computer for medi
cal research, will be ready for
service by the end of this year.
Also a time sharing system,
ACME will explore applications
of the computer to bio-medical
research, primarily laboratory
work.
The Administrative Services
Facility, another branch of the
Computation Center, does data
processing for university admin
istration. It will convert from
its own computer to the time
sharing system.

ties. SLAC will have a computer
for use in high energy physics,
theoretical work, data analysis,
and engineering design.
ACME, a computer for medi
cal research, will be ready for
service by the end of this year.
Also a time sharing system,
ACME will explore applications
of the computer to bio-medical
research, primarily laboratory
work.
The Administrative Services
Facility, another branch of the
Computation Center, does data
processing for university admin
istration. It will convert from
its own computer to the time
sharing system.
A recent concept in computer
systems known as "time shar
ing" will bring computers to 90
per cent of the University com
munity within five years, ac
cording to Edward A. Feigen
baum, director of Stanford's
Computation Center.
The computers will be used
through consoles — typewriters
and teletypewriters—which are
connected to the computer but
located anywhere on campus.
Dr. Feigenbaum hopes to see
consoles in all dorms, as well
as offices, classrooms, and
homes.
At first, use will be limited
to 30 consoles at one time, but
the Computation Center expects
to expand this limit to 60 and
then to 90 users simultaneously.
Pioneering 1 System
IBM's 360/ Model 67 Time
Sharing System is the computer
Stanford will acquire next year,
early in May. The University
will be one of the first in the

nation to pioneer the relatively
new concept.
Under the present computer
system, users often must wait
hours to have a program re
turned, only to find errors. With
the instant response provided
by time sharing, errors can be
located and corrected immedi
ately.
Present computers must go
through an entire program at
one time. The IBM 360/ Model
67, however, takes advantage of
the high speed of computers to
give many users the illusion of
receiving smiultaneous respon
ses.
View Work
Programmers will be able to
view the work of the computer
as it goes along, step by step.
They can see what happens to
the data, and if the results are
not the desired ones, they can
change or stop the program.
However, pioneering in the
development of a new computer
will also have its disadvantages
in the beginning. Programmers

will be faced with the inconveni
ence of converting to "new lan
guages."
Also, Dr. Feigenbaum expects
long response time and frequent
failures for several months, un
til the new system can be per
fected.
