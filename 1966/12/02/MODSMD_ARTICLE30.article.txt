A-Side for the last three years
in a row. Coach Pete Kmetovic
will enter two Stanford teams in
the tourney. Three teams from
Delta Tau Delta will also be
groveling for the top spot.

UCLA Enters Tourney
UCLA heads the list of
teams from Southern California
n the Seven-A-Side.
As the name of the tourna
ment suggests, teams consist of
seven men. Seven-A-Side games
tend to be a more wide-open and
fast moving game than the
standard 15-man contests.
Kmetovic's ruggers line up
about half as undergraduate
football players and the rest on
the other side of the BA. Play
ers from Australia, New Zea
land, and South Africa put the
bloated Stanford ball into inter
national hands.
Mike Grace of Australia was

the flashy man on the Stanford
rugby field last year, domina
ting the Tribe scoring with
runs and penalty kicks. Dick
Ragsdale gives the Indians two
potent scoring threats.
Frank Pattitucci and Bob
Newbery both return to the
breakaway positions they han
dled so smoothly last season.
Tim Abena and Bob Blunt will
play this season, but Kmetovic
is still short of backs.
