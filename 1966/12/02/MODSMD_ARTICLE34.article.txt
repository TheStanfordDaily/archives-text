# Freshman Harriers Finish Third In Tahoe Invitational
## 
### 
Stanford's freshman cross
country runners fought the un
usual environment of cold
weather and high altitude to a
third place finish in the Lake
Tahoe invitational meet last Sat
urday.
The freshmen ran unattached
against all comers, which in
cluded varsity runners from all
over the West. Utah won the
meet with Idaho State second.
Coach Jerry Barland said that
these teams are among the
finest in the West. He also said
that the teams that had trained
above 4000 feet had a definite
advantage over the teams that
had trained at sea level since
Lake Tahoe is at 6000 feet.

Greg Brock led the Stanford
runners as he placed twelfth in
the field. He was followed by
Sterling Speirn and Dave Red
wine.
Barland said that the fresh
men continued to display the
spirit and courage that had
made them one of the best
freshman teams in Stanford's
cross country history.
Despite all the disadvantages
they faced, the runners still put
forth good effort and in so do
ing, gained valuable experience
in running at that high altitude.
This was the last scheduled
meet for the Indians, but they
will now begin to participate in
weekly all-comers meets.
