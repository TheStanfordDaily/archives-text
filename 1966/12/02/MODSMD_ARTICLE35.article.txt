# Borchers, Vogelpohl Key For San Jose Wrestling Triumphs
## Daily Sports 
### NICK SELBY 
Wrestling Captain Len Borch
ers will lead a determined group
of 18 grapplers to San Jose to
morrow to compete in the tenth
annual San Jose St. Northern
California Invitational Tourna
ment.
Borchers, a 152 pounder who
recently won the Daly City AAU,
represents Stanford's best
chance to get an individual title.
Strong and exceptionally quick,
Borchers has the moves to dazzle
the 14 other teams in the varsity
division.
Poly — Obstacle
Borcher's road to a champion
ship is blocked by a national
small college champion from last
year, A 1 Downing from Cal Poly
at San Luis Obispo, which along
with Fresno St. will be entering
what their coaches call "our best
teams ever."
Stanford will enter ten men in

the Varsity division, eight in the
freshman novice division. Match
es will be only six minutes in
length compared to the normal
eight.
Glory Trio
Another warrior carrying
coach Jerry Budzik's hopes for a
team title onto the mat will be
junior 147 pounder John Suttle,
who placed second in the AAU
meet at Daly City and won the
freshman - novice division two
years ago.
Suttle has a large obstacle in
another Cal Poly man of national
prominence, Bill Miller, who was
second in the small college na
tionals at 145 last year.
160 pounder Bill Vogelpohi
completes a 147 - 152 - 160 trio
which should grab most of the
Cards' glory this year. Vogelpohi
won the only wrestle-off for a
varsity position against Doug
Gunesch.
He scored a take-down in the
first period and a reverse in the
third, and racked up four minutes
of riding time for a 6-0 decision.

167 pounder Burt Ambler rep
resents experience hungry for
success. Bud Hollingbery at 177
and Rick Lindsley at heavy
weight, two returnees from last
year, are joined by newcomer
Terry Crenshaw at 191.
Sophomore Sensations
Three sophomores, all with ex
perience from last year's fresh
man novice team which won the
division for Stanford last year,
carry the lightweight responsibi
lities for the Tribe. They are
John Tam at 115, Rocky Carroll,
at 123, and Gerald Beaudoin at

137. The team still needs a man
at 150 pounds.
These sophomores are typical
of the wrestlers Coach Budzik is
trying to create: all are in fan
tastic shape from the eighteen
minutes of wrestling and wind
sprints each day.
All have largely remodeled
their wrestling style to fit the
new emphasis on takedowns and
riding, picking up a few new
moves which they have drilled to
perfection.
Frosli Lack Three
The freshman team will be at
a severe disadvantage in that it
lacks men at 115, 191, and heavy
weight. Coach Dave Reed looks
for a strong showing from the
entire team, and sees two men,
Rick Smith at 147 and Bill Ross

at 177 as having excellent shots
at taking titles.
Among the other teams enter
ing men in both the freshman
and varsity divisions are Sai:
Jose, Chico St., California at Ber
koley, San Francisco State, Sac
ramento State, and Humbolt
State.

what their coaches call "our best

Stanford will enter ten men in

the Varsity division, eight in the
freshman novice division. Match
es will be only six minutes in
length compared to the normal
eight.
Glory Trio
Another warrior carrying
coach Jerry Budzik's hopes for a
team title onto the mat will be
junior 147 pounder John Suttle,
who placed second in the AAU
meet at Daly City and won the
freshman - novice division two
years ago.
Suttle has a large obstacle in
another Cal Poly man of national
prominence, Bill Miller, who was
second in the small college na
tionals at 145 last year.
160 pounder Bill Vogelpohi
completes a 147 - 152 - 160 trio
which should grab most of the
Cards' glory this year. Vogelpohi
won the only wrestle-off for a
varsity position against Doug
Gunesch.
He scored a take-down in the
first period and a reverse in the
third, and racked up four minutes
of riding time for a 6-0 decision.

167 pounder Burt Ambler rep
resents experience hungry for
success. Bud Hollingbery at 177
and Rick Lindsley at heavy
weight, two returnees from last
year, are joined by newcomer
Terry Crenshaw at 191.
Sophomore Sensations
Three sophomores, all with ex
perience from last year's fresh
man novice team which won the
division for Stanford last year,
carry the lightweight responsibi
lities for the Tribe. They are
John Tam at 115, Rocky Carroll,
at 123, and Gerald Beaudoin at

137. The team still needs a man
at 150 pounds.
These sophomores are typical
of the wrestlers Coach Budzik is
trying to create: all are in fan
tastic shape from the eighteen
minutes of wrestling and wind
sprints each day.
All have largely remodeled
their wrestling style to fit the
new emphasis on takedowns and
riding, picking up a few new
moves which they have drilled to
perfection.
Frosli Lack Three
The freshman team will be at
a severe disadvantage in that it
lacks men at 115, 191, and heavy
weight. Coach Dave Reed looks
for a strong showing from the
entire team, and sees two men,
Rick Smith at 147 and Bill Ross

at 177 as having excellent shots
at taking titles.
Among the other teams enter
ing men in both the freshman
and varsity divisions are Sai:
Jose, Chico St., California at Ber
