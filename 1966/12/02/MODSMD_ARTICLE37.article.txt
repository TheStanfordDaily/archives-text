# Impromtu Guffaws At 'Illegit Theater'
## 
### DAVE HAKKEN 
The Illegitimate Theatre at the Tangent In Palo Alto presents a
fresh approach to improvisational theater. Two-thirds of the mate
rial presented each night is taken directly from audience or cast
suggestion, and is done without rehearsal.
The resulting presentation is not always as polished as the work
of the Committee in San Francisco, and yet, as one of the members
of the Illegitimate troupe commented, "Since the type of improvisa
tions which we present demand audience participation, the audience
is more likely to be ready to help us create enjoyable theater and is
willing to help pull through the rough areas of the production."
Characteristically, the evening at the Tangent begins with an
informal introduction of all the people present, including the mem
bers of the audience. Philip Schultz, leader and by far the outstand
ing actor of the troupe, then introduces the first scenes, which have
been chosen from previously successful work, before the course of

the performance is placed into
the hands of the audience.
Extensive Spontaneity
The extensive spontaneity de
manded by the theater some
times leads to failure. Some of
the ideas suggested by the audi
ence just cannot be successfully
presented, and, unfortunately,
one only knows this after an
attempt has been made. It is the
moments of the success of this
spontaneity, however, which
present a form of creation un
like usual drama and which
make a trip to the Illegitimate
worthwhile.
The demands of authentic im
promptu theater — timing, con
trol of expression, and a real
sense of the mood of an audi
ence—are tremendous and at
times overwhelming, but the
greater output of work neces
sary only insures the bigger
success of this talented group.
The best impromptu actor of
the troupe was Philip Schultz.
His control of facial expression
alone was most enjoyable. More
important was his ability to
sense just when the audience
was about ready to grasp the
intent of a scene, and, in that
moment, Mr. Schultz was able
to make the comment or proj
ect the one expression which
spells the success of impromptu
• humor.
Barry Adds Humor
The work of Ray Barry at
times approached the levels of
Mr. Schultz. Often presenting a
wry counter to the exploding
characterizations created by
Schultz, Barry was often able
to supply the comment of re
versal which supplied additional
humor.
The most disappointing parts
\ of the show seemed to be the
attempts to prove once again
' that the stock situations of the
- psychiatrist and his patient or
*( the boring party, so overtreated
; by the Saturday Evening Post.
are really funny. The actors had
greater success with new ele
i ments, either extremely current
such as those often presented
by members of the audience, or
- something like the scene, prob
ably the high point of the show,
' presenting an interview be
; tween a six-year-old boy played
by Schultz and the first grade
' guidance counselor, played by
* DeVera Marcus. In these scenes,
one could sense the command of
j the impromptu theater that be
- longs to this troupe.
Can't Be Lazy
Attending a performance of
the Illegitimate Theater on a
Friday or Saturday evening is
1 not an easy, lackadaisical accom
l plishment. Often one feels that
he is taking just as large a part
in the presentation as those ac
-5 tually on the risers, which in at
* t least one case, included a mem
•• ber of the audience.
: It is the ability to create this
'* involvement, however, that is
* the real strength of the Illegiti
•; mate Theatre and puts this pre
i sentation into an area different
; from conventional forms of
' theater.
