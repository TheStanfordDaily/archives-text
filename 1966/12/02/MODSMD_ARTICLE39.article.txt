# A 						Success For SRT One-Acts
## 
### BRUCE MERRY 
Harold Pinter: A Slight Ache
with Slavomir Mrozec: Out At
Sea (Little Theater, Stanford.)
Pinter and Mrozec, both born
in 1930, represent the avant
garde of the Absurdist Theatre
in England and Poland respecti
vely. The Stanford Repertory
Company has taken a short one
act play by each and produced a
highly entertaining evening.
Pinter's play is taut, frighten
ing, a study in psychological dis
integration; Mrozek's "Out At
Sea" has the same economy of
character, the same stark absurd
ity of situation, but includes
mordent social satire.
"A Slight Ache" portrays a
typical, upper middle-class Eng
lish couple on a warm summer
afternoon: they are having tea
on a neatly laid table in their
garden. A wasp flies into Flora's
tea-cup; they exterminate it. Ed
ward is vaguely interested in
theology; Flora fusses around
him. Gilbert Green and Jane
Hoffman create the restless, dis
satisfied atmosphere very effec
tively. Green is popous, snap
py, dignified; Miss Hoffman
gives us the faded, frustrated
wife of indeterminate age.
All is changed by a filthy, old
match-seller who irrates Edward
by standing at the foot of his
garden. Flora invites him in, but
neither she nor Edward can make
him say a word. Edward is at first
civil; then nettled by the old
man's silence, he becomes pee
vish. Soon Edward begins to
panic; and the situation becomes
charged and tense as he brings
up topics of conversation. Does
the match-seller realize that a
country lane isn't the most
•booming market for his wares?
What about cricket—"fiine game

cricket"—does the match-seller
remember cricket in the old
days? Africa —how about Af
rica? "... fascinating country,
do you know it?"
Edward disintegrates visibly.
Pacing up and down the room,
his face twitching, his fingers
trembling, unable to bear the old
man's silence any longer, he rush
es into the garden. Now it is
Flora's turn; Miss Hoffman
plays the part with a prodding,
agitated nervousness. She is
strained and febrile, while coax
ing the match-seller. She whines
about her youth; how she was
raped by a poacher when out
riding: "It was my first canter
unchaperoned."
Soon Flora kneels by the
match-seller and opens his jer
sey. She feels for his vest: "I'm
not tickling, am I?" Edward re
turns and completes their ruin.
Both Edward and Flora have laid
themselves bare before their re
pulsive, speechless guest.
This performance is a tour-de
force of psychological bravura
by the two main actors, Green
and Hoffman. A difficult and sta
tic play, "A Slight Ache" was
carried off with great sensitively.
World Premiere
Morzec's "Out At Sea," given
its world premiere public perfor
mance last Wednesday, is less
subtle, more immediate, more
striking. Fat, Medium and Small
are three sympathetic characters
floating along on a raft in the
sea. They dangle their shoeless
feet over the sides of a wooden
table on the stage An hour's ac
tion takes place on a single table
top; only the most accomplished
acting could have kept the au
dience's attention so firmly fixed
on this theatrical absurdity. The
absurdity comes off completely.

Fat, Medium and Small are hung
ry. What should they do? Eat.
Eat who? One of themselves, ob
viously. Which one? They draw
lots; everything must be demo
cratic.
The famished trio conduct a
secret ballot and, of course, an
electioneering campaign. Fat and
Medium make things pretty un
comfortable for Small. He was
not an orphan, like them, so it is
only fair that he should be eaten.
But a postman swims by with a
Special Delivery for Small: his
mother has died. Now he is an
orphan, too.
Fat, played by Paul Winfield at
his fluent, unctuous best, persu
ades Small to sacrifice himself
all the same. The stove is lit, the
table set, it only remains to wash
Small's feet and then they can
eat him. In comic scenes of great
intensity all the fatuous conven
tions of formal table manners
are observed on the raft.
Mr. Richards, as Medium, was
hilariously amusing as a fellow
traveler and a complacent canni
bal. He is a natural clown, pick
ing at his toes, peering through
his binoculars at a passing sea
gull, tucking a large white nap
kin into his collar as he gets
ready to eat his friend. Small,
played by Jerome Raphel, who
also did the wordless match-sell
er earlier in the evening, was a
study of touchy, injured victimi
zation.
It is a great credit to Mr. Vos'
direction that he has kept both
these plays, which could have
been stagnant or fallen complete
ly flat, both witty and lively.
Playing through December 10 at
8:30 nightly, the Stanford Reper
tory Theatre productions of "A
Slight Ache", and "Out At Sea"
makes for a splendid evening.

makes for a splendid evening.
Harold Pinter: A Slight Ache
with Slavomir Mrozec: Out At
Sea (Little Theater, Stanford.)
Pinter and Mrozec, both born
in 1930, represent the avant
garde of the Absurdist Theatre
in England and Poland respecti
vely. The Stanford Repertory
Company has taken a short one
act play by each and produced a
highly entertaining evening.
Pinter's play is taut, frighten
ing, a study in psychological dis
integration; Mrozek's "Out At
Sea" has the same economy of
character, the same stark absurd
ity of situation, but includes
mordent social satire.
"A Slight Ache" portrays a
typical, upper middle-class Eng
lish couple on a warm summer
afternoon: they are having tea
on a neatly laid table in their
garden. A wasp flies into Flora's
tea-cup; they exterminate it. Ed
ward is vaguely interested in
theology; Flora fusses around
him. Gilbert Green and Jane
Hoffman create the restless, dis
satisfied atmosphere very effec
tively. Green is popous, snap
py, dignified; Miss Hoffman
gives us the faded, frustrated
wife of indeterminate age.
All is changed by a filthy, old
match-seller who irrates Edward
by standing at the foot of his
garden. Flora invites him in, but
neither she nor Edward can make
him say a word. Edward is at first
civil; then nettled by the old
man's silence, he becomes pee
vish. Soon Edward begins to
panic; and the situation becomes
charged and tense as he brings
up topics of conversation. Does
the match-seller realize that a
country lane isn't the most
•booming market for his wares?
What about cricket—"fiine game

cricket"—does the match-seller
remember cricket in the old
days? Africa —how about Af
rica? "... fascinating country,
do you know it?"
Edward disintegrates visibly.
Pacing up and down the room,
his face twitching, his fingers
trembling, unable to bear the old
man's silence any longer, he rush
es into the garden. Now it is
Flora's turn; Miss Hoffman
plays the part with a prodding,
agitated nervousness. She is
strained and febrile, while coax
ing the match-seller. She whines
about her youth; how she was
raped by a poacher when out
riding: "It was my first canter
unchaperoned."
Soon Flora kneels by the
match-seller and opens his jer
sey. She feels for his vest: "I'm
not tickling, am I?" Edward re
turns and completes their ruin.
Both Edward and Flora have laid
themselves bare before their re
pulsive, speechless guest.
This performance is a tour-de
force of psychological bravura
by the two main actors, Green
and Hoffman. A difficult and sta
tic play, "A Slight Ache" was
carried off with great sensitively.
World Premiere
Morzec's "Out At Sea," given
its world premiere public perfor
mance last Wednesday, is less
subtle, more immediate, more
striking. Fat, Medium and Small
are three sympathetic characters
floating along on a raft in the
sea. They dangle their shoeless
feet over the sides of a wooden
table on the stage An hour's ac
tion takes place on a single table
top; only the most accomplished
acting could have kept the au
dience's attention so firmly fixed
on this theatrical absurdity. The
absurdity comes off completely.

Fat, Medium and Small are hung
ry. What should they do? Eat.
Eat who? One of themselves, ob
viously. Which one? They draw
lots; everything must be demo
cratic.
The famished trio conduct a
secret ballot and, of course, an
electioneering campaign. Fat and
Medium make things pretty un
comfortable for Small. He was
not an orphan, like them, so it is
only fair that he should be eaten.
But a postman swims by with a
Special Delivery for Small: his
mother has died. Now he is an
orphan, too.
Fat, played by Paul Winfield at
his fluent, unctuous best, persu
ades Small to sacrifice himself
all the same. The stove is lit, the
table set, it only remains to wash
Small's feet and then they can
eat him. In comic scenes of great
intensity all the fatuous conven
tions of formal table manners
are observed on the raft.
Mr. Richards, as Medium, was
hilariously amusing as a fellow
traveler and a complacent canni
bal. He is a natural clown, pick
ing at his toes, peering through
his binoculars at a passing sea
gull, tucking a large white nap
kin into his collar as he gets
ready to eat his friend. Small,
played by Jerome Raphel, who
also did the wordless match-sell
er earlier in the evening, was a
study of touchy, injured victimi
zation.
It is a great credit to Mr. Vos'
direction that he has kept both
these plays, which could have
been stagnant or fallen complete
ly flat, both witty and lively.

8:30 nightly, the Stanford Reper

Slight Ache", and "Out At Sea"
makes for a splendid evening.
Harold Pinter: A Slight Ache
with Slavomir Mrozec: Out At
Sea (Little Theater, Stanford.)
Pinter and Mrozec, both born
in 1930, represent the avant
garde of the Absurdist Theatre
in England and Poland respecti
vely. The Stanford Repertory
Company has taken a short one
act play by each and produced a
highly entertaining evening.
Pinter's play is taut, frighten
ing, a study in psychological dis
integration; Mrozek's "Out At
Sea" has the same economy of
character, the same stark absurd
ity of situation, but includes
mordent social satire.
"A Slight Ache" portrays a
typical, upper middle-class Eng
lish couple on a warm summer
afternoon: they are having tea
on a neatly laid table in their
garden. A wasp flies into Flora's
tea-cup; they exterminate it. Ed
ward is vaguely interested in
theology; Flora fusses around
him. Gilbert Green and Jane
Hoffman create the restless, dis
satisfied atmosphere very effec
tively. Green is popous, snap
py, dignified; Miss Hoffman
gives us the faded, frustrated
wife of indeterminate age.
All is changed by a filthy, old
match-seller who irrates Edward
by standing at the foot of his
garden. Flora invites him in, but
neither she nor Edward can make
him say a word. Edward is at first
civil; then nettled by the old
man's silence, he becomes pee
vish. Soon Edward begins to
panic; and the situation becomes
charged and tense as he brings
up topics of conversation. Does
the match-seller realize that a
country lane isn't the most
•booming market for his wares?
What about cricket—"fiine game

cricket"—does the match-seller
remember cricket in the old
days? Africa —how about Af
rica? "... fascinating country,
do you know it?"
Edward disintegrates visibly.
Pacing up and down the room,
his face twitching, his fingers
trembling, unable to bear the old
man's silence any longer, he rush
es into the garden. Now it is
Flora's turn; Miss Hoffman
plays the part with a prodding,
agitated nervousness. She is
strained and febrile, while coax
ing the match-seller. She whines
about her youth; how she was
raped by a poacher when out
riding: "It was my first canter
unchaperoned."
Soon Flora kneels by the
match-seller and opens his jer
sey. She feels for his vest: "I'm
not tickling, am I?" Edward re
turns and completes their ruin.
Both Edward and Flora have laid
themselves bare before their re
pulsive, speechless guest.
This performance is a tour-de
force of psychological bravura
by the two main actors, Green
and Hoffman. A difficult and sta
tic play, "A Slight Ache" was
carried off with great sensitively.
World Premiere
Morzec's "Out At Sea," given
its world premiere public perfor
mance last Wednesday, is less
subtle, more immediate, more
striking. Fat, Medium and Small
are three sympathetic characters
floating along on a raft in the
sea. They dangle their shoeless
feet over the sides of a wooden
table on the stage An hour's ac
tion takes place on a single table
top; only the most accomplished
acting could have kept the au
dience's attention so firmly fixed
on this theatrical absurdity. The
absurdity comes off completely.

Fat, Medium and Small are hung
ry. What should they do? Eat.
Eat who? One of themselves, ob
viously. Which one? They draw
lots; everything must be demo
cratic.
The famished trio conduct a
secret ballot and, of course, an
electioneering campaign. Fat and
Medium make things pretty un
comfortable for Small. He was
not an orphan, like them, so it is
only fair that he should be eaten.
But a postman swims by with a
Special Delivery for Small: his
mother has died. Now he is an
orphan, too.
Fat, played by Paul Winfield at
his fluent, unctuous best, persu
ades Small to sacrifice himself
all the same. The stove is lit, the
table set, it only remains to wash
Small's feet and then they can
eat him. In comic scenes of great
intensity all the fatuous conven
tions of formal table manners
are observed on the raft.
Mr. Richards, as Medium, was
hilariously amusing as a fellow
traveler and a complacent canni
bal. He is a natural clown, pick
ing at his toes, peering through
his binoculars at a passing sea
gull, tucking a large white nap
kin into his collar as he gets
ready to eat his friend. Small,
played by Jerome Raphel, who
also did the wordless match-sell
er earlier in the evening, was a
study of touchy, injured victimi
zation.
It is a great credit to Mr. Vos'
direction that he has kept both
these plays, which could have
been stagnant or fallen complete
ly flat, both witty and lively.
Playing through December 10 at
8:30 nightly, the Stanford Reper
tory Theatre productions of "A
Slight Ache", and "Out At Sea"
makes for a splendid evening.
