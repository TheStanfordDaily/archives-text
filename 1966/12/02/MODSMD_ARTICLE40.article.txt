# Letters To The Editor
## Formula For A Coup 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
With all the revolutionary
spirit and the lack of desire to
use the established channels of
government, I should like to
propose to all those interested a
coup d'etat to establish a new
form of government. Before ex
plaining exactly what I mean, I
should like to explain why such
a change would be a propos.
First, the students and facul
ty have very little say about the
future plans of the university
until they either become paying
alumni or University adminis
trators. Second, the present
form of student government has
very little responsibility in the
Stanford community and thus
acts and speaks accordingly ir
responsibly. Third, there are
very few channels of communi
cation between the student
body, the faculty, the adminis
tration, the alumni, and the
trustees. Fourth, the apathy
within and between the above
groups prevents anyone from
being a real spokesman for the
Stanford community on any is
sue (it has become a publicity
contest).
Fifth, there is no means for
various University groups to de
fend their purpose of dignity
unless they organize rallies (not
dignified) or write letters to The
Daily (subject to editorial cen
sorship). Lastly, the bureau
cracy of University organiza
tions prevents all members of
the University community from
being aware of their purposes,
plans, and functions.
What I propose is that all
forms of the present University
government and administration
be dissolved, and a number of
committees be formed of all the
members of the community to
devise a community govern
ment, a democracy, which would
be suited to Mr. Stanford's will.
I do not know what kind of
government that this would be,
but that is for the community
to decide. I would hope that
this group would have a great
deal of responsibility and a sys
tem of checks and balances, so
that all plans in physical plant
and policy would be representa
tive of community desires and
that the community would be
influential in their implementa
tion. I would also hope that
there would be a decent news
media to relate pertinent com
munity actions and activities to
the community. Responsibility
would also eliminate much of
the clowning and buffoonery
which has been associated with
this community recently. Per
haps the apathy circulating
could be changed to construc
tive action. The community
could give its own opinions,
rather than having a bunch of
factionalized University spokes
men expressing their own opin
ions as University opinion.
Perhaps the community does
not want responsibility and a
chance to become equitable and
democratic, but if the commu
nity were to back such action I
am sure that it could be done.
After all, it is our University.

Editor, The Daily:
As one who has a high regard
for The Daily, I am deeply dis
appointed that your report and
headline on my recent article

about student revolt should have
been so misleading. My article,
appearingly current in a num
ber of religious journals, was an
attempt to explain and defend
the current undergraduate con
cern with rebellion. In a 14 page
manuscript, at least a dozen
pages were almost lavishly sup
portive of current student con
cern to bring about change in
our educational procedures.
Only at the very end did I cite
some problems that I felt were
being overlooked. By drawing
almost exclusively from that
small portion of the essay, and
taking it completely out of con
text, your report conveys an im
pression that is precisely the op
posite of what the article as a
whole is saying.
ROBERT McAFEE BROWN
(Editor's Note: The following
quotation from Dr. Brown's arti
cle clarifies his position: "There
is an uncomfortably large dose
of truth behind each item on the
complaint list. The revolting
student feels tliat as a part of
the university, he should have
some share in the decisions the
university makes, particularly
since the decisions are bound to
affect him."
"Part, indeed, of the adult
restiveness in the face of stu
dent revolt is surely based on
the disturbing accuracy with
which the younger generation
has unmasked the pretentious
ness and insecurity of the old
er.")

Editor, The Daily:
If Dean Wert and CUE want
ed to cover the University's fi
nancial loss in the Phi Delt ex
pulsion, for God's sake, why
didn't they simply suggest that
the house be used as a men's
dormitory for the rest of the
year?
In my mind, the present "ex
periment" takes us students for
fools. Are we supposed to jump
at the chance to study for six
months anything that the Ad
ministration can get five or six
professors to teach? We really
need not go to such lengths in
order for Dean Wert to see how
such an "interdisciplinary"
scheme will work. I think even
I can tell him—it will fail. And
it will fail because students are
not mental-electrical appliances
that can be plugged-in for what
ever "experiment" you please.
If the Administration is ap
palled at the thought of losing
$18,000, just think how sickened
they will be if no one signs on
for the "House"—all those dor
mitory fees lost. I favor a cam
paign of "organized indiffer
ence" against this latest plan (I
think, at last, a form of protest
suited to the Stanford temper
ment). We might even get Mr.
David Harris, who seems to be
waiting this year for the peo
ple's revolution, to lead us in
our reverse boycott. And our
slogan might be something like:
"Jus' keep buying what you've
always been buying."

Editor, The Daily:
I watched the performance of
your student body president,
Dave Harris, on KQED last
night. In comparison with the
student body president of UC,
and with representatives from

Hunter's Point and other ghet
tos, Harris appeared dull, unin
spired, ignorant, and, of course,
physically revolting. His main
comments: "I've been to Missis
sippi." Big Deal. And"I live in
a ghetto, East Palo Alto." Again,
Big Deal.
The interests of Stanford
University would be better
served if this arrogant and im
mature young man would be
sent home to his parents, with
the suggestion that they admin
ister a good spanking, but only
after his diapers are removed.

Editor, The Daily:
I watched the performance of
your student body president,
Dave Harris, on KQED last
night. In comparison with the
student body president of UC,
and with representatives from

Hunter's Point and other ghet
tos, Harris appeared dull, unin
spired, ignorant, and, of course,
physically revolting. His main
comments: "I've been to Missis
sippi." Big Deal. And"I live in
a ghetto, East Palo Alto." Again,
Big Deal.
The interests of Stanford
University would be better
served if this arrogant and im
mature young man would be
sent home to his parents, with
the suggestion that they admin
ister a good spanking, but only
after his diapers are removed.
R. W. WELLS, IVLD. '41
Editor, The Daily:
With all the revolutionary
spirit and the lack of desire to
use the established channels of
government, I should like to
propose to all those interested a
coup d'etat to establish a new
form of government. Before ex
plaining exactly what I mean, I
should like to explain why such
a change would be a propos.
First, the students and facul
ty have very little say about the
future plans of the university
until they either become paying
alumni or University adminis
trators. Second, the present
form of student government has
very little responsibility in the
Stanford community and thus
acts and speaks accordingly ir
responsibly. Third, there are
very few channels of communi
cation between the student
body, the faculty, the adminis
tration, the alumni, and the
trustees. Fourth, the apathy
within and between the above
groups prevents anyone from
being a real spokesman for the
Stanford community on any is
sue (it has become a publicity
contest).
Fifth, there is no means for
various University groups to de
fend their purpose of dignity
unless they organize rallies (not
dignified) or write letters to The
Daily (subject to editorial cen
sorship). Lastly, the bureau
cracy of University organiza
tions prevents all members of
the University community from
being aware of their purposes,
plans, and functions.
What I propose is that all
forms of the present University
government and administration
be dissolved, and a number of
committees be formed of all the
members of the community to
devise a community govern
ment, a democracy, which would
be suited to Mr. Stanford's will.
I do not know what kind of
government that this would be,
but that is for the community
to decide. I would hope that
this group would have a great
deal of responsibility and a sys
tem of checks and balances, so
that all plans in physical plant
and policy would be representa
tive of community desires and
that the community would be
influential in their implementa
tion. I would also hope that
there would be a decent news
media to relate pertinent com
munity actions and activities to
the community. Responsibility
would also eliminate much of
the clowning and buffoonery
which has been associated with
this community recently. Per
haps the apathy circulating
could be changed to construc
tive action. The community
could give its own opinions,
rather than having a bunch of
factionalized University spokes
men expressing their own opin
ions as University opinion.
Perhaps the community does
not want responsibility and a
chance to become equitable and
democratic, but if the commu
nity were to back such action I
am sure that it could be done.
After all, it is our University.

As one who has a high regard
for The Daily, I am deeply dis
appointed that your report and
headline on my recent article

about student revolt should have
been so misleading. My article,
appearingly current in a num
ber of religious journals, was an
attempt to explain and defend
the current undergraduate con
cern with rebellion. In a 14 page
manuscript, at least a dozen
pages were almost lavishly sup
portive of current student con
cern to bring about change in
our educational procedures.
Only at the very end did I cite
some problems that I felt were
being overlooked. By drawing
almost exclusively from that
small portion of the essay, and
taking it completely out of con

If Dean Wert and CUE want

didn't they simply suggest that
the house be used as a men's
dormitory for the rest of the
year?
In my mind, the present "ex

fools. Are we supposed to jump
at the chance to study for six
months anything that the Ad
ministration can get five or six
professors to teach? We really
need not go to such lengths in
order for Dean Wert to see how
such an "interdisciplinary"
scheme will work. I think even
I can tell him—it will fail. And
it will fail because students are
not mental-electrical appliances
that can be plugged-in for what
ever "experiment" you please.

If Dean Wert and CUE want
ed to cover the University's fi
nancial loss in the Phi Delt ex
pulsion, for God's sake, why
didn't they simply suggest that
the house be used as a men's
dormitory for the rest of the
year?
In my mind, the present "ex
periment" takes us students for
fools. Are we supposed to jump
at the chance to study for six
months anything that the Ad
ministration can get five or six
professors to teach? We really
need not go to such lengths in
order for Dean Wert to see how
such an "interdisciplinary"
scheme will work. I think even
I can tell him—it will fail. And
it will fail because students are
not mental-electrical appliances
that can be plugged-in for what
ever "experiment" you please.
If the Administration is ap
palled at the thought of losing
$18,000, just think how sickened
they will be if no one signs on
for the "House"—all those dor
mitory fees lost. I favor a cam
paign of "organized indiffer
ence" against this latest plan (I
think, at last, a form of protest
suited to the Stanford temper
ment). We might even get Mr.
David Harris, who seems to be
waiting this year for the peo
ple's revolution, to lead us in
our reverse boycott. And our

"Jus' keep buying what you've

I watched the performance of
your student body president,
Dave Harris, on KQED last
night. In comparison with the
student body president of UC,
and with representatives from

Hunter's Point and other ghet
tos, Harris appeared dull, unin
spired, ignorant, and, of course,
physically revolting. His main
comments: "I've been to Missis
sippi." Big Deal. And"I live in
a ghetto, East Palo Alto." Again,
Big Deal.
The interests of Stanford
University would be better
served if this arrogant and im
mature young man would be
sent home to his parents, with
the suggestion that they admin
ister a good spanking, but only
after his diapers are removed.
R. W. WELLS, IVLD. '41
Editor, The Daily:
With all the revolutionary
spirit and the lack of desire to
use the established channels of
government, I should like to
propose to all those interested a
coup d'etat to establish a new
form of government. Before ex
plaining exactly what I mean, I
should like to explain why such
a change would be a propos.
First, the students and facul
ty have very little say about the
future plans of the university
until they either become paying
alumni or University adminis
trators. Second, the present
form of student government has
very little responsibility in the
Stanford community and thus
acts and speaks accordingly ir
responsibly. Third, there are
very few channels of communi
cation between the student
body, the faculty, the adminis
tration, the alumni, and the
trustees. Fourth, the apathy
within and between the above
groups prevents anyone from
being a real spokesman for the
Stanford community on any is
sue (it has become a publicity
contest).
Fifth, there is no means for
various University groups to de
fend their purpose of dignity
unless they organize rallies (not
dignified) or write letters to The
Daily (subject to editorial cen
sorship). Lastly, the bureau
cracy of University organiza
tions prevents all members of
the University community from
being aware of their purposes,
plans, and functions.
What I propose is that all
forms of the present University
government and administration
be dissolved, and a number of
committees be formed of all the
members of the community to
devise a community govern
ment, a democracy, which would
be suited to Mr. Stanford's will.
I do not know what kind of
government that this would be,
but that is for the community
to decide. I would hope that
this group would have a great
deal of responsibility and a sys
tem of checks and balances, so
that all plans in physical plant
and policy would be representa
tive of community desires and
that the community would be
influential in their implementa
tion. I would also hope that
there would be a decent news
media to relate pertinent com
munity actions and activities to
the community. Responsibility
would also eliminate much of
the clowning and buffoonery
which has been associated with
this community recently. Per
haps the apathy circulating
could be changed to construc
tive action. The community
could give its own opinions,
rather than having a bunch of
factionalized University spokes
men expressing their own opin
ions as University opinion.
Perhaps the community does
not want responsibility and a
chance to become equitable and
democratic, but if the commu
nity were to back such action I
am sure that it could be done.
After all, it is our University.

Perhaps the community does
not want responsibility and a
chance to become equitable and
democratic, but if the commu
nity were to back such action I
am sure that it could be done.
After all, it is our University.

Editor, The Daily:
As one who has a high regard
for The Daily, I am deeply dis
appointed that your report and
headline on my recent article

about student revolt should have
been so misleading. My article,
appearingly current in a num
ber of religious journals, was an
attempt to explain and defend
the current undergraduate con
cern with rebellion. In a 14 page
manuscript, at least a dozen
pages were almost lavishly sup
portive of current student con
cern to bring about change in
our educational procedures.
Only at the very end did I cite
some problems that I felt were
being overlooked. By drawing
almost exclusively from that
small portion of the essay, and
taking it completely out of con
text, your report conveys an im
pression that is precisely the op
posite of what the article as a
whole is saying.
ROBERT McAFEE BROWN
(Editor's Note: The following
quotation from Dr. Brown's arti
cle clarifies his position: "There
is an uncomfortably large dose
of truth behind each item on the
complaint list. The revolting
student feels tliat as a part of
the university, he should have
some share in the decisions the
university makes, particularly
since the decisions are bound to
affect him."
"Part, indeed, of the adult
restiveness in the face of stu
dent revolt is surely based on
the disturbing accuracy with
which the younger generation
has unmasked the pretentious
ness and insecurity of the old
er.")
• Turned-Off
Editor, The Daily:
If Dean Wert and CUE want
ed to cover the University's fi
nancial loss in the Phi Delt ex
pulsion, for God's sake, why
didn't they simply suggest that
the house be used as a men's
dormitory for the rest of the
year?
In my mind, the present "ex
periment" takes us students for
fools. Are we supposed to jump
at the chance to study for six
months anything that the Ad
ministration can get five or six
professors to teach? We really
need not go to such lengths in
order for Dean Wert to see how
such an "interdisciplinary"
scheme will work. I think even
I can tell him—it will fail. And
it will fail because students are
not mental-electrical appliances
that can be plugged-in for what
ever "experiment" you please.
If the Administration is ap
palled at the thought of losing
$18,000, just think how sickened
they will be if no one signs on
for the "House"—all those dor
mitory fees lost. I favor a cam
paign of "organized indiffer
ence" against this latest plan (I
think, at last, a form of protest
suited to the Stanford temper
ment). We might even get Mr.
David Harris, who seems to be
waiting this year for the peo
ple's revolution, to lead us in
our reverse boycott. And our
slogan might be something like:
"Jus' keep buying what you've
always been buying."

• Big Deal
Editor, The Daily:
I watched the performance of
your student body president,
Dave Harris, on KQED last
night. In comparison with the
student body president of UC,
and with representatives from

Hunter's Point and other ghet
tos, Harris appeared dull, unin
spired, ignorant, and, of course,
physically revolting. His main
comments: "I've been to Missis
sippi." Big Deal. And"I live in
a ghetto, East Palo Alto." Again,
Big Deal.
The interests of Stanford
University would be better
served if this arrogant and im
mature young man would be
sent home to his parents, with
the suggestion that they admin
ister a good spanking, but only
after his diapers are removed.
