## IJB Hearing Points Up Flaws In Admin. Open House Policy 
### James Briscoe 
Wednesday night's Interim
Judicial Body hearing on the
Couzens-Ackerley open house
caper brought up several very
interesting questions about the
present university open-house
regulations.
The basic issue in the hearing
was the student Judicial Coun
cil's decision that there was no
conflict between ASSU and uni
versity open house policy. The
Council ruled that "the failure
of the administration to actively
support or enforce a policy dif
ferent from ASSU policy . . .
| indicates] the intention of the
framers of the University regu
lation as that of creating a pol
icy identical to the one adopted
by the ASSU."
From a legal and procedural
standpoint, the evidence that the
Judicial Council's ruling was in
correct seems overwhelming.
The Legislature expressly stated
last spring when it enacted the
new open house hours that a
conflict in law had been created,
and that in fact, the new regu
lations were adopted for the
avowed purpose of creating such
a conflict. With all the empha
sis placed on the intent of the
administration, it seems impos
sible to neglect the intent of
the Legislature.
Non-Enforcement
However, the notion that the
University's non-enforcement of
its regulation implies it may not
intend the regulation to be en
forced seems well taken.
Dean Winbigler acknowledged
that when the LASSU resolution
went into effect, the Dean's Of
fice assumed student coopera
tion in enforcing the rules could
no longer be expected. A mem
orandum was mailed to the var
ious residence directors and as
sistants informing them that re
sponsibility for upholding uni
versity law now rested with
them. But no systematic effort
toward enforcement has been
made or even encouraged, de
spite Dean Winbigler's state
ment that he "has the impres
sion" that violations are quite
common in men's dormitories.
Not Harmful
It seems clear, then, that the
university does not view the
wide-spread disobedience of the
open house regulations as dan
gerous or especially harmful.
The question then arises, just
what are the reasons for open
house hours? This question
seems particularly appropriate
since open house hours are a
restriction of an individual's
freedom to determine his or her
own courses of action, and in
a university community, or for
that matter, in any community,
such restrictions should not be
imposed without good reason.
The most serious reason
seems to concern morality. The
feeling is certainly widespread
that one of the chief uses of
open houses is "discourse and
intercourse." Whether or not
this is true, the university's
proper role in controlling the

morality of its students is de
batable. But even if the univers
ity has an obligation, either act
ing in loco parentis, or simply
as a landlord to prevent immoral
acts from occuring in the stu
dent residences, it is difficult to
see how the present open house
regulations work toward this
end.
Were the university to ban all
male-female contact outside of
Inner Quad, or enact a doors
open, hands above the table open
house policy, then it might legiti
mately claim to be upholding the
morals of students. But the pres
ent policy seems only to say,
twice a week is fine, but thrice
is a carnal sin.
A second, perhaps less com
pelling, but often advanced ar
gument concerns what I shall
call security of the halls. It is
that the right of the residents
of a dormitory to venture out
of their room in various states
of undress is infringed upon by
the presence of the opposite sex
in the dorm. To this I can only
say that a certain ordering of
rights seems appropriate and
the right of a person to stroll
to the drinking fountain un
clothed seems strikingly incom
mensurate with the right of a
student to entertain guests in
his/her room at his/her con
venience.
The above reasons don't seem
very convincing to me. It is my
strong conviction that many ad
ministrators as well are far
from convinced of the value of
the present open house hours,
and that this attitude, in fact,
accounts for the present non-en
forcement of the policy.
The policy, to be sure, will
soon be altered, more liberal
open house hours will soon be
forthcoming, barring an unex

pectedly strong reaction to the
student challenge presented
Wednesday night.
But there is little chance that
the regulations will vanish, little
chance even that they will be
come as liberal as the ASSU
would have them.
Given then that regulations
will continue to exist without
sufficient reason, as facade
rather than foundation, it seems
likely that those regulations will
continue to be unenforced.
And so long as the university
promulgates decrees it does not
intend to enforce, so long will
students find it difficult to re
spect the goals the university
sets for itself.

house hours? This question
seems particularly appropriate
since open house hours are a
restriction of an individual's
freedom to determine his or her
own courses of action, and in
a university community, or for
that matter, in any community,
such restrictions should not be
imposed without good reason.
The most serious reason
seems to concern morality. The
feeling is certainly widespread
that one of the chief uses of
open houses is "discourse and
intercourse." Whether or not
this is true, the university's
proper role in controlling the

morality of its students is de
batable. But even if the univers
ity has an obligation, either act
ing in loco parentis, or simply
as a landlord to prevent immoral
acts from occuring in the stu
dent residences, it is difficult to
see how the present open house
regulations work toward this
end.
Were the university to ban all
male-female contact outside of
Inner Quad, or enact a doors
open, hands above the table open
house policy, then it might legiti
mately claim to be upholding the
morals of students. But the pres
ent policy seems only to say,
twice a week is fine, but thrice
is a carnal sin.
A second, perhaps less com
pelling, but often advanced ar
gument concerns what I shall
call security of the halls. It is
that the right of the residents
of a dormitory to venture out
of their room in various states
of undress is infringed upon by
the presence of the opposite sex
in the dorm. To this I can only
say that a certain ordering of
rights seems appropriate and
the right of a person to stroll
to the drinking fountain un
clothed seems strikingly incom
mensurate with the right of a
student to entertain guests in
his/her room at his/her con
venience.
The above reasons don't seem
very convincing to me. It is my
strong conviction that many ad
ministrators as well are far
from convinced of the value of
the present open house hours,
and that this attitude, in fact,
accounts for the present non-en
forcement of the policy.
The policy, to be sure, will
soon be altered, more liberal
open house hours will soon be
forthcoming, barring an unex

pectedly strong reaction to the
student challenge presented
Wednesday night.
But there is little chance that
the regulations will vanish, little
chance even that they will be
come as liberal as the ASSU
would have them.
Given then that regulations
will continue to exist without
sufficient reason, as facade
rather than foundation, it seems
likely that those regulations will
continue to be unenforced.
And so long as the university
promulgates decrees it does not
intend to enforce, so long will
students find it difficult to re
spect the goals the university
sets for itself.
Wednesday night's Interim
Judicial Body hearing on the
Couzens-Ackerley open house
caper brought up several very
interesting questions about the
present university open-house
regulations.
The basic issue in the hearing
was the student Judicial Coun
cil's decision that there was no
conflict between ASSU and uni
versity open house policy. The
Council ruled that "the failure
of the administration to actively
support or enforce a policy dif
ferent from ASSU policy . . .
| indicates] the intention of the
framers of the University regu
lation as that of creating a pol
icy identical to the one adopted
by the ASSU."
From a legal and procedural
standpoint, the evidence that the
Judicial Council's ruling was in
correct seems overwhelming.
The Legislature expressly stated
last spring when it enacted the
new open house hours that a
conflict in law had been created,
and that in fact, the new regu
lations were adopted for the
avowed purpose of creating such
a conflict. With all the empha
sis placed on the intent of the
administration, it seems impos
sible to neglect the intent of
the Legislature.
Non-Enforcement
However, the notion that the
University's non-enforcement of
its regulation implies it may not
intend the regulation to be en
forced seems well taken.
Dean Winbigler acknowledged
that when the LASSU resolution
went into effect, the Dean's Of
fice assumed student coopera
tion in enforcing the rules could
no longer be expected. A mem
orandum was mailed to the var
ious residence directors and as
sistants informing them that re
sponsibility for upholding uni
versity law now rested with
them. But no systematic effort
toward enforcement has been
made or even encouraged, de
spite Dean Winbigler's state
ment that he "has the impres
sion" that violations are quite
common in men's dormitories.
Not Harmful
It seems clear, then, that the
university does not view the
wide-spread disobedience of the
open house regulations as dan
gerous or especially harmful.
The question then arises, just
what are the reasons for open
house hours? This question
seems particularly appropriate

forthcoming, barring an unex

pectedly strong reaction to the
student challenge presented
Wednesday night.
But there is little chance that
the regulations will vanish, little
chance even that they will be
come as liberal as the ASSU
would have them.
Given then that regulations
will continue to exist without
sufficient reason, as facade
rather than foundation, it seems
likely that those regulations will
continue to be unenforced.
And so long as the university
promulgates decrees it does not
intend to enforce, so long will
students find it difficult to re
spect the goals the university
sets for itself.
Wednesday night's Interim
Judicial Body hearing on the
Couzens-Ackerley open house
caper brought up several very
interesting questions about the
present university open-house
regulations.
The basic issue in the hearing
was the student Judicial Coun
cil's decision that there was no
conflict between ASSU and uni
versity open house policy. The
Council ruled that "the failure
of the administration to actively
support or enforce a policy dif
ferent from ASSU policy . . .
| indicates] the intention of the
framers of the University regu
lation as that of creating a pol
icy identical to the one adopted
by the ASSU."
From a legal and procedural
standpoint, the evidence that the
Judicial Council's ruling was in
correct seems overwhelming.
The Legislature expressly stated
last spring when it enacted the
new open house hours that a
conflict in law had been created,
and that in fact, the new regu
lations were adopted for the
avowed purpose of creating such
a conflict. With all the empha
sis placed on the intent of the
administration, it seems impos
sible to neglect the intent of
the Legislature.
Non-Enforcement
However, the notion that the
University's non-enforcement of
its regulation implies it may not
intend the regulation to be en
forced seems well taken.
Dean Winbigler acknowledged
that when the LASSU resolution
went into effect, the Dean's Of
fice assumed student coopera
tion in enforcing the rules could
no longer be expected. A mem
orandum was mailed to the var
ious residence directors and as
sistants informing them that re
sponsibility for upholding uni
versity law now rested with
them. But no systematic effort
toward enforcement has been
made or even encouraged, de
spite Dean Winbigler's state
ment that he "has the impres
sion" that violations are quite
common in men's dormitories.
Not Harmful
It seems clear, then, that the
university does not view the
wide-spread disobedience of the
open house regulations as dan
gerous or especially harmful.
The question then arises, just
what are the reasons for open
house hours? This question
seems particularly appropriate
since open house hours are a
restriction of an individual's
freedom to determine his or her
own courses of action, and in
a university community, or for
that matter, in any community,
such restrictions should not be
imposed without good reason.
The most serious reason
seems to concern morality. The
feeling is certainly widespread
that one of the chief uses of
open houses is "discourse and
intercourse." Whether or not
this is true, the university's
proper role in controlling the

morality of its students is de
batable. But even if the univers
ity has an obligation, either act
ing in loco parentis, or simply
as a landlord to prevent immoral
acts from occuring in the stu
dent residences, it is difficult to
see how the present open house
regulations work toward this
end.
Were the university to ban all
male-female contact outside of
Inner Quad, or enact a doors
open, hands above the table open
house policy, then it might legiti
mately claim to be upholding the
morals of students. But the pres
ent policy seems only to say,
twice a week is fine, but thrice
is a carnal sin.
A second, perhaps less com
pelling, but often advanced ar
gument concerns what I shall
call security of the halls. It is
that the right of the residents
of a dormitory to venture out
of their room in various states
of undress is infringed upon by
the presence of the opposite sex
in the dorm. To this I can only
say that a certain ordering of
rights seems appropriate and
the right of a person to stroll
to the drinking fountain un
clothed seems strikingly incom
mensurate with the right of a
student to entertain guests in
his/her room at his/her con
venience.
The above reasons don't seem
very convincing to me. It is my
strong conviction that many ad
ministrators as well are far
from convinced of the value of
the present open house hours,
and that this attitude, in fact,
accounts for the present non-en
forcement of the policy.
The policy, to be sure, will
soon be altered, more liberal
open house hours will soon be
forthcoming, barring an unex

pectedly strong reaction to the
student challenge presented
Wednesday night.

the regulations will vanish, little
