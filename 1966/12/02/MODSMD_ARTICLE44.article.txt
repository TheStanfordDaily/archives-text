Teacher Smeecher
Once upon a time there were twin brothers named Damon and
Pythias Smeecher, who shared a deep love of learning. The only
difference between them was that Damon loved to acquire learn
ing and Pythias loved to give it away.
Loving learning as they did, they naturally joined the faculty of
the University of Megapolis, which was the greatest treasure trove
of learning in the whole wide world.
Damon decided to become a scholar of ancient Etruscan funeral
orations because he loved dead languages and things like that
Pythias decided to become a teacher of Life, because he loved
life and things like that.
"A Jewel In The Diadem"
In hardly any time at all, Damon became the greatest scholar
of ancient Etruscan funeral orations in th whole wide world. He
wrote papers and books and was universally recognized as a leading
authority in his field by both other authorities in his field.
The only cross he had to bear was the university regulation re
quiring him to lecture to students from 1 p.m. to 1:40 p.m. on
alternate Wednesdays.
With a great effort, he would tear himself away from his be
loved Etruscan funeral orations, scurry to the lecture hall and
rattle off his lecture without once looking up from his notes.
Actually, he delivered the exact same lecture every alternate
Wednesday for 32 years. But as he delivered it entirely in ancient
Etruscan, which nobody understood, there were few complaints.
So grants poured in to Damon from the Ford, Rockefeller and
Maidenform Foundations. He was made a full professor at 27,
head of his department at 31 and was always described at faculty
teas as "a jewel in the diadem of this great university.'
"I Guess I Just Teach"
Meanwhile, his brother Pythias became the greatest teacher of
Life in the whole wide world.
His students loved him. They would flock to sit at his feet as
he taught them how the stars wheel in their courses, why a
cowslip blooms and what goodness was. He poured out everything
he knew about everything and a generation of students grew up
wiser and kinder, instilled with a love of learning and a love of life.
Of course, this kind of teaching took a lot of time and Pythias
never did finish his paper entitled "What Life Is All About." But,
as he said to himself, "No scholarly journal would publish a paper
like that anyway."
At the age of 62, Pythias was called into the Dean's office. "Look
here, Smeecher," said the Dean, "I noticed your name on the fac
ulty roster. What do you do around here anyway?"
"I guess I just teach, sir," said Pythias apologetically.
"Good heavens, Smeecher," cried the Dean, canceling his con
tract on the spot, "how can we go on being the greatest treasure
trove of learning in he world, if you keep giving the stuff away?"
Moral: The modern university is a perfect place to get an educa
tion. If you're a member of the faculty.

Teacher Smeecher
Once upon a time there were twin brothers named Damon and
Pythias Smeecher, who shared a deep love of learning. The only
difference between them was that Damon loved to acquire learn
ing and Pythias loved to give it away.
Loving learning as they did, they naturally joined the faculty of
the University of Megapolis, which was the greatest treasure trove
of learning in the whole wide world.
Damon decided to become a scholar of ancient Etruscan funeral
orations because he loved dead languages and things like that
Pythias decided to become a teacher of Life, because he loved
life and things like that.
"A Jewel In The Diadem"
In hardly any time at all, Damon became the greatest scholar
of ancient Etruscan funeral orations in th whole wide world. He
wrote papers and books and was universally recognized as a leading
authority in his field by both other authorities in his field.
The only cross he had to bear was the university regulation re
quiring him to lecture to students from 1 p.m. to 1:40 p.m. on
alternate Wednesdays.
With a great effort, he would tear himself away from his be
loved Etruscan funeral orations, scurry to the lecture hall and
rattle off his lecture without once looking up from his notes.
Actually, he delivered the exact same lecture every alternate
Wednesday for 32 years. But as he delivered it entirely in ancient
Etruscan, which nobody understood, there were few complaints.
So grants poured in to Damon from the Ford, Rockefeller and
Maidenform Foundations. He was made a full professor at 27,
head of his department at 31 and was always described at faculty
teas as "a jewel in the diadem of this great university.'
"I Guess I Just Teach"
Meanwhile, his brother Pythias became the greatest teacher of
Life in the whole wide world.
His students loved him. They would flock to sit at his feet as
he taught them how the stars wheel in their courses, why a
cowslip blooms and what goodness was. He poured out everything
he knew about everything and a generation of students grew up
wiser and kinder, instilled with a love of learning and a love of life.
Of course, this kind of teaching took a lot of time and Pythias
never did finish his paper entitled "What Life Is All About." But,
as he said to himself, "No scholarly journal would publish a paper
like that anyway."
At the age of 62, Pythias was called into the Dean's office. "Look
here, Smeecher," said the Dean, "I noticed your name on the fac
ulty roster. What do you do around here anyway?"
"I guess I just teach, sir," said Pythias apologetically.
"Good heavens, Smeecher," cried the Dean, canceling his con
tract on the spot, "how can we go on being the greatest treasure
trove of learning in he world, if you keep giving the stuff away?"
Moral: The modern university is a perfect place to get an educa
tion. If you're a member of the faculty.
