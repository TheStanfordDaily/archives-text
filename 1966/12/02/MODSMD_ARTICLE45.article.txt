## David Harris: A Tragicomedy

David Harris
President Johnson is criticized
for being the best of his profes
sion. Let no one criticize David
Harris for just about being the
worst.
Politics — according to the
cliche — means compromise. In
rhetorical compromise, a politi
cian gives his opponent a few
garlands, trying to catch a few
in return. That politician is a
debater.
In practical compromise, a poli
tician changes his goals so that
they conform with what he can
achieve. That politician is a
doer.
Finally, personal compromise

means a politician defining him
self in terms of the situation.
He bends with the wind and
changes any principle except the
principle of his own survival.
That politician is a charlatan.
Few Loyalties
The good politician will play
all three roles, in a blend which
cannot be sorted out by the on
looker. He makes them all seem
like personal commitment, while
his heart knows few loyalties.
To do this, the politician must
sustain a breach between ap
pearance and his real senti
ments. And this David Harris
is incapable of doing.
A thoroughgoing sincerity —
in language and ideas (and, need
we say, dress?) — leaves him
no room to hide the scope of his
personal vision of the univer
sity.
Aggregate of Ideas
A passionate commitment in
volves him in every statement.
A compromise in his argument
is thus a compromise of David
Harris, an aggregate of ideas,
but above all a person.
This cannot be effective in
any institutional context. Paper
work, negotiation and being har
rassed (and, need we say, com
mittees?) are not his areas of
strength.
What must be stressed is that
they shouldn't be. One must be
allowed the suspicion, from time
to time, that David Harris is not
guilty of failing to adapt. The
community is guilty of failing
to understand. Often it fails
even to listen.
Kung's Resume
Hans Kung's first West Lec
ture began with a resume of sin
cerity as what is excellent and
characteristic of contemporary
man.
Because it is passionate, and

personal at its very roots, it
means much more than the
good intentions which pave the
road to a diabolical firmament
David Harris, and those of the
same mind, like B. Davie Na
pier, express at its finest a goal
for all of us.
If Harris is a failure, it is not
for lack of vision, but perhaps
because he sees too clearly.
His Own Idiom
An ultimate success can only
come in personal contact, which
in his own idom is central to
education.
Richard Lichtman of the Cent
er for the Study of Democratic
Institutions, writing on civil dis
obedience, has expressed the
substance of the conflict:
"The individual who acts in
revolution, though he may de
spair of the means forced upon
him, may nonetheless derive
the consolation that comes to
one who believes he will be ex
onerated by future generations
of men.
Anguished heroism
"But for the man who opposes
his will to the system without
expectation of contemporary or
future vindication, the condition
is one of total self-reliance, and
the state of the dissenter that
of anguished heroism.
"Whether that anguish is fun
damentally tragic or comic will
depend upon one's vision; tragic,
if one suffers concretely the
tormented choice and conse
quent immolation that re-affirms
the world's old order, but finally
comic, perhaps, if what one ul
timately grasps is that abstract
principle of absurdity which de
crees that the best of men will,
through their own nobility, be
the agents of their own destruc
tion."

his heart knows few loyalties.
To do this, the politician must
sustain a breach between ap
pearance and his real senti
ments. And this David Harris
is incapable of doing.
A thoroughgoing sincerity —
in language and ideas (and, need
we say, dress?) — leaves him
no room to hide the scope of his
personal vision of the univer
sity.
Aggregate of Ideas
A passionate commitment in
volves him in every statement.
A compromise in his argument
is thus a compromise of David
Harris, an aggregate of ideas,
but above all a person.
This cannot be effective in
any institutional context. Paper
work, negotiation and being har
rassed (and, need we say, com
mittees?) are not his areas of
strength.
What must be stressed is that
they shouldn't be. One must be
allowed the suspicion, from time
to time, that David Harris is not
guilty of failing to adapt. The
community is guilty of failing
to understand. Often it fails
even to listen.
Kung's Resume
Hans Kung's first West Lec
ture began with a resume of sin
cerity as what is excellent and
characteristic of contemporary
man.
Because it is passionate, and

personal at its very roots, it
means much more than the
good intentions which pave the
road to a diabolical firmament
David Harris, and those of the
same mind, like B. Davie Na
pier, express at its finest a goal
for all of us.
If Harris is a failure, it is not
for lack of vision, but perhaps
because he sees too clearly.
His Own Idiom
An ultimate success can only
come in personal contact, which
in his own idom is central to
education.
Richard Lichtman of the Cent
er for the Study of Democratic
Institutions, writing on civil dis
obedience, has expressed the
substance of the conflict:
"The individual who acts in
revolution, though he may de
spair of the means forced upon
him, may nonetheless derive
the consolation that comes to
one who believes he will be ex
onerated by future generations
of men.
Anguished heroism
"But for the man who opposes
his will to the system without
expectation of contemporary or
future vindication, the condition
is one of total self-reliance, and
the state of the dissenter that
of anguished heroism.
"Whether that anguish is fun
damentally tragic or comic will
depend upon one's vision; tragic,
if one suffers concretely the
tormented choice and conse
quent immolation that re-affirms
the world's old order, but finally
comic, perhaps, if what one ul
timately grasps is that abstract
principle of absurdity which de
crees that the best of men will,
through their own nobility, be
the agents of their own destruc
tion."
"When it gets piled this high
. . . that's when I'll leave." —
David Harris
President Johnson is criticized
for being the best of his profes
sion. Let no one criticize David
Harris for just about being the
worst.
Politics — according to the
cliche — means compromise. In
rhetorical compromise, a politi
cian gives his opponent a few
garlands, trying to catch a few
in return. That politician is a
debater.
In practical compromise, a poli
tician changes his goals so that
they conform with what he can
achieve. That politician is a
doer.
Finally, personal compromise

means a politician defining him
self in terms of the situation.
He bends with the wind and
changes any principle except the
principle of his own survival.
That politician is a charlatan.
Few Loyalties
The good politician will play
all three roles, in a blend which
cannot be sorted out by the on
looker. He makes them all seem
like personal commitment, while
his heart knows few loyalties.
To do this, the politician must
sustain a breach between ap
pearance and his real senti
ments. And this David Harris
