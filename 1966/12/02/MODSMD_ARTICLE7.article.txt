# Power Pie, Compleat Bestiary Highlight Chaparral Premiere
## 
### STEVE GRUBER Humor Editor 
Humor will return to the campus
next week.

The Stanford Chaparral will be on
sale at Engineering Corner a week
from today and it will be worth buy
ing.
In fact, editor Mike Rugg plans to
put out five editions this year with
his rejuvenated staff, consisting main
ly of freshmen.
The Chaparral, Stanford's student
oublished humor magazine, was
founded in 1891, the same year the
University opened its doors. It is
owned by the Hammer and Coffin
Society, which was formed April 17,
1906, the day before the 1906 earth
quake shook most of the Bay Area
to the ground. Only the most senior
members of the Chaparral staff are
invited to join the Hammer and Cof
fin Society.
Power Pie will make her second ap
pearance in this edition. The well
drawn comic strip is a subtle dig at
Stanford women.
Stanford Animals
The Compleat Bestiary is another
cartoon feature, also magnificently
drawn, picturing Stanford as a col
lection of animals. The Phi Delts, row
women, and English T.A.'s, are all
appropriately honored in the article.
The Chaparral takes a definite stand
on Branner uirls, too, describing them
as "pigs."
A Lagunita sophomore, Martha
Yunker, lends her lean configurations
to the center pages of the magazine.

Another knee-slapper is the "Pic
torial Report: The Undergrad Libe."
The Chaparral shows us exactly how
the new library was constructed in a
series of photographs.
The Stanford Quiz is a rather un
even list of false, multiple choice, and
essay questions. However, everything
the true-false questions lack in humor
is easily recovered by the multiple
choice questions, so it looks like a
draw.
"Expose: Menace of the Streets"
tells how a bike rider risks his life
daily as he makes the trip to Stan
ford from Palo Alto. Amazingly, it is
the only transgression of this edition
into the area of smut. Past Chaparral
editions have rarely ventured outside
of this area.
Practical Joke?
The traditional editorial takes the
Stand that the Harris haircut inci
dent was a practical joke. This is not
too surprising since the editor is a
Delt.
There are several references in
the Chaparral to what the staff claims
is the biassed (sic) Daily. In the Com
pleat Bestiary, a Daily reporter is
pictured as a donkey. Other refer
ences imply that the Daily is not fair,
impartial, or objective. This is prob
ably the most serious drawback of the
Chaparral, because, as we all know,
it just isn't true. Well, not all the
time.

ford from Palo Alto. Amazingly, it is
the only transgression of this edition
into the area of smut. Past Chaparral
editions have rarely ventured outside
of this area.
Practical Joke?
The traditional editorial takes the
Stand that the Harris haircut inci
dent was a practical joke. This is not
too surprising since the editor is a
Delt.
There are several references in
the Chaparral to what the staff claims
is the biassed (sic) Daily. In the Com
pleat Bestiary, a Daily reporter is
pictured as a donkey. Other refer
ences imply that the Daily is not fair,
impartial, or objective. This is prob
ably the most serious drawback of the
Chaparral, because, as we all know,
it just isn't true. Well, not all the
time.
Humor will return to the campus
next week.

The Stanford Chaparral will be on
sale at Engineering Corner a week
from today and it will be worth buy
ing.
In fact, editor Mike Rugg plans to
put out five editions this year with
his rejuvenated staff, consisting main
ly of freshmen.
The Chaparral, Stanford's student
oublished humor magazine, was
founded in 1891, the same year the
University opened its doors. It is
owned by the Hammer and Coffin
Society, which was formed April 17,
1906, the day before the 1906 earth
quake shook most of the Bay Area
to the ground. Only the most senior
members of the Chaparral staff are
invited to join the Hammer and Cof
fin Society.
Power Pie will make her second ap
pearance in this edition. The well
drawn comic strip is a subtle dig at
Stanford women.
Stanford Animals
The Compleat Bestiary is another
cartoon feature, also magnificently
drawn, picturing Stanford as a col
lection of animals. The Phi Delts, row
women, and English T.A.'s, are all
appropriately honored in the article.
The Chaparral takes a definite stand
on Branner uirls, too, describing them
as "pigs."
A Lagunita sophomore, Martha
Yunker, lends her lean configurations
to the center pages of the magazine.

Another knee-slapper is the "Pic
torial Report: The Undergrad Libe."
The Chaparral shows us exactly how
the new library was constructed in a
series of photographs.
The Stanford Quiz is a rather un
even list of false, multiple choice, and
essay questions. However, everything
the true-false questions lack in humor
is easily recovered by the multiple
choice questions, so it looks like a
draw.
"Expose: Menace of the Streets"
tells how a bike rider risks his life
daily as he makes the trip to Stan
ford from Palo Alto. Amazingly, it is
the only transgression of this edition
into the area of smut. Past Chaparral
editions have rarely ventured outside
of this area.
