# Berkeley Boycott Draws Six Thousand From Class
## 
### WALLY MILLAR 
STRIKE! The word was out at Ber
keley yesterday as an estimated 6000
students, teaching assistants, and fa
culty stayed away from classes. The
strike was called Wednesday night by
the Student Senate in a close 9-to-8
vote, to support a protest of Univer
sity policy.
The dispute started when the Ber
keley Draft Information Committee
(BDIC), a student group with close
ties to the SDS, set up an anti-recruit
ing table next to the Navy aviation
recruiting table in the Berkeley Stu
dent Union. A campus policeman
ordered the BDIC table removed, since
University policy does not permit stu
dent group political tables inside the
Student Union. The BDIC members
present, some of them non-students,
refused to leave and began a short
but eventful sit-in.
The Berkeley police officer was
backed up by more UC police, and
two busloads of Alameda County
Sheriff's officers, who arrested stu
dents and non-students on charges
ranging from interfering with police
to violating California's Mulford Act,
which prohibits non-students from
taking part in University demonstra

tions. The situation moved from sit-in
to riot conditions.
The growing crowd chanted "Navy
must go! Navy must go!". Student
leaders, addressing them by means
of bullhorns, decided to protest the
police action by means of a sit-in at
the Student Union. However, Univer
sity officials announced that the
Union would stay open beyond its
midnight closing hour, rendering the
sit-in meaningless.
Earl F. Chiet, Executive Vice-Chan
cellor and acting executive head of
the University, signed warrants
against eight non-students arrested,
among them Mario Savio, leader of
the 1964 Free Speech Movement.
Meanwhile, student leaders, joined by
teaching assistants, professors, and
3500 other students â€” decided to
strike the University until noon yes
terday, when a rally was held in front
of Sproul Hall. Mario Savio, freed on
$440 bail, addressed the 10,000 stu
dents gathered in the rain, calling for
a hand vote on whether to continue
the strike; the response was almost
unanimous.
He then read the five demands
which were to be presented to the
administration:
1) That police not be used to settle
disputes within the university,
2) That no disciplinary action be
taken against the students involved
in the demonstration, and that charges
be dropped against the non-students,
3 That all off-campus individuals
and groups be granted the same privi
leges as government agencies,
4) That any University hearings on
the matter be open,
5) That negotiations begin to estab
lish a system of student representa
tion in formulation of a new policy

regulating student activities; the
strike committee must name a ma
jority of the student representatives,
Harris Takes A Stand
Officials in various positions re
acted to the strike. ASSU President
Dave Harris issued a statement yes
terday morning: "I consider the ac
tion by the students at the University
of California at Berkeley yesterday
to be a courageous defence of the
rights of free speech and equality

under the law. I support them as
wholeheartedly as an individual 50
miles away can. If the officers of the
University of California and the state
cared as much for freedom and edu
cation as these students sitting in,
none of this would have happened."
Governor Brown said that he would
leave the matter in the hands of
University officials, while governor
elect Reagan blamed the trouble on
"middle-aged delinquents" who live
near the campus, and said he would
continue to press for an investigation
of university affairs.
As night fell, the all-day rain con
tinued, and the campus was quiet.
The only evidence of the day's activi
ties were the STRIKE! stickers on
doors and walls.
