# Edwin J. Doyle Dies Overseas
## 
### 
Edwin J. "Ted" Doyle, 44, as
sociate professor of Classics,
died of a heart attack December
15, while waiting for a flight to
the United States in Amsterdam,
Netherlands.
He was completing a quarter
long archeological sabbatical in
Greece.
A red-faced, heavy-set Irish
man, who, as a student once
noted, looked "more like a re
tired patrolman than a scholar,"
Doyle was known around cam
pus as "The Irrestible Ted." The
nickname came from a sign
which, according to Doyle, his
secretary had hung on his office
door.
A specialist in Greek history,
Doyle came to Stanford in 1959.
His colleagues credited him with
a rare ability to communicate
his knowledge of classical an
tiquity.
His students knew him as wit
ty and easy going—a man who
seldom passed an opportunity

for friendly conversation.
A native of Lynn, Mass., Prof.
Doyle studied intermittently at
Boston University where he re
ceived his A.B. in 1946. In 1942,
the Army selected him to study
Swedish and be trained as a spy.
As he later recounted it, he
soon mastered Swedish, but was
not quite the spy type. He trans
ferred to the infantry nine
months later.
He received his Ph.D. in clas
sics from Harvard in 1959. Be
fore coming to Stanford, Doyle
studied at the American School
of Classical Studies and had
taught at Wheaton, College.
He had served as regional sec
retary for the American Asso
ciation of University Profesors
and was president of the Bay
Area chapter of the American
Archeological Association.
Doyle is survived by his moth
er, Mrs. Mary J. Doyle, and a
brother Frederick, both of Lynn,
Mass.
