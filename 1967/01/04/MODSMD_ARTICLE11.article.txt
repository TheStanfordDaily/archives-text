# Italy Thanks
## 
### 
The following greetings for
the holiday season were sent by
Dr. Mammarella, on behalf of
Stanford in Italy, but were re
ceived after the final edition of
The Daily had been published
for Autumn Quarter.
"The Administration and the
Staff of Stanford in Italy thank
all the students and friends who
have been writing to express
their solidarity and moral sup
port for the damages caused to
Florence by the flood and send
best wishes for the Holiday Sea
son."
