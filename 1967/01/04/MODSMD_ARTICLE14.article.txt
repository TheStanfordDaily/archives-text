# Construction Set For Space Building
## 
### 
With final approval of a $992,-
000 grant from the Air Force
last month, University officials
announced that construction of
a $4,460,000 Space Engineering
and Science Building and related
facilities will begin early this
year.
A previous grant of $2,080,000
from the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration (NA
SA), plus $1,380,000 to be raised
by the University from indus
trial and private sources, will
complete the four-floor, 116,000-
square-foot structure for space
oriented research and training.
The University's share of the
building's cost will pay for class
rooms, instruction laboratories,
seminar and conference rooms,
library and information storage
areas.

There also will be numerous
offices, research laboratories,
shops, and a large computer fa
cility—enough to serve approx
imately 50 faculty members, 40
research associates, and 180
graduate students from a dozen
or more departments. The De
partment of Aeronautics and
Astronautics will be located
there as well.
The new facility will take
about two years to complete.
Roger Lewis, Stanford trustee
and president of General Dy
namics who heads the Univer
sity's Corporate Gifts Program,
said "a new building to house
interdisciplinary research and
training in space engineering
and science at Stanford will be
of great practical value to the
entire aerospace program.
"The private funding, mainly
from corporations, along with
the excellent grants from NASA
and the Air Force, will assure a
well-rounded, integrated facility
serving the needs of higher edu
cation, industry and the gov
ernment."
The building will be located
in the Science Quad adjacent to
the McCullough Building. It will
face Lomita Mall, the landscaped
plaza which will replace Lomita
Drive along the west side of
Stanford's Main Quad.
