### HENRY MULLER News Editor 
A British teacher who has
spent 21 years in China will de
liver a speech on contemporary
conditions in China at 4:30 p.m.
in room 271 of Tresidder Union.
David Crook, of the Foreign
Language Institute in Peking, in
tends to emphasize the present
Cultural Revolution and the Red
Guard in his talk.
Crook resides in Peking and
is here as part of a speaking
tour of Great Britain, Canada,
and the United States. He and
his wife have written several
books on China, including the
recently published The First
Years of the Yangyi Commune.
Crook made his first trip to
China in 1938 as a missionary
to teach English. His experiences
at that time qualify him as one

of the few Westerners who has
seen both the old and the new
China.
In 1947, after serving in South
East Asia with the Royal Air
Force during World War 11, he
and his family decided to return
to China. They moved to a rural
area in Communist-held portions
of northern China and it was
there that he and his wife wrote
their first book about that coun
try. In 1949, the Crook family
moved to Peking, where he as
sumed his present position at the
Foreign Languages Institute.
The impetus for Crook's trip
to North America came when
he was invited to participate in
a teach-in at the University of
Toronto. After speaking
throughout Canada, he was
asked by the National Academy
of Sciences to apply for a visa

to come to the United States in
order to speak at various uni
versities which had invited him.
Crook experienced consider
able difficulty in obtaining the
visa, but was finally granted one
after the third attempt. He was
turned down the first time on
the grounds that he refused to
answer a question asking him
whether he had ever been a
member of the Communist
Party.
Crook, who was educated in
Britain and the United States,
intends to join his wife and
children at their home in Peking
within about a month.
