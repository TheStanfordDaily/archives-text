# C15 Unanimously Recommends Liberalized Open House Hours
## 
### CHRIS HARTE Associate Editor 
The Committee of Fifteen (Cl 5)
has unanimously recommended an
open house policy substantially more
liberal than the present administra
tion rules and comparable to the
ASSU regulations in effect since last
spring.
If Legislature and the Trustees
approve the recommendations, they
will signal the end of the conflict of

law begun when LASSU implemented
its new regulations on May 20, 1966.
The Executive Committee of the
Academic Council approved the Cl 5
report in mid-December and has noti
fied President Sterling of its action.
Executive Committee approval is
equivalent to faculty support.
The regulations would allow open
house four days a week from noon
to midnight, which the individual liv
ing group could restrict further by
majority vote or could expand, to a
limit of seven days a week from 10

a.m. to 2:30 a.m., by a three-quarters
vote.
All votes would have to be on a
secret ballot.
The Cl 5 proposal was prefaced by a
seven-page statement giving reasons
for the changes.
"The basic premise," it stated, "is
that a residence University such as
Stanford should try to provide opti
mum living conditions for those of its
students who choose or are required
to live on campus.
"To us, this premise means, among
other things, that those who reside
in them should have as much freedom
as is practicable to choose, individually
and collectively, how these facilities
will be used."
The covering statement touched on
two arguments it anticipated would
be made against the changes.
To the argument that more liberal
hours would inconvenience other stu
dents the committee contends that
"the most practical and educationally
desirable way to strike the necessary
accommodation is for the students in
each residence to balance the various
competing interests themselves, pro

vided only that minority interests are
adequately considered and protected."
The other argument, that "more
liberal open house will encourage
sexual relationships among students,"
Cl 5 discounted as "false." Students,
the report says, "deny that a Univer
sity residence is an ideal, or even a
likely, place for sexual relationships."
President Sterling received the re
port in November but has not yet
acted upon it. Administrative Assis
tant Frederick O. Glover said yester
day that Sterling had just returned
from two weeks in Hong Kong, where
he was attending an international
education conference, and had not
made any decisions on the report.

"I presume that he will study the
report and make a recommendation
to the Board of Trustees."
If, as infromed observers predict,
Legislature approves the proposals
when it meets January 12, only Trus
tee approval will be needed, and it
could come at the Board's San Fran
cisco meeting January 19.
The ASSU regulations presently in
effect set open house at noon to mid
night on weekdays and 10 a.m. to
2:30 a.m. on weekends.
Administration regulations allow six
hours of open house a week, on spe
cified days, and state that "Doors may
not be locked." No such provision is
made in the Cl 5 regulations.
