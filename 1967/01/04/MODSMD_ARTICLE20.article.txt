# The 						'OFF' Campaign
## 
### 
The OFF campaign for women's off-campus
living has changed markedly over the holidays.
The proponents have modified their ultimatum
tactics, asking only that sympathetic students
withhold their rent payment until January 17,
at the last day for regular payment. In doing
so the OFF proponents have wisely allowed the
issue to speak for itself. And there is indeed an
issue in the campaign which even the inept
tactics and the melodramatic cry of equal wom
en's rights were unable to obscure.
Last November more than two thousand stu
dents supported a referendum which called for
upperclass women to have the option to live off
campus. This seems to us to be a fair indication
that the OFF issue was of deep student interest.
Yet peculiarly neither student government nor
the administration had the issue on its agenda
of priority items at the beginning of the school
year, and if the issue was there at all, it was
low on the list.
The University made no direct comment upon
the referendum, and the proponents began a
series of letters to President Sterling and mem
bers of the Board of Trustees demanding that
the OFF issue be referred to the Board at once.
The reluctance of the University to make any
public response to the demands of the referen
dum led the proponents to infer that the issue
was being intentionally blocked. In fact, the
University, through the Dean's Office, was con

sidering in detail the ramifications of allowing
women to live off-campus. Many of the ruffled
feathers and much of the misunderstanding
might have been alleviated if the President had
made public the University's intention to in
vestigate and to respond to the situation as he
did in correspondence to individual students.
Board President Richard Guggenhime, in a
letter last fall, correctly noted that women are
well aware of the University's residence re
quirements before coming to Stanford, and
hence that they have no justification for de
manding immediate reversal of longstanding
policy. However, the OFF protest has sets its
target for fall 1967 — not January 4 — which
would provide the administration adequate
time to project the effects of a change of policy
in next year's budget, which is now in its final
stages of preparation. While Stanford is striving
to be, and we believe ought to be, a residential
university in the fullest sense of the word, fi
nances and personal tastes present a good case
for offering upperclass women an additional
alternative in their living choice.
In terms of power tactics, the modified cam
paign wields no more force, and perhaps less,
than a broad-based letter writing campaign.
However in asking the University to speak to
a widespread request, the campaign may serve
some good.

The reluctance of the University to make any
public response to the demands of the referen
dum led the proponents to infer that the issue
was being intentionally blocked. In fact, the
University, through the Dean's Office, was con

sidering in detail the ramifications of allowing
women to live off-campus. Many of the ruffled
feathers and much of the misunderstanding
might have been alleviated if the President had
made public the University's intention to in
vestigate and to respond to the situation as he
did in correspondence to individual students.
Board President Richard Guggenhime, in a
letter last fall, correctly noted that women are
well aware of the University's residence re
quirements before coming to Stanford, and
hence that they have no justification for de
manding immediate reversal of longstanding
policy. However, the OFF protest has sets its
target for fall 1967 — not January 4 — which
would provide the administration adequate
time to project the effects of a change of policy
in next year's budget, which is now in its final
stages of preparation. While Stanford is striving
to be, and we believe ought to be, a residential
university in the fullest sense of the word, fi
nances and personal tastes present a good case
for offering upperclass women an additional
alternative in their living choice.
In terms of power tactics, the modified cam
paign wields no more force, and perhaps less,
than a broad-based letter writing campaign.
However in asking the University to speak to
a widespread request, the campaign may serve
some good.
The OFF campaign for women's off-campus
living has changed markedly over the holidays.
The proponents have modified their ultimatum
tactics, asking only that sympathetic students
withhold their rent payment until January 17,
at the last day for regular payment. In doing
so the OFF proponents have wisely allowed the
issue to speak for itself. And there is indeed an
issue in the campaign which even the inept
tactics and the melodramatic cry of equal wom
en's rights were unable to obscure.
Last November more than two thousand stu
dents supported a referendum which called for
upperclass women to have the option to live off
campus. This seems to us to be a fair indication
that the OFF issue was of deep student interest.
Yet peculiarly neither student government nor
the administration had the issue on its agenda
of priority items at the beginning of the school
year, and if the issue was there at all, it was
low on the list.
The University made no direct comment upon
the referendum, and the proponents began a
series of letters to President Sterling and mem
bers of the Board of Trustees demanding that
the OFF issue be referred to the Board at once.
