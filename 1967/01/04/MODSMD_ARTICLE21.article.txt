# The 						Grove Project
## 
### 
The final form of the Grove Project contains
the elements of an experiment in residential ed
ucation which ought to excite students, faculty,
and administration. Once logistical details were
ironed out by the Committee on Undergrad
uate Education, nearly all the recommenda
tions of the ASSU Housing Commission were
incorporated into the program.
With forty-three undergraduates living in the
former Phi Delta Theta house and seventeen
non-resident associate members, the project
will be the campus' first co-educational living
group. All members will participate in a two
quarter academic program centered within the
house, while taking the majority of their courses
on Quad. With the presence of graduate tutors,
assisting faculty members, and frequent guests,
such as China expert David Crook who is visit

ing the house this evening, the Grove Project
will test the limits and merits of residential
education.
The results of the projects will serve as an
excellent benchmark for co-ed Moore-Jacks
Hall, which is scheduled to open under the
faculty-master system in the fall of 1969. How
ever, a successful experiment could lead to the
continuation of a similar project centered around
a particular academic topic, such as the Grove's
theme of development.
The University has shown signs of adventure
as well as innovation in according Professor
Mark Mancall, director of the project, full co
operation. If education at Stanford is to be
more than formal structures and programs, it
is precisely this sort of far-sighted cooperation
which will be required.
