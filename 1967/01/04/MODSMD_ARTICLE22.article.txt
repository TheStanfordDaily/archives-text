## Misery Is Tresidder Coffee 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
The rug on the fourth floor
of the UGLY looks fine from
a distance of 8 feet or greater,
but from the proximity afforded
sitting in a library chair, it looks
sickening.
You can float a quarter in a
cup of either Tresidder coffee or
Tresidder coke. They are both
beyond the digestive capabilities
of the normal human alimentary
tract.
Since it takes three University
gardeners to rake up each leaf
as it falls, why not save time
and effort and just pluck them
off before they drop?
Is this University so poor it
can't afford light bulbs for Cub
berley or Memorial Auditori
ums?
All Tresidder food, liquid,
solid, or somewhere in between,
tastes exactly the same.

How long will it be before
someone vaults over the fourth
floor balcony of the UGLY, caus
ing bars to be installed all
around ? T. BROM

Editor, The Dally:
Seldom, if ever, have I seen a
more inaccurate, libelous and
unfair headline in any Univer
sity or general-circulation paper
as the one in this morning's edi
tion of The Daily.
I am referring to the head,
"Police Mistreat Minorities,"
which accompanies a Page One
story written by Mr. Geoffrey
Stevens.
No unattributed accusation
type headline such as this
should appear anywhere in a
newspaper except on the edito
rial page where a reader may

easily identify the accompany
ing article as the editorial pol
icy of the newspaper or the
opinion of a signed columnist.
The most unfortunate point
in this discussion, is the fact
that no amount of attribution
could have saved this headline.
Because it simply does not rep
resent what the story said. I
have read Mr. Stevens' story
three times and nowhere could
I find Mr. Conyers making or
even connoting such a blanket
accusation as the one in the
headline.

could have saved this headline.
Because it simply does not rep
resent what the story said. I
have read Mr. Stevens' story
three times and nowhere could
I find Mr. Conyers making or
even connoting such a blanket
accusation as the one in the
headline.
