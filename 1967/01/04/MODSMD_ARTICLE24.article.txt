## Snows Bury LBJ In Credibility Gap 
### Art Buchwald 
There has been a lot of talk
about the Credibility Gap but
no one seems to know exactly
where it is. Credibility Gap is
located in The Great Society
Mountain Range somewhere be
tween Johnson City and Wash
ington, D.C. It is bordered on
one side by the snow-peaked
Mount Olive Branch and on the
other by the towering, cloud
hidden Mount Escalation.
Subject to fierce winds that
sometimes blow hot and some
times blow cold, Credibility Gap
is considered the most danger
ous pass in the entire country
and no one can stay there very
long without suffering from ex
posure.
Geologists report that in 1963
the Gap was no wider than a
footpath and anyone could get
through it without much diffi
culty. But through the years the
Gap seems to have widened be
cause of adverse weather con
ditions as well as continual
bombing. And man-made at
tempts to close the Gap, or at
least narrow it, have failed mis
erably.
Probably one of the reasons
for these failures is that no one
can agree on how to close the
Gap. Authorities will come up
with a suggestion one day which
sounds very credible on paper,
but the next day someone will
come up with an entirely differ
ent solution which cancels out
the first one. \
Could Be Bridged
Some experts feel the best
way to close the Gap is to build
a bridge across it. But the mili
tary is opposed to building any
bridges and feels that the only
way to make the Gap safe is to
knock out everything in the
area.
Other experts insist that the
danger of the Gap has been
highly exaggerated by Nervous
Nellies, and the less said about
it, the less chance the Gap will
have to widen.
One of the problems of the
Credibility Gap is that nobody
knows to whom it belongs. The
government officials feel the
Gap belongs to them and they
should have complete control
over it and decide what should
go through it and what should
n't.
The press, on the other hand,
feels the Gap belongs to the peo
ple and it should not be used as
an escape route for government
explorers.
There are even those high in
government circles who deny
there is a Credibility Gap and
say it is a figment of the imagi
nation of the fourth estate.
But thousands of newspaper

men have not only seen the
Credibility Gap and gone
throught it, but have come out
of badly battered, suffering from
frostbite and shock.
They bear witness to the fact
that the Credibility Gap exists,
ready to wreck havoc on any
one who would approach it.
Political Threat
Although it is one of natures'
wonders, the Credibility Gap has
now become a political issue.
And there are those who predict
that if it isn't closed soon, there
will be a series of avalanches in
1968.
So now the experts have two
years to figure out how to pre
vent this from happening. The
King of the Mountain, in whose
hands the decision lies, stands in
the Gap and keeps looking up
at Mount Olive Branch and then
at Mount Escalation, trying to
decide which one to climb.
And when people ask him how
he got into the Credibility Gap
in the first place, he can only re
ply, "Because it was there."
