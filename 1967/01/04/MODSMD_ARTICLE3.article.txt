# Harris Protests War In Vietnam: Signs Open Letter To President
## 
### STEVE GRUBER Draft Editor 
Student Body President David Har
ris joined the Vietnam War protest
on two more issues last week, co
signing an open letter to President
Johnson and appealing a recent 1-A
classification by his draft board.
The letter was signed by student
body presidents and college editors
of 99 other campuses across the coun
try. The purpose of the letter is to
"encourage a frank discussion" of
U.S. involvement in Vietnam.
Harris indicated that he is not in
total agreement with the letter. "I
don't disagree with the letter," he
said, "I just don't think it says
enough."
One part that Harris thinks could
have been left out states that the

signers of the letter are "as devoted
to the Constitution, to the democratic
process, and to law and order as were
their fathers and brothers who served
willingly in two World Wars and in
Korea."
Harris's problems with his draft
board started in July, when he mailed
back his 2-S deferment, saying he
could not accept a deferment based
on discriminatory criteria.
He remained unclassified until De
cember 23, when his board classified
him 1-A. He has since appealed, ask
ing for the l-O classification.
Alternative Service
However, if he is reclassified l-O,
Harris will have to perform alterna
tive service instead of serving in the
military. He says he is not sure he
will take alternative service if it is

offered. "I am a conscientious objec
tor, but more of a conscientious ob
jector than the draft allows," he com
mented.
The letter sent to President John
son also stated that "There is increas
ing confusion about both our basic
purpose and tactics, and there is in
creasing fear that the course now be
ing pursued may lead us irrevocably
into a major war in Asiaâ€”a war
which many feel could not be won
without recourse to nuclear weapons,
if then."
In an interview with the San Fran
cisco Chronicle, Harris complained
that the letter was "too respectful."
He also denounced the United States
and President Johnson for what he
termed the "national paranoia" of
the Vietnam war.
