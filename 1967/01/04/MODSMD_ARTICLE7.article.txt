# Rent Boycott Limited To Ten Days; Committee Of 15 Will Discuss OFF
## 
### HENRY MULLER CHRIS HARTE 
OFF leaders have radically changed
the nature of the demonstration
which will begin today.
Instead of an indefinite "rent boy
cott" they are now asking all students
living in University residences to
withhold payment of room and board
bills for ten days as an expression of
support for the movement to allow
women to live off campus. The
change, according to OFF leader Janet
Howell, is aimed at trying to "im
prove the atmosphere so that more
positive negotiations can take place."
In line with this, the Committee of
15 has already announced it will meet

Monday afternoon, and members in
dicate the OFF issue will be the first
order of business.
No Penalty
Ten days is the normal period dur
ing which students can defer payment
of their bills without incurring a $5
penalty. OFF had previously sug
gesteed a "rent strike" in which stu
dents would only pay room and board
at the end of winter quarter.
Miss Howell hopes that the new
plan "will remove the feeling that stu
dents are trying to coerce the ad
ministration into accepting their de
mands by threatening them with mea
sures aimed at hurting the University
financially." OFF is now trying to

show its continued concern over thee
lack of communication between ad
ministration and students over the
women off campus issue.
The OFF leaders were in part in
fluenced by a letter President Sterling
wrote to Mary Hanson last Decem
ber, stating that he hoped "the op
portunity for objective review of the
matter will not be jeopardized by ac
tions that might be coercive."
Intense Discussion
One of the advantages of the "rent
delay," according to Miss Howell, is
that it will provide for an intense dis
cussion of the issue during these ten
days.
She is also hoping the administra
tion will take some "positive action"
on the issue, and says she has been as
sured by high officials that it will.
Informed sources say that the most
likely "positive action" will be ap
proval by the Committee of 15 of
the women's request to be allowed to
live off campus.

Miss Howell concedes that it will be
difficult to keep track of the exact
number of students who will delay
their payments in support of the OFF
movement.
The difficulty will occur in deter
mining which people don't pay their
bills on registration day because they
wouldn't anyway and how many will
refuse to in support of OFF's rent
boycott.
According to figures supplied by the
Controller's Office, exactly 50 per cent
of all students paid their room and
board bills after registration day but
before the end of the alloted ten-day
period last winter quarter.
Miss Howell, however, emphasizes
that "numbers are no longer that
significant. The important thing is
that this is being done. Last quar
ter's referendum showed the number
of people supporting the OFF issue."
She was refering to the November
2 vote in which over 2000 students
voted 10-1 in favor of a proposal that
women be allowed to live off campus.

One of the advantages of the "rent
delay," according to Miss Howell, is
that it will provide for an intense dis
cussion of the issue during these ten
days.
She is also hoping the administra
tion will take some "positive action"
on the issue, and says she has been as
sured by high officials that it will.
Informed sources say that the most
likely "positive action" will be ap
proval by the Committee of 15 of
the women's request to be allowed to
live off campus.

Miss Howell concedes that it will be
difficult to keep track of the exact
number of students who will delay
their payments in support of the OFF
movement.
The difficulty will occur in deter
mining which people don't pay their
bills on registration day because they
wouldn't anyway and how many will
refuse to in support of OFF's rent
boycott.
According to figures supplied by the
Controller's Office, exactly 50 per cent
of all students paid their room and
board bills after registration day but
before the end of the alloted ten-day
period last winter quarter.
Miss Howell, however, emphasizes
that "numbers are no longer that
significant. The important thing is
that this is being done. Last quar
ter's referendum showed the number
of people supporting the OFF issue."
She was refering to the November
2 vote in which over 2000 students
voted 10-1 in favor of a proposal that
women be allowed to live off campus.
OFF leaders have radically changed
the nature of the demonstration
which will begin today.
Instead of an indefinite "rent boy
cott" they are now asking all students
living in University residences to
withhold payment of room and board
bills for ten days as an expression of
support for the movement to allow
women to live off campus. The
change, according to OFF leader Janet
Howell, is aimed at trying to "im
prove the atmosphere so that more
positive negotiations can take place."
In line with this, the Committee of
15 has already announced it will meet

Monday afternoon, and members in
dicate the OFF issue will be the first
order of business.
No Penalty
Ten days is the normal period dur
ing which students can defer payment
of their bills without incurring a $5
penalty. OFF had previously sug
gesteed a "rent strike" in which stu
dents would only pay room and board
at the end of winter quarter.
Miss Howell hopes that the new
plan "will remove the feeling that stu
dents are trying to coerce the ad
ministration into accepting their de
mands by threatening them with mea
sures aimed at hurting the University
financially." OFF is now trying to

show its continued concern over thee
lack of communication between ad
ministration and students over the
women off campus issue.
The OFF leaders were in part in
fluenced by a letter President Sterling
wrote to Mary Hanson last Decem
ber, stating that he hoped "the op
portunity for objective review of the
matter will not be jeopardized by ac
tions that might be coercive."
