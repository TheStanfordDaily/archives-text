# 'Grove' Project To Offer Experiment, Coed Living
## 
### HENRY MULLER News Editor 
Thirty-one men and twelve women
have moved into the Phi Delta Theta
house as part of the University's new
experiment with resident education,
now officially referred to as the
"Grove Project."
In addition, 17 non-resident mem
bers will be full-fledged participants,
except that they will be living else
where. All students in the project will
be taking a 5-unit seminar entitled
"Development."
Selection of participants in the
Grove Project took place during finals
week last quarter. According to Pro
fessor Mark Mancall, who is in charge
of the experiment, the 300 applicants
were first divided into categories based
on their sex, class, and major. A
random process was then used to
select a certain number of members
from each category. Mancall em
phasized that this method would in
sure an equitable representation of
the University community.

He pointed out that applicants were
predominantly from the social sci
ences and that a surprising number
came from freshmen, especially wom
en. Mancall expressed his disappoint
ment that more students from the na
tural sciences and engineering did
not apply for the project.
Daily Not Publishing
According to one student participat
ing in the experiment, the fact that
The Daily was not publishing at the
time applications were being taken
may have been critical in preventing
some segments of the University from
finding out about it.
Fifteen faculty members and five
tutors (all graduate students) will
also be members of the Grove Project.
Each of the tutors will lead a section
of the "Development" seminar, the
structure of which will be very loose
so that the students in each section
can select the area they wish to pur
sue in the seminar.
The faculty members will have no
strictly defined functions: they will be
asked to eat several meals a week at
the house and occasionally contribute
to the seminar.
Faculty Resident
Mancall will serve as faculty resi
dent of the house.
The purpose of this experiment, ac
cording to Mancall, is to "show that a
University the size of Stanford can
create a situation in which intellec
tual life and the living situation are
not divorced." He said that one of the
principal reasons for which people like
to move off-campus is that one pres
ently cannot speak of an "intellectual
life" on campus.
"Most attempts at education," he
says, "end up with the participants
talking about themselves instead of
ideas. We want to try to get away
from contemplating ourselves—inter
esting though we may be—and rec
ognize the relevance of in-depth anal
ysis. In our seminars we will try to
contrive the kind of institution in
which we engage in this kind of anl
ysis."
Each member of the house will be
required to write a paper before the
end of Spring quarter.
Small Environment
There will be "as little house gov
ernment as possible," says Mancall.
He hopes that in this small environ
ment people will be able to handle
problems on a personal basis.
What if the Grove Project fails?
According to one of the people se
lected to participate in it, this will
show that non-random selection is
necessary for a living group to suc
ceed or that the idea of a residence
University is outdated.
If the experiment is a success,
a method will be sought by which the
project can be continued the following
year. Evaluation of the Grove Project
will be done by faculty and adminis
tration, but primarily by the students
participating in it.

Each of the tutors will lead a section
of the "Development" seminar, the
structure of which will be very loose
so that the students in each section
can select the area they wish to pur
sue in the seminar.
The faculty members will have no
strictly defined functions: they will be
asked to eat several meals a week at
the house and occasionally contribute
to the seminar.
Faculty Resident
Mancall will serve as faculty resi
dent of the house.
The purpose of this experiment, ac
cording to Mancall, is to "show that a
University the size of Stanford can
create a situation in which intellec
tual life and the living situation are
not divorced." He said that one of the
principal reasons for which people like
to move off-campus is that one pres
ently cannot speak of an "intellectual
life" on campus.
"Most attempts at education," he
says, "end up with the participants
talking about themselves instead of
ideas. We want to try to get away
from contemplating ourselves—inter
esting though we may be—and rec
ognize the relevance of in-depth anal
ysis. In our seminars we will try to
contrive the kind of institution in
which we engage in this kind of anl
ysis."
Each member of the house will be
required to write a paper before the
end of Spring quarter.
Small Environment
There will be "as little house gov
ernment as possible," says Mancall.
He hopes that in this small environ
ment people will be able to handle
problems on a personal basis.
What if the Grove Project fails?
According to one of the people se
lected to participate in it, this will
show that non-random selection is
necessary for a living group to suc
ceed or that the idea of a residence
University is outdated.
If the experiment is a success,
a method will be sought by which the
project can be continued the following
year. Evaluation of the Grove Project
will be done by faculty and adminis
tration, but primarily by the students
participating in it.

Kathy Golding, pictured above, is among tlie 12 women and 31 men who moved
into the former Phi Delta Theta fraternity house yesterday. All 43 students will
live in the residence nntil June as part of a coed housing and education experi
ment, known as the Grove Project
Thirty-one men and twelve women
have moved into the Phi Delta Theta
house as part of the University's new
experiment with resident education,
now officially referred to as the
"Grove Project."
In addition, 17 non-resident mem
bers will be full-fledged participants,
except that they will be living else
where. All students in the project will
be taking a 5-unit seminar entitled
"Development."
Selection of participants in the
Grove Project took place during finals
week last quarter. According to Pro
fessor Mark Mancall, who is in charge
of the experiment, the 300 applicants
were first divided into categories based
on their sex, class, and major. A
random process was then used to
select a certain number of members
from each category. Mancall em
phasized that this method would in
sure an equitable representation of
the University community.

He pointed out that applicants were
predominantly from the social sci
ences and that a surprising number
came from freshmen, especially wom
en. Mancall expressed his disappoint
ment that more students from the na
tural sciences and engineering did
not apply for the project.
Daily Not Publishing
According to one student participat
ing in the experiment, the fact that
The Daily was not publishing at the
time applications were being taken
may have been critical in preventing
some segments of the University from
finding out about it.
Fifteen faculty members and five
tutors (all graduate students) will
also be members of the Grove Project.
