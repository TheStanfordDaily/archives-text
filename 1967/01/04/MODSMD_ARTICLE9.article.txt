# C15 Recommendation:
## Open House Regulations 
### 
The following Is a partial text
of the Committee of Fifteen rec
ommendations on Open House
regulations, passed by the com
mittee November 23, 1966.
The Committee of Fifteen un
animously (two members ab
sent) recommends the adoption
of the open house policy em
bodied in the "Proposed Open
House Regulation" which is set
forth in Appendix A to this re
port.
The basic premise on which
our recommendation is based
is that a residence University
such as Stanford should try to
provide optimum living condi
tions for those of its students
who choose or are required to
live on campus.
To us, this premise means,
among other things, that those
who reside in them should have
as much freedom as is prac
ticable to choose, individually
and collectively, how these facil
ities will be used.
Given this basic premise, two
postulates seem to us to follow.
First, every restriction on a
student's use of his own room
ought to have an affirmative
justification, other than the fact
that it has heretofore existed.
Second, to the largest extent pos
sible, limitations on use should
be determined by those who live
in the residences rather than by
University regulation.

In our view, the underlying
matter of principle involved in
the open house issue has already
been decided by the University.
Visitors of the opposite sex are
now permitted to be in the
rooms of Stanford students for
substantial periods of time each
week. Consequently ,we have not
debated the acceptability of open
house as a matter of principle,
but, instead, have concentrated
on two pragmatic questions:
1. Should the number of per
missible open house hours each
week be expanded if the students
so desire?
2. Who should decide if and to
what extent open house hours
should be expanded?
Committee's Answer
Our answer is that, subject to
certain limitations discussed be
low, open house hours should be
those which are agreed upon by
students living in each residence.
Thus, we propose to make it pos
sible for the students in each
residence, except for freshman
residences during the autumn
quarter, to set their own open
house hours, provided than an
open house would not be permit
ted to last beyond 2:30 a.m. or
begin before 10 a.m.
We do not believe, on the
basis of the evidence that has
been presented to us, that most
residences will in fact set open
house hours at or even near the
maximum which our posed reg
ulations would permit. We are
particularly doubtful that most
women's residences will desire
to have open house hours ap
proaching this maximum; in
deed, we suspect that many of
them will set hours at even less
than the "basic" open house
hours which we recommend.
In paragraph II of our Pro
posed Regulation we propose a
"basic" open house regulation,
to prevail in the absence of af
firmative action by the students
concerned.
Two Arguments Considered
In formulating our rec
mendations on open house hours
we have carefully considered
two arguments which we antic
ipate some might make against
the degree of latitude which we
recommend. The first argument
is that liberalized open house
hours may unfairly inconve
nience those residents who do
not wish to participate in them.
The second is that expanded
open house hours may result in
improper sexual behavior.

We realize that, while there
is widespread student support
for expanded open house hours,
there may be some students who
will feel that the privacy and in
formality of their residence will
be impaired by a more liberal
open house policy.
We have concluded that the
most practical and educationally
desirable way to strike the nec
essary accommodation is for the
students in each residence to
balance the various competing
interests themselves, provided
only that minority interests are
adequately considered and pro
tected.
Secret Ballot
However, we recommend three
important safeguards. One is
that all decisions to modify what
we recommend as the basic pol
icy must be made by secret bal
lot, to protect those students
who may be in a minority from
overreaching social pressure.
Second, while open house hours
can be reduced from the basic
provision by a simple majority
vote, they can be expanded only
by a secret-ballot vote of three
fourths of all of the members
of the living group. Third, open
house between 2:30 a.m. and 10
a.m. is not permitted.
For some a central concern
is whether more liberal open
house will encourage sexual re
lationships among students. We
think that this concern is exag
gerated. The students deny that
they seek more liberal open
house hours for such purposes.
Moreover, they deny that a Uni
versity residence is an ideal, or
even a likely, place for sexual
relationships. We regard this as
a false issue which should not
deter the University from adopt
ing what it otherwise considers
to be sound policy.
Freshmen In Autumn
We recommend that special
provision be made for freshman
residences during autumn quar
ter. The basic provision (four
days a week from noon until
midnight) would apply to them,
and they could shorten these
hours by secret-ballot majority
vote. A freshman residence
could not, however, expand open
house hours beyond the basic
provision until winter quarter.
We recognize that this special
regulation for freshmen dis
criminates between those who
live with upperclassmen in Stern
Hall and other freshmen, inas
much as the residents of Stern,
to whom the proposed freshman
restriction does not apply, may
elect a more liberal open house
policy than that expressed in the
basic provision. Nevertheless,
the discrimination is a rational
one, we believe, because the ex
perience with the academic de
mands of the University and
dormitory living conditions,
which is lacking in Wilbur dur
ing autumn quarter, exists in
Stern.
In recommending a modifica
tion of the open house regula
tions, we expect that living con
ditions for those students who
choose or are required to live on
campus will be improved.
