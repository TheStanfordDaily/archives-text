Mr. Edward A. Kokalas August 25, 1966
Michigan State University
1130 Beech Street, Apt. 143
East Lansing, Michigan
Dear Mr. Kokalas:
There is an urgent need, I believe, for a serious discussion between campus and corporation.
I am genuinely concerned about recent studies which indicate that an alarming percentage of college
students have no interest in pursuing careers in business. Many of these students show little respect
for business and have a condescending attitude towards those who do choose it as a career.
Some say business leaves them cold. Lacks action. That it's boring, unimaginative, stuffy and
self-seeking. Others say they don't want to be lost in the corporate crowd and that there is little chance
of early recognition for a young man in business. Some question whether business offers the
opportunity for the personal satisfaction that comes from humanitarian service. Their answer: Join the
Peace Corps or VISTA; teach; or enter a service profession.
If you are motivated toward teaching, medicine, government or law, I say go at it eagerly. They are
valuable careers for which we in business have great respect and admiration. Many of our most able
business leaders have professional backgrounds and our everyday operations bring us into close 112
contact with men outside of industry.
I However, don't sell business short. If you shrug off a business career because you think it offers no
excitement, no challenge, no chance for recognition or to make a meaningful contribution to society ...
I think you're wrong.
A tremendous opportunity for human and social betterment may well slip away if brighter
i students turn their backs on business for reasons not necessarily valid. The coming years promise
I fantastic new developments in the sciences, electronics, transportation or just about any field you can
name. However, realization of these great potentials requires fresh thinking, young, vigorous minds
able to channel ideas creatively and productively . . . able to make decisions . . . able to generate
action, the very thing you crave.
This is why I'm concerned. If I read some of you right, we're in trouble. Something has broken down,
somewhere. Perhaps certain college students are misinformed and should be set straight. Or maybe
we in business had best undertake a basic reappraisal of our way of doing things. If changes are in
order, I'd like to find out.
Frankly, we don't understand each other well enough ... we don't communicate enough. And,
therefore, I propose we set a specific course to try to resolve this.
Let's discuss business openly, two-way, pro and con, on the pages of your campus newspaper.
You express the views of those around you. I'll respond. Tell me what you think is wrong with business,
what might be changed. Why you feel there are more exciting opportunities elsewhere. If neither of us
pulls our punches, I think we have a lot to gain.
Interested? I hope so. Send me your thoughts regarding business as well as an indication that you
will join in a discussion. I will print your comments and mine in subsequent issues of this paper.
We can't do this too soon. Tomorrow's problems and opportunities won't wait.
Sincerely,
Robert W. Galvin

In August, I wrote this letter to Edward Kokalas, Michigan State student. □Itis an invitation to a dialogue about
business —a dialogue which has been appearing regularly in this newspaper for the past few months. Mr. Kokalas'
response was provocative and to the point. I hope I've answered some of the questions he raised. □ Shortly
after the dialogues started, I began to get letters from other students and faculty members expressing interest
in the series and asking why not open the dialogues to others —get the views of everyone on campus. Students,
teachers, and administrators. □ That's exactly what I'd like to do. And while I obviously can't promise that every
letter will appear in print, I can assure you that I will read each and respond. □ Whatever your major study, what
ever your ideas —I'd like to hear from you. You may want to agree or disagree with some of the past dialogues or
bring up new issues that haven't been explored. You may just want to sound off about business. It's up to you.
