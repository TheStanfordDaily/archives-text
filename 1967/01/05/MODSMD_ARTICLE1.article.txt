# OFF: Their Concerted Effort For Change
## 
### MAGGIE McCOMAS 
The "de-escalation" of OFF tactics
in calling for a limited rent strike to
last only 10 days marks another at
tempt on the part of OFF leaders to
encourage demonstration of support
of the movement from a larger seg
ment of the student body.
The action was taken in order to
gain support of students who would
have avoided the "coercive" measures
proposed earlier, in the form of an
indefinite boycott of room and board
payments. The change was also in
fluenced by views which President
Sterling expressed last month, when
he stated that "objective review" of
the matter depended partly upon re
fraining from the use of "coercive"
tactics.
Board Review
At the December 16 meeting of the
Board of Trustees, the members de
clined the request of OFF leaders to
meet as a group for "direct consulta
tion with student representatives" con
cerning the proposed change. In a
statement issued by the Board at that
time President Sterling stated that the

Board is currently reviewing its resi
dential policy for undergraduates.
Sterling added, however, that "it is
expected that students will participate
in the review and that student opinion
will be taken into account in the final
recommendations." The Board stated
that it does not participate directly in
reviews of policy, but considers rec
ommendations submitted by the presi
dent.
Further encouragement for possible
action by the Board of Trustees con
cerning the matter may be indicated
in the results of a survey made among
women students earlier fall quarter.
The results of the survey were made
available to President Sterling's office
Tuesday by Dean Gordon, and will be
made public at a later date. The ex
tensive survey concerning hours, phys
ical living conditions and many other
aspects of residence living and gave
students a chance to evaluate the pres
ent system and make suggestions for
modifications.
OFF!
The first direct action of the OFF
movement began early fall quarter

with the "Undergraduate Women's
Bill of Rights," a petition circulated
by OFF organizer Janet Howell, and
evenutally signed by 60 per cent of
all undergraduate women by October
15.
Since The Daily ceased publication
for fall qiiarter on December 2, many
members of the Stanford community
were not informed of events concern
ing OFF which developed toward the
end of the quarter. The chronology
of events from the date of the petition
is as follows:
October 16: Janet Howell informs
President Sterling of the result of the
petition in a letter (published in The
Daily October 19).
October 20: LASSU places OFF on
the ballot for the October 31 student
referendum.
October 27: Fred O. Glover replies
to Miss Howell's letter .saying that
President Sterling is out of town at
present and will reply upon return
ing.
October 31: Students vote 10 to 1 in
referendum to permit undergraduate

women to live off campus if they so
choose.
November 3: Janet Howell writes
second letter to Sterling, informing
him of result of referendum and ask
ing for some "concrete response."
November 11: Trustee Robert Gug
genhime replies to letter from Miss
Howell (September 7) telling her that:
1) action could be taken only after a
full report from the president's office;
2) it is a "custom and tradition" for
Stanford to be a "100 per cent resi
dence university insofar as women un
dergraduate students are concerned";
3) men also would be required to live
on campus if there wer sufficient hous
ing available; and 4) students should
be aware of the residence policy be
fore coming to Stanford and are free
"to choose Stanford or a- 1 "'"
tution where the rules are different."
November 12: Sterling sends letter
to several woment students who had
written him concerning OFF and in
cludes copies of the Guggenhime let
ter.
December 7: Women's Strike for

Equal Rights (WSER) is organized
(later changed to Women's Commit
tee for Equal Rights) and sends letter
to Sterling stating the terms of the
proposed rent strike, requesting from
Sterling: 1) a statement of agreement
with the principle behind the issue; 2)
a"promise to honor the results of the
student referendum by bringing the
matter before the Board of Trustees
immediately"; and 3) a "public guar
antee" to work with the Board for an
arrangement whereby undergraduate
women "will be officially permitted to
live off-campus beginning no later
than Autumn Quarter, 1967."
December 9: Dave Harris, Janet Ho
well, and additional supporters speak
at a noon rally urging students to de
lay payment of their room and board
bills Winter Quarter. Leaders em
phasize the action will not be illegal,
and that there will be no penalty in
curred within the 10-day period fol
lowing reg day.
Alternative
An alternative to the strike is pro
posed by Carol Christ, Gail King, and
Georgia Cullen. Leaflets are distrib

uted opposing the strike on the
grounds that such action would clog
channels of communication and a defi
cit resulting from withholding of
payments would result ultimately in
increased tuition of room and board
payments.
December 10: The Stanford Deadly
is published, a one-shot tabloid con
sisting of articles representing vary
ing degrees of opinion of the strike
tactics and related issues.
December 12: Sterling receives let
ter from Mary Hanson of WCER
making suggestions for filling living
spaces which would be vacated by
women moving off campus, using sug
gestions of Dean Bushnell's survey
and ASSU Housing Commission to
make on-campus living more appeal
ing, and admission of a higher ratio of
women.
December 14: Sterling replies to
Miss Hanson's letter, assuring that ex
isting policy would be reviewed and
stating his hopes that the "opportun
ity for objective review of the matter
will not be jeopardized by actions that
might be considered coercive."
