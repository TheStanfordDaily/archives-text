# Mem Aud To Screen East German Flicks
## 
### 
Three contemporary films
from East Germany, never be
fore shown in the United States,
have arrived at Stanford Univer
sity and will be screened today
and tomorrow.
The films are Bruno Apitz'
"Naked Among Wolves," Karl
Jacob's "Description of Sum
mer," and Chista Wolf's "The
Divided Heaven." They are be
lieved to be the first East Ger
man films to be allowed show
ing in the United States.
Showing Today
"Divided Heaven" will be
shown today at 4:15 p.m.; "Na
ked Among Wolves" and "De
scription of a Summer" will be
presented tomorrow beginning
at 7:30 p.m. All showings will be
in Memorial Auditorium.
Sponsoring the films is Prof.
Helmut Boeninger of the Mod
ern European Languages De
partment; he arranged to have
the films shown here while visit
ing East Berlin last summer.
They are based on East Ger
man best-selling novels which
Prof. Boeninger's Modem Ger
man class is studying.

"Naked Among Wolves," two
hours long, deals with the events
preceding the liberation of the
inmates of the Buchenwald pris
on camp. "Descriptions of a
Summer" shows the aspiration
and difficulties encountered by
the East German regime in
building a new society. "Divided
Heaven" deals with the division
of Germany and the resulting
conflict in lives and loyalty.
The three, originally scheduled
for viewing during late Novem
ber, were mislaid in Prague and
failed to arrive on time. They
have now been airfreighted via
Prague, Havana, Mexico City,
Los Angeles, and San Francisco.
Cubans Refuse
It was at first believed that
Cuban authorities had held up
the film shipment. Prof. Boen
inger said that Cuban officials
refused to accept a direct phone
call from him and advised him
to make inquiries through the
Swiss Legation in Havana or the
International Red Cross.
Cable and telephone inquiries
to the East German authorities
helped track the missing ship
ment to Prague, where the error
was discovered.
The admission charge to the
films is nominal, and English
synopses will be available at the
door.

the films shown here while visit
ing East Berlin last summer.
They are based on East Ger
man best-selling novels which
Prof. Boeninger's Modem Ger
man class is studying.

"Naked Among Wolves," two
hours long, deals with the events
preceding the liberation of the
inmates of the Buchenwald pris
on camp. "Descriptions of a
Summer" shows the aspiration
and difficulties encountered by
the East German regime in
building a new society. "Divided
Heaven" deals with the division
of Germany and the resulting
conflict in lives and loyalty.
The three, originally scheduled
for viewing during late Novem
ber, were mislaid in Prague and
failed to arrive on time. They
have now been airfreighted via
Prague, Havana, Mexico City,
Los Angeles, and San Francisco.
Cubans Refuse
It was at first believed that
Cuban authorities had held up
the film shipment. Prof. Boen
inger said that Cuban officials
refused to accept a direct phone
call from him and advised him
to make inquiries through the
Swiss Legation in Havana or the
International Red Cross.
Cable and telephone inquiries
to the East German authorities
helped track the missing ship
ment to Prague, where the error
was discovered.
The admission charge to the
films is nominal, and English
synopses will be available at the
door.

from East Germany, never be
fore shown in the United States,

sity and will be screened today
