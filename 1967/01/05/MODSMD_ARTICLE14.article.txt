# Pass-Fail A Success
## 
### 
Of the 1008 students who took
courses on a pass-fail basis last
quarter, 930 passed their courses,
37 failed, and 41 received incom
pletes, according to figures re
leased yesterday by University
Registrar Harvey Hall. This was
the first quarter that pass-fail
grading had been used on the
undergraduate level at Stanford.
Two others received no grade
at all which is due to either an
administrative error or the fail
ure of the student to attend any
classes. Three students wound
up with' a W grade, implying
that they withdrew from the
class without permission.
The pass-fail system was a suc
cess fall quarter, Hall said, be
cause it served the purpose of
allowing students to take gen
eral courses outside their spe
cialized fields.
"There have been unfortunate
by-products," Hall commented,
"But the scheme is worth the
negative elements that have
reared their ugly heads."
The procedure for enrolling In
a course on a pass fail basis has
been changed this quarter. Now
students may pick up an IBM
card at the Registrar's informa
tion office and return it with
their packet of class cards dur
ing the first two weeks of the
quarter.
In the past, instructors have
been responsible for reporting
the intention of a student to
take a course on a pass-fail basis.
Hall said that graduate stu
dents may also take courses for
pass-fail. He indicated that some
graduate courses, especially in
the medical school, have been
using the system for several
years. Graduate students may
also take undergraduate courses
on a pass-fail basis.
