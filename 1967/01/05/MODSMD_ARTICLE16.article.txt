ten point advantage against the
cold shooting Stanford team.
Mervyn Jackson led Utah in
the surge that carried the Utes
to a 5747 half time advantage.
Jackson had 32 points for the
game in one of the finest individ*
uaal performances faced by the
Indians this year.
STANFORD 82, ARIZONA 67

winning track with a late game
rally paced by surprising sopho
more Ed Martin. Stanford was
trailing by two points when Mar
tin hit with three consecutive
long shots to boast the Indians
into the lead.
Stanford's cold shooting, 30

sharpshooting Martin and Pe
tersmeyer, the Indians forced
Arizona out of their zone, and
won handily.
STANFORD 67, ILLINOIS 81

tin, and Harris all scored in
double figures. Baker led the In
dians scorers with 13.
STANFORD 74, lOWA 77

the Indians.
Stanford had fallen behind by

gap behind the steady play of
Art Harris. Harris finished the
game as high man with 19
points.
STANFORD 88, DePAUL 75
In the opening round of the
Oklahoma City All - American
holiday tournament the Indians

Arizona out of their zone, and
won handily.

double figures. Baker led the In
dians scorers with 13.
