# Vogelpohl Takes Second In Spartan Wrestling Tourney
## 
### NICK SELBY 
Bill Vogelpohl, 160 pounder,
won a second place and heavy
weight Rick Lindsley took a
third to account for Stanford's
only places in the Northern
California Invitation wrestling
tournament at San Jose State
College Dec. 3, 1966.
Cal Poly of San Luis Obispo
won nine of the eleven weight
classes for a total of 120 points,
way ahead of Fresno State's 67,
San Jose's 48, Humbolt State's
37, and Stanford's 27.
The Indian grapplers face the
tough Fresno St. wrestlers here
Saturday night. It promises to
be one of the tougher matches of
the season for the team.
Caught Between Styles
Coach Jerry Budzik was dis
appointed with the showing of
the Stanford team, but explained
there were several reasons. Prob
ably most important, the day
before the tournament, Captain
Len Borchers sprained his an
kle. He was unable to wrestle
and there was a corresponding
drop in the morale of the other
wrestlers.
The other reason was that

coach Budzik had reworked the
wrestling styles of nearly every
one on the team. He explained
that in the tougher second round
matches, where most of the Stan
ford men lost, the wrestlers lost
confidence in their new moves
and reverted to their old styles.
The result was that the wres
tlers were caught using moves
they hadn't practiced. With each
loss, there was a drop in team
morale, which combined with
the absence of Borcher's psy
chological leadership, precluded
any chance for victory on both
the varsity and freshman teams.
Victory Trail Ends
Vogelpohl's victory trail ended
in the final round against the na
tional small college champ at
152 last year, Dennis Downing
from Cal Poly. His 6-0 loss fol
lowed impressive 5-3 wins over
Carther Smith, UC at Davis, and
Leroy Evans from Humboldt
State.
Rick Lindsley was shoved into
the consolations when he lost a
referee's decision to Larry Stiff
of the University of Nevada, the
eventual second place man in
the division. He won 6-0 and 5-0

decisions for the third place.
145 pounder John Suttle ad
vanced to the finals of the con
solations, but was unable to
wrestle there because of a se
verely sprained shoulder. Earlier,
he had taken 8-9 and 12-0 wins,
and dropped a 3-0 decision.
Rocky Carroll, at 123 pounds,
almost won a third place, but
lost in the finals of the consola
tions, 6-0. 177 pounder Bud Hol
lingsberry won his first two con
tests, but lost in the semifinals
and the consolations and didn't
get a place.
Others who gained first round
wins were 191 pounder Terry
Crenshaw (1-0) and 152 pounder
John Cautrakan (pin in 6:49).
Frosh Enter Six
The freshman team from Stan
ford had only six wrestlers.
Among those who won matches
were Van Bennett, 137 pounds,
in a first round pin, and Brian
Smith, 160 pounds, in a 6-0 first
round decision.
One of the freshman team's
best prospects, 177 pounder Bill
Ross, separated his shoulder the
day before the meet and was un
able to wrestle.
