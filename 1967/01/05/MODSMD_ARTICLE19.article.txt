# Papoose Prospects Uncertain; Hoopsters Face SJS Friday
## 
### BILL GRAHAM 
Prospects for Stanford's fresh
man basketball team are, for a
few weeks, still uncertain. After
the long lay-off for exams and
then Christmas, Coach Bill Tur
ner does not know what to ex
pect from his team as its heads
into its third game this Friday
against San Jose State after
only three days of practice.
The Papoose's two games be
fore Christmas indicated very

little about what can be expected
from the team. The frosh got
into foul trouble against the Uni
versity of San Francisco and
lost, 77-65. Against a weak team
from Shasta Junior College the
little Cards walked away with it,
107-72.
'Paper Tiger?'
On paper at least the Frosh
seem to have a good strong
team. Chuck Moore, the team's
best shooter and co-captain, will
start at one forward spot and
Steve Kuchenbecker, at 6-6 and
215 pounds, will hold down the
other forward spot.
Larry Rosenzweig at 6-10 will
be the usual starter at center,
but he has been sick for sev
eral weeks and will certainly
miss the two games this week
end. Filling in lor him will be
Bill Palmer, who will be counted
on, when Rosenzweig returns, as
the relief man at either for
ward or center.

At the guard spots, co-captain
Guy Smythe (6-0), whom Tur
ner describes as a very good
competitor, and Bruce Wilson (5-
10) will start for the frosh. Bill
Barber and Greg Osborne are
still fighting it out to see who
will be number three man.
'Power Plans'
Coach Turner was vague about
his game strategy, but plans to
overpower his opponents, since
he has a fairly big team, and try
lor Ihe second and third shots.
But he is also quick to point
out that a large percentage of
the teams that the frosh will be
competing against will be just
as big. In fact Turner thinks that
the area freshman teams are
the "best in eight or nine years."
In the nine years he has been
frosh coach, Turner's teams have
compiled a 96-49 record and last
year he had his best season as
his squad won 15 and dropped
only two.

'Power Plans'
Coach Turner was vague about
his game strategy, but plans to
overpower his opponents, since
he has a fairly big team, and try
lor Ihe second and third shots.
But he is also quick to point
out that a large percentage of
the teams that the frosh will be
competing against will be just
as big. In fact Turner thinks that
the area freshman teams are
the "best in eight or nine years."
In the nine years he has been
frosh coach, Turner's teams have
compiled a 96-49 record and last
year he had his best season as
his squad won 15 and dropped
only two.
Prospects for Stanford's fresh
man basketball team are, for a
few weeks, still uncertain. After
the long lay-off for exams and
then Christmas, Coach Bill Tur
ner does not know what to ex
pect from his team as its heads
into its third game this Friday
against San Jose State after
only three days of practice.
The Papoose's two games be
fore Christmas indicated very

little about what can be expected
from the team. The frosh got
into foul trouble against the Uni
versity of San Francisco and
lost, 77-65. Against a weak team
from Shasta Junior College the
little Cards walked away with it,
107-72.
'Paper Tiger?'
On paper at least the Frosh
seem to have a good strong
team. Chuck Moore, the team's
best shooter and co-captain, will
start at one forward spot and
Steve Kuchenbecker, at 6-6 and
215 pounds, will hold down the
other forward spot.
Larry Rosenzweig at 6-10 will
be the usual starter at center,
but he has been sick for sev
eral weeks and will certainly
miss the two games this week
end. Filling in lor him will be
Bill Palmer, who will be counted
on, when Rosenzweig returns, as
the relief man at either for
ward or center.

At the guard spots, co-captain
Guy Smythe (6-0), whom Tur
ner describes as a very good
competitor, and Bruce Wilson (5-
10) will start for the frosh. Bill
Barber and Greg Osborne are
still fighting it out to see who
will be number three man.
