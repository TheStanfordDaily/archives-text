# C's And D's Prevail In Winter Reg
## "Den Of Thieves?" 
### STEVE GRUBER Registration Editor 
"There were never this many C's
and D's before," said one student, as
he looked, not at his grades, but at
the long registration line ahead of
him.
This was just one of the many scenes
yesterday as 10,308 students trooped
through Memorial Auditorium, com
mencing winter quarter.
"Everything went smoothly," com
mented University Registrar Harvey
Hall. "Sometimes the lines were long,
but we got everyone through in time."
Not everyone registered yesterday,
however, and Hall expects the final
figure to top 11,000. Yesterday's total
was up 147 from the first day of win
ter quarter registration of 1966.
Fewer Women
There were 7989 male registrants,
up 199 from last winter, and 2319
women, down 52 since last year. Hall
had no explanation for the drop in
the number of women students. The
situation is even more confused by the
figures released by the Dean's office
which show that 49 women transfers
were admitted yesterday.
Hall stated that he expects more
late registrants than usual due to the
midweek registration date. Another
factor is that the usual airlines stu
dents half-fare was not in effect Jan
uary 2, 3, and 4. Hall speculated that
students would rather register late
than pay twice as much just to get
to Stanford.
OFF Movement
Only three card tables were set up
near the Pavilion, considerably fewer

than last year. One of these was spon
sored by the OFF movement, an or
ganization trying to win Stanford
women the privilege of living off cam
pus. Susan Hudgens, one of the girls
at the table, reported that the re
sponse was good.
Control of the organizations solicit
ing near the Pavilion is in the hands
of the student financial manager, al
though final responsibility rests with
the Registrar.
Registration days are the busiest
of the year for the Registrar's office.
Hall said that he hires 40 additional
employees, mainly students, to help
out. Many faculty wives also work in
the Pavilion during Registration.

The registrar has to be at work at
6 a.m. during registration, Hall com
mented. Although the registration
packets are finished the day before
registration ,they are not delivered at
that time to Memorial Auditorium for
security reasons. Trucks from the
Corporation Yard are loaded about 90
minutes before the first group of reg
istrants file through the auditorium.
Registration figures have been
climbing since the end of World War
11. 10,161 students registered on the
first day last year, 10,452 showed up
in 1965, and 10,211 put their money on
the table in 1964.
Late registration will continue un
til January 13.

him.
This was just one of the many scenes
yesterday as 10,308 students trooped
through Memorial Auditorium, com
mencing winter quarter.
"Everything went smoothly," com
mented University Registrar Harvey
Hall. "Sometimes the lines were long,
but we got everyone through in time."
Not everyone registered yesterday,
however, and Hall expects the final
figure to top 11,000. Yesterday's total
was up 147 from the first day of win
ter quarter registration of 1966.
Fewer Women
There were 7989 male registrants,
up 199 from last winter, and 2319
women, down 52 since last year. Hall
had no explanation for the drop in
the number of women students. The
situation is even more confused by the
figures released by the Dean's office
which show that 49 women transfers
were admitted yesterday.
Hall stated that he expects more
late registrants than usual due to the
midweek registration date. Another
factor is that the usual airlines stu
dents half-fare was not in effect Jan
uary 2, 3, and 4. Hall speculated that
students would rather register late
than pay twice as much just to get
to Stanford.
OFF Movement
Only three card tables were set up
near the Pavilion, considerably fewer

than last year. One of these was spon
sored by the OFF movement, an or
ganization trying to win Stanford
women the privilege of living off cam
pus. Susan Hudgens, one of the girls
at the table, reported that the re
sponse was good.
Control of the organizations solicit
ing near the Pavilion is in the hands
of the student financial manager, al
though final responsibility rests with
the Registrar.
Registration days are the busiest
of the year for the Registrar's office.
Hall said that he hires 40 additional
employees, mainly students, to help
out. Many faculty wives also work in
the Pavilion during Registration.

The registrar has to be at work at
6 a.m. during registration, Hall com
mented. Although the registration
packets are finished the day before
registration ,they are not delivered at
that time to Memorial Auditorium for
security reasons. Trucks from the
Corporation Yard are loaded about 90
minutes before the first group of reg
istrants file through the auditorium.
Registration figures have been
climbing since the end of World War
11. 10,161 students registered on the
first day last year, 10,452 showed up
in 1965, and 10,211 put their money on
the table in 1964.
Late registration will continue un
til January 13.

"There were never this many C's
and D's before," said one student, as
he looked, not at his grades, but at
the long registration line ahead of
him.
