# Open House Policy
## 
### 
The Committee of Fifteen's recommendation
on open house policy is a balanced and well
considered statement, acknowledging both the
need for privacy and the rights of minority in a
residence situation.
More significant, however, than the proposed
liberalization of present policy, which limits
open house to two nights a week, is the recogni
tion that students ought to have the right and
responsibility for formulating regulations effect
ing their lives in the residence. The committee
report suggests a basic open house schedule of
four nights a week from noon to midnight for
all University residences. However, the basic
policy serves only as a guideline which a ma
jority of students in the living group may re
duce, if they so desire, or expand to a maximum
of seven days a week from 10:30 a.m. to 2:30
a.m.
Of particular concern in the past has been
the rights of the minority. The committee, while
providing for secret ballot in the voting of
house policy changes, frankly admits that an ef
fective policy can work only if the members of
house show a high degree of mutual considera
tion in their use of the open house privilege. No
open house standard, including the present pol
icy, can guarantee that the privacy of two will
not pre-empt the privacy of one. Yet to the ex
tent that a liberalized open house policy sup
#

poses a high degree of maturity, it is also a
vehicle for attaining greater maturity through
the exercise of responsibility.
The committee's recommendation provides a
logical starting point for alleviating the un
healthy conflict in law between ASSU regula
tions and University policy which has existed
since last spring. The conflict has been beneficial
neither to the University whose moral authority
has been diminished by its failure to uphold its
standing policy, nor to the students who must
live in this quandry.
Those who contend that it is too soon, be
cause of liberalizations of liquor policy and
women's social regulations enacted last year,, to
seek further liberalization of student regulations
seem to neglect what has been accomplished.
The assimilation of these large-scale changes has
taken place with little incident and serves to
underscore that the changes were belated ac
knowledgment of the maturity long present in
the student body.
The Committee of Fifteen has offered solid
recommendationsâ€”but only recommendations.
It now rests with President Sterling to study
the proposal and refei the question to the Board
of Trustees. In light of the work done by the
University Student Affairs and Services Com
mittee last year, we do not believe it unreason
able to expect Board consideration of the mat
ter during the present academic year.
