## Donner Denies Kaplan Charge 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
I am taking the liberty of
writing you in response to a let
ter of Professor Kaplan which
was printed in The Daily some
time ago.
I think that Professor Kap
lan's attack on your account of
his presentation is itself highly
biased and inaccurate. The story
of which he complains was not a
"crude parody"; it accurately
summarized what took place.
To give color to his intemper
ate charge, Professor Kaplan
states that I "lectured" (the
sneer is barely suppressed) the
audience. I merely quoted in con
text relevant extracts from Su
preme Court decisions which in
my view would have justified re
sisting the HUAC subpoena. Nor
is this my view alone. It is
shared by the American Civil
Liberties Union, the New York
Times, at least two Stanford
philosophy professors, the Aca
demic Senate of the University
of Michigan and a large number
of distinguished constitutional
law experts.
Constitutional law is obviously
not Professor Kaplan's forte.
This was demonstrated by Pro
fessor Kaplan's reliance in the
course of our discussion on a
Supreme Court case, De Greg
ory v. New Hampshire. The Su
preme Court in that case decided
by a 6-3 vote that resistance to
compelled interrogation by a
state anti-subversive committee
was justified on First Amend
ment grounds.
I am at a loss to understand
how the case supports his posi
tion. Is this the decision point
ing "clearly in the other direc
tion" which Professor Kaplan
charges that I ignored? If it is
not, I do not know what cases
Professor Kaplan has in mind.
In any event, the issue is not
whether the cases would con
clusively support the University,
but rather whether there was a
reasonable possibility of a suc
cessful resistance on constitu
tional grounds.
I similarly cannot understand
why Professor Kaplan denounces
The Daily story as less than

forthright because it referred to
a statement I made explaining
the basis for a contention in my
Nation article that Stanford had
not even waited for the sub
poena. The reporter gave an ac
curate account of what I said.
Nor is it clear to me why I
should have apologized for mak
ing the charge. On the contrary,
I think that if an apology is due
from anyone, it is due from Pro
fessor Kaplan. Professor Kap
lan contends that the evidence
did not "even give reasonable
grounds to suspect" that the
names had been leaked before
the subpoena was complied with.
But Professor Kaplan misstates
the evidence upon the basis of
which I reached the conclusion
that the lists had been turned
over without a subpoena.
When a student is confronted
In a detailed interview (not with
the FBI, as Professor Kaplan
erroneously states, but with a
security agency which made a
field check of a student's loy
alty) with information which
could only have been obtained
from a list in the University's
possession, and when a HUAC
investigation confronts the same
student with the same informa
tion uniquely in the possession
of the University, it can hardly
be claimed that such evidei -e is
"flimsy" or that I owe someone
an apology for making the un
derlying charge.
Professor Kaplan likewise mis
informs your readers when he
states that the issue at Haver
ford involved something resem
bling the subpoenaing of a stu
dent's examination or a profes
sor's class notes. The document
in question was a letter sent to
the Haverford authorities by a
student involving a political or
ganization on the campus—a sit
uation closely comparable to that
present here. He is also inac
curate in attributing to me a
contention that the Stanford
campus is "ridden with spies"—
a form of exaggeration which
Professor Kaplan obviously can
not resist.
Professor Kaplan concludes
his scolding letter by urging the

Editor to reread The Daily story
in order to acquire a sympathetic
understanding of the careless
ness of the University adminis
trators in responding to the sub
poena. As I have already indi
cated, Professor Kaplan's case
against The Daily story rests on
'an overzealous advocacy and
ignores the breezines.<= of his

animadversions during our dis
cussion—which he now seeks rc
troactively to temper. In any
event, there is a world of dif
ference between the publication
of a story and the compliance
with a subpoena. Just how many
subpoenas are served on the Uni
versity administration eve r v
day? FRANK J. DONNER
