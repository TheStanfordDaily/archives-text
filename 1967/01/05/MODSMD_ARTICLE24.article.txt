## Fire Department Regulations Make Hot Reading 
### Steve Gruber 
"Members shall not discuss re
ligion or politics in the Fire Sta
tion."
This statement is part of Fire
Department policy as quoted
from page 16 of the Rules and
University Fire Department.
This is a remarkable 38 page
document; remarkable in that it
is allowed to exist.
Every member of the Fire De
partment, whether a regular or
student fireman, starts off his
work there by receiving a copy
of the Rules and Regulations.
That is, after he has taken a
loyalty oath.
Top Secret
As he thumbs through his
copy of the Rules and Regula
tions he finds that he cannot tell
anyone about them. This state
ment appears on page 19, "Every
member and officer shall be sub
ject to the following: Section 12.
Furnish persons not connected
with the Department any infor
mation relative to the Depart
ment's business, except that
authorized by Rules and Regu
lations or by the Chief."
(It should be explained here
that the only way that The Daily
got a copy of the Rules and
Regulations was through a stu
dent fireman who quit last year.
He allowed us to Xerox the doc
ument which he was later forced
to turn in when he quit.)
In fact, this part of the Rules
and Regulations also convenient
ly takes care of the Fire Depart
ment's public relations problems.
Since no one may talk about
Department business, such as
fires, then curious outsiders
must always remain in the dark
when dealing with these people.
'No Fires Today'
Last October when I covered a
brush fire for The Daily, I saw

that Stanford had four trucks
fighting the blaze. I called the
Fire Department later that night
only to learn that "No fires have
been reported today and no
trucks have left the station."
According to one student fire
man, all personnel are instructed
to lie to any people who call the
station about fires. "It doesn't

matter whether nothing happen
ed on that day or the Quad
burned down," he said, "We're
supposed to tell everyone that
'All is quiet.' " He went on to say
that there was one officer, be
sides the chief, who was au
thorized to talk to outsiders, but
that he could rarely be located.
Incidently, when I contacted

the Palo Alto Fire Department
about the same brush fire, they
gave me more than enough in
formation.
Some cities have had trouble
with municipal employees or
ganizing unions and going out
on strikes, but rest assured that
Stanford will never have this
problem. Section 11 on page 16

states, "Members and employees
of the Department should not af
filiate themselves with any or
ganization or body that might
in any way prevent the proper
and efficient functioning of the
Department. It is the responsi
bility of each and every member
of the Department to inform the
Chief promptly of any attempt

to organize any such bodies with
in the Department."
Well, suppose that you have
a few complaints about the way
the Fire Department is run?
Better forget them or get an
other job according to section 15
on page 17: "No member of the
Department should discuss his
complaint or grievance with any

other members of the Depart
ment or with the public."
Criticism Prohibited
Or, if you didn't get the idea
the first time, section 16 says
"No member should publicly
criticize the Department, hi s
Superior Officers or his fellow
members." Page 20 states that
criticism of a Superior Officer

will result in 30 days suspension
for the first offense and dismis
sal for the second offense.
According to Section 15 of the
General Orders, no member or
Officer shall "belong to any or
ganization, association or society
which in any manner subordi
nates their loyalty to the Univer
sity, . . Could this be inter
preted to mean that a student
fireman may not be ASSU presi
dent or work for The Stanford
Daily? The penalty for this of
fense is suspension.
The real winner is on page 30
in the paragraph on uniforms,
which reads in part, "Hands
must be kept out of the pock
ets."
It is obvious that Stanford
needs a Fire Department, but
does it need a totalitarian Fire
Department?
