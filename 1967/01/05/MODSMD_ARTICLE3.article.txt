# SDS Vetoes Draft Strike
## 
### MABSHALL KYGER 
The Students for a Democratic
Society announced several policy
changes and rejected a proposal for
a nationwide student strike against
the draft during a convention held
at Berkeley.
Ron Nigh, president of the Stan
ford chapter of SDS, stated that
three new policies had been adopted
at the convention. First, the SDS now
encourages its local chapters to or
ganize its members into draft unions,
the purpose of which would be to re
sist the draft. The members of these
unions would be pledged not to serve
in the military.
Canada
Secondly, the SDS revised its policy
abuot helping men get into Canada in
order to avoid the draft. While it will
not encourage leaving the country to
escape the draft, the SDS will still
distribute information explaining
methods of avoiding the draft by go
ing to Canada.
The third idea adopted by the con
vention was to circulate a petition
throughout the nation. The people
signing the petition would pledge not
to serve in Vietnam in the event that
they entered military service either by
induction or enlistment.

Nigh also explained why SDS's plan
for a nationwide student strike against
the draft was abandoned. The student
leaders present at the convention felt
that they had insufficient support from
students on campus to make the strike
effective. They felt that most students
would not actively participate in such
a strike since most students have not
firmly made up their minds about the
legality of the U.S. war in Vietnam.
However, they did feel that a majority
of students would participate in de
bate and discussion on the war, and in
signing the petitions that will be cir

culated on college campuses over the
nation.
No Reform
Nigh also stated that the SDS will
oppose any attempts to reform the
draft because a reform would not
solve the essential problems involved
with the Selective Service.
The convention was held at the
Berkeley campus of the University of
California starting on the 27th of
December. Nigh pointed out that al
though the five day meeting was tech
nically illegal because it is illegal to
organize resistance to the draft, no
legal repercussions are expected.
