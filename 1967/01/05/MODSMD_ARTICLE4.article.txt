# Teller And Libby To Lecture
## 
### 
Lectures by famed physicist Edward
Teller of UC-Berkeley and Nobel Laur
eate Willard Libby of UCLA will high
light Stanford's 1967 course in Nuclear
Civil Engineering.
Prof. Teller, often called the "father
of the H-bomb", will present "An In
troduction to Project Plowshare", the
U.S. Atomic Energy Commission's ex
perimental program to put nuclear
explosives to work for peaceful pur
poses.
Commenting on the potential con
structive uses of nuclear energy, Prof.
Paul Kruger of Stanford, director of
the new course, said, "The general
public considers nuclear explosives
primarily as weapons of destruction
and radioactive holocaust. Their use
for the benefit of mankind in civil ap
plications is being developed only
slowly and with great caution.
"Although, as of this date, no civil
or industrial applications have been
yet achieved, the results of the Plow
share Program have indicated that
this technology is sufficiently promis
ing to merit its introduction into the

curriculum of civil engineering grad
uate students."
In the concluding lecture of the
series Prof. Libby, a former AEC com
missioner, will discuss "The Future of
Nuclear Civil Engineering."
Both Libby and Teller were guest
lecturers when the new course was
given for the first time at Stanford a
year ago. In addition, the course will
also feature other specialists from
Cal's Lawrence Radiation Laboratory,
the Army Corps of Engineers and
other institutions as well as Stanford
experts.
Last year's course attracted 42 reg
istered students along with many
faculty and student auditors. Many of
the lecturers covered experiences from
the latest efforts of the speakers.
"A 330-page syllabus of the lectures
given in last year's course has been
published and is available to other uni
versities interested in establishing
courses in nuclear civil engineering,"
Prof. Kruger also said. Prof. Kruger
also acknowledged the support of the
AEC for the course, which will be
given in January through mid-March.
