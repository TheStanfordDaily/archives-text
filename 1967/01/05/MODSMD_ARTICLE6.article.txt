# OFF Seeks Token Delay
## Off! 
### 
Nine members of the Women's Com
mittee for Equal Rights (WCER)—
an ad hoc group pushing "OFF" —
circulated some 7000 leaflets in regis
tration lines yesterday, asking wom
en students to withhold payment of
room and board bills for at least
ten days.
Led by junior history major, Judy
Ancel, the group "stopped every girl
who came by and many of the men."
WCER members had no way of
knowing immediately how successful
the move was, since many students
put off paying their room and board
as a matter of course and certain
scholarship have their bills
paid for them automaticalhwk
"This is no longer a strike boy
cott," Miss Ancel added, "just a delay
to keep the issue of equality in hous
ing before the University community."
Students can avoid paying their
room and board bills for ten days
without incurring late fees of $5.00.
Stanford Registrar, Dr. Harvey Hall,
told The Daily last night that 10,308
students had registered—off 147 from
winter quarter last year. He expects
the total to reach 11,000-plus when all
figures are in. Hall blamed the tardy
registrations on the mid-week sign
up date.
Tuesday night, WCER held a lightly
attanded organizational meeting in
Geology Corner during which the
group's goals were re-defined. Princi
pal speaker, "OFF" leader Janet
Howell .hoped that the ten day "rent
delay" would allow time for in-depth
discussions of the housing issue.

In events related to the "rent delay";
Daily sources indicated that certain
members of the Grove Project—a co
ed living experiment housed in Phi
Delta Theta fraternity house—had
been advised not to participate in the
"OFF" protest by faculty resident
Mark Mancall, assistant professor of
history.
Contacted last night, Mancall said
that he had only advised house mem
brs that "participation in the 'OFF'
protest is not commensurate with par
ticipation in the Grove Project."


OFF members were active at the
Pavilion today as they continued their
campaign for a limited "Rent Strike."
