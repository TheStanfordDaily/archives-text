# IJB Reverses Ruling Of Council On Hours
## 
### 
The Interim Judicial Board (IJB)
has overturned the student Judicial
Council's acquittal of two students
who violated administration open
house policy last spring.
IJB said "the Council erred" when
it found that no conflict of law ex
isted in open house regulations and
failed to refer the case to IJB for
its consideration.
It sentenced both students to write
a "brief essay ... on how he, as Resi
dent Assistant, would meet his full
responsibilities as both a counselor to
students and the subordinate Uni
versity official charged with enforcing
existing University law as it pertains
to Open Houses."
The two students, Charlotte Acker
ley and Mike Couzens, violated the ad
ministration regulations on May 24,
shortly after LASSU passed a more
liberal set of rules. They did not vio
late the new rules.
The two went to Couzen's room in
Stern, legally under the student rules
but violating the administration pol
icy, in an attempt to provoke a test
case of the administration regulations.
Couzens had difficulty in forcing the
Stern officials to report the violation,
but once reported the case was re
ferred to Judicial Council.
The Council ,on October 17, found
the pair innoccnt of any violation of
ASSU law. And while the ASSU and
administration regulations set sub
stantially different hours, the Coun
cil did not consider it a conflict of
law, since it claimed the administra
tion policy was never enforced and
thus did not exist.
Dean of Students H. Donald Win
bigler then appealed the case to the
IJB on the ground that a conflict in
rules did in fact exist and Judicial
Council was required to declare the
conflict and refer the case to IJB.
IJB cited a Supreme Court case and
two others in rejecting the Council's
contention.
Miss Ackerley commented last night
that the sentence seemed fairly le
nient, but that since the case had been
so obviously a test case the decision
was not surprising.
Dean Winbigler said yesterday the
penalty seemed quite reasonable un
der the circumstances.
Asked about criticism of uneven en
forcement of the rules, Winbigler
replied that the "picture of the Resi
dent Assistants is a faulty one, in that
it tries to ascribe to them responsibil
ities that are primarily those of the
entire student body."

IJB was set up in late 1965 to hear
cases appealed from the Judicial Coun
cil or in which the Council had no
jurisdiction, as when the rule vio
lated is an administration and not a
student regulation.
Members of IJB are Joseph T.
Sneed, Law, chairman; Robert A.
Horn, Political Science; William R.
Rambo, Engineering; Lawrence Ryan,

thus did not exist.
Dean of Students H. Donald Win
bigler then appealed the case to the
IJB on the ground that a conflict in
rules did in fact exist and Judicial
Council was required to declare the
conflict and refer the case to IJB.
IJB cited a Supreme Court case and
two others in rejecting the Council's
contention.
Miss Ackerley commented last night
that the sentence seemed fairly le
nient, but that since the case had been
so obviously a test case the decision
was not surprising.
Dean Winbigler said yesterday the
penalty seemed quite reasonable un
der the circumstances.
Asked about criticism of uneven en
forcement of the rules, Winbigler
replied that the "picture of the Resi
dent Assistants is a faulty one, in that
it tries to ascribe to them responsibil
ities that are primarily those of the
entire student body."

IJB was set up in late 1965 to hear
cases appealed from the Judicial Coun
cil or in which the Council had no
jurisdiction, as when the rule vio
lated is an administration and not a
student regulation.
Members of IJB are Joseph T.
Sneed, Law, chairman; Robert A.
Horn, Political Science; William R.
Rambo, Engineering; Lawrence Ryan,

The Interim Judicial Board (IJB)
has overturned the student Judicial
Council's acquittal of two students
who violated administration open
house policy last spring.
IJB said "the Council erred" when
it found that no conflict of law ex
isted in open house regulations and
failed to refer the case to IJB for
its consideration.
It sentenced both students to write
a "brief essay ... on how he, as Resi
dent Assistant, would meet his full
responsibilities as both a counselor to
students and the subordinate Uni
versity official charged with enforcing
existing University law as it pertains
to Open Houses."
The two students, Charlotte Acker
ley and Mike Couzens, violated the ad
ministration regulations on May 24,
shortly after LASSU passed a more
liberal set of rules. They did not vio
late the new rules.
The two went to Couzen's room in
Stern, legally under the student rules
but violating the administration pol
icy, in an attempt to provoke a test
case of the administration regulations.
Couzens had difficulty in forcing the
Stern officials to report the violation,
but once reported the case was re
ferred to Judicial Council.
The Council ,on October 17, found
the pair innoccnt of any violation of
ASSU law. And while the ASSU and
administration regulations set sub
stantially different hours, the Coun
cil did not consider it a conflict of
law, since it claimed the administra
tion policy was never enforced and
thus did not exist.
