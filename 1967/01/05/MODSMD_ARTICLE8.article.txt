# Information From Moscow On China Worse Than Ours'
## 
### HENRY MULLER News Editor 
An Englishman who has lived in
China for over twenty years pointed
out yesterday that the Soviet Union
presents even more misleading in
formation about China that the United
States does.
David Crook, speaking before an
overflow audience yesterday after
noon, was explaining how difficult it
was for Westerners to understand
what is going on in China because
of the difference "in standards of be
havior, in the moral code, and in the
philosophy of life of the two civiliza
tions."
The United States, he said, is trying
to insure that there will be a mini
mum of sympathy for China in this
country. Crook in addition, however,
cited an example of a news release
from the Soviet News Agency Tass
which showed that the Soviet govern
ment was providing the world with
"even worse nonsense" about China.
Much of Crook's lecture was de
voted to an explanation of the "Cul
tural Revolution" presently taking
place in China. He said that it was
cultural in a very broad sense and
that it actually deals primarily with
"the whole field of ideology."
Different Thinking
He said that, basically, it was an at
tempt at getting the Chinese people
to adopt a different mode of thinking.
"They are trying to get people to
think, not in terms of themselves, but
instead in terms of serving all the peo
ple."
As an example, he pointed out that
in many cases youths no longer take
up the occupation of their choice after
completing school, but instead make

themselves available to "serve the peo
ple" in whatever way is best.
In this connection, Crook clarified
the nature of the Red Guard. He
mentioned that the Red Guard was
being led by the Chinese Communist
Party, but emphasized that they were
not "juvenile delinquents," as is often
implied in this country. He compared
them to a task force and insisted that
they are not carrying the Cultural
Revolution out through violent meth
ods.
Violent Methods
"It is not that the Chinese do not
believe in violent methods anymore,"
he said, "but the very nature of the
Cultural Revolution does not call for
violence precisely because it is think
ing that is being revolutionized."
Crook said that this revolution in
thought was the phase in the develop
ment of the Chinese Communist state
which directly follows the revolution
in economic policy. According to
Crook, the Cultural Revolution was
not begun earlier because it was nec
essary to develop a strong economy
first.
"Even the most conservative West
ern businessman will agree that the
economy in China is flourishing," he
pointed out. "The Chinese people are
living better today that they ever
have bfore."
The objectives of the Cultural Rev
olution, according to Crook, are based
on what has happened in the Soviet
Union. The Chinese, he says, are try
ing to prevent the development of a
bureaucracy similar to the one which
presently exists in the USSR. This has
been one of the principal aims of
Chinese policy since the establishment
of the Communist People's Republic
in 1949, he noted.

not "juvenile delinquents," as is often
implied in this country. He compared
them to a task force and insisted that
they are not carrying the Cultural
Revolution out through violent meth
ods.
Violent Methods
"It is not that the Chinese do not
believe in violent methods anymore,"
he said, "but the very nature of the
Cultural Revolution does not call for
violence precisely because it is think
ing that is being revolutionized."
Crook said that this revolution in
thought was the phase in the develop
ment of the Chinese Communist state
which directly follows the revolution
in economic policy. According to
Crook, the Cultural Revolution was
not begun earlier because it was nec
essary to develop a strong economy
first.
"Even the most conservative West
ern businessman will agree that the
economy in China is flourishing," he
pointed out. "The Chinese people are
living better today that they ever
have bfore."
The objectives of the Cultural Rev
olution, according to Crook, are based
on what has happened in the Soviet
Union. The Chinese, he says, are try
ing to prevent the development of a
bureaucracy similar to the one which
presently exists in the USSR. This has
been one of the principal aims of
Chinese policy since the establishment
of the Communist People's Republic
in 1949, he noted.
An Englishman who has lived in
China for over twenty years pointed
out yesterday that the Soviet Union
presents even more misleading in
formation about China that the United
States does.
David Crook, speaking before an
overflow audience yesterday after
noon, was explaining how difficult it
was for Westerners to understand
what is going on in China because
of the difference "in standards of be
havior, in the moral code, and in the
philosophy of life of the two civiliza
tions."
The United States, he said, is trying
to insure that there will be a mini
mum of sympathy for China in this
country. Crook in addition, however,
cited an example of a news release
from the Soviet News Agency Tass
which showed that the Soviet govern
ment was providing the world with
"even worse nonsense" about China.
Much of Crook's lecture was de
voted to an explanation of the "Cul
tural Revolution" presently taking
place in China. He said that it was
cultural in a very broad sense and
that it actually deals primarily with
"the whole field of ideology."
Different Thinking
He said that, basically, it was an at
tempt at getting the Chinese people
to adopt a different mode of thinking.
"They are trying to get people to
think, not in terms of themselves, but
instead in terms of serving all the peo
ple."
As an example, he pointed out that
in many cases youths no longer take
up the occupation of their choice after
completing school, but instead make

themselves available to "serve the peo
ple" in whatever way is best.
In this connection, Crook clarified
the nature of the Red Guard. He
mentioned that the Red Guard was
being led by the Chinese Communist
Party, but emphasized that they were
not "juvenile delinquents," as is often
implied in this country. He compared
them to a task force and insisted that
they are not carrying the Cultural
Revolution out through violent meth
ods.
