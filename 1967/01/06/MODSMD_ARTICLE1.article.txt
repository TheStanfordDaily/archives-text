# Saigon Relaxed Despite Intrigue, Violence
## 
### HOWARD MOFFETT The Collegiate Press Service (Part One) 
SAIGON (CPS) — Saigon is probably the
world's most relaxed center of intrigue, vio
lence and war. It doesn't seem like a city under
siege.
Sloe-eyed will-o'-wisp girls dressed in soft
slit ao dai's and spiked heels walk narrow
(boulevards overhung with green elms or
tropical palms.
In the market old men squat on the curb
over a game of Chinese chess. Their women
are nearby, chewing betel nut, grinning and
spitting the juice through red-stained teeth.

pean girls lounge In bikinis beside the pool,
while wealthy white-clad warriors shoot tennis

balls at each other on beautifully groomed
courts.
In low-slung French colonial office buildings,
civil servants who have kept papers moving
for nine governments in three years go on
stamping and filing, conversing in French on
difficult bureaucratic questions, and drinking
tea.
The university opens a month late, and even
then no ones seems to know the exact date
until one day classes break out.
Young women and middle-aged men wear
silk or cotton pajamas much of the day. It does
save time, because from 12 to 3 in the after
noon the city shuts down and people sleep.
Newcomers are often baffled by the casual
air that hangs over much of Saigon. "I thought
there was a war going on here," one five-day
veteran said recently.
Saigon is hot and muggy. It is also a place

where war is no longer an emergency condi
tion but the normal state of things. A cer
tain percentage of the population has been
engaged in killing as a profession for many
years, and the tendency has been to turn it
into a nine-to-five job. A nine-to-five job loses
its excitement after a while.
Though it doesn't move very fast, Saigon
is one of the world's busiest and most crowded
urban areas. There are two and a half million
people living here now, one-sixth of the popula
tion of South Vietnam. The city was built for
about half that number: it has doubled in the
last five years.
The Marketplace
Saigon wakes early. Curfew ends at 4 a.m.
and the ten great markets of the capital
open for business. A stream of peasants brings
chickens, pigs, rice, vegetables and fruit into
town. By noon all the food has been bought,

the central market is deserted, and rats the
size of kittens scuttle along the cement gutters
gnawing on vegetable husks and other refuse.
By seven in the morning main arteries are
choked with battered little blue-and-yellow
Renault taxis, pedicabs, motorpedicabs, bi
cycles, three-wheeled motor buses, regular
buses, motor scooters, jeeps, trucks, American
sedans, horse-drawn carts, motorcycles and
swarms of pedestrians.
The stalls of the "common man's PX" have
been set up downtown. Army ponchos are
spread on sidewalks and vendors hawk every
thing from French toothpaste to American
whiskey and C-rations. Mothers nurse their
babies as they sit cross-legged in the sun, teen
agers hold out sunglasses or cigarette lighters,
tiny little girls grab your hand and stuff a bag
of peanuts into it, and everybody asks, "You
buy? Cheap, cheap."

Everywhere people are building — hotels,
apartments, offices, private homes. Saigon's
first department store is gong up on Tu Do
Street. Off a back alley near a sewer-canal,
truckloads of rubble fill in a plot of swamp, and
two weeks later workers are finishing the sec
ond story of a new house. Bricks are thrown
up one by one to a middle man who stacks
them while a third lays them in with cheap
mortar.
In the harbor, port congestion ties up tons
of imports for months, while a few hundred
yards away prices soar as speculators hoard
the goods that do get through, legally or not.
American Gl's in olive drab fatigues hang
from telephone poles, trying to booster the
city's sagging and overworked telephone sys
tems.

SAIGON (CPS) — Saigon is probably the
world's most relaxed center of intrigue, vio
lence and war. It doesn't seem like a city under
siege.
Sloe-eyed will-o'-wisp girls dressed in soft
slit ao dai's and spiked heels walk narrow
(boulevards overhung with green elms or

In the market old men squat on the curb
over a game of Chinese chess. Their women
are nearby, chewing betel nut, grinning and
spitting the juice through red-stained teeth.

In low-slung French colonial office buildings,
civil servants who have kept papers moving
for nine governments in three years go on
stamping and filing, conversing in French on
difficult bureaucratic questions, and drinking
tea.
The university opens a month late, and even
then no ones seems to know the exact date
until one day classes break out.
Young women and middle-aged men wear
silk or cotton pajamas much of the day. It does
save time, because from 12 to 3 in the after
noon the city shuts down and people sleep.
Newcomers are often baffled by the casual
air that hangs over much of Saigon. "I thought
there was a war going on here," one five-day
veteran said recently.
Saigon is hot and muggy. It is also a place

where war is no longer an emergency condi
tion but the normal state of things. A cer
tain percentage of the population has been
engaged in killing as a profession for many
years, and the tendency has been to turn it
into a nine-to-five job. A nine-to-five job loses
its excitement after a while.
Though it doesn't move very fast, Saigon
is one of the world's busiest and most crowded
urban areas. There are two and a half million
people living here now, one-sixth of the popula
tion of South Vietnam. The city was built for
about half that number: it has doubled in the
last five years.
The Marketplace
Saigon wakes early. Curfew ends at 4 a.m.
and the ten great markets of the capital
open for business. A stream of peasants brings
chickens, pigs, rice, vegetables and fruit into
town. By noon all the food has been bought,

the central market is deserted, and rats the
size of kittens scuttle along the cement gutters
gnawing on vegetable husks and other refuse.
By seven in the morning main arteries are
choked with battered little blue-and-yellow
Renault taxis, pedicabs, motorpedicabs, bi
cycles, three-wheeled motor buses, regular
buses, motor scooters, jeeps, trucks, American
sedans, horse-drawn carts, motorcycles and
swarms of pedestrians.
The stalls of the "common man's PX" have
been set up downtown. Army ponchos are
spread on sidewalks and vendors hawk every
thing from French toothpaste to American
whiskey and C-rations. Mothers nurse their
babies as they sit cross-legged in the sun, teen
agers hold out sunglasses or cigarette lighters,
tiny little girls grab your hand and stuff a bag
of peanuts into it, and everybody asks, "You
buy? Cheap, cheap."

Everywhere people are building — hotels,
apartments, offices, private homes. Saigon's
first department store is gong up on Tu Do
Street. Off a back alley near a sewer-canal,

Renault taxis, pedicabs, motorpedicabs, bi
cycles, three-wheeled motor buses, regular
buses, motor scooters, jeeps, trucks, American
sedans, horse-drawn carts, motorcycles and
swarms of pedestrians.
The stalls of the "common man's PX" have
been set up downtown. Army ponchos are
spread on sidewalks and vendors hawk every
thing from French toothpaste to American
whiskey and C-rations. Mothers nurse their
babies as they sit cross-legged in the sun, teen
agers hold out sunglasses or cigarette lighters,
tiny little girls grab your hand and stuff a bag
of peanuts into it, and everybody asks, "You
buy? Cheap, cheap."

Everywhere people are building — hotels,
apartments, offices, private homes. Saigon's
first department store is gong up on Tu Do
Street. Off a back alley near a sewer-canal,
truckloads of rubble fill in a plot of swamp, and
two weeks later workers are finishing the sec
ond story of a new house. Bricks are thrown
up one by one to a middle man who stacks
them while a third lays them in with cheap
mortar.
In the harbor, port congestion ties up tons
of imports for months, while a few hundred
yards away prices soar as speculators hoard
the goods that do get through, legally or not.
American Gl's in olive drab fatigues hang
from telephone poles, trying to booster the
city's sagging and overworked telephone sys
tems.
