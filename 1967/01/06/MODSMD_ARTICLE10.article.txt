# Music Department Gets Endowment; Performance Study Center Planned
## 
### 
The Stanford music program
will receive the larger share of
more than $2 million in endow
ment gifts from the Alvah
Beach Thompson family. A part
of the income will also be used
to support general undergradu
ate schoolarships.
Dean Robert R. Sears of the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences said that the Music De
partment, aided by this bequest,
is planning a center for musical
performance studies and exam
ining prospects of improving its
housing situation.
The plans include a larger fac
ulty and more visiting artists,
scholars, and composers in resi
dence to work with students.
Guest Program
Included in the guest faculty
program will be Marius Con
stant, French composer, in resi
dence this spring, and 11 mem
bers of the New York Pro
Musica Antiqua who will visit

throughout the spring quarter
and the summer Renaissance In
stitute.
Dr. William L. Crosten, De
partment Chairman, announced
the plan of the Department to
initiate studies in the special
performance problems of con
temporary music and the use of
computers in musical composi
tion.
Dean Sears described the De
partment's present dispersal in
four locations; a former presi
dential residence, a ballroom, a
garage, and Dinkelspiel Audi
torium, but did not discuss the
future location of the depart
ment.
Enrollment High
More than 1000 students now
enrolled under the program are
using these facilities. The De
partment includes 70 graduate
and 40 undergraduate students
majoring in music and 23 full
and part-time faculty members
including 10 vocal and instru
mental specialists.
A gift of $250 in 1931 from
Agusta Beach Tohmpson, widow
of Stanford graduate and min
ing engineer, Alvah Beach
Thompson, started the endow
ment fund. Subsequent gifts
were made, including one of
$50,000 in 1943 on the death of
Mrs. Thompson.
Following the death of Miss
Barbara Breach Thompson, and
the termination of a life income
trust Mrs. Thompson had estab
lished for her daughter, Stan
ford received the major part
of the fund in assets valued at
$1,585,000. Miss Thompson, a
well-known social service leader
and golfer, died in 1964, leaving
an additional $378,000 which
Stanford accepted last June as
the final Beach bequest.
