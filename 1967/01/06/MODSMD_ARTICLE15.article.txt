The Stanford Repertory Theatre's upcoming production of John
Gay's BEGGAR'S OPERA will play three consecutive Wednesday
through-Saturday stints beginning week after next. Tickets will go
on sale soon at Memorial Auditorium.
The National Repertory Theatre opened an engagement to play
through January 23 at the Curran Theatre, S.F. The company's
opening play will be Moliere's comedy THE IMAGINARY IN
VALID, a satire of the healthy invalid who enjoys every
illness. The second play is Eugene O'Neill's A TOUCH OF THE
POET. O'Neill's last play, and heretofore never on tour, Poet
shows the founding of the "family" in New England in 1828 by an
Irish gentleman, his adoring wife and their rebellious daughter.
The last production in NRT's triadic repertory is a trio of one-act
plays by Noel Coward, WAYS AND MEANS, STILL LIFE, AND
FUMED OAK. All the plays will be interspersed throughout the
next two and a half weeks. Tickets are on sale at the Curran
Theatre box office.

in Los Alamos, New Mexico, invites authors to submit unproduced
plays for a PL A YWRITIN G COMPETITION. The play selected
will be produced at the Don Juan Playhouse during the summer of
1967 as a part of the celebration of its tenth season, and the author
will be awarded the grand prize of $500.
Do nuclear scientists have souls? This is the question posed in
the PR bumpf on Friedrich Durrenmatt's sardonic tragicomedy,
THE PHYSICISTS, which opens tonight at the Playhouse Theatre,
Beach and Hyde Streets, S.F. In an era of technological triumph
over the forces of nature, a new hero is born: the physicist. His
genius is the key to inconceivable power; but he is caught in the
dilemma of whether or not to entrust his knowledge to a self
destructive humanity.
.San Francisco actor Jack Aranson, back from the Dublin Theatre
Festival, reopened his City Theatre, at 465 Post Street, S.F., by
re-creating his image of the Welsh Poet in THE WORLD OF
DYLAN THOMAS, which earned him a flock of rave reviews at the
Festival.
The student directors of San Joie State College Drama Depart
ment will open production of the three short plays WINDOWS by
Murray Schisgal, Albee's THE DEATH OF BESSIE SMITH, and
Chekhov's THE WEDDING, next Thursday through Sunday in the
College Theater, San Jose.
The ILLEGITIMATE THEATRE at the Tangent in Palo Alto
continues to present its improvised satires that slash, chip, rip,
split, those cherished icons of our political social, and bedroom
sanctimony. Amen. Every Friday and Saturday night.
FILMS
Jason Robards, festooned with the well deserved garlands from
his last picture "Thousand Clowns," returns to the area, escorting
Jane Fonda in ANY WEDNESDAY. Also on the Park docket is
BLINDFOLD, starring Claudia Cardinale and Rock Hudson. The
flick is supposedly a mystery, and good ol' Rock tries to hoodwink
the audience into thinking that the butler did it. But we all know,
don't weâ€”or do we. With good ol' Rock at the helm, you'll be just
what movie's title implies . . . for at least a little bit of picture . .
The Guild Theater has Woody Allen's new comedy, WHATS UP
TIGER LILY? Playing with "Tiger" is ZULU. This is the nascent
film for Michael Caine's rocketing popularity. In it, Caine plays a
90-day-wonder lieutenant (pronounced: left-tenant) in Britain's
famed overseas fighting forces. Caine and his compatriots, which
number few more than fifty, are surrounded by 60 thousand
whooping Zulus. Never in filmdom has one movie produce so
much carnage with so few bullets, in so little time ... a lesson in
genocide.
LIFE UPSIDE DOWN (La Vie L'Envers), Alain Jesua's ac
claimed first film, will be shown at the Surf Theater, Irving at 46th
Ave. in S.F., January 8 through 21, as a part of the Cinema Fran
cais Series. The companion feature January 8 through 14 will be
LAST YEAR AT MARIENBAD and January 15 through 21, Cabrol's
WEB OF PASSION with Jean-Paul Belmondo. Winner of special
jury prizes at the Cannes and Venice Film Festivals of 1964, "Life
Upside Down" is a study of a man's withdrawal from society. In
discovering the endless pleasures of contemplative solitude, the
hero ends up in an asylum, but the image is one of triumph.
What's next? I'll tell you what's next . . . it's AFTER THE FOX
with Peter Sellers in front of the hounds and after some of the
juiciest, most palpable foxes that ever lost their tails for a trophy.
You'll drool, your tongue will wag before your eyes, and no doubt
you too will wonder why Oscar Wilde ever said "the unspeakable
in full pursuit of the uneatable."
OTHER
Jacob Krachmalnick (pronounced Kratch-mal-nick) and his $45,000
violin will join the SAN FRANCISCO SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA
week after next in the West Coast premiere of Sheinfeld's Violin
Concerto.
y The TRIDENT in Sausalito, after being closed for the holidays,
has opened its 1967 season with Bola Sete's New Brazilian Trio.
Bola Sete will play nightly, except Mondays when the DENNY
ZEITLIN TRIO is featured.
Folk singer-guitarist STAN WILSON will extend his engagement
at The Fourth Dimension through next Friday. Wilson has been a
Bay Area favorite since 1952, when he was the first entertainment
ever to be presented at the hungry i. Since then he has done many
concerts and has been booked into top rooms across the country and
Hawaii. He is most often referred to as "the versatile Stan Wilson,"
as he offers a well-varied package of folk standards, calypso, western
and jazz numbers combined with a rich, full voice and an effective
projection of honest enthusiasm for his songs. A new night club,
The Fourth Dimension, at 1335 Grant Avenue, offers a special menu
of exotic liqueur-based coffee drinks. Starting January 11, a "Chicken
in the Rough" will be served every Wednesday night.
