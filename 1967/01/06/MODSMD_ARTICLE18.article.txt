# Reagan: Students Must Behave

### 
SACRAMENTO (AP) — In a
presidential-style inaugural spec
tacle unmatched in 116 years of
statehood, Gov. Ronald Reagan
yesterday promised California
economy-minded leadership
based on traditional American
values.
The state's 33rd Governor, and
its first Republican chief execu
tive in eight years, drew his
strongest response from a crowd
of thousands when he pledged
tough action on basic issues—
economy in government, crime
in the streets, welfare and or
derly conduct by citizens.
The 55-year-old political neo
phyte who rose to a political pin
nacle in his first bid at office told
college students they must be
have; professors that they must
build character; parents that he
will help protect their children
from the perils of smut; and
everyone that they have an ob

ligation to help govern.
Police estimated the crowd that
watched Reagan and his wife
in a 40-minute parade through
downtown streets and at the
Capital at from 15,000 to 20,000.
However, the only ones who
could see him at the Capitol
were those gathered on each side
of the speaker's platform. He
spoke facing directly into a big
television platform that blocked
his view of those behind it, and
their's of him.
Never before had there been
such an inaugural speech cere
mony—but Reagan's movie and
television background and his
staff's desire for the most im
pressive yet dignified show pos
sible added up to a small-scale
presidential style inauguration.
Reagan was officially sworn in
during a private ceremony Mon
day.
Security was strict. Windows

of news offices above the west
capitol steps were hammered
shut.
Blinds were ordered drawn so
it would look good on television,
inaugural aides explained. Four
armed policemen stood atop the
Capital roof, two of them scan
ning the crowd with binoculars.
