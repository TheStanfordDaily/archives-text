units tonight authorized strikes
against the city's public schools
and Junior Colleges.
The junior college strike was
scheduled for midnight.
The strike of teachers at ele
mentary and high schools was
set for Monday morning.
Norman G. Swenson, Presi
dent of Local 1600, Cook County
College Teachers Union, called a
strike of 500 junior college
teachers after a 4 1/2-hour nego

tiating session with the Junior
College Board resulted in a
stalemate.
A strike at the eight city jun
ior college campuses would af
fect 36,000 students. Swenson
estimated that at least 150 non
union teachers would join the
strike, leaving 34 of the sys
tem's 684 teachers on duty.
Swenson said the College
Board offered to levy a quarter
cent of additional taxes to raise
salaries.
