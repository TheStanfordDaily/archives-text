# Poll Shows Women Want Off Campus Living
## Majority Favors Apartments 
### CHRISTOPHER HARGROVE 
A new survey of undergraduate
women has revealed that an over
whelming majority wants the option
to live off campus. At the same time,
a majority also expressed satisfaction
with their present living arrange
ments.
The results of the survey were re
leased yesterday by the Dean of Stu
dents Office, which administered it
last quarter to about three fourths
of the university's 1752 undergraduate
women.
The survey reflected a wide range
of opinion on present women's hous
ing and regulations, both positive and
negative.
Associate Dean of Students Robert
Gordon and Assistant Dean Shirley
Bushnell expressed no surprise at
the outcome of the survey. Both ex
pressed the opinion that the poll's
main effects would be on the long
range planning of the administration.

No immediate changes in university
housing policy are expected.
Numerical Vote
The summary of the polls findings
released yesterday, according to Dean
Gordon, contained only those re
sponses that could be computed nu
merically. The poll also contained
open-ended essay questions, the an
swers to which have not yet been
studied.
Janet Howell, chairman of the OFF
Committee, told The Dally, "It's pretty
much what we expected. ... I hope
the results of the survey will be
heeded as a basis for changing the
rules." ASSU President David Harris
commented that, although the results
of the survey were gratifying to him,
he thought women who want to live
off campus should make their de
mands in stronger terms.
The findings have been given to
President Sterling, who is expected
to report them to the Board of Trus
tees. Sterling's administrative assis
tant, Frederick Glover, could not be
reached for comment.
Statistical Report
About three per cent of those ques
tioned in the survey expressed support
for the university's present policy of
letting only undergraduate women
over the age of 23 to live off campus.
An additional five per cent favored
lowering this age limit to 21. Fourteen
per cent would allow the option to
seniors and all women over 21; 31
per cent would allow it to all juniors,
seniors, and women over 21; 40 per
cent would allow it to all upperclass
women regardless of age; and 5 per
cent would allow it to all undegradu
ate women.
Less than one per cent of those
questioned, however, said that they
would want to live off campus their
freshman year. The figure rose to 11
per cent for sophomore year, 32 per
cent for junior year and 53 per cent
for senior year.
Asked about on-campus housing al
ternatives, 74 per cent felt that stu
dent cooperatives were desirable, 67

per cent approved co-ed residences,
and 91 per cent approved on-campus
apartments such as Hoskins House.
Only 12 per cent favored sororities.
like Apartments
When asked to choose among al
ternatives, most upper class women
chose apartments. Most freshmen
favored row houses.
The factors which would make for
an ideal living situation were con
sidered. In order of preference, they
were: the people with whom you
are living, financial economy, and
physical proximity to classrooms,
libraries, and campus events. Those
thought least important were maid
service, participation in residence
centered activities, and the availability
of professional counseling and health
service personnel.
Of the University's stated goals for
on-campus living, those thought most
important by those questioned were
an intellectual atmosphere conducive
to high scholastic interest and
achievement, and the opportunity for
each student to choose the group
with which he or she will associate
within the limitations of practical
necessities.
Coed Residence
The women were also asked if,
assuming they decided to live on
campus, would they prefer co-ed
residence to an all-girls house. Over
44 per cent said yes, 24 per cent said
no, and 30 per cent were undecided.
The survey was undertaken by the
Dean of Students office in coopera
tion with several students. The plans
for it were begun before fall quarter
started.
Support for the OFF movement has
been expressed in a resolution of the
student legislature, in a petition
signed by more than half of the
undergraduate women, and in a cam
pus referendum.
The issue will be taken up Monday
by the Committee of 15. What immed
iate action will be taken on the sur
vey is not definite.
