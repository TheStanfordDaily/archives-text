the choppy headwaters of the
NCAA when Oregon State visits
the Encina Pool at 3 p.m. this
.afternoon. Saturday at 2 p.m.,
the Oregon Ducks paddle over
the waterfall into the Indians'
hungry hands.
Swimming World rated the
Cards second in the country be

diana are also clustered about
ihe number one spot. Stanford
proved the predictions wrong
last year when the Tribe took
sixth after being picked for
ninth place.

Last year's varsity remains
virtually intact.
Three World Record Holders
World record holders Dick
Roth, Greg Buckingham, and
Luis Nicolao put the biggest
threats on the blocks that Stan
ford has ever known. The fresh
man team that broke five NCAA
freshman records last year has

conditions, took third in the AAU
nationals last spring behind USC
and the UCLA frosh.
Roth set the world record for
400 meters individual medley en
route to an Olympic Gold medal,
and has not lost a race at that
distance since 1963.
Buckingham broke Roth's 200
meter IM record last summer.
He smashed Roy Saari's old 500
freestyle mark by 2 1/2 seconds
in the AAU's last spring, winning
in a national record 4:41.1. He
also holds the national record
for 400 yards IM, 4:08.3—0ne of
the three first places he took in
the 1965 Indoor Nationals.
Luis Flies Fastest
Nicolao's 57.0 for 100 meters

butterfly has not been touched
by any swimmer in the world.
Nicolao will have a shot at the
NCAA records of 50.2 and 1:51.7
for 100 and 200 yards butterfly.
Bob Momsen, a junior, packed
away the silver medal in the 200
breaststroke at the NCAA's last
season. Momsen will be backed
up by Charlie Burbach and Steve
Falus.
Mike Wall, a member of the
1964 Olympic team, took third in
the 1650, fifth in the 500, and
turned in the meet's fastest split
anchoring the 800 free relay at
the NCAA championships last
season. Wall and Buckingham
provide a potent 1-2 punch in
the distance freestyle events.
Meyers Handles Sprints
Bill Meyer, fifth in the NCAA's
with 21.5 in the 50 freestyle, re

turns as the Tribe's big gun in
the sprints.
Team captain Jim Laney, the
only senior on the squad, hit 46.6
for 100 free last season. Morgan
Manning swam at 46.8 leg on a
Papoose relay last year and will
see heavy duty at 100 and 200
freestyle.
Mark Parmely swam on all
three relays at the NCAA's last
year, hitting 47.5 and 1:46.8 in
the high altitude meet. Parmely
should see mostly 200 and 500
freestyle races this year.
Miller Comes On Strong
Doug Miller, third in the
AAWU 200 butterfly as a sopho
more, has had a chance for au
tumn conditioning this season,
and should accompany Nicolao
to the NCAA finals in 1967.
Bill Schubach, last year's back

stroke stalwart, has graduated,
leaving Pete Siebert, Bob Hart,
and Bill Kee to handle the up
side-down chores. From early
season indications, the three
sophomores should fill in the
gap.
The Tribe also lost conference
champion diver Bill Freeman.
Bill Kennedy and Dave Duxbury
will be doing the board work for
the Indians.
Freestylers Add Depth
Jeff Hammett, Tom Jamison,
Bill Derrig, and Jack Collins give
the Cards great depth in the
sprint and middle distance free
style events.
Last year, the varsity broke 11
of the 16 Stanford records. Not
a single one should survive be
yond the AAWU championships
this year.

Stanford's dual meet sched
ule, lighter than usual to facili
tate training for tho Big One,
has one spectular highlight. USC
and UCLA, who will join Stan
ford among the top 4 in the coun
try this year, crash head-on into
the Indians in one weekend, Feb
ruary 17-18.
Some 15 probable members of
the next Olympic team will test
the Encina Pool in a national
collegiate preview.
Beavers Can't Bite
Oregon State should pose no
problems whatsoever for the
swimming Indians today. Stan
ford coach Jim Gaughran will
enter an experimental lineup,
probably with each man swim
ming only once.
Oregon's only big throat comes
in the person of junior Bob
Boyer. Late in December, Boyer
hit a 21.8 50 and a 49.0 100
Frosh Squad Lacks Depth
Papooses swimmers open their
season January 27 against Cal,
and will need every minute of
the next three weks to prepare
for the season. The frosh have
a number of bright spots, but
severely lack depth.
High school Ail-Americans Jim
Nickoloff (100 fly) and Richie
Williams (200 free/200 IM/100
fly) top the list of freshman
aqualetes.
Bill Main, CIF diving champion
from Palo Alto, promises to
stand well above the rest of the

West Coast's divers. Main is also
an Ail-American 50 freestyler.
Nick Dondero, of Las Vegas,
could significantly bolster thf
Tribe's breaststroking future.
The Papooses need a back
stroker and depth in a large
number of events.

the 1965 Indoor Nationals.
Luis Flies Fastest
Nicolao's 57.0 for 100 meters

butterfly has not been touched
by any swimmer in the world.
Nicolao will have a shot at the
NCAA records of 50.2 and 1:51.7
for 100 and 200 yards butterfly.
Bob Momsen, a junior, packed
away the silver medal in the 200
breaststroke at the NCAA's last
season. Momsen will be backed
up by Charlie Burbach and Steve
Falus.
Mike Wall, a member of the
1964 Olympic team, took third in
the 1650, fifth in the 500, and
turned in the meet's fastest split
anchoring the 800 free relay at
the NCAA championships last
season. Wall and Buckingham
provide a potent 1-2 punch in
the distance freestyle events.
Meyers Handles Sprints
Bill Meyer, fifth in the NCAA's
with 21.5 in the 50 freestyle, re

turns as the Tribe's big gun in
the sprints.
Team captain Jim Laney, the
only senior on the squad, hit 46.6
for 100 free last season. Morgan
Manning swam at 46.8 leg on a
Papoose relay last year and will
see heavy duty at 100 and 200
freestyle.
Mark Parmely swam on all
three relays at the NCAA's last
year, hitting 47.5 and 1:46.8 in
the high altitude meet. Parmely
should see mostly 200 and 500
freestyle races this year.
Miller Comes On Strong
Doug Miller, third in the
AAWU 200 butterfly as a sopho
more, has had a chance for au
tumn conditioning this season,
and should accompany Nicolao
to the NCAA finals in 1967.
Bill Schubach, last year's back

stroke stalwart, has graduated,
leaving Pete Siebert, Bob Hart,
and Bill Kee to handle the up
side-down chores. From early
season indications, the three
sophomores should fill in the
gap.
The Tribe also lost conference
champion diver Bill Freeman.
Bill Kennedy and Dave Duxbury
will be doing the board work for
the Indians.
Freestylers Add Depth
Jeff Hammett, Tom Jamison,
Bill Derrig, and Jack Collins give
the Cards great depth in the
sprint and middle distance free
style events.
Last year, the varsity broke 11
of the 16 Stanford records. Not
a single one should survive be
yond the AAWU championships
this year.

Stanford's dual meet sched

Some 15 probable members of
the next Olympic team will test
the Encina Pool in a national
collegiate preview.
Beavers Can't Bite
Oregon State should pose no
problems whatsoever for the

ford coach Jim Gaughran will
enter an experimental lineup,

Oregon's only big throat comes
in the person of junior Bob
Boyer. Late in December, Boyer

Frosh Squad Lacks Depth
Papooses swimmers open their
season January 27 against Cal,
and will need every minute of
the next three weks to prepare
for the season. The frosh have
a number of bright spots, but
severely lack depth.
High school Ail-Americans Jim
Nickoloff (100 fly) and Richie
Williams (200 free/200 IM/100
fly) top the list of freshman
aqualetes.
Bill Main, CIF diving champion
from Palo Alto, promises to
stand well above the rest of the

West Coast's divers. Main is also
an Ail-American 50 freestyler.
Nick Dondero, of Las Vegas,
could significantly bolster thf
Tribe's breaststroking future.
The Papooses need a back
stroker and depth in a large
number of events.
Stanford swimmers take their
first strokes on the long pull to
the choppy headwaters of the
NCAA when Oregon State visits
the Encina Pool at 3 p.m. this
.afternoon. Saturday at 2 p.m.,
the Oregon Ducks paddle over
the waterfall into the Indians'

proved the predictions wrong
last year when the Tribe took

Frosh Squad Lacks Depth
Papooses swimmers open their
season January 27 against Cal,

the next three weks to prepare
for the season. The frosh have
a number of bright spots, but
severely lack depth.
High school Ail-Americans Jim

Williams (200 free/200 IM/100
fly) top the list of freshman
aqualetes.
Bill Main, CIF diving champion
from Palo Alto, promises to
stand well above the rest of the

West Coast's divers. Main is also
an Ail-American 50 freestyler.
Nick Dondero, of Las Vegas,
could significantly bolster thf
Tribe's breaststroking future.
The Papooses need a back
stroker and depth in a large
number of events.
Stanford swimmers take their
first strokes on the long pull to

the Oregon Ducks paddle over

Roth set the world record for
400 meters individual medley en
route to an Olympic Gold medal,
and has not lost a race at that
distance since 1963.
Buckingham broke Roth's 200
meter IM record last summer.
He smashed Roy Saari's old 500
freestyle mark by 2 1/2 seconds
in the AAU's last spring, winning
in a national record 4:41.1. He
also holds the national record
for 400 yards IM, 4:08.3—0ne of
the three first places he took in
the 1965 Indoor Nationals.
Luis Flies Fastest
Nicolao's 57.0 for 100 meters

butterfly has not been touched
by any swimmer in the world.
Nicolao will have a shot at the
NCAA records of 50.2 and 1:51.7
for 100 and 200 yards butterfly.
Bob Momsen, a junior, packed
away the silver medal in the 200
breaststroke at the NCAA's last
season. Momsen will be backed
up by Charlie Burbach and Steve
Falus.
Mike Wall, a member of the
1964 Olympic team, took third in
the 1650, fifth in the 500, and
turned in the meet's fastest split
anchoring the 800 free relay at
the NCAA championships last
season. Wall and Buckingham
provide a potent 1-2 punch in
the distance freestyle events.
Meyers Handles Sprints
Bill Meyer, fifth in the NCAA's
with 21.5 in the 50 freestyle, re

turns as the Tribe's big gun in
the sprints.
Team captain Jim Laney, the
only senior on the squad, hit 46.6
for 100 free last season. Morgan
Manning swam at 46.8 leg on a
Papoose relay last year and will
see heavy duty at 100 and 200
freestyle.
Mark Parmely swam on all
three relays at the NCAA's last
year, hitting 47.5 and 1:46.8 in
the high altitude meet. Parmely
should see mostly 200 and 500
freestyle races this year.
Miller Comes On Strong
Doug Miller, third in the
AAWU 200 butterfly as a sopho
more, has had a chance for au
tumn conditioning this season,
and should accompany Nicolao
to the NCAA finals in 1967.
Bill Schubach, last year's back

stroke stalwart, has graduated,
leaving Pete Siebert, Bob Hart,
and Bill Kee to handle the up
side-down chores. From early
season indications, the three
sophomores should fill in the
gap.
The Tribe also lost conference
champion diver Bill Freeman.
Bill Kennedy and Dave Duxbury
will be doing the board work for
the Indians.
Freestylers Add Depth
Jeff Hammett, Tom Jamison,
Bill Derrig, and Jack Collins give
the Cards great depth in the
sprint and middle distance free
style events.
Last year, the varsity broke 11
of the 16 Stanford records. Not
a single one should survive be
yond the AAWU championships
this year.

Stanford's dual meet sched
ule, lighter than usual to facili
tate training for tho Big One,
has one spectular highlight. USC
and UCLA, who will join Stan
ford among the top 4 in the coun
try this year, crash head-on into
the Indians in one weekend, Feb
ruary 17-18.
Some 15 probable members of
the next Olympic team will test
the Encina Pool in a national
collegiate preview.
Beavers Can't Bite
Oregon State should pose no
problems whatsoever for the
swimming Indians today. Stan
ford coach Jim Gaughran will
enter an experimental lineup,
probably with each man swim
ming only once.
Oregon's only big throat comes
in the person of junior Bob
Boyer. Late in December, Boyer
hit a 21.8 50 and a 49.0 100
Frosh Squad Lacks Depth
Papooses swimmers open their
season January 27 against Cal,
and will need every minute of
the next three weks to prepare
for the season. The frosh have
a number of bright spots, but
severely lack depth.
High school Ail-Americans Jim
Nickoloff (100 fly) and Richie
Williams (200 free/200 IM/100
fly) top the list of freshman
aqualetes.
Bill Main, CIF diving champion
from Palo Alto, promises to
stand well above the rest of the

West Coast's divers. Main is also
an Ail-American 50 freestyler.
Nick Dondero, of Las Vegas,
could significantly bolster thf
Tribe's breaststroking future.
The Papooses need a back
stroker and depth in a large
number of events.
Stanford swimmers take their
first strokes on the long pull to
the choppy headwaters of the
NCAA when Oregon State visits
the Encina Pool at 3 p.m. this
.afternoon. Saturday at 2 p.m.,
the Oregon Ducks paddle over
the waterfall into the Indians'
hungry hands.
Swimming World rated the
Cards second in the country be
hind USC. UCLA, Yale, and In
diana are also clustered about
ihe number one spot. Stanford
proved the predictions wrong
last year when the Tribe took
sixth after being picked for
ninth place.

Last year's varsity remains
virtually intact.
Three World Record Holders
World record holders Dick
Roth, Greg Buckingham, and
Luis Nicolao put the biggest
threats on the blocks that Stan
ford has ever known. The fresh
man team that broke five NCAA
freshman records last year has
come of age. The Papooses, stung
by colds, mono, and adverse meet
