# UPSET-MINDED
## Grapplers Face Mean Bulldogs 
### NICK SELBY 
"When the going gets tough,
the tough get going."
This time-tested exhortation
hangs on the walls of Stanford's
wrestling room, and its message
is particularly applicable to
coach Jerry Budzik's men today
and tomorrow.
The grapplers face a strong
team from Fresno State tomor
row night at 8 p.m. in Encina
gymnasium The Bulldogs finish
ed 40 points ahead of the Indian
matmen in the recent NorCal in
vitational at San Jose.
Toughest Meet
The dual meet will probably
be the toughest of the year for
Stanford for several reasons.
First, the matmen will have
had only three days of team
practice since the start of the
quarter. Many were limited in
practice opportunities during the
vacation, and will need more
time to regain top form.

Coach Budzik, on the other
hand, figures that the Fresno
team will have had more prac
tices.
Second, although the Fresno
State team will not be Stanford's
toughest opponent per se, when
the Indian matmen met Cal Poly
and Oregon State, they will be
in better shape, have more ex
perience, and be far more con
fident.
Upset Within Beach
So the grapplers have an up
hill fight ahead of them. But, an
upset victory is entirely within
reach
The source of such an upset
will be the strong middle from
145 pounds to 177 pounds. Jun
ior John Suttle will go at 145
now that his shoulder sprain is
gone.
At 152 is the mainstay of the
varsity, captain Len Borchers,
whose sprained ankle is now
fully recovered. A sophomore, he

won that AAU meet at 152, was
the outstanding wrestler of the
Far Westerns last year, and is
an almost sure bet for confer
ence stardom this year.
Vogelpohl Hungry
Following Borchers will be Bill
Vogelpohl, who fresh from a
NorCal second place, is hungry
for continued success. At 167
will be Burt Ambler, experienced
and capable, Bud Hollingberry
is the 177 pounder, back from
last year's varsity, and all set
for the start of the dual meets.
A win from these five men
should provide the victory mar
gin Saturday.
Best Needed
In the opening weights, Stan
ford features John Tarn at 123,
Rocky Carroll at 130, and Gerald
Beaudoin at 137. Beaudoin may
move up to 145 if Suttle can't
make weight. Coach Budzik sees
victories in these weights if each
man gives his best performance.

At heavyweight will be either
Terry Crenshaw or Rick Linds
ley. Lindsley got a third in the
NorCal tourney. The teams will
not wrestle either 115 or 191.
Frosh Five Hot
Depending on how many men
are ready after the vacation, the
freshman wrestling team will
probably only have five men to
face the Fresno State freshman
team. But coach Dave Reed is
confident of their abilities to
garner wins.
At 123, Mike Pete will step
on the mat, followed by Van Ben
nett at 130. There are no men
for 137 and 145, but Rick Smith
will go at 152 or 160. Jeff Preefer
may go at 123, thereby moving
the first two up a weight.
Bill Ross, a good prospect at
177, is now recovered from his
shoulder spearation. Ben Schae
fer, a new man on the squad,
will probably westle heavy
weight.

NorCal second place, is hungry
for continued success. At 167
will be Burt Ambler, experienced
and capable, Bud Hollingberry
is the 177 pounder, back from
last year's varsity, and all set
for the start of the dual meets.
A win from these five men
should provide the victory mar
gin Saturday.
Best Needed
In the opening weights, Stan
ford features John Tarn at 123,
Rocky Carroll at 130, and Gerald
Beaudoin at 137. Beaudoin may
move up to 145 if Suttle can't
make weight. Coach Budzik sees
victories in these weights if each
man gives his best performance.

At heavyweight will be either
Terry Crenshaw or Rick Linds
ley. Lindsley got a third in the
NorCal tourney. The teams will
not wrestle either 115 or 191.
Frosh Five Hot
Depending on how many men
are ready after the vacation, the
freshman wrestling team will
probably only have five men to
face the Fresno State freshman
team. But coach Dave Reed is
confident of their abilities to
garner wins.
At 123, Mike Pete will step
on the mat, followed by Van Ben
nett at 130. There are no men
for 137 and 145, but Rick Smith
will go at 152 or 160. Jeff Preefer
may go at 123, thereby moving
the first two up a weight.
Bill Ross, a good prospect at
177, is now recovered from his
shoulder spearation. Ben Schae
fer, a new man on the squad,
will probably westle heavy
weight.
"When the going gets tough,
the tough get going."
This time-tested exhortation
hangs on the walls of Stanford's
wrestling room, and its message
is particularly applicable to
coach Jerry Budzik's men today
and tomorrow.
The grapplers face a strong
team from Fresno State tomor
row night at 8 p.m. in Encina
gymnasium The Bulldogs finish
ed 40 points ahead of the Indian
matmen in the recent NorCal in
vitational at San Jose.
Toughest Meet
The dual meet will probably
be the toughest of the year for
Stanford for several reasons.
First, the matmen will have
had only three days of team
practice since the start of the
quarter. Many were limited in
practice opportunities during the
vacation, and will need more
time to regain top form.

Coach Budzik, on the other
hand, figures that the Fresno
team will have had more prac
tices.
Second, although the Fresno
State team will not be Stanford's
toughest opponent per se, when
the Indian matmen met Cal Poly
and Oregon State, they will be
in better shape, have more ex
perience, and be far more con
fident.
Upset Within Beach
So the grapplers have an up
hill fight ahead of them. But, an
upset victory is entirely within
reach
The source of such an upset
will be the strong middle from
145 pounds to 177 pounds. Jun
ior John Suttle will go at 145
now that his shoulder sprain is
gone.
At 152 is the mainstay of the
varsity, captain Len Borchers,
whose sprained ankle is now
fully recovered. A sophomore, he

won that AAU meet at 152, was
the outstanding wrestler of the
Far Westerns last year, and is
an almost sure bet for confer
ence stardom this year.
Vogelpohl Hungry
Following Borchers will be Bill
Vogelpohl, who fresh from a
NorCal second place, is hungry
for continued success. At 167
will be Burt Ambler, experienced
and capable, Bud Hollingberry
is the 177 pounder, back from
last year's varsity, and all set
