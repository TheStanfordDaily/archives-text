# Cards Jump Into Pacific-8 Play Against Oregon, OSU
## 
### BILL GRAHAM 
Coming home after two upset
victories and a third place finish
in the Ail-American Tournament,
Stanford's varsity basketball
team faces the University of
Oregon, tonight, at 8 p.m. and
Oregon State, Saturday at the
same time, in the Cards' first
contests with Pacific Eight
teams.
Arthur Harris, who leads the
team in scoring with an 17 point
average and in rebounds with 73,
will be starting at forward for
the Indians. Senior Howard Has
sen wil lstart at the other for
ward spot.
Rich Baker, the tallest starter
at 6-7 will handles the center
position. At guards, Coach Howie
Dallmar will have Gary Peters*
meyer, who is second to Harris
with an 11.8 average and Bill
Halligan, who has started the
last three games in the place of
Don Griffin. Halligan is consid
ered to be the stronger of the
two defensively, although Dall
mar says Griffin, who is a better
shooter, will see plenty of action
in both games.
In addition to Griffin, Dallmar
plans to use sophomores Mai
MacElwain and Ed Martin heav
ily in relief at forward and cen
ter.
Oregon and OSU are two of
the smaller teams in the Con
ference, but the Tribe will still

be giving a small edge in height
to both.
Nick Jones will pose the big
gest problem for Stanford when
they come up against Oregon.
"Everything revolves around
him," said Dallmar of the 6-2
guard, who has averaged 11.4
points a game over the last two
seasons.
The Tribe will also have to
contend with the Duck's three
big me up front. Center John
Pinkstaff (6-7) and forwards Bill
Thomas (6-6) and Bob Craven
(6-7) will give Stanford plenty
of competition for rebounds.
Dallmar feels that the game will
"hinge on how we do off the
boards." All of Stanford's losses
have been due to lack of size
under the basket.
Red-hot Fritz
Against the Oregon State Beav
ers the Cards will have another
red-hot guard to contend with
in Vince Fritz, who has been
averaging 18 points a game in
his first year of varsity play.
The Beavers, last year's Pa
cific Eight Champions, started
off the season well, but ran into

trouble in the Far Western Clas
sic, where they had a rough time
against the zone defenses that
were thrown against them.
Added Experience
Adding experience to sopho
more Fritz's talent will be 6-6
center Ed Fredenburg and 6-5
Loy Peterson at forward. Both
are holdovers from last year's
starting five and Peterson was
last year's lead scorer with 359
points. Fredenburg has been a
starter for the past two seasons,
and leads the team in rebounds
this year with 80.
The freshman basketball team
will play a game preceding each
varsity contest. The Papooses
take on San Jose State tonight
and Moffett Field, a service team,
on Saturday. Both games will
start at 6 p.m.

Coming home after two upset
victories and a third place finish
in the Ail-American Tournament,
Stanford's varsity basketball
team faces the University of
Oregon, tonight, at 8 p.m. and
Oregon State, Saturday at the
same time, in the Cards' first
contests with Pacific Eight
teams.
Arthur Harris, who leads the
team in scoring with an 17 point
average and in rebounds with 73,
will be starting at forward for
the Indians. Senior Howard Has
sen wil lstart at the other for
ward spot.
Rich Baker, the tallest starter
at 6-7 will handles the center
position. At guards, Coach Howie
Dallmar will have Gary Peters*
meyer, who is second to Harris
with an 11.8 average and Bill
Halligan, who has started the
last three games in the place of
Don Griffin. Halligan is consid
ered to be the stronger of the
two defensively, although Dall
mar says Griffin, who is a better
shooter, will see plenty of action
in both games.
In addition to Griffin, Dallmar
plans to use sophomores Mai
MacElwain and Ed Martin heav
ily in relief at forward and cen
ter.
Oregon and OSU are two of
the smaller teams in the Con
ference, but the Tribe will still

be giving a small edge in height
to both.
Nick Jones will pose the big
gest problem for Stanford when
they come up against Oregon.
"Everything revolves around
him," said Dallmar of the 6-2
guard, who has averaged 11.4
points a game over the last two
seasons.
The Tribe will also have to
contend with the Duck's three
big me up front. Center John
Pinkstaff (6-7) and forwards Bill
Thomas (6-6) and Bob Craven
(6-7) will give Stanford plenty
of competition for rebounds.
Dallmar feels that the game will
"hinge on how we do off the
boards." All of Stanford's losses
have been due to lack of size
under the basket.
Red-hot Fritz
Against the Oregon State Beav
ers the Cards will have another
red-hot guard to contend with
in Vince Fritz, who has been
averaging 18 points a game in
his first year of varsity play.
The Beavers, last year's Pa
cific Eight Champions, started
off the season well, but ran into

trouble in the Far Western Clas
sic, where they had a rough time
against the zone defenses that
were thrown against them.
Added Experience
Adding experience to sopho
more Fritz's talent will be 6-6
center Ed Fredenburg and 6-5
Loy Peterson at forward. Both
are holdovers from last year's
starting five and Peterson was
last year's lead scorer with 359
points. Fredenburg has been a
starter for the past two seasons,
and leads the team in rebounds
this year with 80.
The freshman basketball team
will play a game preceding each
varsity contest. The Papooses
take on San Jose State tonight
and Moffett Field, a service team,
on Saturday. Both games will
start at 6 p.m.
