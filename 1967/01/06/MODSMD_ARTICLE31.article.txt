# Two Minutes of Haight
## Discussing The Greeks? 
### Tim Haight 
An adequate, objective discus
sion of fraternities is all but im
possible. It's like LSD—if you
have taken it, you're prejudiced
because of your trip, and if you
haven't taken it, you don't know
what it's all about.
The question is usually further
obscured by the timing of dis
cussions. Most of them follow
on the heels of some minor
atrocity which casts the group in
a bad light. After that comes the
reaction where the attacked
group and its supporters call the
criticism emotional and exces
sive.
Certain things can be men
tioned, however. Fraternities be
gan in the last four decades of
the nineteenth century as a re
action to impersonalism in the
colleges. Under the German
model of the university, then in
vogue, dormitory life was really
de-emphasized, and the univer
sity's old interest in the student's
soul was replaced by diversified
approaches to his mind.
At The Heart
The current defense of frater
nities is similar. A close asso
ciation, in these trying times,
gives students a feeling of se
curity—a feeling that some, at
least, accept them as people, not
just as names on a grade sheet.
The heart of the fraternity sys
tem is selection, the process that
creates the closest coincidence of
likes and dislikes possible over
the limited rush period.

Yet at the same time that this
selection is a positive good, in
that it leads to security, human
warmth and the feeling of a like
ness of view, this point is also
the main drawback of the fra
ternity system.
The concept of "selective per
ception" is familiar to most who
have taken any beginning social
science course. People tend to
read the newspapers that agree
with them, to cultivate friends
with like views, to tune in to
political speeches for their own
party.
Pure Bliss
Selective perception reduces
the possibility of dissonance,
that uncomfortable feeling when
two of your opinions do not fit—
as when a popular friend of
yours expresses a very unpop
ular view. The less dissonance,
the more the feeling of security,
of self-confidence. Ah, ignorance
is bliss.
But is that what we're after at
a university? Or aren't we try
ing here to encourage open
mindedness, academic devotion
to truth, and the obligation to
fairly consider all the evidence?
That the fraternity only mir
rors an all-too-human character
istic in its selection process does
not mean that it fits in with the
purposes of a university.
This is a real dilemma. Do we
sacrifice the human association
of selective living for the intel
lectual challenge of meeting all
kinds whether they are fun to be

around or not, or do we say that
this place is depersonalized
enough as it already is and that
education need not be a twenty
four-hour-a-day experience?
Compromise
We all have our opinions, and
between are the modifications
that say that non-fraternity peo
ple aren't all alienated on one
hand and that fraternities can
reinforce learning on the other.
But this just leaves us with a
lot of talk.
It is time for a compromise.
To the most militant on either
side, it may sound like no com
promise at all, but that is to be
expected. Institute a draw sys
tem.
Anybody who says that no
selection is going on among the
choice of women's residences is
kidding. Perhaps the stereotypic
poles of the Row and Union are
not (at least in one case) evi
dent any more, but birds of a
feather are still getting into
roughly the same flock.
At the same time, the system
would be somewhat more open
ended and that disgusting ritual
that makes freshman X arbi
trarily "better" than freshman
Y at the end of Spring Quar
ter would be ended. All of this
has been said before, I know,
and there are problems—finan
cial, local, and national—which
would have to be worked out.
But Stanford owes it to itself
to try. The present conflict is
not a good place to be.

purposes of a university.
This is a real dilemma. Do we
sacrifice the human association
of selective living for the intel
lectual challenge of meeting all
kinds whether they are fun to be

around or not, or do we say that
this place is depersonalized
enough as it already is and that
education need not be a twenty
four-hour-a-day experience?
Compromise
We all have our opinions, and
between are the modifications
that say that non-fraternity peo
ple aren't all alienated on one
hand and that fraternities can
reinforce learning on the other.
But this just leaves us with a
lot of talk.
It is time for a compromise.
To the most militant on either
side, it may sound like no com
promise at all, but that is to be
expected. Institute a draw sys
tem.
Anybody who says that no
selection is going on among the
choice of women's residences is
kidding. Perhaps the stereotypic
poles of the Row and Union are
not (at least in one case) evi
dent any more, but birds of a
feather are still getting into
roughly the same flock.
At the same time, the system
would be somewhat more open
ended and that disgusting ritual
that makes freshman X arbi
trarily "better" than freshman
Y at the end of Spring Quar
ter would be ended. All of this
has been said before, I know,
and there are problems—finan
cial, local, and national—which
would have to be worked out.
But Stanford owes it to itself
to try. The present conflict is
not a good place to be.
An adequate, objective discus
sion of fraternities is all but im
possible. It's like LSD—if you
have taken it, you're prejudiced
because of your trip, and if you
haven't taken it, you don't know
what it's all about.
The question is usually further
obscured by the timing of dis
cussions. Most of them follow
on the heels of some minor
atrocity which casts the group in
a bad light. After that comes the
reaction where the attacked
group and its supporters call the
criticism emotional and exces
sive.
Certain things can be men
tioned, however. Fraternities be
gan in the last four decades of
the nineteenth century as a re
action to impersonalism in the
colleges. Under the German
model of the university, then in
vogue, dormitory life was really
de-emphasized, and the univer
sity's old interest in the student's
soul was replaced by diversified
approaches to his mind.
At The Heart
The current defense of frater
nities is similar. A close asso
ciation, in these trying times,
gives students a feeling of se
curity—a feeling that some, at
least, accept them as people, not
just as names on a grade sheet.
The heart of the fraternity sys
tem is selection, the process that
creates the closest coincidence of
likes and dislikes possible over
the limited rush period.

Yet at the same time that this
selection is a positive good, in
that it leads to security, human
warmth and the feeling of a like
ness of view, this point is also
the main drawback of the fra
ternity system.
The concept of "selective per
ception" is familiar to most who
have taken any beginning social
science course. People tend to
read the newspapers that agree
with them, to cultivate friends
with like views, to tune in to
political speeches for their own
party.
Pure Bliss
Selective perception reduces
the possibility of dissonance,
that uncomfortable feeling when
two of your opinions do not fit—
as when a popular friend of
yours expresses a very unpop
ular view. The less dissonance,
the more the feeling of security,
of self-confidence. Ah, ignorance
is bliss.
But is that what we're after at
a university? Or aren't we try
ing here to encourage open
mindedness, academic devotion
to truth, and the obligation to
fairly consider all the evidence?

At The Heart
The current defense of frater
nities is similar. A close asso
ciation, in these trying times,
gives students a feeling of se
curity—a feeling that some, at
least, accept them as people, not
just as names on a grade sheet.
The heart of the fraternity sys
tem is selection, the process that
creates the closest coincidence of
likes and dislikes possible over
the limited rush period.

Yet at the same time that this
selection is a positive good, in
that it leads to security, human
warmth and the feeling of a like
ness of view, this point is also
the main drawback of the fra
ternity system.
The concept of "selective per
ception" is familiar to most who
have taken any beginning social
science course. People tend to
read the newspapers that agree
with them, to cultivate friends
with like views, to tune in to
political speeches for their own
party.
Pure Bliss
Selective perception reduces
the possibility of dissonance,
that uncomfortable feeling when
two of your opinions do not fit—
as when a popular friend of
yours expresses a very unpop
ular view. The less dissonance,
the more the feeling of security,
of self-confidence. Ah, ignorance
is bliss.
But is that what we're after at
a university? Or aren't we try
ing here to encourage open
mindedness, academic devotion
to truth, and the obligation to
fairly consider all the evidence?
That the fraternity only mir
rors an all-too-human character
istic in its selection process does
not mean that it fits in with the
purposes of a university.
This is a real dilemma. Do we
sacrifice the human association
of selective living for the intel
lectual challenge of meeting all
kinds whether they are fun to be

around or not, or do we say that
this place is depersonalized
enough as it already is and that
education need not be a twenty
four-hour-a-day experience?
Compromise
We all have our opinions, and
between are the modifications
that say that non-fraternity peo
ple aren't all alienated on one
hand and that fraternities can
reinforce learning on the other.
But this just leaves us with a
lot of talk.
It is time for a compromise.
To the most militant on either
side, it may sound like no com
promise at all, but that is to be
expected. Institute a draw sys
tem.
Anybody who says that no
selection is going on among the
choice of women's residences is
kidding. Perhaps the stereotypic
poles of the Row and Union are
not (at least in one case) evi
dent any more, but birds of a
feather are still getting into
roughly the same flock.
At the same time, the system
would be somewhat more open
ended and that disgusting ritual
that makes freshman X arbi
trarily "better" than freshman
Y at the end of Spring Quar
ter would be ended. All of this
has been said before, I know,
and there are problems—finan
cial, local, and national—which
would have to be worked out.
But Stanford owes it to itself
to try. The present conflict is
not a good place to be.
