# Letters To The Editor
## Washington U. Disclaims Innocence 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Re November 23 letter from
"Fort Worth Mother." Poor,
poor mommy.
We on the editorial staff of
STUDENT LIFE, the newspaper
at Washington University (not
George Washington University,
as she calls it) in St. Louis feel
quite insulted that she has paint
ed such a rosy picture of our
school as seen through the eyes
of her innocent freshman daugh
ter and (most disconcerting!)
through the pages of our news
paper. Come now. mommy, no
one can be as apple pie, mother
hood and flag as we have been
called.
We do not know who the Fort
Worth daughter is, but she cer
tainly must be getting the wrong
impression of our University. A
stack of clippings from recent
copies of STUDENT LIFE paint
a somewhat red—not rosy—pic
ture of our school as well as
adding touches of tumult, terror
and unrest.
Note some of the headlines:
"Burglars Loot Machines in
Crime Wave," "Legalize Mari
juana," "WIT SDS Picketers Ar
rested by Police," "VD Scare
Over," "Pickets Protest outside
As Vice President Speaks."
To this, add some of our edi
torials asking for recognition of
the Dubois Club, commenting on
SDS's nationally reported picket
of Hubert Humphrey, demanding
reinstatement of a Marxist eco
nomics professor. Not that we're
red or anything (certainly not
"read" carefully by Texas moth
er)—but since so much turmoil

is going on, we just felt we had
to report it.
But maybe Fort Worth daugh
ter is too busy at sorority parties
or study dates to realize that
Washington University has its
share of deadbeats, leftists,
crooks, "sloppy, socialistic slobs"
and walking armpits, too. We
shall not be outdone by any oth
er school on this score.
I hope dear Fort Worth Moth
er will come up to visit us at
plain ol* WASHINGTON UNI
VERSITY one of these days. If
she is able to overlook the week
ly Vietnam Peace Vigil, the bo
hemian colonies and the incredi
bly vile-mannered fraternity
men, then maybe she will still
feel that everything is just
peachy here at Washington Uni
versity.
On behalf of the student news
paper, I ask you to print this let
ter so "Fort Worth Mother" can
see what is going on in St. Louis.
I don't think she reads it in our
Washington University paper.

Editor, The Dally:
Mr. Gruber's article of Jan
uary sth makes interesting read
ing but in true journalistic tradi
tion contains certain inaccuracies
and presents a limited picture of
the subject. A fact that is not
presented is that the rules are
for the most part taken from
those of the Los Angeles City
Fire Department.
In any emergency service or

ganization it is necessary to
establish a framwork of operat
ing rules and this was done by
the Stanford Fire Department,
based on those of Los Angeles.
Before going into effect, opinions
and criticisms of the rules were
solicited from regular and stu
dent firemen.
Enforcement of the rules is
quite liberal; I have observed
no one disciplined or even criti
cized in the past three years for
discussing religion or politics.
However I am sure that it would
be enforced if such a discussion
were to interfere with a fire
man's work.
The statement of one student
fireman that "all personnel are
instructed to lie" about fires is
totally inaccurate, as is the state
ment that the Chief and one
other officer are the only ones
allowed to talk to "outsiders."
Information about fires and of
ficial matters is given out by any
duty officer, the chief officer, and
the University News Service, and
all inquiries are supposed to be
directed to them.
Finally, at the fire Mr. Gru
ber makes reference to, there
were only three Stanford fire
trucks.

Editor, The Daily:
Thank you for Steve Gruber's
article about the Fire Depart
ment regulations. I had been
under the false impression that
our Police Department was the
only bastion of feudalism on the

campus. Lest you wonder what
this generality refers to, you
might be interested in one ex
ample from my list of discourag
ing experiences with them.
Chief Davis once complained
to me that he was doing us a
great favor to send a patrol car
once or twice a day over to
Encindido Village, because "it
costs more than we get from the
tickets we write there." Try to
top that one, Steve!

Editor, The Daily:
I am writing letter to ask a
big favor of you. I would like
for you to put my name and
address in your school newspa
per.
The reason for this request is,
I don't have a family or real
close friends in the states, so I
don't get very much mail.
All of my friends got a lot of
mail and packages from home,
when I have to read the news
paper after mail call.
I will answer every letter I re
ceive, and will answer all ques
tions pertaining to Vietnam.

I am writing letter to ask a
big favor of you. I would like
for you to put my name and
address in your school newspa
per.
The reason for this request is,
I don't have a family or real
close friends in the states, so I
don't get very much mail.
All of my friends got a lot of
mail and packages from home,
when I have to read the news
paper after mail call.
I will answer every letter I re
ceive, and will answer all ques
tions pertaining to Vietnam.

Re November 23 letter from
"Fort Worth Mother." Poor,
poor mommy.
We on the editorial staff of
STUDENT LIFE, the newspaper
at Washington University (not
George Washington University,
as she calls it) in St. Louis feel
quite insulted that she has paint
ed such a rosy picture of our
school as seen through the eyes
of her innocent freshman daugh
ter and (most disconcerting!)
through the pages of our news
paper. Come now. mommy, no
one can be as apple pie, mother
hood and flag as we have been
called.
We do not know who the Fort
Worth daughter is, but she cer
tainly must be getting the wrong
impression of our University. A
stack of clippings from recent
copies of STUDENT LIFE paint
a somewhat red—not rosy—pic
ture of our school as well as
adding touches of tumult, terror
and unrest.
Note some of the headlines:
"Burglars Loot Machines in
Crime Wave," "Legalize Mari
juana," "WIT SDS Picketers Ar
rested by Police," "VD Scare
Over," "Pickets Protest outside
As Vice President Speaks."
To this, add some of our edi
torials asking for recognition of
the Dubois Club, commenting on
SDS's nationally reported picket
of Hubert Humphrey, demanding
reinstatement of a Marxist eco
nomics professor. Not that we're
red or anything (certainly not
"read" carefully by Texas moth
er)—but since so much turmoil

is going on, we just felt we had
to report it.
But maybe Fort Worth daugh
ter is too busy at sorority parties
or study dates to realize that
Washington University has its
share of deadbeats, leftists,
crooks, "sloppy, socialistic slobs"
and walking armpits, too. We
shall not be outdone by any oth
er school on this score.
I hope dear Fort Worth Moth
er will come up to visit us at
plain ol* WASHINGTON UNI
VERSITY one of these days. If
she is able to overlook the week
ly Vietnam Peace Vigil, the bo
hemian colonies and the incredi
bly vile-mannered fraternity
men, then maybe she will still
feel that everything is just
peachy here at Washington Uni
versity.
On behalf of the student news
paper, I ask you to print this let
ter so "Fort Worth Mother" can
see what is going on in St. Louis.

Editor, The Dally:
Mr. Gruber's article of Jan
uary sth makes interesting read
ing but in true journalistic tradi
tion contains certain inaccuracies
and presents a limited picture of
the subject. A fact that is not
presented is that the rules are
for the most part taken from
those of the Los Angeles City
Fire Department.
In any emergency service or

ganization it is necessary to
establish a framwork of operat
ing rules and this was done by
the Stanford Fire Department,
based on those of Los Angeles.
Before going into effect, opinions
and criticisms of the rules were
solicited from regular and stu
dent firemen.
Enforcement of the rules is
quite liberal; I have observed
no one disciplined or even criti
cized in the past three years for
discussing religion or politics.
However I am sure that it would
be enforced if such a discussion
were to interfere with a fire
man's work.
The statement of one student
fireman that "all personnel are
instructed to lie" about fires is
totally inaccurate, as is the state
ment that the Chief and one
other officer are the only ones
allowed to talk to "outsiders."
Information about fires and of
ficial matters is given out by any
duty officer, the chief officer, and
the University News Service, and
all inquiries are supposed to be
directed to them.
Finally, at the fire Mr. Gru
ber makes reference to, there
were only three Stanford fire
trucks.

the Stanford Fire Department,
based on those of Los Angeles.
Before going into effect, opinions
and criticisms of the rules were
solicited from regular and stu
dent firemen.
Enforcement of the rules is
quite liberal; I have observed
no one disciplined or even criti
cized in the past three years for
discussing religion or politics.
However I am sure that it would
be enforced if such a discussion
were to interfere with a fire
man's work.
The statement of one student
fireman that "all personnel are
instructed to lie" about fires is
totally inaccurate, as is the state
ment that the Chief and one
other officer are the only ones
allowed to talk to "outsiders."
Information about fires and of
ficial matters is given out by any
duty officer, the chief officer, and
the University News Service, and
all inquiries are supposed to be
directed to them.
Finally, at the fire Mr. Gru
ber makes reference to, there
were only three Stanford fire
trucks.

Thank you for Steve Gruber's
article about the Fire Depart
ment regulations. I had been
under the false impression that
our Police Department was the
only bastion of feudalism on the

campus. Lest you wonder what
this generality refers to, you
might be interested in one ex
ample from my list of discourag
ing experiences with them.
Chief Davis once complained
to me that he was doing us a
great favor to send a patrol car
once or twice a day over to
Encindido Village, because "it
costs more than we get from the
tickets we write there." Try to
top that one, Steve!

I am writing letter to ask a
big favor of you. I would like
for you to put my name and
address in your school newspa
per.
The reason for this request is,
I don't have a family or real
close friends in the states, so I
don't get very much mail.
All of my friends got a lot of
mail and packages from home,
when I have to read the news
paper after mail call.
I will answer every letter I re
ceive, and will answer all ques
tions pertaining to Vietnam.

Re November 23 letter from
"Fort Worth Mother." Poor,
poor mommy.
We on the editorial staff of
STUDENT LIFE, the newspaper
at Washington University (not
George Washington University,
as she calls it) in St. Louis feel
quite insulted that she has paint
ed such a rosy picture of our
school as seen through the eyes
of her innocent freshman daugh
ter and (most disconcerting!)
through the pages of our news
paper. Come now. mommy, no
one can be as apple pie, mother
hood and flag as we have been
called.
We do not know who the Fort
Worth daughter is, but she cer
tainly must be getting the wrong
impression of our University. A
stack of clippings from recent
copies of STUDENT LIFE paint
a somewhat red—not rosy—pic
ture of our school as well as
adding touches of tumult, terror
and unrest.
Note some of the headlines:
"Burglars Loot Machines in
Crime Wave," "Legalize Mari
juana," "WIT SDS Picketers Ar
rested by Police," "VD Scare
Over," "Pickets Protest outside
As Vice President Speaks."
To this, add some of our edi
torials asking for recognition of
the Dubois Club, commenting on
SDS's nationally reported picket
of Hubert Humphrey, demanding
reinstatement of a Marxist eco
nomics professor. Not that we're
red or anything (certainly not
"read" carefully by Texas moth
er)—but since so much turmoil

is going on, we just felt we had
to report it.
But maybe Fort Worth daugh
ter is too busy at sorority parties
or study dates to realize that
Washington University has its
share of deadbeats, leftists,
crooks, "sloppy, socialistic slobs"
and walking armpits, too. We
shall not be outdone by any oth
er school on this score.
I hope dear Fort Worth Moth
er will come up to visit us at
plain ol* WASHINGTON UNI
VERSITY one of these days. If
she is able to overlook the week
ly Vietnam Peace Vigil, the bo
hemian colonies and the incredi
bly vile-mannered fraternity
men, then maybe she will still
feel that everything is just
peachy here at Washington Uni
versity.
On behalf of the student news
paper, I ask you to print this let
ter so "Fort Worth Mother" can
see what is going on in St. Louis.
I don't think she reads it in our
Washington University paper.
