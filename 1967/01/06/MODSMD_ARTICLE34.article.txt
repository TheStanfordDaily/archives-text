## Education Springs From Underground 
### Joel Kugelmass 
In these halcyon days of Win
ter quarter, when the weather is
out of joint, the rent strike has
become tactful, and Stanford
brick spreads its ecru-yellow
to drowse us all, three buildings
hold their heads high above an
etherized university.
"A now vacant fraternity,"
once known as the Phi Delt
house, is making ready to be the
Grove Project, an experiment in
intellectual living. The RBR,
where for years sleeping beau
ties and prince charmings nap
ped gently on required reading,
shelters Experimenters as they
give the final shire to psychedelic
strobes.
Improved Fare
It is tempting to eulogize pre
maturely, but it would be worse
not to offer well earned praise.
The Dean's office, traditionally
and often rightly subject to
narsh student criticism, has been
more than helpful and coopera
tive to the Experiment. The Com
mittee on Undergraduate Edu
cation, sometimes seemingly a
vacuum rather than a repository
of educational reform, has be

friended the student in a new
and exciting way through its
approval of the Grove Project.
Alas the Undergraduate Library
with its discomforting comfort,
alas the tardiness of the Univer
sity in giving women off-campus
privilege, alas the campus judi
cial process, and alas the grow
ing evidence that Admissions has
ethnic quotas. It is true, sad to
say, that such compose the daily
fare. But if the meal has been
improved slightly, the chef must
be complimented.
Trial And Error
First, and foremost, these ex
periments bespeak of the fact,
that this University is prepared
to develop only through exam
ple, that lacking a coherrent and
energetic philosophy of educa
tion, Stanford is able to change
only by trial and error. Second,
both show that the Stanford ed
ucation, for nearly all of its
eleven thousand, is without in
timacy, that our academics take
up our time rather than our per
sons. Student interest is a "now
vacant fraternity" and a "now
vacant RBR" and a "now vacant
library" make it obvious that
student apathy has developed to
cope with, not consolidate, an
apathetic University. Students
are more than willing if they
are given the chance to be able.
Finally, for those who care to
listen, the projects remind that
teaching is the principle craft,
and when access to it is cur
tailed by the living group, nar
rowed by an atmosphere, and
dissipated by a frenetic struc
ture, education goes under
ground.
Potential
Above ground, if one compares
the Grove Project to the Experi
ment, certain informative sim
ilarities are noted. Topically,
both consist of seminars devoted
to facets of our own social real
ity to "Contemporary Education"
and "Underdeveloped Nations."
Both are trying to temper sci
entism with a humanism; both
emphasize the small group; both
strive to be self-contained. And
both, unhappily, have been given
the responsibility of proving
themselves to the Stanford com
munity.
In the face of this latter point,
one might exhort those not par
ticipating, approximately one
hundred per cent of the Univer
sity, not to sit and watchâ€”from
the outside the RBR and the Phi
Delt house look much the same.
Instead, perhaps it would not be
ridiculous to think about Flor
ence Moore as a potential intel
lectual community, the New
Cluster as a potential college,
and, dare we say, Stanford as
a potential university.
