# IJB Finds Sterling Sit-inner Guilty Though Unregistered In Crisis
## 
### CHUCK FULKERSON 
The Interim Judicial Body recom
mended that Alan Traister be sub
jected to the same sanctions which
were applied to 23 registered students
who staged the sit-in in President
Sterling's office last May.
The original controversy arose be
cause Traister, who was a participant
in the strike, was at the time an un
registered student, although he had
previously applied and had been ac
cepted for the summer and autumn
quarters. The question was whether
Traister, since he was unregistered at
the time, could be tried by the Student
Judicial Board.
The Dean of Students referred to
the Council, in May of 1966, only
those students who participated in the
strike and were currently registered.
Subsequently Traister's name was
striken from the list and he was
allowed to register for the summer
quarter. The matter appeared to be
closed. However, a hold was placed
on his name when he tried to register
this fall. Dean Winbigler informed
him that the matter would be referred
to the Student Judicial Council.
The Council, however, decided that
they couldn't try Traister on the
grounds that they lacked the proper
jurisdiction. But the Dean of Stu
dents, when notified of this decision,

referred the matter to the Interim
Judicial Body, on October 21, stating
that the IJB had jurisdiction to act
on the grounds that the Judicial Coun
cil had failed or refused to act.
In judging the case, the IJB con
sidered two principal questions; first,
could Traister be subjected to Uni
versity discipline at all since he was
unregistered at the time of the
offense; and, second, were he under
IJB jurisdiction, did the "University
waive its disciplinary jurisdiction by
some act or omission, or lose it by
the simple elapse of time before these
procedings were initiated."
Judicial Ruling
First the IJB decided that Traister
was indeed liable to University dis
cipline even though he was unregis
tered at the time. They based this
decision on the grounds that although
Traister was not registered at the
time of the strike, he had applied and
been accepted for the following two
quarters. When he was accepted the
IJB maintained that he was part of
the University and therefore subject
to its obligations. "Admission," the
body declared, "is somewhat like a
marriage, 'for better or for worse'."
As for the second question, the IJB
considered Traister's claims that he
had been notified that non-students
would not be tried. The body, how

ever, stated that they were unable to
locate the person whom Traister
claimed had notified him. They there
fore nullified this claim.
The IJB also claimed that the delay
in time was inadvertant and also they
felt that the returning Student Judi
cial Board would be more qualified to
deal with the matter than the sum
mer board. On these grounds the In
terim Judicial Body believed it could
and did try Traister as a registered
student.
Disagreement Persists
Although this decision is probably
final, dissent nevertheless persists.
Typical of the complaints raised by

the decision were those voiced by Joel
Kugelmass, then acting Vice-Chair
man of the Student Judicial Board,
which voted not to try Traister.
Kuglemass stated that "the Univer
sity has no right to try an unregis
tered student and I defy the
University to list one significant priv
ilege which the unregistered student
has," which would subordinate him to
university punishment. As for the
IJB's idea of marriage between the
unregistered but accepted student,
Kugelmass declared that "this type of
marriage is like one where the hus
band can live in adultry and the wife
can't."
