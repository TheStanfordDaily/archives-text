# No More 'Spectaculars'
## IIR Stresses Education Out Of Class 
### GAIL ANDERSON 
"The Area Desks of the Institute of
International Relations are manifes
tations of our new philosophy—an
experiment in international relations
that extends education beyond the
classroom," commented Stef Halper,
president of the lIR.

This new philosophy marks a radi
cal change from the lIR policies of
previous years, Halper emphasized.
"Former programs too often em
phasized spectacular presentations at
the expense of educational experi
ence," Halper noted. "There would be
an Asian Culture Week with a kite

flying contest in White Plaza. En
tertainment was sought rather than
education."
Extend Interests
"The new lIR is an agency through
which students cam extend their aca
demic interests into areas in which
no courses are offered at Stanford."
Interests of the different desks in
clude Asia, the Middle East. Africa,
Latin America, Russia and Eastern
Europe, and Western Europe.
The desk groups hold weekly meet
ings at which the students themselves
decide a topic for discussion. Then a
professor is found to lead the discus
sion. He makes a list of suggested
reading materials which will be dealt
with at the seminar. Guest speakers
are also brought into comment on the
specific interests and problems.
Grass Roots
"This stimulates a grass-roots kind
of intellectual interest in an atmo
sphere of give-and-take," commented
Hal per.
In connection with the experimental
nature of the seminars, graduate stu
dents are teaching courses not offered
by the university. More of this is
planned for the future.
All interested students are invited
to participate in the seminars.
Asia Conference
The Asia Desk, largest of the six,
sponsored Newsweek Vietnam corres
pondent Francois Sully in a discus
sion last quarter. David Hung, chair
man of the desk, has organized a
group who will plan and execute a
conference on Southeast Asia this
spring.
The conference will center around

cultural rather than political prob
lems of Southeast Asia. Ethnic, re
ligious and cultural diversity will be
explored as a key to understanding
the political crises of the area.
New View
"We can gain a new view of Asian
affairs by seeing how the Asian stu
dents regard their own problems,"
commented Hung on the participation
of foreign students in the discussions.
The Middle East desk sponsors a
class in Arabic, a language not
offered at Stanford. Taught by grad
uate student Edward Azar, the class
has had a good response in the last
few months.
Other programs during autumn
quarter included a Soviet Desk spon
soring of Professor Ivo Lederer, who
spoke on his experiences in Eastern
Europe and recent visit to the Soviet
Union.
The Africa desk, in conjunction
with Professor David Abernathy and
Ola Oyelaran, has held Thursday
lunches at Tresidder, open to all stu
dents, at which discussions and ques
tion-and-answer sessions were held.
Another result of the desks has
been the publication of periodicals
and Journals of various interests by
the llR—another new development.
'The seminars offer an opportunity
for closer contact between foreign
and American students," commented
Rick Baum, Vice-President in charge
of International Relations. "In addi
tion, it allows Stanford students
closer contact with professors on an
informal basis.
"Ultimately we hope to stimulate
a more academic yet personal involve
ment in international relations at
Stanford."
