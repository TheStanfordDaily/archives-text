# Warren G. Wonka Reappears As Activist
## 
### KIRK HANSON Celebrity Editor 
Warren G. Wonka came home yes
terday. Touring the Stanford campus
with the famous Stanford graduate
was this Daily reporter.
Wonka talked constantly during his
four hour stay about his exploits since
his last visit in May of 1962. Since
then Warren has experienced a com
plete transition, emerging as a po
litical activist of the first rank.
During the last election Warren
led the Clean Bible Society of Watson
ville in a drive for passage of the
CLEAN amendment. "I supported the
CLEAN amendment," says Wonka,
"to make the clean Bible a reality.
"Certainly the most dangerous book
on the shelves today is the Bible,
which in nearly every version con
tains hundreds of filthy, immoral pas
sages, obviously added by evil men
plotting to subvert the true Christian
faith."
CLEAN Plan
In November, Wonka confided to
Ait Hoppe in the San Francisco
Chronicle that "We are confident that
all of the State's dirty Bibles can be

replaced by Clean Bibles within two
weeks after the Clean Proposition be
comes law."
But CLEAN was defeated and War
ren is now taking a well-earned rest
from his labors. He says he is getting
restless again sitting in Watsonville
and may soon Ptart to travel again.
The Daily has closely followed
Wonka's travels since he graduated
from Stanford in June 1951. His globe
trotting has taken him to Antarctica
with Navy Operation Deepfreeze, to
Timbuctu in Africa for spiritual and
healing work among the natives, and
to many undisclosed places as an
agent of the State Department.
Impassioned Plea
During the past few years Wonka's
whereabouts have been unknown. On
May 19, 1956 The Daily published a
missing persons report and made the
plea "WARREN COME HOME."
Wonka said yesterday that he was
glad to at last be able to oblige. "I
am sorry for any trouble my absence
caused anyone, but when you work
for the State Department, you have
to be gone an awful lot."
Commenting on his younger sis

ter's election as Stanford's first home
coming queen, he said: "I am not sur
prised you students voted out home
coming queens. When Wendy starts
something, she usually finishes it."
When Warren was at Stanford, he
too was a controversial campus char
acter. He entered Stanford in 1938 and
the Chappie immediately took note
by portraying him as a bra salesman
in one of their advertisements.
Mother's Club
Between then and 1952 when he fi
nally graduated, Wonka was regis
tered in many courses, once received
a B- in Western Civ, and was listed
as a member of the Mother's Club in
several regbooks. He has been listed
for graduation several times and fi
nally made it in 1952.
But before he left Stanford, he was
involved in one of his greatest ex
ploits. Late on the night of May 26,
1951, Warren snuck into the private
office of President Sterling in his
home and left a note in his private
files. Wonka's note read in part: "Just
wanted to prove it could still be done.
We were careful not to harm or dis
turb anything (Better watch those
diplomas). We missed you in church."

Dr. Sterling discovered the note in
his files in 1957 (?) and immediately
asked his administration assistant,
Frederick Glover, to investigate. Ad
ministration officials decided it was
too late to revoke his graduation.
An Accident?
In October, 1961 The Associated
Press reported that Wonka had es
caped serious injury in an auto acci
dent near Klamath Falls, Oregon.
Wonka wrote a letter to Collier's in
1952 criticizing an article on campus
clothes. It was printed and said in
part: "In regard to your uninformed
article Campus Cues for Clothes, no
Stanford students would dream of
starting a school year with so few
as three suits and only five sweaters."
Wonka even got involved with Estes
Kefauver when that gentleman was
running for the presidential nomina
tion in 1956. Warren apparently con
tributed to Kefauver's campaign and
a letter was received at Toyon Hall
thanking Warren for his contribution
and was signed by the Senator.
Warren yesterday chuckled at his
exploits. "You know,"he said, "Stan
ford really does prepare you for a
liberal education."
