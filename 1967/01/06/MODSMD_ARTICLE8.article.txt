# Saigon: A City Of Decay, Deception
## 
### 
Part Two
SAIGON (CPS) — Saigon is
a jaded city. There are no in
nocents here, not even little kids.
Everything happens in the
streets, and a ten-year-old Viet
namese girl is likely to know
more about the way adults be
have in the dark or under stress
than a 20-year-old American col
lege boy.
Layers of dust give busy
streets the same dull yellow look
as the stucco walls 1 around
French villas and office build
ings.
For lack of private toilet fa
cilities, many urinate or defe
cate in alleys and streets. A
year ago piles of garbage lay
rotting on Saigon's main boule
vards, and even now in some
places the trucks can't cart it
away fast enough.
On Freedom Street
On Tu Do (Freedom) Street,
once a fashionable office and
shopping district, scores of bars
now cater to American Gl's.
The dull, inevitable pump of
Nancy Sinatra or the Beatles
lasts from three in the after
noon to eleven at night, when
military police move through to
hustle lingerers home before
curfew.
Inside, a young air cavalry
man down from An Khe tells a
sad-looking girl the same war
story he told another girl last
night, and wishes he were tell
ing it to the girl back home. For
her part, the bar girl tells him
in broken English about her
divided family — maybe the
same story she told last night,
maybe not — and wonders if he
will take her home. She made
more money last week than her
father did last year. Prices are
higher now though.
Draft Dodgers
Students dodging the draft
buy forged credentials, and
money changers — who often
turn out to be sleight of hand
artists or secret police agents —
promise double the official rate
for greenbacks.
The refugees and the poor live
in their alleys on the perimeter
of the middle-class city. These
thoroughfares, some of them all
of three feet wide, wind in inter
minable mazes wherever there
is ground to build a house.
Despite the weariness, the
closeness and the heat, Saigon's
culture has a spontaneity that
twenty years of war has not
stamped out.

Delta hospitality is famous
throughout Southeast Asia; any
guest is given the best in the
house.

Night life is tinny, but those
who frequent the city's clubs
give it a pulsing rhythm of its
own. Any soldier lives close to
the surface, and the Vietnamese
infantryman tends to be more
fatalistic than most. A terrorist
grenade or a drunken officer's
pistol shot could end it any
time. Private dance parties re
quire a permit, but many young
hosts and hostesses take their
chances and often wind up with
the police as uninvited guests.
French influence is still evi
dent everywhere. Those city
boys who have managed to
avoid the draft often affect
French styles in dress, haircuts,
and speech.
Educational Evolution
Well-stocked French book
stores bear testimony to a large
class of people who continue to
enjoy European literature for
its own sake. At this moment,
controversy rages over whether
to permit the French to main
tain their prestigious lycees, and
whether or not to substitute
Vietnamese — or English — for
Fx'ench as the language of in
struction in the universities.
The performing arts have
been hit hard by the war, but
every week or so a concert or
recital is announced, and Viet
namese plays draw large audi
ences.
Buddhist activity has waned
considerably since Prime Min
ister Ky's successful crackdown
on the Struggle Movement in
Hue last spring. Still, the pa
godas are filled with saffron-clad
monks trying to patch up or
widen further the rift in the
Buddhist Unified Church. Bud
dhist and Confucian funerals
periodically fill the streets with
color.
The newspapers are still sub
ject to government censorship,
but political discussions in res
taurants and cafes are often

heated and free. Unlike the last
days under Diem, students now
do not hesitate to criticize the
regime, and charges of corrup
tion and/or incompetence are
regularly if quietly flung at

some of the Directory's leading
generals.
But political discussions, even
those involving the new Con
stituent Assembly, inevitably
smack of resignation. South

Vietnam is at war against itseLf,
Saigon is under siege, and even
the most hopeful know that ; s
long as this goes on, and may
be longer, the generals will
wield effective power.
