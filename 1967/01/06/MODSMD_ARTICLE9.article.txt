# Tension And Doubt Prevail
## 
### 
SAIGON (CPS) — More than
anything, Saigon is a tentative,
uncertain city, a city on the de
fensive against force — against
the military, against the Ameri
can, and against the Viet Cong.
If there is a universal mood
here, it is the urge to protect
and cling to what little culture
and happiness and peace can be
salvaged from the war, from
well-meaning but rough and
free-spending American troops,
and from infiltrating terrorists.
The faces of the people tell
you nothing. Little children are
often quick to smile and say,
"Hello, 0.K." Older people sel
dom either smile or scowl and
teen-agers and young adults
sometimes seem as impassive or
inscrutable as their parents.
A visitor would guess that,
except for those who are mak
ing a living off them, Vietna
mese in Saigon do not particu
larly care for Americans but
are waiting to see if they are
going to win. One senses that
this is still an open question,
and that no one is in a hurry to
predict the answer.
Psychological Tension
No city can completely nor
malize war. Tempers grow
short, psychological tensions
mount, and there is no place to
go. A quiet drive in the country
would be impossible even if you
had a car.
Yoir notice that the American
official getting out of his sedan
with gold bag in hand, goes into

a hotel whose entrance is sand
bagged and guarded by a GI,
like any other of the scores of
American military billets in Sai
gon.
You notice that barbed wire
surrounding the headquarters of
the Military Directory at Gia
Long Palace and the Prime Min
ister's office on Thong Nhut.
You read every once in a
while of a taxi driver wounded
by a GI sentry, alert for terror
ists, who shot too quickly when
the taxi broke down in front of
his billet.
Snow Shovel?
You notice an American car
disappearing into the big US
AID No. 1 compound on Le Van
Duyet Street. A Vietnamese
guard has just walked around
it with what looks like a snow
shovel. On closer examination, it
is a mirror, used to check for
mines which might be attached
to the underside of the car.
Between 12 and 4 in the morn
ing, the streets are quiet except

for an occasional convoy rumbl
ing through the city on its way
to a battlefield.
Night in Saigon belongs to
the police. During curfew, they
move through each of the city's
lien gia's (neighborhoods of ten
to fifteen families presided
over by a head man responsible
to the officials), and make spot
checks at different homes, called
"family roll calls," to discover
infiltrators.
Night Falls
On the outskirts of the city
orange flares drift slowly down
over forest and paddy as armed
helicopters hover over firefights
between infiltrating guerillas
and government troops defend
ing the capital's security belt.
Jets roar past overhead.
And in the distance, there H
the dull boom of mortars lob
bing shells into supposed Viet
Cong positions beyond the city's
defense perimeter.
It is at night that the war
closes in on Saigon.

Night Falls
On the outskirts of the city
orange flares drift slowly down
over forest and paddy as armed
helicopters hover over firefights
between infiltrating guerillas
and government troops defend
ing the capital's security belt.
Jets roar past overhead.
And in the distance, there H
the dull boom of mortars lob
bing shells into supposed Viet
Cong positions beyond the city's
defense perimeter.
It is at night that the war
closes in on Saigon.
SAIGON (CPS) — More than
anything, Saigon is a tentative,
uncertain city, a city on the de
fensive against force — against
the military, against the Ameri
can, and against the Viet Cong.
If there is a universal mood
here, it is the urge to protect
and cling to what little culture
and happiness and peace can be
salvaged from the war, from
well-meaning but rough and
free-spending American troops,
and from infiltrating terrorists.
The faces of the people tell
you nothing. Little children are
often quick to smile and say,
"Hello, 0.K." Older people sel
dom either smile or scowl and
teen-agers and young adults
sometimes seem as impassive or
inscrutable as their parents.
A visitor would guess that,
except for those who are mak
ing a living off them, Vietna
mese in Saigon do not particu
larly care for Americans but
are waiting to see if they are
going to win. One senses that
this is still an open question,
and that no one is in a hurry to
predict the answer.
Psychological Tension
No city can completely nor
malize war. Tempers grow
short, psychological tensions
mount, and there is no place to
go. A quiet drive in the country
would be impossible even if you
had a car.
Yoir notice that the American
official getting out of his sedan
with gold bag in hand, goes into

a hotel whose entrance is sand
bagged and guarded by a GI,
like any other of the scores of
American military billets in Sai
gon.
You notice that barbed wire
surrounding the headquarters of
the Military Directory at Gia
Long Palace and the Prime Min
ister's office on Thong Nhut.
You read every once in a
while of a taxi driver wounded
by a GI sentry, alert for terror
ists, who shot too quickly when
the taxi broke down in front of
his billet.
Snow Shovel?
You notice an American car
disappearing into the big US
AID No. 1 compound on Le Van
Duyet Street. A Vietnamese
guard has just walked around
it with what looks like a snow
shovel. On closer examination, it
is a mirror, used to check for
mines which might be attached
to the underside of the car.
Between 12 and 4 in the morn
ing, the streets are quiet except

for an occasional convoy rumbl
ing through the city on its way
to a battlefield.
Night in Saigon belongs to
the police. During curfew, they
move through each of the city's
lien gia's (neighborhoods of ten
to fifteen families presided
over by a head man responsible
to the officials), and make spot
checks at different homes, called
"family roll calls," to discover
infiltrators.
