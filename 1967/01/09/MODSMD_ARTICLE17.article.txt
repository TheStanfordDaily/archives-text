Nicolao Sets Two, Too
Luis Nicolao blasted out a
1:45.4 200 freestyle, the fastest
ever for a Stanford swimmer,
and later hit a record 1:58.3 200
butterfly.
Oregon State posed no prob
lems for the Indians, who swam
an experimental lineup. The
Tribe took every first place and
all but two seconds in the 12-
event meet.
Buckingham's 100 and Nico
lao's 200 free got the meet off
on the right foot. Jeff Hammett
took the 50 free in 22.5. Dave
Duxbury won the diving com
petition with a 178.4 total.
Doug Miller threw in a 2:03.7
200 fly for a first place, and
Pete Siebert won the 200 bask
stroke in 2:03.7. Bob Momsen,
taking a break from his breast

stroke chores, hit 1:50.0 for the
200 free and 5:01.7 for the 500
free for second places.
Roth Takes 500
Dick Roth won the 500 in
4:56.0. Charlie Burbach won the
200 breaststroke in the propi
tious early-season time of 2:22.1.
Stanford took both the medley
and freestyle relays with no
problem.
Oregon presented a stronger
pig to stick, but again Stanford
coach Jim Gaughran did not put
in a full strength lineup.
Stanford took the medley re
lay in 3:41.0, highlighted by Bill
Kee's 56.7 backstroke lead-off
and Jeff Hammett's 48.9 anchor
leg. Roth won the 1000 in 10:28.3.
Mark Parmely and Morgan
Manning, who tied in the 200 IM
against OSU in 2:05.2, had an
other close race in the 200 free
against Oregon. Manning won
in 1:48.5, two tenths ahead of
Parmely. Oregon's Bob Boyer
won the 50 free in 22.3.
Buckingham then turned in
his record 200 IM with Pete Sie
bert close behind at 2:02.5. Buck
ingham later hit a 47.2 leg in
an exhibition freestyle relay.
Main Tops Divers
Oregon's divers, with previous
AAWU champion Larry Follins
bee in the lead with 229 points,
took 1-2 in the diving. Stanford
freshman Bill Main, diving ex
hibition, beat the top Duck by
30 points.
Nicolao's 1:58.3 butterfly rec
ord is only the start for the
world record holder. The NCAA
record is 1:51.7.

Momsen won the 200 breast
with a 2:20.3 effort.
Stanford did not taper off be
fore Oregon and OSU meets.
Sprint times suffered slightly as
a result. The Cards will prob
ably maintain a heavy work
schedule until the dual meets
with USC and UCLA February
17-18.
Stanford travels to meet Wash
ington and Washington State
this weekend and next swims at
Stanford January 27 against Cal
and January 28 in the Stanford
Relays.
