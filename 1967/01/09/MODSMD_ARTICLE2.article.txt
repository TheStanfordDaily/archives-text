# STERLING TELLS COUNCIL
## Trustees Discuss OFF Question 
### 
President Wallace Sterling told the
Academic Council Friday that pre
liminary discussions have already
been held with the Trustees on both
the off campus housing option for
women and open house hours. Furth
er discussions are planned soon, he
added.
Sterling also announced that Prof.
Herbert Packer of the Law School,
recently named vice-provost, would
be chairman of the executive commit
tee for the reappraisal of Stanford's
educational programs. Other mem
bers of the committee and further
details were not discussed.
In a lengthy report on Federal re
search grants, Associate Provost Hu
bert Heffner reported that Federal

support of research programs here
rose more than 20 per cent during
1965-66, but that this growth rate will
probably not be maintained during
1967.
Viet War Hurts
Late last year, the National Science
Foundation estimated federal sup
port for university research across
the country would increase by an
average of 10 per cent. President
Johnson's budget review now makes
a smaller increase "more likely,"
Huffner said.
"We'll probably fare somewhat bet
ter than the national average, but we
may be in for tougher times. If the
Vietnam conflict continues, even more

difficulty may be expected in future
years."
During academic year 1965-66, fed
eral support of research at Stanford
totalled approximately $32 million, ex
cluding the Stanford Linear Accelera
tor Center.
Over the past decade, Heffner noted,
Stanford has experienced "a rather
remarkable increase" in federal re
search funds, averaging 20 per cent
per year.
"Quite obviously, this can't go on
forever," he declared.
The increase last year was surpris
ing in view of federal policies favor
ing geographic dispersion of funds
and a slower growth rate for total
research expenditures, he said.
The rise at Stanford stems from
two factors: 1) a substantial expan
sion in faculty in recent years, which
has resulted in more research pro
posals; and 2) changes in federal
funding practices.
Short-Term Support
Instead of committing funds to a
few projects on a long-term basis,
Heffrier explained, agencies are
spreading their support across more
projects on a shorter-term basis.
Prof. Marc Franklin of the Law
jchool will succeed Packer as a mem
ber of the Academic Council Execu
tive Committee, Prof. Benjamin Page
reported. As vice provost, Packer is
no longer eligible to serve with this
group.
President Sterling also reported on
his recent meting in Hong Kong
with leaders of Asian universities. Dis
cussions there focused on the role of
universities in national development
and theri relationship with the state.
