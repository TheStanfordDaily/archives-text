# The 						Residence Survey
## 
### 
The survey of women's housing, released last
week by the Dean's Office, places many of the
contentions of the OFF campaign in perspective.
There can now be little doubt that the desire for
an off-campus option is of major interest to
Stanford women, for a majority listed off-cam
pus living as their first preference for junior
and senior year.
Tables revealing women's choice of living
option through four years showed a gradual shift
from on-campus (selected by ninety-eight per
cent of the women for their freshman year) to
off-campus (selected by fifty-two per cent for
senior living). The increasing preference for off
campus living echoes only in small degree crit
icism of social regulation and dorm restrictions.
Rather, women view the off-campus option as
part of a maturing experience, and this view
point seems to parallel the University's philos
ophy of developing increasing responsibility
among women.
While the report does indeed lend support
to the OFF campaign, the real significance of
the survey lies in its commentary upon Stan
ford's efforts to create a residential environment
in which education can flourish. The survey in
dicated that residential education is a good deal
more than empty jargon to most women. Among
the fifty-three questions was an evaluation of
the present goals of the residence system. Wom
en were asked to rate the University's stated
goals in terms of importance and, secondly in
terms of realization. Significantly, women rated
"an intellectual atmosphere conducive to high
scholastic interest and achievement" as the most
important requisite of a residence system.
However, the gap between importance and
actual realization, as measured by the women,

leaves reason for concern. The women found
the present system only partially successful in
promoting an intellectual atmosphere. Variance
between importance and realization was re
corded for thirteen of the University's fourteen
stated goals.
The survey found receptivity for innovations
in the residence experience. Over eighty per cent
believed faculty residents, long enjoyed in
men's residences, would add greatly to their
educational experience. Also receiving support
were new on-campus housing options, including
co-ed residences, apartments, and co-operatives.
Nearly two-thirds of the women said their
choice to live on- or off-campus would be
greatly affected by the existence of these addi
tional options.
The results of the survey are essential read
ing for those involved in many campus issues,
including OFF, the role of sponsors, social reg
ulations, educational refroms. But most impor
tantly, the survey ought to receive careful anal-'
ysis by the President's committee engaged in re
evaluating University curriculum. Three-fourths
of the women indicated that the residence
played a major part in their total University
experience. Thus, the role of the residence de
mands the same thorough consideration as the
classroom in evaluating Stanford's capabilities
in undergraduate education.
The gap between University goals and actual
achievement of these goals and the uncertain
place of innovation underscore the necessity
for further definition of residential education.
While particular issues may become increasingly
sensitive, we do not believe that the University
can successfully respond to any individual short
coming without clarifying its basic philosophy.

important requisite of a residence system.
However, the gap between importance and
actual realization, as measured by the women,

leaves reason for concern. The women found
the present system only partially successful in
promoting an intellectual atmosphere. Variance
between importance and realization was re
corded for thirteen of the University's fourteen
stated goals.
The survey found receptivity for innovations
in the residence experience. Over eighty per cent
believed faculty residents, long enjoyed in
men's residences, would add greatly to their
educational experience. Also receiving support
were new on-campus housing options, including
co-ed residences, apartments, and co-operatives.
Nearly two-thirds of the women said their
choice to live on- or off-campus would be
greatly affected by the existence of these addi
tional options.
The results of the survey are essential read
ing for those involved in many campus issues,
including OFF, the role of sponsors, social reg
ulations, educational refroms. But most impor
tantly, the survey ought to receive careful anal-'
ysis by the President's committee engaged in re
evaluating University curriculum. Three-fourths
of the women indicated that the residence
played a major part in their total University
experience. Thus, the role of the residence de
mands the same thorough consideration as the
classroom in evaluating Stanford's capabilities
in undergraduate education.
The gap between University goals and actual
achievement of these goals and the uncertain
place of innovation underscore the necessity
for further definition of residential education.
While particular issues may become increasingly
sensitive, we do not believe that the University
can successfully respond to any individual short
coming without clarifying its basic philosophy.
The survey of women's housing, released last
week by the Dean's Office, places many of the
contentions of the OFF campaign in perspective.
There can now be little doubt that the desire for
an off-campus option is of major interest to
Stanford women, for a majority listed off-cam
pus living as their first preference for junior
and senior year.
Tables revealing women's choice of living
option through four years showed a gradual shift
from on-campus (selected by ninety-eight per
cent of the women for their freshman year) to
off-campus (selected by fifty-two per cent for
senior living). The increasing preference for off
campus living echoes only in small degree crit
icism of social regulation and dorm restrictions.
Rather, women view the off-campus option as
part of a maturing experience, and this view
point seems to parallel the University's philos
ophy of developing increasing responsibility
among women.
While the report does indeed lend support
to the OFF campaign, the real significance of
the survey lies in its commentary upon Stan
ford's efforts to create a residential environment
in which education can flourish. The survey in
dicated that residential education is a good deal
more than empty jargon to most women. Among
the fifty-three questions was an evaluation of
the present goals of the residence system. Wom
en were asked to rate the University's stated
goals in terms of importance and, secondly in
terms of realization. Significantly, women rated
"an intellectual atmosphere conducive to high
scholastic interest and achievement" as the most
important requisite of a residence system.
