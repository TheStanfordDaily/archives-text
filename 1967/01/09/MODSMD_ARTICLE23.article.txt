## Students Organize Local 108 
### Bob Fishman 
The rent strike seems to be
the first step towards a well
organized campus.
Whether the AF of L, the CIO,
or the Teamsters will be the
first to organize us, only the Na
tional Labor Relations Board
knows for sure.

Since this university is known
as "The Farm," perhaps Caesar
Chavez should have priority.
In any event, it won't be long,
I trust, before a story like this
is datelined Stanford:
Tension is mounting on this
quiet California campus as only
twelve hours remain before the
student-administration contract
expires.
Students are demanding a
whopping across-the-board 4.8
per cent increase in their CPA's.
Administration officials main
tain that their offer of a 3.2 per
cent increase, three new commit
tees, and unlimited access to
faculty washrooms will be their
last.
J. P. Stoppem, newly-appoint
ed Dean of Student-Administra
tion .Relations, denounced stu
dent demands as "inflationary."
Dean Stoppem, formerly of U.S.
Steel, explained that "student
egos are big enough already
without inflating them further."
President Speaks
Rough, tough, cigar-chewing
Mike McGoon, president of Stu
dent Local 108, put down his
copy of Fleurs du Mai to re
ply to reporters.
"GPA has not kept pace with
a rise in College Board scores,"
he contended. "All we want is a
fair share of this university's
intellectual production."
Meanwhile, rumors are spread
ing that the Dean of Admissions

is planning to admit 1,000 trans
fer students from San Jose State
—"scabs" is the current stu
dent lingo —to fill classrooms
should the strike occur.
"Absolutely untrue," replied
the Dean. "They're all from
Chico State."
In Washington, the Undersec
retary of Health, Education and
Welfare for Student Strikes is
reportedly "deeply concerned"
over the developments at Stan
ford.
"Frankly," he said, "we could
n't care less if the English De
partment shut down for good.
It's Engineering we're worriod
about. We cannot allow another
Berkeley."
The undersecretary was refer
ring, of course, to the eight
month strike led by balding non
student Mario Savio. The strike
caused severe shortages for
scholarly journals and graduate
schools throughout the nation.
Many are still months behind
their production schedules.
On the campus, students are
already picketing administration
buildings with signs that read,
"No Contract—No Classes." But
informed sources doubt that a
strike will acutally occur. They
claim that the President of the
United States will avert the
strike by invoking his ultimate
strikebreaking weapon: compul
sory arbitration by the Educa
tional Testing Service.
