## IJB Case Report Misses The Point 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
The article on IJB decision
in the Traister case is one of
the most irresponsible pieces of
reporting I've seen in The Daily.
Either your reporter cannot read
or he was taking someone else's
word for the facts. A few correc
tions are in order.
First, Mr. Traister was not
only "accepted" but had in fact
been registered before Snring
Quarter. Thus, as any student, he
was free to reregister at any
time. Nobody knew he was com
ing back summer quarter al
though he was of course eligible
to do so. The hold on his regis
tration simply did not get pro
cessed quickly enough (for what
ever reason) to reach him until
the next time he registered, I.e.
fall quarter. Otherwise the case
would have gone to Summer
Council although, as I stated in
the hearing, I was just as happy
it didn't because the Summer
Council is unfortunately neith
er as carefully chosen nor as
well oriented and instructed as
the regular Council.
The conversation which is
mentioned in the article took
place between Mr. Traister and
a person whom he could not
identify. He thought it was one
of the Deans. At any rate the
interchange was vague enough
—consisting of a short question
and an even shorter answer—
to leave all sorts of room for
doubts and second-guessing. It
could have easily referred to
civil action, which, indeed, Alan
said he had had in mind, but
did not explicitly state.
Finally, the whole question
here is not that of trying an
unregistered student, which sim
ply cannot be done, but of trying
a registered student for an act
committed while he was unreg
istered but during the course of
his "studentship." It is simply a
matter of deciding whether a
member of the University com
munity stops being one when he
or she is not registered but is
still "participating." The line be
tween student and non-student
is not as sharp here as at the
University of California — for
which I, at least, am thankful.
The main problem in this case
was more of due process, I think,
than of actual jurisdiction. There
still remain certain items to be
clarified so as to make the mar
riage somewhat less adulterous.
After all, since one does not
have to reapply in order to re
register after withdrawing for a

while, there is no check whatso
ever on re-entering students.
Somehow it seems to me in
equitable for one student to be
punished and another not sim Dlv
because he was not registered.
Civil action does not strike me
as being desirable either. What
is needed is a set of guidelines:
a knowledge that such-an-such
wi'l happen as a consequence of
doing thus-and-so.
Ignorance should never be part
of a student's existence, and
that goes double for Daily re
porters. I'm sure the members
of IJB were surprised to learn
on what they had based their de
cision. MIMI SHERMAN

Editor, The Daily:
As the father of a Stanford
student and an educator in the
public school of Indiana for over
25 years, I am amazed at the
ideas expressed in a 1 most every
issue of The Daily. I refer to
the pet themes expressed by
David Harris and his liberal stu
dent followers and ultra-libera l
professors as the so-called "Aca
demic Freedom" and the non
cooperation with the Defense
Department.
Speaking as an observor far
enough away from the Stanford
campus to get a perspective of
what the above named individ
uals and groups do in the name
of "Academic Freedom," they
are either no more than pub
licity seekers or they are anar
chists. Furthermore, they should
be treated as such.
It has been my further obser
vation that an individual has to
learn to crawl before he learns
to walk. If Harris and his group
know all the skills that
Stanford has to offer, or at least
think they know everything they
should or should not do, I see
no reason for Harris and his
Stanford and defame its good
group to continue to attend
name.
The same group has contin
ually pressed the Stanford ad
ministration to refuse to co
operate with HUAC and the De
fense Department. If this Harris
group hadn't objected to Stan
ford sending the names of the
male students to local draft
boards, my son wouldn't have
received a draft warning no
tice. At Stanford, the students
were forced to go off campus to
take the deferment test, and
they must request the informa
tion be sent to the draft boards.
Thanks to the "Know-it-all Har
ris Group."
If I am permitted, I would
like to recommend that the ad
missions office screen more thor
oughly its future applicants to
keep out people like David Har
ris. I further recommend that
people with the morals of the
type that caused one of its fra
ternities to be closed should also
be refused admittance.

ing back summer quarter al
though he was of course eligible
to do so. The hold on his regis
tration simply did not get pro
cessed quickly enough (for what
ever reason) to reach him until
the next time he registered, I.e.
fall quarter. Otherwise the case
would have gone to Summer
Council although, as I stated in
the hearing, I was just as happy
it didn't because the Summer
Council is unfortunately neith
er as carefully chosen nor as
well oriented and instructed as
the regular Council.
The conversation which is
mentioned in the article took
place between Mr. Traister and
a person whom he could not
identify. He thought it was one
of the Deans. At any rate the
interchange was vague enough
—consisting of a short question
and an even shorter answer—
to leave all sorts of room for
doubts and second-guessing. It
could have easily referred to
civil action, which, indeed, Alan
said he had had in mind, but
did not explicitly state.
Finally, the whole question
here is not that of trying an
unregistered student, which sim
ply cannot be done, but of trying
a registered student for an act
committed while he was unreg
istered but during the course of
his "studentship." It is simply a
matter of deciding whether a
member of the University com
munity stops being one when he
or she is not registered but is
still "participating." The line be
tween student and non-student
is not as sharp here as at the
University of California — for
which I, at least, am thankful.
The main problem in this case
was more of due process, I think,
than of actual jurisdiction. There
still remain certain items to be
clarified so as to make the mar
riage somewhat less adulterous.
After all, since one does not
have to reapply in order to re
register after withdrawing for a

while, there is no check whatso
ever on re-entering students.
Somehow it seems to me in
equitable for one student to be
punished and another not sim Dlv
because he was not registered.
Civil action does not strike me
as being desirable either. What
is needed is a set of guidelines:
a knowledge that such-an-such
wi'l happen as a consequence of
doing thus-and-so.
Ignorance should never be part
of a student's existence, and
that goes double for Daily re
porters. I'm sure the members
of IJB were surprised to learn
on what they had based their de
cision. MIMI SHERMAN

As the father of a Stanford
student and an educator in the
public school of Indiana for over
25 years, I am amazed at the
ideas expressed in a 1 most every
issue of The Daily. I refer to
the pet themes expressed by
David Harris and his liberal stu
dent followers and ultra-libera l
professors as the so-called "Aca
demic Freedom" and the non
cooperation with the Defense
Department.
Speaking as an observor far
enough away from the Stanford
campus to get a perspective of
what the above named individ
uals and groups do in the name
of "Academic Freedom," they
are either no more than pub
licity seekers or they are anar
chists. Furthermore, they should
be treated as such.
It has been my further obser
vation that an individual has to
learn to crawl before he learns
to walk. If Harris and his group
know all the skills that
Stanford has to offer, or at least
think they know everything they
should or should not do, I see
no reason for Harris and his
Stanford and defame its good
group to continue to attend
name.
The same group has contin
ually pressed the Stanford ad
ministration to refuse to co
operate with HUAC and the De
fense Department. If this Harris
group hadn't objected to Stan
ford sending the names of the
male students to local draft
boards, my son wouldn't have
received a draft warning no
tice. At Stanford, the students
were forced to go off campus to
take the deferment test, and
they must request the informa
tion be sent to the draft boards.
Thanks to the "Know-it-all Har
ris Group."
If I am permitted, I would
like to recommend that the ad
missions office screen more thor
oughly its future applicants to
keep out people like David Har
ris. I further recommend that
people with the morals of the
type that caused one of its fra
ternities to be closed should also
be refused admittance.

The article on IJB decision

mentioned in the article took
place between Mr. Traister and
a person whom he could not
identify. He thought it was one
of the Deans. At any rate the
interchange was vague enough
—consisting of a short question
and an even shorter answer—
to leave all sorts of room for
doubts and second-guessing. It
could have easily referred to
civil action, which, indeed, Alan
said he had had in mind, but
did not explicitly state.
Finally, the whole question
here is not that of trying an
unregistered student, which sim
ply cannot be done, but of trying
a registered student for an act
committed while he was unreg
istered but during the course of
his "studentship." It is simply a
matter of deciding whether a
member of the University com
munity stops being one when he
or she is not registered but is
still "participating." The line be
tween student and non-student
is not as sharp here as at the
University of California — for
which I, at least, am thankful.
The main problem in this case
was more of due process, I think,
than of actual jurisdiction. There
still remain certain items to be
clarified so as to make the mar
riage somewhat less adulterous.
After all, since one does not
have to reapply in order to re
register after withdrawing for a

while, there is no check whatso
ever on re-entering students.
Somehow it seems to me in
equitable for one student to be
punished and another not sim Dlv
because he was not registered.
Civil action does not strike me
as being desirable either. What
is needed is a set of guidelines:
a knowledge that such-an-such
wi'l happen as a consequence of
doing thus-and-so.
Ignorance should never be part
of a student's existence, and
that goes double for Daily re
porters. I'm sure the members
of IJB were surprised to learn
on what they had based their de
cision. MIMI SHERMAN

Editor, The Daily:
As the father of a Stanford
student and an educator in the
public school of Indiana for over
25 years, I am amazed at the
ideas expressed in a 1 most every
issue of The Daily. I refer to
the pet themes expressed by
David Harris and his liberal stu
dent followers and ultra-libera l
professors as the so-called "Aca
demic Freedom" and the non
cooperation with the Defense
Department.
Speaking as an observor far
enough away from the Stanford
campus to get a perspective of
what the above named individ
uals and groups do in the name
of "Academic Freedom," they
are either no more than pub
licity seekers or they are anar
chists. Furthermore, they should
be treated as such.
It has been my further obser
vation that an individual has to
learn to crawl before he learns
to walk. If Harris and his group
know all the skills that
Stanford has to offer, or at least
think they know everything they
should or should not do, I see
no reason for Harris and his
Stanford and defame its good
group to continue to attend
name.
The same group has contin
ually pressed the Stanford ad
ministration to refuse to co
operate with HUAC and the De
fense Department. If this Harris
group hadn't objected to Stan
ford sending the names of the
male students to local draft
boards, my son wouldn't have
received a draft warning no
tice. At Stanford, the students
were forced to go off campus to
take the deferment test, and
they must request the informa
tion be sent to the draft boards.
Thanks to the "Know-it-all Har
ris Group."
If I am permitted, I would
like to recommend that the ad
missions office screen more thor
oughly its future applicants to
keep out people like David Har
ris. I further recommend that
people with the morals of the
type that caused one of its fra
ternities to be closed should also
be refused admittance.

The article on IJB decision
in the Traister case is one of
the most irresponsible pieces of
reporting I've seen in The Daily.
Either your reporter cannot read
or he was taking someone else's
word for the facts. A few correc
tions are in order.
First, Mr. Traister was not
only "accepted" but had in fact
been registered before Snring
Quarter. Thus, as any student, he
was free to reregister at any
time. Nobody knew he was com
ing back summer quarter al
though he was of course eligible
to do so. The hold on his regis
tration simply did not get pro
cessed quickly enough (for what
ever reason) to reach him until
the next time he registered, I.e.
fall quarter. Otherwise the case
would have gone to Summer
Council although, as I stated in
the hearing, I was just as happy
it didn't because the Summer
Council is unfortunately neith
er as carefully chosen nor as
well oriented and instructed as
the regular Council.
