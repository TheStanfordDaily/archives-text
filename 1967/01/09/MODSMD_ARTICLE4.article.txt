# Repeal Of Loyalty Pledge Too Late For SU Student
## 
### CHRIS HARTE 
A Stanford student who lost the op
portunity to study overseas because
he refused to sign the two loyalty
oaths on his passport application yes
terday hailed the State Department
announcement that neither oath Is
now necessary.
Jeff Shurtleff, then a sophomore,
was unable to attend Stanford in
Gerrmany winter and spring quarters
of 1964 because he felt that no gov
ernment had the right to restrict
travel by its citizens and refused to
sign either oath.
One oath, which the State Depart
ment announced last Thursday it did
not have the legal authority to re
quire, stated "I do solemnly swear
that I will support and defend the
Constitution of the United States
against all enemies, foreign and do
mestic; that I will bear true faith and
allegiance to the same; and that I
take this obligation freely, without
any mental reservation, or purpose of
evasion; so help me God."
No Total Allegiance
Shurtleff sees no reason why any
citizen should be asked to swear total
allegiance to any document. For him,
it was and is impossible to sign the
oath "given a very clear picture of
what is being done, such as in the
South and in Vietnam, which is sup
posedly in accordance with that Con
stitution."

The other, requiring the passport
applicant to swear he had not been a
member of any group required to
register with the Attorney General's
office under the Subversive Activities
Control Act, was repealed following
an American Civil Liberties Union
case later that same year. Shurtleff
says at the time he was asked to sign,
the list included such groups as Wom
en for Peace, other old peace groups,
and some of the Marxist groups which
had sprung up following World War
n.
It was understood that passport
director Frances G. Knight, who has
been at odds with her State Depart
ment superiors on a number of other
issues strongly opposed a move to
drop the oath from the application
forms.
Express Obligation
Miss Knight was reported to have
favored continuing the oath as a
means of allowing citizens, particu
larly overseas, to express their obliga
tion to their country.
Under the new procedures, officials
said passport applicants need only to
sign the application form after filling
it out. This would include the oath of
allegiance unless they specifically ob
ject, in which case the administering
officer is to cross out this item in the
application form.
