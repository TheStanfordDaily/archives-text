# Academic Senate Warns Of Outside Interference As Reagan Takes Office
## 
### BOB DAVIS 
Thousands of students at the Uni
versity of California in Berkeley were
wearing lapel buttons reading "Chick
en Little Was Right" late last week
against the background of a wave of
political events which some feared
would eventually ignite new campus
turmoil.
In the wake of Ronald Reagan's in
auguration as governor of California,
the policy committee of the Academic
Senate at Berkeley warned students
to avoid any activities which might
invite "destructive intervention from
the outside."
From the Capitol steps in Sacra
mento on Thursday, Gov. Reagan
promised a severe attitude toward re
bellions.
Reagan insisted it is not "a viola
tion of individual rights to require
obedience to rules and regulations

or to insist that those unwilling to
abide by them should get their edu
cation elsewhere."
A crowd estimated at about 10,000
cheered when Reagan told them that
the taxpayers have a right to expect
professors, in addition to teaching, to
"build character on accepted moral
and ethical standards."
At a closed meeting earlier in the
week between representatives of the
state university and colleges, Reagan
and his finance director proposed a
ten per cent cut from the 1967-68
operating budgets already approved
by the UC Board of Regents and state
college trustees. The cut would
amount to about $35 million.
Reagan also reportedly requested
a $400 annual tuition on all UC cam
puses. This would be in addition to
the approximately $242 in various fees
that students now pay.

One of the Governor's aides in
sisted that no final decision has been
made to take the measures to the
legislature.
Utmost Restraint* Urged
In addition to warning students
against rash action, the report urges
administrators to act with "the utmost
restraint."
The committee observes that many
students seem convinced the faculty
and administrative officers are in
sensitive to student views unless they
are backed by the threat of rule vio
lations or disruptive actions.
"We may be nearing the last mo
ment" in which the move for outside
intervention can be halted, the report
says.
The committee asked for the ap
pointment of a joint faculty-student
commission of five each to investi
gate the conditions which inspire
crisis and confrontation.
The report also urges the various
departments on campus to increase
student participation in educational
affairs.
The UC Board of Regents has called
an emergency meeting at UCLA to
night to consider the potential budget
crisis. Governor Reagan is not ex
pected to attend. His finance director,
Gordon P. Smith, plans to represent
him.
Theodore Meyer, president of the
Board of Regents, telephoned UC Pres
ident Clark Kerr in Hong Kong and
informed him of the planned meeting.
Kerr, in the Far East on a consul
tive assignment, returned to Berke
ley Saturday, cutting his trip short.
He denied that, he plans to resign.
Kerr also said he knows nothing
about reports that he would be fired.
Legislative Control
In another action seemed destined
to stir controversy, Assemblyman Carl
A. Britschgi, a Republican from Red
wood City, introduced a measure
Wednesday which would take control
of the University of California from
the Regents and give it to the legis
lature.
Britschgi would cut terms for the
Regents from sixteen to four years.
He said last Wednesday that the Re
gents "couldn't care less about what
the legislature or the people are
thinking."
He made it clear that his action was
prompted by campus turmoil of the
last two years.
Britschgi said he had not discussed
his proposal with Governor Reagan
or anyone on his staff.

Wednesday which would take control
of the University of California from
the Regents and give it to the legis
lature.
Britschgi would cut terms for the
Regents from sixteen to four years.
He said last Wednesday that the Re
gents "couldn't care less about what
the legislature or the people are
thinking."
He made it clear that his action was
prompted by campus turmoil of the
last two years.
Britschgi said he had not discussed
his proposal with Governor Reagan
or anyone on his staff.
Thousands of students at the Uni
versity of California in Berkeley were
wearing lapel buttons reading "Chick
en Little Was Right" late last week
against the background of a wave of
political events which some feared
would eventually ignite new campus
turmoil.
In the wake of Ronald Reagan's in
auguration as governor of California,
the policy committee of the Academic
Senate at Berkeley warned students
to avoid any activities which might
invite "destructive intervention from
the outside."
From the Capitol steps in Sacra
mento on Thursday, Gov. Reagan
promised a severe attitude toward re
bellions.
Reagan insisted it is not "a viola
tion of individual rights to require
obedience to rules and regulations

or to insist that those unwilling to
abide by them should get their edu
cation elsewhere."
A crowd estimated at about 10,000
cheered when Reagan told them that
the taxpayers have a right to expect
professors, in addition to teaching, to
"build character on accepted moral
and ethical standards."
At a closed meeting earlier in the
week between representatives of the
state university and colleges, Reagan
and his finance director proposed a
ten per cent cut from the 1967-68
operating budgets already approved
by the UC Board of Regents and state
college trustees. The cut would
amount to about $35 million.
Reagan also reportedly requested
a $400 annual tuition on all UC cam
puses. This would be in addition to
the approximately $242 in various fees
that students now pay.

One of the Governor's aides in
sisted that no final decision has been
made to take the measures to the
legislature.
Utmost Restraint* Urged
In addition to warning students
against rash action, the report urges
administrators to act with "the utmost
restraint."
The committee observes that many
students seem convinced the faculty
and administrative officers are in
sensitive to student views unless they
are backed by the threat of rule vio
lations or disruptive actions.
"We may be nearing the last mo
ment" in which the move for outside
intervention can be halted, the report
says.
The committee asked for the ap
pointment of a joint faculty-student
commission of five each to investi
gate the conditions which inspire
crisis and confrontation.
The report also urges the various
departments on campus to increase
student participation in educational
affairs.
The UC Board of Regents has called
an emergency meeting at UCLA to
night to consider the potential budget
crisis. Governor Reagan is not ex
pected to attend. His finance director,
Gordon P. Smith, plans to represent
him.
Theodore Meyer, president of the
Board of Regents, telephoned UC Pres
ident Clark Kerr in Hong Kong and
informed him of the planned meeting.
Kerr, in the Far East on a consul
tive assignment, returned to Berke
ley Saturday, cutting his trip short.
He denied that, he plans to resign.
Kerr also said he knows nothing
about reports that he would be fired.
Legislative Control
In another action seemed destined
to stir controversy, Assemblyman Carl
A. Britschgi, a Republican from Red
wood City, introduced a measure
Wednesday which would take control
of the University of California from
the Regents and give it to the legis
