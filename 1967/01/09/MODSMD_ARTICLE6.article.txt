Three Stanford men learned Fri
day that the FBI is a pretty serious
bunch of cops.
Harold Cranston, Richard Wallin,
and Michael Ferrari walked Into
the Bank of America branch at the
Stanford Shopping Center at about
1:30 and Wallin cashed a check.
While the three were waiting,
Cranston took a deposit slip and
wrote on the back, "This is a hold
up. Don't panic. Don't be alarmed.
Give me the money. Thank you."
He showed the note to Wallin
and Ferrari, and all three had a
good laugh, according to Ferrari.
Cranston then took the note and
handed it to a woman standing
behind the counter and asked her
to throw it away. Ferrari told The
Daily that she looked at the note
and laughed. Everybody seemed to
think it was funny as the three
some left the bank.
Except the FBI, of course.
Two FBI agents and a Palo Alto
detective were waiting for the
students when they returned to
the Alpha Tau Omega house at
about 5 p.m. "They had been walt-

Ing for us for two hours," Fer
rari said.
The FBI took them out to their
car, one by one, and pave each a
stern lecture. "They even had the
holdup note wrapped in cellophane
to protect it from fingerprints,"
Ferrari commented.
The students were told they
should call the U.S. Assistant At
torney General today to find out if
any action would be taken against
them.
But a story in Saturday's Palo
Alto Times revealed that Jerold
H. Lader, the Assistant Attorney
General, would not press charges.
Lader instead turned the case over
to Stanford's Dean of Students.
The Palo Alto Times article
stated that the threesome had
"passed a teller a note stating
they were holding up the bank."
Ferrari said that they did not hand
the note to a teller, but asked an
other woman to throw it away.
Dean Winbigler said that he was
called by one of Lader's represen
tatives Saturday and the case was
turned over to the University. The
fate of the three students will be
decided by the Judicial Council,
according to Winbigler.

students when they returned to
the Alpha Tau Omega house at
about 5 p.m. "They had been walt-

Ing for us for two hours," Fer
rari said.
The FBI took them out to their
car, one by one, and pave each a
stern lecture. "They even had the
holdup note wrapped in cellophane
to protect it from fingerprints,"
Ferrari commented.
The students were told they
should call the U.S. Assistant At
torney General today to find out if
any action would be taken against
them.
But a story in Saturday's Palo
Alto Times revealed that Jerold
H. Lader, the Assistant Attorney
General, would not press charges.
Lader instead turned the case over
to Stanford's Dean of Students.
The Palo Alto Times article
stated that the threesome had
"passed a teller a note stating
they were holding up the bank."
Ferrari said that they did not hand
the note to a teller, but asked an
other woman to throw it away.
Dean Winbigler said that he was
called by one of Lader's represen
tatives Saturday and the case was
turned over to the University. The
fate of the three students will be
decided by the Judicial Council,
according to Winbigler.
Three Stanford men learned Fri
day that the FBI is a pretty serious
bunch of cops.
Harold Cranston, Richard Wallin,
and Michael Ferrari walked Into
the Bank of America branch at the
Stanford Shopping Center at about
1:30 and Wallin cashed a check.
While the three were waiting,
Cranston took a deposit slip and
wrote on the back, "This is a hold
up. Don't panic. Don't be alarmed.
Give me the money. Thank you."
He showed the note to Wallin
and Ferrari, and all three had a
good laugh, according to Ferrari.
Cranston then took the note and
handed it to a woman standing
behind the counter and asked her
to throw it away. Ferrari told The
Daily that she looked at the note
and laughed. Everybody seemed to
think it was funny as the three
some left the bank.
Except the FBI, of course.
Two FBI agents and a Palo Alto
detective were waiting for the
students when they returned to
the Alpha Tau Omega house at
about 5 p.m. "They had been walt-

Ing for us for two hours," Fer
rari said.
