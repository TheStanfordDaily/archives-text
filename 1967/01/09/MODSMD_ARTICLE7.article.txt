# Frats, Roble Enlist Professors, Introduce Living Group Seminars
## 
### CHRIS KIRBY 
Campus living groups are today con
ducting seminars of their own design
with professors of their choice, thanks
to a Committee on Undergraduate
Education recommendation last
spring.
The first groups to take advantage
of these "Undergraduate Special Sem
inars" are three fraternities and Roble
Hall. Members of the various groups
decided on something that interested
them generally, then enlisted the aid
of an agreed upon professor to further
define and teach the subject.
Professor Thomas K. Landauer is
teaching a seminar on "The Psychol
ogy of Fraternity Living" at the Kappa
Alpha House for one unit. "Fraterni
ties," Landauer said, "will be used as a
case of social behavior to illustrate a
wide variety of psychological prin
ciples governing the formation, func
tion, and influence of an interacting
group of people on its members."

Readings will be based on those prin
ciples and relevant findings.
No Mickey-Mouse
Landauer was quick to point out
that this was a "serious intellectual ef
fort and not a mickey-mouse course."
Alpha Tau Omega has gotten Pro
fessor James T. Watkins to teach
"Mystics and Mysticism." Watkins has
found that those who take the course
because it really interests them, rather
than just because it fulfills the require
ment of a colloquium, are very en
thused about it.
"Essentially," said Watkins, "it's a
course in directed readings of the
writings of mystics in the Christian
tradition.' 'He intends to restore "re
spectability in Christian mysticism."
Each student will study and play the
role of "one mystic of his choice,"
actually trying to live that role.
Professor Arthur Hastings of the
Speech and Drama department is
working with Theta Chi on a seminar

titled "Activism" and with Roble on
a seminar titled "Mysticism."
Student Activism
Hastings is especially interested in
student reaction to activism, how they
feel about it in differing fields such as
religion and politics, and thus what
role activism plays in their lives. He
wants to learn "what activism means
to everyone" and what people feel
"they'll get from being either for or
against activism."
Of the three professors, Watkins
was perhaps the most voluble as to
why he has agreed to teach the course
in addition to his regular classes and
seminars. He pointed out that in in
dustry production goes up when work
ing conditions change, regardless of
what the change is, because the work
ers feel they are getting special atten
tion. With this experiment on in-group
learning, Watkins feels the same thing
may well happen: academic "produc
tion" will go up.
