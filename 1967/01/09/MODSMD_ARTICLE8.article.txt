# SOCIOLOGY OF ACTIVISM
## Activists' Families Usually Affluent, Permissive 
### DAVID L. AIKEN The Collegiate Press Service 
CHICAGO (CPS)—Students most
likely to be active in student pro
tests are those whose parents raised
them permissively, and who have
the affluence to ignore conven
tional worries about jobs and sta
tus, according to a recent study
by a University of Chicago so
ciologist.
In a study of "the roots of stu
dent protest," Richard Flacks, as
sistant professor of sociology,
writes, "It seems plausible that this
is the first generation in which a
substantial number of youth have
both the impulse to free themselves
from conventional status concerns
and can afford to do so."
Flacks proposed as a hypothesis
that students today are active In
protest because:
• They find student life highly

"rationalized," which is related to
impersonality and competitiveness.
• They have been reared in per
missive, democratic families, which
place high values on standards
other than high status and achieve
ment.
• These values make it more
difficult for students to submit to
adult authority, respect status dis
tinctions ,and accept the prevailing
rationalized, competitive system.
• Since they are "not oriented to
the (prevailing) norms of achieve
ment," they feel less need to ac
cept conformity to "get ahead."
Moreover, they can afford to be
non-conformists — "affluence has
freed them, at least for a period of
time, from some of the anxieties
and preoccupations which have
been the defining features of Amer
ican middle-class social character."
• They spend a long period in a

university environment which, with
a series of events around 1960 in
cluding Southern sit-ins and the
demonstrations against HUAC, has
changed from an atmosphere of
"cool" non-commitment to concern
with direct action. "A full under
standing of the dynamics of the
movement requires a 'collective be
havior' approach," Flacks com
ments.
• Finally, the formerly disorga
nized "bohemian" forms of deviance
have become translated, through
the liberal-minded parents ,into a
"developing cultural tradition" into
which the activist students are so
cialized. A second generation of
radicals is reaching adulthood, born
of the radicals of the thirties,
Flacks pointed out.
Attempting to discover why the
current crop of college students has
developed such a strong protest

movement, while students of the
fifties were noted for apathy,
Flacks organized a study of the
family backgrounds, political be
liefs, and values of students active
in such movements.
In one part of his research, he
sent a crew of interviewers to talk
with parents of students who live
in the Chicago area who were listed
as participating in national protest
groups, such as SDS, SNCC, or
peace groups. The students attend
ed 26 different colleges around
the country.
Parents were asked about their
own political attitudes, what kinds
of values they held most strongly,
and how they had raised their chil
dren. The students themselves were
also asked for their views on their
parents.
A group of "non-activists" sim
ilar in such factors as economic

status to the activists was also
interviewed as a control.
For a second study, Flacks seized
the opportunity offered by the
spring sit-in at UC's administration
building. Students from his course
in Collective Behavior interviewed
65 of those who had sat in; 35 of
those who had signed a petition op
posing the sit-in; and all students
living on one floor of Pierce Tower
and one floor of New Dorms.
According to Flacks, the most
striking of these studies are:
• Student activists differ in terms
of values and attitudes from non
activists to a high degree.
He attributes the uniformity
among activists to the effects of a
subculture reflecting their shared
perspectives, not simply to "com
mon personality traits or , social
origins."
• Parents of activists also "de

viate from 'conventional middle
class' values and attitudes," to a
marked degree.
• The difference of values be
tween students can be directly
traced to different values of their
parents, Flacks believes. He con
tradicts "a frequently expressed
stereotype of activist students as
'rebels' against parental authority."
• Activists are not ideologues.
While they are "militant, commit
ted, and 'radical' with respect to
particular issues, they are not com
mitted to overarching ideological
positions."
In demographic terms, Flacks
found that activists are likely to be
from high-income, well-educated,
professional families from urban
areas. Activists are also dispropor
tionately Jewish, and tend to come
from recent immigrant stock, his
study found.

According to Flacks, the most
striking of these studies are:
• Student activists differ in terms
of values and attitudes from non
activists to a high degree.
He attributes the uniformity
among activists to the effects of a
subculture reflecting their shared
perspectives, not simply to "com
mon personality traits or , social
origins."
• Parents of activists also "de

viate from 'conventional middle
class' values and attitudes," to a
marked degree.
• The difference of values be
tween students can be directly
traced to different values of their
parents, Flacks believes. He con
tradicts "a frequently expressed
stereotype of activist students as
'rebels' against parental authority."
• Activists are not ideologues.
While they are "militant, commit
ted, and 'radical' with respect to
particular issues, they are not com
mitted to overarching ideological
positions."
In demographic terms, Flacks
found that activists are likely to be
from high-income, well-educated,
professional families from urban
areas. Activists are also dispropor
tionately Jewish, and tend to come
from recent immigrant stock, his
study found.
CHICAGO (CPS)—Students most
likely to be active in student pro
tests are those whose parents raised
them permissively, and who have
the affluence to ignore conven
tional worries about jobs and sta
tus, according to a recent study
by a University of Chicago so
ciologist.
In a study of "the roots of stu
dent protest," Richard Flacks, as
sistant professor of sociology,
writes, "It seems plausible that this
is the first generation in which a
substantial number of youth have
both the impulse to free themselves
from conventional status concerns
and can afford to do so."
Flacks proposed as a hypothesis
that students today are active In
protest because:
• They find student life highly

"rationalized," which is related to
impersonality and competitiveness.
• They have been reared in per
missive, democratic families, which
place high values on standards
other than high status and achieve
ment.
• These values make it more
difficult for students to submit to
adult authority, respect status dis
tinctions ,and accept the prevailing
rationalized, competitive system.
• Since they are "not oriented to
the (prevailing) norms of achieve
ment," they feel less need to ac
cept conformity to "get ahead."
Moreover, they can afford to be
non-conformists — "affluence has
freed them, at least for a period of
time, from some of the anxieties
and preoccupations which have
been the defining features of Amer
ican middle-class social character."
• They spend a long period in a

university environment which, with
a series of events around 1960 in
cluding Southern sit-ins and the
demonstrations against HUAC, has
changed from an atmosphere of
"cool" non-commitment to concern
with direct action. "A full under
standing of the dynamics of the
movement requires a 'collective be
havior' approach," Flacks com
ments.
• Finally, the formerly disorga
nized "bohemian" forms of deviance
have become translated, through
the liberal-minded parents ,into a
"developing cultural tradition" into
which the activist students are so
cialized. A second generation of
radicals is reaching adulthood, born
of the radicals of the thirties,
Flacks pointed out.
Attempting to discover why the
current crop of college students has
developed such a strong protest

movement, while students of the
fifties were noted for apathy,
Flacks organized a study of the
family backgrounds, political be
liefs, and values of students active
in such movements.
In one part of his research, he
sent a crew of interviewers to talk
with parents of students who live
in the Chicago area who were listed
as participating in national protest
groups, such as SDS, SNCC, or
peace groups. The students attend
ed 26 different colleges around
the country.
Parents were asked about their
own political attitudes, what kinds
of values they held most strongly,
and how they had raised their chil
dren. The students themselves were
also asked for their views on their
parents.
A group of "non-activists" sim
ilar in such factors as economic

status to the activists was also
interviewed as a control.
For a second study, Flacks seized
the opportunity offered by the
spring sit-in at UC's administration
building. Students from his course
in Collective Behavior interviewed
65 of those who had sat in; 35 of
those who had signed a petition op
posing the sit-in; and all students
living on one floor of Pierce Tower
and one floor of New Dorms.

liefs, and values of students active
in such movements.
In one part of his research, he
sent a crew of interviewers to talk
with parents of students who live
in the Chicago area who were listed
as participating in national protest
groups, such as SDS, SNCC, or
peace groups. The students attend
ed 26 different colleges around
the country.
Parents were asked about their
own political attitudes, what kinds
of values they held most strongly,
and how they had raised their chil
dren. The students themselves were
also asked for their views on their
parents.
A group of "non-activists" sim
ilar in such factors as economic

status to the activists was also
interviewed as a control.
For a second study, Flacks seized
the opportunity offered by the
spring sit-in at UC's administration
building. Students from his course
in Collective Behavior interviewed
65 of those who had sat in; 35 of
those who had signed a petition op
posing the sit-in; and all students
living on one floor of Pierce Tower
and one floor of New Dorms.
According to Flacks, the most
striking of these studies are:
• Student activists differ in terms
of values and attitudes from non
activists to a high degree.
He attributes the uniformity
among activists to the effects of a
subculture reflecting their shared
perspectives, not simply to "com
mon personality traits or , social
origins."
• Parents of activists also "de

viate from 'conventional middle
class' values and attitudes," to a
marked degree.
• The difference of values be
tween students can be directly
traced to different values of their
parents, Flacks believes. He con
tradicts "a frequently expressed
stereotype of activist students as
'rebels' against parental authority."
• Activists are not ideologues.
While they are "militant, commit
ted, and 'radical' with respect to
particular issues, they are not com
mitted to overarching ideological
positions."
In demographic terms, Flacks
found that activists are likely to be
from high-income, well-educated,
professional families from urban
areas. Activists are also dispropor
tionately Jewish, and tend to come
from recent immigrant stock, his
study found.
CHICAGO (CPS)—Students most
likely to be active in student pro
tests are those whose parents raised
them permissively, and who have
the affluence to ignore conven
tional worries about jobs and sta
tus, according to a recent study
by a University of Chicago so
ciologist.
In a study of "the roots of stu
dent protest," Richard Flacks, as
sistant professor of sociology,
writes, "It seems plausible that this
is the first generation in which a
substantial number of youth have
both the impulse to free themselves
from conventional status concerns
and can afford to do so."
Flacks proposed as a hypothesis
that students today are active In
protest because:
• They find student life highly

"rationalized," which is related to
impersonality and competitiveness.
• They have been reared in per
missive, democratic families, which
place high values on standards
other than high status and achieve
ment.
• These values make it more
difficult for students to submit to
adult authority, respect status dis
tinctions ,and accept the prevailing
rationalized, competitive system.
• Since they are "not oriented to
the (prevailing) norms of achieve
ment," they feel less need to ac
cept conformity to "get ahead."
Moreover, they can afford to be
non-conformists — "affluence has
freed them, at least for a period of
time, from some of the anxieties
and preoccupations which have
been the defining features of Amer
ican middle-class social character."
• They spend a long period in a

university environment which, with
a series of events around 1960 in
cluding Southern sit-ins and the
demonstrations against HUAC, has
changed from an atmosphere of
"cool" non-commitment to concern
with direct action. "A full under
standing of the dynamics of the
movement requires a 'collective be
havior' approach," Flacks com
ments.
• Finally, the formerly disorga
nized "bohemian" forms of deviance
have become translated, through
the liberal-minded parents ,into a
"developing cultural tradition" into
which the activist students are so
cialized. A second generation of
radicals is reaching adulthood, born
of the radicals of the thirties,
Flacks pointed out.
