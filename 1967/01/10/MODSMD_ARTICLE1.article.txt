# Professors Support Viet War Protestors

### 
Several Stanford faculty members
have signed a statement asking that
the students who participated in the
recent anti-military demonstration at
Berkeley not be subjected to "re
prisals."
The statement also says the instruc
tors were "distressed" that the ad
ministration at the University of Cal
ifornia at Berkeley had chosen to call
the police "in a situation which could
not conceivably be described as one
of extreme emergency." The instruc
tors said that they believed that "in
tellectual independence and freedom
of political action and association are
essential attributes of a University
conceived in the public interest."
Among the instructors who signed
the statement were Gerald Ackerman,
Art History; Bart Bernstein, History;
Felix Block, Physics; Charles Drek
meier, Political Science; and John
Felstiner, English. Donald Kennedy,
Biology; Robert Polhemus, English;
Paul Seaver, History; Joseph Sneed,
Philosophy; Charles Stein, Statistics,
and 28 others also signed.
The instructors went on to say that
they hoped that any proceedings
against the students and teaching as
sistants who were not arrested at
Berkeley would follow due process.
The defendents, the statement said,
should be "accorded the same consti
tutional privileges that are enjoyed
by citizens in courts of law."
The Stanford faculty members also
expressed the hope that the Univer
sity of California administration
try to secure leniency for those who
were arrested by the police in the in
cident.
Agreeing with the statement by
Berkeley Chancellor Robert Heyns
that students should have an increased
say in matter affecting their educa
tion, the instructors wrote that this
idea "is not a new one, and its im
plementation is long overdue." Student
government, the Stanford faculty
members wrote, should be strength
ened because it seemed to them that

campus disturbances would probably
continue to occur indefinitely "until
students share significantly in the
power of governing campus life."
