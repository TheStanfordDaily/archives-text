## 90th Congress To 'Cool It' 
### JAMES MARLOW Associated Press News Analyst 
WASHINGTON (AP) — If
somebody had said "cool it" this
time two years ago—meaning
go easy on new, big programs
in Congress — he would have
been laughed at.
That was a time of vast en
thusiasm for fresh beginnings
and catching up with the clock.
But things look pretty cool now.
When the 89th Congress as
sembled at this time in 1965 it
was a go-go group, still steamed
up from the 1964 elections which
gave the Democrats huge ma
jorities in both houses.
All it needed was a sense of
direction from President John
son. And he gave it that in a
hurry. He was still bouncy from
his victory over Barry Gold
water the previous fall.
He soon had Congress going
in all directions.
As he unrolled his "Great So
ciety" programs, Congress gob

bled them up, producing one of
the most remarkable jobs in
American legislative history, so
much so that some of those pro
grams haven't been digested yet.
But by this time Congress
came back for its second and
final session in 1966 the early
enthusiasm had begun to wear
thin. The 89th's performance
last year, for sheer production,
wasn't a patch on that of 1965.
And this year the new 90th
Congress, with fewer Democrats
and more Republicans, the re
sult of the 1966 elections, prob
ably will be even much cooler
than the last half of the 89th.
The reasons are obvious
enough.
In the first place, Congress
can't make every year a record
breaker, although it could do far
more than it is likely to this
year.
And, as the country got deeper
into the Vietnamese war, with
the expense of it going up, there
was less money for big pro
grams. And, as the country grew
increasingly uneasy about the
war, criticism of the Johnson ad
ministration's role in it in
creased in and out of Congress.
All these things were factors
in Congress' diminishing en
thusiasm and activity last year
and should be even more so in
1967. In addition, Johnson's in
fluence on Congress diminished
as his popularity went down.
Instead of being creative, this
new Congress seems destined to
be more critical. For example, a
Senate committee will soon be
gin an examination of America's
part in the war.
The Senate Democratic lead

er, Mike Mansfield, has proposed
a major re-examination by the
Senate of "Great Society" pro
grams and other controversial
laws and issues, like the draft,
income tax and foreign aid.
Mansfield said it is time for
the Senate to "stop, look and
listen." The more the Senate
goes prowling around the laws,
the programs, and the govern
ment in general, the less time
it will have for new legisla
tion.
In his State of the Union mes
sage to Congress tonight John
son will explain pretty much
what he has in mind to be done
in 1967. For size it is not ex

pected to be in the same league
with what he proposed in 1965.
One thing seems likely to get
approval: that's Johnson's recent
calls for better benefits under
the Social Security program, like
increasing old age payments.
Money—or, rather, how to save
it—will be a main theme this
year, which means cutting ex
penses, perhaps cutting pro
grams, as Congress tries to cope
with rising war expenses.
That means a choice between
guns and butter. In this kind of
situation Congress will certainly
prefer spending money on guns
to dishing out butter, or at least
bigger gobs of butter.

And this year the new 90th
Congress, with fewer Democrats
and more Republicans, the re
sult of the 1966 elections, prob
ably will be even much cooler
than the last half of the 89th.
The reasons are obvious
enough.
In the first place, Congress
can't make every year a record
breaker, although it could do far
more than it is likely to this
year.
And, as the country got deeper
into the Vietnamese war, with
the expense of it going up, there
was less money for big pro
grams. And, as the country grew
increasingly uneasy about the
war, criticism of the Johnson ad
ministration's role in it in
creased in and out of Congress.
All these things were factors
in Congress' diminishing en
thusiasm and activity last year
and should be even more so in
1967. In addition, Johnson's in
fluence on Congress diminished
as his popularity went down.
Instead of being creative, this
new Congress seems destined to
be more critical. For example, a
Senate committee will soon be
gin an examination of America's
part in the war.
The Senate Democratic lead

er, Mike Mansfield, has proposed
a major re-examination by the
Senate of "Great Society" pro
grams and other controversial
laws and issues, like the draft,
income tax and foreign aid.
Mansfield said it is time for
the Senate to "stop, look and
listen." The more the Senate
goes prowling around the laws,
the programs, and the govern
ment in general, the less time
it will have for new legisla
tion.
In his State of the Union mes
sage to Congress tonight John
son will explain pretty much
what he has in mind to be done
in 1967. For size it is not ex

pected to be in the same league
with what he proposed in 1965.
One thing seems likely to get
approval: that's Johnson's recent
calls for better benefits under
the Social Security program, like
increasing old age payments.
Money—or, rather, how to save
it—will be a main theme this
year, which means cutting ex
penses, perhaps cutting pro
grams, as Congress tries to cope
with rising war expenses.
That means a choice between
guns and butter. In this kind of
situation Congress will certainly
prefer spending money on guns
to dishing out butter, or at least
bigger gobs of butter.
WASHINGTON (AP) — If
somebody had said "cool it" this
time two years ago—meaning
go easy on new, big programs
in Congress — he would have
been laughed at.
That was a time of vast en
thusiasm for fresh beginnings
and catching up with the clock.
But things look pretty cool now.
When the 89th Congress as
sembled at this time in 1965 it
was a go-go group, still steamed
up from the 1964 elections which
gave the Democrats huge ma
jorities in both houses.
All it needed was a sense of
direction from President John
son. And he gave it that in a
hurry. He was still bouncy from
his victory over Barry Gold
water the previous fall.
He soon had Congress going
in all directions.
As he unrolled his "Great So
ciety" programs, Congress gob

bled them up, producing one of
the most remarkable jobs in
American legislative history, so
much so that some of those pro
grams haven't been digested yet.
But by this time Congress
came back for its second and
final session in 1966 the early
enthusiasm had begun to wear
thin. The 89th's performance
last year, for sheer production,
wasn't a patch on that of 1965.
