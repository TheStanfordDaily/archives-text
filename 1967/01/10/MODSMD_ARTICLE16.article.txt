## Hitchcock Thrillers Viewed As Therapy 
### Steve Lavine 
Criticism of Alfred Hitchcock's
films is notoriously inaccurate.
Ho is either overpraised and anal
yzed to the point of absurdity
(as in Hitchcock by Eric Rohmer
and Claude Charbrol) or dis
missed as unworthy of any but
the most cursory examination.
Of the two approaches the
first is the most useful. It can
open avenues of interpretation
that would otherwise be passed
over by the viewer. In the intro
duction to Robin Wood's book
Hitchcock's Films (New York:
Barnes, 1965), Mr. Wood indi
cates the faults implicit in both
approaches and promises a book
that will fall between the two
extremes.
But like Chabrol and Rohmer,
Mr. Wood has so much respect
and love for Hitchcock that he
cannot help indulging in "inter
pretive excesses." No better ex
ample of this can be found than
the extended analogy he draws
between Hitchcock and Shake
speare. These excesses, however,
do not prevent Mr. Wood from
presenting many insights into
Hitchcock's work but one must
be careful to weigh Mr. Wood's

pronouncements with extreme
caution.
Mr. Wood advances a. thesis
which he calls the "therapeutic
theme." According to this theory
"a character is cured of some
weakness or obsession by in
dulging it and living through
the consequences." Then Mr.
Wood shows "the extension of
this 'therapy' to the spectator
by encouraging the audience to
identify."
Thus in Rear Window Hitch
cock "imprison(s) us, not only
within a limited space, but with
in a single consciousness . . .
Hitchcock enables us to feel just
that amount of uneasiness nec
essary for us to question the
morality of what he (Jeffries)
is doingâ€”our own morality since
we are spying with him, sharing
his fascinated, compulsive "Peep
ing-Tom-ism!' "
The book begins with a very
fruitful introduction which in
cludes some of the best work
done on Hitchcock to date. A
good many of Hitchcock's films
are touched upon and many in
teresting generalities ate pro
duced, from the uses of 1 kisses in
Hitchcock ("Kisses . . . are often
used to reveal Or epitomise a
whole relationship and . . . the
sense of a whole film") to a dis
cussion of "Hitchcockian moral
tone." ' ' j
The remainder of the book Is
composed of comprehensive anal
yses of Strangers on a Train,
Rear Window, Vertigo, North by
Northwest, Psycho, The Birds,
and Marnie. Mr. Wood speaks of
the last five as "an unbroken
chain of masterpieces and the
highest reach of his art to date."
I take issue with this statement
and would have preferred the
inclusion of Notorious and at
least one of the English films
but that is perhaps a matter of
taste.
Perhaps Mr. Wood's greatest
failure is in failing to deal with
Witchcock's films as mystery
thrillers. He is much akin to
the critics who become so en
grossed with the complexity of
Conrad's sea stories that they
fail to discuss them as the won
derful sea-adventure stories that
they are.
All in all, Mr. Wood's book is
one of the best available on
Hitchcock. To anyone seriously
interested in Hitchcock I would
also recommend the articles by
Bazin, Truffaut, and Chabrol in
Cahiers du Cinema in English
(No. 2, undated).
