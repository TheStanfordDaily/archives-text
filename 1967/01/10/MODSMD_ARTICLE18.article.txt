# New Casino Loop; Nebillcal Initiated
## 
### BOB THIERIOT 
A new Casino league has been
born. On December 3 an agree
ment was reached between the
members of the Western Califor
nia Casino League and two aspir
ing upstarts—Rookie and Mar
cus—which set up a new four
team league. The WCCL did not
expand; nor did it disband.
Crane and Otto, the two sole
members of the WCCL, now
participate in two disti n c t
leagues.
Neblllcal
The new league romped into
action December 4, when Marcus
dumped Crane 55-44. The new
league has no offcial name,
though the title "Nebillcal" has
been suggested by Rookie. Be
fore the players took time off
for the Christmas recess, Crane
was leading Marcus by only a
small margin. But over the holi
day season Crane destroyed Otto
four out of five games to take a
commanding lead in both the
WCCL and the NCL.
Before the NCL was sanctioned
Otto and Crane both vowed that
the WCCL would uphold its repu
tation. Crane predicted that Mar
cus and Rookie would be in
the second division. Of course,
the two "challengers" insisted
that they would humiliate the
WCCL. CrAne has kept his prom
ise by posting a IQ T 4 slate, while
Otto is mired in the cellar with
a 1-5 record.
In the high-riding WCCL
Crane has increased his lead
over Otto to eight games, and
has pulled Otto's advantage in
total points below the 200 mark.
Otto expressed disenchantment
with the new setup because there
would be no rivalry between the
two Casino leagues. "Now we
can't have play-offs between the
two league winners, as we could
have if Rook and Marcus had
set up their own two man
league. We would have had a
system like the college bowl
games, but since we play most
of our games on beds, we would
have called the playoff game
'The Rose Bed."
Crane's idea was for a system
of two playoffs — "We have a
winner's game and a loser's
game. First and second place
playoff for domination of the

first division; third and fourth
fight it out for domination of
the second division. Call one the
Winner's Bowl, the other the
Loser's Bowl. We might even
have an All-Star game."
