Last Saturday saw some unusual activities at the
Stanford Pavilion during the basketball game be
tween Stanford and Oregon State. Lying in a mass
upon the floor is Loy Peterson (32), Rich Baker
(54), Bob Franz (10), Art Harris (his head is
visible at the right side of the pile), and one uniden
tified Organ State player. Rich Baker was rudely
fouled on a drive-in. The ball had rolled away to
a waiting Howard Hassen, who is pictured trying
to get the ball into the basket. Though Hassen
converted his shot, it was nullified. Baker was
awarded two free throws which he canned for two
of his fourteen points.
