# Cards Win By A Long Horse
## 
### GREG PSALTIS 
Stanford's gymnasts staged a
strong comeback to squeak by
the University of Nevada 154.10
to 152.55 Saturday in Reno.
Nevada scored very well in
the trampoline, the third event
of the meet. The Indians trailed
by five points after that event
and were faccd with a rough job
to catch up in the next four
events.
Stanford coach John Gilmore
said that the Cards executed
their routines with very few bad
misses, thus overtaking the Ne
vada team for the win.
Indians Take 6 Events
The Indians won six of the
seven events. Sophomore Jim
Petersen captured three events,
the horizontal bars, long horse
and floor exercise. His overall
total of 47.30 was his career
high.
Captain John Rinderknecht
won the side horse, sophomore
John Marks took the rings and
sophomore Jim Snyder won the
parallel bars.
Gilmore said the outstanding
efforts of the meet were Peter
sen's 9.25 (out of a perfect 10)
on the long horse, Marks' 8.55
on the rings and Snyder's 8.30
on the parallel bars.
High point men behind Peter
sen were Rinderknecht with

29.35 and junior Rich Guess
with 23.5. Gilmore was especially
pleased with the Indians' per
formances on the long horse
where they scored 26.45 out of
30. This event was largely re
sponsible for Stanford's come
back.
Cords Near Goal
Gilmore's preseason goal was
a team score of 160. He feels
that this 154.10 score is defi
nitely a good start toward at
taining the goal, especially since
the gymnasts had only three days
to workout after the holidays.
Stanford will open its home
season Saturday against Chico
State College and California
Polytechnic Institute. Gilmore
thinks Chico State won't be too
strong but that the Indians
will be pressed to beat Cal Poly,
which has one of the strongest
trampoline teams in the coun
try.
The meet will begin at 2 p.m.
in Encina Gym.

Gilmore said the outstanding
efforts of the meet were Peter
sen's 9.25 (out of a perfect 10)
on the long horse, Marks' 8.55
on the rings and Snyder's 8.30
on the parallel bars.
High point men behind Peter
sen were Rinderknecht with

29.35 and junior Rich Guess
with 23.5. Gilmore was especially
pleased with the Indians' per
formances on the long horse
where they scored 26.45 out of
30. This event was largely re
sponsible for Stanford's come
back.
Cords Near Goal
Gilmore's preseason goal was
a team score of 160. He feels
that this 154.10 score is defi
nitely a good start toward at
taining the goal, especially since
the gymnasts had only three days
to workout after the holidays.
Stanford will open its home
season Saturday against Chico
State College and California
Polytechnic Institute. Gilmore
thinks Chico State won't be too
strong but that the Indians
will be pressed to beat Cal Poly,
which has one of the strongest
trampoline teams in the coun
try.
The meet will begin at 2 p.m.
in Encina Gym.

misses, thus overtaking the Ne
vada team for the win.
