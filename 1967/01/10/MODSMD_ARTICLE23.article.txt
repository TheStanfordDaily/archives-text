## Buckley: Firm Up 
### WILLIAM F. BUCKLEY 
For the first time there are
what might be called peace feel
ers. Nothing concrete, and prob
ably nothing acceptable—the Ad
ministration is not, one supposes,
prepared to stop the bombing
merely in return for the prom
ise of "talks." "Talks," after all,
can consist in the kind of thing
the Red Chinese did at the
United Nations in 1951 when in
vited to state the Communists'
case and discuss the happy fu
ture of the eastern world—a
series of abusive, unstoppable
monologues, hard enough to
have to bear in any case; un
endurable if the high cost of
such "talks" is to give the North
Vietnamese the opportunity to
send their facilities so as to re
new the struggle.
But why should North Viet
namese encourage us, at this
particular moment? The answer
to that question surely is related
to the special pressures recently
directed at President Johnson
to cease fire. It isn't merely the
usual call by U Thant to peace
at any price, specifically the
Communists'. The pressures are
at their most intense. More pro
fessors, students, baby doctors,
piccolo players are at us to cease
fire. It could be that the con
science of the West is suddenly
crystallizing.
Civilian Concern
More likely it is evidence that
the Communists and their sym
pathizers have managed to mus
ter all their forces to coordinate
the drive to gull the influence
makers into a hyperthyroidal con
cern not for the South Viet
namese victims of cold-blooded
death and torture by the Viet
cong, but of concern for the
civilians in North Vietnam who
are accidentally victimized by
our bombings of that area.
You would think that every
one of them was related to Har
rison Salisbury, whose accounts
of the carnage against North
Vietnam civilians has dominated
the recent scene. The Washing
ton Post at one point revealed
that the figures Harrison Salis
bury gave for the casualties al
legedly inflicted by the United
States Air Force in one particu
lar town eactly duplicated the
figures released by the North
Vietnamese several months ago.
To which the managing editor of
the New York Times replied
blandly that where else could
one expect, in North Vietnam, to
get one's statistics, if not from
the North Vietnamese?
Unfortunately, we have not
yet developed a bomb that ex
plodes only in the presence of
the enemy, whether military or
civilian. We have frequently had
to confess that through naviga
tional or other errors we have
bombed our own men. If we are
capable of doing that, we are
certainly capable of bombing
North Vietnamese civilians who
in any case, as the Pentagon has
reminded us, are cynically de
ployed by the North Vietnamese
in such a way as to clutter mili
tary installations, in an effort
to buy an unwarranted im
munity.
Pay Off
The fact of the matter is that
the pressures for a unilateral
conciliation have reached dizzy
ing lengths of irrationality, and
it is increasingly inferred that
our policies are finally beginning
to pay off. A recent confidential
letter from a well-informed Euro
pean source put it as follows:
"Behind North Vietnam's public
image of unyielding toughness

and inflexibility, erosion is
spreading fast. The very poor
October-November rice harvest
further worsened an already ser
ious food situation. . .. Saltwater
fish is now almost impossible to
get. Compulsory evacuation dis
rupts families. The dispersal of
factories upsets producton. . . .
Prices rise inexorably. . . . The
existence of 'counterrevolution
aries' is now freely admitted,
and there are alleged to exploit
the disruption caused by bomb
ing. .. . All informed North Viet
namese know that negotiations
in January 1965, when the Viet
cong were close to military vic
tory in the south, would have
yielded most of North Vietnam's
demands. Now, it is said, the
Vietcong have their backs to the
wall but might still wring some
concessions from a peace con
ference. Tomorrow, if the pres
ent trend continues, everything
may be lost. . . ."
There are reasons then to hope,
but hope requires a continuing
firmness by the Johnson Ad
ministration.

Civilian Concern
More likely it is evidence that
the Communists and their sym
pathizers have managed to mus
ter all their forces to coordinate
the drive to gull the influence
makers into a hyperthyroidal con
cern not for the South Viet
namese victims of cold-blooded
death and torture by the Viet
cong, but of concern for the
civilians in North Vietnam who
are accidentally victimized by
our bombings of that area.
You would think that every
one of them was related to Har
rison Salisbury, whose accounts
of the carnage against North
Vietnam civilians has dominated
the recent scene. The Washing
ton Post at one point revealed
that the figures Harrison Salis
bury gave for the casualties al
legedly inflicted by the United
States Air Force in one particu
lar town eactly duplicated the
figures released by the North
Vietnamese several months ago.
To which the managing editor of
the New York Times replied
blandly that where else could
one expect, in North Vietnam, to
get one's statistics, if not from
the North Vietnamese?
Unfortunately, we have not
yet developed a bomb that ex
plodes only in the presence of
the enemy, whether military or
civilian. We have frequently had
to confess that through naviga
tional or other errors we have
bombed our own men. If we are
capable of doing that, we are
certainly capable of bombing
North Vietnamese civilians who
in any case, as the Pentagon has
reminded us, are cynically de
ployed by the North Vietnamese
in such a way as to clutter mili
tary installations, in an effort
to buy an unwarranted im
munity.
Pay Off
The fact of the matter is that
the pressures for a unilateral
conciliation have reached dizzy
ing lengths of irrationality, and
it is increasingly inferred that
our policies are finally beginning
to pay off. A recent confidential
letter from a well-informed Euro
pean source put it as follows:
"Behind North Vietnam's public
image of unyielding toughness

and inflexibility, erosion is
spreading fast. The very poor
October-November rice harvest
further worsened an already ser
ious food situation. . .. Saltwater
fish is now almost impossible to
get. Compulsory evacuation dis
rupts families. The dispersal of
factories upsets producton. . . .
Prices rise inexorably. . . . The
existence of 'counterrevolution
aries' is now freely admitted,
and there are alleged to exploit
the disruption caused by bomb
ing. .. . All informed North Viet
namese know that negotiations
in January 1965, when the Viet
cong were close to military vic
tory in the south, would have
yielded most of North Vietnam's
demands. Now, it is said, the
Vietcong have their backs to the
wall but might still wring some
concessions from a peace con
ference. Tomorrow, if the pres
ent trend continues, everything
may be lost. . . ."
There are reasons then to hope,
but hope requires a continuing
firmness by the Johnson Ad
ministration.

what might be called peace feel

merely in return for the prom

get one's statistics, if not from
the North Vietnamese?
Unfortunately, we have not
yet developed a bomb that ex
plodes only in the presence of
the enemy, whether military or
civilian. We have frequently had
to confess that through naviga
tional or other errors we have
bombed our own men. If we are
capable of doing that, we are
certainly capable of bombing
North Vietnamese civilians who
in any case, as the Pentagon has
reminded us, are cynically de
ployed by the North Vietnamese
in such a way as to clutter mili
tary installations, in an effort
to buy an unwarranted im
munity.
Pay Off
The fact of the matter is that
the pressures for a unilateral
conciliation have reached dizzy
ing lengths of irrationality, and
it is increasingly inferred that
our policies are finally beginning
to pay off. A recent confidential
letter from a well-informed Euro
pean source put it as follows:
"Behind North Vietnam's public
image of unyielding toughness

and inflexibility, erosion is
spreading fast. The very poor
October-November rice harvest
further worsened an already ser
ious food situation. . .. Saltwater
fish is now almost impossible to
get. Compulsory evacuation dis
rupts families. The dispersal of
factories upsets producton. . . .
Prices rise inexorably. . . . The
existence of 'counterrevolution
aries' is now freely admitted,
and there are alleged to exploit
the disruption caused by bomb
ing. .. . All informed North Viet
namese know that negotiations
in January 1965, when the Viet
cong were close to military vic
tory in the south, would have
yielded most of North Vietnam's
demands. Now, it is said, the
Vietcong have their backs to the
wall but might still wring some
concessions from a peace con
ference. Tomorrow, if the pres
ent trend continues, everything
may be lost. . . ."
There are reasons then to hope,
but hope requires a continuing
firmness by the Johnson Ad
ministration.

"Since we can't vote or buy liquor, we ought to have some privilege."
For the first time there are
what might be called peace feel
ers. Nothing concrete, and prob
ably nothing acceptable—the Ad
ministration is not, one supposes,
prepared to stop the bombing
merely in return for the prom
ise of "talks." "Talks," after all,
can consist in the kind of thing
the Red Chinese did at the
United Nations in 1951 when in
vited to state the Communists'
case and discuss the happy fu
ture of the eastern world—a
series of abusive, unstoppable
monologues, hard enough to
have to bear in any case; un
endurable if the high cost of
such "talks" is to give the North
Vietnamese the opportunity to
send their facilities so as to re
new the struggle.
But why should North Viet
namese encourage us, at this
particular moment? The answer
to that question surely is related
to the special pressures recently
directed at President Johnson
to cease fire. It isn't merely the
usual call by U Thant to peace
at any price, specifically the
Communists'. The pressures are
at their most intense. More pro
fessors, students, baby doctors,
piccolo players are at us to cease
fire. It could be that the con
science of the West is suddenly
crystallizing.
Civilian Concern
More likely it is evidence that
the Communists and their sym
pathizers have managed to mus
ter all their forces to coordinate
the drive to gull the influence
makers into a hyperthyroidal con
cern not for the South Viet
namese victims of cold-blooded
death and torture by the Viet
cong, but of concern for the
civilians in North Vietnam who
are accidentally victimized by
our bombings of that area.
You would think that every
one of them was related to Har
rison Salisbury, whose accounts
of the carnage against North
Vietnam civilians has dominated
the recent scene. The Washing
ton Post at one point revealed
that the figures Harrison Salis
bury gave for the casualties al
legedly inflicted by the United
States Air Force in one particu
lar town eactly duplicated the
figures released by the North
Vietnamese several months ago.

the New York Times replied
