# Lippmann: False Dilemna
## 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
The outlook for the new year
would be brighter if in talking
about the war in Vietnam we
could get rid of the idea that
the country is confronted with
the sharp choice between win
ning or losing the war, between
unconditional and immediate
withdrawal and the uncondi
tioned surrender of the enemy.
These absolute choices are
easy to talk about, but they rep
resent a failure to think at all.
They hide the real problem and
make it unmanageable.
The real problem is to find
some middle ground between a
South Vietnam which must re
main indefinitely under Ameri
can occupation and a South
Vietnam under the direct domi
nation of North Vietnam.
There is no hope that the ac
tivists in North and South Viet
nam can ever agree to the per
manence of the American mili
tary presence in South Vietnam.
The North Vietnamese on the
other hand can have no hope
that the United States will with
draw its forces and throw the re
gime in South Vietnam to its
enemies. There is hope only in a
negotiated compromise.
The compromise can, however,
not be negotiated so long as the
President is placed in the false
dilemma of victory or defeat,
win or no-win, go up or get out,

withdrawal or kock-them-out. To
be asked to choose between these
absolute and extreme policies is
to have to choose the impossi
ble, the unreal—among various
forms of nonsense.
There is on one extreme the
notion that the American forces
can be forced to withdraw, eith
er because they are defeated in
battle or because the American
people grow weary of the battle.
M. Jean Sainteny, who has
known Ho Chi Minh longer and
has seen him more recently than
any Westerner, says that North
Vietnam may be suffering from
the illusion that American
forces in Indochina, though
stronger than the French forces
were in the Fifties, will follow
the same course down to defeat.
If Ho Chi Minh thinks this, he
is entertaining a very dangerous
illusion. The American military
power cannot be defeated by
any Asian army that can be mo
bilized and equipped. The Ameri
can Army can stay in South Viet
nam until it is deliberately with
drawn under a negotiated settle
ment.
Hawk View
But while the Americans can
not be defeated, it does not fol
low that they can win. Those
who are able to wreck a house
completely and effectively are
not often the same men who
can build a new house.

The extremist hawks are well
represented by the chairman of
the House Armed Services Com
mittee, Mendel Rivers, who
wants us 'to flatten Hanoi and
let the world opinion go fly a
kite." If men like him prevail
—and unfortunately they have
been increasingly on the ascen
dant since 196§—we shall be in
worse trouble that we are in
now.
The Rivers view, which is the
theory of the Air Force, is im
portant because the President,
though protesting and resisting,
has again and again yielded to
it. We can afford no illusions
about the consequences of tak
ing this absolute course.
If the country presents itself
as uniquely and unilaterally en
titled to use unlimited military
force in Vietnam it will isolate
itself among the nations of the
world.
Chairman Rivers thinks that
all that this will mean is that
the other nations will make
speeches and write editorials and
march in demonstrations. He
knows little of the world.
Militarists
Once the strongest military
power on earth has identified
itself as willing and ready to
use unlimited force for its own
ends, there begins, as we see in
history, the formation of a coali
tion to contain its military,
That is where things have been
pointing since 1965. That is
where they will go if we think
that we can use our weapons
and ignore world opinion.
The self-righteous use of mili
tary power will be just as dan
gerous to the United States as
it has proved to be before in
the history of nations. The out
and-out militarist power will
unite other nations against it.
The tough guys among us who
cannot find words scornful
enough to express their con
tempt for those who ask for a
recent respect of the opinions of
mankind are foolish and igno
rant men. They know no history,
and they know little of the
world they are talking about.
If they have their way we, too,
like the militarists of the past,
shall find that fear of our power
and distrust of our purposes will
bring about an alignment of the
nations against us.
