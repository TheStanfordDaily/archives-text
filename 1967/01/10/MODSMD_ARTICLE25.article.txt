## Chartered Misery 
### Pell Fender 
A number of Stanford stu
dents had the misfortune and
discomfort of traveling to and
from their homes via chartered
or "supplemental" airlines this
vacation. The ASSU charter
flights, which engage the planes
of scheduled airlines, went off
without a hitch; the flights ar
ranged by Charter Flights, Inc.,
however, were somewhat less
pleasant.
On some date in November
Charter Flights issued a mimeo
graphed sheet which was hung

in Stanford dormitories adver
tising flights to New York and
Chicago. This sheet contained the
stipulation that space on the
flights was limited to "students,
faculty, employees, and their
families," according to Civil
Aeronautics Board regulations.
The flier did not stipulate that
these students, etc., be members
of the Stanford community, or
even of any one particular uni
versity.
Appeal To Cal
The ommission has one of two
implications: either the stipula
tion was not included by an
error, or Charter Flights was
appealing to more than one uni
versity (specifically, University
of California). The CAB code
allows flights containing a maxi
mum of three different organiza
tions, as long as each organiza
tion is represented by at least
40 persons per plane.
In lieu of possible violation of
the CAB code, Dave Venedigger,
head of the ASSU Travel Service,
consulted Mr. Daryl Dawson, one
of Stanford's legal council for
business affairs. Mr. Dawson, in
turn, corresponded with the
CAB, and his letter was an
swered by Mr. J. W. Rosenthal,
who promised to look into the
possibility of a violation of CAB
code. ASSU charter flights re
quire that passengers be either
of the Stanford community, or
members of the immediate fam
ily.
Five Students
The upshot is that Stanford
Airways, one of the "supplemen
tal" airlines engaged by Charter
Flights to fly to Chicago, car
ried only a few Stanford stu
dents, certainly under 40, and,
from interviews, probably under
five. The log of the flight itself
reads like Bob Newhart's ac
count of Grace Ferguson Air
lines.
Although the Standard Air
ways prop took off on time, It
failed to land at .O'Hara Field,
as advertised and contracted.
Upon arriving at Midway, the
students realized the significant
miscalculation and hastily con
ferred with the piolt, who agreed
to reland at O'Hara.
No Plane
On the return trip Standard
Airlines announced well before
the take off time of 12 noon that
the plane would not take off un
til 12 midnight (frankly, there
was no plane). At approximately
2 p.m. it was announced to those
fortunate enough to have re
mained at the airport, or who
decided that a periodical check
should be made by telephone,
that the plane was again re
scheduled, this time to em
bark at 9 p.m., and anathema to
those who still believed that mid
night was the bewitching hour.
Besides the possibility of a
violation of CAB code in carry
ing only a few Stanford stu
dents, it is obvious that the dis
comfort, inconveniences, and out
right terror that such an opera
tion infuses is hardly worth the
savings offered. In addition, the
failure of Standard Airways per
sonnel to confront the passen
gers and explain the delays hard
ly offers one that subtle sense
of confidence in the safety and
operability of a literally fly-by
night concession.
In short, it is recommended
that the University and its legal
council for business affairs in
vestigate and, if necessary, take
action upon, the possible viola
tion of Standard Airways and/or
Charter Flights, Inc., in the in
terest of its own students. Sim
ilary, the student might in the
future take a closer look at the
charter flights using nonsched
uled carriers which offer both
cheap travel and cheap service.

vacation. The ASSU charter
flights, which engage the planes
of scheduled airlines, went off
without a hitch; the flights ar
ranged by Charter Flights, Inc.,
however, were somewhat less
pleasant.
On some date in November
Charter Flights issued a mimeo
graphed sheet which was hung

in Stanford dormitories adver
tising flights to New York and
Chicago. This sheet contained the
stipulation that space on the
flights was limited to "students,
faculty, employees, and their
families," according to Civil
Aeronautics Board regulations.
The flier did not stipulate that
these students, etc., be members
of the Stanford community, or
even of any one particular uni
versity.
Appeal To Cal
The ommission has one of two
implications: either the stipula
tion was not included by an
error, or Charter Flights was
appealing to more than one uni
versity (specifically, University
of California). The CAB code
allows flights containing a maxi
mum of three different organiza
tions, as long as each organiza
tion is represented by at least
40 persons per plane.
In lieu of possible violation of
the CAB code, Dave Venedigger,
head of the ASSU Travel Service,
consulted Mr. Daryl Dawson, one
of Stanford's legal council for
business affairs. Mr. Dawson, in
turn, corresponded with the
CAB, and his letter was an
swered by Mr. J. W. Rosenthal,
who promised to look into the
possibility of a violation of CAB
code. ASSU charter flights re
quire that passengers be either
of the Stanford community, or
members of the immediate fam

Five Students
The upshot is that Stanford
Airways, one of the "supplemen
tal" airlines engaged by Charter
Flights to fly to Chicago, car
ried only a few Stanford stu
dents, certainly under 40, and,
from interviews, probably under
five. The log of the flight itself
reads like Bob Newhart's ac
count of Grace Ferguson Air
lines.
Although the Standard Air
ways prop took off on time, It
failed to land at .O'Hara Field,
as advertised and contracted.
Upon arriving at Midway, the
students realized the significant
miscalculation and hastily con
ferred with the piolt, who agreed
to reland at O'Hara.
No Plane
On the return trip Standard
Airlines announced well before
the take off time of 12 noon that
the plane would not take off un
til 12 midnight (frankly, there
was no plane). At approximately
2 p.m. it was announced to those
fortunate enough to have re
mained at the airport, or who
decided that a periodical check
should be made by telephone,
that the plane was again re
scheduled, this time to em
bark at 9 p.m., and anathema to
those who still believed that mid
night was the bewitching hour.
Besides the possibility of a
violation of CAB code in carry
ing only a few Stanford stu
dents, it is obvious that the dis
comfort, inconveniences, and out
right terror that such an opera
tion infuses is hardly worth the
savings offered. In addition, the
failure of Standard Airways per
sonnel to confront the passen
gers and explain the delays hard
ly offers one that subtle sense
of confidence in the safety and
operability of a literally fly-by
night concession.
In short, it is recommended
that the University and its legal
council for business affairs in
vestigate and, if necessary, take
action upon, the possible viola
tion of Standard Airways and/or
Charter Flights, Inc., in the in
terest of its own students. Sim

future take a closer look at the
charter flights using nonsched

cheap travel and cheap service.
