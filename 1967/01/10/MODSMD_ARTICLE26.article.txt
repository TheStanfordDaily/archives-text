IT'S A NORTH WIND THAT BLOWS NO COOl)
Crushed between the twin millstones of January
weather and final exams, you are saved from total des
pair, poor devils, only by the knowledge that winter vaca
tion will spon be here.
Where will you go this year? Will it be Florida again,
or are you tired of jails? Then how about Puerto Rico?
A most excellent notion, say I. A balmy and bounteous
island with long white beaches and blue, blue skies and
green, healing seas. And, most pleasant of all, the warm
and gracious people of Puerto Rico! You don't even have
to know Spanish to communicate with this friendly folk.
Just learn three simple phrases and you'll get along
splendidly: "Buenos dias" which means "Good morning,"
"Graeias" which means "Thank you," and "Que sera
sera," which means "Your llama is on my foot."
In order to help you enjoy the fabled land of Puerto
Rico it would be well for me to supply a bit of historical
background. (It would also be well for me to say a few
words about Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades be
cause the makers of Personna Super Stainless Steel
Blades pay me to write this column and they are inclined
to sulk if I omit to mention their product. Of course, they
don't stay gloomy long, for they are kindly, cheery men
fond of Morris dancing, spelling bees, and temperance
punch—fine, upright types, as true and gleaming and
durable as the blades they make. And if you've tried
Personna's, you know how true and gleaming and durable
that is! And if you haven't tried Personna's, poor devil,
you've cheated both your purse and face, for Personna's
last and last, shave after luxury shave, close, clean, nick
less, hackless, tugless, gougeless, scratchless, matchless.
Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades come in Double
Edge or Injector style and are made only by the makers
of Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades.)
But I digress. Back to the history of Puerto Rico. The
island was discovered by that popular discoverer Chris
topher Columbus. Incidentally, considering Columbus'
popularity, it's odd we know so little about him. What do
we really know? Only this:
He was born in Genoa on August 25, 1451, the son of
Ralph T. Columbus, a knee-cymbal vendor, and Eleanor
(Swifty) Columbus, a low hurdler. He was an only child
except for his five brothers and eight sisters. From early
childhood he was an avid reader and spent all his waking
hours immersed in a book. Unfortunately, there was only
one book in Genoa at the time —Care of the Horse by
Aristotle—and after 18 years of reading Care of the
Horse, Columbus grew restless. When rumor reached
him there was another book in Madrid, off he ran as fast
as his little fat legs would carry him.
Disappointment, alas, awaited him there. The only book
in Madrid was Cuidar unCaballo, which proved to be noth
ing more than a Spanish translation of Care of the Horse.
Then one day Columbus heard from a traveller that
there were millions of books in India, and he was in
stantly ablaze to set sail. Off he ran on his little fat legs
to the court of Ferdinand and Isabella (Columbus, though
more than six feet tall, was plagued with little fat legs
all his life) and, as we all know, he persuaded the Span
ish rulers to outfit him with three stout ships, the Flopsy,
the Mopsy, and the Cottontail, and the rest is history!

Well sir, now you know all about the origins of Puerto
Rico. So get packed and get going! You'll love it! Stroll the
beaches, swim the coves, breathe the 112 ragrance of hibiscus
and bougainvillea. And remember always that the friendly
Puerto Ricans are delighted to show you their customs,
teach you their language. Why, I'll wager you'll soon know
far more Spanish than the three basic phrases. You'll know
"Hasta la vista" which means "See you later.""Por fdvor"
which means "Please," and "El tren se pard en las esta
ci6n" which means "Your llama has eaten my passport."

But I digress. Back to the history of Puerto Rico. The
island was discovered by that popular discoverer Chris
topher Columbus. Incidentally, considering Columbus'
popularity, it's odd we know so little about him. What do
we really know? Only this:
He was born in Genoa on August 25, 1451, the son of
Ralph T. Columbus, a knee-cymbal vendor, and Eleanor
(Swifty) Columbus, a low hurdler. He was an only child
except for his five brothers and eight sisters. From early
childhood he was an avid reader and spent all his waking
hours immersed in a book. Unfortunately, there was only
one book in Genoa at the time —Care of the Horse by
Aristotle—and after 18 years of reading Care of the
Horse, Columbus grew restless. When rumor reached
him there was another book in Madrid, off he ran as fast
as his little fat legs would carry him.
Disappointment, alas, awaited him there. The only book
in Madrid was Cuidar unCaballo, which proved to be noth
ing more than a Spanish translation of Care of the Horse.
Then one day Columbus heard from a traveller that
there were millions of books in India, and he was in
stantly ablaze to set sail. Off he ran on his little fat legs
to the court of Ferdinand and Isabella (Columbus, though
more than six feet tall, was plagued with little fat legs
all his life) and, as we all know, he persuaded the Span
ish rulers to outfit him with three stout ships, the Flopsy,
the Mopsy, and the Cottontail, and the rest is history!

Well sir, now you know all about the origins of Puerto
Rico. So get packed and get going! You'll love it! Stroll the
beaches, swim the coves, breathe the 112 ragrance of hibiscus
and bougainvillea. And remember always that the friendly
Puerto Ricans are delighted to show you their customs,
teach you their language. Why, I'll wager you'll soon know
far more Spanish than the three basic phrases. You'll know
"Hasta la vista" which means "See you later.""Por fdvor"
which means "Please," and "El tren se pard en las esta
ci6n" which means "Your llama has eaten my passport."

Aristotle—and after 18 years of reading Care of the
Horse, Columbus grew restless. When rumor reached
him there was another book in Madrid, off he ran as fast
as his little fat legs would carry him.
Disappointment, alas, awaited him there. The only book
in Madrid was Cuidar unCaballo, which proved to be noth
ing more than a Spanish translation of Care of the Horse.
Then one day Columbus heard from a traveller that
there were millions of books in India, and he was in
stantly ablaze to set sail. Off he ran on his little fat legs
to the court of Ferdinand and Isabella (Columbus, though
more than six feet tall, was plagued with little fat legs
all his life) and, as we all know, he persuaded the Span
ish rulers to outfit him with three stout ships, the Flopsy,
the Mopsy, and the Cottontail, and the rest is history!

Well sir, now you know all about the origins of Puerto
Rico. So get packed and get going! You'll love it! Stroll the
beaches, swim the coves, breathe the 112 ragrance of hibiscus
and bougainvillea. And remember always that the friendly
Puerto Ricans are delighted to show you their customs,
teach you their language. Why, I'll wager you'll soon know
far more Spanish than the three basic phrases. You'll know
"Hasta la vista" which means "See you later.""Por fdvor"
which means "Please," and "El tren se pard en las esta
ci6n" which means "Your llama has eaten my passport."

IT'S A NORTH WIND THAT BLOWS NO COOl)
Crushed between the twin millstones of January
weather and final exams, you are saved from total des
pair, poor devils, only by the knowledge that winter vaca
tion will spon be here.
Where will you go this year? Will it be Florida again,
or are you tired of jails? Then how about Puerto Rico?
A most excellent notion, say I. A balmy and bounteous
island with long white beaches and blue, blue skies and
green, healing seas. And, most pleasant of all, the warm
and gracious people of Puerto Rico! You don't even have
to know Spanish to communicate with this friendly folk.
Just learn three simple phrases and you'll get along
splendidly: "Buenos dias" which means "Good morning,"
"Graeias" which means "Thank you," and "Que sera
sera," which means "Your llama is on my foot."
In order to help you enjoy the fabled land of Puerto
Rico it would be well for me to supply a bit of historical
background. (It would also be well for me to say a few
words about Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades be
cause the makers of Personna Super Stainless Steel
Blades pay me to write this column and they are inclined
to sulk if I omit to mention their product. Of course, they
don't stay gloomy long, for they are kindly, cheery men
fond of Morris dancing, spelling bees, and temperance
punch—fine, upright types, as true and gleaming and
durable as the blades they make. And if you've tried
Personna's, you know how true and gleaming and durable
that is! And if you haven't tried Personna's, poor devil,
you've cheated both your purse and face, for Personna's
last and last, shave after luxury shave, close, clean, nick
less, hackless, tugless, gougeless, scratchless, matchless.
Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades come in Double
Edge or Injector style and are made only by the makers
of Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades.)
But I digress. Back to the history of Puerto Rico. The
island was discovered by that popular discoverer Chris
topher Columbus. Incidentally, considering Columbus'
popularity, it's odd we know so little about him. What do
we really know? Only this:
He was born in Genoa on August 25, 1451, the son of
Ralph T. Columbus, a knee-cymbal vendor, and Eleanor
(Swifty) Columbus, a low hurdler. He was an only child
except for his five brothers and eight sisters. From early
childhood he was an avid reader and spent all his waking
hours immersed in a book. Unfortunately, there was only
one book in Genoa at the time —Care of the Horse by
Aristotle—and after 18 years of reading Care of the
Horse, Columbus grew restless. When rumor reached
him there was another book in Madrid, off he ran as fast
as his little fat legs would carry him.
Disappointment, alas, awaited him there. The only book
in Madrid was Cuidar unCaballo, which proved to be noth
ing more than a Spanish translation of Care of the Horse.
Then one day Columbus heard from a traveller that
there were millions of books in India, and he was in
stantly ablaze to set sail. Off he ran on his little fat legs
to the court of Ferdinand and Isabella (Columbus, though
more than six feet tall, was plagued with little fat legs
all his life) and, as we all know, he persuaded the Span
ish rulers to outfit him with three stout ships, the Flopsy,
