# Rent Delay Still On; Support Dwindles
## 
### 
The rent delay sponsored by OFF
will continue until room and board
payments fall due Friday for Stern
and Wilbur, and Monday for women
students.
At an organizational meeting last
night, leader of the OFF movement
Janet Howell told members that En
cina tellers reported payments were
coming in only "very slowly" as of
Monday afternoon.
The group is currently making an
effort to learn the number of par
ticipants in the boycott to satisfy
student curiosity, but Miss Howell de
clared the figure "not of major im
portance" as an indication of force.
She described the delay rather as "a
gesture of student belief in the off
campus movement."
After the boycott is endedâ€”what
then? This is the primary concern of
OFF leaders. "Since the delay wasn't
a true strike," said Miss Howell, "the
atmosphere is such that more con
crete negotiations can now take place."
The first channel open to considera
tion of the issue is the Committee of
Fifteen, which yesterday afternoon
made arrangements to get all relevant
information into the hands of C-15
members. A discussion of the recent
housing survey and a proposed long
range study of Stanford, including
its position as a residence university,
will take place when the Committee
meets again Tuesday.
OFF encourages students who have
a particular interest in the off-cam
pus housing issue to discuss their
views with administrative, faculty, and
student members of C-15 before the
next meeting.
David Harris reminded OFF mem
bers at the meeting, "What we're doing
is defining the bounds of a residence

university. The question is not if
Stanford should be a residence uni
versity, but if it should be a forced
residence university."
Women leading the movement are
especially concerned that residence
on campus is forced upon only part
of the student body. Miss Howell ex
pressed the concern that "The main
danger confronting the OFF issue is
that a very regimented, limited loosen
ing up of rules will be introduced to
pacify us. This would not be enough;
we're still looking for across the
board equality."
OFF members agreed at last night's
meeting that any financial case against
the change was dead, and referred to
essential confirmation of this in a
letter President Sterling wrote to
Carol Christ. Leaders plan a follow-up
meeting for next Wednesday when
they will review any discussion by
C-15.
