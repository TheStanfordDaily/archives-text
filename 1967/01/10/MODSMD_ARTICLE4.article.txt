# Register
## 
### 
This Friday the 13th could be
I unlucky for students who neglect |
H to file their class cards with the 1
Registrar's office before the of- |
flee closes that day. A late fee
; will be incurred on study lists |
I and class cards filed after that 112
| date.
Also, any undergraduate en- |
rolled in a course on a pass-fail
basis must file a pass-fail declara-
I tion with the Registrar's office. ■
| The form for this declaration can 112
| be obtained in Room 111-A on the
■i Inner Quad.
