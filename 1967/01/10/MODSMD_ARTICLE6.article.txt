# Regents Meet
## UC Budget Cut, Fees Proposed 
### 
State Finance Director Gordon
Smith yesterday proposed a ten per
cent cut in the University of California
budget, along with tuition fees for
students and use of the University
Regents' own $22 million fund to
help balance the state budget.
Smith's proposal, at an emergency
Board of Regents meeting in Los

Angeles, ran into stiff opposition from
University of California President
Clark Kerr and several Regents as
well as the Chancellors of the Uni
versity's nine campuses.
Meanwhile, in Sacramento an aide
to Governor Ronald Reagan reiterated
last night that no final decision on
the issue has been made by the Gov

ernor. Reagan has a news conference
scheduled for this morning at which
he is expected to clarify his plans for
financing public higher education.
Finance Director Smith also sug
gested that the University delay ini
tiating the new four-quarter system at
its Berkeley campus to save the $5
million it would cost to start it next
summer. President Kerr has estimated
the plan will save the University over
$100 million in fewer than ten years.
"This does not mean that the ad
ministration has in mind to abandon
the four-quarter system," Smith said.
He asked instead that the program be
delayed for a year.
He also mentioned a $400 tuition fee

for University students, which would
bring in approximately $32 million.
He said that about $10 million of that
would be used for students who could
not pay the fee but are qualified to
enter.
The University has asked for a $278
million budget for the fiscal year be
ginning in July, an increase of $34
million over this year.
Regent Norton B. Simon received a
standing ovation from students at
tending the meeting when he said
that what the University needed was
an increased budget rather than a
decreased budget to evpand and main
tain the quality of its education. He
said the state is more propserous than
ever before and can afford it.
