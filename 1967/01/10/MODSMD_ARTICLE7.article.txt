# New Social Regs In Effect Abroad
## 
### KIRK HANSON Managing Editor 
New social regulations took effect
last week at Stanford's five overseas
campuses.
Open house hours, liquor restric
tions, and travel regulations were al
tered. "The new social regulations are
now in effect with minor exceptions
due to local circumstances," according
to George R. Hamrdla, Assistant to
the Director of the Overseas Campus
Program.
The Director, Robert A. Walker, was
unavailable for comment, now over
seas on business in England and Aus
tria.
The regulations were recommended
by the directors of the campuses at
their meeting in Rome during Novem
ber. The Dean's Office approved the
regulations late in December and they
went into effect with the opening of
this quarter.
Open House
The complete prohibition on open
houses has been altered to allow visit
ing of rooms Wednesday evenings
from 7-11 p.m. More liberal hours were

not adopted, according to Hamrdla, be
cause it was felt "the policies here
should not be superceded bv policies
overseas." Liberalized open house
hours for the home campus have been
approved by the Committee of 15 and
now are pending before Legislature.
The new liquor regulation prohibits
the possession or consumption of hard
liquor at the campuses but allows
other forms of alcohol to be kept in
the rooms and consumed at the cam
puses.
The regulation, however, empha
sizes: "Any disturbance or disorderly
conduct resulting from overindulgence
in alcohol will be severely dealt with."
Previously the liquor regulation had
prohibited any liquor in the students'
rooms.
Travel
Travel restrictions have been altered
to allow women to travel alone with
men. However the regulation states:
"It is strongly recommended that
when a travel group consists of both
sexes, at least two women should be
included." Students are still required
to leave their travel routes and ad
dresses of destinations with the Di
rectors when departing on weekend or
vacation trips. Women are not allowed
to travel alone without the advance
permission of parents and the Director
of the campus.
The new regulations also state: "A
more restricted version of these regu
lations is necessary at certain cam
puses on account of local laws or
other considerations." Hamrdla com
mented on the new regulations: "The
director at each campus has the option
to withdraw these privileges if they
are abused." He did not elaborate on
these variations.
Liberalized Program
The Overseas Campus Office is also
going ahead with plans for a greatly
liberalized academic program. The
General Studies Committee has ap
proved the changes recommended by
the Directors last November.
Hamrdla said yesterday that courses
now being made up will reflect these
changes. He also said the Overseas
Campus Office hopes to have the
changes into effect at all campuses by
this September.

sexes, at least two women should be
included." Students are still required
to leave their travel routes and ad
dresses of destinations with the Di
rectors when departing on weekend or
vacation trips. Women are not allowed
to travel alone without the advance
permission of parents and the Director
of the campus.
The new regulations also state: "A
more restricted version of these regu
lations is necessary at certain cam
puses on account of local laws or
other considerations." Hamrdla com
mented on the new regulations: "The
director at each campus has the option
to withdraw these privileges if they
are abused." He did not elaborate on
these variations.
Liberalized Program
The Overseas Campus Office is also
going ahead with plans for a greatly
liberalized academic program. The
General Studies Committee has ap
proved the changes recommended by
the Directors last November.
Hamrdla said yesterday that courses
now being made up will reflect these
changes. He also said the Overseas
Campus Office hopes to have the
changes into effect at all campuses by
this September.
New social regulations took effect
last week at Stanford's five overseas
campuses.
Open house hours, liquor restric
tions, and travel regulations were al
tered. "The new social regulations are
now in effect with minor exceptions
due to local circumstances," according
to George R. Hamrdla, Assistant to
the Director of the Overseas Campus
Program.
The Director, Robert A. Walker, was
unavailable for comment, now over
seas on business in England and Aus
tria.
The regulations were recommended
by the directors of the campuses at
their meeting in Rome during Novem
ber. The Dean's Office approved the
regulations late in December and they
went into effect with the opening of
this quarter.
Open House
The complete prohibition on open
houses has been altered to allow visit
ing of rooms Wednesday evenings
from 7-11 p.m. More liberal hours were

not adopted, according to Hamrdla, be
cause it was felt "the policies here
should not be superceded bv policies
overseas." Liberalized open house
hours for the home campus have been
approved by the Committee of 15 and
now are pending before Legislature.
The new liquor regulation prohibits
the possession or consumption of hard
liquor at the campuses but allows
other forms of alcohol to be kept in
the rooms and consumed at the cam
puses.
The regulation, however, empha
sizes: "Any disturbance or disorderly
conduct resulting from overindulgence
in alcohol will be severely dealt with."
Previously the liquor regulation had
prohibited any liquor in the students'
rooms.
Travel
Travel restrictions have been altered
to allow women to travel alone with
men. However the regulation states:
"It is strongly recommended that
when a travel group consists of both
sexes, at least two women should be
included." Students are still required
to leave their travel routes and ad
dresses of destinations with the Di
rectors when departing on weekend or
vacation trips. Women are not allowed
to travel alone without the advance
permission of parents and the Director
of the campus.
The new regulations also state: "A

lations is necessary at certain cam
