# Educators Call For Student Rights
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (CPS) — Three
major educational organizations is
sued a qualified call this week for stu
dent participation in college and uni
versity policy-making.
Despite "large obstacles" to such in
volvement, the groups said that col
leges should seek ways to "permit
significant student participation with
in the limits of attainable effective
ness."
These suggestions were contained
in a short note on students as part of
a statement issued by the American
Association of University Professors,
the American Council on Education,
and the Association of Governing
Boards of Colleges and Universities.
The full statement, in preparation
since 1964, primarily discussed the re
sponsibilities of trustess, presidents,
and faculty for "Government of Col

leges and Universities." No main sec
tion was offered on students.
The obstacles to student participa
tion on policy-making, the statement
said, include "inexperience, untested
capacity, transitory status . . . and
the inescapab'e fact that the other
components of the institution are in a
position of judgment over the stu
dents.
The report added, however, that the
following opportunities should be giv
en to increase students "respect" for
their colleges and universities:
• Freedom of speech in the class
room "without fear of institutional re
prisal;
• Freedom to discuss questions of
institutional policy and operation;
• The right to academic due process
when charged with serious violations
of institutional regulations; and

• The same right to hear speakers
of their own choice as is enjoyed
by other components of the insti
tution."
The educational organizations avoid
ed issuing a main section on students,
however, because, they said, an at
tempt to define students' role, at a
time when it is rapidly changing,
might hurt student interest and be
cause "students do not at present have
a significant voice in the government
of colleges and universities."
In the major part of the statement,
the groups suggested ways in which
trustees, presidents ,and faculty can
share responsibility for governing in
stitutions.
Trustees, the report said, have final
institutional authority in almost all
colleges and universities, with few ex
ceptions. They should, however, dele

gate many of their responsibilities,
and concentrate on long-term plan
ning, or raising capital and operating
funds, and on overseeing personnel
policy.
The president, the report said, "is
measured largely by his caparitv for
institutional leadership." As chief ex
ecutive and planning officer, he must
maintain communications within the
institution and between the school and
its public; and he must "innovate and
initiate."
Faculty members should have the
major responsibility for curriculum,
student instruction, decisions on ten
ure, promotion, and dismissals, and
policies governing salary increases,
the report added. It warned that ex
ternal restraints on faculty respon
sibility for education of students can
impair the "education effectiveness"
of an institution.
