# Changes Swamp Schedule Office
## 
### STEVE GRUBER 
In the inner recesses of the Quad
is an office that helps keep Stanford
running.
And it's not the President's Office,
the registrar's computer, or even the
Board of Trustees.
It's the Room Scheduling Office.
Mrs. Henrietta Edeli, the Room
Scheduling secretary, is responsible
for room assignments for most of
the University's classes. Yesterday
was one of the most hectic of the
quarter for her, but today she will
start on the room scheduling for
spring quarter.
Mrs. Edeli was kept busy from 8 a.m
to 5 p.m. yesterday—as soon as she
put the phone down, it rang again.
She settled the problems of scores of
classes, including an art class in
which 155 students showed up unex
pectedly.
146 Classrooms
There are only 146 classrooms at
Stanford, and Mrs. Edeli is respon
sible, directly and indirectly, for 118
of them. The rest are scheduled by
the departments which "control them,"
in the jargon of the Registrar's Of
fice. Fifty classrooms are always
scheduled by the Registrar's office and
the other 68 are controlled by various
departments unless there are vacan
cies.
The Room Scheduling Office is one
of the most efficient of all the Uni
versity's bureaucracy. One wall is cov
ered with a file containing the number
of each room and its seating capacity.
On the reverse side of the card, each
day of the week and the hours of the
day, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., are blocked
out.
Because special classes are occasion

ally scheduled, the schedule for a
room must cover every week of the
quarter. It all appears confusing at
first, but Mrs. Edeli's familiarity with
available classroom space speeds up
the process.
Spring Quarter
And once the scheduling problems
are solved for this quarter, work will
begin on spring quarter. The next
Time Schedule will go to press Jan
uary 17. Room Scheduling will have a
week to assign spaces and type a
final draft of the Schedule.
The work is never really done for
Mrs. Edeli, for once she finishes the
Time Schedule, she will make out a
new wall file for all the spring quar
ter classes. Then the proofreading and
new changes will have to be made in
the Time Schedule. Before she knows
it, spring quarter will be here and the
momumental shuffle will be on again.
Five-way Switch
Many problems can be solved by
simply switching one classroom with
another, but occasionally, for one rea
son or another, other classes will also
have to be changed. "I'm making a
five-way switch right now," Mrs.
Edeli said, as she juggles her files.
Some classes need to show movies
or slides, but not all of the classrooms
have projection facilities. For ex
ample, an art class with 240 students
could not be moved to Dinkelspiel be
cause slides of pictures had to be
shown and Dinkelspiel doesn't have
an adequate screen.
Occasionally professors will reject
classrooms because they are too large.
One English instructor turned down a
chance to move his class into Cub
berley Auditorium for this reason. A

Biology professor also refused Cub
berley because the blackboards are
too small.
All of these problems add up to a
five-day headache for Mrs. E d e 11.
Sometimes, during the first week of
the quarter, she has to work on the
weekends to untangle the confusion.
Pre-Reg Lists
Preregistration sign-up lists usually
solve most of the problems, she said,
but they are not the final solution.
Psychology 60, a required course, had
to be expanded at the last minute to

allow students to finish their majors
and General Studies requirements.
"There are no big problems in room
scheduling, just little problems," ac
cording to the lady who helps Mrs.
Edeli during the busiest times of the
quarter.
The largest classroom in the Uni
versity is Memorial Auditorium, which
seats 1739. Dinkelspiel holds 719 and
Cubberley has 500 seats.
The smallest is room 39 in the Grad
uate School of Business, which can
seat no more than eight students.

quarter. It all appears confusing at
first, but Mrs. Edeli's familiarity with
available classroom space speeds up
the process.
Spring Quarter
And once the scheduling problems
are solved for this quarter, work will
begin on spring quarter. The next
Time Schedule will go to press Jan
uary 17. Room Scheduling will have a
week to assign spaces and type a
final draft of the Schedule.
The work is never really done for
Mrs. Edeli, for once she finishes the
Time Schedule, she will make out a
new wall file for all the spring quar
ter classes. Then the proofreading and
new changes will have to be made in
the Time Schedule. Before she knows
it, spring quarter will be here and the
momumental shuffle will be on again.
Five-way Switch
Many problems can be solved by
simply switching one classroom with
another, but occasionally, for one rea
son or another, other classes will also
have to be changed. "I'm making a
five-way switch right now," Mrs.
Edeli said, as she juggles her files.
Some classes need to show movies
or slides, but not all of the classrooms
have projection facilities. For ex
ample, an art class with 240 students
could not be moved to Dinkelspiel be
cause slides of pictures had to be
shown and Dinkelspiel doesn't have
an adequate screen.
Occasionally professors will reject
classrooms because they are too large.
One English instructor turned down a
chance to move his class into Cub
berley Auditorium for this reason. A

Biology professor also refused Cub
berley because the blackboards are
too small.
All of these problems add up to a
five-day headache for Mrs. E d e 11.
Sometimes, during the first week of
the quarter, she has to work on the
weekends to untangle the confusion.
Pre-Reg Lists
Preregistration sign-up lists usually
solve most of the problems, she said,
but they are not the final solution.
Psychology 60, a required course, had
to be expanded at the last minute to

allow students to finish their majors
and General Studies requirements.
"There are no big problems in room
scheduling, just little problems," ac
cording to the lady who helps Mrs.
Edeli during the busiest times of the
quarter.
The largest classroom in the Uni
versity is Memorial Auditorium, which
seats 1739. Dinkelspiel holds 719 and
Cubberley has 500 seats.
The smallest is room 39 in the Grad
uate School of Business, which can
seat no more than eight students.
In the inner recesses of the Quad
is an office that helps keep Stanford
running.
And it's not the President's Office,
the registrar's computer, or even the
Board of Trustees.
It's the Room Scheduling Office.
Mrs. Henrietta Edeli, the Room
Scheduling secretary, is responsible
for room assignments for most of
the University's classes. Yesterday
was one of the most hectic of the
quarter for her, but today she will
start on the room scheduling for
spring quarter.
Mrs. Edeli was kept busy from 8 a.m
to 5 p.m. yesterday—as soon as she
put the phone down, it rang again.
She settled the problems of scores of
classes, including an art class in
which 155 students showed up unex
pectedly.
146 Classrooms
There are only 146 classrooms at
Stanford, and Mrs. Edeli is respon
sible, directly and indirectly, for 118
of them. The rest are scheduled by
the departments which "control them,"
in the jargon of the Registrar's Of
fice. Fifty classrooms are always
scheduled by the Registrar's office and
the other 68 are controlled by various
departments unless there are vacan
cies.
The Room Scheduling Office is one
of the most efficient of all the Uni
versity's bureaucracy. One wall is cov
ered with a file containing the number
of each room and its seating capacity.
On the reverse side of the card, each
day of the week and the hours of the
day, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., are blocked
out.
Because special classes are occasion

ally scheduled, the schedule for a
room must cover every week of the

Sometimes, during the first week of
the quarter, she has to work on the
weekends to untangle the confusion.
Pre-Reg Lists
Preregistration sign-up lists usually
solve most of the problems, she said,
but they are not the final solution.
Psychology 60, a required course, had
to be expanded at the last minute to

allow students to finish their majors
and General Studies requirements.
"There are no big problems in room
scheduling, just little problems," ac
cording to the lady who helps Mrs.
Edeli during the busiest times of the
quarter.
The largest classroom in the Uni
versity is Memorial Auditorium, which
seats 1739. Dinkelspiel holds 719 and
Cubberley has 500 seats.
The smallest is room 39 in the Grad
uate School of Business, which can
seat no more than eight students.
In the inner recesses of the Quad
is an office that helps keep Stanford
running.
And it's not the President's Office,
the registrar's computer, or even the
Board of Trustees.
It's the Room Scheduling Office.
Mrs. Henrietta Edeli, the Room
Scheduling secretary, is responsible
for room assignments for most of
the University's classes. Yesterday
was one of the most hectic of the
quarter for her, but today she will
start on the room scheduling for
spring quarter.
Mrs. Edeli was kept busy from 8 a.m
to 5 p.m. yesterday—as soon as she
put the phone down, it rang again.
She settled the problems of scores of
classes, including an art class in
which 155 students showed up unex
pectedly.
146 Classrooms
There are only 146 classrooms at
Stanford, and Mrs. Edeli is respon
sible, directly and indirectly, for 118
of them. The rest are scheduled by
the departments which "control them,"
in the jargon of the Registrar's Of
fice. Fifty classrooms are always
scheduled by the Registrar's office and
the other 68 are controlled by various
departments unless there are vacan
cies.
The Room Scheduling Office is one
of the most efficient of all the Uni
versity's bureaucracy. One wall is cov
ered with a file containing the number
of each room and its seating capacity.
On the reverse side of the card, each
day of the week and the hours of the
day, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., are blocked
out.
Because special classes are occasion

ally scheduled, the schedule for a
room must cover every week of the
quarter. It all appears confusing at
first, but Mrs. Edeli's familiarity with
available classroom space speeds up
the process.
Spring Quarter
And once the scheduling problems
are solved for this quarter, work will
begin on spring quarter. The next
Time Schedule will go to press Jan
uary 17. Room Scheduling will have a
week to assign spaces and type a
final draft of the Schedule.
The work is never really done for
Mrs. Edeli, for once she finishes the
Time Schedule, she will make out a
new wall file for all the spring quar
ter classes. Then the proofreading and
new changes will have to be made in
the Time Schedule. Before she knows
it, spring quarter will be here and the
momumental shuffle will be on again.
Five-way Switch
Many problems can be solved by
simply switching one classroom with
another, but occasionally, for one rea
son or another, other classes will also
have to be changed. "I'm making a
five-way switch right now," Mrs.
Edeli said, as she juggles her files.
Some classes need to show movies
or slides, but not all of the classrooms
have projection facilities. For ex
ample, an art class with 240 students
could not be moved to Dinkelspiel be
cause slides of pictures had to be
shown and Dinkelspiel doesn't have
an adequate screen.
Occasionally professors will reject
classrooms because they are too large.
One English instructor turned down a
chance to move his class into Cub
berley Auditorium for this reason. A

Biology professor also refused Cub
berley because the blackboards are
too small.
All of these problems add up to a
five-day headache for Mrs. E d e 11.
Sometimes, during the first week of
the quarter, she has to work on the
weekends to untangle the confusion.
