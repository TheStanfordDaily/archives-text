# Faculty To Investigate Research
## 
### 
A continuous, case-by-case review
of new proposals for classified re
search on campus has been inaugu
rated by the Academic Council, Ac
cording to Professor William F. Bax
ter of the Law School.
Baxter heads the Academic Council
Committee on Research Policy that
recommended this policy change.
When his committee was formed last
June, the Council handled classified
research in a different manner.
Faculty Obligations
At that time, the Council imposed
an obligation on individual faculty
members who plan to engage in
classified research 1) to exercise judg
ment on whether classification is jus
tified; 2) to oppose classification if in
their view it is unjustified; and 3) to
refuse to enter into contracts if the
government unreasonably persists in
requiring classification.
In the committee's report to the
Academic Council, Baxter said that
the committee felt that reviews should
not be limited to existing projects
but should include the "review of pro
posals before they ripened into ex
ecuted contracts."
New Subcommittee
The employment practices of the
/University for research associates,
research physicists, and economists is
also under review by a newly estab
lished subcommittee to the Committee
on Research Policy.
Headed by Professor Nathaniel
Gage of the Education School, the
committee will probably recommend,
according to Baxter, "the adoption of
a set of procedures by the University
involving periodic review of the em
ployment status of these research per
sonnel."
