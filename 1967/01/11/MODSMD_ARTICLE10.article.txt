### 
"The American war in Vietnam has
made virtually no impact on the pri
vate sector of American society,"
concluded Dr. James Roose in a lec
ture given last night in Tresidder
Large Lounge to a large audience of
students.
As the first in a series of lectures
dealing with current issues in eco
nomics sponsored by the Undergrad
uate Club in Economics, the discus
sion centered around Roose's lecture
on the effects of the war on Ameri
can economy up to the present, and
another speech by Dr. Robert Coen,
concerning the future economy.
Roose compared the economies of
the United States in World War 11,
the Korean War and the present war
in Vietnam. In making conclusions
from his graphs, Roose pointed out a
less-pronounced impact on govern
ment spending, price rise, the private
sector and the Gross National Prod
uct than in the two previous wars.
Coen also emphasized that the war
has not caused a great economic bur
den. He felt that other considerations
were more important than the mate
rial aspects of the war, such as spiri
tual resources and lives. "In the fu
ture the major issue will not be the
war but the production of an anti
missile missile," he said.
