• Thant Challenges U.S.
UNITED NATIONS, N. Y.—U.N. Secretary-
General U Thant challenged yesterday the
United States' Basic Arguments for its mili
tary involvement in South Vietnam.
At a news conference, he denied (1) that
the Viet Cong are stooges of communist North
Vietnam, (2) that if South Vietnam fell to the
communists neighboring countries would fol
low and (3) that South Vietnam was vital to
western security.
He also pressed the United States once more
to stop bombing North Vietnam. He said, "I
feel very strongly that there will be no move
towards peace so long as the bombing of
North Vietnam is going on. He added that if

such bombing stopped unconditionally, "I feel
hopeful that there will be a definite move

principle to Hanoi's previously announced
four points would establish conditions for ne

"What is meant by agreement in principle?
Either the United States does it or does not
do it. Our four points can be basically reduced

The multi-division operation has so far re

Chi Minh of North Vietnam was quoted in
an interview today as saying "If the U.S.A.
is prepared to give up its policy of aggression
and to withdraw its troops from Vietnam, we
will gladly invite them to tea."
Throughout the interview, Ho stressed the
withdrawal of American forces as a condition
for peace talks, said reporter Egon Lutz in a

principle to Hanoi's previously announced

Either the United States does it or does not

WASHINGTON —Rep. Adam Clayton
Powell was denied his seat in Congress yes
terday until a special committee passes on his
qualifications and the House approves them.
The harsh punishment for Harlem's preach
er-politician was meted out by his colleagues
-on the opening day of the 90th Congress by a
vote of 364 to 64.
While hundreds of Negroes milled around
outside the capitol shouting "We want
Powell," the House rejected a leadership plan
to soften the blow and took action that could
end Powell's 22-year Congressional career.
Powell, who was stripped of his committee
chairmanship by House Democrats Monday,
stalked out of the House chamber when it
was obvious the roll call was running against
him.
He continues on the Congressional payroll,
and his office staff also will be paid for the
next five weeks, the time expected to be re
quired for the special inquiry.

should elect.
The vote was Maddox 182, Callaway 66, with
11 legislators abstaining.
