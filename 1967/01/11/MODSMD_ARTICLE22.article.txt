ography, (Charles Scribner's

"Well, maybe I would have be
come famous if only I had
struck to organic chemistry."
Thus Nobel Laureate Otto Hahn
looks back somewhat wryly, but
with unmistakable pride, on his
doctoral thesis. The same sort
of pride in work well done and
well-worth doing characterizes
his account of forty years of
study and experimentation with
radioactivity.
Hahn considers his Involve
ment in the field of radioactivity
to have been largely a matter
of luck. A German chemical firm
was offering an attractive posi
tion for a chemist who had
lived for a year or so in a for
eign country. Hahn, who had
never left his native Germany,
decided to go to England to
fulfill this foreign residence re
quirement.
Intense Radioisotope
While there, from the fall of
1904 to the summer of 1905, he
worked with Sir William Ram
say, who was dabbling with ra
dioactive substances. Hahn hap
pened onto a new radioisotope
which had a radiation intensity
100,000 times greater than the
same quantity of thorium.
Ramsay, pleased with Hahn's

results, advised him to pursue re
search in radioactivity rather
than an industrial career, and he
recommended him for a position
with the Chemical Institute of
Berlin, directed at that time by
the distinguished organic chem
ist Emil Fischer.
Hahn felt, however, that he
needed to spend a year getting
a sound background in theory
and methods of radioactivity.
Consequently, he went to McGill
University in Montreal, where
he worked under Professor Ern
est Rutherford.
Chaos Of New Field
In 1906 he returned to Ger
many to work in the Chemical
Institute. Hahn's description of
his struggles to identify, analyze,
and make some order out of
the radioactive substances he
was investigating in this period
constitutes an excellent picture
scientific field.
Hahn and his associates fol
lowed up their dramatic finding
that after neutron bombard
ment the heavy uranium nu
cleus breaks up with six years
of amazing intensive work at
isolating and identifying radio
active products of the fission
process. Not even the bombing
of their facilities at the Kaiser
Wilhelm Institute deterred them.
They moved the equipment
that could be salvaged to syn

thetio fibers plants and kept
making tests up to the time they
were taken prisoners and trans
ported to England by American
occupation forces. In 1945, while
still being detained in Britain,
Hahn was awarded the Nobel
Prize for Chemistry for the year
1944.
VLimited Autobiography
Hahn writes his account with
the ll'orce and precision of a
man completely on top of his
field i ind in so doing provides an
excellent overview of the early
work in radioactivity. The iso
lated findings, the misinterpreta
tions,, the solutions, and the
rapidly changing methods em
ployed are all linked together to
reveal the largely logical ad
vance of radiochemical knowl
edge.
Perhaps most importantly
Hahm provides a chronicle of in
sighl: as he records the reason
ing lie employed in interpreting
raw data, in using the patterns
obtained to design other experi
ments, and in relating seeming
ly separate phenomena.
One wishes, however, that
Hahn had not drawn the limits
of his "scientific autobiography"
so narrowly. His personal life
seldc im enters into the work.
He dismisses his childhood and
formal education with a few re
marks and mentions only some
scattered personal incidents in
his Inter life.
On e of the latter involved Fritz
Habt r, probably best known for
his process of synthesizing am
moni a, and constituted a notable
instance of minor resistance to
thee arly Hitler regime.
Haloer, being Jewish, had been
put Kinder duress to resign his
post as director of the Kaiser
WilhtS'lm Institute. He left Ger
many and died shortly there
after. Now, a year later, mem
bers of the Institute were plan
ning a memorial service. The
Hi tier government made known
its displeasure with this cere
monj' proposed to honor a non-
Aryatl, and it issued an edict for
bidding any chemist under gov
ernment jurisdiction to partici
pate. Despite this and later warn
ings, the service went off as
scheduled and was well-attended
by both academic and Industrial
chemi.sts.
If Hahn the man had been
allowed to complement Hahn
the chemist in the autobiogra
phy, a. valuable scientific docu
ment might also have been an
instructive portrait of creative
men ait work in one of the most
academically and politically tur
bulent'. periods of history.
