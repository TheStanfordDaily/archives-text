## HAMBURG, 1918 Fall Of Socialism Helped Hitler Most 
### BOB FISHMAN 
Revolutionary Hamburg, Rich
ard Comfort, (Stanford Univer
sity) $6.
On November 16, 1918—seven
days after socialist Philipp
Scheidemann had proclaimed
the founding of the first Ger
man Republic—another socialist,
Heinrich Laufenberg—was meet
ing with the commercial and
business "establishment" of
Hamburg.
Laufenberg had been ruling
Hamburg since November 12 as
the head of the Workers' and
Soldiers' Council which deposed
the conservative Burgerschaft
In the disorders following Ger
many's defeat
The businessmen promised to
use their personal credit to help
finance the new city govern
ment
'Advise' The Government
Since, however, they were
taking such large risks in the
interests of Hamburg, It seemed
to them only fair that they
should have some voice in de
ciding how the money would be
spent
Two days later, Laufenberg
issued a proclamation announc
ing the re-creation of the Burg
erschaft and the appointment of
several business leaders to an
"Economic Council" to "advise"
the government
This incident is a sort of para
digm of the process which Rich
ard Comfort describes in Rev
olutionary Hamburg.
The socialists, unexpectedly
thrust into power by popular
sentiment, failed to remove the
old leaders in business ani the
military from their sources of
power.
In fact, as the Laufenber g In
cident indicates, the socialists
often helped restore to power
their former oppressors.
The revolutionaries in Ham
burg and the rest of Gernany
failed because, at the moment
of opportunity, they w«»re not
revolutionary enough.

Limited Scope
In analyzing the German labor
movement's "failure of nerve"
Professor Comfort has drawn
on election returns from work
ing class districts, as well as
records from the various social
ist parties and labor unions.
His concern is exclusively
with Hamburg, and this tends
to limit the scope of his co
elusions. One wishes a chapter
at least had been devoted to the
relationship between the Ham
burg labor leaders and their
counterparts in the rest of Ger
many.
Another limitation Is the rela
tively scant attention Professor
Comfort gives to the political
philosophies of the various fac
tions in the labor movement.
Labor's "failure of nerve" was
also a "failure of ideology,"
which affected local as well as
national politics.
Insights
Nonetheless, Comfort's thor
ough analysis of working-class
voting patterns and leaders has
rewarded him with insights
which would have been lost in
a more general study.
He has found, for exampL,
that as early as 1924 "a large
portion of the working class had
rejected the Republic."
Professor Comfort makes two
groups responsible for this re
jection.
The first was the conservative
trade-union leaders and their
counterparts in the Social Dem
ocratic party who, through po
litical timidity and craft-union
bias, cut themselves off from
the great mass of industrial
workers.
The second was the Commu
nist Party, whose anti-demo
cratic doctrines and abortive at
tempts at revolution pitted
worker against worker.
Consequently, the labor move
ment—which should have been
the Republic's firmest support—
was reduced to impotence by 1-
ternal division.
As Professor Comfort points
out, this disintegration of social
ism helped Adolph Hitler most
of aIL
