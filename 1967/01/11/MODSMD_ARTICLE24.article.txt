# Silk Screen Works On Display
## 
### 
Serij graphs by Sister Mary Co
rita will be on display today
through Friday on the second
floor of Tresidder Memorial
Union.
Sister Corita is the head of the
Art Department of the Immac

culate Heart College, Los An
geles. Her unusual silk-screen
art work has been shown
throughout the United States
and the collection that will be
on display in Tresidder is soon
to be sent to Scotland.
Serigraphs are produced en

tirely by hand by an artist in his
own studio and are actually
"stencil" prints. They are issued
by the artist in restricted, signed
editions.
Sister Corita uses silk screen
techniques and assembles scraps
of texts and shapes and colors.
