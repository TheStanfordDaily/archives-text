SACRAMENTO (AP) — Governor
Reagan said yesterday he believes in
the general idea of tuition for higher
education, but insisted he hasn't
reached a final decision on whether it
should imposed for the first time in
California.
How to pay for the top level of the
state's most expensive item—educa
tion—continued to bedevil the new
governor and his finance director, Gor
don P. Smith.
Reagan outlined his thinking on the
matter at the first news conference he
has held since taking office.
Alternative To Study
He again pointed to the deficit of

about $475 million between income
and expenditure that he must make
up in the budget for the year starting
July 1.
The new chief executive said one
method of helping solve the puzzle
would be to cut state aid to the nine
campuses of the University of Cali*
fornia and the 18 state colleges. A
tuition charge of some short could
then be imposed and "there would be
no overall cut in what they spent," he
said.
But, Reagan stressed, no flat de
cision has been made to do this. He
called it only "an alternative for us
to study. . .

Reagan said he had hoped that edu
cation officials —who have criticized
possible tuition or cuts in their funds
—"would probably be better able than
some others to see the need" for
clashes in state spending.
He noted that the deficit is a huge
one ,and "if we cannot meet the
deficit with the economies alone then
we are going to have to seek revenue
in other directions. Other directions
would mean taxes."
Asked his general feeling toward
the idea of tuition, the governor re
marked "it is my own personal view
that there is no such thing as 'free
education' ... I think there is nothing
wrong with the young people begin
ning to have a responsibility with re
gard to at least a portion of this cost."
Regents Meeting
Smith, at a later meeting with news
men, also stressed that the idea of tui
tion isn't just one of helping balance
the budget: it's philosophical. "From a
philosophical standpoint, a tuition of
modest amount . . . would not only be
reasonable but would be healthy. . . ."
A $400-a-year tuition fee has been
mentioned as a possibility for the
University of California, with some
what less for the state colleges.
Smith was critical of the outcome
of the meeting he held in Los An
geles Monday with the Regents. He
explained that he had hoped for a
round-table, informal discussion of
the university's spending problems,
but instead walked into an open,
crowded encounter of statements but
no discussion.
University President Clark Kerr
has said that he needed a 15 per cent
boost, to about $278 million for next

year, over the current $240 million
state aid to the university.
If that doesn't come, thousands of
students simply will be turned away
from the campuses, Kerr said after
Monday's meeting.
Assemblyman Charles Warren (D,
Los Angeles), who also is chairman
of the Democratic Party in California,
agreed. "Imposition of tuition . . .
would slam the door to a higher edu
cation for thousands of qualified and
willing young Californians whose par
ents simply could not afford the addi
tional cost,"he commented.
