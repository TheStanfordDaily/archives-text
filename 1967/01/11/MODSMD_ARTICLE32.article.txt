# Hershey: Professional Sorter
## 
### ROGER RAPOPORT Michigan Daily 
Unlike most important build
ings here, the nation's Selective
Service Headquarters does not
look like a mausoleum. Nor is it
fronted by a circle driveway
filled with double parked Cadillac
limousines.
It's all business at the draft
command post centered in a
dumpy six story brick building
just down F street from the
Moonlight Cafe.
Working out of a top floor of
fice is the world's largest person
nel director, Lt. Gen. Lewis
Blaine Hershey. He presides over
33 million American men regis
tered with 4,088 draft boards
across the country.
Hershey's office is furnished
in contemporary American Le
gion—with flags from state mi
litias, combat divisions, and Boy
Scout troops surrounding the
perimeter of the room.
Observers think that with the
possible exception of FBI Direc
tor J. Edgar Hoover, Hershey
runs the biggest one man show
in Washington.
Father Of Draft
The 73-year-old father of the
draft designed, promoted, and
now runs the nation's conscrip
tion business. A former career
soldier, Hershey began as execu
tive officer of a national Selec
tive Service committee in 1936
and was named draft director in
July 1941.

Hershey has played the major
role in boosting the nation's
armed forces from 200,000 in
1936 to today's 3 million plus
level.
Despite all this he runs an
unpretentious office. One can
call up the draft headquarters,
ask for General Hershey, and
more than likely be speaking to
him in 10 seconds. "What's the
General like?" says his secre
tary. "He's just as plain as an
old shoe."
Leaning back in his imposing
executive chair Hershey scoffs at
the notion that he is a draft
czar. He points out that all induc
tion decisions are made "by your
friends and neighbors" at your
local draft board.
The general also contends that
he doesn't change individual
draft decisions.
Too Bad, Kid
"I got a call from a friend the
other night. His son was set to
be drafted in two days. The kid
had been trying to enlist in the
Air Force for months but was
only able to move up from 68th
to 38th on the waiting list."
" 'It's pretty awful,' said the
father, 'when a boy can't serve
the country the way he wants
to.' But I just told him that this
way his son is getting a chance
to serve his country a lot
sooner," says Hershey.
Since the draft law is up for
renewal next year, many people
have been firing off salvos at

General Hershey's system. They
contend the draft penalizes the
poor, lets students hide in col
lege and disrupts the lives of
young people.
But Hershey rejects such crit
icism as he lifts his feet off the
fluffy lemon colored pile carpet
onto his mammoth desk.
"We expect that 56 per cent of
the 1.6 million college students
we are now deferring will even
tually serve. Only 40 per cent of
all non-college students will ever
serve." He adds that about "40
per cent of all college gradu
ates actually serve."
The General also contends that
it's "nonsense to cry that you
can't plan your life because of
the draft. You can volunteer any
time you want to."
Protests Wrong
The draft director hasn't been
too happy about collegiate pro
tests against his system. "I've
been pretty strong for the col
lege student," says Hershey, "but
I think he's only hurting him
self with all this rebellion. That's
not the way to get anywhere.
The best way to get change is
to work in a quiet manner, not
an antagonistic one."
The General, who grew up on
a farm near Angola, Ind., about
60 miles from Ann Arbor, shows
little concern though about re
cent demonstrations at the Uni
versity of Michigan protesting
the use of class rankings by
Selective Service.
"The college kids in Ann Ar
bor have always been playful,"

he says."I remember when I
was a kid, the circuses wouldn't
stop in Ann Arbor. The college
students would always tear the
tent down."
Hershey did voice some sym
pathy for students worried about
low class rankings. Although
the General was "valedictorian
of a class of eight at Fremont,
Ind., High School," he was "not
much of a student" at Tri-State
College in nearby Angola.
After teaching school for sev
eral years Hershey became a full
time soldier in 1916. While he
has been with the military since
1916 he has never seen combat
action.
Interest In Boys
The General is currently in
more than a dozen service
groups but his primary interest
is the Boy Scouts. He's been
president of the National Capi
tal Area Boy Scout Council since
1961. He's been honored with two
of scouting's highest awards,
the Silver Beaver and the Silver
Antelope. Hershey has a host of
other awards such as the "Min
ute Man of 1964" citation from
the Reserve Officers Association
of the U.S.
Despite the significance of his
job Hershey prefers to discount
his importance. Munching a take
out White Tower lunch of chees
burger and tea, the General con
tends his office merely supplies
the Pentagon's manpower needs.
"All we do is pick 'em, sort
'em, and send 'em."

the 1.6 million college students
we are now deferring will even
tually serve. Only 40 per cent of
all non-college students will ever
serve." He adds that about "40
per cent of all college gradu
ates actually serve."
The General also contends that
it's "nonsense to cry that you
can't plan your life because of
the draft. You can volunteer any
time you want to."
Protests Wrong
The draft director hasn't been
too happy about collegiate pro
tests against his system. "I've
been pretty strong for the col
lege student," says Hershey, "but
I think he's only hurting him
self with all this rebellion. That's
not the way to get anywhere.
The best way to get change is
to work in a quiet manner, not
an antagonistic one."
The General, who grew up on
a farm near Angola, Ind., about
60 miles from Ann Arbor, shows
little concern though about re
cent demonstrations at the Uni
versity of Michigan protesting
the use of class rankings by
Selective Service.
"The college kids in Ann Ar
bor have always been playful,"

he says."I remember when I
was a kid, the circuses wouldn't
stop in Ann Arbor. The college
students would always tear the
tent down."
Hershey did voice some sym
pathy for students worried about
low class rankings. Although
the General was "valedictorian
of a class of eight at Fremont,
Ind., High School," he was "not
much of a student" at Tri-State
College in nearby Angola.
After teaching school for sev
eral years Hershey became a full
time soldier in 1916. While he
has been with the military since
1916 he has never seen combat
action.
Interest In Boys
The General is currently in
more than a dozen service
groups but his primary interest
is the Boy Scouts. He's been
president of the National Capi
tal Area Boy Scout Council since
1961. He's been honored with two
of scouting's highest awards,
the Silver Beaver and the Silver
Antelope. Hershey has a host of
other awards such as the "Min
ute Man of 1964" citation from
the Reserve Officers Association
of the U.S.
Despite the significance of his
job Hershey prefers to discount
his importance. Munching a take
out White Tower lunch of chees
burger and tea, the General con
tends his office merely supplies
the Pentagon's manpower needs.
"All we do is pick 'em, sort
'em, and send 'em."


"DM It go away yet?"
Unlike most important build
ings here, the nation's Selective
Service Headquarters does not
look like a mausoleum. Nor is it
fronted by a circle driveway
filled with double parked Cadillac
limousines.
It's all business at the draft
command post centered in a
dumpy six story brick building
just down F street from the
Moonlight Cafe.
Working out of a top floor of
fice is the world's largest person
nel director, Lt. Gen. Lewis
Blaine Hershey. He presides over
33 million American men regis
tered with 4,088 draft boards
across the country.
Hershey's office is furnished
in contemporary American Le
gion—with flags from state mi
litias, combat divisions, and Boy
Scout troops surrounding the
perimeter of the room.
Observers think that with the
possible exception of FBI Direc
tor J. Edgar Hoover, Hershey
runs the biggest one man show
in Washington.
Father Of Draft
The 73-year-old father of the
draft designed, promoted, and
now runs the nation's conscrip
tion business. A former career
soldier, Hershey began as execu
tive officer of a national Selec
tive Service committee in 1936
and was named draft director in
July 1941.

Hershey has played the major
role in boosting the nation's
armed forces from 200,000 in
1936 to today's 3 million plus
level.
Despite all this he runs an
unpretentious office. One can
call up the draft headquarters,
ask for General Hershey, and
more than likely be speaking to
him in 10 seconds. "What's the
General like?" says his secre
tary. "He's just as plain as an
old shoe."
Leaning back in his imposing
executive chair Hershey scoffs at
the notion that he is a draft
czar. He points out that all induc
tion decisions are made "by your
friends and neighbors" at your
local draft board.
The general also contends that
he doesn't change individual
draft decisions.
Too Bad, Kid
"I got a call from a friend the
other night. His son was set to
be drafted in two days. The kid
had been trying to enlist in the
Air Force for months but was
only able to move up from 68th
to 38th on the waiting list."
" 'It's pretty awful,' said the
father, 'when a boy can't serve
the country the way he wants
to.' But I just told him that this
way his son is getting a chance
to serve his country a lot
sooner," says Hershey.
Since the draft law is up for
renewal next year, many people
have been firing off salvos at

General Hershey's system. They
contend the draft penalizes the
poor, lets students hide in col
lege and disrupts the lives of
young people.
But Hershey rejects such crit
icism as he lifts his feet off the
fluffy lemon colored pile carpet
onto his mammoth desk.
"We expect that 56 per cent of
the 1.6 million college students
we are now deferring will even
tually serve. Only 40 per cent of
all non-college students will ever
serve." He adds that about "40

Blaine Hershey. He presides over
33 million American men regis
tered with 4,088 draft boards
across the country.
Hershey's office is furnished
in contemporary American Le
gion—with flags from state mi
litias, combat divisions, and Boy
Scout troops surrounding the
perimeter of the room.
Observers think that with the
possible exception of FBI Direc
tor J. Edgar Hoover, Hershey
runs the biggest one man show
in Washington.
Father Of Draft
The 73-year-old father of the
draft designed, promoted, and
now runs the nation's conscrip
tion business. A former career
soldier, Hershey began as execu
tive officer of a national Selec
tive Service committee in 1936
and was named draft director in
July 1941.

Hershey has played the major
role in boosting the nation's
armed forces from 200,000 in
1936 to today's 3 million plus
level.
Despite all this he runs an
unpretentious office. One can
call up the draft headquarters,
ask for General Hershey, and
more than likely be speaking to
him in 10 seconds. "What's the
General like?" says his secre
tary. "He's just as plain as an
old shoe."
Leaning back in his imposing
executive chair Hershey scoffs at
the notion that he is a draft
czar. He points out that all induc
tion decisions are made "by your
friends and neighbors" at your
local draft board.
The general also contends that
he doesn't change individual
draft decisions.
Too Bad, Kid
"I got a call from a friend the
other night. His son was set to
be drafted in two days. The kid
had been trying to enlist in the
Air Force for months but was
only able to move up from 68th
to 38th on the waiting list."
" 'It's pretty awful,' said the
father, 'when a boy can't serve
the country the way he wants
to.' But I just told him that this
way his son is getting a chance
to serve his country a lot
sooner," says Hershey.
Since the draft law is up for
renewal next year, many people
have been firing off salvos at

General Hershey's system. They
contend the draft penalizes the
poor, lets students hide in col
lege and disrupts the lives of
young people.
But Hershey rejects such crit
icism as he lifts his feet off the
fluffy lemon colored pile carpet
onto his mammoth desk.
"We expect that 56 per cent of
the 1.6 million college students
we are now deferring will even
tually serve. Only 40 per cent of
all non-college students will ever
serve." He adds that about "40
per cent of all college gradu
ates actually serve."
The General also contends that
it's "nonsense to cry that you
can't plan your life because of
the draft. You can volunteer any
time you want to."
Protests Wrong
The draft director hasn't been
too happy about collegiate pro
tests against his system. "I've
been pretty strong for the col
lege student," says Hershey, "but
I think he's only hurting him
self with all this rebellion. That's
not the way to get anywhere.
The best way to get change is
to work in a quiet manner, not
an antagonistic one."
The General, who grew up on
a farm near Angola, Ind., about
60 miles from Ann Arbor, shows
little concern though about re
cent demonstrations at the Uni
versity of Michigan protesting
the use of class rankings by
Selective Service.
"The college kids in Ann Ar
bor have always been playful,"

he says."I remember when I
was a kid, the circuses wouldn't
stop in Ann Arbor. The college
students would always tear the
tent down."
Hershey did voice some sym
pathy for students worried about
low class rankings. Although
the General was "valedictorian
of a class of eight at Fremont,
Ind., High School," he was "not
much of a student" at Tri-State
College in nearby Angola.
After teaching school for sev
eral years Hershey became a full
time soldier in 1916. While he
has been with the military since
1916 he has never seen combat
action.
Interest In Boys
The General is currently in
more than a dozen service
groups but his primary interest
is the Boy Scouts. He's been
president of the National Capi
tal Area Boy Scout Council since
1961. He's been honored with two
of scouting's highest awards,
the Silver Beaver and the Silver
Antelope. Hershey has a host of
other awards such as the "Min
ute Man of 1964" citation from
the Reserve Officers Association
of the U.S.
Despite the significance of his
job Hershey prefers to discount
his importance. Munching a take
out White Tower lunch of chees
burger and tea, the General con
tends his office merely supplies
the Pentagon's manpower needs.
"All we do is pick 'em, sort
'em, and send 'em."


"DM It go away yet?"
Unlike most important build
ings here, the nation's Selective
Service Headquarters does not
look like a mausoleum. Nor is it
fronted by a circle driveway
filled with double parked Cadillac
limousines.
It's all business at the draft
command post centered in a
dumpy six story brick building
just down F street from the
Moonlight Cafe.
