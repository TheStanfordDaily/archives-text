# Draft Change: Military Thumbs Down

Collegiate Press Service
Another skirmish in the battle
over the draft briefly engaged
the nation's attention in De
cember. The 110 "experts" at a
University of Chicago conference
trundled out familiar alterna
tives and counterarguments, sur
prising observers only with the
transient coalitions they de
veloped.
Although no official consensus
was revolved—conference coordi
nators insistently avoided any
thing that smacked of voting—
several patterns seemed to
emerge among the delegates.
Voluntarism became a roost
ing place for a whole aviary of
doves, hawks, and even some
eagles. National service pro
posals met with a similarly wide
response. Both were overshad
owed, however, by the enthus
iasm which existed for several
limited modifications of the pres
ent system, including abolition of

the 11-S student deferment and
broadening of the grounds for
conscientious objection.
Other proposals were present
ed, both singly and in various
permutations and combinations,
including changes in deferment
policies, the lottery and universal
military training. There were
several brave attempts at syn
thesis, most notably that of Sen.
Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), long
a proponent of the lottery sys
tem.
Draft By Lot
Kennedy, arriving just in time
for the last session of the con
ference, suggested that the lot
tery be combined with some
form of national service which
might include seven.'l elements
of the voluntary principle. The
Senator did not, however, elab
orate on the details of such an
all-encompassing compromise.
The most revealing develop
ment for many participants was

the wide support given to the
idea of abolishing conscription
altogether. Over half of the dele
gates, including many on both
the right and the left .signed an
informal petition endorsing the
principle of voluntarism.
Milton Friedman, a professor
of economics at the University
of Chicago noted for his laissez
faire ideology, argued that the
present system of compulsion
has many effects which are "in
equitable and wasteful and in
consistent with the principles of
the free society."
Better Wages
Among these he included the
push to stay in school when
many men might want to be else
where and the underpayment of
soldiers who could earn twice as
much in civilian jobs.
To raise soldier's pay to a
sufficiently attractive level has
been estimated to cost between

five and seventeen billion dol
lars, Friedman said, though he
judged that the best estimate
probably lies between four and
eight billion.
He noted, however, that the
present system involves high in
direct costs, such as the need
for training large numbers of
new conscriptees in a system
with high turnover. This ex
pense would be cut with a stand
ing professional army, Friedman
argued.
Others objected to the fact
that the conference was "given"
the problem of supplying an
army of from 2.5 to 3.5 million
men. As one participant put It,
to him it was like "entering a
family debate on whether to go
by train, car or airplane when
one does not approve of the trip
altogether."
Conference Futile
One of the conference's most
attentive participants was Brad

Patterson, executive director of
the National Commission on Se
lective Service, which has been
studying the present system and
possible changes since it was
appointed by President Lyndon
B. Johnson last spring.
Despite Patterson's insistence
that the Commission's collective
mind is still "wide open to sug
gestions," many conference par
ticipants doubted that the Chi
cago deliberations would have
much effect on the Commission's
January report.
The military, at any rate, was
not impressed by the outcome.
Col. Dee Ingold, special assistant
to Gen. Lewis B. Hershey, direc
tor of the Selective Service Sys
tem, said the conference had
brought out nothing new and
defended the present system as
"the only one which could possi
bly fulfill all the needs of the
armed forces in the country."
