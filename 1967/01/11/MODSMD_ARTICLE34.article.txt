## Support For OFF Is Not 'Dwindling' 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
RE the headline of the OFF
story in this morning's paper.
Support is not dwindling, to
the contrary it is growing. I
see this as bad headlining. The
story does not back up the head
line. It is also untrue. I hope
this is not indicative of a delib
erate attempt to undermine us
through the press.

• Sounds Phony
Editor, The Daily:
The journalistic practice of
livening up an otherwise dull
editorial page with a fake letter
to the editor has a long and
honorable history; the outrage
ous opinions expressed therein
rarely fail to provoke an enthus
iastically hostile response. This
form of "pump priming" is at
least as old as the fiscal variety.
But this time, gentlemen, you
have gone too far. Not even the
touchiest hair-trigger radical
could take your ersatz Midwest
erner "Dehner E. Rund" serious
ly enough to be bothered writing
(or should I say "lefting") a
rebuttal. "Fort Worth Mother"
was at least subtle enough to be
interesting, and had in its favor
the circumstance that after re
cent occurrences in Texas (not
to say Vietnam) people are will
ing to believe anything bad
about Texans.
But your second effort falls
far short of the 1966 standard.
You have oversimplified your
caricature of the stereotypic
mid-American Know-nothine to
the point of complete absurdity.
You're just not going to sell
such an implausible fabrication
to the hip, alert readership of
The Daily.

Mr. Rund stated In his letter
that he was the father of a Stan
ford student. The student di
rectory does in fact Indicate this
is the case. Mr. Rund's letter
was signed, and the return ad
dress corresponded with the post

• Dead Fish
Editor, The Dally:
I want to extend my sympathy
to Stanford. I didn't realize that
you were in such a bad way in
the coaching department I hope
that things will improve for
you in the future.
It is pretty obvious that
"Coach" John Ralston figured
that someone had handed him
a basket of dead fish, and he
decided to sit in the corner
and pout about it instead of
trying to make a team out of
them. The Shriners, the West
team, and the paying public de
served something better than
that. If this is an example of
his coaching at home, then Stan
ford deserves something better.
In two weeks Duffy Daugherty
took a group of players that had
never seen each other before (at
least not in groups of more than
three or four), and made a foot
ball team out of them. But Mr.
Ralston doesn't really belong in
the same stadium with Mr.
Daugherty.

RE the headline of the OFF
story in this morning's paper.
Support is not dwindling, to
the contrary it is growing. I
see this as bad headlining. The
story does not back up the head
line. It is also untrue. I hope
this is not indicative of a delib
erate attempt to undermine us
through the press.

Editor, The Daily:
The journalistic practice of
livening up an otherwise dull
editorial page with a fake letter
to the editor has a long and
honorable history; the outrage
ous opinions expressed therein
rarely fail to provoke an enthus
iastically hostile response. This
form of "pump priming" is at
least as old as the fiscal variety.
But this time, gentlemen, you
have gone too far. Not even the
touchiest hair-trigger radical
could take your ersatz Midwest
erner "Dehner E. Rund" serious
ly enough to be bothered writing
(or should I say "lefting") a
rebuttal. "Fort Worth Mother"
was at least subtle enough to be
interesting, and had in its favor
the circumstance that after re
cent occurrences in Texas (not
to say Vietnam) people are will
ing to believe anything bad
about Texans.
But your second effort falls
far short of the 1966 standard.
You have oversimplified your
caricature of the stereotypic
mid-American Know-nothine to
the point of complete absurdity.
You're just not going to sell
such an implausible fabrication
to the hip, alert readership of
The Daily.

Editor, The Dally:
I want to extend my sympathy
to Stanford. I didn't realize that
you were in such a bad way in
the coaching department I hope
that things will improve for
you in the future.
It is pretty obvious that
"Coach" John Ralston figured
that someone had handed him
a basket of dead fish, and he
decided to sit in the corner
and pout about it instead of
trying to make a team out of
them. The Shriners, the West
team, and the paying public de
served something better than
that. If this is an example of
his coaching at home, then Stan
ford deserves something better.
In two weeks Duffy Daugherty
took a group of players that had
never seen each other before (at
least not in groups of more than
three or four), and made a foot
ball team out of them. But Mr.
Ralston doesn't really belong in
the same stadium with Mr.
Daugherty.
