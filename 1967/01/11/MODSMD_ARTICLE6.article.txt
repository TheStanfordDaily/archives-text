# Viets Question U.S. Presence

Editor's Note: Claude A. Buss, pro
fessor of history at Stanford Univer
sity, has just completed a study tour
of the Far East.

The overwhelming fact about Viet
nam today is the great American
presence. Other foreigners, even the
French, are scarcely noticeable.
American fighting men seem to be
everywhere and the highways are
jammed with their equipment. The
skies are filled with American aircraft
of every description. Thousands of
American civilians in government,
business or construction work are as
conspicuous as American soldiers.
In Saigon, American offices and
residences are guarded by uniformed
soldiers with guns loaded, drawn and
pointed at the passersby. Vietnamese
automobiles may not even stop in
front of American buildings because
of the fear of explosives. Outside of
Saigon, the entire country—from the
South China sea to the Cambodian
border and from the delta to the 17th
parallel — seems to be occupied by
Americans.
Three out of four Vietnamese still
have no idea why we are there, and
they may well believe that we are at
the root of their wretchedness. We
have difficulty in communicating with
these masses, because fewer than 100
Americans can really speak their lan
guage. Conversing through inter
preters Is unsatisfactory at best.

The next higher 20% of the people r
those in a more sophisticated bracket,
appreciate American presence be
cause they are convinced that without
it Vietnam would have gone to the
Communists in 1964 or 1965. But even
they have some peculiar ideas. They
know little about our homeland, with
its priority of national interests, po
litical rivalries and differences of
opinion. This 20% tends to think of
all Americans as making $100,000 a
month and taking to themselves as
many Vietnamese wives as they
choose.
They are inclined to make compari
sons between us and their former
French masters, but they want us to
stay whereas they wanted the French
to leave. They feel that Americans
must want territory or economic priv
ileges like the French or must use
Vietnam as a convenient base to fight
the Chinese.
Few Vietnamese—the 5% at the
top of the political and social scale —
really grasp the issues which swirl
about the American presence. This
group is remarkably ambivalent in
its reactions to American policies.
The government in power depends
for its life upon the United States but
it is not a puppet and cannot afford
to look like one. Every Vietnamese
official must go to great lengths to
appear independent and every Ameri
can must be extra careful to show
proper respect to his counterpart.

The forms of equality are essential in
every working relationship from the
very top-level down, and the hyper
sensitivity of newly-sovereign Asians
is not to be trifled with.
Inconsequential incidents often
breed suspicion. For instance, it was
asked in Saigon why did Ambassador
Henry Cabot Lodge not attend the
national day parade last Nov. 1? And,
on another occasion, why did the rep
resentative of the president of the
United States call upon the minister
of economics as well as the prime

minister? And why was the Ameri
can ambassador so tardy in support
ing the prime minister in the ousting
of Lt. Gen. Nguyen Chanh Thi dur
ing the Buddhist uprising of last
spring? Rumors circulate constantly
to the effect that the United States
does or does not intend to dump the
Ky regime in favor of a more demo
cratic government.
Government machinery thrives on
intrigue and concepts of personal
loyalty. The Saigon government feels
that nothing matters except its own
prerogatives in the conduct of the
war, so it cannot be bothered with
the forms of democracy or the guar
antees of civil liberties. Above all, it
resents bitterly any indication of
U.S. interference in its internal af
fairs.
Americans have been accused of de
siring a Mac Arthur-type pro-consul
ship with an American general in
command and with the politicians as
his advisers. It is the height of naiv
ete to think that the Vietnamese
would reconcile themselves to a 10-
or 25-year American occupation, or
to the establishment of any military
government without precise provi
sions for its passing.
'The Other War'
Not many in the Vietnamese gov
ernment see eye to eye with Presi
dent Johnson on pacification, or "the
other war." They do not feel that
