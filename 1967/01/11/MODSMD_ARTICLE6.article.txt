# Viets Question U.S. Presence

Editor's Note: Claude A. Buss, pro
fessor of history at Stanford Univer
sity, has just completed a study tour
of the Far East.

The overwhelming fact about Viet
nam today is the great American
presence. Other foreigners, even the
French, are scarcely noticeable.
American fighting men seem to be
everywhere and the highways are
jammed with their equipment. The
skies are filled with American aircraft
of every description. Thousands of
American civilians in government,
business or construction work are as
conspicuous as American soldiers.
In Saigon, American offices and
residences are guarded by uniformed
soldiers with guns loaded, drawn and
pointed at the passersby. Vietnamese
automobiles may not even stop in
front of American buildings because
of the fear of explosives. Outside of
Saigon, the entire country—from the
South China sea to the Cambodian
border and from the delta to the 17th
parallel — seems to be occupied by
Americans.
Three out of four Vietnamese still
have no idea why we are there, and
they may well believe that we are at
the root of their wretchedness. We
have difficulty in communicating with
these masses, because fewer than 100
Americans can really speak their lan
guage. Conversing through inter
preters Is unsatisfactory at best.

The next higher 20% of the people r
those in a more sophisticated bracket,
appreciate American presence be
cause they are convinced that without
it Vietnam would have gone to the
Communists in 1964 or 1965. But even
they have some peculiar ideas. They
know little about our homeland, with
its priority of national interests, po
litical rivalries and differences of
opinion. This 20% tends to think of
all Americans as making $100,000 a
month and taking to themselves as
many Vietnamese wives as they
choose.
They are inclined to make compari
sons between us and their former
French masters, but they want us to
stay whereas they wanted the French
to leave. They feel that Americans
must want territory or economic priv
ileges like the French or must use
Vietnam as a convenient base to fight
the Chinese.
Few Vietnamese—the 5% at the
top of the political and social scale —
really grasp the issues which swirl
about the American presence. This
group is remarkably ambivalent in
its reactions to American policies.
The government in power depends
for its life upon the United States but
it is not a puppet and cannot afford
to look like one. Every Vietnamese
official must go to great lengths to
appear independent and every Ameri
can must be extra careful to show
proper respect to his counterpart.

The forms of equality are essential in
every working relationship from the
very top-level down, and the hyper
sensitivity of newly-sovereign Asians
is not to be trifled with.
Inconsequential incidents often
breed suspicion. For instance, it was
asked in Saigon why did Ambassador
Henry Cabot Lodge not attend the
national day parade last Nov. 1? And,
on another occasion, why did the rep
resentative of the president of the
United States call upon the minister
of economics as well as the prime

minister? And why was the Ameri
can ambassador so tardy in support
ing the prime minister in the ousting
of Lt. Gen. Nguyen Chanh Thi dur
ing the Buddhist uprising of last
spring? Rumors circulate constantly
to the effect that the United States
does or does not intend to dump the
Ky regime in favor of a more demo
cratic government.
Government machinery thrives on
intrigue and concepts of personal
loyalty. The Saigon government feels
that nothing matters except its own
prerogatives in the conduct of the
war, so it cannot be bothered with
the forms of democracy or the guar
antees of civil liberties. Above all, it
resents bitterly any indication of
U.S. interference in its internal af
fairs.
Americans have been accused of de
siring a Mac Arthur-type pro-consul
ship with an American general in
command and with the politicians as
his advisers. It is the height of naiv
ete to think that the Vietnamese
would reconcile themselves to a 10-
or 25-year American occupation, or
to the establishment of any military
government without precise provi
sions for its passing.
'The Other War'
Not many in the Vietnamese gov
ernment see eye to eye with Presi
dent Johnson on pacification, or "the
other war." They do not feel that


CLAUDE A. BUSS
revolutionary development" is a
timely concept and they even
translate the phrase into Vietna
mese as "rural construction."
They are not disposed to put
promising young soldiers into
civic action and they are skepti
cal about the pressures exerted
by Americans on behalf of the
villagers. Nor do the Vietna
mese share the deep American
concern for the welfare and po
litical re-education of the refu
gees. Vietnamese officials de
pend almost entirely on the
Americans for the conduct of
the psychological battle for the
hearts and minds of the people.
The Saigon government dis
agrees with the Americans on
the treatment of the Montag
nards, the tribesmen in the hill
country of central Vietnam. Sai
gon looks down upon the Mon
tagnards but Americans con
sider them good anti-Commu
nist fighters. The Montagnards
have their own political organi
zation, United Front for the
Liberated Races (FULRO),
which enjoys at least tacit U.S.
support. They would be the last
people to want the Americans to
leave Vietnam. Thanks largely
to American help, they have ob
tained from Saigon specific
promises of better treatment in
education, landholding and gov
ernment jobs. They have been
given permission to have their
own tribal court system and
their own fighting units with
their own flag. Three represen
tatives of the Montagnards were
elected in September to the Con
stituent Assembly.

The militarization of Vietnam
has a peculiar psychological ef
fect on the Vietnamese and on
most other Asians. The military
(neither ours nor theirs) does
not have a high place in local
social values, and oldtime Chi
nese-style generals were re
spected scholars. The present
crop of Vietnamese generals
was embarrassingly associated
with French imperialism. Our
dollars and guns may create a
strongman, but they will never
create a pillar of Vietnamese so
ciety. It makes little sense to see
a young man elevated to the
prime ministry chiefly because
he knows how to fly a plane.
What Ky Wants
The prime minister, Nguyen
Cao Ky, has his own ideas about
how to conduct the war. He is a
reflection of Chiang Kai-shek or
Syngman Rhee and he will tol
erate no compromise with com
munism. He sees the real enemy
as Communist China "with its
policy of aggression, expansion
and domination." He wants all
out war and complete victory
over North Vietnam and China.
He is mum on the subject of
what to do about Russia, but he
stresses that the military help
to Hanoi comes from Moscow
and not Peking.
Saigon officialdom has its own
highly individualistic views
about the end of the war. "Ne
gotiations" is a dirty word, and
Ky says under no circumstances
will he negotiate with the crimi
nals and murderers of the Na
tional Liberation Front. A Ge
neva conference is out and so
are negotiations for unification
with the north until the south
becomes convincingly stronger.
As Ky indicated at Manila, he
wants nothing diplomatically
from his allies except full sup
port for his own position. If
ever a peace offensive should
be launched, it should come
from Saigon and not from
Americans running around the
world.

Turning from the government
to non-official spokesmen for
Vietnamese attitudes towards
American policies, one is limited
to doctors, lawyers, business
men, newspaper people, stu
dents and religious leaders who
feel free to talk. It is clear that
Vietnamese are not yet caught
up in the fervor of ultra-nation
alism, nor is there a concerted
demand for economic and social
reform. These matters are
bound to intensify with the ces
sation of hostilities.
Conservative professional and
business leaders are cautious
and see their only hope for a
better future in a long period
of assistance from the United
States. They are proud, like
their officials, and they too will
insist upon all the amenities of
dignity, self-respect and equality
in American-Vietnamese rela
tions.
Students are most volatile in
their anti-foreignism and most
easily persuaded to demonstra
tions. They profess a very ele
mentary kind of Marxism,
steeped in anti-capitalism and
anti- imperialism. They are
cowed temporarily by the threat
of the draft and they take ref
uge in their books and the quest
for scholarships to the United
States.
The Buddhists are so divided
that generalizations must be
considered with extreme care.
The best-known leaders are anti-
Ky, anti-United States and anti
war, but they are also basically
anti-Communist. Some describe
the current situation as "worse
than under the French, or worse
than under Ngo Dinh Diem."
Three years of struggle have
split the politically-m in d e d
Buddhist leaders into militants
and moderates, with the latter
favoring compromise with the
government and currently in the
saddle.
Goals of Buddhists
The goals of the Buddhists
are independence, democracy,

social reform and peace. Most
leaders are not all-out pacifists
and they would prefer to fight
rather than surrender their be
liefs to communism. On the oth
er hand, many would prefer
compromise with the Commu
nists to what they consider as
"ignominious puppetry in the
hands of American militarists."
Some call for a Buddhist
united front, and others go so
far as to advocate a religious
united front, to be made up of
Buddhists, Catholics, Hoa Hao
and Cao Dai. A Saigon govern
ment, based on religion and not
militarism, could then approach
the National Liberation Front
in the interest of a coalition for
South Vietnam.
When I asked one Buddhist
leader if this were practical, he
replied, "Certainly." He rea
soned that the appeal of religion
compared to communism was
like "sunshine and moonlight"
and the stronger would over
come. It was his feeling that
southerners in the NLF were
not Communists to begin with
and still are not stooges of Ha
noi. He said "they were driven
to communism by the war, and
they will be won from commu
nism with the return of peace."
Burning- Question
A few respected, intellectually
competent "spokesmen for the
common people" speak frankly
of the harm we are doing to
their country in spite of our
great pretensions. I was asked
repeatedly: "Why do you have
to occupy our country, burn our
villages and drop bombs on our
people" and "Why do you insist
on fighting the war your way
when you have not found the
key to victory or to peace?" I
was told that U.S. activities put
30 innocent civilians into the
hospital for every one wounded
by the Viet Cong and that out
of 100 reported casualties no
more than 10 were actually Viet
Cong.
The burning question in the
hearts of thoughtful, loyal (but
anti-Ky) Vietnamese is "Will
you Americans do as much for
rebuilding and development as
you are doing in destruction?"
The most solid elements In
Vietnamese society feel a deep
ening sense of frustration and
despair.

Ky, anti-United States and anti

Goals of Buddhists
The goals of the Buddhists
are independence, democracy,

social reform and peace. Most
leaders are not all-out pacifists
and they would prefer to fight
rather than surrender their be
liefs to communism. On the oth
er hand, many would prefer
compromise with the Commu
nists to what they consider as
"ignominious puppetry in the
hands of American militarists."
Some call for a Buddhist
united front, and others go so
far as to advocate a religious
united front, to be made up of
Buddhists, Catholics, Hoa Hao
and Cao Dai. A Saigon govern
ment, based on religion and not
militarism, could then approach
the National Liberation Front
in the interest of a coalition for
South Vietnam.
When I asked one Buddhist
leader if this were practical, he
replied, "Certainly." He rea
soned that the appeal of religion
compared to communism was
like "sunshine and moonlight"
and the stronger would over
come. It was his feeling that
southerners in the NLF were
not Communists to begin with
and still are not stooges of Ha
noi. He said "they were driven
to communism by the war, and
they will be won from commu
nism with the return of peace."
Burning- Question
A few respected, intellectually
competent "spokesmen for the
common people" speak frankly
of the harm we are doing to
their country in spite of our
great pretensions. I was asked
repeatedly: "Why do you have
to occupy our country, burn our
villages and drop bombs on our
people" and "Why do you insist
on fighting the war your way
when you have not found the
key to victory or to peace?" I
was told that U.S. activities put
30 innocent civilians into the
hospital for every one wounded
by the Viet Cong and that out
of 100 reported casualties no
more than 10 were actually Viet
Cong.
The burning question in the
hearts of thoughtful, loyal (but
anti-Ky) Vietnamese is "Will
you Americans do as much for
rebuilding and development as
you are doing in destruction?"
The most solid elements In
Vietnamese society feel a deep
ening sense of frustration and
despair.

The overwhelming fact about Viet
nam today is the great American
presence. Other foreigners, even the
French, are scarcely noticeable.
American fighting men seem to be
everywhere and the highways are
jammed with their equipment. The
skies are filled with American aircraft
of every description. Thousands of
American civilians in government,
business or construction work are as
conspicuous as American soldiers.
In Saigon, American offices and
residences are guarded by uniformed
soldiers with guns loaded, drawn and
pointed at the passersby. Vietnamese
automobiles may not even stop in

of the fear of explosives. Outside of
Saigon, the entire country—from the
South China sea to the Cambodian
border and from the delta to the 17th
parallel — seems to be occupied by
Americans.
Three out of four Vietnamese still
have no idea why we are there, and
they may well believe that we are at
the root of their wretchedness. We
have difficulty in communicating with
these masses, because fewer than 100
Americans can really speak their lan

those in a more sophisticated bracket,
appreciate American presence be

it Vietnam would have gone to the

they have some peculiar ideas. They
know little about our homeland, with
its priority of national interests, po
litical rivalries and differences of
opinion. This 20% tends to think of
all Americans as making $100,000 a
month and taking to themselves as
many Vietnamese wives as they
choose.
They are inclined to make compari
sons between us and their former
French masters, but they want us to
stay whereas they wanted the French
to leave. They feel that Americans
must want territory or economic priv
ileges like the French or must use
Vietnam as a convenient base to fight
the Chinese.
Few Vietnamese—the 5% at the
top of the political and social scale —
really grasp the issues which swirl
about the American presence. This
group is remarkably ambivalent in
its reactions to American policies.
The government in power depends
for its life upon the United States but
it is not a puppet and cannot afford
to look like one. Every Vietnamese
official must go to great lengths to
appear independent and every Ameri

proper respect to his counterpart.

The forms of equality are essential in
every working relationship from the

Inconsequential incidents often

of economics as well as the prime

minister? And why was the Ameri

of Lt. Gen. Nguyen Chanh Thi dur

to the effect that the United States
does or does not intend to dump the

cratic government.
Government machinery thrives on
intrigue and concepts of personal

that nothing matters except its own
prerogatives in the conduct of the

the forms of democracy or the guar

resents bitterly any indication of
U.S. interference in its internal af

Americans have been accused of de

his advisers. It is the height of naiv
ete to think that the Vietnamese
would reconcile themselves to a 10-
or 25-year American occupation, or
to the establishment of any military
government without precise provi
sions for its passing.
'The Other War'
Not many in the Vietnamese gov
ernment see eye to eye with Presi
dent Johnson on pacification, or "the
other war." They do not feel that


CLAUDE A. BUSS
revolutionary development" is a
timely concept and they even
translate the phrase into Vietna
mese as "rural construction."
They are not disposed to put
promising young soldiers into
civic action and they are skepti
cal about the pressures exerted
by Americans on behalf of the
villagers. Nor do the Vietna
mese share the deep American
concern for the welfare and po
litical re-education of the refu
gees. Vietnamese officials de
pend almost entirely on the
Americans for the conduct of
the psychological battle for the
hearts and minds of the people.
The Saigon government dis
agrees with the Americans on
the treatment of the Montag
nards, the tribesmen in the hill
country of central Vietnam. Sai
gon looks down upon the Mon
tagnards but Americans con
sider them good anti-Commu
nist fighters. The Montagnards
have their own political organi
zation, United Front for the
Liberated Races (FULRO),
which enjoys at least tacit U.S.
support. They would be the last
people to want the Americans to
leave Vietnam. Thanks largely
to American help, they have ob
tained from Saigon specific
promises of better treatment in
education, landholding and gov
ernment jobs. They have been
given permission to have their
own tribal court system and
their own fighting units with
their own flag. Three represen
tatives of the Montagnards were
elected in September to the Con
stituent Assembly.

The militarization of Vietnam
has a peculiar psychological ef
fect on the Vietnamese and on
most other Asians. The military
(neither ours nor theirs) does
not have a high place in local
social values, and oldtime Chi
nese-style generals were re
spected scholars. The present
crop of Vietnamese generals
was embarrassingly associated
with French imperialism. Our
dollars and guns may create a
strongman, but they will never
create a pillar of Vietnamese so
ciety. It makes little sense to see
a young man elevated to the
prime ministry chiefly because
he knows how to fly a plane.
What Ky Wants
The prime minister, Nguyen
Cao Ky, has his own ideas about
how to conduct the war. He is a
reflection of Chiang Kai-shek or
Syngman Rhee and he will tol
erate no compromise with com
munism. He sees the real enemy
as Communist China "with its
policy of aggression, expansion
and domination." He wants all
out war and complete victory
over North Vietnam and China.
He is mum on the subject of
what to do about Russia, but he
stresses that the military help
to Hanoi comes from Moscow
and not Peking.
Saigon officialdom has its own
highly individualistic views
about the end of the war. "Ne
gotiations" is a dirty word, and
Ky says under no circumstances
will he negotiate with the crimi
nals and murderers of the Na
tional Liberation Front. A Ge
neva conference is out and so
are negotiations for unification
with the north until the south
becomes convincingly stronger.
As Ky indicated at Manila, he
wants nothing diplomatically
from his allies except full sup
port for his own position. If
ever a peace offensive should
be launched, it should come
from Saigon and not from
Americans running around the
world.

Turning from the government
to non-official spokesmen for
Vietnamese attitudes towards
American policies, one is limited
to doctors, lawyers, business
men, newspaper people, stu
dents and religious leaders who
feel free to talk. It is clear that
Vietnamese are not yet caught
up in the fervor of ultra-nation
alism, nor is there a concerted
demand for economic and social
reform. These matters are
bound to intensify with the ces
sation of hostilities.
Conservative professional and
business leaders are cautious
and see their only hope for a
better future in a long period
of assistance from the United
States. They are proud, like
their officials, and they too will
insist upon all the amenities of
dignity, self-respect and equality
in American-Vietnamese rela
tions.
Students are most volatile in
their anti-foreignism and most
easily persuaded to demonstra
tions. They profess a very ele
mentary kind of Marxism,
steeped in anti-capitalism and
anti- imperialism. They are
cowed temporarily by the threat
of the draft and they take ref
uge in their books and the quest
for scholarships to the United
States.

The militarization of Vietnam
has a peculiar psychological ef
fect on the Vietnamese and on
most other Asians. The military
(neither ours nor theirs) does
not have a high place in local
social values, and oldtime Chi
nese-style generals were re
spected scholars. The present
crop of Vietnamese generals
was embarrassingly associated
with French imperialism. Our
dollars and guns may create a
strongman, but they will never
create a pillar of Vietnamese so
ciety. It makes little sense to see
a young man elevated to the
prime ministry chiefly because
he knows how to fly a plane.
What Ky Wants
The prime minister, Nguyen
Cao Ky, has his own ideas about
how to conduct the war. He is a
reflection of Chiang Kai-shek or
Syngman Rhee and he will tol
erate no compromise with com
munism. He sees the real enemy
as Communist China "with its
policy of aggression, expansion
and domination." He wants all
out war and complete victory
over North Vietnam and China.
He is mum on the subject of
what to do about Russia, but he
stresses that the military help
to Hanoi comes from Moscow
and not Peking.
Saigon officialdom has its own
highly individualistic views
about the end of the war. "Ne
gotiations" is a dirty word, and
Ky says under no circumstances
will he negotiate with the crimi
nals and murderers of the Na
tional Liberation Front. A Ge
neva conference is out and so
are negotiations for unification
with the north until the south
becomes convincingly stronger.
As Ky indicated at Manila, he
wants nothing diplomatically
from his allies except full sup
port for his own position. If
ever a peace offensive should
be launched, it should come
from Saigon and not from
Americans running around the
world.

Turning from the government
to non-official spokesmen for
Vietnamese attitudes towards
American policies, one is limited
to doctors, lawyers, business
men, newspaper people, stu
dents and religious leaders who
feel free to talk. It is clear that
Vietnamese are not yet caught
up in the fervor of ultra-nation
alism, nor is there a concerted
demand for economic and social
reform. These matters are
bound to intensify with the ces
sation of hostilities.
Conservative professional and
business leaders are cautious
and see their only hope for a
better future in a long period
of assistance from the United
States. They are proud, like
their officials, and they too will
insist upon all the amenities of
dignity, self-respect and equality
in American-Vietnamese rela
tions.
Students are most volatile in
their anti-foreignism and most
easily persuaded to demonstra
tions. They profess a very ele
mentary kind of Marxism,
steeped in anti-capitalism and
anti- imperialism. They are
cowed temporarily by the threat
of the draft and they take ref
uge in their books and the quest
for scholarships to the United
States.
The Buddhists are so divided
that generalizations must be
considered with extreme care.
The best-known leaders are anti-
Ky, anti-United States and anti
war, but they are also basically
anti-Communist. Some describe
the current situation as "worse
than under the French, or worse
than under Ngo Dinh Diem."
Three years of struggle have
split the politically-m in d e d
Buddhist leaders into militants
and moderates, with the latter
favoring compromise with the
government and currently in the
saddle.
Goals of Buddhists
The goals of the Buddhists
are independence, democracy,

social reform and peace. Most
leaders are not all-out pacifists
and they would prefer to fight
rather than surrender their be
liefs to communism. On the oth
er hand, many would prefer
compromise with the Commu
nists to what they consider as
"ignominious puppetry in the
hands of American militarists."
Some call for a Buddhist
united front, and others go so
far as to advocate a religious
united front, to be made up of
Buddhists, Catholics, Hoa Hao
and Cao Dai. A Saigon govern
ment, based on religion and not
militarism, could then approach
the National Liberation Front
in the interest of a coalition for
South Vietnam.
When I asked one Buddhist
leader if this were practical, he
replied, "Certainly." He rea
soned that the appeal of religion
compared to communism was
like "sunshine and moonlight"
and the stronger would over
come. It was his feeling that
southerners in the NLF were
not Communists to begin with
and still are not stooges of Ha
noi. He said "they were driven
to communism by the war, and
they will be won from commu
nism with the return of peace."
Burning- Question
A few respected, intellectually
competent "spokesmen for the
common people" speak frankly
of the harm we are doing to
their country in spite of our
great pretensions. I was asked
repeatedly: "Why do you have
to occupy our country, burn our
villages and drop bombs on our
people" and "Why do you insist
on fighting the war your way
when you have not found the
key to victory or to peace?" I
was told that U.S. activities put
30 innocent civilians into the
hospital for every one wounded
by the Viet Cong and that out
of 100 reported casualties no
more than 10 were actually Viet
Cong.
The burning question in the
hearts of thoughtful, loyal (but
anti-Ky) Vietnamese is "Will
you Americans do as much for
rebuilding and development as
you are doing in destruction?"
The most solid elements In
Vietnamese society feel a deep
ening sense of frustration and
despair.

The overwhelming fact about Viet
nam today is the great American
presence. Other foreigners, even the
French, are scarcely noticeable.
American fighting men seem to be
everywhere and the highways are
jammed with their equipment. The
skies are filled with American aircraft
of every description. Thousands of
American civilians in government,
business or construction work are as
conspicuous as American soldiers.
In Saigon, American offices and
residences are guarded by uniformed
soldiers with guns loaded, drawn and
pointed at the passersby. Vietnamese
automobiles may not even stop in
front of American buildings because
of the fear of explosives. Outside of
Saigon, the entire country—from the
South China sea to the Cambodian
border and from the delta to the 17th
parallel — seems to be occupied by
Americans.
Three out of four Vietnamese still
have no idea why we are there, and
they may well believe that we are at
the root of their wretchedness. We
have difficulty in communicating with
these masses, because fewer than 100
Americans can really speak their lan
guage. Conversing through inter
preters Is unsatisfactory at best.

The next higher 20% of the people r
those in a more sophisticated bracket,
appreciate American presence be
cause they are convinced that without
it Vietnam would have gone to the
Communists in 1964 or 1965. But even
they have some peculiar ideas. They
know little about our homeland, with
its priority of national interests, po
litical rivalries and differences of
opinion. This 20% tends to think of
all Americans as making $100,000 a
month and taking to themselves as
many Vietnamese wives as they
choose.
They are inclined to make compari
sons between us and their former
French masters, but they want us to
stay whereas they wanted the French
to leave. They feel that Americans
must want territory or economic priv
ileges like the French or must use
Vietnam as a convenient base to fight
the Chinese.
Few Vietnamese—the 5% at the
top of the political and social scale —
really grasp the issues which swirl
about the American presence. This
group is remarkably ambivalent in
its reactions to American policies.
The government in power depends
for its life upon the United States but
it is not a puppet and cannot afford
to look like one. Every Vietnamese
official must go to great lengths to
appear independent and every Ameri
can must be extra careful to show
proper respect to his counterpart.

The forms of equality are essential in
every working relationship from the
very top-level down, and the hyper
sensitivity of newly-sovereign Asians
is not to be trifled with.
Inconsequential incidents often

asked in Saigon why did Ambassador
Henry Cabot Lodge not attend the

on another occasion, why did the rep

United States call upon the minister
of economics as well as the prime

minister? And why was the Ameri
can ambassador so tardy in support
ing the prime minister in the ousting
of Lt. Gen. Nguyen Chanh Thi dur
ing the Buddhist uprising of last
spring? Rumors circulate constantly
to the effect that the United States
does or does not intend to dump the
Ky regime in favor of a more demo
cratic government.
Government machinery thrives on
intrigue and concepts of personal
loyalty. The Saigon government feels
that nothing matters except its own
prerogatives in the conduct of the
war, so it cannot be bothered with
the forms of democracy or the guar
antees of civil liberties. Above all, it
resents bitterly any indication of
U.S. interference in its internal af
fairs.
Americans have been accused of de
siring a Mac Arthur-type pro-consul
ship with an American general in
command and with the politicians as
his advisers. It is the height of naiv
ete to think that the Vietnamese
would reconcile themselves to a 10-
or 25-year American occupation, or
to the establishment of any military
government without precise provi
sions for its passing.
'The Other War'
Not many in the Vietnamese gov
ernment see eye to eye with Presi
dent Johnson on pacification, or "the
other war." They do not feel that


CLAUDE A. BUSS
revolutionary development" is a
timely concept and they even
translate the phrase into Vietna
mese as "rural construction."
They are not disposed to put
promising young soldiers into
civic action and they are skepti
cal about the pressures exerted
by Americans on behalf of the
villagers. Nor do the Vietna
mese share the deep American
concern for the welfare and po
litical re-education of the refu
gees. Vietnamese officials de
pend almost entirely on the
Americans for the conduct of
the psychological battle for the
hearts and minds of the people.
The Saigon government dis
agrees with the Americans on
the treatment of the Montag
nards, the tribesmen in the hill
country of central Vietnam. Sai
gon looks down upon the Mon
tagnards but Americans con
sider them good anti-Commu
nist fighters. The Montagnards
have their own political organi
zation, United Front for the
Liberated Races (FULRO),
which enjoys at least tacit U.S.
support. They would be the last
people to want the Americans to
leave Vietnam. Thanks largely
to American help, they have ob
tained from Saigon specific
promises of better treatment in
education, landholding and gov
ernment jobs. They have been
given permission to have their
own tribal court system and
their own fighting units with
their own flag. Three represen
tatives of the Montagnards were
elected in September to the Con
stituent Assembly.

of Lt. Gen. Nguyen Chanh Thi dur

spring? Rumors circulate constantly
to the effect that the United States
does or does not intend to dump the

cratic government.
Government machinery thrives on
intrigue and concepts of personal
loyalty. The Saigon government feels
that nothing matters except its own
prerogatives in the conduct of the
war, so it cannot be bothered with
the forms of democracy or the guar
antees of civil liberties. Above all, it
resents bitterly any indication of
U.S. interference in its internal af
fairs.
Americans have been accused of de
siring a Mac Arthur-type pro-consul
ship with an American general in
command and with the politicians as
his advisers. It is the height of naiv
ete to think that the Vietnamese
would reconcile themselves to a 10-
or 25-year American occupation, or
to the establishment of any military
government without precise provi
sions for its passing.
'The Other War'
Not many in the Vietnamese gov
ernment see eye to eye with Presi
dent Johnson on pacification, or "the
other war." They do not feel that


CLAUDE A. BUSS
revolutionary development" is a
timely concept and they even
translate the phrase into Vietna
mese as "rural construction."
They are not disposed to put
promising young soldiers into
civic action and they are skepti
cal about the pressures exerted
by Americans on behalf of the
villagers. Nor do the Vietna
mese share the deep American
concern for the welfare and po
litical re-education of the refu
gees. Vietnamese officials de
pend almost entirely on the
Americans for the conduct of
the psychological battle for the
hearts and minds of the people.
The Saigon government dis
agrees with the Americans on
the treatment of the Montag
nards, the tribesmen in the hill
country of central Vietnam. Sai
gon looks down upon the Mon
tagnards but Americans con
sider them good anti-Commu
nist fighters. The Montagnards
have their own political organi
zation, United Front for the
Liberated Races (FULRO),
which enjoys at least tacit U.S.
support. They would be the last
people to want the Americans to
leave Vietnam. Thanks largely
to American help, they have ob
tained from Saigon specific
promises of better treatment in
education, landholding and gov
ernment jobs. They have been
given permission to have their
own tribal court system and
their own fighting units with
their own flag. Three represen
tatives of the Montagnards were
elected in September to the Con
stituent Assembly.

The militarization of Vietnam
has a peculiar psychological ef
fect on the Vietnamese and on
most other Asians. The military
(neither ours nor theirs) does
not have a high place in local
social values, and oldtime Chi
nese-style generals were re
spected scholars. The present
crop of Vietnamese generals
was embarrassingly associated
with French imperialism. Our
dollars and guns may create a
strongman, but they will never
create a pillar of Vietnamese so
ciety. It makes little sense to see
a young man elevated to the
prime ministry chiefly because
he knows how to fly a plane.
What Ky Wants
The prime minister, Nguyen
Cao Ky, has his own ideas about
how to conduct the war. He is a
reflection of Chiang Kai-shek or
Syngman Rhee and he will tol
erate no compromise with com
munism. He sees the real enemy
as Communist China "with its
policy of aggression, expansion
and domination." He wants all
out war and complete victory
over North Vietnam and China.
He is mum on the subject of
what to do about Russia, but he
stresses that the military help
to Hanoi comes from Moscow
and not Peking.
Saigon officialdom has its own
highly individualistic views
about the end of the war. "Ne
gotiations" is a dirty word, and
Ky says under no circumstances
will he negotiate with the crimi
nals and murderers of the Na
tional Liberation Front. A Ge
neva conference is out and so
are negotiations for unification
with the north until the south
becomes convincingly stronger.
As Ky indicated at Manila, he
wants nothing diplomatically
from his allies except full sup
port for his own position. If
ever a peace offensive should
be launched, it should come
from Saigon and not from
Americans running around the
world.

Turning from the government
to non-official spokesmen for
Vietnamese attitudes towards
American policies, one is limited
to doctors, lawyers, business
men, newspaper people, stu
dents and religious leaders who
feel free to talk. It is clear that
Vietnamese are not yet caught
up in the fervor of ultra-nation
alism, nor is there a concerted
demand for economic and social
reform. These matters are
bound to intensify with the ces
sation of hostilities.
Conservative professional and
business leaders are cautious
and see their only hope for a
better future in a long period
of assistance from the United
States. They are proud, like
their officials, and they too will
insist upon all the amenities of
dignity, self-respect and equality
in American-Vietnamese rela
tions.
Students are most volatile in
their anti-foreignism and most
easily persuaded to demonstra
tions. They profess a very ele
mentary kind of Marxism,
steeped in anti-capitalism and
anti- imperialism. They are
cowed temporarily by the threat
of the draft and they take ref
uge in their books and the quest
for scholarships to the United
States.
The Buddhists are so divided
that generalizations must be
considered with extreme care.
The best-known leaders are anti-
Ky, anti-United States and anti
war, but they are also basically
anti-Communist. Some describe
the current situation as "worse
than under the French, or worse
than under Ngo Dinh Diem."
Three years of struggle have
split the politically-m in d e d
Buddhist leaders into militants
and moderates, with the latter
favoring compromise with the
government and currently in the
saddle.
Goals of Buddhists
The goals of the Buddhists
are independence, democracy,

social reform and peace. Most
leaders are not all-out pacifists
and they would prefer to fight
rather than surrender their be
liefs to communism. On the oth
er hand, many would prefer
compromise with the Commu
nists to what they consider as
"ignominious puppetry in the
hands of American militarists."
Some call for a Buddhist
united front, and others go so
far as to advocate a religious
united front, to be made up of
Buddhists, Catholics, Hoa Hao
and Cao Dai. A Saigon govern
ment, based on religion and not
militarism, could then approach
the National Liberation Front
in the interest of a coalition for
South Vietnam.
When I asked one Buddhist
leader if this were practical, he
replied, "Certainly." He rea
soned that the appeal of religion
compared to communism was
like "sunshine and moonlight"
and the stronger would over
come. It was his feeling that
southerners in the NLF were
not Communists to begin with
and still are not stooges of Ha
noi. He said "they were driven
to communism by the war, and
they will be won from commu
nism with the return of peace."
Burning- Question
A few respected, intellectually
competent "spokesmen for the
common people" speak frankly
of the harm we are doing to
their country in spite of our
great pretensions. I was asked
repeatedly: "Why do you have
to occupy our country, burn our
villages and drop bombs on our
people" and "Why do you insist
on fighting the war your way
when you have not found the
key to victory or to peace?" I
was told that U.S. activities put
30 innocent civilians into the
hospital for every one wounded
by the Viet Cong and that out
of 100 reported casualties no
more than 10 were actually Viet
Cong.
The burning question in the
hearts of thoughtful, loyal (but
anti-Ky) Vietnamese is "Will
you Americans do as much for
rebuilding and development as
you are doing in destruction?"
The most solid elements In
Vietnamese society feel a deep
ening sense of frustration and
despair.

The overwhelming fact about Viet
nam today is the great American
presence. Other foreigners, even the
French, are scarcely noticeable.
American fighting men seem to be
everywhere and the highways are
jammed with their equipment. The
skies are filled with American aircraft
of every description. Thousands of
American civilians in government,
business or construction work are as
conspicuous as American soldiers.
In Saigon, American offices and
residences are guarded by uniformed
soldiers with guns loaded, drawn and
pointed at the passersby. Vietnamese
automobiles may not even stop in
front of American buildings because
of the fear of explosives. Outside of
Saigon, the entire country—from the
South China sea to the Cambodian
border and from the delta to the 17th
parallel — seems to be occupied by
Americans.
Three out of four Vietnamese still
have no idea why we are there, and
they may well believe that we are at
the root of their wretchedness. We
have difficulty in communicating with
these masses, because fewer than 100
Americans can really speak their lan
guage. Conversing through inter
preters Is unsatisfactory at best.

The next higher 20% of the people r
those in a more sophisticated bracket,
appreciate American presence be
cause they are convinced that without
it Vietnam would have gone to the
Communists in 1964 or 1965. But even
they have some peculiar ideas. They
know little about our homeland, with
its priority of national interests, po
litical rivalries and differences of
opinion. This 20% tends to think of
all Americans as making $100,000 a
month and taking to themselves as
many Vietnamese wives as they
choose.
They are inclined to make compari
sons between us and their former
French masters, but they want us to
stay whereas they wanted the French
to leave. They feel that Americans
must want territory or economic priv
ileges like the French or must use
Vietnam as a convenient base to fight
the Chinese.
Few Vietnamese—the 5% at the
top of the political and social scale —
really grasp the issues which swirl
about the American presence. This
group is remarkably ambivalent in
its reactions to American policies.
The government in power depends
for its life upon the United States but
it is not a puppet and cannot afford
to look like one. Every Vietnamese
official must go to great lengths to
appear independent and every Ameri
can must be extra careful to show
proper respect to his counterpart.

of the Far East.

The overwhelming fact about Viet
nam today is the great American
presence. Other foreigners, even the
French, are scarcely noticeable.
American fighting men seem to be
everywhere and the highways are
jammed with their equipment. The
skies are filled with American aircraft
of every description. Thousands of
American civilians in government,
business or construction work are as
conspicuous as American soldiers.
In Saigon, American offices and
residences are guarded by uniformed
soldiers with guns loaded, drawn and
pointed at the passersby. Vietnamese
automobiles may not even stop in
front of American buildings because
of the fear of explosives. Outside of
Saigon, the entire country—from the
South China sea to the Cambodian
border and from the delta to the 17th
parallel — seems to be occupied by
Americans.
Three out of four Vietnamese still
have no idea why we are there, and
they may well believe that we are at
the root of their wretchedness. We
have difficulty in communicating with
these masses, because fewer than 100
Americans can really speak their lan
guage. Conversing through inter
preters Is unsatisfactory at best.

The next higher 20% of the people r
those in a more sophisticated bracket,
appreciate American presence be
cause they are convinced that without
it Vietnam would have gone to the
Communists in 1964 or 1965. But even
they have some peculiar ideas. They
know little about our homeland, with
its priority of national interests, po
litical rivalries and differences of
opinion. This 20% tends to think of
all Americans as making $100,000 a
month and taking to themselves as
many Vietnamese wives as they
choose.
They are inclined to make compari
sons between us and their former
French masters, but they want us to
stay whereas they wanted the French
to leave. They feel that Americans
must want territory or economic priv
ileges like the French or must use
Vietnam as a convenient base to fight
the Chinese.
Few Vietnamese—the 5% at the
top of the political and social scale —
really grasp the issues which swirl
about the American presence. This
group is remarkably ambivalent in
its reactions to American policies.
The government in power depends
for its life upon the United States but
it is not a puppet and cannot afford
to look like one. Every Vietnamese
official must go to great lengths to
appear independent and every Ameri
can must be extra careful to show
proper respect to his counterpart.

The forms of equality are essential in
every working relationship from the
very top-level down, and the hyper
sensitivity of newly-sovereign Asians
is not to be trifled with.
Inconsequential incidents often
breed suspicion. For instance, it was
asked in Saigon why did Ambassador
Henry Cabot Lodge not attend the
national day parade last Nov. 1? And,
on another occasion, why did the rep
resentative of the president of the
United States call upon the minister
of economics as well as the prime

minister? And why was the Ameri
can ambassador so tardy in support
ing the prime minister in the ousting
of Lt. Gen. Nguyen Chanh Thi dur
ing the Buddhist uprising of last
spring? Rumors circulate constantly
to the effect that the United States
does or does not intend to dump the
Ky regime in favor of a more demo
cratic government.
Government machinery thrives on
intrigue and concepts of personal
loyalty. The Saigon government feels
that nothing matters except its own
prerogatives in the conduct of the
war, so it cannot be bothered with
the forms of democracy or the guar
antees of civil liberties. Above all, it
resents bitterly any indication of
U.S. interference in its internal af
fairs.
Americans have been accused of de
siring a Mac Arthur-type pro-consul
ship with an American general in
command and with the politicians as
his advisers. It is the height of naiv
ete to think that the Vietnamese
would reconcile themselves to a 10-
or 25-year American occupation, or
to the establishment of any military
government without precise provi
sions for its passing.
'The Other War'
Not many in the Vietnamese gov
ernment see eye to eye with Presi
dent Johnson on pacification, or "the
other war." They do not feel that


CLAUDE A. BUSS
revolutionary development" is a
timely concept and they even
translate the phrase into Vietna
mese as "rural construction."
They are not disposed to put
promising young soldiers into
civic action and they are skepti
cal about the pressures exerted
by Americans on behalf of the
villagers. Nor do the Vietna
mese share the deep American
concern for the welfare and po
litical re-education of the refu
gees. Vietnamese officials de
pend almost entirely on the
Americans for the conduct of
the psychological battle for the
hearts and minds of the people.
The Saigon government dis
agrees with the Americans on
the treatment of the Montag
nards, the tribesmen in the hill
country of central Vietnam. Sai
gon looks down upon the Mon
tagnards but Americans con
sider them good anti-Commu
nist fighters. The Montagnards
have their own political organi
zation, United Front for the
Liberated Races (FULRO),
which enjoys at least tacit U.S.
support. They would be the last
people to want the Americans to
leave Vietnam. Thanks largely
to American help, they have ob
tained from Saigon specific
promises of better treatment in
education, landholding and gov
ernment jobs. They have been
given permission to have their
own tribal court system and
their own fighting units with
their own flag. Three represen
tatives of the Montagnards were
elected in September to the Con
stituent Assembly.

The militarization of Vietnam
has a peculiar psychological ef
fect on the Vietnamese and on
most other Asians. The military
(neither ours nor theirs) does
not have a high place in local
social values, and oldtime Chi
nese-style generals were re
spected scholars. The present
crop of Vietnamese generals
was embarrassingly associated
with French imperialism. Our
dollars and guns may create a
strongman, but they will never
create a pillar of Vietnamese so
ciety. It makes little sense to see
a young man elevated to the
prime ministry chiefly because
he knows how to fly a plane.
What Ky Wants
The prime minister, Nguyen
Cao Ky, has his own ideas about
how to conduct the war. He is a
reflection of Chiang Kai-shek or
Syngman Rhee and he will tol
erate no compromise with com
munism. He sees the real enemy
as Communist China "with its
policy of aggression, expansion
and domination." He wants all
out war and complete victory
over North Vietnam and China.
He is mum on the subject of
what to do about Russia, but he
stresses that the military help
to Hanoi comes from Moscow
and not Peking.
Saigon officialdom has its own
highly individualistic views
about the end of the war. "Ne
gotiations" is a dirty word, and
Ky says under no circumstances
will he negotiate with the crimi
nals and murderers of the Na
tional Liberation Front. A Ge
neva conference is out and so
are negotiations for unification
with the north until the south
becomes convincingly stronger.
As Ky indicated at Manila, he
wants nothing diplomatically
from his allies except full sup
port for his own position. If
ever a peace offensive should
be launched, it should come
from Saigon and not from
Americans running around the
world.

Turning from the government
to non-official spokesmen for
Vietnamese attitudes towards
American policies, one is limited
to doctors, lawyers, business
men, newspaper people, stu
dents and religious leaders who
feel free to talk. It is clear that
Vietnamese are not yet caught
up in the fervor of ultra-nation
alism, nor is there a concerted
demand for economic and social
reform. These matters are
bound to intensify with the ces
sation of hostilities.
Conservative professional and
business leaders are cautious
and see their only hope for a
better future in a long period
of assistance from the United
States. They are proud, like
their officials, and they too will
insist upon all the amenities of
dignity, self-respect and equality
in American-Vietnamese rela
tions.
Students are most volatile in
their anti-foreignism and most
easily persuaded to demonstra
tions. They profess a very ele
mentary kind of Marxism,
steeped in anti-capitalism and
anti- imperialism. They are
cowed temporarily by the threat
of the draft and they take ref
uge in their books and the quest
for scholarships to the United
States.
The Buddhists are so divided
that generalizations must be
considered with extreme care.
The best-known leaders are anti-
Ky, anti-United States and anti
war, but they are also basically
anti-Communist. Some describe
the current situation as "worse
than under the French, or worse
than under Ngo Dinh Diem."
Three years of struggle have
split the politically-m in d e d
Buddhist leaders into militants
and moderates, with the latter
favoring compromise with the
government and currently in the
saddle.
Goals of Buddhists
The goals of the Buddhists
are independence, democracy,

social reform and peace. Most
leaders are not all-out pacifists
and they would prefer to fight
rather than surrender their be
liefs to communism. On the oth
er hand, many would prefer
compromise with the Commu
nists to what they consider as
"ignominious puppetry in the
hands of American militarists."
Some call for a Buddhist
united front, and others go so
far as to advocate a religious
united front, to be made up of
Buddhists, Catholics, Hoa Hao
and Cao Dai. A Saigon govern
ment, based on religion and not
militarism, could then approach
the National Liberation Front
in the interest of a coalition for
South Vietnam.
When I asked one Buddhist
leader if this were practical, he
replied, "Certainly." He rea
soned that the appeal of religion
compared to communism was
like "sunshine and moonlight"
and the stronger would over
come. It was his feeling that
southerners in the NLF were
not Communists to begin with
and still are not stooges of Ha
noi. He said "they were driven
to communism by the war, and
they will be won from commu
nism with the return of peace."
Burning- Question
A few respected, intellectually
competent "spokesmen for the
common people" speak frankly
of the harm we are doing to
their country in spite of our
great pretensions. I was asked
repeatedly: "Why do you have
to occupy our country, burn our
villages and drop bombs on our
people" and "Why do you insist
on fighting the war your way
when you have not found the
key to victory or to peace?" I
was told that U.S. activities put
30 innocent civilians into the
hospital for every one wounded
by the Viet Cong and that out
of 100 reported casualties no
more than 10 were actually Viet
Cong.
The burning question in the
hearts of thoughtful, loyal (but
anti-Ky) Vietnamese is "Will
you Americans do as much for
rebuilding and development as
you are doing in destruction?"
The most solid elements In
Vietnamese society feel a deep
ening sense of frustration and
despair.

The Buddhists are so divided
that generalizations must be
considered with extreme care.
The best-known leaders are anti-
Ky, anti-United States and anti
war, but they are also basically
anti-Communist. Some describe
the current situation as "worse
than under the French, or worse
than under Ngo Dinh Diem."
Three years of struggle have
split the politically-m in d e d
Buddhist leaders into militants

Goals of Buddhists
The goals of the Buddhists
are independence, democracy,

social reform and peace. Most
leaders are not all-out pacifists
and they would prefer to fight
rather than surrender their be
liefs to communism. On the oth
er hand, many would prefer
compromise with the Commu
nists to what they consider as
"ignominious puppetry in the
hands of American militarists."
Some call for a Buddhist
united front, and others go so
far as to advocate a religious
united front, to be made up of
Buddhists, Catholics, Hoa Hao
and Cao Dai. A Saigon govern
ment, based on religion and not
militarism, could then approach
the National Liberation Front
in the interest of a coalition for
South Vietnam.
When I asked one Buddhist
leader if this were practical, he
replied, "Certainly." He rea
soned that the appeal of religion
compared to communism was
like "sunshine and moonlight"
and the stronger would over
come. It was his feeling that
southerners in the NLF were
not Communists to begin with
and still are not stooges of Ha
noi. He said "they were driven
to communism by the war, and
they will be won from commu
nism with the return of peace."
Burning- Question
A few respected, intellectually
competent "spokesmen for the
common people" speak frankly
of the harm we are doing to
their country in spite of our
great pretensions. I was asked
repeatedly: "Why do you have
to occupy our country, burn our
villages and drop bombs on our
people" and "Why do you insist
on fighting the war your way
when you have not found the
key to victory or to peace?" I
was told that U.S. activities put
30 innocent civilians into the
hospital for every one wounded
by the Viet Cong and that out
of 100 reported casualties no
more than 10 were actually Viet
Cong.
The burning question in the
hearts of thoughtful, loyal (but
anti-Ky) Vietnamese is "Will
you Americans do as much for
rebuilding and development as
you are doing in destruction?"
The most solid elements In
Vietnamese society feel a deep
ening sense of frustration and
despair.

of the Far East.

The overwhelming fact about Viet
nam today is the great American
presence. Other foreigners, even the
French, are scarcely noticeable.
American fighting men seem to be
everywhere and the highways are
jammed with their equipment. The
skies are filled with American aircraft
of every description. Thousands of
American civilians in government,
business or construction work are as
conspicuous as American soldiers.
In Saigon, American offices and
residences are guarded by uniformed
soldiers with guns loaded, drawn and
pointed at the passersby. Vietnamese
automobiles may not even stop in
front of American buildings because
of the fear of explosives. Outside of
Saigon, the entire country—from the
South China sea to the Cambodian
border and from the delta to the 17th
parallel — seems to be occupied by
Americans.
Three out of four Vietnamese still
have no idea why we are there, and
they may well believe that we are at
the root of their wretchedness. We
have difficulty in communicating with
these masses, because fewer than 100
Americans can really speak their lan
guage. Conversing through inter
preters Is unsatisfactory at best.

The next higher 20% of the people r
those in a more sophisticated bracket,
appreciate American presence be
cause they are convinced that without
it Vietnam would have gone to the
Communists in 1964 or 1965. But even
they have some peculiar ideas. They
know little about our homeland, with
its priority of national interests, po
litical rivalries and differences of
opinion. This 20% tends to think of
all Americans as making $100,000 a
month and taking to themselves as
many Vietnamese wives as they
choose.
They are inclined to make compari
sons between us and their former
French masters, but they want us to
stay whereas they wanted the French
to leave. They feel that Americans
must want territory or economic priv
ileges like the French or must use
Vietnam as a convenient base to fight
the Chinese.
Few Vietnamese—the 5% at the
top of the political and social scale —
really grasp the issues which swirl
about the American presence. This
group is remarkably ambivalent in
its reactions to American policies.
The government in power depends
for its life upon the United States but
it is not a puppet and cannot afford
to look like one. Every Vietnamese
official must go to great lengths to
appear independent and every Ameri
can must be extra careful to show
proper respect to his counterpart.

The forms of equality are essential in
every working relationship from the
very top-level down, and the hyper
sensitivity of newly-sovereign Asians
is not to be trifled with.
Inconsequential incidents often
breed suspicion. For instance, it was
asked in Saigon why did Ambassador
Henry Cabot Lodge not attend the
national day parade last Nov. 1? And,
on another occasion, why did the rep
resentative of the president of the
United States call upon the minister
of economics as well as the prime

minister? And why was the Ameri
can ambassador so tardy in support
ing the prime minister in the ousting
of Lt. Gen. Nguyen Chanh Thi dur
ing the Buddhist uprising of last
spring? Rumors circulate constantly
to the effect that the United States
does or does not intend to dump the
Ky regime in favor of a more demo
cratic government.
Government machinery thrives on
intrigue and concepts of personal
loyalty. The Saigon government feels
that nothing matters except its own
prerogatives in the conduct of the
war, so it cannot be bothered with
the forms of democracy or the guar
antees of civil liberties. Above all, it
resents bitterly any indication of
U.S. interference in its internal af
fairs.
Americans have been accused of de
siring a Mac Arthur-type pro-consul
ship with an American general in
command and with the politicians as
his advisers. It is the height of naiv
ete to think that the Vietnamese
would reconcile themselves to a 10-
or 25-year American occupation, or
to the establishment of any military
government without precise provi
sions for its passing.
'The Other War'
Not many in the Vietnamese gov
ernment see eye to eye with Presi
dent Johnson on pacification, or "the
other war." They do not feel that


CLAUDE A. BUSS
revolutionary development" is a
timely concept and they even
translate the phrase into Vietna
mese as "rural construction."
They are not disposed to put
promising young soldiers into
civic action and they are skepti
cal about the pressures exerted
by Americans on behalf of the
villagers. Nor do the Vietna
mese share the deep American
concern for the welfare and po
litical re-education of the refu
gees. Vietnamese officials de
pend almost entirely on the
Americans for the conduct of
the psychological battle for the
hearts and minds of the people.
The Saigon government dis
agrees with the Americans on
the treatment of the Montag
nards, the tribesmen in the hill
country of central Vietnam. Sai
gon looks down upon the Mon
tagnards but Americans con
sider them good anti-Commu
nist fighters. The Montagnards
have their own political organi
zation, United Front for the
Liberated Races (FULRO),
which enjoys at least tacit U.S.
support. They would be the last
people to want the Americans to
leave Vietnam. Thanks largely
to American help, they have ob
tained from Saigon specific
promises of better treatment in
education, landholding and gov
ernment jobs. They have been
given permission to have their
own tribal court system and
their own fighting units with
their own flag. Three represen
tatives of the Montagnards were
elected in September to the Con
stituent Assembly.

The militarization of Vietnam
has a peculiar psychological ef
fect on the Vietnamese and on
most other Asians. The military
(neither ours nor theirs) does
not have a high place in local
social values, and oldtime Chi
nese-style generals were re
spected scholars. The present
crop of Vietnamese generals
was embarrassingly associated
with French imperialism. Our
dollars and guns may create a
strongman, but they will never
create a pillar of Vietnamese so
ciety. It makes little sense to see
a young man elevated to the
prime ministry chiefly because
he knows how to fly a plane.
What Ky Wants
The prime minister, Nguyen
Cao Ky, has his own ideas about
how to conduct the war. He is a
reflection of Chiang Kai-shek or
Syngman Rhee and he will tol
erate no compromise with com
munism. He sees the real enemy
as Communist China "with its
policy of aggression, expansion
and domination." He wants all
out war and complete victory
over North Vietnam and China.
He is mum on the subject of
what to do about Russia, but he
stresses that the military help
to Hanoi comes from Moscow
and not Peking.
Saigon officialdom has its own
highly individualistic views
about the end of the war. "Ne
gotiations" is a dirty word, and
Ky says under no circumstances
will he negotiate with the crimi
nals and murderers of the Na
tional Liberation Front. A Ge
neva conference is out and so
are negotiations for unification
with the north until the south
becomes convincingly stronger.
As Ky indicated at Manila, he
wants nothing diplomatically
from his allies except full sup
port for his own position. If
ever a peace offensive should
be launched, it should come
from Saigon and not from
Americans running around the
world.

Turning from the government
to non-official spokesmen for
Vietnamese attitudes towards
American policies, one is limited
to doctors, lawyers, business
men, newspaper people, stu
dents and religious leaders who
feel free to talk. It is clear that
Vietnamese are not yet caught
up in the fervor of ultra-nation
alism, nor is there a concerted
demand for economic and social
reform. These matters are
bound to intensify with the ces
sation of hostilities.
Conservative professional and
business leaders are cautious
and see their only hope for a
better future in a long period
of assistance from the United
States. They are proud, like
their officials, and they too will
insist upon all the amenities of
dignity, self-respect and equality
in American-Vietnamese rela
tions.
Students are most volatile in
their anti-foreignism and most
easily persuaded to demonstra
tions. They profess a very ele
mentary kind of Marxism,
steeped in anti-capitalism and
anti- imperialism. They are
cowed temporarily by the threat
of the draft and they take ref
uge in their books and the quest
for scholarships to the United
States.
The Buddhists are so divided
