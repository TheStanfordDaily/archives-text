# LBJ Proposes Tax Hike To Support Vietnam War
## 
### 
In his State of the Union message
last night, President Lyndon Johnson
proposed an across the board tax hike
of 6 per cent to be added to both cor
porate and individual income taxes
to pay for, as Johnson put it,"the
unusual expenditures associated with
Vietnam."
Although the President estimated
that budget expenditures would be at
least 126 billion dollars for the 1967
fiscal year, with a deficit of more than
9 billion dollars, he promised to term
inate the tax increase within two years
if events in Vietnam so allowed it.
While the most immediate part of
the President's message concerned
the new tax hike it was clear that
he hadn't forgotten his ambitions of
perpetuating The Great Johnsonian
Society. Johnson likened the War on
Poverty to that in Vietnam, and de
scribed it as an "enemy not easy to
perceive, to isolate, to destroy."
He urged that special funds be al
located and special methods be em
ployed "to reach Americans trapped
in the Ghettos of our cities." He also
stated that "we should raise Social Se
curity payments by an overall average
of 20 per cent, adding 4.1 billion dol
lars to Social Security payments in
the first year," alone.
Neither did Johnson forget Civil
Rights; in the same breath he pleaded
with Americans, "to seek justice for
each citizen . . . before a jury, in seek
ing a job, and in exercising Civil
Rights."
"We should," he said, "find a solu
tion to fair housing, so every Ameri
can regardless of color has a decent

home of his choice. Though the task
is great, the work hard and frustrat
ing," he said, "I believe that our peo
ple do not want to quit."
Johnson seemed also to be preoc
cupied with protecting the individual
citizen. On the controversial matter
of wiretapping, either public or pri
vate, Johnson declared that it be out
lawed in every case except where the
security of the country was at stake.
Even then utmost precautions should
be taken.
"We should do more to protect the
consumer," he said, demanding "that
the cost of credit be clearly and hon
estly expressed," as well as "safe
guarding the home against hazardous
household products."
"We should improve the process of
democracy by passing election reform
and financing proposals, by tightening
our laws regulating lobbying and by
restoring a reasonable franchise to

Americans who have moved their resi
dence."
While proposing that a new Depart
ment of Business and Labor be estab
lished by combining the Department
of Commerce and the Department of
Labor, in order to create a more
economical department to serve the
nation, Johnson stated that "No part
of our foreign policy is so sacred that
it remains beyond review."
In line with this the President will
ask Congress to help our foreign and
commercial trade policies by passing
an East-West trade bill and by also
approving our consular convention
with the Soviet Union.
Johnson concluded his message by
touching again on Vietnam and the
sacrifice which the American fighting
man is making. "How long this will
take," he said, "I cannot prophesy.
I only know that the will of the Ameri
can people is being tested."

touching again on Vietnam and the
sacrifice which the American fighting
man is making. "How long this will
take," he said, "I cannot prophesy.
I only know that the will of the Ameri
can people is being tested."
In his State of the Union message
last night, President Lyndon Johnson
proposed an across the board tax hike
of 6 per cent to be added to both cor
porate and individual income taxes
to pay for, as Johnson put it,"the
unusual expenditures associated with
Vietnam."
Although the President estimated
that budget expenditures would be at
least 126 billion dollars for the 1967
fiscal year, with a deficit of more than
9 billion dollars, he promised to term
inate the tax increase within two years
if events in Vietnam so allowed it.
While the most immediate part of
the President's message concerned
the new tax hike it was clear that
he hadn't forgotten his ambitions of
perpetuating The Great Johnsonian
Society. Johnson likened the War on
Poverty to that in Vietnam, and de
scribed it as an "enemy not easy to
perceive, to isolate, to destroy."
He urged that special funds be al
located and special methods be em
ployed "to reach Americans trapped
in the Ghettos of our cities." He also
stated that "we should raise Social Se
curity payments by an overall average
of 20 per cent, adding 4.1 billion dol
lars to Social Security payments in
the first year," alone.
Neither did Johnson forget Civil
Rights; in the same breath he pleaded
with Americans, "to seek justice for
each citizen . . . before a jury, in seek
ing a job, and in exercising Civil
Rights."
"We should," he said, "find a solu
tion to fair housing, so every Ameri
can regardless of color has a decent

home of his choice. Though the task
is great, the work hard and frustrat
ing," he said, "I believe that our peo
ple do not want to quit."
Johnson seemed also to be preoc
cupied with protecting the individual
citizen. On the controversial matter
of wiretapping, either public or pri
vate, Johnson declared that it be out
lawed in every case except where the
security of the country was at stake.
Even then utmost precautions should
be taken.
"We should do more to protect the
consumer," he said, demanding "that
the cost of credit be clearly and hon
estly expressed," as well as "safe
guarding the home against hazardous
household products."
"We should improve the process of
democracy by passing election reform
and financing proposals, by tightening
our laws regulating lobbying and by
restoring a reasonable franchise to

Americans who have moved their resi
dence."
While proposing that a new Depart
ment of Business and Labor be estab
lished by combining the Department
of Commerce and the Department of
Labor, in order to create a more
economical department to serve the
nation, Johnson stated that "No part
of our foreign policy is so sacred that
it remains beyond review."
In line with this the President will
ask Congress to help our foreign and
commercial trade policies by passing
an East-West trade bill and by also
approving our consular convention
with the Soviet Union.
