# 10% Supporting OFF By Delaying Payments
## 
### MARIAN JOHNSTON 
Approximately 350 students have
delayed payment of their room and
board bills in support of off-campus
housing for women, according to an
estimate made by the Controller's Of
fice.
Of the 3925 students who pay room
and board, about ten per cent more
than last year are delaying in their
payments," states Assistant Account
ing Manager Joseph Jedd. "We can
assume, with all caution, that the de
laying of payment by the majority
of these 350 students is due to the
strike."
Janet Howell, student leader of the
OFF movement, commented that the
aim of the 10-day boycott was not to
accumulate numbers. "We weren't
making a show of force." She believes
the small percentage of students par
ticipating in the boycott is due to a
lack of organization among support
ers of OFF.
Miss Howell is satisfied, however,
that the boycott successfully accom
plished its main objective which was
"to gain publicity on the issue." The
boycott received news coverage on
radio, television, and in the press.

The figures calculated by the Con
troller's Office show that 30.6 per cent
of the students paying room and
board completed their payment on
Wednesday, January 4, as compared
with 43.1 per cent on Winter Quarter
Registration Day in 1966. Another
11.1 per cent made payment on
Thursday, 4.8 per cent paid on Fri
day, and 5.3 per cent on Monday. The
percentages on the same days last
year are 14.1, 4.0, and 4.6, respective
ly.
Jedd emphasized that several fac
tors must be considered in analyzing
these figures. For several years, the
number of students deferring pay
ment has increased. Also, students
this year may have delayed their re
turn to Stanford to take advantage of
half-fare rates in air travel.
The Controller's Office figures also
show that for the last two days, the
percentages of students paying their
$380 room and board bill is greater
than that on the same days in 1966.
This possibly means that students
who wished to indicate their support
of OFF are now completing their pay
ments.
Janet Howell says that those stu
dents who participated in the boycott
did so "out of their own desire to
show where they stood."
She believes that now that atten
tion has been drawn to the OFF issue
the problem is to affect the nature
of the change to prevent a mere
token revision from being made. "We
are asking for equality with the men
or a reason why not," she concluded
