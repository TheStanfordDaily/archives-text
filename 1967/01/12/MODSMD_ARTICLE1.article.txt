# Students Regret Reagan's Thrift

### SUSAN HUDGENS 
Newly-elected Governor Ronald
Reagan faces heated reaction from
students across the state after an
nouncing last week that he plans to
request a tuition program for Cali
fornia's state colleges and universities
and a cut in their budget.
In a cross-campus poll of opinions,
most Stanford students expressed dis
may at the effect Reagan's economy
drive will have on education and tied
his proposal to his political beliefs.
Senior Joel Kugelmass remarked,
"It's difficult to decide whether Reagan
is stupid or evil, but there is no par
ticular reason why he can't be both.
I think that by the end of this term,
he will have destroyed the Univer
sity."
Dr. Charles A. Drekmeier, profes
sor of Political Science, observed in a
statement to The Daily that, "The
issue points up the ambivalence of
democracy: the fact, much beloved of
conservatives, that the long-range
needs of the people are not always
understood by their representatives."
Other States Pay
"On a more immediate financial
level, it probably should be pointed
out to Governor Reagan that other
states are paying for the education
of a great many people who even
tually settle in this state, and that the
Federal Government, which pays most
of the bill of the University, is less
likely to be interested in a school
which reflected the standards of Hugh
Burns, Max Rafferty ,and Eureka Col
lege in Illinois."
"It cost me $47 in tuition each se
mester at the University of Wiscon
sin, and I'd like to think that kind
of opportunity still possible for many
people."
Commenting on the economic prob
lem, Fred Zappert, graduate in Engi
neering, said, "You can't doubt his
down right sincerity in trying to ba
lance the budget, but it's just a poor
way of doing it. He's un-American
not to use deficit spending."
Low Mentality
"He's trying to preserve a class
society in which only the wealthy have
access to education. His mentality is
such that he doesn't understand the
New Left, intellectualism, etc. He's
trying to oust the radicals," Karen
McChrystal said.
Sophomore Ying Ying Wu believes
that "Reagan is living his own fan
tasy. A budget should be balanced,
but California requires a vast amount
of money to run on. You can't cut
down on things like education to
balance the budget."
Others, like Wilbur freshman Jeff
Preefar, think "It's a good idea.
There's no reason why they can't af
ford to pay a few hundred a year.
The students won't like it. They're
got something for nothing."
ASSU President David Harris rap
ped Reagan for "trying to drive the
enterprise of the mind underground."

"It's like supporting the one-eyed
against the blind; that is, Kerr against
Reagan. Kerr consistently hasn't un
derstood what the university is trying
to do. Reagan doesn't understand the
concept of understanding."
Bourgeois Action
Tom Forstenzer, Speaker of the
ASSU Legislature, pegged Reagan's
action as "a perfect example of the
petty bourgeoisie who has achieved
rapid social mobility."
"The action is destructive to a pub
lic system literally based on the prin
ciple of social (academic) mobility by
merit. It means the protection of
property owners by sacrificing the
new population," Forstenzer added.
Tim Haight, assistant to Harris, ac
cused Reagan of "appealing to middle
class prejudice. He wants to force
the activists to appreciate what they're
getting."
The cost of going to Berkeley will
be over $2000, Haight estimated. "To
expect the underprivileged to put
with that is absurd. To deny those
that opportunity means to continue
potential grave disorder in the state.
Reagan believes in order through
police, not education."
Junior Dan Lewis summarized the
dilemma: "He doesn't even see his
shadow on the wall of the cave."

Newly-elected Governor Ronald
Reagan faces heated reaction from
students across the state after an

request a tuition program for Cali

and a cut in their budget.
In a cross-campus poll of opinions,
most Stanford students expressed dis

Senior Joel Kugelmass remarked,
"It's difficult to decide whether Reagan
is stupid or evil, but there is no par

I think that by the end of this term,

Dr. Charles A. Drekmeier, profes

"On a more immediate financial
level, it probably should be pointed
out to Governor Reagan that other
states are paying for the education
of a great many people who even
tually settle in this state, and that the
Federal Government, which pays most
of the bill of the University, is less
likely to be interested in a school
which reflected the standards of Hugh

Commenting on the economic prob

"He's trying to preserve a class

Sophomore Ying Ying Wu believes
that "Reagan is living his own fan

Others, like Wilbur freshman Jeff

ASSU President David Harris rap
ped Reagan for "trying to drive the
enterprise of the mind underground."

"It's like supporting the one-eyed

Reagan. Kerr consistently hasn't un
derstood what the university is trying

concept of understanding."
Bourgeois Action
Tom Forstenzer, Speaker of the
ASSU Legislature, pegged Reagan's
action as "a perfect example of the
petty bourgeoisie who has achieved
rapid social mobility."
"The action is destructive to a pub

merit. It means the protection of
property owners by sacrificing the
new population," Forstenzer added.
Tim Haight, assistant to Harris, ac
cused Reagan of "appealing to middle
class prejudice. He wants to force
the activists to appreciate what they're

The cost of going to Berkeley will
be over $2000, Haight estimated. "To
