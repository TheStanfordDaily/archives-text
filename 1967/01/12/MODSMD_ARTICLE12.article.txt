# Brown To Begin UCCM Workshop
## 
### 
The Stanford UCCM will begin
its winter quarter Theological
Workshop this evening with a
lecture and discussion led by Dr.
Robert McAfee Brown, Profes
sor of Religion, on "Doing The
ology Ecumenically."
The lecture will be the first
throughout the quarter to meet
the "need for discussion of how
religious prespective can be ap
plied to the decisions of personal
life, to the problems of the
world, and to our involvement in
the University, both as an insti
tution and as a way of life."
Five Lecturers Featured
The lecturers include Dr.
Brown, Dr. Philip Rhinelander,
Professor of Philosophy, and the
Reverends Lane Barton, Episco
pal, Stuart McLean, Presby
terian, and Richard Roe, United
Church of Christ. The lecture
discussion meetings will cover
such topics as "The Biblical The

ology" by Mr. Barton, "The Im
pact of Relativity on Theology"
by Dr. Rhinelander, "The New
Morality" by Mr. McLean, and
"New Structures of the Church"
by Mr. Roe. All meetings will be
open to faculty and staff as well
as undergraduate and graduate
students.
UCCM feels that today's stu
dent sees the church as a priv
ileged and unconcerned institu
tion, and theology as a system
of answers to questions which
nobody is asking. The purpose
of the program, as Canterbury
sees it, is to show that the
church is a growing organism in
our society and that theology
does play a part in our lives.
Focus On Incarnation
The lectures will focus on the
center of Christianity, the In
carnation, and will try to show
that Jesus Christ, as the Word
of God, has a "vitality, currency,
and ultimacy within the context
of questions which students
ask."
The Workshop's two functions
are to bring up to date and re
new the understanding of faith
of many who are already church
members, and to be an introduc
tion to the Christian faith for
those who are not now church
members. At the last session
there will be an opportunity to
meet ministers of local congrega
tions to consider membership
in a particular church.
The UCCM and the Canter
bury Foundation are offering
this "ecumenical experiment" as
a joint communicants and/or re
newal-of-falth class and as an
opportunity for discussion on the
questions being raised by mem
bers of the academic community,
about freedom, human dignity,
and the worth of the individual,
with an attempt to connect these
problems with our immediate
problems of war, poverty, and
racism.
