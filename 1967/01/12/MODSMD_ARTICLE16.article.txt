# Indian Ruggers Open Season Against Sacramento, Saturday
## Rugby, Not A Rumble 
### JOHN MERRILL 
A veteran squad will open the
1967 Rugby Season for Stan
ford this Saturday against the
Sacramento State varsity in
Sacramento.
Coached by Pete Kmetovic, in
his 18th year of coaching at
Stanford, the ruggers come from
both undergraduate and grad
uate students at Stanford, as
only amateur status is needed
for team eligibility.
The team has only been prac
ticing since the first week of this
quarter, but many of the squad
participated in the annual Stan
ford Seven-a-side tournament
which was held at Stanford in
early December of last year.
Seven-a-side Yin
The Stanford "1" team won
the tourney over many highly
regarded entries. Besides the
seven men who comprised this
team, many other varsity players
participated on fraternity or oth
er teams.
Rugby has undergone a rapid
increase in popularity in the
United States in recent years
and the Bay Area has seen rug
by involve more teams with
every new season. This season,
Stanford will play each of the
teams on its 11 game schedule
only once, with the exception of
California, with whom Stanford
plays a home-and-home series
each year for the Big Game
Scrum Axe.
First home game for the In
dian ruggers will be Saturday,
January 21, against the Palo
Alto Rugby Club. With each var
sity game this year there will
also be a junior varsity game,
and five other games have been
scheduled for a second junior
varsity.
No Peninsula League
Stanford is not in an actual
rugby league though supremacy
on the Peninsula is highly trea
sured and usually decided by the
series with California and the
Monterey Rugby tournament

which is the final rugby event
of the year.
Important games for Stanford
are always those with the var
ious rugby clubs in the area.
The Olympic Club of San Fran
cisco will have a "beefed up"
lineup this year as they plan a
swing through Europe at the
end of the season.
College Competition
Besides California, the Stan
ford ruggers play the college
teams of Santa Clara, USC, and
UCLA. The UCLA game will

be at Stanford, while the Indians
will travel south to meet the
Trojans.
The starting lineup for the In
dians is not settled as yet due to
exams at the law school and
some late reporting players.
However, most positions are set
for Saturday's opener.
Saturday's Starters
Robby Nimmo will start at
hook, with Joe Neal and Bruce
Kehrli at props. Kehrli and Neal
are both experienced scrum
men and former Stanford foot
ball linemen.
Blaine Nye and Eric De Goo
yer will fill the second row posi
tions, with Peter Hogg, from
New Zealand, at the back row
spot.
At the breakaway positions
will be veteran Bob Newberry
and Leon Hartvickson. Frank
Pattitucci, another break, is out
with an injury.
David Evans, a student from
Austrialia, will be at the scrum
halfback position, and Bill Os
trander and Tom Vantienhoven
will probably start at wings.
In the backfield positions for
the Indians will be Mike Grace,
Jeff Joseph and Eric Sutcliffe,
with John Kidde at fullback.
The team boasts of an ex
perienced scrum and backfield
this year as well as good team
speed. Dick Ragsdale and Bob
Blunt, both former Stanford foot
ball backs, should join the team
after this first game.
The Indians have an excel
lent one-two scoring punch in
Bob Newberry and Mike Grace.
Both were standouts last year
and led the Stanford team in the
Seven-a-side tourney.


Hooker Tom Fortniann (50) and
second row man Andy Wald go
after the bal lin last year's rugby
action. The team, composed of
both graduate and undergradu
ates, opens its season against
Sacramento State, Saturday, in
Sacramento. Last year the In
dians smashed Sacramento, 38-0.
