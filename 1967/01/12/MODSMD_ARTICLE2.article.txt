# Applications Due Next Monday For Stanford-In-Washington Program
## 
### 
Fewer students this year than in the
past, have applied for summer intern
ships with the Stanford-in-Washington
program.
According to program chairman
Mike Sandler, 200 students applied last
year and approximately only half that
many have submitted applications this
year.
The deadline for applications is Mon
day, January 16. They can be obtained
at the Bowman Alumni House from
Miss Suzi Allen, who also has infor
mation available on the project.
According to Sandler, the primary
purpose of the Stanford-in-Washington
program is to enable qualified students
to learn better the processes of fed
eral government through direct con
tact with it.
Two types of jobs are available for
students selected to participate: agen
cy jobs and congressional jobs. In the
latter category, interns have held a
great variety of positions, in such
branches of the executive as the Viet
nam Desk in the State Department, the
Office of the Secretary of the Interior,
and the Bureau of the Budget.
Range Of Jobs
Students holding congressional jobs
do work ranging from clerical duties
to the drafting of important speeches
for Senators and Congressmen. Sand
ler, for instance, worked for Califor
nia's Senator Kuchel last summer.
This summer, in addition to many
of the jobs which have been available
in the past, a State Department posi
tion will be available for a student
who has taken the Foreign Service
Officer examination and is eligible.
Direct contact in federal and Con
gressional positions is supplemented
by a seminst series in Washington and
a pre-departure orientation program.
A hostel is slated for this May to
acquaint prospective interns with the
situations that are likely to confront

them. Relevant courses in the Stan
ford curriculum are also stressed.
There is no set pay for student in
terns in Washington. Those working
in agencies are often paid well, while
some working for members of Con
gress are sometimes not paid at all.
Financial assistance is available for a

small number of students, so that they
can at least break even.
Last year, approximately fifteen
Stanford interns received stipends av
eraging $250 each. Moreover, a few
students were also able to obtain free
housing for the summer with Stan
ford alumni in the Washington area.

Students holding congressional jobs
do work ranging from clerical duties
to the drafting of important speeches
for Senators and Congressmen. Sand
ler, for instance, worked for Califor
nia's Senator Kuchel last summer.
This summer, in addition to many
of the jobs which have been available
in the past, a State Department posi
tion will be available for a student
who has taken the Foreign Service
Officer examination and is eligible.
Direct contact in federal and Con
gressional positions is supplemented
by a seminst series in Washington and
a pre-departure orientation program.
A hostel is slated for this May to
acquaint prospective interns with the
situations that are likely to confront

them. Relevant courses in the Stan
ford curriculum are also stressed.
There is no set pay for student in
terns in Washington. Those working
in agencies are often paid well, while
some working for members of Con
gress are sometimes not paid at all.
Financial assistance is available for a

small number of students, so that they
can at least break even.
Last year, approximately fifteen
Stanford interns received stipends av
eraging $250 each. Moreover, a few
students were also able to obtain free
housing for the summer with Stan
ford alumni in the Washington area.
Fewer students this year than in the
past, have applied for summer intern
ships with the Stanford-in-Washington
program.
According to program chairman
Mike Sandler, 200 students applied last
year and approximately only half that
many have submitted applications this
year.
The deadline for applications is Mon
day, January 16. They can be obtained
at the Bowman Alumni House from
Miss Suzi Allen, who also has infor
mation available on the project.
According to Sandler, the primary
purpose of the Stanford-in-Washington
program is to enable qualified students
to learn better the processes of fed
eral government through direct con
tact with it.
Two types of jobs are available for
students selected to participate: agen
cy jobs and congressional jobs. In the
latter category, interns have held a
great variety of positions, in such
branches of the executive as the Viet
nam Desk in the State Department, the
Office of the Secretary of the Interior,
and the Bureau of the Budget.
