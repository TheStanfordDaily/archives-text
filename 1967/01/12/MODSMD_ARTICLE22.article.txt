# The 						Capitol Scene
## LBJ Fails To Say 'Cheeseâ€™ 
### Art Buchwald 
It seems a pity that after all
President Johnson has done for
the arts, the least the artists
could do is paint a decent por
trait of him. Last week it was
revealed that the President
angrily rejected artist Peter
Hurd's commissioned portrait of
him as "the ugliest thing I ever
saw."
Mr. Johnson, whose taste in
paintings leans more toward
Norman Rockwell's magazine
style, objected to the Hurd por
trait on the ground that it was
too large, the Capital building in
the background was too prom
inently lit and "inappropriate,"
and the position of the figure
and the general style was not
consistent with other White
House portraits.
Many people, including art
critics and museum directors,
have come to the defense of
Hurd. But as has been the case
lately, very few people have
come to the defense of the Presi
dent. I wish to be included in the
minority.
Poor Likeness
I believe the President had
every right to reject a portrait
of himself if it didn't fit the
image he has of himself. The
likeness of the President as I
saw it in photographs leaves
much to be desired.
In Hurd's portrait the Presi
dent seems to be looking off
dreamily into the distance as if
searching for a consensus or a
friendly congressman. His lips
are set as though he has just
had a conference with a group
of Democratic governors. His
chin looks as if he's just heard a
report from Ambassador Henry
Cabot Lodge on Vietnam, and
his nose looks as if he's just
smelled another resignation in
his White House staff.
The suit he is wearing is dark
and conservative, with a vest,
giving the impression the Presi
dent might be a wealthy real
estate man or a successful tele
vision station owner. And the
book he is holding in his hand
looks as if it could have been
written by Arthur Schlesinger.

But forgetting the portrait for
a moment, anybody could see
why the President would object
to the way Hurd positioned the
Capitol in the background.
Anyone who knows the Presi
dent's personality should havp
been aware that the only way to
pose the President in such a pic
ture was to have him standing
on the Capitol itself with one
foot on the Senate and the other
on the House of Representatives.
Also, if Hurd had studied his
subject more closely he would
have painted the light shining
over the Capital coming from
the President's face and not from
within the Capitol itself.
In the commissioned portrait,
President Johnson objected to
the size of the Capitol, which is
one-sixth the size of the Presi
dent. The implication from the
portrait can be clearly drawn
that the Capitol plays a great

part in the President's life, when
anyone who lives here knows
the exact opposite is true.
I think Hurd owes it to the
president to try again. He could
start by showing the President
smiling as if he just heard that
Bobby Kennedy had an accident
while skiing. Instead of a book,
he could be holding a 1964 Lou
Harris or George Gallup opinion
poll.
Texas Instead
And instead of the Capitol,
Hurd could paint in the L.B.J,
ranch or the Pedernales River.
Many museums are bidding
for Hurd's portrait, but I think
it would be unfair if it were
publicly displayed, particularly
when people know the President
doesn't approve of it.
You can say anything you
want to about President John
son's taste in art, but at least he
knows what he likes.
