# Leary's League Not Novel; LSD Like Old Time Religion
## 
### SLADE LANDER Chicago MAROON 
We tend to look upon religion
as one of the constants of so
ciety; the religions which we
know began hundreds or thou
snds of years before us and will,
we assume, continue equally as
long into the future. Thus Tim
othy Leary's proposal to form a
new religion based upon LSD is
received with mixed feelings
and slight disbelief.
The idea of basing a religion
upon something which is po
tentially dangerous seems
strange. Though Leary acknowl
edged that LSD is potentially
dangerous, the danger is not in
LSD per se but rather in the
fact that any form of energy
can be dangerous and LSD is a
drug which releases reserves of
psychic energy.
Religion, too, can be looked
upon as a form of energy; it is
social, rather than psychic
energy.
Religion is a main stablizing
and motivating force in society
which acts beneficially for both
society and individuals. But re
ligion is a form of energy and

thus it can, like LSD, be poten
tially dangerous. Indeed, many
of the criticisms of LSD can be
applied to religion.
Tortured Minds
The most obvious danger of
LSD is that it can completely
upset the mental balance of a
person who takes it.
But, though the number of
people admitted to Bellevue Men
tal Hospital in New York with
LSD-induced psychosis has been
well publicized, no one has both
ered to go to downtown New
York and count the number of
religious evangelists standing on
street corners, yelling back at
hecklers.
Yet who can judge which
group is more alienated, more
tortured, more in need of help:
the flipped-out acid-head or the
in-turned evangelist.
Few religious people go to
such extremes. Yet, religion can
still be repressive in its nature,
for an individual who bases his
judgment and choices upon a
rigid doctrine rather than upon
his perception of his situation
and his desires must either re

press his desires or alter his
perception to make free choice
and dogma coincide. Thus the di
lemma of Catholics who wish
to plan their families.
Distort Views
Further, people with rigid doc
trines of any kind tend to dis
tort their view of the world to
conform to their doctrines.
Perhaps we are most taken
aback by the insight into God can
be gained through the use of a
chemical or otherwise artificial
device. Yet elaborately architec
tured places of worship, con
trived orders of service, and
grandiose art forms all serve as
articicial means to induce the
religious experience.
It may be that we more read
ily accept these devices because
they are a rich part of our
heritage, while rejecting LSD,
which is devoid of tradition.
Even the motto of Leary's
League of Spiritual Discovery,
"turn on, tune in, drop out,"
could be applied to more con
servative religions.
"Turn on" can be represented
hv the various modes of wnr

ship; "tune in" by the wealth of
religious art; and "drop out" by
the large number of people who
give up a normal place in so
ciety to devote themselves to
their religion.
Use Caution
To criticize religion is not to
condemn it. Indeed, religious
belief can add tremendous
meaning and fulfillment to a
person's life. The main danger
of both religion and of LSD
comes when either is used as a
substitute for, rather than a com
plement to life.
It should be realized that,
novel as the idea of the League
may appear, the gap between
it and other religions is not as
wide as it seems at first.
Other cultures—noteably the
Indians of the Southwest —have
formed religions based upon
psychedelic drugs.
But the League of Spiritual
Discovery should be approached
with great caution, for it com
bines the social energy of re
ligion with the psychic energy of
LSD and so offers potentials,
both good and bad, which far
surpass either alone.

The idea of basing a religion

dangerous, the danger is not in
LSD per se but rather in the

can be dangerous and LSD is a
drug which releases reserves of
psychic energy.
Religion, too, can be looked
upon as a form of energy; it is
social, rather than psychic
energy.
Religion is a main stablizing
and motivating force in society
which acts beneficially for both
society and individuals. But re
ligion is a form of energy and

thus it can, like LSD, be poten

The most obvious danger of
LSD is that it can completely

Yet who can judge which

Few religious people go to
such extremes. Yet, religion can
still be repressive in its nature,
for an individual who bases his
judgment and choices upon a
rigid doctrine rather than upon
his perception of his situation
and his desires must either re

press his desires or alter his
perception to make free choice
and dogma coincide. Thus the di

Perhaps we are most taken

It may be that we more read

they are a rich part of our

which is devoid of tradition.
Even the motto of Leary's
League of Spiritual Discovery,
"turn on, tune in, drop out,"
could be applied to more con

"Turn on" can be represented

the large number of people who
give up a normal place in so
ciety to devote themselves to
their religion.
Use Caution
To criticize religion is not to
condemn it. Indeed, religious
belief can add tremendous
meaning and fulfillment to a
person's life. The main danger
of both religion and of LSD
comes when either is used as a
substitute for, rather than a com
plement to life.
It should be realized that,

it and other religions is not as
