# Student Power—Nothing New

Demands by student activists
and some teaching assistants at
Berkeley that nonstudents be
granted a voice in university
affairs sound like the echo of an
old tradition, with roots in con
tinental Europe and Latin
America.
The American and British phi
losophy sees the campus as a
sanctuary where ideas are stud
ied, debated, analyzed, refined
and readied for action. The stu
dent-dominated, activist ap
proach, on the other hand, is that
of the political university.

The American scheme views
faculty and administration as the
permanent arbiters of goals and
ground rules, with the students
cast in the role of transient par
ticipants.
The other scheme envisages
students, in alliance with com
patible faculty members, in com
mand of political and ideological
goals. This concept naturally in
vites the participation of out
side sympathizers.
The question of who controls
the university goes back to the
13th century and the difference
between the traditions of Paris
and Bologna. In Paris, reputable
scholars set up shop and admit
ted students. In Bologna, stu
dents hired their teachers and
dismissed them. This arrange
ment led to a coalition of the
students' and the professors'
guilds, not unlike the coalition
of today's undergraduate activ
ists with like-minded teaching
assistants.
The dangers of the student
dominated university are i 1 -
lustrated by some intensely po
litical universities in Latin Amer
ica. In some instances students
who might otherwise have been
forced to leave these institutions
are known to be able to "per
suade" their teachers to let
them take examinations in the
same course over and over
again to avoid expulsion.
Professional Students
The party line of many Latin
American student activists is
that anybody who wants to be
come a student should be ad
mitted; nobody is ever expelled
for academic reasons and,
once enrolled, he is part of the
student-dominated power struc
ture. The consequence to the na
tional interest—both in the pro
duction of educated manpow
er and in terms of political sta
bility—is disastrous.
While no such extremes exist
in Berkeley or elsewhere in the
United States, many student ac
tivists are skilled in remaining
on the rolls for much longer
than the four undergraduate
years.
Some achieve this by inter
rupting their studies, as in the
case of Berkeley's Mario Savio,
who spent a year at Oxford and

this year tried unsuccessfully to
be readmitted to the University
of California to which he had
originally transferred from a
small college in New Jersey.
Others do it by taking a min
imum load of courses. One ac
tivist at the City College of New
York has remained a freshman
for almost four years.
The phenomenon of the "per
petual student" has been a long
standing tradition in Central
Europe, especially in Germany.
Many life long non - scholars
were the idle sons of the rich
but others were political agita
tors, frequently ultra-national
ists. Their non-student allies
were rabid fraternity brother
alumni, the "alter Herren" (old
gentlemen), who together with
their student and faculty accom
plices dominated the universities
and wielded politico-economic in
fluence.
Not Much Power
This unofficial power structure
relied heavily on the virtual ab
sence of university administra
tion, with the rector —the clos
est equivalent to the university
president — elected periodically
by the faculty. This arrange
ment probably is closest to the
current American activists'
dream of an administration that
merely cuts the grass. But it
also facilitated the political
takeovers engineered by the Na
zis in German universities and
subsequently by the Commu
nists in such old seats of higher
learning as Charles University
in Prague.
While American alumni can
occasionally be a nuisance, their
interest is too sporadic to be a
major danger. Even during the
McCarthy years, most strong
university administrations were
able to resist right-wing threats.
Radical-right activists inciden
tally tried unsuccessfully, a dec
ade ago, to use nonstudents to
introduce threats of coercion on
American campuses, not unlike
those of today's new left. In
stead of using tactics of physical
obstruction, such as sit-ins, they
called for financial boycott to
dictate the curriculum and to
remove liberal professors.
What makes the present ac
tivism and its alliance with non

students so dissonant is that,
despite its left-revolutionary slo
gans, it faces an American cam
pus tradition that has been a
vital instrument working toward
a progressive, open society.
To be sure, there have been
occasional blots on that record.
But for the most part, the strong
institutions have remained is
lands of independent, often dis
senting liberalism.
They will undoubtedly be abl<
to resist present efforts to
change these traditions. But
those who see Berkeley-type re
volts as nothing more than a
demand for "participatory de
mocracy" might keep in mind
the unhappy historic patterns of
political universities in other
countries and cultures.
