# Letters To The Editor
## UGLY, Axe, Women, TMU: All Grounds For Complaint 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Please print this so I won't
have to write a lot of individual
letters.
To the students: Has anyone
seen the Axe since Big Game?
(We did win, didn't we?)
To the Axe Comm: I mean,
just what do you people do?
To the student who stole all
those Scientific American articles
(on genetics) from the UGLY:
Did you know that you could

have legitimately signed out
those magazines from the Lane
Medical Library and thereby
saved the rest of us a lot of
time, bother and money?
To the UGLY: Next time a
ladies club uses the library for
their social meeting, will you let
the students know, so we can
plan to study somewhere else
that day?
To President Sterling, Dave
Harris, and Hoover Tower:
When?
To the Walter Army Society:
Who is Walter Army?
To the TMU Barbershop: My
God!
To the ASSU travel service
which was supposed to send me
a refund of $250,000 three weeks
ago: Please hurry. My checking
account is overdrawn and I'm
losing all my friends.
To the girls who wear mini
skirts and shouldn't: Don't
To the girls who don't wear
mimiskirts and should : Do.
To the Cal students: Will
someone please send me one of
those Chicken Little buttons? I
live at 792 Matadero, Palo Alto.
Thank you.

It seems to me that a small
item in Thursday's Daily should
not be allowed to pass without
notice: . . certain members of
the Grove Project . . . had been
advised not to participate in the
OFF protest by faculty president
Mark Mancall, assistant profes
sor of history. . .
I believe Mr. Mancall owes
the entire community an ex
planation for this intrusion up
on both the privacy and the civil
rights of students. I know little
of the details of the Grove Proj
ect, but I understand that Mr.
Mancall sees himself as a friend
of students and of liberal causes.
With a friend like this, who
needs enemies?

Editor, The Daily:
The primary purpose of the
statement which we and other
faculty signed is not to "support
Viet War protestors," as your
headline suggests (The Daily,
January 10th). As we assert in
that statement, "we are not all
in agreement with the views of
those who participated in the
[recent disturbances at Berke
ley]," a fact that is neither ex
plicit nor implied in your article.
The point on which we all do
agree is the necessity for "in
tellectual independence and free
dom of political action and as
sociation" in the university com
munity. This, our real intent,
would have been clear had you
emphasized it in your headline
and opening paragraph, clearer
still had you published the state
ment's text in full.

I should like to address my
self to all who continually squab
ble about the poor quality, inef
ficiency, and particularly the
high cost of Stanford services.
I find it most annoying that
these people either do not know
or have chosen to forget that
the remittances of a student who
pays full tuition, room, board,
etc., do not come close to de
fraying the costs of his educa
tion at this institution.
Might I ask them to forget
their soft palates and any other
reason they might have for
their tormented existence here
and observe closely, for a start,
the new library.
To he who complains of his
financial over-extension and the
seeming little comfort he re
ceives in return, I remind him
that there was once a time that
those of his forbears who would
have encountered a similar sit
uation, would never have en
joyed higher education at all.

I should like to address my
self to all who continually squab
ble about the poor quality, inef
ficiency, and particularly the
high cost of Stanford services.
I find it most annoying that
these people either do not know
or have chosen to forget that
the remittances of a student who
pays full tuition, room, board,
etc., do not come close to de
fraying the costs of his educa
tion at this institution.
Might I ask them to forget
their soft palates and any other
reason they might have for
their tormented existence here
and observe closely, for a start,
the new library.
To he who complains of his
financial over-extension and the
seeming little comfort he re
ceives in return, I remind him
that there was once a time that
those of his forbears who would
have encountered a similar sit
uation, would never have en
joyed higher education at all.

Please print this so I won't
have to write a lot of individual
letters.
To the students: Has anyone
seen the Axe since Big Game?
(We did win, didn't we?)
To the Axe Comm: I mean,
just what do you people do?
To the student who stole all
those Scientific American articles
(on genetics) from the UGLY:
Did you know that you could

have legitimately signed out
those magazines from the Lane
Medical Library and thereby
saved the rest of us a lot of
time, bother and money?
To the UGLY: Next time a
ladies club uses the library for
their social meeting, will you let
the students know, so we can
plan to study somewhere else
that day?
To President Sterling, Dave
Harris, and Hoover Tower:
When?
To the Walter Army Society:
Who is Walter Army?
To the TMU Barbershop: My
God!
To the ASSU travel service
which was supposed to send me
a refund of $250,000 three weeks

account is overdrawn and I'm
losing all my friends.
To the girls who wear mini

It seems to me that a small
item in Thursday's Daily should
not be allowed to pass without
notice: . . certain members of
the Grove Project . . . had been
advised not to participate in the
OFF protest by faculty president
Mark Mancall, assistant profes
sor of history. . .
I believe Mr. Mancall owes
the entire community an ex
planation for this intrusion up
on both the privacy and the civil
rights of students. I know little
of the details of the Grove Proj
ect, but I understand that Mr.
Mancall sees himself as a friend
of students and of liberal causes.
With a friend like this, who
needs enemies?

Editor, The Daily:
The primary purpose of the
statement which we and other
faculty signed is not to "support
Viet War protestors," as your
headline suggests (The Daily,
January 10th). As we assert in
that statement, "we are not all
in agreement with the views of
those who participated in the
[recent disturbances at Berke
ley]," a fact that is neither ex
plicit nor implied in your article.
The point on which we all do
agree is the necessity for "in
tellectual independence and free
dom of political action and as
sociation" in the university com
munity. This, our real intent,
would have been clear had you
emphasized it in your headline
and opening paragraph, clearer
still had you published the state
ment's text in full.

Editor, The Daily:
I should like to address my
self to all who continually squab
ble about the poor quality, inef
ficiency, and particularly the
high cost of Stanford services.
I find it most annoying that
these people either do not know
or have chosen to forget that
the remittances of a student who
pays full tuition, room, board,
etc., do not come close to de
fraying the costs of his educa
tion at this institution.
Might I ask them to forget
their soft palates and any other
reason they might have for
their tormented existence here
and observe closely, for a start,
the new library.
To he who complains of his
financial over-extension and the
seeming little comfort he re
ceives in return, I remind him
that there was once a time that
those of his forbears who would
have encountered a similar sit
uation, would never have en
joyed higher education at all.
