# Book-Packers In Demand For IIR Project
## Vietbound

The basement of Burbank house
may look like a library, but that's
only because there are 15,000 books
stored there.
And Burbank may well have to
start a library if these books aren't
packed and ready to be sent to Viet
nam and Africa by Monday. The In
stitute for International Relations has
sponsored several drives to send books
to Vietnam and Africa in the past
five years, but they were just notified
recently that these books have to be
ready for shipment by Monday.
The books for Viecnam are being
transported to Southeast Asia through
the Asia Foundation of San Francisco,
and the volumes for Africa, which
total 200 lbs., will be shipped by the
Darien Book Aid Plan of Darien, Con
necticut.
Packing these books will take much
help, noted Stef Halper, lIR Presi
dent, who urged that anyone inter
ested in packing the books, which will
be distributed on a "person-to-person"
basis, regardless of ideology, should
stop by the Burbank Libraryâ€”base
ment, that is, between 3 p.m. and 6
p.m. this afternoon or tomorrow.

The lIR needs every able hand to help pack the books for
Vietnam. One member of the group emphasized that this
is not a political move, but a humanitarian gesture, and
hoped that l>oth those supporting and those opposed to the
war in Vietnam would help pack.
