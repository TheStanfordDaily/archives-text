# LASSU TONIGHT
## Open House Tops Agenda 
### SUE DONNELLY 
The ASSU Legislature (LASSU)
will discuss the new recommendation
on open house hours by the Commit
tee of Fifteen at tonight's meeting.
The Executive Committee of the
Academic Council has already ap
proved the new hours, and LASSU
may pass them tonight.
If passed, the new regulations will
supersede the ASSU open house
hours presently in effect.
Basic Hours
The basic plan of the new hours
is four days of open house per week,
from noon to midnight, with the days
to be chosen by the individual house.
A three-quarters vote of a house
can liberalize the hours to a maxi
mum of 7 days per week, 10 a.m. to
2:30 a.m. A majority vote can restrict
the hours in any way. Votes are to be
by secret ballot.
LASSU will also consider a proposal
to establish a legislative commission
to work on community government.
The commission would be charged
with preparing plans for a sharing of
responsibility among the ASSU and
the faculty.
An additional clause recommends
that the commission begin immediate

consideration of bringing faculty
members into LASSU's legislative and
judicial branches.

LASSU Speaker Tom Forstenzer
told The Daily yesterday that students
can offer to provide a forum for all
constituencies—students, faculty, and
administrators—by offering an orga
nization in which views on campus
life (other than academic) can be
presented and resolved.
Such a forum would aim at increas
ing communication, understanding,
and involvement among the constit
uencies.
"Students already have the re
sources to play a role within faculty
bodies, such as the Academic Coun
cil, although they have not done so,"
Forstenzer said.
"Students can offer a reciprocal op
portunity, by bringing the faculty
into the ASSU structure," he said.
Three Constituencies
Forstenzer pointed out that the
Committee of Fifteen is now the only
tripartite structure in which the uni
versity's three constituencies can meet
as equal participants. This group's
success suggests greater use of such
organized interaction, according to
Forstenzer.

LASSU will also discuss The Daily's
request for funds to enable Editor
Jim Selna and Associate Editor Chris
Harte to attend The National College
Editors' Conference of the U.S. Press
Association.
The Dailj has received a $250 grant
from the U.S. Student Press Associa
tion. The conference will be held in
Washington, D.C., during the week
end of February 4th.

to work on community government.
The commission would be charged
with preparing plans for a sharing of
responsibility among the ASSU and
the faculty.
An additional clause recommends
that the commission begin immediate

consideration of bringing faculty
members into LASSU's legislative and
judicial branches.

LASSU Speaker Tom Forstenzer
told The Daily yesterday that students
can offer to provide a forum for all
constituencies—students, faculty, and
administrators—by offering an orga
nization in which views on campus
life (other than academic) can be
presented and resolved.
Such a forum would aim at increas
ing communication, understanding,
and involvement among the constit
uencies.
"Students already have the re
sources to play a role within faculty
bodies, such as the Academic Coun
cil, although they have not done so,"
Forstenzer said.
"Students can offer a reciprocal op
portunity, by bringing the faculty
into the ASSU structure," he said.
Three Constituencies
Forstenzer pointed out that the
Committee of Fifteen is now the only
tripartite structure in which the uni
versity's three constituencies can meet
as equal participants. This group's
success suggests greater use of such
organized interaction, according to
Forstenzer.

LASSU will also discuss The Daily's
request for funds to enable Editor
Jim Selna and Associate Editor Chris
Harte to attend The National College
Editors' Conference of the U.S. Press
Association.
The Dailj has received a $250 grant
from the U.S. Student Press Associa
tion. The conference will be held in
Washington, D.C., during the week
end of February 4th.
The ASSU Legislature (LASSU)
will discuss the new recommendation
on open house hours by the Commit
tee of Fifteen at tonight's meeting.
The Executive Committee of the
Academic Council has already ap
proved the new hours, and LASSU
may pass them tonight.
If passed, the new regulations will
supersede the ASSU open house
hours presently in effect.
Basic Hours
The basic plan of the new hours
is four days of open house per week,
from noon to midnight, with the days
to be chosen by the individual house.
A three-quarters vote of a house
can liberalize the hours to a maxi
mum of 7 days per week, 10 a.m. to
2:30 a.m. A majority vote can restrict
the hours in any way. Votes are to be
by secret ballot.
LASSU will also consider a proposal
to establish a legislative commission
to work on community government.
The commission would be charged

responsibility among the ASSU and
