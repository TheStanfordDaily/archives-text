# Heritage Fund Reports Record For 1967 Undergraduate Aid
## 
### 
Senior students have collected a
record sum of $20,510 for the Stan
ford Heritage Fund, which will pro
vide scholarships to 17 undergraduates
in 1967.
Donations were received primarily
from businessmen in surrounding com
munities. They contributed in response
to an appeal by some 50 students who
last year spent many hours over a
four-month period explaining the pur
pose of the project.
Chairman of the drive was Frank
Morse, a Phi Beta Kappa Stanford
graduate now studying at Harvard
Law School.
There were 57 community donors
this year, nearly doubling the 30 of
1965, when the fund totaled $12,767.
The scholarships will provide financial
assistance to freshmen and sopho
mores who are chosen on the basis of
leadership qualities and according to
need.
The Heritage Fund was established
in 1955 as a continuing program. It
was designed so that the Stanford
senior class may make an annual gift

to the University to be used for schol
arships, which act as encouragement
to beginning students working toward
degrees.
Enlisting the help of the commu
nity in the project serves the purpose

of increasing town-and-gown contacts
and understanding.
Since the fund began operation,
scholarships totaling nearly $175,000
have been awarded to 128 first and
second year students.
