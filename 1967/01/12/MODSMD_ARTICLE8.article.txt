# "You Can't Cooperate With Killing" â€” Harris
## 
### MARK FOGELMAN 
David Harris, student body presi
dent, will be the main speaker today
at a noon rally in White Memorial
Plaza to begin concerted opposition
to the draft. Harris, who has returned
his 2-S deferment to his draft board on
the grounds that this deferment dis
criminates against other Americans
of draft age and that the government
has no right to require service, is
now 1-A. Harris has stated that he

does not intend to submit to induction
into the armed forces.
When asked by The Daily what he
specifically intends to discuss today,
Harris replied, "I intend to support
mass civil disobedience against the
selective service system."
"What I propose," he added, "is
that individuals go to jail rather than
join the army. You can't be a student
and co-operate with killing."
The rally, organized by the Stanford
chapter of Students for a Democratic
Society, will also be addressed by
Mark Kleiman, a travelling organizer
for SDS, and Art Zellerman and
Marc Sapir, two Stanford anti-war
activists. Kleiman hopes to co
ordinate the local anti-draft unions
which SDS will establish through all
its chapters.
"The rally will be the first step in
a campaign to build an anti-draft
movement at Stanford," said Leonard
W. B. Siegel, freshman member of
SDS. "We hope to form an organiza
tion which will oppose the draft, both
as an institution incompatible with
the American way of life and as a
tool without which the War in Viet
nam and Thailand and interventions
in Latin America could not take
place."
