# Harris Asks Massive Resistance To Draft
## 
### 
People should not relate to the
world "by looking down the barrel of
a gun," ASSU President Dave Harris
told a noon rally of the Students for
a Democratic Society in White Plaza
yesterday.
Harris indicated students have two
choices: either be drafted and serve
the purposes of war or "save America
from violence" by refusing to be
drafted.
An end to war will come only
when "we, the conscriptees, refuse to
be cannon fodder any more," Harris
explained.
Better World
The idea of "spending our lives for
the betterment of the world is in
validated by being conscripted . . .
because our responsibility to human
ity will never be fulfilled by waging
war." Harris challenged his predom
inantly male audience to "choose to
build a better world instead of blow
ing it up."
Harris said he has returned his
2-S deferment and expects to be jailed
following graduation in June. He
added that he would rather go to jail
than accept military service if
he were a Chinese or a Russian.

"I don't think any power in the world
is trying to make peace," he em
phasized.
Responding to questions following
the talk, Harris said that selective ser
vice and war "are not a question of
having a lot of evil people . . . Gl's
don't smile while bombing civilians.
. . . A lot of people are taught war
is a good thing to do. The late movies
tell us that those who kill the most
Japs get the girls."
Little Change
Concerning the protest over the Viet
nam War, Harris indicated protesters
are getting tired of marching and see
that it doesn't change things much.
Because of this trend, students may
rely more on the power of personal
example by becoming conscientious
objectors: "It may jolt America when
a lot of middle-class sons choose jail
rather than military service. Students
have an obligation to tell their par
ents what they think is rightâ€”and
that's not easy," he explained.
Harris estimated more than 200
Stanford students might apply for
conscientious objector status. He said
he rejects the alternative of non

combatant status because "if there
must be killing, you have no right to
send others out to do your butcher
ing."
Massive Resistance
Nothing will be accomplished unless
resistance is massive, Harris said.
He called on other students to refuse
to be drafted and join him in jail.
The purpose of the Students for a
Democratic Society is to encourage
this kind of large-scale opposition to
eonsciiption. SDS is currently orga
nizing unions of draft resistance on
campuses across the country.
The SDS is also concerned with
reaching students at the high school
level. SDS President Marc Sapir sup
ported this idea by saying that of the
450 men prosecuted last year for re
sisting the draft, most were not from
the academic community. Resistance
to the draft has a wider base of
support than just college students, he
said.
Harris summed up the spirit of the
meeting: "The only way there are
enemies is when there are two of
them. When I say I won't be your
enemy, it's hard for you to become
one."
