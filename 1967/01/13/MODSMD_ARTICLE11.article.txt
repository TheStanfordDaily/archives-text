# Tune In, Drop Out At Be-In
## 
### MAGGIE McCOMAS Hippie Editor 
Poets, musicians, and various other
members of the love generation (be
they activists or pacifists) will gather
at the Polo Grounds in Golden Gate
Park in San Francisco Saturday for
the first nationwide "Gathering of the
Tribes."
The "Be-In", originated by several
Haight-Ashbury residents will be from
1-5 p.m. There will be on hand such
guests as Allen Ginsberg (reading
poetry), Leary and Alpert (dropping
out), several San Francisco folk-rock
groups (freaking out) and other
sights and sounds.

Other Bay Area talents will be
pnets Jerry Ruben, Gary Snyder,
and Lenore Kandel.
World of Brothers
In an interview yesterday, Allen
Cohen, poet and clerk at the Psyche
delic Book Shop, said that the pur
pose of the gathering was to affirm
a "world of brothers" and to over
come the alienation of a society guid
ed by profit and materialistic goals.
He called on all "tribesmen" to "Tune
in, drop out, and take over."
Gary Snyder, Bay Area poet, ex
plained that such a take-over would
have no ideological, political bases or
aims. He said that it would, rather, be

a recognition of diversity among all
human beings and appreciation of the
creativity originating from such areas
as the Haight-Ashbury district.
Primitive Hippies
Snyder also explained his belief
that the so-called hippies of the dis
trict are actually "primitives" of an
as yet unknown culture which will
eventually recognize full development
as a meeting of East and West cul
tures.
The spokesman said 20,000 to 50,000
"tribesmen" are expected. The Be-In
is free and all are invited to attend,
bringing "flowers, beads, feathers,
bells, cymbals, and flags."
