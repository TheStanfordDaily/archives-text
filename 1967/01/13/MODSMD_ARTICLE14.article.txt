# University LSD Group Wants Campus Status
## 
### 
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 3 (CPS)—
A new religious organization
may join the Christian Associa
tion, Hillel, and the Newman
Club at Roosevelt University if
a student League for Spiritual
Discovery (LSD) can gain of
ficial campus recognition.
The group, an offshoot of
former Harvard psychologist
Timothy Leary's new psychedelic
"religion," applied for campus
recognition last month, but Dean
of Students George Watson post
poned a decision until he could
obtain legal advice.
Watson said his "preliminary
judgment" would be to deny
recognition because the group
"is organized for an illegal pur
pose and therefore cannot be
recognized as a Roosevelt stu
dent group."
The organization dedicated to
the use of the controversial

1
drug, differs from other reli
gions, founder Bill Moore, a
Roosevelt graduate student, said,
because it does not "turn sacra
ment into sacrilege."
"We use the word 'religion'
because the experiental aspects
of our movement cannot be well
fitted under any other name—
we're not political activists, we're
not athletes, we're not addicts."
The group plans to hold a
series of lectures (possibly in
cluding the appearance of Tim
othy Leary) and films, along
with "esoteric dances represent
ing the natural live birth of the
grand lama of Tibet," Moore
said. Moore added that the group
may conduct a "psychedelic book
sale" and noted, tongue-in-cheek,
that they were "thinking of put
ting 'acid' in the coffee machine
and freaking out the school."
