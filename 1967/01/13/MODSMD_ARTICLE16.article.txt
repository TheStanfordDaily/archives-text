WASHINGTON (AP) — Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy renewed hta
attack on the Selective Service
system yesterday declaring that
what he called its uncertainty,
unfairness and inflexibility has
led to a "tragic loss of confi
dence . . . around the country."
The Massachusetts Democrat
said Congress must overhaul the
system this year "to reduce the
inequities as much as we can."
Key parts of the legislation ex
pires June 30.
"If we let another four years
pass without making changes,"
the Senator said, "we will havr
failed in our responsibilities to
the young people of America."
Wealthy Students
In a speech to the National
Press Club, Kennedy attacked
the draft as "a system which
sends tens of thousands o'
young men into the army simply
because they cannot afford to
go to college; and which lets
75 per cent of those wealthy
enough or bright enough to go
on to graduate school escape
military service completely."
To combat what he termed thi?
built-in unfairness, Kennedy
urged Congress to approve five
suggestions he has made in the
past:
1. Revise the present policy
of drafting the oldest eligible
men first and instead take 18-
and 19-year olds.
2. Begin a national system of
selection to put the order of
induction on a uniform basis
around the country. The 4,088
local draft boards still would be
responsible for classifying the
individual registrant.
End Deferments
3. Eliminate most of the pres
ent educational and occupational
deferments. Those who did get
educational deferments would
face military service after com
pleting their education.
4. Revise the mental and phys
ical armed service standards to
bring in the more than 2 mil
lion men now classified IY—
those unqualified mentally or
physically.
5. Begin a lottery system
which would place all 18-year-old
youths in a pool with each hav
ing the same chance of being
drafted.
Equal Chance
Kennedy said the lottery sys
tem would replace the present
system of deferments "with a
single national selective system,
in which all young men would
stand an equal chance of get
ting called."
President Johnson also urged
a change in the draft laws in his
State of the Union address Tues
day night. He is expected to
make a series of recommenda
tions to Congress within the next
few weeks.
Last summer he authorized a
20-member National Commission
on the Selective Service, which
has held hearings and Is ex
pected to report to the President
early next month. The commis
sion reportedly will call for a
tightening of national deferment
guidelines and also is known to
be debating a modified lottery
plan plus reversal of the present
system of taking the oldest first.
