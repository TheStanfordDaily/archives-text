# International Students-Diversified
## 
### SUSAN KENT 
Yuri Zevakin and Veleri Efremov face more than the usual adjust
ments of foreign students at Stanford. As Soviet citizens, both must
obtain permits from the U.S. State Department whenever they wish
to travel more than 25 miles from Stanford. "We don't mind telling
the State Department where we are going," Yuri explained. "We just
*nind having to tell them a week in advance."
Yuri and Valeri voice the frequent complaints of international stu
dents at Stanford concerning available housing. Ideally, they would
prefer an on-campus living situation with kitchen privileges. Unable
to obtain an apartment in Escondido, and depressed by the four
drab walls in Crothers, they chose to move off-campus. Still they have
.lifficulty finding good, home-made borsht. Although both are mar
ried, they had to leave their wives in the Soviet Union this year for
financial reasons.
Both graduate students in engineering, Yuri and Valeri are on
U.S. and Soviet government sponsored scholarships at Stanford. Yuri
is engaged in research on heat and mass transfer while Valeri is in
vestigating the properties of metals for the creation of new technical
processes. Although both students rate Stanford's mechanical engi
neering department on a par with their own Moscow Tech, they are
critical of some aspects of the American system of education. "Self
study is a good thing," Yuri commented, "but we are all human and,
therefore, sometimes wrong." According to Yuri, Soviet professors
.spend more hours per week with students than do their American
counterparts. Because "specialists handle education there," Valeri
thinks that the system is more efficient.
Because they are male graduate students in engineering, Yuri
and Valeri are representative of Stanford's international student pop
ulation in at least three respects.
Who Comes And Why
Of the 1016 foreign students who registered autumn quarter, 92 per
cent were men and 78 per cent were graduate men. According to the
same statistics, the total (male and female) ratio of graduate to un
dergraduate foreign students is 84.5 per cent to 15.5 per cent. A sur
vey of enrollment by departments shows that the largest single per
centage (40 per cent) of international students study engineering.
The next largest group (30 per cent) are enrolled in various divisions
of the humanities, while the third largest section (8.6 per cent) are
undeclared majors in General Studies.
As for their national origin, Yuri and Valeri are two members of
a minority of three Soviet students at Stanford. 317 students, or 31
per cent of the internationals, come from countries in Asia or the
South Pacific, including Australia and New Zealand. Europeans still
form a large percentage (27.1 per cent) of Stanford's internationals,
while the Latin Americans have been the third largest group (now 16.9
per cent) since the Canadians (now 12.3 per cent) lost the lead in
1962. Students from the Middle East and North Africa compose 8.1 per
cent (82 students) of the internationals at Stanford, while 3 per cent
(39) come from Africa south of the Sahara and .5 per cent (5) are
stateless.
Foreign students sometimes seek admittance to Stanford entirely on
their own whim and initiative. Edward Azar, a Lebanese who heads
the Stanford Arab Club, first considered coming to the United States
for graduate study when he was at the American University i\t Beirut.
On the recommendation of American friends there, Edward' did his
first year of graduate work at the University of the Pacific. He trans
fered to Stanford last year to continue toward his Ph.D. in political
science.
Edward plans to return to Lebanon to enter national politics in some
form, either working for the government or a private institution. At
Stanford he is writing his dissertation on the role of the League of
Arab States in regional integration.
Programs
Although some internationals apply to Stanford entirely on their
own, many do so in connection with government programs. Among
the official exchange programs in which Stanford participates are the
Keio summer project, the Keio year-long scholarship program where
one Japanese and one Stanford student exchange places for a year,
a similar program with the Free University of Berlin and the Ameri

can University at Beirut, and summer projects with Peru, Guanabara,
and Volunteers-in-Asia.
U.S.-Russian Scholarships
Most of the exchange programs operate between national govern
ments rather than between specific academic institutions. Yuri and
Valeri are both here on full tuition and room and board scholarships
sponsored by a State Department Exchange with the Soviet govern
ment. Yuri's professor at Moscow Tech encouraged him to apply for
the program. He had to complete applications and pass an English
exam, but, in the end, he states, "I can't really know why I was chosen.
To understand that, one would have to talk with all the applicants not
chosen."
Alice Dzakpasu, a Roble girl and, therefore, a specialty among
Stanford's international student population, did not apply to Stanford
specifically. In Ghana she entered a scholarship competition sponsored
by the Afro-American Institute. One of 16 students selected from 300
applicants in Ghana, Alice came to Stanford only because it was one of
the universities participating in the exchange program. After complet
ing her study of chemistry here, she plans to return to Ghana and
teach. Alice has 15 brothers and sisters, two of whom have studied in
Britain. "That's one of the reasons I preferred coming to America," she
added.
Brain Drain
Most of the government-sponsored scholarships function on the
premise that American-educated internationals will return to their
own countries. But a significant portion remain in the United States
after completing their study. Because human talents and skills are re
garded as prime national assets, the migration of educated persons
from emerging nations poses political as well as ethical problems. The
"brain drain" raises the question of U.S. accountability for siphoning
off the intellectual capacity of other societies.
The National Association for Foreign Student Affairs is currently
doing research on where internationals go and what they do after
studying in the U.S. According to Gwyn Dukes, program counselor at
the I-Center, certain countries, such as Formosa and Korea, are noted
for losing their students to the U.S. Recently Mrs. Dukes notes a trend
where internationals already have jobs lined up at home when they
come to Stanford.
A Brain 'Untapped 9 . . .
At least one international student at Stanford faces a problem of
the brain drain in reverse. Saad Raheem, president of the I-Center, is
of Pakistani background but grew up in Kenya. Despite his experience
and formal education in communication, all Saad's recent applications
for government positions in Kenya have been rejected. Under a new
government policy designed to enhance the employment opportunities
for indigenous blacks, Kenya will not hire Pakistanis.
"What hurts," Saad went on, "is that I have something to contribute
to my country and they won't take it." As a student in Nairobi, Saad
was elected by African university students to represent them as their
president. He also broadcast a weekly radio program for teen-agers
in Kenya.
Saad Raheem's delight with the new Grove Project suggests the
greatest need common to international students at Stanford—a living
situation which promotes contact with other Stanford students.

The foreign student faces all the obstacles in meeting people which
confront the American graduate student at Stanford. He tends to meet
only those people who are in his own area of study, and he has little
contact with the undergraduates who form the nucleus of student
activity at Stanford. Foreign students face additional problems in liv
ing off-campus since many cannot afford their own cars.
A new proposal for an on-campus International House, as distinct
from the International Center, is soon going before the Committee on
Undergraduate Education. Although no word is definite, Deans Wert
and Hind are open to the idea, according to Stef Halper, Institute for
International Relations president.
Community Services
Perhaps the next obvious adjustment which the foreign student
faces is the language barrier. In addition to the special courses in En
glish offered by the university, the Community Committee for Inter
national Students sponsors an "English in Action" program. Last quar
ter 130 foreign students met for conversation once a week on a one-to
one basis with volunteers from the community.
This committee also helps internationals upon their immediate ar
rival in the Bay Area. They meet students at the plane, provide them
with a temporary place to stay, and advise them in their search for
more permanent housing. A student-run pre-registration program fur
thers the orientation of foreign students at Stanford. Each interna
tional student has a departmental advisor, as well as the opportunity to
speak with one of the I-Center's three foreign student advisors —Bob
Phillips, Warren Hayward, and Richard Erb.
Bob Phillips encounters many special problems in his work with
foreign students at Stanford. "Some students from Rhodesia and South
Africa have actually lost their governments while they have been
here," he explained. Since a person without a passport does not legally
exist, Bob has to obtain a new legal status for these students. When
political unheavals occur abroad, students often lose their means of
financial support since their parents lose their jobs. Changes in the
international economy also affect the position of foreign students at
Stanford. As a result of the recent re-evaluation of the rupee, Stan
ford lost half of the Indian applicants who had planned to come here
this year.
