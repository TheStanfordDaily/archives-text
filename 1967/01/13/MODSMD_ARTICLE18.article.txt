# I-Center: Campus Crossroads
## 
### GAIT, ANDERSON 
Behind the glass doors of the white Snan-
Sh-style building past the Tresidder parking
lot lie opportunities for experiences as varied
and exciting as any that can be found at
Stanford.
In the big homelike lounge of the Bechtel
International Student Center, students sit
around talking, reading or just relaxing. A
oroup of French students and an American
professor discuss the difficulties of communi
cation in political areas. Just off the lounge
in the library, students are studying or read
ing one of the 75 foreign periodicals sub
scribed to by the I-Center.
•Evening's Abroad'
Outside the lounge in the entrance, a bul
'-?tin board gives intimations of the variety
of activities focused around the I-Center.
Posters advertise an Evening Abroad in Aus
tralia, a program of classical Indian dance,
a theater trip to O'Neill's "Touch of the
Poet," and lunch discussion groups on for
eign affairs.
Program counselor Gwyneth Dukes ex

plains the Evening Abroad programs: "Each
Saturday evening one of the nationality
groups presents a program which may in
clude folk dances, music, skits, slides and
talks about their particular country. For the
student who fi?els he is taking too much
from the community, it is not only a good
experience but a chance to contribute to the
experience of the community."
Theater trips; every other Friday include
dinner at various foreign restaurants in San
Francisco, seeing a play, and talking after
wards with the cast of the play. Another re
lated activity is the Thursday film series,
which this quarter features outstanding
American and foreign comedies. Afterwards
students in communications and other film
experts lead discussions of the films.
Americans, Too
One of the most popular programs is the
lunch discussion groups. American and for
eign students eat lunch together once a
week and discuss a given topic in an infor
mal situation. Some of this quarter's topics
include Student Revolt and University Re
form, Southeast Asia, Latin America, and
The American Personality.
The Friday coffee hours and the Tuesday
afternoon current events coffee hours pro
vide similar opportunities for informal dis
cussions and get-togethers. These activities
are open to American as well as foreign stu
dents.
'The problem with the I-Center," says Rod
Trench, vice-president of the International
Club,, "is that American students have the
misconception that it's just for foreign stu
dents. It may be a gap in information and
communication, or simply that the American
students don't feel at home here. The I-
Centcr was intended to be a gathering place
for everyone, but it has turned out to be
mosUy foreign students. Americans seem to
forget that 'international' includes America."
Second Home
What is the I-Center to the foreign stu
dents? Saad Raheem, president of the In
ternational Club explains:
"To some, the I-Center is like a home.
They come in in the evening to watch tele
vision or read the newspaper or talk. It has
a congenial atmosphere — and there is al
ways; someone to talk to, something inter
esting being discussed. To others, it is just
a point of information and recreation, a
place to play ping pong or get information

on visas. American students like it because
they can come and meet foreign students.
Language majors can make friends from the
country whose language they are studying.
Some people like to listen to foreign broad
casts on our short-wave radio. And then
there are some who come because they have
formed friendships among international stu
dents and this is a convenient place to meet."
Flexibility
The International Club coordinates its ac
tivities with the I-Center and sponsors such
programs as a ski trip and in the future
trips to Yosemite and the Grand Canyon.
The problem of bringing American and
foreign students together is still a major
one, according to most people concerned. One
way to help remedy this problem is being
tried by Sheri Gillette, coordinator of the
International Representatives program.
"The program," she explains, "serves to
establish a liaison between international or
ganizations and students and the various
living groups on campus. About 50 houses
or wing units have chosen to participate in
it so far. A representative of each living unit
comes to meetings, learns what's going on in
international affairs on campus, and spreads
this information by person-to-person publi
city. This can also be the beginning of infor
mal groups which form to solve a specific
problem they see or work on a project. The
system is meant to be flexible.
Living Groups
"The second part of the program involves
foreign student associates who eat a meal
in one of the dorms or living units and par
ticipate in the activities of the group. Since
most of the foreign students live off campus,
this is an ideal way to get them involved in
on campus activities and to establish con
tacts and friendships with other students."
The activities of the International Center
seem to provide "something for everyone" —
whether his interests be cultural, political,
artistic, or simply meeting people and de
veloping friendships.
"We are always open for new ideas," says
Gwyn Dukes. "Anyone with creative ideas
for new programs should suggest them so
that we can broaden our activities to include
even more Stanford students. When many
students from a cross-section of the campus
find something in the I-Center that is of per
sonal interest to them, we wil be well on the
way to fulfilling the purpose of a really 'in
ternational' center."
