# Should Foreign Students Criticize The United States?

Foreign students attending schools in the
United States often are plagued with the
question of whether or not to participate
in U.S. politics and particularly dissent.
In an informal discussion at the Interna
tional Center yesterday with Dr. Kenneth
Cooper, Director of the I-Center and Associate
Dean of the Graduate Division for Interna
tional Students, various attitudes on this
question were brought out and considered.
Because so many issues with which stu
dents are concerned today are not merely
political questions, but people-to-people is
sues. Dr. Cooper feels that lack of paiiticipa
tion might lead to "not jus full an experi
ence" while in the United States.
Cooper saw a great value In a cross cul
tural exchange of idea on this level and felt
that if tlds were applied to a greater extent
it would lead to a reduction of tension in
the world through awareness of nations'
ideals, hopes, and background.
He added (hat while most of the foreign
students here are "very involved in their pro
fessional role," he hoped that they could de
vote some of their time to world concern
as well.

One foreign student from France men
tioned that his country asked not to par
ticipate in political discussion as one of the
conditions for his scholarship to come here.
He explained that he was sure his gov
ernment had no "objection to speaking with
groups of twos and threes," but he thought
that his country would not appreciate his
"speaking to a panel or conference as a
representative of his country."
The great majority of the participators
however tended to disagree, and felt that his
case was in a small minority.
One of the foreign students in the discus
sion felt that the international student was
perhaps more qualified to take part In dis
cussion of such "human" concerns because,
for the most part, he had traveled more
widely and experienced more than American
students.
Dr. Cooper summed up the thoughts of
most of the participants in a statement he
made in The Daily last spring:
"The student today must be a whole per
son, and the university should provide the
stimulation and the environment that will
allow him to exoell In his scholarly pursuits
and, at the same time, to relate himself
and his academic program to the real world
around him."

dents are concerned today are not merely
