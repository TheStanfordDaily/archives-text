# Naval Fisticuffs Mark Opening Of Promising Boxing Season
## 
### 
The Stanford boxing team, un
der the coaching of .Ray Lun
ny, opens its 1967 season to
night at 8 p.m., in the Encina
Gym, against a team represent
ing the United States Navy.
Lunny, himself once a rank
ing contender in the professional
ring and Stanford coach for 20
years, predicts a fine season and
calls this year's team "One of
the best groups I have had."
The Stanford varsity team is
picked from the regu'ar Univer
sity physical education classes
and represents Stanford in what

is now the only intercollegiate
boxing league in the United
States.
4 Team League
Other teams in the league are
California at Berkeley, Univer
sity of Nevada, and Chico State
College. Meets against these
teams and other local teams
such as the Navy comprise the
boxing season.
Heading this year's team are
Tom Jenks in the 172 pound
class and Jim Marlar in the 156
pound division. Jenks is the con
ference champion in his class
and lost only one bout last year

to a man whom he later de
feated.
Marlar, a senior, did not par
ticipate in last year's champion
ship tourney but had a fine var
sity season. He should be the
league's man-to-beat in his
weight division on the basis of
last year's results and his im
provement this year.
The Big Men
The team boasts of at least
three fine heavyweights includ
ing Eric De Gooyer, Dave Os
wald, and Mike Palmer. De Goo
yer and Oswald had a great deal
of varsity experience last year
and all the heavyweights should
see action this year as more
than one many may box in a
given meet in each division.
A newcomer to this year's
varsity is Don Van Buskirk at
180 pounds. Van Buskirk did not
box on the team last season but
has fought his way up in the
fall and winter drills. The only
other first-year man is Barney
Adler, a rugged man in the 156
pound class.
John Price, Bill Thomas, and
Dave Hibbitts round out the
team at the 165, 147, and 139 di
visions respectively. All are vet
eran boxers and Price and
Thomas should be strong con
tenders in their divisions.
Lone Injury
The team is physically fit for
this opening meet as there have
been no injuries this quarter.
John Merrill, a 165 pounder on
last year's varsity, is out for the
season due to a broken hand re
ceived in last quarter's practice
sessions.
The exact card for the Navy
meet has not been determined,
but Navy will bring a full team
and most of the Stanford squad
will see action.
