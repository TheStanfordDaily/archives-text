# Indians, Trojans, Bruins... And Lew's Giant Shadow
## 
### NICK SELBY 
A spirited Tribe of Stanford
basketball players don their war
bonnets for a foray into Los
Angeles against two top con
ference teams, USC tonight and
UCLA tomorrow night.
If the Tribe's isn't quick
enough, a few feathers from the
war bonnet will very likely be
missing when they return to
Stanford. UCLA is ranked num
ber one in the nation, and fea
tures the giant 7'l" Lew Alcin
dor, perhaps the most danger
ous player in the nation.
Bruins Unbeaten
So far, no team in the nation
has been able to even stay close
to UCLA except Washington
State when Alcindor got into
foul trouble. The Bruins (10-0)
lead the conference in scoring
and field goals, and are third
in rebounds. Stanford is fifth in
these three categories.

Stanford, however, leads the
defense and free throws. Both
the Cards and Bruins have 2-0
records and are at the top of the
conference.
Trojans No Pushover
Perhaps the worst mistake the
Tribe could make would be to
skip over USC in preparaing for
the Bruins. USC (7-4) has a
seven foot sophomore in Ron
Taylor, and one of the nation's
top scorers in junior Bill Hewitt,
who is averaging 23.3 points per
game.
USC is second in the confer
ence in scoring, field goals, and
rebounds. Offense has been the
Trojans' strong point, but they
are second to last in conference
defense statistics.
Rounding out the Trojan line
up are sophomore sensation
Steve Jennings with 14.7 ppg,
his partner in the backcourt Har
vey Dillon, and forward Jim

Marsh. Mike Haggard will play
forward for Marsh if Marsh
plays center Taylor's spot.
No Easy Two For Lew
Stanford coach Howie Dall
mar could achieve national
prominence if he has figured out
a. way to stop Alcindor and
UCLA. Dallmar was reluctant
to say how he wanted his team
to play big Lew, but stated that
he did want to prevent Alcindor

from getting easy dunk shots.
But as other teams have found
out, stopping Alcindor may be
just a pleasant death. Duke con
centrated on guarding him and
lost by over 25 points.
The reason for the slaughter
was Alcindor's sophomore team
mates guard Lucius Allen, for
guard Kenny Heitz. The other

starter is junior Mike Warren,
whom Stanford's Art Harris
edged out for all conference
honors last year at guard.
Mission: Impossible
The chances of Stanford talc
ing an upset victory are there
fore very slim. Actually, in
UCLA's Pauley Pavilion, they
are just about zero.
Stanford will, however, pre
sent a team ready for the im
possible to happen. Working off
a three game winning streak
that has boosted their season
record to 7-4, the Indians will
start Gary Petersmeyer and sur
prise-of-the-year Don Griffin at
guard. Both are deadly from the
outside.
The big man at center is of
course Rich Baker, who is hit
ting a fantastic 62 per cent in
field goal attempts. Baker pro
duced a perfect shooting night
against Oregon State last week
end.
Supporting Baker in the fore
court are junior Art Harris (15.2
ppg.) and Howard Hassen (11.6'
PPg).
INDIANS ON THE EYE
The Stanford-UCLA game
will be televised at 8 p.m. Sat
urday night, over KTVU,
Channel 2.
