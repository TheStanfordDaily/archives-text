# CARDS NOW 2-0
## Swimmers Face Huskies, Cougars 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Fresh from last week's har
vest of one NCAA record and
four varsity standards, the Stan
ford swimming team travels to
the slushy northland to face
Washington and Washington
State this weekend.
Neither team should pose a
threat to the power-laden In
dians. Washington will be the
stronger of the two.
Stanford coach Jim Gaughran
has kept the Indians on a heavy
work schedule for the entire
week in anticipation of the great
er challenge of USC and UCLA,
February 17-18.
World record holder Greg
Buckingham, whose 10:09.7 for
the 1000 freestyle tied with
UCLA's Mike Burton's time for
the fastest in the country, will
have another crack at the same
distance. Buckingham's 1:58.9
for the 200 individual medley
was the fastest IM time regis
tered in the nation so far this
season.
Luis Nicolao broke varsity rec
ords in the 200 free (1:45.4) and
200 butterfly (1:58.3), and will
have the chance to break the
same records again this week
end. Nicolao races Buckingham
in th 2 200 fly and Mark Parmely
in the 50 freestyle.
Olympic gold medalist Dick

Roth will tackle the 1000 free
and the 200 IM, and have a shot
at the varsity record for 200
backstroke, 2:03.1.
Bob Momsen will swim his
usual 200 breaststroke and go
on the Indians' loaded medley
relay of Bill Kee (backstroke),
Momsen, Nicolao (fly), and Bill
Meyer (freestyle) against Wash
ington.
Two top Cards will not make
the trip. Butterflier Doug Miller
has a shoulder injury and dis
tance freestyler Mike Wall came
down with near pneumonia.
