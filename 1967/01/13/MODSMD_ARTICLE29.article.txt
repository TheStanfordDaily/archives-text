# "Alfie" vs The Golden Rule
## 
### CURTISS B. KECK Entertainment' Editor 
"Alfie" Is a bit of all right,
mates. Kind of a big giggle to
see that Alfie bloke stalkin' the
birds and makin' 'em in the sack.
But all that bleedin' preachin' at
the end. . . .
In the film that was supposed
to make "Tom Jones" seem like
a Sunday school exercise in
chastity, the gaunt and curly,
blond haired Michael Caine, in
the title role of Alfie, cavorts
from bedroom to bedroom as he
seduces the lasses in his Cock
ney brogue with greater serendi
pity and with less wear and tear
than any bedstand Rabelais ever
has done.
The film opens on the three
dogs in an alley. The foxy ter
rier manages to win the heart
of some sprightly bitch and
coaxes her away from some flee
bitten mongrel hound. We see
the two disappear behind a mini
car—Alfie's car.
Alfie is rassling some married
tart in the front seat, the win
dows are fogged up. A little
moan and then a giggle comes
from the steamy inside of the
car, and then a blast of the horn
shrieks into the calm of the
night. The dogs scram, Alfie
slides out of the car and siddling
up to the camera, lectures on
his philosophy of sex.
Make a married girl laugh and
you'll get her to go home with
you. But make a single bird
laugh and she'll be laughting so
much all night you won't get
anyplace. I can tell you, take
my advice and . . .
Throughout the bulk of the
film, Alfie changes his women
like underwear. As he reels
through assorted tarts, nurses,
beauties, uglies, et al, Alfie ra
tionalizes his philandering in a
passel of sententious asides.
One minute he is making it with
some girl and the next he's in
structing the audience in the
philosophy behind his actions.
But into every carefree, joy
out life a little moralistic peda
goging must rain—and rain it
does, in a torrential monsoon.
Alfie . . . did you find that you
can't take more than you give?
Alfie?
For some mysterious reason,
perhaps he happened upon a
burning brush in Trafalgar
Square, Producer-Director Lewis
Gilbert was determined to create
a movie with a fat moral mes
sage. For seven-eighths of the
film, Gilbert whets the prurient
appetite of the move crowd only,
in the end, to make the audience
choke on the final outcome of
Alfie's leachery. The moral: the
path of leachery is, indeed, a
wretched path paved with waste
. . . loneliness . . . emptiness. Pax
vobiscum.
If ya an't got peace of mind,
ya an't got nothing.
In the end the dog has lost
his dogfriend and Alfie like
wise have lost his friends (al
though not a furry, and except
ing Jane Asher, dogs neverthe
less). Together, man and animal,
they shuffle down misery lane
in search, presumably, of al
truistic bliss.

That "Alfie" casts aspersions
on Alfie's ethical outlook on "sex
for sex's sake" and "women for
sex's sake" and on Alfie's self
declared campaign against any
emotional involvement is neither
good nor bad in itself. What is
bad, however, and painful to
have to sit through, is the Di
rector trying to force his mes
sage down the audience's gullet.
If a film is to have a moral, the
message should unfold as the
film progresses. The audience
should be allowed to discover
the message and then assay it at
its worth.
However, Director Gilbert has
Alfie nonchalantly wander in
and out of sex affairs and re
main apparently the better for
it. It's not until the end, when
Alfie's ivory tower crumbles,
that the audience sees that Gil
bert has unmasked Alfie's life as
sordid and unavoidably hapless.
The message is grafted onto
the end of the film in such a
blatant manner that Alfie's final

revelations of the importance of
good conscience and piece of
mind seem unconvincing.
The problem with "Alfie"
is most damaging to the
film's sincerity is that Alfie never
truly suffers an epiphany. The
scene in which Alfie walks into
his apartment to find the wife
of his friend lying on the couch
and her boody miscarriage of a
perfectly formed fetus on the
kitchen table is just not con
vincing as the point in which
Alfie begins toying with the
golden rule.
On the good side no one could
deny that "Alfie" is loaded with
laughs from beginning to end
(almost the end). Caine keeps
the action on a fast pace with
his continual off-hand remarks
on his sex theories and exploits.
No other actor in currency to
day could have come close to
turning out the seemingly "in
character" and lusty zest that
Mr. Caine injects into his por
trayal of Alfie.
