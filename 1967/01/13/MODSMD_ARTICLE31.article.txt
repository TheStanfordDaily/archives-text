# THE 						UNDERBELLY
## Technology And The Movies 
### ANDREW B. WILSON 
Like any other modern indus
try and no other entertainment
or artistic medium, the movie
industry must learn to deal with
its rapidly progressing techno
logy.
The movie-goer needs only
look in on a few of television's
Late, Late Shows, which run
endless movies of ten to twenty
years ago, to get a fair perspec
tive of the technological ad
vancements which have made
movies what they are today.
In photographic and auditory
quality today's movies seem al
most lush along side their ante
cedents of ten years ago. The
most extravagant of the Cecil B.
DeMille spectaculars, incredible
enough in their day, look flat
and emaciated against the likes
of "Tom Jones," "Thunderball,"
or "Dr. Zhivago."
Virtuosity and Inventiveness
Similarily, movies are being
put together with unprecedent
ed virtuosity and inventiveness.
Transition between scenes, for
instance, can and is being done
with a rapidity and economy
undreamt of ten years ago.
"The Knack" is a good example.
If movies are to be motion pic
tures, it is undeniable that in
terms of sheer motion the
movies of ten years ago appear
static beside those of today.
But what has caused the tech
nological advancement in mov
ies and where will it lead them?
Equipment has, of course,
been improved. Better cameras,
editing facilities and the like,
have enabled many refinements
in the technical make-up of
movies.
Think Visually
But there is a more funda
mental reason in the visual so
phistication of today's movie
makers. Where the generation
before him pioneered, the young
director enters with a long fami
liarity. He has been raised on a
steady diet of film and televi
sion, and so is thoroughly condi
tioned to the visual nature and
possibilities of his field. If noth
ing else, television has taught
people, from their earliest years,
to think in terms of visual im
ages.
Today it might seem self-evi
dent that movies are essentially
visual, just as plays are essen
tially verbal, but this was by
no means always so apparent.
In their early years the movies
had, perforce, to borrow heavily
from other media. Though there
are notable exceptions, most of
these movies amply reflected
the fact that they were written
by roughly transplanted novel
ists, playwrights or adventure
story writers, and acted by
carry-overs from the stage or
vaudeville. While many of the
old films are quite good, they
i

labored, especially with the ad
vent of sound, under the limita
tions of their parasitic form.
Camera and direction followed
the dictates of the novel-like
plots and stage-like acting.
It would be nice to conclude
that the technical brilliance and
visual acuity of so many of to
day's films have at least enabled
movies to take their place along
side other art forms. This would
be nice, but, it seems to me, the
lack of substance and intrinsic
importance in the top level con
temporary films rules out such
a nice conclusion. The popular
films of late such as "Alfie" and
"Thousand Clowns," seem torn
between something old and
something new: they are trying
to give the dog-eared, dead
tired lessons in racey new ways.
Also, there has been much
complaint over the "lack of

meaning," or "unintelligibility,"
of the avant garde movies. Per
haps, however, the key to under
standing the problems and cur
rents in contemporary film is
the realization that many are
trying to burst the old bound
aries. There is no particular
reason, for instance, why movies
must try to penetrate character
and dramatize conflict like nov
els and plays. In this regard,
Antonioni has talked about try
ing to make movies akin to
poetry. The loosely defined
movement called the New Wave
becomes much more intelligible
when one realizes the import
ance it was trying to lend to the
purely visual quality of film.
In conclusion, the technologi
cal advancements of contempor
ary movies have created, among
other things, new problems and
new demands.

story writers, and acted by
carry-overs from the stage or
vaudeville. While many of the
old films are quite good, they
i

labored, especially with the ad
vent of sound, under the limita
tions of their parasitic form.
Camera and direction followed
the dictates of the novel-like
plots and stage-like acting.
It would be nice to conclude
that the technical brilliance and
visual acuity of so many of to
day's films have at least enabled
movies to take their place along
side other art forms. This would
be nice, but, it seems to me, the
lack of substance and intrinsic
importance in the top level con
temporary films rules out such
a nice conclusion. The popular
films of late such as "Alfie" and
"Thousand Clowns," seem torn
between something old and
something new: they are trying
to give the dog-eared, dead
tired lessons in racey new ways.
Also, there has been much
complaint over the "lack of

meaning," or "unintelligibility,"
of the avant garde movies. Per
haps, however, the key to under
standing the problems and cur
rents in contemporary film is
the realization that many are
trying to burst the old bound
aries. There is no particular
reason, for instance, why movies
must try to penetrate character
and dramatize conflict like nov
els and plays. In this regard,
Antonioni has talked about try
ing to make movies akin to
poetry. The loosely defined
movement called the New Wave
becomes much more intelligible
when one realizes the import
ance it was trying to lend to the
purely visual quality of film.
In conclusion, the technologi
cal advancements of contempor
ary movies have created, among
other things, new problems and
new demands.
Like any other modern indus
try and no other entertainment
or artistic medium, the movie
industry must learn to deal with
its rapidly progressing techno
logy.
The movie-goer needs only
look in on a few of television's
Late, Late Shows, which run
endless movies of ten to twenty
years ago, to get a fair perspec
tive of the technological ad
vancements which have made
movies what they are today.
In photographic and auditory
quality today's movies seem al
most lush along side their ante
cedents of ten years ago. The
most extravagant of the Cecil B.
DeMille spectaculars, incredible
enough in their day, look flat
and emaciated against the likes
of "Tom Jones," "Thunderball,"
or "Dr. Zhivago."
Virtuosity and Inventiveness
Similarily, movies are being
put together with unprecedent
ed virtuosity and inventiveness.
Transition between scenes, for
instance, can and is being done
with a rapidity and economy
undreamt of ten years ago.
"The Knack" is a good example.
If movies are to be motion pic
tures, it is undeniable that in
terms of sheer motion the
movies of ten years ago appear
static beside those of today.
But what has caused the tech
nological advancement in mov
ies and where will it lead them?
Equipment has, of course,
been improved. Better cameras,
editing facilities and the like,
have enabled many refinements
in the technical make-up of
movies.
Think Visually
But there is a more funda
mental reason in the visual so
phistication of today's movie
makers. Where the generation
before him pioneered, the young
director enters with a long fami
liarity. He has been raised on a
steady diet of film and televi
sion, and so is thoroughly condi
tioned to the visual nature and
possibilities of his field. If noth
ing else, television has taught
people, from their earliest years,
to think in terms of visual im
ages.
Today it might seem self-evi
dent that movies are essentially
visual, just as plays are essen
tially verbal, but this was by
no means always so apparent.
In their early years the movies
had, perforce, to borrow heavily
from other media. Though there
are notable exceptions, most of
these movies amply reflected
the fact that they were written
by roughly transplanted novel
ists, playwrights or adventure
story writers, and acted by
carry-overs from the stage or
vaudeville. While many of the

or "Dr. Zhivago."
Virtuosity and Inventiveness
Similarily, movies are being
put together with unprecedent
ed virtuosity and inventiveness.
Transition between scenes, for
instance, can and is being done
with a rapidity and economy
undreamt of ten years ago.
"The Knack" is a good example.
If movies are to be motion pic
tures, it is undeniable that in
terms of sheer motion the
movies of ten years ago appear
static beside those of today.
But what has caused the tech
nological advancement in mov
ies and where will it lead them?
Equipment has, of course,
been improved. Better cameras,
editing facilities and the like,
have enabled many refinements
in the technical make-up of
movies.
Think Visually
But there is a more funda
mental reason in the visual so
phistication of today's movie
makers. Where the generation
before him pioneered, the young
director enters with a long fami
liarity. He has been raised on a
steady diet of film and televi
sion, and so is thoroughly condi
tioned to the visual nature and
possibilities of his field. If noth
ing else, television has taught
people, from their earliest years,
to think in terms of visual im
ages.
Today it might seem self-evi
dent that movies are essentially
visual, just as plays are essen
tially verbal, but this was by
no means always so apparent.
In their early years the movies
had, perforce, to borrow heavily
from other media. Though there
are notable exceptions, most of
these movies amply reflected
the fact that they were written
by roughly transplanted novel
ists, playwrights or adventure
story writers, and acted by
carry-overs from the stage or
vaudeville. While many of the
old films are quite good, they
i

labored, especially with the ad
vent of sound, under the limita
tions of their parasitic form.
Camera and direction followed
the dictates of the novel-like
plots and stage-like acting.
It would be nice to conclude
that the technical brilliance and
visual acuity of so many of to
day's films have at least enabled
movies to take their place along
side other art forms. This would
be nice, but, it seems to me, the
lack of substance and intrinsic
importance in the top level con
temporary films rules out such
a nice conclusion. The popular
films of late such as "Alfie" and
"Thousand Clowns," seem torn
between something old and
something new: they are trying
to give the dog-eared, dead
tired lessons in racey new ways.
Also, there has been much
complaint over the "lack of

meaning," or "unintelligibility,"
of the avant garde movies. Per
haps, however, the key to under
standing the problems and cur
rents in contemporary film is
the realization that many are
trying to burst the old bound
aries. There is no particular
reason, for instance, why movies
must try to penetrate character
and dramatize conflict like nov
els and plays. In this regard,
Antonioni has talked about try
ing to make movies akin to
poetry. The loosely defined
movement called the New Wave
becomes much more intelligible
when one realizes the import
ance it was trying to lend to the
purely visual quality of film.
In conclusion, the technologi
cal advancements of contempor
ary movies have created, among
other things, new problems and
new demands.
