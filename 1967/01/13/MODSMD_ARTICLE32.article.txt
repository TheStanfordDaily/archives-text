### CURTISS B. KECK Entertainment Editor 
THEATER
The Stanford Repertory Theatre's upcoming production of John
Gay's THE BEGGAR'S OPERA is the next major spectacular to
reach the boards at Memorial Auditorium. "Beggar's Opera" opens
for a 15 performance run this Wednesday and will play through
February 4. Tickets are available at Mem Aud box office.
Young love is the theme of DAME NATURE, which opens tonight
at Hillbarn Theatre, Belmont, for a run of Fridays and Saturdays
at 8:30 p.m. Patricia Collinge translated from the French of Andre
Birabeau the rueful comedy which originally starred Montgomery
Clift, Jessie Royce Landis, and Onslow Stevens on Broadway.
Continuing at the Playhouse Theatre in S.F. is Friedrich Dur
renmatt's THE PHYSICISTS, a tragicomic attack on atomic war
fare. The production will be given its second weekend of perform
ances tonight and tomorrow evening, at 8:30 p.m.
FILMS
For sheer exhaustion you can't beat the double feature at the
Fine Arts. The first show, GAMBIT, has Michel Caine and Shirley
McLaine as honorable guests of a very rich Arabian prince. In the
best blimey tradition they return his extravagant hospitality by tak
ing off, unannounced, with his most prized piece of sculpture. All
in all it's a pretty good movie, though, especially by contrast to
ARABESQUE which follows. This flick has Sophia Loren and some
fantastic photography (the two are not necessarily synonymous),
but then, Give Us Strength To Endure, there's Greogory Peck who
is a bad actor under the best of circumstances, and in this, a comedy
of sorts, he is about as funny as Alfie's stillborn son. Which brings
us to that dose of prurient putescence which cops out on the Good
Life in the end, —"Alfie." (See review on this page.)
For those of you who haven't gotten around to seeting the movies
which everybody else saw last year or before, you can join the dul
lards who like to see their favorite flicks five or six or Gods knows
how many times. They'll be at the Altos, watching A THOUSAND
CLOWNS, and at the Guild, writhing to GUNS OF AUGUST, a
movie which, should there be any doubt, has nothing to do with
the August Revolution which now seems to rate commemoral cele
bration in Watts. If you haven't seen THE WRONG BOX, don't.
It's terrible. Granted, stars Peter Sellers, and there's some magic in
that. Just about enough to lure the unwary into purchasing a ticket
before finding out that our star is only on for five measely minutes.
OTHER
This afternoon at four o'clock the campus ought to be jumping
again, like it did during last year's Stanford Jazz Year, with
JUNIOR WELLS BLUES BAND at the Tresidder Union Lounge.
Tickets $1.25.

is a bad actor under the best of circumstances, and in this, a comedy
of sorts, he is about as funny as Alfie's stillborn son. Which brings
us to that dose of prurient putescence which cops out on the Good
Life in the end, —"Alfie." (See review on this page.)
For those of you who haven't gotten around to seeting the movies
which everybody else saw last year or before, you can join the dul
lards who like to see their favorite flicks five or six or Gods knows
how many times. They'll be at the Altos, watching A THOUSAND
CLOWNS, and at the Guild, writhing to GUNS OF AUGUST, a
movie which, should there be any doubt, has nothing to do with
the August Revolution which now seems to rate commemoral cele
bration in Watts. If you haven't seen THE WRONG BOX, don't.
It's terrible. Granted, stars Peter Sellers, and there's some magic in
that. Just about enough to lure the unwary into purchasing a ticket
before finding out that our star is only on for five measely minutes.

This afternoon at four o'clock the campus ought to be jumping

THEATER
The Stanford Repertory Theatre's upcoming production of John
Gay's THE BEGGAR'S OPERA is the next major spectacular to
reach the boards at Memorial Auditorium. "Beggar's Opera" opens
for a 15 performance run this Wednesday and will play through
February 4. Tickets are available at Mem Aud box office.
Young love is the theme of DAME NATURE, which opens tonight
at Hillbarn Theatre, Belmont, for a run of Fridays and Saturdays
at 8:30 p.m. Patricia Collinge translated from the French of Andre
Birabeau the rueful comedy which originally starred Montgomery
Clift, Jessie Royce Landis, and Onslow Stevens on Broadway.
Continuing at the Playhouse Theatre in S.F. is Friedrich Dur
renmatt's THE PHYSICISTS, a tragicomic attack on atomic war
fare. The production will be given its second weekend of perform
ances tonight and tomorrow evening, at 8:30 p.m.
FILMS
For sheer exhaustion you can't beat the double feature at the
Fine Arts. The first show, GAMBIT, has Michel Caine and Shirley
McLaine as honorable guests of a very rich Arabian prince. In the
best blimey tradition they return his extravagant hospitality by tak
ing off, unannounced, with his most prized piece of sculpture. All
in all it's a pretty good movie, though, especially by contrast to
ARABESQUE which follows. This flick has Sophia Loren and some
fantastic photography (the two are not necessarily synonymous),
but then, Give Us Strength To Endure, there's Greogory Peck who
is a bad actor under the best of circumstances, and in this, a comedy
of sorts, he is about as funny as Alfie's stillborn son. Which brings
us to that dose of prurient putescence which cops out on the Good
Life in the end, —"Alfie." (See review on this page.)
