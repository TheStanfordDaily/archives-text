For nearly ten per cent of the student body,
the "overseas experience" begins on Quad. Stan
ford's twelve hundred foreign students find
much of the excitement and many of the
same problems studying in an American uni
versity that their counterparts meet at the over
seas campuses.
The Bechtel International Center, which is
being formally dedicated today, offers Stanford's
large international community a well-planned
introduction to Stanford and the United States.
The Center, recently remodeled with the as
sistance of Stephen Bechtel and others, pro
vides a comfortable and informal gathering
place for foreign students and those with inter
national interests. The Center's "Evening
Abroad" series has been of campus-wide appeal,
bringing a taste of the world's various cultures
alive for an evening.

In the day of the jet, the once distant con
tinents are only hours away. But the gaps in
understanding and culture are another ques
tion. Student's returning from overseas cam
puses often marvel at European nations' con
cern with language and culture beyond their
own borders. While American universities
through exchange programs and foreign cam
puses have placed the student in foreign cul
tures, America, because of its size and perhaps
sense of superiority, has never managed to
create a comparable cross-current of culture and
language at home. In part the International
Center is an answer to this problem.
We hope that the International Center will
continue to respond to the needs of foreign stu
dents, while broadening the perspective of the
entire campus through its activities.
