## Who Picks Up The Check For Berkeley? 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
Quoted student reaction to the
possibility of a tuition at UC
was filled with accusation and
statements of panic and hys
teria—but lacking any attempt
to clarify the issues.
The only way in which tuition
can be charged at UC is by order
of the Board of Regents, not by
the Governor alone, nor by the
Legislature.
At the moment upwards of
half a million students in Cali
fornia are receiving "free" edu
cation. Is it not asking too much
to ask them to defray some of
the costs themselves? After all,
they receive the benefit of this
education and presumably
would profit by it in later life.
Along with this proposal came
a plan for deferred tuition that
is payable in the years follow
ing graduation.
It should be emphasized that
this education is by no means
free. Do the students who pro
test the possible tuition actually
believe that the people of Cali
fornia owe them a college edu
cation? Is this their right by
birth?
It is clear that parents with
children at UC receive a net re
distribution of wealth. But con
sider those who pay: retired
people with no children in
school, the unmarried and
young couples with no children
in school, and people whose chil
dren attend private institutions
or school out of state. Many of
these people pay twice for edu
cation . . . their own children,
and other people's children.
There is one other important
group that pays—the step child
of the New Left . . . Watts,
Hunter.s Point, and other low
income areas. Is it clear how
much these people benefit from
the hillside campus at Berke
ley? More evidence is required,
but one thing is certain ... the
issues are more complex than
the general student reaction ex
hibited In Thursday's Dally.

Editor, The Daily:
Ronald Reagan campaigned suc
cessfully in California asserting
that the individual should play
a larger role in solving society's

problems and that the role of
the government should be mini
mized.
There is now an issue which
will allow Mr. Reagan to prove
his sincerity and at the same
time test the true motives of his
followers. The federal govern
ment has cut approximately one
hundred million dollars from its
appropriation for future Cali
fornia highways. Surely this
money can be raised by taking
up a collection among his
friends in Los Angeles. I am
also sure that Mr. Reagan's sup
porters here at Stanford would
be willing to chip in.
In case he falls short, Mr.
Reagan could always stage a
benefit. RAND McQUINN

Editor, The Daily:
I was seriously miquoted In
yesterday's Daily. The two re
porters responsible for the ar
ticles on Reagan and on LASSU
made no effort to faithfully rep
resent what was said in their
interviews with me. On Reagan
I had said that he was "a perfect
example of a petit bourgeois
who had achieved rapid social
mobility and now hoped to pull
up the ladder in order to main
tain his new position." This was
so truncated by your reporter
that no sense can be made of the
quotation in The Daily. I also
pointed out that Reagan was
protecting property owners
while sacrificing new forms of
technical development which
were expanding California's eco
nomy. Such industries as elec
tronics depend on the presence
of a continuing flow of univer
sity educated man power.
In your article on the LASSU
meeting your reporter complete
ly altered the sense of what I
said about the student role with
in the University. I stated that

"students have skills and re
sources which can be used in
the determination of educational
policies but that they were not
allowed directly to contribute
their knowledge.
Neither article reported the
facts, or what I said. Until ac
curate reporting is guaranteed
you can talk to someone else.

Quoted student reaction to the
possibility of a tuition at UC
was filled with accusation and
statements of panic and hys
teria—but lacking any attempt
to clarify the issues.
The only way in which tuition
can be charged at UC is by order
of the Board of Regents, not by
the Governor alone, nor by the
Legislature.
At the moment upwards of
half a million students in Cali
fornia are receiving "free" edu
cation. Is it not asking too much
to ask them to defray some of
the costs themselves? After all,
they receive the benefit of this
education and presumably
would profit by it in later life.
Along with this proposal came
a plan for deferred tuition that
is payable in the years follow
ing graduation.
It should be emphasized that
this education is by no means
free. Do the students who pro
test the possible tuition actually
believe that the people of Cali
fornia owe them a college edu
cation? Is this their right by
birth?
It is clear that parents with
children at UC receive a net re
distribution of wealth. But con
sider those who pay: retired
people with no children in
school, the unmarried and
young couples with no children
in school, and people whose chil
dren attend private institutions
or school out of state. Many of
these people pay twice for edu
cation . . . their own children,
and other people's children.
There is one other important
group that pays—the step child
of the New Left . . . Watts,
Hunter.s Point, and other low
income areas. Is it clear how
much these people benefit from
the hillside campus at Berke

Ronald Reagan campaigned suc
cessfully in California asserting
that the individual should play
a larger role in solving society's

problems and that the role of
the government should be mini
mized.
There is now an issue which
will allow Mr. Reagan to prove
his sincerity and at the same
time test the true motives of his
followers. The federal govern
ment has cut approximately one
hundred million dollars from its
appropriation for future Cali
fornia highways. Surely this
money can be raised by taking
up a collection among his
friends in Los Angeles. I am

pointed out that Reagan was
protecting property owners
while sacrificing new forms of
technical development which
were expanding California's eco
nomy. Such industries as elec
tronics depend on the presence
of a continuing flow of univer
sity educated man power.
In your article on the LASSU
meeting your reporter complete
ly altered the sense of what I
said about the student role with
in the University. I stated that

"students have skills and re
sources which can be used in
the determination of educational
policies but that they were not
allowed directly to contribute
their knowledge.
Neither article reported the
facts, or what I said. Until ac
curate reporting is guaranteed
you can talk to someone else.
