## Ronnie's First Week-Or, Show Biz Hits Politics

"Lights! Camera! Action!"
Here comes Ronald Reagan,
starring in his new picture,
"The Triumph of the Will."
Within a week of his inaugu
ration our newest Public Figure
has started the labors of Her
cules. With his bare hands, he
is tearing chunks of long green
from the state budget! With his
muscles bulging, he heaves in
his attempts to raise the tuition
of the University of California!
What a man!
He's graceful, too. With the
greatest of ease, he twists in
mid-air, performing the most
unbelievable acrobatics. He sud
denly sends his finance director
to tell the Regents he's cutting
their budget. He has given them
no notice, and the changes he
proposes are drastic. But with
effortless grace, he calls the sur
prises and insulted shock of the
Regents the crying of "Chicken
Littles." After all, he hasn't
made a final proposal.
On the stereotypic TV screen
in our heads, we see the Man
from Boraxo wading into Sproul
Hall, scattering sheaves of tui
tion bills among the demonstra
tors. The prone students look
at the bills, gasp, and bloodless
ly die.
We see Our Hero surrounded
by thousands of professors with
thousands of different opinions.
Deafened by the cacophony, he
cuts their funds, limits their
numbers, and leads them in the
pledge of alliegenee.
We see a colossus from a Jap
anese movie striding down Tele
graph Avenue. He wears a white
hat and a star saying "Prince
of Peace." He guts the Mediter
anneum, Shakespeare and Co.,
Cody's and The Cinema-Studio
and installs a Jack-in-the-Box, a
Stickney's and a Cabana Hotel.
By now, some of the Marlboro
smoking, Ford-driving, cowboy
boot-wearing readers may feel
that this charicature has gone
a bit far, but in truth what
other image of Mr. Reagan's
feeling for the University do we
have?
He has said that campus dem
onstrators should "abide by (the
rules) or get their education
elsewhere." He has challenged

academic freedom by advising
to "build character on accepted
moral and ethical standards."
He has come out for the stu
dent bearing a part of the cost
of education, seeming to ignore
that the student now must pay
for fees, room and board, and
books while going to school.
If Ronald Reagan were inter
ested in the future of the State
and the university he would at
least have detailed specific pro
posals as to where the budget
is to be cut. He would clearly
state his position on the univer
sity's gifts to social mobility,
government and industry. He
would show us some evidence
he has read more of the univer
sity's proposed budget than the
total.
He has failed on all these
counts. Having so failed we can
only assume that this action is
the kickoff of a series of plays
to the bourgeois, vote-yes-on-no
grandstand that elected him. As
this is being written reports of
new grand sweeps in hiring and
welfare are coming in. He sees
that what virile, Western, mod
ern California likes is action,
whether on the late show or in
the news.
He is a dynamic figure, push
ing forth. He is facing difficult
and complex problems with the
simple solution of dramatic flair.
Humble - bumble Pat Brown
would never have been so color
ful. Ronald Reagan is making
news, not only in California but
across the land.
He must be stopped. This emo
tional action soothes the fears
of the voters, but it does not
solve the problems that cause
those fears. After Ronald Rea
gan is elected President, some
poor governor will have to pick
up our pieces. Right now people
are saying Chicken Little was
right, but Ronald Reagan does
not turn the firmament.
If we are to prevent the harm
that his obvious disregard for
unflattering reality makes him
capable of doing we must let
Ronald Reagan know that in
spite of his avowal to emulate
the Prince of Peace, Ronald
Reagan is not God.
