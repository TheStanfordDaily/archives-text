# LASSU Takes First Step On C15 Open House Regs
## 
### SUZETTE LEITH 
Legislature voted last night its in
tent to pass the Committee of Fifteen's
proposed Open House hours els soon
as legally possible.
Because a change in open house
rules would be a by laws change, it
must be presented in LASSU twice.
The rules were accepted last night
for a first reading. Accompanying
this action was a resolution expres
sing the intention to complete the
process next week.
Committee Government
Concerning the OFF issue, Speaker
Tom Forstenzer reported that the
matter was under consideration by
the Committee of Fifteen and would
be discussed in its meeting next Mon
day.
In other action, LASSU voted to
appoint a committee of six to study
proposals for a "sharing of respon
sibility" in rule and policy making

among the ASSU, the faculty, and the
administration.
Also, $350 was appropriated for
ASSU pages in the 1967 Quad, and a
bill to appropriate $233.11 to the Daily
to send representatives to the U.S.
Student Press Association Editor's
Conference was referred to the fi
nance committee.
Rules suggested by the Committee
of Fifteen permit open house in the
non-lobby area of student residences
four days a week between noon and
midnight. They provide for a restric
tion of these hours by a majority
vote of all members of the living
group or for an extension by a secret
ballot of three-quarters of the group.
Open house would be prohibited be
tween 2:30 a.m. and 10 a.m., and first
quarter freshmen would not be per
mitted to extend the hours beyond
the basic four days a week, noon to
midnight.

The Board of Trustees, the only
group left to consider the hours
change, will meet next Thursday.
Appointments Soon
The members of the community-gov
ernment study commission will be ap
pointed within the next few days after
consultation with the rules commit
tee, according to the Speaker.
Types of community government
are presently in effect in various col
leges such as Reed and are presently
being considered by the University of
California at Berkeley.
The Quad appropriation will pay
for pages for all groups, such as Po
litical Union and the 1.1. R., which re
ceive their sole support from the AS
SU. Usually a proportion of the funds
allotted to each group is budgeted for
the Quad; the current appropriation
is designed to budget all space at
once.

The rules were accepted last night
for a first reading. Accompanying
this action was a resolution expres
sing the intention to complete the
process next week.
Committee Government
Concerning the OFF issue, Speaker
Tom Forstenzer reported that the
matter was under consideration by
the Committee of Fifteen and would
be discussed in its meeting next Mon
day.
In other action, LASSU voted to
appoint a committee of six to study
proposals for a "sharing of respon
sibility" in rule and policy making

among the ASSU, the faculty, and the
administration.
Also, $350 was appropriated for
ASSU pages in the 1967 Quad, and a
bill to appropriate $233.11 to the Daily
to send representatives to the U.S.
Student Press Association Editor's
Conference was referred to the fi
nance committee.
Rules suggested by the Committee
of Fifteen permit open house in the
non-lobby area of student residences
four days a week between noon and
midnight. They provide for a restric
tion of these hours by a majority
vote of all members of the living
group or for an extension by a secret
ballot of three-quarters of the group.
Open house would be prohibited be
tween 2:30 a.m. and 10 a.m., and first
quarter freshmen would not be per
mitted to extend the hours beyond
the basic four days a week, noon to
midnight.

The Board of Trustees, the only
group left to consider the hours
change, will meet next Thursday.
Appointments Soon
The members of the community-gov
ernment study commission will be ap
pointed within the next few days after
consultation with the rules commit
tee, according to the Speaker.
Types of community government
are presently in effect in various col
leges such as Reed and are presently
being considered by the University of
California at Berkeley.
The Quad appropriation will pay
for pages for all groups, such as Po
litical Union and the 1.1. R., which re
ceive their sole support from the AS
SU. Usually a proportion of the funds
allotted to each group is budgeted for
the Quad; the current appropriation
is designed to budget all space at
once.
Legislature voted last night its in
tent to pass the Committee of Fifteen's
proposed Open House hours els soon
as legally possible.
Because a change in open house
rules would be a by laws change, it
must be presented in LASSU twice.
