# Fort: 'Drop In To Social Reform'
## 
### GAIL ANDERSON 
"Leary and Alpert as Pied Pipers,
playing seductive music and being

headed off at the wrong pass by sev
eral sheriffs using atomic bombs,"
stated Dr. Joel Fort of the Center for
the Study of Special Problems last
night, "is a metaphor which may
describe the present LSD scene."
Speaking on "Psychedelics in Ameri
can Society" as the first in a series
on psychedelic drugs, Dr. Fort ex
plained the role of mind-altering drugs
in our basically drug-oriented society.
"We are constantly bombarded with
advertising which would condition us
to believe that all our problems can
be solved with some kind of drug."
Emphasizing that abuse of a drug
concerns its effects rather than dos
age, he defined drug abuse as "the use
of a drug to the point that it inter
fers with social or vocational ad
justment or health."
Individual Reactions
Turning from drugs in general to
LSD in particular, he emphasized that
the effects of the drug depend not
only on the actual pharmacology of
the drug but mostly on individual per
sonality characteristics and the social
setting and expectations within which
the drug is taken. He also noted the
importance of proper preparation, at
titude, and individual maturity and
experience as well as the aid of an
experienced person. "Bad trips," he
stated, "are the result of a lack of
one of these factors."
He noted also that problems of
mental breakdown under LSD are
caused by underlying psychotic and

schizoid tendencies brought out by the
drug.
He mentioned medical research proj
ects carried on with LSD for curing
mental and psychological problems
and said that an unfortunate effect of
sensational and misinformed public
ity had been to curtail such research.
Sensory Perceptions
From general knowledge and per
sonal experience, Dr. Fort described
the usual psychedelic experience as
one of intensification of visual
imagery, increased enjoyment of ordi
nary pleasures, sensation of colors
and forms, and changes in thought
and perspective. He stated that the in
dividual reaction depended on the in
dividual and that no drug could make
an ignorant, noncreative person into

a creative genius.
In a general social context, Dr.
Fort stated that LSD has become a
common scapegoat for those who
"can't outlaw youth" but want to hin
der anti-establishment thinking and
behavior. The furor over LSD, he
noted, has obscured the real social
issues which lead to individual prob
lems. He deplored the superficial solu
tion of legal action which is ineffective
and gives a false sense of security.
"The proper function of our so
ciety," he said, "is to treat drug prob
lems as medical, social, and individual
and leave to the law the treatment of
only anti-social behavior. If an indivi
dual commits burglary while under
the influence of LSD, we already have
laws to deal with him. If he commits
no anti-social act, the law has no
business with him. It is simply a
waste of manpower and time to at
tempt to prosecute people for using
the drug." He added that such action
was more likely to accentuate any
problems with drug usage that might
exist rather than curing them.
"Drop into Social Reform"
In concluding, Fort urged people to
deal directly with the problems of
American society rather than attempt
ing to outlaw them or simplistically
blaming them on drug usage.
"Rather than Leary's philosophy of
'Turn on, tune in, and drop out,' " he
said, "I would urge you to turn on
and tune in to the ills of our society
and drop in to social reform and self
actualization."

ing to outlaw them or simplistically
blaming them on drug usage.
"Rather than Leary's philosophy of
'Turn on, tune in, and drop out,' " he
said, "I would urge you to turn on
and tune in to the ills of our society
and drop in to social reform and self
actualization."
"Leary and Alpert as Pied Pipers,
playing seductive music and being

headed off at the wrong pass by sev
eral sheriffs using atomic bombs,"
stated Dr. Joel Fort of the Center for
the Study of Special Problems last
night, "is a metaphor which may
describe the present LSD scene."
Speaking on "Psychedelics in Ameri
can Society" as the first in a series
on psychedelic drugs, Dr. Fort ex
plained the role of mind-altering drugs
in our basically drug-oriented society.
"We are constantly bombarded with
advertising which would condition us
to believe that all our problems can
be solved with some kind of drug."
Emphasizing that abuse of a drug
concerns its effects rather than dos
age, he defined drug abuse as "the use
of a drug to the point that it inter
fers with social or vocational ad
justment or health."
Individual Reactions
Turning from drugs in general to
LSD in particular, he emphasized that
the effects of the drug depend not
only on the actual pharmacology of
the drug but mostly on individual per
sonality characteristics and the social
setting and expectations within which
the drug is taken. He also noted the
importance of proper preparation, at
titude, and individual maturity and
experience as well as the aid of an
experienced person. "Bad trips," he
stated, "are the result of a lack of
one of these factors."
He noted also that problems of
mental breakdown under LSD are
caused by underlying psychotic and

schizoid tendencies brought out by the
drug.
He mentioned medical research proj
ects carried on with LSD for curing
mental and psychological problems
and said that an unfortunate effect of
sensational and misinformed public
ity had been to curtail such research.
Sensory Perceptions
From general knowledge and per
sonal experience, Dr. Fort described
the usual psychedelic experience as
one of intensification of visual
imagery, increased enjoyment of ordi
nary pleasures, sensation of colors
and forms, and changes in thought
and perspective. He stated that the in
dividual reaction depended on the in
dividual and that no drug could make
an ignorant, noncreative person into

a creative genius.
In a general social context, Dr.
Fort stated that LSD has become a
common scapegoat for those who
"can't outlaw youth" but want to hin
der anti-establishment thinking and
behavior. The furor over LSD, he
noted, has obscured the real social
issues which lead to individual prob
lems. He deplored the superficial solu
tion of legal action which is ineffective
and gives a false sense of security.
"The proper function of our so
ciety," he said, "is to treat drug prob
lems as medical, social, and individual
and leave to the law the treatment of
only anti-social behavior. If an indivi
dual commits burglary while under
the influence of LSD, we already have
laws to deal with him. If he commits
no anti-social act, the law has no
business with him. It is simply a
waste of manpower and time to at
tempt to prosecute people for using
the drug." He added that such action
was more likely to accentuate any
problems with drug usage that might
exist rather than curing them.
"Drop into Social Reform"
In concluding, Fort urged people to
deal directly with the problems of
American society rather than attempt
ing to outlaw them or simplistically
blaming them on drug usage.
