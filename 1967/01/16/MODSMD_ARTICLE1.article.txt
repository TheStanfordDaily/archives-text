# Human Be-In: A San Francisco Swing-out
## 
### STEVE RUTKUS 
Scents of incense, broken sounds of
dissonant folk-rock, and the charis
matic exhortations of psychedelic
prophets emanated from the Polo
Grounds in San Francisco's Golden
Gate Park Saturday afternoon.
The long awaited "Gathering of the
Tribes" was "happening," and most of
the 15,000 onlookers, whose general
lack of inhibition showed itself in
gaudy dress and exhuberantly famil
iar behavior, seemed delighted.
Most of the partisans seemed happy

to call themselves part of the "love
generation," the incipient "hippie"
movement that traces its source to the
ferment of the nearby Haight-Ash
bury district.
Left-wing political activists, who
earlier in the week expressed sym
pathies for the "Be-In", seemed num
erous.
Although a North Vietnamese flag
in the crowd could not be detected,
followers of Dr. Timothy Leary in
stead brandished a flag which called
for the legalizing of marijuana.

An indignant fundamentalist,
equipped with a megaphone, hearty
voice and a strong will, who urged
the audience to "give yourselves to
Christ," was met with only mild ridi
cule and indifference; the onlookers
became more restive, however, when
the sound system was paralyzed for
almost a haif hour due to a cut wire.
Hell's Angels
A Hell's Angels delegation stepped
in and volunteered to protect the
sound system; when told of this act
of generosity, the crowd roared ap
preciatively.
The apparent absence of policemen
was striking. The event was without
serious incident, although one woman
visitor, in a transparent blouse, prob
ably would have been arrested under
more usual circumstances.
Leary spoke briefly, urging his
listeners to "turn on, tune in and drop
out." He went on to translate the
esoteric, three-point cure-all in the fol
lowing: "Find meaning within one
self, harness it up in acts of beauty
and glory and drop out of high school,
grad school, junior executive and
senior executive."

To "drop out" is the "hard way,"
Leary asserted. He labeled "addictive
behavior" as "conforming to society."
Since Leary is the strong advocate
of using marijuana, LSD and peyote
for "inner discovery," his use of "ad
dictive" was obviously not in the nar
cotic sense.
Lenore Kandel, author of the con
troversial "Love Book," read her
poem "Invocation for Maitreya," and
its blunt imagery evoked positive
response from her listeners.
The "non-political" event assumed
a new dimension when Jerry Rubin,
one of the six non-students arrested
November 30 last year during the
prestrike at UC Berkeley, addressed
the audience and requested donations
so that he, Mario Savio and four
others could be bailed out of jail.
Hemmed-in among hundreds
around the stage, this writer never
would have intrcepted Ginsberg, if a
long-haired participant had not yelled
"Allen," as he stepped down into
the mass of people.
I followed this person closely

through the crowd, and finally came
upon Ginsberg, who looked as if he
had just left the Roman forum,
though in dirty laundry.
Mela
Ginsberg briefly likened the event
to the Indian "mela," a religious festi
val. A long haired admirer ap
proached the poet and said, "Mr. Gins
berg, I want you to be President of
the United States." Ginsberg re
sponded "not for the
present."
It was difficult attaining a con
sensus as to visitors' motives for at
tending. A bare-chested man called
the event "groovy". "This is where
it is happening . . . right now," he
said. A woman in her late twenties,
who commented that she attended a
Hell's Angels function only two
weeks before, called the Polo Grounds
event "fun."
An 11-year-old boy, whose father
is a poet and friend of Ginsberg,
offered perhaps the most articulate
explanation: speaking of the folk
rock music, "I like the bands; besides,
nobody gets hurt."

Mela
Ginsberg briefly likened the event
to the Indian "mela," a religious festi
val. A long haired admirer ap
proached the poet and said, "Mr. Gins
berg, I want you to be President of
the United States." Ginsberg re
sponded "not for the
present."
It was difficult attaining a con
sensus as to visitors' motives for at
tending. A bare-chested man called
the event "groovy". "This is where
it is happening . . . right now," he
said. A woman in her late twenties,
who commented that she attended a
Hell's Angels function only two
weeks before, called the Polo Grounds
event "fun."
An 11-year-old boy, whose father
is a poet and friend of Ginsberg,
offered perhaps the most articulate
explanation: speaking of the folk
rock music, "I like the bands; besides,
nobody gets hurt."

Scents of incense, broken sounds of
dissonant folk-rock, and the charis
matic exhortations of psychedelic
prophets emanated from the Polo
Grounds in San Francisco's Golden
Gate Park Saturday afternoon.
The long awaited "Gathering of the
Tribes" was "happening," and most of
the 15,000 onlookers, whose general
lack of inhibition showed itself in
gaudy dress and exhuberantly famil
iar behavior, seemed delighted.
Most of the partisans seemed happy

to call themselves part of the "love
generation," the incipient "hippie"
movement that traces its source to the
ferment of the nearby Haight-Ash
bury district.
Left-wing political activists, who
earlier in the week expressed sym
pathies for the "Be-In", seemed num
erous.
Although a North Vietnamese flag
in the crowd could not be detected,
followers of Dr. Timothy Leary in
stead brandished a flag which called
for the legalizing of marijuana.

An indignant fundamentalist,
equipped with a megaphone, hearty
voice and a strong will, who urged
the audience to "give yourselves to
Christ," was met with only mild ridi
cule and indifference; the onlookers
became more restive, however, when
the sound system was paralyzed for
almost a haif hour due to a cut wire.
Hell's Angels
A Hell's Angels delegation stepped
in and volunteered to protect the
sound system; when told of this act
of generosity, the crowd roared ap
preciatively.
The apparent absence of policemen
was striking. The event was without
serious incident, although one woman
visitor, in a transparent blouse, prob
ably would have been arrested under
more usual circumstances.
Leary spoke briefly, urging his
listeners to "turn on, tune in and drop
out." He went on to translate the
esoteric, three-point cure-all in the fol
lowing: "Find meaning within one
self, harness it up in acts of beauty
and glory and drop out of high school,
grad school, junior executive and
senior executive."

To "drop out" is the "hard way,"
Leary asserted. He labeled "addictive
behavior" as "conforming to society."
Since Leary is the strong advocate
of using marijuana, LSD and peyote
for "inner discovery," his use of "ad
dictive" was obviously not in the nar
cotic sense.
Lenore Kandel, author of the con
troversial "Love Book," read her
poem "Invocation for Maitreya," and
its blunt imagery evoked positive
response from her listeners.
The "non-political" event assumed
a new dimension when Jerry Rubin,
one of the six non-students arrested
November 30 last year during the
prestrike at UC Berkeley, addressed
the audience and requested donations
so that he, Mario Savio and four
others could be bailed out of jail.

out." He went on to translate the
esoteric, three-point cure-all in the fol
lowing: "Find meaning within one
self, harness it up in acts of beauty
and glory and drop out of high school,
grad school, junior executive and
senior executive."

To "drop out" is the "hard way,"
Leary asserted. He labeled "addictive
behavior" as "conforming to society."
Since Leary is the strong advocate
of using marijuana, LSD and peyote
for "inner discovery," his use of "ad
dictive" was obviously not in the nar
cotic sense.
Lenore Kandel, author of the con
troversial "Love Book," read her
poem "Invocation for Maitreya," and
its blunt imagery evoked positive
response from her listeners.
The "non-political" event assumed
a new dimension when Jerry Rubin,
one of the six non-students arrested
November 30 last year during the
prestrike at UC Berkeley, addressed
the audience and requested donations
so that he, Mario Savio and four
others could be bailed out of jail.
Hemmed-in among hundreds
around the stage, this writer never
would have intrcepted Ginsberg, if a
long-haired participant had not yelled
"Allen," as he stepped down into
the mass of people.
I followed this person closely

through the crowd, and finally came
upon Ginsberg, who looked as if he
had just left the Roman forum,
though in dirty laundry.
Mela
Ginsberg briefly likened the event
to the Indian "mela," a religious festi
val. A long haired admirer ap
proached the poet and said, "Mr. Gins
berg, I want you to be President of
the United States." Ginsberg re
sponded "not for the
present."
It was difficult attaining a con
sensus as to visitors' motives for at
tending. A bare-chested man called
the event "groovy". "This is where
it is happening . . . right now," he
said. A woman in her late twenties,
who commented that she attended a
Hell's Angels function only two
weeks before, called the Polo Grounds
event "fun."
An 11-year-old boy, whose father
is a poet and friend of Ginsberg,
offered perhaps the most articulate
explanation: speaking of the folk
rock music, "I like the bands; besides,
nobody gets hurt."
