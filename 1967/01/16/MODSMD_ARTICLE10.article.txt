# Overseas Board To Discuss Austria
## 
### 
The Overseas Campus Board
will hold an open meeting Tues
day night for organization of
committees to study the prob
lems that have arisen concern
ing the Austrian campus: selec
tion, judicial procedures, orien
tation, and all other aspects of
the program which require re
view.
The meeting will be in Tresid
der 275 at 10 p.m., and all mem
bers of the university commu
nity interested in the program
and its operation are urged to
attend.
With the meeting the board

is attempting to develop a crit
ical attitude toward specific
aspects of the program, and thus
take a step forward in its drive
to supplement its traditional role
of merely assisting in overseas
campus orientation.
Expand Structure
The board considers it neces
sary to expand its structure in
order to accomplish this and
other goals, and to this end will
intiate further studies concern
ing aspects of the overseas cam
puse program. These studies will
be carried on by committees

comprised of both board mem
bers and other interested stu
dents, not necessarily overseas
campuses alumni.
At the open meeting, the board
hopes to find students interested
in serving on committees con
sidering: Problems of the Aus
trian Campus, chaired by Diana
Wilson; Orientation, John Kauf
man; Judicial Procedures and
Forms, Pat Deckert; Selection,
John Merrill; Campus Location,
Martha Bell; Pre-orientation,
Barbara Dodge; communication
with groups currently overseas,
Ken Kirkland; and other topics

relevant to the Overseas Cam
pus Program.
Can't Attend??
Those who cannot attend the
meeting are urged to contact
the committee chairmen at som*
other time or to leave a note a<
the Overseas Campuses Office.
According to Overseas Cam
puses Board chairman Dave
Hakken, "The success of the
Martindale Report and the re
cent changes in social regula
tions at the overseas centers arÂ»*
indication of the positive ef
fects that student concern and
criticism can have."
