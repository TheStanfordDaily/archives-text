### MIKE KUHL 
A representative of Coro
Foundation, a foundation offer
ing internship in political sci
ence, will be in the Placement
Office to explain its scholarship
program on Wednesday, Jan
uary 18.
Each year through a nation
wide process, eighteen
candidates are selected for
twelve intern positions. During
the second phase of the selec
tion process, these candidates are
interviewed as a group bv busi
ness, government, and political
leaders.
Coro (the name is an inven
tion of the founders )got its

start in 1942 with the early sup
port of Van Duyn Dodge, a San
Francisco investment manager
and W. Donald Fletcher, an
Atherton attorney.
Selection
Fletcher, now Coro's working
president, says of the selection
nroeess, "We want people with
imagination, people who can dis
cover new ways to attack prob
lems."
The twelve interns receive a
subsistence scholarshio of $2240
to $2700 and a draft deferment
while involving themselves in a
variety of experiences aimed at
developing top leaders.

One of the ten Interns cur
rently involved in the nine
month Bay Area program is
Frank Olrich who graduated
from Stanford with a degree in
sociology before becoming in
volved in the program. He says
his experiences, especially h ,c >
work with Mark Sullivan for
Congress, have, "given me a
perspective on what makes peo
ple tick."
This perspective is the result
of a Coro program which in
volves work in governmental
agencies, business, labor union ,
trade and professional associa
tions ,and political groups.
