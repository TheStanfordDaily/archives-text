### 
SAIGCIs—In the U.S.-led drive through the
Communists' Iron Triangle north of Saigon,
enemy losses were reported at nearly 600 men,
and South Vietnamese infantrymen in the op
eration clashed with Viet Cong for the first
time since the operation started a week ago.
The push into the Iron Triangle, called Op
eration Cedar Falls, continued to be marked
by what spokesmen called light, sporadic con
tact with small enemy units.
Weather over North Vietnam improved
slightly yesterday and U.S. Air Force and
Navy pilots stepped up their attacks on tar
gets in the Communist North. Two flights re
ported sighting Communist Migs, but there
were no reports of aerial clashes.
FlO5 Thunderchief pilots attacked the Viet
Tri raildoad yard about 30 miles northwest
of Hanoi, and fliers reported a turning area
and other points in the yard interdicted.
They say they also damaged or destroyed
five antiaircraft sites and numerous automatic
weapons sites in the same area. Pilots said
their 750-pound bombs set off several second
ary explosions that sent black smoke rising
800 feet in the air.
Navy pilots from the USS Coral Sea, mean
while, reported they hit the Qui Vinh railroad
aiding 33 miles southwest of Thanh Hoa. They
said they destroyed eight box cars, damaged
12 others, interdicted the tracks and set off
one secondary explosion.
Vietnamese military headquarters said Gov
ernment troops killed 44 Viet Cong and cap
tured three Sunday in an engagement about
70 miles south of Saigon in the Mekong Delta.
Spokesmen said there were only light casu
alties among Government troops in the regi
mental size search and destroy operation.
At a news conference in Saigon yesterday,
U.S. Undersecretary of the Navy Robert H. B.
Baldwin acknowledged that some bombs

missed their targets during American air
raids on North Vietnam.
"We are not out to kill civilians," Baldwin
said. "Obviously, some bombs fell outside the
target areas. You are not going to hit the
target every time."
• Cong KiU 41 Prisoners
SAIGON — Military sources said yesterday
the Viet Cong shot and killed 41 of 48 prisoners
at a Menkong Delta prison camp after the site
was discovered by Vietnamese troops.
U.S. mission officials said they were investi
gating and seeking further information. Of
ficials say they assumed all the persons were
Vietnamese, but there were no further de
tails. The slayi.igs occurred Sunday about 110
miles southwest of Saigon as Government
troops approached the camp still guarded by
Viet Cong, according to military sources.
"In other action in the Mekong Delta, an
American troop transport helicopter was shot
down by enemy fire yesterday south of Saigon
and eight U.S. servicemen were killed," a mili
tary spokesman reported yesterday. The ninth
man aboard the CH47 twin-rotor Chinook was
reported missing.
INTERNATIONAL
• U Thant Predicts Clash
UNITED NATlONS—Secretary General U
Thant reported yesterday that a large buildup
of military forces on the border between Israel
and Syria threatened to erupt into a large
scale clash "at any moment."
He appealed to both governments to restrain
their forces and meet with U.N. officials on the
spot to settle disputes over cultivation of the

demilitarized zone that have brought recent
exchanges of fire.
Thant reported on the situation in a note
to the Security Council. He did not ask for a
meeting.
Thant told the Council he had "disturbing
reports" yesterday from Norwegian Lt. Gen.
Odd Bull, Chief of Staff of the U.N. Truce Sup
ervision Organization in Palestine.
He said that in view of the reports he had
dispatched an urgent appeal to Israel and
Syria by cable through their U.N. permanent
representatives.
The appeal, which he quote in full, said
his reports from Bull were "of such disturbing
nature as to impel me to communicate with
you urgently."
"The reports tell of a large buildup of heavy
arms, armored vehicles and military personnel
in the area within the demilitarized zones on
both sides of the lines," he said.
