•U.K.: Common Market?
ROME—Prime Minister Harold Wilson of
Britain and his Foreign Secretary, George
Brown, arrived in Home last night to start a
series of meetings aimed at judging Britain's
chances of entering the European Common
Market.
Before returning home tomorrow they will
be received in audience by Pope Paul VI, with
whom they are expected to discuss Vietnam
peace prospects. U.S. Ambassador Henry Cabot
Lodge is expected to see the Pope today. Lodge

is on his way back to Saigon.
The Britons' talk with Premier Aldo Moro
and his advisers begin today at Rome's Palazzo
Chigi.
During the next six weeks Wilson and
Brown will visit each of the six Common Mar
ket capitals.
Their next stop, January 24-25, is Paris and
that is expected to be their toughest test. It
was President Charles De Gaulle's veto that
blocked Britain's first bid to join the Common
Market, made by Prime Minister Harold Mac-
Millan's old Conservative government.
From these talks the British leaders hope
to gain information to decide whether to seek
formal negotiations.
Their talks will concentrate on agriculture,
financial policies, commonwealth trade prefer
ences and the Treaty of Rome which estab
lished the Common Market. The continued role
of sterling as an international reserve currency
and cooperation in defense projects also will be
discussed.
• Korea Trespasses
SEOUL, Koera — "High performance North
Korean jets violated air-space 10 miles south
of the truce border," the United Nations Com
mand said yesterday.
The Command said the North Korean air
craft crossed the demilitarized zone Saturday
at 26,000 feet about 30 miles north of Seoul
and flew east about 40 miles before they re
turned north. A Command statement in Seoul
did not specify the type or number of aircraft
or whether U.N. personnel fired warning shots.
U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Richard Ciccollela,
senior U.N. Command Delegate to the Joint
Military Armistice Commission, said the al
leged violation "is based on positive radar
plots and positive visual sightings by personnel

manning guard posts in the demilitarized
zone." In a letter, he told his counterpart,
Army Maj. Park Chung-kook, that such a
violation could have "very serious" conse
quences.

• Demos Move To Unite
SALT LAKE CITY—"An attempt will be
made to clear lines of communication within
the Democratic Party," an official said yester
day after considering criticisms and sugges
tions made at a meeting of the executive
committee of the Western States Democratic
Conference.
"We do feel—and the Democratic Party is
subject to criticism on this point—that we lost
contact in the last campaign through a break
down in communications," said Kenneth R.
Harding of Washington, D.C., Director of the
National Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee. "We are goinng to try to correct
that . . . but nobody in Washington is going to
try to tell people in the field how to run their
campaigns."
Harding made his comments after the West
ern Executive Committee yesterday praised
President Johnson's administration—and then
put on the White House doorstep a big portion
of the blame for 1966 election defeats.
The group also unanimously declared,
"All of our ills cannot be cured during the
next two years (and) unless we st&rt im
mediately ... we will have no chance (in 1968)
at all."
This stand w? t s taken after National Demo
cratic Chairman John M. Bailey told the 13-
state group that the '68 campaign is officially
under way. Baily flatly predicted the Demo
crats will carry the nation.
