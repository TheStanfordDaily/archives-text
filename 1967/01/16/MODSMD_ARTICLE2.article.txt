# Sapir Attacks Stanford Right Of Jurisdiction
## 
### 
In an open letter to the Judicial
Council, Marc Sapir, who is under pro
secution for his participation in last
year's sit-in, announced that he had
no intention to respond to the Coun
cil's summons.
Sapir claims that since he was not a
registered student when the sit-in took
place, and since no legal action was
See text of letter on page 6
taken against him at the time of the
.ncident, the University has no legal
jurisdiction over his action at that
time.
Of equal importance, he says, is that
"the Fundamental Standard contra
dicts itself when one group within
the community (the Administration)
is exempt and has final control over
ihe judgment and punishment of an
other group (the student)."
Sapir goes on to question the Ad
ministration's adherence to the Funda
mental Standard. Through its refusal
to discuss and explain University pol
icy in areas which primarily concern
â™¦he student, (The Draft System, se
cret Defense Research), the Adminis
tration violates students' rights.
