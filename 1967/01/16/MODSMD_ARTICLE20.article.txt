# POOL, VARSITY RECORDS FALL
## Swimmers Rip Up Washington 
### 
Stanford swimmers cleaned up
six Washington State pool rec
ords to whitewash the Cougars,
84-20, and then scoured the
Washington Huskies, 71-33, last
weekend.
Two Stanford varsity records
fell against Washington. Greg
Buckingham hit 1:45.2 for the
200 free to slip under Luis Ni
colao's varsity mark of 1:45.4.
Nicolao then lowered his var
sity record for 200 butterfly to
1:58.2.
Bill Kee started off the WSU
meet in winning style with a
pool-record 55.3 backstroke lead
off on the 400 medley relay
Both Wins Two
Rick Roth won two events
against the Cougars. Roth's
2:04.7 in the 200 individual
medley was good for a pool rec
cord. Later, Roth took a judges'
decision from Kee in the 200
backstroke for a pool record
2:06.6.
Mark Parmely won the 50 free
In 22.4 and grabbed the 100 free
in 49.7. Buckingham swam the
1000 free in a pool record 10:10.8
and also won the 200 breast
stroke in 2:22.8.
Pete Siebert's 2:03.5 for the
200 fly made a new mark on the
Cougar's pool record board.
Dave Duxbury accumulated 190.-
25 points to win the diving.
Washington State's only first
place came in the 200 freestyle,
as Hugh Mackenzie hit 1:52.5
for the victory.
Huskies Tougher Prey
The Indians made it to Seattle
via a seven hour bus ride after
the airways were too soupy to
navigate.
Stanford won the medley re
lay with a 3:42.4 effort, a slim
half second ahead of Washing
ton. Bob Momsen's 1:02.9 breast
stroke leg and Nicolao's 51.7
butterfly segment were the de
ciding factors.

Washington won the 50 free
in 22.9, and came uncomfortably
close in the following event,
the 200 IM.
Parmely Wins 200 IM, 500
Mark Parmely put on a last
ditch sprint to win in 2:03.7, two
tenths ahead of Husky Tim
Roark. Parmely won the 500 free
later in the meet with a 5:09.8.
Duxbury ran up his highest
total in the diving, 216.6, but
could not overtake the two
Washington divers.
The 200 breaststroke went to
Momsen in 2:18.2, but the sur
prise of the meet was Morgan
Manning's brisk 2:20.4 in second
place.
Big Guns Fire In Belay
Coach Jim Gaughran mounted
the Indians' big guns for the 400
freestyle relay. Buckingham
Nicolao, Roth, and captain Jim
Laney averaged 48.4 for a 3:13.5.
Stanford's long-distance, heavy
practice schedule hurt the In
dian sprint times last weekend,
but it generally pays off save
the "peak" for later in the sea
son. The Cards next swim
against Cal, January 27 at Stan
ford and January 28 in the Stan
ford Relays.
