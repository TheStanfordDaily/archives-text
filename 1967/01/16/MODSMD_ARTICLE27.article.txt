# INDIANS TRIUMPH, 5-3
## Stanford Scuttles Navy Boxers 
### JOHN MERRILL 
In the opening meet of the
season the Stanford boxing
team punched its way to a 5-3
meet victory over a team repre
senting the Twelfth Naval Dis
trict before a standing room
crowd at Encina Gym.
"With a little more work on
conditioning we should be a
strong team before the season
is over," commented coach Ray
Lunny after the bouts.
Dave Hibbits, boxing in the
145 pound division, gave Stan
ford first victory of the evening
with a convincing 3-round de
cision over free-swinging John
Gutierrez of the Navy. Hibbits
had a particularly effective sec
ond round and finished the
match well in command.
Draw For Marlar
Stanford's Jim Marlar ran
into a rough first round at the
hands of Rick Johnson of Navy.
However Marlar scored with
good right hand leads in the
second and third rounds to gain
points.
In the closing seconds of the
bout, Marlar staggered his op
ponent with what seemed the
hardest punch of the evening.
The left hooks by Marlar could
have meant the end for Johnson
if the match had been longer,
but the bell ended the match
and the decision of the judges
was a draw. One judge voted
for Marlar while the other two
called it a draw.
Navy's First Win
In the second 160 pound
match, Barney Adler of Stan
ford over-whelmed his opponent
in the first round but could not

keep up his own fast pace. The
taller Paul Wilkerson steadily
picked up points and was
awarded the match on a decision
after three rounds.
John Price, 168, picked up
Stanford's second win of the
night in an exciting match. D.
K. Andrews of the Pachunters
showed the large crowd several
new ways to avoid punches as
well as landing many good left
hands. However Price took the
fight to Andrews in the third
round and won the decision go-'
ing away.
Tom Jenks, Stanford's league
champion of last year had a
tough time winning his initial
match of the year in the 178
pound class.
Strong and quick Jerry Tuck
er rained left hands on Jenks
all three rounds, though Jenks
got the best of the exchanges
and won the decision in perhaps
the best match of the card.
11-Seoond Match
In what was to be the shortest
bout of the evening (and per
haps the season) Dave Oswald
of Stanford drew with Troy
Grey of the Navy. The two
bumped heads 11 seconds after
the opening bell and Grey suf
fered a cut eye.
The match was stopped at
that point and according to lea
gue rules the bout was an auto
matic draw. The fans lustily
cheered Oswald and were left
to wonder what would have hap
pened if the match had contin
ued. Oswald was at least 20

pounds heavier than his foe,
though both were boxing the
heavyweight class.
In the second heavyweight
match, Mike Palmer of Stanford
was defeated by Maurice Stoval
of Navy. The match started with
a wild flurry then slowed down
to a good boxing exhibition. Sto
val, the quicker of the two, won
a decision.
DeGooyer Dominates Opponent
In the final bout of the night,
Eric De Gooyer of Stanford

swarmed all over his heavy
weight opponent and the refer
ree stopped the match at the
end of the first round. From the
opening seconds when De Gooy
er pushed his man back into his
own corner, the match was
never in doubt.
De Gooyer's TKO made Stan
ford's card for the meet 4-2-2,
giving the Tribe a 5-3 meet vic
tory. The next meet for the
team will be against California
at Berkeley on January 27.
