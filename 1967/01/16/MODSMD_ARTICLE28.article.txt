# Tribe Surprises USC, 67-58, Then Falls To Lew, UCLA
## 
### JIM MALLERY 
Stanford emerged from it's
two-game series last weekend
with an impressive split, knock
ing off the strong S. C. Trojans
before falling to the number one
team in the nation, UCLA, 116-
78. The Cards are now in second
place in the conference with a
3-1 record.
Friday night the Indians took
advantage of double-figure scor
ing from five men to knock off
Southern Cal 67-58. Sophomore
Don Griffin led the attack with
14 points, gathering eight of
these at the opening of the sec
ond half.
Coach Dallmar called this
their best game of the season,
and cited in particular the tough
Stanford defense as being re
sponsible for the ball-handling
which broke SC's back.
Trojan Lead Brief
At one time late in the game,
the Trojans came on to take a
4544 lead, but a series of turn
overs and bad passes paved the
way for an eleven point burst
by the Cards, and they never
threatened again.
During that period, sophomore
substitute Mai McElwain hit for

six points in a row, with Gary
Petersmeyer and Rich Baker ac
counting for the other five.
The combined defense of Mc-
Elwain and starter Howard Has
sen held the highly touted Bill
Hewitt to only six points. SC's
juniorcollege transfer, ac
claimed one of the best shooters
in the nation and averaging 23.3
points per game, was also re
sponsible for numerous passing
errors.
Hot Second Half For Cards
The Indian's led at halftime 31-
26 in spite of their poor shooting.
They hit only 27 per cent of their
shots from the floor, as against
36.4 per cent for the Trojans. The
Cards got the hot hand in the
second half, however, and raised
their percentage to 36 for the
game, compared to 35 per cent
overall for SC.
In Westwood the following
night Stanford fortunes took a
drastic nosedive.
"LewCLA" Too Much
Riding high on a four game
win streak and tied for the con
ference lead with UCLA, the In

dians entered Pauley Pavilion
seeking an upset, and at one
point they ledâ€”that was with the
score 2-0. But from then on it
was all UCLA. The Bruins went
on to take leads of 15-5, 40-14, and
finally 116-78.
Though scoring "only" 38
points, big Lew Alcindor enjoyed
one of his best first halfs, sinking
11-12 field goals and hitting all
four of his foul shots for 26
points. He finished the game
with 37.
Griffin Hits 22
Once again Don Griffin was
high scorer for the Cards with
22 points. It was his shooting at
one point in the second half that
kept the margin at less than
forty points, but it was hardly
enough to give the Indians hope.
To open the second half, UCLA
hit their first eight shots to ex
pand their 24 point halftime mar
gin, and if there had been any
hope for the Indians before, it
was wiped out in the first three
minutes of play.
Coach Dallmar stressed that
UCLA is not as good a team as

they appeared, and that Stan
ford is not that bad. UCLA
seemed to be more keyed for
this game than their other con
ference tilts, perhaps as a result
of the rough treatment they
claimed to have received at the
hands of Cal the night before.
Stanford's poor showing may
have been as a result of their
own inexperience.. Stanford
plays with only four lettermen.
At any rate, Dallmar said it was
"a very poor game in every
phase" for the Cards.
Nothing- Would Stop Bruins
Stanford tried both a zone de
fense and a man-to-man to stop
the awesome scoring punch of
the UCLA sophomores, but
neither proved successful.
On the zone, if they stopped
Alcindor, someone else was
always open to score, particular
ly Lucius Allen, who potted 24
points for the night
The man-toman left only one
man to cover Big Lew, Rich
Baker in most cases, and that is
something no one man has been
able to do this season.
