# Cal's Tuition Battle
## 
### 
California's new Governor has stepped into a
hornet's nest, and not too surprisingly he is get
ting stung by the academic community. Ronald
Reagan's tuition proposal for the state univer
sities and colleges may soothe Californa's finan
cial difficulties, but only at the expense of educa
tion.
We concede that "free education" is a myth:
education never was free and probably never
will be. The state's taxpayers have borne much
of the cost for first-rate higher education. How
ever when the meager incidental fees are com
pared with total student expenditure (an esti
mated $1700 per year at Berkeley )„ it becomes
apparent that students are not being handed an
education for free.
The plain facts are that many students are
working for their education right now. The im
position of an additional $400 per year at uni
versities and $200 at state colleges places the
burden in the wrong place, and threatens to
leave the human resources of lower income
groups undeveloped.
More amazing than the Governor's financial
arguments has been his assertions that students
will have a greater appreciation for their educa
tion if they share in the financial responsibility,
and moreover that they will work harder on aca
demics. Neither the wisdom of the Governor's

chair nor increased financial burden is necessary
to impress upon the college generation the im
portance of education.
As for the Governor's claim that students will
work harder academically, even the critics of
the multiversity never contended that the uni
versity did not demand hard work. And the first
year attrition rate seems to indicate that Cali
fornia taxpayers are not supporting centers of
sugar-coated scholarship.
It is no simple coincidence that industry and
technology have flourished along side the na
tion's greatest educational system. Higher edu
cation has played a large role in California's post
war development.
The state's financial position is not the doing
of the new administration.The population ex
plosion and the financial acrobatics of the Brown
administration have left the state and its tax
payers in a squeeze. However, state tuitions, as
Clark Kerr has noted, could mean a shift of en
rollments to junior colleges, which are sup
ported by local school districts. The financial
burden would shift to the property owners, and
statistics quickly demonstrate that the state is
the much more economic educational agency.
We look unfavorably upon any attempt by the
Governor to solve his budget wories at the cost
of education.

leave the human resources of lower income
groups undeveloped.
More amazing than the Governor's financial
arguments has been his assertions that students
will have a greater appreciation for their educa
tion if they share in the financial responsibility,
and moreover that they will work harder on aca
demics. Neither the wisdom of the Governor's

chair nor increased financial burden is necessary
to impress upon the college generation the im
portance of education.
As for the Governor's claim that students will
work harder academically, even the critics of
the multiversity never contended that the uni
versity did not demand hard work. And the first
year attrition rate seems to indicate that Cali
fornia taxpayers are not supporting centers of
sugar-coated scholarship.
It is no simple coincidence that industry and
technology have flourished along side the na
tion's greatest educational system. Higher edu
cation has played a large role in California's post
war development.
The state's financial position is not the doing
of the new administration.The population ex
plosion and the financial acrobatics of the Brown
administration have left the state and its tax
payers in a squeeze. However, state tuitions, as
Clark Kerr has noted, could mean a shift of en
rollments to junior colleges, which are sup
ported by local school districts. The financial
burden would shift to the property owners, and
statistics quickly demonstrate that the state is
the much more economic educational agency.
We look unfavorably upon any attempt by the
Governor to solve his budget wories at the cost
of education.
California's new Governor has stepped into a
hornet's nest, and not too surprisingly he is get
ting stung by the academic community. Ronald
Reagan's tuition proposal for the state univer
sities and colleges may soothe Californa's finan
cial difficulties, but only at the expense of educa
tion.
We concede that "free education" is a myth:
education never was free and probably never
will be. The state's taxpayers have borne much
of the cost for first-rate higher education. How
ever when the meager incidental fees are com
pared with total student expenditure (an esti
mated $1700 per year at Berkeley )„ it becomes
apparent that students are not being handed an
education for free.
The plain facts are that many students are
working for their education right now. The im
position of an additional $400 per year at uni
versities and $200 at state colleges places the
burden in the wrong place, and threatens to
leave the human resources of lower income
groups undeveloped.
