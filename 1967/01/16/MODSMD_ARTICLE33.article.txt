## Freak-Out At The H-Center 
### Bob Fishman 
Now that the International
Center has been officially dedi
cated, I think the University's
next task must be to find a home
for our American-born foreign
student.s
I am referring, of course, to
that unique nationality, the Hip
pies.
With colonies in Haight-Ash
bury, Sunset Strip, and the East
Village, this underdeveloped but
rapidly-expanding state of mind
will surely play an important role
in American affairs.
Unfortunately, the strange cus
toms and dress of these people
has resulted in many misconcep
tions on the part of American
students.
New Center
An H-Center is the obvious

means to promote understanding
between the two cultures.
So far, only Hippie music has
made much of an impression in
the West. American students find
this loud, highly rhythmic mu
sic to be "strangely evocative."
To increase cross-cultural un
derstanding the members of the
H-Center could organize an ex
hibition of their native arts and
crafts. Many authorities contend
that these "pop" artifacts have
as much artistic merit as those
produced in civilized countries.
Hippie films, though primitive
by our standards, have aroused
wide interest among students and
censorship officials.
Cultural Benefits
Hopefully, the H-Center mem
bers could be persuaded to stage
one of their native dramas or

"Happenings." These ritualistic
performances, so strange to
Western minds, are an integral
part of Hippie culture.
Socially, functions like 'An
Evening In Haight-Ashbury"
could introduce American stu
dents to the Hippie way of life.
Stanford living-groups could
"adopt" a Hippie and invite him
to dinner once a week. A few
Hippies might even be persuaded
to show slides of their native land
to campus organizations.
Intellectually, professors of
anthropology and others who
have lived among the Hippies
might give a series of lecutres on
their values and traditions.
Field Work
If money can be found, ex
change students could be sent to
study the Hippies in their native

environment. Of course, at least
two years of intensive language
training would have to be a pre
requisite.
Even with langauge training,
some scholars have asserted that
it is impossible for the Western
mind to ever understand the Hip
pies.
"Even if you've spent your
whole life studying the Hippies, 1
you'll never really know when
to applaud at one of their Hap
penings," said one professor.
A whole school of scholars
known as Hippologists have at
tempted to interpret Hippie poli
tics, but no one has yet succeeded.
Nonetheless, world peace de
pends upon an all-out effort by
American students to bridge the
gap between the Hippies and
themselves.

that these "pop" artifacts have
as much artistic merit as those
produced in civilized countries.
Hippie films, though primitive
by our standards, have aroused
wide interest among students and
censorship officials.
Cultural Benefits
Hopefully, the H-Center mem
bers could be persuaded to stage
one of their native dramas or

"Happenings." These ritualistic
performances, so strange to
Western minds, are an integral
part of Hippie culture.
Socially, functions like 'An
Evening In Haight-Ashbury"
could introduce American stu
dents to the Hippie way of life.
Stanford living-groups could
"adopt" a Hippie and invite him
to dinner once a week. A few
Hippies might even be persuaded
to show slides of their native land
to campus organizations.
Intellectually, professors of
anthropology and others who
have lived among the Hippies
might give a series of lecutres on
their values and traditions.
Field Work
If money can be found, ex
change students could be sent to
study the Hippies in their native

environment. Of course, at least
two years of intensive language
training would have to be a pre
requisite.
Even with langauge training,
some scholars have asserted that
it is impossible for the Western
mind to ever understand the Hip
pies.
"Even if you've spent your
whole life studying the Hippies, 1
you'll never really know when
to applaud at one of their Hap
penings," said one professor.
A whole school of scholars
known as Hippologists have at
tempted to interpret Hippie poli
tics, but no one has yet succeeded.
Nonetheless, world peace de
pends upon an all-out effort by
American students to bridge the
gap between the Hippies and
themselves.
Now that the International
Center has been officially dedi
cated, I think the University's
next task must be to find a home
for our American-born foreign
student.s
I am referring, of course, to
that unique nationality, the Hip
pies.
With colonies in Haight-Ash
bury, Sunset Strip, and the East
Village, this underdeveloped but
rapidly-expanding state of mind
will surely play an important role
in American affairs.
Unfortunately, the strange cus
toms and dress of these people
has resulted in many misconcep
tions on the part of American
students.
New Center
An H-Center is the obvious

means to promote understanding
between the two cultures.
So far, only Hippie music has
made much of an impression in
the West. American students find
this loud, highly rhythmic mu
sic to be "strangely evocative."
To increase cross-cultural un
derstanding the members of the
H-Center could organize an ex
hibition of their native arts and
crafts. Many authorities contend
that these "pop" artifacts have
