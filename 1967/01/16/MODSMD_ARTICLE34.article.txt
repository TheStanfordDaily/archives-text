## Draft Defenders Resist Call To Pacifism 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
David Harris' latest selfrigh
teous proclamation, this time
urging Stanford men to resist
the draft, makes it impossible
for me to retain silent any long
er.
Although Harris appears to
think that all those who disagree
with him fall into the neat cate
gories of a) right wing radicals
or b) "typical American know
nothings," I do not consider my
self a member of either of these
two groups.
My view of America's commit
ment in Southeast Asia is a typ
ical manifestation of my lack of
agreement with the Harris phi
losophy. Although I cannot say
that I entirely approve of the
manner in which the conflict in
Vietnam has been handled by
our government, I can agree
with President Johnson that our
presence, a great evil, is required
to ward off a greater evil. Our
purpose is quite simply to guar
antee the sovereignty of the
countries of Southeast Asia.
The reaction of the Harris
group to my beliefs with respect
to Vietnam will be the expected
one—they will say that I am
cruel and inhuman and be aghast
to understand how a "hip, alert"
Stanford student could hold such
ridiculous views. But their re
action is all for naught, since
my opinions have as a basis
what I feel has been a careful
study of the problems in South
east Asia. I shall not be in
timidated by the sheer magni
tude of the noise put out by this
small group.

Editor, The Daily:
Any comment I could make
about motives behind Dave Har
ris' call for defiance of the draft
would be pure speculation, but I
do think the logic behind the
call to pacifism deserves to be
challenged. Harris' summation
of the spirit of the meeting
"When I say I won't be your
enemy, it's hard for you to be
come one.") is patently absurd.
The disgusting head-shaving in
dicent he recently endured illus
trates the flaw beautifully. He
refused to be the enemy of his
attackers; he set them a fine
pacifist moral example—but he
lost his hair.
In Vietnam, as in many other

places where the vital interests
of peoples and ideologies collide,
the stakes are much higher but
the consequences are the same.
One-sided pacifism means the
complete imposition of the will
of the non-pacifist side's will on
the pacificists. If that will were
only a thoughtless head-saving,
one might accept it. But, when
that will is the subjugation of a
people to a regime that sup
presses all political and intellec
tual dissent and considers civil
liberties irrelevant, the argu
ment for accepting it weakens
considerably.
So, to those in Dave Harris'
audience: Burn your draft card
and go to jail if you wish, but
remember while you are strik
ing the match that pacifism can
exist only behind the shield pro
vided by those who are willing
to oppose tyranny by force. It
doesn't matter whether the tyr
anny of the moment is Fascism,
Imperialism, or Communism. It
will not disappear just because
you have shamed it by your
moral example.

• Diversity
Editor, The Daily:
We live in a world confronted
by so many grave problems that
I am disturbed that many stu
dents at a serious university
should have to spend time debat
ing the issues involved in the
OFF movement. There should be
no question about the right of
women students to live off cam
pus should they choose to do so.
The University housing policy,
until the Grove Experiment, has
been so unimaginative that I
can see no reason why anyone
expects women students of intel
ligence and sensitivity to be sat
isfied with it.
One of our privileges as human
beings, in a generous society,
would seem to be the choosing
of the kind of intellectual and
aesthetic environment in which
we can work most effectively.
My own experience with wom
en's dormitories strongly sug
gests that there is every reason
in the world to be dissatified.
Some years ago, as an under
graduate, I'm sure I would have
been even more discontented
than the students in the OFF
movement if my college had not
at least offered the opportunity

to live in cooperative houses
where we were largely respon
sible for our own decor, cooking,
and social regulations, and where
male students joined us in pre
paring and eating meals. These
houses were, not surprisingly,
centers of the most vital discus
sions and rewarding social activi
ties; friendships made there
have proved strong enough to
survive intense intellectual dis
agreements as well as long sep

arations following the college
years.
My argument is that women
students, by virtue of all this
University claims to be, have
a right to complain if their hous
ing needs have not beet met and
have the right to choose their
own style of life off campus if
Stanford has not provided suffl
cent diversity in housing ar
rangements.
