## Sapir Explains Reasons For Refusing Summons 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
As you are aware, I have been summoned to appear before the
Judicial Council on Monday, January 16, regarding my participation
in last year's sit-in. I am writing this letter to let the Council know
that I will not respond to the summons and to inform the Council
of my reasons; there are four:
(1) Because I was not a registered student at the time of the sit
in, neither the Administration nor the Judicial Council has any legal
jurisdiction over my actions at that time.
(2) Because the Fundamental Standard is only being interpreted
as applicable to certain members of the University community (stu
dents) and is being freely applied by an exempt group (the Adminis
tration) which has final authority in determining guilt and punish
ment (including the authority to override the Judical Council "by
Appeal" as in Traister case) I find the Standard, as applied, to be
self-contradicting and in fact based upon an authoritarian principle.
(3) Because the issues in the sit-in related to the welfare of stu
dents, and because the sit-in resulted from the Admlnstration's un
willingness to discuss or debate, in public, such arbitary decisions as
compliance with requests of the Draft System, acceptance of classi
fied secret research from the Defense Department (possibly involv
ing Chemical-Biological Warfare) and, more recently, the disclosure
of names of people in some of the campus political organizations to
governmental investigating agencies (CIA, FBI, HCUA), there is
serious question as to who in fact is in violation of the principles of
the Fundamental Standard, the sit-in group or the Administration.
(4) Because the Judicial Council, after having rescinded its penal
ties against the entire sit-in group (due to the Administration's re
fusal to hold seminars prescribed in the penalty) has no re-reversed
itself and imposed an even more inappropriate sentence (specifically
suggested by Dean Winbigler), I can not possibly respect the in
tegrity of the Council itself in dealing with fellow students when
the Administration is involved in any way.
Those who are responsible for restricting the freedom of men to
honestly raise and seek answers to pressing moral, political, social,
and personal questions ought to consider that they may be jeopar
dizing the freedom of the entire community; and, at the very least,
that they are probably insuring that students remain unaware of
the coersion that is operative on our college campuses and through
out our society. MARC SAPIR

Judicial Council on Monday, January 16, regarding my participation
in last year's sit-in. I am writing this letter to let the Council know
that I will not respond to the summons and to inform the Council
of my reasons; there are four:
(1) Because I was not a registered student at the time of the sit
in, neither the Administration nor the Judicial Council has any legal
jurisdiction over my actions at that time.
(2) Because the Fundamental Standard is only being interpreted
as applicable to certain members of the University community (stu
dents) and is being freely applied by an exempt group (the Adminis
tration) which has final authority in determining guilt and punish
ment (including the authority to override the Judical Council "by
Appeal" as in Traister case) I find the Standard, as applied, to be
self-contradicting and in fact based upon an authoritarian principle.
(3) Because the issues in the sit-in related to the welfare of stu
dents, and because the sit-in resulted from the Admlnstration's un
willingness to discuss or debate, in public, such arbitary decisions as
compliance with requests of the Draft System, acceptance of classi
fied secret research from the Defense Department (possibly involv
ing Chemical-Biological Warfare) and, more recently, the disclosure
of names of people in some of the campus political organizations to
governmental investigating agencies (CIA, FBI, HCUA), there is
serious question as to who in fact is in violation of the principles of
the Fundamental Standard, the sit-in group or the Administration.
(4) Because the Judicial Council, after having rescinded its penal
ties against the entire sit-in group (due to the Administration's re
fusal to hold seminars prescribed in the penalty) has no re-reversed
itself and imposed an even more inappropriate sentence (specifically
suggested by Dean Winbigler), I can not possibly respect the in
tegrity of the Council itself in dealing with fellow students when
the Administration is involved in any way.
Those who are responsible for restricting the freedom of men to
honestly raise and seek answers to pressing moral, political, social,
and personal questions ought to consider that they may be jeopar
dizing the freedom of the entire community; and, at the very least,
that they are probably insuring that students remain unaware of
the coersion that is operative on our college campuses and through
out our society. MARC SAPIR
