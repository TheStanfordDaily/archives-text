## 
### LONNIE TERRY 
"The most important thing that
makes Stanford the greatest univer
sity in the world is its attitude toward
and interest in international relations,"
said Mr. Stephen Bechtel at Friday's
dedication of the Bechtel International
Student Center.
"The center serves a very useful
purpose as a rendezvous point for for
eign students to meet with other stu
dents from their lands as well as to
meet those from other lands and
American students," continued Bech
tel.
Then enlarged and renovated cen
ter has been the project of Bechtel

and other donors since 1963. Using the
former Zeta Psi fraternity house, they
have provided furnishings and physi
cal improvements.

Latest additions are a new front
entry and a covered, heated patio be
tween the wings of the building. Bech
tel served on the Board of Trustees
from 1959 until 1964 and began sup
porting the work of foreign students
at the University through scholar
ships and grants at that time.
"A unique character of the Interna
tional Center is the fascinating hetero
geneous group of people that gives it
its life and form," according to Ken

neth J. Cooper, director of the center
who presided over the ceremonies.
Cooper sees in the Center evidence
of the "continually developing inter
national dimensions" of Stanford.
"Students at Stanford come from over
eighty different countries of the
world," noted Cooper, and are now
served by "one of the largest inter
national student centers in the coun
try."
Interaction
President Sterling, in welcoming the
crowd and introducing Mr. Bechtel,
emphasized that "international inter
action in education is of rather re
cent vintage." He explainted that the
Bechtel Center is evidence of the "faith
and hope that international interaction
may help to promote peace by broad
ening international understanding."
Highly developed nations want to
learn more about "their world neigh
fors" and have expanded their aid
programs both from "a sense of
humane responsibility" and from
awareness of potential political ad
vantages, Sterling continued.
Born in Canada and a former grad
uate student in history at Stanford,
Sterling was described as "one of our
most respected ex-foreign students,"
by Cooper.
Home Away From Home
Trustee President Richard E. Gug
genhime accepted the center. He said,
"We are most grateful. It is a home
away from home for our foreign
friends."
Saad Raheem, president of the In
ternational Club, said "right from the
day the foreign student arrives at the
University, this is his reception place
and thereafter his home." He added
that foreign students "have an obli
gation to inform American students of
our opinions. This will save them
from some of the shocks when they
travel abroad."

Home Away From Home
Trustee President Richard E. Gug
genhime accepted the center. He said,
"We are most grateful. It is a home
away from home for our foreign
friends."
Saad Raheem, president of the In
ternational Club, said "right from the
day the foreign student arrives at the
University, this is his reception place
and thereafter his home." He added
that foreign students "have an obli
gation to inform American students of
our opinions. This will save them
from some of the shocks when they
travel abroad."
"The most important thing that
makes Stanford the greatest univer
sity in the world is its attitude toward
and interest in international relations,"
said Mr. Stephen Bechtel at Friday's
dedication of the Bechtel International
Student Center.
"The center serves a very useful
purpose as a rendezvous point for for
eign students to meet with other stu
dents from their lands as well as to
meet those from other lands and
American students," continued Bech
tel.
Then enlarged and renovated cen
ter has been the project of Bechtel

and other donors since 1963. Using the
former Zeta Psi fraternity house, they
have provided furnishings and physi
cal improvements.
Latest Additions
Latest additions are a new front
entry and a covered, heated patio be
tween the wings of the building. Bech
tel served on the Board of Trustees
from 1959 until 1964 and began sup
porting the work of foreign students
at the University through scholar
ships and grants at that time.
"A unique character of the Interna
tional Center is the fascinating hetero
geneous group of people that gives it
its life and form," according to Ken

neth J. Cooper, director of the center
who presided over the ceremonies.
Cooper sees in the Center evidence
of the "continually developing inter
national dimensions" of Stanford.
"Students at Stanford come from over
eighty different countries of the
world," noted Cooper, and are now
served by "one of the largest inter
national student centers in the coun
try."
Interaction
President Sterling, in welcoming the
crowd and introducing Mr. Bechtel,
emphasized that "international inter
action in education is of rather re
cent vintage." He explainted that the
Bechtel Center is evidence of the "faith
and hope that international interaction
may help to promote peace by broad
ening international understanding."
