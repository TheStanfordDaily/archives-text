# SECOND OF SERIES ON LSD
## TMU Presents Leary Psychedelic Lecture 
### MARTHA HUMPHREY 
Dr. Timothy Leary, proponent of
the therapeutic and religious uses of
LSD, will speak tonight on "The Psy
chedelic Experience" at 8 p.m., Tresid
der Lounge.

After his first psychedelic experi
ence in 1960 with a handful of mush
rooms procured from a witch doctor,
Leary has become the symbol of the
LSD movement in the United States
today.

Because of his reputation as the
LSD prophet he is also a scapegoat
for an enraged and fearful American
public. For his views he was dis
missed as a professor of psychology
from Harvard and faces a possibility
of 46 years-in-jail for illegal posses
sion of marijuana.
Since his experience with the mush
rooms at the age of 39, Leary claims
in a September interview in Playboy
that he is no longer a "middle-aged
man involved in the middle-aged pro
cess of dying."
He feels that support and under
standing of the therapeutic and reli
gious use of LSD lies with the young
because their horizons are expanded.
The present generation under the age
of 25 is the "wisest and holiest gen
eration that the human race has ever
seen."
He admits that no one knows how
LSD can benefit humanity, but his
confidence in the young's ability to
experiment with its potentialities.
Leary defends his sometimes infam

ous motto "Turn on, Tune in, Drop
out" as meaning experiencing and
using LSD to heighten awareness of
the world, then dropping out of soci
ety's "air-conditioned anthill".
Love Experience
LSD is a love experience with the
environment. Leary says that sexual
ecstacy is the basic reason for today's
widespread use of the drug. He also
includes love of God and love of your
self as direct results of the drug's
effects.
Leary, who has set up a colony for
"Western yoga" in Millbrook, New
York, considers his work in drugs
basically religious. A Hindu, he says
that he is striving through LSD for
the expansion of consciousness and
the confrontation of new forms of
energy and wisdom.
He predicts that LSD use will take
a center-stage position in revolution
izing conventional forms of education,
child rearing and social behavior.

York, considers his work in drugs
basically religious. A Hindu, he says
that he is striving through LSD for
the expansion of consciousness and
the confrontation of new forms of
energy and wisdom.
He predicts that LSD use will take
a center-stage position in revolution
izing conventional forms of education,
child rearing and social behavior.

Dr. Timothy Leary, proponent of
the therapeutic and religious uses of
LSD, will speak tonight on "The Psy
chedelic Experience" at 8 p.m., Tresid
der Lounge.

After his first psychedelic experi
ence in 1960 with a handful of mush
rooms procured from a witch doctor,
Leary has become the symbol of the
LSD movement in the United States
today.

Because of his reputation as the
LSD prophet he is also a scapegoat
for an enraged and fearful American
public. For his views he was dis
missed as a professor of psychology
from Harvard and faces a possibility
of 46 years-in-jail for illegal posses
sion of marijuana.
Since his experience with the mush
rooms at the age of 39, Leary claims
in a September interview in Playboy
that he is no longer a "middle-aged
man involved in the middle-aged pro
cess of dying."
He feels that support and under
standing of the therapeutic and reli
gious use of LSD lies with the young
because their horizons are expanded.
The present generation under the age
of 25 is the "wisest and holiest gen
eration that the human race has ever
seen."
He admits that no one knows how
LSD can benefit humanity, but his
confidence in the young's ability to
experiment with its potentialities.
Leary defends his sometimes infam

ous motto "Turn on, Tune in, Drop
out" as meaning experiencing and
using LSD to heighten awareness of
the world, then dropping out of soci
ety's "air-conditioned anthill".
Love Experience
LSD is a love experience with the
environment. Leary says that sexual
ecstacy is the basic reason for today's
widespread use of the drug. He also
includes love of God and love of your
self as direct results of the drug's
effects.
