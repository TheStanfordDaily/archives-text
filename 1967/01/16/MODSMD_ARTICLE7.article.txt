# Still Some Steam At Space-Age Stanford
## Steamy... 
### STEVE GRUBER 
The heat is always there —in dormi
tories, classrooms, and offices. And all
of it is produced by Stanford Univer
sity.
It cost $558,000 last year to heat the
campus, according to Elbridge Bacon,
Director of the Physical Plant, and
heating requirements are increasing
every year.
The University's steam plant is re
sponsible for seeing that steam gets to
every corner of the campus. The
steam travels through a maze of tun
nels, some of which are as old as
Stanford itself.
Built In 1958
Built in 1958, the steam plant is lo
cated near the Computer Center on
the east end of the campus. It is the
University's third plant. The first, lo
cated near Engineering Corner, was
leveled by the 1906 earthquake.
The second steam plant served the
campus from 1908 to 1958 and may
still be seen near the athletic build
ing. Since 1958 it has been used as a
storeroom and will soon be converted
into a rifle range from the ROTC.
The present plant is staffed by five
men, including Supervisor Lester Mc-
Innis. It operates 24 hours per day
and, depending on the time of day,
has either one or two men at the con
trols.
Frightening;
Working at the steam plant is "a
rather frightening responsibility," ac

cording to Director Bacon. He said
that a workman could be killed or
seriously injured if he makes a mis
take. However, there have been no
serious injuries in the nine years that
the steam plant has been operating.
Producing steam is not as compli
cated as it may see at first. Stanford
uses water tube boilers in which wa
ter is run through tubes inside a fire
room. The water is converted into
steam and leaves the plant at a pres
sure of 125 pounds per square inch.
The heat inside the fireroom is
created by burning natural gas. The
fireroom is built of heavy brick which
effectively shields the workmen at
the controls from the heat. A fire
needs air to keep it burning and a
steeady draft is brought in through
one of the steam tunnels and louvers
at the top of the building. Huge fans
move the exhaust out of the plant.
No Smokestack
Utilities Superintendent Homer
Davis explained that the steam plant
does not use a smokestack because it
would be "unsightly." He also point
ed out that burning natural gas does
not create much smoke or smog.
At one time, steam tunnels were
used to carry all of the steam. Now
some of the pipes are buried. The tun
nels are seven feet high with a pipe
in the middle. In the event of a broken
pipe, the tunnels allow much easier
access for the repair crew.

Bacon said that steam tunnels were
still being built on some parts of the
campus, but, in general, the cost is
prohibitive. Building a steam tunnel
can cost as much as six to eight
times more than simply burying the
steam pipe.
The tunnels also have a return pipe,
called the condensate line. This re
turns the condensed steam, in the

form of water, to the steam plant
where it is used again. Approximate
ly 87 percent of the water, which is
purer than the regular campus drink
ing water, is recovered in this man
ner.
Once the steam reaches its destina
tion, its heat is transferred to an
other source of water in a heat ex
changer. These heat exchanges may
be found in all of the campus dormi

tories. This water does the actual
heating of individual rooms.
The four boilers in the steam plant
can handle all of Stanford's heating
requirements for the next eight to
ten years, according to Superintendent
Davis. The plant will have been ex
panded to handle four more boilers
by that time.
Continuation Seen
Stanford will continue to use steam
heating for the foreseeable future.
There are no other methods that are
feasible and electric heating is much
more expensive.
In the event of a power failure,
the steam plant has an emergency
diesel generator which will turn itself
on automatically. It will go on within
six seconds of the power failure. Al
though many parts of the campus
could go without steam for a few
hours, the Palo-Alto Stanford hospital
cannot.
Students have been exploring the
steam tunnels since 1892, when they
were built. It is possible to walk
through the tunnels from Encina to
the steam plant, approximately a half
mile, without surfacing. The tunnels
run underneath Hoover Tower, Mem
orial Auditorium, all of Inner Quad,
and the engineering buildings. Tem
peratures in the tunnels are around
100 degrees, although some are high
er. Newer tunnels have lights and are
fairly clean, but others have no lights
and are covered with a 75 year ac
cumulation of dirt.

the steam plant has been operating.
Producing steam is not as compli
cated as it may see at first. Stanford
uses water tube boilers in which wa
ter is run through tubes inside a fire
room. The water is converted into
steam and leaves the plant at a pres
sure of 125 pounds per square inch.
The heat inside the fireroom is
created by burning natural gas. The
fireroom is built of heavy brick which
effectively shields the workmen at
the controls from the heat. A fire
needs air to keep it burning and a
steeady draft is brought in through
one of the steam tunnels and louvers
at the top of the building. Huge fans
move the exhaust out of the plant.
No Smokestack
Utilities Superintendent Homer
Davis explained that the steam plant
does not use a smokestack because it
would be "unsightly." He also point
ed out that burning natural gas does
not create much smoke or smog.
At one time, steam tunnels were
used to carry all of the steam. Now
some of the pipes are buried. The tun
nels are seven feet high with a pipe
in the middle. In the event of a broken
pipe, the tunnels allow much easier
access for the repair crew.

Bacon said that steam tunnels were
still being built on some parts of the
campus, but, in general, the cost is
prohibitive. Building a steam tunnel
can cost as much as six to eight
times more than simply burying the
steam pipe.
The tunnels also have a return pipe,
called the condensate line. This re
turns the condensed steam, in the

form of water, to the steam plant
where it is used again. Approximate
ly 87 percent of the water, which is
purer than the regular campus drink
ing water, is recovered in this man
ner.
Once the steam reaches its destina
tion, its heat is transferred to an
other source of water in a heat ex
changer. These heat exchanges may
be found in all of the campus dormi

tories. This water does the actual
heating of individual rooms.
The four boilers in the steam plant
can handle all of Stanford's heating
requirements for the next eight to
ten years, according to Superintendent
Davis. The plant will have been ex
panded to handle four more boilers
by that time.
Continuation Seen
Stanford will continue to use steam
heating for the foreseeable future.
There are no other methods that are
feasible and electric heating is much
more expensive.
In the event of a power failure,
the steam plant has an emergency
diesel generator which will turn itself
on automatically. It will go on within
six seconds of the power failure. Al
though many parts of the campus
could go without steam for a few
hours, the Palo-Alto Stanford hospital
cannot.
Students have been exploring the
steam tunnels since 1892, when they
were built. It is possible to walk
through the tunnels from Encina to
the steam plant, approximately a half
mile, without surfacing. The tunnels
run underneath Hoover Tower, Mem
orial Auditorium, all of Inner Quad,
and the engineering buildings. Tem
peratures in the tunnels are around
100 degrees, although some are high
er. Newer tunnels have lights and are
fairly clean, but others have no lights
and are covered with a 75 year ac
cumulation of dirt.

Innis shown adjusting boiler No. 4.
The steam plant supplies steam to
dormitories, classrooms, and offices 24
hours per day.
The heat is always there —in dormi
tories, classrooms, and offices. And all
of it is produced by Stanford Univer
sity.
It cost $558,000 last year to heat the
campus, according to Elbridge Bacon,
Director of the Physical Plant, and
heating requirements are increasing
every year.
The University's steam plant is re
sponsible for seeing that steam gets to
every corner of the campus. The
steam travels through a maze of tun
nels, some of which are as old as
Stanford itself.
Built In 1958
Built in 1958, the steam plant is lo
cated near the Computer Center on
the east end of the campus. It is the
University's third plant. The first, lo
cated near Engineering Corner, was
leveled by the 1906 earthquake.
The second steam plant served the
campus from 1908 to 1958 and may
still be seen near the athletic build
ing. Since 1958 it has been used as a
storeroom and will soon be converted
into a rifle range from the ROTC.
The present plant is staffed by five
men, including Supervisor Lester Mc-
Innis. It operates 24 hours per day
and, depending on the time of day,
has either one or two men at the con
trols.
Frightening;
Working at the steam plant is "a
rather frightening responsibility," ac

cording to Director Bacon. He said
that a workman could be killed or
seriously injured if he makes a mis
take. However, there have been no
serious injuries in the nine years that
the steam plant has been operating.

ly 87 percent of the water, which is
purer than the regular campus drink
ing water, is recovered in this man
ner.
Once the steam reaches its destina
tion, its heat is transferred to an
other source of water in a heat ex
changer. These heat exchanges may
be found in all of the campus dormi

tories. This water does the actual
heating of individual rooms.
The four boilers in the steam plant
can handle all of Stanford's heating
requirements for the next eight to
ten years, according to Superintendent
Davis. The plant will have been ex
panded to handle four more boilers
by that time.
Continuation Seen
Stanford will continue to use steam
heating for the foreseeable future.
There are no other methods that are
feasible and electric heating is much
more expensive.
In the event of a power failure,
the steam plant has an emergency
diesel generator which will turn itself
on automatically. It will go on within
six seconds of the power failure. Al
though many parts of the campus
could go without steam for a few
hours, the Palo-Alto Stanford hospital
cannot.
Students have been exploring the
steam tunnels since 1892, when they
were built. It is possible to walk
through the tunnels from Encina to
the steam plant, approximately a half
mile, without surfacing. The tunnels
run underneath Hoover Tower, Mem
orial Auditorium, all of Inner Quad,
and the engineering buildings. Tem
peratures in the tunnels are around
100 degrees, although some are high
er. Newer tunnels have lights and are
fairly clean, but others have no lights
and are covered with a 75 year ac
cumulation of dirt.

The steam plant supplies steam to
dormitories, classrooms, and offices 24
hours per day.
The heat is always there —in dormi
tories, classrooms, and offices. And all
of it is produced by Stanford Univer
sity.
It cost $558,000 last year to heat the
campus, according to Elbridge Bacon,
Director of the Physical Plant, and
heating requirements are increasing
every year.
The University's steam plant is re
sponsible for seeing that steam gets to
every corner of the campus. The
steam travels through a maze of tun
nels, some of which are as old as
Stanford itself.
Built In 1958
Built in 1958, the steam plant is lo
cated near the Computer Center on
the east end of the campus. It is the
University's third plant. The first, lo
cated near Engineering Corner, was
leveled by the 1906 earthquake.
The second steam plant served the
campus from 1908 to 1958 and may
still be seen near the athletic build
ing. Since 1958 it has been used as a
storeroom and will soon be converted
into a rifle range from the ROTC.
The present plant is staffed by five
men, including Supervisor Lester Mc-
Innis. It operates 24 hours per day
and, depending on the time of day,
has either one or two men at the con
trols.
Frightening;
Working at the steam plant is "a
rather frightening responsibility," ac

cording to Director Bacon. He said
that a workman could be killed or
seriously injured if he makes a mis
take. However, there have been no
serious injuries in the nine years that
the steam plant has been operating.
Producing steam is not as compli
cated as it may see at first. Stanford
uses water tube boilers in which wa
ter is run through tubes inside a fire
room. The water is converted into
steam and leaves the plant at a pres
sure of 125 pounds per square inch.
The heat inside the fireroom is
created by burning natural gas. The
fireroom is built of heavy brick which
effectively shields the workmen at
the controls from the heat. A fire
needs air to keep it burning and a
steeady draft is brought in through
one of the steam tunnels and louvers
at the top of the building. Huge fans
move the exhaust out of the plant.
No Smokestack
Utilities Superintendent Homer
Davis explained that the steam plant
does not use a smokestack because it
would be "unsightly." He also point
ed out that burning natural gas does
not create much smoke or smog.
At one time, steam tunnels were
used to carry all of the steam. Now
some of the pipes are buried. The tun
nels are seven feet high with a pipe
in the middle. In the event of a broken
pipe, the tunnels allow much easier
access for the repair crew.

Bacon said that steam tunnels were
still being built on some parts of the
campus, but, in general, the cost is
prohibitive. Building a steam tunnel
can cost as much as six to eight
times more than simply burying the
steam pipe.
The tunnels also have a return pipe,
called the condensate line. This re
turns the condensed steam, in the

form of water, to the steam plant
where it is used again. Approximate
ly 87 percent of the water, which is
purer than the regular campus drink
ing water, is recovered in this man
ner.
