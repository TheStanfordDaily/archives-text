WASHINGTON (AJ) â€” The
war in Vietnam, now one of the
greatest guessing games in the
20th century, hangs like a fog
over Lynlon B. Johnson's Presi
dency and his future.
No one knows it better than
Johnson. This seems clear from
both the tone and the nature of
the State of the Union message
he delivered to Congress last
week.
In the beginning Vietnam still
seemed a little remote. While
the United States was helping
the South fight off the Commu
nist attacks from the North, its
role there was less than all-out.
But always Vietnam was a
kind of open wound. It began to
fester as the resistance of the
South weakened and the chances
of a Communist take-over in
creased. Gradually Johnson put
the United States fully into the
war.
He has talked much about it,
often with explanations which
sounded noble and unselfish, like
preserving the right of a people,
such as the South Vietnamese,

to preserve their independence
and choose their own way of
government.
But along with these fine
phrases he has consistently given
another explanation which was
not unselfish: that the United
States fears, if the Communists
can swallow South Vietnam, in
time they will swallow all South
east Asia.
And that, the Johnson admin
istration feels, as did the Eisen
hower and Kennedy administra
tions before it, is something this
country can't sit idly by and per
mit since, in the long run, Amer
ican interests would be en
dangered.
If the war continues indefi
nitely, his future may be dim,
his chances of re-election ruined
and his place in history spoiled.
An acute awareness of all this
appeared to dominate his State
of the Union message.
And, for a man who wishes
as strongly as Johnson for Presi
dential success, it must have
been a bitter acknowledgement
when he informed Congress and
the country he didn't know how
long the war would last.
