# Leary: LSD Can Cause Death And Rebirth
## 
### SANDY SHAPIRO GEOFFREY STEVENS 
'To continue again in the middle
of a sentence here at Stanford Univer
sity, Palo Alto, California. . . Dr.
Timothy Leary oriented the over-flow
crowd in the Tresidder Lounge in
time and space.
"Turn on, tune in, drop out, turn
on, tune in . . . ." chanted Dr. Leary,
proponent of the therapeutic and re
ligious uses of LSD, as he explained
the "quest for the religious experi
ence .... centering on the cyclical
rhythm of life."
"God," stated Leary, "seems to be
if anything a musician. The religious
quest is the process of centering on
the Divine Rhythm within yourself."
Dr. Leary implied that the "death
and rebirth" the emancipation from
experience under LSD was simply the
old social consciousness, and the
realization of the inner consciousness.
Calling himself "a full-time search
er for the Divine Process," he related
that his profession is the oldest in the
world: a prophet, a shaman, a sor
cerer, an alchemist, a medicine man
without an M.D. For thousands of
years, men have been turning on us
ing the sun, the beat of a drum, the
pattern of a Persian rug, sex, silence,
solitude, or a crowd, according to
Leary.
Turning On
After turning on and tuning in, man
discovers the two billion year rid ka
leidoscopic history of himself record
ed in the nucleic acid libraries of his
cells, he explained. Dr. Leary and his
group are touring the country at
tempting to share what they claim to
have learned about man and life
through the use of drugs which reveal
the evolutionary truth of the heredi
tary and nervous systems.
Removing his jacket, tie, socks, and
shoes and sitting in the darkened
room in front of a lighted candle, Dr.
Leary proceeded to simulate a "turn
ing on." He drifted back through the
ages, visiting the Romans, viewing
the bare-footed cavemen with clubs,
and finally reached the beginning
where God was found to be "the end
less atomic flash."
"So you've seen it all. What are you
going to do?" he asked. Leary told
his audience that if they take LSD,
they must be prepared to "drop out,"
meaning to "drop out of meaningless,
not out of life." As an example of
"meaningless," Dr. Leary cited the
good-grades-lucrative-job - Florida - va
cations-approach to life. "How can
you take it seriously when you've
seen how Stanford University fits into

the two-billion year scheme? And
they call Stanford-Cal the Big Game!"
Eternal Conflict
Dr. Leary commented that the eter
nal conflict between the young and
old has never been so intense. He be
moaned the fact that "men of meno
pausal mentality, spiritually dead, run
the world." He continued, "You can't
let them vote, have power or ma
chines. It's always the old men who
sit in capitals figuring out how they'll
send off seed-carrying young men to
be killed."
Although he was highly critical of
most of modern life, Dr. Leary didn't
advocate political action as a means of
reform: "Don't vote â€”if you have to,
vote for Snoopy or Bob Dylan, but
don't get involved in old men's
games."
"And so in the middle of a sen
tence ..." He left.
