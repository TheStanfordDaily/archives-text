## Tresidder Offers Japanese Flicks 
### Steve Lavine 
For anyone interested in the
cinema, Tresidder Union offers
a rare opportunity this quarter.
They are showing virtually all of
the really great films to have
been made in Japan since World
War 11.
There has been a great fear
of serious Japanese films in the
West. People are afraid of being
"taken in" by mere exoticism or
bored by the slow pace thought
to be characteristic of Japanese
films. It is also widely believed
that "good" Japanese films are
too complex for Western tastes.
These fears are largely un
grounded. Of course, a back
ground in oriental literature and
art cannot help but increase
one's enjoyment of these films.
Akira Kurosawa is the most
outstanding, living, Japanese di
rector. His films Rashomon and
Ikiru (January 27) are perhaps
the two greatest of the Japa
nese cinema. In addition, his
films The Seven Samurai (Jan
uary 20) and Yojbnbo (February
17) are the two greatest Jap
anese westerns. The American
film, The Magnificent Seven, a

fine western in its own right,
is simply a reworking of The
Seven Samurai. Kurosawa is
oriented in many ways toward
the West. He has made films us
ing Shakespeare (Throne of
Blood derives from Macbeth. It
will be shown February 14), Gor
ki (The Lower Depths), and
even Dostoevsky (The Idiot). Ku
rosawa's films are executed with
exceptional control. They con
tain a degree of purely visual
beauty that is virtually unknown
in the Western cinema. Individ
ual shots are constructed with
such control that they can stand
by themselves as works of art.
Kon Ichikawa is another Jap
anese director of exceptional
talent. He combines a dynamic
intensity with a cultivated ap
preciation of the beautiful. His
two best films, Fires on the
Plain and Harp of Burma will
be shown respectively on March
10 and March 3. The latter has
been called "the greatest pacifiist
film ever made."
For anyone seriously inter
ested in the Japanese cinema the
best full length study is The
Japanese Film by Joseph Ander
son and Donald Richie.

Ikiru (January 27) are perhaps
the two greatest of the Japa
nese cinema. In addition, his
films The Seven Samurai (Jan
uary 20) and Yojbnbo (February
17) are the two greatest Jap
anese westerns. The American
film, The Magnificent Seven, a

fine western in its own right,
is simply a reworking of The
Seven Samurai. Kurosawa is
oriented in many ways toward
the West. He has made films us
ing Shakespeare (Throne of
Blood derives from Macbeth. It
will be shown February 14), Gor
ki (The Lower Depths), and
even Dostoevsky (The Idiot). Ku
rosawa's films are executed with
exceptional control. They con
tain a degree of purely visual
beauty that is virtually unknown
in the Western cinema. Individ
ual shots are constructed with
such control that they can stand
by themselves as works of art.
Kon Ichikawa is another Jap
anese director of exceptional
talent. He combines a dynamic
intensity with a cultivated ap
preciation of the beautiful. His
two best films, Fires on the
Plain and Harp of Burma will
be shown respectively on March
10 and March 3. The latter has
been called "the greatest pacifiist
film ever made."
For anyone seriously inter
ested in the Japanese cinema the
best full length study is The
Japanese Film by Joseph Ander
son and Donald Richie.
For anyone interested in the
cinema, Tresidder Union offers
a rare opportunity this quarter.
They are showing virtually all of
the really great films to have
been made in Japan since World
War 11.
There has been a great fear
of serious Japanese films in the
West. People are afraid of being
"taken in" by mere exoticism or
bored by the slow pace thought
to be characteristic of Japanese
films. It is also widely believed
that "good" Japanese films are
too complex for Western tastes.
These fears are largely un
grounded. Of course, a back
ground in oriental literature and
art cannot help but increase
one's enjoyment of these films.
Akira Kurosawa is the most
outstanding, living, Japanese di
rector. His films Rashomon and
Ikiru (January 27) are perhaps
the two greatest of the Japa
nese cinema. In addition, his

uary 20) and Yojbnbo (February
17) are the two greatest Jap
