# First League Loss To Bruins
## Stanford Basketballers Wail And Fail On Trip To L.A. 
### NICK SELBY 
My mission, said my sports
editor, was clear: I was to grab
my gas mask and get on down
to L.A. to record all the super
sports events for the DAILY.
My first assignment was one
of the lesser super attractions —
a Stanford-USC basketball game
which attracted only 2200 fans
to the L.A. Sports Arena. The
Cards won, of course, by 67-58
in a game conspicuous for its
dullness.
loe Cold Hands
Both teams came onto the
court with fired-up spirits, but
their shooting hands were made
of ice. Over two minutes passed
without a score, and after six
minutes, it was only 7-2 for
Stanford.
By halftime, Stanford had
managed 31 points, with coach
Howie Dallmar substituting Bill
Halligan, Mai McElwain, and Ed
Martin freely to give the five
starters a rest. Art Harris had
pumped in nine points to lead
both teams in scoring. Ho-hum,
said I, I guess our Tribe will
win this one.
Well, our Tribe almost didn't

win. Twelve minutes into the
second half, USC collected four
points on fantastic fast breaks
by guard Harvey Dillon to put
the Trojans into a 44-43 lead.
But, the Cards didn't panic.
Mai McElwain made three
shots to help regain the lead.
Petersmeyer made eight points
from then on to insure the vic
tory.
Team Win
The win was typical of Stan
ford's victories this year. First,
it was a team win, with empha
sis on passing the ball well and
playing for the sure two points.
It was therefore a low scoring
battle. Stanford's five remained
patient and confident when USC
went ahead, and won.
The highlights of this game
were the time-outs. Then, the In
dian pom-pom girls seized the
floor and showed some real
moves on the court to the ac
companiment of the Stanford
band. Yeoww! said I, in awe of
their super steps.
Super I>nv a Lulu
After an almost unbearable
wait, so great was my excite

ment, the UCLA-Stanford con
test commenced, and I viewed
the action from behind the bas
ket, watching Lew Alcindor
make point after point.
His first two came on a simple
dipper dunk in which he ma
neuvered between Card center
Rich Baker and the basket. So
what, said I, any bruiser who is
7'l" and still growing and can't
dunk the ball needs a physical.
The next two points came on
another dipper-dunk. This time,
however, big Lew stuffed it
backwards. He was looking
toward the stands when he
raised the ball over and behind
his head and crammed it
through the cords. Hummn, said
I, stroking my chin in some dis
belief.
Zone Blackout
First, the Bruins full-court
press prevented the Cards from
bringing the ball up court three
times. Lucius Allen and Kenny
Heinz were going crazy making
layups on fast breaks and feed
ing Lew for dunks.
Whoa, slow down there Bear.
When the Bear didn't slow down,

Stanford called time*. It was the
end of the Cards collapsing
zone, for it had totally collapsed,
and the beginning of man-to
man slaughter.
Four Point Play?
Yoicks! said I as the points
multiplied. Now, I always
thought that the limit on points
per play was three. Not so. Lew
showed me how its done: score
two and get fouled intentionally
(Art Harris obliged) while do
ing it.
I think gang, said I, we are
in the wrong league—Wilt plays
in the NBA, not the AAWU.
Show Off
Not content with just scoring,
Alcindor had to show off and
get assists. Holding the ball
above his head (namely, hiding
it in the Pauley pavillion gir
ders), he made two fakes, then
passed off backhand to Lucius
Allen, who came driving up a
completely empty lane for an
easy bucket. Lew and Lu re
peated the feat again for doubt
ing fans and two more UCLA
points.
With seven minutes to go.
UCLA cracked the 100 point
barrier. A few minutes later,
Alcindor departed to the noise
of a standing ovation and the
laurels of a 37 point perform
ance. A can of Oly for this god,
said I.
It was too bad for the Cards
—they met the Bruins at their
season's best, and quite possi
bly, at their best possible. Don
Griffin fired in 22 points in a
great competitive effort for the
losers.
Packers Are Chiefs
Finally, the finale for my
sports bloated weekend arrived.
It was the super-stupendous Su
per Bowl between the AFL
Chiefs and the NFL Packers. As
expected, the Packers won by a
good margin, 35-10, and became
chiefs of world football.
The key play in the game
came early in the second half
with the Packers holding a 14-
10 edge and the Chiefs playing
pretty good ball. Len Dawson,
the Chiefs quarterback, was
rushed and tried to throw off
balance. Willie Wood intercept
ed and raced to the Chiefs' five
before being tackled by Mike
Garrett.
Elijah Pitts cut over left
tackle for a TD to give the
Packers a 21-10 edge. From then
on, the Chiefs had to play catch
up football and the Packers
were able to rush Dawson with
abandon. The result was no of

fense for the Chiefs in the sec
ond half.
The major differences be
tween the two teams were in
the quality of their quarter
backs and defensive backs. Bart
Starr, Packers' QB and the out
standing player of the game,
was absolutely fantastic, mak
ing the right calls and putting
nearly every pass right where
he wanted it.
The Chiefs defensive backs
played the Packer receivers very

loosely and left the middle wide
open for Max McGee, who
caught two TD passes. The
Packer defenders were fooled
only twice, on play-action fakes
by Dawson which surprised
everyone on the vaunted Packer
defense.
Wait 'Til Next Year
The pre-game and halftime
shows were the best sports
spectacles that I have ever wit
nessed. The Grambling and Ari
zona bands formed the United

States, an eagle holding arrows
and olive branches, and the em
blem of the stars and stripes in
an America the Beautiful theme
that really overpowered me.
So super-Sunday has come
and gone, and amazingly, I'm
still alive. I've packed up my
gas mask and put it away until
next year, when I can return to
the smog capital of the world
for another Super-Bowl and
weekend of super-events In a
super sports spree.
