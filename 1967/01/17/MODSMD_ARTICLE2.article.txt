# Austria Center May Move To Vienna
## Walker, Adams Reported Investigating New Site Wunderbar 
### JAMES BRISCOE HENRY MULLER 
Stanford in Austria may soon move
to a new location in or near Vienna.
Director of Overseas Campuses
Robert A. Walker and University
Business Manager Dwight Adams are
presently in Europe looking into the
acquisition of a new campus, In
formed sources report.
Faculty members and students from
past Austria groups have expressed
considerable discontent over the rela
tive isolation of the present campus.
In a letter to The Daily, Professor
Lewis Spitz called the campus, "an
impossible location for attaining ef
fectively the educational objectives
for which the overseas program is de
signed." Spitz also said he did not
accept "that it is not possible to find
a suitable location within streetcar
distance of the inner city."
Walker replied by asking Spitz for
his suggestion on a location. Accord
ing to reports received from Austria
111 students, Spitz located a potential
site within walking distance of the
Opera House in Vienna. Spitz declined
to comment on the reports.
Three-Year Lease
Stanford has a three-year lease with
the Panhans Hotel, according to Vice-
Provost E. Howard Brooks. Austria I
left in September 1965, so it appears
that Stanford is committed to the
present location until September
1968. However, it has been reported
that the Panhans is dissatisfied with
the arrangement and has been trying
to break off the lease early.
Regular discussion on the lease will
probably begin by late spring or early
summer in any case.
Neither Dr. Paul Handley, Assist
ant Director of the Overseas Cam
puses, nor Bob Hamrdla, Assistant to
Dr. Walker, would comment on Walk
er's special trip or on the possibility
that the campus would be moved.
Walker is scheduled to return from
his trip sometime this weekend.
Bitter Complaints
Controversy over the location of the
campus broke when the Austria II
group complained bitterly about the
present site. One student told The
Daily last quarter, "the location of the

campus in a plush old hotel Is a ma
jor cause for the tension."
Students also complained of being
"cooped up" in The Semmering,
which one coed called "a one-street
town." They expressed disappoint
ment that The Semmering was a re
sort town and said the natives only
seemed interested in the tourist trade.
Spitz in his letter described the Aus
trian campus as a place "where there
is only a primitive level of native cul
ture and where the nearest stage,
concert hall, museum, parliament,
slum, library, or suitable churches
and synagogues are two hours away
by chartered bus and four hours
away by train."
Ski Country Vs. Vienna
"Is the University wise in establish
ing a campus in a resort hotel in ski
country far from the city of Vienna,
the cultural and political center of
this historic country?" he asked.
"Does this sort of enterprise help us
in our effort as scholars to combat
the reputation of 'play school'?"
"Nevertheless, something would be
wrong with students as intelligent as
ours if they were not profoundly dis
satisfied with their situation here,
when they consider how rich an ex
perience they might have in one of
Europe's greatest cultural centers, the
city of Vienna," he continued.
Walker stated in his reply that he
thought Spitz's conclusions might be
a bit premature. "Being within street
car distance of downtown Vienna
might not make all that much differ
ence on weekday nights," he said.
"Studies still take time."
He agreed, however, that distance
was a problem with the Semmering
location. "I have asked our Austrian
Directors to look into every cogent
possibility for new locations," he
wrote.


Informed sources report that Overseas Campus officials are considering Vienna
as a new location for Stanford in Austria. While the pastoral charms of The
Semmering would be sacrificed, the cultural attractions of the capital city,
such as the Burgtheater pictured above, would be more readily accessible.

his trip sometime this weekend.
Bitter Complaints
Controversy over the location of the
campus broke when the Austria II
group complained bitterly about the
present site. One student told The
Daily last quarter, "the location of the

campus in a plush old hotel Is a ma
jor cause for the tension."
Students also complained of being
"cooped up" in The Semmering,
which one coed called "a one-street
town." They expressed disappoint
ment that The Semmering was a re
sort town and said the natives only
seemed interested in the tourist trade.
Spitz in his letter described the Aus
trian campus as a place "where there
is only a primitive level of native cul
ture and where the nearest stage,
concert hall, museum, parliament,
slum, library, or suitable churches
and synagogues are two hours away
by chartered bus and four hours
away by train."
Ski Country Vs. Vienna
"Is the University wise in establish
ing a campus in a resort hotel in ski
country far from the city of Vienna,
the cultural and political center of
this historic country?" he asked.
"Does this sort of enterprise help us
in our effort as scholars to combat
the reputation of 'play school'?"
"Nevertheless, something would be
wrong with students as intelligent as
ours if they were not profoundly dis
satisfied with their situation here,
when they consider how rich an ex
perience they might have in one of
Europe's greatest cultural centers, the
city of Vienna," he continued.
Walker stated in his reply that he
thought Spitz's conclusions might be
a bit premature. "Being within street
car distance of downtown Vienna
might not make all that much differ
ence on weekday nights," he said.
"Studies still take time."
He agreed, however, that distance
was a problem with the Semmering
location. "I have asked our Austrian
Directors to look into every cogent
possibility for new locations," he
wrote.


Informed sources report that Overseas Campus officials are considering Vienna
as a new location for Stanford in Austria. While the pastoral charms of The
Semmering would be sacrificed, the cultural attractions of the capital city,
such as the Burgtheater pictured above, would be more readily accessible.
Stanford in Austria may soon move
to a new location in or near Vienna.
Director of Overseas Campuses
Robert A. Walker and University
Business Manager Dwight Adams are
presently in Europe looking into the
acquisition of a new campus, In
formed sources report.
Faculty members and students from
past Austria groups have expressed
considerable discontent over the rela
tive isolation of the present campus.
In a letter to The Daily, Professor
Lewis Spitz called the campus, "an
impossible location for attaining ef
fectively the educational objectives
for which the overseas program is de
signed." Spitz also said he did not
accept "that it is not possible to find
a suitable location within streetcar
distance of the inner city."
Walker replied by asking Spitz for
his suggestion on a location. Accord
ing to reports received from Austria
111 students, Spitz located a potential
site within walking distance of the
Opera House in Vienna. Spitz declined
to comment on the reports.
