Stanford's gymnasts defeated
Chico State College 139.15 to
122.60 and California Polytech
nic Institute 139.15 to 90.10 Sat
urday to make their season
mark 3-0.
Sophomore Jim Petersen pro
vided the Cards with their sole
first place. His 8.80 mark in the
long horse earned him a first in
that event. Petersen totaled
42.65 points as the Indians' all
around man.
Junior Rich Guess was the
second high point man with
23.70 points. His best event was
also the long horse where he
scored 8.50.
Indians Strong On Horse
Stanfords' strongest events
jvere the long horse, 24.45 points,
parallel bars, 22.75 points, and
floor exercise, 22.65 points.
Coach John Gilmore pointed
out that the scoring was lower
than last week's team score of
154.10 because the Indians
hissed more routines and that
the judging was much lower
than in Reno.
Friday at 7:30 the Cards will
have a meet with the freshman
team. Gilmore calls the meet
"an unveiling of a very good
freshman team."
Stanford has several fine
freshman gymnasts this year,
led by Craig Dickson, who per
formed very impressively in ex
hibition in Saturday's meet. He
will compete all-around Friday.
The Indians are looking for
ward to their meet with Cali
iornia at Berkeley on January
28. The Bears are currently one
of the top ten teams in the coun
try and are co-favorites with
USC for the conference title.
