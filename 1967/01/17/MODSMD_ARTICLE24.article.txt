## LBJ Faces Real Cost Of Vietnam 
### Walter Lippmann 
Working on his budget, the
President must be acutely aware
how true is the old saying that
- to govern is to choose. His
choices have become much more
painful.
Last year, when he was pre
paring his message on the State
,of the Union, he still dared to
believe that "this nation is
mighty enough, its society is
healthy enough, its people are
, strong enough to pursue our
• goals in the rest of the world
while still building a Great So
ciety at borne."
Goals At Home
Even then he knew that there
was some doubt about that proud
promise, and in the budget mes
sage which came 13 days later he
said, "even a prosperous nation
cannot meet all its goals at
once."
The question he is wrestling

with today is whether he can
achieve any of the goals he pro
claimed a year ago. He cannot
be at all sure that he can achieve
his goal in Vietnam, and he is
compelled to admit that he must
postpone indefinitely most of his
goals at home.
A year ago we were living in
a bouyant economy which at the
existing tax rates was counted
upon to produce very large rev
enues. These revenues provided
quite painlessly for the two wars
—the war in Vietnam which was
then on a smaller scale and was
expected to end rather soon and
the war on poverty. Because
these revenues have been so
much eaten up in order to pay
for the enlarged war in Vietnam,
the choices before the President
have become much sharper and
much more painful.
It now seems probable that the

President will not fight the two
wars simultaneously and that
his boasts and his promises a
year ago are to be laid aside.
Two Wars
Why can he not fight the two
wars simultaneously? Why can't
a country as rich as this one
deal with what is a small war
and also tend to its affairs at
home? Any statistician can pro
vide the figures to show that
the country can support both
wars if there is a small increase
of taxes —or a very large budg
etary deficit.
Most of the economists, with
a few notable dissenters, such
as Walter Heller and John Ken
neth Galbraith, are saying that
while taxes should have been
raised early this year it is dan
gerously late in the expansion
to raise them now.
According to the Morgan
Guaranty Survey, the gross na
tional product will show only
a small gain in the last quar
ter of 1966, perhaps as little as
2% in real terms. Even the sec
ond- and third-quarter gains
were modest, averaging 3%
when taken together.
Slow Expansion
There is thus a danger that
with such slow expansion the
growth of demand will not keep
pace with the growth of capaci
ty in the economy. To impose
higher taxes on an economy
which is slowing down might
bring on a recession.
The economists may well be
right. But the practical effect of
their advice is that the war on
poverty and urban blight must
in effect be suspended — unless
the President has the courage
to run big budgetary deficits.
As one who thought last year
that the President was deluding
himself about our ability to fight
the two wars, I have been ask
ing myself why a country which
is as rich as we are today should
feel itself compelled to econo
mize at the expense of its chil

dren and of its poor. There
exists, I have come to think,
some kind of rule which in a
democratic society limits what
the voters will stand for in the
way of sacrifices for the public
good—the public good which is
not immediately, obviously and
directly to their own personal
advantage.
Honeymoon Period
During President Johnson's
honeymoon period — say up to
the spring of 1965—a compara
tively small war in Vietnam and
the small beginnings of the war
against poverty were paid for
easily out of the revenues of our
expanding economy. Thus, the
poor were provided with tangi
ble small payments on large
promissory notes, and this gave
them hope and patience.
At the same time the well-to
do and the rich never had it so

good, and in addition they had
a fairly substantial hope that
they might be given another tax
cut with still better things to
come. These were the psycho
logical foundations of the John
son consensus, and under it the
conflicts between labor and capi
tal and between the races were
assuaged and tranquilized.
The real cost of the escalation
of the war in Vietnam is not
measured in dollars and cents.
The real cost is that the sur
pluses of an expanding economy
have been swallowed up, and
this has removed the lubricants
and the cushions against the
conflicts of interests and the ri
valry of ideologies. We are mov
ing more and more into sharp
and raw confrontations. This is
the tragic consequence of one
of the most serious miscalcula
tions in our history.
