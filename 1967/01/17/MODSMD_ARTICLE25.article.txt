## Hippie Bandwagon Rolls Into Town 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Boom-Boom-Boom. Beat the
drums and blow the trumpets
and let's all jump on the band
wagon and roll down into the
Haight-Ashbury with our neat
single-lens reflex cameras and
our groovy hip-huggers and
leathers. Hippism has arrived.
It appears to be becoming Stan
ford's newest totem.
Perhaps (who knows) it's not
too late to mention that beneath
all the gaudy publicity there
used to be some deeply disturb
ing issues, some profoundly un
comfortable questions. And so,
perhaps, someone said, after a
couple of years of distressing
confrontation, "Well, if we can't
lick em, let's assimilate them."
After all, it's the final answer
to the problem that many
straights face. They can simply
change their clothes a little, add
a few things to their vocabu
lary and Voila they're members
of the "Love" generation (after
all they look like it don't they).
Naturally, then, the more dis
tressing non-conformists simply
become errant and nothing new
to worry about.
These certainly look like the
tactics of a desperate man.

• Victory?
Editor, The Daily:
The 7-column headline in Mon
day's Daily "U.S. Wins on Drive
Through Communist Territory"
was rather misleading. "Enemy
losses" of "nearly 600 men," as
reported in the article, are hard
ly a reliable index of "win
ning". The first casualties of the
campaign in the Mekong Delta

were an unarmed young man
and woman walking hand in
hand, whom the Marines shot
at just in case. They were offi
cially recorded as "two VC who
had been sniping at Marine po
sitions" (Chronicle 1/9/67).
In my opinion deporting 10,-
000 people from their land, burn
ing their houses and putting
them behind barbed wire is not
much of a "victory" for the
United States.
Since ordinary newspaper cov
erage of the war is so spotty,
perhaps you could do the best
service to your readers by giv
ing weekly summaries of mili
tary action, political develop
ments, etc. — instead of print
ing one AP dispatch one day
and then nothing for the next
two or three days. A lot of peo
ple want to know what is really
going on in Vietnam. But most
newspaper articles give casual
ty figures, bombing statistics,
isolated details without ever re
lating them to the overall pat
tern of events.

• Taste Test
Editor, The DaUy:
ASSU President David Harris'
statements concerning President
Kerr and Governor Reagan
must strike many as being in
extremely poor taste. Few would
deny his privilege to express an
opinion concerning the pressing
problems facing the State and
its university. One might hope,
however, that he, as the elected
spokesman for the students of
Stanford University, would ex
press such opinion without
stooping to the crass disrespect

exhibited in referring to Presi
dent Kerr and Governor Reagan
as the "one-eyed against the
blind."
Cannot our right to question
and disagree still be exercised
with more effetciveness within
a framework of common, ordi
nary courtesy?

• Thanks Anyway
Editor, The Daily:
Regarding a front page article
in the Daily, Friday, January
13: thank you, but I am not
President of SDS.

• Boycott Now!
Editor, The Daily:
I have been denied service in
Stickney's twenty-four hour cof
fee shop twice during the past
two months evidently on the
grounds that I am a college stu
dent. In addition, I know one
Stanford student who was not
seated because of the length of
his hair and another who was
treated rudely because he was
wearing a peace button.
I would like to urge all mem
bers of the Stanford community
and Palo Alto to boycott this
restaurant. There is a "Den
ny's" twenty-four hour restau
rant one mile south where the
service is good and the food is
no more rotten or overpriced.

• Takes Two
Editor, The Daily:
I sympathize with the moral
stand taken by SDS on the draft.
But I would feel a lot better
about the whole thing if I could

see chapters of SDS springing
up at universities in, say, Ger
many or France or Indonesia
or China or Russia.
Unfortunately, there do exist
historical and sociological exam
ples which would indicate that
it doesn't always take two to
make enemies. This being so,
and the ancient game of For
eign Policy being what it is, I
don't see how it would be prac
ticable to abolish conscription in
only one country. Nor do I see
how a peace movement which
is not international can be really
effective.

• Real Story
Editor, The Dally:
Although many observations
regarding the objectionable be
havior of U.S. servicemen in
Vietnam are correct, I believe
that because of the failure to
note any of the pleasant inci
dents that occur each day be
tween American servicemen and
Vietnamese people, an unfair
and erroneous picture is pre
sented.
Particularly gratifying is the
serviceman's relations with Viet
namese children. The American
serviceman is the original, love
able, naive unsophisticate; he
laughs, frowns, whispers, yells,
tickles, chases. Parents know
that the younger children, at
least, are perfectly safe with
the soldiers, sailors, and ma
rines, and look with pleasure on
the fun-filled friendships that
spark with each meeting.
Although the American ser
viceman shines most in his re
lations with kids and girls, his

relations with all Vietnamese
are naturally easy and friendly.
Further, so intense is the indoc
trination of the newly-arrived
serviceman to impress on him
the importance of good behavior
as an American ambassador to
a foreign land, and so anxious
are many servicemen to make a
good impression, that much boi
sterous behavior that would
seem natural in the U.S. is re
frained from in Vietnam.
The many instances of good
relations, informal adoption of
orphans, volunteer work at or
phanages, etc., organized by
chaplains, off-hours medical
teams, volunteer English teach
ers at the Vietnamese-American
Association, and, most of all,
the daily, friendly, workaday re
lationships between thousands
of U.S. servicemen and Vietna
mese lead me to hope that more
people might write something
about that, too.
