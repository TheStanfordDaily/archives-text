# In Glass Houses
## Ignorance Proves Expensive 
### Robert E. Stone 
John Q. Stanford Student be
gins his daily drive to school
from his spartan off-campus
apartment and suddenly notices
that he needs gas. He pulls into
his favorite station and tells the
attendant to "fill it up." He
hands the attendant "Daddy's
credit card," signs the slip, and
pulls away in a mighty cloud of
dust.
The only thing wrong with
the above incident is that the
student has no idea what he is

paying for gas, a situation which
service station owners are very
happy about. Since the begin
ning of school this year gaso
line prices have risen two cents
(2c) on the gallon, and, accord
ing to local owners, is likely to
rise another two cents before
the end of the year.
Of the 12,000 students regis
tered at Stanford more than half
live off campus. Of these 4300
have been issued off-campus
parking permits by the Police

Department. This figure does
not include motorcycles. It. is
apparent that these 4300 stu
dents are at the mercy of the
gasoline stations for their means
of transportation to and from
classes.
Total Dependency
When the countless numbers
of faculty, staff, and on-campus
students are added to this num
ber, the almost total dependency
of a large part of the communi
ty upon the service of the local
gas stations becomes increasing
ly evident.
Local station owners are more
than willing to talk about how
the price of gasoline gets set,
and most of them attribute the
increases to rising costs and a
diminishing margin of profit. It
is interesting to note, however,
that the cost at the pump Is the
same for many stations through
out the Mid-Peninsula, regard
less of whether or not they give
trading stamps or have a big
money giveaway game.
Robert Pearson, manager of
the Shell station at Embarcadero
and W. Bayshore attributes the
sameness of prices to "the eco
nomic pressures of the market."
Phillip Bliss, manager of the
Phillips 66 station at Lytton and
High, believes that "the price is
generally the highest the traffic
will bear."
Stable Prices
Most managers hasten to point
out the fact that gas prices have
not risen since 1946, that in fact
they have declined and are just
now reaching the level that they
had been at the end of the war.
Station managers also point out
that while this fluctuation has
been going on in gas prices, the
cost of running a station has
more than doubled.
It is obvious that it is to the
benefit of the station owners to
maintain a standard price. Every
owner interviewed was bitter In
his condemnation of price wars,
commenting that they were
usually started by small "ma
verick" stations. Bliss added
that "as soon as the majors no
tice that a lower price on the
part of a maverick is eating into
their gallonage, they will meet
his price. Then the small sta
tion lowers again, then the ma
jors, until the small station is
losing more than he is making
from his increased gallonage."
Gas Wars
There is no argument that gas
oline price wars are detrimen
tal to the individual station own
ers, but the statement that the
price at the pump is established
by the pressures of the market
and the fact that stations vary
both in volume and size has
raised questions in many peo
ple's minds about whether the
price of gas reflects anything
more than the desire of the local
owners to make money.
Last October 10th there was a
meeting of local owners in San
Jose. Bliss said that the owners
got together to protect them
selves from going out of busi
ness and that the meeting was
the result of "a spontaneous up
rising on the part of the local
dealers." The next day gas prices
were raised.
To many, especially one San
Jose newspaper, it appeared as
if the local owners had "agreed
among themselves" to raise the
price of gas. The Justice Depart
ment with its traditional fervor
descended upon the local own
ers. According to Bliss, "They
told me that we were little guys
and they didn't want to hurt us,
but that we could break the law
too."
Obligation
According to Edward Zimmer
man, a deputy in the anti-trust
division of the Department and
a former professor at the Stan
ford Law School, the investiga
tion is still going on. He said,
"I cannot give you any more
information than that because
we have an obligation to those
people who are being investi
gated."
It appears that there is more
to the method in which gas
prices are set than meets the

eye, but any condemnation of
the men setting the prices will
have to await the results of the
Justice Department's investiga
tion.
Uniformity
Until such time it is safe to
assume that gas prices in the
Mid-Peninsula will continue to
rise and will continue to be uni
form. There are some stations
which will not go along with the
uniformity, in fact some which
do not go along with it now,
something which in itself adds
fuel to the fire many people are
willing to use to cook the local
owners.
Pearson comments, however,
that he sees no indication that
the public will arise as they did
recently over the prices in the
grocery chains. The local own
ers all plead complete innocence
to any suggestion of price fix
ing or collusion in an attempt
to eliminate more competition.
For those who believe the con
trary, a day in court is coming.
For John Q. Stanford Studentâ€”
well he will keep using "Daddy's
credit card" and continue in the
ignorance of the very real price
he is paying for gasoline.
