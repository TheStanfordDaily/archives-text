# RYAN NAMED DEAN
## Faculty Debates Admission Policy 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
Undergraduate admission policies
were reviewed at a meeting yesterday
of the faculty of the School of Hu
manities and Sciences in the Physics
Lecture Hall.
At the meeting, unprecedented in
university history, Professor Law
rence V. Ryan of the English De-

partment was also announced as as
sociate dean of the School.
The meeting brought together over
100 of the 420 Humanities and Scien
ces faculty members.
Albert J. Guerard, Professor of En
glish, and Keith Boyle, Assistant Pro
fessor of Art, presented their view
points of the current university re
cruiting policies. Both examined the
problems of forming a student body
of creativity and diversity.
Although no specific issues were
raised at the meeting, many questions
jn admissions procedures were raised

by faculty members. A special three
man committee will be set up to ex
amine the details and report to the
group at its next meeting of February
13.
Ryan
Ryan, who takes office on April 4,
succeeds Professor Richard Lyman,
recently named university provost. In
addition to the new administrative
duties, Professor Ryan will continue
to teach.
Ryan has served as director of
freshman English, and has been direc
tor of the graduate program in the
humanities since 1958.
The Humanities and Sciences meet
ings were inaugurated because "fac
ulty members are unable to express

their opinions," according to Robert
R. Sears, Dean of the School. "We are
opening an avenue for discussion. We
will explore various educational prob
lems in order to make positive recom
mendations."
No Votes
No votes were taken at the meeting.
Dean Sears does not plan any votes,
unless a consensus is called for at
future meetings. A discussion of
overseas campus operation is already
planned for the February 13 forum.
Attendance was far better yesterday
than at an Academic Council meeting
last week.
The new group was formed from a
proposal last spring by Ryan. A steer
ing committee, headed by Professor

Claude Simpson of the English De
partment, arranged the program. Per
manent officers will be named at a
later meeting.
The meeting, open to all Humani
ties and Sciences full-time faculty and
Academic Council members, was de
signed "to stimulate expression of
faculty views and encourage consulta
tion across normal departmental
lines," according to Dean Sears.
This faculty group is similar in pur
pose to the committee on appoint
ments and promotions, another infor
mal group whose recommendations
have carried great weight in the past.
Dean Sears hopes that the new Hu
manities and Sciences forum will
eventually be in the some position.
