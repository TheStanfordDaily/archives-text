# U Of Washington Dean Suggests Coeds Choose Their Own Hours
## 
### 
Social regulations are on the way
out at the University of Washington.
Donald K. Anderson, Dean of Stu
dents at the Seattle campus, proposed
soon after Christmas that all hours
regulations be set by individual dorms
and sororities. The move came as a
surprise to everyone, although stu
dents had submitted a slightly more
restrictive plan last May.
Ninety per cent of all women living
in University housing voted on the
Dean's proposal last week and ap
proved it by a vote of about 3000-300.
A student-faculty advisory commit
tee recommended the new rules to the
administration after intensive study
of a proposal submitted by the Asso
ciated Women Students last spring.
The proposal asked that all upper
class women with parental permis
sion have no hours regulations.
The committee decided to extend its
recommendation to freshmen and re
move the necessity of obtaining par
ental permission.
The advisory committee's report
stated, in part, that 'The University
does not stand 'in loco parentis' to its
students.
"The University in many other
areas has supported the fundamental
proposition that undergraduates are
to be treated as adults, capable of
regulating their own hours.
"The regulation of women's hours
is, essentially, a matter of security
rather than morality. We propose to
put the burden of self-regulation
squarely on the individual woman
student."
The regulations could go into effect

anytime after approval by University
President Charles Odegaard, who is
presently in Washington, D.C.
It is uncertain exactly what action
will be taken once the new rules go
into effect, but informed sources at
Washington said yesterday that most
dormitories would probably abolish
regulations and at least some of the
sororities would.
UCLA is currently the only large

state university with no hours regula
tions. The new policy went into effect
earlier this month, although for the
remainder of the academic year bed
checks will be made for daughters
whose parents request them.
Current University of Washington
social regulations are too complicated
to be understood by a layman, but
appear to be slightly more restrictive
than Stanford's.
