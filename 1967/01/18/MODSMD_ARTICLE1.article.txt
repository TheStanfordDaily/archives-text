# Governor Answers Criticism
## 
### JERRY RANKIN Associated Press Writer 
Governor Ronald Reagan accused
top state university and college of
ficials yesterday of needlessly frighten
ing parents and students by "precipi
tate and unwarranted" barring of new
students in reaction to his economy
drive.
The Republican chief executive made
clear his dissatisfaction with those
who have strongly criticized his cost
cutting campaign.
He didn't mention them by name,
but Reagan clearly referred to Uni
versity of California President Clark
Kerr and college system Chancellor
Glenn S. Dumke.
Both men have temporarily halted
admissions for the next school year
until they find out just what Reagan's
demands for economies will do to
their capacity to handle new students.
Reagan's comments came at his sec
ond formal news conference as gov
ernor.
He opened the news conference by
reading a two-page statement reacting
to criticism of his economy drive in
education, which has seen him hanged
in effigy at three college campuses. He
said:
"Students and parents of students
have been unnecessarily disturbed and
even frightened by the university's
precipitate and unwarranted freeze on
applications. I have called this ac
tion unwarranted and I believe it is
completely so."
Asked if his comments also applied
to the colleges, he answered with a
strong "yes."
Reagan, who has ordered an across
the-board 10 per cent cut in state gov
ernment, said "there is no way" educa
tion could be exempted.
