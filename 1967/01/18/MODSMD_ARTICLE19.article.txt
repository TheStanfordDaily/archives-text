# English Prof Publishes First Novel
## 
### 
New to the Stanford faculty is
Jay Neugeboren. He is also new
to the world of writing, having
recently published his first novel,
Big Man.
Big Man focuses in on Mack
Davie, All-American Negro bas
ketball star, five years after being
caught in the point-fixing scan
dals of 1951.
The Kansas City Star termed
this short novel (213 pages) "the
finest novel yet written about a
basketball player . . . with this
first novel, Jay Neugeboren joins
the surprisingly tiny company
of fiction writers who have cap
tured the essence of the athlete
as a human being."
Neugeboren emphasizes that
the novel is more than a sports
story. Time Magazine agrees:
"Neugeboren illuminates one of
the great and terrible questions
of life: 'What happens when you
can't do the thing you love?' "
Twenty-eight-year-old Neuge
boren is a native of Brooklyn
and a graduate of Columbia Col
lege. He received an M.A. at In
diana University in 1963. Since
1959, his stories and articles
have appeared in Commentary,
Commonweal, The New Repub
lic, and other magazines. His
story "The Application" was in
cluded in The Best American
Short Stories 1965.
Neugeborn and his wife moved
from Columbia, where he was
teaching English, to join the
Stanford faculty last quarter.
Big Man has been com Dared to
The Million Dollar Misunder
standing "in style and point of
view" by the New York Times.
"The charactristics and bitter
humor rival Lardner's work,"
writes Clyde Bolton in the Birm
ingham (Ala.) News, "but the
people are more real than Run
yan's."
Albert Guerard of the English
Department says,"It is worthy
to be read with Rabbit Run."
Big Man is published by
Houghton Mifflin for $3.95. It is
on sale at the Stanford Book
store.
