# Stanford Sequoia Offers Poems, Stories, Essay
## 
### ROBERT WESTON 
Sequoia, the Stanford Literary Mag
azine, in a handsome edition, offers
three poems, two stories and a long
critical essay. The poems are the
strongest points of the issue. The best,
"The Man Who Sang the Songs He
Wrote" by Tom Maxeiner, uses the
vehicle of the artist and his songs to
pose the general predicament of any
one who would understand a world
which "breeds chaos, but neither type
nor kind." The songs bring order to
this chaos and become life itself;
But if the music fails? Then
you must bear
Your artifical world with
your despair.
Gordon Fain's "A Prayer" is a moving
statement of the anxiety with which
we all ponder the ultimate value of
our accomplishments.
For contrast, we have Jack Suther
land's free verse, neo-imagistic poem,
"After William Carlos Williams." The
problem with this poem is that it is
after Williams, quite a bit after, and
remains at best a semi-successful imi
tation. A valuable exercise, no doubt;
but stuff for a literary magazine?
I find both stories rather unfortu
nate. The fact that they have both re
ceived literary prizes at Stanford is
even more disturbing. "Walk in the
Sun" by Jay Glen Marks, Jr. at
tempts, I suppose, through clever
irony to make us feel sorry for a
poor clod who thinks war is a game
and who joins the Marines to play
it. Though the situation is potentially
pathetic, Morse Gerald Cavender lacks
any qualities which might encourage
the reader to take him and his plight
seriously. One is forced to decide be
tween seeing Morse as simply a fool

or just an idiot. It's very difficult to
feel sorry for a character who can
say to his girlfriend "I performed
badly tonight. Forgive me," and who
has a girlfriend who replies "We can't
hit it off every night."
Scott Donahey's "A Time of the
Flesh" is a vaguely pornographic story
about a young man who suffers from
guilt because he has a girl friend who
apparently loves him, while he feels
deep down that she is nothing more
than "a nice piece." He can't admit
this, however, and tries to convince
himself that "There was something
there, something more, something." Of
course he can't and his guilt is pro
jected onto her, whom he abuses for
being a "common slut." Donahey fails
to bring off this potentially rich situa
tion largely because of his language,
which is a blend of romantic cliches
and awkwardly slick attempts to avoid
cliches.
The long essay by Tom Maxeiner
(the first of two dealing with the
poetry of Yvor Winters) is a very in
formative study of Winters' early
poetry. Though based primarily on the
poems selected for The Collected
Poems, Maxeiner's study is quite time
ly in light of the recent publication of
The Early Poems of Yvor Winters.
The classification and interpretation of
these early poems as "solipsistic" and
"nominalistic" is faithful to the poet's
own reflective understanding of his
work and provides an excellent start
ing place for dealing with Winters'
poetry. Though perhaps of prime in
terest to students of Modern Ameri
can poetry, the information contained
in this essay is quite valuable and I
am happy to see it made so pleasantly
available.

guilt because he has a girl friend who
apparently loves him, while he feels
deep down that she is nothing more
than "a nice piece." He can't admit
this, however, and tries to convince
himself that "There was something
there, something more, something." Of
course he can't and his guilt is pro
jected onto her, whom he abuses for
being a "common slut." Donahey fails
to bring off this potentially rich situa
tion largely because of his language,
which is a blend of romantic cliches
and awkwardly slick attempts to avoid
cliches.
The long essay by Tom Maxeiner
(the first of two dealing with the
poetry of Yvor Winters) is a very in
formative study of Winters' early
poetry. Though based primarily on the
poems selected for The Collected
Poems, Maxeiner's study is quite time
ly in light of the recent publication of
The Early Poems of Yvor Winters.
The classification and interpretation of
these early poems as "solipsistic" and
"nominalistic" is faithful to the poet's
own reflective understanding of his
work and provides an excellent start
ing place for dealing with Winters'
poetry. Though perhaps of prime in
terest to students of Modern Ameri
can poetry, the information contained
in this essay is quite valuable and I
am happy to see it made so pleasantly
available.
Sequoia, the Stanford Literary Mag
azine, in a handsome edition, offers
three poems, two stories and a long
critical essay. The poems are the
strongest points of the issue. The best,
"The Man Who Sang the Songs He
Wrote" by Tom Maxeiner, uses the
vehicle of the artist and his songs to
pose the general predicament of any
one who would understand a world
which "breeds chaos, but neither type
nor kind." The songs bring order to
this chaos and become life itself;
But if the music fails? Then
you must bear
Your artifical world with
your despair.
Gordon Fain's "A Prayer" is a moving
statement of the anxiety with which
we all ponder the ultimate value of
our accomplishments.
For contrast, we have Jack Suther
land's free verse, neo-imagistic poem,
"After William Carlos Williams." The
problem with this poem is that it is
after Williams, quite a bit after, and
remains at best a semi-successful imi
tation. A valuable exercise, no doubt;
but stuff for a literary magazine?
I find both stories rather unfortu
nate. The fact that they have both re
ceived literary prizes at Stanford is
even more disturbing. "Walk in the
Sun" by Jay Glen Marks, Jr. at
tempts, I suppose, through clever
irony to make us feel sorry for a
poor clod who thinks war is a game
and who joins the Marines to play
it. Though the situation is potentially
pathetic, Morse Gerald Cavender lacks
any qualities which might encourage
the reader to take him and his plight
seriously. One is forced to decide be
tween seeing Morse as simply a fool

or just an idiot. It's very difficult to
feel sorry for a character who can
say to his girlfriend "I performed
badly tonight. Forgive me," and who
has a girlfriend who replies "We can't
hit it off every night."
Scott Donahey's "A Time of the
Flesh" is a vaguely pornographic story
about a young man who suffers from
guilt because he has a girl friend who
apparently loves him, while he feels
deep down that she is nothing more
than "a nice piece." He can't admit
this, however, and tries to convince
himself that "There was something
there, something more, something." Of
