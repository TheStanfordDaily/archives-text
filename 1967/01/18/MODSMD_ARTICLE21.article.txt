# Go, Gruber, Go!

### STEVE GRUBER 
Steve Gruber's magic will re
turn to the airwaves Saturday
night.
Gruber's show starts at 8 p.m.
and will be broadcast by the
campus radio station, KZSU
(800 AM and 90.1 FM). This is
Gruber's second radio show on
KZSU.
The program will consist of
selections from the top 30 and
other such rot, but Gruber's
special mystery guests are ex
pected to outweigh most of the
disadvantages.
Here's a few hints about this
Saturday's guest: He lives off
campus, he recently gave up
smoking, and his car has Vir
ginia license plates, although
he lives in Connecticut. Who is
he???
