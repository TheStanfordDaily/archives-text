# A 						Vote Of Confidence
## 
### 
We are very much encouraged by President
Sterling's frank expression of confidence in the
Stanford undergraduate in his address to the
Stanford Mothers' Club. Acknowledging stu
dents' need to "test old and new premises" in
their search for identity and purpose, he told
the ladies of his strong belief that today's under
graduates can weather the problems of self
development with no less success than their
predecessors.
However, the President did not exclude
the University as a source of assistance in the
"testing" process. In many respects the Presi
dent's remarks reflected Nevit Sanford's con
cept of the ideal university which challenges
the student and assists him in solving the chal
lenges.
The tone of the President's remarks on open
house regulations seemed to indicate his ac
ceptance of the Committee of Fifteen proposal.
He candidly asked the ladies if they had any
cause for loss of confidence in their son or
daughter to exercise wisely the local option,
which would allow individual residences to set
their own open house hours. The President
did not indicate that local option and liberal
ized open house policy have yet to be con
sidered by the Board of Trustees, and his re
marks must be taken as a trial balloon for the
stiff battle which the issue is likely to face
when it is presented to the Board.
President Sterling voiced reserved confidence
in the contribution that students will make to
the general study of curriculum now underway.

Although he questioned students' ability to dis
cern short-lived "instant meaningfulness" from
lasting benefits in the search for relevant cur
riculum, he pledged that the University would
employ students "fully and actively" in the
study.
The President also touched upon structural
difficulties developing suitable interaction of
students, faculty and University officials in solv
ing educational and policy problems. The ques
tion of student input in the present University
structure is mired by conflicting committee juris
dictions and conflicting assumptions in those
bodies which do cut across jurisdictional lines.
A case in point is the Committee of Fifteen
whose three constituencies no longer share the
same set of assumptions ,and in fact, some mem
bers are in open difference with the explicit as
sumptions of the founding document. While the
search for new structures will be one of the
major concerns of the general reevaluation, we
believe the role of students in the study must be
an effective precursor of the part they are to
play in the final form of a three constituency
body.
In de-emphasizing the novelty of student in
terest in governing their own lives before the
Mothers' Club, the President allayed the worries
and reaction which the mass media have en
couraged. At the same time President Sterling's
address, coming after a year and a half of in
tense student concern, is a pledge that the Uni
versity itself is now committed to action and
not reaction.
