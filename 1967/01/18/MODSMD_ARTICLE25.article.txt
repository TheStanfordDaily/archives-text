Americans have been subject
ed to so much football on tele
vision this season that it's very
difficult for any of us to look at
anything except in football
terms. I couldn't help thinking
as I watched President John
son deliver his State of the
Union speech last week how it
would have been reported by two
football commentators.
"Good evening, folks. Welcome
to the Credibility Bowl, another
wonderful State of the Union
classic between the Great Society
Longhorns and the hardhitting
American Solons, who haven't
won a contest against the Great
Society team in three years.
"The backfield for the Great
Society team is the same as
last year. At quarterback for his
third year is Lyndon B. Johnson,
at fullback Lnydon B. Johnson,
at halfback Lyndon B. Johnson
and at flanker Lyndon B. John
son. The line is composed of
the famed seven blocks of Lyn
don.
"The Solons are fielding a
strong defensive team of Repub
licans and Southern conserva

tives this year and are expected
to give Great Society some seri
ous opposition.
"Great Society has won the toss
and team captain Lyndon B.
Johnson has elected to kick off
and receive at the same time.
"Quarterback Johnson comes
out of the huddle, takes the snap
from center and hands off the
ball to the fullback who hits the
line for no gain. Halfback John
son tries a run around end, but
the rugged Solon line is holding
and once again Great Society
shows no appreciable gain. It's
third down and long yardage.
The quarterback rolls out to
throw a long pass about taxes,
but it's incomplete and Great So
ciety may have to kick.
Time Out Talk
"It's time out on the field, and
seated next to me is one of the
great experts of the Credibility
Bowl classic, Asa Blotnik. Asa,
how does the game look to you?"
"Well, Paul, these are two
tough teams, and I think we're
going to see quite a contest be
fore it's over. Great Society had
many injuries last November, if

you recall, and I believe we're
seeing the results of it here to
night. I notice that Coach John
son has decided not to try too
many tricks, and he seems to be
more interested in consolidating
his gains rather than trying any
new plays.
"I talked to him just before
game time, and he told me his
team was in the greatest shape
he had ever seen it. He pointed
out they had made more yard
age in the last three years than
any previous coach had made in
the last 20.
Needs Rooters
"But he said this year was the
time for testing, and if he didn't
get support from the fans, his
past victories would have little
meaning."
"'Asa, where do you think
Great Society is the weakest?"
"I would say in the calling of
the signals. The quarterback
calls one play and then they run
another. Also, if you recall, a
few years ago Coach Johnson
said he was going to concentrate
on a ground attack. But lately
he's been taking more and more

to the air, and his strategy does
n't seem to be producing any re
sults. Another thing that seems
to be hurting Great Society is
that many of the first stringers
on the team are leaving or have
left, and Coach Johnson is hav
ing trouble trying to fill the
positions. He seems weak in re
serves."
"What about the American
Solons?"
Forced To Punt
"Well, you know they're al
ways playing to the grandstands,
and it seems this is the first year
they feel they have a chance of
holding the Great Society team
down. As a matter of fact, this is
the first time in the history of
the game that Johnson's team
has been forced to punt."
"Thanks, Asa, and now let's
go back to the playing field.
While we were talking, folks,
there was an announcement
over the loudspeaker that defen
sive back Adam Clayton Powell
has just been kicked off the field
for clipping and will be benched
by the Solons for the rest of
the season."

"Well, Paul, these are two
tough teams, and I think we're
going to see quite a contest be
fore it's over. Great Society had
many injuries last November, if

you recall, and I believe we're
seeing the results of it here to
night. I notice that Coach John
son has decided not to try too
many tricks, and he seems to be
more interested in consolidating
his gains rather than trying any
new plays.
"I talked to him just before
game time, and he told me his
team was in the greatest shape
he had ever seen it. He pointed
out they had made more yard
age in the last three years than
any previous coach had made in
the last 20.
Needs Rooters
"But he said this year was the
time for testing, and if he didn't
get support from the fans, his
past victories would have little
meaning."
"'Asa, where do you think
Great Society is the weakest?"
"I would say in the calling of
the signals. The quarterback
calls one play and then they run
another. Also, if you recall, a
few years ago Coach Johnson
said he was going to concentrate
on a ground attack. But lately
he's been taking more and more

to the air, and his strategy does
n't seem to be producing any re
sults. Another thing that seems
to be hurting Great Society is
that many of the first stringers
on the team are leaving or have
left, and Coach Johnson is hav
ing trouble trying to fill the
positions. He seems weak in re
serves."
"What about the American
Solons?"
Forced To Punt
"Well, you know they're al
ways playing to the grandstands,
and it seems this is the first year
they feel they have a chance of
holding the Great Society team
down. As a matter of fact, this is
the first time in the history of
the game that Johnson's team
has been forced to punt."
"Thanks, Asa, and now let's
go back to the playing field.

there was an announcement
over the loudspeaker that defen

has just been kicked off the field
for clipping and will be benched

"Thanks, Asa, and now let's
go back to the playing field.
While we were talking, folks,
there was an announcement
over the loudspeaker that defen
sive back Adam Clayton Powell
has just been kicked off the field
for clipping and will be benched
by the Solons for the rest of
the season."
Americans have been subject
ed to so much football on tele
vision this season that it's very
difficult for any of us to look at
anything except in football
terms. I couldn't help thinking
as I watched President John
son deliver his State of the
Union speech last week how it
would have been reported by two
football commentators.
"Good evening, folks. Welcome
to the Credibility Bowl, another
wonderful State of the Union
classic between the Great Society
Longhorns and the hardhitting
American Solons, who haven't
won a contest against the Great
Society team in three years.
"The backfield for the Great
Society team is the same as
last year. At quarterback for his
third year is Lyndon B. Johnson,
at fullback Lnydon B. Johnson,
at halfback Lyndon B. Johnson
and at flanker Lyndon B. John
son. The line is composed of
the famed seven blocks of Lyn
don.
"The Solons are fielding a
strong defensive team of Repub
licans and Southern conserva

tives this year and are expected
to give Great Society some seri
ous opposition.
"Great Society has won the toss
and team captain Lyndon B.
Johnson has elected to kick off
and receive at the same time.
"Quarterback Johnson comes
out of the huddle, takes the snap
from center and hands off the
ball to the fullback who hits the
line for no gain. Halfback John
son tries a run around end, but
the rugged Solon line is holding
and once again Great Society
shows no appreciable gain. It's
third down and long yardage.
The quarterback rolls out to
throw a long pass about taxes,
but it's incomplete and Great So
ciety may have to kick.
Time Out Talk
"It's time out on the field, and
seated next to me is one of the
great experts of the Credibility
Bowl classic, Asa Blotnik. Asa,
how does the game look to you?"
"Well, Paul, these are two
tough teams, and I think we're
going to see quite a contest be
fore it's over. Great Society had
many injuries last November, if

you recall, and I believe we're
seeing the results of it here to
night. I notice that Coach John
son has decided not to try too
many tricks, and he seems to be
more interested in consolidating
his gains rather than trying any
new plays.
"I talked to him just before
game time, and he told me his
team was in the greatest shape
he had ever seen it. He pointed
out they had made more yard
age in the last three years than
any previous coach had made in
the last 20.
Needs Rooters
"But he said this year was the
time for testing, and if he didn't
get support from the fans, his
past victories would have little
meaning."
"'Asa, where do you think
Great Society is the weakest?"
"I would say in the calling of
the signals. The quarterback
calls one play and then they run
another. Also, if you recall, a
few years ago Coach Johnson
said he was going to concentrate
on a ground attack. But lately
he's been taking more and more

to the air, and his strategy does
n't seem to be producing any re
sults. Another thing that seems
to be hurting Great Society is
that many of the first stringers
on the team are leaving or have
left, and Coach Johnson is hav
ing trouble trying to fill the
positions. He seems weak in re
serves."
"What about the American
Solons?"
Forced To Punt
"Well, you know they're al
ways playing to the grandstands,
and it seems this is the first year
they feel they have a chance of
holding the Great Society team
down. As a matter of fact, this is
the first time in the history of
the game that Johnson's team
has been forced to punt."
"Thanks, Asa, and now let's
go back to the playing field.
While we were talking, folks,
there was an announcement
over the loudspeaker that defen
sive back Adam Clayton Powell
has just been kicked off the field
for clipping and will be benched
by the Solons for the rest of
the season."
