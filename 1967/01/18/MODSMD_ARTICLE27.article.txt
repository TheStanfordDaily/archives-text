## Shockley Illogical In Social Thought 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
There is always something
tragic about a situation in which
a person honored for his achieve
ments in one type of endeavor
proceeds to dishonor himself in
another. We have a recent ex
ample of this in the case of Mr.
William Shockley, a skilled tech
nician and Nobel laureate, who
lends the weight of his reputa
tion to a type of thinking which
represents the antithesis of sci
ence.
Mr. Shockley is surely right in
asserting that we need to know
more about the relative effects
of heredity and environment on
human attributes and behavior,
and one can only applaud him
when he calls for more research.
But when, as in his recent ad
dress to the Commonwealth Club
of San Francisco, he charges
that gaps in our knowledge are
to be attributed to a liberal con
spiracy among social and biolog
ical scientists he forsakes the
language of reasoned discourse.
He further compounds his er
rors of logic when he assumes
that scientific data prove the
inferiority of certain racial
groups. This contradicts not only
the preponderance of available
evidence, but also his own de
mand for further research to dis

cover the truth in the matter.
And when he calls for changes
in social and educational policies
to confrom to his unsubstanti
ated beliefs, Mr. Shockley adds
his name to an unsavory line
age of pseudo-scientists, such as
Count Gobineau, H. S. Chamber
lain, Alfred Rosenberg, Stefan
Possony, and Nathaniel Weyl.
The crowning touch of illog
ical thinking is found in Mr.
Shockley's call for an end of pro
grams to help underpriviledged
racial groups achieve a decent
standard of living; he believes
that such programs encourage
reproduction by those he deems
unfit. Yet the evidence clearly
indicates that it is middle in
come groups who are most likely
to limit the size of their families;
hence if Mr. Shockley really be
lieves his own unproven theories,
he should vigorously support
public and private efforts to abol
ish poverty in America.
Yet in the final analysis Mr.
Shockley may unwittingly have
provided some evidence that en
vironment may have a weak ef
fect on human behavior. A per
son placed in a decent, humane
and intellectual environment
such as Stanford University
may not reflect these qualities in
his behavior; he may instead re
sort to slander and name-calling
against his colleagues in the en
terprise of science, while becom
ing a sycophant, pandering to the
least enlightened elements in the
larger community.

â€¢ Axe Falls Again
Editor, The Daily:
I was amazed by the chauvin
ism displayed so openly by David
Harris on White Memorial Plaza.
What has my generation of "un
common men" and "proud in
dividualism" come to when an
avowed proponent of the move
ment consents, yes, even asks to
serve several years in (of all
places) prison for the United
States.
When the mere symptoms of
decadence, the artifacts of ugli
ness, negate geographical, ideo
logical and popular beauty, such
nationalistic zeal is frighteningly
fuzzy thinking.
Yes, Dave Harris, there is in
deed an Uncle Sam and he runs
a whole chain of social security
outlets from Fort Ord to San
Quentin. He assures Everyman
freedom of choice. Both G.I. Joe
and David Harris can relate to
their fellow man in a way
uniquely effective on each of
their respective levels.
G.I. Joe likes the view down
a gun barrel and a few prefer
relating through prison bars.
The "Great Society" thought
fully provides for both elements.
Who knows, there may even be
another choice and another level
of perspective.
I surrender the privilege, in
deed, the duty, to David Harris
and Timothy Leary to turn on
their fellow inmates and their
wardens. JOHN HARPER
