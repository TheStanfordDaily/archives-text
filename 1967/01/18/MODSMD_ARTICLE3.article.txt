# T.A.'s Discuss Possibility Of Organizing A Union
## 
### WILLIAMSON EVERS 
A group of teaching assistants, re
search assistants, and graduate stu
dents met yesterday to discuss work
ing conditions for graduate students at
Stanford.
The meeting was held in the hope of
perhaps setting up an organizational
unit which would improve communi
cation, discussion, and implementation
of ideas on T. A. working conditions.
The meeting was chaired by Steve
Smith from the Political Science De
partment. He introduced Brian Mulo
ney of the Berkeley teaching assist
ants' union (a local of the American
Federation of Teachers), who outlined
the facts about the Berkeley organiza
tion.
The Berkeley teaching assistants'
union resulted from the teaching as
sistant strike in December of 1964. At
that time many T. A.'s decided to mold
a permanent organization. Presently
the Berkeley union has 535 members,
Including 350 out of the 980 T. A.'s.
John Shippee from the Political Sci
ence Department made this statement:

"I believe that a union for working
graduate students and open to others
would benefit the Stanford graduate
community in a number of ways. It
would provide a nucleus of organiza
tion and channel of communication
for graduate student concerns in eco
nomic and other areas.
"Further, it can bring out concerns
which are not fully articulated among
graduate students. These include the
fact that salaries for research assis
tants are tax-free, where T.A. salaries
are not."
Additional Problems
Another problem raised by Shippee
is the wide discrepancy among de
partments in the salaries paid re
search assistants. Job tenure in some
departments may also be a problem.
Another involves the residence re
quirement for the Ph.D. degree. A
union organization will provide a
forum for graduate opinion on issues
of concern, such as the relationship
of the university and the Selective
Service System (especially, in terms
of grades).
