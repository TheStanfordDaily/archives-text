# ANTI-DRAFT UNION
## Group To Oppose Draft 
### STEVE GRUBER 
The local chapter of the Students
for a Democratic Society (SDS) voted
last night to form an anti-draft union.
The statement adopted by the group
was "We oppose the Draft because it
is a coercive and intimidating way by
which a government is able to effect
foreign and domestic policies against
the interests of its citizens." The

statement is intended to form the basis
of the group.
The anti-draft union may take up
other programs, some of which could
specifically oppose fighting in Viet
nam.
The group was discussing one of
these programs—to ask the University
to stop ranking students for draft
boards—at the time The Daily went to
press last night.
The discussion about the shape the
anti-draft union would take centered
around whether it should come out
against conscription or conscription
for the war in Vietnam.
Opponents of conscription for the
war in Vietnam said that the union
should be tried to a specific issue. The
draft is meaningless during peacetime,
they argued.

Others present maintained that it
was possible to be against the draft
as an institution, yet still be willing
to volunteer for the armed services.
Not Tied To Vietnam
While most of the participants
agreed that they would not serve
in Vietnam, they felt that tying the
anti-draft union to this issue would
devalue it. The group will oppose mili
tary conscription regardless of wheth
er the Vietnam war continues.
The statement adopted by the anti
draft union was revision of an earlier
statement written by chairman Marc
Sapir. In its original form, the state
ment said that the group specifically
would not "go to Vietnam in the U.S.
military."
The meeting was attended by ap
proximately 40 people.
