# Sterling's Address Cites Depth Of Student Concern
## 
### JIM SELNA Editor 
President Wallace Sterling yester
day told the Stanford Mothers' Club
intense student interest in governing
their own lives has always existed,
and parents should not expect it to
"go away."
"There appears to be apprehension
that today's students are going to take
themselves to the dogs by route of
self-indulgence," Sterling said.
However, Sterling reassured the
ladies, "I have not seen evidence that
there is a higher proportion of Stan
ford students disposed to such self
indulgence than heretofore."
Testing Premises
Given the new found freedom of the
college environment, he said it was
not surprising to find students "test
ing this or that premise," as they
reached for self-identity and purpose.
He reminded the ladies that "the
premises to be tested change with
changing times and knowledge."

"I do not want to appear defensive
about the role the college or univer
sity can play in assisting and guiding
the student who tests old and new
premises because I believe this role is
important," the President noted.
But Sterling went on to ask parents
"bluntly" what they had done or not
done that "would shake their confi
dence in the ability of their children
to cope with problems of self-develop
ment."
Evoking Interest
Looking at current issues, the Presi
dent cited the OFF campaign and open
house policy as "two matters which
will, I expect, evoke parental and
alumni interest."
Sterling spoke directly of the pro
posed open house changes, advocated
by the Committee of Fifteen in a re
port made public at the beginning of
the quarter. He described the pro
posed "local option" which would al
low each residence to set its own open
house hours, within certain bounds,
by a secret ballot."
He again spoke frankly to the moth
ers, asking them "whether or not you
as mothers have enough confidence in
your son or daughter, or enough in
fluence over him or her, to be satisfied
that he or she will cast a sensible
vote —and if not, why not?"
There has been no official indica
tion of when the President will make
his recommendation to the Board of
Trustees on open house policy, and
Sterling did not mention the necessity
for Board approval in his address.
Critical Of Press
The President was critical of the
focus of the press in its coverage of
American college campuses. "Students
are part and a product of our society
—a society which is not only affluent,
but in many ways quite permissive,"
he said.
"I have a respect for that non-con
formity which can be genuinely in
dividual and constructive, but I have
none for non-conformity which is a
bad and, as such, produces its own
brand of conformity," Sterling told his
audience.
Addressing himself to shifts in high
er education during the past decade,
Sterling underscored concern for find

ing methods for "producing more con
structive interaction among students,
faculty, and officers of the university
in the determination of university
policy."
The President indicated that this
would be a major concern of the gen
eral reevaluation of Stanford cur
riculum currently underway. Point
ing to mushrooming faculties and stu
dent enrollments, he outlined the dif
ficulty of producing "a representative
student or faculty body" capable of
dealing with educational and policy
questions.
Sterling stressed today's student con
cern with the relevance of college
curriculum. He denied that this prob
lem was limited to large universities,
prone to depersonalization.
"Whether or not students are the
best judges of what will prove to be
useful in the long run, is another
question," he contended. "Their con
cern may be for a kind of 'instant
meaningfulness' which might be of
short life."
Student Views
"But I do believe that student views
should be studied and given considera
tion on this and related matters."
Sterling said it was his "intention
to employ students fully and actively
in the educational reevaluation upon
which we have embarked."
He announced the study'fc target
completion date as the end of the
1967-68 academic year.
Speaking in the Bishop Auditorium
of the new Graduate School of Busi
ness, Sterling humorously told the
ladies that dedication ceremonies had
become the University's most popular
function during the past two years,
with four already this year.
Frustrating Inability
He pointed to the University's
frustrating "inability to finance build
ings as fast as opportunities for aca
damic use present themselves."
"But our primary concern has been,
is, and should be with the quality
and substance of the education inside
and outside the building."
Sterling thanked the mothers for
their efforts in the past year on behalf
of Stanford students.

completion date as the end of the
1967-68 academic year.
Speaking in the Bishop Auditorium
of the new Graduate School of Busi
ness, Sterling humorously told the
ladies that dedication ceremonies had
become the University's most popular
function during the past two years,
with four already this year.
Frustrating Inability
He pointed to the University's
frustrating "inability to finance build
ings as fast as opportunities for aca
damic use present themselves."
"But our primary concern has been,
is, and should be with the quality
and substance of the education inside
and outside the building."
Sterling thanked the mothers for
their efforts in the past year on behalf
of Stanford students.
President Wallace Sterling yester
day told the Stanford Mothers' Club
intense student interest in governing
their own lives has always existed,
and parents should not expect it to
"go away."
"There appears to be apprehension
that today's students are going to take
themselves to the dogs by route of
self-indulgence," Sterling said.
However, Sterling reassured the
ladies, "I have not seen evidence that
there is a higher proportion of Stan
ford students disposed to such self
indulgence than heretofore."
Testing Premises
Given the new found freedom of the
college environment, he said it was
not surprising to find students "test
ing this or that premise," as they
reached for self-identity and purpose.
He reminded the ladies that "the
premises to be tested change with
changing times and knowledge."

"I do not want to appear defensive
about the role the college or univer
sity can play in assisting and guiding
the student who tests old and new
premises because I believe this role is
important," the President noted.
But Sterling went on to ask parents
"bluntly" what they had done or not
done that "would shake their confi
dence in the ability of their children
to cope with problems of self-develop
ment."
Evoking Interest
Looking at current issues, the Presi
dent cited the OFF campaign and open
house policy as "two matters which
will, I expect, evoke parental and
alumni interest."
Sterling spoke directly of the pro
posed open house changes, advocated
by the Committee of Fifteen in a re
port made public at the beginning of
the quarter. He described the pro
posed "local option" which would al
low each residence to set its own open
house hours, within certain bounds,
by a secret ballot."
He again spoke frankly to the moth
ers, asking them "whether or not you
as mothers have enough confidence in
your son or daughter, or enough in
fluence over him or her, to be satisfied
that he or she will cast a sensible
vote —and if not, why not?"
There has been no official indica
tion of when the President will make
his recommendation to the Board of
Trustees on open house policy, and
Sterling did not mention the necessity
for Board approval in his address.
Critical Of Press
The President was critical of the
focus of the press in its coverage of
American college campuses. "Students
are part and a product of our society
—a society which is not only affluent,
but in many ways quite permissive,"
he said.
"I have a respect for that non-con
formity which can be genuinely in
dividual and constructive, but I have
none for non-conformity which is a
bad and, as such, produces its own
brand of conformity," Sterling told his
audience.
Addressing himself to shifts in high
er education during the past decade,
Sterling underscored concern for find

ing methods for "producing more con
structive interaction among students,
faculty, and officers of the university
in the determination of university
policy."
The President indicated that this
would be a major concern of the gen
eral reevaluation of Stanford cur
riculum currently underway. Point
ing to mushrooming faculties and stu
dent enrollments, he outlined the dif
ficulty of producing "a representative
student or faculty body" capable of
dealing with educational and policy
questions.
Sterling stressed today's student con
cern with the relevance of college
curriculum. He denied that this prob
lem was limited to large universities,
prone to depersonalization.
"Whether or not students are the
best judges of what will prove to be
useful in the long run, is another
question," he contended. "Their con
cern may be for a kind of 'instant
meaningfulness' which might be of
short life."
Student Views
"But I do believe that student views
should be studied and given considera
tion on this and related matters."
Sterling said it was his "intention
to employ students fully and actively
in the educational reevaluation upon
which we have embarked."

cern with the relevance of college
curriculum. He denied that this prob
lem was limited to large universities,
prone to depersonalization.
"Whether or not students are the
best judges of what will prove to be
useful in the long run, is another
question," he contended. "Their con
cern may be for a kind of 'instant
meaningfulness' which might be of
short life."
Student Views
"But I do believe that student views
should be studied and given considera
tion on this and related matters."
Sterling said it was his "intention
to employ students fully and actively
in the educational reevaluation upon
which we have embarked."
He announced the study'fc target
completion date as the end of the
1967-68 academic year.
Speaking in the Bishop Auditorium
of the new Graduate School of Busi
ness, Sterling humorously told the
ladies that dedication ceremonies had
become the University's most popular
function during the past two years,
with four already this year.
Frustrating Inability
He pointed to the University's
frustrating "inability to finance build
ings as fast as opportunities for aca
damic use present themselves."
"But our primary concern has been,
is, and should be with the quality
and substance of the education inside
and outside the building."
Sterling thanked the mothers for
their efforts in the past year on behalf
of Stanford students.
President Wallace Sterling yester
day told the Stanford Mothers' Club
intense student interest in governing
their own lives has always existed,
and parents should not expect it to
"go away."
"There appears to be apprehension
that today's students are going to take
themselves to the dogs by route of
self-indulgence," Sterling said.
However, Sterling reassured the
ladies, "I have not seen evidence that
there is a higher proportion of Stan
ford students disposed to such self
indulgence than heretofore."
Testing Premises
Given the new found freedom of the
college environment, he said it was
not surprising to find students "test
ing this or that premise," as they
reached for self-identity and purpose.
He reminded the ladies that "the
premises to be tested change with
changing times and knowledge."

"I do not want to appear defensive
about the role the college or univer
sity can play in assisting and guiding
the student who tests old and new
premises because I believe this role is
important," the President noted.
But Sterling went on to ask parents
"bluntly" what they had done or not
done that "would shake their confi
dence in the ability of their children
to cope with problems of self-develop
ment."
Evoking Interest
Looking at current issues, the Presi
dent cited the OFF campaign and open
house policy as "two matters which
will, I expect, evoke parental and
alumni interest."
Sterling spoke directly of the pro
posed open house changes, advocated
by the Committee of Fifteen in a re
port made public at the beginning of
the quarter. He described the pro
posed "local option" which would al
low each residence to set its own open
house hours, within certain bounds,
by a secret ballot."
He again spoke frankly to the moth
ers, asking them "whether or not you
as mothers have enough confidence in
your son or daughter, or enough in
fluence over him or her, to be satisfied
that he or she will cast a sensible
vote —and if not, why not?"
There has been no official indica
tion of when the President will make
his recommendation to the Board of
Trustees on open house policy, and
Sterling did not mention the necessity
for Board approval in his address.
Critical Of Press
The President was critical of the
focus of the press in its coverage of
American college campuses. "Students
are part and a product of our society
—a society which is not only affluent,
but in many ways quite permissive,"
he said.
"I have a respect for that non-con
formity which can be genuinely in
dividual and constructive, but I have
none for non-conformity which is a
bad and, as such, produces its own
brand of conformity," Sterling told his
audience.
Addressing himself to shifts in high
er education during the past decade,
Sterling underscored concern for find

ing methods for "producing more con
structive interaction among students,
faculty, and officers of the university
in the determination of university
policy."
The President indicated that this
would be a major concern of the gen
eral reevaluation of Stanford cur
riculum currently underway. Point
ing to mushrooming faculties and stu
dent enrollments, he outlined the dif
ficulty of producing "a representative
student or faculty body" capable of
dealing with educational and policy
questions.
