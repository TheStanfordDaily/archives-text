# AMERICA'S MUSICAL TASTE
## Thomson Analyzes Modern Music 
### MARIAN JOHNSTON 
Virgil Thomson, composer and mu
sic critic, believes "the general under
standing of music in America is an
amazing and welcomed phenomenon."
Music in the twentieth century, how
ever, has not adequately responded
to the interests of the American peo
ple, he feels. This will be the subject
of his third lecture in the Leon Sloss
Jr. Memorial Lecture Series, entitled
"America's Unrequited Love: The
Opera."
No New Operas
"The American public has his tongue
hanging out for opera, but he is
mostly offered nineteenth century
opera," Thomson commented. When
asked if an audience for twentieth cen
tury opera exists, Thomson replied,
"There isn't any twentieth century
opera for there to be an audience for."
He explained that operas are written
but do not stay in the repertory of
the major opera companies. There is
no American opera that is performed
regularly.
The reason for this, as Thomson
sees it, is that "the whole set-up in
big houses is devoted to nineteenth
works. ... It is hard to make a new,
fresh thing when all the mechanics
are geared to the production of an
older work."
Even if few modern operas are being
written, there is a great deal of new
music in general. "Music is so accept
able now that everyone is drenched
with it. There is no turning the stuff
off."

"Every painter paints to music.
Every fishing boat is wired for music.
No one really listens anymore unless
they go to a concert and pay for it,"
Thomson complained.
Speaking of the tremendous record
business today, Thomson commented
that "the trouble with hearing records
is that everything is perfect every
time you hear it." The record industry
"builds up concert audiences" of those
who realize that there is no excite
ment in hearing repeated perfection.
Questioned on whether he considered
the new "electronic music" to truly
be music, Thomson answered, "Any
thing is food if you can swallow it.
Anything is music if the composer
calls it that."
As to his feelings about whether or
not it was good music, he commented,
"Whatever happens in a recognizable
way is good." He explained that by
"recognizable" he meant that the
music should be something he had not
heard before and that it not all sound
alike." "New music is not recognizable
as such. . . . Static is the general cli
mate of the new sound."
Smaller Groups
Another comment Thomson made
about the music being written today
was that composers are not writing
for large symphonic orchestras. They
prefer "the sound they can make with
smaller groups."
Symphonic orchestras do not need
to seek new music, however. "The
standard classical orchestra has such
an extraordinarily rich repertory,"

that even if new pieces are not writ
ten, "the classical repertory would
keep it alive."
Thomson is quite dissatisfied with
the new, "grand structures" which he
labels "shopping centers of the per
forming arts" which some cities have

built to house all the music organiza
tions in one place. He compared them
to supermarkets in which customers
are presented with an over abundance
of products. Instead ol "enormous cor
rals," Thomson prefers to have "little
jewels distributed around the city."
