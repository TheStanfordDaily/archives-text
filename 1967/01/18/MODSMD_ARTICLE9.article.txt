# Bruner Traces Steps To Child Development
## 
### CHUCK FULKERSON 
Professor Jerome Bruner, psycholo
gist and director of the Center for
Cognitive Studies at Harvard spoke
to a large audience last night in Dink
elspiel. Bruner, whose original topic
was to be language as The Implement
of Thought, explained that the study
of cognitive growth in infants was a
preface to his original topic. This
preface would help persons to under
stand how man attained the neces
sary skills to begin to use language
as an implement.
Bruner stated that it was necessary
in observing this process in a child
to note several important points
first. "How the infant passes from re
flex acts to a state of voluntary ac
tions, how is perception organized so
that a child acts in reflex actions,
how does an infant manage to grow so

that he can manage several things
simultaneously, and how does he use
all this in the control of tools?"
With these points in mind Bruner
launched into, what for the layman,
was a rather detailed account of suck
ing habits of infants through 14
months. Bruner described the new
born baby as nothing more than a
"complicated pump."
His sucking, Bruner stated emphati
cally, "is an insoluable attitude." With
lips clamped to the nipple he draws
milk in a series of negative and posi
tive actions.
The baby is unable to do anything
but suck. No two actions can be per
formed at the same time. In Bruner's
words it is a "feeding frenzy of swal
lowing, breathing and sucking. How
ever by six weeks Bruner stated joy
ously "there was a luxurious expendi
ture of energy, like that of a young
athlete." Already the baby is able to
differentiate. The sucking is orderly,
the intense frenzy has subdued. The
baby's eyes open, he seems capable of
doing more than one thing at a time.
With the aid of films Bruner showed
how a baby reacted to its first impli
ment, a cup. For the baby, he em
phasized, "the cup gets the infant
closer to technology."
The baby now is faced with an en
tirely new set of obstacles, such as
holding the cup, conditioning the
angle and movement of the cup with
his mouth and eyes, and changing
from a sucking to swallowing motion.
Bruner's 7 month old baby didn't do
so well, however, mistaking the cup
for a nipple it sucked on the bottom
end of the cup. Nevertheless, the baby
is definitely making progress in fa
miliarizing itself with the cup, such
as lifting and holding.
By fourteen months the baby has
mastered the techniques. He clamly
drinks from the cup. The motion is not
the "chaining action of sucking,
breathing and swallowing," Bruner
said, but rather the baby has ac
quired a skill. Intention of purpose in
this case, the idea drinking the milk
takes control of the action.
