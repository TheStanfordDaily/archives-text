CHUCK WENTZ
(8.5., Bus. Admin.) of the
Bethlehem Steel Loop
Course has found plenty of
action in sales. He's one
of many vigorous young
men in our coast-to-coast
sales organization
numbering some 600
salesmen and managers.
Join the action.
First step: pick up
a copy of "Careers
with Bethlehem Steel
and the Loop Course"
at your placement
office. Then sign up
for a campus interview.
Our 1967 Loop Class
has openings for technical
and non-technical graduates
(and post-grads) for
careers in steel operations,
research, sales, mining,
accounting, and other
activities.
