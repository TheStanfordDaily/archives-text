# Professor Lambastes Inverted Liberalism
## 
### MAGGIE McCOMAS 
Nobel Laureate William B. Shockley, pro
expounding a "theory" or even a hypothesis
lessor of engineering science, claims he is not
concerning genetic factors and racial differ
ences in regard to determining intelligence
and abilities. Yet it appears that he doing more
that just asking questions or issuing a chal
lenge for more research on the subject.
In a speech last Friday to the Common
wealth Club in San Francisco, Professor Shock
iey accused the medical and scientific com
munities of "inverted liberalism," the prime
symptom of which he labeled "environment
heredity uncertainty." Shockley explained that
it has not been determined whether environ
mental or genetic factors has more bearing in
determining intelligence and ability.
Shockley also labeled an another symptom
of this "disease" the "illusion of unlimited
plasticity of intelligence," explaining that all
men are really not "created equal" in terms of
genetics. The plasticity theory assumes that
environment is the prime determinent of in
tellectual development and exerts influence
strong enough to compensate for adverse he
redity factors.
In his speech Shockley supported an uniden
tified source whom he dubbed a "foremost ex

pert on environmental effect" as saying that
the "average intelligence scores of people
labeled 'black' as lower by about one standard
deviation than the average of those labeled
'white' and I believe that at least half of this
difference is related to genetic variables."
Deplores Taboo
Shockley deplores the "research taboo" which
he claims is supported by professional ge
neticists who reportedly confront the question
intelligence in connection with racial differ
ences with an attitude of "We don't know
anything about this, and you shouldn't raise
these possibilities."
As stated at a fall meeting of the National
Academy of Sciences, Shockley feels that re
search concerning the environment-heredity
uncertainty is inhibited by possible results
which may directly concern the "Negro prob
lem."
From his own research of mental tests ad
ministered to draftees, Prof. Shockley has put
forth an "overlap concept." Shockley reported
that in World War I, only 13 per cent of the
Negro draftees exceeded the average score of
whites taking the same test. This percentage
constitutes the "overlap." In contrast, his anal
ysis of data from the U.S. Army Surgeon

General showed that the overlap has now drop
ped to less than 8 per cent.
From this evidence Shockley asserts that
the welfare program of recent years, com
bined with varying influence of environmental
factors and possible deviations in the make-up
of tests, may have encouraged the develop
ment of a "less educable strain."
Two years ago in an address to a Nobel
symposium on "Genetics and the Future Man"
at Gustavus Adolphus College, Shockley said
evidence showing that "human intelligence is
largely genetically determined" was "impres
sive," though little-known. Shockley cited as
"especially convincing" studies of the I.Q.'s
of identical twins raised in different environ
ments.
Shockley again mentioned the idential twin
studies in an interview in a national magazine
in which he cited the possibility of a genetic
decline as a "coming reality."
The study mentioned showed there to be
less difference in the I.Q.'s of identical twins
separated at birth and raised in different en
vironmental condition than between other
siblings (genetically different) who are raised
in the same environment.
No Ethic Application
While the results of such studies have been

generally substantiated (and are general in
formation in a Psych I textbook), geneticists
agree that the results of such studies cannot
be applied to groups on an ethnic basis. One
member of the the Stanford genetics faculty
agreed that the study results show that genetic
factors are "significant inheritance compo
nents" in relating to intelligence and ability,
but that it is a "big step" to assert that such
individual differences can be generalized upon
and interpreted on a basis of race.
Prof. Shockley's view aroused considerable
dissent from genetics department faculty mem
bers who expressed their views in a joint letter
appearing last October in the Stanford M.D.
The letter accused Shockley of "pseudo-sci
entific justification for class and race preju
dice." While the faculty members commended
Shockley for making some constructive sug
gestions and calling for more research on the
subject, they expressed doubts of his "pre
judgment" which would tend to stifle con
structive suggestions and "innundoes about the
hereditary basis of the purported intellectual
and social deficits of Negroes."
This reporter experienced considerable dif
ficulty in seeking additional views of those in
the field in regard to Prof. Shockley's views.
Shockley has also cited the possibility of

"human deterioration" as a basis lor investi
gating the feasibility of some form of selec
tive population control.
Other Factors Correlated
In his Friday speech Shockley also corre
lated other factors of intelligence, socio-eco
nomi cstatus, and rate of propagation. He
cited the case of a woman with an I.Q. of 55
and 17 "predominantly illegitimate" children,
and another example of a 16-year-old girl,
raised on relief funds, who eventually had
three children of her own supported by wel
fare. Shockley indicated that "survival of the
fittest" may be working to the detriment rather
than the improvement of the human race. He
said that the evolutionary process may dis
courage a qualitative improvements in the
population as a whole since propagation rates
remain relatively high among those of limited
intelligence.
Shockley received the 1956 Nobel Prize in
Physics, jointly with two former colleagues at
the Bell Telephone Laboratories prior to as
suming his post at Stanford. Named Director
of Transistor Physics Research at Bell, he is
known for his invention of the junction tran
sistor. In 19G3 Shockley was named the first
Alexander M. PoiatofT professor of engineering
science at Stanford.

siblings (genetically different) who are raised
in the same environment.
No Ethic Application
While the results of such studies have been

generally substantiated (and are general in
formation in a Psych I textbook), geneticists
agree that the results of such studies cannot
be applied to groups on an ethnic basis. One
member of the the Stanford genetics faculty
agreed that the study results show that genetic
factors are "significant inheritance compo
nents" in relating to intelligence and ability,
but that it is a "big step" to assert that such
individual differences can be generalized upon
and interpreted on a basis of race.
Prof. Shockley's view aroused considerable
dissent from genetics department faculty mem
bers who expressed their views in a joint letter
appearing last October in the Stanford M.D.
The letter accused Shockley of "pseudo-sci
entific justification for class and race preju
dice." While the faculty members commended
Shockley for making some constructive sug
gestions and calling for more research on the
subject, they expressed doubts of his "pre
judgment" which would tend to stifle con
structive suggestions and "innundoes about the
hereditary basis of the purported intellectual
and social deficits of Negroes."
This reporter experienced considerable dif
ficulty in seeking additional views of those in
the field in regard to Prof. Shockley's views.
Shockley has also cited the possibility of

"human deterioration" as a basis lor investi
gating the feasibility of some form of selec
tive population control.
Other Factors Correlated
In his Friday speech Shockley also corre
lated other factors of intelligence, socio-eco
nomi cstatus, and rate of propagation. He
cited the case of a woman with an I.Q. of 55
and 17 "predominantly illegitimate" children,
and another example of a 16-year-old girl,
raised on relief funds, who eventually had
three children of her own supported by wel
fare. Shockley indicated that "survival of the
fittest" may be working to the detriment rather
than the improvement of the human race. He
said that the evolutionary process may dis
courage a qualitative improvements in the
population as a whole since propagation rates
remain relatively high among those of limited
intelligence.
Shockley received the 1956 Nobel Prize in
Physics, jointly with two former colleagues at
the Bell Telephone Laboratories prior to as
suming his post at Stanford. Named Director
of Transistor Physics Research at Bell, he is
known for his invention of the junction tran
sistor. In 19G3 Shockley was named the first
Alexander M. PoiatofT professor of engineering
science at Stanford.
Nobel Laureate William B. Shockley, pro
expounding a "theory" or even a hypothesis
lessor of engineering science, claims he is not
concerning genetic factors and racial differ
ences in regard to determining intelligence
and abilities. Yet it appears that he doing more
that just asking questions or issuing a chal
lenge for more research on the subject.
In a speech last Friday to the Common
wealth Club in San Francisco, Professor Shock
iey accused the medical and scientific com
munities of "inverted liberalism," the prime
symptom of which he labeled "environment
heredity uncertainty." Shockley explained that
it has not been determined whether environ
mental or genetic factors has more bearing in
determining intelligence and ability.
Shockley also labeled an another symptom
of this "disease" the "illusion of unlimited
plasticity of intelligence," explaining that all
men are really not "created equal" in terms of
genetics. The plasticity theory assumes that
environment is the prime determinent of in
tellectual development and exerts influence
strong enough to compensate for adverse he
redity factors.
In his speech Shockley supported an uniden
tified source whom he dubbed a "foremost ex

pert on environmental effect" as saying that
the "average intelligence scores of people
labeled 'black' as lower by about one standard
deviation than the average of those labeled
'white' and I believe that at least half of this
difference is related to genetic variables."
Deplores Taboo
Shockley deplores the "research taboo" which
he claims is supported by professional ge
neticists who reportedly confront the question
intelligence in connection with racial differ
ences with an attitude of "We don't know
anything about this, and you shouldn't raise
these possibilities."
As stated at a fall meeting of the National
Academy of Sciences, Shockley feels that re
search concerning the environment-heredity
uncertainty is inhibited by possible results
which may directly concern the "Negro prob
lem."
From his own research of mental tests ad
ministered to draftees, Prof. Shockley has put
forth an "overlap concept." Shockley reported
that in World War I, only 13 per cent of the
Negro draftees exceeded the average score of
whites taking the same test. This percentage
constitutes the "overlap." In contrast, his anal
ysis of data from the U.S. Army Surgeon

General showed that the overlap has now drop
ped to less than 8 per cent.
From this evidence Shockley asserts that
the welfare program of recent years, com
bined with varying influence of environmental
factors and possible deviations in the make-up
of tests, may have encouraged the develop
ment of a "less educable strain."
Two years ago in an address to a Nobel
symposium on "Genetics and the Future Man"
at Gustavus Adolphus College, Shockley said
evidence showing that "human intelligence is
largely genetically determined" was "impres
sive," though little-known. Shockley cited as
"especially convincing" studies of the I.Q.'s
of identical twins raised in different environ
ments.
Shockley again mentioned the idential twin
studies in an interview in a national magazine
in which he cited the possibility of a genetic
decline as a "coming reality."
The study mentioned showed there to be
less difference in the I.Q.'s of identical twins
separated at birth and raised in different en
vironmental condition than between other
siblings (genetically different) who are raised

of this "disease" the "illusion of unlimited
plasticity of intelligence," explaining that all
men are really not "created equal" in terms of
genetics. The plasticity theory assumes that
environment is the prime determinent of in
tellectual development and exerts influence
strong enough to compensate for adverse he
redity factors.
In his speech Shockley supported an uniden
tified source whom he dubbed a "foremost ex

pert on environmental effect" as saying that
the "average intelligence scores of people
labeled 'black' as lower by about one standard
deviation than the average of those labeled
'white' and I believe that at least half of this
difference is related to genetic variables."
Deplores Taboo
Shockley deplores the "research taboo" which
he claims is supported by professional ge
neticists who reportedly confront the question
intelligence in connection with racial differ
ences with an attitude of "We don't know
anything about this, and you shouldn't raise
these possibilities."
As stated at a fall meeting of the National
Academy of Sciences, Shockley feels that re
search concerning the environment-heredity
uncertainty is inhibited by possible results
which may directly concern the "Negro prob
lem."
From his own research of mental tests ad
ministered to draftees, Prof. Shockley has put
forth an "overlap concept." Shockley reported
that in World War I, only 13 per cent of the
Negro draftees exceeded the average score of
whites taking the same test. This percentage
constitutes the "overlap." In contrast, his anal
ysis of data from the U.S. Army Surgeon

General showed that the overlap has now drop
ped to less than 8 per cent.
From this evidence Shockley asserts that
the welfare program of recent years, com
bined with varying influence of environmental
factors and possible deviations in the make-up
of tests, may have encouraged the develop
ment of a "less educable strain."
Two years ago in an address to a Nobel
symposium on "Genetics and the Future Man"
at Gustavus Adolphus College, Shockley said
evidence showing that "human intelligence is
largely genetically determined" was "impres
sive," though little-known. Shockley cited as
"especially convincing" studies of the I.Q.'s
of identical twins raised in different environ
ments.
Shockley again mentioned the idential twin
studies in an interview in a national magazine
in which he cited the possibility of a genetic
decline as a "coming reality."
The study mentioned showed there to be
less difference in the I.Q.'s of identical twins
separated at birth and raised in different en
vironmental condition than between other
siblings (genetically different) who are raised
in the same environment.
No Ethic Application
While the results of such studies have been

generally substantiated (and are general in
formation in a Psych I textbook), geneticists
agree that the results of such studies cannot
be applied to groups on an ethnic basis. One
member of the the Stanford genetics faculty
agreed that the study results show that genetic
factors are "significant inheritance compo
nents" in relating to intelligence and ability,
but that it is a "big step" to assert that such
individual differences can be generalized upon
and interpreted on a basis of race.
Prof. Shockley's view aroused considerable
dissent from genetics department faculty mem
bers who expressed their views in a joint letter
appearing last October in the Stanford M.D.
The letter accused Shockley of "pseudo-sci
entific justification for class and race preju
dice." While the faculty members commended
Shockley for making some constructive sug
gestions and calling for more research on the
subject, they expressed doubts of his "pre
judgment" which would tend to stifle con
structive suggestions and "innundoes about the
hereditary basis of the purported intellectual
and social deficits of Negroes."
This reporter experienced considerable dif
ficulty in seeking additional views of those in
the field in regard to Prof. Shockley's views.
Shockley has also cited the possibility of

"human deterioration" as a basis lor investi
gating the feasibility of some form of selec
tive population control.
Other Factors Correlated
In his Friday speech Shockley also corre
lated other factors of intelligence, socio-eco
nomi cstatus, and rate of propagation. He
cited the case of a woman with an I.Q. of 55
and 17 "predominantly illegitimate" children,
and another example of a 16-year-old girl,
raised on relief funds, who eventually had
three children of her own supported by wel
fare. Shockley indicated that "survival of the
fittest" may be working to the detriment rather
than the improvement of the human race. He
said that the evolutionary process may dis
courage a qualitative improvements in the
population as a whole since propagation rates
remain relatively high among those of limited
intelligence.
Shockley received the 1956 Nobel Prize in
Physics, jointly with two former colleagues at
the Bell Telephone Laboratories prior to as
suming his post at Stanford. Named Director
of Transistor Physics Research at Bell, he is
known for his invention of the junction tran
sistor. In 19G3 Shockley was named the first
Alexander M. PoiatofT professor of engineering
science at Stanford.
Nobel Laureate William B. Shockley, pro
expounding a "theory" or even a hypothesis
lessor of engineering science, claims he is not
concerning genetic factors and racial differ
ences in regard to determining intelligence
and abilities. Yet it appears that he doing more
that just asking questions or issuing a chal
lenge for more research on the subject.
In a speech last Friday to the Common
wealth Club in San Francisco, Professor Shock
iey accused the medical and scientific com
munities of "inverted liberalism," the prime
symptom of which he labeled "environment
heredity uncertainty." Shockley explained that
it has not been determined whether environ
mental or genetic factors has more bearing in
determining intelligence and ability.
Shockley also labeled an another symptom
