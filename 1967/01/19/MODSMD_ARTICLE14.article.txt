# DONNER WHEELERS
## 
### 
Visitors to Donner House who
have been alarmed by finding
skid marks in the halls may rest
easy. There is no danger of a
new drag strip. It is merely a
sign of the new sport of wheel
chairing.
Ever since they acquired a
chair, the residents have been
busy racing down the halls while
balanced on the back wheels.
The main event of the year for
the wheelers will be the Wheel
Chair 500. Complete coverage
next week.
