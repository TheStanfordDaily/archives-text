# Low Board Scores Prove No Barrier
## 
### 
The registrar of the University
of Texas announced that a "pro
visional registration" program
has proved successful.
Students who would not nor
mally be admitted to the univer
sity because of low College
Board scores are allowed to en
ter if they maintain a C average
during the summer session.
Upwards of 30 per cent of
the provisional students earn
regular admission for the fall
semester.

In a somewhat similar pro
gram at Mount Holyoke College
in Massachusetts, 80 per cent of
the girls who scored approxi
mately 150 points lower on their
admissions tests graduated a f
the end of four years.
The percentage of "risk" stu
dents who graduated from
Mount Holyoke was nearly the
same as the over-all school per
centage. The only difference was
that the girls tended toward the
bottom half of their class.
