mm Di mi i Kimdi.yi January 18, 1967
As President of the University, I am now in the process of constituting the
Executive Committee for the forthcoming study of Stanford's educational
programs. Professor Herbert L. Packer, recently appointed Vice Provost for
Academic Planning and Programs, has been designated Chairman of the Execu
tive Committee for the study, and Mr. Robert R. Hind, Associate Dean of
Undergraduate Education, -will serve as Staff Director.
The Executive Committee will be a small working group composed of faculty
and student members selected for the contribution they can make to furthering
the purposes of the study. The committee will develop recommendations on
the basis of its own deliberations, and will also solicit ideas from every
segment of the University community.
In order to assure the broacest possible basis for selecting the student
members of the Executive Committee, I would like to invite all students,
undergraduate and graduate, who are interested in serving as members of the
study's Executive Committee to submit a brief statement of personal quali
fications for participating in the study and of the problems that he or she
identities as important to this comprehensive review of Stanford's educa
tional effort. These statements will serve as the basis for selection of a
small group of students to be interviewed for student positions on the
Committee. In addition, the statements will of course be valuable to the
Committee in planning and carrying out its work.
The study, as it progresses, will require the appointment of subcommittees
to deal with particular issues, such as the undergraduate curriculum, resi
dential policy, advising and counselling, and the like. Statements submitted
by students at this time will be used as a source of candidates for service
on these subcommittees.
Since the study is expected to go on for about two years, please do not
submit an application statement (although vour ideas are most welcome) unless
you expect to be at Stanford at least through June of 1968. Student members
of the Executive Committee will be expected to be on hand during the summer
of 1967, and hopefully 1968. An appropriate stipend will be paid for summer
work.
Statements of interest should be submitted to Mr. Hind, Building 10, and
should reach him riot later than 5 p.m. on Friday, January 27.
I invite the widest possible student interest and participation in this
important study, which will do much to influence Stanford's future academic
programs.

you expect to be at Stanford at least through June of 1968. Student members
of the Executive Committee will be expected to be on hand during the summer
of 1967, and hopefully 1968. An appropriate stipend will be paid for summer
work.
Statements of interest should be submitted to Mr. Hind, Building 10, and
should reach him riot later than 5 p.m. on Friday, January 27.
I invite the widest possible student interest and participation in this
important study, which will do much to influence Stanford's future academic
programs.

As President of the University, I am now in the process of constituting the
Executive Committee for the forthcoming study of Stanford's educational
programs. Professor Herbert L. Packer, recently appointed Vice Provost for
Academic Planning and Programs, has been designated Chairman of the Execu
tive Committee for the study, and Mr. Robert R. Hind, Associate Dean of
Undergraduate Education, -will serve as Staff Director.
The Executive Committee will be a small working group composed of faculty
and student members selected for the contribution they can make to furthering
the purposes of the study. The committee will develop recommendations on
the basis of its own deliberations, and will also solicit ideas from every
segment of the University community.
In order to assure the broacest possible basis for selecting the student
members of the Executive Committee, I would like to invite all students,
undergraduate and graduate, who are interested in serving as members of the
study's Executive Committee to submit a brief statement of personal quali
fications for participating in the study and of the problems that he or she
identities as important to this comprehensive review of Stanford's educa
tional effort. These statements will serve as the basis for selection of a
small group of students to be interviewed for student positions on the
Committee. In addition, the statements will of course be valuable to the
Committee in planning and carrying out its work.
The study, as it progresses, will require the appointment of subcommittees
to deal with particular issues, such as the undergraduate curriculum, resi
dential policy, advising and counselling, and the like. Statements submitted
by students at this time will be used as a source of candidates for service
on these subcommittees.
Since the study is expected to go on for about two years, please do not
submit an application statement (although vour ideas are most welcome) unless
you expect to be at Stanford at least through June of 1968. Student members
of the Executive Committee will be expected to be on hand during the summer
of 1967, and hopefully 1968. An appropriate stipend will be paid for summer
work.
