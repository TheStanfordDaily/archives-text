# OVERSEAS POLL
## Germany: Great But No Jello 
### KIRK HANSON Managing Editor 
Students of Germany XVII feel
generally satisfied with their six
months at Beutelsbach, but many
did not feel the group "jelled,"
according to a Stanford Daily
Overseas Poll administered there
last month.
The poll was taken during their
final week in residence at Stan
ford in Germany during Decem
ber. Of the 73 students in the
group, 47 participated in the
survey.
The Daily Poll was first ad
ministered at an Overseas Cam
pus in September when it was
given simultaneously to Italy
XII and France XII. Both groups
showed general .satisfaction with
the program but indicated great
dissatisfaction with the aca
demic program and with social
regulations.
Too Restrictive
Concerning social regulations,
almost 80 per cent of the group
rated the social regulations as
"much too restrictive" or "too
restrictive." Germany XVII oper
ated under the old social regula
tions which were preempted by
a new set on January 1.
One student commented on
the old social regulations: "The
system destroys all respect for
the laws ... all the laws, even
the necessary and good ones."
Another wrote: "Social regula
tions prevent rational or natural
realtionships between the sexes."
Many others who did not criticize
the regulations noted simply that
they were not enforced.
TYavel regulations which were
recently changed allow women
to travel alone with men. One
student commented on the old
regulations: "Travel rules for
women are Victorian in character
... a girl has to cheat on the
system to keep her self respect
and behave like an adult."
Although social regulations
were generally criticized, the
overall program was well-liked.
Over 87 per cent stated they
would come again to Stanford-in-
Germany if they had the deci
sion to make over again. Only
one student said he would not,
and the remainder did not an
swer the question.
The family program in Beu
telsbach appeared a success as
83 per cent said they had con
tact with the local people either
very often or often. However
some asked for a revamping of
the program so that the same
families do not become "tired of
American students."

The Beutelsbach location was
rated good or excellent by 71
per cent of the group, although
there were complaints about iso
lation and the relative unsophis
tication of the local people.
The food served was desig
nated fair to poor by 92 per cent
of the group. One student com
ments: "hard roles (sic) and
coffee are not breakfast even
on the continent."
Uneven Opinion
In academics, students reflect
ed uneven opinion on the courses
taught. According to the survey,
75 per cent felt the courses
were not related enough to the
environment.

The course load was consid
ered too heavy by about 40 per
cent and just right by the re
maining 60 per cent. Over 65
per cent said they would rather
take 14 units than the 16 which
have been required. Academic re
forms now being enacted allow
a student to choose 14, 16, or 18
units.
Grades for the students ap
proximated their GPA's at the
home campus. Half reported
grades about the same, while
30 per cent reported higher
grades and 20 per cent lower.
Change Estimated
The 47 who participated in the
survey had an average expendi
ture, excluding room, board, tu

ition, and flight homo, of $043.
The Overseas Campus office esli
mate is still $600 for the six
months. Writes one student:
"Please, would the Overseas
Campus OtTice change its esli
mate . . . $600 is a very had
thing to do to parents—it gets
their hopes up." Thirty eight of
the 47 returned to Stanford
this quarter.
On the question of whether
the group "jelled," one student
wrote: "A more incompatible
group than Germany XVll
would be near impossible." An
other saw this an as advantage:
Thank goodness the group did
not jell until the end.

Uneven Opinion
In academics, students reflect

taught. According to the survey,
75 per cent felt the courses
were not related enough to the
environment.

The course load was consid

cent and just right by the re
maining 60 per cent. Over 65

have been required. Academic re
forms now being enacted allow
a student to choose 14, 16, or 18

Students of Germany XVII feel
generally satisfied with their six
months at Beutelsbach, but many
did not feel the group "jelled,"
according to a Stanford Daily
Overseas Poll administered there
last month.
The poll was taken during their
final week in residence at Stan
ford in Germany during Decem
ber. Of the 73 students in the
group, 47 participated in the
survey.
The Daily Poll was first ad
ministered at an Overseas Cam
pus in September when it was
given simultaneously to Italy
XII and France XII. Both groups
showed general .satisfaction with
the program but indicated great
dissatisfaction with the aca
demic program and with social
regulations.
Too Restrictive
Concerning social regulations,
almost 80 per cent of the group
rated the social regulations as
"much too restrictive" or "too
restrictive." Germany XVII oper
ated under the old social regula
tions which were preempted by
a new set on January 1.
One student commented on
the old social regulations: "The
system destroys all respect for
the laws ... all the laws, even
the necessary and good ones."
Another wrote: "Social regula
tions prevent rational or natural
realtionships between the sexes."
Many others who did not criticize
the regulations noted simply that
they were not enforced.
TYavel regulations which were
recently changed allow women
to travel alone with men. One
student commented on the old
regulations: "Travel rules for
women are Victorian in character
... a girl has to cheat on the
system to keep her self respect
and behave like an adult."
Although social regulations
were generally criticized, the
overall program was well-liked.
Over 87 per cent stated they
would come again to Stanford-in-

sion to make over again. Only
one student said he would not,

The family program in Beu

83 per cent said they had con
tact with the local people either
very often or often. However
some asked for a revamping of
the program so that the same
families do not become "tired of
American students."

given simultaneously to Italy
XII and France XII. Both groups
showed general .satisfaction with
the program but indicated great
dissatisfaction with the aca
demic program and with social
regulations.
Too Restrictive
Concerning social regulations,
almost 80 per cent of the group
rated the social regulations as
"much too restrictive" or "too
restrictive." Germany XVII oper
ated under the old social regula
tions which were preempted by
a new set on January 1.
One student commented on
the old social regulations: "The
system destroys all respect for
the laws ... all the laws, even
the necessary and good ones."
Another wrote: "Social regula
tions prevent rational or natural
realtionships between the sexes."
Many others who did not criticize
the regulations noted simply that
they were not enforced.
TYavel regulations which were
recently changed allow women
to travel alone with men. One
student commented on the old
regulations: "Travel rules for
women are Victorian in character
... a girl has to cheat on the
system to keep her self respect
and behave like an adult."
Although social regulations
were generally criticized, the
overall program was well-liked.
Over 87 per cent stated they
would come again to Stanford-in-
Germany if they had the deci
sion to make over again. Only
one student said he would not,
and the remainder did not an
swer the question.
The family program in Beu
telsbach appeared a success as
83 per cent said they had con
tact with the local people either
very often or often. However
some asked for a revamping of
the program so that the same
families do not become "tired of
American students."

The Beutelsbach location was
rated good or excellent by 71
per cent of the group, although
there were complaints about iso
lation and the relative unsophis
tication of the local people.
The food served was desig
nated fair to poor by 92 per cent
of the group. One student com
ments: "hard roles (sic) and
coffee are not breakfast even
on the continent."
Uneven Opinion
In academics, students reflect
ed uneven opinion on the courses
taught. According to the survey,
75 per cent felt the courses
were not related enough to the
environment.

The course load was consid
ered too heavy by about 40 per
cent and just right by the re
maining 60 per cent. Over 65
per cent said they would rather
take 14 units than the 16 which
have been required. Academic re
forms now being enacted allow
a student to choose 14, 16, or 18
units.
Grades for the students ap
proximated their GPA's at the
home campus. Half reported
grades about the same, while
30 per cent reported higher
grades and 20 per cent lower.
Change Estimated
The 47 who participated in the
survey had an average expendi
ture, excluding room, board, tu

ition, and flight homo, of $043.
The Overseas Campus office esli
mate is still $600 for the six
months. Writes one student:
"Please, would the Overseas
Campus OtTice change its esli
mate . . . $600 is a very had
thing to do to parents—it gets
their hopes up." Thirty eight of
the 47 returned to Stanford
this quarter.
On the question of whether
the group "jelled," one student
wrote: "A more incompatible
group than Germany XVll
would be near impossible." An
other saw this an as advantage:
Thank goodness the group did
not jell until the end.
Soon: Britain II
