# UCLA, L. Alcindor Head AAWU Stats
## 
### 
As the Pacific Eight slows
down for the annual semester
examination break, UCLA has a
snug hold on first place, leads
the league in total offense and
field goals and controls third
place in rebounds and free
throws.
Largely responsible for the
Bruins' commanding scoring
lead is, naturally, superstar Lew
Alcindor. Alcindor holds down
first place in individual scoring
with a 29.8 average, nearly
eight points ahead of second
place Critchfield of California.
It is UCLA's domination of
the field goal statistics that
points to their success, how
ever. Rich Baker of Stanford
nailed top honors in this depart
ment, but four of the next five
places are in the possession of
the Bruins.
Frightening Sophs
Kenny Heitz is in second place
with a .632 percentage. Behind
him is Alcindor and Jim Niel
son and in fifth place, Lucius
Allen. It is interesting, if not
some what frightening, to note
that all four are sophomores.
In addition, a quick survey of
the number of attempts shows
Alcindor with 78, 28 ahead of
Allen, who in turn has taken 11
more shots than anyone else.
How does UCLA come up with

the ball so often? It's easy. A 1
len and Alcindor are first and
second, respectively, in rebound
ing.
Another One
To round out their domina
tion of everything, the Bruin's
have another sophomore, Lynn
Shackleford, who leads the
league in free throws with a
very respectable .909 percent
age.
In other team statistics, Ore
gon State, tied for second place
with Stanford, shows how they
got there with the league' 9
worst offense —by having the
league's best defense.
Statistically Stanford seems
to have no business being tied
for second. Aside from a good
showing in free throws, the In
dians place no higher than
fourth in any department and
are last in field goal percentage.
Tribe Leaders
Among the Tribe Art Harris
is the leading scorer with a 14.7
average. Followed by Don Grif
fen with 12.6 and Gary Peters
meyer with 11.2.
Harris also heads the Tribe
in rebounding with 102. Center
Rich Baker is second with 91.
Griffin has scored the most
points in a single game this sea
son. He hit for 28 against De-
Paul. In the same game he set
the season high for the most
field goals scored with 12.
Harris has the most rebounds
for a single game, 14 against
Arizona State. Gary Petersmey
er made the most field goals
in one game, when he sank 9
against Utah.

As the Pacific Eight slows
down for the annual semester
examination break, UCLA has a
snug hold on first place, leads
the league in total offense and
field goals and controls third
place in rebounds and free
throws.
Largely responsible for the
Bruins' commanding scoring
lead is, naturally, superstar Lew
Alcindor. Alcindor holds down
first place in individual scoring
with a 29.8 average, nearly
eight points ahead of second
place Critchfield of California.
It is UCLA's domination of
the field goal statistics that
points to their success, how
ever. Rich Baker of Stanford
nailed top honors in this depart
ment, but four of the next five
places are in the possession of
the Bruins.
Frightening Sophs
Kenny Heitz is in second place
with a .632 percentage. Behind
him is Alcindor and Jim Niel
son and in fifth place, Lucius
Allen. It is interesting, if not
some what frightening, to note
that all four are sophomores.
In addition, a quick survey of
the number of attempts shows
Alcindor with 78, 28 ahead of
Allen, who in turn has taken 11
more shots than anyone else.
How does UCLA come up with

the ball so often? It's easy. A 1
len and Alcindor are first and
second, respectively, in rebound
ing.
Another One
To round out their domina
tion of everything, the Bruin's
have another sophomore, Lynn
Shackleford, who leads the
league in free throws with a
very respectable .909 percent
age.
In other team statistics, Ore
gon State, tied for second place
with Stanford, shows how they
got there with the league' 9
worst offense —by having the
league's best defense.
Statistically Stanford seems
to have no business being tied
for second. Aside from a good
showing in free throws, the In
dians place no higher than
fourth in any department and
are last in field goal percentage.

As the Pacific Eight slows
down for the annual semester
examination break, UCLA has a
snug hold on first place, leads
the league in total offense and
field goals and controls third
place in rebounds and free
throws.
Largely responsible for the
Bruins' commanding scoring
lead is, naturally, superstar Lew
Alcindor. Alcindor holds down
first place in individual scoring
with a 29.8 average, nearly
eight points ahead of second
place Critchfield of California.
It is UCLA's domination of
the field goal statistics that
points to their success, how
ever. Rich Baker of Stanford
nailed top honors in this depart
ment, but four of the next five
places are in the possession of
the Bruins.
Frightening Sophs
Kenny Heitz is in second place
with a .632 percentage. Behind
him is Alcindor and Jim Niel
son and in fifth place, Lucius
Allen. It is interesting, if not
some what frightening, to note
that all four are sophomores.
In addition, a quick survey of
the number of attempts shows
Alcindor with 78, 28 ahead of
Allen, who in turn has taken 11
more shots than anyone else.
How does UCLA come up with

the ball so often? It's easy. A 1
len and Alcindor are first and
second, respectively, in rebound
ing.
Another One
To round out their domina
tion of everything, the Bruin's
have another sophomore, Lynn
Shackleford, who leads the
league in free throws with a
very respectable .909 percent
age.
In other team statistics, Ore
gon State, tied for second place
with Stanford, shows how they
got there with the league' 9
worst offense —by having the
league's best defense.
Statistically Stanford seems
to have no business being tied
for second. Aside from a good
showing in free throws, the In
dians place no higher than
fourth in any department and
are last in field goal percentage.
Tribe Leaders
Among the Tribe Art Harris
is the leading scorer with a 14.7
average. Followed by Don Grif
fen with 12.6 and Gary Peters
meyer with 11.2.
Harris also heads the Tribe
in rebounding with 102. Center
Rich Baker is second with 91.
Griffin has scored the most
points in a single game this sea
son. He hit for 28 against De-
Paul. In the same game he set
the season high for the most
field goals scored with 12.
Harris has the most rebounds
for a single game, 14 against
Arizona State. Gary Petersmey
er made the most field goals
in one game, when he sank 9
against Utah.
