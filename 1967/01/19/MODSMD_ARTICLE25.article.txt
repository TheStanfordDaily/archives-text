# Letters To The Editor
## Orchids And Onions: Band, Gas Cost, Harris, LBJ 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
I was not surprised to see that
The Daily's sports reporting is
now emulating the incomparable
style of Axe Comm. Stanford's
basketball record for its Los An
geles trip was not one win-one
loss, as you reported, but two
wins-one loss. And, contrary to
the laments of The Daily sports
page, Stanford did beat UCLA.
I am speaking, of course, of
the annual Band Basketball
Tournament between the Pep
Bands of UCLA, USC, Cal and
Stanford, which takes place
when the Bay Area teams in
vade Los Angeles. Cal and USC,
shying at the obvious strength
of the other two teams, with
drew ingloriously from the com
petition. Not our Red-Vest Band,
however.
Coach Chuck 'Red' Donnelley
and his team, led by freshmen
sharpshooters Barry Hennings,
Steve Child and Rick Leicher,
took on the UCLA music men
Saturday morning, January
and scored an impressive 32-26
victory. The win marked the sec
ond consecutive tournament tri
umph for Stanford musicians,
who won last year's contest by
beating Cal in overtime.
The varsity basketballers left
Los Angeles with an even rec
cord, but the LSJURVB came
away undefeated, both musically
and athletically.
Yours very truly, in the inter
ests of complete and comprehen
sive athletic competition report
ing.

Editor, The Daily:
Being familiar with Bob
Stone's previous Daily articles,
I almost passed over the very
interesting one in Tuesday's pa
per. The one thing he didn't men
tion was the names and ad
dresses of those gas stations
that do not go along with the
price fixing, and hence do have
lower prices.
If he really wants to help
"John Q. Student," and those of
us who pay our own gas bills,
he should let us know. The in
creased patronage might keep
the honest guys from going out
of business.
I hope Mr. Stone will continue
his valuable research.

(Editor's Note: Mr. Stone in
forms us that the only stations

which he has been able to locate
which are not members of the
group are the Shell station at
El Camino and San Antonio, and
the various Star and Bar sta
tions on El Caniino and on Wil
low Road in Menlo Park.)
• Appalling
Editor, The Daily:
I was appalled to read the
comments of David Harris in
the New York Times concern
ing the Berkeley student strike.
It would be difficult to concoct
an argument more devoid of
logic and respect for facts than
Harris' statement that, "Univer
sities are places for people who
are there. A university does not
belong to the administration or
to the regents. It is not the prop
erty of a state. It belongs to the
people who come for understand
ing."
Harris conducts his first as
sault on reason by uttering a
blatant falsehood. The fact is
that the university in question,
Berkeley, is the property of a
state. The Berkeley administra
tion and the Regents are the
legally appointed agents of this
owner, and have the full au
thority and duty to act as such.
Now, who does Harris con
sider the owners of Berkeley?
People "who are there." The
owners of a university, declares
Harris, are not the people who
hold legal title to it, but "the
people who come for understand
ing."
Thus we see the real essence
of Harris' argument. The only
people with any right to deter
mine how a university is to be
run are those who supposedly
seek to be educated (and in the
case of the Berkeley radicals,
this assumption is very question
able indeed), or those stray per
sons who just happen to be
there.
One can, with equal logic, de
clare that a department store be
long not to its owners, but to its
customers, and should be oper
ated by whoever happens to be
browsing through the store at
any particular time.
Harris' statement displays, in
short, a disgraceful disregard
of facts, a total lack of respect
for the rights of others, an an
nihilation of the concept of prop
erty, and a collectivist mentality
of the lowest order.

Editor, The Daily:
For the advancement of stu
dent activism, I wish to present
some university problems and
my modest proposals. Only by
implementing the following can
the school justify its existence.
Problem: The geld trip has
lost meaning.
Proposal: Teachers shall be ad
vanced on the basis of their drug
records. Instructors shall use
barbiturates; professors, mari
juana; emeriti, LSD. Student
teacher relations may be vali
dated by trips together.
Problem: Admission is dis
criminatory.
Proposal: Admission shall be
based on demonstrations per
year of high school academic in
volvement. Brownie points shall
be given for riots, sit-ins, and
any overt physical renunciation
of authority.

Problem: Course requirements
stultify student incentive.
Proposal: Degrees shall be
awarded by the students to the
students on orientation day. Stu
dents shall write and take their
examainations at leisure. Mas
ters degrees shall be given to
those who see a professor, and
doctorates to those who purchase
more than eighty-five cents'
worth of bound, printed matter.
The student shall at all times
exercise his liberties. When he
fails to do so, he shall be held
in violation of the Honor Code.
Freedom is mandatory.

LETTER FROM THE
PRESIDENT
Excuse me please but your son
won't be returning home again.
Due to my orders, I admit,
but 'twas of necessity I assure
you.
Excuse me please but your
son had died for a cause he
didn't believe in,
But 'twas all for the better
of his country, as I see it.
Excuse me please but I have
sent your son thousands of miles
to his death,
Though it wasn't really my
fault, as we have a duty to po
lice the world.
Excuse me please but I know

how you must feel; I have a son
in-law myself,
But fortunately I've been able
to keep him safe and spare need
less loss.
Excuse me please for killing
your son, but I'm sure he didn't
die in vain,
And we should have this whole
conflict settled sometime soon.
Excuse me again but your son
has died for his country, and this
is no shame.
It's only a pity that no one
knows what else it was he died
for,
Excuse me one last time but if
you have any more sons, could
they please enlist?
I'm not quite sure escalation
will do the trick, but we can al
ways try it.
After all, we have a lot more
sons like yours.

I was appalled to read the
comments of David Harris in
the New York Times concern
ing the Berkeley student strike.
It would be difficult to concoct
an argument more devoid of
logic and respect for facts than
Harris' statement that, "Univer
sities are places for people who
are there. A university does not
belong to the administration or
to the regents. It is not the prop
erty of a state. It belongs to the
people who come for understand
ing."
Harris conducts his first as
sault on reason by uttering a
blatant falsehood. The fact is
that the university in question,
Berkeley, is the property of a
state. The Berkeley administra
tion and the Regents are the
legally appointed agents of this
owner, and have the full au
thority and duty to act as such.
Now, who does Harris con
sider the owners of Berkeley?
People "who are there." The
owners of a university, declares
Harris, are not the people who
hold legal title to it, but "the
people who come for understand
ing."
Thus we see the real essence
of Harris' argument. The only
people with any right to deter
mine how a university is to be
run are those who supposedly
seek to be educated (and in the
case of the Berkeley radicals,
this assumption is very question
able indeed), or those stray per
sons who just happen to be
there.
One can, with equal logic, de
clare that a department store be
long not to its owners, but to its
customers, and should be oper
ated by whoever happens to be
browsing through the store at
any particular time.
Harris' statement displays, in
short, a disgraceful disregard
of facts, a total lack of respect
for the rights of others, an an
nihilation of the concept of prop
erty, and a collectivist mentality
of the lowest order.

For the advancement of stu
dent activism, I wish to present
some university problems and
my modest proposals. Only by
implementing the following can
the school justify its existence.
Problem: The geld trip has
lost meaning.
Proposal: Teachers shall be ad
vanced on the basis of their drug
records. Instructors shall use
barbiturates; professors, mari
juana; emeriti, LSD. Student
teacher relations may be vali
dated by trips together.
Problem: Admission is dis
criminatory.
Proposal: Admission shall be
based on demonstrations per
year of high school academic in
volvement. Brownie points shall
be given for riots, sit-ins, and
any overt physical renunciation
of authority.

Problem: Course requirements
stultify student incentive.
Proposal: Degrees shall be
awarded by the students to the
students on orientation day. Stu
dents shall write and take their
examainations at leisure. Mas
ters degrees shall be given to
those who see a professor, and
doctorates to those who purchase
more than eighty-five cents'
worth of bound, printed matter.
The student shall at all times
exercise his liberties. When he
fails to do so, he shall be held
in violation of the Honor Code.
Freedom is mandatory.

Being familiar with Bob

If he really wants to help
"John Q. Student," and those of

Editor, The Daily:
I was appalled to read the
comments of David Harris in
the New York Times concern
ing the Berkeley student strike.
It would be difficult to concoct
an argument more devoid of
logic and respect for facts than
Harris' statement that, "Univer
sities are places for people who
are there. A university does not
belong to the administration or
to the regents. It is not the prop
erty of a state. It belongs to the
people who come for understand
ing."
Harris conducts his first as
sault on reason by uttering a
blatant falsehood. The fact is
that the university in question,
Berkeley, is the property of a
state. The Berkeley administra
tion and the Regents are the
legally appointed agents of this
owner, and have the full au
thority and duty to act as such.
Now, who does Harris con
sider the owners of Berkeley?
People "who are there." The
owners of a university, declares
Harris, are not the people who
hold legal title to it, but "the
people who come for understand
ing."
Thus we see the real essence
of Harris' argument. The only
people with any right to deter
mine how a university is to be
run are those who supposedly
seek to be educated (and in the
case of the Berkeley radicals,
this assumption is very question
able indeed), or those stray per
sons who just happen to be
there.
One can, with equal logic, de
clare that a department store be
long not to its owners, but to its
customers, and should be oper
ated by whoever happens to be
browsing through the store at
any particular time.
Harris' statement displays, in
short, a disgraceful disregard
of facts, a total lack of respect
for the rights of others, an an
nihilation of the concept of prop
erty, and a collectivist mentality
of the lowest order.

For the advancement of stu
dent activism, I wish to present
some university problems and
my modest proposals. Only by
implementing the following can
the school justify its existence.
Problem: The geld trip has
lost meaning.
Proposal: Teachers shall be ad
vanced on the basis of their drug
records. Instructors shall use
barbiturates; professors, mari
juana; emeriti, LSD. Student
teacher relations may be vali
dated by trips together.
Problem: Admission is dis
criminatory.
Proposal: Admission shall be
based on demonstrations per
year of high school academic in
volvement. Brownie points shall
be given for riots, sit-ins, and
any overt physical renunciation
of authority.

Problem: Course requirements
stultify student incentive.
Proposal: Degrees shall be
awarded by the students to the
students on orientation day. Stu
dents shall write and take their
examainations at leisure. Mas
ters degrees shall be given to
those who see a professor, and
doctorates to those who purchase
more than eighty-five cents'
worth of bound, printed matter.
The student shall at all times
exercise his liberties. When he
fails to do so, he shall be held
in violation of the Honor Code.
Freedom is mandatory.

I was appalled to read the
comments of David Harris in
the New York Times concern
ing the Berkeley student strike.
It would be difficult to concoct
an argument more devoid of
logic and respect for facts than
Harris' statement that, "Univer
sities are places for people who
are there. A university does not
belong to the administration or
to the regents. It is not the prop
erty of a state. It belongs to the
people who come for understand
ing."
Harris conducts his first as
sault on reason by uttering a
blatant falsehood. The fact is
that the university in question,
Berkeley, is the property of a
state. The Berkeley administra
tion and the Regents are the
legally appointed agents of this
owner, and have the full au
thority and duty to act as such.
Now, who does Harris con
sider the owners of Berkeley?
People "who are there." The
owners of a university, declares
Harris, are not the people who
hold legal title to it, but "the
people who come for understand
ing."
Thus we see the real essence
of Harris' argument. The only
people with any right to deter
mine how a university is to be
run are those who supposedly
seek to be educated (and in the
case of the Berkeley radicals,
this assumption is very question
able indeed), or those stray per
sons who just happen to be
there.
One can, with equal logic, de
clare that a department store be
long not to its owners, but to its
customers, and should be oper
ated by whoever happens to be
browsing through the store at
any particular time.
Harris' statement displays, in
short, a disgraceful disregard
of facts, a total lack of respect
for the rights of others, an an
nihilation of the concept of prop
erty, and a collectivist mentality
of the lowest order.

For the advancement of stu
dent activism, I wish to present
some university problems and
my modest proposals. Only by
implementing the following can
the school justify its existence.
Problem: The geld trip has
lost meaning.
Proposal: Teachers shall be ad
vanced on the basis of their drug
records. Instructors shall use
barbiturates; professors, mari
juana; emeriti, LSD. Student
teacher relations may be vali
dated by trips together.
Problem: Admission is dis
criminatory.
Proposal: Admission shall be
based on demonstrations per
year of high school academic in
volvement. Brownie points shall
be given for riots, sit-ins, and
any overt physical renunciation
of authority.

Problem: Course requirements
stultify student incentive.
Proposal: Degrees shall be
awarded by the students to the
students on orientation day. Stu
dents shall write and take their
examainations at leisure. Mas
ters degrees shall be given to
those who see a professor, and
doctorates to those who purchase
more than eighty-five cents'
worth of bound, printed matter.
The student shall at all times
exercise his liberties. When he
fails to do so, he shall be held
in violation of the Honor Code.
Freedom is mandatory.

I was not surprised to see that
The Daily's sports reporting is

basketball record for its Los An

loss, as you reported, but two
wins-one loss. And, contrary to
the laments of The Daily sports
page, Stanford did beat UCLA.
I am speaking, of course, of
the annual Band Basketball
Tournament between the Pep
Bands of UCLA, USC, Cal and
Stanford, which takes place
when the Bay Area teams in
vade Los Angeles. Cal and USC,
shying at the obvious strength
of the other two teams, with
drew ingloriously from the com
petition. Not our Red-Vest Band,
however.
Coach Chuck 'Red' Donnelley
and his team, led by freshmen
sharpshooters Barry Hennings,
Steve Child and Rick Leicher,
took on the UCLA music men
Saturday morning, January
and scored an impressive 32-26
victory. The win marked the sec
ond consecutive tournament tri

who won last year's contest by
beating Cal in overtime.
The varsity basketballers left
