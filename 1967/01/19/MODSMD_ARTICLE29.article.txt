## Reagan Vs. Campus Cranks 
### William F. Buckley, Jr 
Mr. Reagan has infuriated the
academic community in Califor
nia and he is here and there be
ing hanged in effigy. What he
did most greatly needed doing.
But it is true that he acted rather
too brusquely, and without pay
ing sufficient attention to some
of the immediate consequences
of his proposals.
For that his staff is largely
responsible, and it is difficult to
put together a staff so experi
enced as to be instantly aware
of the network of relevant neu
roses a new governor is almost
certain to step upon. There was
apparently no one around to
advise poor Mr. Reagan that
the academic community has in
it the biggest concentration of
alarmists, cranks and extremists
this side of the giggle house.
What Governor Reagan did
was announce that there would
be a 10 per cent cut across the
board in spending. Others have
stepped into office saying the
same kind of thing, e.g. Dwight
Eisenhower, the theory behind
that approach to economy be
ing that you-name-it, there's fat
in even that operation, and any
body can get along with 10 per
cent less.
$400 Tuition
But he also proposed that
students who attend colleges in
California contribute $400 per
year (they now pay token fees
only) towards their education,
and the educators feel that this
is something for them to com
plain about. The argument that
this would prevent the very poor
student from going to college at
all was instantly anticipated by
Reagan, who called for continu
ing general scholarships for the
truly indigent, which however
does not include all those
bronze-types who coast in to
their free school in their souped
up Thunderbirds.

What Governor Reagan might
better have done, in order to
separate the educators from the
educationists, is to point to some
specific enterprises of California
education which would not be
defensible even if California
were heir to King Solomon's
mines.
In the great University of
California at Santa Barbara, for
instance, there is, of all things,
an entire division of "Home
Economics." Now the best way
to learn home economics is at
home, not at a great big grown
up university. There are things
like Physical Education depart
ments—not to be confused with
physical activities, which are nor
mal and desirable. Nobody quite
seems to know what an Indus
trial Art is, but you can learn it,
free, at California.
Frivolous Campus
Then there are the junior
colleges, many of which are
frankly and explicitly frivolous.
They could close down one or
even two of their showrings, and
hurt education not at all. And
too, in California, if you desire
to teach at a public school, you
are required to take a fifth year
after you have graduated from
college, during which you do not
spend more time learning the
subject you now propose to
teach, but rather being taught
how to teach: a disreputable
waste of time, not only costly,
but humiliating, and having the
effect of keeping well qualified
men and women from teaching
school who, however, do not
have the time or will not submit
to the ignominy of a year at the
hands of educational bureau
crats.
The point, then, is that Gov
ernor Reagan was surely cor
rect that even the educational
enterprise in California can be

trimmed by 10 per cent. But he
spoke too brusquely, and what
he said had the effect, for in
stance, of freezing the universi
ties' hand at just the moment
(early January) when commit

ments must be made to next
year's scholar-teachers who,
many of them, might now be
coaxed elsewhere, thus vitiating
many months of work by earnest
and devoted talent-hunters.

In the great University of
California at Santa Barbara, for

They could close down one or

too, in California, if you desire
to teach at a public school, you
are required to take a fifth year
after you have graduated from
college, during which you do not
spend more time learning the
subject you now propose to
teach, but rather being taught
how to teach: a disreputable
waste of time, not only costly,
but humiliating, and having the
effect of keeping well qualified
men and women from teaching
school who, however, do not
have the time or will not submit
to the ignominy of a year at the

The point, then, is that Gov

spoke too brusquely, and what
he said had the effect, for in
