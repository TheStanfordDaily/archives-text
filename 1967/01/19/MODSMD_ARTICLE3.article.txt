# Admissions And Latent Talent
## 
### SANDY SHAPIRO Assistant Editor 
"We need to find some students
who are neither athletes nor student
oody presidents but who have very
creative talents," Professor Albert
Guerard of the English Department
said last Monday at the initial meet
ing of the School of Humanities and
Social Sciences faculty.
Co-director of the Freshmen En
glish program, Guerard said in an in
terview yesterday,"I look at this
problem from a special vantage. I
wouldn't have been accepted at Stan
ford this year. I had a poor record
and a lot of C's."
Freshmen entering Stanford are
"extraordinarily competent, hard
working," and almost too well be
haved, he explained. "Often the un
usual and creative student, is not ad
mitted even though he is qualified.
We need to consider students for
other reasons than grades and activi
ties."
Guerard said he was disappointed
'that there aren't more exceptional,
creative writers in the entering class."
He suggested that the faculty con
sider "reducing rather radically" the
importance of extroverted activities
in present admission criteria.
Concealed Talent
Guerard commented, "We found
ttyere was much concealed artistic

talent in last year's Freshman class.
We had over 200 entries in the Fresh
men Art Show held at Roble last
spring."
Prof. Keith Boyle of the Art De
partment said the search for artisti
cally creative talent in high schools is
"extremely difficult" because approxi
mately only half the secondary
schools in the United States offer
studio courses.
Both Geurard and Boyle felt that
Stanford should look for creative stu
dents from the rapidly-vanishing spe
cialized high schools. Guerard stated
that several years ago Harvard drew
15 per cent of the entering class came
from New York high schools.
Freshmen IVleoca
Boyle questioned why Stanford and
other top institutions make a few
high schools "a mecca" for future
freshmen and why more than half of
the University's undergraduates still
come from California.
Guerard expressed a desire to see
"a more intense effort to admit more
students from underprivileged areas."
He recommended extending the de
ferred grading program now used in
some Western Civ and English sec
tions. "Ideally, the entire Freshman
year would be on a pass-fail basis.
This would protect some of the stu
dents who are less prepared for col
lege until they can adjust to the aca
demic program."

Individual members of the Art and
Music Departments said it was diffi
cult to find adequate time for recruit
ing and appraising creative talent in
their respective fields. Until the col
leges demonstrate a greater interest
in fine arts students, good high school
programs will probably remain "few
and far between" they indicated.
"In the six years I have been here,"
Guerard said, "the student body has
become much more interesting." He
felt intellectual activity is increasing
and that the "campus is improving.
"Admission guidelines must be
changed to fit these new needs."
The Art and Music Departments
are beginning to make recommenda
tions to the Admissions Board on the
basis of slides of artwork and musical
tapes submitted by prospective stu
dents, Guerard added.
Little Disagreement
Professor Claude Simpson of the
English Department, head of the fac
ulty steering committee for the
School of Humanities and Sciences
discussion forum, asked Guerard and
Boyle to speak briefly on admissions
during the group's first meeting to
initiate discussion. According to Gue
rard "very little disagreement" was
expressed with the opinion that there
is too much "overall excellence" in
the student body.
Professor Friedrich Strothmann,

executive head of the Modern Euro
pean Language Department, said the
last time he heard the faculty discuss
these issues "the computer boys had
the day," recommending ways of pre
dicting and testing performance of
students with varied characteristics.
"Now we seem to want to put more
faith in personal judgment, a posi
tion which the admissions staff fought
for quite hard the last time around."
Simpson and Dean Robert R. Sears
of the School indicated that a three
man committee would be appointed to
pursue the question of admissions
and to gather more factual informa
tion.
