## Wanted At Stanford: Crystal Ball Expert 
### Joel Kugelmass 
Unbeknownst to most, Stanford
provides for a chair of astrology
and mysticism, one of the hal
lowed traditions of Mrs. Stan
ford's San Francisco akademos.
For years special officers of the
University have searched in or
der to fill it, but as one official
said, "money can't buy every
thing . .
Last quarter, for a moment,
success was had. A veteran for
est ranger, perhaps best known
for his work on the pruning of
small trees, had written a confi
dential letter to the University:
"What's all this silliness about
a vacant chair? According to the
stars I'm your man."
I had the pleasure of inter
viewing Dr. Schmulz as he got
settled in his office, a small dust
free chamber at Level B6 in
the Hoover Tower. I remember
asking him what he thought the
role of astrology was at the
modern university.
"Poohbah, Sonney, that ques
tion abridges academic freedom."
Bowling Too
I watched him unwrap a
polished clear ball. He told me
to look deeply inside of the
crystal; suddently, as if by mag
ic, there appeared the letters:
"Dr. I. S. Schmulz,, First Place,
National Bowling League." He
continued: "You know, kiddo,
there's nothing like a good after
noon at the Bowling Alley."
"Dr. Schmulz," I said, "are you
planning to give a course?"
"No, you know how it is. Con
juring in the morning, bowling
in the afternoon, star gazing at
nightâ€”keeps a fellow on the go
go. You want a trick maybe?"
Before I could answer he pulled
out of his cap some yellowed
papers. "These notes are 30 years
old, if they were good enough
for your dad, they're good
enough for you."
He waved his hand furiously,
shouted "No Smoking" three

times, and suddenly the room
filled with shining, silvery
strands. He read a few pages
from the notes, and cracked two
special all-purpose jokes. As if
by magic there stood before me
a wondrous, dazzling theory, as
the strands slowly dissolved into
the air.
Sohmultz Theory
"Dr. Schmulz," I wondered,
"now that you have a theory,
what do you plan to do with it?"
"What kind of student are you
anyhow, wow-eeee! Of course
I'm going to take it to the next
Association meeting and give it
to some younger guy for his of
fice. I mean, where in the world
could I put another theory in
this little room?"
I asked the Doctor whether
he thought the modern student
was alienated from the modern
university.
"Depends on your birthday,
sure enough. When were you
born?" I didn't know, so we had
to call the Registrar's office.
It told us after doing some
checking, and reminded me that
I still had forty units of sci
ence to complete for General
Studies.
Dr. Schmulz stared at the date
for the longest while, frowning.
"You sure this is right?" he
asked. I said I thought so, since
the University was pretty good
about keeping records. I added
that he, being a member of the
faculty, could get a book list
ing the birthdays of all students.
Book Of Magic
Dr. Schmulz turned to an old
carton and began rummaging
through it. Finally he found an
old, large volume entitle One
Dimensional Magic. He leafed
through to a chapter on Eros
and Good Table Manners. I was
distracted all of a quick by his
theory, which had begun danc
ing about the room. He muttered
something about draft age and
how he had to go to Washing
ton to confer with one-eyed wier
dos. "All you students are a lot,
I declare." I said I hadn't heard
him, but when I turned to listen,
he was gone.
I went to ask the secretary
where he was. She said that he
left laughing, muttering about
pruning the Stanford tree. I re
turned to his office with a friend.
There his theory was settled in
a corner without life or purpose.
Since it had developed a faint
odor, we carried it down to the
Dumpster, and went off to study.
To this day the chair remains
vacant.
