# OFF Rent Boycott Ends Deadline Forces Payment
## 
### MINDY MATHISON 
The rent boycott officially ended
Tuesday when room and board pay
ments fell due. Approximately 8.9 per
cent of those students living in Uni
versity residences waited until Tues
day, the last day payments could be
made without penalty, to pay or defer
their bills. This compares with the 5.1
per cent who delayed payment until
the due date of winter quarter, 1966.
Mrs. Buma, of the Controller's Office,
noted that those resident students in
curring late fees by holding off pay
ment beyond January 17 amounted to

3.5 per cent, approximately the same
percentage as last year.
According to Mrs. Buma, the Con
troller's Office is running comparisons
between this year's and last year's
figures out of interest in the relative
success of the boycott.
The strike was called for before
Christmas vacation when Miss Janet
Howell, chairman of the OFF cam
paign to secure the right of off-cam
pus living for undergraduate women,
suggested that such a move would be
an impressive indication to the ad
ministration of general student body
support for the movement.
In terms of the OFF campaign
committee, the boycott is considered
a success. Miss Howell previously
commented that her committee would
be in a better position to discuss the
question of off-campus housing with
the school administration following
the hoped for support of the boy
cott.
New Open House regulations and
the OFF issue will probably be prime
topics of discussion at the Board of
Trustees meeting in San Francisco
today.

Informed sources indicate that no
final action is expected on allowing
women to live off campus, because of
the recently-ended rent boycott, but
that the issue will almost certainly
be debated.
The Committee of Fifteen open
house recommendations may well be
accepted, however, especially in light
of President Sterling's remarks on
open house to the trustees.
Dean Lyman said that the matter
is "not on agenda for tomorrow . . .
but I'm sure there will not be an in
definite delay ... I can't say precisely
when the issue will come up but it will
be in the near future."
