When four
nice boys
Go Apeâ€”
The
Monkees
There's Monkee gum, Monkee
caps, Monkee boots, Monkee
pants, two hit Monkee singles,
over 3 million copies of the
Monkees' first album and soon
there may be Monkee depart
ments in over 1,600 stores.
However, the Saturday Eve
ning Post report on America's
homegrown Beatles shows
that being a Monkee is not
quite as much fun as a barrel
of monkeys. Their records
were "prefabricated" and, ac
cording to Monkee Mike Nes
mith, "totally dishonest.. .the
music had nothing to do with
us." But Monkees owner and
creator, Screen Gems, has big
ger problems than its stars'
disenchantment. It's wonder
ing how the fans will react
when they discover that the
Monkee sound isn't really their
own. Then there's a reported
$6.85-million lawsuit charging
that the Monkees TV show for
mat was stolen. And there's
the question of whether Eng
land's Beatles will yell foul.
But otherwise . . .
In the same issue read a
major Post report on America's
sex-crime rate, the world's
highest, and what's being done
about it. That's the January 28
issue of The Saturday Evening
Post. Get your copy today.
