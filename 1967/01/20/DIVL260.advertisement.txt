Look into our
future and yours
At Ford Motor Company, the
electric car, computerized
teaching machines, and
artificial limbs controlled by
the brain are much more
than hazy visions. And
the man who can help
us with these and other better
ideas has a real future here.
If your major is arts,
science or business. If
thinking ahead is one of your
skills. See your placement
office now and make a date
to meet the representative
from Ford Motor Company.
