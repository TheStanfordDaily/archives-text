Engineers and Scientists:
SAIL UNCHARTED SEAS
WITH PHILCH
Philco is committed to advancing the state of almost
every technical art —from engineering to manufactur
ing, from anti-weapons systems to underwater com
munications, from space age instrumentation to
home air conditioning. Because we are accustomed
to working in advance of everyone else, we don't
always know exactly where our course may take us
—except that it is forward. And we need bright,
creative, ambitious people to help take us there.
Some other facts about Philco: We are a major sub
sidiary of Ford Motor Company. We are a company
fast approaching S1 billion in annual sales, to con
sumer, industrial and government markets. We offer
stimulation, responsibility, and above all, a bright
future.
If you'd like to join us in a fast-paced, rewarding
career position, we'd like to talk to you. We will be
visting your campus on January 23 and 24. Contact
your Engineering Placement Office. Stop by and talk
to us about your future or write to College Relations,
Philco Corporation, C & Tioga Sts., Phila., Pa. 19134.
PHILCO WILL BE HERE ON JANUARY 23 AND 24
Career opportunities available on the East Coast, the Midwest, the
Southwest, the West Coast, and throughout the world.
