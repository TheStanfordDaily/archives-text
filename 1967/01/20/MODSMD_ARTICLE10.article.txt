# Thomson Calls For Innovations In Opera
## 
### 
A declamation of English opera
into a new theatrical species was
termed the salvation of American op
eratic theater by noted critic Virgil
Thomson.
Speaker at the final Leon S1 os s
Memorial Lecture in Dinkelspiel,
Thomson traced the development of
operatic forms, which he calls "Amer
ica's unrequited love."
Concluding the annual Sloss series
is tonight's concert by members of
Stanford's music department. Featur
ing the compositions of Virgil Thom
son, the program will present portions
of his opera, "The Mother Of Us All,"
written for a libretto by Gertrude
Stein. Open to the public, the program
begins at 8:30 in Dink.
Thomson contrasted the American
attitude towards operatic develop

ment to the era of the symphony. By
1937 there were more than 30 thou
sand orchestras and by the end of
the decade every symphony composer
was ready to meet the demands of
these new groups with "drawers of
symphonies composed, and eager to
write more."
Noting European operatic success
es, Thomson remarked that "Car
men" was shocking in it's time for
it's serious treatment of lower class
living. French grand opera was noted
for its distroica or philosophical con
tent, as in "William Tell," or its
"Faust."
When romantic opera was intro
duced to Russia in the 1840's, tech
nique of blending the words and mu
sic was mastered by the Church com
posers. Plots and stories developed to
meet the tastes on the American
stage. Thomson noted "opera has
existed in a world of post-card back
ground and calendar-art love. Our
Protestant background keeps play
wrights from speaking with the au
thority of poets or the seriousness of
novelists."
The result is a collection of timer
ous themes without edge. Thomson
cited the operetta of Gilbert and Sul
livan as the single instance of a
sparkling quality in the English opera,
resulting from exploiting the unique
tonal passages of the English lan
guage.
"Although Britten has a whopping
instinct for staging and sounds, his
works by contrast sound like stilted
translations," Thomson commented.
Americans' frustration with the pres
ent lies in the fact that European op
era lost vigor at the precise moment
that we sought to graft our specialized
demands on to the structure. Ameri
can audiences want opera, and get
instead repertory, routine and Sunday
School .The only way to gain an un
derstanding of text vocalization is by
participating in liturgical music.
The modern offshoots of this di
lemma are shown also on the modern
college campus. "Institutions now pay
lip-service to opera," Thomson con
tends, "yet remain oblivious to the
possibilities offered for development
in serious operatic theater."
"Nowhere can a student vocalize
a single note in English, or take a
course in the phonetics of English
singing."
