Legal problems of the poor
and the dynamics of student pro
test will be among the future
concerns of the Association of
American Law Schools, accord
ing to its president-elect, Prof.
Joseph T. Sneed of the Stanford
Law School.
"The association is interested
in helping its member schools
develop courses concerning the
problems of the underprivileged,

a group which encompasses
many above the subsistence
level," Prof. Sneed said in a
campus interview.
"This will include studies of
the legal offices similar to those
in Harlem, Philadelphia, and
elsewhere," he said.
The AALS will also study
extent to which students ca<:
contribute to improvement of
the administration of law
schools, Prof. Sneed said, and
"perhaps may concern itself
with the principles which ought
to govern student protest move
ments."
"We are now seeing forged
new techniques of political ac
tion," he said. "The technique
of protest has its own dynamics
which we must learn to under
stand."
"The legal needs of the poor
will breed another problem
how to supply enough lawyers
to satisfy the demand which
various governmental and pri
vate programs will bring," he
said.
One of the alternatives pos
sible will entail the use of lay
men with a limited knowledf
of law to serve some of the
needs, he suggested. This has
already happened in other areas
of the law: real estate men, ac
countants, and trust officers per
form functions which were once
performed by lawyers.
