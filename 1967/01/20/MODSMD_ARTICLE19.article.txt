# FARM HOSTS PARC, OREGON
## Ruggers, Wrestlers In Action Saturday 
### 
Stanford ruggers host an ex
perienced Palo Alto Rugby Club
tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. on the
Stanford rugby field. The In
dians pushed to a 16-8 win over
Sacramento State's stiff defense
last week in an auspicious sea
son opener.
Stanford wrestlers hope to
rebound from a tough meet
against San Jose State last
weekend, in which only two In
dians scored decision victories.
The University of Oregon,
AAWU runners up in 1966, hits
the Encina Gym mats at 1:30
Saturday.
Stanford's rugby victory last

weekend did not come easily.
Jeff Joseph and Leon Hartvick
son made good the Indians' only
two tries, and the accurate toe
of Mike Grace contributed the
rest of Stanford's 16 points.
Neal's Scrum Rules
The deciding factor was the
fine scrum play of Joe Neal,
Blaine Nye, and Eric DeGooyer,
who got the better of Sac State's
strong defense in the second
half.
Coach Pete Kmetovic was
pleased with the team effort
against Sac State, and antici
pates a hearty performance
against the Palo Alto Club.
Stanford's JV rugby team also
beat Sac State last weekend.
Leading the Braves to an 18-5
win were Doug Montgomery
with two scores and a standout
scrum effort by Gary Lofgren.

Two Junior Varsity games, be
ginning at 3:00, will follow the
varsity match .The "1" JV will
face Santa Clara's JV team,
while the "2" JV's tangle with
the Olympic Club "C" team.
Wrestlers Face Ducks
While the rugby squad tussles
with Palo Alto, the Indian wres
tlers will have their hands full
with Oregon's Duck pinfeathers.
Oregon's Curt Scott took
fourth place in the NCAA's last
year at 130 pounds. Scott is cur
rently fighting one division up,
137, and is certain trouble for
the Cards.
Captain Len Borchers (152)
and Burt Ambler (167) picked

up the only two Stanford victo
ries last week against San Jose.
John Suttle (147) lost a one
point decision and Bill Vogelpohl
dropped a close match at 160.
Big Men Hold Strength
Borchers, Ambler, Suttle, Vo
gelpohl, and 177 pound Bud Hol
lingbery have provided most of
the Indians' strength so far this
season. The Indians' lower
weight divisions have been hurt
by lack of experience.
Doug Gunesch will wrestle 160
against the Ducks, as Vogelpohl
aggravated a knee injury
against the Spartans.
The freshman team will wres
tle only four weights Saturday,

130, 137, 160, and 167. Van Ben
nett, Mike Pete, and Brian Smith
will wrestle the first three
weights, while Bill Ross, who
took a 4-2 decision against San
Jose, will wrestle the fourth.
