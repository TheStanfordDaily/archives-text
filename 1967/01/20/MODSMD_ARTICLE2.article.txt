# 30 TIME USER
## 'LSD Leads To Bondage' 
### 
LSD "leads to spiritual bondage, not
freedom," a 30-time user said last
night at Stanford.
Dr. Allan Cohen, a former research
er with Timothy Leary now a staff
researcher at the University of Cali
fornia-Berkeley, said he stopped tak
ing LSD a year and a half ago when
he realized it was "a fake."
While LSD is "powerful and dra
matic" in its effects, Dr. Cohen said
"it did not develop me spiritually one
bit and had no application to everyday
life."
As a member of a psychedelic com
munity, he and his colleagues thought
they were "less dependent, more pur
poseful, and more loving," Dr. Cohen
related. But after "fantastic" group
sessions, "if someone didn't do the
dishes, the whole place became chaos."
"The greatest justification for LSD
is religious," he noted. Backers claim
it's okay to risk permanent damage,
"to freak out to see God."

In actuality, he said, LSD leads to
"spiritual egotism," not listening to
others. Users "think they're transcend
ing egos, when they're actually ex
tending them," Dr. Cohen added.
"They're very rarely willing to accept
any master."
Leary's claims about the mystic
powers of LSD were not checked with
recognized mystic leaders because
"real living mystics don't have a big
PR game going," he added.
His own checks with those individ
uals whose daily lives embody the
principles of mysticism were "unani
mous" in condemning LSD as a short
cut to the mystic state, he declared.
LSD can be a "powerful insight
tool" for alcoholics and may help
some individuals discover another way
of looking at themselves, he con
ceded, but what counts is what the
individual does to change and im
prove his daily life.
Rev. Robert Morse, rector of St.
Peter's Episcopal Church, Oakland,

said LSD's "sacrament of solitude"
and introspection contrasts sharply
with Christian mysticism, "a total af
firmation of life."
He said the spread of psychedelics
points up the failure of organized
Christianity to provide the individual
a mystic experience. "We've lost the
original concept of the Christian revo
lution, which was the sense of inter
personal love."
Jan Marinisen of the American
Friends Service Committee said mod
ern society places too much emphasis
on the intellectual side of religion, too
little on the subjective experience.
"I have a hard time distinguishing
between the experience under the
mushroom of psychedelics with the
experience under the mushroom of
Hiroshima," he declared.
