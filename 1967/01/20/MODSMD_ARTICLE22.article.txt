# Indian Swimmers Dominate Strong AA WU's Rankings
## 
### 
Stanford swimmers, with Greg
Buckingham in the lead, domi
nated last week's AAWU swim
ming rankings. Stanford placed
three men among the top six in
nearly every event, and boasts
the number one man in 7 of the
12 events. Buckingham leads
four.
The AAWU will probably place
three teams—Stanford, USC,
and UCLA—in the top four at
the NCAA championships March
23, and must qualify as the
strongest swimming conference
in the nation by far.
Buckingham has posted the
top marks in the 200 free, 500
free, 200 individual medley, and
shares the lead (and the NCAA
record) for the 1000 free with
UCLA's world record holder,
Mike Burton.
Wednesday, as part of a 4000
yard workout, Buckingham hit
two 400 IM races at 4:16 and
4:17. The NCAA record is 4:16.4.
Three More Firsts
Luis Nicolao holds the top spot
in the 200 butterfly and Pete
Siebert has swum the fastest
200 backstroke so far. The Stan
ford freestyle relay ranks first,
and the medley relay second.
UCLA's phenomenal sprinter,
Zac Zorn, dominates the 50 and
100 freestyle, as he may all sea
son.
Stanford sprinters, who have
been doing Jim Gaughran's
heavy, 7000 yard a day workout
schedule, have not rested long
enough for their sprint times to
drop. Their time will come when

the chips are down against USC
and UCLA in dual meets Feb.
17-18, and in the NCAA's.
