# 'Beggar's Opera' Is Lean On Laughs
## 
### CURTISS B. KECK Entertainment Editor 
Opening Winter Quarter's thea
trical pursuits, the Stanford
Repertory Theatre tackled John
Cay's tough-to-produce "Beg
gar's Opera." Competent acting
and wonderful music, sets, and
costumes went into the produc
tion which, nonetheless, for lack
of zing and humor, made for a
dull evening at the opera.
"Beggar's Opera" is a tough
comedy to produce because (Jay's
humor so largely depends on
language, as opposed to situa
tion or slapstick in other come
dies. In the first act, the lines
were frustratingly unintelligible,
even to this reviewer wh > had
read the play the night before.
And the songs, many of which
Wright omitted in the produc
tion, were seldom understand
able.
Room For Improvement
This failing, granted, can he
attributed to the archaic nature
of Gay's phraseology, w hi eh
meant all the more that the ac
tor's had to enunciate precisely
and slowly in the first few
scenes to accustom the audi
ence's ear to the 18th century
language. This the actor: - , did not
do and consequently the first
several scenes and almost all the
songs were lost. And the audi
ence who were not familiar with
Gay' stale squirmed in bewilder
ment.
At the outset, Paul Richards
developed the character of Mac
heath as that of the comically
romantic, bumbling buffoon—a

characterization Gay clearly did
not intend. Rather, John Gay
created the capable and laugh
able rogue who wasn't at all
above peeking under one skirt
while maneuvering the stays on
another.
When Macheath fashions his
lies to quell his mistresses' fiery
temperaments, his narcotic elo
quence is supposed to be believa
ble. Instead, .Richards' mocking,
and later, detached, intonations
made incredulity the order of
the evening. When Richards
landed in a comic scene (among
others his one-man, preeoital or
gy with Drury Lane's dominion
daine, en masse), he was a very
funny man indeed. Mr. Richards
as an occasionally misguided ac
tor and as a « hant<-ur horrible
need take a back row balcony
seat to no one; for at his best
he is no worse than the super
stars.
As Peachum, the black-market
collector-vendor of his gang's ill
gotten loot, Paul Winfield turned
in a highly credible perform
ance. The elegance with which
he concocted and carried out his
greedy schemes invested a near
nobility to the character of ne
farious Pechum.
Kaph' l Excelled
No less a fine performance
ran be credited to Jerome Ra
phel who played Lor kit, partner
in treachery to Peachum a n d
chief turnkey at Newgate pris
on.
Peachum's daughter and
sinned-against spouse of Mac
heath, Polly had an accom

plished actress in Carol Andro
sky to fill her skirts. When Miss
Androsky made her first en
trance onto the stage, she shone
wonderfully. Her bucolic good
looks and the confidence of hur
delivery distinguished her for a
fine performance. Miss Andro
sky's gusty, operatic, soprano
voice registered tlie best quality
of the lot; but her singing lines,
and this booby prize she will
have to share with Mr. Richard-,
was near to undecipherable. Di
rector John Wright must not
have warned her not to take the
title of the play at face value.
Girls will be girls.
Sung Keaiitifully
Ruth Hunt was was perfect as
the lovely Miss Lucy Lockit, for
lorn and self-proclaimed lover
of that astoundingly inexhausti
ble Macheath. As a songstress,
although her voice was a little
weak, especially in contrast to
Miss Androsky's, Miss Hunt arti
culated her words and sung
them beautifully.
Jane Hoffman, as Peachum's
wife and Polly's fuzzy brained
mother, hammed it up with plen
ty of pickle relish in her couple
of scenes at the beginning. On
rye, please, Miss Hoffman.
Magnificent Costuming
Dwight Richard Odle's stage
setting of London's Drury Lane
was artful, provocative imagi
native, versatile, and, at all
times, added to the mood of the
play.
Kudos to Miss Carolyn Parker
for her magnificent costuming.
Peachum's costume, especially,

was classic. Miss Parker had the
scurilous old prolligate bedecked
m powdered periwig, swathed in
a sumptuous, gold lame frock
coat, and gloved with enormous
jewels.
The women's clothing was lit
tle the less fetching. What with
the passel of bodiced busoms
pushed in and up, up, almost
all into sight, and the floor
length j nv ns, draped from pad
ded hips and rustling outside a
sheaf of pet t i c o a t s. surely
seemed cases in point to argu
ments for and against the con
troversy over which female gar
mets most awake dormant male
instincts: what catches the lure
or what escapes the eye. Argu
ments aside, it was tormentfully
easy for this reviewer to em
pat hsize with Macheath as he
raved, "I must have women!
There is nothing unbends the
mind like them. . .
Makeup consultant, Barbara
Hi ken could have bleached Paul
Winfleld's skin slightly. Al
though Winfield was superb in
the part of Peachum, a part
which no other SRT actor could
have handled so deftly, the part
did not call for a Negro. The
fact that Peachum was a Negro
in the production was a hang
up, especially for those who were
unfamiliar with the play, in that
some of the audience gave im
mediate significance to the color
of Peachum's skin.
Spanish or Scotish
Also Mr. Richards' swarthy
complexion and curly black hair

gave him more the appearance
of a Castilian gypsy than a bri
gand of Scotish highland tame.
Mr. Richards looked particularly
odd saddled in a tartan kilt.
When Macheath bade his co
terie of strumpets, "if music be
the food of love, play on," he be
spoke why hardly anyone, I am
sure, quit the theater with a
hungry heart. Although the mu
sic, under the direction of Isaiah
Jackson, may not have been
spectacular nor remarkably ori
ginal, the jaunty, smothered tin
kles of the harpsicord arrange
ments added a cheerful gaiety to
the comedy. 1 happily noted that
the orchestra withstood what no
doubt was a gnawing urge to do
a cello and harpsicord rendition
of "Mac The Knife" (for which
Bobby Darin cribbed characters
like Macheath, Suky Tawdry,
little Miss Molly Brazen, et al).
Anticipation, Please
Director Wright might have
anticipated the audience's confu
sion at first with Gay's 18 cen
tury dialogue and included in
his program notes a brief synop
sis of the comedy.
The pantomine-hour in the
Prologue should have been re
duced. Mrs. Peach urn's over the
knee, pit-pat spanking of Polly;
Peachum's rassling bouts with
his daughter; and the clumsy in
ference of Mrs. Peachum's ri
baldry with Filch were spices
which John Gay's original did
well without. Minor flaws, to be
assured, but flaws nevertheless.
