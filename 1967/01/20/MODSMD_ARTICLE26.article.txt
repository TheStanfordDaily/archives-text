## Creativity: LSJU Expects Something For Nothing 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
The need for more creative
students at Stanford, as ex
pressed by Professor Guerard
and Professor Boyle (Daily, Jan
uary 19) is evident. But both
failed to recognize the most im
portant obstacle to that goal:
the nature of Stanford itself.
The question is, what does this
university offer the creative per
son.
Stanford is primarily a profes
sional school. Most students are
preparing for careers in medi
cine, law, teaching, or engineer
ing. This is not to deny that
these disciplines are creative, or
that Stanford can never develop
further in the arts. But the
need to improve those facilities
which would attract creative peo
ple must not be overlooked.
The art, music, and English
departments provide a fine in
troduction and historic perspec
tive to their respective fields, but
their endeavors in creative
areas, in the processes of ex
perimentation and origination,
are less than adequate. For ex
ample, many student musicians
must travel to San Francisco
for instruction from symphony
members. The fact is that the
young person planning a career
as a practicing artist, musician,
or writer does not want to come
to Stanford.
Messrs. Guerard and Boyle
should be applauded for their
efforts to modify the admissions
policy, which is the key to any
basic change in the character
of the university. But they might
also, I think, take a critical look
at their own departments to see
in what ways creative students
could be encouraged to enter
Stanford.

• Europe On $700
Editor, The Dally:
I wish to clarify an inaccuracy
In the Daily's report on the poll
of students of Stanford in Ger
many ,Group XVII. Mr. Hanson
has written: "The 47 who partici
pated in the survey had an av
erage expenditure, excluding
room, board, tuition, and flight
home, of $943. The Overseas
Campus office estimate is still
$600 for the six months." The
latest edition (October 24, 1966)
of our Student Handbook states:
"It is, of course, difficult to esti
mate precisely the total cost of
independent travel and personal
needs of the student while in
Europe. A modest estimate of
the amount that students should
have available for personal ex
penses and holiday travel over
the six months would be about

$700 .This total . . . does not
cover return fare."
First of all, our estimate is
no longer $600. Second, our
"modest estimate" is not in
tended to cover such items as
gifts for family and friends or
personal acquisitions. It is our
opinion—and mine as a former
student overseas—that $700 is
quite ample to cover personal
necessities, required field trip
costs ,and moderate weekend
travel overseas. Even if one
spends $250 on the three-week
break, a total of $250 still re
mains for each quarter. The
student who budgets this money
carefully should be able to man
age without handicap. In brief,
we are not attempting to assert
that $700 is the average expense
incurred by each student, but
rather that the average student
who conserves his resources can
expect to find life more than
endurable with our modest es
timate.

In the same letter in which he
links my name and the name
of Nathaniel Weyl to that of
Alfred Rosenberg, Ole Holsti ob
jects to "slander and name-call
ing". Apparently he is persuaded
that smear tactics are entirely
in order only if Holsti uses
them.
After several experiences with
Holsti's letters to various edi
tors, I have concluded that he
is quoting dishonestly and stu
pidly. Since an objective, rea

him is impossible, he is best

ignored as a minor pain in the

• Self-Indulgence
Editor, The Daily:
Professor Shockley is free to
adopt any theory of race and
intelligence however inadequate
and archaic it may be. However,
when he addresses a partisan
audience on this issue well out
side his field of specialized com
petence, he foregoes his claim
to a polite, scientific reception.
His choice of audience and topic
indicates that Professor Shock
ley was indulging his own ra
cial sentiments and those of his
sponsors rather than seeking to
contribute to knowledge.
Particularly in the light of
the inflammatory nature of his
remarks, one would have ex
pected a scientist to adress him
self to other scientists rather
than to a club of businessmen

known to disapprove of social
welfare measures. But, Profes
sor Shockley could hardly have
secured from a concerned scien
tific forum an invitation to speak
on this topic so far removed
from his competence. Nor would
he have dared to submit to a
knowledgeable audience his vul
garian's Darwinism. To fail to
perceive the polemical purposes
of his remarks would be an in
dulgence in wishful thinking.

Editor, The Daily:
So the SDS opposes the draft
"because it is a coercive and
intimidating way by which a
government is able to effect for
eign and domestic policies
against the interests of its citi
zens." I think it's interesting
that these cause-happy liberals
are so appalled by the force of
Federal law. But it's rather dis

couraging that the Students for
a Democratic Society don't see
that the civic interests, as far
as they can be democratically
determined in this society, have
repeatedly demanded the use of
the draft (as they do now).
Furthermore, it is quite ob
vious that the mere ability of a
government to effect policies
must comprise its ability to ef
fect both favorable and unfa
vorable policies, and that the
way to insure a wise choice is
not to relinquish the ability to
choose.

In a recent issue of The New

The tendency to attack anoth

Editor, The Daily:
The need for more creative
students at Stanford, as ex
pressed by Professor Guerard
and Professor Boyle (Daily, Jan
uary 19) is evident. But both
failed to recognize the most im
portant obstacle to that goal:
the nature of Stanford itself.
The question is, what does this
university offer the creative per
son.
Stanford is primarily a profes
sional school. Most students are
preparing for careers in medi
cine, law, teaching, or engineer
ing. This is not to deny that
these disciplines are creative, or
that Stanford can never develop
further in the arts. But the
need to improve those facilities
which would attract creative peo
ple must not be overlooked.
The art, music, and English
departments provide a fine in
troduction and historic perspec
tive to their respective fields, but
their endeavors in creative
areas, in the processes of ex
perimentation and origination,
are less than adequate. For ex
ample, many student musicians
must travel to San Francisco
for instruction from symphony
members. The fact is that the
young person planning a career
as a practicing artist, musician,
or writer does not want to come
to Stanford.
Messrs. Guerard and Boyle
should be applauded for their
efforts to modify the admissions
policy, which is the key to any
basic change in the character
of the university. But they might
also, I think, take a critical look
at their own departments to see

• Europe On $700
Editor, The Dally:
I wish to clarify an inaccuracy
In the Daily's report on the poll
of students of Stanford in Ger
many ,Group XVII. Mr. Hanson
has written: "The 47 who partici
pated in the survey had an av
erage expenditure, excluding
room, board, tuition, and flight
home, of $943. The Overseas
Campus office estimate is still
$600 for the six months." The
latest edition (October 24, 1966)
of our Student Handbook states:
"It is, of course, difficult to esti
mate precisely the total cost of
independent travel and personal
needs of the student while in
Europe. A modest estimate of
the amount that students should
have available for personal ex
penses and holiday travel over
the six months would be about

$700 .This total . . . does not
cover return fare."
First of all, our estimate is
no longer $600. Second, our
"modest estimate" is not in
tended to cover such items as
gifts for family and friends or
personal acquisitions. It is our
opinion—and mine as a former
student overseas—that $700 is
quite ample to cover personal
necessities, required field trip
costs ,and moderate weekend
travel overseas. Even if one
spends $250 on the three-week
break, a total of $250 still re
mains for each quarter. The
student who budgets this money
carefully should be able to man
age without handicap. In brief,
we are not attempting to assert
that $700 is the average expense
incurred by each student, but
rather that the average student
who conserves his resources can
expect to find life more than
endurable with our modest es

The need for more creative
students at Stanford, as ex
pressed by Professor Guerard
and Professor Boyle (Daily, Jan
uary 19) is evident. But both
failed to recognize the most im
portant obstacle to that goal:
the nature of Stanford itself.
The question is, what does this
university offer the creative per
son.
Stanford is primarily a profes
sional school. Most students are
preparing for careers in medi
cine, law, teaching, or engineer
ing. This is not to deny that
these disciplines are creative, or
that Stanford can never develop
further in the arts. But the
need to improve those facilities
which would attract creative peo
ple must not be overlooked.
The art, music, and English
departments provide a fine in
troduction and historic perspec
tive to their respective fields, but
their endeavors in creative
areas, in the processes of ex
perimentation and origination,
are less than adequate. For ex
ample, many student musicians
must travel to San Francisco
for instruction from symphony
members. The fact is that the
young person planning a career
as a practicing artist, musician,
or writer does not want to come
to Stanford.
Messrs. Guerard and Boyle
should be applauded for their

policy, which is the key to any

• Europe On $700
Editor, The Dally:
I wish to clarify an inaccuracy
In the Daily's report on the poll
of students of Stanford in Ger
many ,Group XVII. Mr. Hanson
has written: "The 47 who partici
pated in the survey had an av
erage expenditure, excluding
room, board, tuition, and flight
home, of $943. The Overseas
Campus office estimate is still
$600 for the six months." The
latest edition (October 24, 1966)
of our Student Handbook states:
"It is, of course, difficult to esti
mate precisely the total cost of
independent travel and personal
needs of the student while in
Europe. A modest estimate of
the amount that students should
have available for personal ex
penses and holiday travel over
the six months would be about

$700 .This total . . . does not
cover return fare."
First of all, our estimate is
no longer $600. Second, our
"modest estimate" is not in
tended to cover such items as
gifts for family and friends or
personal acquisitions. It is our
opinion—and mine as a former
student overseas—that $700 is
quite ample to cover personal
necessities, required field trip
costs ,and moderate weekend
travel overseas. Even if one
spends $250 on the three-week
break, a total of $250 still re
mains for each quarter. The
student who budgets this money
carefully should be able to man
age without handicap. In brief,
we are not attempting to assert
that $700 is the average expense
incurred by each student, but
rather that the average student
who conserves his resources can
expect to find life more than
endurable with our modest es

Editor, The Daily:
The need for more creative
students at Stanford, as ex
pressed by Professor Guerard
and Professor Boyle (Daily, Jan
uary 19) is evident. But both
failed to recognize the most im
portant obstacle to that goal:
the nature of Stanford itself.
The question is, what does this
university offer the creative per
son.
Stanford is primarily a profes
sional school. Most students are
preparing for careers in medi
cine, law, teaching, or engineer
ing. This is not to deny that
these disciplines are creative, or
that Stanford can never develop
further in the arts. But the
need to improve those facilities
which would attract creative peo
ple must not be overlooked.
The art, music, and English
departments provide a fine in
troduction and historic perspec
tive to their respective fields, but
their endeavors in creative
areas, in the processes of ex
perimentation and origination,
are less than adequate. For ex
ample, many student musicians
must travel to San Francisco
for instruction from symphony
members. The fact is that the
young person planning a career
as a practicing artist, musician,
or writer does not want to come
to Stanford.
Messrs. Guerard and Boyle
should be applauded for their
efforts to modify the admissions
policy, which is the key to any

• Europe On $700
Editor, The Dally:
I wish to clarify an inaccuracy
In the Daily's report on the poll
of students of Stanford in Ger
many ,Group XVII. Mr. Hanson
has written: "The 47 who partici
pated in the survey had an av
erage expenditure, excluding
room, board, tuition, and flight
home, of $943. The Overseas
Campus office estimate is still
$600 for the six months." The
latest edition (October 24, 1966)
of our Student Handbook states:
"It is, of course, difficult to esti
mate precisely the total cost of
independent travel and personal
needs of the student while in
Europe. A modest estimate of
the amount that students should
have available for personal ex
penses and holiday travel over
the six months would be about

$700 .This total . . . does not
cover return fare."
First of all, our estimate is
no longer $600. Second, our
"modest estimate" is not in
tended to cover such items as
gifts for family and friends or
personal acquisitions. It is our
opinion—and mine as a former
student overseas—that $700 is
quite ample to cover personal
necessities, required field trip
costs ,and moderate weekend
travel overseas. Even if one
spends $250 on the three-week
break, a total of $250 still re
mains for each quarter. The
student who budgets this money
carefully should be able to man
age without handicap. In brief,
we are not attempting to assert
that $700 is the average expense
incurred by each student, but
rather that the average student
who conserves his resources can
expect to find life more than

jects to "slander and name-call
ing". Apparently he is persuaded
that smear tactics are entirely
in order only if Holsti uses
them.
After several experiences with
Holsti's letters to various edi
tors, I have concluded that he
is quoting dishonestly and stu
pidly. Since an objective, rea
soned and factual debate with
him is impossible, he is best

ignored as a minor pain in the
behind.

• Self-Indulgence
Editor, The Daily:
Professor Shockley is free to
adopt any theory of race and
intelligence however inadequate
and archaic it may be. However,
when he addresses a partisan
audience on this issue well out
side his field of specialized com
petence, he foregoes his claim
to a polite, scientific reception.
His choice of audience and topic
indicates that Professor Shock
ley was indulging his own ra
cial sentiments and those of his
sponsors rather than seeking to
contribute to knowledge.
Particularly in the light of
the inflammatory nature of his
remarks, one would have ex
pected a scientist to adress him
self to other scientists rather
than to a club of businessmen

known to disapprove of social
welfare measures. But, Profes
sor Shockley could hardly have
secured from a concerned scien
tific forum an invitation to speak
on this topic so far removed
from his competence. Nor would
he have dared to submit to a
knowledgeable audience his vul
garian's Darwinism. To fail to
perceive the polemical purposes
of his remarks would be an in
dulgence in wishful thinking.

• Gung-Ho
Editor, The Daily:
So the SDS opposes the draft
"because it is a coercive and
intimidating way by which a
government is able to effect for
eign and domestic policies
against the interests of its citi
zens." I think it's interesting
that these cause-happy liberals
are so appalled by the force of
Federal law. But it's rather dis

couraging that the Students for
a Democratic Society don't see
that the civic interests, as far
as they can be democratically
determined in this society, have
repeatedly demanded the use of
the draft (as they do now).
Furthermore, it is quite ob
vious that the mere ability of a
government to effect policies
must comprise its ability to ef
fect both favorable and unfa
vorable policies, and that the
way to insure a wise choice is
not to relinquish the ability to
choose.

• Watch It
Editor, The Daily:
In a recent issue of The New
Republic the Correspondence
section carried an observation
that the Stanford community
might well ponder. It pointed up
the increasing disrespect and
downright rudeness with which

those of an opposing point of
view argue their case in public.
The tendency to attack anoth
er's mental faculties, emotional
outlook and moral attitudes
rather than to focus upon a logit
cal reconsideration of the issue,
based on other data or assump>
tions, is a sad indication of the
distemper of the times. It is par
ticularly distressing that facul»
ty members indulge in the abu
sive argumentum ad homlnem.
And if anyone doubts th 0
trend, we suggest another read
ing of the letters by Professof
Ole R. Holsti in the January 18
Dally and by Donn Scott SmitH
in the January 19 edition.
