# Faculty Initiative
## 
### 
During the past year and a half there has
been a steady stream of student criticism di
rected at the faculty's lack of initiative in dis
cussing the draft, classified research, and edu
cation. The action of the Academic Council last
spring indicated that a large segment of the
faculty could still be aroused over a controver
sial issue. But this response was mostly reac
tionâ€”and not initiative.
Thus the revival of school-wide meetings by
the Humanities and Sciences faculty comes as
a healthy reversal of this faculty disinterest
much of which can be traced to want of a man
ageable forum for discussion and information.
In the past twenty years the faculty has nearly
tripled in number, and at the same time the
effectiveness of the Academic Council as a
source of grass-roots faculty sentiment has been
diluted.
Presently the Humanities and Sciences fac
ulty members compose nearly half of the Aca
demic Council, and over three-fourths of Stan
ford undergraduates are registered in their de
partments. With departmental inclinations lean-

VAL

ing heavily toward "housekeeping chores," there
has been little discussion of issues cutting across
department lines and affecting undergraduate
education in general. And part of the problem,
one faculty member recently .noted, has been
Stanford's professorial population explosion
which has not allowed many of the newer fac
ulty members to become acquainted.
The impetus for the informal organization of
the School's faculty came from a group of thir
ty professors who wanted to look at several is
sues of particular interest to undergraduate edu
cation. Although the body will have no official
role in the University structure, the Dean of the
School has stated that he will regard the body's
recommendations as "madatorily advisory."
If the group's initial considerations, under
graduate admissions and overseas campuses, are
an indication of its concerns, the body will have
a definite contribution for undergraduate educa
tion. While President Sterling spoke earlier this
week of realigning faculty government, there
will continue to be a need for strong faculty
initiative on both a formal and informal basis.
