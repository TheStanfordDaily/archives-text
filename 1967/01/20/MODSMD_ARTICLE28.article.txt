# Two Minutes of Haight
## Tune In On The Revolution Of Love And Understanding 
### Tim Haigbt 
The recent public activities of
the Bay Area's hippies and the
growing impact of psychedelic
drugs is provoking a reaction
at Stanford.
The academic community
seems to be reacting viscerally
to such mottoes as, "turn on,
tune in, drop out," calling the
hippies cop-outs, escapists, or
addicts.
This is a mistake. The first
thifig one realizes on talking to
Timothy Leary is that his defi
nition of "drop out" is much dif
ferent from what many have as
sumed. Some seem to think that
it means to disengage from
everything connected with so
ciety and to enter some LSD
induced netherworld, never to
return. It doesn't.
Action First
Leary himself is a good ex
ample. Although he much pre
fers to be at home at Millbrook,
he is going around the country
to make money so that he
doesn't have to depend on mil
lionaires. He is fighting the nar
cotics laws through the courts,
for which he has a great re
spect. Many of his disciples are
sincerely contesting the draft on
religious grounds and having to
deal through channels.
The second mistake many
make in regarding the Haight-
Ashbury scene is that it is dang
erous. It is seen as the latest
symptom of unrest among
youth, to be kept in the same
hopper with juvenile delinquen
cy, beatnikism, and the new left.
It is called a threat.
The hippies really don't want
to threaten anybody. While their
verbalizing of concepts of love
may be more pure than all their
actions, they do not want to
hurt, overthrow, or even scare
anybody. This is not true, and
never was, of the new left.
There, action was directed at
changing society. For the hip
pies, the only way society must
be changed is to tolerate them.
Emotional Revolt
While this is in some ways
very self-centered, at least it
does not get the hippies into the
mess that activists arrive at
when the emphasis of their

movement becomes tactical in
stead of moral and the human
element is forgotten. The hippy
revolution is an emotional thing,
very much tied up with human
problems. Its historians will be
poets, not sociologists.
But perhaps the most import
ant thing that those of us who
do not desire to move to Haight-
Ashbury or Telegraph Avenue
should remember is that, to a
greater or lesser degree, the
hippie's search for beauty and
love and self-understanding is in
all of us.
Perhaps we do not choose to
use drugs as a road to serenity
or understanding, but we have
those needs, too. And in the
hustle of activism, and academ
ism, and being-on-the-way-to-the
top, it is very easy to forget the
beauty of some time to really
get to know yourself or other
people.
Forced Games
Richard Alpert calls these pre
occupations "external games."
The crux of the definition seems
to rest on the playing of these
games when we don't really en
joy them. We are driven to them
by demons, internal and exter
nal, that whisper about social
pressures, and what will others
think, and am I doing enough.

And they can destroy some
very beautiful people. These
aren't just work games, by the
way. Rushing a fraternity be
cause of the ego-involvement, or
trying to maintain a phony im
age around the dorm to impress
others, or smoking pot and tell
ing everybody, are just as ef
fective in keeping you from
gentleness, and empathy, and
love.
Beat The System
The hippies have chosen to re
ject more than we. Perhaps they
don't believe that one can render
unto Caesar as much as we do
here and still have time for
human pursuits. Many here
would disagree, and they would
be able to point to some pretty
exciting and beautiful people
around.
But can any of us really say
that we've beaten the rat race?
And what about after The
Farm? Some very adult deci
sions about how we wish to live
will have to be made. Maybe we
will not go to Haight-Ashbury,
but why not admit the little bit
of hippie in each of us and give
it its due? And, seeing the hip
pie in all of us, help them
against the slings and arrows
of all those people who feel
threatened.
