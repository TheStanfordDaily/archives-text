## Keep Our Children Pure, Dr. Sterling! 
### 
A most amazing thing is tak
ing place. The students at Le
land Stanford University, down
Palo Alto way, are acquiring an
inferiority complex.
They have been winners at
football over the University of
California for six years in a row,
but still they feel like losers.
It's because U. of C. has been
grabbing all the headlines, so
now the Cardinals are going to
send the girls into the lineup.
The lovely co-eds, egged on by
their big and manly fellow men
students, have decided to go on a
rent strike. Not because they
think the price charged for their
board and keep in the college
dormitories is too high, mind
you, but because the university
has always taken a dim view of
college girls having their own
cozy little apartments off the
campus.
No Ringers
The trouble is, down Stanford
way they don't have any ringers.
They don't have any bartenders
who have been booted off the

campus who can pick up the ball
and go for an end run.
The best they have is a stu
dent body president whose prin
cipal qualification is the ability
to grow whiskers, an achieve
ment that many an undergradu
ate cannot accomplish.
But this guy can't make yard
age. The best he can do is get
up and make speeches and say
"go get 'em girls."
Since Stanford university has
some of the newest and most
modern women's dormitories of
any campus in the country with
all the amenities for good living,
and within easy strolling dis
tance of classrooms, libraries,
and student recreation centers,
doesn't it seem strange that the
girls would wnnt to move miles
away to apartments that would
probably be more costly anr!
from where long commute.
would be necessary? And sine
most of these young ladies lik
to be where the boys are, doesn'i
it seem a little odd that they
would want to move far awry
from all the fraternities an<".
dormitories where the male of
the species hangs out?
Not to us, it doesn't!
Sin and Corruption
Forgive us if we seem to have
an evil mind, but girls in apart
ments far away from the cam
pus are also far away from 1'te
snooping eyes of supervisM
and house mothers. They don't
worry about being away from
the boys because they figure that
wherever they are the boys will
find them.
Well, come January 23 (sic)
when the rent bills for the spring
quarter fall due, the Stanford
girls are saying they will not pay
unless the university grants per
mission to members of the upper
classes to live off campus if
they choose to do so.
It appears to be a great op
portunity for President Wallace
Sterling to show these young
people there are other things to
be learned in college besides
calculus, French, geology, juris
prudence, etc.
A Firm Hand
Dr. Sterling could show them,
for instance, that there are such
things as discipline, recognition
of authority, and chain of com
mand. He could remind them
that most of them are there by
virtue of the sweat from some
one else's brow, and he could
also point out that because Stan
ford has a limited enrollment, at
least five deserving people were
denied admission for each one
of those who was admitted.
Time enough for them to have
their own apartments when they
are earning their own living. In
the meantime, we hope Presi
dent Sterling has the intestinal
fortitude to advise these lovely
young ladies that if they go off
campus they can just keep go
ing, because there won't be
room for them if they try to
come back.
