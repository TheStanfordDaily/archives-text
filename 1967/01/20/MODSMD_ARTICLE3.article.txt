## Trustees Invest In Corporations

Need a loan? Try the Board of
Trustees.
If you are a million dollar corpora
tion, pay high interest on investments,
and are considered "a good risk", the
investments committee of the Board
may well consider your problems.
Monday's Wall Street Journal re
ported one investment of this kind in
their coverage of the financing in
volved in the Ling-Temco-Vought Inc.
takeover of Wilson and Co.
Ling-Temco, an aerospace and elec
tronics corporation based in Dallas
needed $70 million in order to take
over Wilson and Co., a meat-packing
plant in Chicago.
The firm managed to get the funds
from two major sources, N. M. Roths
child in Europe and Lehman Bros, in
New York. The tight money situation
in the United States has led them to
seek funds overseas and funds

in the United States which are sub
stantial and not taxed.
As reported in the Wall Street Jour
nal, commitments were obtained from
"a number of U.S. institutions, in
cluding university endowment funds
at Stanford and Wesley an universities
and some corporate pension funds."
Mr. Mike Merrill of Lehman Bros,
in San Francisco explained that the
process of investing endowment mon
ey as in this case is practiced by
most major institutions and funds. In
addition to Stanford, he cited Har
vard, Wesleyan, and the University
of California as examples.
The terms of the loan were a 6%
per cent interest yield as well as war
rents. Warrents are the right to buy
stock within the period of the loan
at a set price. The price at which
Stanford may purchase Ling-Temco
is at 75 points and already the stock
is at 78 points and has reached 101
points on the stock market.

Disappointment was expressed yes
terday that the article ever appeared
in the Wall Street Journal with a
mention of Stanford because it will
result in many solicitors, seeking
funds from Stanford.
The funds for investments is han
dled by the standing Investment Com
mittee of the Board of Trustees. The
committee is in charge of investing
safely the endowment money, which
now stands between $2 and $3 mil
lion, for the highest profit.
The committee is presently com
posed of Chairman (of the Commit
tee) Edwin Littlefield, Vice-Chairman
Fred Merrill, Gardner Simons, David
Packard, and James Crafts, all trus
tees, and they have an office in San
Francisco.
