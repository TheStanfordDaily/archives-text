"The participants are not of one

ly saying get out of Vietnam at any
cost. However, we dislike war in
tensely and feel there are other ways
of reaching an honorable settlement
than through armed conflict," said
Dean Napier in a recent interview.
Napier stressed the point that "we
can't talk peace without ceasing the
bombing for a while."
He added, "Th: meeting will dem
onstrate the concern of men who
bear positions of responsibility within

organized religion" for a war which
is receiving "vastly diminishing sup
port among the American people."
The Dean of the Chapel went on to
explain that the members of Con
cerned Clergy for Vietnam were
"aware of the United States commit
ment" in South Vietnam; but they
were also "acutely aware" that few
nations supported the United States'
stand in the current war.
Emphasizing the group's concern
for "exploring ways not yet explored"
to end the conflict, Napier reaffirmed
that the first step was "to hold off
bombing."
"We also need to give the North
Vietnamese a chance to save face,"
he concluded.
If the current student-initiated col
lection drive is successful, Associate
Professor of Religion Michael J. No
vak will accompany Napier and
Brown to Washington.
