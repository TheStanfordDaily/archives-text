# Forstenzer To LASSU: Student Activism Needed
## 
### SUZETTE LEITH 
"Things can't get done, because no
one is afraid of us ... (the Administra
tion) won't give us anything until they
start to shake a little," stated Speaker

Tom Forstenzer last night in his re
port to the Legislature.
Forstenzer's report centered around
the need for student action to achieve
various goals. Today, he said, "we're
not allowed to do more than advise."
"We're trusted to provide accurate
information, but we're not trusted to
provide analyses of this information."
Initiative
In his address, Forstenzer listed
basic issues as open house changes,
OFF, and the composition of the Pack
er committee.
At campuses where students have
succeeded in effecting significant
changes, Forstenzer reported, "there
was not only student initiative, but
other constituencies feared that stu
dents would follow up the initiative."
"In the absence of fear and threat
that students will act, administrations
remain complacent and passive," he
added.
Stanford students, Forstenzer con
tinued, have historically been quiet.
"They have been passive and happy
that they are attending a prestige uni
versity.
"Now, however, things are changing,
Stanford is more an image of pres
tige.' "
Community Of Scholars
Forstenzer attributed much of the
passiveness to the "diffuseness of liv
ing conditions and of education itself."
"There is a lack of a serious com
munity of scholars" on the campus
with "nothing to draw together and
bring forth basic student viewpoints."
Legislature, Forstenzer commented,
has been "much too quiet." "Any
action," he continued, "would reflect
not only on the issues but on future
relations between the University and
students."
"Students"
Forstenzer called appointment of
students to the Packer Committee by
President Sterling a "tactic." The rep
resentatives can only be called "stu
dents" because they are alive and take
courses here, he explained. "They can't
speak for the student body."
"He (President Sterling) must start
talking about the real educational
function of the university," Forsten
zer stated, "not just social problems."
"LASSU," he concluded, "is sup
posed to provide goods and services
to the student body. We must be in a
position to deliver."

In legislative action, LASSU asked
that student representatives to the
Packer committee to study educational
programs be appointed by the Presi
dent of the ASSU rather than by Presi
dent Sterling.
It was requested that students re
frain from applying and that an equal
number of students and faculty serve
on the committee.
Also, the Committee of Fifteen's re
port on open house hours changes was
approved as a by-laws change. An
amendment was added that students
in each living group re-vote on hours
seven days after the start of each quar
ter.
In addition, $500 was appropriated
as a loan to Roth House, $750 to the
Model United Nations, and $233.11 to
the Dally. An appropriation of $4737.30
for the Speech Association was re
ferred to the finance committee.

one is afraid of us ... (the Administra
tion) won't give us anything until they
start to shake a little," stated Speaker

Tom Forstenzer last night in his re
port to the Legislature.
Forstenzer's report centered around
the need for student action to achieve
various goals. Today, he said, "we're
not allowed to do more than advise."
"We're trusted to provide accurate
information, but we're not trusted to
provide analyses of this information."
Initiative
In his address, Forstenzer listed
basic issues as open house changes,
OFF, and the composition of the Pack
er committee.
At campuses where students have
succeeded in effecting significant
changes, Forstenzer reported, "there
was not only student initiative, but
other constituencies feared that stu
dents would follow up the initiative."
"In the absence of fear and threat
that students will act, administrations
remain complacent and passive," he
added.
Stanford students, Forstenzer con
tinued, have historically been quiet.
"They have been passive and happy
that they are attending a prestige uni
versity.
"Now, however, things are changing,
Stanford is more an image of pres
tige.' "
Community Of Scholars
Forstenzer attributed much of the
passiveness to the "diffuseness of liv
ing conditions and of education itself."
"There is a lack of a serious com
munity of scholars" on the campus
with "nothing to draw together and
bring forth basic student viewpoints."
Legislature, Forstenzer commented,
has been "much too quiet." "Any
action," he continued, "would reflect
not only on the issues but on future
relations between the University and
students."
"Students"
Forstenzer called appointment of
students to the Packer Committee by
President Sterling a "tactic." The rep
resentatives can only be called "stu
dents" because they are alive and take
courses here, he explained. "They can't
speak for the student body."
"He (President Sterling) must start
talking about the real educational
function of the university," Forsten
zer stated, "not just social problems."
"LASSU," he concluded, "is sup
posed to provide goods and services
to the student body. We must be in a
position to deliver."

In legislative action, LASSU asked
that student representatives to the
Packer committee to study educational
programs be appointed by the Presi
dent of the ASSU rather than by Presi
dent Sterling.
It was requested that students re
frain from applying and that an equal
number of students and faculty serve
on the committee.
Also, the Committee of Fifteen's re
port on open house hours changes was
approved as a by-laws change. An
amendment was added that students
in each living group re-vote on hours
seven days after the start of each quar
ter.
In addition, $500 was appropriated
as a loan to Roth House, $750 to the
Model United Nations, and $233.11 to
the Dally. An appropriation of $4737.30
for the Speech Association was re
ferred to the finance committee.
