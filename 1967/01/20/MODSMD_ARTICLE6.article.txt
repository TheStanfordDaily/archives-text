# Trustees Delay Consideration Of OFF, Open House
## 
### 
The Board of Trustees met yester
day but did not consider either the
new suggested Open House hours or
the OFF issue.
Provost Richard W. Lyman told
The Daily, "I can't say precisely when
the issue will come up but it will be
in the near future." He said he was
sure there would not be an indefinite
delay. Lyman mentioned that only
routine matters were discussed at
yesterday's meeting. He added that
some of the decisions reached yester
day could not be announced immedi
ately, for the persons affected would
have to be notified first.
The Board met at their San Fran
cisco office, on the top floor of the
Pacific Mutual Life Building.
