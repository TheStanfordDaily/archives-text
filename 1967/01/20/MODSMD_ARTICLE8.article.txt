# UC Regents: Freeze Lifted On Admission
## 
### 
BERKELEY (AP) — Gov. Ronald
Reagan and other University of Cali
fornia regents—squeezed between a
big state deficit and sweeping enroll
ment—voted today to keep the doors
open for eligible students and main
tain educational quality while trying
to cut expenses.
The Governor, facing mounting crit
icism over his economy proposals,
dropped one controversial plan. He
said he would restore $5 million to
finance year-around classes at UCLA
and Berkeley.
Reagan turned over his tuition plan
—which had touched off statewide
controversy—to a regents committee
for another month of study. The Uni
versity now has a fee plan but no
tuition.
"This is in no way a change in per
manent policy," Reagan said.
"We're talking about an emergency
situation. We may have to close down
our rate of improvement."
Reagan said he is calling on help
"from all citizens" to cut costs and
meet a $473 million budget deficit.
But he said economy will reduce the
deficit by only $200 million and the
rest will have to be made up by new
taxes.
Across the street, on the Berkeley
campus, a few hundred students stood
quietly at a rally protesting Reagan's
plans.
In the Regents' room, Reagan, a
Republican, joined the powerful Dem
ocrat, Assembly Speaker Jesse M. Un
ruh, in the resolution to quiet fears
that qualified students would be
turned away from U.C. by Reagan's
economy plans.
General policies of student admis
sion to the university provide that the
top 12.5 per cent of California high
school graduates are eligible for U.C.
Last week, word was spread of a
confidential memo from U.C. Presi
dent Clark Kerr to Chancellors of the
nine campuses freezing enrollment
procedures pending a discussion of
the financial crisis.
"The people of California have been
frightened into believing there are
going to be drastic changes in the
university system," Reagan told his
fellow board members.
Unruh, who proposed the resolu
tion, said, "all I'm trying to do is say
we are not suddenly closing the door
to massive numbers of students."

top 12.5 per cent of California high
school graduates are eligible for U.C.
Last week, word was spread of a
confidential memo from U.C. Presi
dent Clark Kerr to Chancellors of the
nine campuses freezing enrollment
procedures pending a discussion of
the financial crisis.
"The people of California have been
frightened into believing there are
going to be drastic changes in the
university system," Reagan told his
fellow board members.
Unruh, who proposed the resolu
tion, said, "all I'm trying to do is say
we are not suddenly closing the door
to massive numbers of students."
BERKELEY (AP) — Gov. Ronald
Reagan and other University of Cali
fornia regents—squeezed between a
big state deficit and sweeping enroll
ment—voted today to keep the doors
open for eligible students and main
tain educational quality while trying
to cut expenses.
The Governor, facing mounting crit
icism over his economy proposals,
dropped one controversial plan. He
said he would restore $5 million to
finance year-around classes at UCLA
and Berkeley.
Reagan turned over his tuition plan
—which had touched off statewide
controversy—to a regents committee
for another month of study. The Uni
versity now has a fee plan but no
tuition.
"This is in no way a change in per
manent policy," Reagan said.
"We're talking about an emergency
situation. We may have to close down
our rate of improvement."
Reagan said he is calling on help
"from all citizens" to cut costs and
meet a $473 million budget deficit.
But he said economy will reduce the
deficit by only $200 million and the
rest will have to be made up by new
taxes.
Across the street, on the Berkeley
campus, a few hundred students stood
quietly at a rally protesting Reagan's
plans.
In the Regents' room, Reagan, a
Republican, joined the powerful Dem
ocrat, Assembly Speaker Jesse M. Un
ruh, in the resolution to quiet fears
that qualified students would be
turned away from U.C. by Reagan's
economy plans.
General policies of student admis
sion to the university provide that the
top 12.5 per cent of California high
school graduates are eligible for U.C.
