# Overseas Students 'Scientifically' Selected
## 
### SUZETTE LEITH 
Twice a year approximately five hundred
names are posted in an office on inner quad;
overseas campus selections have been an
nounced.
The main principle of selection is widely
known; students are assigned to various cam
puses according to their slated preferences, up
perclass priority based on grade-point ave
rages and freshman on randomly selected
numbers.
Many finer points of the process, however,
are shrouded in myth, rumor, and misconcep
tion. Frequently misunderstood are grade
point cut-offs, procedure for differentiating be
tween actives and alternates, and schemes of
"beating the system" by listing only one cam
pus.
Ranking
Selection, as explained by Assistant to the
Director Bob Mamrdla, starts with the ranking
of all applicants. "Applications are immediately
segregated," he reported, into four categories:
upperclassmen, upperclass women, freshmen,
and freshman women. The two freshman
groups are ranked according to numbers drawn
for the applicants by the overseas campus
office. The choices of each applicant plus in
formation such as language training and com
ments from the application cards are noted
on the lists.
The two upperclass lists are similar, only

ranking is by cumlative grade-point average.
Students with the same grade-point are listed
alphebetically, and only grades received at
Stanford are recorded.
Quotas
Before selections are made, a number of
actives plus alternates for each campus is de
termined. Housing facilities at the campuses
govern both the total size of the groups and
the male-female ratios.
Because freshmen are chosen separately,
it is necessary to have a freshman quota for
each group. In the three older campuses, the
freshman total is based on the number of fresh
man in previous groups. In Britain and Aus
tria, it is determined by the per cent of fresh
men of those listing the campus as their first
choice.
As a check, it was found that in previous
groups at all five campuses, the per cent of
of first-choice applicants corres
ponded exceedingly well with the number of
freshmen who actually attended each session.
The number of alternates varies with each
group. "We play this by ear," stated Hamrdla.
"If a group has consistently been low on alter
nates, more will be chosen for the next ses
sion."
The final numbers, ten, include both actives
and alternates, with no differentiation as yet.
Next comes the process of selecting each
group. Assignment is based on preference

specified by the applicants. Starting at the
top of each ranked list, applicants are put in
their first choice groups. When a group is
filled, further applications for that campus are
automatically given their second, then third,
fourth, or fifth choice, if that many are listed.
If all a candidate's choices are filled, stated
Hamrdla, he is, for the time being, striken
from the list. It is not possible, then, to insure
assignment to a particular campus at a specific
time by only applying for that campus.
A group is considered "filled" when enough
students to fill both active and alternate
quotas are chosen.
No strict grade cut-off is imposed. Cut-offs
for various groups have varied from about
2.2 to 3.2, Hamrdla stated, depending on the
campus and the time.
Final Review
After preliminary selections have been made,
groups are reviewed by a committee composed
of representatives from the Overseas Cam
pus office, Dean of Students office, and the
faculty. Each applicant must be approved by
this committee, and it is here that actives are
differentiated from alternates.
In the vast majority of cases, preliminary
selections are approved by the committee. The
largest exception—and only time a specific
grade cut-off is used—is that all freshmen
with averages under 2.2 are subject to recon
sideration. According to Hamrdla, this practice

is "essentially the only reason" why a selection
is not approved.
Once a person is approved in committee, he
must be assigned either active or alternate
status. In choosing actives, sex ratios must
still be respected; however, freshmen are not
treated the same as upperclassmen.
Upperclassmen First
A common misconception is that actives
are chosen before alternates because of high
grade-point or, with freshmen, lottery num
bers. Grades, however, are only important in
the first step, assignment to campus, and have
"little to do with placement as an alternate,"
stated Hamrdla.
Instead, he continued, upperclassmen are
taken first, unless they have given specific rea
sons for wanting to be alternates instead.
Freshmen are then taken on the basis of
notations on their applications, with preference
given to those with hard-to-schedule majors
such as engineering, pre-med, and physics.
Secondary criteria such as recommendations
from residence directors and staff members,
language training, and freshman grades are
considered now. After all those with stated
reasons for being actives have been selected,
candidates are taken in the order in which
they were originally chosen.
Recommendations
Each application must be accompanied by
one recommendation from a current or form

er residence director, associate, or tutor, de
pending on the applicant's living group.
Questions on the recommendation sheet ask
mainly about the candidates emotional stability
and responsibility and any specific needs or
skills which would justify preferential con
siideration.
A new policy, initiated this quarter, requires
the applicant himself to arrange for his rec
commendation. Instructions and forms are
available in the overseas campus office.
According to Hamrdla, interviews or rec
ommendations other than the one required are
helpful "only insofar as they help a student
gain an idea of what his chances are—they
provide no extra plus factor." He added that
interviews are useful only when they bring
forth special reasons for immediate selection
—"and these reasons can just as easily be
noted on application cards."
Group-Switching
It is very rare that a student is allowed to
change groups once he is assigned. "We are
very reluctant to fool with active and alternate
lists once they're established," Hamrdla em
phasized. "All preferences should be indicated
on the application card." Changes are only
considered in "individual special cases" with
"legitimate academic reasons."
One areas of special cases cited was that of
a few junior transfers who wanted to go
abroad but were not enrolled at
Stanford in time to apply for cer
tain sessions. Because the next
sessions would take place after
their graduation, they were
placed on alternate lists. "We
don't w ant to discriminate
against transfers," Hamrdla
stated, yet he stressed that such
cases were very uncommon.
Students are rarely dropped
from a group once they have
been formally chosen. However,
"it is a long standing policy,"
Hamrdla stated, "for students
on probation to have their status
reviewed." Cases are studied on
an individual basis, and inter
views with both Dean Winbigler
and the Overseas Campus Office
are required.
Housing Facilities
The number selected for each
campus, as was mentioned
above, is based on facilities. At
present, the German campus
houses 40 men and 30 women;
Austria and Britain, 50 men and
30 women; and Italy, 46 men
and 42 women.
Eperiments have been con
ducted at Tours to determine the
best ratio for both selection and
actual living at the campus. The
original 40-40 raitio was changed
to the "Stanford ratio" of 52-28
to el i mate discrimination
against male applicants. The di
rectors in France found that the
new ration brought "too many
pressures on the women," ac
cording to Hamrdla, so it was
revised to 44-36, effective this
March.
The popularity of the cam
puses, from the applicant's point
of view, varies greatly. "No con
sistent pattern has emerged," of

first choice campuses, Hamrdla
stated. He added that courses to
be taught abroad more often in
fluence students than do the pr<
lessors accompanying various
groups.
Frosh lottery
The greatest change made re
cently in the selection process
was establishing the freshman
lottery. Previously all applicants
—freshmen and upperclassme..
• —were ranked by grades in
either the male or female list.
The large number of freshman
classes with deferred grades,
however, brought about the
change to random selection.
Hamrdla reported that he had
received "no single complain
other than 'hard luck' " concern
ing the lottery.
He added that, as of now,
random drawings will be used
only for freshmen and that this
year's freshmen will be re
ranked—by grades—at the be
ginning of next year.
No further alternations in the
process have been firmly decided
upon, he concluded; however,
many aspects of the system are
now under review.
Twice a year approximately five hundred
names are posted in an office on inner quad;
overseas campus selections have been an
nounced.
The main principle of selection is widely

—"and these reasons can just as easily be
noted on application cards."
Group-Switching
It is very rare that a student is allowed to
change groups once he is assigned. "We are
very reluctant to fool with active and alternate
lists once they're established," Hamrdla em
phasized. "All preferences should be indicated
on the application card." Changes are only
considered in "individual special cases" with
"legitimate academic reasons."
One areas of special cases cited was that of
a few junior transfers who wanted to go
abroad but were not enrolled at
Stanford in time to apply for cer
tain sessions. Because the next
sessions would take place after
their graduation, they were
placed on alternate lists. "We
don't w ant to discriminate
against transfers," Hamrdla
stated, yet he stressed that such
cases were very uncommon.
Students are rarely dropped
from a group once they have
been formally chosen. However,
"it is a long standing policy,"
Hamrdla stated, "for students
on probation to have their status
reviewed." Cases are studied on
an individual basis, and inter
views with both Dean Winbigler
and the Overseas Campus Office
are required.
Housing Facilities
The number selected for each
campus, as was mentioned
above, is based on facilities. At
present, the German campus
houses 40 men and 30 women;
Austria and Britain, 50 men and
30 women; and Italy, 46 men
and 42 women.
Eperiments have been con
ducted at Tours to determine the
best ratio for both selection and
actual living at the campus. The
original 40-40 raitio was changed
to the "Stanford ratio" of 52-28
to el i mate discrimination
against male applicants. The di
rectors in France found that the
new ration brought "too many
pressures on the women," ac
cording to Hamrdla, so it was
revised to 44-36, effective this
March.
The popularity of the cam
puses, from the applicant's point
of view, varies greatly. "No con
sistent pattern has emerged," of

first choice campuses, Hamrdla
stated. He added that courses to
be taught abroad more often in
fluence students than do the pr<
lessors accompanying various
groups.
Frosh lottery
The greatest change made re
cently in the selection process
was establishing the freshman
lottery. Previously all applicants
—freshmen and upperclassme..
• —were ranked by grades in
either the male or female list.
The large number of freshman
classes with deferred grades,
however, brought about the
change to random selection.
Hamrdla reported that he had
received "no single complain
other than 'hard luck' " concern
ing the lottery.
He added that, as of now,
random drawings will be used
only for freshmen and that this
year's freshmen will be re
ranked—by grades—at the be
ginning of next year.
No further alternations in the
process have been firmly decided
upon, he concluded; however,
many aspects of the system are
now under review.
Twice a year approximately five hundred
names are posted in an office on inner quad;
overseas campus selections have been an
nounced.
The main principle of selection is widely
known; students are assigned to various cam
puses according to their slated preferences, up
perclass priority based on grade-point ave
rages and freshman on randomly selected
numbers.
Many finer points of the process, however,
are shrouded in myth, rumor, and misconcep
tion. Frequently misunderstood are grade
point cut-offs, procedure for differentiating be
tween actives and alternates, and schemes of
"beating the system" by listing only one cam
pus.
Ranking
Selection, as explained by Assistant to the
Director Bob Mamrdla, starts with the ranking
of all applicants. "Applications are immediately
segregated," he reported, into four categories:
upperclassmen, upperclass women, freshmen,
and freshman women. The two freshman
groups are ranked according to numbers drawn
for the applicants by the overseas campus
office. The choices of each applicant plus in
formation such as language training and com
ments from the application cards are noted
on the lists.
The two upperclass lists are similar, only

ranking is by cumlative grade-point average.
Students with the same grade-point are listed
alphebetically, and only grades received at
Stanford are recorded.
Quotas
Before selections are made, a number of
actives plus alternates for each campus is de
termined. Housing facilities at the campuses
govern both the total size of the groups and
the male-female ratios.
Because freshmen are chosen separately,
it is necessary to have a freshman quota for
each group. In the three older campuses, the
freshman total is based on the number of fresh
man in previous groups. In Britain and Aus
tria, it is determined by the per cent of fresh
men of those listing the campus as their first
choice.
As a check, it was found that in previous
groups at all five campuses, the per cent of
of first-choice applicants corres
ponded exceedingly well with the number of
freshmen who actually attended each session.
The number of alternates varies with each
group. "We play this by ear," stated Hamrdla.
"If a group has consistently been low on alter
nates, more will be chosen for the next ses
sion."
The final numbers, ten, include both actives
and alternates, with no differentiation as yet.
Next comes the process of selecting each
group. Assignment is based on preference

specified by the applicants. Starting at the
top of each ranked list, applicants are put in
their first choice groups. When a group is
filled, further applications for that campus are
automatically given their second, then third,
fourth, or fifth choice, if that many are listed.
If all a candidate's choices are filled, stated
Hamrdla, he is, for the time being, striken
from the list. It is not possible, then, to insure
assignment to a particular campus at a specific
time by only applying for that campus.
A group is considered "filled" when enough
students to fill both active and alternate
quotas are chosen.
No strict grade cut-off is imposed. Cut-offs
for various groups have varied from about
2.2 to 3.2, Hamrdla stated, depending on the
campus and the time.
Final Review
After preliminary selections have been made,
groups are reviewed by a committee composed
of representatives from the Overseas Cam
pus office, Dean of Students office, and the
faculty. Each applicant must be approved by
this committee, and it is here that actives are
differentiated from alternates.
In the vast majority of cases, preliminary
selections are approved by the committee. The
largest exception—and only time a specific
grade cut-off is used—is that all freshmen
with averages under 2.2 are subject to recon
sideration. According to Hamrdla, this practice

is "essentially the only reason" why a selection
is not approved.
Once a person is approved in committee, he
must be assigned either active or alternate
status. In choosing actives, sex ratios must
still be respected; however, freshmen are not
treated the same as upperclassmen.
Upperclassmen First
A common misconception is that actives
are chosen before alternates because of high
grade-point or, with freshmen, lottery num
bers. Grades, however, are only important in
the first step, assignment to campus, and have
"little to do with placement as an alternate,"
stated Hamrdla.
Instead, he continued, upperclassmen are
taken first, unless they have given specific rea
sons for wanting to be alternates instead.
Freshmen are then taken on the basis of
notations on their applications, with preference
given to those with hard-to-schedule majors
such as engineering, pre-med, and physics.
Secondary criteria such as recommendations
from residence directors and staff members,
language training, and freshman grades are
considered now. After all those with stated
reasons for being actives have been selected,
candidates are taken in the order in which
they were originally chosen.
Recommendations
Each application must be accompanied by
one recommendation from a current or form

er residence director, associate, or tutor, de
pending on the applicant's living group.
Questions on the recommendation sheet ask
mainly about the candidates emotional stability
and responsibility and any specific needs or
skills which would justify preferential con
siideration.
A new policy, initiated this quarter, requires
the applicant himself to arrange for his rec
commendation. Instructions and forms are
available in the overseas campus office.
According to Hamrdla, interviews or rec
ommendations other than the one required are
helpful "only insofar as they help a student
gain an idea of what his chances are—they
provide no extra plus factor." He added that
interviews are useful only when they bring
forth special reasons for immediate selection
—"and these reasons can just as easily be
noted on application cards."

filled, further applications for that campus are
automatically given their second, then third,
fourth, or fifth choice, if that many are listed.
If all a candidate's choices are filled, stated
Hamrdla, he is, for the time being, striken
from the list. It is not possible, then, to insure
assignment to a particular campus at a specific
time by only applying for that campus.
A group is considered "filled" when enough
students to fill both active and alternate
quotas are chosen.
No strict grade cut-off is imposed. Cut-offs
for various groups have varied from about
2.2 to 3.2, Hamrdla stated, depending on the
campus and the time.
Final Review
After preliminary selections have been made,
groups are reviewed by a committee composed
of representatives from the Overseas Cam
pus office, Dean of Students office, and the
faculty. Each applicant must be approved by
this committee, and it is here that actives are
differentiated from alternates.
In the vast majority of cases, preliminary
selections are approved by the committee. The
largest exception—and only time a specific
grade cut-off is used—is that all freshmen
with averages under 2.2 are subject to recon
sideration. According to Hamrdla, this practice

is "essentially the only reason" why a selection
is not approved.
Once a person is approved in committee, he
must be assigned either active or alternate
status. In choosing actives, sex ratios must
still be respected; however, freshmen are not
treated the same as upperclassmen.
Upperclassmen First
A common misconception is that actives
are chosen before alternates because of high
grade-point or, with freshmen, lottery num
bers. Grades, however, are only important in
the first step, assignment to campus, and have
"little to do with placement as an alternate,"
stated Hamrdla.
Instead, he continued, upperclassmen are
taken first, unless they have given specific rea
sons for wanting to be alternates instead.
Freshmen are then taken on the basis of
notations on their applications, with preference
given to those with hard-to-schedule majors
such as engineering, pre-med, and physics.
Secondary criteria such as recommendations
from residence directors and staff members,
language training, and freshman grades are
considered now. After all those with stated
reasons for being actives have been selected,
candidates are taken in the order in which
they were originally chosen.
Recommendations
Each application must be accompanied by
one recommendation from a current or form

er residence director, associate, or tutor, de
pending on the applicant's living group.
Questions on the recommendation sheet ask
mainly about the candidates emotional stability
and responsibility and any specific needs or
skills which would justify preferential con
siideration.
A new policy, initiated this quarter, requires
the applicant himself to arrange for his rec
commendation. Instructions and forms are
available in the overseas campus office.
According to Hamrdla, interviews or rec
ommendations other than the one required are
helpful "only insofar as they help a student
gain an idea of what his chances are—they
provide no extra plus factor." He added that
interviews are useful only when they bring
forth special reasons for immediate selection
—"and these reasons can just as easily be
noted on application cards."
Group-Switching
It is very rare that a student is allowed to
change groups once he is assigned. "We are
very reluctant to fool with active and alternate
lists once they're established," Hamrdla em
phasized. "All preferences should be indicated
on the application card." Changes are only
considered in "individual special cases" with
"legitimate academic reasons."
One areas of special cases cited was that of
a few junior transfers who wanted to go
abroad but were not enrolled at
Stanford in time to apply for cer
tain sessions. Because the next
sessions would take place after
their graduation, they were
placed on alternate lists. "We
don't w ant to discriminate
against transfers," Hamrdla
stated, yet he stressed that such
cases were very uncommon.
Students are rarely dropped
from a group once they have
been formally chosen. However,
"it is a long standing policy,"
Hamrdla stated, "for students
on probation to have their status
reviewed." Cases are studied on
an individual basis, and inter
views with both Dean Winbigler
and the Overseas Campus Office
are required.
Housing Facilities
The number selected for each
campus, as was mentioned
above, is based on facilities. At
present, the German campus
houses 40 men and 30 women;
Austria and Britain, 50 men and
30 women; and Italy, 46 men
and 42 women.
Eperiments have been con
ducted at Tours to determine the
best ratio for both selection and
actual living at the campus. The
original 40-40 raitio was changed
to the "Stanford ratio" of 52-28
to el i mate discrimination
against male applicants. The di
rectors in France found that the
new ration brought "too many
pressures on the women," ac
cording to Hamrdla, so it was
revised to 44-36, effective this
March.
The popularity of the cam
puses, from the applicant's point
of view, varies greatly. "No con
sistent pattern has emerged," of

first choice campuses, Hamrdla
stated. He added that courses to
be taught abroad more often in
fluence students than do the pr<
lessors accompanying various
groups.
Frosh lottery
The greatest change made re
cently in the selection process
was establishing the freshman
lottery. Previously all applicants
—freshmen and upperclassme..
• —were ranked by grades in
either the male or female list.
The large number of freshman
classes with deferred grades,
however, brought about the
change to random selection.
Hamrdla reported that he had
received "no single complain
other than 'hard luck' " concern
ing the lottery.
He added that, as of now,
random drawings will be used
only for freshmen and that this
year's freshmen will be re
ranked—by grades—at the be
ginning of next year.
No further alternations in the
process have been firmly decided
upon, he concluded; however,
many aspects of the system are
now under review.
Twice a year approximately five hundred
names are posted in an office on inner quad;
overseas campus selections have been an
nounced.
The main principle of selection is widely
known; students are assigned to various cam
puses according to their slated preferences, up
perclass priority based on grade-point ave
rages and freshman on randomly selected
numbers.
Many finer points of the process, however,
are shrouded in myth, rumor, and misconcep
tion. Frequently misunderstood are grade
point cut-offs, procedure for differentiating be
tween actives and alternates, and schemes of
"beating the system" by listing only one cam
pus.
Ranking
Selection, as explained by Assistant to the
Director Bob Mamrdla, starts with the ranking
of all applicants. "Applications are immediately
segregated," he reported, into four categories:
upperclassmen, upperclass women, freshmen,
and freshman women. The two freshman
groups are ranked according to numbers drawn
for the applicants by the overseas campus
office. The choices of each applicant plus in
formation such as language training and com
ments from the application cards are noted
on the lists.
The two upperclass lists are similar, only

ranking is by cumlative grade-point average.
Students with the same grade-point are listed
alphebetically, and only grades received at
Stanford are recorded.
Quotas
Before selections are made, a number of
actives plus alternates for each campus is de
termined. Housing facilities at the campuses
govern both the total size of the groups and
the male-female ratios.
Because freshmen are chosen separately,
it is necessary to have a freshman quota for
each group. In the three older campuses, the
freshman total is based on the number of fresh
man in previous groups. In Britain and Aus
tria, it is determined by the per cent of fresh
men of those listing the campus as their first
choice.
As a check, it was found that in previous
groups at all five campuses, the per cent of
of first-choice applicants corres
ponded exceedingly well with the number of
freshmen who actually attended each session.
The number of alternates varies with each
group. "We play this by ear," stated Hamrdla.
"If a group has consistently been low on alter
nates, more will be chosen for the next ses
sion."
The final numbers, ten, include both actives
and alternates, with no differentiation as yet.
Next comes the process of selecting each
group. Assignment is based on preference

specified by the applicants. Starting at the
top of each ranked list, applicants are put in
their first choice groups. When a group is
filled, further applications for that campus are
automatically given their second, then third,
fourth, or fifth choice, if that many are listed.
If all a candidate's choices are filled, stated
Hamrdla, he is, for the time being, striken
from the list. It is not possible, then, to insure
assignment to a particular campus at a specific

students to fill both active and alternate

either the male or female list.
The large number of freshman
classes with deferred grades,
however, brought about the
change to random selection.
Hamrdla reported that he had
received "no single complain
other than 'hard luck' " concern
ing the lottery.
He added that, as of now,
random drawings will be used
only for freshmen and that this
year's freshmen will be re
ranked—by grades—at the be
ginning of next year.
No further alternations in the
process have been firmly decided
upon, he concluded; however,
many aspects of the system are
now under review.
Twice a year approximately five hundred
names are posted in an office on inner quad;
overseas campus selections have been an
nounced.
The main principle of selection is widely
known; students are assigned to various cam
puses according to their slated preferences, up
perclass priority based on grade-point ave
rages and freshman on randomly selected
numbers.
Many finer points of the process, however,
are shrouded in myth, rumor, and misconcep
tion. Frequently misunderstood are grade
point cut-offs, procedure for differentiating be
tween actives and alternates, and schemes of
"beating the system" by listing only one cam
pus.
Ranking
Selection, as explained by Assistant to the
Director Bob Mamrdla, starts with the ranking
of all applicants. "Applications are immediately
segregated," he reported, into four categories:
upperclassmen, upperclass women, freshmen,
and freshman women. The two freshman
groups are ranked according to numbers drawn
for the applicants by the overseas campus
office. The choices of each applicant plus in
formation such as language training and com
ments from the application cards are noted
on the lists.
The two upperclass lists are similar, only

ranking is by cumlative grade-point average.
Students with the same grade-point are listed
alphebetically, and only grades received at
Stanford are recorded.
Quotas
Before selections are made, a number of
actives plus alternates for each campus is de
termined. Housing facilities at the campuses
govern both the total size of the groups and
the male-female ratios.
Because freshmen are chosen separately,
it is necessary to have a freshman quota for
each group. In the three older campuses, the
freshman total is based on the number of fresh
man in previous groups. In Britain and Aus
tria, it is determined by the per cent of fresh
men of those listing the campus as their first
choice.
As a check, it was found that in previous
groups at all five campuses, the per cent of
of first-choice applicants corres
ponded exceedingly well with the number of
freshmen who actually attended each session.
The number of alternates varies with each
group. "We play this by ear," stated Hamrdla.
"If a group has consistently been low on alter
nates, more will be chosen for the next ses
sion."
The final numbers, ten, include both actives
and alternates, with no differentiation as yet.
Next comes the process of selecting each
group. Assignment is based on preference

specified by the applicants. Starting at the
top of each ranked list, applicants are put in
their first choice groups. When a group is
filled, further applications for that campus are
automatically given their second, then third,
fourth, or fifth choice, if that many are listed.
If all a candidate's choices are filled, stated
Hamrdla, he is, for the time being, striken
from the list. It is not possible, then, to insure
assignment to a particular campus at a specific
time by only applying for that campus.
A group is considered "filled" when enough
students to fill both active and alternate
quotas are chosen.
No strict grade cut-off is imposed. Cut-offs
for various groups have varied from about
2.2 to 3.2, Hamrdla stated, depending on the
campus and the time.
Final Review
After preliminary selections have been made,
groups are reviewed by a committee composed
of representatives from the Overseas Cam
pus office, Dean of Students office, and the
faculty. Each applicant must be approved by
this committee, and it is here that actives are
differentiated from alternates.
In the vast majority of cases, preliminary
selections are approved by the committee. The
largest exception—and only time a specific
grade cut-off is used—is that all freshmen
with averages under 2.2 are subject to recon
sideration. According to Hamrdla, this practice

is "essentially the only reason" why a selection
is not approved.
Once a person is approved in committee, he
must be assigned either active or alternate
status. In choosing actives, sex ratios must
still be respected; however, freshmen are not
treated the same as upperclassmen.
Upperclassmen First
A common misconception is that actives
are chosen before alternates because of high
grade-point or, with freshmen, lottery num
bers. Grades, however, are only important in
the first step, assignment to campus, and have
"little to do with placement as an alternate,"
stated Hamrdla.
Instead, he continued, upperclassmen are
taken first, unless they have given specific rea
sons for wanting to be alternates instead.
Freshmen are then taken on the basis of
notations on their applications, with preference
given to those with hard-to-schedule majors
such as engineering, pre-med, and physics.
Secondary criteria such as recommendations
from residence directors and staff members,
language training, and freshman grades are
considered now. After all those with stated
reasons for being actives have been selected,
candidates are taken in the order in which
they were originally chosen.
Recommendations
Each application must be accompanied by
one recommendation from a current or form

er residence director, associate, or tutor, de
pending on the applicant's living group.
Questions on the recommendation sheet ask
mainly about the candidates emotional stability
and responsibility and any specific needs or
skills which would justify preferential con
siideration.
A new policy, initiated this quarter, requires
the applicant himself to arrange for his rec
commendation. Instructions and forms are
available in the overseas campus office.
According to Hamrdla, interviews or rec
ommendations other than the one required are
helpful "only insofar as they help a student
gain an idea of what his chances are—they
provide no extra plus factor." He added that
interviews are useful only when they bring
forth special reasons for immediate selection
—"and these reasons can just as easily be
noted on application cards."
Group-Switching
It is very rare that a student is allowed to
change groups once he is assigned. "We are
very reluctant to fool with active and alternate
lists once they're established," Hamrdla em
phasized. "All preferences should be indicated
on the application card." Changes are only
considered in "individual special cases" with
"legitimate academic reasons."
One areas of special cases cited was that of
a few junior transfers who wanted to go
abroad but were not enrolled at
Stanford in time to apply for cer
tain sessions. Because the next
sessions would take place after
their graduation, they were
placed on alternate lists. "We
don't w ant to discriminate
against transfers," Hamrdla
stated, yet he stressed that such
cases were very uncommon.
Students are rarely dropped
from a group once they have
been formally chosen. However,
"it is a long standing policy,"
Hamrdla stated, "for students
on probation to have their status
reviewed." Cases are studied on
an individual basis, and inter
views with both Dean Winbigler
and the Overseas Campus Office
are required.
Housing Facilities
The number selected for each
campus, as was mentioned
above, is based on facilities. At
present, the German campus
houses 40 men and 30 women;
Austria and Britain, 50 men and
30 women; and Italy, 46 men
and 42 women.
Eperiments have been con
ducted at Tours to determine the
best ratio for both selection and
actual living at the campus. The
original 40-40 raitio was changed
to the "Stanford ratio" of 52-28
to el i mate discrimination
against male applicants. The di
rectors in France found that the
new ration brought "too many
pressures on the women," ac
cording to Hamrdla, so it was
revised to 44-36, effective this
March.
The popularity of the cam
puses, from the applicant's point
of view, varies greatly. "No con
sistent pattern has emerged," of

first choice campuses, Hamrdla
stated. He added that courses to
be taught abroad more often in
fluence students than do the pr<
lessors accompanying various
groups.
Frosh lottery
The greatest change made re
cently in the selection process
was establishing the freshman
lottery. Previously all applicants
—freshmen and upperclassme..
• —were ranked by grades in
either the male or female list.

Questions on the recommendation sheet ask
mainly about the candidates emotional stability
and responsibility and any specific needs or
skills which would justify preferential con
siideration.
A new policy, initiated this quarter, requires
the applicant himself to arrange for his rec
commendation. Instructions and forms are
available in the overseas campus office.
According to Hamrdla, interviews or rec
ommendations other than the one required are
helpful "only insofar as they help a student
gain an idea of what his chances are—they
provide no extra plus factor." He added that
interviews are useful only when they bring
forth special reasons for immediate selection
—"and these reasons can just as easily be
noted on application cards."
Group-Switching
It is very rare that a student is allowed to
change groups once he is assigned. "We are
very reluctant to fool with active and alternate
lists once they're established," Hamrdla em
phasized. "All preferences should be indicated
on the application card." Changes are only
considered in "individual special cases" with
"legitimate academic reasons."
One areas of special cases cited was that of
a few junior transfers who wanted to go
abroad but were not enrolled at
Stanford in time to apply for cer
tain sessions. Because the next
sessions would take place after
their graduation, they were
placed on alternate lists. "We
don't w ant to discriminate
against transfers," Hamrdla
stated, yet he stressed that such
cases were very uncommon.
Students are rarely dropped
from a group once they have
been formally chosen. However,
"it is a long standing policy,"
Hamrdla stated, "for students
on probation to have their status
reviewed." Cases are studied on
an individual basis, and inter
views with both Dean Winbigler
and the Overseas Campus Office
are required.
Housing Facilities
The number selected for each
campus, as was mentioned
above, is based on facilities. At
present, the German campus
houses 40 men and 30 women;
Austria and Britain, 50 men and
30 women; and Italy, 46 men
and 42 women.
Eperiments have been con
ducted at Tours to determine the
best ratio for both selection and
actual living at the campus. The
original 40-40 raitio was changed
to the "Stanford ratio" of 52-28
to el i mate discrimination
against male applicants. The di
rectors in France found that the
new ration brought "too many
pressures on the women," ac
cording to Hamrdla, so it was
revised to 44-36, effective this
March.
The popularity of the cam
puses, from the applicant's point
of view, varies greatly. "No con
sistent pattern has emerged," of

first choice campuses, Hamrdla
stated. He added that courses to
be taught abroad more often in
fluence students than do the pr<
lessors accompanying various
groups.
Frosh lottery
The greatest change made re
cently in the selection process
was establishing the freshman
lottery. Previously all applicants
—freshmen and upperclassme..
• —were ranked by grades in
either the male or female list.
The large number of freshman
classes with deferred grades,
however, brought about the
change to random selection.
Hamrdla reported that he had
received "no single complain
other than 'hard luck' " concern
ing the lottery.
He added that, as of now,
random drawings will be used
only for freshmen and that this
year's freshmen will be re
ranked—by grades—at the be
ginning of next year.
No further alternations in the
process have been firmly decided
upon, he concluded; however,
many aspects of the system are
now under review.
Twice a year approximately five hundred
names are posted in an office on inner quad;
overseas campus selections have been an
nounced.
The main principle of selection is widely
known; students are assigned to various cam
puses according to their slated preferences, up
perclass priority based on grade-point ave
rages and freshman on randomly selected
numbers.
Many finer points of the process, however,
are shrouded in myth, rumor, and misconcep
tion. Frequently misunderstood are grade
point cut-offs, procedure for differentiating be
tween actives and alternates, and schemes of
"beating the system" by listing only one cam
pus.
Ranking
Selection, as explained by Assistant to the
Director Bob Mamrdla, starts with the ranking
of all applicants. "Applications are immediately
segregated," he reported, into four categories:
upperclassmen, upperclass women, freshmen,
and freshman women. The two freshman
groups are ranked according to numbers drawn
for the applicants by the overseas campus
office. The choices of each applicant plus in
formation such as language training and com
ments from the application cards are noted
on the lists.
The two upperclass lists are similar, only

ranking is by cumlative grade-point average.
Students with the same grade-point are listed
alphebetically, and only grades received at
Stanford are recorded.
Quotas
Before selections are made, a number of
actives plus alternates for each campus is de
termined. Housing facilities at the campuses
govern both the total size of the groups and
the male-female ratios.
Because freshmen are chosen separately,
it is necessary to have a freshman quota for
each group. In the three older campuses, the
freshman total is based on the number of fresh
man in previous groups. In Britain and Aus
tria, it is determined by the per cent of fresh
men of those listing the campus as their first
choice.
As a check, it was found that in previous
groups at all five campuses, the per cent of
of first-choice applicants corres
ponded exceedingly well with the number of
freshmen who actually attended each session.
The number of alternates varies with each
group. "We play this by ear," stated Hamrdla.
"If a group has consistently been low on alter
nates, more will be chosen for the next ses
sion."
The final numbers, ten, include both actives
and alternates, with no differentiation as yet.
Next comes the process of selecting each
group. Assignment is based on preference

specified by the applicants. Starting at the
top of each ranked list, applicants are put in
their first choice groups. When a group is
filled, further applications for that campus are
automatically given their second, then third,
fourth, or fifth choice, if that many are listed.
If all a candidate's choices are filled, stated
Hamrdla, he is, for the time being, striken
from the list. It is not possible, then, to insure
assignment to a particular campus at a specific
time by only applying for that campus.
A group is considered "filled" when enough
students to fill both active and alternate
quotas are chosen.
No strict grade cut-off is imposed. Cut-offs
for various groups have varied from about
2.2 to 3.2, Hamrdla stated, depending on the
campus and the time.
Final Review
After preliminary selections have been made,
groups are reviewed by a committee composed
of representatives from the Overseas Cam
pus office, Dean of Students office, and the
faculty. Each applicant must be approved by
this committee, and it is here that actives are
differentiated from alternates.
In the vast majority of cases, preliminary
selections are approved by the committee. The
largest exception—and only time a specific
grade cut-off is used—is that all freshmen
with averages under 2.2 are subject to recon
sideration. According to Hamrdla, this practice

is "essentially the only reason" why a selection
is not approved.
Once a person is approved in committee, he
must be assigned either active or alternate
status. In choosing actives, sex ratios must
still be respected; however, freshmen are not
treated the same as upperclassmen.
Upperclassmen First
A common misconception is that actives
are chosen before alternates because of high
grade-point or, with freshmen, lottery num
bers. Grades, however, are only important in
the first step, assignment to campus, and have
"little to do with placement as an alternate,"
stated Hamrdla.
Instead, he continued, upperclassmen are
taken first, unless they have given specific rea
sons for wanting to be alternates instead.
Freshmen are then taken on the basis of
notations on their applications, with preference
given to those with hard-to-schedule majors
such as engineering, pre-med, and physics.
Secondary criteria such as recommendations
from residence directors and staff members,
language training, and freshman grades are
considered now. After all those with stated
reasons for being actives have been selected,
candidates are taken in the order in which
they were originally chosen.
Recommendations
Each application must be accompanied by
one recommendation from a current or form

er residence director, associate, or tutor, de
pending on the applicant's living group.
Questions on the recommendation sheet ask
mainly about the candidates emotional stability
and responsibility and any specific needs or
skills which would justify preferential con
siideration.
A new policy, initiated this quarter, requires
the applicant himself to arrange for his rec
commendation. Instructions and forms are

ommendations other than the one required are
