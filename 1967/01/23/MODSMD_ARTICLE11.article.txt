### 
WASHINGTON — Sen. J. W
Fulbright, chairman of the Sen
ate Foreign Relations Commit
tee, indicated yesterday he be
lieves the United States should
pressure the South Vietnamese
government into talking with the
Viet Cong—and should oust it if
it balks.
"The present government (of
South Vietnam) if it will not do
what we tell them to do—which
they are very likely to do—then
they can easily be changed," the
Arkansas Democrat said.
Speaking on the NBC televi
sion-radio program "Meet Tlu
Press," Fulbright said:
"That government has no
base. But put it in and they're
our government ... if they re
fuse to do this . . . they can get
a new government. We've had a
number of governments there."
His remarks on replacing th .
present Saigon government were
made when he was asked wheth
er South Vietnam would be will
ing to negotiate with the Viet
Cong.
Fulbright went on to say
South Vietnamese Premier
Nguyen Cao Ky "is there onl;>
because we put him in" and"I
don't think he would last two
weeks without our support."
