# Grace Guides Ruggers To PARC Swamp
## 
### JOHN MERRILL 
The Stanford rugby team over
whelmed an undermanned Palo
Alto Rugby Club team Saturday
to score its second win of the
season, 29-0.
The game was played under a
drenching rain, though after the
game Stanford coach Pete
Krnetovic commented that he
was pleased with the team's
ball handling even under the ad
verse conditions.
Mike Grace led the Indians
with 14 points on one try, a pen
alty kick, and four conversions.
Frank Pattitucci scored twice
for Stanford, once on a recov
ered fumble and again on an
assist from Bob Newberry.
Serum Dominates
All but one of the Stanford
tries came on close-in plays with
the Stanford scrum dominating
play throughout the game. Bruce
Kehrli picked up one of the Stan
ford scores early in the game to
set the pattern for the game.
The only long gainer of the
day came when, late in the first
half, Dave Evans picked up the
ball off a loose ruck. Evans
passed to Jeff Joseph and the
baft went all through the back

field with Bob Blunt finally
carrying the ball over.
'Hie play covered 40 yards
and, considering the weather,
was an outstanding ball-handling
accomplishment. Stanford then
left the field with an 18-0 half
time advantage.
A Grace ful Play
At the onset of the second
half, Grace turned in the finest
individual eflort of the after
noon. The ball was kicked out of
a loose ruck and Grace kicked
the ball further towards the end
zone.
He then literally outswam his
opponent to the ball for the
score. However he missed the
conversion attempt, his first miss
of the season.
David Evans scored the final
try of the day oil a five-yard
scrum, the game ended, and
the 20-odd spectators returned
home very soaked.
Wrestlers Fall Short
In a dry Encina gynasium,
however, the Stanford wrestling
team met a different fate, drop
ping a heartbreaking 16-15 de
cision to the University of Ore
gon Ducks.
After Jumping out to a 3-0
lead on the strength of 123
pounder John Tarn's 7-1 decision
over Terry Hileman, the Tribe

wrestlers lost ton points when
Oregon's 130 and 137 pounders
collected first period pins over
John Wehner and Gerry Beau
doin. The latter faced Curt
Scott, the Ducks' co-captain and
fourth in the NCAA's last year.
Tribe Hoars Back
The Indians roared back to
take four straight matches and
a 15-10 lead. John Suttle at 147
pounds used an escape off a
standing switch and three min
utes riding time for a 3-0 win,
while Captain Len Borchers at
152 overpowered his man 12-3.
160 pounder Doug Gunesch
gained a hard-fought 10-4 win
when he gained throe points in
the last 40 seconds to seal the
triumph. Burt Ambler took an

exciting 7-1 win at 167 with both
men just missing several take
downs.
Bud Hollingbory faced the oth
er Oregon co-captain at 177. He
was leading 3-3 with -40 seconds
left, but his Duck opponent
rallied for a 9-5 decision.
Finale Kills Cards
With the score now 15-13, Stan
ford needed a tie or a win for
the win. Heavyweight Terry
Crenshaw, however, had to face
a brute Duck heavyweight who
outweighed him by 30 pounds,
and lost 7-3. %
Although upset at the close
ness of the loss, coach Jerry
Budzik again noted progress.
"Hie team's control wrestling on
top was much stronger, and

everyone was in good shape," he
noted. Both are results of 32 min
utes of wrestling daily.
Vets Top Frosh
Despite freshman Craig Dick
son's three first places, Stan
ford's varsity gymnasts over
powered the freshman team
137.S to 97.1 Friday night in
Encina gym.
Dickson's sparkling perform
ance highlighted the meet as he
captured firsts in floor exercise
with 8.7, high bar with 8.6 and
long horse with 9.05. His all
around score was 46.0. Coach
John Gilmore called Dickson's
long horse performance the best
of the night.
The freshmen also won firsts
in the side horse (Kim Friese)

and the parallel bars (Dick
Lees).
Rich Guess and John Marks
managed the varsity's only two
firsts in the trampoline and
rings, respectively.
As usual, the varsity's major
strength was in the long horse
where they scored 25.4 points.
Another strong point was the
floor exercise, where they scored
23.1.
Sophomore Jim Petersen
scored 40.95 as the varsity all
around man.

Saturday the Indians will
travel to Berkeley to meet Cali
fornia's outstanding gymnastics
team. Gilmore feels that Cal is
probably in the top ten in the
nation.
