# Clark Kerr And The Regents
## 
### 
Clark Kerr has fought his last battle at the
University of California. But Kerr's record as
president of the state's university system for
eight years indicates that California—and not
Kerr—is the real loser.
Supporters of the Board of Regents' action,
including Governor Ronald Reagan, deny any
hint that Kerr's dismissal was prompted by po
litical motives. And if this be the case, higher
education may be facing a greater threat than
had been supposed. For the ignorance of po
litical bias is less disturbing, if no less detri
mental, than the non-partisan variety.
Clark Kerr's achievements were too great to
be ignored by intelligent men.
As if to perform one last service to the uni
versity, Kerr summarized the accomplishments
of his presidency in a farewell address. He left
the Board of Regents an inescapable benchmark
for choosing his successor:
• An administrator who believes that "the
best investment a society can make is in the
education of its youth";
• A man equal to Kerr's vision in anticipating
the state's needs in the year 2000, as Kerr did in
the state's Master Plan for Education;
• A man who could build and maintain a

quality faculty, as is reflected in the system's
number of Nobel Prize winners and members
of the National Academy;
• A businessman who could hold Californ
ia's per capita expenditure on higher education
to the second lowest in the western states, and
without a tuition increase;
• A leader of a sprawling organization who
knows how to create diversity, individuality, and
responsibility in its various branches, as Kerr
has done with the nine campuses of the univer
sity system;
• An educator who has fought for a balance
of research, teaching, and public service.
The Board of Regents did not pause long
enough last week to consider a successor; in
fact, Kerr's dismissal came so quickly that the
matter was not even on the agenda. When the
Regents seriously assess the string of notables
who have been mentioned recently, perhaps they
will appreciate the qualities of the brilliant edu
cator whom they cast aside.
California did not build a great university
with penny-pinching and political influence,
but the Board of Regents may find it an ex
ceedingly successful formula for turning any
university into a second-rate institution.
