### MIKE MORTON 
President Wallace Sterling has an
nounced the appointment of Joel P.
Smith to the position of Dean of Stu
dents and Associate Provost and H.
Donald Winbigler, the former Dean of
Students, to the post of Academic Sec
retary to the University, effective
February 1.
Winbigler has been Dean of Stu
dents since 1950. In his new position,
he will continue to report directly to
the president and will assist him, as
well as Vice Provost Herbert Packer,
in the current review of education at
Stanford, in studies of university gov
ernment, and in an analysis of changes
in higher education in America since
World War 11.

In a statement to The Daily, Winbig
ler said that, while he has "enjoyed
immensely" serving Stanford as Dean
of Students, he feels that both-the
University's and his own interests
would be served best by a change. He
expressed delight with the appoint
ment of Joel Smith as Dean of Stu
dents, saying that he considers Smith
"eminently qualified" to assume the
post.
In his new position, Winbigler will
serve as Secretary to the Academic
Council. Acting in this capacity he will
assist in a reorganization of the Coun
cil, in addition to fulfilling other as
signments not as yet delineated by
President Sterling.
Winbigler's Service
A Stanford faculty member since
1940, Winbigler served as registrar five
years prior to his appointment as
Dean of Students. He also did pioneer
work in the position now established
as Dean of Admissions and Director
of Placement.
A steadfast counselor of individual
students, he was described in a 1956
Daily profile as having "actively
worked against the typical image of
a harsh, stern administrator."
Education Review
He conducted several studies as an
executive committee member in the
University's comprehensive review of
undergraduate education in 1954-56
and has proven a popular speaker
with alumni and civic groups.
Winbigler received his Bachelor of

Arts degree in 1931 from Monmouth
College, which conferred an honorary
doctorate on him 25 years later. He
earned both M.A. and Ph.D. degrees
from the University of lowa, where
he taught for six years before coming
to Stanford.
Smith Functions
In his new position of Dean of Stu
ents Smith will fulfill all functions
previously the province of Winbigler.
Also, as a member of the provost's
staff, the new deal will coordinate
counseling, testing, placement, and
other educational services for under
ghiduate students. Neither Smith nor
President Sterling was available for
comment on the position shuffling.
Smith is a 1955 graduate of Beloit
College, where he was Phi Beta Kappa
and student body president. A Mar
shall scholar, he received his B.A. at
Oxford in 1957 and a bachelor of laws
degree at the University of Wiscon
sin in 1961. He is a member of the
Order of Coif, a scholastic honorary
society for law students.
He came to Stanford as assistant
general secretary in 1965, after four
years association with the Minneapolis
law firm of Cant, Haverstock, Beards
ley, Gray and Plant. Later in that
same year he was named Associate
Dean of Students, the position he held
till his promotion.
Lyman Reactions
Dean Richard Lyman, University
Provost, expressed pleasure at the pro
motions, stating that he is pleased to

have Dean Smith on his staff and that
"a man of Winbigler's experience"
will be a valuable assistant to the
President
Revealing that the double promo
tion had been planned for some time
now, Lyman explained the rationale
behind the action. Although the posi
tion of Academic Secretary is newly
created, Winbigler had fufilled part of
the functions of the post as Secretary
to the Academic Council and will con
tinue to serve in this capacity as
Academic Secretary. As Dean of Stu
dents, Smith will report directly to the
Provost, and thus an attempt will be
made to tie the Dean of Students of
fice more closely to the academic
functions of the university.

in higher education in America since
World War 11.

In a statement to The Daily, Winbig
ler said that, while he has "enjoyed
immensely" serving Stanford as Dean
of Students, he feels that both-the
University's and his own interests
would be served best by a change. He
expressed delight with the appoint
ment of Joel Smith as Dean of Stu
dents, saying that he considers Smith
"eminently qualified" to assume the
post.
In his new position, Winbigler will
serve as Secretary to the Academic
Council. Acting in this capacity he will
assist in a reorganization of the Coun
cil, in addition to fulfilling other as
signments not as yet delineated by
President Sterling.
Winbigler's Service
A Stanford faculty member since
1940, Winbigler served as registrar five
years prior to his appointment as
Dean of Students. He also did pioneer
work in the position now established
as Dean of Admissions and Director
of Placement.
A steadfast counselor of individual
students, he was described in a 1956
Daily profile as having "actively
worked against the typical image of
a harsh, stern administrator."
Education Review
He conducted several studies as an
executive committee member in the
University's comprehensive review of
undergraduate education in 1954-56
and has proven a popular speaker
with alumni and civic groups.
Winbigler received his Bachelor of

Arts degree in 1931 from Monmouth
College, which conferred an honorary
doctorate on him 25 years later. He
earned both M.A. and Ph.D. degrees
from the University of lowa, where
he taught for six years before coming
to Stanford.
Smith Functions
In his new position of Dean of Stu
ents Smith will fulfill all functions
previously the province of Winbigler.
Also, as a member of the provost's
staff, the new deal will coordinate
counseling, testing, placement, and
other educational services for under
ghiduate students. Neither Smith nor
President Sterling was available for
comment on the position shuffling.
Smith is a 1955 graduate of Beloit
College, where he was Phi Beta Kappa
and student body president. A Mar
shall scholar, he received his B.A. at
Oxford in 1957 and a bachelor of laws
degree at the University of Wiscon
sin in 1961. He is a member of the
Order of Coif, a scholastic honorary
society for law students.
He came to Stanford as assistant
general secretary in 1965, after four
years association with the Minneapolis
law firm of Cant, Haverstock, Beards
ley, Gray and Plant. Later in that
same year he was named Associate
Dean of Students, the position he held
till his promotion.
Lyman Reactions
Dean Richard Lyman, University
Provost, expressed pleasure at the pro
motions, stating that he is pleased to

have Dean Smith on his staff and that
"a man of Winbigler's experience"
will be a valuable assistant to the
President
Revealing that the double promo
tion had been planned for some time
now, Lyman explained the rationale
behind the action. Although the posi
tion of Academic Secretary is newly
created, Winbigler had fufilled part of
the functions of the post as Secretary
to the Academic Council and will con
tinue to serve in this capacity as
Academic Secretary. As Dean of Stu
dents, Smith will report directly to the
Provost, and thus an attempt will be
made to tie the Dean of Students of
fice more closely to the academic
functions of the university.

President Sterling.
Winbigler's Service
A Stanford faculty member since
1940, Winbigler served as registrar five
years prior to his appointment as
Dean of Students. He also did pioneer
work in the position now established
as Dean of Admissions and Director
of Placement.
A steadfast counselor of individual
students, he was described in a 1956
Daily profile as having "actively
worked against the typical image of
a harsh, stern administrator."
Education Review
He conducted several studies as an
executive committee member in the
University's comprehensive review of
undergraduate education in 1954-56
and has proven a popular speaker
with alumni and civic groups.
Winbigler received his Bachelor of

Arts degree in 1931 from Monmouth
College, which conferred an honorary
doctorate on him 25 years later. He
earned both M.A. and Ph.D. degrees
from the University of lowa, where
he taught for six years before coming
to Stanford.
Smith Functions
In his new position of Dean of Stu
ents Smith will fulfill all functions
previously the province of Winbigler.
Also, as a member of the provost's
staff, the new deal will coordinate
counseling, testing, placement, and
other educational services for under
ghiduate students. Neither Smith nor
President Sterling was available for
comment on the position shuffling.
Smith is a 1955 graduate of Beloit
College, where he was Phi Beta Kappa
and student body president. A Mar
shall scholar, he received his B.A. at
Oxford in 1957 and a bachelor of laws
degree at the University of Wiscon
sin in 1961. He is a member of the
Order of Coif, a scholastic honorary
society for law students.
He came to Stanford as assistant
general secretary in 1965, after four
years association with the Minneapolis
law firm of Cant, Haverstock, Beards
ley, Gray and Plant. Later in that
same year he was named Associate
Dean of Students, the position he held
till his promotion.
Lyman Reactions
Dean Richard Lyman, University
Provost, expressed pleasure at the pro
motions, stating that he is pleased to

have Dean Smith on his staff and that
"a man of Winbigler's experience"
will be a valuable assistant to the
President
Revealing that the double promo
tion had been planned for some time
now, Lyman explained the rationale
behind the action. Although the posi
tion of Academic Secretary is newly
created, Winbigler had fufilled part of
the functions of the post as Secretary
to the Academic Council and will con
tinue to serve in this capacity as
Academic Secretary. As Dean of Stu
dents, Smith will report directly to the
Provost, and thus an attempt will be
made to tie the Dean of Students of
fice more closely to the academic
functions of the university.
