# Budget Cuts Foreshadow Downhill Slide
## 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
What is happening to higher
education in California now
strongly resembles what hap
pened to higher education in
Michigan during the late 1950'5,
when a prolonged tight budget
dulled the cutting edge of the
state's best universities.
During this same period, Cali
fornia emerged as the unques
tioned leader in providing college
opportunities for -its youth
through joint action of its edu
cation, governor, and legislators.
For the past four years, under
a Republican governor, Michi
gan has made a major effort to
expand the financial base of its

higher education system. New
York, under another Republican
governor, has made even more
progress toward the same goal.
Ohio, widely cited as a fiscal
example for this state in recent
weeks, has begun to develop a
higher education system broadly
patterned after California and,
under a Republican governor,
has widely advertised its finan
cial support of colleges and uni
versities.
All three Eastern states will
be among the main beneficiaries
of the current crisis at the Uni
versity of California. So great
an institution cannot be de
stroyed over night, but its clear
position of leadership among
state universities may now be
expected to slowly erode for sev
eral years.
Perhaps, as Max Rafferty says,
the dismissal of Clark Kerr is
only the beginning. If so, the
slide will be much steeper. Its
prime victims will be students.
And its remedy, five or 10 years

hence, will not be cheap. Ask
Rockefeller, Rommey, or
Rhoades.

Editor, The Daily:
Theatrical reviews in The
Daily this year have generally
been out of focus. But Curtiss B.
Keek's oblique piece on the Stan
ford Repertory Theatre's cur
rent show, the Beggar's Opera,
is perhaps the most errant and
confusing yet.
A personal criticism and inter
pretation of the play is expected
and unavoidable—however dis
approving or misguided. But it is
sad for Keck to talk about "the
archaic nature of Gay's phrase
ology" and then to write as
pompously as he does.
The review is filled with non
sequiturs. Keek's flowery ap
praisal of the show's bust lines
is not only shockingly written,

but pitifully irrelevant as it
stands. Bad reporting and worse
sub-editing.
But the outstanding perni
cious feature of this review was
the sentence: "Make-up consul
tant, Barbara Hiken could have
bleached Paul Winfield's skin."
If Keck and others in the audi
ence found it a "hang-up" that
Peacham was portrayed by a
Negro, I'm sorry for their lim
ited vision. Perhaps Keck thinks
that the talented Winfield ought
to be kept on costume crew until
the SRT decides to produce
Othello. Those who gave "im
mediate significance" to the
color of Winfield's skin are un
fortunately well beyond reach
of one of the SRT's aims —to
create an intelligent theater audi
ence.
