## Tryouts Announced For New President 
### Bob Fishman 
"Hello? Hello? Is this Cen
tral Casting?"
"Who wants to know?"
"This is the Governor calling."
"Ronnie baby!"
"Look, Moe. I've got a big
problem. I need a University
President right away. Not one of
those eggheads, please. I need
real class on this one. Some
body who just overflows with in
tegrity—the kind you can see

right on the silver serene. Some
body who's firm and unyielding
but with a touch of homespun
humor and a twinkle in his eye.
Somebody who's just like me."
Patriotic
"How about John Wayne?
Did you catch him in The Ala
mo? I can see him now: he's
holed up in the Administration
Building surrounded by three
armies of hostile students. Only
him and a handful of Deans are
left. He's sitting in his office,
and all the Deans are begging
him to surrender. He's just
about to give in, but he happens
to glance at the American flag
standing in the corner. He looks
the Deans straight in the eye
and shouts, 'Give me Liberty or
give me Death!' "
"Johnny's a real patriot," said
the Governor. "He's been in 38
films and hasn't turned traitor
yet. But he doesn't look right in
a business suit. Who else is avail
able?"
Brute Strength
"How about a real tough type?
Somebody like Broderick Craw
ford. Listen—this time the stu
dents are holed up in the Ad
ministration Building, and the
Deans have got the place sur
rounded. There are searchlights
and everything. Crawford grabs
a megaphone and shouts, 'OK
Savio! We know you're in there!
We've got the whole neighbor
hood locked up tight as a drum.
So come out with your hands
above your head!' Then some
body shouts from inside, 'If you
want me coppers, you'll have to
come in and get me!' Crawford
smiles at this and then turns to
to the guy next to him. 'Well,
Dean McGood,' he says, 'it looks
like we'll have to give him a
whiff o' the tear gas.' "
"Crawford sounds great as
Chancellor, but I don't see him
as President. Who else?"
Wild Thing
"How's this for imaginative
casting? Marlon Brando! It'll be
his greatest roll since Mutiny on
the Bounty. He'll go back to his
'Wild One' pose, and talk to the
students in their own terms. I've
got the scene right in my mind.
The SDS gang are revving up
their bikes for a mix with the
ROTC. All of a sudden, Brando
rumbles in, meaner than any of
them. He looks like he could
take on ten TA's at once. And
since he's President, his bike is
a lot bigger than theirs. He
stares 'em down and says, 'As
long as you're on my turf, you
do things my way. Now shut up
and move out!' They move."
"Brando's like all those oth
er Hell's Angels," the Governor
complained. "They're all great
guys but you can't count on
them. What I need is someone
more dependable, more practical,
and more wholesome. Someone
like me."
"I think Fred Mac Murray's
free. You must know what he's
like: in his last picture he played
a scoutmaster, and it was a Dis
ney flick besides."
"That's more like it! Dress
him in a cap and gown and give
him a screen test. A university
president, like a governor, must
look the part."

Deans have got the place sur
rounded. There are searchlights
and everything. Crawford grabs
a megaphone and shouts, 'OK
Savio! We know you're in there!
We've got the whole neighbor
hood locked up tight as a drum.
So come out with your hands
above your head!' Then some
body shouts from inside, 'If you
want me coppers, you'll have to
come in and get me!' Crawford
smiles at this and then turns to
to the guy next to him. 'Well,
Dean McGood,' he says, 'it looks
like we'll have to give him a
whiff o' the tear gas.' "
"Crawford sounds great as
Chancellor, but I don't see him
as President. Who else?"

"How's this for imaginative
casting? Marlon Brando! It'll be
his greatest roll since Mutiny on
the Bounty. He'll go back to his
'Wild One' pose, and talk to the
students in their own terms. I've
got the scene right in my mind.
The SDS gang are revving up
their bikes for a mix with the
ROTC. All of a sudden, Brando
rumbles in, meaner than any of
them. He looks like he could
take on ten TA's at once. And
since he's President, his bike is
a lot bigger than theirs. He
stares 'em down and says, 'As
long as you're on my turf, you
do things my way. Now shut up
and move out!' They move."
"Brando's like all those oth
er Hell's Angels," the Governor
complained. "They're all great
guys but you can't count on
them. What I need is someone
more dependable, more practical,
and more wholesome. Someone
like me."
"I think Fred Mac Murray's
free. You must know what he's
like: in his last picture he played
a scoutmaster, and it was a Dis
ney flick besides."
"That's more like it! Dress
him in a cap and gown and give
him a screen test. A university
president, like a governor, must
look the part."
"Hello? Hello? Is this Cen
tral Casting?"
"Who wants to know?"
"This is the Governor calling."
"Ronnie baby!"
"Look, Moe. I've got a big
problem. I need a University
President right away. Not one of
those eggheads, please. I need
real class on this one. Some
body who just overflows with in
tegrity—the kind you can see

right on the silver serene. Some
body who's firm and unyielding
but with a touch of homespun
humor and a twinkle in his eye.
Somebody who's just like me."

"How about John Wayne?
Did you catch him in The Ala
mo? I can see him now: he's
holed up in the Administration
Building surrounded by three
armies of hostile students. Only
him and a handful of Deans are
left. He's sitting in his office,
and all the Deans are begging
him to surrender. He's just
about to give in, but he happens
to glance at the American flag
standing in the corner. He looks
the Deans straight in the eye
and shouts, 'Give me Liberty or
give me Death!' "
"Johnny's a real patriot," said
the Governor. "He's been in 38
films and hasn't turned traitor
yet. But he doesn't look right in
a business suit. Who else is avail
able?"

Somebody like Broderick Craw
