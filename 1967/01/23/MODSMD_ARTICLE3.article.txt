# Lynda Visits Stanford To Research Article
## 
### CHARLES KITE 
A swarm of Secret Service men, a
black Continental limousine, and a
rather tall, well dressed young wom
an provided the only hints to a few
sharp-eyed Indians that a well known
figure had made a brief visit to Stan
ford last week.
The well kept secret of Lynda Bird
Johnson's presence comprised a nec
essary part of her job: of wrting a
story on the "Generation Gap" for Mc-
Call's Magazine, based on Dr. John
Black's November article in the Stan
ford Observer on that topic. Black is
ihe head of Counseling and Testing.
Black's ideas were the reason for Miss
Johnson's coming to Stanford for the
article.
Private Person
Miss Johnson specifically requested
silence. "She wished to be treated as
â– a private person," commented Bob
Beyers, head of News and Publica
tions. Lynda Bird spent two
days in open ended discussions with
a group of eight Stanford women on
Monday, and Tuesday with seven
mothers of Stanford students.
The girls chosen for the group were
not aware to whom they would be
talking when they were ushered into
the Faculty Club Monday afternoon.
The participants were picked by Dr.
Black and Dean Joel Smith.
No Recognition
During the four hours spent dis
cussing the 'Gap' several surprises
lay in store for the girls. At first meet
ing. some of the coeds did not recog
nize Lynda Bird. Participant Pamela
Mason expressed the scone, "She didn't
look anything like her pictures; she
look's horrible in the press photo
graphs." Dr. Black's impressions were
"She was a very tall girl, very attrac
tive. a beautiful complexion, and beau
tifully dressed." He added, "Lynda
Bird was surprisingly unsophisticated
in a positive way, with respect to the
social life she's been exposed to."
One of the coeds noted a statement
which she felt backed up her new im
pression of the President's daughter.
"She had five strikes against her, but
she was great, she talked about her
parents like we did about ours. Linda's
comment, 'To us, change isn't admit
ting you were wrong before,' seemed
very intelligent and sincere."
Seriousness
Dr. Black also observed that Lynda
Bird "was very serious about the job
she was trying to do. She was so
anxious to get started that she found
> meone to work all night to tran
s> rlbe the tapes."

This brief glimpse made all the par
ticipants eager to see just how the
magazine article, due this spring, will
take shape. The coeds interviewed for
the article agreed the topic was very
general, and that explaining the gen
eration gap in terms of their personal
experiences would make it hard to
generalize on a national scale; a hard
subject for anybody to write on.
