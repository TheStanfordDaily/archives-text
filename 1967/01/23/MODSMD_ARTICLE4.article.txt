# KERR FIRED
## Cal's Faculty Reaction Strongest 
### SUZETTE LEITH PAT McMAHON 
BERKELEY—Rain soaked headlines
told the story here Friday. CLAKK
KERR—FIRED
In an unanticipated move, the Re
gents of the University of California,
by a vote of 14-8, had dismissed Kerr
as president of the nine campus, 87,000
student university system.
The campus seemed slow to react.
Nothing more than chance comment
—"just after he kicks him out, Reagan
admits that $100 is too much"—could
be heard.
A Daily Californian staff member
commented Friday on relative calm:
"Anything that will happen, will hap
pen on Monday." If anyone protests
much, it will be the faculty," he added.
"Maybe this will finally get them off
their duffs."
Faculty Indignation
In general the mood of the faculty
is one of "immense indignation," re

ported Kenneth M. Stampp, Cal pro
fessor of history, yesterday afternoon,
"indignation—not just at Reagan, but
at what appears to be the Regents'
complete surrender to pressure from
his administration."
"It's been a long time since a uni
versity president was fired simply be
cause of a change in the state admini
tration," he added.
"Nothing is more destructive to the
university than getting involved in
politics," he went on. "The faculty
wants the assurance that this is not
the beginning of increased involve
ment."
"Although many faculty members
have reservations about Kerr as presi
dent," Stampp commented, "I don't
know of one who is not appalled at
the way he was fired."
He speculated that a set of resolu
tions would be passed at Tuesday's
specially called meeting of UC Berke
ley's Academic Senate.

Mathematics Professor Morris
Hirsch agreed, "I am shocked at the
manner in which it (the firing) oc
curred." He added, however, that
"Kerr himself was partly to blame.
He had convinced the people of the
state that the Berkeley students were
irresponsible and uncontrollable."
"I think Kerr was wrong," Hirsch
continued. "He should have given the
students more support back in 1964
and spoken out more honestly."
"Ninety-eight per cent of the stu
dent body is also apalled at the way
Kerr was fired," stated Stampp. He
noted a "wide range of student view
point" but expected that "something
will be said on the steps of Sproul
Hall tomorrow."
A Cal student considered the possi
bility of general student uprising
doubtful. "The radicals are usually
the best organized, and they are glad
to see Kerr go."

Upon hearing of Kerr's dismissal,
the Strike Committee, headed by
Mario Savio, issued a statement pro
claiming "good riddance to bad rub
bish."
At Stanford, concern for the future
of the University of California was
expressed. It was considered that the
dismissal of Kerr might be an omen
of a weakening of the UC system.
Professor Ernest Hilgard said yes
terday,"I think very highly of Clark
Kerr. I have known him since he
taught at Stanford and he is a real
educational statesman. I don't like to
see this happening to him and also I
don't like to see the University of Cali
fornia embroilled in partisan politics."
Dean Richard Lyman contacted last
night expressed "dismay" at the dis
missal of Clark Kerr. He said that it
is difficult to believe that the action "is
not going to harm the university in
some way."

A Daily Californian staff member
commented Friday on relative calm:
"Anything that will happen, will hap
pen on Monday." If anyone protests
much, it will be the faculty," he added.
"Maybe this will finally get them off
their duffs."
Faculty Indignation
In general the mood of the faculty
is one of "immense indignation," re

ported Kenneth M. Stampp, Cal pro
fessor of history, yesterday afternoon,
"indignation—not just at Reagan, but
at what appears to be the Regents'
complete surrender to pressure from
his administration."
"It's been a long time since a uni
versity president was fired simply be
cause of a change in the state admini
tration," he added.
"Nothing is more destructive to the
university than getting involved in
politics," he went on. "The faculty
wants the assurance that this is not
the beginning of increased involve
ment."
"Although many faculty members
have reservations about Kerr as presi
dent," Stampp commented, "I don't
know of one who is not appalled at
the way he was fired."
He speculated that a set of resolu
tions would be passed at Tuesday's
specially called meeting of UC Berke
ley's Academic Senate.

Mathematics Professor Morris
Hirsch agreed, "I am shocked at the
manner in which it (the firing) oc
curred." He added, however, that
"Kerr himself was partly to blame.
He had convinced the people of the
state that the Berkeley students were
irresponsible and uncontrollable."
"I think Kerr was wrong," Hirsch
continued. "He should have given the
students more support back in 1964
and spoken out more honestly."
"Ninety-eight per cent of the stu
dent body is also apalled at the way
Kerr was fired," stated Stampp. He
noted a "wide range of student view
point" but expected that "something
will be said on the steps of Sproul
Hall tomorrow."
A Cal student considered the possi
bility of general student uprising
doubtful. "The radicals are usually
the best organized, and they are glad
to see Kerr go."

Upon hearing of Kerr's dismissal,
the Strike Committee, headed by
Mario Savio, issued a statement pro
claiming "good riddance to bad rub
bish."
At Stanford, concern for the future
of the University of California was
expressed. It was considered that the
dismissal of Kerr might be an omen
of a weakening of the UC system.
Professor Ernest Hilgard said yes
terday,"I think very highly of Clark
Kerr. I have known him since he
taught at Stanford and he is a real
educational statesman. I don't like to
see this happening to him and also I
don't like to see the University of Cali
fornia embroilled in partisan politics."
Dean Richard Lyman contacted last
night expressed "dismay" at the dis
missal of Clark Kerr. He said that it
is difficult to believe that the action "is
not going to harm the university in
some way."

In an unanticipated move, the Re
gents of the University of California,
by a vote of 14-8, had dismissed Kerr
as president of the nine campus, 87,000
student university system.
The campus seemed slow to react.
Nothing more than chance comment
