# Fraternities Threaten New Rush Proposals
## 
### 
All indications are that a fair-sized
hassle is developing over this year's
rush rules. The ad hoc committee on
rush has formulated a new set of
procedures. Although details are not
yet available, this year's rules are es
sentially the same as last year's, with
some exceptions. Those exceptions
are what the fight is all about.
The ad hoc committee's proposed

new rules were submitted to the In
terfraternity Council at their meeting
last Wednesday night. The IFC re
turned the new rules to the commit
tee with several proposed changes. The
committee will meet Tuesday night
to discuss and act upon them.
The fraternities' objection, an in
formed source told The Daily yes
terday, centers around rules concern
ing the parties which are held at the
beginning of Spring Quarter. In the
past, bids have been offered prospec
tive pledges at these parties, although
each rushee also receives a official
written bid, and technically the rushee
would make no binding acceptance of
a bid until the end of rush.
Changes
This year, there may be changes in
the party format and in rules regard
ing what goes on at parties. No one
from the ad hoc committee or from
the IFC would specify at this time the
exact proposed changes of rules they
are directed against. Other changes
may also be included in the IFC pro
posal.
Should the ad hoc committee's final
draft of the rush rules still be unac
ceptable to the IFC, the IFC will prob
ably not ratify it. In that event, the
government of rush would revert to
the Dean of Students' office.
The ad hoc committee is composed
of members from fraternities, eating
clubs, residents of Wilbur and Stern,
and faculty advisers. It was formed
two years ago in response to criticism
of previous rush procedures, which
were formulated by the IFC in years
past.
This year's new policy has already
gone into effect, with meal exchanges
now being conducted between fresh
men and the members of other living
groups. Open house dates for fraterni
ties and eating clubs arc now separ
ated .Previously the dates were often
simultaneous.
Rush Book
This year's rush book will also be
considerably different. There will be
a summation of pertinent information
on each group, including number of
members, national affiliation, names of
officers and a descriptive selection.
It is not yet known whether any
group will feature topless hostesses
this year.

last Wednesday night. The IFC re
turned the new rules to the commit
tee with several proposed changes. The
committee will meet Tuesday night
to discuss and act upon them.
The fraternities' objection, an in
formed source told The Daily yes
terday, centers around rules concern
ing the parties which are held at the
beginning of Spring Quarter. In the
past, bids have been offered prospec
tive pledges at these parties, although
each rushee also receives a official
written bid, and technically the rushee
would make no binding acceptance of
a bid until the end of rush.
Changes
This year, there may be changes in
the party format and in rules regard
ing what goes on at parties. No one
from the ad hoc committee or from
the IFC would specify at this time the
exact proposed changes of rules they
are directed against. Other changes
may also be included in the IFC pro
posal.
Should the ad hoc committee's final
draft of the rush rules still be unac
ceptable to the IFC, the IFC will prob
ably not ratify it. In that event, the
government of rush would revert to
the Dean of Students' office.
The ad hoc committee is composed
of members from fraternities, eating
clubs, residents of Wilbur and Stern,
and faculty advisers. It was formed
two years ago in response to criticism
of previous rush procedures, which
were formulated by the IFC in years
past.
This year's new policy has already
gone into effect, with meal exchanges
now being conducted between fresh
men and the members of other living
groups. Open house dates for fraterni
ties and eating clubs arc now separ
ated .Previously the dates were often
simultaneous.
Rush Book
This year's rush book will also be
considerably different. There will be
a summation of pertinent information
on each group, including number of
members, national affiliation, names of
officers and a descriptive selection.
It is not yet known whether any
group will feature topless hostesses
this year.
All indications are that a fair-sized
hassle is developing over this year's
rush rules. The ad hoc committee on
rush has formulated a new set of
procedures. Although details are not
yet available, this year's rules are es
sentially the same as last year's, with
some exceptions. Those exceptions
are what the fight is all about.
