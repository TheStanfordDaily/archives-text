# It's (Ha) A (Hee) Gas!
## 
### JAMES BRISCOE Gas Editor 
Are you puffing more now, but en
joying it less? Do your sugar cubes
lose their vigor in the icebox over
night?
Then take gas—laughing gas that
is. It's the latest way to travel.
Or so say a growing group of de
votees on campus. Laughing gas or
nitrous oxide (N2O) to give it its prop
er name, can produce much the same
effects as psychedelic drugs, they
claim, and is easier and cheaper to
obtain.
One student tells of purchasing the
gas wholesale from a medical supply
house in pressurized bottles ("They
think I'm anesthetizing rats with it"),
and some say it is used to pressurize
aerosol cans of whipped cream.
A High
"Turning on" with the gas causes
many of the same sensations as LSD
or marijuana, users note. "When you
inhale it, you reach a high," a tall
blond coed relates, "then after a min
ute or two, it goes away. But after
several shots, the high becomes sort
of stabilized and lasts for a while."
"My sense of time perception is
sometimes distorted," another student
observes, "occasionally I can even
count the thoughts between laughs,
and at other times when I've inhaled
and passed the bottle on, it seems just
a couple of seconds before it's back to
me again.
"Some people have auditory distor
tions," he continued, "and hear noises
like buzzsaws."
Medical authorities on campus were
somewhat skeptical about the effects
of the gas however.
Depressant
"Nitrous oxide was a very common
anesthetic at one time," Dr. Maurice
Osborne, Health Center Director,
noted, "it's not used much any more
because there are better ones available
now, but like all anethetics it acts as
a depressant, and one of the first
areas of the brain to be numbed is
the cortex, which provides the so
called civilizing influences for man.
And administered in sufficient
amounts, the gas could induce all the
stages of anesthesia, including the
final stage, death."
Osborne stated that he knew of no
reports of hallucinatory properties of
the gas, but said that by reducing the
amount of oxygen taken in, nitrous
oxide could induce hypoxia or short
age of oxygen in the brain.
Hypoxia is sometimes experienced
by pilots who are forced to high
altitudes without oxygen equipment
and can produce visons and "a feeling
of oneness with the world."
Quasi-Psychedelic
A student who has researched the
subject, says that laughing gas has a
long history of quasi-psychedelic use,
however.
Samuel Colt, of six-shooter fame,
was one of the first to use the gas,
he reports. In the 1830's, Colt travelled
around the country in a side show ad
ministering the gas to spectators, he
said, "and laughing gas parties were
quite popular during the 1840's and
50's." The effects of nirous oxide are
also mentioned by William James in
a book of mysticism, he adds.
Nor were dentists ignorant of its
effects. One is quoted as observing,
"Sure they see dragons and snakes,
but we get their teeth just the same."

effects. One is quoted as observing,
"Sure they see dragons and snakes,
but we get their teeth just the same."
Are you puffing more now, but en
joying it less? Do your sugar cubes
lose their vigor in the icebox over
night?
Then take gas—laughing gas that
is. It's the latest way to travel.
Or so say a growing group of de
votees on campus. Laughing gas or
nitrous oxide (N2O) to give it its prop
er name, can produce much the same
effects as psychedelic drugs, they
claim, and is easier and cheaper to
obtain.
One student tells of purchasing the
gas wholesale from a medical supply
house in pressurized bottles ("They
think I'm anesthetizing rats with it"),
and some say it is used to pressurize
aerosol cans of whipped cream.
A High
"Turning on" with the gas causes
many of the same sensations as LSD
or marijuana, users note. "When you
inhale it, you reach a high," a tall
blond coed relates, "then after a min
ute or two, it goes away. But after
several shots, the high becomes sort
of stabilized and lasts for a while."
"My sense of time perception is
sometimes distorted," another student
observes, "occasionally I can even
count the thoughts between laughs,
and at other times when I've inhaled
and passed the bottle on, it seems just
a couple of seconds before it's back to
me again.
"Some people have auditory distor
tions," he continued, "and hear noises
like buzzsaws."
Medical authorities on campus were
somewhat skeptical about the effects
of the gas however.
Depressant
"Nitrous oxide was a very common
anesthetic at one time," Dr. Maurice
Osborne, Health Center Director,
noted, "it's not used much any more
because there are better ones available
now, but like all anethetics it acts as
a depressant, and one of the first
areas of the brain to be numbed is
the cortex, which provides the so
called civilizing influences for man.
And administered in sufficient
amounts, the gas could induce all the
stages of anesthesia, including the
final stage, death."
Osborne stated that he knew of no
reports of hallucinatory properties of
the gas, but said that by reducing the
amount of oxygen taken in, nitrous
oxide could induce hypoxia or short
age of oxygen in the brain.
Hypoxia is sometimes experienced
by pilots who are forced to high
altitudes without oxygen equipment
and can produce visons and "a feeling
of oneness with the world."
Quasi-Psychedelic
A student who has researched the
subject, says that laughing gas has a
long history of quasi-psychedelic use,
however.
Samuel Colt, of six-shooter fame,
was one of the first to use the gas,
he reports. In the 1830's, Colt travelled
around the country in a side show ad
ministering the gas to spectators, he
said, "and laughing gas parties were
quite popular during the 1840's and
50's." The effects of nirous oxide are
also mentioned by William James in
a book of mysticism, he adds.
Nor were dentists ignorant of its
effects. One is quoted as observing,
"Sure they see dragons and snakes,
but we get their teeth just the same."
