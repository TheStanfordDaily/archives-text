# Summer Studies In Bolivia Teach More Than Sociology
## 
### JACQUES DELACROIX 
(Editor's Note: Mr. Delacroix
Is a senior sociology major from
Paris, France. He and other par
ticipants In the Latin American
summer program will be con
ducting a panel discussion to
night at 7 p.m. In Tresidder.)
I am one of the 12 people
who spent last summer in Latin
America under the auspices of
the Undergraduate Summer Pro
gram for Study in Latin Ameri
ca, financed by a Ford Founda
tion grant.
I have been asked to write
about my experience which I do
with great pleasure because I
am absolutely enthusiastic about
the program. It is difficult to
evaluate the feelings of the other
participants but it is worth not
ing that one man left last June
for Peru and he has never been
seen since.
The program is designed to
give Juniors a chance to do some
individual independent work in
any Latin American country.
Candidates must submit a short
life history, a project related to
their discipline, and their rea
sons for wanting to participate.
Volunteers are chosen on
the basis of the worth of their
project, their language ability,
and their chances of succeeding
as evaluated by a committee of
wise men.
Many Projects
My project was a small study
of race relations in Bolivia.
Some were concerned with pol
itics, others with teaching, litera
ture, and birth control.
Until last June, I knew of
only two ways for a student to
live in a foreign land during the
summer: work projects or tour
ing by jet and car all expenses
paid by Daddy (or hitch-hiking,
no expenses paid by Daddy,
which is only a variant of the
same).
Being an old hand at the latter,
on three continents, I awaited
Bolivia with the typical cool of
a man who knows that Pepsi
Cola is everywhere, that Cen
tral Africans would rather use
old U.S. oil cans than lovely pot
tery and that hardly anybody
rides a burro in Mexico any
more.
Actually I was wrong; Bolivia
was extremely picturesque, in the
full visual sense of the word.
Everybody still dresses very na
tive so that after a while I would
turn around to stare at Euro
pean-dressed women, finding
something vaguely licentious
about legs bared to the knee.
But what is more important,
I discovered an altogether new
way of living in another cul
ture. It's a way that avoids the
slightly artificial atmosphere

and the generalized suspicion of
the natives, who have never re
ceived anything for nothing, at
tached to work projects. It also
spares one the necessity of visit
ing many churches and many
good, bad, and mediocre muse
ums and the absurd lack of con
tact with the inhabitants that
go with first class tourism.
Frightened
It is, of course, much better
than hitch-hiking around, which
is, let's admit it, often goal-less,
superficial, and exasperating.
Any frightened, lonely, inex
perienced little student who
lands in one of the Latin Amer
ican Republics to do a job on
his own has a tremendous ad
vantage over Peace-Corpsmen
and tourists of both kinds: he
needs the natives.
This may sound paradoxical,
but if you are a citizen of some
little nation that survives large
ly through American aid, you
just live to feed an American, so,
you invite him for dinner. If
your hometown is constantly be
ing invaded by cohorts of Amer
ican experts coming down to tell
you the score, you just love to
meet one who would actually
like to ask you something. So,
you get the most numerous, di
verse, fruitful, intimate contacts
any foreigner can ever wish for.
No Loneliness
Somebody asked me if I had
been lonely while in Bolivia. That
was not my problem at all; my

real problem was to find enough
time to be alone to write raj
paper. But, I don't want to give
the impression that the Under
graduate Summer program ii
just a superior form of tourism.
It's much more.
Despite the fact that all col
lege students "are considered
adults," and all that, the fact 1b
that little juniors are little jun
iors and they never get to do
anything on their own. They arc
constantly supervised, tested, re
minded, etc. If they happen to
be interested in their major, they
are discouraged from having
original thoughts by the too
great proximity of the great
names in that field.
Sociological Study
In one word, learning for in
undergraduate is essentially a
passive occupation. I don't con
tend that the summer I spent
working in Bolivia furthered at
all the body of knowledge of so
ciology—even that about South
America. I don't even think my
paper has any sociological "a
lidity whatsoever.
But in the process of not furth
ering our knowledge of race rela
tions and of not accomplishing
any work of any validity, 1
learned more about what not to
do in field work than I would
have by reading a hund id
methodological handbooks. And
besides, it was fun.
Last summer participants will
hold a panel discussion at 1
p.m. this evening at Tresidder

I have been asked to write
about my experience which I do
with great pleasure because I
am absolutely enthusiastic about
the program. It is difficult to
evaluate the feelings of the other
participants but it is worth not
ing that one man left last June
for Peru and he has never been
seen since.
The program is designed to
give Juniors a chance to do some
individual independent work in
any Latin American country.
Candidates must submit a short
life history, a project related to
their discipline, and their rea
sons for wanting to participate.
Volunteers are chosen on
the basis of the worth of their
project, their language ability,
and their chances of succeeding
as evaluated by a committee of
wise men.
Many Projects
My project was a small study
of race relations in Bolivia.
Some were concerned with pol
itics, others with teaching, litera
ture, and birth control.
Until last June, I knew of
only two ways for a student to
live in a foreign land during the
summer: work projects or tour
ing by jet and car all expenses
paid by Daddy (or hitch-hiking,
no expenses paid by Daddy,
which is only a variant of the
same).
Being an old hand at the latter,
on three continents, I awaited
Bolivia with the typical cool of
a man who knows that Pepsi
Cola is everywhere, that Cen
tral Africans would rather use
old U.S. oil cans than lovely pot
tery and that hardly anybody
rides a burro in Mexico any
more.
Actually I was wrong; Bolivia
was extremely picturesque, in the
full visual sense of the word.
Everybody still dresses very na
tive so that after a while I would
turn around to stare at Euro
pean-dressed women, finding
something vaguely licentious
about legs bared to the knee.
But what is more important,
I discovered an altogether new
way of living in another cul
ture. It's a way that avoids the
slightly artificial atmosphere

and the generalized suspicion of
the natives, who have never re
ceived anything for nothing, at
tached to work projects. It also
spares one the necessity of visit
ing many churches and many
good, bad, and mediocre muse
ums and the absurd lack of con
tact with the inhabitants that
go with first class tourism.
Frightened
It is, of course, much better
than hitch-hiking around, which
is, let's admit it, often goal-less,
superficial, and exasperating.
Any frightened, lonely, inex
perienced little student who
lands in one of the Latin Amer
ican Republics to do a job on
his own has a tremendous ad
vantage over Peace-Corpsmen
and tourists of both kinds: he
needs the natives.
This may sound paradoxical,
but if you are a citizen of some
little nation that survives large
ly through American aid, you
just live to feed an American, so,
you invite him for dinner. If
your hometown is constantly be
ing invaded by cohorts of Amer
ican experts coming down to tell
you the score, you just love to
meet one who would actually
like to ask you something. So,
you get the most numerous, di
verse, fruitful, intimate contacts
any foreigner can ever wish for.
No Loneliness
Somebody asked me if I had
been lonely while in Bolivia. That
was not my problem at all; my

real problem was to find enough
time to be alone to write raj
paper. But, I don't want to give
the impression that the Under
graduate Summer program ii
just a superior form of tourism.
It's much more.
Despite the fact that all col
lege students "are considered
adults," and all that, the fact 1b
that little juniors are little jun
iors and they never get to do
anything on their own. They arc
constantly supervised, tested, re
minded, etc. If they happen to
be interested in their major, they
are discouraged from having
original thoughts by the too
great proximity of the great
names in that field.
Sociological Study
In one word, learning for in
undergraduate is essentially a
passive occupation. I don't con
tend that the summer I spent
working in Bolivia furthered at
all the body of knowledge of so
ciology—even that about South
America. I don't even think my
paper has any sociological "a
lidity whatsoever.
But in the process of not furth
ering our knowledge of race rela
tions and of not accomplishing
any work of any validity, 1
learned more about what not to
do in field work than I would
have by reading a hund id
methodological handbooks. And
besides, it was fun.
Last summer participants will
hold a panel discussion at 1
p.m. this evening at Tresidder
(Editor's Note: Mr. Delacroix
Is a senior sociology major from
Paris, France. He and other par
ticipants In the Latin American
summer program will be con
ducting a panel discussion to
night at 7 p.m. In Tresidder.)

sons for wanting to participate.
Volunteers are chosen on
the basis of the worth of their
project, their language ability,
and their chances of succeeding
as evaluated by a committee of
wise men.
Many Projects
My project was a small study
of race relations in Bolivia.
Some were concerned with pol
itics, others with teaching, litera
ture, and birth control.
Until last June, I knew of
only two ways for a student to
live in a foreign land during the
summer: work projects or tour
ing by jet and car all expenses
paid by Daddy (or hitch-hiking,
no expenses paid by Daddy,
which is only a variant of the
same).
Being an old hand at the latter,
on three continents, I awaited
Bolivia with the typical cool of
a man who knows that Pepsi
Cola is everywhere, that Cen
tral Africans would rather use
old U.S. oil cans than lovely pot
tery and that hardly anybody
rides a burro in Mexico any
more.
Actually I was wrong; Bolivia
was extremely picturesque, in the
full visual sense of the word.
Everybody still dresses very na
tive so that after a while I would
turn around to stare at Euro
pean-dressed women, finding
something vaguely licentious
about legs bared to the knee.
But what is more important,
I discovered an altogether new
way of living in another cul
ture. It's a way that avoids the
slightly artificial atmosphere

and the generalized suspicion of
the natives, who have never re
ceived anything for nothing, at
tached to work projects. It also
spares one the necessity of visit
ing many churches and many
good, bad, and mediocre muse
ums and the absurd lack of con
tact with the inhabitants that
go with first class tourism.
Frightened
It is, of course, much better
than hitch-hiking around, which
is, let's admit it, often goal-less,
superficial, and exasperating.
Any frightened, lonely, inex
perienced little student who
lands in one of the Latin Amer
ican Republics to do a job on
his own has a tremendous ad
vantage over Peace-Corpsmen
and tourists of both kinds: he
needs the natives.
This may sound paradoxical,
but if you are a citizen of some
little nation that survives large
ly through American aid, you
just live to feed an American, so,
you invite him for dinner. If
your hometown is constantly be
ing invaded by cohorts of Amer
ican experts coming down to tell
you the score, you just love to
meet one who would actually
like to ask you something. So,
you get the most numerous, di
verse, fruitful, intimate contacts
any foreigner can ever wish for.
No Loneliness
Somebody asked me if I had
been lonely while in Bolivia. That
was not my problem at all; my

real problem was to find enough
time to be alone to write raj
paper. But, I don't want to give
the impression that the Under
graduate Summer program ii
just a superior form of tourism.
It's much more.
Despite the fact that all col
lege students "are considered
adults," and all that, the fact 1b
that little juniors are little jun
iors and they never get to do
anything on their own. They arc
constantly supervised, tested, re
minded, etc. If they happen to
be interested in their major, they
are discouraged from having
original thoughts by the too
great proximity of the great
names in that field.
Sociological Study
In one word, learning for in
undergraduate is essentially a
passive occupation. I don't con
tend that the summer I spent
working in Bolivia furthered at
all the body of knowledge of so
ciology—even that about South
America. I don't even think my
paper has any sociological "a
lidity whatsoever.
But in the process of not furth
ering our knowledge of race rela
tions and of not accomplishing
any work of any validity, 1
learned more about what not to
do in field work than I would
have by reading a hund id
methodological handbooks. And
besides, it was fun.
Last summer participants will
hold a panel discussion at 1
p.m. this evening at Tresidder
(Editor's Note: Mr. Delacroix
Is a senior sociology major from
Paris, France. He and other par
ticipants In the Latin American
summer program will be con
ducting a panel discussion to
night at 7 p.m. In Tresidder.)
I am one of the 12 people
who spent last summer in Latin
America under the auspices of
the Undergraduate Summer Pro
gram for Study in Latin Ameri
ca, financed by a Ford Founda
tion grant.
I have been asked to write
about my experience which I do
with great pleasure because I
am absolutely enthusiastic about
the program. It is difficult to
evaluate the feelings of the other
participants but it is worth not
ing that one man left last June
for Peru and he has never been
seen since.
The program is designed to
give Juniors a chance to do some
individual independent work in
any Latin American country.
Candidates must submit a short
life history, a project related to
their discipline, and their rea
sons for wanting to participate.
Volunteers are chosen on
the basis of the worth of their
project, their language ability,
and their chances of succeeding
as evaluated by a committee of
