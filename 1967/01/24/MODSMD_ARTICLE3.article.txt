# IQ Scores Do Not Dictate Child's Creative Potential
## 
### 
Research by a Stanford psychologist
has revealed that high IQ scores do
not always signify high creativity.
After study of a group of seven- and
eight-year-old boys who enrolled in the
Los Altos School District's summer
recreation program last year, Profes
sor William C. Ward, Jr., has found
that "creativity is not at all related
to intelligence as measured with
standard tests."
Using the standard battery of intel
ligence tests for the youngster's age
and grade level plus three creativity
tests, Ward reports that "scoring was
based on the total number of ideas the
child gave, and also the number of
unique ideas he produced." According
to Ward, his results raise new ques
tions as to how children learn and in
dicated a need for more research in
the field. He feels the Los Altos study
emphasizes once again the intellectual
differences between individuals.
In the first of the three creativity
measures, the children were asked to
name all the possible uses they could
think of for a wide variety of objects.
In the second test the youngsters were
to name objects falling into a com
mon category—by color or by size.
The third creativity test required
interpretations of a series of abstract
drawings.
Many Ideas
"Some youngsters," Ward said,
"might be more comfortable with a
school setting that emphasized learn
ing facts and single right answers;
others would profit more from a pro
gram emphasizing many ideas and
possibilities, staying aware of alterna
tive solutions to problems."
"Since most of us would like our
children to be good at both kinds
of learning," Professor Ward noted
in his report, educators should at
tempt to find ways to interest the low-
IQ highly-creative free-wheelers in the
ritual, single-answer problems. Con
versely, they should try to stimulate
the interest of high-IQ youngsters
who are uncomfortable with multi
solution problems.
Professor Ward observed that the
"motivational variable' —the involve
ment in the task, the willingness to
maintain attention for a long period

—was present in these tests also. He
also noted that both high- and low-IQ
youngsters were consistent in the
lengths of time spent "before pro
claiming they had no more ideas."
Ward was not surprised to find that
those who persisted the longest pro
duced the greatest number of ideas.
