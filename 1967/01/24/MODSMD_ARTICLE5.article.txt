# 'HUMAN PICTURE'
## Fay Recounts JFK Days 
### MIKE MORTON 
"John Kennedy's true greatness
rested not only in the brillance,
courage, and other lofty virtues he em
bodied, but also in his appreciation for
and involvement in the very simple
emotions, accomplishments, and plea
sures of other people."
The speaker is Paul "Red" Fay, four
years Undersecretary of the Navy
and twenty years friend of the late
President. Through personal reminis
cences of Kennedy in his book, The
Pleasure of His Company, Fay has
presented to the world what many
critics call "an extraordinarily human
picture" of the President.
Asked about the origins of his book,
Fay revealed that he was, in effect,
commissioned by Kennedy. Referring
to Fay's unique exposure to power and
history-making as Undersecretary and
before, the President said, "You've got
an obligation to write about it."
Fay also received encouragement
from Senator Robert Kennedy; Bobby
pointed out that Fay's friendship with
the President from his days in the
Pacific to the White House would al
low him to present a picture of JFK
up to that time unseen by the public.
Earlier Works
Fay's book is noticeably different
from earlier works of members of the
New Frontier (Salinger, Sorensen,
Schlesinger, and others) concerning
the President. From his vantage point
of close personal friend, as opposed to
that of political associate, Fay in
tended his book to "show the warm,

thoughtful, compassionate, and very
human side of Jack Kennedy."
Concerning Bobby Kennedy's politi
cal future, Fay stated that the Senator
has an "excellent" chance to succeed
to the Presidency in 1972. Regarding
the 1968 Presidential race, he is con
vinced that LBJ will seek and receive

the Democratic nomination and that
Bobby will not oppose him. However,
he feels that Michigan's Governor
George Romney can defeat Johnson.
He commented that Johnson's
chances for re-election will be hurt by
several factors, e.g., Vietnam, tax in

creases, but primarily by a growing
"popular disenchantment' with John
son's style of big government.
Vietnam
On the always touchy subject of
Vietnam, Fay pointed out the differ
ences between the war under Ken
nedy and under Johnson. Though he
explained that LBJ is fighting a far
larger war than his predecessor, Fay
brought out a more subtle difference
of Johnson's conduct of the war as
opposed to Kennedy's.
While Kennedy looked upon the mili
tary as strictly subordinate to the po
litical (especially after the Bay of
Pigs) and conducted the fighting with
this in mind, Johnson seems to be re
lying more on the Joint Chiefs of Staff
than the Secretary of Defense for ad
vice on policy, according to Fay.
When asked about the controversy
over William Manchester's book, The
Death of a President, Fay said that he
definitely believes that Mrs. Kennedy
has a justifiable case. He asserted that
Jackie was under a tremendous emo
tional strain following the assassina
tion and undoubtedly made certain
statements not intended for publica
tion. Thus, by her action, she is not
attempting to suppress history but
merely trying to preserve privacy for
her personal feelings.
Members of the University com
munity interested in learning more
about JFK through the experiences of
one of his closest personal friends are
invited to hear Mr. Fay's address at
Dinkelspiel this evening at 7:45 p.m.
