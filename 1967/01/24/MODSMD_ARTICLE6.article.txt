# Packer, LASSU Hassle Over Education Committee Selection
## 
### CHRIS RIGOS 
Vice-Provost Herbert L. Packer,
chairman of the Executive Committee
for the study of education at Stanford,
has declared that he disagrees with
LASSU's proposal for the election by
LASSU of the student members of
the committee.
He proclaimed, "The study is a gen
eral review of all aspects of Stanford's
educational programs in order to con
tinue the process of making education
at Stanford as meaningful as an edu
cational experience can be. When the
committee's recommendations have
been made, perhaps that will be the
time for scrutiny by a democratically
elected group.
"But," he insisted, "the qualities of
interest, talent, and critical intelli
gence that we want in the student

members are not to be determined by
a majority vote. The political com
ponent has no place early in the
study."
Informed last week of President
Sterling's intent to appoint the stu
dent members to the Packer Commit
tee, the Speaker of the Student Legis
lature, Tom Forstenzer, declared that
these members "can't speak for the
student body." Packer, in response,
asserted, "His statement misses the
point in suggesting that the students
should speak for the whole student
body."
'Unimportant'
Packer felt it was "unimportant and
impossible" for any person to repre
sent the whole student body on such
diverse issues. "What will they
(LASSU) do —have a referendum on
the issues the committee is to investi
gate? I understand their (LASSU's)
point, but I disagree with it."
""The chairman planned to include
two or three students and five or six
faculty members on the committee.
The students would be selected on the
basis of either their applications or
interviews.
Commenting on LASSU's attempt
to discourage student application be
cause of the present basis of selection,
Professor Packer maintained, "This
study is going to be the best oppor
tunity for the students in this decade
to have their views expressed in Uni
versity policies. I would view it as a
major misfortune from the standpoint
of the student interest, if any such
short-sighted boycott should prevail."
More Than One
Forstenzer had earlier announced,
"The Student Legislature is not com
mitted to only one form of protest."
The committee would "certainly not"
condescend to accept LASSU's recom
mendations," Packer said. "The Presi
dent will appoint all members —both
faculty and students. It is up to the
students to provide the widest possible
selection. If not, the misfortune lies in
the hands of those urging the boy
cott."
The LASSU Speaker termed the
committee's general purposes as ex
pressed by President Sterling as "high
ly laudable," but wondered whether
the commiteee should deal with day
to-day campus issues like OFF. Pro
fessor Packer maintained, however,
that, "It is impossible to make any
clear-cut distinction between day-to
day and larger issues."
There "is not a dichotomy, but a
spectrum. The OFF issue is intimately
related to the larger issue of the Uni
versity's residential policy which the
study will confront." Packer added,
however, "There will be no effort made
to delay resolution of the issue."
