# 'Observer' Offers Views Through In-Depth Reports

### DAN SNELL 
"No house organ that's trying to
put over a biased image would ever
print articles like those on LSD and
contraceptives which we printed in our
January issue," said Harry Press, edi
tor of The Stanford Observer.
Press, organizer of the monthly
newspaper sent to alumni and parents
of present students, was city editor
of the now defunct San Francisco
News-Call Bulletin (for nine years).
He explained in a recent interview
with The Daily that Robert Pierce, di
rector of the Alumni Association, orgi
nated the Idea for The Observer last
spring. Pierce envisioned The Ob
server as filling the "communications
gap" between the University and what
Press calls Its "audience," the alumni
and parents.
Communications Gap
This audience is likely to hear about
the more sensational campus events
from their local newspapers, according
to Press, but they do not get in-depth
reporting. Many of these readers are
very interested in the University, and
were not informed about unspectacu
lar but nonetheless important campus
ffairs until The Observer started pub
lication last June.
Other University publications have
small circulations and specialized ar

tides, Press said. He does not believe
his paper seeks to fulfill the same pur
pose as the quarterly, Stanford To
day, a magazine sent to about the
same persons as The Observer. "The
Observer is like Newsweek, and Stan
ford Today is like Harper's," Press
said of the relationship between the
two,
105,000 Copies
The Observer, which usually has
eight pages, is sent free to 105,000
alumni and parents and costs about
$5000 an issue. The Observer, like
The Daily, is set in type at the Univer
sity Press but is taken to the Menlo-
Atherton Recorder to be printed.
The articles and pictures for The
Observer are taken almost entirely
from news releases from the Univer
sity's News and Publications Depart
men. Few articles are written just for
The Observer, and very few of these
are written by students.
Sole Staffer
The Observer has no staff besides
Press, and he prepares the newspaper
alone with some help from the News
and Publication staff. The depart
ment's director, Robert Byers, helps
plan the paper with Press, but no
one else has any control over The
Observer's content.
Press was emphatic in stating that

neither University administrators,
trustees, or other officials see the pa
per before it is distributed. "We are
not censored in any way," Press said.
The Observer's publication, financed
from the University's general fund,
has been paid for only through the
academic year ending this June. Dr.
Chilton R. Bush, formerly of the Stan
ford Department of Communications,
is now carrying out a readership sur
vey to help the trustees decide wheth
er the paper is worth continuing.
According to Press, The Observer Is
the first publication of its kind in the
country. He said letters to the paper
have almost all expressed fa/orable
opinions. Readers praised the paper
for reprinting large parts of speeches
given at Stanford by President Ster
ling, ASSU President David Harris,
and others.
Receptive Reader
Members of The Observer's audience
who wrote said they liked the concise
ness and clarity of the paper's news
articles. One reader who graduated
in the class of 1909 phoned Press's
office to laud the publication and noted
that it made him realize that "students
now are no more crazy than when he
was at Stanford."
When asked what The Observer's
goal was, Press answered it was "to

tell the audience everything that is
going on at Stanfordâ€”and not from
any platform." The paper tries to be
an unbiased voice, according to Press,
in the atmosphere of change and con
troversy in the University. "We're not
competing with anything," he said,

"and we have not axe to grind."
The Observer's future hinges, of
course, on the trustees' decision on
granting it more funds. Press foresees
no major change in the paper though
it is "still experimental." He wants to
continue printing in-depth articles like

the recent one on athletes at Stanford
and stories in a news-feature style.
The paper will never have editorials,
according to Press, because its pur
pose is simply to tell the news. "The
readers," Press said, "should be al
lowed to form their own opinions."
