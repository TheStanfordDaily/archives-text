' .' WASHINGTON, D.C. — When
~ a-Wheaton College student, ex
ppTJed from school for joining a
fraternity, petitioned an Illinois
qpurt in 1866 to force his read
jttission, the judges waived juris
diction in the case.
"So long as the rules violate
• neither divine nor human law,"
die court said, "we have ho more
•authority to interfere than we
liave to control the domestic
discipline of a father in his fam-
The court's reasoning reflected
the ancient English common law
doctrine of In loco parentis
»vhich has dominated the think
ing of college administrators un
recently.
.I','. But now, following strong en
dorsement of student rights by
, several national academic or
ganizations and prompted by
student demands for policy-mak
ing power, college authorities
■ape beginning—often hesitantly
-: ?n^ o re-examine the doctrine.
viThe faculties of Michigan
'iState University and the Uni
versity of Kentucky have re
cently approved recommenda
tions for sweeping liberaliza
tion of regulations of student
activity, while several other col
ldges are studying changes in
Ujfeir campus rules.

Although many of the schools'
plans are still in the
tory stage, a proposal to revamp
the University of Kentucky dis
ciplinary system was app roved
last week by the school's Fac
ulty Senate.
The plan, the result of a year
long study, was prepared 1:o re
place the school's informal sys
tem of investigating and han
dling of allegations of student
misconduct.
Under the proposed plan com
mittee chairman W. Gnrrett
Flickinger said, "discip li nary
punishments would be enforce
able only within the proposed
judicial systems."
The report, which must be ap
proved by the University's F;oard

of Trustees before implementa
tion, would em power the exist
ing student judicial board with
final authority over student dis
cipline decision's. Dean of Men
and the Dean of Women have
the power to overule the Uni
versity Judicial Board under
the present system.
Approval of the Kentucky pro
posals came at the same time as
the Michigan Sitate University
faculty was endorsing a plan to
liberalize student rules and
judicial procedure.
The report, prepared by a spe
cial faculty committee, recom
mened the establishment of a
student-faculty Supreme Court
to have ultimate authority over
student judicial decisions. This

authority now rests with the
deans of students.
The report also suggested the
appointment of a campus om
budsman to receive and investi
gate general student complaints.
The ombudsman, to be chosen
from the senior faculty, would
have access to all University of
ficials and would represent the
individual student in the large
campus bureaucracy.
The report, passed by a voice
vote of the Academic Council
last week, must now go to the
Academic Senate —composed of
all tenured accep
tance or rejection as a whole.
The Board of Trustees will make
the final judgment on the pro
posals.
