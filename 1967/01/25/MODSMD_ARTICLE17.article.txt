Brazil's PELE, acclaimed the
best soccer player of all time,
highlights a spectacular contest
between Santos of Sao Paolo
and River Plate of Buenos
Aires, Argentina, Sunday, Jan.

29, in the Los Angeles Coliseum.
The Coliseum, just finished
with the best of America's foot
ball, will have a taste of the
world's favorite football. An es
timated 900 million people
watched the World Cup on tele
vision last summer, and Pele
was one of the reasons.
Pele dominated the Interna
tional soccer scene ever since
he made his debut at age 17 on
Brazil's 1958 World Cup cham
pionship team.
Turns Down $2,000,000
INTER of Milan, one of the
best professional soccer teams
of Europe, once offered Pele a
million dollars and another mil
lion to compensate his Brazil
ian club â€”Brazil kept Pele.
Pele's teammates include such
outstanding national players as
goalkeeper Gylmar, halfback
Zito, and young left wing Edu,
considered by many as Pele's
successor.
River Plate has a silver pla
ted tradition and currently leads
the Argentine professional cir
cuit.
Rides are being organized to
and from Los Angeles for the
game. Those interested should
sign a list posted on the soccer
bulletin board (next to the
Coaches lockerroom) in the
Men's Gym, as early as possible
today.
