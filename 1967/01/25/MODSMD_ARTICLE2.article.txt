# Cal's Academic Senate Strongly Condemns Board Of Regents' Dismissal Of Clark Kerr
## 
### 
In an emergency meeting of the
Berkeley Academic Senate yesterday,
1000 members of the Cal faculty 'ut
terly" condemned the dismissal of
Clark Kerr by the Board of Regents.
About 1500 students stood outside
the student union and listened to the
deliberations over a loudspeaker. As
the faculty members filed out, they
were given a standing ovation by the
students.
The resolution which passed was di
vided into five major points. It was
Introduced by Kenneth Stampp, pro

fessor of history, on behalf of five
other professors.
"The reckless and precipitate dis
missal of President Clark Kerr has
stunned the academic community, not
only in California, but throughout the
whole nation," read the resolution.
The faculty decried the destructive
political intervention in the affairs of
the University. "To prevent further
damage to the University will require
prompt, vigorous statesman-like ac
tion by California political leaders, the

Board of Regents, the chancellors, fac
ulty and students," they stated.
The five points considered indispens
able were:
a) that the Board of Regents stren
ously resists political intervention;
b) that the Legislature provide ade
quate financial support to sustain the
present high quality and growth of
the University;
c) that the state's historical policy of
tuition-free education for all qualified
Californians not be abandoned by the
University;

d) that the advice and consent of the
faculty be secured in decisions affect
ing the appointment and tenure of the
president; and
e) that effective channels be de
veloped whereby the several faculty
can communicate to regents concern
ing major policy matters before the
board.
A further resolution stated that the
first statement was made in order to
"improve education and insure co
operation with the new president."
The responsibility for carrying out the
resolution was delegated to the Senate
Policy Committee.
California citizens were told of their
betrayal by the Board of Regents in
an amendment in the form of an open
letter. It read: "You have entrusted
the care of your University to the
Board of Regents. The majority of
that board has betrayed your trust.
As of today no reputable educator
would assume the presidency of that
university which yesterday was the
envy of every other state.
"We the faculty of the University
of California at Berkeley condemn
utterly the dismissal of Clark Kerr
by the Board of Regents. We ask you
to help us to reestablish political in
dependence of your university and
to keep it great."
The Senate Policy committee was
instructed to clarify "today." They
will determine when the day will end.
An ad hoc committee is organizing
a meeting for public discussion in the
Greek Theater on campus. The pro
fessors in their academic robes will de
liver addresses at that time.
