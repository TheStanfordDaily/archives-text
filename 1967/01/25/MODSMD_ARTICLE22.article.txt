(Editor's Note: The following
are excerpts from President Ster
ling's convocation address, de
livered yesterday In Memorial
Auditorium. The annual winter
convocation is sponsored by
Stanford Today and Tomorrow.)
Mr. Chairman, Ladies and
Gentlemen:
Once again I would extend my
compliments, my thanks and my
best wishes to the Stanford To
day and Tomorrow Committee.
The students with whom I first
discussed the possibility of an
S.T.&T. program more than a
decade ago thought that such a
program might serve a useful
purpose. I hope that it still does.
The major problems confront
ing universities do not change
radically from year to year. Ma
jor problems have a way of
persisting, even among shifts
of emphasis. But the spirit and
willingness to consider change
should always exist. Last year at
this Convocation I pointed out
that the university as an institu
tion has been going through a
period of critical review during
the past decade and more, and
that the range and intensity of
this review during the past
decade and more, and that the
range and intensity of this re
view have increase in recent
years. This review is by no
means confined to the United
States. It is happening in na
tions, new and old, around the
world. . . .
It is not surprising that under
the pressure of larger enroll
ments universities have grown
both in number and in size, and
that educational budgets have
Increased. Nor is it surprising
that participation in the solution
of social problems has both
stimulated and obliged univer
sities to re-examine curricula.
Still in the context of univer
sity, it is important to note that
education throughout the world
gets its major financial support
from public funds —in most coun
tries almost entirely so. In only
a few countries, such as Japan,
the Philippines and the United
States, is the private sector of
higher education noteworthy,
and it is mainly in the United
States that institutions in the
private sector rival in strength
and distinction those in the pub
lic sector.
The financial dependence of
universities upon public funds
invariably raises the specter of
possible political influence — a
specter which has recently ap
peared on local horizons. Politi
cal influence can be exercised in
a variety of ways. It is a func
tion of government to determine
priorities among national needs,
and there is ample evidence, in
old countries and now, that the
allocation of public funds to edu
cation can be influenced by these
priorities.
Those who are zealous to pre
serve the educational indepen
dence and self-determination of
the university should be alert to
risks and dangers involved in
ever allowing the university, as
university, to become a political
instrument or a pawn in the
hands of those who would use
it as such, be those hands in
side or out the university. . . .
Prosperity And Interest
During the past two decades
the United States has been pros
perous, and its general public
has manifest greater interest in
education at all levels. Education
has benefited from both the pros
perity and the interest. . . .
Stanford, like so many of her
sister institutions, has been in
many ways the beneficiary of
this support and interest. In con
sequence, there has been change.
Since 1950, the student body has
increased in size by approxi

mately 40 per cent; the regular
faculty by 170 per cent. The an
nual fiscal operation of the Uni
versity, exclusive of improve
ments and additions to physical
plant, has increased by a factor
of 10. The building program has
not kept pace with increase in
enrollment and faculty. There is
less academic space per student
today than there was 15 years
ago, although substantial gains
have been made during the past
three years and more are in
early prospect.
The University's endownment
has increased more than four
fold, yet the income from it pays
for a smaller fraction of an
nual operating costs than it did
in 1950. Tuition has increased
from $600 in 1950, but it too pays
a smaller fraction of operating
costs today than it did then. The
University currently depends on
gifts and grants to support
about 30 per cent of its annual
operating expenditures, and to
pay for new buildings and the
rehabilitation of old ones. And
given the understandable fact
that donors have their own pref
erences as to the use of their
gifts, it follows that their pref
erences do not always coincide
with what the University regards
as its most urgent needs. In
other words, the University's
priorities of need may be modi
fied by the designation of gifts.
Two Problems
Manifestly, the University has
to address itself to problems
growing out of this siuation. Let
me mention two. One of these
problems — one which I men
tioned last year—is that of size.
It is clear that, despite the gains
recently made, we still need
more academic space adequately
to accommodate our present
faculty afid student body. And
it would be my hope that we
could continue to make gains as
a high priority in the faculty
student ratio, thereby adding fur
ther flexibility and strength to
teaching and research. There is
pressing need to add to library
resources and, as tuition in
creases, to amplify student fi
nancial aid. If these needs are to
be met out of available and
anticipated resources, with the
objective of improvinb academic
quality, serious consideration
must be given to the size of the
student body, not least of all at
the graduate level.
Another problem, not unre
lated to size, is that of the resi
dence university. Stanford be
gan as essentially a residence
university, and the aspiration
to continue as such is woven into
a large part of its history. But
increase in student numbers, ad
ditional mobility provided by the
automobile, and the capital cost
of new residence halls have com
bined to produce a situation in
which Stanford is less a resi
dence university than it used to
be, and to raise the question as
to whether the aspiration to be
a residence university is viable.
I would also recall from the not
so-distant past the study of un
dergraduate education at Stan
ford which was made a decade
ago. That study was directed
mainly to the possibility and de
sirability of curricular change.
It resulted, among other things,
in the General Studies program;
it also led to the development of
the overseas campuses for un
dergraduates. It is during the de
cade since that study was made
that Stanford has experienced
its major increase in enrollment,
particularly at the graduate
level, and has approximately
doubled the size of its faculty.
It is also during that dec&de that
the academic potential of the
student body has notably in
creased.

So, as I think you know, an
other study is now under way.
Last autumn a small planning
committee, including the presi
dent of the study body and an
other student, recommended that
the new study be as compre
hensive as possible; that it in
clude consideration of both grad
uate and undergraduate educa
tion, both curricular and extra
curricular programs; and that it
search out opportunities for in
novation, flexibility and im
provement.
Another Study
An executive committee of
seven or eight persons will be
in charge of the study. Professor
Herbert Packer, recently ap
pointed Vice-Provost for Aca
demic Planning and Programs,
is Chairman of the committee.
The committee will utilize a va
riety of task forces or ad hoc
committees as needed, so that
many faculty, students and of
ficers of the University will be
involved.
It is anticipated that the study
will extend through most if not
all of the next academic year,
but this does not mean that the
Committee will recommend no
thing until the study is com
pleted; rather it is intended that
recommendations will flow from
the Committee throughout the
course of the study. For instance,
priority attention will be given
to the concept of the residence
university and the problsm
therein entailed, including the
"Off" issue, the value of such
projects as Grove House, the
roles of Tutors, Sponsors and
.Resident Associates. It is to be
expected, therefore, that during
the next eighteen months or so
this University community will
be broadly and actively engaged
in this new study and in con
sidertion of the recommenda
tions which it produces. And I
dare say that one of the major
eventual considerations will be
this: How can educational re
view and improvement be, so to
speak, institutionalized and
thereby eliminate periodic and,
in Professor Parker's phrase,
"somewhat convulsive" attacks
on the problem.
University Government
If this is to be achieved, at
tention must be directed to Uni
versity government. This subject
needs attention for other reasons
as well, including that of size.
I have been interested to note
in the professional journals on
higher education that this sub
ject of university government
has had increasing attention dur
ing the past three or four years.
This has come about, as I read
the journals, in part because of
size—as student enrollments and
faculty have increased in num
ber—and in part because the
need for educational review and
'change calls for mechanisms
which will make possible knowl
edgeable discussion and delibera
tion of educational programs in
terms of the resources available
to support them.
University government stems
from the Charter, the legisaltive
statute or the constitutional pro
vision by which a given institu
tion was established. These char
ters or statutes vest authority
and responsibility in Boards of
Trustees, Regents or Governors.
From these Boards, subordinate
authority and responsibilities are
delegate to faculty, students and
officers of the institution. This is
the established pattern and I do
not anticipate that there will be
basic change in it at least at an
early date.
New Mechanisms
But it is not of this pattern
which I speak when I suggest
the need for new mechanisms,
because there is opportunity for

new mechanisms within the pat
tern. For instance, the Board of
Trustees of this University has
a Committee of its membership
presently engaged in a study of
the Board's composition and or
ganization. The objective is to
make more effective use of the
very considerable time which
Trustees devote to Stanford af
fairs, and thereby to keep them
still more closely in touch with
the academic programs and
needs of the University.
As Trustee organization is be
ing considered, so too might the
organization of the faculty and
of the student body benefit from
re-examination. Given the size
of the faculty and of the student
body respectively, it is unlikely
that the total membership of
each can be effectively and reg
ularly engaged in deliberations
on educational pr ogram and pol
icy.
For the faculty, this invites
the possibility of electing a rep
resentative body small enough
for constructive discussion and
large enough to give adequate
voice to the seven Schools. For
the students, it invites consider
ation of the reorganization of
student government if the pres
ent organization is judged to be
lacking in representation or per
formance. For all segments of
the University, it invites critical
attention to the invention of
mechanisms which will improve
collaborative effort to advance
the University by orderly pro
cedures.
It would seem to me that the
educational review now under
way would be incomplete if it
did not direct attention to the
subject of university govern
ment.
Suggestions
Before each of these Convo
cations I have asked students
to suggest topics which I might
discuss. The suggestion which
heads the list this year is this:
How can a student best spend
his undergraduate years?"
This question is by no means
new. I suspect that teachers and
counsellors have been hearing
that question for generations. I
suspect also that answers vary
from generation to generation,
and that they vary also within
any student generation as each
student seeks counsel for him
self and his individual concerns.
In the depressed 1930'5, for in
stance, at the surface of concern
for most students was how to
muster the financial where
withal to stay in school, and
the question of whether they
could get a job upon graduation.
They had some preoccupation
with economic security. Their
interest in public affairs was, as
I recall, directed to two main
considerations: One related di
rectly to the depression and led
to the question whether democ
racy could cope with the ten
sions, the dislocations and the
despair which the depression
produced, or whether some
other form of government could
cope more adequately with such
problems. . . .
The G.l.'s
Before the 1930's had passed
into history, much of the world
was at war. When it was over,
tens of thousands of Gl's re
sumed their education. They
had lost time. They were pre
occupied with catching up. They
were good students, eager to
learn, eager to complete college
and to begin a career and a fam
ily. This mood persisted into
the early 1950'5. There had not
been time for the mood to
change much between the con
clusion of World War II and the
outbreak of hostilities in Korea.
And the early 1950's included

also the sinister and unforget
able episode of McCarthyism.
These years did not include
anything but the beginnings of
the Civil Rights movement begin
ings which were dramatized by
the spotlight on schools in Little
Rock, Arkansas. And, with all
due respect, the then President
of the United States did not
have the appeal to youth that
he had to older generations—
certainly not the appeal to
youth which emanated from
John Fitzgerald Kennedy. So
the students of the 1950's came
to be regarded as the "silent
generation," and perhaps under
standably so.
Thus, at different times and in
different contexts students have
asked the question: How best
can a student spend his under
graduate years?
Students In the 'AO's
What of the context in which
the students of the 1960's ask
this question? I have no expert
diagnosis, nor do I know of any,
that is unassailable. Nor do I
know of any generalization
which applies precisely to any
individual student. But let me
invite your consideration of a
few observations.
1. Not one of today's students
has personally experienced a
major depression or its conse
quences.
2. Very few of today's stu
dents have had direct experience
in war. And none has had ex
perience in a war, such as World
War 11, in which the motivation
to serve was so broadly and na
tionally based. The war they
know is undeclared and far
away; it implements a national
policy which they and others
question and is administered by
a government which does not
command their full confidence.
3. The student generation of
the late 1950's and the 1960's is
the first to live under the threat
of nuclear war. I cannot mea
sure the impact of that threat,
but I should judge from conver
sations with many students that
many of you are affected by it.
Greater Pressure
4. Today's students have been
subjected to greater pressures
than their predecessors for get
ting into the college of their
choice—pressures which derive
in part from the great increase
in national enrollment. They
have felt these pressures since
age 14 or 15, and find, in col
lege, that these pressures con
tinue for those who, in increas
ing numbers, plan to go on to
graduate and professional
schools.
5. Partly because our society
is affluent and partly because a
burst of new knowledge has in
vited greater specialization, to
today's students, unlike those of
the 1930'5, are confronted with
multiple choice of opportunity.
In the opinion of one observer,
the very richness and diversity
of opportunity produce a sense
of insecurity. What choice
should the student make? What
if the choice is wrong?
6. I mentioned a moment ago
the appeal which President Ken
nedy had for youth. For many
students, their response to this
appeal may be seen in their
participation in the Peace Corps,
in the Civil Rights movement
and in other less publicized en
terprizes by which they seek to
help the underprivileged. Such
participation is for them the
deed and not merely the word
of idealism.
Time For Idealism
Youth is peculiarly the time
for idealism and not infrequent
ly in this generation or others
this idealism is coupled with re
jectlon. The degree and depth
of this rejection are always
hard, if not impossible, to mea
sure. Today some students seem
to reject specialization—they
want to be the Renaissance and
some, presumably hope for a
part, and perhaps this number
is greater, reject the value-sys
tem of their parents and puzzle
themselves as to why this par
ticular rejection is not better
understood. Hence the so-called
generation-gap and, I suppose,
a part of the credibility gap.
There is, for some, rejection of
what they regard as slavishness
to conformity—conformity in
dress, in conventional manners,
and in such things as the am
bition to have a house in the
suburbs, a two-car family and
a colored televsiion within easy
reach.
I dare say that these observa
tions do not embrace the whole
context out of which today's
students ask the question, "How
best can I spend my undergrad
uate years?" But I suggest that
they are significant parts of the
whole, The context in which the
question is asked varies with
time and circumstance, but the
question itself is a hardy per
ennial.
Partial Answer
Part of the answer lies within
cach of you. You know better
than anyone else why you came

to college. I take it that you
wanted to do so, that few, if
any, of you came against your
will and only in response to
some parental or other pres
sure. And you should know bet
ter than anyone else why you
wanted to come. I should as
sume that the basic reason was,
of course, to continue your edu
cation. The opportunity to do so
in a new environment away
from home was probably not
unappealing to you. The pros
pect of enjoying a kind of new
freedom had its attractions as
well as anxieties. Many, if not
most, of you thought of college
as a natural, even necessary,
next step in preparation for a
career. I doubt that you thought
of college and a baccalaureate
degree simply as a status sym
bol. How consciously you looked
forward to college as an experi
ence in self development I don't
know, but it was probably some
where in your stream of con
sciousness. In any event, you
should know better than any
one else why you wanted to
come to college.
How aware were you when
you came that knowledge is the
most powerful of all human re
sources, that there is more
knowledge today than ever be
fore, and that its rate of accum
ulation continues to accelerate.
Since knowledge is the most im
portant commodity a college or

university has to offer, it fol
lows that a student's major op
portunity is to absorb and col
late as much of it as possible so
that he may harness and hitch
it and put it to work. . .
Commitment
There is a word in our vocabu
lary which I hear many of you
use with considerable frequency.
It is the word "commitment."
As I hear you use the word, it
is most frequently associated
with a sense of urgency to im
prove society, including the Uni
versity. I delight in this, even
though my delight is sometimes
punctuated with problems. I de
light in it because it bespeaks
a concern about the welfare of
mankind and a desire to be of
service I know of no commit
ment which can result in better
self development or in greater
service to mankind than a com
mitment to learn, a commitment
to knowledge. And this is the
prime commitment which I
would urge you to make. The
basic purpose of the educational
review now under way, in which
important contributions are ex
pected from you, is to discover
better ways and opportunities
to acquire knowledge and to put
knowledge to work so that bet
ter ways may be found to solve
problems great and small which
beset society.
The whole purpose of knowl
edge is to liberate—to liberate

from ignorance, from perjudice,
and from obsolence. There is
much knowledge to be discov
ered; this, too, is a mission of
the university—and probably its
most exciting mission.
Two Observations
Let me conclude with two ob
servations and questions.
First: As you spend your un
dergraduate years, acquiring
knowledge in the classrooms, in
the library and laboratory, in
discussions among yourselves
and with others, by participat
ing in a variety of activities, in
seeking, as we all do, to discover
and refine a set of values by
which each of us can live a
happy and helpful life, please
ponder this question: What
value a criticism, a conviction
or a principle which is not based
on knowledge?
Second: The vital statistics of
this nation indicate that in a few
years half of our population will
be less than 30 years of age.
This prospect should be very en
couraging for those of you who
accept the cliche that no one
over thirty can be trusted. But
not for long after those under
30 will have constituted a ma
jority, you will join the minor
ity. Will you then be knowledge
able enough to be trustworthy?
I believe that you will, and
that knowledge and trustworthi
ness will mean much to Stan
ford tomorrow, as it does today.

ling's convocation address, de
livered yesterday In Memorial
Auditorium. The annual winter
convocation is sponsored by
Stanford Today and Tomorrow.)
Mr. Chairman, Ladies and
Gentlemen:
Once again I would extend my
compliments, my thanks and my
best wishes to the Stanford To
day and Tomorrow Committee.
The students with whom I first
discussed the possibility of an
S.T.&T. program more than a
decade ago thought that such a
program might serve a useful
purpose. I hope that it still does.
The major problems confront
ing universities do not change
radically from year to year. Ma
jor problems have a way of
persisting, even among shifts
of emphasis. But the spirit and
willingness to consider change
should always exist. Last year at
this Convocation I pointed out
that the university as an institu
tion has been going through a
period of critical review during
the past decade and more, and
that the range and intensity of
this review during the past
decade and more, and that the
range and intensity of this re
view have increase in recent
years. This review is by no
means confined to the United
States. It is happening in na
tions, new and old, around the
world. . . .
It is not surprising that under
the pressure of larger enroll
ments universities have grown
both in number and in size, and
that educational budgets have
Increased. Nor is it surprising
that participation in the solution
of social problems has both
stimulated and obliged univer
sities to re-examine curricula.
Still in the context of univer
sity, it is important to note that
education throughout the world
gets its major financial support
from public funds —in most coun
tries almost entirely so. In only
a few countries, such as Japan,
the Philippines and the United
States, is the private sector of
higher education noteworthy,
and it is mainly in the United
States that institutions in the
private sector rival in strength
and distinction those in the pub
lic sector.
The financial dependence of
universities upon public funds
invariably raises the specter of
possible political influence — a
specter which has recently ap
peared on local horizons. Politi
cal influence can be exercised in
a variety of ways. It is a func
tion of government to determine
priorities among national needs,
and there is ample evidence, in
old countries and now, that the
allocation of public funds to edu
cation can be influenced by these
priorities.
Those who are zealous to pre
serve the educational indepen
dence and self-determination of
the university should be alert to
risks and dangers involved in
ever allowing the university, as
university, to become a political
instrument or a pawn in the
hands of those who would use
it as such, be those hands in
side or out the university. . . .
Prosperity And Interest
During the past two decades
the United States has been pros
perous, and its general public
has manifest greater interest in
education at all levels. Education
has benefited from both the pros
perity and the interest. . . .
Stanford, like so many of her
sister institutions, has been in
many ways the beneficiary of
this support and interest. In con
sequence, there has been change.
Since 1950, the student body has
increased in size by approxi

mately 40 per cent; the regular
faculty by 170 per cent. The an
nual fiscal operation of the Uni
versity, exclusive of improve
ments and additions to physical

of 10. The building program has
not kept pace with increase in
enrollment and faculty. There is
less academic space per student
today than there was 15 years
ago, although substantial gains
have been made during the past
three years and more are in
early prospect.
The University's endownment
has increased more than four
fold, yet the income from it pays
for a smaller fraction of an
nual operating costs than it did
in 1950. Tuition has increased
from $600 in 1950, but it too pays
a smaller fraction of operating
costs today than it did then. The
University currently depends on
gifts and grants to support
about 30 per cent of its annual
operating expenditures, and to
pay for new buildings and the
rehabilitation of old ones. And
given the understandable fact
that donors have their own pref
erences as to the use of their
gifts, it follows that their pref
erences do not always coincide
with what the University regards
as its most urgent needs. In
other words, the University's
priorities of need may be modi
fied by the designation of gifts.
Two Problems
Manifestly, the University has
to address itself to problems
growing out of this siuation. Let
me mention two. One of these
problems — one which I men
tioned last year—is that of size.
It is clear that, despite the gains
recently made, we still need
more academic space adequately
to accommodate our present
faculty afid student body. And
it would be my hope that we
could continue to make gains as
a high priority in the faculty
student ratio, thereby adding fur
ther flexibility and strength to
teaching and research. There is
pressing need to add to library
resources and, as tuition in
creases, to amplify student fi
nancial aid. If these needs are to
be met out of available and
anticipated resources, with the
objective of improvinb academic
quality, serious consideration
must be given to the size of the
student body, not least of all at
the graduate level.
Another problem, not unre
lated to size, is that of the resi
dence university. Stanford be
gan as essentially a residence
university, and the aspiration
to continue as such is woven into
a large part of its history. But
increase in student numbers, ad
ditional mobility provided by the
automobile, and the capital cost
of new residence halls have com
bined to produce a situation in
which Stanford is less a resi
dence university than it used to
be, and to raise the question as
to whether the aspiration to be
a residence university is viable.
I would also recall from the not
so-distant past the study of un
dergraduate education at Stan
ford which was made a decade
ago. That study was directed
mainly to the possibility and de
sirability of curricular change.
It resulted, among other things,
in the General Studies program;
it also led to the development of
the overseas campuses for un
dergraduates. It is during the de
cade since that study was made
that Stanford has experienced
its major increase in enrollment,
particularly at the graduate
level, and has approximately
doubled the size of its faculty.
It is also during that dec&de that
the academic potential of the
student body has notably in
creased.

So, as I think you know, an
other study is now under way.
Last autumn a small planning
committee, including the presi
dent of the study body and an
other student, recommended that
the new study be as compre
hensive as possible; that it in
clude consideration of both grad

curricular programs; and that it
search out opportunities for in

provement.
Another Study
An executive committee of
seven or eight persons will be
in charge of the study. Professor
Herbert Packer, recently ap
pointed Vice-Provost for Aca
demic Planning and Programs,
is Chairman of the committee.
The committee will utilize a va
riety of task forces or ad hoc
committees as needed, so that
many faculty, students and of
ficers of the University will be
involved.
It is anticipated that the study
will extend through most if not
all of the next academic year,
but this does not mean that the
Committee will recommend no
thing until the study is com
pleted; rather it is intended that
recommendations will flow from
the Committee throughout the
course of the study. For instance,
priority attention will be given
to the concept of the residence
university and the problsm
therein entailed, including the
"Off" issue, the value of such
projects as Grove House, the
roles of Tutors, Sponsors and
.Resident Associates. It is to be
expected, therefore, that during
the next eighteen months or so
this University community will
be broadly and actively engaged
in this new study and in con
sidertion of the recommenda
tions which it produces. And I
dare say that one of the major
eventual considerations will be
this: How can educational re
view and improvement be, so to
speak, institutionalized and
thereby eliminate periodic and,
in Professor Parker's phrase,
"somewhat convulsive" attacks
on the problem.
University Government
If this is to be achieved, at
tention must be directed to Uni
versity government. This subject
needs attention for other reasons
as well, including that of size.
I have been interested to note
in the professional journals on
higher education that this sub
ject of university government
has had increasing attention dur
ing the past three or four years.
This has come about, as I read
the journals, in part because of
size—as student enrollments and
faculty have increased in num
ber—and in part because the
need for educational review and
'change calls for mechanisms
which will make possible knowl
edgeable discussion and delibera
tion of educational programs in
terms of the resources available
to support them.
University government stems
from the Charter, the legisaltive
statute or the constitutional pro
vision by which a given institu
tion was established. These char
ters or statutes vest authority
and responsibility in Boards of
Trustees, Regents or Governors.
From these Boards, subordinate
authority and responsibilities are
delegate to faculty, students and
officers of the institution. This is
the established pattern and I do
not anticipate that there will be
basic change in it at least at an
early date.
New Mechanisms
But it is not of this pattern
which I speak when I suggest
the need for new mechanisms,
because there is opportunity for

new mechanisms within the pat
tern. For instance, the Board of
Trustees of this University has
a Committee of its membership
presently engaged in a study of
the Board's composition and or
ganization. The objective is to
make more effective use of the
very considerable time which
Trustees devote to Stanford af
fairs, and thereby to keep them
still more closely in touch with
the academic programs and
needs of the University.
As Trustee organization is be
ing considered, so too might the
organization of the faculty and
of the student body benefit from
re-examination. Given the size
of the faculty and of the student
body respectively, it is unlikely
that the total membership of
each can be effectively and reg
ularly engaged in deliberations
on educational pr ogram and pol
icy.
For the faculty, this invites
the possibility of electing a rep
resentative body small enough
for constructive discussion and
large enough to give adequate
voice to the seven Schools. For
the students, it invites consider
ation of the reorganization of
student government if the pres
ent organization is judged to be
lacking in representation or per
formance. For all segments of
the University, it invites critical
attention to the invention of
mechanisms which will improve
collaborative effort to advance
the University by orderly pro
cedures.
It would seem to me that the
educational review now under
way would be incomplete if it
did not direct attention to the
subject of university govern
ment.
Suggestions
Before each of these Convo
cations I have asked students
to suggest topics which I might
discuss. The suggestion which
heads the list this year is this:
How can a student best spend
his undergraduate years?"
This question is by no means
new. I suspect that teachers and
counsellors have been hearing
that question for generations. I
suspect also that answers vary
from generation to generation,
and that they vary also within
any student generation as each
student seeks counsel for him
self and his individual concerns.
In the depressed 1930'5, for in
stance, at the surface of concern
for most students was how to
muster the financial where
withal to stay in school, and
the question of whether they
could get a job upon graduation.
They had some preoccupation
with economic security. Their
interest in public affairs was, as
I recall, directed to two main
considerations: One related di
rectly to the depression and led
to the question whether democ
racy could cope with the ten
sions, the dislocations and the
despair which the depression
produced, or whether some
other form of government could
cope more adequately with such
problems. . . .
The G.l.'s
Before the 1930's had passed
into history, much of the world
was at war. When it was over,
tens of thousands of Gl's re
sumed their education. They
had lost time. They were pre
occupied with catching up. They
were good students, eager to
learn, eager to complete college
and to begin a career and a fam
ily. This mood persisted into
the early 1950'5. There had not
been time for the mood to
change much between the con
clusion of World War II and the
outbreak of hostilities in Korea.
And the early 1950's included

also the sinister and unforget
able episode of McCarthyism.
These years did not include
anything but the beginnings of
the Civil Rights movement begin
ings which were dramatized by
the spotlight on schools in Little
Rock, Arkansas. And, with all
due respect, the then President
of the United States did not
have the appeal to youth that
he had to older generations—
certainly not the appeal to
youth which emanated from
John Fitzgerald Kennedy. So
the students of the 1950's came
to be regarded as the "silent
generation," and perhaps under
standably so.
Thus, at different times and in
different contexts students have
asked the question: How best
can a student spend his under
graduate years?
Students In the 'AO's
What of the context in which
the students of the 1960's ask
this question? I have no expert
diagnosis, nor do I know of any,
that is unassailable. Nor do I
know of any generalization
which applies precisely to any
individual student. But let me
invite your consideration of a
few observations.
1. Not one of today's students
has personally experienced a
major depression or its conse
quences.
2. Very few of today's stu
dents have had direct experience
in war. And none has had ex
perience in a war, such as World
War 11, in which the motivation
to serve was so broadly and na
tionally based. The war they
know is undeclared and far
away; it implements a national
policy which they and others
question and is administered by
a government which does not
command their full confidence.
3. The student generation of
the late 1950's and the 1960's is
the first to live under the threat
of nuclear war. I cannot mea
sure the impact of that threat,
but I should judge from conver
sations with many students that
many of you are affected by it.
Greater Pressure
4. Today's students have been
subjected to greater pressures
than their predecessors for get
ting into the college of their
choice—pressures which derive
in part from the great increase
in national enrollment. They
have felt these pressures since
age 14 or 15, and find, in col
lege, that these pressures con
tinue for those who, in increas
ing numbers, plan to go on to
graduate and professional
schools.
5. Partly because our society
is affluent and partly because a
burst of new knowledge has in
vited greater specialization, to
today's students, unlike those of
the 1930'5, are confronted with
multiple choice of opportunity.
In the opinion of one observer,
the very richness and diversity
of opportunity produce a sense
of insecurity. What choice
should the student make? What
if the choice is wrong?
6. I mentioned a moment ago
the appeal which President Ken
nedy had for youth. For many
students, their response to this
appeal may be seen in their
participation in the Peace Corps,
in the Civil Rights movement
and in other less publicized en
terprizes by which they seek to
help the underprivileged. Such
participation is for them the
deed and not merely the word
of idealism.
Time For Idealism
Youth is peculiarly the time
for idealism and not infrequent
ly in this generation or others
this idealism is coupled with re
jectlon. The degree and depth
of this rejection are always
hard, if not impossible, to mea
sure. Today some students seem
to reject specialization—they
want to be the Renaissance and
some, presumably hope for a
part, and perhaps this number
is greater, reject the value-sys
tem of their parents and puzzle
themselves as to why this par
ticular rejection is not better
understood. Hence the so-called
generation-gap and, I suppose,
a part of the credibility gap.
There is, for some, rejection of
what they regard as slavishness
to conformity—conformity in
dress, in conventional manners,
and in such things as the am
bition to have a house in the
suburbs, a two-car family and
a colored televsiion within easy
reach.
I dare say that these observa
tions do not embrace the whole
context out of which today's
students ask the question, "How
best can I spend my undergrad
uate years?" But I suggest that
they are significant parts of the
whole, The context in which the
question is asked varies with
time and circumstance, but the
question itself is a hardy per
ennial.
Partial Answer
Part of the answer lies within
cach of you. You know better
than anyone else why you came

to college. I take it that you
wanted to do so, that few, if
any, of you came against your
will and only in response to
some parental or other pres
sure. And you should know bet
ter than anyone else why you
wanted to come. I should as
sume that the basic reason was,
of course, to continue your edu
cation. The opportunity to do so
in a new environment away
from home was probably not
unappealing to you. The pros
pect of enjoying a kind of new
freedom had its attractions as
well as anxieties. Many, if not
most, of you thought of college
as a natural, even necessary,
next step in preparation for a
career. I doubt that you thought
of college and a baccalaureate
degree simply as a status sym
bol. How consciously you looked
forward to college as an experi
ence in self development I don't
know, but it was probably some
where in your stream of con
sciousness. In any event, you
should know better than any
one else why you wanted to
come to college.
How aware were you when
you came that knowledge is the
most powerful of all human re
sources, that there is more
knowledge today than ever be
fore, and that its rate of accum
ulation continues to accelerate.
Since knowledge is the most im
portant commodity a college or

university has to offer, it fol
lows that a student's major op
portunity is to absorb and col
late as much of it as possible so
that he may harness and hitch
it and put it to work. . .
Commitment
There is a word in our vocabu
lary which I hear many of you
use with considerable frequency.
It is the word "commitment."
As I hear you use the word, it
is most frequently associated
with a sense of urgency to im
prove society, including the Uni
versity. I delight in this, even
though my delight is sometimes
punctuated with problems. I de
light in it because it bespeaks
a concern about the welfare of
mankind and a desire to be of
service I know of no commit
ment which can result in better
self development or in greater
service to mankind than a com
mitment to learn, a commitment
to knowledge. And this is the
prime commitment which I
would urge you to make. The
basic purpose of the educational
review now under way, in which
important contributions are ex
pected from you, is to discover
better ways and opportunities
to acquire knowledge and to put
knowledge to work so that bet
ter ways may be found to solve
problems great and small which
beset society.
The whole purpose of knowl
edge is to liberate—to liberate

from ignorance, from perjudice,
and from obsolence. There is
much knowledge to be discov
ered; this, too, is a mission of
the university—and probably its
most exciting mission.
Two Observations
Let me conclude with two ob
servations and questions.
First: As you spend your un
dergraduate years, acquiring
knowledge in the classrooms, in
the library and laboratory, in
discussions among yourselves
and with others, by participat
ing in a variety of activities, in
seeking, as we all do, to discover
and refine a set of values by
which each of us can live a
happy and helpful life, please
ponder this question: What
value a criticism, a conviction
or a principle which is not based
on knowledge?
Second: The vital statistics of
this nation indicate that in a few
years half of our population will
be less than 30 years of age.
This prospect should be very en
couraging for those of you who
accept the cliche that no one
over thirty can be trusted. But
not for long after those under
30 will have constituted a ma
jority, you will join the minor
ity. Will you then be knowledge
able enough to be trustworthy?
I believe that you will, and
that knowledge and trustworthi
ness will mean much to Stan
ford tomorrow, as it does today.
(Editor's Note: The following
are excerpts from President Ster
ling's convocation address, de
livered yesterday In Memorial
Auditorium. The annual winter
convocation is sponsored by
Stanford Today and Tomorrow.)
Mr. Chairman, Ladies and
Gentlemen:
Once again I would extend my
compliments, my thanks and my
best wishes to the Stanford To
day and Tomorrow Committee.
The students with whom I first
discussed the possibility of an
S.T.&T. program more than a
decade ago thought that such a
program might serve a useful
purpose. I hope that it still does.
The major problems confront
ing universities do not change
radically from year to year. Ma
jor problems have a way of
persisting, even among shifts
of emphasis. But the spirit and
willingness to consider change
should always exist. Last year at
this Convocation I pointed out
that the university as an institu
tion has been going through a
period of critical review during
the past decade and more, and
that the range and intensity of
this review during the past
decade and more, and that the
range and intensity of this re
view have increase in recent
years. This review is by no
means confined to the United
States. It is happening in na
tions, new and old, around the
world. . . .
It is not surprising that under
the pressure of larger enroll
ments universities have grown
both in number and in size, and
that educational budgets have
Increased. Nor is it surprising
that participation in the solution
of social problems has both
stimulated and obliged univer
sities to re-examine curricula.
Still in the context of univer
sity, it is important to note that
education throughout the world
gets its major financial support
from public funds —in most coun
tries almost entirely so. In only
a few countries, such as Japan,
the Philippines and the United
States, is the private sector of
higher education noteworthy,
and it is mainly in the United
States that institutions in the
private sector rival in strength
and distinction those in the pub
lic sector.
The financial dependence of
universities upon public funds
invariably raises the specter of
possible political influence — a
specter which has recently ap
peared on local horizons. Politi
cal influence can be exercised in
a variety of ways. It is a func
tion of government to determine
priorities among national needs,
and there is ample evidence, in
old countries and now, that the
allocation of public funds to edu
cation can be influenced by these
priorities.
Those who are zealous to pre
serve the educational indepen
dence and self-determination of
the university should be alert to
risks and dangers involved in
ever allowing the university, as
university, to become a political
instrument or a pawn in the
hands of those who would use
it as such, be those hands in
side or out the university. . . .
Prosperity And Interest
During the past two decades
the United States has been pros
perous, and its general public
has manifest greater interest in
education at all levels. Education
has benefited from both the pros
perity and the interest. . . .
Stanford, like so many of her
sister institutions, has been in
many ways the beneficiary of
this support and interest. In con
sequence, there has been change.
Since 1950, the student body has
increased in size by approxi

mately 40 per cent; the regular
faculty by 170 per cent. The an
nual fiscal operation of the Uni
versity, exclusive of improve
ments and additions to physical
plant, has increased by a factor
of 10. The building program has
not kept pace with increase in
enrollment and faculty. There is
less academic space per student
today than there was 15 years
ago, although substantial gains
have been made during the past
three years and more are in
early prospect.
The University's endownment
has increased more than four
fold, yet the income from it pays
for a smaller fraction of an
nual operating costs than it did
in 1950. Tuition has increased
from $600 in 1950, but it too pays
a smaller fraction of operating
costs today than it did then. The
University currently depends on
gifts and grants to support
about 30 per cent of its annual
operating expenditures, and to
pay for new buildings and the
rehabilitation of old ones. And
given the understandable fact
that donors have their own pref
erences as to the use of their
gifts, it follows that their pref
erences do not always coincide
with what the University regards
as its most urgent needs. In
other words, the University's
priorities of need may be modi
fied by the designation of gifts.
Two Problems
Manifestly, the University has
to address itself to problems
growing out of this siuation. Let
me mention two. One of these
problems — one which I men
tioned last year—is that of size.
It is clear that, despite the gains
recently made, we still need
more academic space adequately
to accommodate our present
faculty afid student body. And
it would be my hope that we
could continue to make gains as
a high priority in the faculty
student ratio, thereby adding fur
ther flexibility and strength to
teaching and research. There is
pressing need to add to library
resources and, as tuition in
creases, to amplify student fi
nancial aid. If these needs are to
be met out of available and
anticipated resources, with the
objective of improvinb academic
quality, serious consideration
must be given to the size of the
student body, not least of all at
the graduate level.
Another problem, not unre
lated to size, is that of the resi
dence university. Stanford be
gan as essentially a residence
university, and the aspiration
to continue as such is woven into
a large part of its history. But
increase in student numbers, ad
ditional mobility provided by the
automobile, and the capital cost
of new residence halls have com
bined to produce a situation in
which Stanford is less a resi
dence university than it used to
be, and to raise the question as
to whether the aspiration to be
a residence university is viable.
I would also recall from the not
so-distant past the study of un
dergraduate education at Stan
ford which was made a decade
ago. That study was directed
mainly to the possibility and de
sirability of curricular change.
It resulted, among other things,
in the General Studies program;
it also led to the development of
the overseas campuses for un
dergraduates. It is during the de
cade since that study was made
that Stanford has experienced
its major increase in enrollment,
particularly at the graduate
level, and has approximately
doubled the size of its faculty.
It is also during that dec&de that
the academic potential of the
student body has notably in
creased.

So, as I think you know, an
other study is now under way.
Last autumn a small planning
committee, including the presi
dent of the study body and an
other student, recommended that
the new study be as compre
hensive as possible; that it in
clude consideration of both grad
uate and undergraduate educa
tion, both curricular and extra
curricular programs; and that it
search out opportunities for in
novation, flexibility and im
provement.
Another Study
An executive committee of
seven or eight persons will be
in charge of the study. Professor
Herbert Packer, recently ap
pointed Vice-Provost for Aca
demic Planning and Programs,
is Chairman of the committee.
The committee will utilize a va
riety of task forces or ad hoc
committees as needed, so that
many faculty, students and of
ficers of the University will be
involved.
It is anticipated that the study
will extend through most if not
all of the next academic year,
but this does not mean that the
Committee will recommend no
thing until the study is com
pleted; rather it is intended that
recommendations will flow from
the Committee throughout the
course of the study. For instance,
priority attention will be given
to the concept of the residence
university and the problsm
therein entailed, including the
"Off" issue, the value of such
projects as Grove House, the
roles of Tutors, Sponsors and
.Resident Associates. It is to be
expected, therefore, that during
the next eighteen months or so
this University community will
be broadly and actively engaged
in this new study and in con
sidertion of the recommenda
tions which it produces. And I
dare say that one of the major
eventual considerations will be
this: How can educational re
view and improvement be, so to
speak, institutionalized and
thereby eliminate periodic and,
in Professor Parker's phrase,
"somewhat convulsive" attacks
on the problem.
University Government
If this is to be achieved, at
tention must be directed to Uni
versity government. This subject
needs attention for other reasons
as well, including that of size.
I have been interested to note
in the professional journals on
higher education that this sub
ject of university government
has had increasing attention dur
ing the past three or four years.
This has come about, as I read
the journals, in part because of
size—as student enrollments and
faculty have increased in num
ber—and in part because the
need for educational review and
'change calls for mechanisms
which will make possible knowl
edgeable discussion and delibera
tion of educational programs in
terms of the resources available
to support them.
University government stems
from the Charter, the legisaltive
statute or the constitutional pro
vision by which a given institu
tion was established. These char
ters or statutes vest authority
and responsibility in Boards of
Trustees, Regents or Governors.
From these Boards, subordinate
authority and responsibilities are
delegate to faculty, students and
officers of the institution. This is
the established pattern and I do
not anticipate that there will be
basic change in it at least at an
early date.
New Mechanisms
But it is not of this pattern
which I speak when I suggest
the need for new mechanisms,
because there is opportunity for

new mechanisms within the pat
tern. For instance, the Board of
Trustees of this University has
a Committee of its membership
presently engaged in a study of
the Board's composition and or
ganization. The objective is to
make more effective use of the
very considerable time which
Trustees devote to Stanford af
fairs, and thereby to keep them
still more closely in touch with
the academic programs and
needs of the University.
As Trustee organization is be
ing considered, so too might the
organization of the faculty and
of the student body benefit from
re-examination. Given the size
of the faculty and of the student
body respectively, it is unlikely
that the total membership of
each can be effectively and reg
ularly engaged in deliberations
on educational pr ogram and pol
icy.
For the faculty, this invites
the possibility of electing a rep
resentative body small enough
for constructive discussion and
large enough to give adequate
voice to the seven Schools. For
the students, it invites consider
ation of the reorganization of
student government if the pres
ent organization is judged to be
lacking in representation or per
formance. For all segments of
the University, it invites critical
attention to the invention of
mechanisms which will improve
collaborative effort to advance
the University by orderly pro
cedures.
It would seem to me that the
educational review now under
way would be incomplete if it
did not direct attention to the
subject of university govern
ment.
Suggestions
Before each of these Convo
cations I have asked students
to suggest topics which I might
discuss. The suggestion which
heads the list this year is this:
How can a student best spend
his undergraduate years?"
This question is by no means
new. I suspect that teachers and
counsellors have been hearing
that question for generations. I
suspect also that answers vary
from generation to generation,
and that they vary also within
any student generation as each
student seeks counsel for him
self and his individual concerns.
In the depressed 1930'5, for in
stance, at the surface of concern
for most students was how to
muster the financial where
withal to stay in school, and
the question of whether they
could get a job upon graduation.
They had some preoccupation
with economic security. Their
interest in public affairs was, as
I recall, directed to two main
considerations: One related di
rectly to the depression and led
to the question whether democ
racy could cope with the ten
sions, the dislocations and the
despair which the depression
produced, or whether some
other form of government could
cope more adequately with such
problems. . . .
The G.l.'s
Before the 1930's had passed
into history, much of the world
was at war. When it was over,
tens of thousands of Gl's re

had lost time. They were pre
occupied with catching up. They
were good students, eager to

the early 1950'5. There had not
been time for the mood to
change much between the con
clusion of World War II and the
outbreak of hostilities in Korea.
And the early 1950's included

also the sinister and unforget
able episode of McCarthyism.
These years did not include
anything but the beginnings of
the Civil Rights movement begin
ings which were dramatized by
the spotlight on schools in Little
Rock, Arkansas. And, with all
due respect, the then President
of the United States did not
have the appeal to youth that
he had to older generations—
certainly not the appeal to
youth which emanated from
John Fitzgerald Kennedy. So
the students of the 1950's came
to be regarded as the "silent

standably so.
Thus, at different times and in
different contexts students have
asked the question: How best
can a student spend his under
graduate years?
Students In the 'AO's

the first to live under the threat
of nuclear war. I cannot mea

but I should judge from conver
sations with many students that
many of you are affected by it.
Greater Pressure
4. Today's students have been
subjected to greater pressures
than their predecessors for get
ting into the college of their
choice—pressures which derive
in part from the great increase
in national enrollment. They
have felt these pressures since
age 14 or 15, and find, in col

5. Partly because our society

today's students, unlike those of
the 1930'5, are confronted with
multiple choice of opportunity.
In the opinion of one observer,
the very richness and diversity
of opportunity produce a sense
of insecurity. What choice
should the student make? What
if the choice is wrong?
6. I mentioned a moment ago
the appeal which President Ken
nedy had for youth. For many
students, their response to this
appeal may be seen in their
participation in the Peace Corps,
in the Civil Rights movement
and in other less publicized en

participation is for them the
deed and not merely the word
of idealism.
Time For Idealism
Youth is peculiarly the time
for idealism and not infrequent
ly in this generation or others
this idealism is coupled with re
jectlon. The degree and depth
of this rejection are always
hard, if not impossible, to mea
sure. Today some students seem

want to be the Renaissance and
some, presumably hope for a
part, and perhaps this number
is greater, reject the value-sys

themselves as to why this par
ticular rejection is not better

generation-gap and, I suppose,
a part of the credibility gap.
There is, for some, rejection of

and in such things as the am

than anyone else why you came

you came that knowledge is the
most powerful of all human re
sources, that there is more
knowledge today than ever be
fore, and that its rate of accum
ulation continues to accelerate.
Since knowledge is the most im
portant commodity a college or

university has to offer, it fol
lows that a student's major op
portunity is to absorb and col
late as much of it as possible so
that he may harness and hitch
it and put it to work. . .
Commitment
There is a word in our vocabu
lary which I hear many of you
use with considerable frequency.
It is the word "commitment."
As I hear you use the word, it
is most frequently associated
with a sense of urgency to im
prove society, including the Uni
versity. I delight in this, even
though my delight is sometimes
punctuated with problems. I de
light in it because it bespeaks
a concern about the welfare of
mankind and a desire to be of
service I know of no commit
ment which can result in better
self development or in greater
service to mankind than a com
mitment to learn, a commitment
to knowledge. And this is the
prime commitment which I
would urge you to make. The
basic purpose of the educational
review now under way, in which
important contributions are ex
pected from you, is to discover
better ways and opportunities
to acquire knowledge and to put
knowledge to work so that bet
ter ways may be found to solve
problems great and small which
beset society.
The whole purpose of knowl
edge is to liberate—to liberate

from ignorance, from perjudice,
and from obsolence. There is
much knowledge to be discov
ered; this, too, is a mission of
the university—and probably its
most exciting mission.
Two Observations
Let me conclude with two ob
servations and questions.
First: As you spend your un
dergraduate years, acquiring
knowledge in the classrooms, in
the library and laboratory, in
discussions among yourselves
and with others, by participat
ing in a variety of activities, in
seeking, as we all do, to discover
and refine a set of values by
which each of us can live a
happy and helpful life, please
ponder this question: What
value a criticism, a conviction
or a principle which is not based
on knowledge?
Second: The vital statistics of
this nation indicate that in a few
years half of our population will
be less than 30 years of age.
This prospect should be very en
couraging for those of you who
accept the cliche that no one
over thirty can be trusted. But
not for long after those under
30 will have constituted a ma
jority, you will join the minor
ity. Will you then be knowledge
able enough to be trustworthy?
I believe that you will, and
that knowledge and trustworthi
ness will mean much to Stan
ford tomorrow, as it does today.
(Editor's Note: The following
are excerpts from President Ster
ling's convocation address, de
livered yesterday In Memorial
Auditorium. The annual winter
convocation is sponsored by
Stanford Today and Tomorrow.)
Mr. Chairman, Ladies and
Gentlemen:
Once again I would extend my
compliments, my thanks and my
best wishes to the Stanford To
day and Tomorrow Committee.
The students with whom I first
discussed the possibility of an
S.T.&T. program more than a
decade ago thought that such a
program might serve a useful
purpose. I hope that it still does.
The major problems confront
ing universities do not change
radically from year to year. Ma
jor problems have a way of
persisting, even among shifts
of emphasis. But the spirit and
willingness to consider change
should always exist. Last year at
this Convocation I pointed out
that the university as an institu
tion has been going through a
period of critical review during
the past decade and more, and
that the range and intensity of
this review during the past
decade and more, and that the
range and intensity of this re
view have increase in recent
years. This review is by no
means confined to the United
States. It is happening in na
tions, new and old, around the
world. . . .
It is not surprising that under
the pressure of larger enroll
ments universities have grown
both in number and in size, and
that educational budgets have
Increased. Nor is it surprising
that participation in the solution
of social problems has both
stimulated and obliged univer
sities to re-examine curricula.
Still in the context of univer
sity, it is important to note that
education throughout the world
gets its major financial support
from public funds —in most coun
tries almost entirely so. In only
a few countries, such as Japan,
the Philippines and the United
States, is the private sector of
higher education noteworthy,
and it is mainly in the United
States that institutions in the
private sector rival in strength
and distinction those in the pub
lic sector.
The financial dependence of
universities upon public funds
invariably raises the specter of
possible political influence — a
specter which has recently ap
peared on local horizons. Politi
cal influence can be exercised in
a variety of ways. It is a func
tion of government to determine
priorities among national needs,
and there is ample evidence, in
old countries and now, that the
allocation of public funds to edu
cation can be influenced by these
priorities.
Those who are zealous to pre
serve the educational indepen
dence and self-determination of
the university should be alert to
risks and dangers involved in
ever allowing the university, as
university, to become a political
instrument or a pawn in the
hands of those who would use
it as such, be those hands in
side or out the university. . . .
Prosperity And Interest
During the past two decades
the United States has been pros
perous, and its general public
has manifest greater interest in
education at all levels. Education
has benefited from both the pros
perity and the interest. . . .
Stanford, like so many of her
sister institutions, has been in
many ways the beneficiary of
this support and interest. In con
sequence, there has been change.
Since 1950, the student body has
increased in size by approxi

mately 40 per cent; the regular
faculty by 170 per cent. The an
nual fiscal operation of the Uni
versity, exclusive of improve
ments and additions to physical
plant, has increased by a factor
of 10. The building program has
not kept pace with increase in
enrollment and faculty. There is
less academic space per student
today than there was 15 years
ago, although substantial gains
have been made during the past
three years and more are in
early prospect.
The University's endownment
has increased more than four
fold, yet the income from it pays
for a smaller fraction of an
nual operating costs than it did
in 1950. Tuition has increased
from $600 in 1950, but it too pays
a smaller fraction of operating
costs today than it did then. The
University currently depends on
gifts and grants to support
about 30 per cent of its annual
operating expenditures, and to
pay for new buildings and the
rehabilitation of old ones. And
given the understandable fact
that donors have their own pref
erences as to the use of their
gifts, it follows that their pref
erences do not always coincide
with what the University regards
as its most urgent needs. In
other words, the University's
priorities of need may be modi
fied by the designation of gifts.
Two Problems
Manifestly, the University has
to address itself to problems
growing out of this siuation. Let
me mention two. One of these
problems — one which I men
tioned last year—is that of size.
It is clear that, despite the gains
recently made, we still need
more academic space adequately
to accommodate our present
faculty afid student body. And
it would be my hope that we
could continue to make gains as
a high priority in the faculty
student ratio, thereby adding fur
ther flexibility and strength to
teaching and research. There is
pressing need to add to library
resources and, as tuition in
creases, to amplify student fi
nancial aid. If these needs are to
be met out of available and
anticipated resources, with the
objective of improvinb academic
quality, serious consideration
must be given to the size of the
student body, not least of all at
the graduate level.
Another problem, not unre
lated to size, is that of the resi
dence university. Stanford be
gan as essentially a residence
university, and the aspiration
to continue as such is woven into
a large part of its history. But
increase in student numbers, ad
ditional mobility provided by the
automobile, and the capital cost
of new residence halls have com
bined to produce a situation in
which Stanford is less a resi
dence university than it used to
be, and to raise the question as
to whether the aspiration to be
a residence university is viable.
I would also recall from the not
so-distant past the study of un
dergraduate education at Stan
ford which was made a decade
ago. That study was directed
mainly to the possibility and de
sirability of curricular change.
It resulted, among other things,
in the General Studies program;
it also led to the development of
the overseas campuses for un
dergraduates. It is during the de
cade since that study was made
that Stanford has experienced
its major increase in enrollment,
particularly at the graduate
level, and has approximately
doubled the size of its faculty.
It is also during that dec&de that
the academic potential of the
student body has notably in
creased.

So, as I think you know, an
other study is now under way.
Last autumn a small planning
committee, including the presi
dent of the study body and an
other student, recommended that
the new study be as compre
hensive as possible; that it in
clude consideration of both grad
uate and undergraduate educa
tion, both curricular and extra
curricular programs; and that it
search out opportunities for in
novation, flexibility and im
provement.
Another Study
An executive committee of
seven or eight persons will be
in charge of the study. Professor
Herbert Packer, recently ap
pointed Vice-Provost for Aca
demic Planning and Programs,
is Chairman of the committee.
The committee will utilize a va
riety of task forces or ad hoc
committees as needed, so that
many faculty, students and of
ficers of the University will be
involved.
It is anticipated that the study
will extend through most if not
all of the next academic year,
but this does not mean that the
Committee will recommend no
thing until the study is com
pleted; rather it is intended that
recommendations will flow from
the Committee throughout the
course of the study. For instance,
priority attention will be given
to the concept of the residence
university and the problsm
therein entailed, including the
"Off" issue, the value of such
projects as Grove House, the
roles of Tutors, Sponsors and
.Resident Associates. It is to be
expected, therefore, that during
the next eighteen months or so
this University community will
be broadly and actively engaged
in this new study and in con
sidertion of the recommenda
tions which it produces. And I
dare say that one of the major
eventual considerations will be
this: How can educational re
view and improvement be, so to
speak, institutionalized and
thereby eliminate periodic and,
in Professor Parker's phrase,
"somewhat convulsive" attacks
on the problem.
University Government
If this is to be achieved, at
tention must be directed to Uni
versity government. This subject
needs attention for other reasons
as well, including that of size.
I have been interested to note
in the professional journals on
higher education that this sub
ject of university government
has had increasing attention dur
ing the past three or four years.
This has come about, as I read
the journals, in part because of
size—as student enrollments and
faculty have increased in num
ber—and in part because the
need for educational review and
'change calls for mechanisms
which will make possible knowl
edgeable discussion and delibera
tion of educational programs in
terms of the resources available
to support them.
University government stems
from the Charter, the legisaltive
statute or the constitutional pro
vision by which a given institu
tion was established. These char
ters or statutes vest authority
and responsibility in Boards of
Trustees, Regents or Governors.
From these Boards, subordinate
authority and responsibilities are
delegate to faculty, students and
officers of the institution. This is
the established pattern and I do
not anticipate that there will be
basic change in it at least at an
early date.
New Mechanisms
But it is not of this pattern
which I speak when I suggest
the need for new mechanisms,
because there is opportunity for

new mechanisms within the pat
tern. For instance, the Board of
Trustees of this University has
a Committee of its membership
presently engaged in a study of
the Board's composition and or
ganization. The objective is to
make more effective use of the
very considerable time which
Trustees devote to Stanford af
fairs, and thereby to keep them
still more closely in touch with
the academic programs and
needs of the University.
As Trustee organization is be
ing considered, so too might the
organization of the faculty and
of the student body benefit from
re-examination. Given the size
of the faculty and of the student
body respectively, it is unlikely
that the total membership of
each can be effectively and reg
ularly engaged in deliberations
on educational pr ogram and pol
icy.
For the faculty, this invites
the possibility of electing a rep
resentative body small enough
for constructive discussion and
large enough to give adequate
voice to the seven Schools. For
the students, it invites consider
ation of the reorganization of
student government if the pres
ent organization is judged to be
lacking in representation or per
formance. For all segments of
the University, it invites critical
attention to the invention of
mechanisms which will improve
collaborative effort to advance
the University by orderly pro
cedures.
It would seem to me that the
educational review now under
way would be incomplete if it
did not direct attention to the
subject of university govern
ment.
Suggestions
Before each of these Convo
cations I have asked students
to suggest topics which I might
discuss. The suggestion which
heads the list this year is this:
How can a student best spend
his undergraduate years?"
This question is by no means
new. I suspect that teachers and
counsellors have been hearing
that question for generations. I
suspect also that answers vary
from generation to generation,
and that they vary also within
any student generation as each
student seeks counsel for him
self and his individual concerns.
In the depressed 1930'5, for in
stance, at the surface of concern
for most students was how to
muster the financial where
withal to stay in school, and
the question of whether they
could get a job upon graduation.
They had some preoccupation
with economic security. Their
interest in public affairs was, as
I recall, directed to two main
considerations: One related di
rectly to the depression and led
to the question whether democ
racy could cope with the ten
sions, the dislocations and the
despair which the depression
produced, or whether some
other form of government could
cope more adequately with such
problems. . . .
The G.l.'s
Before the 1930's had passed
into history, much of the world
was at war. When it was over,
tens of thousands of Gl's re
sumed their education. They
had lost time. They were pre
occupied with catching up. They
were good students, eager to
learn, eager to complete college
and to begin a career and a fam
ily. This mood persisted into
the early 1950'5. There had not
been time for the mood to
change much between the con
clusion of World War II and the
outbreak of hostilities in Korea.
And the early 1950's included

also the sinister and unforget
able episode of McCarthyism.
These years did not include
anything but the beginnings of
the Civil Rights movement begin
ings which were dramatized by
the spotlight on schools in Little
Rock, Arkansas. And, with all
due respect, the then President
of the United States did not
have the appeal to youth that
he had to older generations—
certainly not the appeal to
youth which emanated from
John Fitzgerald Kennedy. So
the students of the 1950's came
to be regarded as the "silent
generation," and perhaps under
standably so.
Thus, at different times and in
different contexts students have
asked the question: How best
can a student spend his under
graduate years?
Students In the 'AO's
What of the context in which
the students of the 1960's ask
this question? I have no expert
diagnosis, nor do I know of any,
that is unassailable. Nor do I
know of any generalization
which applies precisely to any
individual student. But let me
invite your consideration of a
few observations.
1. Not one of today's students
has personally experienced a
major depression or its conse
quences.
2. Very few of today's stu
dents have had direct experience
in war. And none has had ex
perience in a war, such as World
War 11, in which the motivation
to serve was so broadly and na
tionally based. The war they
know is undeclared and far
away; it implements a national
policy which they and others
question and is administered by
a government which does not
command their full confidence.
3. The student generation of
the late 1950's and the 1960's is
the first to live under the threat
of nuclear war. I cannot mea
sure the impact of that threat,
but I should judge from conver
sations with many students that
many of you are affected by it.
Greater Pressure
4. Today's students have been
subjected to greater pressures
than their predecessors for get
ting into the college of their
choice—pressures which derive
in part from the great increase
in national enrollment. They
have felt these pressures since
age 14 or 15, and find, in col
lege, that these pressures con
tinue for those who, in increas
ing numbers, plan to go on to
graduate and professional
schools.
5. Partly because our society
is affluent and partly because a
burst of new knowledge has in
vited greater specialization, to
today's students, unlike those of
the 1930'5, are confronted with
multiple choice of opportunity.
In the opinion of one observer,
the very richness and diversity
of opportunity produce a sense
of insecurity. What choice
should the student make? What
if the choice is wrong?
6. I mentioned a moment ago
the appeal which President Ken
nedy had for youth. For many
students, their response to this
appeal may be seen in their
participation in the Peace Corps,
in the Civil Rights movement
and in other less publicized en
terprizes by which they seek to
help the underprivileged. Such
participation is for them the
deed and not merely the word
of idealism.
Time For Idealism
Youth is peculiarly the time
for idealism and not infrequent
ly in this generation or others
this idealism is coupled with re
jectlon. The degree and depth
of this rejection are always
hard, if not impossible, to mea
sure. Today some students seem
to reject specialization—they
want to be the Renaissance and
some, presumably hope for a
part, and perhaps this number
is greater, reject the value-sys
tem of their parents and puzzle
themselves as to why this par
ticular rejection is not better
understood. Hence the so-called
generation-gap and, I suppose,
a part of the credibility gap.
There is, for some, rejection of
what they regard as slavishness
to conformity—conformity in
dress, in conventional manners,
and in such things as the am
bition to have a house in the
suburbs, a two-car family and
a colored televsiion within easy
reach.
I dare say that these observa
tions do not embrace the whole
context out of which today's
students ask the question, "How
best can I spend my undergrad
uate years?" But I suggest that
they are significant parts of the
whole, The context in which the
question is asked varies with
time and circumstance, but the
question itself is a hardy per
ennial.
Partial Answer
Part of the answer lies within
cach of you. You know better
than anyone else why you came

to college. I take it that you
wanted to do so, that few, if
any, of you came against your
will and only in response to
some parental or other pres
sure. And you should know bet
ter than anyone else why you
wanted to come. I should as
sume that the basic reason was,
of course, to continue your edu
cation. The opportunity to do so
in a new environment away
from home was probably not
unappealing to you. The pros
pect of enjoying a kind of new
freedom had its attractions as
well as anxieties. Many, if not
most, of you thought of college
as a natural, even necessary,
next step in preparation for a
career. I doubt that you thought
of college and a baccalaureate
degree simply as a status sym
bol. How consciously you looked
forward to college as an experi
ence in self development I don't
know, but it was probably some
where in your stream of con
sciousness. In any event, you
should know better than any
one else why you wanted to
come to college.
How aware were you when
you came that knowledge is the
most powerful of all human re
sources, that there is more
knowledge today than ever be
fore, and that its rate of accum
ulation continues to accelerate.
Since knowledge is the most im
portant commodity a college or

university has to offer, it fol
lows that a student's major op
portunity is to absorb and col
late as much of it as possible so
that he may harness and hitch
it and put it to work. . .
Commitment
There is a word in our vocabu
lary which I hear many of you
use with considerable frequency.
It is the word "commitment."
As I hear you use the word, it
is most frequently associated
with a sense of urgency to im
prove society, including the Uni
versity. I delight in this, even
though my delight is sometimes
punctuated with problems. I de
light in it because it bespeaks
a concern about the welfare of
mankind and a desire to be of
service I know of no commit
ment which can result in better
self development or in greater
service to mankind than a com
mitment to learn, a commitment
to knowledge. And this is the
prime commitment which I
would urge you to make. The
basic purpose of the educational
review now under way, in which
important contributions are ex
pected from you, is to discover
better ways and opportunities
to acquire knowledge and to put
knowledge to work so that bet
ter ways may be found to solve
problems great and small which
beset society.
The whole purpose of knowl
edge is to liberate—to liberate

from ignorance, from perjudice,
and from obsolence. There is
much knowledge to be discov
ered; this, too, is a mission of
the university—and probably its
most exciting mission.
Two Observations
Let me conclude with two ob
servations and questions.
First: As you spend your un
dergraduate years, acquiring

this nation indicate that in a few
years half of our population will
be less than 30 years of age.
This prospect should be very en
couraging for those of you who
accept the cliche that no one
over thirty can be trusted. But
not for long after those under
30 will have constituted a ma
jority, you will join the minor

able enough to be trustworthy?
I believe that you will, and
that knowledge and trustworthi
ness will mean much to Stan
ford tomorrow, as it does today.

Mr. Chairman, Ladies and

Once again I would extend my

best wishes to the Stanford To
day and Tomorrow Committee.
The students with whom I first
discussed the possibility of an
S.T.&T. program more than a
decade ago thought that such a
program might serve a useful
purpose. I hope that it still does.
The major problems confront
ing universities do not change
radically from year to year. Ma
jor problems have a way of
persisting, even among shifts
of emphasis. But the spirit and
willingness to consider change
should always exist. Last year at
this Convocation I pointed out
that the university as an institu

period of critical review during
the past decade and more, and
that the range and intensity of
this review during the past
decade and more, and that the
range and intensity of this re
view have increase in recent
years. This review is by no
means confined to the United
States. It is happening in na
tions, new and old, around the
world. . . .
It is not surprising that under
the pressure of larger enroll
ments universities have grown
both in number and in size, and
that educational budgets have
Increased. Nor is it surprising
that participation in the solution
of social problems has both
stimulated and obliged univer

Still in the context of univer

education throughout the world
gets its major financial support

a few countries, such as Japan,
the Philippines and the United

The financial dependence of

a variety of ways. It is a func

Prosperity And Interest
During the past two decades
the United States has been pros

has manifest greater interest in
education at all levels. Education
has benefited from both the pros
perity and the interest. . . .
Stanford, like so many of her
sister institutions, has been in
many ways the beneficiary of
this support and interest. In con
sequence, there has been change.
Since 1950, the student body has
increased in size by approxi

mately 40 per cent; the regular
faculty by 170 per cent. The an
nual fiscal operation of the Uni
versity, exclusive of improve
ments and additions to physical

of 10. The building program has
not kept pace with increase in
enrollment and faculty. There is
less academic space per student

have been made during the past
three years and more are in
early prospect.
The University's endownment
has increased more than four

for a smaller fraction of an
nual operating costs than it did
in 1950. Tuition has increased
from $600 in 1950, but it too pays
a smaller fraction of operating
costs today than it did then. The
University currently depends on
gifts and grants to support
about 30 per cent of its annual
operating expenditures, and to
pay for new buildings and the
rehabilitation of old ones. And
given the understandable fact
that donors have their own pref

gifts, it follows that their pref
erences do not always coincide
with what the University regards
as its most urgent needs. In
other words, the University's
priorities of need may be modi

Two Problems
Manifestly, the University has
to address itself to problems
growing out of this siuation. Let
me mention two. One of these
problems — one which I men
tioned last year—is that of size.
It is clear that, despite the gains
recently made, we still need
more academic space adequately
to accommodate our present
faculty afid student body. And
it would be my hope that we
could continue to make gains as
a high priority in the faculty
student ratio, thereby adding fur
ther flexibility and strength to

pressing need to add to library

be met out of available and
anticipated resources, with the
objective of improvinb academic
quality, serious consideration
must be given to the size of the
student body, not least of all at
the graduate level.
Another problem, not unre
lated to size, is that of the resi
dence university. Stanford be
gan as essentially a residence
university, and the aspiration
to continue as such is woven into
a large part of its history. But
increase in student numbers, ad
ditional mobility provided by the
automobile, and the capital cost
of new residence halls have com
bined to produce a situation in
which Stanford is less a resi
dence university than it used to
be, and to raise the question as
to whether the aspiration to be
a residence university is viable.
I would also recall from the not

mainly to the possibility and de

It resulted, among other things,

it also led to the development of
the overseas campuses for un
dergraduates. It is during the de
cade since that study was made
that Stanford has experienced
its major increase in enrollment,
particularly at the graduate
level, and has approximately
doubled the size of its faculty.
It is also during that dec&de that
the academic potential of the
student body has notably in
creased.

So, as I think you know, an
other study is now under way.
Last autumn a small planning
committee, including the presi
dent of the study body and an
other student, recommended that
the new study be as compre
hensive as possible; that it in
clude consideration of both grad
uate and undergraduate educa
tion, both curricular and extra
curricular programs; and that it
search out opportunities for in
novation, flexibility and im
provement.
Another Study
An executive committee of
seven or eight persons will be
in charge of the study. Professor
Herbert Packer, recently ap
pointed Vice-Provost for Aca
demic Planning and Programs,
is Chairman of the committee.
The committee will utilize a va
riety of task forces or ad hoc
committees as needed, so that
many faculty, students and of
ficers of the University will be
involved.
It is anticipated that the study
will extend through most if not
all of the next academic year,
but this does not mean that the
Committee will recommend no
thing until the study is com
pleted; rather it is intended that
recommendations will flow from
the Committee throughout the
course of the study. For instance,
priority attention will be given
to the concept of the residence
university and the problsm
therein entailed, including the
"Off" issue, the value of such
projects as Grove House, the
roles of Tutors, Sponsors and
.Resident Associates. It is to be
expected, therefore, that during
the next eighteen months or so
this University community will
be broadly and actively engaged
in this new study and in con
sidertion of the recommenda
tions which it produces. And I
dare say that one of the major
eventual considerations will be
this: How can educational re
view and improvement be, so to
speak, institutionalized and
thereby eliminate periodic and,
in Professor Parker's phrase,
"somewhat convulsive" attacks
on the problem.
University Government
If this is to be achieved, at
tention must be directed to Uni
versity government. This subject
needs attention for other reasons
as well, including that of size.
I have been interested to note
in the professional journals on
higher education that this sub
ject of university government
has had increasing attention dur
ing the past three or four years.
This has come about, as I read
the journals, in part because of
size—as student enrollments and
faculty have increased in num
ber—and in part because the
need for educational review and
'change calls for mechanisms
which will make possible knowl
edgeable discussion and delibera
tion of educational programs in
terms of the resources available
to support them.
University government stems
from the Charter, the legisaltive
statute or the constitutional pro
vision by which a given institu
tion was established. These char
ters or statutes vest authority
and responsibility in Boards of
Trustees, Regents or Governors.
From these Boards, subordinate
authority and responsibilities are
delegate to faculty, students and
officers of the institution. This is
the established pattern and I do
not anticipate that there will be
basic change in it at least at an
early date.
New Mechanisms
But it is not of this pattern
which I speak when I suggest
the need for new mechanisms,
because there is opportunity for

new mechanisms within the pat
tern. For instance, the Board of
Trustees of this University has
a Committee of its membership
presently engaged in a study of
the Board's composition and or
ganization. The objective is to
make more effective use of the
very considerable time which
Trustees devote to Stanford af
fairs, and thereby to keep them
still more closely in touch with
the academic programs and
needs of the University.
As Trustee organization is be
ing considered, so too might the
organization of the faculty and
of the student body benefit from
re-examination. Given the size
of the faculty and of the student
body respectively, it is unlikely
that the total membership of
each can be effectively and reg
ularly engaged in deliberations
on educational pr ogram and pol
icy.
For the faculty, this invites
the possibility of electing a rep
resentative body small enough
for constructive discussion and
large enough to give adequate
voice to the seven Schools. For
the students, it invites consider
ation of the reorganization of
student government if the pres
ent organization is judged to be
lacking in representation or per
formance. For all segments of
the University, it invites critical
attention to the invention of
mechanisms which will improve
collaborative effort to advance
the University by orderly pro
cedures.
It would seem to me that the
educational review now under
way would be incomplete if it
did not direct attention to the
subject of university govern
ment.
Suggestions
Before each of these Convo
cations I have asked students
to suggest topics which I might
discuss. The suggestion which
heads the list this year is this:
How can a student best spend
his undergraduate years?"
This question is by no means
new. I suspect that teachers and
counsellors have been hearing
that question for generations. I
suspect also that answers vary
from generation to generation,
and that they vary also within
any student generation as each
student seeks counsel for him
self and his individual concerns.
In the depressed 1930'5, for in
stance, at the surface of concern
for most students was how to
muster the financial where
withal to stay in school, and
the question of whether they
could get a job upon graduation.
They had some preoccupation
with economic security. Their
interest in public affairs was, as
I recall, directed to two main
considerations: One related di
rectly to the depression and led
to the question whether democ
racy could cope with the ten
sions, the dislocations and the
despair which the depression
produced, or whether some
other form of government could
cope more adequately with such
problems. . . .
The G.l.'s
Before the 1930's had passed
into history, much of the world
was at war. When it was over,
tens of thousands of Gl's re
sumed their education. They
had lost time. They were pre
occupied with catching up. They
were good students, eager to
learn, eager to complete college
and to begin a career and a fam
ily. This mood persisted into
the early 1950'5. There had not
been time for the mood to
change much between the con
clusion of World War II and the
outbreak of hostilities in Korea.
And the early 1950's included

also the sinister and unforget
able episode of McCarthyism.
These years did not include
anything but the beginnings of
the Civil Rights movement begin
ings which were dramatized by
the spotlight on schools in Little
Rock, Arkansas. And, with all
due respect, the then President
of the United States did not
have the appeal to youth that
he had to older generations—
certainly not the appeal to
youth which emanated from
John Fitzgerald Kennedy. So
the students of the 1950's came
to be regarded as the "silent
generation," and perhaps under
standably so.
Thus, at different times and in
different contexts students have
asked the question: How best
can a student spend his under
graduate years?
Students In the 'AO's
What of the context in which
the students of the 1960's ask
this question? I have no expert
diagnosis, nor do I know of any,
that is unassailable. Nor do I
know of any generalization
which applies precisely to any
individual student. But let me
invite your consideration of a
few observations.
1. Not one of today's students
has personally experienced a
major depression or its conse
quences.
2. Very few of today's stu
dents have had direct experience
in war. And none has had ex
perience in a war, such as World
War 11, in which the motivation
to serve was so broadly and na
tionally based. The war they
know is undeclared and far
away; it implements a national
policy which they and others
question and is administered by
a government which does not
command their full confidence.
3. The student generation of
the late 1950's and the 1960's is
the first to live under the threat
of nuclear war. I cannot mea
sure the impact of that threat,
but I should judge from conver
sations with many students that
many of you are affected by it.
Greater Pressure
4. Today's students have been
subjected to greater pressures
than their predecessors for get
ting into the college of their
choice—pressures which derive
in part from the great increase
in national enrollment. They
have felt these pressures since
age 14 or 15, and find, in col
lege, that these pressures con
tinue for those who, in increas
ing numbers, plan to go on to
graduate and professional
schools.
5. Partly because our society
is affluent and partly because a
burst of new knowledge has in
vited greater specialization, to
today's students, unlike those of
the 1930'5, are confronted with
multiple choice of opportunity.
In the opinion of one observer,
the very richness and diversity
of opportunity produce a sense
of insecurity. What choice
should the student make? What
if the choice is wrong?
6. I mentioned a moment ago
the appeal which President Ken
nedy had for youth. For many
students, their response to this
appeal may be seen in their
participation in the Peace Corps,
in the Civil Rights movement
and in other less publicized en
terprizes by which they seek to
help the underprivileged. Such
participation is for them the
deed and not merely the word
of idealism.
Time For Idealism
Youth is peculiarly the time
for idealism and not infrequent
ly in this generation or others
this idealism is coupled with re
jectlon. The degree and depth
of this rejection are always
hard, if not impossible, to mea
sure. Today some students seem
to reject specialization—they
want to be the Renaissance and
some, presumably hope for a
part, and perhaps this number
is greater, reject the value-sys
tem of their parents and puzzle
themselves as to why this par
ticular rejection is not better
understood. Hence the so-called
generation-gap and, I suppose,
a part of the credibility gap.
There is, for some, rejection of
what they regard as slavishness
to conformity—conformity in
dress, in conventional manners,
and in such things as the am
bition to have a house in the
suburbs, a two-car family and
a colored televsiion within easy
reach.
I dare say that these observa
tions do not embrace the whole
context out of which today's
students ask the question, "How
best can I spend my undergrad
uate years?" But I suggest that
they are significant parts of the
whole, The context in which the
question is asked varies with
time and circumstance, but the
question itself is a hardy per
ennial.
Partial Answer
Part of the answer lies within
cach of you. You know better
than anyone else why you came

to college. I take it that you
wanted to do so, that few, if
any, of you came against your
will and only in response to
some parental or other pres
sure. And you should know bet
ter than anyone else why you
wanted to come. I should as
sume that the basic reason was,
of course, to continue your edu
cation. The opportunity to do so
in a new environment away
from home was probably not
unappealing to you. The pros
pect of enjoying a kind of new
freedom had its attractions as
well as anxieties. Many, if not
most, of you thought of college
as a natural, even necessary,
next step in preparation for a
career. I doubt that you thought
of college and a baccalaureate
degree simply as a status sym
bol. How consciously you looked
forward to college as an experi
ence in self development I don't
know, but it was probably some
where in your stream of con
sciousness. In any event, you
should know better than any
one else why you wanted to
come to college.
How aware were you when
you came that knowledge is the
most powerful of all human re
sources, that there is more
knowledge today than ever be
fore, and that its rate of accum
ulation continues to accelerate.
Since knowledge is the most im
portant commodity a college or

university has to offer, it fol
lows that a student's major op
portunity is to absorb and col
late as much of it as possible so
that he may harness and hitch
it and put it to work. . .
Commitment
There is a word in our vocabu
lary which I hear many of you
use with considerable frequency.
It is the word "commitment."
As I hear you use the word, it
is most frequently associated
with a sense of urgency to im
prove society, including the Uni
versity. I delight in this, even
though my delight is sometimes
punctuated with problems. I de
light in it because it bespeaks
a concern about the welfare of
mankind and a desire to be of
service I know of no commit
ment which can result in better
self development or in greater
service to mankind than a com
mitment to learn, a commitment
to knowledge. And this is the
prime commitment which I
would urge you to make. The
basic purpose of the educational
review now under way, in which
important contributions are ex
pected from you, is to discover
better ways and opportunities
to acquire knowledge and to put
knowledge to work so that bet
ter ways may be found to solve
problems great and small which
beset society.
The whole purpose of knowl
edge is to liberate—to liberate

from ignorance, from perjudice,
and from obsolence. There is
much knowledge to be discov
ered; this, too, is a mission of
the university—and probably its
most exciting mission.
Two Observations
Let me conclude with two ob
servations and questions.
First: As you spend your un
dergraduate years, acquiring
knowledge in the classrooms, in
the library and laboratory, in
discussions among yourselves
and with others, by participat
ing in a variety of activities, in
seeking, as we all do, to discover
and refine a set of values by
which each of us can live a
happy and helpful life, please
ponder this question: What
value a criticism, a conviction
or a principle which is not based
on knowledge?
Second: The vital statistics of
this nation indicate that in a few
years half of our population will
be less than 30 years of age.
This prospect should be very en
couraging for those of you who
accept the cliche that no one
over thirty can be trusted. But
not for long after those under
30 will have constituted a ma
jority, you will join the minor
ity. Will you then be knowledge
able enough to be trustworthy?
I believe that you will, and
that knowledge and trustworthi
ness will mean much to Stan
ford tomorrow, as it does today.
(Editor's Note: The following
are excerpts from President Ster
ling's convocation address, de
livered yesterday In Memorial
Auditorium. The annual winter
convocation is sponsored by
Stanford Today and Tomorrow.)
Mr. Chairman, Ladies and
Gentlemen:
Once again I would extend my
compliments, my thanks and my
best wishes to the Stanford To
day and Tomorrow Committee.
The students with whom I first
discussed the possibility of an
S.T.&T. program more than a
decade ago thought that such a
program might serve a useful
purpose. I hope that it still does.
The major problems confront
ing universities do not change
radically from year to year. Ma
jor problems have a way of
persisting, even among shifts
of emphasis. But the spirit and
willingness to consider change
should always exist. Last year at
this Convocation I pointed out
that the university as an institu
tion has been going through a
period of critical review during
the past decade and more, and
that the range and intensity of
this review during the past
decade and more, and that the
range and intensity of this re
view have increase in recent
years. This review is by no
means confined to the United
States. It is happening in na
tions, new and old, around the
world. . . .
It is not surprising that under
the pressure of larger enroll
ments universities have grown
both in number and in size, and
that educational budgets have
Increased. Nor is it surprising
that participation in the solution
of social problems has both
stimulated and obliged univer
sities to re-examine curricula.
Still in the context of univer
sity, it is important to note that
education throughout the world
gets its major financial support
from public funds —in most coun
tries almost entirely so. In only
a few countries, such as Japan,
the Philippines and the United
States, is the private sector of
higher education noteworthy,
and it is mainly in the United
States that institutions in the
private sector rival in strength
and distinction those in the pub
lic sector.
The financial dependence of
universities upon public funds
invariably raises the specter of
possible political influence — a
specter which has recently ap
peared on local horizons. Politi
cal influence can be exercised in
a variety of ways. It is a func
tion of government to determine
priorities among national needs,
and there is ample evidence, in
old countries and now, that the
allocation of public funds to edu
cation can be influenced by these
priorities.
Those who are zealous to pre
serve the educational indepen
dence and self-determination of
the university should be alert to
risks and dangers involved in
ever allowing the university, as
university, to become a political
instrument or a pawn in the
hands of those who would use
it as such, be those hands in
side or out the university. . . .
Prosperity And Interest
During the past two decades
the United States has been pros
perous, and its general public
has manifest greater interest in
education at all levels. Education
has benefited from both the pros
perity and the interest. . . .
Stanford, like so many of her
sister institutions, has been in
many ways the beneficiary of
this support and interest. In con
sequence, there has been change.
Since 1950, the student body has
increased in size by approxi

mately 40 per cent; the regular
faculty by 170 per cent. The an
nual fiscal operation of the Uni
versity, exclusive of improve
ments and additions to physical
plant, has increased by a factor
of 10. The building program has
not kept pace with increase in
enrollment and faculty. There is
less academic space per student
today than there was 15 years
ago, although substantial gains
have been made during the past
three years and more are in
early prospect.
The University's endownment
has increased more than four
fold, yet the income from it pays
for a smaller fraction of an
nual operating costs than it did
in 1950. Tuition has increased
from $600 in 1950, but it too pays
a smaller fraction of operating
costs today than it did then. The
University currently depends on
gifts and grants to support
about 30 per cent of its annual
operating expenditures, and to
pay for new buildings and the
rehabilitation of old ones. And
given the understandable fact
that donors have their own pref
erences as to the use of their
gifts, it follows that their pref
erences do not always coincide
with what the University regards
as its most urgent needs. In
other words, the University's
priorities of need may be modi
fied by the designation of gifts.
Two Problems
Manifestly, the University has
to address itself to problems
growing out of this siuation. Let
me mention two. One of these
problems — one which I men
tioned last year—is that of size.
It is clear that, despite the gains
recently made, we still need
more academic space adequately
to accommodate our present
faculty afid student body. And
it would be my hope that we
could continue to make gains as
a high priority in the faculty
student ratio, thereby adding fur
ther flexibility and strength to
teaching and research. There is
pressing need to add to library
resources and, as tuition in
creases, to amplify student fi
nancial aid. If these needs are to
be met out of available and
anticipated resources, with the
objective of improvinb academic
quality, serious consideration
must be given to the size of the
student body, not least of all at
the graduate level.
Another problem, not unre
lated to size, is that of the resi
dence university. Stanford be
gan as essentially a residence
university, and the aspiration
to continue as such is woven into
a large part of its history. But
increase in student numbers, ad
ditional mobility provided by the
automobile, and the capital cost
of new residence halls have com
bined to produce a situation in
which Stanford is less a resi
dence university than it used to
be, and to raise the question as
to whether the aspiration to be
a residence university is viable.
I would also recall from the not
so-distant past the study of un
dergraduate education at Stan
ford which was made a decade
ago. That study was directed
mainly to the possibility and de
sirability of curricular change.
It resulted, among other things,
in the General Studies program;
it also led to the development of
the overseas campuses for un
dergraduates. It is during the de
cade since that study was made
that Stanford has experienced
its major increase in enrollment,
particularly at the graduate
level, and has approximately
doubled the size of its faculty.
It is also during that dec&de that
the academic potential of the
student body has notably in
creased.

So, as I think you know, an
other study is now under way.
Last autumn a small planning
committee, including the presi
dent of the study body and an
other student, recommended that
the new study be as compre
hensive as possible; that it in
clude consideration of both grad
uate and undergraduate educa
tion, both curricular and extra
curricular programs; and that it
search out opportunities for in
novation, flexibility and im
provement.
Another Study
An executive committee of
seven or eight persons will be
in charge of the study. Professor
Herbert Packer, recently ap
pointed Vice-Provost for Aca
demic Planning and Programs,
is Chairman of the committee.
The committee will utilize a va
riety of task forces or ad hoc
committees as needed, so that
many faculty, students and of
ficers of the University will be
involved.
It is anticipated that the study
will extend through most if not
all of the next academic year,
but this does not mean that the
Committee will recommend no
thing until the study is com
pleted; rather it is intended that
recommendations will flow from
the Committee throughout the
course of the study. For instance,
priority attention will be given
to the concept of the residence
university and the problsm
therein entailed, including the
"Off" issue, the value of such
projects as Grove House, the
roles of Tutors, Sponsors and
.Resident Associates. It is to be
expected, therefore, that during
the next eighteen months or so
this University community will
be broadly and actively engaged
in this new study and in con
sidertion of the recommenda
tions which it produces. And I
dare say that one of the major
eventual considerations will be
this: How can educational re
view and improvement be, so to
speak, institutionalized and
thereby eliminate periodic and,
in Professor Parker's phrase,
"somewhat convulsive" attacks
on the problem.
University Government
If this is to be achieved, at
tention must be directed to Uni
versity government. This subject
needs attention for other reasons
as well, including that of size.
I have been interested to note
in the professional journals on
higher education that this sub
ject of university government
has had increasing attention dur
ing the past three or four years.
This has come about, as I read
the journals, in part because of
size—as student enrollments and
faculty have increased in num
ber—and in part because the
need for educational review and
'change calls for mechanisms
which will make possible knowl
edgeable discussion and delibera
tion of educational programs in
terms of the resources available
to support them.
University government stems
from the Charter, the legisaltive
statute or the constitutional pro
vision by which a given institu
tion was established. These char
ters or statutes vest authority
and responsibility in Boards of
Trustees, Regents or Governors.
From these Boards, subordinate
authority and responsibilities are
delegate to faculty, students and
officers of the institution. This is
the established pattern and I do
not anticipate that there will be
basic change in it at least at an
early date.
New Mechanisms
But it is not of this pattern
which I speak when I suggest
the need for new mechanisms,
because there is opportunity for

new mechanisms within the pat
tern. For instance, the Board of
Trustees of this University has
a Committee of its membership
presently engaged in a study of
the Board's composition and or
ganization. The objective is to
make more effective use of the
very considerable time which
Trustees devote to Stanford af
fairs, and thereby to keep them
still more closely in touch with
the academic programs and
needs of the University.
As Trustee organization is be
ing considered, so too might the
organization of the faculty and
of the student body benefit from
re-examination. Given the size
of the faculty and of the student
body respectively, it is unlikely
that the total membership of
each can be effectively and reg
ularly engaged in deliberations
on educational pr ogram and pol
icy.
For the faculty, this invites
the possibility of electing a rep
resentative body small enough
for constructive discussion and
large enough to give adequate
voice to the seven Schools. For
the students, it invites consider
ation of the reorganization of
student government if the pres
ent organization is judged to be
lacking in representation or per
formance. For all segments of
the University, it invites critical
attention to the invention of
mechanisms which will improve
collaborative effort to advance
the University by orderly pro
cedures.
It would seem to me that the
educational review now under
way would be incomplete if it
did not direct attention to the
subject of university govern
ment.
Suggestions
Before each of these Convo
cations I have asked students
to suggest topics which I might
discuss. The suggestion which
heads the list this year is this:
How can a student best spend
his undergraduate years?"
This question is by no means
new. I suspect that teachers and
counsellors have been hearing
that question for generations. I
suspect also that answers vary
from generation to generation,
and that they vary also within
any student generation as each
student seeks counsel for him
self and his individual concerns.
In the depressed 1930'5, for in
stance, at the surface of concern
for most students was how to
muster the financial where
withal to stay in school, and
the question of whether they
could get a job upon graduation.
They had some preoccupation
with economic security. Their
interest in public affairs was, as
I recall, directed to two main
considerations: One related di
rectly to the depression and led
to the question whether democ
racy could cope with the ten
sions, the dislocations and the
despair which the depression
produced, or whether some
other form of government could
cope more adequately with such
problems. . . .
The G.l.'s
Before the 1930's had passed
into history, much of the world
was at war. When it was over,
tens of thousands of Gl's re
sumed their education. They
had lost time. They were pre
occupied with catching up. They
were good students, eager to
learn, eager to complete college
and to begin a career and a fam
ily. This mood persisted into
the early 1950'5. There had not
been time for the mood to
change much between the con
clusion of World War II and the
outbreak of hostilities in Korea.
And the early 1950's included

also the sinister and unforget
able episode of McCarthyism.
These years did not include
anything but the beginnings of
the Civil Rights movement begin
ings which were dramatized by
the spotlight on schools in Little
Rock, Arkansas. And, with all
due respect, the then President
of the United States did not
have the appeal to youth that
he had to older generations—
certainly not the appeal to
youth which emanated from
John Fitzgerald Kennedy. So
the students of the 1950's came
to be regarded as the "silent

standably so.
Thus, at different times and in
different contexts students have
asked the question: How best
can a student spend his under
graduate years?
Students In the 'AO's
What of the context in which
the students of the 1960's ask
this question? I have no expert
diagnosis, nor do I know of any,
that is unassailable. Nor do I
know of any generalization
which applies precisely to any
individual student. But let me
invite your consideration of a
few observations.
1. Not one of today's students
has personally experienced a
major depression or its conse
quences.
2. Very few of today's stu
dents have had direct experience
in war. And none has had ex
perience in a war, such as World
War 11, in which the motivation
to serve was so broadly and na
tionally based. The war they
know is undeclared and far
away; it implements a national

question and is administered by
a government which does not
command their full confidence.
3. The student generation of
the late 1950's and the 1960's is
the first to live under the threat
of nuclear war. I cannot mea
sure the impact of that threat,
but I should judge from conver
sations with many students that
many of you are affected by it.
Greater Pressure
4. Today's students have been
subjected to greater pressures
than their predecessors for get
ting into the college of their
choice—pressures which derive
in part from the great increase
in national enrollment. They
have felt these pressures since
age 14 or 15, and find, in col
lege, that these pressures con
tinue for those who, in increas
ing numbers, plan to go on to
graduate and professional
schools.
5. Partly because our society
is affluent and partly because a
burst of new knowledge has in
vited greater specialization, to
today's students, unlike those of
the 1930'5, are confronted with
multiple choice of opportunity.
In the opinion of one observer,
the very richness and diversity
of opportunity produce a sense
of insecurity. What choice
should the student make? What
if the choice is wrong?
6. I mentioned a moment ago
the appeal which President Ken
nedy had for youth. For many
students, their response to this
appeal may be seen in their
participation in the Peace Corps,
in the Civil Rights movement
and in other less publicized en
terprizes by which they seek to
help the underprivileged. Such
participation is for them the
deed and not merely the word
of idealism.
Time For Idealism
Youth is peculiarly the time
for idealism and not infrequent
ly in this generation or others
this idealism is coupled with re
jectlon. The degree and depth
of this rejection are always
hard, if not impossible, to mea
sure. Today some students seem
to reject specialization—they
want to be the Renaissance and
some, presumably hope for a
part, and perhaps this number
is greater, reject the value-sys
tem of their parents and puzzle
themselves as to why this par
ticular rejection is not better
understood. Hence the so-called
generation-gap and, I suppose,
a part of the credibility gap.
There is, for some, rejection of
what they regard as slavishness
to conformity—conformity in
dress, in conventional manners,
and in such things as the am
bition to have a house in the
suburbs, a two-car family and
a colored televsiion within easy
reach.
I dare say that these observa
tions do not embrace the whole
context out of which today's
students ask the question, "How
best can I spend my undergrad
uate years?" But I suggest that
they are significant parts of the
whole, The context in which the
question is asked varies with
time and circumstance, but the
question itself is a hardy per
ennial.
Partial Answer
Part of the answer lies within
cach of you. You know better
than anyone else why you came

to college. I take it that you
wanted to do so, that few, if
any, of you came against your
will and only in response to
some parental or other pres
sure. And you should know bet
ter than anyone else why you
wanted to come. I should as
sume that the basic reason was,
of course, to continue your edu
cation. The opportunity to do so
in a new environment away
from home was probably not
unappealing to you. The pros
pect of enjoying a kind of new
freedom had its attractions as
well as anxieties. Many, if not
most, of you thought of college
as a natural, even necessary,
next step in preparation for a
career. I doubt that you thought
of college and a baccalaureate
degree simply as a status sym
bol. How consciously you looked
forward to college as an experi
ence in self development I don't
know, but it was probably some
where in your stream of con
sciousness. In any event, you
should know better than any
one else why you wanted to
come to college.
How aware were you when
you came that knowledge is the
most powerful of all human re
sources, that there is more
knowledge today than ever be
fore, and that its rate of accum
ulation continues to accelerate.
Since knowledge is the most im
portant commodity a college or

university has to offer, it fol
lows that a student's major op
portunity is to absorb and col
late as much of it as possible so
that he may harness and hitch
it and put it to work. . .
Commitment
There is a word in our vocabu
lary which I hear many of you
use with considerable frequency.
It is the word "commitment."
As I hear you use the word, it
is most frequently associated
with a sense of urgency to im
prove society, including the Uni
versity. I delight in this, even
though my delight is sometimes
punctuated with problems. I de
light in it because it bespeaks
a concern about the welfare of
mankind and a desire to be of
service I know of no commit
ment which can result in better
self development or in greater
service to mankind than a com
mitment to learn, a commitment
to knowledge. And this is the
prime commitment which I
would urge you to make. The
basic purpose of the educational
review now under way, in which
important contributions are ex
pected from you, is to discover
better ways and opportunities
to acquire knowledge and to put
knowledge to work so that bet
ter ways may be found to solve
problems great and small which
beset society.
The whole purpose of knowl
edge is to liberate—to liberate

from ignorance, from perjudice,
and from obsolence. There is
much knowledge to be discov
ered; this, too, is a mission of
the university—and probably its
most exciting mission.
Two Observations
Let me conclude with two ob
servations and questions.
First: As you spend your un
dergraduate years, acquiring
knowledge in the classrooms, in
the library and laboratory, in
discussions among yourselves
and with others, by participat
ing in a variety of activities, in
seeking, as we all do, to discover
and refine a set of values by
which each of us can live a
happy and helpful life, please
ponder this question: What
value a criticism, a conviction
or a principle which is not based
on knowledge?
Second: The vital statistics of
this nation indicate that in a few
years half of our population will
be less than 30 years of age.
This prospect should be very en
couraging for those of you who
accept the cliche that no one
over thirty can be trusted. But
not for long after those under
30 will have constituted a ma
jority, you will join the minor
ity. Will you then be knowledge
able enough to be trustworthy?
I believe that you will, and
that knowledge and trustworthi
ness will mean much to Stan
ford tomorrow, as it does today.
(Editor's Note: The following
are excerpts from President Ster
ling's convocation address, de
livered yesterday In Memorial
Auditorium. The annual winter
convocation is sponsored by
Stanford Today and Tomorrow.)
Mr. Chairman, Ladies and
Gentlemen:
Once again I would extend my
compliments, my thanks and my
best wishes to the Stanford To
day and Tomorrow Committee.
The students with whom I first
discussed the possibility of an
S.T.&T. program more than a
decade ago thought that such a
program might serve a useful
purpose. I hope that it still does.
The major problems confront
ing universities do not change
radically from year to year. Ma
jor problems have a way of
persisting, even among shifts
of emphasis. But the spirit and
willingness to consider change
should always exist. Last year at
this Convocation I pointed out
that the university as an institu
tion has been going through a
period of critical review during
the past decade and more, and
that the range and intensity of
this review during the past
decade and more, and that the
range and intensity of this re
view have increase in recent
years. This review is by no
means confined to the United
States. It is happening in na
tions, new and old, around the
world. . . .
It is not surprising that under
the pressure of larger enroll
ments universities have grown
both in number and in size, and
that educational budgets have
Increased. Nor is it surprising
that participation in the solution
of social problems has both
stimulated and obliged univer
sities to re-examine curricula.
Still in the context of univer
sity, it is important to note that
education throughout the world
gets its major financial support
from public funds —in most coun
tries almost entirely so. In only
a few countries, such as Japan,
the Philippines and the United
States, is the private sector of
higher education noteworthy,
and it is mainly in the United
States that institutions in the
private sector rival in strength
and distinction those in the pub
lic sector.
The financial dependence of
universities upon public funds
invariably raises the specter of
possible political influence — a
specter which has recently ap
peared on local horizons. Politi
cal influence can be exercised in
a variety of ways. It is a func
tion of government to determine
priorities among national needs,
and there is ample evidence, in
old countries and now, that the
allocation of public funds to edu
cation can be influenced by these
priorities.
Those who are zealous to pre
serve the educational indepen
dence and self-determination of
the university should be alert to
risks and dangers involved in
ever allowing the university, as
university, to become a political
instrument or a pawn in the
hands of those who would use
it as such, be those hands in
side or out the university. . . .
Prosperity And Interest
During the past two decades
the United States has been pros
perous, and its general public
has manifest greater interest in
education at all levels. Education
has benefited from both the pros
perity and the interest. . . .
Stanford, like so many of her
sister institutions, has been in
many ways the beneficiary of
this support and interest. In con
sequence, there has been change.
Since 1950, the student body has
increased in size by approxi

mately 40 per cent; the regular
faculty by 170 per cent. The an
nual fiscal operation of the Uni
versity, exclusive of improve
ments and additions to physical
plant, has increased by a factor
of 10. The building program has
not kept pace with increase in
enrollment and faculty. There is
less academic space per student
today than there was 15 years
ago, although substantial gains
have been made during the past
three years and more are in
early prospect.
The University's endownment
has increased more than four
fold, yet the income from it pays
for a smaller fraction of an
nual operating costs than it did
in 1950. Tuition has increased
from $600 in 1950, but it too pays
a smaller fraction of operating
costs today than it did then. The
University currently depends on
gifts and grants to support
about 30 per cent of its annual
operating expenditures, and to
pay for new buildings and the
rehabilitation of old ones. And
given the understandable fact
that donors have their own pref
erences as to the use of their
gifts, it follows that their pref
erences do not always coincide
with what the University regards
as its most urgent needs. In
other words, the University's
priorities of need may be modi
fied by the designation of gifts.
Two Problems
Manifestly, the University has
to address itself to problems
growing out of this siuation. Let
me mention two. One of these
problems — one which I men
tioned last year—is that of size.
It is clear that, despite the gains
recently made, we still need
more academic space adequately
to accommodate our present
faculty afid student body. And
it would be my hope that we
could continue to make gains as
a high priority in the faculty
student ratio, thereby adding fur
ther flexibility and strength to
teaching and research. There is
pressing need to add to library
resources and, as tuition in
creases, to amplify student fi
nancial aid. If these needs are to
be met out of available and
anticipated resources, with the
objective of improvinb academic
quality, serious consideration
must be given to the size of the
student body, not least of all at
the graduate level.
Another problem, not unre
lated to size, is that of the resi
dence university. Stanford be
gan as essentially a residence
university, and the aspiration
to continue as such is woven into
a large part of its history. But
increase in student numbers, ad
ditional mobility provided by the
automobile, and the capital cost
of new residence halls have com
bined to produce a situation in
which Stanford is less a resi
dence university than it used to
be, and to raise the question as
to whether the aspiration to be
a residence university is viable.
I would also recall from the not
so-distant past the study of un
dergraduate education at Stan
ford which was made a decade
ago. That study was directed
mainly to the possibility and de
sirability of curricular change.
It resulted, among other things,
in the General Studies program;
it also led to the development of
the overseas campuses for un
dergraduates. It is during the de
cade since that study was made
that Stanford has experienced
its major increase in enrollment,
particularly at the graduate
level, and has approximately
doubled the size of its faculty.
It is also during that dec&de that
the academic potential of the
student body has notably in
creased.

So, as I think you know, an
other study is now under way.
Last autumn a small planning
committee, including the presi
dent of the study body and an
other student, recommended that
the new study be as compre
hensive as possible; that it in
clude consideration of both grad
uate and undergraduate educa
tion, both curricular and extra
curricular programs; and that it
search out opportunities for in
novation, flexibility and im
provement.
Another Study
An executive committee of
seven or eight persons will be
in charge of the study. Professor
Herbert Packer, recently ap
pointed Vice-Provost for Aca
demic Planning and Programs,
is Chairman of the committee.
The committee will utilize a va
riety of task forces or ad hoc
committees as needed, so that
many faculty, students and of
ficers of the University will be
involved.
It is anticipated that the study
will extend through most if not
all of the next academic year,
but this does not mean that the
Committee will recommend no
thing until the study is com
pleted; rather it is intended that
recommendations will flow from
the Committee throughout the
course of the study. For instance,
priority attention will be given
to the concept of the residence
university and the problsm
therein entailed, including the
"Off" issue, the value of such
projects as Grove House, the
roles of Tutors, Sponsors and
.Resident Associates. It is to be
expected, therefore, that during
the next eighteen months or so
this University community will
be broadly and actively engaged
in this new study and in con
sidertion of the recommenda
tions which it produces. And I
dare say that one of the major
eventual considerations will be
this: How can educational re
view and improvement be, so to
speak, institutionalized and
thereby eliminate periodic and,
in Professor Parker's phrase,
"somewhat convulsive" attacks
on the problem.
University Government
If this is to be achieved, at
tention must be directed to Uni
versity government. This subject
needs attention for other reasons
as well, including that of size.
I have been interested to note
in the professional journals on
higher education that this sub
ject of university government
has had increasing attention dur
ing the past three or four years.
This has come about, as I read
the journals, in part because of
size—as student enrollments and
faculty have increased in num
ber—and in part because the
need for educational review and
'change calls for mechanisms
which will make possible knowl
edgeable discussion and delibera
tion of educational programs in
terms of the resources available
to support them.
University government stems
from the Charter, the legisaltive
statute or the constitutional pro
vision by which a given institu
tion was established. These char
ters or statutes vest authority
and responsibility in Boards of
Trustees, Regents or Governors.
From these Boards, subordinate
authority and responsibilities are
delegate to faculty, students and
officers of the institution. This is
the established pattern and I do
not anticipate that there will be
basic change in it at least at an
early date.
New Mechanisms
But it is not of this pattern
which I speak when I suggest
the need for new mechanisms,
because there is opportunity for

new mechanisms within the pat
tern. For instance, the Board of
Trustees of this University has
a Committee of its membership
presently engaged in a study of
the Board's composition and or
ganization. The objective is to
make more effective use of the
very considerable time which
Trustees devote to Stanford af
fairs, and thereby to keep them
still more closely in touch with
the academic programs and
needs of the University.
As Trustee organization is be
ing considered, so too might the
organization of the faculty and
of the student body benefit from
re-examination. Given the size
of the faculty and of the student
body respectively, it is unlikely
that the total membership of
each can be effectively and reg
ularly engaged in deliberations
on educational pr ogram and pol
icy.
For the faculty, this invites
the possibility of electing a rep
resentative body small enough
for constructive discussion and
large enough to give adequate
voice to the seven Schools. For
the students, it invites consider
ation of the reorganization of
student government if the pres
ent organization is judged to be
lacking in representation or per
formance. For all segments of
the University, it invites critical
attention to the invention of
mechanisms which will improve
collaborative effort to advance
the University by orderly pro
cedures.
It would seem to me that the
educational review now under
way would be incomplete if it
did not direct attention to the
subject of university govern
ment.
Suggestions
Before each of these Convo
cations I have asked students
to suggest topics which I might
discuss. The suggestion which
heads the list this year is this:
How can a student best spend
his undergraduate years?"
This question is by no means
new. I suspect that teachers and
counsellors have been hearing
that question for generations. I
suspect also that answers vary
from generation to generation,
and that they vary also within
any student generation as each
student seeks counsel for him
self and his individual concerns.
In the depressed 1930'5, for in
stance, at the surface of concern
for most students was how to
muster the financial where
withal to stay in school, and
the question of whether they
could get a job upon graduation.
They had some preoccupation
with economic security. Their
interest in public affairs was, as
I recall, directed to two main
considerations: One related di
rectly to the depression and led
to the question whether democ
racy could cope with the ten
sions, the dislocations and the
despair which the depression
produced, or whether some
other form of government could
cope more adequately with such
problems. . . .
The G.l.'s
Before the 1930's had passed
into history, much of the world
was at war. When it was over,
tens of thousands of Gl's re
sumed their education. They
had lost time. They were pre
occupied with catching up. They
were good students, eager to
learn, eager to complete college
and to begin a career and a fam
ily. This mood persisted into
the early 1950'5. There had not
been time for the mood to
change much between the con
clusion of World War II and the
outbreak of hostilities in Korea.
And the early 1950's included

also the sinister and unforget
able episode of McCarthyism.
These years did not include
anything but the beginnings of
the Civil Rights movement begin
ings which were dramatized by
the spotlight on schools in Little
Rock, Arkansas. And, with all
due respect, the then President
of the United States did not
have the appeal to youth that
he had to older generations—
certainly not the appeal to
youth which emanated from
John Fitzgerald Kennedy. So
the students of the 1950's came
to be regarded as the "silent
generation," and perhaps under
standably so.
Thus, at different times and in
different contexts students have
asked the question: How best
can a student spend his under
graduate years?
Students In the 'AO's
What of the context in which
the students of the 1960's ask
this question? I have no expert
diagnosis, nor do I know of any,
that is unassailable. Nor do I
know of any generalization
which applies precisely to any
individual student. But let me
invite your consideration of a
few observations.
1. Not one of today's students
has personally experienced a
major depression or its conse
quences.
2. Very few of today's stu
dents have had direct experience
in war. And none has had ex
perience in a war, such as World
War 11, in which the motivation
to serve was so broadly and na
tionally based. The war they
know is undeclared and far
away; it implements a national
policy which they and others
question and is administered by
a government which does not
command their full confidence.
3. The student generation of
the late 1950's and the 1960's is
the first to live under the threat
of nuclear war. I cannot mea
sure the impact of that threat,
but I should judge from conver
sations with many students that
many of you are affected by it.
Greater Pressure
4. Today's students have been
subjected to greater pressures
than their predecessors for get
ting into the college of their
choice—pressures which derive
in part from the great increase
in national enrollment. They
have felt these pressures since
age 14 or 15, and find, in col
lege, that these pressures con
tinue for those who, in increas
ing numbers, plan to go on to
graduate and professional
schools.
5. Partly because our society
is affluent and partly because a
burst of new knowledge has in
vited greater specialization, to
today's students, unlike those of
the 1930'5, are confronted with
multiple choice of opportunity.
In the opinion of one observer,
the very richness and diversity
of opportunity produce a sense
of insecurity. What choice
should the student make? What
if the choice is wrong?
6. I mentioned a moment ago
the appeal which President Ken
nedy had for youth. For many
students, their response to this
appeal may be seen in their
participation in the Peace Corps,
in the Civil Rights movement
and in other less publicized en
terprizes by which they seek to
help the underprivileged. Such
participation is for them the
deed and not merely the word
of idealism.
Time For Idealism
Youth is peculiarly the time
for idealism and not infrequent
ly in this generation or others
this idealism is coupled with re
jectlon. The degree and depth
of this rejection are always
hard, if not impossible, to mea
sure. Today some students seem
to reject specialization—they
want to be the Renaissance and
some, presumably hope for a
part, and perhaps this number
is greater, reject the value-sys
tem of their parents and puzzle
themselves as to why this par
ticular rejection is not better
understood. Hence the so-called
generation-gap and, I suppose,
a part of the credibility gap.
There is, for some, rejection of
what they regard as slavishness
to conformity—conformity in
dress, in conventional manners,
and in such things as the am
bition to have a house in the
suburbs, a two-car family and
a colored televsiion within easy
reach.
I dare say that these observa
tions do not embrace the whole
context out of which today's
students ask the question, "How
best can I spend my undergrad
uate years?" But I suggest that
they are significant parts of the
whole, The context in which the
question is asked varies with
time and circumstance, but the
question itself is a hardy per
ennial.

than anyone else why you came

The students with whom I first
discussed the possibility of an
S.T.&T. program more than a

purpose. I hope that it still does.
The major problems confront

It is not surprising that under

that educational budgets have

Prosperity And Interest
During the past two decades
the United States has been pros

Stanford, like so many of her

three years and more are in
early prospect.
The University's endownment
has increased more than four
fold, yet the income from it pays
for a smaller fraction of an
nual operating costs than it did
in 1950. Tuition has increased
from $600 in 1950, but it too pays
a smaller fraction of operating
costs today than it did then. The
University currently depends on
gifts and grants to support
about 30 per cent of its annual
operating expenditures, and to
pay for new buildings and the
rehabilitation of old ones. And
given the understandable fact
that donors have their own pref
erences as to the use of their
gifts, it follows that their pref
erences do not always coincide
with what the University regards
as its most urgent needs. In
other words, the University's
priorities of need may be modi
fied by the designation of gifts.
Two Problems
Manifestly, the University has
to address itself to problems
growing out of this siuation. Let
me mention two. One of these
problems — one which I men
tioned last year—is that of size.
It is clear that, despite the gains
recently made, we still need
more academic space adequately
to accommodate our present
faculty afid student body. And
it would be my hope that we
could continue to make gains as
a high priority in the faculty
student ratio, thereby adding fur
ther flexibility and strength to
teaching and research. There is
pressing need to add to library
resources and, as tuition in
creases, to amplify student fi
nancial aid. If these needs are to
be met out of available and
anticipated resources, with the
objective of improvinb academic
quality, serious consideration
must be given to the size of the
student body, not least of all at
the graduate level.
Another problem, not unre
lated to size, is that of the resi
dence university. Stanford be
gan as essentially a residence
university, and the aspiration
to continue as such is woven into
a large part of its history. But
increase in student numbers, ad
ditional mobility provided by the
automobile, and the capital cost
of new residence halls have com
bined to produce a situation in
which Stanford is less a resi
dence university than it used to
be, and to raise the question as
to whether the aspiration to be
a residence university is viable.
I would also recall from the not
so-distant past the study of un
dergraduate education at Stan
ford which was made a decade
ago. That study was directed
mainly to the possibility and de
sirability of curricular change.
It resulted, among other things,
in the General Studies program;
it also led to the development of
the overseas campuses for un
dergraduates. It is during the de
cade since that study was made
that Stanford has experienced
its major increase in enrollment,
particularly at the graduate
level, and has approximately
doubled the size of its faculty.
It is also during that dec&de that
the academic potential of the
student body has notably in
creased.

So, as I think you know, an
other study is now under way.
Last autumn a small planning
committee, including the presi
dent of the study body and an
other student, recommended that
the new study be as compre
hensive as possible; that it in
clude consideration of both grad
uate and undergraduate educa
tion, both curricular and extra
curricular programs; and that it
search out opportunities for in
novation, flexibility and im
provement.
Another Study
An executive committee of
seven or eight persons will be
in charge of the study. Professor
Herbert Packer, recently ap
pointed Vice-Provost for Aca
demic Planning and Programs,
is Chairman of the committee.
The committee will utilize a va
riety of task forces or ad hoc
committees as needed, so that
many faculty, students and of
ficers of the University will be
involved.
It is anticipated that the study
will extend through most if not
all of the next academic year,
but this does not mean that the
Committee will recommend no
thing until the study is com
pleted; rather it is intended that
recommendations will flow from
the Committee throughout the
course of the study. For instance,
priority attention will be given
to the concept of the residence
university and the problsm
therein entailed, including the
"Off" issue, the value of such
projects as Grove House, the
roles of Tutors, Sponsors and
.Resident Associates. It is to be
expected, therefore, that during
the next eighteen months or so
this University community will
be broadly and actively engaged
in this new study and in con
sidertion of the recommenda
tions which it produces. And I
dare say that one of the major
eventual considerations will be
this: How can educational re
view and improvement be, so to
speak, institutionalized and
thereby eliminate periodic and,
in Professor Parker's phrase,
"somewhat convulsive" attacks
on the problem.
University Government
If this is to be achieved, at
tention must be directed to Uni
versity government. This subject
needs attention for other reasons
as well, including that of size.
I have been interested to note
in the professional journals on
higher education that this sub
ject of university government
has had increasing attention dur
ing the past three or four years.
This has come about, as I read
the journals, in part because of
size—as student enrollments and
faculty have increased in num
ber—and in part because the
need for educational review and
'change calls for mechanisms
which will make possible knowl
edgeable discussion and delibera
tion of educational programs in
terms of the resources available
to support them.
University government stems
from the Charter, the legisaltive
statute or the constitutional pro
vision by which a given institu
tion was established. These char
ters or statutes vest authority
and responsibility in Boards of
Trustees, Regents or Governors.
From these Boards, subordinate
authority and responsibilities are
delegate to faculty, students and
officers of the institution. This is
the established pattern and I do
not anticipate that there will be
basic change in it at least at an
early date.
New Mechanisms
But it is not of this pattern
which I speak when I suggest
the need for new mechanisms,
because there is opportunity for

new mechanisms within the pat
tern. For instance, the Board of
Trustees of this University has
a Committee of its membership
presently engaged in a study of
the Board's composition and or
ganization. The objective is to
make more effective use of the
very considerable time which
Trustees devote to Stanford af
fairs, and thereby to keep them
still more closely in touch with
the academic programs and
needs of the University.
As Trustee organization is be
ing considered, so too might the
organization of the faculty and
of the student body benefit from
re-examination. Given the size
of the faculty and of the student
body respectively, it is unlikely
that the total membership of
each can be effectively and reg
ularly engaged in deliberations
on educational pr ogram and pol
icy.
For the faculty, this invites
the possibility of electing a rep
resentative body small enough
for constructive discussion and
large enough to give adequate
voice to the seven Schools. For
the students, it invites consider
ation of the reorganization of
student government if the pres
ent organization is judged to be
lacking in representation or per
formance. For all segments of
the University, it invites critical
attention to the invention of
mechanisms which will improve
collaborative effort to advance
the University by orderly pro
cedures.
It would seem to me that the
educational review now under
way would be incomplete if it
did not direct attention to the
subject of university govern
ment.
Suggestions
Before each of these Convo
cations I have asked students
to suggest topics which I might
discuss. The suggestion which
heads the list this year is this:
How can a student best spend
his undergraduate years?"
This question is by no means
new. I suspect that teachers and
counsellors have been hearing
that question for generations. I
suspect also that answers vary
from generation to generation,
and that they vary also within
any student generation as each
student seeks counsel for him
self and his individual concerns.
In the depressed 1930'5, for in
stance, at the surface of concern
for most students was how to
muster the financial where
withal to stay in school, and
the question of whether they
could get a job upon graduation.
They had some preoccupation
with economic security. Their
interest in public affairs was, as
I recall, directed to two main
considerations: One related di
rectly to the depression and led
to the question whether democ
racy could cope with the ten
sions, the dislocations and the
despair which the depression
produced, or whether some
other form of government could
cope more adequately with such
problems. . . .
The G.l.'s
Before the 1930's had passed
into history, much of the world
was at war. When it was over,
tens of thousands of Gl's re
sumed their education. They
had lost time. They were pre
occupied with catching up. They
were good students, eager to
learn, eager to complete college
and to begin a career and a fam
ily. This mood persisted into
the early 1950'5. There had not
been time for the mood to
change much between the con
clusion of World War II and the
outbreak of hostilities in Korea.
And the early 1950's included

also the sinister and unforget
able episode of McCarthyism.
These years did not include
anything but the beginnings of
the Civil Rights movement begin
ings which were dramatized by
the spotlight on schools in Little
Rock, Arkansas. And, with all
due respect, the then President
of the United States did not
have the appeal to youth that
he had to older generations—
certainly not the appeal to
youth which emanated from
John Fitzgerald Kennedy. So
the students of the 1950's came
to be regarded as the "silent
generation," and perhaps under
standably so.
Thus, at different times and in
different contexts students have
asked the question: How best
can a student spend his under
graduate years?
Students In the 'AO's
What of the context in which
the students of the 1960's ask
this question? I have no expert
diagnosis, nor do I know of any,
that is unassailable. Nor do I
know of any generalization
which applies precisely to any
individual student. But let me
invite your consideration of a
few observations.
1. Not one of today's students
has personally experienced a
major depression or its conse
quences.
2. Very few of today's stu
dents have had direct experience
in war. And none has had ex
perience in a war, such as World
War 11, in which the motivation
to serve was so broadly and na
tionally based. The war they
know is undeclared and far
away; it implements a national
policy which they and others
question and is administered by
a government which does not
command their full confidence.
3. The student generation of
the late 1950's and the 1960's is
the first to live under the threat
of nuclear war. I cannot mea
sure the impact of that threat,
but I should judge from conver
sations with many students that
many of you are affected by it.
Greater Pressure
4. Today's students have been
subjected to greater pressures
than their predecessors for get
ting into the college of their
choice—pressures which derive
in part from the great increase
in national enrollment. They
have felt these pressures since
age 14 or 15, and find, in col
lege, that these pressures con
tinue for those who, in increas
ing numbers, plan to go on to
graduate and professional
schools.
5. Partly because our society
is affluent and partly because a
burst of new knowledge has in
vited greater specialization, to
today's students, unlike those of
the 1930'5, are confronted with
multiple choice of opportunity.
In the opinion of one observer,
the very richness and diversity
of opportunity produce a sense
of insecurity. What choice
should the student make? What
if the choice is wrong?
6. I mentioned a moment ago
the appeal which President Ken
nedy had for youth. For many
students, their response to this
appeal may be seen in their
participation in the Peace Corps,
in the Civil Rights movement
and in other less publicized en
terprizes by which they seek to
help the underprivileged. Such
participation is for them the
deed and not merely the word
of idealism.
Time For Idealism
Youth is peculiarly the time
for idealism and not infrequent
ly in this generation or others
this idealism is coupled with re
jectlon. The degree and depth
of this rejection are always
hard, if not impossible, to mea
sure. Today some students seem
to reject specialization—they
want to be the Renaissance and
some, presumably hope for a
part, and perhaps this number
is greater, reject the value-sys
tem of their parents and puzzle
themselves as to why this par
ticular rejection is not better
understood. Hence the so-called
generation-gap and, I suppose,
a part of the credibility gap.
There is, for some, rejection of
what they regard as slavishness
to conformity—conformity in
dress, in conventional manners,
and in such things as the am
bition to have a house in the
suburbs, a two-car family and
a colored televsiion within easy
reach.
I dare say that these observa
tions do not embrace the whole
context out of which today's
students ask the question, "How
best can I spend my undergrad
uate years?" But I suggest that
they are significant parts of the
whole, The context in which the
question is asked varies with
time and circumstance, but the
question itself is a hardy per
ennial.
Partial Answer
Part of the answer lies within
cach of you. You know better
than anyone else why you came

to college. I take it that you
wanted to do so, that few, if
any, of you came against your
will and only in response to
some parental or other pres
sure. And you should know bet
ter than anyone else why you
wanted to come. I should as
sume that the basic reason was,
of course, to continue your edu
cation. The opportunity to do so
in a new environment away
from home was probably not
unappealing to you. The pros
pect of enjoying a kind of new
freedom had its attractions as
well as anxieties. Many, if not
most, of you thought of college
as a natural, even necessary,
next step in preparation for a
career. I doubt that you thought
of college and a baccalaureate
degree simply as a status sym
bol. How consciously you looked
forward to college as an experi
ence in self development I don't
know, but it was probably some
where in your stream of con
sciousness. In any event, you
should know better than any
one else why you wanted to
come to college.
How aware were you when
you came that knowledge is the
most powerful of all human re
sources, that there is more
knowledge today than ever be
fore, and that its rate of accum
ulation continues to accelerate.
Since knowledge is the most im
portant commodity a college or

university has to offer, it fol
lows that a student's major op
portunity is to absorb and col
late as much of it as possible so
that he may harness and hitch
it and put it to work. . .
Commitment
There is a word in our vocabu
lary which I hear many of you
use with considerable frequency.
It is the word "commitment."
As I hear you use the word, it
is most frequently associated
with a sense of urgency to im
prove society, including the Uni
versity. I delight in this, even
though my delight is sometimes
punctuated with problems. I de
light in it because it bespeaks
a concern about the welfare of
mankind and a desire to be of
service I know of no commit
ment which can result in better
self development or in greater
service to mankind than a com
mitment to learn, a commitment
to knowledge. And this is the
prime commitment which I
would urge you to make. The
basic purpose of the educational
review now under way, in which
important contributions are ex
pected from you, is to discover
better ways and opportunities
to acquire knowledge and to put
knowledge to work so that bet
ter ways may be found to solve
problems great and small which
beset society.
The whole purpose of knowl
edge is to liberate—to liberate

from ignorance, from perjudice,
and from obsolence. There is
much knowledge to be discov
ered; this, too, is a mission of
the university—and probably its
most exciting mission.
Two Observations
Let me conclude with two ob
servations and questions.
First: As you spend your un
dergraduate years, acquiring
knowledge in the classrooms, in
the library and laboratory, in
discussions among yourselves
and with others, by participat
ing in a variety of activities, in
seeking, as we all do, to discover
and refine a set of values by
which each of us can live a
happy and helpful life, please
ponder this question: What
value a criticism, a conviction
or a principle which is not based
on knowledge?
Second: The vital statistics of
this nation indicate that in a few
years half of our population will
be less than 30 years of age.
This prospect should be very en
couraging for those of you who
accept the cliche that no one
over thirty can be trusted. But
not for long after those under
30 will have constituted a ma
jority, you will join the minor
ity. Will you then be knowledge
able enough to be trustworthy?
I believe that you will, and
that knowledge and trustworthi
ness will mean much to Stan
ford tomorrow, as it does today.
(Editor's Note: The following
are excerpts from President Ster
ling's convocation address, de
livered yesterday In Memorial
Auditorium. The annual winter
convocation is sponsored by
Stanford Today and Tomorrow.)
Mr. Chairman, Ladies and
Gentlemen:
Once again I would extend my
compliments, my thanks and my
best wishes to the Stanford To
day and Tomorrow Committee.
The students with whom I first
discussed the possibility of an
S.T.&T. program more than a
decade ago thought that such a
program might serve a useful
purpose. I hope that it still does.
The major problems confront
ing universities do not change
radically from year to year. Ma
jor problems have a way of
persisting, even among shifts
of emphasis. But the spirit and
willingness to consider change
should always exist. Last year at
this Convocation I pointed out
that the university as an institu
tion has been going through a
period of critical review during
the past decade and more, and
that the range and intensity of
this review during the past
decade and more, and that the
range and intensity of this re
view have increase in recent
years. This review is by no
means confined to the United
States. It is happening in na
tions, new and old, around the
world. . . .
It is not surprising that under
the pressure of larger enroll
ments universities have grown
both in number and in size, and
that educational budgets have
Increased. Nor is it surprising
that participation in the solution
of social problems has both
stimulated and obliged univer
sities to re-examine curricula.
Still in the context of univer
sity, it is important to note that
education throughout the world
gets its major financial support
from public funds —in most coun
tries almost entirely so. In only
a few countries, such as Japan,
the Philippines and the United
States, is the private sector of
higher education noteworthy,
and it is mainly in the United
States that institutions in the
private sector rival in strength
and distinction those in the pub
lic sector.
The financial dependence of
universities upon public funds
invariably raises the specter of
possible political influence — a
specter which has recently ap
peared on local horizons. Politi
cal influence can be exercised in
a variety of ways. It is a func
tion of government to determine
priorities among national needs,
and there is ample evidence, in
old countries and now, that the
allocation of public funds to edu
cation can be influenced by these
priorities.
Those who are zealous to pre
serve the educational indepen
dence and self-determination of
the university should be alert to
risks and dangers involved in
ever allowing the university, as
university, to become a political
instrument or a pawn in the
hands of those who would use
it as such, be those hands in
side or out the university. . . .
Prosperity And Interest
During the past two decades
the United States has been pros
perous, and its general public
has manifest greater interest in
education at all levels. Education
has benefited from both the pros
perity and the interest. . . .
Stanford, like so many of her
sister institutions, has been in
many ways the beneficiary of
this support and interest. In con
sequence, there has been change.
Since 1950, the student body has
increased in size by approxi

mately 40 per cent; the regular
faculty by 170 per cent. The an
nual fiscal operation of the Uni
versity, exclusive of improve
ments and additions to physical
plant, has increased by a factor
of 10. The building program has
not kept pace with increase in
enrollment and faculty. There is
less academic space per student
today than there was 15 years
ago, although substantial gains
have been made during the past
three years and more are in
early prospect.
The University's endownment
has increased more than four
fold, yet the income from it pays
for a smaller fraction of an
nual operating costs than it did
in 1950. Tuition has increased
from $600 in 1950, but it too pays
a smaller fraction of operating
costs today than it did then. The
University currently depends on
gifts and grants to support
about 30 per cent of its annual
operating expenditures, and to
pay for new buildings and the
rehabilitation of old ones. And
given the understandable fact
that donors have their own pref
erences as to the use of their
gifts, it follows that their pref
erences do not always coincide
with what the University regards
as its most urgent needs. In
other words, the University's
priorities of need may be modi
fied by the designation of gifts.
Two Problems
Manifestly, the University has
to address itself to problems
growing out of this siuation. Let
me mention two. One of these
problems — one which I men
tioned last year—is that of size.
It is clear that, despite the gains
recently made, we still need
more academic space adequately
to accommodate our present
faculty afid student body. And
it would be my hope that we
could continue to make gains as
a high priority in the faculty
student ratio, thereby adding fur
ther flexibility and strength to
teaching and research. There is
pressing need to add to library
resources and, as tuition in
creases, to amplify student fi
nancial aid. If these needs are to
be met out of available and
anticipated resources, with the
objective of improvinb academic
quality, serious consideration
must be given to the size of the
student body, not least of all at
the graduate level.
Another problem, not unre
lated to size, is that of the resi
dence university. Stanford be
gan as essentially a residence
university, and the aspiration
to continue as such is woven into
a large part of its history. But
increase in student numbers, ad
ditional mobility provided by the
automobile, and the capital cost
of new residence halls have com
bined to produce a situation in
which Stanford is less a resi
dence university than it used to
be, and to raise the question as
to whether the aspiration to be
a residence university is viable.
I would also recall from the not
so-distant past the study of un
dergraduate education at Stan
ford which was made a decade
ago. That study was directed
mainly to the possibility and de
sirability of curricular change.
It resulted, among other things,
in the General Studies program;
it also led to the development of
the overseas campuses for un
dergraduates. It is during the de
cade since that study was made
that Stanford has experienced
its major increase in enrollment,
particularly at the graduate
level, and has approximately
doubled the size of its faculty.
It is also during that dec&de that
the academic potential of the
student body has notably in
creased.

So, as I think you know, an
other study is now under way.
Last autumn a small planning
committee, including the presi
dent of the study body and an
other student, recommended that
the new study be as compre
hensive as possible; that it in
clude consideration of both grad
uate and undergraduate educa
tion, both curricular and extra
curricular programs; and that it
search out opportunities for in
novation, flexibility and im
provement.
Another Study
An executive committee of
seven or eight persons will be
in charge of the study. Professor
Herbert Packer, recently ap
pointed Vice-Provost for Aca
demic Planning and Programs,
is Chairman of the committee.
The committee will utilize a va
riety of task forces or ad hoc
committees as needed, so that
many faculty, students and of
ficers of the University will be
involved.
It is anticipated that the study
will extend through most if not
all of the next academic year,
but this does not mean that the
Committee will recommend no
thing until the study is com
pleted; rather it is intended that
recommendations will flow from
the Committee throughout the
course of the study. For instance,
priority attention will be given
to the concept of the residence
university and the problsm
therein entailed, including the
"Off" issue, the value of such
projects as Grove House, the
roles of Tutors, Sponsors and
.Resident Associates. It is to be
expected, therefore, that during
the next eighteen months or so
this University community will
be broadly and actively engaged
in this new study and in con
sidertion of the recommenda
tions which it produces. And I
dare say that one of the major
eventual considerations will be
this: How can educational re
view and improvement be, so to
speak, institutionalized and
thereby eliminate periodic and,
in Professor Parker's phrase,
"somewhat convulsive" attacks
on the problem.
University Government
If this is to be achieved, at
tention must be directed to Uni
versity government. This subject
needs attention for other reasons
as well, including that of size.
I have been interested to note
in the professional journals on
higher education that this sub
ject of university government
has had increasing attention dur
ing the past three or four years.
This has come about, as I read
the journals, in part because of
size—as student enrollments and
faculty have increased in num
ber—and in part because the
need for educational review and
'change calls for mechanisms
which will make possible knowl
edgeable discussion and delibera
tion of educational programs in
terms of the resources available
to support them.
University government stems
from the Charter, the legisaltive
statute or the constitutional pro
vision by which a given institu
tion was established. These char
ters or statutes vest authority
and responsibility in Boards of
Trustees, Regents or Governors.
From these Boards, subordinate
authority and responsibilities are
delegate to faculty, students and
officers of the institution. This is
the established pattern and I do
not anticipate that there will be
basic change in it at least at an
early date.
New Mechanisms
But it is not of this pattern
which I speak when I suggest
the need for new mechanisms,
because there is opportunity for

new mechanisms within the pat
tern. For instance, the Board of
Trustees of this University has
a Committee of its membership
presently engaged in a study of
the Board's composition and or
ganization. The objective is to
make more effective use of the
very considerable time which
Trustees devote to Stanford af
fairs, and thereby to keep them
still more closely in touch with
the academic programs and
needs of the University.
As Trustee organization is be
ing considered, so too might the
organization of the faculty and
of the student body benefit from
re-examination. Given the size
of the faculty and of the student
body respectively, it is unlikely
that the total membership of
each can be effectively and reg
ularly engaged in deliberations
on educational pr ogram and pol
icy.
For the faculty, this invites
the possibility of electing a rep
resentative body small enough
for constructive discussion and
large enough to give adequate
voice to the seven Schools. For
the students, it invites consider
ation of the reorganization of
student government if the pres
ent organization is judged to be
lacking in representation or per
formance. For all segments of
the University, it invites critical
attention to the invention of
mechanisms which will improve
collaborative effort to advance
the University by orderly pro
cedures.
It would seem to me that the
educational review now under
way would be incomplete if it
did not direct attention to the
subject of university govern
ment.
Suggestions
Before each of these Convo
cations I have asked students
to suggest topics which I might
discuss. The suggestion which
heads the list this year is this:
How can a student best spend
his undergraduate years?"
This question is by no means
new. I suspect that teachers and
counsellors have been hearing
that question for generations. I
suspect also that answers vary
from generation to generation,
and that they vary also within
any student generation as each
student seeks counsel for him
self and his individual concerns.
In the depressed 1930'5, for in
stance, at the surface of concern
for most students was how to
muster the financial where
withal to stay in school, and
the question of whether they
could get a job upon graduation.
They had some preoccupation
with economic security. Their
interest in public affairs was, as
I recall, directed to two main
considerations: One related di
rectly to the depression and led
to the question whether democ
racy could cope with the ten
sions, the dislocations and the
despair which the depression
produced, or whether some
other form of government could
cope more adequately with such
problems. . . .
The G.l.'s
Before the 1930's had passed
into history, much of the world
was at war. When it was over,
tens of thousands of Gl's re
sumed their education. They
had lost time. They were pre
occupied with catching up. They
were good students, eager to
learn, eager to complete college
and to begin a career and a fam
ily. This mood persisted into
the early 1950'5. There had not
been time for the mood to
change much between the con
clusion of World War II and the
outbreak of hostilities in Korea.
And the early 1950's included

also the sinister and unforget
able episode of McCarthyism.
These years did not include
anything but the beginnings of
the Civil Rights movement begin
ings which were dramatized by
the spotlight on schools in Little
Rock, Arkansas. And, with all
due respect, the then President
of the United States did not
have the appeal to youth that
he had to older generations—
certainly not the appeal to
youth which emanated from
John Fitzgerald Kennedy. So
the students of the 1950's came
to be regarded as the "silent
generation," and perhaps under
standably so.
Thus, at different times and in
different contexts students have
asked the question: How best
can a student spend his under
graduate years?
Students In the 'AO's
What of the context in which
the students of the 1960's ask
this question? I have no expert
diagnosis, nor do I know of any,
that is unassailable. Nor do I
know of any generalization
which applies precisely to any
individual student. But let me
invite your consideration of a
few observations.
1. Not one of today's students
has personally experienced a
major depression or its conse
quences.
2. Very few of today's stu
dents have had direct experience
in war. And none has had ex
perience in a war, such as World
War 11, in which the motivation
to serve was so broadly and na
tionally based. The war they
know is undeclared and far
away; it implements a national
policy which they and others
question and is administered by
a government which does not
command their full confidence.
3. The student generation of
the late 1950's and the 1960's is
the first to live under the threat
of nuclear war. I cannot mea
sure the impact of that threat,
but I should judge from conver
sations with many students that
many of you are affected by it.
Greater Pressure
4. Today's students have been
subjected to greater pressures
than their predecessors for get
ting into the college of their
choice—pressures which derive
in part from the great increase
in national enrollment. They
have felt these pressures since
age 14 or 15, and find, in col
lege, that these pressures con
tinue for those who, in increas
ing numbers, plan to go on to
graduate and professional
schools.
5. Partly because our society
is affluent and partly because a
burst of new knowledge has in
vited greater specialization, to
today's students, unlike those of
the 1930'5, are confronted with
multiple choice of opportunity.
In the opinion of one observer,
the very richness and diversity
of opportunity produce a sense
of insecurity. What choice
should the student make? What
if the choice is wrong?
6. I mentioned a moment ago
the appeal which President Ken
nedy had for youth. For many
students, their response to this
appeal may be seen in their
participation in the Peace Corps,
in the Civil Rights movement
and in other less publicized en
terprizes by which they seek to
help the underprivileged. Such
participation is for them the
deed and not merely the word
of idealism.
Time For Idealism
Youth is peculiarly the time
for idealism and not infrequent
ly in this generation or others
this idealism is coupled with re
jectlon. The degree and depth
of this rejection are always
hard, if not impossible, to mea
sure. Today some students seem
to reject specialization—they
want to be the Renaissance and
some, presumably hope for a
part, and perhaps this number
is greater, reject the value-sys
tem of their parents and puzzle
themselves as to why this par
ticular rejection is not better
understood. Hence the so-called
generation-gap and, I suppose,
a part of the credibility gap.
There is, for some, rejection of
what they regard as slavishness
to conformity—conformity in
dress, in conventional manners,
and in such things as the am
bition to have a house in the
suburbs, a two-car family and
a colored televsiion within easy
reach.
I dare say that these observa
tions do not embrace the whole
context out of which today's
students ask the question, "How
best can I spend my undergrad
uate years?" But I suggest that
they are significant parts of the
whole, The context in which the
question is asked varies with
time and circumstance, but the
question itself is a hardy per
ennial.
Partial Answer
Part of the answer lies within
cach of you. You know better
than anyone else why you came

to college. I take it that you
wanted to do so, that few, if
any, of you came against your
will and only in response to
some parental or other pres
sure. And you should know bet
ter than anyone else why you
wanted to come. I should as
sume that the basic reason was,
of course, to continue your edu
cation. The opportunity to do so
in a new environment away
from home was probably not
unappealing to you. The pros
pect of enjoying a kind of new
freedom had its attractions as
well as anxieties. Many, if not
most, of you thought of college
as a natural, even necessary,
next step in preparation for a
career. I doubt that you thought
of college and a baccalaureate
degree simply as a status sym
bol. How consciously you looked
forward to college as an experi
ence in self development I don't
know, but it was probably some
where in your stream of con
sciousness. In any event, you
should know better than any
one else why you wanted to
come to college.
How aware were you when
you came that knowledge is the
most powerful of all human re
sources, that there is more
knowledge today than ever be
fore, and that its rate of accum
ulation continues to accelerate.
Since knowledge is the most im
portant commodity a college or

university has to offer, it fol
lows that a student's major op
portunity is to absorb and col
late as much of it as possible so
that he may harness and hitch
it and put it to work. . .
Commitment
There is a word in our vocabu
lary which I hear many of you
use with considerable frequency.
It is the word "commitment."
As I hear you use the word, it
is most frequently associated
with a sense of urgency to im
prove society, including the Uni
versity. I delight in this, even
though my delight is sometimes
punctuated with problems. I de
light in it because it bespeaks
a concern about the welfare of
mankind and a desire to be of
service I know of no commit
ment which can result in better
self development or in greater
service to mankind than a com
mitment to learn, a commitment
to knowledge. And this is the
prime commitment which I
would urge you to make. The
basic purpose of the educational
review now under way, in which
important contributions are ex
pected from you, is to discover
better ways and opportunities
to acquire knowledge and to put
knowledge to work so that bet
ter ways may be found to solve
problems great and small which
beset society.
The whole purpose of knowl
edge is to liberate—to liberate

from ignorance, from perjudice,
and from obsolence. There is
much knowledge to be discov
ered; this, too, is a mission of
the university—and probably its
most exciting mission.
Two Observations
Let me conclude with two ob
servations and questions.
First: As you spend your un
dergraduate years, acquiring
knowledge in the classrooms, in
the library and laboratory, in
discussions among yourselves
and with others, by participat
ing in a variety of activities, in
seeking, as we all do, to discover
and refine a set of values by
which each of us can live a
happy and helpful life, please
ponder this question: What
value a criticism, a conviction
or a principle which is not based
on knowledge?
Second: The vital statistics of
this nation indicate that in a few
years half of our population will
be less than 30 years of age.
This prospect should be very en
couraging for those of you who
accept the cliche that no one
over thirty can be trusted. But
not for long after those under
30 will have constituted a ma
jority, you will join the minor
ity. Will you then be knowledge
able enough to be trustworthy?
I believe that you will, and
that knowledge and trustworthi
ness will mean much to Stan
ford tomorrow, as it does today.
(Editor's Note: The following
are excerpts from President Ster
ling's convocation address, de
livered yesterday In Memorial
Auditorium. The annual winter
convocation is sponsored by
Stanford Today and Tomorrow.)
Mr. Chairman, Ladies and
Gentlemen:
Once again I would extend my
compliments, my thanks and my
best wishes to the Stanford To
day and Tomorrow Committee.
The students with whom I first
discussed the possibility of an
S.T.&T. program more than a
decade ago thought that such a
program might serve a useful
purpose. I hope that it still does.
The major problems confront
ing universities do not change
radically from year to year. Ma
jor problems have a way of
persisting, even among shifts
of emphasis. But the spirit and
willingness to consider change
should always exist. Last year at
this Convocation I pointed out
that the university as an institu
tion has been going through a
period of critical review during
the past decade and more, and
that the range and intensity of
this review during the past
decade and more, and that the
range and intensity of this re
view have increase in recent
years. This review is by no
means confined to the United
States. It is happening in na
tions, new and old, around the
world. . . .
It is not surprising that under
the pressure of larger enroll
ments universities have grown
both in number and in size, and
that educational budgets have
Increased. Nor is it surprising
that participation in the solution
of social problems has both
stimulated and obliged univer
sities to re-examine curricula.
Still in the context of univer
sity, it is important to note that
education throughout the world
gets its major financial support
from public funds —in most coun
tries almost entirely so. In only
a few countries, such as Japan,
the Philippines and the United
States, is the private sector of
higher education noteworthy,
and it is mainly in the United
States that institutions in the
private sector rival in strength
and distinction those in the pub
lic sector.
The financial dependence of
universities upon public funds
invariably raises the specter of
possible political influence — a
specter which has recently ap
peared on local horizons. Politi
cal influence can be exercised in
a variety of ways. It is a func
tion of government to determine
priorities among national needs,
and there is ample evidence, in
old countries and now, that the
allocation of public funds to edu
cation can be influenced by these
priorities.
Those who are zealous to pre
serve the educational indepen
dence and self-determination of
the university should be alert to
risks and dangers involved in
ever allowing the university, as
university, to become a political
instrument or a pawn in the
hands of those who would use
it as such, be those hands in
side or out the university. . . .
Prosperity And Interest
During the past two decades
the United States has been pros
perous, and its general public
has manifest greater interest in
education at all levels. Education
has benefited from both the pros
perity and the interest. . . .
Stanford, like so many of her
sister institutions, has been in
many ways the beneficiary of
this support and interest. In con
sequence, there has been change.
Since 1950, the student body has
increased in size by approxi

mately 40 per cent; the regular
faculty by 170 per cent. The an
nual fiscal operation of the Uni
versity, exclusive of improve
ments and additions to physical
plant, has increased by a factor
of 10. The building program has
not kept pace with increase in
enrollment and faculty. There is
less academic space per student
today than there was 15 years
ago, although substantial gains
have been made during the past
three years and more are in
early prospect.
The University's endownment
has increased more than four
fold, yet the income from it pays
for a smaller fraction of an
nual operating costs than it did
in 1950. Tuition has increased
from $600 in 1950, but it too pays
a smaller fraction of operating
costs today than it did then. The
University currently depends on
gifts and grants to support
about 30 per cent of its annual
operating expenditures, and to
pay for new buildings and the
rehabilitation of old ones. And
given the understandable fact
that donors have their own pref
erences as to the use of their
gifts, it follows that their pref
erences do not always coincide
with what the University regards
as its most urgent needs. In
other words, the University's
priorities of need may be modi
fied by the designation of gifts.
Two Problems
Manifestly, the University has
to address itself to problems
growing out of this siuation. Let
me mention two. One of these
problems — one which I men
tioned last year—is that of size.
It is clear that, despite the gains
recently made, we still need
more academic space adequately
to accommodate our present
faculty afid student body. And
it would be my hope that we
could continue to make gains as
a high priority in the faculty
student ratio, thereby adding fur
ther flexibility and strength to
teaching and research. There is
pressing need to add to library
resources and, as tuition in
creases, to amplify student fi
nancial aid. If these needs are to
be met out of available and
anticipated resources, with the
objective of improvinb academic
quality, serious consideration
must be given to the size of the
student body, not least of all at
the graduate level.
Another problem, not unre
lated to size, is that of the resi
dence university. Stanford be
gan as essentially a residence
university, and the aspiration
to continue as such is woven into
a large part of its history. But
increase in student numbers, ad
ditional mobility provided by the
automobile, and the capital cost
of new residence halls have com
bined to produce a situation in
which Stanford is less a resi
dence university than it used to
be, and to raise the question as
to whether the aspiration to be
a residence university is viable.
I would also recall from the not
so-distant past the study of un
dergraduate education at Stan
ford which was made a decade
ago. That study was directed
mainly to the possibility and de
sirability of curricular change.
It resulted, among other things,
in the General Studies program;
it also led to the development of
the overseas campuses for un
dergraduates. It is during the de
cade since that study was made
that Stanford has experienced
its major increase in enrollment,
particularly at the graduate
level, and has approximately
doubled the size of its faculty.
It is also during that dec&de that
the academic potential of the
student body has notably in
creased.

So, as I think you know, an
other study is now under way.
Last autumn a small planning
committee, including the presi
dent of the study body and an
other student, recommended that
the new study be as compre
hensive as possible; that it in
clude consideration of both grad
uate and undergraduate educa
tion, both curricular and extra
curricular programs; and that it
search out opportunities for in
novation, flexibility and im
provement.
Another Study
An executive committee of
seven or eight persons will be
in charge of the study. Professor
Herbert Packer, recently ap
pointed Vice-Provost for Aca
demic Planning and Programs,
is Chairman of the committee.
The committee will utilize a va
riety of task forces or ad hoc
committees as needed, so that
many faculty, students and of
ficers of the University will be
involved.
It is anticipated that the study
will extend through most if not
all of the next academic year,
but this does not mean that the
Committee will recommend no
thing until the study is com
pleted; rather it is intended that
recommendations will flow from
the Committee throughout the
course of the study. For instance,
priority attention will be given
to the concept of the residence
university and the problsm
therein entailed, including the
"Off" issue, the value of such
projects as Grove House, the
roles of Tutors, Sponsors and
.Resident Associates. It is to be
expected, therefore, that during
the next eighteen months or so
this University community will
be broadly and actively engaged
in this new study and in con
sidertion of the recommenda
tions which it produces. And I
dare say that one of the major
eventual considerations will be
this: How can educational re
view and improvement be, so to
speak, institutionalized and
thereby eliminate periodic and,
in Professor Parker's phrase,
"somewhat convulsive" attacks
on the problem.
University Government
If this is to be achieved, at
tention must be directed to Uni
versity government. This subject
needs attention for other reasons
as well, including that of size.
I have been interested to note
in the professional journals on
higher education that this sub
ject of university government
has had increasing attention dur
ing the past three or four years.
This has come about, as I read
the journals, in part because of
size—as student enrollments and
faculty have increased in num
ber—and in part because the
need for educational review and
'change calls for mechanisms
which will make possible knowl
edgeable discussion and delibera
tion of educational programs in
terms of the resources available
to support them.
University government stems
from the Charter, the legisaltive
statute or the constitutional pro
vision by which a given institu
tion was established. These char
ters or statutes vest authority
and responsibility in Boards of
Trustees, Regents or Governors.
From these Boards, subordinate
authority and responsibilities are
delegate to faculty, students and
officers of the institution. This is
the established pattern and I do
not anticipate that there will be
basic change in it at least at an
early date.
New Mechanisms
But it is not of this pattern
which I speak when I suggest
the need for new mechanisms,
because there is opportunity for

new mechanisms within the pat
tern. For instance, the Board of
Trustees of this University has
a Committee of its membership
presently engaged in a study of
the Board's composition and or
ganization. The objective is to
make more effective use of the
very considerable time which
Trustees devote to Stanford af
fairs, and thereby to keep them
still more closely in touch with
the academic programs and
needs of the University.
As Trustee organization is be
ing considered, so too might the
organization of the faculty and
of the student body benefit from
re-examination. Given the size
of the faculty and of the student
body respectively, it is unlikely
that the total membership of
each can be effectively and reg
ularly engaged in deliberations
on educational pr ogram and pol
icy.
For the faculty, this invites
the possibility of electing a rep
resentative body small enough
for constructive discussion and
large enough to give adequate
voice to the seven Schools. For
the students, it invites consider
ation of the reorganization of
student government if the pres
ent organization is judged to be
lacking in representation or per
formance. For all segments of
the University, it invites critical
attention to the invention of
mechanisms which will improve
collaborative effort to advance
the University by orderly pro
cedures.
It would seem to me that the
educational review now under
way would be incomplete if it
did not direct attention to the
subject of university govern
ment.
Suggestions
Before each of these Convo
cations I have asked students
to suggest topics which I might
discuss. The suggestion which
heads the list this year is this:
How can a student best spend
his undergraduate years?"
This question is by no means
new. I suspect that teachers and
counsellors have been hearing
that question for generations. I
suspect also that answers vary
from generation to generation,
and that they vary also within
any student generation as each
student seeks counsel for him
self and his individual concerns.
In the depressed 1930'5, for in
stance, at the surface of concern
for most students was how to
muster the financial where
withal to stay in school, and
the question of whether they
could get a job upon graduation.
They had some preoccupation
with economic security. Their
interest in public affairs was, as
I recall, directed to two main
considerations: One related di
rectly to the depression and led
to the question whether democ
racy could cope with the ten
sions, the dislocations and the
despair which the depression
produced, or whether some
other form of government could
cope more adequately with such
problems. . . .
The G.l.'s
Before the 1930's had passed
into history, much of the world
was at war. When it was over,
tens of thousands of Gl's re
sumed their education. They
had lost time. They were pre
occupied with catching up. They
were good students, eager to
learn, eager to complete college
and to begin a career and a fam
ily. This mood persisted into
the early 1950'5. There had not
been time for the mood to
change much between the con
clusion of World War II and the
outbreak of hostilities in Korea.
And the early 1950's included

also the sinister and unforget
able episode of McCarthyism.
These years did not include
anything but the beginnings of
the Civil Rights movement begin
ings which were dramatized by
the spotlight on schools in Little
Rock, Arkansas. And, with all
due respect, the then President
of the United States did not
have the appeal to youth that
he had to older generations—
certainly not the appeal to
youth which emanated from
John Fitzgerald Kennedy. So
the students of the 1950's came
to be regarded as the "silent
generation," and perhaps under
standably so.
Thus, at different times and in
different contexts students have
asked the question: How best
can a student spend his under
graduate years?
Students In the 'AO's
What of the context in which
the students of the 1960's ask
this question? I have no expert
diagnosis, nor do I know of any,
that is unassailable. Nor do I
know of any generalization
which applies precisely to any
individual student. But let me
invite your consideration of a
few observations.
1. Not one of today's students
has personally experienced a
major depression or its conse
quences.
2. Very few of today's stu
dents have had direct experience
in war. And none has had ex
perience in a war, such as World
War 11, in which the motivation
to serve was so broadly and na
tionally based. The war they
know is undeclared and far
away; it implements a national
policy which they and others
question and is administered by
a government which does not
command their full confidence.
3. The student generation of
the late 1950's and the 1960's is
the first to live under the threat
of nuclear war. I cannot mea
sure the impact of that threat,
but I should judge from conver
sations with many students that
many of you are affected by it.
Greater Pressure
4. Today's students have been
subjected to greater pressures
than their predecessors for get
ting into the college of their
choice—pressures which derive
in part from the great increase
in national enrollment. They
have felt these pressures since
age 14 or 15, and find, in col
lege, that these pressures con
tinue for those who, in increas
ing numbers, plan to go on to
graduate and professional
schools.
5. Partly because our society
is affluent and partly because a
burst of new knowledge has in
vited greater specialization, to
today's students, unlike those of
the 1930'5, are confronted with
multiple choice of opportunity.
In the opinion of one observer,
the very richness and diversity
of opportunity produce a sense
of insecurity. What choice
should the student make? What
if the choice is wrong?
6. I mentioned a moment ago
the appeal which President Ken
nedy had for youth. For many
students, their response to this
appeal may be seen in their
participation in the Peace Corps,
in the Civil Rights movement
and in other less publicized en
terprizes by which they seek to
help the underprivileged. Such
participation is for them the
deed and not merely the word
of idealism.

ford which was made a decade
ago. That study was directed
mainly to the possibility and de
sirability of curricular change.
It resulted, among other things,
in the General Studies program;
it also led to the development of
the overseas campuses for un
dergraduates. It is during the de
cade since that study was made
that Stanford has experienced
its major increase in enrollment,
particularly at the graduate
level, and has approximately
doubled the size of its faculty.
It is also during that dec&de that
the academic potential of the
student body has notably in
creased.

So, as I think you know, an
other study is now under way.
Last autumn a small planning
committee, including the presi
dent of the study body and an
other student, recommended that
the new study be as compre
hensive as possible; that it in
clude consideration of both grad
uate and undergraduate educa
tion, both curricular and extra
curricular programs; and that it
search out opportunities for in
novation, flexibility and im
provement.
Another Study
An executive committee of
seven or eight persons will be
in charge of the study. Professor
Herbert Packer, recently ap
pointed Vice-Provost for Aca
demic Planning and Programs,
is Chairman of the committee.
The committee will utilize a va
riety of task forces or ad hoc
committees as needed, so that
many faculty, students and of
ficers of the University will be
involved.
It is anticipated that the study
will extend through most if not
all of the next academic year,
but this does not mean that the
Committee will recommend no
thing until the study is com
pleted; rather it is intended that
recommendations will flow from
the Committee throughout the
course of the study. For instance,
priority attention will be given
to the concept of the residence
university and the problsm
therein entailed, including the
"Off" issue, the value of such
projects as Grove House, the
roles of Tutors, Sponsors and
.Resident Associates. It is to be
expected, therefore, that during
the next eighteen months or so
this University community will
be broadly and actively engaged
in this new study and in con
sidertion of the recommenda
tions which it produces. And I
dare say that one of the major
eventual considerations will be
this: How can educational re
view and improvement be, so to
speak, institutionalized and
thereby eliminate periodic and,
in Professor Parker's phrase,
"somewhat convulsive" attacks
on the problem.
University Government
If this is to be achieved, at
tention must be directed to Uni
versity government. This subject
needs attention for other reasons
as well, including that of size.
I have been interested to note
in the professional journals on
higher education that this sub
ject of university government
has had increasing attention dur
ing the past three or four years.
This has come about, as I read
the journals, in part because of
size—as student enrollments and
faculty have increased in num
ber—and in part because the
need for educational review and
'change calls for mechanisms
which will make possible knowl
edgeable discussion and delibera
tion of educational programs in
terms of the resources available
to support them.
University government stems
from the Charter, the legisaltive
statute or the constitutional pro
vision by which a given institu
tion was established. These char
ters or statutes vest authority
and responsibility in Boards of
Trustees, Regents or Governors.
From these Boards, subordinate
authority and responsibilities are
delegate to faculty, students and
officers of the institution. This is
the established pattern and I do
not anticipate that there will be
basic change in it at least at an
early date.
New Mechanisms
But it is not of this pattern
which I speak when I suggest
the need for new mechanisms,
because there is opportunity for

new mechanisms within the pat
tern. For instance, the Board of
Trustees of this University has
a Committee of its membership
presently engaged in a study of
the Board's composition and or
ganization. The objective is to
make more effective use of the
very considerable time which
Trustees devote to Stanford af
fairs, and thereby to keep them
still more closely in touch with
the academic programs and
needs of the University.
As Trustee organization is be
ing considered, so too might the
organization of the faculty and
of the student body benefit from
re-examination. Given the size
of the faculty and of the student
body respectively, it is unlikely
that the total membership of
each can be effectively and reg
ularly engaged in deliberations
on educational pr ogram and pol
icy.
For the faculty, this invites
the possibility of electing a rep
resentative body small enough
for constructive discussion and
large enough to give adequate
voice to the seven Schools. For
the students, it invites consider
ation of the reorganization of
student government if the pres
ent organization is judged to be
lacking in representation or per
formance. For all segments of
the University, it invites critical
attention to the invention of
mechanisms which will improve
collaborative effort to advance
the University by orderly pro
cedures.
It would seem to me that the
educational review now under
way would be incomplete if it
did not direct attention to the
subject of university govern
ment.
Suggestions
Before each of these Convo
cations I have asked students
to suggest topics which I might
discuss. The suggestion which
heads the list this year is this:
How can a student best spend
his undergraduate years?"
This question is by no means
new. I suspect that teachers and
counsellors have been hearing
that question for generations. I
suspect also that answers vary
from generation to generation,
and that they vary also within
any student generation as each
student seeks counsel for him
self and his individual concerns.
In the depressed 1930'5, for in
stance, at the surface of concern
for most students was how to
muster the financial where
withal to stay in school, and
the question of whether they
could get a job upon graduation.
They had some preoccupation
with economic security. Their
interest in public affairs was, as
I recall, directed to two main
considerations: One related di
rectly to the depression and led
to the question whether democ
racy could cope with the ten
sions, the dislocations and the
despair which the depression
produced, or whether some
other form of government could
cope more adequately with such
problems. . . .
The G.l.'s
Before the 1930's had passed
into history, much of the world
was at war. When it was over,
tens of thousands of Gl's re
sumed their education. They
had lost time. They were pre
occupied with catching up. They
were good students, eager to
learn, eager to complete college
and to begin a career and a fam
ily. This mood persisted into
the early 1950'5. There had not
been time for the mood to
change much between the con
clusion of World War II and the
outbreak of hostilities in Korea.
And the early 1950's included

also the sinister and unforget
able episode of McCarthyism.
These years did not include
anything but the beginnings of
the Civil Rights movement begin
ings which were dramatized by
the spotlight on schools in Little
Rock, Arkansas. And, with all
due respect, the then President
of the United States did not
have the appeal to youth that
he had to older generations—
certainly not the appeal to
youth which emanated from
John Fitzgerald Kennedy. So
the students of the 1950's came
to be regarded as the "silent
generation," and perhaps under
standably so.
Thus, at different times and in
different contexts students have
asked the question: How best
can a student spend his under
graduate years?
Students In the 'AO's
What of the context in which
the students of the 1960's ask
this question? I have no expert
diagnosis, nor do I know of any,
that is unassailable. Nor do I
know of any generalization
which applies precisely to any
individual student. But let me
invite your consideration of a
few observations.
1. Not one of today's students
has personally experienced a
major depression or its conse
quences.
2. Very few of today's stu
dents have had direct experience
in war. And none has had ex
perience in a war, such as World
War 11, in which the motivation
to serve was so broadly and na
tionally based. The war they
know is undeclared and far
away; it implements a national
policy which they and others
question and is administered by
a government which does not
command their full confidence.
3. The student generation of
the late 1950's and the 1960's is
the first to live under the threat
of nuclear war. I cannot mea
sure the impact of that threat,
but I should judge from conver
sations with many students that
many of you are affected by it.
Greater Pressure
4. Today's students have been
subjected to greater pressures
than their predecessors for get
ting into the college of their
choice—pressures which derive
in part from the great increase
in national enrollment. They
have felt these pressures since
age 14 or 15, and find, in col
lege, that these pressures con
tinue for those who, in increas
ing numbers, plan to go on to
graduate and professional
schools.
5. Partly because our society
is affluent and partly because a
burst of new knowledge has in
vited greater specialization, to
today's students, unlike those of
the 1930'5, are confronted with
multiple choice of opportunity.
In the opinion of one observer,
the very richness and diversity
of opportunity produce a sense
of insecurity. What choice
should the student make? What
if the choice is wrong?
6. I mentioned a moment ago
the appeal which President Ken
nedy had for youth. For many
students, their response to this
appeal may be seen in their
participation in the Peace Corps,
in the Civil Rights movement
and in other less publicized en
terprizes by which they seek to
help the underprivileged. Such
participation is for them the
deed and not merely the word
of idealism.
Time For Idealism
Youth is peculiarly the time
for idealism and not infrequent
ly in this generation or others
this idealism is coupled with re
jectlon. The degree and depth
of this rejection are always
hard, if not impossible, to mea
sure. Today some students seem
to reject specialization—they
want to be the Renaissance and
some, presumably hope for a
part, and perhaps this number
is greater, reject the value-sys
tem of their parents and puzzle
themselves as to why this par
ticular rejection is not better
understood. Hence the so-called
generation-gap and, I suppose,
a part of the credibility gap.
There is, for some, rejection of
what they regard as slavishness
to conformity—conformity in
dress, in conventional manners,
and in such things as the am
bition to have a house in the
suburbs, a two-car family and
a colored televsiion within easy
reach.
I dare say that these observa
tions do not embrace the whole
context out of which today's
students ask the question, "How
best can I spend my undergrad
uate years?" But I suggest that
they are significant parts of the
whole, The context in which the
question is asked varies with
time and circumstance, but the
question itself is a hardy per
ennial.
Partial Answer
Part of the answer lies within
cach of you. You know better
than anyone else why you came

to college. I take it that you
wanted to do so, that few, if
any, of you came against your
will and only in response to
some parental or other pres
sure. And you should know bet
ter than anyone else why you
wanted to come. I should as
sume that the basic reason was,
of course, to continue your edu
cation. The opportunity to do so
in a new environment away
from home was probably not
unappealing to you. The pros
pect of enjoying a kind of new
freedom had its attractions as
well as anxieties. Many, if not
most, of you thought of college
as a natural, even necessary,
next step in preparation for a
career. I doubt that you thought
of college and a baccalaureate
degree simply as a status sym
bol. How consciously you looked
forward to college as an experi
ence in self development I don't
know, but it was probably some
where in your stream of con
sciousness. In any event, you
should know better than any
one else why you wanted to
come to college.
How aware were you when
you came that knowledge is the
most powerful of all human re
sources, that there is more
knowledge today than ever be
fore, and that its rate of accum
ulation continues to accelerate.
Since knowledge is the most im
portant commodity a college or

university has to offer, it fol
lows that a student's major op
portunity is to absorb and col
late as much of it as possible so
that he may harness and hitch
it and put it to work. . .
Commitment
There is a word in our vocabu
lary which I hear many of you
use with considerable frequency.
It is the word "commitment."
As I hear you use the word, it
is most frequently associated
with a sense of urgency to im
prove society, including the Uni
versity. I delight in this, even
though my delight is sometimes
punctuated with problems. I de
light in it because it bespeaks
a concern about the welfare of
mankind and a desire to be of
service I know of no commit
ment which can result in better
self development or in greater
service to mankind than a com
mitment to learn, a commitment
to knowledge. And this is the
prime commitment which I
would urge you to make. The
basic purpose of the educational
review now under way, in which
important contributions are ex
pected from you, is to discover
better ways and opportunities
to acquire knowledge and to put
knowledge to work so that bet
ter ways may be found to solve
problems great and small which
beset society.
The whole purpose of knowl
edge is to liberate—to liberate

from ignorance, from perjudice,
and from obsolence. There is
much knowledge to be discov
ered; this, too, is a mission of
the university—and probably its
most exciting mission.
Two Observations
Let me conclude with two ob
servations and questions.
First: As you spend your un
dergraduate years, acquiring
knowledge in the classrooms, in
the library and laboratory, in
discussions among yourselves
and with others, by participat
ing in a variety of activities, in
seeking, as we all do, to discover
and refine a set of values by
which each of us can live a
happy and helpful life, please
ponder this question: What
value a criticism, a conviction
or a principle which is not based
on knowledge?
Second: The vital statistics of
this nation indicate that in a few
years half of our population will
be less than 30 years of age.
This prospect should be very en
couraging for those of you who
accept the cliche that no one
over thirty can be trusted. But
not for long after those under
30 will have constituted a ma
jority, you will join the minor
ity. Will you then be knowledge
able enough to be trustworthy?
I believe that you will, and
that knowledge and trustworthi
ness will mean much to Stan
ford tomorrow, as it does today.

(Editor's Note: The following
are excerpts from President Ster
ling's convocation address, de
livered yesterday In Memorial
Auditorium. The annual winter
convocation is sponsored by
Stanford Today and Tomorrow.)
Mr. Chairman, Ladies and
Gentlemen:
Once again I would extend my
compliments, my thanks and my
best wishes to the Stanford To
day and Tomorrow Committee.
The students with whom I first
discussed the possibility of an
S.T.&T. program more than a
decade ago thought that such a
program might serve a useful
purpose. I hope that it still does.
The major problems confront
ing universities do not change
radically from year to year. Ma
jor problems have a way of
persisting, even among shifts
of emphasis. But the spirit and
willingness to consider change
should always exist. Last year at
this Convocation I pointed out
that the university as an institu
tion has been going through a
period of critical review during
the past decade and more, and
that the range and intensity of
this review during the past
decade and more, and that the
range and intensity of this re
view have increase in recent
years. This review is by no
means confined to the United
States. It is happening in na
tions, new and old, around the
world. . . .
It is not surprising that under
the pressure of larger enroll
ments universities have grown
both in number and in size, and
that educational budgets have
Increased. Nor is it surprising
that participation in the solution
of social problems has both
stimulated and obliged univer
sities to re-examine curricula.
Still in the context of univer
sity, it is important to note that
education throughout the world
gets its major financial support
from public funds —in most coun
tries almost entirely so. In only
a few countries, such as Japan,
the Philippines and the United
States, is the private sector of
higher education noteworthy,
and it is mainly in the United
States that institutions in the
private sector rival in strength
and distinction those in the pub
lic sector.
The financial dependence of
universities upon public funds
invariably raises the specter of
possible political influence — a
specter which has recently ap
peared on local horizons. Politi
cal influence can be exercised in
a variety of ways. It is a func
tion of government to determine
priorities among national needs,
and there is ample evidence, in
old countries and now, that the
allocation of public funds to edu
cation can be influenced by these
priorities.
Those who are zealous to pre
serve the educational indepen
dence and self-determination of
the university should be alert to
risks and dangers involved in
ever allowing the university, as
university, to become a political
instrument or a pawn in the
hands of those who would use
it as such, be those hands in
side or out the university. . . .
Prosperity And Interest
During the past two decades
the United States has been pros
perous, and its general public
has manifest greater interest in
education at all levels. Education
has benefited from both the pros
perity and the interest. . . .
Stanford, like so many of her
sister institutions, has been in
many ways the beneficiary of
this support and interest. In con
sequence, there has been change.
Since 1950, the student body has
increased in size by approxi

mately 40 per cent; the regular
faculty by 170 per cent. The an
nual fiscal operation of the Uni
versity, exclusive of improve
ments and additions to physical
plant, has increased by a factor
of 10. The building program has
not kept pace with increase in
enrollment and faculty. There is
less academic space per student
today than there was 15 years
ago, although substantial gains
have been made during the past
three years and more are in
early prospect.
The University's endownment
has increased more than four
fold, yet the income from it pays
for a smaller fraction of an
nual operating costs than it did
in 1950. Tuition has increased
from $600 in 1950, but it too pays
a smaller fraction of operating
costs today than it did then. The
University currently depends on
gifts and grants to support
about 30 per cent of its annual
operating expenditures, and to
pay for new buildings and the
rehabilitation of old ones. And
given the understandable fact
that donors have their own pref
erences as to the use of their
gifts, it follows that their pref
erences do not always coincide
with what the University regards
as its most urgent needs. In
other words, the University's
priorities of need may be modi
fied by the designation of gifts.
Two Problems
Manifestly, the University has
to address itself to problems
growing out of this siuation. Let
me mention two. One of these
problems — one which I men
tioned last year—is that of size.
It is clear that, despite the gains
recently made, we still need
more academic space adequately
to accommodate our present
faculty afid student body. And
it would be my hope that we
could continue to make gains as
a high priority in the faculty
student ratio, thereby adding fur
ther flexibility and strength to
teaching and research. There is
pressing need to add to library
resources and, as tuition in
creases, to amplify student fi
nancial aid. If these needs are to
be met out of available and
anticipated resources, with the
objective of improvinb academic
quality, serious consideration
must be given to the size of the
student body, not least of all at
the graduate level.
Another problem, not unre
lated to size, is that of the resi
dence university. Stanford be
gan as essentially a residence
university, and the aspiration
to continue as such is woven into
a large part of its history. But
increase in student numbers, ad
ditional mobility provided by the
automobile, and the capital cost
of new residence halls have com
bined to produce a situation in
which Stanford is less a resi
dence university than it used to
be, and to raise the question as
to whether the aspiration to be
a residence university is viable.
I would also recall from the not
so-distant past the study of un
dergraduate education at Stan
ford which was made a decade
ago. That study was directed
mainly to the possibility and de
sirability of curricular change.
It resulted, among other things,
in the General Studies program;
it also led to the development of
the overseas campuses for un
dergraduates. It is during the de
cade since that study was made
that Stanford has experienced
its major increase in enrollment,
particularly at the graduate
level, and has approximately
doubled the size of its faculty.
It is also during that dec&de that
the academic potential of the
student body has notably in
creased.

So, as I think you know, an
other study is now under way.
Last autumn a small planning
committee, including the presi
dent of the study body and an
other student, recommended that
the new study be as compre
hensive as possible; that it in
clude consideration of both grad
uate and undergraduate educa
tion, both curricular and extra
curricular programs; and that it
search out opportunities for in
novation, flexibility and im
provement.
Another Study
An executive committee of
seven or eight persons will be
in charge of the study. Professor
Herbert Packer, recently ap
pointed Vice-Provost for Aca
demic Planning and Programs,
is Chairman of the committee.
The committee will utilize a va
riety of task forces or ad hoc
committees as needed, so that
many faculty, students and of
ficers of the University will be
involved.
It is anticipated that the study
will extend through most if not
all of the next academic year,
but this does not mean that the
Committee will recommend no
thing until the study is com
pleted; rather it is intended that
recommendations will flow from
the Committee throughout the
course of the study. For instance,
priority attention will be given
to the concept of the residence
university and the problsm
therein entailed, including the
"Off" issue, the value of such
projects as Grove House, the
roles of Tutors, Sponsors and
.Resident Associates. It is to be
expected, therefore, that during
the next eighteen months or so
this University community will
be broadly and actively engaged
in this new study and in con
sidertion of the recommenda
tions which it produces. And I
dare say that one of the major
eventual considerations will be
this: How can educational re
view and improvement be, so to
speak, institutionalized and
thereby eliminate periodic and,
in Professor Parker's phrase,
"somewhat convulsive" attacks
on the problem.
University Government
If this is to be achieved, at
tention must be directed to Uni
versity government. This subject
needs attention for other reasons
as well, including that of size.
I have been interested to note
in the professional journals on
higher education that this sub
ject of university government
has had increasing attention dur
ing the past three or four years.
This has come about, as I read
the journals, in part because of
size—as student enrollments and
faculty have increased in num
ber—and in part because the
need for educational review and
'change calls for mechanisms
which will make possible knowl
edgeable discussion and delibera
tion of educational programs in
terms of the resources available
to support them.
University government stems
from the Charter, the legisaltive
statute or the constitutional pro
vision by which a given institu
tion was established. These char
ters or statutes vest authority
and responsibility in Boards of
Trustees, Regents or Governors.
From these Boards, subordinate
authority and responsibilities are
delegate to faculty, students and
officers of the institution. This is
the established pattern and I do
not anticipate that there will be
basic change in it at least at an
early date.
New Mechanisms
But it is not of this pattern
which I speak when I suggest
the need for new mechanisms,
because there is opportunity for

new mechanisms within the pat
tern. For instance, the Board of
Trustees of this University has
a Committee of its membership
presently engaged in a study of
the Board's composition and or
ganization. The objective is to
make more effective use of the
very considerable time which
Trustees devote to Stanford af
fairs, and thereby to keep them
still more closely in touch with
the academic programs and
needs of the University.
As Trustee organization is be
ing considered, so too might the
organization of the faculty and
of the student body benefit from
re-examination. Given the size
of the faculty and of the student
body respectively, it is unlikely
that the total membership of
each can be effectively and reg
ularly engaged in deliberations
on educational pr ogram and pol
icy.
For the faculty, this invites
the possibility of electing a rep
resentative body small enough
for constructive discussion and
large enough to give adequate
voice to the seven Schools. For
the students, it invites consider
ation of the reorganization of
student government if the pres
ent organization is judged to be
lacking in representation or per
formance. For all segments of
the University, it invites critical
attention to the invention of
mechanisms which will improve
collaborative effort to advance
the University by orderly pro
cedures.
It would seem to me that the
educational review now under
way would be incomplete if it
did not direct attention to the
subject of university govern
ment.
Suggestions
Before each of these Convo
cations I have asked students
to suggest topics which I might
discuss. The suggestion which
heads the list this year is this:
How can a student best spend
his undergraduate years?"
This question is by no means
new. I suspect that teachers and
counsellors have been hearing
that question for generations. I
suspect also that answers vary
from generation to generation,
and that they vary also within
any student generation as each
student seeks counsel for him
self and his individual concerns.
In the depressed 1930'5, for in
stance, at the surface of concern
for most students was how to
muster the financial where
withal to stay in school, and
the question of whether they
could get a job upon graduation.
They had some preoccupation
with economic security. Their
interest in public affairs was, as
I recall, directed to two main
considerations: One related di
rectly to the depression and led
to the question whether democ
racy could cope with the ten
sions, the dislocations and the
despair which the depression
produced, or whether some
other form of government could
cope more adequately with such
problems. . . .
The G.l.'s
Before the 1930's had passed
into history, much of the world
was at war. When it was over,
tens of thousands of Gl's re
sumed their education. They
had lost time. They were pre
occupied with catching up. They
were good students, eager to
learn, eager to complete college
and to begin a career and a fam
ily. This mood persisted into
the early 1950'5. There had not
been time for the mood to
change much between the con
clusion of World War II and the
outbreak of hostilities in Korea.
And the early 1950's included

also the sinister and unforget
able episode of McCarthyism.
These years did not include
anything but the beginnings of
the Civil Rights movement begin
ings which were dramatized by
the spotlight on schools in Little
Rock, Arkansas. And, with all
due respect, the then President
of the United States did not
have the appeal to youth that
he had to older generations—
certainly not the appeal to
youth which emanated from
John Fitzgerald Kennedy. So
the students of the 1950's came
to be regarded as the "silent
generation," and perhaps under
standably so.
Thus, at different times and in
different contexts students have
asked the question: How best
can a student spend his under
graduate years?
Students In the 'AO's
What of the context in which
the students of the 1960's ask
this question? I have no expert
diagnosis, nor do I know of any,
that is unassailable. Nor do I
know of any generalization
which applies precisely to any
individual student. But let me
invite your consideration of a
few observations.
1. Not one of today's students
has personally experienced a
major depression or its conse
quences.
2. Very few of today's stu
dents have had direct experience
in war. And none has had ex
perience in a war, such as World
War 11, in which the motivation
to serve was so broadly and na
tionally based. The war they
know is undeclared and far
away; it implements a national
policy which they and others
question and is administered by
a government which does not
command their full confidence.
3. The student generation of
the late 1950's and the 1960's is
the first to live under the threat
of nuclear war. I cannot mea
sure the impact of that threat,
but I should judge from conver
sations with many students that
many of you are affected by it.
Greater Pressure
4. Today's students have been
subjected to greater pressures
than their predecessors for get
ting into the college of their
choice—pressures which derive
in part from the great increase
in national enrollment. They
have felt these pressures since
age 14 or 15, and find, in col
lege, that these pressures con
tinue for those who, in increas
ing numbers, plan to go on to
graduate and professional
schools.
5. Partly because our society
is affluent and partly because a
burst of new knowledge has in
vited greater specialization, to
today's students, unlike those of
the 1930'5, are confronted with
multiple choice of opportunity.
In the opinion of one observer,
the very richness and diversity
of opportunity produce a sense
of insecurity. What choice
should the student make? What
if the choice is wrong?
6. I mentioned a moment ago
the appeal which President Ken
nedy had for youth. For many
students, their response to this
appeal may be seen in their
participation in the Peace Corps,
in the Civil Rights movement
and in other less publicized en
terprizes by which they seek to
help the underprivileged. Such
participation is for them the
deed and not merely the word
of idealism.
Time For Idealism
Youth is peculiarly the time
for idealism and not infrequent
ly in this generation or others
this idealism is coupled with re
jectlon. The degree and depth
of this rejection are always
hard, if not impossible, to mea
sure. Today some students seem
to reject specialization—they
want to be the Renaissance and
some, presumably hope for a
part, and perhaps this number
is greater, reject the value-sys
tem of their parents and puzzle
themselves as to why this par
ticular rejection is not better
understood. Hence the so-called
generation-gap and, I suppose,
a part of the credibility gap.
There is, for some, rejection of
what they regard as slavishness
to conformity—conformity in
dress, in conventional manners,
and in such things as the am
bition to have a house in the
suburbs, a two-car family and
a colored televsiion within easy
reach.
I dare say that these observa
tions do not embrace the whole
context out of which today's
students ask the question, "How
best can I spend my undergrad
uate years?" But I suggest that
they are significant parts of the
whole, The context in which the
question is asked varies with
time and circumstance, but the
question itself is a hardy per
ennial.
Partial Answer
Part of the answer lies within
cach of you. You know better
than anyone else why you came

to college. I take it that you
wanted to do so, that few, if
any, of you came against your
will and only in response to
some parental or other pres
sure. And you should know bet
ter than anyone else why you
wanted to come. I should as
sume that the basic reason was,
of course, to continue your edu
cation. The opportunity to do so
in a new environment away
from home was probably not
unappealing to you. The pros
pect of enjoying a kind of new
freedom had its attractions as
well as anxieties. Many, if not
most, of you thought of college
as a natural, even necessary,
next step in preparation for a
career. I doubt that you thought
of college and a baccalaureate
degree simply as a status sym
bol. How consciously you looked
forward to college as an experi
ence in self development I don't
know, but it was probably some
where in your stream of con
sciousness. In any event, you
should know better than any
one else why you wanted to
come to college.
How aware were you when
you came that knowledge is the
most powerful of all human re
sources, that there is more
knowledge today than ever be
fore, and that its rate of accum
ulation continues to accelerate.
Since knowledge is the most im
portant commodity a college or

university has to offer, it fol
lows that a student's major op
portunity is to absorb and col
late as much of it as possible so
that he may harness and hitch
it and put it to work. . .
Commitment
There is a word in our vocabu
lary which I hear many of you
use with considerable frequency.
It is the word "commitment."
As I hear you use the word, it
is most frequently associated
with a sense of urgency to im
prove society, including the Uni
versity. I delight in this, even
though my delight is sometimes
punctuated with problems. I de
light in it because it bespeaks
a concern about the welfare of
mankind and a desire to be of
service I know of no commit
ment which can result in better
self development or in greater
service to mankind than a com
mitment to learn, a commitment
to knowledge. And this is the
prime commitment which I
would urge you to make. The
basic purpose of the educational
review now under way, in which
important contributions are ex
pected from you, is to discover
better ways and opportunities
to acquire knowledge and to put
knowledge to work so that bet
ter ways may be found to solve
problems great and small which
beset society.
The whole purpose of knowl
edge is to liberate—to liberate

from ignorance, from perjudice,
and from obsolence. There is
much knowledge to be discov
ered; this, too, is a mission of
the university—and probably its
most exciting mission.
Two Observations
Let me conclude with two ob
servations and questions.
First: As you spend your un
dergraduate years, acquiring
knowledge in the classrooms, in
the library and laboratory, in
discussions among yourselves
and with others, by participat
ing in a variety of activities, in
seeking, as we all do, to discover
and refine a set of values by
which each of us can live a
happy and helpful life, please
ponder this question: What
value a criticism, a conviction
or a principle which is not based
on knowledge?
Second: The vital statistics of
this nation indicate that in a few
years half of our population will
be less than 30 years of age.
This prospect should be very en
couraging for those of you who
accept the cliche that no one
over thirty can be trusted. But
not for long after those under
30 will have constituted a ma
jority, you will join the minor
ity. Will you then be knowledge
able enough to be trustworthy?
I believe that you will, and
that knowledge and trustworthi
ness will mean much to Stan
ford tomorrow, as it does today.
(Editor's Note: The following
are excerpts from President Ster
ling's convocation address, de
livered yesterday In Memorial
Auditorium. The annual winter
convocation is sponsored by
Stanford Today and Tomorrow.)
Mr. Chairman, Ladies and
Gentlemen:
Once again I would extend my
compliments, my thanks and my
best wishes to the Stanford To
day and Tomorrow Committee.
The students with whom I first
discussed the possibility of an
S.T.&T. program more than a
decade ago thought that such a
program might serve a useful
purpose. I hope that it still does.
The major problems confront
ing universities do not change
radically from year to year. Ma
jor problems have a way of
persisting, even among shifts
of emphasis. But the spirit and
willingness to consider change
should always exist. Last year at
this Convocation I pointed out
that the university as an institu
tion has been going through a
period of critical review during
the past decade and more, and
that the range and intensity of
this review during the past
decade and more, and that the
range and intensity of this re
view have increase in recent
years. This review is by no
means confined to the United
States. It is happening in na
tions, new and old, around the
world. . . .
It is not surprising that under
the pressure of larger enroll
ments universities have grown
both in number and in size, and
that educational budgets have
Increased. Nor is it surprising
that participation in the solution
of social problems has both
stimulated and obliged univer
sities to re-examine curricula.
Still in the context of univer
sity, it is important to note that
education throughout the world
gets its major financial support
from public funds —in most coun
tries almost entirely so. In only
a few countries, such as Japan,
the Philippines and the United
States, is the private sector of
higher education noteworthy,
and it is mainly in the United
States that institutions in the
private sector rival in strength
and distinction those in the pub
lic sector.
The financial dependence of
universities upon public funds
invariably raises the specter of
possible political influence — a
specter which has recently ap
peared on local horizons. Politi
cal influence can be exercised in
a variety of ways. It is a func
tion of government to determine
priorities among national needs,
and there is ample evidence, in
old countries and now, that the
allocation of public funds to edu
cation can be influenced by these
priorities.
Those who are zealous to pre
serve the educational indepen
dence and self-determination of
the university should be alert to
risks and dangers involved in
ever allowing the university, as
university, to become a political
instrument or a pawn in the
hands of those who would use
it as such, be those hands in
side or out the university. . . .
Prosperity And Interest
During the past two decades
the United States has been pros
perous, and its general public
has manifest greater interest in
education at all levels. Education
has benefited from both the pros
perity and the interest. . . .
Stanford, like so many of her
sister institutions, has been in
many ways the beneficiary of
this support and interest. In con
sequence, there has been change.
Since 1950, the student body has
increased in size by approxi

mately 40 per cent; the regular
faculty by 170 per cent. The an
nual fiscal operation of the Uni
versity, exclusive of improve
ments and additions to physical
plant, has increased by a factor
of 10. The building program has
not kept pace with increase in
enrollment and faculty. There is
less academic space per student
today than there was 15 years
ago, although substantial gains
have been made during the past
three years and more are in
early prospect.
The University's endownment
has increased more than four
fold, yet the income from it pays
for a smaller fraction of an
nual operating costs than it did
in 1950. Tuition has increased
from $600 in 1950, but it too pays
a smaller fraction of operating
costs today than it did then. The
University currently depends on
gifts and grants to support
about 30 per cent of its annual
operating expenditures, and to
pay for new buildings and the
rehabilitation of old ones. And
given the understandable fact
that donors have their own pref
erences as to the use of their
gifts, it follows that their pref
erences do not always coincide
with what the University regards
as its most urgent needs. In
other words, the University's
priorities of need may be modi
fied by the designation of gifts.
Two Problems
Manifestly, the University has
to address itself to problems
growing out of this siuation. Let
me mention two. One of these
problems — one which I men
tioned last year—is that of size.
It is clear that, despite the gains
recently made, we still need
more academic space adequately
to accommodate our present
faculty afid student body. And
it would be my hope that we
could continue to make gains as
a high priority in the faculty
student ratio, thereby adding fur
ther flexibility and strength to
teaching and research. There is
pressing need to add to library
resources and, as tuition in
creases, to amplify student fi
nancial aid. If these needs are to
be met out of available and
anticipated resources, with the
objective of improvinb academic
quality, serious consideration
must be given to the size of the
student body, not least of all at
the graduate level.
Another problem, not unre
lated to size, is that of the resi
dence university. Stanford be
gan as essentially a residence
university, and the aspiration
to continue as such is woven into
a large part of its history. But
increase in student numbers, ad
ditional mobility provided by the
automobile, and the capital cost
of new residence halls have com
bined to produce a situation in
which Stanford is less a resi
dence university than it used to
be, and to raise the question as
to whether the aspiration to be
a residence university is viable.
I would also recall from the not
so-distant past the study of un
dergraduate education at Stan
ford which was made a decade
ago. That study was directed
mainly to the possibility and de
sirability of curricular change.
It resulted, among other things,
in the General Studies program;
it also led to the development of
the overseas campuses for un
dergraduates. It is during the de
cade since that study was made
that Stanford has experienced
its major increase in enrollment,
particularly at the graduate
level, and has approximately
doubled the size of its faculty.
It is also during that dec&de that
the academic potential of the
student body has notably in
creased.

So, as I think you know, an
other study is now under way.
Last autumn a small planning
committee, including the presi
dent of the study body and an
other student, recommended that
the new study be as compre
hensive as possible; that it in
clude consideration of both grad
uate and undergraduate educa
tion, both curricular and extra
curricular programs; and that it
search out opportunities for in
novation, flexibility and im
provement.
Another Study
An executive committee of
seven or eight persons will be
in charge of the study. Professor
Herbert Packer, recently ap
pointed Vice-Provost for Aca
demic Planning and Programs,
is Chairman of the committee.
The committee will utilize a va
riety of task forces or ad hoc
committees as needed, so that
many faculty, students and of
ficers of the University will be
involved.
It is anticipated that the study
will extend through most if not
all of the next academic year,
but this does not mean that the
Committee will recommend no
thing until the study is com
pleted; rather it is intended that
recommendations will flow from
the Committee throughout the
course of the study. For instance,
priority attention will be given
to the concept of the residence
university and the problsm
therein entailed, including the
"Off" issue, the value of such
projects as Grove House, the
roles of Tutors, Sponsors and
.Resident Associates. It is to be
expected, therefore, that during
the next eighteen months or so
this University community will
be broadly and actively engaged
in this new study and in con
sidertion of the recommenda
tions which it produces. And I
dare say that one of the major
eventual considerations will be
this: How can educational re
view and improvement be, so to
speak, institutionalized and
thereby eliminate periodic and,
in Professor Parker's phrase,
"somewhat convulsive" attacks
on the problem.
University Government
If this is to be achieved, at
tention must be directed to Uni
versity government. This subject
needs attention for other reasons
as well, including that of size.
I have been interested to note
in the professional journals on
higher education that this sub
ject of university government
has had increasing attention dur
ing the past three or four years.
This has come about, as I read
the journals, in part because of
size—as student enrollments and
faculty have increased in num
ber—and in part because the
need for educational review and
'change calls for mechanisms
which will make possible knowl
edgeable discussion and delibera
tion of educational programs in
terms of the resources available
to support them.
University government stems
from the Charter, the legisaltive
statute or the constitutional pro
vision by which a given institu
tion was established. These char
ters or statutes vest authority
and responsibility in Boards of
Trustees, Regents or Governors.
From these Boards, subordinate
authority and responsibilities are
delegate to faculty, students and
officers of the institution. This is
the established pattern and I do
not anticipate that there will be
basic change in it at least at an
early date.
New Mechanisms
But it is not of this pattern
which I speak when I suggest
the need for new mechanisms,
because there is opportunity for

new mechanisms within the pat
tern. For instance, the Board of
Trustees of this University has
a Committee of its membership
presently engaged in a study of
the Board's composition and or
ganization. The objective is to
make more effective use of the
very considerable time which
Trustees devote to Stanford af
fairs, and thereby to keep them
still more closely in touch with
the academic programs and
needs of the University.
As Trustee organization is be
ing considered, so too might the
organization of the faculty and
of the student body benefit from
re-examination. Given the size
of the faculty and of the student
body respectively, it is unlikely
that the total membership of
each can be effectively and reg
ularly engaged in deliberations
on educational pr ogram and pol
icy.
For the faculty, this invites
the possibility of electing a rep
resentative body small enough
for constructive discussion and
large enough to give adequate
voice to the seven Schools. For
the students, it invites consider
ation of the reorganization of
student government if the pres
ent organization is judged to be
lacking in representation or per
formance. For all segments of
the University, it invites critical
attention to the invention of
mechanisms which will improve
collaborative effort to advance
the University by orderly pro
cedures.
It would seem to me that the
educational review now under
way would be incomplete if it
did not direct attention to the
subject of university govern
ment.
Suggestions
Before each of these Convo
cations I have asked students
to suggest topics which I might
discuss. The suggestion which
heads the list this year is this:
How can a student best spend
his undergraduate years?"
This question is by no means
new. I suspect that teachers and
counsellors have been hearing
that question for generations. I
suspect also that answers vary
from generation to generation,
and that they vary also within
any student generation as each
student seeks counsel for him
self and his individual concerns.
In the depressed 1930'5, for in
stance, at the surface of concern
for most students was how to
muster the financial where
withal to stay in school, and
the question of whether they
could get a job upon graduation.
They had some preoccupation
with economic security. Their
interest in public affairs was, as
I recall, directed to two main
considerations: One related di
rectly to the depression and led
to the question whether democ
racy could cope with the ten
sions, the dislocations and the
despair which the depression
produced, or whether some
other form of government could
cope more adequately with such
problems. . . .
The G.l.'s
Before the 1930's had passed
into history, much of the world
was at war. When it was over,
tens of thousands of Gl's re

had lost time. They were pre
occupied with catching up. They
were good students, eager to

the early 1950'5. There had not
been time for the mood to
change much between the con
clusion of World War II and the
outbreak of hostilities in Korea.
And the early 1950's included

also the sinister and unforget
able episode of McCarthyism.
These years did not include
anything but the beginnings of
the Civil Rights movement begin
ings which were dramatized by
the spotlight on schools in Little
Rock, Arkansas. And, with all
due respect, the then President
of the United States did not
have the appeal to youth that
he had to older generations—
certainly not the appeal to
youth which emanated from
John Fitzgerald Kennedy. So
the students of the 1950's came
to be regarded as the "silent

standably so.
Thus, at different times and in
different contexts students have
asked the question: How best
can a student spend his under
graduate years?
Students In the 'AO's

the students of the 1960's ask
this question? I have no expert

invite your consideration of a

has personally experienced a
major depression or its conse

2. Very few of today's stu

the first to live under the threat
of nuclear war. I cannot mea
sure the impact of that threat,
but I should judge from conver
sations with many students that
many of you are affected by it.
Greater Pressure
4. Today's students have been
subjected to greater pressures
than their predecessors for get
ting into the college of their
choice—pressures which derive
in part from the great increase
in national enrollment. They
have felt these pressures since
age 14 or 15, and find, in col
lege, that these pressures con
tinue for those who, in increas
ing numbers, plan to go on to
graduate and professional

5. Partly because our society
is affluent and partly because a

today's students, unlike those of
the 1930'5, are confronted with
multiple choice of opportunity.
In the opinion of one observer,
the very richness and diversity
of opportunity produce a sense
of insecurity. What choice
should the student make? What
if the choice is wrong?
6. I mentioned a moment ago
the appeal which President Ken
nedy had for youth. For many
students, their response to this
appeal may be seen in their
participation in the Peace Corps,
in the Civil Rights movement
and in other less publicized en
terprizes by which they seek to
help the underprivileged. Such
participation is for them the
deed and not merely the word
of idealism.
Time For Idealism
Youth is peculiarly the time
for idealism and not infrequent
ly in this generation or others
this idealism is coupled with re
jectlon. The degree and depth
of this rejection are always
hard, if not impossible, to mea
sure. Today some students seem
to reject specialization—they
want to be the Renaissance and
some, presumably hope for a
part, and perhaps this number
is greater, reject the value-sys
tem of their parents and puzzle
themselves as to why this par
ticular rejection is not better
understood. Hence the so-called
generation-gap and, I suppose,
a part of the credibility gap.
There is, for some, rejection of

to conformity—conformity in
dress, in conventional manners,
and in such things as the am

self development or in greater
service to mankind than a com
mitment to learn, a commitment
to knowledge. And this is the
prime commitment which I
would urge you to make. The
basic purpose of the educational
review now under way, in which
important contributions are ex
pected from you, is to discover
better ways and opportunities
to acquire knowledge and to put
knowledge to work so that bet
ter ways may be found to solve
problems great and small which
beset society.
The whole purpose of knowl
edge is to liberate—to liberate

from ignorance, from perjudice,
and from obsolence. There is
much knowledge to be discov
ered; this, too, is a mission of
the university—and probably its
most exciting mission.
Two Observations
Let me conclude with two ob
servations and questions.
First: As you spend your un
dergraduate years, acquiring
knowledge in the classrooms, in
the library and laboratory, in
discussions among yourselves
and with others, by participat
ing in a variety of activities, in
seeking, as we all do, to discover
and refine a set of values by
which each of us can live a
happy and helpful life, please
ponder this question: What
value a criticism, a conviction
or a principle which is not based
on knowledge?
Second: The vital statistics of
this nation indicate that in a few
years half of our population will
be less than 30 years of age.
This prospect should be very en
couraging for those of you who
accept the cliche that no one
over thirty can be trusted. But
not for long after those under
30 will have constituted a ma
jority, you will join the minor
ity. Will you then be knowledge
able enough to be trustworthy?
I believe that you will, and
that knowledge and trustworthi
ness will mean much to Stan
ford tomorrow, as it does today.

ling's convocation address, de
livered yesterday In Memorial
Auditorium. The annual winter
convocation is sponsored by
Stanford Today and Tomorrow.)
Mr. Chairman, Ladies and
Gentlemen:
Once again I would extend my
compliments, my thanks and my
best wishes to the Stanford To
day and Tomorrow Committee.
The students with whom I first
discussed the possibility of an
S.T.&T. program more than a
decade ago thought that such a
program might serve a useful
purpose. I hope that it still does.
The major problems confront
ing universities do not change
radically from year to year. Ma
jor problems have a way of
persisting, even among shifts
of emphasis. But the spirit and
willingness to consider change
should always exist. Last year at
this Convocation I pointed out
that the university as an institu
tion has been going through a
period of critical review during
the past decade and more, and
that the range and intensity of
this review during the past
decade and more, and that the
range and intensity of this re
view have increase in recent
years. This review is by no
means confined to the United
States. It is happening in na
tions, new and old, around the
world. . . .
It is not surprising that under
the pressure of larger enroll
ments universities have grown
both in number and in size, and
that educational budgets have
Increased. Nor is it surprising
that participation in the solution
of social problems has both
stimulated and obliged univer
sities to re-examine curricula.
Still in the context of univer
sity, it is important to note that
education throughout the world
gets its major financial support
from public funds —in most coun
tries almost entirely so. In only
a few countries, such as Japan,
the Philippines and the United
States, is the private sector of
higher education noteworthy,
and it is mainly in the United
States that institutions in the
private sector rival in strength
and distinction those in the pub
lic sector.
The financial dependence of
universities upon public funds
invariably raises the specter of
possible political influence — a
specter which has recently ap
peared on local horizons. Politi
cal influence can be exercised in
a variety of ways. It is a func
tion of government to determine
priorities among national needs,
and there is ample evidence, in
old countries and now, that the
allocation of public funds to edu
cation can be influenced by these
priorities.
Those who are zealous to pre
serve the educational indepen
dence and self-determination of
the university should be alert to
risks and dangers involved in
ever allowing the university, as
university, to become a political
instrument or a pawn in the
hands of those who would use
it as such, be those hands in
side or out the university. . . .
Prosperity And Interest
During the past two decades
the United States has been pros
perous, and its general public
has manifest greater interest in
education at all levels. Education
has benefited from both the pros
perity and the interest. . . .
Stanford, like so many of her
sister institutions, has been in
many ways the beneficiary of
this support and interest. In con
sequence, there has been change.
Since 1950, the student body has
increased in size by approxi

mately 40 per cent; the regular
faculty by 170 per cent. The an
nual fiscal operation of the Uni
versity, exclusive of improve
ments and additions to physical
plant, has increased by a factor
of 10. The building program has
not kept pace with increase in
enrollment and faculty. There is
less academic space per student
today than there was 15 years
ago, although substantial gains
have been made during the past
three years and more are in
early prospect.
The University's endownment
has increased more than four
fold, yet the income from it pays
for a smaller fraction of an
nual operating costs than it did
in 1950. Tuition has increased
from $600 in 1950, but it too pays
a smaller fraction of operating
costs today than it did then. The
University currently depends on
gifts and grants to support
about 30 per cent of its annual
operating expenditures, and to
pay for new buildings and the
rehabilitation of old ones. And
given the understandable fact
that donors have their own pref
erences as to the use of their
gifts, it follows that their pref
erences do not always coincide
with what the University regards
as its most urgent needs. In
other words, the University's
priorities of need may be modi
fied by the designation of gifts.
Two Problems
Manifestly, the University has
to address itself to problems
growing out of this siuation. Let
me mention two. One of these
problems — one which I men
tioned last year—is that of size.
It is clear that, despite the gains
recently made, we still need
more academic space adequately
to accommodate our present
faculty afid student body. And
it would be my hope that we
could continue to make gains as
a high priority in the faculty
student ratio, thereby adding fur
ther flexibility and strength to
teaching and research. There is
pressing need to add to library
resources and, as tuition in
creases, to amplify student fi
nancial aid. If these needs are to
be met out of available and
anticipated resources, with the
objective of improvinb academic
quality, serious consideration
must be given to the size of the
student body, not least of all at
the graduate level.
Another problem, not unre
lated to size, is that of the resi
dence university. Stanford be
gan as essentially a residence
university, and the aspiration
to continue as such is woven into
a large part of its history. But
increase in student numbers, ad
ditional mobility provided by the
automobile, and the capital cost
of new residence halls have com
bined to produce a situation in
which Stanford is less a resi
dence university than it used to
be, and to raise the question as
to whether the aspiration to be
a residence university is viable.
I would also recall from the not
so-distant past the study of un
dergraduate education at Stan
ford which was made a decade
ago. That study was directed
mainly to the possibility and de
sirability of curricular change.
It resulted, among other things,
in the General Studies program;
it also led to the development of
the overseas campuses for un
dergraduates. It is during the de
cade since that study was made
that Stanford has experienced
its major increase in enrollment,
particularly at the graduate
level, and has approximately
doubled the size of its faculty.
It is also during that dec&de that
the academic potential of the
student body has notably in
creased.

So, as I think you know, an
other study is now under way.
Last autumn a small planning
committee, including the presi
dent of the study body and an
other student, recommended that
the new study be as compre
hensive as possible; that it in
clude consideration of both grad
uate and undergraduate educa
tion, both curricular and extra
curricular programs; and that it
search out opportunities for in
novation, flexibility and im
provement.
Another Study
An executive committee of
seven or eight persons will be
in charge of the study. Professor
Herbert Packer, recently ap
pointed Vice-Provost for Aca
demic Planning and Programs,
is Chairman of the committee.
The committee will utilize a va
riety of task forces or ad hoc
committees as needed, so that
many faculty, students and of
ficers of the University will be
involved.
It is anticipated that the study
will extend through most if not
all of the next academic year,
but this does not mean that the
Committee will recommend no
thing until the study is com
pleted; rather it is intended that
recommendations will flow from
the Committee throughout the
course of the study. For instance,
priority attention will be given
to the concept of the residence
university and the problsm
therein entailed, including the
"Off" issue, the value of such
projects as Grove House, the
roles of Tutors, Sponsors and
.Resident Associates. It is to be
expected, therefore, that during
the next eighteen months or so
this University community will
be broadly and actively engaged
in this new study and in con
sidertion of the recommenda
tions which it produces. And I
dare say that one of the major
eventual considerations will be
this: How can educational re
view and improvement be, so to
speak, institutionalized and
thereby eliminate periodic and,
in Professor Parker's phrase,
"somewhat convulsive" attacks
on the problem.
University Government
If this is to be achieved, at
tention must be directed to Uni
versity government. This subject
needs attention for other reasons
as well, including that of size.
I have been interested to note
in the professional journals on
higher education that this sub
ject of university government
has had increasing attention dur
ing the past three or four years.
This has come about, as I read
the journals, in part because of
size—as student enrollments and
faculty have increased in num
ber—and in part because the
need for educational review and
'change calls for mechanisms
which will make possible knowl
edgeable discussion and delibera
tion of educational programs in
terms of the resources available
to support them.
University government stems
from the Charter, the legisaltive
statute or the constitutional pro
vision by which a given institu
tion was established. These char
ters or statutes vest authority
and responsibility in Boards of
Trustees, Regents or Governors.
From these Boards, subordinate
authority and responsibilities are
delegate to faculty, students and
officers of the institution. This is
the established pattern and I do
not anticipate that there will be
basic change in it at least at an
early date.
New Mechanisms
But it is not of this pattern
which I speak when I suggest
the need for new mechanisms,
because there is opportunity for

new mechanisms within the pat
tern. For instance, the Board of
Trustees of this University has
a Committee of its membership
presently engaged in a study of
the Board's composition and or
ganization. The objective is to
make more effective use of the
very considerable time which
Trustees devote to Stanford af
fairs, and thereby to keep them
still more closely in touch with
the academic programs and
needs of the University.
As Trustee organization is be
ing considered, so too might the
organization of the faculty and
of the student body benefit from
re-examination. Given the size
of the faculty and of the student
body respectively, it is unlikely
that the total membership of
each can be effectively and reg
ularly engaged in deliberations
on educational pr ogram and pol
icy.
For the faculty, this invites
the possibility of electing a rep
resentative body small enough
for constructive discussion and
large enough to give adequate
voice to the seven Schools. For
the students, it invites consider
ation of the reorganization of
student government if the pres
ent organization is judged to be
lacking in representation or per
formance. For all segments of
the University, it invites critical
attention to the invention of
mechanisms which will improve
collaborative effort to advance
the University by orderly pro
cedures.
It would seem to me that the
educational review now under
way would be incomplete if it
did not direct attention to the
subject of university govern
ment.
Suggestions
Before each of these Convo
cations I have asked students
to suggest topics which I might
discuss. The suggestion which
heads the list this year is this:
How can a student best spend
his undergraduate years?"
This question is by no means
new. I suspect that teachers and
counsellors have been hearing
that question for generations. I
suspect also that answers vary
from generation to generation,
and that they vary also within
any student generation as each
student seeks counsel for him
self and his individual concerns.
In the depressed 1930'5, for in
stance, at the surface of concern
for most students was how to
muster the financial where
withal to stay in school, and
the question of whether they
could get a job upon graduation.
They had some preoccupation
with economic security. Their
interest in public affairs was, as
I recall, directed to two main
considerations: One related di
rectly to the depression and led
to the question whether democ
racy could cope with the ten
sions, the dislocations and the
despair which the depression
produced, or whether some
other form of government could
cope more adequately with such
problems. . . .
The G.l.'s
Before the 1930's had passed
into history, much of the world
was at war. When it was over,
tens of thousands of Gl's re
sumed their education. They
had lost time. They were pre
occupied with catching up. They
were good students, eager to
learn, eager to complete college
and to begin a career and a fam
ily. This mood persisted into
the early 1950'5. There had not
been time for the mood to
change much between the con
clusion of World War II and the
outbreak of hostilities in Korea.
And the early 1950's included

also the sinister and unforget
able episode of McCarthyism.
These years did not include
anything but the beginnings of
the Civil Rights movement begin
ings which were dramatized by
the spotlight on schools in Little
Rock, Arkansas. And, with all
due respect, the then President
of the United States did not
have the appeal to youth that
he had to older generations—
certainly not the appeal to
youth which emanated from
John Fitzgerald Kennedy. So
the students of the 1950's came
to be regarded as the "silent
generation," and perhaps under
standably so.
Thus, at different times and in
different contexts students have
asked the question: How best
can a student spend his under
graduate years?
Students In the 'AO's
What of the context in which
the students of the 1960's ask
this question? I have no expert
diagnosis, nor do I know of any,
that is unassailable. Nor do I
know of any generalization
which applies precisely to any
individual student. But let me
invite your consideration of a
few observations.
1. Not one of today's students
has personally experienced a
major depression or its conse
quences.
2. Very few of today's stu
dents have had direct experience
in war. And none has had ex
perience in a war, such as World
War 11, in which the motivation
to serve was so broadly and na
tionally based. The war they
know is undeclared and far
away; it implements a national
policy which they and others
question and is administered by
a government which does not
command their full confidence.
3. The student generation of
the late 1950's and the 1960's is
the first to live under the threat
of nuclear war. I cannot mea
sure the impact of that threat,
but I should judge from conver
sations with many students that
many of you are affected by it.
Greater Pressure
4. Today's students have been
subjected to greater pressures
than their predecessors for get
ting into the college of their
choice—pressures which derive
in part from the great increase
in national enrollment. They
have felt these pressures since
age 14 or 15, and find, in col
lege, that these pressures con
tinue for those who, in increas
ing numbers, plan to go on to
graduate and professional
schools.
5. Partly because our society
is affluent and partly because a
burst of new knowledge has in
vited greater specialization, to
today's students, unlike those of
the 1930'5, are confronted with
multiple choice of opportunity.
In the opinion of one observer,
the very richness and diversity
of opportunity produce a sense
of insecurity. What choice
should the student make? What
if the choice is wrong?
6. I mentioned a moment ago
the appeal which President Ken
nedy had for youth. For many
students, their response to this
appeal may be seen in their
participation in the Peace Corps,
in the Civil Rights movement
and in other less publicized en
terprizes by which they seek to
help the underprivileged. Such
participation is for them the
deed and not merely the word
of idealism.
Time For Idealism
Youth is peculiarly the time
for idealism and not infrequent
ly in this generation or others
this idealism is coupled with re
jectlon. The degree and depth
of this rejection are always
hard, if not impossible, to mea
sure. Today some students seem
to reject specialization—they
want to be the Renaissance and
some, presumably hope for a
part, and perhaps this number
is greater, reject the value-sys
tem of their parents and puzzle
themselves as to why this par
ticular rejection is not better
understood. Hence the so-called
generation-gap and, I suppose,
a part of the credibility gap.
There is, for some, rejection of
what they regard as slavishness
to conformity—conformity in
dress, in conventional manners,
and in such things as the am
bition to have a house in the
suburbs, a two-car family and
a colored televsiion within easy
reach.
I dare say that these observa
tions do not embrace the whole
context out of which today's
students ask the question, "How
best can I spend my undergrad
uate years?" But I suggest that
they are significant parts of the
whole, The context in which the
question is asked varies with
time and circumstance, but the
question itself is a hardy per
ennial.
Partial Answer
Part of the answer lies within
cach of you. You know better
than anyone else why you came

to college. I take it that you
wanted to do so, that few, if
any, of you came against your
will and only in response to
some parental or other pres
sure. And you should know bet
ter than anyone else why you
wanted to come. I should as
sume that the basic reason was,
of course, to continue your edu
cation. The opportunity to do so
in a new environment away
from home was probably not
unappealing to you. The pros
pect of enjoying a kind of new
freedom had its attractions as
well as anxieties. Many, if not
most, of you thought of college
as a natural, even necessary,
next step in preparation for a
career. I doubt that you thought
of college and a baccalaureate
degree simply as a status sym
bol. How consciously you looked
forward to college as an experi
ence in self development I don't
know, but it was probably some
where in your stream of con
sciousness. In any event, you
should know better than any
one else why you wanted to
come to college.
How aware were you when
you came that knowledge is the
most powerful of all human re
sources, that there is more
knowledge today than ever be
fore, and that its rate of accum
ulation continues to accelerate.
Since knowledge is the most im
portant commodity a college or

university has to offer, it fol
lows that a student's major op
portunity is to absorb and col
late as much of it as possible so
that he may harness and hitch
it and put it to work. . .
Commitment
There is a word in our vocabu
lary which I hear many of you
use with considerable frequency.
It is the word "commitment."
As I hear you use the word, it
is most frequently associated
with a sense of urgency to im
prove society, including the Uni
versity. I delight in this, even
though my delight is sometimes
punctuated with problems. I de
light in it because it bespeaks
a concern about the welfare of
mankind and a desire to be of
service I know of no commit
ment which can result in better
self development or in greater
service to mankind than a com
mitment to learn, a commitment
to knowledge. And this is the
prime commitment which I
would urge you to make. The
basic purpose of the educational
review now under way, in which
important contributions are ex
pected from you, is to discover
better ways and opportunities
to acquire knowledge and to put
knowledge to work so that bet
ter ways may be found to solve
problems great and small which
beset society.
The whole purpose of knowl
edge is to liberate—to liberate

from ignorance, from perjudice,
and from obsolence. There is
much knowledge to be discov
ered; this, too, is a mission of
the university—and probably its
most exciting mission.
Two Observations
Let me conclude with two ob
servations and questions.
First: As you spend your un
dergraduate years, acquiring
knowledge in the classrooms, in
the library and laboratory, in
discussions among yourselves
and with others, by participat
ing in a variety of activities, in
seeking, as we all do, to discover
and refine a set of values by
which each of us can live a
happy and helpful life, please
ponder this question: What
value a criticism, a conviction
or a principle which is not based
on knowledge?
Second: The vital statistics of
this nation indicate that in a few
years half of our population will
be less than 30 years of age.
This prospect should be very en
couraging for those of you who
accept the cliche that no one
over thirty can be trusted. But
not for long after those under
30 will have constituted a ma
jority, you will join the minor
ity. Will you then be knowledge
able enough to be trustworthy?
I believe that you will, and
that knowledge and trustworthi
ness will mean much to Stan
ford tomorrow, as it does today.

Mr. Chairman, Ladies and
Gentlemen:
Once again I would extend my
compliments, my thanks and my
best wishes to the Stanford To
day and Tomorrow Committee.
The students with whom I first
discussed the possibility of an
S.T.&T. program more than a
decade ago thought that such a
program might serve a useful
purpose. I hope that it still does.
The major problems confront
ing universities do not change
radically from year to year. Ma
jor problems have a way of
persisting, even among shifts
of emphasis. But the spirit and
willingness to consider change
should always exist. Last year at
this Convocation I pointed out
that the university as an institu
tion has been going through a
period of critical review during
the past decade and more, and
that the range and intensity of
this review during the past
decade and more, and that the
range and intensity of this re
view have increase in recent
years. This review is by no
means confined to the United
States. It is happening in na
tions, new and old, around the
world. . . .
It is not surprising that under
the pressure of larger enroll
ments universities have grown
both in number and in size, and
that educational budgets have
Increased. Nor is it surprising
that participation in the solution
of social problems has both
stimulated and obliged univer
sities to re-examine curricula.
Still in the context of univer
sity, it is important to note that
education throughout the world
gets its major financial support
from public funds —in most coun
tries almost entirely so. In only
a few countries, such as Japan,
the Philippines and the United
States, is the private sector of
higher education noteworthy,
and it is mainly in the United
States that institutions in the
private sector rival in strength
and distinction those in the pub
lic sector.
The financial dependence of
universities upon public funds
invariably raises the specter of
possible political influence — a
specter which has recently ap
peared on local horizons. Politi
cal influence can be exercised in
a variety of ways. It is a func

priorities among national needs,
and there is ample evidence, in
old countries and now, that the
allocation of public funds to edu

priorities.
Those who are zealous to pre

the university should be alert to
risks and dangers involved in
ever allowing the university, as

Prosperity And Interest
During the past two decades
the United States has been pros
perous, and its general public
has manifest greater interest in
education at all levels. Education
has benefited from both the pros
perity and the interest. . . .
Stanford, like so many of her
sister institutions, has been in
many ways the beneficiary of
this support and interest. In con
sequence, there has been change.
Since 1950, the student body has
increased in size by approxi

mately 40 per cent; the regular
faculty by 170 per cent. The an
nual fiscal operation of the Uni
versity, exclusive of improve
ments and additions to physical
plant, has increased by a factor
of 10. The building program has
not kept pace with increase in
enrollment and faculty. There is
less academic space per student
today than there was 15 years
ago, although substantial gains
have been made during the past
three years and more are in
early prospect.
The University's endownment
has increased more than four
fold, yet the income from it pays
for a smaller fraction of an
nual operating costs than it did
in 1950. Tuition has increased
from $600 in 1950, but it too pays
a smaller fraction of operating
costs today than it did then. The
University currently depends on
gifts and grants to support
about 30 per cent of its annual
operating expenditures, and to
pay for new buildings and the
rehabilitation of old ones. And
given the understandable fact
that donors have their own pref
erences as to the use of their
gifts, it follows that their pref
erences do not always coincide
with what the University regards
as its most urgent needs. In
other words, the University's
priorities of need may be modi
fied by the designation of gifts.
Two Problems
Manifestly, the University has
to address itself to problems
growing out of this siuation. Let
me mention two. One of these
problems — one which I men
tioned last year—is that of size.
It is clear that, despite the gains
recently made, we still need
more academic space adequately
to accommodate our present
faculty afid student body. And
it would be my hope that we
could continue to make gains as
a high priority in the faculty
student ratio, thereby adding fur
ther flexibility and strength to
teaching and research. There is
pressing need to add to library
resources and, as tuition in
creases, to amplify student fi
nancial aid. If these needs are to
be met out of available and
anticipated resources, with the
objective of improvinb academic
quality, serious consideration
must be given to the size of the
student body, not least of all at
the graduate level.
Another problem, not unre
lated to size, is that of the resi
dence university. Stanford be
gan as essentially a residence
university, and the aspiration
to continue as such is woven into
a large part of its history. But
increase in student numbers, ad
ditional mobility provided by the
automobile, and the capital cost
of new residence halls have com
bined to produce a situation in
which Stanford is less a resi
dence university than it used to
be, and to raise the question as
to whether the aspiration to be
a residence university is viable.
I would also recall from the not
so-distant past the study of un
dergraduate education at Stan

mainly to the possibility and de
sirability of curricular change.
It resulted, among other things,

it also led to the development of
the overseas campuses for un

that Stanford has experienced
its major increase in enrollment,
particularly at the graduate
level, and has approximately
doubled the size of its faculty.
It is also during that dec&de that
the academic potential of the
student body has notably in

So, as I think you know, an
other study is now under way.
Last autumn a small planning

Another Study
An executive committee of
seven or eight persons will be
in charge of the study. Professor
Herbert Packer, recently ap

is Chairman of the committee.
The committee will utilize a va
riety of task forces or ad hoc
committees as needed, so that
many faculty, students and of
ficers of the University will be
involved.
It is anticipated that the study
will extend through most if not
all of the next academic year,
but this does not mean that the
Committee will recommend no
thing until the study is com
pleted; rather it is intended that
recommendations will flow from
the Committee throughout the
course of the study. For instance,
priority attention will be given
to the concept of the residence
university and the problsm
therein entailed, including the
"Off" issue, the value of such
projects as Grove House, the
roles of Tutors, Sponsors and
.Resident Associates. It is to be
expected, therefore, that during
the next eighteen months or so
this University community will
be broadly and actively engaged
in this new study and in con
sidertion of the recommenda
tions which it produces. And I
dare say that one of the major
eventual considerations will be
this: How can educational re
view and improvement be, so to
speak, institutionalized and
thereby eliminate periodic and,
in Professor Parker's phrase,
"somewhat convulsive" attacks
on the problem.
University Government
If this is to be achieved, at
tention must be directed to Uni
versity government. This subject
needs attention for other reasons
as well, including that of size.
I have been interested to note
in the professional journals on
higher education that this sub
ject of university government
has had increasing attention dur
ing the past three or four years.
This has come about, as I read
the journals, in part because of
size—as student enrollments and
faculty have increased in num
ber—and in part because the
need for educational review and
'change calls for mechanisms
which will make possible knowl
edgeable discussion and delibera
tion of educational programs in
terms of the resources available
to support them.
University government stems
from the Charter, the legisaltive
statute or the constitutional pro
vision by which a given institu
tion was established. These char
ters or statutes vest authority
and responsibility in Boards of
Trustees, Regents or Governors.
From these Boards, subordinate
authority and responsibilities are
delegate to faculty, students and
officers of the institution. This is
the established pattern and I do
not anticipate that there will be
basic change in it at least at an
early date.
New Mechanisms
But it is not of this pattern
which I speak when I suggest
the need for new mechanisms,
because there is opportunity for

new mechanisms within the pat
tern. For instance, the Board of
Trustees of this University has
a Committee of its membership
presently engaged in a study of
the Board's composition and or
ganization. The objective is to
make more effective use of the
very considerable time which
Trustees devote to Stanford af
fairs, and thereby to keep them
still more closely in touch with
the academic programs and
needs of the University.
As Trustee organization is be
ing considered, so too might the
organization of the faculty and
of the student body benefit from
re-examination. Given the size
of the faculty and of the student
body respectively, it is unlikely
that the total membership of
each can be effectively and reg
ularly engaged in deliberations
on educational pr ogram and pol
icy.
For the faculty, this invites
the possibility of electing a rep
resentative body small enough
for constructive discussion and
large enough to give adequate
voice to the seven Schools. For
the students, it invites consider
ation of the reorganization of
student government if the pres
ent organization is judged to be
lacking in representation or per
formance. For all segments of
the University, it invites critical
attention to the invention of
mechanisms which will improve
collaborative effort to advance
the University by orderly pro
cedures.
It would seem to me that the
educational review now under
way would be incomplete if it
did not direct attention to the
subject of university govern
ment.
Suggestions
Before each of these Convo
cations I have asked students
to suggest topics which I might
discuss. The suggestion which
heads the list this year is this:
How can a student best spend
his undergraduate years?"
This question is by no means
new. I suspect that teachers and
counsellors have been hearing
that question for generations. I
suspect also that answers vary
from generation to generation,
and that they vary also within
any student generation as each
student seeks counsel for him
self and his individual concerns.
In the depressed 1930'5, for in
stance, at the surface of concern
for most students was how to
muster the financial where
withal to stay in school, and
the question of whether they
could get a job upon graduation.
They had some preoccupation
with economic security. Their
interest in public affairs was, as
I recall, directed to two main
considerations: One related di
rectly to the depression and led
to the question whether democ
racy could cope with the ten
sions, the dislocations and the
despair which the depression
produced, or whether some
other form of government could
cope more adequately with such
problems. . . .
The G.l.'s
Before the 1930's had passed
into history, much of the world
was at war. When it was over,
tens of thousands of Gl's re
sumed their education. They
had lost time. They were pre
occupied with catching up. They
were good students, eager to
learn, eager to complete college
and to begin a career and a fam
ily. This mood persisted into
the early 1950'5. There had not
been time for the mood to
change much between the con
clusion of World War II and the
outbreak of hostilities in Korea.
And the early 1950's included

also the sinister and unforget
able episode of McCarthyism.
These years did not include
anything but the beginnings of
the Civil Rights movement begin
ings which were dramatized by
the spotlight on schools in Little
Rock, Arkansas. And, with all
due respect, the then President
of the United States did not
have the appeal to youth that
he had to older generations—
certainly not the appeal to
youth which emanated from
John Fitzgerald Kennedy. So
the students of the 1950's came
to be regarded as the "silent
generation," and perhaps under
standably so.
Thus, at different times and in
different contexts students have
asked the question: How best
can a student spend his under
graduate years?
Students In the 'AO's
What of the context in which
the students of the 1960's ask
this question? I have no expert
diagnosis, nor do I know of any,
that is unassailable. Nor do I
know of any generalization
which applies precisely to any
individual student. But let me
invite your consideration of a
few observations.
1. Not one of today's students
has personally experienced a
major depression or its conse
quences.
2. Very few of today's stu
dents have had direct experience
in war. And none has had ex
perience in a war, such as World
War 11, in which the motivation
to serve was so broadly and na
tionally based. The war they
know is undeclared and far
away; it implements a national
policy which they and others
question and is administered by
a government which does not
command their full confidence.
3. The student generation of
the late 1950's and the 1960's is
the first to live under the threat
of nuclear war. I cannot mea
sure the impact of that threat,
but I should judge from conver
sations with many students that
many of you are affected by it.
Greater Pressure
4. Today's students have been
subjected to greater pressures
than their predecessors for get
ting into the college of their
choice—pressures which derive
in part from the great increase
in national enrollment. They
have felt these pressures since
age 14 or 15, and find, in col
lege, that these pressures con
tinue for those who, in increas
ing numbers, plan to go on to
graduate and professional
schools.
5. Partly because our society
is affluent and partly because a
burst of new knowledge has in
vited greater specialization, to
today's students, unlike those of
the 1930'5, are confronted with
multiple choice of opportunity.
In the opinion of one observer,
the very richness and diversity
of opportunity produce a sense
of insecurity. What choice
should the student make? What
if the choice is wrong?
6. I mentioned a moment ago
the appeal which President Ken
nedy had for youth. For many
students, their response to this
appeal may be seen in their
participation in the Peace Corps,
in the Civil Rights movement
and in other less publicized en
terprizes by which they seek to
help the underprivileged. Such
participation is for them the
deed and not merely the word
of idealism.
Time For Idealism
Youth is peculiarly the time
for idealism and not infrequent
ly in this generation or others
this idealism is coupled with re
jectlon. The degree and depth
of this rejection are always
hard, if not impossible, to mea
sure. Today some students seem
to reject specialization—they
want to be the Renaissance and
some, presumably hope for a
part, and perhaps this number
is greater, reject the value-sys
tem of their parents and puzzle
themselves as to why this par
ticular rejection is not better
understood. Hence the so-called
generation-gap and, I suppose,
a part of the credibility gap.
There is, for some, rejection of
what they regard as slavishness
to conformity—conformity in
dress, in conventional manners,
and in such things as the am
bition to have a house in the
suburbs, a two-car family and
a colored televsiion within easy
reach.
I dare say that these observa
tions do not embrace the whole
context out of which today's
students ask the question, "How
best can I spend my undergrad
uate years?" But I suggest that
they are significant parts of the
whole, The context in which the
question is asked varies with
time and circumstance, but the
question itself is a hardy per
ennial.
Partial Answer
Part of the answer lies within
cach of you. You know better
than anyone else why you came

to college. I take it that you
wanted to do so, that few, if
any, of you came against your
will and only in response to
some parental or other pres
sure. And you should know bet
ter than anyone else why you
wanted to come. I should as
sume that the basic reason was,
of course, to continue your edu
cation. The opportunity to do so
in a new environment away
from home was probably not
unappealing to you. The pros
pect of enjoying a kind of new
freedom had its attractions as
well as anxieties. Many, if not
most, of you thought of college
as a natural, even necessary,
next step in preparation for a
career. I doubt that you thought
of college and a baccalaureate
degree simply as a status sym
bol. How consciously you looked
forward to college as an experi
ence in self development I don't
know, but it was probably some
where in your stream of con
sciousness. In any event, you
should know better than any
one else why you wanted to
come to college.
How aware were you when
you came that knowledge is the
most powerful of all human re
sources, that there is more
knowledge today than ever be
fore, and that its rate of accum
ulation continues to accelerate.
Since knowledge is the most im
portant commodity a college or

university has to offer, it fol
lows that a student's major op
portunity is to absorb and col
late as much of it as possible so
that he may harness and hitch
it and put it to work. . .
Commitment
There is a word in our vocabu
lary which I hear many of you
use with considerable frequency.
It is the word "commitment."
As I hear you use the word, it
is most frequently associated
with a sense of urgency to im
prove society, including the Uni
versity. I delight in this, even
though my delight is sometimes
punctuated with problems. I de
light in it because it bespeaks
a concern about the welfare of
mankind and a desire to be of
service I know of no commit
ment which can result in better
self development or in greater
service to mankind than a com
mitment to learn, a commitment
to knowledge. And this is the
prime commitment which I
would urge you to make. The
basic purpose of the educational
review now under way, in which
important contributions are ex
pected from you, is to discover
better ways and opportunities
to acquire knowledge and to put
knowledge to work so that bet
ter ways may be found to solve
problems great and small which
beset society.
The whole purpose of knowl
edge is to liberate—to liberate

from ignorance, from perjudice,
and from obsolence. There is
much knowledge to be discov
ered; this, too, is a mission of
the university—and probably its
most exciting mission.
Two Observations
Let me conclude with two ob
servations and questions.
First: As you spend your un
dergraduate years, acquiring
knowledge in the classrooms, in
the library and laboratory, in
discussions among yourselves
and with others, by participat
ing in a variety of activities, in
seeking, as we all do, to discover
and refine a set of values by
which each of us can live a
happy and helpful life, please
ponder this question: What
value a criticism, a conviction
or a principle which is not based
on knowledge?
Second: The vital statistics of
this nation indicate that in a few
years half of our population will
be less than 30 years of age.
This prospect should be very en
couraging for those of you who
accept the cliche that no one
over thirty can be trusted. But
not for long after those under
30 will have constituted a ma
jority, you will join the minor
ity. Will you then be knowledge
able enough to be trustworthy?
I believe that you will, and
that knowledge and trustworthi
ness will mean much to Stan
ford tomorrow, as it does today.
(Editor's Note: The following
are excerpts from President Ster
ling's convocation address, de
livered yesterday In Memorial
Auditorium. The annual winter
convocation is sponsored by
Stanford Today and Tomorrow.)
Mr. Chairman, Ladies and
Gentlemen:
Once again I would extend my
compliments, my thanks and my
best wishes to the Stanford To
day and Tomorrow Committee.
The students with whom I first
discussed the possibility of an
S.T.&T. program more than a
decade ago thought that such a
program might serve a useful
purpose. I hope that it still does.
The major problems confront
ing universities do not change
radically from year to year. Ma
jor problems have a way of
persisting, even among shifts
of emphasis. But the spirit and
willingness to consider change
should always exist. Last year at
this Convocation I pointed out
that the university as an institu
tion has been going through a
period of critical review during
the past decade and more, and
that the range and intensity of
this review during the past
decade and more, and that the
range and intensity of this re
view have increase in recent
years. This review is by no
means confined to the United
States. It is happening in na
tions, new and old, around the
world. . . .
It is not surprising that under
the pressure of larger enroll
ments universities have grown
both in number and in size, and
that educational budgets have
Increased. Nor is it surprising
that participation in the solution
of social problems has both
stimulated and obliged univer
sities to re-examine curricula.
Still in the context of univer
sity, it is important to note that
education throughout the world
gets its major financial support
from public funds —in most coun
tries almost entirely so. In only
a few countries, such as Japan,
the Philippines and the United
States, is the private sector of
higher education noteworthy,
and it is mainly in the United
States that institutions in the
private sector rival in strength
and distinction those in the pub
lic sector.
The financial dependence of
universities upon public funds
invariably raises the specter of
possible political influence — a
specter which has recently ap
peared on local horizons. Politi
cal influence can be exercised in
a variety of ways. It is a func
tion of government to determine
priorities among national needs,
and there is ample evidence, in
old countries and now, that the
allocation of public funds to edu
cation can be influenced by these
priorities.
Those who are zealous to pre
serve the educational indepen
dence and self-determination of
the university should be alert to
risks and dangers involved in
ever allowing the university, as
university, to become a political
instrument or a pawn in the
hands of those who would use
it as such, be those hands in
side or out the university. . . .
Prosperity And Interest
During the past two decades
the United States has been pros
perous, and its general public
has manifest greater interest in
education at all levels. Education
has benefited from both the pros
perity and the interest. . . .
Stanford, like so many of her
sister institutions, has been in
many ways the beneficiary of
this support and interest. In con
sequence, there has been change.
Since 1950, the student body has
increased in size by approxi

mately 40 per cent; the regular
faculty by 170 per cent. The an
nual fiscal operation of the Uni
versity, exclusive of improve
ments and additions to physical
plant, has increased by a factor
of 10. The building program has
not kept pace with increase in
enrollment and faculty. There is
less academic space per student
today than there was 15 years
ago, although substantial gains
have been made during the past
three years and more are in
early prospect.
The University's endownment
has increased more than four
fold, yet the income from it pays
for a smaller fraction of an
nual operating costs than it did
in 1950. Tuition has increased
from $600 in 1950, but it too pays
a smaller fraction of operating
costs today than it did then. The
University currently depends on
gifts and grants to support
about 30 per cent of its annual
operating expenditures, and to
pay for new buildings and the
rehabilitation of old ones. And
given the understandable fact
that donors have their own pref
erences as to the use of their
gifts, it follows that their pref
erences do not always coincide
with what the University regards
as its most urgent needs. In
other words, the University's
priorities of need may be modi
fied by the designation of gifts.
Two Problems
Manifestly, the University has
to address itself to problems
growing out of this siuation. Let
me mention two. One of these
problems — one which I men
tioned last year—is that of size.
It is clear that, despite the gains
recently made, we still need
more academic space adequately
to accommodate our present
faculty afid student body. And
it would be my hope that we
could continue to make gains as
a high priority in the faculty
student ratio, thereby adding fur
ther flexibility and strength to
teaching and research. There is
pressing need to add to library
resources and, as tuition in
creases, to amplify student fi
nancial aid. If these needs are to
be met out of available and
anticipated resources, with the
objective of improvinb academic
quality, serious consideration
must be given to the size of the
student body, not least of all at
the graduate level.
Another problem, not unre
lated to size, is that of the resi
dence university. Stanford be
gan as essentially a residence
university, and the aspiration
to continue as such is woven into
a large part of its history. But
increase in student numbers, ad
ditional mobility provided by the
automobile, and the capital cost
of new residence halls have com
bined to produce a situation in
which Stanford is less a resi
dence university than it used to
be, and to raise the question as
to whether the aspiration to be
a residence university is viable.
I would also recall from the not
so-distant past the study of un
dergraduate education at Stan
ford which was made a decade
ago. That study was directed
mainly to the possibility and de
sirability of curricular change.
It resulted, among other things,
in the General Studies program;
it also led to the development of
the overseas campuses for un
dergraduates. It is during the de
cade since that study was made
that Stanford has experienced
its major increase in enrollment,
particularly at the graduate
level, and has approximately
doubled the size of its faculty.
It is also during that dec&de that
the academic potential of the
student body has notably in
creased.

So, as I think you know, an
other study is now under way.
Last autumn a small planning
committee, including the presi
dent of the study body and an
other student, recommended that
the new study be as compre
hensive as possible; that it in
clude consideration of both grad
uate and undergraduate educa
tion, both curricular and extra
curricular programs; and that it
search out opportunities for in
novation, flexibility and im
provement.
Another Study
An executive committee of
seven or eight persons will be
in charge of the study. Professor
Herbert Packer, recently ap
pointed Vice-Provost for Aca
demic Planning and Programs,
is Chairman of the committee.
The committee will utilize a va
riety of task forces or ad hoc
committees as needed, so that
many faculty, students and of
ficers of the University will be
involved.
It is anticipated that the study
will extend through most if not
all of the next academic year,
but this does not mean that the
Committee will recommend no
thing until the study is com
pleted; rather it is intended that
recommendations will flow from
the Committee throughout the
course of the study. For instance,
priority attention will be given
to the concept of the residence
university and the problsm
therein entailed, including the
"Off" issue, the value of such
projects as Grove House, the
roles of Tutors, Sponsors and
.Resident Associates. It is to be
expected, therefore, that during
the next eighteen months or so
this University community will
be broadly and actively engaged
in this new study and in con
sidertion of the recommenda
tions which it produces. And I
dare say that one of the major
eventual considerations will be
this: How can educational re
view and improvement be, so to
speak, institutionalized and
thereby eliminate periodic and,
in Professor Parker's phrase,
"somewhat convulsive" attacks
on the problem.
University Government
If this is to be achieved, at
tention must be directed to Uni
versity government. This subject
needs attention for other reasons
as well, including that of size.
I have been interested to note
in the professional journals on
higher education that this sub
ject of university government
has had increasing attention dur
ing the past three or four years.
This has come about, as I read
the journals, in part because of
size—as student enrollments and
faculty have increased in num
ber—and in part because the
need for educational review and
'change calls for mechanisms
which will make possible knowl
edgeable discussion and delibera
tion of educational programs in
terms of the resources available
to support them.
University government stems
from the Charter, the legisaltive
statute or the constitutional pro
vision by which a given institu
tion was established. These char
ters or statutes vest authority
and responsibility in Boards of
Trustees, Regents or Governors.
From these Boards, subordinate
authority and responsibilities are
delegate to faculty, students and
officers of the institution. This is
the established pattern and I do
not anticipate that there will be
basic change in it at least at an
early date.
New Mechanisms
But it is not of this pattern
which I speak when I suggest
the need for new mechanisms,
because there is opportunity for

new mechanisms within the pat
tern. For instance, the Board of
Trustees of this University has
a Committee of its membership
presently engaged in a study of
the Board's composition and or
ganization. The objective is to
make more effective use of the
very considerable time which
Trustees devote to Stanford af
fairs, and thereby to keep them
still more closely in touch with
the academic programs and
needs of the University.
As Trustee organization is be
ing considered, so too might the
organization of the faculty and
of the student body benefit from
re-examination. Given the size
of the faculty and of the student
body respectively, it is unlikely
that the total membership of
each can be effectively and reg
ularly engaged in deliberations
on educational pr ogram and pol
icy.
For the faculty, this invites
the possibility of electing a rep
resentative body small enough
for constructive discussion and
large enough to give adequate
voice to the seven Schools. For
the students, it invites consider
ation of the reorganization of
student government if the pres
ent organization is judged to be
lacking in representation or per
formance. For all segments of
the University, it invites critical
attention to the invention of
mechanisms which will improve
collaborative effort to advance
the University by orderly pro
cedures.
It would seem to me that the
educational review now under
way would be incomplete if it
did not direct attention to the
subject of university govern
ment.
Suggestions
Before each of these Convo
cations I have asked students
to suggest topics which I might
discuss. The suggestion which
heads the list this year is this:
How can a student best spend
his undergraduate years?"
This question is by no means
new. I suspect that teachers and
counsellors have been hearing
that question for generations. I
suspect also that answers vary
from generation to generation,
and that they vary also within
any student generation as each
student seeks counsel for him
self and his individual concerns.
In the depressed 1930'5, for in
stance, at the surface of concern
for most students was how to
muster the financial where
withal to stay in school, and
the question of whether they
could get a job upon graduation.
They had some preoccupation
with economic security. Their
interest in public affairs was, as
I recall, directed to two main
considerations: One related di
rectly to the depression and led
to the question whether democ
racy could cope with the ten
sions, the dislocations and the
despair which the depression
produced, or whether some
other form of government could
cope more adequately with such
problems. . . .
The G.l.'s
Before the 1930's had passed
into history, much of the world
was at war. When it was over,
tens of thousands of Gl's re
sumed their education. They
had lost time. They were pre
occupied with catching up. They
were good students, eager to

and to begin a career and a fam
ily. This mood persisted into
the early 1950'5. There had not
been time for the mood to
change much between the con
clusion of World War II and the
outbreak of hostilities in Korea.
And the early 1950's included

also the sinister and unforget
able episode of McCarthyism.
These years did not include
anything but the beginnings of
the Civil Rights movement begin
ings which were dramatized by
the spotlight on schools in Little

certainly not the appeal to

the students of the 1950's came
to be regarded as the "silent

standably so.
Thus, at different times and in
different contexts students have
asked the question: How best
can a student spend his under
graduate years?
Students In the 'AO's
What of the context in which
the students of the 1960's ask
this question? I have no expert
diagnosis, nor do I know of any,
that is unassailable. Nor do I
know of any generalization
which applies precisely to any
individual student. But let me
invite your consideration of a
few observations.
1. Not one of today's students
has personally experienced a
major depression or its conse
quences.
2. Very few of today's stu
dents have had direct experience
in war. And none has had ex
perience in a war, such as World
War 11, in which the motivation
to serve was so broadly and na
tionally based. The war they

a government which does not
command their full confidence.
3. The student generation of
the late 1950's and the 1960's is
the first to live under the threat
of nuclear war. I cannot mea
sure the impact of that threat,
but I should judge from conver
sations with many students that
many of you are affected by it.
Greater Pressure
4. Today's students have been
subjected to greater pressures
than their predecessors for get
ting into the college of their
choice—pressures which derive
in part from the great increase
in national enrollment. They
have felt these pressures since
age 14 or 15, and find, in col
lege, that these pressures con
tinue for those who, in increas
ing numbers, plan to go on to
graduate and professional
schools.
5. Partly because our society
is affluent and partly because a
burst of new knowledge has in
vited greater specialization, to
today's students, unlike those of
the 1930'5, are confronted with
multiple choice of opportunity.
In the opinion of one observer,
the very richness and diversity
of opportunity produce a sense
of insecurity. What choice
should the student make? What
if the choice is wrong?
6. I mentioned a moment ago
the appeal which President Ken
nedy had for youth. For many
students, their response to this
appeal may be seen in their
participation in the Peace Corps,
in the Civil Rights movement
and in other less publicized en
terprizes by which they seek to
help the underprivileged. Such
participation is for them the
deed and not merely the word
of idealism.
Time For Idealism
Youth is peculiarly the time
for idealism and not infrequent
ly in this generation or others
this idealism is coupled with re
jectlon. The degree and depth
of this rejection are always
hard, if not impossible, to mea
sure. Today some students seem
to reject specialization—they
want to be the Renaissance and
some, presumably hope for a
part, and perhaps this number
is greater, reject the value-sys
tem of their parents and puzzle
themselves as to why this par
ticular rejection is not better
understood. Hence the so-called
generation-gap and, I suppose,
a part of the credibility gap.
There is, for some, rejection of
what they regard as slavishness
to conformity—conformity in
dress, in conventional manners,
and in such things as the am
bition to have a house in the
suburbs, a two-car family and
a colored televsiion within easy
reach.
I dare say that these observa
tions do not embrace the whole
context out of which today's
students ask the question, "How
best can I spend my undergrad
uate years?" But I suggest that
they are significant parts of the
whole, The context in which the
question is asked varies with
time and circumstance, but the
question itself is a hardy per
ennial.
Partial Answer
Part of the answer lies within
cach of you. You know better
than anyone else why you came

to college. I take it that you
wanted to do so, that few, if
any, of you came against your
will and only in response to
some parental or other pres
sure. And you should know bet
ter than anyone else why you
wanted to come. I should as
sume that the basic reason was,
of course, to continue your edu
cation. The opportunity to do so
in a new environment away
from home was probably not
unappealing to you. The pros
pect of enjoying a kind of new
freedom had its attractions as
well as anxieties. Many, if not
most, of you thought of college
as a natural, even necessary,
next step in preparation for a
career. I doubt that you thought
of college and a baccalaureate
degree simply as a status sym
bol. How consciously you looked
forward to college as an experi
ence in self development I don't
know, but it was probably some
where in your stream of con
sciousness. In any event, you
should know better than any
one else why you wanted to
come to college.
How aware were you when
you came that knowledge is the
most powerful of all human re
sources, that there is more
knowledge today than ever be
fore, and that its rate of accum
ulation continues to accelerate.
Since knowledge is the most im
portant commodity a college or

university has to offer, it fol
lows that a student's major op
portunity is to absorb and col
late as much of it as possible so
that he may harness and hitch
it and put it to work. . .
Commitment
There is a word in our vocabu
lary which I hear many of you
use with considerable frequency.
It is the word "commitment."
As I hear you use the word, it
is most frequently associated
with a sense of urgency to im
prove society, including the Uni
versity. I delight in this, even
though my delight is sometimes
punctuated with problems. I de
light in it because it bespeaks
a concern about the welfare of
mankind and a desire to be of
service I know of no commit
ment which can result in better
self development or in greater
service to mankind than a com
mitment to learn, a commitment
to knowledge. And this is the
prime commitment which I
would urge you to make. The
basic purpose of the educational
review now under way, in which
important contributions are ex
pected from you, is to discover
better ways and opportunities
to acquire knowledge and to put
knowledge to work so that bet
ter ways may be found to solve
problems great and small which
beset society.
The whole purpose of knowl
edge is to liberate—to liberate

from ignorance, from perjudice,
and from obsolence. There is
much knowledge to be discov
ered; this, too, is a mission of
the university—and probably its
most exciting mission.
Two Observations
Let me conclude with two ob
servations and questions.
First: As you spend your un
dergraduate years, acquiring
knowledge in the classrooms, in
the library and laboratory, in
discussions among yourselves
and with others, by participat
ing in a variety of activities, in
seeking, as we all do, to discover
and refine a set of values by
which each of us can live a
happy and helpful life, please
ponder this question: What
value a criticism, a conviction
or a principle which is not based
on knowledge?
Second: The vital statistics of
this nation indicate that in a few
years half of our population will
be less than 30 years of age.
This prospect should be very en
couraging for those of you who
accept the cliche that no one
over thirty can be trusted. But
not for long after those under
30 will have constituted a ma
jority, you will join the minor
ity. Will you then be knowledge
able enough to be trustworthy?
I believe that you will, and
that knowledge and trustworthi
ness will mean much to Stan
ford tomorrow, as it does today.
