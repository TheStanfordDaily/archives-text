# Convocation Address

### 
President Sterling's convocation address of
fered a well considered review of the problems
facing American higher education, in general,
and Stanford, in particular. But we were some
what disappointed that the President chose not
to be more specific in several areas.
The tone of the President's remarks was not
equal to his address before the Stanford Moth
ers' Club last week: he spoke reservedly, at
times cautiously, and failed to voice the same
sort of forthright confidence and excitement in
students' meeting the personal and academic
challenges of today's University, which were ap
parent in his speech last week.
The President's remarks on the extent and
aims of the general reevaluation was the most
complete summary of the study to date. Al
though tl; v"? Resident made public his call for
student assistance in the study last week, the
convocation address seemed to us an ideal occa
sion for discussing in greater detail "the impor
tant contribution" which students will be expect
ed to make in the next eighteen months. The
President did not expand upon his previous
broad commitment to employ students "fully and
actively."
Again the President was noticeably sketchy in
discussing the two issues which he has said evoke
interest in sectors outside the academic com
munityâ€”woman's off-campus living and open
house policy, which received no direct reference.
However, the President promised that these and
other issues would not be tied to the final report

of the study. In seeking the institutionalization
of innovation as one of the principal goals of the
study, the President has wisely taken the first
step away from "convulsive change" with the as
surance of a flow of recommendations from the
study group during the entire span of the project.
We found the President's description of the
"context" of today's students a perceptive com
ment on the Generation Gap. Yet in addressing
himself to the way to best spend the college
years, the President left a number of unan
swered questions. While we strongly agree that
commitment to knowledge must be primary, we
would also remind the President of his recent
statement on the healthy necessity for students
to "test the premises" as part of their college
experience.
Certainly, knowledge is the basic stuff of prin
ciples and convictions, but in this area we do
not believe that the pursuit of knowledge, of
itself, is the complete solution. Previously the
President has not wished to minimize the role
of the University in assisting students to test
premises, both academic and personal; yester
day the President did not address himself to
that role.
Clearly President Sterling has placed many of
his hopes in the recommendations of the general
revaluation. And judging from the personnel
and time expended in organizing the study, nei
ther he nor the University community is likely
to be dissatisfied. Nevertheless, we would have
liked to have seen the President discuss Stan
ford tomorrow as well as Stanford today.
