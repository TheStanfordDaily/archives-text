## Low Grade Prunes Budding Creativity 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
In case anyone was wonder
ing, after reading Professor
Guerard's comments last week
on creativity at Stanford, how
Professor Guerard reacts to and
nurtures the negligible amount
of creativity in the students he
already has, I think his com
ments on my final in his Forms
of the Modern Novel course
clarify his position.
I had asked him to verify the
C+ quality of a final which I
thought merited, at worst, a B+.
The following quotes his written
reply:
"The paper shows consider
able psychological insight (espe
cially Question II), but both long
essay questions are full of gram
matical errors. Write more care
fully! Question 1 less original.
I can't imagine anyone giving
you a markedly higher grade on
this, promising as it is."

Editor, The Daily:
Because Stanford life ends of
ficially with the last exam of the
quarter, the death of a man on
December 15th goes very much
unnoticed and uncommented.
Edwin J. Doyle managed to slip
inobtrusivedy out of this life,
where alive, he could not go un
noticed.
Professor Doyle had been de
scribed as anything ranging
from a heffalump to a 250 pound
Winnie the Pooh. His face was
red, his smile broad and ready,
and his wit was quick. He
brought life to the Classics and
light to his students. His best
pose was a sideways embar
rassed peep from behind his tie.
He was a marvelous teacher, and
he could drink any of his stu
dents under the table. Most of
all, he was a friend to all who
would be friends.
Mourn, University, you will
not find his like soon again!

• Misleading
Editor, The Daily:
I was astonished to read in
the January 23 edition of The
Daily that "Fraternities Threat
en New Rush Proposal." I feel
that the article is inaccurate and
misleading.
The Ad-Hoc Committee is a
non-legislative sounding board
and coordinating body which
exists for the convenience of all
parties directly concerned with
rush. For the past two months,
the Committee has been evaluat
ing past rush regulations and
considering various suggestions
for improvement of the rush
program. No formal proposal
exists for a rush schedule at
the present time.
When the Committee feels
that a proposal has been de
signed which is acceptable to all
participating living groups and
freshmen, it will be submitted
to the Associate Dean of Stu
dents for Counseling and Resi
dences. The Associate Dean of
Students maintains responsibil
ity for "governing" rush, and, in
the past, has valued highly the
advice of the Ad-Hoc Commit
tee.
It was difficult for your report
er to obtain details regarding the
formal rush schedule proposal,
since none exists. The fact that
there is no answer to the specific
question your reporter asks does
not imply that information re
garding a controversy is being
suppressed.
Many members of the Stan
ford community have devoted a
great deal of time and effort to
creating an atmosphere of mu
tual trust and confidence within
which the Ad-Hoc Committee has
been functioniog. It would be a
sad disservice if an inaccurate
and apparently irresponsible
journalistic effort were to jeop
ardize that atmosphere.

Guerard's comments last week
on creativity at Stanford, how
Professor Guerard reacts to and
nurtures the negligible amount
of creativity in the students he
already has, I think his com
ments on my final in his Forms
of the Modern Novel course
clarify his position.
I had asked him to verify the
C+ quality of a final which I
thought merited, at worst, a B+.
The following quotes his written
reply:
"The paper shows consider
able psychological insight (espe
cially Question II), but both long
essay questions are full of gram
matical errors. Write more care
fully! Question 1 less original.
I can't imagine anyone giving
you a markedly higher grade on
this, promising as it is."

Because Stanford life ends of
ficially with the last exam of the
quarter, the death of a man on
December 15th goes very much
unnoticed and uncommented.
Edwin J. Doyle managed to slip
inobtrusivedy out of this life,
where alive, he could not go un
noticed.
Professor Doyle had been de
scribed as anything ranging
from a heffalump to a 250 pound
Winnie the Pooh. His face was
red, his smile broad and ready,
and his wit was quick. He
brought life to the Classics and
light to his students. His best
pose was a sideways embar
rassed peep from behind his tie.
He was a marvelous teacher, and
he could drink any of his stu
dents under the table. Most of
all, he was a friend to all who
would be friends.
Mourn, University, you will
not find his like soon again!

Editor, The Daily:
I was astonished to read in
the January 23 edition of The
Daily that "Fraternities Threat
en New Rush Proposal." I feel
that the article is inaccurate and
misleading.
The Ad-Hoc Committee is a
non-legislative sounding board
and coordinating body which
exists for the convenience of all
parties directly concerned with
rush. For the past two months,
the Committee has been evaluat
ing past rush regulations and
considering various suggestions
for improvement of the rush
program. No formal proposal
exists for a rush schedule at
the present time.
When the Committee feels
that a proposal has been de
signed which is acceptable to all
participating living groups and
freshmen, it will be submitted
to the Associate Dean of Stu
dents for Counseling and Resi
dences. The Associate Dean of
Students maintains responsibil
ity for "governing" rush, and, in
the past, has valued highly the
advice of the Ad-Hoc Commit
tee.
It was difficult for your report
er to obtain details regarding the
formal rush schedule proposal,
since none exists. The fact that
there is no answer to the specific
question your reporter asks does
not imply that information re
garding a controversy is being
suppressed.
Many members of the Stan
ford community have devoted a
great deal of time and effort to
creating an atmosphere of mu
tual trust and confidence within
which the Ad-Hoc Committee has
been functioniog. It would be a
sad disservice if an inaccurate
and apparently irresponsible
journalistic effort were to jeop
ardize that atmosphere.
