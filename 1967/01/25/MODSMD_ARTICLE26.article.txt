# Today And Tomorrow
## Nightmare In China 
### Walter Lippmann 
Addressing Congress, the Pres
ident appeared as a sad and
compassionate man who, having
taken his stand in Vietnam, was
determined to persist no matter
what the cost.
The picture is misleading, lor
it leaves out the fact that the
President is confronted with
great new decisions. Last Tues
day's picture implied that the
military situation is stable. It
is, in fact, very fluid.
The new decisions turn on the
probability that our troops have
prevented a military victory over
the Saigon government by its
northern and southern enemies.
Neither Gen. William West
moreland nor Ambassador Lodge
takes the view that the South
Vietnamese will pacify South
Vietnam quickly. They are think
ing of a long period of guerrilla
warfare and terrorism and sab
otage—up to 10 years of it.
Other competent observers who
take a grimmer view of the
strength of the rebellion be
lieve that the task will have to
be performed by the United
States.
If they are right, the Presi
dent is going to have to make
new and tremendous decisions.
He will not be able, as he im
plied in his address to Congress,
just to grit his teeth and persist
in what he is doing. He will have

to decide whether to conquer
and occupy the whole of South
Vietnam—not merely to repel
the military intruders from the
North, but to suppress the re
bellion in the South—and then to
run the country until a new
South Vietnamese society can be
put together.
To commit ourselves to this
task would be to become an im
perialist power on the Asian con
tinent. Unhappily, the record of
Lyndon Johnson since his elec
tion gives little reason for hop
ing that he will not take this
path.
Justify Sacrifices
In 1967 he will, if he runs true
to form, enlarge the scope and
the objectives of the American
forces. He will argue sadly that
there is no alternative to doing
this, that to honor his pledges
and his promises and to justify
the sacrifices of the American
dead he must do this.
This, I believe, is the dread
possibility before us. It includes,
but it transcends, the much de
bated question of whether to at
tack Hanoi and Haiphong in or
der to "win" the war by knock
ing out North Vietnam. If the
President enters upon the im
perialist course, which is what
he is being hard pressed to do,
the war will widen and no one
will see the limit.

Moreover to conqure and pacify
the whole of South Vietnam
would require a million Ameri
can troops for an indefinite time.
This would mean the increasing
isolation of the United States
because we would be regarded
as a threat to the peace of the
world.
New Alternative
Is there no alternative which
is consistent with our interests
and our honor? There is. The
prospective nightmare I, have
been describing arises from the
current military situation—even
though our organized forces are
successful, the Vietnamese re
bellion continues.
The alternative to the im
perialist course is to stand fast
and be ready to negotiate. In
stead of conquering and occupy
ing the whole country we would
make secure the positions we
now hold and would then en
courage the Vietnamese to work
out, or to fight out, their destiny.
This is, of course, the central
principle of what is known as
the Gavin-Ridgway strategy.
Time and experience have shown
that it is the only workable strat
egy. For it is now generally ac
cepted that the U.S. forces can
not be pushed out of their
strongholds.
Commitment Impossible
Experience has shown, sec
ond, that the pacification of the
whole country would be an
enormous commitment to take,
one which might well prove to
be an impossible commitment.
Third, the junta of northern
generals around Gen. Nguyen
Cao Ky are quite incapable of
becoming leaders of the Viet
namese nation. These adven
turers from the North cannot
win the confidence of the people
of the South. The only hope in
the situation is to remain in our
military positions and let the in
ternal politics of Vietnam take
their course.
This is not a policy of scuttle
and-run, it is not a policy of de
layed surrender, it is not a
policy of betrayal and dishonor,
and I should like to see anyone
show that it is not in the true
interests of the United States.
