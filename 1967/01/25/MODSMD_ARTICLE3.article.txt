# Stanford Peace Corps Volunteer Explains Rigorous Trainee Life
## 
### STEVE GRUBER 
Peace Corps training is "tiring, but
a great deal of fun," according to
Dan Smith, a graduate of the class of
'66 and one of the newest Peace Corps
volunteers.
Smith finished ten weeks of
training last Wednesday for the Mic
ronesia 111 group. He will report to
the Marshall Islands Saturday for a
two year stay, where he will teach
high school physics.
He described the training, which was
held in Miami Beach, as a "full sched
ule."
Deselection
Approximately 160 people entered
training with Smith on November 9
and 60 of those were not selected
as Peace Corps volunteers. In the
jargon of the Peace Corps, they were
"deselected." Some of them resigned
voluntarily, however.
"One girl was deselected because
she had broken an engagement a year
before," Smith said. "The Peace Corps
thought that she was still running
away, so she was asked to leave."
Another trainee was deselected be
cause he showed a lack of motivation,
according to Smith.
Personality Tests
Trainees do not become official
Peace Corps volunteers until they are
sworn in at the end of training. Until
that time they may be deselected in
a number of ways for many different
reasons.
Everyone takes the Minnesota
Multiphasic Personality Inventory
soon after they arrive at the training
center. Anyone who does not do well
on the test will be asked to take furth
er tests.
If the other tests seem to indicate
that the trainee is mentally unstable,
he will be asked to leave.

"Peer ratings" make up another
part of the trainee's overall grade.
After five weeks everyone is asked to
pick the eight trainees who will be
the most successful as volunteers and
the eight who will be the least suc
cessful. The peer ratings are then
shown to each trainee. This process
is repeated at the end of the program,
except then everyone is rated.
Micronesia 111 was trained at the
Sun Village Motel in Miami Beach,
according to Smith. Westinghouse
managed the program, under a con
tract from the Peace Corps. The pro
grams are usually run by univer
sities, Smith said, but "Westinghouse
did a pretty good job."
Smith said that Westinghouse lost
money on the Micronesia I program.
To Work With Radio
When Smith leaves on Saturday, he
will report to a small town, Majuro,
in the Marshall Islands. About 6000
people live there, he said, and it is a
large city by Marshall Island stan
dards.
A former staffer of KZSU, the cam
pus radio station, Smith will also work
at WSZO, the government radio sta
tion for the area. "I expect to help
them increase their local program
ming," he said. "Right now, they are
using a lot of Armed Forces Radio
and Voice of America programs. They
also have Gunsmoke and Johnny Car
son."
Smith spent six hours per day learn
ing Marshallese while In training. His
ability to speak and hear the language
is rated at a one-plus. Five is the top
rating, which indicates a native speak
er. Smith said that he can compre
hend Marshallese when it is spoken
directly to him, but cannot speak it
well himself.
"This is the most efficient way I
have ever learned a language," Smith
added.
Of the six hours of language train
ing each day, one and a half were
spent in a language lab. The rest of
the time was devoted to classes in
which language drills, dialogues, and
tense transformations were used.
Vigorous Training
All of the trainees got up at 6:30
a.m. everyday for a physical workout.
The Canadian Air Force exercise
charts were used, followed by a mile
run.
The rest of the day was divided
between language classes, instruction

in community development, health,
American history, and Communism.
Two hours per day were devoted to
learning the techniques of teaching
English as a second language.
Smith spent two weeks practice
teaching in one of the Miami Beach
junior high schools. He taught six
classes per day and was expected to
do all of the preparation for the
classes himself.
The Peace Corps selects one out of
six applicants for training. The Stan
ford selection rate is higher—approxi
mately nine out of ten. However, out
of the three Stanford graduates in
Micronesia 111, only Smith was sworn
in.

cause he showed a lack of motivation,
according to Smith.
Personality Tests
Trainees do not become official
Peace Corps volunteers until they are
sworn in at the end of training. Until
that time they may be deselected in
a number of ways for many different
reasons.
Everyone takes the Minnesota
Multiphasic Personality Inventory
soon after they arrive at the training
center. Anyone who does not do well
on the test will be asked to take furth
er tests.
If the other tests seem to indicate
that the trainee is mentally unstable,
he will be asked to leave.

"Peer ratings" make up another
part of the trainee's overall grade.
After five weeks everyone is asked to
pick the eight trainees who will be
the most successful as volunteers and
the eight who will be the least suc
cessful. The peer ratings are then
shown to each trainee. This process
is repeated at the end of the program,
except then everyone is rated.
Micronesia 111 was trained at the
Sun Village Motel in Miami Beach,
according to Smith. Westinghouse
managed the program, under a con
tract from the Peace Corps. The pro
grams are usually run by univer
sities, Smith said, but "Westinghouse
did a pretty good job."
Smith said that Westinghouse lost
money on the Micronesia I program.
To Work With Radio
When Smith leaves on Saturday, he
will report to a small town, Majuro,
in the Marshall Islands. About 6000
people live there, he said, and it is a
large city by Marshall Island stan
dards.
A former staffer of KZSU, the cam
pus radio station, Smith will also work
at WSZO, the government radio sta
tion for the area. "I expect to help
them increase their local program
ming," he said. "Right now, they are
using a lot of Armed Forces Radio
and Voice of America programs. They
also have Gunsmoke and Johnny Car
son."
Smith spent six hours per day learn
ing Marshallese while In training. His
ability to speak and hear the language
is rated at a one-plus. Five is the top
rating, which indicates a native speak
er. Smith said that he can compre
hend Marshallese when it is spoken
directly to him, but cannot speak it
well himself.
"This is the most efficient way I
have ever learned a language," Smith
added.
Of the six hours of language train
ing each day, one and a half were
spent in a language lab. The rest of
the time was devoted to classes in
which language drills, dialogues, and
tense transformations were used.
Vigorous Training
All of the trainees got up at 6:30
a.m. everyday for a physical workout.
The Canadian Air Force exercise
charts were used, followed by a mile
run.
The rest of the day was divided
between language classes, instruction

in community development, health,
American history, and Communism.
Two hours per day were devoted to
learning the techniques of teaching
English as a second language.
Smith spent two weeks practice
teaching in one of the Miami Beach
junior high schools. He taught six
classes per day and was expected to
do all of the preparation for the
classes himself.
The Peace Corps selects one out of
six applicants for training. The Stan
ford selection rate is higher—approxi
mately nine out of ten. However, out
of the three Stanford graduates in
Micronesia 111, only Smith was sworn
in.
Peace Corps training is "tiring, but
a great deal of fun," according to
Dan Smith, a graduate of the class of
'66 and one of the newest Peace Corps
volunteers.
Smith finished ten weeks of
training last Wednesday for the Mic
ronesia 111 group. He will report to
the Marshall Islands Saturday for a
two year stay, where he will teach
high school physics.
He described the training, which was
held in Miami Beach, as a "full sched
ule."
Deselection
Approximately 160 people entered
training with Smith on November 9
and 60 of those were not selected
as Peace Corps volunteers. In the
jargon of the Peace Corps, they were
"deselected." Some of them resigned
voluntarily, however.
"One girl was deselected because
she had broken an engagement a year
before," Smith said. "The Peace Corps
thought that she was still running
away, so she was asked to leave."
Another trainee was deselected be
cause he showed a lack of motivation,
according to Smith.

according to Smith. Westinghouse
managed the program, under a con
tract from the Peace Corps. The pro
grams are usually run by univer
sities, Smith said, but "Westinghouse
did a pretty good job."
Smith said that Westinghouse lost
money on the Micronesia I program.
To Work With Radio
When Smith leaves on Saturday, he
will report to a small town, Majuro,
in the Marshall Islands. About 6000
people live there, he said, and it is a
large city by Marshall Island stan
dards.
A former staffer of KZSU, the cam
pus radio station, Smith will also work
at WSZO, the government radio sta
tion for the area. "I expect to help
them increase their local program
ming," he said. "Right now, they are
using a lot of Armed Forces Radio
and Voice of America programs. They
also have Gunsmoke and Johnny Car
son."
Smith spent six hours per day learn
ing Marshallese while In training. His
ability to speak and hear the language
is rated at a one-plus. Five is the top
rating, which indicates a native speak
er. Smith said that he can compre
hend Marshallese when it is spoken
directly to him, but cannot speak it
well himself.
"This is the most efficient way I
have ever learned a language," Smith
added.
Of the six hours of language train
ing each day, one and a half were
spent in a language lab. The rest of
the time was devoted to classes in
which language drills, dialogues, and
tense transformations were used.
Vigorous Training
All of the trainees got up at 6:30
a.m. everyday for a physical workout.
The Canadian Air Force exercise
charts were used, followed by a mile
run.
The rest of the day was divided
between language classes, instruction

in community development, health,
American history, and Communism.
Two hours per day were devoted to
learning the techniques of teaching
English as a second language.
Smith spent two weeks practice
teaching in one of the Miami Beach
junior high schools. He taught six
classes per day and was expected to
do all of the preparation for the
classes himself.
The Peace Corps selects one out of
six applicants for training. The Stan
ford selection rate is higher—approxi
mately nine out of ten. However, out
of the three Stanford graduates in
Micronesia 111, only Smith was sworn
in.
Peace Corps training is "tiring, but
a great deal of fun," according to
Dan Smith, a graduate of the class of
'66 and one of the newest Peace Corps
volunteers.
Smith finished ten weeks of
training last Wednesday for the Mic
ronesia 111 group. He will report to
the Marshall Islands Saturday for a
two year stay, where he will teach
high school physics.
He described the training, which was
held in Miami Beach, as a "full sched
ule."
Deselection
Approximately 160 people entered
training with Smith on November 9
and 60 of those were not selected
as Peace Corps volunteers. In the
jargon of the Peace Corps, they were
"deselected." Some of them resigned
voluntarily, however.
"One girl was deselected because
she had broken an engagement a year
before," Smith said. "The Peace Corps
thought that she was still running
away, so she was asked to leave."
Another trainee was deselected be
cause he showed a lack of motivation,
according to Smith.
Personality Tests
Trainees do not become official
Peace Corps volunteers until they are
sworn in at the end of training. Until
that time they may be deselected in
a number of ways for many different
reasons.
Everyone takes the Minnesota
Multiphasic Personality Inventory
soon after they arrive at the training
center. Anyone who does not do well
on the test will be asked to take furth
er tests.
If the other tests seem to indicate
that the trainee is mentally unstable,
he will be asked to leave.

"Peer ratings" make up another
part of the trainee's overall grade.
After five weeks everyone is asked to
pick the eight trainees who will be
the most successful as volunteers and
the eight who will be the least suc
cessful. The peer ratings are then
shown to each trainee. This process
is repeated at the end of the program,
except then everyone is rated.
