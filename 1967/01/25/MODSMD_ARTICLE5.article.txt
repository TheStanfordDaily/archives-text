Dean of Students Joel Smith and Dean Virgil YVhltaker spoke last night with
attentive students from Branner and Stem, answering questions which arose
from President Sterling's convocation address yesterday. The conversation
was part of a program in which University officials spoke with students from
every living group on campus after dinner.
