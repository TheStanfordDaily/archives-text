# President Stresses Need For Learning Commitment
## 
### DICK LIVINGSTON Asst. Managing Editor 
President Wallace Sterling urged
Stanford students to make "a commit
ment to learn, a commitment to knowl
edge" in his annual convocation ad
dress yesterday morning.
Students can apply this commit
ment, Sterling suggested, by contribut
ing to the study of education now
being initiated.
"The basic purpose of the educa
tional review ... is to discover better
ways and opportunities to acquire
knowledge and to put knowledge to
work so that better ways may be
found to solve problems great and
small which beset society," Sterling
explained.
Need More Space
Dr. Sterling told a near-capacity
audience in Memorial Auditorium
that, despite recent gains, Stanford
still needs more academic space. He
noted the "pressing need" for more
library resources and student financial
aid.
"If these needs are to be met out of
available and anticipated resources,
with the objective of improving aca
demic quality, serious consideration
must be given to the size of the stu
dent body, not least of all at the grad
uate level."
The concept of the residence uni
versity should also come under re
view, Sterling suggested. He noted
that the increase in the number of
students, the advent of the automobile
and the capital cost of new residence
halls have combined to make Stanford
less of a residence university than
it used to be, and to raise the question

as to whether the aspiration to be a
residence university is viable.
Residence University Concept
Sterling explained that the new edu
tion study will be able to cover these
problems because it is designed to be
as comprehensive as possible. It will
include undergraduate and graduate
education, extracurricular and curricu
lar programs and search for oppor
tunities for innovation, flexibility and
improvement.
"Priority attention will be given to
the concept of the residence university
and the problems therein entailed, in
cluding the OFF issue, the value of
such projects as Grove House, and
the roles of tutors, sponsors and resi
dent assistants," Sterling said.
The study is expected to extend
through most of the next academic
year. President Sterling anticipates a
flow of recommendations from the
Committee throughout the course of
the study.
One of the major considerations of
the study will be this: "How can edu
cational review and improvement be
. . . institutionalized and thereby elim
inate periodic and, in Professor Pack
er's phrase, 'Somewhat convulsive'
attacks on the problem?"
There Is Change Already
Sterling noted that change is al
ready taking place in University in
stitutions. The Board of Trustees is
currently studying the Board's com
position and organization. Likewise,
students should consider the structure

of student government. Sterling sug
gested students see if the present or
ganization is lacking in representation
or performance.
"For all segments of the University,
it (the study) invites attention to the
invention of mechanisms which will
improve collaborative effort to ad
vance the University by orderly pro
cedures," Sterling concluded.
Discussion Sessions
Last night students, faculty mem
bers and administrators met in the
various women's residences to dis
cuss the convocation.
Residents of Branner and Stern
complained that the administration
worries too much about practicality.
Dean Virgil Whitaker countered that
students generally don't have the
initiative to change things.
Dean Joel Smith called Sterling's
speech an "exercise in honesty." He
said in the past Stanford has indulged
in hypocrisy about the lag between
theory and practice concerning the
residential university. Smith indicated
an end to the concept of In loco
parentis will help "emancipate" stu
dents.
OFF Optimistic
Both Whitaker and Smtih were
optimistic about the OFF issue being
resolved to the student's satisfaction.
The discussion at the Grove House

was described as "apathetic" by sev
eral of the dozen students who par
ticipated.
At Roble, a small group of eating
club members and freshmen women
met in what was described as a
"worthwhile session." E. Howard
Brooks, vice-provost, indicated the
OFF issue has a low priority with the
Board of Trustees. He also said, in
response to a question, that there is
little chance the "ratio" will be
changed.
Student comment centered on the
problem of communication between
the administration and students. The
group felt that students usually hear
the results of decisions but are never
told why.

as to whether the aspiration to be a
residence university is viable.
Residence University Concept
Sterling explained that the new edu
tion study will be able to cover these
problems because it is designed to be
as comprehensive as possible. It will
include undergraduate and graduate
education, extracurricular and curricu
lar programs and search for oppor
tunities for innovation, flexibility and
improvement.
"Priority attention will be given to
the concept of the residence university
and the problems therein entailed, in
cluding the OFF issue, the value of
such projects as Grove House, and
the roles of tutors, sponsors and resi
dent assistants," Sterling said.
The study is expected to extend
through most of the next academic
year. President Sterling anticipates a
flow of recommendations from the
Committee throughout the course of
the study.
One of the major considerations of
the study will be this: "How can edu
cational review and improvement be
. . . institutionalized and thereby elim
inate periodic and, in Professor Pack
er's phrase, 'Somewhat convulsive'
attacks on the problem?"
There Is Change Already
Sterling noted that change is al
ready taking place in University in
stitutions. The Board of Trustees is
currently studying the Board's com
position and organization. Likewise,
students should consider the structure

"For all segments of the University,
it (the study) invites attention to the

improve collaborative effort to ad

cedures," Sterling concluded.
Discussion Sessions
Last night students, faculty mem
bers and administrators met in the
various women's residences to dis
cuss the convocation.
Residents of Branner and Stern
complained that the administration
worries too much about practicality.
Dean Virgil Whitaker countered that
students generally don't have the
initiative to change things.
Dean Joel Smith called Sterling's
speech an "exercise in honesty." He
said in the past Stanford has indulged
in hypocrisy about the lag between
theory and practice concerning the
residential university. Smith indicated
an end to the concept of In loco
parentis will help "emancipate" stu
dents.
OFF Optimistic
Both Whitaker and Smtih were
optimistic about the OFF issue being
resolved to the student's satisfaction.
The discussion at the Grove House

was described as "apathetic" by sev
eral of the dozen students who par
ticipated.
At Roble, a small group of eating
club members and freshmen women
met in what was described as a
"worthwhile session." E. Howard
Brooks, vice-provost, indicated the
OFF issue has a low priority with the
Board of Trustees. He also said, in
response to a question, that there is
little chance the "ratio" will be
changed.
Student comment centered on the
problem of communication between
the administration and students. The
group felt that students usually hear
the results of decisions but are never
told why.
President Wallace Sterling urged
Stanford students to make "a commit
ment to learn, a commitment to knowl
edge" in his annual convocation ad
dress yesterday morning.
Students can apply this commit
ment, Sterling suggested, by contribut
ing to the study of education now
being initiated.
"The basic purpose of the educa
tional review ... is to discover better
ways and opportunities to acquire
knowledge and to put knowledge to
work so that better ways may be
found to solve problems great and
small which beset society," Sterling
explained.
Need More Space
Dr. Sterling told a near-capacity
audience in Memorial Auditorium
that, despite recent gains, Stanford
still needs more academic space. He
noted the "pressing need" for more
library resources and student financial
aid.
"If these needs are to be met out of
available and anticipated resources,
with the objective of improving aca
demic quality, serious consideration
must be given to the size of the stu
dent body, not least of all at the grad
uate level."
The concept of the residence uni
versity should also come under re
view, Sterling suggested. He noted
that the increase in the number of
students, the advent of the automobile
and the capital cost of new residence
halls have combined to make Stanford
less of a residence university than
it used to be, and to raise the question

as to whether the aspiration to be a
residence university is viable.

or performance.
"For all segments of the University,
it (the study) invites attention to the
invention of mechanisms which will
improve collaborative effort to ad
vance the University by orderly pro
cedures," Sterling concluded.
Discussion Sessions
Last night students, faculty mem
bers and administrators met in the
various women's residences to dis
cuss the convocation.
Residents of Branner and Stern
complained that the administration
worries too much about practicality.
Dean Virgil Whitaker countered that
students generally don't have the
initiative to change things.
Dean Joel Smith called Sterling's
speech an "exercise in honesty." He
said in the past Stanford has indulged
in hypocrisy about the lag between
theory and practice concerning the
residential university. Smith indicated
an end to the concept of In loco
parentis will help "emancipate" stu
dents.
OFF Optimistic
Both Whitaker and Smtih were
optimistic about the OFF issue being
resolved to the student's satisfaction.
The discussion at the Grove House

was described as "apathetic" by sev
eral of the dozen students who par
ticipated.
At Roble, a small group of eating
club members and freshmen women
met in what was described as a
"worthwhile session." E. Howard
Brooks, vice-provost, indicated the
OFF issue has a low priority with the
Board of Trustees. He also said, in
response to a question, that there is
little chance the "ratio" will be
changed.
Student comment centered on the
problem of communication between
the administration and students. The
group felt that students usually hear
the results of decisions but are never
told why.
President Wallace Sterling urged
Stanford students to make "a commit
ment to learn, a commitment to knowl
edge" in his annual convocation ad
dress yesterday morning.
Students can apply this commit
ment, Sterling suggested, by contribut
ing to the study of education now
being initiated.
"The basic purpose of the educa
tional review ... is to discover better
ways and opportunities to acquire
knowledge and to put knowledge to
work so that better ways may be
found to solve problems great and
small which beset society," Sterling
explained.
Need More Space
Dr. Sterling told a near-capacity
audience in Memorial Auditorium
that, despite recent gains, Stanford
still needs more academic space. He
noted the "pressing need" for more
library resources and student financial
aid.
"If these needs are to be met out of
available and anticipated resources,
with the objective of improving aca
demic quality, serious consideration
must be given to the size of the stu
dent body, not least of all at the grad
uate level."
The concept of the residence uni
versity should also come under re
view, Sterling suggested. He noted
that the increase in the number of
students, the advent of the automobile
and the capital cost of new residence
halls have combined to make Stanford
less of a residence university than
it used to be, and to raise the question

as to whether the aspiration to be a
residence university is viable.
Residence University Concept
Sterling explained that the new edu
tion study will be able to cover these
problems because it is designed to be
as comprehensive as possible. It will
include undergraduate and graduate
education, extracurricular and curricu
lar programs and search for oppor
tunities for innovation, flexibility and
improvement.
"Priority attention will be given to
the concept of the residence university
and the problems therein entailed, in
cluding the OFF issue, the value of
such projects as Grove House, and
the roles of tutors, sponsors and resi
dent assistants," Sterling said.
The study is expected to extend
through most of the next academic
year. President Sterling anticipates a
flow of recommendations from the
Committee throughout the course of
the study.
One of the major considerations of
the study will be this: "How can edu
cational review and improvement be
. . . institutionalized and thereby elim
inate periodic and, in Professor Pack
er's phrase, 'Somewhat convulsive'
attacks on the problem?"
There Is Change Already
Sterling noted that change is al
ready taking place in University in
stitutions. The Board of Trustees is
currently studying the Board's com
position and organization. Likewise,
students should consider the structure
