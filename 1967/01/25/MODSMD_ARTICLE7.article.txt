# Search On For Better Austria Site
## 
### MARIAN JOHNSTON 
The Overseas Campuses Office is
sued a statement yesterday concern
ing the possibility of a new location
for the Stanford in Austria program.
George R. Hamrdla, assistant to the
director of the Overseas Campuses
Robert A. Walker, said, "The possi
bility of a new site in Vienna is pres
ently under consideration. Until furth
er considerations within the Univer
sity have been completed, no details
will be available."
This statement agrees with reports
which appeared in The Daily last
week saying the Austrian campus may
soon move to Vienna.
The present site of the campus,
The Semmering, has been criticized
because of its isolation. Students who
participated in Austria II complained
that they were unable to take ad
vantage of the cultural heritage of the
country as they were two hours by
chartered bus or four hours by train
away from Vienna.
The Semmering is primarily a ski
resort town, and the Austria II group
reported that the natives were ap
parently interested only in the tourist
trade.
Walker and Dwight Adams, Univer
sity Business Manager, recently re
turned from Europe where they were
reportedly trying to locate a new site
for the Austrian campus.
Reports from students in Austria
111 say that Professor Lewis Spitz
located a potential site within walking
distance of the Opera House in Vienna,
but Spitz would not confirm these re
ports.
Walker, in a reply to a letter by
Spitz which appeared in The Daily
said he had asked the Austrian Direc
tors to look for new possible loca
tions.
