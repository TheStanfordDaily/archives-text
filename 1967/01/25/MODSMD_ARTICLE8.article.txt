# Kesey Trips; Few Follow In Happening That Didn't
## 
### MIKE KUHL 
"If psychedelics mean anything,
you've got to get in my way. We have
to have an exchange to have a rela
-tionship. To mean anything a rela
tionship has to involve both of us.
Those of you who came to hear what

I know will be v&ry disappointed. I
don't know that much."
As a crowd of over 450 people
crowded into the Tresidder Lounges
last night, Ken Kesey admitted what
later became obvious. What was to
be a lecture entitled "Psychedelics
and the Creative Arts" turned into
what many regarded as a happening
that never happened.
, Tonight the Tresidder Program Di
vision Series will continue with a
panel discussion of the effect of
psychedelic drugs on the basic ele
ments of personality. The panel mem
bers will be Dr. Frank Barron, a
psychology professor from Berke
ley, Dr. William McGlothin from the
Rand Corporation, and Dr. Jack
Downing from the San Mateo Mental
Health Service.

For last night's program, Ken Babbs,
a member of the Kesey caravan, in
troduced the entire Kesey family be
fore leading the audience in a chant
of "We want Kesey." When Ken Kesey
was sure that policemen weren't
chanting this, he appeared.
However, Kesey decided that he need
ed some microphones, so he lead about
half of the audience down to his
brightly colored bus outside Tresidder.
As people crawled through the an
tiquated International bus filled with
clothes, baby food cans, and electrical
equipment, Babbs insisted, "This is a
great show."
While Civ Waited
People who had bought series tick
ets weren't quite so sure. One girl
said, "It's just a waste, and I have Civ
to read." Another boy said, "I think
it's a fraud. I wouldn't be surprised
if they ended up stealing all the
Tresidder electrical equipment before
it's over."
Back in the Lounge, Kesey con
tinued, "The experience of these very
ancient forces is always available.
Very little I can say about this search
will help you. What I am may help
you; what I say may be a distraction."

For last night's program, Ken Babbs,
a member of the Kesey caravan, in
troduced the entire Kesey family be
fore leading the audience in a chant
of "We want Kesey." When Ken Kesey
was sure that policemen weren't
chanting this, he appeared.
However, Kesey decided that he need
ed some microphones, so he lead about
half of the audience down to his
brightly colored bus outside Tresidder.
As people crawled through the an
tiquated International bus filled with
clothes, baby food cans, and electrical
equipment, Babbs insisted, "This is a
great show."
While Civ Waited
People who had bought series tick
ets weren't quite so sure. One girl
said, "It's just a waste, and I have Civ
to read." Another boy said, "I think
it's a fraud. I wouldn't be surprised
if they ended up stealing all the
Tresidder electrical equipment before
it's over."
Back in the Lounge, Kesey con
tinued, "The experience of these very
ancient forces is always available.
Very little I can say about this search
will help you. What I am may help
you; what I say may be a distraction."
"If psychedelics mean anything,
you've got to get in my way. We have
to have an exchange to have a rela
-tionship. To mean anything a rela
tionship has to involve both of us.
Those of you who came to hear what

I know will be v&ry disappointed. I
don't know that much."
As a crowd of over 450 people
crowded into the Tresidder Lounges
last night, Ken Kesey admitted what
later became obvious. What was to
be a lecture entitled "Psychedelics
and the Creative Arts" turned into
what many regarded as a happening
