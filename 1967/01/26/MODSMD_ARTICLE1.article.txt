# Pass-Fail Experiment Termed 'Roaring Success'

(First of two parts)
The first set of empirical evidence is in on
Stanford's official experiment in pass-fail grad
ing, and indications so far are that the pro
gram has been, in one professor's words, "a
roaring success."
But augmenting the chorus of yea-sayers
are numerous calls for revision, modification,
or extension of the program.
Recommended last fall by the Committee on
Undergraduate Education as a "three-year ex
periment" to be reviewed at the end of the
third year, the program was approved in
June by the Academic Council and went into
effect at the start of the present school year.
More than 900 students elected to take a
pass-fail course last quarter, and while figures
for this term are not yet available (the last day
for filing a pass-fail declarations is February
1), officials estimate the number will be even
greater.
The system used last quarter where each
instructor turned in on the mid-quarter re
ports the names of the persons taking the

course pass-fail "was not entirely satisfac
tory," according to Harvey Hall, Registrar,
and this quarter students are required to fill
out a pass-fail declaration.
The stated purpose of the pass-fail system is
to encourage students to attempt courses out
side their majors, and there is general agree
ment that in this respect it has been over
whelmingly successful.
"By and large, students have been using the
program for just the purpose it was intended,"
Winslow Briggs, chairman of the Registrar's
Advisory Committee which is presently ex
amining the program, says. He notes, however,
that some problems have cropped up.
"There was concern in the committee that
some students are using the system to play
the 'numbers game,' " he said. Some students
might attempt to maximize their grade point
averages, by changing at the last moment to
pass-fail in a course which seemed to be going
badly, or switching to grades in a course in
which they might be doing well, he explained.
He emphasized, however, that this is not a
serious problem, and probably does not occur

very often. "I think there's a real question of
how much time you want to spend trying to
plug all these loopholes," he added.
Half-Load
The committee also questioned whether
some students could use the program to
achieve an effective half-load. It would be
possible, the argument runs, for someone to
take a five-unit course pass-fail, and never at
tend lectures or complete the work for the
course, concentrating on the remaining eight
or nine units, yet receiving no reduction in
grade points, since "fails" do not count on a
GPA.
"Some of us were concerned that the pen
alty for failing was not strong enough," Hall
commented, "but after considerable discus
sion, the committee finally agreed that a minus
on the transcript and loss of the units was suf
ficient penalty." Students on the committee
were especially vocal in putting forth this
position, he noted.
"In any case," Hall added, "a student can't
fail many five-unit courses and still graduate
in 12 quarters."

Other changes are also being considered,
Briggs commented. One faculty member has
suggested that senior colloquia should be
graded pass-fail if a student wishes, since col
loquia are specifically intended to force stu
dents outside their major field.
legalistic
Briggs cautioned, however, that the Regis
trar's Advisory Committee has no authority to
change the program from the framework ap
proved by the Academic Council. He termed
the formulation of the program "highly legal
istic and detailed," and noted that changes
would have to be voted on by the Council.
Under the present set-up, no courses used to
fulfill general studies or major requirements
may be taken pass-fail.
Some have insisted that this and other
restrictions should be eliminated. "General
studies requirements consist almost entirely
of courses outside a student's major," says
Joel Kugelmass, a senior English major, "I
can see no reason for not permitting them
to be taken pass-fail.
"For that matter," he continues, "if a stu

dent wishes to take courses within his major
pass-fail, he should be able to do so. It may
affect his chances for gradate school, but
that's his decision."
'Lazy'
In the early days of Stanford, all courses
were graded pass-fail, with additional marks
of "unprepared," "indifferent," or simply
"lazy" sometimes being added. Faculty mem
bers generally dismiss the possibility that Stan
ford might return to this system, however.
They concur in the opinion that an all-pass-fail
record would seriously hinder a student's
chances for graduate or professional school.
But growing support is being voiced for a
pass-fail freshmen year. Advocates claim it
will reduce "grade trauma" and "place the
emphasis on achievement in a subject rather
than simply doing what's necessary to get a
grade." Foes, on the other hand, maintain that
adjustment problems would only be postponed
a year ,and in the absence of grading pres
sures, students would simply do less work.
Tomorrow's article will explore this contro
versy.

Advisory Committee which is presently ex
amining the program, says. He notes, however,
that some problems have cropped up.
"There was concern in the committee that
some students are using the system to play
the 'numbers game,' " he said. Some students
might attempt to maximize their grade point
averages, by changing at the last moment to
pass-fail in a course which seemed to be going
badly, or switching to grades in a course in
which they might be doing well, he explained.
He emphasized, however, that this is not a
serious problem, and probably does not occur

very often. "I think there's a real question of
how much time you want to spend trying to
plug all these loopholes," he added.
Half-Load
The committee also questioned whether
some students could use the program to
achieve an effective half-load. It would be
possible, the argument runs, for someone to
take a five-unit course pass-fail, and never at
tend lectures or complete the work for the
course, concentrating on the remaining eight
or nine units, yet receiving no reduction in
grade points, since "fails" do not count on a
GPA.
"Some of us were concerned that the pen
alty for failing was not strong enough," Hall
commented, "but after considerable discus
sion, the committee finally agreed that a minus
on the transcript and loss of the units was suf
ficient penalty." Students on the committee
were especially vocal in putting forth this
position, he noted.
"In any case," Hall added, "a student can't
fail many five-unit courses and still graduate
in 12 quarters."

Other changes are also being considered,
Briggs commented. One faculty member has
suggested that senior colloquia should be
graded pass-fail if a student wishes, since col
loquia are specifically intended to force stu
dents outside their major field.
legalistic
Briggs cautioned, however, that the Regis
trar's Advisory Committee has no authority to
change the program from the framework ap
proved by the Academic Council. He termed
the formulation of the program "highly legal
istic and detailed," and noted that changes
would have to be voted on by the Council.
Under the present set-up, no courses used to
fulfill general studies or major requirements
may be taken pass-fail.
Some have insisted that this and other
restrictions should be eliminated. "General
studies requirements consist almost entirely
of courses outside a student's major," says
Joel Kugelmass, a senior English major, "I
can see no reason for not permitting them
to be taken pass-fail.
"For that matter," he continues, "if a stu

dent wishes to take courses within his major
pass-fail, he should be able to do so. It may
affect his chances for gradate school, but
that's his decision."
'Lazy'
In the early days of Stanford, all courses
were graded pass-fail, with additional marks
of "unprepared," "indifferent," or simply
"lazy" sometimes being added. Faculty mem
bers generally dismiss the possibility that Stan
ford might return to this system, however.
They concur in the opinion that an all-pass-fail
record would seriously hinder a student's
chances for graduate or professional school.
But growing support is being voiced for a
pass-fail freshmen year. Advocates claim it
will reduce "grade trauma" and "place the
emphasis on achievement in a subject rather
than simply doing what's necessary to get a
grade." Foes, on the other hand, maintain that
adjustment problems would only be postponed
a year ,and in the absence of grading pres
sures, students would simply do less work.
Tomorrow's article will explore this contro
versy.

The first set of empirical evidence is in on
Stanford's official experiment in pass-fail grad
ing, and indications so far are that the pro
gram has been, in one professor's words, "a
roaring success."
But augmenting the chorus of yea-sayers
are numerous calls for revision, modification,
or extension of the program.
Recommended last fall by the Committee on
Undergraduate Education as a "three-year ex
periment" to be reviewed at the end of the
third year, the program was approved in
June by the Academic Council and went into
effect at the start of the present school year.
More than 900 students elected to take a
pass-fail course last quarter, and while figures
for this term are not yet available (the last day
for filing a pass-fail declarations is February
1), officials estimate the number will be even
greater.
The system used last quarter where each
instructor turned in on the mid-quarter re
ports the names of the persons taking the

course pass-fail "was not entirely satisfac
tory," according to Harvey Hall, Registrar,
and this quarter students are required to fill
out a pass-fail declaration.
The stated purpose of the pass-fail system is
to encourage students to attempt courses out
side their majors, and there is general agree
ment that in this respect it has been over
whelmingly successful.

fail many five-unit courses and still graduate
in 12 quarters."

Other changes are also being considered,
Briggs commented. One faculty member has
suggested that senior colloquia should be
graded pass-fail if a student wishes, since col
loquia are specifically intended to force stu
dents outside their major field.
legalistic
Briggs cautioned, however, that the Regis
trar's Advisory Committee has no authority to
change the program from the framework ap
proved by the Academic Council. He termed
the formulation of the program "highly legal
istic and detailed," and noted that changes
would have to be voted on by the Council.
Under the present set-up, no courses used to
fulfill general studies or major requirements
may be taken pass-fail.
Some have insisted that this and other
restrictions should be eliminated. "General
studies requirements consist almost entirely
of courses outside a student's major," says
Joel Kugelmass, a senior English major, "I
can see no reason for not permitting them
to be taken pass-fail.
"For that matter," he continues, "if a stu

dent wishes to take courses within his major
pass-fail, he should be able to do so. It may
affect his chances for gradate school, but
that's his decision."
'Lazy'
In the early days of Stanford, all courses
were graded pass-fail, with additional marks
of "unprepared," "indifferent," or simply
"lazy" sometimes being added. Faculty mem
bers generally dismiss the possibility that Stan
ford might return to this system, however.
They concur in the opinion that an all-pass-fail
record would seriously hinder a student's
chances for graduate or professional school.
But growing support is being voiced for a
pass-fail freshmen year. Advocates claim it
will reduce "grade trauma" and "place the
emphasis on achievement in a subject rather
than simply doing what's necessary to get a
grade." Foes, on the other hand, maintain that
adjustment problems would only be postponed
a year ,and in the absence of grading pres
sures, students would simply do less work.
Tomorrow's article will explore this contro
versy.
(First of two parts)
The first set of empirical evidence is in on
Stanford's official experiment in pass-fail grad
ing, and indications so far are that the pro
gram has been, in one professor's words, "a
roaring success."
But augmenting the chorus of yea-sayers
are numerous calls for revision, modification,
or extension of the program.
Recommended last fall by the Committee on
Undergraduate Education as a "three-year ex
periment" to be reviewed at the end of the
third year, the program was approved in
June by the Academic Council and went into
effect at the start of the present school year.
More than 900 students elected to take a
pass-fail course last quarter, and while figures
for this term are not yet available (the last day
for filing a pass-fail declarations is February
1), officials estimate the number will be even
greater.
The system used last quarter where each
instructor turned in on the mid-quarter re
ports the names of the persons taking the

course pass-fail "was not entirely satisfac
tory," according to Harvey Hall, Registrar,
and this quarter students are required to fill
out a pass-fail declaration.
The stated purpose of the pass-fail system is
to encourage students to attempt courses out
side their majors, and there is general agree
ment that in this respect it has been over
whelmingly successful.
"By and large, students have been using the
program for just the purpose it was intended,"
Winslow Briggs, chairman of the Registrar's
Advisory Committee which is presently ex
amining the program, says. He notes, however,
that some problems have cropped up.
"There was concern in the committee that
some students are using the system to play
the 'numbers game,' " he said. Some students
might attempt to maximize their grade point
averages, by changing at the last moment to
pass-fail in a course which seemed to be going
badly, or switching to grades in a course in
which they might be doing well, he explained.
He emphasized, however, that this is not a
serious problem, and probably does not occur

very often. "I think there's a real question of
how much time you want to spend trying to
plug all these loopholes," he added.
Half-Load
The committee also questioned whether
some students could use the program to
achieve an effective half-load. It would be
possible, the argument runs, for someone to
take a five-unit course pass-fail, and never at
tend lectures or complete the work for the
course, concentrating on the remaining eight
or nine units, yet receiving no reduction in
grade points, since "fails" do not count on a
GPA.
"Some of us were concerned that the pen
alty for failing was not strong enough," Hall
commented, "but after considerable discus
sion, the committee finally agreed that a minus
on the transcript and loss of the units was suf
ficient penalty." Students on the committee
were especially vocal in putting forth this
position, he noted.
"In any case," Hall added, "a student can't
fail many five-unit courses and still graduate
in 12 quarters."
