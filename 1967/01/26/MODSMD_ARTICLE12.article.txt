# Wilbur Hosts Upperclassmen In Pre-Rush Dinner Exchange
## 
### SCOTT KEENEY 
The fraternities, eating clubs,
and Stern houses are eating at
Wilbur.
This year, for the first time,
freshmen are participating in a
pre-rush meal exchange with
residences and social clubs.
Every night since January 16,
six members of eating clubs,
fraternities, or Stern houses
have been eating dinner in each
of the Wilbur houses. After din
ner, freshmen get a chance to
talk to the representatives of
each group during informal dis
cussion periods.
The purpose of the exchange,
according to ad hoc rush com
mittee chairman Professor Law
rence Bennigson, has been "to
offer not only an opportunity for
informal contact between fresh
men and living groups, but also
to encourage a diversity of con
tact." Professor Bennigson feels
all freshmen should be exposed

to what he calls the "flavor of
different kinds of living groups."
The first phase of the meal
exchange involves a one-way
movement of upperclass repre
sentatives to Wilbur. This phase
will end tonight.
Beginning next Monday, a two
way exchange begins: freshman
men will visit the living groups
of their choice, and living group
members will continue to visit
Wilbur and Stern.
60 Per Cent Of Freshmen
To Participate
During this second phase of
the meal exchange, more than
60 per cent of all freshman men
are expected to visit eating clubs,
fraternities, or Stern houses to
eat lunch or dinner. Each fresh
man should be able to visit at
least two eating clubs, two Stern
houses, and two fraternities. In
formal, after-dinner discussions
will be continued.
Freshman men were surveyed

early last week to determine
which living groups they would
like to visit. According to Glenn
Hara, one of the prime movers
in the meal exchange program,
90 per cent of the freshmen who
replied to the survey indicated
an interest in visiting fraterni
ties, 60 per cent in eating clubs
and 20 per cent in the Stern
houses.
The meal exchange program is
sponsored and directed by the
Stern Inter-House Council, the
Inter-Fraternity Council, the In
ter-Wilbur Council, and the eat
ing clubs' Inter-Club Council.
The second phase of the meal
exchange will end February 6.
The first scheduled rush events
begin February 7.
