# Berkeley Marches On In Its Own Usual Style

Berkeley, Jan. 25 (AP)—Re
gardless of the uproar over the
firing of President Clark Kerr
of the University of California,
the colorful characters on the
Berkeley campus carry on.
Each morning at about 8, fig
ures in blankets, long hair,
beards, sandals and what not
trudge to the Sather Gate, tot
ing buttons, placards, pamphlets
and spiels. Some are students,
some not.
The gate stands between the
Student Union and Sproul Hall,
the area on the Berkeley cam
pus where all happenings hap
pen.
As students hurry by to their
first classes, the tables go up.
The fellow who runs the So
cialist table chats with the girl
at the Sexual Freedom table.
Not far away a fellow offers
a petition for those wishing to
impeach Gov. Ronald Reagan.
He sells buttons for 25 cents.
Next to him a neatly dressed
fellow offers New Testaments
free —only to Jews. And next
to him a couple hawk buttons
saying things like "Chaste
Makes Waste," and "Make Mar
ijuana Legal."
And there are the dogs. The
place is a magnet for pooches
of every description, from tiny

mongrels to a huge Great Dane
bumming eats from students'
lunches.
Ten—maybe 20 at a time
frolic at the gate, bathing in
the fountain, rolling around on
the grass.
And there are a lot of argu
ments in there among the but
tons, beards and spielers.
After all, it's Berkeley.
