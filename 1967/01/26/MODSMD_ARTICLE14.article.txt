# Anti-Draft Union Offers 'We Won't Go' Petition
## 
### 
The Stanford Anti-Draft
Union, following its meeting
Sunday night, announced the
circulation of a petition in oppo
sition to both the war in Viet
nam and to the draft.
Members of the union are
currently circulating the peti
tion, dubbed "We Won't Go,"
and copies are also available
in the ASSU bullpen. The peti
tion reads: "As a young man
of draft age (1) I will not allow
myself to be conscripted; (2) I
will not fight in Vietnam." The
Union is encouraging those who
sign to check either or both
statements. The names will be

made public when a "sufficient
number of signatures has been
obtained."
According to John Saari,
member of the Anti - Draft
Union, this form of action was
decided upon because "tradi
tional means of protest are no
longer effective. This petition
calls for a stronger commit
ment than parading with a
sign."
The Union will hold an open
meeting next Thursday to dis
cuss the petition and other anti
draft programs, such as com
munity education and re-evalu
ation of the University's co
operation with the Selective Ser
vice.
