# Observers Find North Vietnam Unwilling To Talk
## 
### WILLIAM L. RYAN AP Special Correspondent 
In the last month 13 Westerners
eight of them U.S. citizens — have
visited Communist North Vietnam.
In essence, their findings, added to
gether, seemed to puncture the idea
that the Communist North is ready
to talk, short of a U.S. surrender on
terms Washington refuses to accept.
If there was disagreement on this,
it was a matter of degree. The visitors
were in agreement on most of their
observations.
Two of the American visitors were
practicing journalists, another a for
mer newsman. Four of the visitors
were American women pacifists.
One was a Mexican diplomat and
five were clergymen.
Points Of Consensus
There was agreement on these
points:
• That the bombing of North Viet
nam had failed in terms of forcing
Hanoi to a peace table.
• That the North Vietnamese ap
pear determined to outlast the United
States, and confident that their stay
ing powers in a "protracted war" are
greater than the U.S. will to continue
the conflict.
• That U.S. bombing of the North,
whatever its effectiveness in interdict
ing supplies and troops movements
to the South, had caused fairly heavy
damage to civilian areas, including
areas inside Hanoi. All saw substant

ially the same areas and brought back
sustantially the same reports.
• That an unconditional halt in the
bombings would be a prerequisite to
any talks—but none could say that
this would lead to talks.
• That North Vietnam believes in
the long run it is: going to win, even
though it may be aware that it lacks
the strength to push the American
military might out of Vietnam, and
that Hanoi is willing to fight on for
many years, if necessary.
Disagree On Talks
The key area of disagreement—if it
could be called thEit—lay in the pro
spects for peace talks, and this dis
agreement was orly a matter of de
gree. One visitor was encouraged by
a possible shift in Hanoi's attitude, but
another saw not even a glimmer of
hope for a break in the stalemate.
The fact that so many Americans
were admitted to North Vietnam at
this particular time stirred consider
able interest in the possible motives.
From the accounts; of the visitors
themselves, it would appear that these
motives involve less any significant
change of attitude but more an eager
ness to spread before the outside
world Hanoi's complaints about U.S.
bombings. It is known that East Euro
pean Communists andi others had been
urging the Hanoi regime to receive
visitors from the west.
Actually, these were not the first
Westerners welcomed by the Hanoi

regime. There had been others, such
as Prof. Staughton Lynd of Yale Uni
versity, who in December, 1965, defied
a U.S. Government ban on such visits
to go to Hanoi as a sponsor of a war.
The difference in the last month has
been that the North Vietnamese re
gime has admitted some who lacked
such clearcut causes.
The first of the 13 Westerners was
Harrison E. Salisbury, an assistant
managing editor of the New York
Times, who spent two weeks in and
around Hanoi.
Following Salisbury
As Salisbury left, three others ar
rived: William C. Baggs, editor of the
Miami Daily News; Harry S. Ash
more, Pulitzer Prize-winning former
editor of the Arkansas Gazette, and
Luis Quintanilla, former Mexican Am
bassador to the Organization of Amer
ican States. All three are connected
with the Center for Study of Demo
cratic Institutions, based in Santa
Barbara, Calif., and their mission was
to invite Hanoi to send a representa
tive to an unofficial "Peace on Earth"
convocation in Geneva next May.
The clergymen were Dr. Martin Nie
moller, German Protestant leader, and
Msgr. Georg Huessler, a German Ro
man Catholic, representing an aid pro
gram for both Vietnams; the Rt. Rev.
Ambrose Reeves, Assistant Bishop of
Britain's Chichester Diocese; the Rev.
A. J. Muste, 82-year-old Protestant
cleric and pacifist from New York, and

Rabbi Abraham L. Feinberg of To
ronto, a critic of U.S. Vietnam policy.
The last three churchmen arrived
after the first two had left.
The women were Mrs. Diane Bevel
of Chicago, Mrs. Grace M. Newman
of Nevfc York, Miss Barbara Deming
of Wellfleet, Mass., and Mrs. Joe Grif
fith of Ithaca, N.Y. All four were on
a trip that lacked approval under U.S.
passport controls.
Mrs. Newman is a sister to Pvt.
Denis Mora of New York, who was
jailed for refusing to serve in Vietnam.
Premier Talks
Salisbury generated some excite
ment January 3 with an interview
with the Communist Premier, Pham
Van Dong, whom "Salisbury repre
sented as stressing that the North's
"four points" for a Vietnam settle
ment were not to be considered "con
ditions" for talks, but as providing a
"basis for settlement of the Vietnam
problem." The "four points" are an
all-or-nothing stand demanding with
drawal of the United States and settle
ment of the war "in accordance with
the program of the National Libera
tion Front,' the political front of the
Communist Viet Cong.
A few days later, Salisbury, noting
the wave of speculation aroused by
the interview, presented an expanded
version of the Premier's remarks
which said the four points should not
be considered as conditions but "mere
ly truths," and adding that "we must

come to a solution on the basis of
the four points."
He added a fifth point, too: "to de
mand that the United States put, un
conditionally and for good, an end to
the bombing and all hostile activity
against the North." This seemed to
chill the hopes of those who had de
tected some change in Hanoi's atti
tude.
More Speculation
However, when Ashmore and Baggs
saw President Ho Chi Minh and other
North Vietnamese leaders, specula
tion was revived. Ashmore reported
the North Vietnamese "did not make
an issue" of the four points. Indeed,
at one juncture in the Beverly Hills,
Calif., news conference, Ashmore said
"they (the North Vietnamese) never
mentioned the four points."
Ashmore described Ho as interested
in the invitation to sent a delegate to
the Geneva Peace Convocation: he had
rejected the idea several months be
fore.
"It would be my own hope, which
is based on no knowledge at all of any
shifting attitudes in Washington," said
Ashmore ". . . that there has been
some moderation in the attitude in
North Vietnam, based on what I saw
and heard from various people there,
the hope that if there is to be any kind
of negotiation for a settlement of that
war, it would take place before our
convocation in Geneva."
Ashmore said he judged from what

he had seen and heard that the ques
tion of an unconditional halt in the
bombing of the North was critical with
regard to peace talk prospects. He
doubted the North would accede to
any negotiation in response to what
looked like coercion.
Recently, British Foreign Secretary
George Brown reported he had a "feel
ing" a change was imminent in the
Vietnam stalemate. To this, Ashmore
commented he detected "a disposition
to compromise and try to negotiate a
settlement." But he could not say
whether that represented a marked
change, or whether the North would
negotiate without presenting condi
tions that Washington would consider
unacceptable.
Bishop Reeves was far less optimis
tic on this point, on which, he said,
"We didn't discover a glimmer of
light." He and his two colleagues is
sued a statement deeply regretting
that "at the moment we have serious
doubts about the possibility of an early
cessation of hostilities."
Baggs, Salisbury, Ashmore and oth
ers of the visitors all saw what they
described as obviously heavily bombed
areas of Nam Dinh, North Vietnam's
third city, south of Hanoi. They re
ported that the two of Phully, also
south of Hanoi on the main highway
to South Vietnam had been virtually
wiped from the map. They reported
seeing blocks of damaged homes in
side Hanoi, too.

south of Hanoi on the main highway
to South Vietnam had been virtually
wiped from the map. They reported
seeing blocks of damaged homes in

In the last month 13 Westerners
eight of them U.S. citizens — have
visited Communist North Vietnam.
In essence, their findings, added to

If there was disagreement on this,
it was a matter of degree. The visitors

observations.
Two of the American visitors were
practicing journalists, another a for

were American women pacifists.
One was a Mexican diplomat and

Points Of Consensus
There was agreement on these
points:
• That the bombing of North Viet
nam had failed in terms of forcing
Hanoi to a peace table.
• That the North Vietnamese ap
pear determined to outlast the United
States, and confident that their stay
ing powers in a "protracted war" are
greater than the U.S. will to continue
the conflict.
• That U.S. bombing of the North,
whatever its effectiveness in interdict
ing supplies and troops movements
to the South, had caused fairly heavy
damage to civilian areas, including
areas inside Hanoi. All saw substant

ially the same areas and brought back
sustantially the same reports.
• That an unconditional halt in the
bombings would be a prerequisite to
any talks—but none could say that
this would lead to talks.
• That North Vietnam believes in
the long run it is: going to win, even
though it may be aware that it lacks
the strength to push the American
military might out of Vietnam, and
that Hanoi is willing to fight on for
many years, if necessary.
Disagree On Talks
The key area of disagreement—if it
could be called thEit—lay in the pro
spects for peace talks, and this dis
agreement was orly a matter of de
gree. One visitor was encouraged by
a possible shift in Hanoi's attitude, but
another saw not even a glimmer of
hope for a break in the stalemate.
The fact that so many Americans
were admitted to North Vietnam at
this particular time stirred consider
able interest in the possible motives.
From the accounts; of the visitors
themselves, it would appear that these
motives involve less any significant
change of attitude but more an eager
ness to spread before the outside
world Hanoi's complaints about U.S.
bombings. It is known that East Euro
pean Communists andi others had been
urging the Hanoi regime to receive
visitors from the west.
Actually, these were not the first
Westerners welcomed by the Hanoi

regime. There had been others, such
as Prof. Staughton Lynd of Yale Uni
versity, who in December, 1965, defied
a U.S. Government ban on such visits
to go to Hanoi as a sponsor of a war.
The difference in the last month has
been that the North Vietnamese re
gime has admitted some who lacked
such clearcut causes.
The first of the 13 Westerners was
Harrison E. Salisbury, an assistant
managing editor of the New York
Times, who spent two weeks in and

with the Center for Study of Demo

Premier Talks
Salisbury generated some excite
ment January 3 with an interview
with the Communist Premier, Pham
Van Dong, whom "Salisbury repre
sented as stressing that the North's
"four points" for a Vietnam settle
ment were not to be considered "con
ditions" for talks, but as providing a
"basis for settlement of the Vietnam
problem." The "four points" are an
all-or-nothing stand demanding with
drawal of the United States and settle
ment of the war "in accordance with
the program of the National Libera
tion Front,' the political front of the
Communist Viet Cong.
A few days later, Salisbury, noting
the wave of speculation aroused by
the interview, presented an expanded
version of the Premier's remarks
which said the four points should not
be considered as conditions but "mere
ly truths," and adding that "we must

come to a solution on the basis of
the four points."
He added a fifth point, too: "to de
mand that the United States put, un
conditionally and for good, an end to
the bombing and all hostile activity
against the North." This seemed to
chill the hopes of those who had de
tected some change in Hanoi's atti
tude.
More Speculation
However, when Ashmore and Baggs
saw President Ho Chi Minh and other
North Vietnamese leaders, specula
tion was revived. Ashmore reported
the North Vietnamese "did not make
an issue" of the four points. Indeed,
at one juncture in the Beverly Hills,
Calif., news conference, Ashmore said
"they (the North Vietnamese) never
mentioned the four points."
Ashmore described Ho as interested
in the invitation to sent a delegate to
the Geneva Peace Convocation: he had
rejected the idea several months be
fore.
"It would be my own hope, which
is based on no knowledge at all of any
shifting attitudes in Washington," said
Ashmore ". . . that there has been
some moderation in the attitude in
North Vietnam, based on what I saw
and heard from various people there,
the hope that if there is to be any kind
of negotiation for a settlement of that
war, it would take place before our
convocation in Geneva."
Ashmore said he judged from what

he had seen and heard that the ques
tion of an unconditional halt in the
bombing of the North was critical with
regard to peace talk prospects. He
doubted the North would accede to
any negotiation in response to what
looked like coercion.
Recently, British Foreign Secretary
George Brown reported he had a "feel
ing" a change was imminent in the
Vietnam stalemate. To this, Ashmore
commented he detected "a disposition
to compromise and try to negotiate a
settlement." But he could not say
whether that represented a marked
change, or whether the North would
negotiate without presenting condi
tions that Washington would consider
unacceptable.
Bishop Reeves was far less optimis

Ashmore said he judged from what

he had seen and heard that the ques

bombing of the North was critical with
regard to peace talk prospects. He
doubted the North would accede to
any negotiation in response to what
looked like coercion.
Recently, British Foreign Secretary

Vietnam stalemate. To this, Ashmore
commented he detected "a disposition

whether that represented a marked

"We didn't discover a glimmer of

Baggs, Salisbury, Ashmore and oth
ers of the visitors all saw what they
described as obviously heavily bombed
areas of Nam Dinh, North Vietnam's
third city, south of Hanoi. They re
ported that the two of Phully, also
south of Hanoi on the main highway
to South Vietnam had been virtually
wiped from the map. They reported
seeing blocks of damaged homes in
side Hanoi, too.
In the last month 13 Westerners
eight of them U.S. citizens — have
visited Communist North Vietnam.
In essence, their findings, added to
gether, seemed to puncture the idea
that the Communist North is ready
to talk, short of a U.S. surrender on
terms Washington refuses to accept.
If there was disagreement on this,
it was a matter of degree. The visitors
were in agreement on most of their
observations.
Two of the American visitors were
practicing journalists, another a for
mer newsman. Four of the visitors
were American women pacifists.
One was a Mexican diplomat and
five were clergymen.
Points Of Consensus
There was agreement on these
points:
• That the bombing of North Viet
nam had failed in terms of forcing
Hanoi to a peace table.
• That the North Vietnamese ap
pear determined to outlast the United
States, and confident that their stay
ing powers in a "protracted war" are
greater than the U.S. will to continue
the conflict.
• That U.S. bombing of the North,
whatever its effectiveness in interdict
ing supplies and troops movements
to the South, had caused fairly heavy
damage to civilian areas, including
areas inside Hanoi. All saw substant

ially the same areas and brought back
sustantially the same reports.
• That an unconditional halt in the
bombings would be a prerequisite to
any talks—but none could say that
this would lead to talks.
• That North Vietnam believes in
the long run it is: going to win, even
though it may be aware that it lacks
the strength to push the American
military might out of Vietnam, and
that Hanoi is willing to fight on for
many years, if necessary.
Disagree On Talks
The key area of disagreement—if it
could be called thEit—lay in the pro
spects for peace talks, and this dis
agreement was orly a matter of de
gree. One visitor was encouraged by
a possible shift in Hanoi's attitude, but
another saw not even a glimmer of
hope for a break in the stalemate.
The fact that so many Americans
were admitted to North Vietnam at
this particular time stirred consider
able interest in the possible motives.
From the accounts; of the visitors
themselves, it would appear that these
motives involve less any significant
change of attitude but more an eager
ness to spread before the outside
world Hanoi's complaints about U.S.
bombings. It is known that East Euro
pean Communists andi others had been
urging the Hanoi regime to receive
visitors from the west.
Actually, these were not the first
Westerners welcomed by the Hanoi

regime. There had been others, such
as Prof. Staughton Lynd of Yale Uni
versity, who in December, 1965, defied
a U.S. Government ban on such visits
to go to Hanoi as a sponsor of a war.
The difference in the last month has
been that the North Vietnamese re
gime has admitted some who lacked
such clearcut causes.
The first of the 13 Westerners was
Harrison E. Salisbury, an assistant
managing editor of the New York
Times, who spent two weeks in and

Premier Talks
Salisbury generated some excite

with the Communist Premier, Pham
Van Dong, whom "Salisbury repre
sented as stressing that the North's
"four points" for a Vietnam settle
ment were not to be considered "con
ditions" for talks, but as providing a
"basis for settlement of the Vietnam
problem." The "four points" are an
all-or-nothing stand demanding with
drawal of the United States and settle
ment of the war "in accordance with
the program of the National Libera
tion Front,' the political front of the
Communist Viet Cong.
A few days later, Salisbury, noting
the wave of speculation aroused by
the interview, presented an expanded
version of the Premier's remarks
which said the four points should not
be considered as conditions but "mere
ly truths," and adding that "we must

come to a solution on the basis of
the four points."
He added a fifth point, too: "to de
mand that the United States put, un
conditionally and for good, an end to
the bombing and all hostile activity
against the North." This seemed to
chill the hopes of those who had de
tected some change in Hanoi's atti
tude.

However, when Ashmore and Baggs
saw President Ho Chi Minh and other
North Vietnamese leaders, specula

the North Vietnamese "did not make
an issue" of the four points. Indeed,
at one juncture in the Beverly Hills,
Calif., news conference, Ashmore said
"they (the North Vietnamese) never
mentioned the four points."
Ashmore described Ho as interested
in the invitation to sent a delegate to
the Geneva Peace Convocation: he had
rejected the idea several months be
fore.
"It would be my own hope, which
is based on no knowledge at all of any
shifting attitudes in Washington," said
Ashmore ". . . that there has been
some moderation in the attitude in
North Vietnam, based on what I saw

More Speculation
However, when Ashmore and Baggs
saw President Ho Chi Minh and other
North Vietnamese leaders, specula
tion was revived. Ashmore reported
the North Vietnamese "did not make
an issue" of the four points. Indeed,
at one juncture in the Beverly Hills,
Calif., news conference, Ashmore said
"they (the North Vietnamese) never
mentioned the four points."
Ashmore described Ho as interested
in the invitation to sent a delegate to
the Geneva Peace Convocation: he had
rejected the idea several months be
fore.
"It would be my own hope, which
is based on no knowledge at all of any
shifting attitudes in Washington," said
Ashmore ". . . that there has been
some moderation in the attitude in
North Vietnam, based on what I saw
and heard from various people there,
the hope that if there is to be any kind
of negotiation for a settlement of that
war, it would take place before our
convocation in Geneva."
Ashmore said he judged from what

he had seen and heard that the ques
tion of an unconditional halt in the
bombing of the North was critical with
regard to peace talk prospects. He
doubted the North would accede to
any negotiation in response to what
looked like coercion.
Recently, British Foreign Secretary
George Brown reported he had a "feel
ing" a change was imminent in the
Vietnam stalemate. To this, Ashmore
commented he detected "a disposition
to compromise and try to negotiate a
settlement." But he could not say
whether that represented a marked
change, or whether the North would
negotiate without presenting condi
tions that Washington would consider
unacceptable.
Bishop Reeves was far less optimis
tic on this point, on which, he said,
"We didn't discover a glimmer of
light." He and his two colleagues is
sued a statement deeply regretting
that "at the moment we have serious
doubts about the possibility of an early
cessation of hostilities."
Baggs, Salisbury, Ashmore and oth
ers of the visitors all saw what they
described as obviously heavily bombed
areas of Nam Dinh, North Vietnam's
third city, south of Hanoi. They re
ported that the two of Phully, also
south of Hanoi on the main highway
to South Vietnam had been virtually
wiped from the map. They reported
seeing blocks of damaged homes in
side Hanoi, too.
In the last month 13 Westerners
eight of them U.S. citizens — have
visited Communist North Vietnam.
In essence, their findings, added to
gether, seemed to puncture the idea
that the Communist North is ready
to talk, short of a U.S. surrender on
terms Washington refuses to accept.
If there was disagreement on this,
it was a matter of degree. The visitors
were in agreement on most of their
observations.
Two of the American visitors were
practicing journalists, another a for
mer newsman. Four of the visitors
were American women pacifists.
One was a Mexican diplomat and
five were clergymen.
Points Of Consensus
There was agreement on these
points:
• That the bombing of North Viet
nam had failed in terms of forcing
Hanoi to a peace table.
• That the North Vietnamese ap
pear determined to outlast the United
States, and confident that their stay
ing powers in a "protracted war" are
greater than the U.S. will to continue
the conflict.
• That U.S. bombing of the North,
whatever its effectiveness in interdict
ing supplies and troops movements
to the South, had caused fairly heavy
damage to civilian areas, including
areas inside Hanoi. All saw substant

ially the same areas and brought back
sustantially the same reports.
• That an unconditional halt in the
bombings would be a prerequisite to
any talks—but none could say that
this would lead to talks.
• That North Vietnam believes in
the long run it is: going to win, even
though it may be aware that it lacks
the strength to push the American
military might out of Vietnam, and
that Hanoi is willing to fight on for
many years, if necessary.
Disagree On Talks
The key area of disagreement—if it
could be called thEit—lay in the pro
spects for peace talks, and this dis
agreement was orly a matter of de

a possible shift in Hanoi's attitude, but
another saw not even a glimmer of
hope for a break in the stalemate.
The fact that so many Americans
were admitted to North Vietnam at
this particular time stirred consider
able interest in the possible motives.
From the accounts; of the visitors
themselves, it would appear that these
motives involve less any significant
change of attitude but more an eager
ness to spread before the outside
world Hanoi's complaints about U.S.
bombings. It is known that East Euro
pean Communists andi others had been
urging the Hanoi regime to receive
visitors from the west.
Actually, these were not the first
Westerners welcomed by the Hanoi

regime. There had been others, such
as Prof. Staughton Lynd of Yale Uni
versity, who in December, 1965, defied
a U.S. Government ban on such visits
to go to Hanoi as a sponsor of a war.
The difference in the last month has
been that the North Vietnamese re

such clearcut causes.

"four points" for a Vietnam settle

all-or-nothing stand demanding with
drawal of the United States and settle
ment of the war "in accordance with
the program of the National Libera
tion Front,' the political front of the
Communist Viet Cong.
A few days later, Salisbury, noting
the wave of speculation aroused by
the interview, presented an expanded
version of the Premier's remarks
which said the four points should not
be considered as conditions but "mere
ly truths," and adding that "we must

come to a solution on the basis of
the four points."
He added a fifth point, too: "to de
mand that the United States put, un
conditionally and for good, an end to
the bombing and all hostile activity
against the North." This seemed to

drawal of the United States and settle
ment of the war "in accordance with
the program of the National Libera
tion Front,' the political front of the
Communist Viet Cong.
A few days later, Salisbury, noting
the wave of speculation aroused by
the interview, presented an expanded
version of the Premier's remarks
which said the four points should not
be considered as conditions but "mere
ly truths," and adding that "we must

come to a solution on the basis of
the four points."
He added a fifth point, too: "to de
mand that the United States put, un
conditionally and for good, an end to
the bombing and all hostile activity
against the North." This seemed to
chill the hopes of those who had de
tected some change in Hanoi's atti
tude.
More Speculation
However, when Ashmore and Baggs
saw President Ho Chi Minh and other
North Vietnamese leaders, specula
tion was revived. Ashmore reported
the North Vietnamese "did not make
an issue" of the four points. Indeed,
at one juncture in the Beverly Hills,
Calif., news conference, Ashmore said
"they (the North Vietnamese) never
mentioned the four points."
Ashmore described Ho as interested
in the invitation to sent a delegate to
the Geneva Peace Convocation: he had
rejected the idea several months be
fore.
"It would be my own hope, which
is based on no knowledge at all of any
shifting attitudes in Washington," said
Ashmore ". . . that there has been
some moderation in the attitude in
North Vietnam, based on what I saw
and heard from various people there,
the hope that if there is to be any kind
of negotiation for a settlement of that
war, it would take place before our
convocation in Geneva."
Ashmore said he judged from what

he had seen and heard that the ques
tion of an unconditional halt in the
bombing of the North was critical with
regard to peace talk prospects. He
doubted the North would accede to
any negotiation in response to what
looked like coercion.
Recently, British Foreign Secretary
George Brown reported he had a "feel
ing" a change was imminent in the
Vietnam stalemate. To this, Ashmore
commented he detected "a disposition
to compromise and try to negotiate a
settlement." But he could not say
whether that represented a marked
change, or whether the North would
negotiate without presenting condi
tions that Washington would consider
unacceptable.
Bishop Reeves was far less optimis
tic on this point, on which, he said,
"We didn't discover a glimmer of
light." He and his two colleagues is
sued a statement deeply regretting
that "at the moment we have serious
doubts about the possibility of an early
cessation of hostilities."
Baggs, Salisbury, Ashmore and oth
ers of the visitors all saw what they
described as obviously heavily bombed
areas of Nam Dinh, North Vietnam's
third city, south of Hanoi. They re
ported that the two of Phully, also
south of Hanoi on the main highway
to South Vietnam had been virtually
wiped from the map. They reported
seeing blocks of damaged homes in
side Hanoi, too.
