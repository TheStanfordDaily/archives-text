# Conflict Over Johnson Satire Brings Student Paper Probe
## 
### 
(CPS)—The Johns Hopkins Uni
versity student government will
jinvestigate the undergraduate
newspaper, the Newsletter, fol
lowing the suspension and rein
statement of the paper's editors
for publishing a bitter satire of
President Johnson last week.
The editors, Henry Korn and
Melvin Shuster, were suspended
from school for two days by Uni
versity President Milton Eisen
hower after publishing an article
which listed President Lyndon
Johnson among the top "mass
murderers" of the year. They
were reinstated in school last
Monday following a meeting
with school administrators dur
ing which the editors expressed
"regret" for printing the satire.
Following a meeting between
the two editors with Eisenhower
and University Dean William
Shaffer on Monday, the adminis
trators decided to send the case
to the student government,

which has the power to remove
t.he editors from their positions
on the paper.
Johnson Called Killer
The satire, which was not writ
ten by either of the editors, ac
cused President Johnson of kill
ing John F. Kennedy, Lee Har
vey Oswald, Jack Ruby, and
"thirteen other people whose
names have been withheld on
request."
The article, appearing on page
five, listed President Johnson
on a "Man of the Year" ballot
along with Charles Whitman,
the Texas slayer; Richard Spi3ck,
the accused Chicago mass mur
derer; and the Cincinnati si ran
gier, who was listed on the bal
lot with a question mark.
The article said "last year's
top mass murderer was a Texas
plowboy who has come a long
way in the American crime busi
ness.

"Johnson, an easy-going ex
school teacher whose hobby is
bombing defenseless people,
culminated a remarkable five
years when on December 25 he
told Jack Ruby to suddenly die
of cancer."
Students Surprised
Reaction from several students
was one of surprise that the
editors were suspended, although
they said the article was in bad
taste.
"In the present case," Student
Body President Bill Reinsch
said, "there is no one to whom
the editor is responsible, yet the
University is responsible for the
paper."
Fully reinstated, both Korn
and Shuster expressed satisfac
tion with the outcome of the
controversy. "The whole con
troversy over the article was
equitably and amicably resolved
with complete understanding
between the administration and
the editors," Shuster said.
SDS Leads Protest
The suspension of the editors
did, however, spark protests
from students, led by the cam
pus Students for a Democratic
Society. SDS circulated a petition
signed by almost 150 students in
protest against the suspension.
The action against the editors,
the petition said, was a "flagrant
violation of rights of freedom
of speech and freedom of the
press as well as the infringe
ment of the independence of stu
dent organizations. . .
The petition also contended
that the administration's action
was "obviously politically mo

Students Surprised
Reaction from several students
was one of surprise that the
editors were suspended, although
they said the article was in bad
taste.
"In the present case," Student
Body President Bill Reinsch
said, "there is no one to whom
the editor is responsible, yet the
University is responsible for the
paper."
Fully reinstated, both Korn
and Shuster expressed satisfac
tion with the outcome of the
controversy. "The whole con
troversy over the article was
equitably and amicably resolved
with complete understanding
between the administration and
the editors," Shuster said.
SDS Leads Protest
The suspension of the editors
did, however, spark protests
from students, led by the cam
pus Students for a Democratic
Society. SDS circulated a petition
signed by almost 150 students in
protest against the suspension.
The action against the editors,
the petition said, was a "flagrant
violation of rights of freedom
of speech and freedom of the
press as well as the infringe
ment of the independence of stu
dent organizations. . .
The petition also contended
that the administration's action
was "obviously politically mo

for publishing a bitter satire of
President Johnson last week.
The editors, Henry Korn and
Melvin Shuster, were suspended
from school for two days by Uni

hower after publishing an article
which listed President Lyndon
Johnson among the top "mass
murderers" of the year. They
were reinstated in school last
Monday following a meeting
with school administrators dur

"regret" for printing the satire.
Following a meeting between
the two editors with Eisenhower

to the student government,

which has the power to remove

Johnson Called Killer
The satire, which was not writ

cused President Johnson of kill
ing John F. Kennedy, Lee Har

"thirteen other people whose
names have been withheld on
request."
The article, appearing on page
five, listed President Johnson
on a "Man of the Year" ballot
along with Charles Whitman,
the Texas slayer; Richard Spi3ck,
the accused Chicago mass mur
derer; and the Cincinnati si ran
gier, who was listed on the bal
lot with a question mark.
The article said "last year's
top mass murderer was a Texas
plowboy who has come a long
way in the American crime busi

bombing defenseless people,
