# FRATERNITIES
## Toward A Merger Of Social And Academic 
### CARL MUNDT 
It is clear to me, as the 1967
academic year progresses, that
critical discussion and investi
gation must begin dealing with
the role of the various living
groups at Stanford and with
their success or failure as edu
cational institutions.
Increasingly, concern at Stan
ford about these problems is
confined to emotional vendettas
following an attack by fraternity
members upon the student body
president or to sporadic protests
against the isolation of fresh
men in the University commu
nity. Plainly, there is no general
awareness on the part of Stan
ford students of the educational
opportunities which might be
provided by a living group.

The situation may be clarified.
In the mind of the student body
there exists a strict separation
between intellectual life, i.e. the
classroom, and social life, i.e. the
living group. Thus the living
group, be it a house in Stern
Hall, Toyon Hall, a women's resi
dence, or a fraternity house, all
too often becomes a refuge from
the intellectual life of the Quad.
The living group is for social
and athletic life, the classroom
for intellectual life. This dicho
tomy is a very serious develop
ment indeed. In fact, it is a
threat to the educational pro
cess, the benefits of which are
certainly the goal of every sin
cere student.
Possibilities
The problem then becomes one
of arousing student interest for
modifying the role of living
groups and for devoting energy
to the study of living groups
as educational institutions. The
fjossibilities for a living group
n which intellectual life is com
bined with social life are stag
gering.
To quote from a report pre
pared at Amherst College in
1964 entitled Report of the Sub
committee to Study Student
Life, "What fraternity house
can now find room to offer an
an exciting collection of records

and the privacy in which to listen
to them, an up-to-date non-aca
demic library and varied periodi
cals, a dark room and develop
ing equipment, a small studio
with materials for painting and
sculpting, a good collection of
old films and a place for showing
them, a wood working shop, a
little theater, or a good game
room, perhaps a suite for visi
tors, or even the facilities for
after-dinner coffee?"
I think it must be obvious to
every reader that this same
question might be asked at Stan
ford with regard to any living
group. Few, if any, groups at
Stanford offer such facilities.
To quote further: "Too sel
dom is there a large enough
minority to attempt a dramatic
skit, a musical performance, a
poetry reading, a political action
or debate, a trip to Boston or
New York, a hike across the
Holyoke Range, a publication,
or simply an evening in some
one's room with an invited fac
ulty guest."
Fundamental Problem
Here again the best most liv
ing groups at Stanford can point
to are infrequent efforts along
these lines of intelligent dis
cussions or of cultural enrich
ment.
I am firmly convinced that the
barren living group arrange
ments at Stanford stem from
the fundamental problem—that
of a complete separation of so
cial life from intellectual life.
The result of this separation is
that faculty-student interactions,
cultural programs and intellec
tual involvement are divorced
from the living group because
the living group, in most cases,
functions solely as a social and
athletic center.
Thus the dilemma for this
generation of students is clear.
A method must be found for
making living groups intellec
tual groups as well, from the
Wilbur House, to the Florence
Moore House, to the fraternity
house.
It seems to me that there are
two main areas in which the
problem may be attacked. First
is that of the grading system.
As long as Stanford maintains
a strict system of grades, class
room learning and intellectual
life will be inseparably linked.
This linkage occurs in the fol
lowing manner. The pressure on
students at the present time for
grade-achievement leading to
graduate school or employment

is intense. Living groups have
relatively little effect on this
achievement because the achieve
ments of learning, i.e. grades,
are found only in the classroom,
and the living group in general
has no direct connection with
learning.
If, however, the University
were to gradually change to a
widespread pass-fail system, as

would seem to be the trend pres
ently, intellectual life in living
groups could be increasingly
fostered. With such a change the
student could concentrate on in
tellectual growth in the living
group free from the pressure of
grade-achievement. From a pure
ly pragmatic standpoint it is
apparent that the living group,
which claims much more of the
student's time than the class
room, would be the most efficient
source of intellectual inter
change.
The Variables
The second area of attack lies
in the actual character of living
groups as to size, selection pro
cedures, composition, location,
etc. It is clear to me that these
variables should be manipulated
to create living groups in which
the maximum wedding of intel
lectual and social life takes place.
The experiment in the Phi Delt
house is an example of this pro
cess in its infancy. Clearly no
one solution will be found as to
size, selection procedure, compo
sition, and location. Rather, a
wide choice of living groups
would be available, all of which
afforded a viable combination of
intellectual and social life, yet
each maintaining its own unique
emphasis or orientation.
Clearly, however, this second
area of attack involves consid
erable re-evaluation by existing
living groups and by interested
students.
The actual effect of the vari
ables mentioned above upon pos
sible intellectual social interac
tion must be determined before

any action can be taken. This
is especially important because
the internal cohesion of any liv
ing group can be dangerously
disrupted through hurried at
tempts at reform. Cohesion is
possible only through the exis
tence of some common interest,
goal or orientation on the part
of a significant percentage of the
group. Without this cohesion

Carl Munclt, a senior history major, is the newly elected presi
dent of Alpha Sigma Phi. In his appraisal of the current system of
rush and fraternity living, he underscores the educational potential
of the living group while citing the "sad tale" of the present rush
procedures. Mundt prepared his article during the Christinas
break after extensive discussion with fraternity leaders, faculty
men, and administrators.

the term "intellectual inter
change" is not applicable for, in
its absence, there is no incentive
or likelihood of worthwhile rela
tionships forming.
Cohesiveness
Nevertheless, cohesion can be
fostered by a great variety of
factors such as: interest in liv
ing at one of the overseas cam
puses, interest in participating in
the Phi Delt experiment or de
sire to be associated with the
social program of a women's
row house. Cohesion, in the final
analysis, is what allows a living
group to function as a group.
No significant amount of re
sponsibility can be delegated
within the group and no abun
dance of beneficial interpersonal
contacts will develop without it.
As a member of a Stanford
fraternity my main interest is
obviously with the effect which
a change in the size, selection
procedures and composition of
the group would have on the
character of the fraternity sys
tem. Fraternities have perhaps
the greatest amount of cohesion
of any type of living group at
Stanford. I would object stren
uously to any attempts at change
which would destroy the cohe
sion in a fraternity house or
any other living arrangement
on the Stanford campus.
Yet it is also very clear to me
that changes are necessary
within the fraternity system. As
presently constituted the system
is generally lacking in intellec
tual and cultural life, and offers
mainly social and athletic exper
iences.

Hqpefully, I have presented a
cleai problem. There exists a
dichotomy at Stanford between
intel '.ectual and social life. A now
grading system is one remedy.
Mor ; germaine to the topic of
this article is the second remedy
—that of manipulating the char
acter of living groups ,and par
ticularly fraternities, in the areas
of size, selection procedures, etc.
The' effect which these changes
havie on the essential quality of
cohesion must also retain an
important role in any investiga
tion.
lln general it is true that
chjj.nges suggested and carried
out from within the fraternity
system have a greater chance
of success and acceptance than
those originating in other
sources. In fact, the greatest
challenge to the fraternity sys
tem is this obligation to its
members to unify intellectual
stimulation and social life from
w Ithin.
In the years ahead Stanford
fraternities will be faced with a
membership crises in two ways:
i: the freshmen become increas
ingly sceptical of the benefits of
fraternity life; and 2) construc
ti on of the new clusters will
fc rce fraternities to expand their
membership to fill the larger
lif/ing plants. Happily, fraterni
ti ?s are in a position to answer
these challenges (as well as the
greater one of lack of intellec
tual atmosphere), because they
inherently process a great de
gree of cohesion and thus the
a pility to channel their energies
toward specific goals.
IThe central question to be
answered is, "What changes
njiust be made to insure the
union of social and intellectual
li fe?"
The main area in which the
character of a fraternity af
fects its intellectual atmosphere
ifc the composition of the group
(who is a member and who is
rot), and indirectly, the method
ii which outsiders join the group
(ithe selection process).
Rush's Sad Tale
Rush, then, is a topic which
: raternities must investigate if
ihey intend to survive as educa
tional institutions. Even a partial
litudy of rush reveals a sad tale
of mediocrity and lack of direc
tion.
To put it bluntly, rush, as it
jjs presently constituted, does not
select for intellectual values. On
the contrary, the intellectual
Capabilities of a rushee are large

ly irrelevant to his success or
failure as a prospective frater
nity brother.
What rush does select for is
social grace and poise. That this
neglect of the intellectual i:
favor of the social is present in
rush can hardly be contested.
Rush week is a series of social
encounters (parties, open houses,
etc.),, during which the socially
comfortable rushee stands out.
The effect which this separation
of intellectual and social has o'i
the living after rush is obvious.
The separation is carried over
as an important characteristic
of the group and the dichotomy
between living group and class
room is strengthened.
The solution is clear. Rush
must either combine intellectual
and social criteria or be replaced
by some substitute which will.
As far as I am concerned, judg
ment by a living group of a
rushee's intellectual ability will
be very difficult to combine with
judgment of his social ability.
This combination is impractical
because of the broad ramifica
tions which the term "intellec
tual ability" includes.
For a living group to attempt
to pass judgment on a rushee's
intellect merely on the basis of
casual encounters during rush
week is simply not feasible.
When one takes into account
the amount of time available
and the number of rushees, the
impossibility of rationally judg
ing each one individually on the
basis of social and intellectual
criteria becomes clear.
Self-Selection
A second solution, and one
which fraternity men have his
torically avoided, is the concept
living group by the rushee. Un
der this system each fraternity
would judge itself as to its
unique orientation and emphasu
in social and intellectual life.
The result of this judgment
would be available to the rushee
through a pamphlet or maga
zine, etc. In turn each rushee
would examine himself and de
termine his own personal intel
lectual and social pattern. I'
would then be a simple matter
for the rushee to choose the liv
ing group which best suited him.
The benefiits of self-judgment
by the living group and rushee
as compared with judgment of
each other are obvious. Fraterni
ties can easily take the lead in
this publication process and
other living groups might fol-
low. The end result would be a
system in which the rushee ra
tionally choose his place of resi
dence on the basis of personal
contact and pamphlets published
by every living group on cam
pus.
Clearly the above proposal
would abolish many facets of
rush as practiced today. With
final choice resting with the
rushee rather than the living
group much of the harmful
psychological pressure on indi
vidual rushees would be avoided.
The social atmosphere and
events of rush week, which
would be maintained, would nec
essarily be more relaxed. Most
important of all, however, is the
union of social and intellectual
criteria into one stream which
might be a major step along the
road to making all living groups

true educational institutions.
Flaw Of Bush
The argument may be raised
that abolishing the right of selec
tion by the fraternity will also
abolish the cohesion and "broth
erhood" which makes fraternity
life unique. While it is true that
cohesion is vital for the function
ing of a group as to social and
intellectual programs, it would
be difficult to show how rush it
self created this cohesion.
Rather, it is common interests
or goals which create cohesion
and these are perhaps more ef
ficiently selected for under the
above proposal, by which a
rushee chooses a living group
whose social and intellectual in
terests are similar to his own.
It would be difficult to con
clude a discussion of the pres
ent selection process at Stan

ford without mentioning the
moral implications involved. For
too long fraternity men have
ignored the psychological harm
of rush or brushed it off with "it
happens every day in the out
side world." The time has come
for the realization that passing
judgment on a person's social
poise after short aquaintance
may be a dangerous relic of the
past. I personally know of far
too many cases in which rushees
were deeply shaken by rejection
during rush. The irony of the
matter is that often the re
jection is made on totally in
valid grounds. The ultimate
q u e s t i on concerns a living
group's right to judge an indi
vidual's social worth under any
circumstances.
Conclusion
Hopefully, the above approach
is not overly dogmatic with re

gard to the role of living groups
at Stanford. I do not claim that
my proposal is the only valid
method of uniting social and in
tellectual life in Stanford fra
ternities and in other living
groups as well. There should he
no one solution but a wide range
of choices open to students— fra
ternities, independent housing,
the Grove experiment, coeduca
tional housing, etc. Each must
solve the problem of separation
of social and intellectual life in
its own unique manner. Fra
ternities are in a position to
take the lead, through internal
changes, in the reform of hous
ing at Stanford. As with any re
form, the solution at Stanford
must begin with awareness of
the problem and then interested
students must devote their tal
ents to finding a workable solu
tion.
It is clear to me, as the 1967
academic year progresses, that
critical discussion and investi
gation must begin dealing with
the role of the various living
groups at Stanford and with
their success or failure as edu
cational institutions.

between intellectual life, i.e. the
classroom, and social life, i.e. the
living group. Thus the living
group, be it a house in Stern
Hall, Toyon Hall, a women's resi
dence, or a fraternity house, all
too often becomes a refuge from
the intellectual life of the Quad.
The living group is for social
and athletic life, the classroom
for intellectual life. This dicho
tomy is a very serious develop
ment indeed. In fact, it is a
threat to the educational pro
cess, the benefits of which are
certainly the goal of every sin
cere student.
Possibilities
The problem then becomes one
of arousing student interest for
modifying the role of living
groups and for devoting energy
to the study of living groups
as educational institutions. The
fjossibilities for a living group
n which intellectual life is com
bined with social life are stag
gering.
To quote from a report pre
pared at Amherst College in
1964 entitled Report of the Sub
committee to Study Student
Life, "What fraternity house
can now find room to offer an
an exciting collection of records

and the privacy in which to listen
to them, an up-to-date non-aca
demic library and varied periodi
cals, a dark room and develop
ing equipment, a small studio
with materials for painting and
sculpting, a good collection of
old films and a place for showing
them, a wood working shop, a
little theater, or a good game
room, perhaps a suite for visi
tors, or even the facilities for
after-dinner coffee?"
I think it must be obvious to
every reader that this same
question might be asked at Stan
ford with regard to any living
group. Few, if any, groups at
Stanford offer such facilities.
To quote further: "Too sel
dom is there a large enough
minority to attempt a dramatic
skit, a musical performance, a
poetry reading, a political action
or debate, a trip to Boston or
New York, a hike across the
Holyoke Range, a publication,
or simply an evening in some
one's room with an invited fac
ulty guest."
Fundamental Problem
Here again the best most liv
ing groups at Stanford can point
to are infrequent efforts along
these lines of intelligent dis
cussions or of cultural enrich
ment.
I am firmly convinced that the
barren living group arrange
ments at Stanford stem from
the fundamental problem—that
of a complete separation of so
cial life from intellectual life.
The result of this separation is
that faculty-student interactions,
cultural programs and intellec
tual involvement are divorced
from the living group because
the living group, in most cases,
functions solely as a social and
athletic center.
Thus the dilemma for this
generation of students is clear.
A method must be found for
making living groups intellec
tual groups as well, from the
Wilbur House, to the Florence
Moore House, to the fraternity
house.
It seems to me that there are
two main areas in which the
problem may be attacked. First
is that of the grading system.
As long as Stanford maintains
a strict system of grades, class
room learning and intellectual
life will be inseparably linked.
This linkage occurs in the fol
lowing manner. The pressure on
students at the present time for
grade-achievement leading to
graduate school or employment

is intense. Living groups have
relatively little effect on this
achievement because the achieve
ments of learning, i.e. grades,
are found only in the classroom,
and the living group in general
has no direct connection with
learning.
If, however, the University
were to gradually change to a
widespread pass-fail system, as

would seem to be the trend pres
ently, intellectual life in living
groups could be increasingly
fostered. With such a change the
student could concentrate on in
tellectual growth in the living
group free from the pressure of
grade-achievement. From a pure
ly pragmatic standpoint it is
apparent that the living group,
which claims much more of the
student's time than the class
room, would be the most efficient
source of intellectual inter
change.
The Variables
The second area of attack lies
in the actual character of living
groups as to size, selection pro
cedures, composition, location,
etc. It is clear to me that these
variables should be manipulated
to create living groups in which
the maximum wedding of intel
lectual and social life takes place.
The experiment in the Phi Delt
house is an example of this pro
cess in its infancy. Clearly no
one solution will be found as to
size, selection procedure, compo
sition, and location. Rather, a
wide choice of living groups
would be available, all of which
afforded a viable combination of
intellectual and social life, yet
each maintaining its own unique
emphasis or orientation.
Clearly, however, this second
area of attack involves consid
erable re-evaluation by existing
living groups and by interested
students.
The actual effect of the vari
ables mentioned above upon pos
sible intellectual social interac
tion must be determined before

any action can be taken. This
is especially important because
the internal cohesion of any liv
ing group can be dangerously
disrupted through hurried at
tempts at reform. Cohesion is
possible only through the exis
tence of some common interest,
goal or orientation on the part
of a significant percentage of the
group. Without this cohesion

Carl Munclt, a senior history major, is the newly elected presi
dent of Alpha Sigma Phi. In his appraisal of the current system of
rush and fraternity living, he underscores the educational potential
of the living group while citing the "sad tale" of the present rush
procedures. Mundt prepared his article during the Christinas
break after extensive discussion with fraternity leaders, faculty
men, and administrators.

the term "intellectual inter
change" is not applicable for, in
its absence, there is no incentive
or likelihood of worthwhile rela
tionships forming.
Cohesiveness
Nevertheless, cohesion can be
fostered by a great variety of
factors such as: interest in liv
ing at one of the overseas cam
puses, interest in participating in
the Phi Delt experiment or de
sire to be associated with the
social program of a women's
row house. Cohesion, in the final
analysis, is what allows a living
group to function as a group.
No significant amount of re
sponsibility can be delegated
within the group and no abun
dance of beneficial interpersonal
contacts will develop without it.
As a member of a Stanford
fraternity my main interest is
obviously with the effect which
a change in the size, selection
procedures and composition of
the group would have on the
character of the fraternity sys
tem. Fraternities have perhaps
the greatest amount of cohesion
of any type of living group at
Stanford. I would object stren
uously to any attempts at change
which would destroy the cohe
sion in a fraternity house or
any other living arrangement
on the Stanford campus.
Yet it is also very clear to me
that changes are necessary
within the fraternity system. As
presently constituted the system
is generally lacking in intellec
tual and cultural life, and offers
mainly social and athletic exper
iences.

Hqpefully, I have presented a
cleai problem. There exists a
dichotomy at Stanford between
intel '.ectual and social life. A now
grading system is one remedy.
Mor ; germaine to the topic of
this article is the second remedy
—that of manipulating the char
acter of living groups ,and par
ticularly fraternities, in the areas
of size, selection procedures, etc.
The' effect which these changes
havie on the essential quality of
cohesion must also retain an
important role in any investiga
tion.
lln general it is true that
chjj.nges suggested and carried
out from within the fraternity
system have a greater chance
of success and acceptance than
those originating in other
sources. In fact, the greatest
challenge to the fraternity sys
tem is this obligation to its
members to unify intellectual
stimulation and social life from
w Ithin.
In the years ahead Stanford
fraternities will be faced with a
membership crises in two ways:
i: the freshmen become increas
ingly sceptical of the benefits of
fraternity life; and 2) construc
ti on of the new clusters will
fc rce fraternities to expand their
membership to fill the larger
lif/ing plants. Happily, fraterni
ti ?s are in a position to answer
these challenges (as well as the
greater one of lack of intellec
tual atmosphere), because they
inherently process a great de
gree of cohesion and thus the
a pility to channel their energies
toward specific goals.
IThe central question to be
answered is, "What changes
njiust be made to insure the
union of social and intellectual
li fe?"
The main area in which the
character of a fraternity af
fects its intellectual atmosphere
ifc the composition of the group
(who is a member and who is
rot), and indirectly, the method
ii which outsiders join the group
(ithe selection process).
Rush's Sad Tale
Rush, then, is a topic which
: raternities must investigate if
ihey intend to survive as educa
tional institutions. Even a partial
litudy of rush reveals a sad tale
of mediocrity and lack of direc
tion.
To put it bluntly, rush, as it
jjs presently constituted, does not
select for intellectual values. On
the contrary, the intellectual
Capabilities of a rushee are large

ly irrelevant to his success or
failure as a prospective frater
nity brother.
What rush does select for is
social grace and poise. That this
neglect of the intellectual i:
favor of the social is present in
rush can hardly be contested.
Rush week is a series of social
encounters (parties, open houses,
etc.),, during which the socially
comfortable rushee stands out.
The effect which this separation
of intellectual and social has o'i
the living after rush is obvious.
The separation is carried over
as an important characteristic
of the group and the dichotomy
between living group and class
room is strengthened.
The solution is clear. Rush
must either combine intellectual
and social criteria or be replaced
by some substitute which will.
As far as I am concerned, judg
ment by a living group of a
rushee's intellectual ability will
be very difficult to combine with
judgment of his social ability.
This combination is impractical
because of the broad ramifica
tions which the term "intellec
tual ability" includes.
For a living group to attempt
to pass judgment on a rushee's
intellect merely on the basis of
casual encounters during rush
week is simply not feasible.
When one takes into account
the amount of time available
and the number of rushees, the
impossibility of rationally judg
ing each one individually on the
basis of social and intellectual
criteria becomes clear.
Self-Selection
A second solution, and one
which fraternity men have his
torically avoided, is the concept
living group by the rushee. Un
der this system each fraternity
would judge itself as to its
unique orientation and emphasu
in social and intellectual life.
The result of this judgment
would be available to the rushee
through a pamphlet or maga
zine, etc. In turn each rushee
would examine himself and de
termine his own personal intel
lectual and social pattern. I'
would then be a simple matter
for the rushee to choose the liv
ing group which best suited him.
The benefiits of self-judgment
by the living group and rushee
as compared with judgment of
each other are obvious. Fraterni
ties can easily take the lead in
this publication process and
other living groups might fol-
low. The end result would be a
system in which the rushee ra
tionally choose his place of resi
dence on the basis of personal
contact and pamphlets published
by every living group on cam
pus.
Clearly the above proposal
would abolish many facets of
rush as practiced today. With
final choice resting with the
rushee rather than the living
group much of the harmful
psychological pressure on indi
vidual rushees would be avoided.
The social atmosphere and
events of rush week, which
would be maintained, would nec
essarily be more relaxed. Most
important of all, however, is the
union of social and intellectual
criteria into one stream which
might be a major step along the
road to making all living groups

true educational institutions.
Flaw Of Bush
The argument may be raised
that abolishing the right of selec
tion by the fraternity will also
abolish the cohesion and "broth
erhood" which makes fraternity
life unique. While it is true that
cohesion is vital for the function
ing of a group as to social and
intellectual programs, it would
be difficult to show how rush it
self created this cohesion.
Rather, it is common interests
or goals which create cohesion
and these are perhaps more ef
ficiently selected for under the
above proposal, by which a
rushee chooses a living group
whose social and intellectual in
terests are similar to his own.
It would be difficult to con
clude a discussion of the pres
ent selection process at Stan

ford without mentioning the
moral implications involved. For
too long fraternity men have
ignored the psychological harm
of rush or brushed it off with "it
happens every day in the out
side world." The time has come
for the realization that passing
judgment on a person's social
poise after short aquaintance
may be a dangerous relic of the
past. I personally know of far
too many cases in which rushees
were deeply shaken by rejection
during rush. The irony of the
matter is that often the re
jection is made on totally in
valid grounds. The ultimate
q u e s t i on concerns a living
group's right to judge an indi
vidual's social worth under any
circumstances.
Conclusion
Hopefully, the above approach
is not overly dogmatic with re

gard to the role of living groups
at Stanford. I do not claim that
my proposal is the only valid
method of uniting social and in
tellectual life in Stanford fra
ternities and in other living
groups as well. There should he
no one solution but a wide range
of choices open to students— fra
ternities, independent housing,
the Grove experiment, coeduca
tional housing, etc. Each must
solve the problem of separation
of social and intellectual life in
its own unique manner. Fra
ternities are in a position to
take the lead, through internal
changes, in the reform of hous
ing at Stanford. As with any re
form, the solution at Stanford
must begin with awareness of
the problem and then interested
students must devote their tal
ents to finding a workable solu
tion.
It is clear to me, as the 1967
academic year progresses, that
critical discussion and investi
gation must begin dealing with
the role of the various living
groups at Stanford and with
their success or failure as edu
cational institutions.
Increasingly, concern at Stan
ford about these problems is
confined to emotional vendettas
following an attack by fraternity
members upon the student body
president or to sporadic protests
against the isolation of fresh
men in the University commu
nity. Plainly, there is no general
awareness on the part of Stan
ford students of the educational
opportunities which might be
provided by a living group.

The situation may be clarified.
In the mind of the student body
there exists a strict separation
between intellectual life, i.e. the
classroom, and social life, i.e. the

fjossibilities for a living group
n which intellectual life is com
bined with social life are stag
gering.
To quote from a report pre
pared at Amherst College in
1964 entitled Report of the Sub
committee to Study Student
Life, "What fraternity house
can now find room to offer an
an exciting collection of records

and the privacy in which to listen
to them, an up-to-date non-aca
demic library and varied periodi
cals, a dark room and develop
ing equipment, a small studio
with materials for painting and
sculpting, a good collection of
old films and a place for showing
them, a wood working shop, a
little theater, or a good game
room, perhaps a suite for visi
tors, or even the facilities for
after-dinner coffee?"
I think it must be obvious to
every reader that this same
question might be asked at Stan
ford with regard to any living
group. Few, if any, groups at
Stanford offer such facilities.
To quote further: "Too sel
dom is there a large enough
minority to attempt a dramatic
skit, a musical performance, a
poetry reading, a political action
or debate, a trip to Boston or
New York, a hike across the
Holyoke Range, a publication,
or simply an evening in some
one's room with an invited fac
ulty guest."
Fundamental Problem
Here again the best most liv
ing groups at Stanford can point
to are infrequent efforts along
these lines of intelligent dis
cussions or of cultural enrich
ment.
I am firmly convinced that the
barren living group arrange
ments at Stanford stem from
the fundamental problem—that
of a complete separation of so
cial life from intellectual life.
The result of this separation is
that faculty-student interactions,
cultural programs and intellec
tual involvement are divorced
from the living group because
the living group, in most cases,
functions solely as a social and
athletic center.
Thus the dilemma for this
generation of students is clear.
A method must be found for
making living groups intellec
tual groups as well, from the
Wilbur House, to the Florence
Moore House, to the fraternity
house.
It seems to me that there are
two main areas in which the
problem may be attacked. First
is that of the grading system.
As long as Stanford maintains
a strict system of grades, class
room learning and intellectual
life will be inseparably linked.
This linkage occurs in the fol
lowing manner. The pressure on
students at the present time for
grade-achievement leading to
graduate school or employment

is intense. Living groups have
relatively little effect on this
achievement because the achieve
ments of learning, i.e. grades,
are found only in the classroom,
and the living group in general
has no direct connection with
learning.
If, however, the University
were to gradually change to a
widespread pass-fail system, as

would seem to be the trend pres
ently, intellectual life in living
groups could be increasingly
fostered. With such a change the
student could concentrate on in
tellectual growth in the living
group free from the pressure of
grade-achievement. From a pure
ly pragmatic standpoint it is
apparent that the living group,
which claims much more of the
student's time than the class
room, would be the most efficient
source of intellectual inter
change.
The Variables
The second area of attack lies
in the actual character of living
groups as to size, selection pro
cedures, composition, location,
etc. It is clear to me that these
variables should be manipulated
to create living groups in which
the maximum wedding of intel
lectual and social life takes place.
The experiment in the Phi Delt
house is an example of this pro
cess in its infancy. Clearly no
one solution will be found as to
size, selection procedure, compo
sition, and location. Rather, a
wide choice of living groups
would be available, all of which
afforded a viable combination of
intellectual and social life, yet
each maintaining its own unique
emphasis or orientation.
Clearly, however, this second
area of attack involves consid
erable re-evaluation by existing
living groups and by interested
students.
The actual effect of the vari
ables mentioned above upon pos
sible intellectual social interac
tion must be determined before

any action can be taken. This
is especially important because
the internal cohesion of any liv
ing group can be dangerously
disrupted through hurried at
tempts at reform. Cohesion is
possible only through the exis
tence of some common interest,
goal or orientation on the part
of a significant percentage of the
group. Without this cohesion

Carl Munclt, a senior history major, is the newly elected presi
dent of Alpha Sigma Phi. In his appraisal of the current system of
rush and fraternity living, he underscores the educational potential
of the living group while citing the "sad tale" of the present rush
procedures. Mundt prepared his article during the Christinas
break after extensive discussion with fraternity leaders, faculty
men, and administrators.

the term "intellectual inter
change" is not applicable for, in
its absence, there is no incentive
or likelihood of worthwhile rela
tionships forming.
Cohesiveness
Nevertheless, cohesion can be
fostered by a great variety of
factors such as: interest in liv
ing at one of the overseas cam
puses, interest in participating in
the Phi Delt experiment or de
sire to be associated with the
social program of a women's
row house. Cohesion, in the final
analysis, is what allows a living
group to function as a group.
No significant amount of re
sponsibility can be delegated
within the group and no abun
dance of beneficial interpersonal
contacts will develop without it.
As a member of a Stanford
fraternity my main interest is
obviously with the effect which
a change in the size, selection
procedures and composition of
the group would have on the
character of the fraternity sys
tem. Fraternities have perhaps
the greatest amount of cohesion
of any type of living group at
Stanford. I would object stren
uously to any attempts at change
which would destroy the cohe
sion in a fraternity house or
any other living arrangement
on the Stanford campus.
Yet it is also very clear to me
that changes are necessary
within the fraternity system. As
presently constituted the system
is generally lacking in intellec
tual and cultural life, and offers
mainly social and athletic exper
iences.

Hqpefully, I have presented a
cleai problem. There exists a
dichotomy at Stanford between
intel '.ectual and social life. A now
grading system is one remedy.
Mor ; germaine to the topic of
this article is the second remedy
—that of manipulating the char
acter of living groups ,and par
ticularly fraternities, in the areas
of size, selection procedures, etc.
The' effect which these changes
havie on the essential quality of
cohesion must also retain an
important role in any investiga
tion.
lln general it is true that
chjj.nges suggested and carried
out from within the fraternity
system have a greater chance
of success and acceptance than
those originating in other
sources. In fact, the greatest
challenge to the fraternity sys
tem is this obligation to its
members to unify intellectual
stimulation and social life from
w Ithin.
In the years ahead Stanford
fraternities will be faced with a
membership crises in two ways:
i: the freshmen become increas
ingly sceptical of the benefits of
fraternity life; and 2) construc
ti on of the new clusters will
fc rce fraternities to expand their
membership to fill the larger
lif/ing plants. Happily, fraterni
ti ?s are in a position to answer
these challenges (as well as the
greater one of lack of intellec
tual atmosphere), because they
inherently process a great de
gree of cohesion and thus the
a pility to channel their energies
toward specific goals.
IThe central question to be
answered is, "What changes
njiust be made to insure the
union of social and intellectual
li fe?"
The main area in which the
character of a fraternity af
fects its intellectual atmosphere
ifc the composition of the group
(who is a member and who is
rot), and indirectly, the method
ii which outsiders join the group
(ithe selection process).
Rush's Sad Tale
Rush, then, is a topic which
: raternities must investigate if
ihey intend to survive as educa
tional institutions. Even a partial
litudy of rush reveals a sad tale
of mediocrity and lack of direc
tion.
To put it bluntly, rush, as it
jjs presently constituted, does not
select for intellectual values. On
the contrary, the intellectual
Capabilities of a rushee are large

ly irrelevant to his success or
failure as a prospective frater
nity brother.
What rush does select for is
social grace and poise. That this
neglect of the intellectual i:
favor of the social is present in
rush can hardly be contested.
Rush week is a series of social
encounters (parties, open houses,
etc.),, during which the socially
comfortable rushee stands out.
The effect which this separation
of intellectual and social has o'i
the living after rush is obvious.
The separation is carried over
as an important characteristic
of the group and the dichotomy
between living group and class
room is strengthened.
The solution is clear. Rush
must either combine intellectual
and social criteria or be replaced
by some substitute which will.
As far as I am concerned, judg
ment by a living group of a
rushee's intellectual ability will
be very difficult to combine with
judgment of his social ability.
This combination is impractical
because of the broad ramifica
tions which the term "intellec
tual ability" includes.
For a living group to attempt
to pass judgment on a rushee's
intellect merely on the basis of
casual encounters during rush
week is simply not feasible.
When one takes into account
the amount of time available
and the number of rushees, the
impossibility of rationally judg
ing each one individually on the
basis of social and intellectual
criteria becomes clear.
Self-Selection
A second solution, and one
which fraternity men have his
torically avoided, is the concept
living group by the rushee. Un
der this system each fraternity
would judge itself as to its
unique orientation and emphasu
in social and intellectual life.
The result of this judgment
would be available to the rushee
through a pamphlet or maga
zine, etc. In turn each rushee
would examine himself and de
termine his own personal intel
lectual and social pattern. I'
would then be a simple matter
for the rushee to choose the liv
ing group which best suited him.
The benefiits of self-judgment
by the living group and rushee
as compared with judgment of
each other are obvious. Fraterni
ties can easily take the lead in
this publication process and
other living groups might fol-
low. The end result would be a
system in which the rushee ra
tionally choose his place of resi
dence on the basis of personal
contact and pamphlets published
by every living group on cam
pus.
Clearly the above proposal
would abolish many facets of
rush as practiced today. With
final choice resting with the
rushee rather than the living
group much of the harmful
psychological pressure on indi
vidual rushees would be avoided.
The social atmosphere and
events of rush week, which
would be maintained, would nec
essarily be more relaxed. Most
important of all, however, is the
union of social and intellectual
criteria into one stream which
might be a major step along the
road to making all living groups

true educational institutions.
Flaw Of Bush
The argument may be raised
that abolishing the right of selec
tion by the fraternity will also
abolish the cohesion and "broth
erhood" which makes fraternity
life unique. While it is true that
cohesion is vital for the function
ing of a group as to social and
intellectual programs, it would
be difficult to show how rush it
self created this cohesion.
Rather, it is common interests
or goals which create cohesion
and these are perhaps more ef
ficiently selected for under the
above proposal, by which a
rushee chooses a living group
whose social and intellectual in
terests are similar to his own.
It would be difficult to con
clude a discussion of the pres
ent selection process at Stan

ford without mentioning the
moral implications involved. For
too long fraternity men have
ignored the psychological harm
of rush or brushed it off with "it
happens every day in the out
side world." The time has come
for the realization that passing
judgment on a person's social
poise after short aquaintance
may be a dangerous relic of the
past. I personally know of far
too many cases in which rushees
were deeply shaken by rejection
during rush. The irony of the
matter is that often the re
jection is made on totally in
valid grounds. The ultimate
q u e s t i on concerns a living
group's right to judge an indi
vidual's social worth under any
circumstances.
Conclusion
Hopefully, the above approach
is not overly dogmatic with re

gard to the role of living groups
at Stanford. I do not claim that
my proposal is the only valid
method of uniting social and in
tellectual life in Stanford fra
ternities and in other living
groups as well. There should he
no one solution but a wide range
of choices open to students— fra
ternities, independent housing,
the Grove experiment, coeduca
tional housing, etc. Each must
solve the problem of separation
of social and intellectual life in
its own unique manner. Fra
ternities are in a position to
take the lead, through internal
changes, in the reform of hous
ing at Stanford. As with any re
form, the solution at Stanford
must begin with awareness of
the problem and then interested
students must devote their tal
ents to finding a workable solu
tion.
It is clear to me, as the 1967
academic year progresses, that
critical discussion and investi
gation must begin dealing with
the role of the various living
groups at Stanford and with
their success or failure as edu
cational institutions.
Increasingly, concern at Stan
ford about these problems is
confined to emotional vendettas
following an attack by fraternity
members upon the student body
president or to sporadic protests
against the isolation of fresh
men in the University commu
nity. Plainly, there is no general
awareness on the part of Stan
ford students of the educational
opportunities which might be
provided by a living group.

The situation may be clarified.
In the mind of the student body
there exists a strict separation
between intellectual life, i.e. the
classroom, and social life, i.e. the
living group. Thus the living
group, be it a house in Stern
Hall, Toyon Hall, a women's resi
dence, or a fraternity house, all
too often becomes a refuge from
the intellectual life of the Quad.
The living group is for social
and athletic life, the classroom
for intellectual life. This dicho
tomy is a very serious develop
ment indeed. In fact, it is a
threat to the educational pro
cess, the benefits of which are
certainly the goal of every sin
cere student.
Possibilities
The problem then becomes one
of arousing student interest for
modifying the role of living
groups and for devoting energy
to the study of living groups
as educational institutions. The
fjossibilities for a living group
n which intellectual life is com
bined with social life are stag
gering.

pared at Amherst College in

I think it must be obvious to
every reader that this same
question might be asked at Stan
ford with regard to any living
group. Few, if any, groups at
Stanford offer such facilities.
To quote further: "Too sel
dom is there a large enough
minority to attempt a dramatic
skit, a musical performance, a
poetry reading, a political action
or debate, a trip to Boston or
New York, a hike across the
Holyoke Range, a publication,
or simply an evening in some
one's room with an invited fac
ulty guest."
Fundamental Problem
Here again the best most liv
ing groups at Stanford can point
to are infrequent efforts along
these lines of intelligent dis
cussions or of cultural enrich
ment.
I am firmly convinced that the
barren living group arrange
ments at Stanford stem from
the fundamental problem—that
of a complete separation of so
cial life from intellectual life.
The result of this separation is
that faculty-student interactions,
cultural programs and intellec
tual involvement are divorced
from the living group because
the living group, in most cases,
functions solely as a social and
athletic center.
Thus the dilemma for this
generation of students is clear.
A method must be found for
making living groups intellec
tual groups as well, from the
Wilbur House, to the Florence
Moore House, to the fraternity
house.
It seems to me that there are
two main areas in which the
problem may be attacked. First
is that of the grading system.
As long as Stanford maintains
a strict system of grades, class
room learning and intellectual
life will be inseparably linked.
This linkage occurs in the fol
lowing manner. The pressure on
students at the present time for
grade-achievement leading to
graduate school or employment

is intense. Living groups have
relatively little effect on this
achievement because the achieve
ments of learning, i.e. grades,
are found only in the classroom,
and the living group in general
has no direct connection with
learning.
If, however, the University
were to gradually change to a
widespread pass-fail system, as

would seem to be the trend pres
ently, intellectual life in living
groups could be increasingly
fostered. With such a change the
student could concentrate on in
tellectual growth in the living
group free from the pressure of
grade-achievement. From a pure
ly pragmatic standpoint it is
apparent that the living group,
which claims much more of the
student's time than the class
room, would be the most efficient
source of intellectual inter
change.
The Variables
The second area of attack lies
in the actual character of living
groups as to size, selection pro
cedures, composition, location,
etc. It is clear to me that these
variables should be manipulated
to create living groups in which
the maximum wedding of intel
lectual and social life takes place.
The experiment in the Phi Delt
house is an example of this pro
cess in its infancy. Clearly no
one solution will be found as to
size, selection procedure, compo
sition, and location. Rather, a
wide choice of living groups
would be available, all of which
afforded a viable combination of
intellectual and social life, yet
each maintaining its own unique
emphasis or orientation.
Clearly, however, this second
area of attack involves consid
erable re-evaluation by existing
living groups and by interested
students.
The actual effect of the vari
ables mentioned above upon pos
sible intellectual social interac
tion must be determined before

any action can be taken. This
is especially important because
the internal cohesion of any liv
ing group can be dangerously
disrupted through hurried at
tempts at reform. Cohesion is
possible only through the exis
tence of some common interest,
goal or orientation on the part
of a significant percentage of the
group. Without this cohesion

Carl Munclt, a senior history major, is the newly elected presi
dent of Alpha Sigma Phi. In his appraisal of the current system of
rush and fraternity living, he underscores the educational potential
of the living group while citing the "sad tale" of the present rush
procedures. Mundt prepared his article during the Christinas
break after extensive discussion with fraternity leaders, faculty
men, and administrators.

the term "intellectual inter
change" is not applicable for, in
its absence, there is no incentive
or likelihood of worthwhile rela
tionships forming.
Cohesiveness
Nevertheless, cohesion can be
fostered by a great variety of
factors such as: interest in liv
ing at one of the overseas cam
puses, interest in participating in
the Phi Delt experiment or de
sire to be associated with the
social program of a women's
row house. Cohesion, in the final
analysis, is what allows a living
group to function as a group.
No significant amount of re
sponsibility can be delegated
within the group and no abun
dance of beneficial interpersonal
contacts will develop without it.
As a member of a Stanford
fraternity my main interest is
obviously with the effect which
a change in the size, selection
procedures and composition of
the group would have on the
character of the fraternity sys
tem. Fraternities have perhaps
the greatest amount of cohesion
of any type of living group at
Stanford. I would object stren
uously to any attempts at change
which would destroy the cohe
sion in a fraternity house or
any other living arrangement
on the Stanford campus.
Yet it is also very clear to me
that changes are necessary
within the fraternity system. As
presently constituted the system
is generally lacking in intellec
tual and cultural life, and offers
mainly social and athletic exper
iences.

Hqpefully, I have presented a
cleai problem. There exists a
dichotomy at Stanford between
intel '.ectual and social life. A now
grading system is one remedy.
Mor ; germaine to the topic of
this article is the second remedy
—that of manipulating the char
acter of living groups ,and par
ticularly fraternities, in the areas
of size, selection procedures, etc.
The' effect which these changes
havie on the essential quality of
cohesion must also retain an
important role in any investiga
tion.
lln general it is true that
chjj.nges suggested and carried
out from within the fraternity
system have a greater chance
of success and acceptance than
those originating in other
sources. In fact, the greatest
challenge to the fraternity sys
tem is this obligation to its
members to unify intellectual
stimulation and social life from
w Ithin.
In the years ahead Stanford
fraternities will be faced with a
membership crises in two ways:
i: the freshmen become increas
ingly sceptical of the benefits of
fraternity life; and 2) construc
ti on of the new clusters will
fc rce fraternities to expand their
membership to fill the larger
lif/ing plants. Happily, fraterni
ti ?s are in a position to answer
these challenges (as well as the
greater one of lack of intellec
tual atmosphere), because they
inherently process a great de
gree of cohesion and thus the
a pility to channel their energies
toward specific goals.
IThe central question to be
answered is, "What changes
njiust be made to insure the
union of social and intellectual
li fe?"
The main area in which the
character of a fraternity af
fects its intellectual atmosphere
ifc the composition of the group
(who is a member and who is
rot), and indirectly, the method
ii which outsiders join the group
(ithe selection process).
Rush's Sad Tale
Rush, then, is a topic which
: raternities must investigate if
ihey intend to survive as educa
tional institutions. Even a partial
litudy of rush reveals a sad tale
of mediocrity and lack of direc
tion.
To put it bluntly, rush, as it
jjs presently constituted, does not
select for intellectual values. On
the contrary, the intellectual
Capabilities of a rushee are large

ly irrelevant to his success or
failure as a prospective frater
nity brother.
What rush does select for is
social grace and poise. That this
neglect of the intellectual i:
favor of the social is present in
rush can hardly be contested.
Rush week is a series of social
encounters (parties, open houses,
etc.),, during which the socially
comfortable rushee stands out.
The effect which this separation
of intellectual and social has o'i
the living after rush is obvious.
The separation is carried over
as an important characteristic
of the group and the dichotomy
between living group and class
room is strengthened.
The solution is clear. Rush
must either combine intellectual
and social criteria or be replaced
by some substitute which will.
As far as I am concerned, judg
ment by a living group of a
rushee's intellectual ability will
be very difficult to combine with
judgment of his social ability.
This combination is impractical
because of the broad ramifica
tions which the term "intellec
tual ability" includes.
For a living group to attempt
to pass judgment on a rushee's
intellect merely on the basis of
casual encounters during rush
week is simply not feasible.
When one takes into account
the amount of time available
and the number of rushees, the
impossibility of rationally judg
ing each one individually on the
basis of social and intellectual
criteria becomes clear.
Self-Selection
A second solution, and one
which fraternity men have his
torically avoided, is the concept
living group by the rushee. Un
der this system each fraternity
would judge itself as to its
unique orientation and emphasu
in social and intellectual life.
The result of this judgment
would be available to the rushee
through a pamphlet or maga
zine, etc. In turn each rushee
would examine himself and de
termine his own personal intel
lectual and social pattern. I'
would then be a simple matter
for the rushee to choose the liv
ing group which best suited him.
The benefiits of self-judgment
by the living group and rushee
as compared with judgment of
each other are obvious. Fraterni
ties can easily take the lead in
this publication process and
other living groups might fol-
low. The end result would be a
system in which the rushee ra
tionally choose his place of resi
dence on the basis of personal
contact and pamphlets published
by every living group on cam
pus.
Clearly the above proposal
would abolish many facets of
rush as practiced today. With
final choice resting with the
rushee rather than the living
group much of the harmful
psychological pressure on indi
vidual rushees would be avoided.
The social atmosphere and
events of rush week, which
would be maintained, would nec
essarily be more relaxed. Most
important of all, however, is the
union of social and intellectual
criteria into one stream which
might be a major step along the
road to making all living groups

true educational institutions.
Flaw Of Bush
The argument may be raised
that abolishing the right of selec
tion by the fraternity will also
abolish the cohesion and "broth
erhood" which makes fraternity
life unique. While it is true that
cohesion is vital for the function
ing of a group as to social and
intellectual programs, it would
be difficult to show how rush it
self created this cohesion.
Rather, it is common interests
or goals which create cohesion
and these are perhaps more ef
ficiently selected for under the
above proposal, by which a
rushee chooses a living group
whose social and intellectual in
terests are similar to his own.
It would be difficult to con
clude a discussion of the pres
ent selection process at Stan

ford without mentioning the
moral implications involved. For
too long fraternity men have
ignored the psychological harm
of rush or brushed it off with "it
happens every day in the out
side world." The time has come
for the realization that passing
judgment on a person's social
poise after short aquaintance
may be a dangerous relic of the
past. I personally know of far
too many cases in which rushees
were deeply shaken by rejection
during rush. The irony of the
matter is that often the re
jection is made on totally in
valid grounds. The ultimate
q u e s t i on concerns a living
group's right to judge an indi
vidual's social worth under any
circumstances.
Conclusion
Hopefully, the above approach
is not overly dogmatic with re

gard to the role of living groups
at Stanford. I do not claim that
my proposal is the only valid
method of uniting social and in
tellectual life in Stanford fra
ternities and in other living
groups as well. There should he
no one solution but a wide range
of choices open to students— fra
ternities, independent housing,
the Grove experiment, coeduca
tional housing, etc. Each must
solve the problem of separation
of social and intellectual life in
its own unique manner. Fra
ternities are in a position to
take the lead, through internal
changes, in the reform of hous
ing at Stanford. As with any re
form, the solution at Stanford
must begin with awareness of
the problem and then interested
students must devote their tal
ents to finding a workable solu
tion.
It is clear to me, as the 1967
academic year progresses, that
critical discussion and investi
gation must begin dealing with
the role of the various living
groups at Stanford and with
their success or failure as edu
cational institutions.
Increasingly, concern at Stan
ford about these problems is
confined to emotional vendettas
following an attack by fraternity
members upon the student body
president or to sporadic protests
against the isolation of fresh
men in the University commu
nity. Plainly, there is no general
awareness on the part of Stan
ford students of the educational
opportunities which might be
provided by a living group.

The situation may be clarified.
In the mind of the student body
there exists a strict separation
between intellectual life, i.e. the
classroom, and social life, i.e. the
living group. Thus the living
group, be it a house in Stern
Hall, Toyon Hall, a women's resi
dence, or a fraternity house, all
too often becomes a refuge from
the intellectual life of the Quad.
The living group is for social
and athletic life, the classroom
for intellectual life. This dicho
tomy is a very serious develop
ment indeed. In fact, it is a
threat to the educational pro
cess, the benefits of which are
certainly the goal of every sin
cere student.
Possibilities
The problem then becomes one
of arousing student interest for
modifying the role of living
groups and for devoting energy
to the study of living groups
as educational institutions. The
fjossibilities for a living group
n which intellectual life is com
bined with social life are stag
gering.
To quote from a report pre
pared at Amherst College in
1964 entitled Report of the Sub
committee to Study Student
Life, "What fraternity house
can now find room to offer an
an exciting collection of records

and the privacy in which to listen
to them, an up-to-date non-aca
demic library and varied periodi
cals, a dark room and develop
ing equipment, a small studio
with materials for painting and
sculpting, a good collection of
old films and a place for showing
them, a wood working shop, a
little theater, or a good game
room, perhaps a suite for visi
tors, or even the facilities for
after-dinner coffee?"
I think it must be obvious to
every reader that this same
question might be asked at Stan
ford with regard to any living
group. Few, if any, groups at
Stanford offer such facilities.

ments at Stanford stem from
the fundamental problem—that
of a complete separation of so
cial life from intellectual life.
The result of this separation is
that faculty-student interactions,
cultural programs and intellec
tual involvement are divorced
from the living group because
the living group, in most cases,
functions solely as a social and
athletic center.
Thus the dilemma for this
generation of students is clear.
A method must be found for
making living groups intellec
tual groups as well, from the
Wilbur House, to the Florence
Moore House, to the fraternity
house.
It seems to me that there are
two main areas in which the
problem may be attacked. First
is that of the grading system.
As long as Stanford maintains
a strict system of grades, class
room learning and intellectual
life will be inseparably linked.
This linkage occurs in the fol
lowing manner. The pressure on
students at the present time for
grade-achievement leading to
graduate school or employment

is intense. Living groups have
relatively little effect on this
achievement because the achieve
ments of learning, i.e. grades,
are found only in the classroom,
and the living group in general
has no direct connection with
learning.
If, however, the University
were to gradually change to a
widespread pass-fail system, as

would seem to be the trend pres
ently, intellectual life in living
groups could be increasingly
fostered. With such a change the
student could concentrate on in
tellectual growth in the living
group free from the pressure of
grade-achievement. From a pure
ly pragmatic standpoint it is
apparent that the living group,
which claims much more of the
student's time than the class
room, would be the most efficient
source of intellectual inter
change.
The Variables
The second area of attack lies
in the actual character of living
groups as to size, selection pro
cedures, composition, location,
etc. It is clear to me that these
variables should be manipulated
to create living groups in which
the maximum wedding of intel
lectual and social life takes place.
The experiment in the Phi Delt
house is an example of this pro
cess in its infancy. Clearly no
one solution will be found as to
size, selection procedure, compo
sition, and location. Rather, a
wide choice of living groups
would be available, all of which
afforded a viable combination of
intellectual and social life, yet
each maintaining its own unique
emphasis or orientation.
Clearly, however, this second
area of attack involves consid
erable re-evaluation by existing
living groups and by interested
students.
The actual effect of the vari
ables mentioned above upon pos
sible intellectual social interac
tion must be determined before

any action can be taken. This
is especially important because
the internal cohesion of any liv
ing group can be dangerously
disrupted through hurried at
tempts at reform. Cohesion is
possible only through the exis
tence of some common interest,
goal or orientation on the part
of a significant percentage of the
group. Without this cohesion

Carl Munclt, a senior history major, is the newly elected presi
dent of Alpha Sigma Phi. In his appraisal of the current system of
rush and fraternity living, he underscores the educational potential
of the living group while citing the "sad tale" of the present rush
procedures. Mundt prepared his article during the Christinas
break after extensive discussion with fraternity leaders, faculty
men, and administrators.

the term "intellectual inter
change" is not applicable for, in
its absence, there is no incentive
or likelihood of worthwhile rela
tionships forming.
Cohesiveness
Nevertheless, cohesion can be
fostered by a great variety of
factors such as: interest in liv
ing at one of the overseas cam
puses, interest in participating in
the Phi Delt experiment or de
sire to be associated with the
social program of a women's
row house. Cohesion, in the final
analysis, is what allows a living
group to function as a group.
No significant amount of re
sponsibility can be delegated
within the group and no abun
dance of beneficial interpersonal
contacts will develop without it.
As a member of a Stanford
fraternity my main interest is
obviously with the effect which
a change in the size, selection
procedures and composition of
the group would have on the
character of the fraternity sys
tem. Fraternities have perhaps
the greatest amount of cohesion
of any type of living group at
Stanford. I would object stren
uously to any attempts at change
which would destroy the cohe
sion in a fraternity house or
any other living arrangement
on the Stanford campus.
Yet it is also very clear to me
that changes are necessary
within the fraternity system. As
presently constituted the system
is generally lacking in intellec
tual and cultural life, and offers
mainly social and athletic exper
iences.

Hqpefully, I have presented a
cleai problem. There exists a
dichotomy at Stanford between
intel '.ectual and social life. A now
grading system is one remedy.
Mor ; germaine to the topic of
this article is the second remedy
—that of manipulating the char
acter of living groups ,and par
ticularly fraternities, in the areas
of size, selection procedures, etc.
The' effect which these changes
havie on the essential quality of
cohesion must also retain an
important role in any investiga
tion.
lln general it is true that
chjj.nges suggested and carried
out from within the fraternity
system have a greater chance
of success and acceptance than
those originating in other
sources. In fact, the greatest
challenge to the fraternity sys
tem is this obligation to its
members to unify intellectual
stimulation and social life from
w Ithin.
In the years ahead Stanford
fraternities will be faced with a
membership crises in two ways:
i: the freshmen become increas
ingly sceptical of the benefits of
fraternity life; and 2) construc
ti on of the new clusters will
fc rce fraternities to expand their
membership to fill the larger
lif/ing plants. Happily, fraterni
ti ?s are in a position to answer
these challenges (as well as the
greater one of lack of intellec
tual atmosphere), because they
inherently process a great de
gree of cohesion and thus the
a pility to channel their energies
toward specific goals.
IThe central question to be
answered is, "What changes
njiust be made to insure the
union of social and intellectual
li fe?"
The main area in which the
character of a fraternity af
fects its intellectual atmosphere
ifc the composition of the group
(who is a member and who is
rot), and indirectly, the method
ii which outsiders join the group
(ithe selection process).
Rush's Sad Tale
Rush, then, is a topic which
: raternities must investigate if
ihey intend to survive as educa
tional institutions. Even a partial
litudy of rush reveals a sad tale
of mediocrity and lack of direc
tion.
To put it bluntly, rush, as it
jjs presently constituted, does not
select for intellectual values. On
the contrary, the intellectual
Capabilities of a rushee are large

ly irrelevant to his success or
failure as a prospective frater
nity brother.
What rush does select for is
social grace and poise. That this
neglect of the intellectual i:
favor of the social is present in
rush can hardly be contested.
Rush week is a series of social
encounters (parties, open houses,
etc.),, during which the socially
comfortable rushee stands out.
The effect which this separation
of intellectual and social has o'i
the living after rush is obvious.
The separation is carried over
as an important characteristic
of the group and the dichotomy
between living group and class
room is strengthened.
The solution is clear. Rush
must either combine intellectual
and social criteria or be replaced
by some substitute which will.
As far as I am concerned, judg
ment by a living group of a
rushee's intellectual ability will
be very difficult to combine with
judgment of his social ability.
This combination is impractical
because of the broad ramifica
tions which the term "intellec
tual ability" includes.
For a living group to attempt
to pass judgment on a rushee's
intellect merely on the basis of
casual encounters during rush
week is simply not feasible.
When one takes into account
the amount of time available
and the number of rushees, the
impossibility of rationally judg
ing each one individually on the
basis of social and intellectual
criteria becomes clear.
Self-Selection
A second solution, and one
which fraternity men have his
torically avoided, is the concept
living group by the rushee. Un
der this system each fraternity
would judge itself as to its
unique orientation and emphasu
in social and intellectual life.
The result of this judgment
would be available to the rushee
through a pamphlet or maga
zine, etc. In turn each rushee
would examine himself and de
termine his own personal intel
lectual and social pattern. I'
would then be a simple matter
for the rushee to choose the liv
ing group which best suited him.
The benefiits of self-judgment
by the living group and rushee
as compared with judgment of
each other are obvious. Fraterni
ties can easily take the lead in
this publication process and
other living groups might fol-
low. The end result would be a
system in which the rushee ra
tionally choose his place of resi
dence on the basis of personal
contact and pamphlets published
by every living group on cam
pus.
Clearly the above proposal
would abolish many facets of
rush as practiced today. With
final choice resting with the
rushee rather than the living
group much of the harmful
psychological pressure on indi
vidual rushees would be avoided.
The social atmosphere and
events of rush week, which
would be maintained, would nec
essarily be more relaxed. Most
important of all, however, is the
union of social and intellectual
criteria into one stream which
might be a major step along the
road to making all living groups

true educational institutions.
Flaw Of Bush
The argument may be raised
that abolishing the right of selec
tion by the fraternity will also
abolish the cohesion and "broth
erhood" which makes fraternity
life unique. While it is true that
cohesion is vital for the function
ing of a group as to social and
intellectual programs, it would
be difficult to show how rush it
self created this cohesion.
Rather, it is common interests
or goals which create cohesion
and these are perhaps more ef
ficiently selected for under the
above proposal, by which a
rushee chooses a living group
whose social and intellectual in
terests are similar to his own.
It would be difficult to con
clude a discussion of the pres
ent selection process at Stan

ford without mentioning the
moral implications involved. For
too long fraternity men have
ignored the psychological harm
of rush or brushed it off with "it
happens every day in the out
side world." The time has come
for the realization that passing
judgment on a person's social
poise after short aquaintance
may be a dangerous relic of the
past. I personally know of far
too many cases in which rushees
were deeply shaken by rejection
during rush. The irony of the
matter is that often the re
jection is made on totally in
valid grounds. The ultimate
q u e s t i on concerns a living
group's right to judge an indi
vidual's social worth under any
circumstances.
Conclusion
Hopefully, the above approach
is not overly dogmatic with re

gard to the role of living groups
at Stanford. I do not claim that
my proposal is the only valid
method of uniting social and in
tellectual life in Stanford fra
ternities and in other living
groups as well. There should he
no one solution but a wide range
of choices open to students— fra
ternities, independent housing,
the Grove experiment, coeduca
tional housing, etc. Each must
solve the problem of separation
of social and intellectual life in
its own unique manner. Fra
ternities are in a position to
take the lead, through internal
changes, in the reform of hous
ing at Stanford. As with any re
form, the solution at Stanford
must begin with awareness of
the problem and then interested
students must devote their tal
ents to finding a workable solu
tion.
It is clear to me, as the 1967
academic year progresses, that
critical discussion and investi
gation must begin dealing with
the role of the various living
groups at Stanford and with
their success or failure as edu
cational institutions.
Increasingly, concern at Stan
ford about these problems is
confined to emotional vendettas
following an attack by fraternity
members upon the student body
president or to sporadic protests
against the isolation of fresh
men in the University commu
nity. Plainly, there is no general
awareness on the part of Stan
ford students of the educational
opportunities which might be
provided by a living group.

The situation may be clarified.
In the mind of the student body
there exists a strict separation
between intellectual life, i.e. the
classroom, and social life, i.e. the
living group. Thus the living
group, be it a house in Stern
Hall, Toyon Hall, a women's resi
dence, or a fraternity house, all
too often becomes a refuge from
the intellectual life of the Quad.
The living group is for social
and athletic life, the classroom
for intellectual life. This dicho
tomy is a very serious develop
ment indeed. In fact, it is a
threat to the educational pro
cess, the benefits of which are
certainly the goal of every sin
cere student.
Possibilities
The problem then becomes one
of arousing student interest for
modifying the role of living
groups and for devoting energy
to the study of living groups
as educational institutions. The
fjossibilities for a living group
n which intellectual life is com
bined with social life are stag
gering.
To quote from a report pre
pared at Amherst College in
1964 entitled Report of the Sub
committee to Study Student
Life, "What fraternity house
can now find room to offer an
an exciting collection of records

and the privacy in which to listen
to them, an up-to-date non-aca
demic library and varied periodi
cals, a dark room and develop
ing equipment, a small studio
with materials for painting and
sculpting, a good collection of
old films and a place for showing
them, a wood working shop, a
little theater, or a good game
room, perhaps a suite for visi
tors, or even the facilities for
after-dinner coffee?"
I think it must be obvious to
every reader that this same
question might be asked at Stan
ford with regard to any living
group. Few, if any, groups at
Stanford offer such facilities.
To quote further: "Too sel
dom is there a large enough
minority to attempt a dramatic
skit, a musical performance, a
poetry reading, a political action
or debate, a trip to Boston or
New York, a hike across the
Holyoke Range, a publication,
or simply an evening in some
one's room with an invited fac
ulty guest."
Fundamental Problem
Here again the best most liv
ing groups at Stanford can point
to are infrequent efforts along
these lines of intelligent dis
cussions or of cultural enrich
ment.
I am firmly convinced that the
barren living group arrange
ments at Stanford stem from
the fundamental problem—that
of a complete separation of so

social program of a women's
row house. Cohesion, in the final
analysis, is what allows a living
group to function as a group.
No significant amount of re
sponsibility can be delegated
within the group and no abun
dance of beneficial interpersonal
contacts will develop without it.
As a member of a Stanford
fraternity my main interest is
obviously with the effect which
a change in the size, selection
procedures and composition of
the group would have on the
character of the fraternity sys
tem. Fraternities have perhaps
the greatest amount of cohesion
of any type of living group at
Stanford. I would object stren
uously to any attempts at change
which would destroy the cohe
sion in a fraternity house or
any other living arrangement
on the Stanford campus.
Yet it is also very clear to me
that changes are necessary
within the fraternity system. As
presently constituted the system
is generally lacking in intellec
tual and cultural life, and offers
mainly social and athletic exper
iences.

Hqpefully, I have presented a
cleai problem. There exists a
dichotomy at Stanford between
intel '.ectual and social life. A now
grading system is one remedy.
Mor ; germaine to the topic of
this article is the second remedy
—that of manipulating the char
acter of living groups ,and par
ticularly fraternities, in the areas
of size, selection procedures, etc.
The' effect which these changes
havie on the essential quality of
cohesion must also retain an
important role in any investiga
tion.
lln general it is true that
chjj.nges suggested and carried
out from within the fraternity
system have a greater chance
of success and acceptance than
those originating in other
sources. In fact, the greatest
challenge to the fraternity sys
tem is this obligation to its
members to unify intellectual
stimulation and social life from
w Ithin.
In the years ahead Stanford
fraternities will be faced with a
membership crises in two ways:
i: the freshmen become increas
ingly sceptical of the benefits of
fraternity life; and 2) construc
ti on of the new clusters will
fc rce fraternities to expand their
membership to fill the larger
lif/ing plants. Happily, fraterni
ti ?s are in a position to answer
these challenges (as well as the
greater one of lack of intellec
tual atmosphere), because they
inherently process a great de
gree of cohesion and thus the
a pility to channel their energies
toward specific goals.
IThe central question to be
answered is, "What changes
njiust be made to insure the
union of social and intellectual
li fe?"
The main area in which the
character of a fraternity af
fects its intellectual atmosphere
ifc the composition of the group
(who is a member and who is
rot), and indirectly, the method
ii which outsiders join the group
(ithe selection process).
Rush's Sad Tale
Rush, then, is a topic which
: raternities must investigate if
ihey intend to survive as educa
tional institutions. Even a partial
litudy of rush reveals a sad tale
of mediocrity and lack of direc
tion.
To put it bluntly, rush, as it
jjs presently constituted, does not
select for intellectual values. On
the contrary, the intellectual
Capabilities of a rushee are large

ly irrelevant to his success or
failure as a prospective frater
nity brother.
What rush does select for is
social grace and poise. That this
neglect of the intellectual i:
favor of the social is present in
rush can hardly be contested.
Rush week is a series of social
encounters (parties, open houses,
etc.),, during which the socially
comfortable rushee stands out.
The effect which this separation
of intellectual and social has o'i
the living after rush is obvious.
The separation is carried over
as an important characteristic
of the group and the dichotomy
between living group and class
room is strengthened.
The solution is clear. Rush
must either combine intellectual
and social criteria or be replaced
by some substitute which will.
As far as I am concerned, judg
ment by a living group of a
rushee's intellectual ability will
be very difficult to combine with
judgment of his social ability.
This combination is impractical
because of the broad ramifica
tions which the term "intellec
tual ability" includes.
For a living group to attempt
to pass judgment on a rushee's
intellect merely on the basis of
casual encounters during rush
week is simply not feasible.
When one takes into account
the amount of time available
and the number of rushees, the
impossibility of rationally judg
ing each one individually on the
basis of social and intellectual
criteria becomes clear.
Self-Selection
A second solution, and one
which fraternity men have his
torically avoided, is the concept
living group by the rushee. Un
der this system each fraternity
would judge itself as to its
unique orientation and emphasu
in social and intellectual life.
The result of this judgment
would be available to the rushee
through a pamphlet or maga
zine, etc. In turn each rushee
would examine himself and de
termine his own personal intel
lectual and social pattern. I'
would then be a simple matter
for the rushee to choose the liv
ing group which best suited him.
The benefiits of self-judgment
by the living group and rushee
as compared with judgment of
each other are obvious. Fraterni
ties can easily take the lead in
this publication process and
other living groups might fol-
low. The end result would be a
system in which the rushee ra
tionally choose his place of resi
dence on the basis of personal
contact and pamphlets published
by every living group on cam
pus.
Clearly the above proposal
would abolish many facets of
rush as practiced today. With
final choice resting with the
rushee rather than the living
group much of the harmful
psychological pressure on indi
vidual rushees would be avoided.
The social atmosphere and
events of rush week, which
would be maintained, would nec
essarily be more relaxed. Most
important of all, however, is the
union of social and intellectual
criteria into one stream which
might be a major step along the
road to making all living groups

true educational institutions.
Flaw Of Bush
The argument may be raised
that abolishing the right of selec
tion by the fraternity will also
abolish the cohesion and "broth
erhood" which makes fraternity
life unique. While it is true that
cohesion is vital for the function
ing of a group as to social and
intellectual programs, it would
be difficult to show how rush it
self created this cohesion.
Rather, it is common interests
or goals which create cohesion
and these are perhaps more ef
ficiently selected for under the
above proposal, by which a
rushee chooses a living group
whose social and intellectual in
terests are similar to his own.
It would be difficult to con
clude a discussion of the pres
ent selection process at Stan

ford without mentioning the
moral implications involved. For
too long fraternity men have
ignored the psychological harm
of rush or brushed it off with "it
happens every day in the out
side world." The time has come
for the realization that passing
judgment on a person's social
poise after short aquaintance
may be a dangerous relic of the
past. I personally know of far
too many cases in which rushees
were deeply shaken by rejection
during rush. The irony of the
matter is that often the re
jection is made on totally in
valid grounds. The ultimate
q u e s t i on concerns a living
group's right to judge an indi
vidual's social worth under any
circumstances.
Conclusion
Hopefully, the above approach
is not overly dogmatic with re

gard to the role of living groups
at Stanford. I do not claim that
my proposal is the only valid
method of uniting social and in
tellectual life in Stanford fra
ternities and in other living
groups as well. There should he

of choices open to students— fra
ternities, independent housing,

ternities are in a position to
take the lead, through internal
changes, in the reform of hous

must begin with awareness of
the problem and then interested
students must devote their tal
ents to finding a workable solu
tion.
It is clear to me, as the 1967
academic year progresses, that
critical discussion and investi
gation must begin dealing with
the role of the various living
groups at Stanford and with
their success or failure as edu
cational institutions.
Increasingly, concern at Stan
ford about these problems is
confined to emotional vendettas
following an attack by fraternity
members upon the student body
president or to sporadic protests
against the isolation of fresh
men in the University commu
nity. Plainly, there is no general
awareness on the part of Stan
ford students of the educational
opportunities which might be
provided by a living group.

The situation may be clarified.
In the mind of the student body
there exists a strict separation
between intellectual life, i.e. the
classroom, and social life, i.e. the
living group. Thus the living
group, be it a house in Stern
Hall, Toyon Hall, a women's resi
dence, or a fraternity house, all
too often becomes a refuge from
the intellectual life of the Quad.
The living group is for social
and athletic life, the classroom
for intellectual life. This dicho
tomy is a very serious develop
ment indeed. In fact, it is a
threat to the educational pro
cess, the benefits of which are
certainly the goal of every sin
cere student.
Possibilities
The problem then becomes one
of arousing student interest for
modifying the role of living
groups and for devoting energy
to the study of living groups
as educational institutions. The
fjossibilities for a living group
n which intellectual life is com
bined with social life are stag
gering.
To quote from a report pre
pared at Amherst College in
1964 entitled Report of the Sub
committee to Study Student
Life, "What fraternity house
can now find room to offer an
an exciting collection of records

and the privacy in which to listen
to them, an up-to-date non-aca
demic library and varied periodi
cals, a dark room and develop
ing equipment, a small studio
with materials for painting and
sculpting, a good collection of
old films and a place for showing
them, a wood working shop, a
little theater, or a good game
room, perhaps a suite for visi
tors, or even the facilities for
after-dinner coffee?"
I think it must be obvious to
every reader that this same
question might be asked at Stan
ford with regard to any living
group. Few, if any, groups at
Stanford offer such facilities.
To quote further: "Too sel
dom is there a large enough
minority to attempt a dramatic
skit, a musical performance, a
poetry reading, a political action
or debate, a trip to Boston or
New York, a hike across the
Holyoke Range, a publication,
or simply an evening in some
one's room with an invited fac
ulty guest."
Fundamental Problem
Here again the best most liv
ing groups at Stanford can point
to are infrequent efforts along
these lines of intelligent dis
cussions or of cultural enrich
ment.
I am firmly convinced that the
barren living group arrange
ments at Stanford stem from
the fundamental problem—that
of a complete separation of so
cial life from intellectual life.
The result of this separation is
that faculty-student interactions,
cultural programs and intellec
tual involvement are divorced
from the living group because
the living group, in most cases,
functions solely as a social and
athletic center.
Thus the dilemma for this
generation of students is clear.
A method must be found for
making living groups intellec
tual groups as well, from the
Wilbur House, to the Florence
Moore House, to the fraternity
house.
It seems to me that there are
two main areas in which the
problem may be attacked. First
is that of the grading system.
As long as Stanford maintains
a strict system of grades, class
room learning and intellectual
life will be inseparably linked.
This linkage occurs in the fol
lowing manner. The pressure on
students at the present time for
grade-achievement leading to
graduate school or employment

is intense. Living groups have
relatively little effect on this
achievement because the achieve
ments of learning, i.e. grades,
are found only in the classroom,
and the living group in general
has no direct connection with
learning.
If, however, the University
were to gradually change to a
widespread pass-fail system, as

would seem to be the trend pres
ently, intellectual life in living
groups could be increasingly
fostered. With such a change the
student could concentrate on in
tellectual growth in the living
group free from the pressure of
grade-achievement. From a pure
ly pragmatic standpoint it is
apparent that the living group,
which claims much more of the
student's time than the class
room, would be the most efficient
source of intellectual inter
change.
The Variables
The second area of attack lies
in the actual character of living
groups as to size, selection pro
cedures, composition, location,
etc. It is clear to me that these
variables should be manipulated
to create living groups in which
the maximum wedding of intel
lectual and social life takes place.
The experiment in the Phi Delt
house is an example of this pro
cess in its infancy. Clearly no
one solution will be found as to
size, selection procedure, compo
sition, and location. Rather, a
wide choice of living groups
would be available, all of which
afforded a viable combination of
intellectual and social life, yet
each maintaining its own unique
emphasis or orientation.
Clearly, however, this second
area of attack involves consid
erable re-evaluation by existing
living groups and by interested
students.
The actual effect of the vari
ables mentioned above upon pos
sible intellectual social interac
tion must be determined before

any action can be taken. This
is especially important because
the internal cohesion of any liv
ing group can be dangerously
disrupted through hurried at
tempts at reform. Cohesion is
possible only through the exis
tence of some common interest,
goal or orientation on the part
of a significant percentage of the
group. Without this cohesion

Carl Munclt, a senior history major, is the newly elected presi
dent of Alpha Sigma Phi. In his appraisal of the current system of
rush and fraternity living, he underscores the educational potential
of the living group while citing the "sad tale" of the present rush
procedures. Mundt prepared his article during the Christinas
break after extensive discussion with fraternity leaders, faculty
men, and administrators.

the term "intellectual inter
change" is not applicable for, in
its absence, there is no incentive
or likelihood of worthwhile rela
tionships forming.
Cohesiveness
Nevertheless, cohesion can be
fostered by a great variety of
factors such as: interest in liv
ing at one of the overseas cam
puses, interest in participating in
the Phi Delt experiment or de
sire to be associated with the
social program of a women's
row house. Cohesion, in the final
analysis, is what allows a living
group to function as a group.
No significant amount of re
sponsibility can be delegated
within the group and no abun
dance of beneficial interpersonal
contacts will develop without it.
As a member of a Stanford
fraternity my main interest is
obviously with the effect which
a change in the size, selection
procedures and composition of
the group would have on the
character of the fraternity sys
tem. Fraternities have perhaps
the greatest amount of cohesion
of any type of living group at
Stanford. I would object stren
uously to any attempts at change
which would destroy the cohe
sion in a fraternity house or
any other living arrangement
on the Stanford campus.
Yet it is also very clear to me
that changes are necessary
within the fraternity system. As
presently constituted the system
is generally lacking in intellec
tual and cultural life, and offers
mainly social and athletic exper
iences.

Rush, then, is a topic which

Rush week is a series of social

grade-achievement. From a pure
ly pragmatic standpoint it is
apparent that the living group,
which claims much more of the
student's time than the class
room, would be the most efficient
source of intellectual inter
change.
The Variables
The second area of attack lies
in the actual character of living
groups as to size, selection pro
cedures, composition, location,
etc. It is clear to me that these
variables should be manipulated
to create living groups in which
the maximum wedding of intel
lectual and social life takes place.
The experiment in the Phi Delt
house is an example of this pro
cess in its infancy. Clearly no
one solution will be found as to
size, selection procedure, compo
sition, and location. Rather, a
wide choice of living groups
would be available, all of which
afforded a viable combination of
intellectual and social life, yet
each maintaining its own unique
emphasis or orientation.
Clearly, however, this second
area of attack involves consid
erable re-evaluation by existing
living groups and by interested
students.
The actual effect of the vari
ables mentioned above upon pos
sible intellectual social interac
tion must be determined before

any action can be taken. This
is especially important because
the internal cohesion of any liv
ing group can be dangerously
disrupted through hurried at
tempts at reform. Cohesion is
possible only through the exis
tence of some common interest,
goal or orientation on the part
of a significant percentage of the
group. Without this cohesion

Carl Munclt, a senior history major, is the newly elected presi
dent of Alpha Sigma Phi. In his appraisal of the current system of
rush and fraternity living, he underscores the educational potential
of the living group while citing the "sad tale" of the present rush
procedures. Mundt prepared his article during the Christinas
break after extensive discussion with fraternity leaders, faculty
men, and administrators.

the term "intellectual inter
change" is not applicable for, in
its absence, there is no incentive
or likelihood of worthwhile rela
tionships forming.
Cohesiveness
Nevertheless, cohesion can be
fostered by a great variety of
factors such as: interest in liv
ing at one of the overseas cam
puses, interest in participating in
the Phi Delt experiment or de
sire to be associated with the
social program of a women's
row house. Cohesion, in the final
analysis, is what allows a living
group to function as a group.
No significant amount of re
sponsibility can be delegated
within the group and no abun
dance of beneficial interpersonal
contacts will develop without it.
As a member of a Stanford
fraternity my main interest is
obviously with the effect which
a change in the size, selection
procedures and composition of
the group would have on the
character of the fraternity sys
tem. Fraternities have perhaps
the greatest amount of cohesion
of any type of living group at
Stanford. I would object stren
uously to any attempts at change
which would destroy the cohe
sion in a fraternity house or
any other living arrangement
on the Stanford campus.
Yet it is also very clear to me
that changes are necessary
within the fraternity system. As
presently constituted the system
is generally lacking in intellec
tual and cultural life, and offers
mainly social and athletic exper
iences.

Hqpefully, I have presented a
cleai problem. There exists a
dichotomy at Stanford between
intel '.ectual and social life. A now
grading system is one remedy.
Mor ; germaine to the topic of
this article is the second remedy
—that of manipulating the char
acter of living groups ,and par
ticularly fraternities, in the areas
of size, selection procedures, etc.
The' effect which these changes
havie on the essential quality of
cohesion must also retain an
important role in any investiga
tion.
lln general it is true that
chjj.nges suggested and carried
out from within the fraternity
system have a greater chance
of success and acceptance than
those originating in other
sources. In fact, the greatest
challenge to the fraternity sys
tem is this obligation to its
members to unify intellectual
stimulation and social life from
w Ithin.
In the years ahead Stanford
fraternities will be faced with a
membership crises in two ways:
i: the freshmen become increas
ingly sceptical of the benefits of
fraternity life; and 2) construc
ti on of the new clusters will
fc rce fraternities to expand their
membership to fill the larger
lif/ing plants. Happily, fraterni
ti ?s are in a position to answer
these challenges (as well as the
greater one of lack of intellec
tual atmosphere), because they
inherently process a great de
gree of cohesion and thus the
a pility to channel their energies
toward specific goals.
IThe central question to be
answered is, "What changes
njiust be made to insure the
union of social and intellectual
li fe?"
The main area in which the
character of a fraternity af
fects its intellectual atmosphere
ifc the composition of the group
(who is a member and who is
rot), and indirectly, the method
ii which outsiders join the group
(ithe selection process).
Rush's Sad Tale
Rush, then, is a topic which
: raternities must investigate if
ihey intend to survive as educa
tional institutions. Even a partial
litudy of rush reveals a sad tale
of mediocrity and lack of direc
tion.
To put it bluntly, rush, as it
jjs presently constituted, does not
select for intellectual values. On
the contrary, the intellectual
Capabilities of a rushee are large

ly irrelevant to his success or
failure as a prospective frater
nity brother.
What rush does select for is
social grace and poise. That this
neglect of the intellectual i:
favor of the social is present in
rush can hardly be contested.
Rush week is a series of social
encounters (parties, open houses,
etc.),, during which the socially
comfortable rushee stands out.
The effect which this separation
of intellectual and social has o'i
the living after rush is obvious.
The separation is carried over
as an important characteristic
of the group and the dichotomy
between living group and class
room is strengthened.
The solution is clear. Rush
must either combine intellectual
and social criteria or be replaced
by some substitute which will.
As far as I am concerned, judg
ment by a living group of a
rushee's intellectual ability will
be very difficult to combine with
judgment of his social ability.
This combination is impractical
because of the broad ramifica
tions which the term "intellec
tual ability" includes.
For a living group to attempt
to pass judgment on a rushee's
intellect merely on the basis of
casual encounters during rush
week is simply not feasible.
When one takes into account
the amount of time available
and the number of rushees, the
impossibility of rationally judg
ing each one individually on the
basis of social and intellectual
criteria becomes clear.
Self-Selection
A second solution, and one
which fraternity men have his
torically avoided, is the concept
living group by the rushee. Un
der this system each fraternity
would judge itself as to its
unique orientation and emphasu
in social and intellectual life.
The result of this judgment
would be available to the rushee
through a pamphlet or maga
zine, etc. In turn each rushee
would examine himself and de
termine his own personal intel
lectual and social pattern. I'
would then be a simple matter
for the rushee to choose the liv
ing group which best suited him.
The benefiits of self-judgment
by the living group and rushee
as compared with judgment of
each other are obvious. Fraterni
ties can easily take the lead in
this publication process and
other living groups might fol-
low. The end result would be a
system in which the rushee ra
tionally choose his place of resi
dence on the basis of personal
contact and pamphlets published
by every living group on cam
pus.
Clearly the above proposal
would abolish many facets of
rush as practiced today. With
final choice resting with the
rushee rather than the living
group much of the harmful
psychological pressure on indi
vidual rushees would be avoided.
The social atmosphere and
events of rush week, which
would be maintained, would nec
essarily be more relaxed. Most
important of all, however, is the
union of social and intellectual
criteria into one stream which
might be a major step along the
road to making all living groups

true educational institutions.
Flaw Of Bush
The argument may be raised
that abolishing the right of selec
tion by the fraternity will also
abolish the cohesion and "broth
erhood" which makes fraternity
life unique. While it is true that
cohesion is vital for the function
ing of a group as to social and
intellectual programs, it would
be difficult to show how rush it
self created this cohesion.
Rather, it is common interests
or goals which create cohesion
and these are perhaps more ef
ficiently selected for under the
above proposal, by which a
rushee chooses a living group
whose social and intellectual in
terests are similar to his own.
It would be difficult to con
clude a discussion of the pres
ent selection process at Stan

ford without mentioning the
moral implications involved. For
too long fraternity men have
ignored the psychological harm
of rush or brushed it off with "it
happens every day in the out
side world." The time has come
for the realization that passing
judgment on a person's social
poise after short aquaintance
may be a dangerous relic of the
past. I personally know of far
too many cases in which rushees
were deeply shaken by rejection
during rush. The irony of the
matter is that often the re
jection is made on totally in
valid grounds. The ultimate
q u e s t i on concerns a living
group's right to judge an indi
vidual's social worth under any
circumstances.
Conclusion
Hopefully, the above approach
is not overly dogmatic with re

gard to the role of living groups
at Stanford. I do not claim that
my proposal is the only valid
method of uniting social and in
tellectual life in Stanford fra
ternities and in other living
groups as well. There should he
no one solution but a wide range
of choices open to students— fra
ternities, independent housing,
the Grove experiment, coeduca
tional housing, etc. Each must
solve the problem of separation
of social and intellectual life in
its own unique manner. Fra
ternities are in a position to
take the lead, through internal
changes, in the reform of hous
ing at Stanford. As with any re
form, the solution at Stanford
must begin with awareness of
the problem and then interested
students must devote their tal
ents to finding a workable solu
tion.
It is clear to me, as the 1967
academic year progresses, that
critical discussion and investi
gation must begin dealing with
the role of the various living
groups at Stanford and with
their success or failure as edu
cational institutions.
Increasingly, concern at Stan
ford about these problems is
confined to emotional vendettas
following an attack by fraternity
members upon the student body
president or to sporadic protests
against the isolation of fresh
men in the University commu
nity. Plainly, there is no general
awareness on the part of Stan
ford students of the educational
opportunities which might be
provided by a living group.

The situation may be clarified.
In the mind of the student body
there exists a strict separation
between intellectual life, i.e. the
classroom, and social life, i.e. the
living group. Thus the living
group, be it a house in Stern
Hall, Toyon Hall, a women's resi
dence, or a fraternity house, all
too often becomes a refuge from
the intellectual life of the Quad.
The living group is for social
and athletic life, the classroom
for intellectual life. This dicho
tomy is a very serious develop
ment indeed. In fact, it is a
threat to the educational pro
cess, the benefits of which are
certainly the goal of every sin
cere student.
Possibilities
The problem then becomes one
of arousing student interest for
modifying the role of living
groups and for devoting energy
to the study of living groups
as educational institutions. The
fjossibilities for a living group
n which intellectual life is com
bined with social life are stag
gering.
To quote from a report pre
pared at Amherst College in
1964 entitled Report of the Sub
committee to Study Student
Life, "What fraternity house
can now find room to offer an
an exciting collection of records

and the privacy in which to listen
to them, an up-to-date non-aca
demic library and varied periodi
cals, a dark room and develop
ing equipment, a small studio
with materials for painting and
sculpting, a good collection of
old films and a place for showing
them, a wood working shop, a
little theater, or a good game
room, perhaps a suite for visi
tors, or even the facilities for
after-dinner coffee?"
I think it must be obvious to
every reader that this same
question might be asked at Stan
ford with regard to any living
group. Few, if any, groups at
Stanford offer such facilities.
To quote further: "Too sel
dom is there a large enough
minority to attempt a dramatic
skit, a musical performance, a
poetry reading, a political action
or debate, a trip to Boston or
New York, a hike across the
Holyoke Range, a publication,
or simply an evening in some
one's room with an invited fac
ulty guest."
Fundamental Problem
Here again the best most liv
ing groups at Stanford can point
to are infrequent efforts along
these lines of intelligent dis
cussions or of cultural enrich
ment.
I am firmly convinced that the
barren living group arrange
ments at Stanford stem from
the fundamental problem—that
of a complete separation of so
cial life from intellectual life.
The result of this separation is
that faculty-student interactions,
cultural programs and intellec
tual involvement are divorced
from the living group because
the living group, in most cases,
functions solely as a social and
athletic center.
Thus the dilemma for this
generation of students is clear.
A method must be found for
making living groups intellec
tual groups as well, from the
Wilbur House, to the Florence
Moore House, to the fraternity
house.
It seems to me that there are
two main areas in which the
problem may be attacked. First
is that of the grading system.
As long as Stanford maintains
a strict system of grades, class
room learning and intellectual
life will be inseparably linked.
This linkage occurs in the fol
lowing manner. The pressure on
students at the present time for
grade-achievement leading to
graduate school or employment

is intense. Living groups have
relatively little effect on this
achievement because the achieve
ments of learning, i.e. grades,
are found only in the classroom,
and the living group in general
has no direct connection with
learning.
If, however, the University
were to gradually change to a
widespread pass-fail system, as

would seem to be the trend pres
ently, intellectual life in living
groups could be increasingly
fostered. With such a change the
student could concentrate on in
tellectual growth in the living
group free from the pressure of
grade-achievement. From a pure
ly pragmatic standpoint it is
apparent that the living group,
which claims much more of the
student's time than the class
room, would be the most efficient
source of intellectual inter
change.
The Variables
The second area of attack lies
in the actual character of living
groups as to size, selection pro
cedures, composition, location,
etc. It is clear to me that these
variables should be manipulated
to create living groups in which
the maximum wedding of intel
lectual and social life takes place.
The experiment in the Phi Delt
house is an example of this pro
cess in its infancy. Clearly no
one solution will be found as to
size, selection procedure, compo
sition, and location. Rather, a
wide choice of living groups
would be available, all of which

would be available, all of which
afforded a viable combination of
intellectual and social life, yet
each maintaining its own unique
emphasis or orientation.
Clearly, however, this second
area of attack involves consid
erable re-evaluation by existing
living groups and by interested
students.
The actual effect of the vari
ables mentioned above upon pos
sible intellectual social interac
tion must be determined before

any action can be taken. This
is especially important because
the internal cohesion of any liv
ing group can be dangerously
disrupted through hurried at
tempts at reform. Cohesion is
possible only through the exis
tence of some common interest,
goal or orientation on the part
of a significant percentage of the
group. Without this cohesion

Carl Munclt, a senior history major, is the newly elected presi
dent of Alpha Sigma Phi. In his appraisal of the current system of
rush and fraternity living, he underscores the educational potential
of the living group while citing the "sad tale" of the present rush
procedures. Mundt prepared his article during the Christinas
break after extensive discussion with fraternity leaders, faculty
men, and administrators.

the term "intellectual inter
change" is not applicable for, in
its absence, there is no incentive
or likelihood of worthwhile rela
tionships forming.
Cohesiveness
Nevertheless, cohesion can be
fostered by a great variety of
factors such as: interest in liv
ing at one of the overseas cam
puses, interest in participating in
the Phi Delt experiment or de
sire to be associated with the
social program of a women's
row house. Cohesion, in the final
analysis, is what allows a living
group to function as a group.
No significant amount of re
sponsibility can be delegated
within the group and no abun
dance of beneficial interpersonal
contacts will develop without it.
As a member of a Stanford
fraternity my main interest is
obviously with the effect which
a change in the size, selection
procedures and composition of
the group would have on the
character of the fraternity sys
tem. Fraternities have perhaps
the greatest amount of cohesion
of any type of living group at
Stanford. I would object stren
uously to any attempts at change
which would destroy the cohe
sion in a fraternity house or
any other living arrangement
on the Stanford campus.
Yet it is also very clear to me
that changes are necessary
within the fraternity system. As
presently constituted the system
is generally lacking in intellec
tual and cultural life, and offers
mainly social and athletic exper
iences.

Hqpefully, I have presented a
cleai problem. There exists a
dichotomy at Stanford between
intel '.ectual and social life. A now
grading system is one remedy.
Mor ; germaine to the topic of
this article is the second remedy
—that of manipulating the char
acter of living groups ,and par
ticularly fraternities, in the areas
of size, selection procedures, etc.
The' effect which these changes
havie on the essential quality of
cohesion must also retain an
important role in any investiga
tion.
lln general it is true that
chjj.nges suggested and carried
out from within the fraternity
system have a greater chance
of success and acceptance than
those originating in other
sources. In fact, the greatest
challenge to the fraternity sys
tem is this obligation to its
members to unify intellectual
stimulation and social life from
w Ithin.
In the years ahead Stanford
fraternities will be faced with a
membership crises in two ways:
i: the freshmen become increas
ingly sceptical of the benefits of
fraternity life; and 2) construc
ti on of the new clusters will
fc rce fraternities to expand their
membership to fill the larger
lif/ing plants. Happily, fraterni
ti ?s are in a position to answer
these challenges (as well as the
greater one of lack of intellec
tual atmosphere), because they
inherently process a great de
gree of cohesion and thus the
a pility to channel their energies
toward specific goals.
IThe central question to be
answered is, "What changes
njiust be made to insure the
union of social and intellectual
li fe?"
The main area in which the
character of a fraternity af
fects its intellectual atmosphere
ifc the composition of the group
(who is a member and who is
rot), and indirectly, the method
ii which outsiders join the group
(ithe selection process).
Rush's Sad Tale
Rush, then, is a topic which
: raternities must investigate if
ihey intend to survive as educa
tional institutions. Even a partial
litudy of rush reveals a sad tale
of mediocrity and lack of direc
tion.
To put it bluntly, rush, as it
jjs presently constituted, does not
select for intellectual values. On
the contrary, the intellectual
Capabilities of a rushee are large

ly irrelevant to his success or
failure as a prospective frater
nity brother.
What rush does select for is
social grace and poise. That this
neglect of the intellectual i:
favor of the social is present in
rush can hardly be contested.
Rush week is a series of social
encounters (parties, open houses,
etc.),, during which the socially
comfortable rushee stands out.
The effect which this separation
of intellectual and social has o'i
the living after rush is obvious.
The separation is carried over
as an important characteristic
of the group and the dichotomy
between living group and class
room is strengthened.
The solution is clear. Rush
must either combine intellectual
and social criteria or be replaced
by some substitute which will.
As far as I am concerned, judg
ment by a living group of a
rushee's intellectual ability will
be very difficult to combine with
judgment of his social ability.
This combination is impractical
because of the broad ramifica
tions which the term "intellec
tual ability" includes.
For a living group to attempt
to pass judgment on a rushee's
intellect merely on the basis of
casual encounters during rush
week is simply not feasible.
When one takes into account
the amount of time available
and the number of rushees, the
impossibility of rationally judg
ing each one individually on the
basis of social and intellectual
criteria becomes clear.
Self-Selection
A second solution, and one
which fraternity men have his
torically avoided, is the concept
living group by the rushee. Un
der this system each fraternity
would judge itself as to its
unique orientation and emphasu
in social and intellectual life.
The result of this judgment
would be available to the rushee
through a pamphlet or maga
zine, etc. In turn each rushee
would examine himself and de
termine his own personal intel
lectual and social pattern. I'
would then be a simple matter
for the rushee to choose the liv
ing group which best suited him.
The benefiits of self-judgment
by the living group and rushee
as compared with judgment of
each other are obvious. Fraterni
ties can easily take the lead in
this publication process and
other living groups might fol-
low. The end result would be a
system in which the rushee ra
tionally choose his place of resi
dence on the basis of personal
contact and pamphlets published
by every living group on cam
pus.
Clearly the above proposal
would abolish many facets of
rush as practiced today. With
final choice resting with the
rushee rather than the living
group much of the harmful
psychological pressure on indi
vidual rushees would be avoided.
The social atmosphere and
events of rush week, which
would be maintained, would nec
essarily be more relaxed. Most
important of all, however, is the
union of social and intellectual
criteria into one stream which
might be a major step along the
road to making all living groups

true educational institutions.
Flaw Of Bush
The argument may be raised
that abolishing the right of selec
tion by the fraternity will also
abolish the cohesion and "broth
erhood" which makes fraternity
life unique. While it is true that
cohesion is vital for the function
ing of a group as to social and
intellectual programs, it would
be difficult to show how rush it
self created this cohesion.
Rather, it is common interests
or goals which create cohesion
and these are perhaps more ef
ficiently selected for under the
above proposal, by which a
rushee chooses a living group
whose social and intellectual in
terests are similar to his own.
It would be difficult to con
clude a discussion of the pres
ent selection process at Stan

ford without mentioning the
moral implications involved. For
too long fraternity men have
ignored the psychological harm
of rush or brushed it off with "it
happens every day in the out
side world." The time has come
for the realization that passing
judgment on a person's social
poise after short aquaintance
may be a dangerous relic of the
past. I personally know of far
too many cases in which rushees
were deeply shaken by rejection
during rush. The irony of the
matter is that often the re
jection is made on totally in
valid grounds. The ultimate
q u e s t i on concerns a living
group's right to judge an indi
vidual's social worth under any
circumstances.
Conclusion
Hopefully, the above approach
is not overly dogmatic with re

gard to the role of living groups
at Stanford. I do not claim that
my proposal is the only valid
method of uniting social and in
tellectual life in Stanford fra
ternities and in other living
groups as well. There should he
no one solution but a wide range
of choices open to students— fra
ternities, independent housing,
the Grove experiment, coeduca
tional housing, etc. Each must
solve the problem of separation
of social and intellectual life in
its own unique manner. Fra
ternities are in a position to
take the lead, through internal
changes, in the reform of hous
ing at Stanford. As with any re
form, the solution at Stanford
must begin with awareness of
the problem and then interested
students must devote their tal
ents to finding a workable solu
tion.
It is clear to me, as the 1967
academic year progresses, that
critical discussion and investi
gation must begin dealing with
the role of the various living
groups at Stanford and with
their success or failure as edu
cational institutions.
Increasingly, concern at Stan
ford about these problems is
confined to emotional vendettas
following an attack by fraternity
members upon the student body
president or to sporadic protests
against the isolation of fresh
men in the University commu
nity. Plainly, there is no general
awareness on the part of Stan
ford students of the educational
opportunities which might be
provided by a living group.

The situation may be clarified.
In the mind of the student body
there exists a strict separation
between intellectual life, i.e. the
classroom, and social life, i.e. the
living group. Thus the living
group, be it a house in Stern
Hall, Toyon Hall, a women's resi
dence, or a fraternity house, all
too often becomes a refuge from
the intellectual life of the Quad.
The living group is for social
and athletic life, the classroom
for intellectual life. This dicho
tomy is a very serious develop
ment indeed. In fact, it is a
threat to the educational pro
cess, the benefits of which are
certainly the goal of every sin
cere student.
Possibilities
The problem then becomes one
of arousing student interest for
modifying the role of living
groups and for devoting energy
to the study of living groups
as educational institutions. The
fjossibilities for a living group
n which intellectual life is com
bined with social life are stag
gering.
To quote from a report pre
pared at Amherst College in
1964 entitled Report of the Sub
committee to Study Student
Life, "What fraternity house
can now find room to offer an
an exciting collection of records

and the privacy in which to listen
to them, an up-to-date non-aca
demic library and varied periodi
cals, a dark room and develop
ing equipment, a small studio
with materials for painting and
sculpting, a good collection of
old films and a place for showing
them, a wood working shop, a
little theater, or a good game
room, perhaps a suite for visi
tors, or even the facilities for
after-dinner coffee?"
I think it must be obvious to
every reader that this same
question might be asked at Stan
ford with regard to any living
group. Few, if any, groups at
Stanford offer such facilities.
To quote further: "Too sel
dom is there a large enough
minority to attempt a dramatic
skit, a musical performance, a
poetry reading, a political action
or debate, a trip to Boston or
New York, a hike across the
Holyoke Range, a publication,
or simply an evening in some
one's room with an invited fac
ulty guest."
Fundamental Problem
Here again the best most liv
ing groups at Stanford can point
to are infrequent efforts along
these lines of intelligent dis
cussions or of cultural enrich
ment.
I am firmly convinced that the
barren living group arrange
ments at Stanford stem from
the fundamental problem—that
of a complete separation of so
cial life from intellectual life.
The result of this separation is
that faculty-student interactions,
cultural programs and intellec
tual involvement are divorced
from the living group because
the living group, in most cases,
functions solely as a social and
athletic center.
Thus the dilemma for this
generation of students is clear.
A method must be found for
making living groups intellec
tual groups as well, from the
Wilbur House, to the Florence
Moore House, to the fraternity
house.
It seems to me that there are
two main areas in which the
problem may be attacked. First
is that of the grading system.
As long as Stanford maintains
a strict system of grades, class
room learning and intellectual
life will be inseparably linked.
This linkage occurs in the fol
lowing manner. The pressure on
students at the present time for
grade-achievement leading to
graduate school or employment

is intense. Living groups have
relatively little effect on this
achievement because the achieve
ments of learning, i.e. grades,
are found only in the classroom,
and the living group in general
has no direct connection with
learning.
If, however, the University
were to gradually change to a
widespread pass-fail system, as

would seem to be the trend pres
ently, intellectual life in living
groups could be increasingly
fostered. With such a change the
student could concentrate on in
tellectual growth in the living
group free from the pressure of
grade-achievement. From a pure
ly pragmatic standpoint it is
apparent that the living group,
which claims much more of the
student's time than the class
room, would be the most efficient
source of intellectual inter
change.
The Variables
The second area of attack lies
in the actual character of living
groups as to size, selection pro
cedures, composition, location,
etc. It is clear to me that these
variables should be manipulated
to create living groups in which
the maximum wedding of intel
lectual and social life takes place.
The experiment in the Phi Delt
house is an example of this pro
cess in its infancy. Clearly no
one solution will be found as to
size, selection procedure, compo
sition, and location. Rather, a
wide choice of living groups
would be available, all of which
afforded a viable combination of
intellectual and social life, yet
each maintaining its own unique
emphasis or orientation.
Clearly, however, this second
area of attack involves consid
erable re-evaluation by existing
living groups and by interested
students.

ables mentioned above upon pos
sible intellectual social interac
