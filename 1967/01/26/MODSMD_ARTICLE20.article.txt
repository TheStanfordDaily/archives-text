# Cindermen Work All Year To Gain Victory In Spring
## 
### JIM MALLERY 
Ask any Stanford trackman if
he is going to turn out for track
in the spring and he will prob
ably chuckle, maybe even double
over into hysterics. If you're
only a freshman, or perhaps a
76-year-old grandmother, maybe
he'll have patience and explain
to you that he has been "turn
ing out" for track since classes
started in the fall.
Unlike high school, track at
Stanford University is an all
year program. You can't afford
to ease off. Once you do, your
competitors pull ahead, and
Stanford, like any other large
university knows this well.
Running: Starts With Classes
From the first day of class in
the fall, Coach Payton Jordan
has his team in an intensive
conditioning program, ranging
from military presses in the
weight shack to long distance
running on the golf course.
They work for muscle and stam
ina, leaving the fine tuning for
later.
As well as enrolling in the five
day track class, most of the
team enrolls in one other physi
cal education class designed to
aid them in their event or to
strengthen an outstanding weak
ness.
From Weightllfting To Boxing
For instance the weight men,

shot putters, discus and javelin
throwers, most likely will sign
up for weightlifting on a three
day per week schedule. The
same might be true of a runner
who has a long history of pulled
muscles. The extra strength at
tained in this class may curb
his troubles.
A jumper or pole vaulter
might enroll in gymnastics to
increase both his strength and
agility. Combatives (boxing) is
also used in this type of training
to teach the individual aggres
siveness.
Cross-Country
The distance men, under the
direction of Jerry Barland,
cross-country coach and assist
ant track coach, keep in shape
through the cross-country pro
gram. Lasting throughout the
fall quarter, they run their 4
mile race against such powers
as UCLA, USC, Cal, and San
Jose State.
Near the end of the fall term
the team begins competing in
the AAU- all-comers meets held
every Saturday at the College of
San Mateo.
This competition serves to
prepare the athlete for later
conference meets. Also, it gives
him insight into areas in which
he needs work, for it is in com
petition that he sees fully what
he is capable of doing.

Progress Records Kept
Throughout his training pro
gram, Coach Jordan has his
athletes keep a concise training
log book, listing workouts for
each day, plus comments on
progress they have made. In
this way one can refer back to
see which type of workout
helped him most, and which did
the least good.
After a Christmas vacation,
which is passed by following a
"suggested" training schedule,
the athlete again enrolls in the
two P.E. courses, track and an
extra conditioner.
Winter Load Picks Up
The tempo of the workouts
increases as the season nears.
Field events begin concentrating
more on technique, and sprint
ers work on starts and stride.
In addition to all-comers meets,
the annual Red vs. White intra
squad meet is held in February.
This climaxes the long, presea
son training period, and the men
are nearing top competitive
shape.
Minimum Standards
An added incentive for good
performance in this meet is the
minimum standards of perform
ance which must be met by
each man before he can turn out
in the spring. The Red vs. White
meet in the final chance to meet
the requirement.
These standards are marks,
based on performances of years
past, that have been set by the
coaches to insure that only
those who will help the team
will be on the track squad for
Stanford. The marks are low
enough, however, that they will
not keep anyone who is quali
fied from competing in the
AAWU.
For a few, the season comes
early, as invitational indoor
meets are held througout the
country. Stanford has several
men who draw invitations from
the West Coast towns of Los
Angeles, San Francisco, Port
land, and Seattle.
Winning's Worth It
By the time March rolls
around and the "season" begins,
the athletes are keyed for their
best. To the onlooker, it may
appear that the sacrifice is more
than it is worth. But as Jim
Ryun has said, "If it was as bad
as some people say, I would
never do it."
That probably sums up the
feelings of everyone on the
track. For them, the rewards far
outnumber the sacrifices.

meets are held througout the
country. Stanford has several
men who draw invitations from
the West Coast towns of Los
Angeles, San Francisco, Port
land, and Seattle.
Winning's Worth It
By the time March rolls
around and the "season" begins,
the athletes are keyed for their
best. To the onlooker, it may
appear that the sacrifice is more
than it is worth. But as Jim
Ryun has said, "If it was as bad
as some people say, I would
never do it."
That probably sums up the
feelings of everyone on the
track. For them, the rewards far
outnumber the sacrifices.
Ask any Stanford trackman if
he is going to turn out for track
in the spring and he will prob
ably chuckle, maybe even double
over into hysterics. If you're
only a freshman, or perhaps a
76-year-old grandmother, maybe
he'll have patience and explain
to you that he has been "turn
ing out" for track since classes
started in the fall.
Unlike high school, track at
Stanford University is an all
year program. You can't afford
to ease off. Once you do, your
competitors pull ahead, and
Stanford, like any other large
university knows this well.
Running: Starts With Classes
From the first day of class in
the fall, Coach Payton Jordan
has his team in an intensive
conditioning program, ranging
from military presses in the
weight shack to long distance
running on the golf course.
They work for muscle and stam
ina, leaving the fine tuning for
later.
As well as enrolling in the five
day track class, most of the
team enrolls in one other physi
cal education class designed to
aid them in their event or to
strengthen an outstanding weak
ness.
From Weightllfting To Boxing
For instance the weight men,

shot putters, discus and javelin
throwers, most likely will sign
up for weightlifting on a three
day per week schedule. The
same might be true of a runner
who has a long history of pulled
muscles. The extra strength at
tained in this class may curb
his troubles.
A jumper or pole vaulter
might enroll in gymnastics to
increase both his strength and
agility. Combatives (boxing) is
also used in this type of training
to teach the individual aggres
siveness.
Cross-Country
The distance men, under the
direction of Jerry Barland,
cross-country coach and assist
ant track coach, keep in shape
through the cross-country pro
gram. Lasting throughout the
fall quarter, they run their 4
mile race against such powers
as UCLA, USC, Cal, and San
Jose State.
Near the end of the fall term
the team begins competing in
the AAU- all-comers meets held
every Saturday at the College of
San Mateo.
This competition serves to
prepare the athlete for later
conference meets. Also, it gives
him insight into areas in which
he needs work, for it is in com
petition that he sees fully what
he is capable of doing.

Progress Records Kept
Throughout his training pro
gram, Coach Jordan has his
athletes keep a concise training
log book, listing workouts for
each day, plus comments on
progress they have made. In
this way one can refer back to
see which type of workout
helped him most, and which did
the least good.
After a Christmas vacation,
which is passed by following a
"suggested" training schedule,
the athlete again enrolls in the
two P.E. courses, track and an
extra conditioner.
Winter Load Picks Up
The tempo of the workouts
increases as the season nears.
Field events begin concentrating
more on technique, and sprint
ers work on starts and stride.
In addition to all-comers meets,
the annual Red vs. White intra
squad meet is held in February.
This climaxes the long, presea
son training period, and the men
are nearing top competitive
shape.
Minimum Standards
An added incentive for good
performance in this meet is the
minimum standards of perform
ance which must be met by
each man before he can turn out
in the spring. The Red vs. White
meet in the final chance to meet
the requirement.
These standards are marks,
based on performances of years
past, that have been set by the
coaches to insure that only
those who will help the team
will be on the track squad for
Stanford. The marks are low
enough, however, that they will
not keep anyone who is quali
fied from competing in the
AAWU.

performance in this meet is the
minimum standards of perform
ance which must be met by
each man before he can turn out
in the spring. The Red vs. White
meet in the final chance to meet
the requirement.
These standards are marks,
based on performances of years
past, that have been set by the
coaches to insure that only
those who will help the team
will be on the track squad for
Stanford. The marks are low
enough, however, that they will
not keep anyone who is quali
fied from competing in the
AAWU.
For a few, the season comes
early, as invitational indoor
meets are held througout the
country. Stanford has several
men who draw invitations from
the West Coast towns of Los
Angeles, San Francisco, Port
land, and Seattle.
Winning's Worth It
By the time March rolls
around and the "season" begins,
the athletes are keyed for their
best. To the onlooker, it may
appear that the sacrifice is more
than it is worth. But as Jim
Ryun has said, "If it was as bad
as some people say, I would
never do it."
That probably sums up the
feelings of everyone on the
track. For them, the rewards far
outnumber the sacrifices.
Ask any Stanford trackman if
he is going to turn out for track
in the spring and he will prob
ably chuckle, maybe even double
over into hysterics. If you're
only a freshman, or perhaps a
76-year-old grandmother, maybe
he'll have patience and explain
to you that he has been "turn
ing out" for track since classes
started in the fall.
Unlike high school, track at
Stanford University is an all
year program. You can't afford
to ease off. Once you do, your
competitors pull ahead, and
Stanford, like any other large
university knows this well.
Running: Starts With Classes
From the first day of class in
the fall, Coach Payton Jordan
has his team in an intensive
conditioning program, ranging
from military presses in the
weight shack to long distance
running on the golf course.
They work for muscle and stam
ina, leaving the fine tuning for
later.
As well as enrolling in the five
day track class, most of the
team enrolls in one other physi
cal education class designed to
aid them in their event or to
strengthen an outstanding weak
ness.
From Weightllfting To Boxing
For instance the weight men,

shot putters, discus and javelin
throwers, most likely will sign
up for weightlifting on a three
day per week schedule. The
same might be true of a runner
who has a long history of pulled
muscles. The extra strength at
tained in this class may curb
his troubles.
A jumper or pole vaulter
might enroll in gymnastics to
increase both his strength and
agility. Combatives (boxing) is
also used in this type of training
to teach the individual aggres
siveness.
Cross-Country
The distance men, under the
direction of Jerry Barland,
cross-country coach and assist
ant track coach, keep in shape
through the cross-country pro
gram. Lasting throughout the
fall quarter, they run their 4
mile race against such powers
as UCLA, USC, Cal, and San
Jose State.
Near the end of the fall term
the team begins competing in
the AAU- all-comers meets held
every Saturday at the College of
San Mateo.
This competition serves to
prepare the athlete for later
conference meets. Also, it gives
him insight into areas in which
he needs work, for it is in com
petition that he sees fully what
he is capable of doing.

Progress Records Kept
Throughout his training pro
gram, Coach Jordan has his
athletes keep a concise training
log book, listing workouts for
each day, plus comments on
progress they have made. In
this way one can refer back to
see which type of workout
helped him most, and which did
the least good.
After a Christmas vacation,
which is passed by following a
"suggested" training schedule,
the athlete again enrolls in the
two P.E. courses, track and an
extra conditioner.
Winter Load Picks Up
The tempo of the workouts
increases as the season nears.
Field events begin concentrating
more on technique, and sprint
ers work on starts and stride.
In addition to all-comers meets,
the annual Red vs. White intra
squad meet is held in February.
This climaxes the long, presea
son training period, and the men
are nearing top competitive
shape.
