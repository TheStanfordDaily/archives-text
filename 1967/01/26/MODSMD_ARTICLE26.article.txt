# Some Thoughts On Rush
## 
### 
When is a fraternity not a fraternity? When it
abolishes selective rush. Anonymous
Fraternity rush will begin soon, and the usual
brouhaha over selective procedures seems to
have already started.
We doubt that the arguments for and against
rush, which lie at the heart of any attack or de
fense of fraternities, have changed much since
fraternities were introduced at Stanford in 1891.
They certainly have not changed in the last four
years. But the case for a residence as an integral
part of the educational experience has changed.
In an interpretive article which begins on page
four of today's Daily, Carl Mundt details the
shortcomings not only of fraternities but of all
Stanford's living options in their efforts to unify
social and academic interests.
We agree with Mundt that fraternities have a
good opportunity to take the lead in this area by
virtue of the cohesiveness which is central in any
fraternity.
But what bearing, we ask, does rush have on
cohesiveness?
Nevitt Sanford points to the spirit of old sol
diers with which freshman look back upon their
first year in the college residence as one sort of
cohesiveness. And one prominent Interfraternity
Council officer seemed to be speaking along
similar lines when he noted last spring in a Daily
Forum that the fraternity was one of the few
places a man could go in the academic commu
nity when he failed and not be rejected. We
doubt that fraternities would like to limit the
nature of their cohesiveness to this sort of sur
vivor complex.
And if cohesiveness is to extend to intellectual
and extracurricular interests, then we frankly
challenge the validity and the efficiency of the
present rush procedures.
Amdist the claims of interesting diversity and
diverse interest which fill rush booklets, we find

it difficult to discern the character of a given
house, and a limited number of open houses does
not fill the bill.
Joint committees have worked in good faith
for years try ing to promote the best measure of
contact between fraternities and freshman; oth
ers with less faith have tried to "keep the shoe
salesmen out of Wilbur;" and still others have
made the best use of dirty rush and plain pres
sure.
The one premise that underlies each of these
efforts is that the selection of members is the
primary prerogative of the house, and beyond
this, that every candidate must be acceptable to
each member, with the possible exception of one
or two.
Any proposal for self-selection or draw has a
Utopian ring—in large part because it has never
been tried. And in this context it will be inter
esting to watch the Beta Chi open rush. Yet any
house which has sufficiently defined and com
municated its character, whatever that char
acter, has little worry in attracting those who
might be "incompatible" or in failing to attain
cohesiveness.
While we are in complete opposition with our
anonymous philosopher quoted above, we con
cede that it is time for a reform and not a revo
lution. Rush is not likely to wither this year, or
any other.
If rush is to improve however, initiative must
come from the individual house and not the sys
tem. In particular, initiative to choose members
upon merit, rather than absence of detractors,
rests with the members of the individual house
and not the system.
And if a house successfully bridges the gap
between social and academic, it will not be be
cause of rush procedures, but because that house
communicated its goals and values and drew
those who were willing to share them.

it difficult to discern the character of a given
house, and a limited number of open houses does

Joint committees have worked in good faith
for years try ing to promote the best measure of
contact between fraternities and freshman; oth
ers with less faith have tried to "keep the shoe

The one premise that underlies each of these

this, that every candidate must be acceptable to
each member, with the possible exception of one

Any proposal for self-selection or draw has a
Utopian ring—in large part because it has never
been tried. And in this context it will be inter
esting to watch the Beta Chi open rush. Yet any
house which has sufficiently defined and com
municated its character, whatever that char
acter, has little worry in attracting those who
might be "incompatible" or in failing to attain
cohesiveness.
While we are in complete opposition with our
anonymous philosopher quoted above, we con

any other.
If rush is to improve however, initiative must
come from the individual house and not the sys

upon merit, rather than absence of detractors,
rests with the members of the individual house
and not the system.
And if a house successfully bridges the gap
between social and academic, it will not be be
cause of rush procedures, but because that house
communicated its goals and values and drew

Fraternity rush will begin soon, and the usual
brouhaha over selective procedures seems to
have already started.
We doubt that the arguments for and against
rush, which lie at the heart of any attack or de
fense of fraternities, have changed much since
fraternities were introduced at Stanford in 1891.
They certainly have not changed in the last four
years. But the case for a residence as an integral
part of the educational experience has changed.
In an interpretive article which begins on page
four of today's Daily, Carl Mundt details the
shortcomings not only of fraternities but of all
Stanford's living options in their efforts to unify
social and academic interests.
We agree with Mundt that fraternities have a
good opportunity to take the lead in this area by
virtue of the cohesiveness which is central in any
fraternity.
But what bearing, we ask, does rush have on
cohesiveness?
Nevitt Sanford points to the spirit of old sol
diers with which freshman look back upon their
first year in the college residence as one sort of
cohesiveness. And one prominent Interfraternity
Council officer seemed to be speaking along
similar lines when he noted last spring in a Daily
Forum that the fraternity was one of the few
places a man could go in the academic commu
nity when he failed and not be rejected. We
doubt that fraternities would like to limit the
nature of their cohesiveness to this sort of sur
vivor complex.
And if cohesiveness is to extend to intellectual
and extracurricular interests, then we frankly
challenge the validity and the efficiency of the
present rush procedures.
