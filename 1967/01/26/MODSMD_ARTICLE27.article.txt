Perhaps, just perhaps, it is
time to stop talking about Dave
Harris, LASSU, and OFF, and to
begin talking about a really ma
jor campus problem â€” roads.
Stanford's roads have an effect,
every day, every trip, on more
than 8,000 students, faculty, and
staff. The effect is usually dis
astrous.
Some of the worst roads in
Santa Clara County can be
found on the Farm. Not only
are these roads expensive for
the commuter, they also com
prise a tremendous safety haz
ard.
Potholes, ruts, bumps, and
ditches do terrible things to a
car. Shock absorbers are quick
ly reduced to junk, springs de
teriorate, and ball joints (part
of the steering mechanism) give
out. These are expensive items
to replace.
The main problem with Stan
ford's roads, however, is that
they are dangerous. Accidents
have been caused by far smaller
deviations in surfacing than are
common on Palm Drive or Gal
vez Street. Negotiating Serra
Street is like driving through
an obstacle course on a Detroit
test track.
Then, there is the rain. It
would seem that the constant
flooding in front of the BAC
and at Math Corner would give
someone the idea that there is
something wrong with the grad
ing of Galvez and Serra at those
points. Anyway there are pud
dles (lakes?), and driving
through them is a sure way to

lose your brakes and run the
next Stop Sign that you come to.
There is, of course, a solution,
and that is to regrade and repave
all existing campus roads. School
would not have to be closed,
nor traffic rerouted. The City of
Palo Alto managed to repave

and reline all of University Ave
nue overnight. Surely Stanford
must have at its beck and call
similar resources.
Then again, may they do not.
The expansion of Campus Drive
has been going on for over three
months, with no end in sight.

Maybe, just maybe, thas is the
best we can do, but I doubt it.
Are we, members of this great
university, going to sit by and
watch our physical plant go to
hell. Buildings are no good if
you can't get to them. How about
it? Huh?
