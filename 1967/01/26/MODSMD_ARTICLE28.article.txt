## Haight On Love: Pleasing Insight 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Congratulations to Tim Haight
for his: "Tune In On The Revo
lution Of Love And Understand
ing," in Friday's Daily. It was
as penetrating and humane
journalism as one can expect.
Its sensitivity was no doubt
magnified by the contrast with
the piece of straight middle
class projection reprinted from
the Richmond Independent
which had the ill-forunte of
competing with Tim Haight for
space.

A few months ago someone
wrote you a letter in which he
complained that the new Under
graduate Library was too con
ducive to sleep. I would like to
announce that the problem has
been solved. The library is now
too noisy to sleep. In fact, no one
can study in the library, much
less sleep. The other night
everyone was no noisy that I
returned to Wilbur and was able
to write this letter in complete
peace and quiet.
I am not complaining about
occasional whispers, but when
students stage running conver
sations in the middle of study
areas, or call to friends across
the balconies, then it's time for
a change. Each student should
consider the right of others with
respect to the library and its
use. With a little cooperation
quiet can be restored. Perhaps
a few students will fall asleep,
but a far greater number will
be able to study again.

Editor, The Daily:
We are writing to set the rec
ord straight, lest false inferences
be drawn from the account of
our appearance at Branner Hall
on Tuesday night.
First, the article simply re
verses the whole thrust of our
argument that what students
have taken for hypocrisy in the
"lag between theory and prac
tice" has resulted from com
plexities in running a large uni
versity which they fail utterly to
take into account. We talked at
length about ways in which the

University has taken their views
into account.
Second, we both expressed
the hope that the OFF issue
would be settled with a dispatch
satisfactory to the students. We
did not presume to guess what
the decision of the University
would be or to be "optimistic"
that it would conform to the
obvious wishes of our audience.
Virgil Whitaker recalled, in
fact, that his personal views
were strongly affected by a de
votion to the policy of a resi
dence university that dated way
back to the winter of 1928, when
he moved into Branner Hall
after a harrowing period of ofT
campus residence!
We are both concerned about
this account because it misrep
resents our whole position dur
ing a meeting which we enjoyed
and felt to be constructive. The
Daily reporter seems to have
heard what he wanted to hear
rather than what we said.

• In The Stars
Editor, The Daily:
I suspect the real reason Gov
ernor Reagan was antagonistic
toward President Kerr is be
cause the University of Cali
fornia does not offer courses in
astrology and alchemy, thus de
priving the Creative Society of
a basis for decision-making and
a possible source of revenue. If
this is true, the person ideally
suited to head the University
and direct these investigations
would be Max Rafferty, the
finest mind of the 12th century.

Congratulations to Bob Fish
man for injecting a bit of humor
into the Fun Stan-Undergradu
ate Library situation. Unfortu
nately, it's hard to keep smiling
every time one's frisked by the
goon at the gate — it's a very
UGLY feeling.
