# Further LASSU Action Possible In Packer Committee Controversy
## 
### 
The Packer committee to study edu
cational programs will probably be the
major issue at tonight's Legislature
meeting, according to Speaker Tom
Forstenzer.
Officially, student members of the
committee are to be selected by
President Sterling.
In last week's LASSU meeting, how
ever, a resolution was passed sup
porting selection by the President of
the ASSU.
The resolution urged students to re
frain from applying for the commit
tee as long as students were not in
charge of selection.

It also called for equal representa
tion of faculty and students on the
committee.
Selection by the administration
"does not allow for the proper repre
senation of student," the resolution
read.
"The legislature has shown itself to
be crucially concerned with this is
sue," Forstenzer stated, "and it will
undoubtedly take further action on
the measure."
Appropriations
In addition, the Coffee House Com
mittee will request an allocation for
a coffee house to be established in

Tresidder. The proposal was approved
by the TMU board this week and will
come before the TMU committee next
week.
Also, LASSU will consider a $4737.30
appropriation to the ASSU Speech As
sociation. The appropriation will pay
for debate trips to USC, Denver, Ore
ver State, Cal Tech, University of the
Pacific, Sacramento State, and Fresno
State during Winter and Spring Quar
ters. The appropriation was referred
to committee last week.
Tonight's Legislature meeting will
be held a 7:30 p.m. in room 320 in
Geology Corner.
