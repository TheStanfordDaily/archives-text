## Discoveries Half Way Through A Poem 
### Nick Selby 
"A ridiculous assignment,"
said I to my roommate as I com
plete my 350,000 th recital of
"Crock Brag" in preparation
for my Voice Project English
class.
He, on the brink of lunacy
after hearing steadily for a week
how I was "half-horse, half-alli
gator" assured me that indeed
it was.
I recided to give his ears a
rest and let my gentle couplets
fall elsewhere, hopefully on
more appreciative ears in this
community of scholars. After I
closed the door, I heard the lock
go "click."
Sewer Trouble
I began a stroll around Wilbur
Hall. Thoroughly caught up in
the ecstasy of my first perfect
rendition, I was so in the clouds
that I almost fell into a sewer
ditch. The words of a famous
S.U. advisor came immediately

to mind: "Keep your eyes on the
sky but your feet on the ground."
But a giant stride lifted me
over the chasm and I con
tinued, only to be nearly run
over by an oncharging sewer
pipe truck. I did a neat shuffle
a la Jackie Gleason to the side
and glanched back at the driver.
He was laughing at my talent—
"and away we go!" smiled I
and walked on.
'Fore!'
I walked along the edge of
Campus Drive and saw a little
golf cart transporting a girl with
a broken leg and her boyfriend.
It chugged on at five miles an
hour, passed by numerous cars
including one driven by one of
Stanford's finest. The police
man stopped and asked what the
trouble was.
They said there was none. He
called out, "It might move bet
ter if you got all that weight out

of there." The boy, comfortably
sprawled with his arm close
around the girl, made no effort
to speed the vehicle by getting
out. With so many places to go
so close at hand, his last worry
was slowing traflic.
Crazy?
"Can wade the Mississippi, leap
the Ohio, ride upon a streak of
lightning, . . My oration had
stopped too late. A cyclist had
heard me. He looked at me as
if I were crazy. Since he was
headed toward the health cen
ter, I decided to give him no
chance to have me brought in
for observation ,and hurried on.
I turned up Serra Street to
ward Hoover Tower.
I neared the eating club bas
ketball courts. "Such energy,"
marvelled I at their jump shots,
lay-ups, and double dribbles.
The sun set behind Encina as
I continued my rigorous hike. A

girl motorcyclist, complete with
helmet and miniskirt, passed,
followed by what appeared to be
the Stanford horse van. Horses
on the Farm?
Man From Chaos
Finally I reached the corner
of Galvez and Serra. A police
man pulled up and parked his
motorcycle, getting ready to do
his part in creating the confu
sion and chaos at this daily 5
p.m. bottleneck.
Oops, someone ran the stop
sign. Out fired the cop, desert
ing his post, but hot in pursuit
of a fine collection. He flagged
the jeep a half mile later. Wheth
er he ever returned is matter of
pure speculation.
While he was gone, I observed
the wooden walls outside the
addition for the Hoover Library.
Along with the paintaings of sail
boats and Indians, there was a
neat stencil of Delta Tau Delta
above a swaztika—a picturesque
scene for Stanford visitors if
ever there was one.
Race Is On
The five o'clock bell and horn
went off as a track runner
streaked past me. I wasn't sure
if the noises marked the start
of his race or were produced by
the last gasps of secretaries
killed by an overdose of IBM
cards and tuition bills.
I had walked up Galvez Street
to the Meyer Library and no
thing untoward had occured,
when I suddenly spotted a jolie
fill© of my acquaintance. My
path was hastily rerounted to
ward Branner Hall. Upon reach
ing her, I regan to recite.
But alas, she proved no audi
ence for my oratory. My cam
pus stroll ended, I returned to
my room, where I burst in
with, "I'm THAT David Crock
ett "
"As, Stanford, what hast thou
wrought?" my roommate sighed.
. . half-horse, half-aligator,"
I answered.

closed the door, I heard the lock
go "click."
Sewer Trouble
I began a stroll around Wilbur
Hall. Thoroughly caught up in
the ecstasy of my first perfect
rendition, I was so in the clouds
that I almost fell into a sewer
ditch. The words of a famous
S.U. advisor came immediately

to mind: "Keep your eyes on the
sky but your feet on the ground."
But a giant stride lifted me
over the chasm and I con
tinued, only to be nearly run
over by an oncharging sewer
pipe truck. I did a neat shuffle
a la Jackie Gleason to the side
and glanched back at the driver.
He was laughing at my talent—
"and away we go!" smiled I
and walked on.
'Fore!'
I walked along the edge of
Campus Drive and saw a little
golf cart transporting a girl with
a broken leg and her boyfriend.
It chugged on at five miles an
hour, passed by numerous cars
including one driven by one of
Stanford's finest. The police
man stopped and asked what the
trouble was.
They said there was none. He
called out, "It might move bet
ter if you got all that weight out

of there." The boy, comfortably
sprawled with his arm close
around the girl, made no effort
to speed the vehicle by getting
out. With so many places to go
so close at hand, his last worry
was slowing traflic.
Crazy?
"Can wade the Mississippi, leap
the Ohio, ride upon a streak of
lightning, . . My oration had
stopped too late. A cyclist had
heard me. He looked at me as
if I were crazy. Since he was
headed toward the health cen
ter, I decided to give him no
chance to have me brought in
for observation ,and hurried on.
I turned up Serra Street to
ward Hoover Tower.
I neared the eating club bas
ketball courts. "Such energy,"
marvelled I at their jump shots,
lay-ups, and double dribbles.
The sun set behind Encina as
I continued my rigorous hike. A

girl motorcyclist, complete with
helmet and miniskirt, passed,
followed by what appeared to be
the Stanford horse van. Horses
on the Farm?
Man From Chaos
Finally I reached the corner
of Galvez and Serra. A police
man pulled up and parked his
motorcycle, getting ready to do
his part in creating the confu
sion and chaos at this daily 5
p.m. bottleneck.
Oops, someone ran the stop
sign. Out fired the cop, desert
ing his post, but hot in pursuit
of a fine collection. He flagged
the jeep a half mile later. Wheth
er he ever returned is matter of
pure speculation.
While he was gone, I observed
the wooden walls outside the
addition for the Hoover Library.
Along with the paintaings of sail
boats and Indians, there was a
neat stencil of Delta Tau Delta
above a swaztika—a picturesque
scene for Stanford visitors if
ever there was one.
Race Is On
The five o'clock bell and horn
went off as a track runner
streaked past me. I wasn't sure
if the noises marked the start
of his race or were produced by
the last gasps of secretaries
killed by an overdose of IBM
cards and tuition bills.
I had walked up Galvez Street
to the Meyer Library and no
thing untoward had occured,
when I suddenly spotted a jolie
fill© of my acquaintance. My
path was hastily rerounted to
ward Branner Hall. Upon reach
ing her, I regan to recite.
But alas, she proved no audi
ence for my oratory. My cam
pus stroll ended, I returned to
my room, where I burst in
with, "I'm THAT David Crock
ett "
"As, Stanford, what hast thou
wrought?" my roommate sighed.
. . half-horse, half-aligator,"
I answered.
"A ridiculous assignment,"
said I to my roommate as I com
plete my 350,000 th recital of
"Crock Brag" in preparation
for my Voice Project English
class.
He, on the brink of lunacy
after hearing steadily for a week
how I was "half-horse, half-alli
gator" assured me that indeed
it was.
I recided to give his ears a
rest and let my gentle couplets
fall elsewhere, hopefully on
more appreciative ears in this
community of scholars. After I
closed the door, I heard the lock

a la Jackie Gleason to the side
and glanched back at the driver.
He was laughing at my talent—
"and away we go!" smiled I
and walked on.
'Fore!'
I walked along the edge of
Campus Drive and saw a little
golf cart transporting a girl with
a broken leg and her boyfriend.
It chugged on at five miles an
hour, passed by numerous cars
including one driven by one of
Stanford's finest. The police
man stopped and asked what the
trouble was.
They said there was none. He
called out, "It might move bet
ter if you got all that weight out

of there." The boy, comfortably
sprawled with his arm close
around the girl, made no effort
to speed the vehicle by getting
out. With so many places to go
so close at hand, his last worry
was slowing traflic.
Crazy?
"Can wade the Mississippi, leap
the Ohio, ride upon a streak of
lightning, . . My oration had
stopped too late. A cyclist had
heard me. He looked at me as
if I were crazy. Since he was
headed toward the health cen
ter, I decided to give him no
chance to have me brought in
for observation ,and hurried on.
I turned up Serra Street to
ward Hoover Tower.
I neared the eating club bas
ketball courts. "Such energy,"
marvelled I at their jump shots,
lay-ups, and double dribbles.
The sun set behind Encina as
I continued my rigorous hike. A

girl motorcyclist, complete with
helmet and miniskirt, passed,
followed by what appeared to be
the Stanford horse van. Horses
on the Farm?
Man From Chaos
Finally I reached the corner
of Galvez and Serra. A police
man pulled up and parked his
motorcycle, getting ready to do
his part in creating the confu
sion and chaos at this daily 5
p.m. bottleneck.
Oops, someone ran the stop
sign. Out fired the cop, desert
ing his post, but hot in pursuit
of a fine collection. He flagged
the jeep a half mile later. Wheth
er he ever returned is matter of
pure speculation.
While he was gone, I observed
the wooden walls outside the
addition for the Hoover Library.
Along with the paintaings of sail
boats and Indians, there was a
neat stencil of Delta Tau Delta
above a swaztika—a picturesque
scene for Stanford visitors if
ever there was one.
Race Is On
The five o'clock bell and horn
went off as a track runner
streaked past me. I wasn't sure
if the noises marked the start
of his race or were produced by
the last gasps of secretaries
killed by an overdose of IBM
cards and tuition bills.
I had walked up Galvez Street
to the Meyer Library and no
thing untoward had occured,
when I suddenly spotted a jolie
fill© of my acquaintance. My
path was hastily rerounted to
ward Branner Hall. Upon reach
ing her, I regan to recite.
But alas, she proved no audi
ence for my oratory. My cam
pus stroll ended, I returned to
my room, where I burst in
with, "I'm THAT David Crock
ett "
"As, Stanford, what hast thou
wrought?" my roommate sighed.
. . half-horse, half-aligator,"
I answered.
"A ridiculous assignment,"
said I to my roommate as I com
plete my 350,000 th recital of
"Crock Brag" in preparation
for my Voice Project English
class.
He, on the brink of lunacy
after hearing steadily for a week
how I was "half-horse, half-alli
gator" assured me that indeed
it was.
I recided to give his ears a
rest and let my gentle couplets
fall elsewhere, hopefully on
more appreciative ears in this
community of scholars. After I
closed the door, I heard the lock
go "click."
Sewer Trouble
I began a stroll around Wilbur
Hall. Thoroughly caught up in
the ecstasy of my first perfect
rendition, I was so in the clouds
that I almost fell into a sewer
ditch. The words of a famous
S.U. advisor came immediately

to mind: "Keep your eyes on the
sky but your feet on the ground."
But a giant stride lifted me
over the chasm and I con
tinued, only to be nearly run
over by an oncharging sewer
pipe truck. I did a neat shuffle
a la Jackie Gleason to the side
and glanched back at the driver.
He was laughing at my talent—
"and away we go!" smiled I
and walked on.
