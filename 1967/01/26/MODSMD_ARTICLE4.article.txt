# Study Links Learning To Housing
## 
### CICELY BATES 
The ASSU Housing Commission
plans to release a comprehensive re
port during the first week of February
whieh will culminate a three month
study on the purposes, problems, and
present alternatives in university
housing.
Created by LASSU last October, the
Commission has divided itself into
six sub-committees and has concen
trated specifically on these six fields of
housing: The Philosophy of the Resi
dence University, Freshman Year
Housing, Fraternity Housing, Inde
pendent Men's Housing, Women's
Housing and Special Projects and Re
search.
Working on these six topics are over
fifty students and several faculty
members.
legislature Appropriation
Five hundred and fifty dollars has
been appropriated by LASSU to carry
out the studies. LASSU also gave the
Commission the power to "initiate dis
cussions, lecture groups, symposia
and other public events related to
housing problems." The privilege has
been by-passed by the Commission be

cause it wants to direct all its time
toward the report.
Originally heading the Commission
was senior Jan Jacobi. However in
November, Jacobi resigned as chair
man because he felt, according to a
letter to ASSU President Dave Harris,
that he was unable to provide the
"forceful intellectual and political lead
ership necessary for the Housing Com
mission to continue its work." In his
place Harris appointed junior Social
Thought major John Trimbur.
Trimbur feels "really satisfied with
the work and progress" accomplished
so far in the preparation of the Com
mission's report. At the present time
the sub-committees are writing their
reports and as soon as all the material
is assimilated, the report will be pub
lished. Over forty meetings and hun
dreds of hours of research have gone
into the nearly completed report.
Existing Residential Plans
Essentially the report will present
a criticism of existing residential
plans, and some proposals to do some
thing to make the residences more of
places of "learning.' Some of the
main proposals being currently stud

ied by the Commission include the in
tegration of freshmen and co-ed hous
ing, Trimbur indicated.
The report will also take a favorable
stand towards OFF and consider ex
tensively ways to make fraternities
a more meaningful part of the Stan
ford community. The proposals are
intended to make resident living more
of an "educational experience" ac
cording to Chairman Trimbur.
Fifteen hundred copies of the re
port will be released to the faculty,
administration, and living groups and
what will be done with the report by
the administration will determine
LASSU's next move.
Administration Is Willing
Trimbur expressed optimism con
cerning the effects of the report. He
feels that the "administration is will
ing to experiment" but is concerned
whether the experimenting will be
done in a "meaningful way."
Trimbur further stated that the
study was made in the first place be
cause the administration was not
ready to make a comprehensive study
so it was up to the students to take
the initiative. Harris showed his ap

proval of the Commission when he
addressed an October LASSU meeting
saying, "The primary constituent in
housing would be the constituency re
sponsible for and under whose aus
pices studies of housing are done,
namely students."
Questionnaire
Although the Commission has main
ly concerned itself with the up-coming
report it also helped prepare the
questionnaire that came out of Dean
Bushnell's office. This was the report
that the women filled out in a survey
that measured their contentment with
their present living situations.
The only major disappointment that
the Commission has encountered was
the Grove Project. No proposals made
by the Commission or by LASSU it
self were considered in determining
the fate of the vacated Phi Delta
Theta house.
When the final report of the Hous
ing Commission is published its orig
inating bill will expire. The report
must be submitted before February
15 because the bill will expire on that
date even if no report has been made
by the Commission.

plans to release a comprehensive re
port during the first week of February
whieh will culminate a three month
study on the purposes, problems, and
present alternatives in university
housing.
Created by LASSU last October, the
Commission has divided itself into
six sub-committees and has concen
trated specifically on these six fields of
housing: The Philosophy of the Resi
dence University, Freshman Year
Housing, Fraternity Housing, Inde
pendent Men's Housing, Women's
Housing and Special Projects and Re
search.
Working on these six topics are over
fifty students and several faculty
members.
legislature Appropriation
Five hundred and fifty dollars has
been appropriated by LASSU to carry
out the studies. LASSU also gave the
Commission the power to "initiate dis
cussions, lecture groups, symposia
and other public events related to
housing problems." The privilege has
been by-passed by the Commission be

cause it wants to direct all its time
toward the report.
Originally heading the Commission
was senior Jan Jacobi. However in
November, Jacobi resigned as chair
man because he felt, according to a
letter to ASSU President Dave Harris,
that he was unable to provide the
"forceful intellectual and political lead
ership necessary for the Housing Com
mission to continue its work." In his
place Harris appointed junior Social
Thought major John Trimbur.
Trimbur feels "really satisfied with
the work and progress" accomplished
so far in the preparation of the Com
mission's report. At the present time
the sub-committees are writing their
reports and as soon as all the material
is assimilated, the report will be pub
lished. Over forty meetings and hun
dreds of hours of research have gone
into the nearly completed report.
Existing Residential Plans
Essentially the report will present
a criticism of existing residential
plans, and some proposals to do some
thing to make the residences more of
places of "learning.' Some of the
main proposals being currently stud

ied by the Commission include the in
tegration of freshmen and co-ed hous
ing, Trimbur indicated.
The report will also take a favorable
stand towards OFF and consider ex
tensively ways to make fraternities
a more meaningful part of the Stan
ford community. The proposals are
intended to make resident living more
of an "educational experience" ac
cording to Chairman Trimbur.
Fifteen hundred copies of the re
port will be released to the faculty,
administration, and living groups and
what will be done with the report by
the administration will determine
LASSU's next move.
Administration Is Willing
Trimbur expressed optimism con
cerning the effects of the report. He
feels that the "administration is will
ing to experiment" but is concerned
whether the experimenting will be
done in a "meaningful way."
Trimbur further stated that the
study was made in the first place be
cause the administration was not
ready to make a comprehensive study
so it was up to the students to take
the initiative. Harris showed his ap

proval of the Commission when he
addressed an October LASSU meeting
saying, "The primary constituent in
housing would be the constituency re
sponsible for and under whose aus
pices studies of housing are done,
namely students."
Questionnaire
Although the Commission has main
ly concerned itself with the up-coming
report it also helped prepare the
questionnaire that came out of Dean
Bushnell's office. This was the report
that the women filled out in a survey
that measured their contentment with
their present living situations.
The only major disappointment that
the Commission has encountered was
the Grove Project. No proposals made
by the Commission or by LASSU it
self were considered in determining
the fate of the vacated Phi Delta
Theta house.
When the final report of the Hous
ing Commission is published its orig
inating bill will expire. The report
must be submitted before February
15 because the bill will expire on that
date even if no report has been made
by the Commission.
