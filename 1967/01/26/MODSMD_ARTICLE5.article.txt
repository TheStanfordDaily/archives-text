# Faculty Committees Join In Protest Over Political Intervention At U.C.
## 
### 
Two top faculty committees yester
day issued a joint statement express
ing regret at the firing of Clark Kerr
and support for university freedom
from political pressure.
The Executive Committee and the
Advisory Board of the Academic
Council affirmed their "belief in a
system which grants reasonable
autonomy ... to university adminis
trations and faculties."
"We believe that the people of Cali
fornia are best served by universities,
both public and private, that remain
free of political pressures and encour
age intellectual innovation and contro
versy," the statement read.
Free From Interference
The statement expressed "regret
that the University of California has
lost the leadership of Clark Kerr"
and congratulated the University on
"its unprecedented progress during
his term as President."
"During its recent years of progress
the University of California has ap
peared to be largely free of political
interference," the statement con
tinued.
"We hope that the University will
continue to develop according to
established long-range plans."
Too Mild
Tomorrow afternoon the entire Aca
demic Council will hold a special
meeting to discuss the statement and
alternatives to it.
The meeting was called in response
to a petition circulated by Mathe
matics Professor Halsey Royden.
The present statement, Royden
said, is "much too bland."
He expressed hope that the Council

would approve a stronger, more blunt
resolution, but he was not sure that
it would.
Royden himself offered an alterna
tive, circulated with the petition and
appearing on the Call to Meeting to
be issued today.
Faculty Voice
A second reason for calling the
meeting, he added, is that "the only
group to speak for the faculty should
be the faculty itself."
The Advisory Board, headed by Pro
fessor Leonard Schiff, is composed of
Professors Hastor, Dugall, Hanna,

Ryan, and Chase. The Executive Com
mittee, chaired by Professor Ernest
Hilgard, includes Professors Drek
meier, Guerard, Franklin, Page,
Rambo, and Wright.
In Berkeley yesterday, Dr. Harry
R. Wellman, acting President, issued
a statement pledging to fight for the
"non political character" of the Uni
versity.
Weltman added that "As acting
President, I intend to act as Presi
dent; not be a mere 'house keeper.'"
Tuesday night, the Berkeley faculty
condemned the Regent vote ousting

Kerr as a "betrayal of trust." Their
resolution called the ouster "destruc
tive political intervention" which
could threaten survival of the Univer
sity as an institution of distinction.
In Sacramento, Governor Reagan,
who joined the fourteen in voting to
fire Kerr, denied that politics had been
involved. He and Dr. Kerr had dis
agreed sharply over Reagan's sugges
tions to impose tuition and cut the
University budget.
Chancellors of the nine campuses
will meet in Los Angeles today.
