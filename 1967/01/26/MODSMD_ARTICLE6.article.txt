# Psychologists Present Summary Of Human Research With LSD

"Psychedelics and Personality" was
discussed last night in Tresidder by
three researchers as the fourth pres
entation in the current "Frontiers of
the Mind" series.
Beginning the discussion, Dr. Jack
Downing, an Associate Professor of
Psychiatry and Preventive Medicine
at Stanford, stated that the use of
psychedelic drugs can be "personally
significant, but is of no particular
social utility."
He suggested that our culture Is
externally and materialistically orient
ed. which resulted in an increased de
sire for some type of religious or mys
tical experience.
Intensely Personal
The present widespread use of psy
chedelics was seen by Downing as
an attempt to fulfill the need for an
"intensely personal" experience which,
he said, our culture seems to stifle.
The next speaker, Dr. William Mc-
Glothlin, a Research Associate at
UCLA, described experiments on the
effects of LSD. In general, he felt that
there were no major personality
changes which could be shown to be
directly linked to drug usage. Some
participants in the experiment did feel,
however, that their aesthetic interest
had grown along with an increase in
feelings of anxiety.
McGlothlin explained that less rigid,
less dogmatic and more spontaneous
people were more strongly affected by
LSD than rigid and unspontaneous
people. Since the unrigid, spontaneous
people are more receptive to new

ideas, he found it difficult to attribute
astounding qualities to LSD.
In conclusion, McGlothlin called
LSD a "catalyst" for evaluating
belief-systems, a catalyst that is most
effective on young people of certain
personality types. He warned that the
use of LSD can be an "overwhelming
experience" for immature people who
lack some sort of structure in their
lives.
The final speaker, Dr. Frank Bar
ran, a Professor of Psychology at
Berkeley, reported on creativity stu
dies involving LSD. In an experiment

in which creative people were given
LSD, he found that people often
considered the psychedelic experience
to be stimulating. However, these
people could best incorporate psy
chedelically-induced insights into their
work when in a normal conscious
state.
After giving his definition of ex
panded consciousness, Barren stated
that LSD did expand consciousness,
but that it is uncertain as to whether
an individual can retain any of the
characteristics of expanded conscious
ness after the drug wears off.

In conclusion, McGlothlin called
LSD a "catalyst" for evaluating
belief-systems, a catalyst that is most
effective on young people of certain
personality types. He warned that the
use of LSD can be an "overwhelming
experience" for immature people who
lack some sort of structure in their
lives.
The final speaker, Dr. Frank Bar
ran, a Professor of Psychology at
Berkeley, reported on creativity stu
dies involving LSD. In an experiment

in which creative people were given
LSD, he found that people often
considered the psychedelic experience
to be stimulating. However, these
people could best incorporate psy
chedelically-induced insights into their
work when in a normal conscious
state.
After giving his definition of ex
panded consciousness, Barren stated
that LSD did expand consciousness,
but that it is uncertain as to whether
an individual can retain any of the
characteristics of expanded conscious
ness after the drug wears off.
"Psychedelics and Personality" was
discussed last night in Tresidder by
three researchers as the fourth pres
entation in the current "Frontiers of
the Mind" series.
Beginning the discussion, Dr. Jack
Downing, an Associate Professor of
Psychiatry and Preventive Medicine
at Stanford, stated that the use of
psychedelic drugs can be "personally
significant, but is of no particular
social utility."
He suggested that our culture Is
externally and materialistically orient
ed. which resulted in an increased de
sire for some type of religious or mys
tical experience.
Intensely Personal
The present widespread use of psy
chedelics was seen by Downing as
an attempt to fulfill the need for an
"intensely personal" experience which,
he said, our culture seems to stifle.
The next speaker, Dr. William Mc-
Glothlin, a Research Associate at
UCLA, described experiments on the
effects of LSD. In general, he felt that
there were no major personality
changes which could be shown to be
directly linked to drug usage. Some
participants in the experiment did feel,
however, that their aesthetic interest
had grown along with an increase in
feelings of anxiety.
McGlothlin explained that less rigid,
less dogmatic and more spontaneous
people were more strongly affected by
LSD than rigid and unspontaneous
people. Since the unrigid, spontaneous
people are more receptive to new

ideas, he found it difficult to attribute
astounding qualities to LSD.
