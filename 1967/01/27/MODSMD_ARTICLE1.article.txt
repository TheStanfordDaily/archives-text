# Symposium Will Feature W.S. Coffin
## 
### 
David Harris, Nevitt Sanford, and
William Sloane Coffin, Jr. will probe
the question "Can Our Education Meet
the Challenge?" in the second "Year of
Change" symposium. They will be
the principal speakers Sunday at 7:15
p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditorium in the
followup to November's symposium
on "The Challenge."
Sponsored by the Symposium Com
mittee of the Student-Faculty Board,
Sunday's program will differ in format
from symposiums in previous years.
One of the changes is the presenta
tion of three principle speakers rather
than several students and one guest
speaker.
Speakers
Harris, ASSU president, is a vocal
critic of Stanford's educational sys
tem. Sanford is professor of psychol
ogy and education and director of the
Institute for the Study of Human Prob
lems. He directed the pioneering Vas
sar Studies of higher education and
was editor of The American College,
on the psychological and social fac
tors in higher learning.
Coffin is chaplain of Yale Univer
sity. He has been active in freedom

rides in the South, the Crossroads
Africa project, and in the training
of Peace Corps volunteers.
No Sign-Ups
Another major change in format
eliminates the sign-ups. It will not be
necessary to join a group with a fac
ulty member as in the past. Instead,
a reception in the Tresidder Large
Lounge will follow the speeches. All
students and the 250 faculty couples
who have been invited are welcome.
"Don't wait to sign up," emphasized
Nick Davis, Symposium Committee
chairman. "We have tried to make it
easier for more people to attend. A
number of dinner groups who have
met before will meet, but these are
already organized from last quar
ter's symposium."
Change For Future
The program will deal with the
ways higher education must change
to meet the problems which it will
face in the future. It will analyze pres
ent methods in the light of mass edu
cation, and seek better ways for uni
versities to prepare individuals for
today's society.
In addition to addressing the sym
posium group. Coffin,will be guest
preacher at Memorial Church Sunday
at 11 a.m. He will eat dinner at Stern
Hall.

David Harris, Nevitt Sanford, and
William Sloane Coffin, Jr. will probe
the question "Can Our Education Meet
the Challenge?" in the second "Year of
Change" symposium. They will be
the principal speakers Sunday at 7:15
p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditorium in the
followup to November's symposium
on "The Challenge."
Sponsored by the Symposium Com
mittee of the Student-Faculty Board,
Sunday's program will differ in format
from symposiums in previous years.
One of the changes is the presenta
tion of three principle speakers rather
than several students and one guest
speaker.
Speakers
Harris, ASSU president, is a vocal
critic of Stanford's educational sys
tem. Sanford is professor of psychol
ogy and education and director of the
Institute for the Study of Human Prob
lems. He directed the pioneering Vas
sar Studies of higher education and
was editor of The American College,
on the psychological and social fac
tors in higher learning.
Coffin is chaplain of Yale Univer
sity. He has been active in freedom

rides in the South, the Crossroads
Africa project, and in the training
of Peace Corps volunteers.
No Sign-Ups
Another major change in format
eliminates the sign-ups. It will not be
necessary to join a group with a fac
ulty member as in the past. Instead,
a reception in the Tresidder Large
Lounge will follow the speeches. All
students and the 250 faculty couples
who have been invited are welcome.
"Don't wait to sign up," emphasized
Nick Davis, Symposium Committee
chairman. "We have tried to make it
easier for more people to attend. A
number of dinner groups who have
met before will meet, but these are
already organized from last quar
ter's symposium."
Change For Future
The program will deal with the
ways higher education must change
to meet the problems which it will
face in the future. It will analyze pres
ent methods in the light of mass edu
cation, and seek better ways for uni
versities to prepare individuals for
today's society.
In addition to addressing the sym
posium group. Coffin,will be guest
preacher at Memorial Church Sunday
at 11 a.m. He will eat dinner at Stern
Hall.
