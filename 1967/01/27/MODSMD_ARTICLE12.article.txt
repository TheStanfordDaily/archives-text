# ‘Free' Universities Discover Education Process Is Not

- The two-year-old Free Univer
sity of Pennsylvania has more
than 400 students, a widely-rang
ing curriculum, and faculty and
administration support, but
some of its organizers consider
it a failure.
"The Free University is in
trouble," three members of the
student-organized school's coor
dinating committee said last
month. "The majority of the
courses are ill attended, the crea
tive thought is at a minimum in
many courses, the minimal office
work has not been done, and
that which has been done has
been done by a very few people."
Although this analysis is dis
puted by other University of
Pennsylvania students as "over
ly pessimistic," it points up prob
lems shared by a number of
free universities across the coun
try. Founded in protest against
bureaucratic stifling of learning
in formal education, the "anti
universities" are beginning to
meet the difficulties which col
lege administrators face con
tinually—lack of organization, of
funds, and of student interest.
Complete Freedom
In their reaction against the
formal procedures used by col
leges to handle almost all activi
ties, the free universities allow
their members complete free
dom. Anyone can organize and
lead a course, and anyone can
attend —usually at no cost—and
no fear of grades.
The bureaucracy is given little
power: it registers students, ar
ranges classroom space, and
handles the necessary paper
work. When policy decisions
have to be made, everyone can
participate.
Yet, despite their success in in
volving students in education,
free universities are beginning to
face the consequences of their
extreme anti-bureaucratic as
sumptions: administrative work
is not being done and continuity
of operations is in danger.
The nationally-publicized Ex
perimental College at San Fran
cisco State College admitted re
cently that it is broke and the
outlook for additional funds is
bleak. The organizers of the EC,
which has an enrollment of
about 600 students and offers
regular college credit for some
courses, failed to write proposals
for foundation and U.S. Office of
Education funds, which it ex
pected as sources of support.
Experimental College
The EC began its operation
last fall with an initial $15,000 al
location from the student gov
ernment, which would have been
repaid upon receipt of outside
assistance. But to receive any
grants the college would have
had to submit a written prospec
tus. And for activists more ac
customed to organizing and
agitating, the difficulties of wilt
ing a formal proposal seem to
have been insurmountable.
So, with little money in sight
for the immediate future, EC of
ficials are beginning to take
stock of their operation.
"We are going to be tighter
about salaries next semester,"
EC Director Cynthia Nixon said,
"partly because of lack of
money and partly because work
has not been up to par."
"The structure of the EC will
change slightly to a more cen
tralized operation," she added.
No Leadership
Continuity has been another
major problem for free univer
sities. The one-year-old Free Uni
versity experiment at the Uni
versity of Michigan was discon
tinued this fall because "there
was no one to lead it," according
to Richard Cook, a graduate stu
dent in philosophy, who taught a
course at the Free U. last year.

"We had a debate when we
were starting the Free Univer
sity between the anarchists who
wanted no organization and
some of us who said some or
ganization was necessary. Those
in favor of organization won,
but no one did the work," Cook
added.
Similarly, Uninc. U., initiated
at the University of Colorado in
1965, lapsed last fall because no
plans had been made to continue
its operations and its organizers
had become involved in other ac
tivities. Now the project is being
revived with the formation of an
Uninc. U. Commission; and
courses are being offered for
second semester.
"I am very much in favor of
the intent of this project," said
Professor Walter Weir, "but I
don't think it can be lasting
and successful unless it is in
corporated into the University."
Requirement Rejected
Yet, formal connections with
the University can bring their
own problems, as the organizers
of the EC have learned. Besides
the paradox of offering courses
for credit in a system which it
rejects, the EC has to meet for
mal departmental requirements
for acceptance of its courses.
"During spring, credit was
given in special study courses in
the EC," according to Don Jones,
a lecturer in Psychology at San
Francisco State. "They clamped
down this fall."
"It might take as long to
break up the evaluation network
(grades, etc.) as it did to break
up the plantation system," he
said.
Call For Secession
But most free university plan
ners are uninterested in joining
the formal education system.
Following philosopher Paul
Goodman's original call for "se
cession" from the universities,
their organizers seek to estab
lish counter-institutions which
will be far more attractive to
to students that traditional col
leges.
"We will show the University
what kind of education we want

by going ahead," says Nell
Reichline, a founder of UCLA's
Experimental College. "In that
sense, the Experimental College
will be a model for education
that the administration will be
able to refer to in determining
curriculum changes."
"The time will eventually come
when the University will start
looking around for better ways
of providing education. We will
have them."
As for course credits, Reich
line says his "philosophy is to
tally against that. If it really
works, then there won't be any
need for credit."
The critics have a point. The
free university movement was
given a bad name last year when
the Free University of New York
(FUNY) refused to allow the
Hudson Institute's weapons
strategist Herman Kahn to teach
a course.
"Kahn can easily get a job
teaching," FUNY Director Allen
Krebs said. "We're in business
to give others, who aren't allow
ed to teach anywhere, a chance."
Decidedly Marxist
But FUNY, which has a de
cidedly Marxist orientation, is
atypical. Although many free
school have been initiated by
such leftist groups as Students
for a Democratic Society, most
try to appeal to a wide range
of students.
SDS dropped its sponsorship
of the Free University of Penn
sylvania, for example, to allow
a more representative Coordinat
ing Committee to plan the opera
tions. Student governments are
also getting into the act, spon
soring free universities at De-
Pauw University and Boston Uni
versity, among others.
Despite these problems, stu
dents continue to be excited by
their educational . experiments,
and free universities are pro
liferating across the country.
More than 30 free schools, in
volving over 3,000 students, have
been started this year at col
leges ranging from the Univer
sity of Oregon to Northern Illi
nois University to Princeton Uni
versity.

had to submit a written prospec
tus. And for activists more ac
customed to organizing and
agitating, the difficulties of wilt
ing a formal proposal seem to
have been insurmountable.
So, with little money in sight
for the immediate future, EC of
ficials are beginning to take
stock of their operation.
"We are going to be tighter
about salaries next semester,"
EC Director Cynthia Nixon said,
"partly because of lack of
money and partly because work
has not been up to par."
"The structure of the EC will
change slightly to a more cen
tralized operation," she added.
No Leadership
Continuity has been another
major problem for free univer
sities. The one-year-old Free Uni
versity experiment at the Uni
versity of Michigan was discon
tinued this fall because "there
was no one to lead it," according
to Richard Cook, a graduate stu
dent in philosophy, who taught a
course at the Free U. last year.

"We had a debate when we
were starting the Free Univer
sity between the anarchists who
wanted no organization and
some of us who said some or
ganization was necessary. Those
in favor of organization won,
but no one did the work," Cook
added.
Similarly, Uninc. U., initiated
at the University of Colorado in
1965, lapsed last fall because no
plans had been made to continue
its operations and its organizers
had become involved in other ac
tivities. Now the project is being
revived with the formation of an
Uninc. U. Commission; and
courses are being offered for
second semester.
"I am very much in favor of
the intent of this project," said
Professor Walter Weir, "but I
don't think it can be lasting
and successful unless it is in
corporated into the University."
Requirement Rejected
Yet, formal connections with
the University can bring their
own problems, as the organizers
of the EC have learned. Besides
the paradox of offering courses
for credit in a system which it
rejects, the EC has to meet for
mal departmental requirements
for acceptance of its courses.
"During spring, credit was
given in special study courses in
the EC," according to Don Jones,
a lecturer in Psychology at San
Francisco State. "They clamped
down this fall."
"It might take as long to
break up the evaluation network
(grades, etc.) as it did to break
up the plantation system," he
said.
Call For Secession
But most free university plan
ners are uninterested in joining
the formal education system.
Following philosopher Paul
Goodman's original call for "se
cession" from the universities,
their organizers seek to estab
lish counter-institutions which
will be far more attractive to
to students that traditional col
leges.
"We will show the University
what kind of education we want

by going ahead," says Nell
Reichline, a founder of UCLA's
Experimental College. "In that
sense, the Experimental College
will be a model for education
that the administration will be
able to refer to in determining
curriculum changes."
"The time will eventually come
when the University will start
looking around for better ways
of providing education. We will
have them."
As for course credits, Reich
line says his "philosophy is to
tally against that. If it really
works, then there won't be any
need for credit."
The critics have a point. The
free university movement was
given a bad name last year when
the Free University of New York
(FUNY) refused to allow the
Hudson Institute's weapons
strategist Herman Kahn to teach
a course.
"Kahn can easily get a job
teaching," FUNY Director Allen
Krebs said. "We're in business
to give others, who aren't allow
ed to teach anywhere, a chance."
Decidedly Marxist
But FUNY, which has a de
cidedly Marxist orientation, is
atypical. Although many free
school have been initiated by
such leftist groups as Students
for a Democratic Society, most
try to appeal to a wide range
of students.
SDS dropped its sponsorship
of the Free University of Penn
sylvania, for example, to allow
a more representative Coordinat
ing Committee to plan the opera
tions. Student governments are
also getting into the act, spon
soring free universities at De-
Pauw University and Boston Uni
versity, among others.
Despite these problems, stu
dents continue to be excited by
their educational . experiments,
and free universities are pro
liferating across the country.
More than 30 free schools, in
volving over 3,000 students, have
been started this year at col
leges ranging from the Univer
sity of Oregon to Northern Illi
nois University to Princeton Uni
versity.

WASHINGTON, D.C. (CPS)
- The two-year-old Free Univer
sity of Pennsylvania has more
than 400 students, a widely-rang
ing curriculum, and faculty and
administration support, but
some of its organizers consider
it a failure.
"The Free University is in
trouble," three members of the
student-organized school's coor
dinating committee said last
month. "The majority of the
courses are ill attended, the crea
tive thought is at a minimum in
many courses, the minimal office
work has not been done, and
that which has been done has
been done by a very few people."
Although this analysis is dis
puted by other University of
Pennsylvania students as "over
ly pessimistic," it points up prob
lems shared by a number of
free universities across the coun
try. Founded in protest against
bureaucratic stifling of learning
in formal education, the "anti
universities" are beginning to
meet the difficulties which col
lege administrators face con
tinually—lack of organization, of
funds, and of student interest.
Complete Freedom
In their reaction against the
formal procedures used by col
leges to handle almost all activi
ties, the free universities allow
their members complete free
dom. Anyone can organize and
lead a course, and anyone can
attend —usually at no cost—and
no fear of grades.
The bureaucracy is given little
power: it registers students, ar
ranges classroom space, and
handles the necessary paper
work. When policy decisions
have to be made, everyone can
participate.
Yet, despite their success in in
volving students in education,
free universities are beginning to
face the consequences of their
extreme anti-bureaucratic as
sumptions: administrative work
is not being done and continuity
of operations is in danger.
The nationally-publicized Ex
perimental College at San Fran
cisco State College admitted re
cently that it is broke and the
outlook for additional funds is
bleak. The organizers of the EC,
which has an enrollment of
about 600 students and offers
regular college credit for some
courses, failed to write proposals
for foundation and U.S. Office of
Education funds, which it ex
pected as sources of support.
Experimental College
The EC began its operation
last fall with an initial $15,000 al
location from the student gov
ernment, which would have been
repaid upon receipt of outside
assistance. But to receive any
grants the college would have
had to submit a written prospec
tus. And for activists more ac

the formal education system.
Following philosopher Paul
Goodman's original call for "se
cession" from the universities,
their organizers seek to estab
lish counter-institutions which
will be far more attractive to
to students that traditional col
leges.
"We will show the University
what kind of education we want

by going ahead," says Nell
Reichline, a founder of UCLA's
Experimental College. "In that
sense, the Experimental College
will be a model for education
that the administration will be
able to refer to in determining
curriculum changes."
"The time will eventually come
when the University will start
looking around for better ways
of providing education. We will
have them."
As for course credits, Reich
line says his "philosophy is to
tally against that. If it really
works, then there won't be any
need for credit."
The critics have a point. The
free university movement was
given a bad name last year when
the Free University of New York
(FUNY) refused to allow the
Hudson Institute's weapons
strategist Herman Kahn to teach
a course.
"Kahn can easily get a job
teaching," FUNY Director Allen
Krebs said. "We're in business
to give others, who aren't allow
ed to teach anywhere, a chance."
Decidedly Marxist
But FUNY, which has a de
cidedly Marxist orientation, is
atypical. Although many free
school have been initiated by
such leftist groups as Students
for a Democratic Society, most
try to appeal to a wide range
of students.
SDS dropped its sponsorship
of the Free University of Penn
sylvania, for example, to allow
a more representative Coordinat
ing Committee to plan the opera
tions. Student governments are
also getting into the act, spon
soring free universities at De-
Pauw University and Boston Uni
versity, among others.
Despite these problems, stu
dents continue to be excited by
their educational . experiments,
and free universities are pro
liferating across the country.
More than 30 free schools, in
volving over 3,000 students, have
been started this year at col
leges ranging from the Univer

WASHINGTON, D.C. (CPS)
- The two-year-old Free Univer
sity of Pennsylvania has more
than 400 students, a widely-rang
ing curriculum, and faculty and
administration support, but
some of its organizers consider
it a failure.
"The Free University is in
trouble," three members of the
student-organized school's coor
dinating committee said last
month. "The majority of the
courses are ill attended, the crea
tive thought is at a minimum in
many courses, the minimal office
work has not been done, and
that which has been done has
been done by a very few people."
Although this analysis is dis
puted by other University of
Pennsylvania students as "over
ly pessimistic," it points up prob
lems shared by a number of
free universities across the coun
try. Founded in protest against
bureaucratic stifling of learning
in formal education, the "anti
universities" are beginning to
meet the difficulties which col
lege administrators face con
tinually—lack of organization, of
funds, and of student interest.
Complete Freedom
In their reaction against the
formal procedures used by col
leges to handle almost all activi
ties, the free universities allow
their members complete free
dom. Anyone can organize and
lead a course, and anyone can
attend —usually at no cost—and
no fear of grades.
The bureaucracy is given little
power: it registers students, ar
ranges classroom space, and
handles the necessary paper
work. When policy decisions
have to be made, everyone can
participate.
Yet, despite their success in in
volving students in education,
free universities are beginning to
face the consequences of their
extreme anti-bureaucratic as
sumptions: administrative work
is not being done and continuity
of operations is in danger.
The nationally-publicized Ex
perimental College at San Fran
cisco State College admitted re
cently that it is broke and the
outlook for additional funds is
bleak. The organizers of the EC,
which has an enrollment of
about 600 students and offers
regular college credit for some
courses, failed to write proposals
for foundation and U.S. Office of
Education funds, which it ex
pected as sources of support.
Experimental College
The EC began its operation
last fall with an initial $15,000 al
location from the student gov
ernment, which would have been
repaid upon receipt of outside
assistance. But to receive any
grants the college would have
had to submit a written prospec
tus. And for activists more ac
customed to organizing and
agitating, the difficulties of wilt
ing a formal proposal seem to
have been insurmountable.
So, with little money in sight
for the immediate future, EC of
ficials are beginning to take
stock of their operation.
"We are going to be tighter
about salaries next semester,"
EC Director Cynthia Nixon said,
"partly because of lack of
money and partly because work
has not been up to par."
"The structure of the EC will
change slightly to a more cen
tralized operation," she added.
No Leadership
Continuity has been another
major problem for free univer
sities. The one-year-old Free Uni
versity experiment at the Uni
versity of Michigan was discon
tinued this fall because "there
was no one to lead it," according
to Richard Cook, a graduate stu
dent in philosophy, who taught a
course at the Free U. last year.

"We had a debate when we
were starting the Free Univer
sity between the anarchists who
wanted no organization and
some of us who said some or
ganization was necessary. Those
in favor of organization won,
but no one did the work," Cook
added.
Similarly, Uninc. U., initiated
at the University of Colorado in
1965, lapsed last fall because no
plans had been made to continue
its operations and its organizers
had become involved in other ac
tivities. Now the project is being
revived with the formation of an
Uninc. U. Commission; and
courses are being offered for
second semester.
"I am very much in favor of
the intent of this project," said
Professor Walter Weir, "but I
don't think it can be lasting
and successful unless it is in
corporated into the University."
Requirement Rejected
Yet, formal connections with
the University can bring their
own problems, as the organizers
of the EC have learned. Besides
the paradox of offering courses
for credit in a system which it
rejects, the EC has to meet for
mal departmental requirements
for acceptance of its courses.
"During spring, credit was
given in special study courses in
the EC," according to Don Jones,
a lecturer in Psychology at San
Francisco State. "They clamped
down this fall."
"It might take as long to
break up the evaluation network
(grades, etc.) as it did to break
up the plantation system," he
said.

it a failure.
"The Free University is in
trouble," three members of the
student-organized school's coor
dinating committee said last
month. "The majority of the
courses are ill attended, the crea
tive thought is at a minimum in
many courses, the minimal office
work has not been done, and
that which has been done has
been done by a very few people."
Although this analysis is dis
puted by other University of
Pennsylvania students as "over
ly pessimistic," it points up prob
lems shared by a number of
free universities across the coun
try. Founded in protest against
bureaucratic stifling of learning
in formal education, the "anti
universities" are beginning to
meet the difficulties which col
lege administrators face con
tinually—lack of organization, of
funds, and of student interest.
Complete Freedom
In their reaction against the
formal procedures used by col
leges to handle almost all activi
ties, the free universities allow
their members complete free
dom. Anyone can organize and
lead a course, and anyone can
attend —usually at no cost—and
no fear of grades.
The bureaucracy is given little
power: it registers students, ar
ranges classroom space, and
handles the necessary paper
work. When policy decisions
have to be made, everyone can
participate.
Yet, despite their success in in
volving students in education,
free universities are beginning to
face the consequences of their
extreme anti-bureaucratic as
sumptions: administrative work
is not being done and continuity
of operations is in danger.
The nationally-publicized Ex
perimental College at San Fran
cisco State College admitted re
cently that it is broke and the
outlook for additional funds is
bleak. The organizers of the EC,
which has an enrollment of
about 600 students and offers
regular college credit for some
courses, failed to write proposals
for foundation and U.S. Office of
Education funds, which it ex
pected as sources of support.
Experimental College
The EC began its operation
last fall with an initial $15,000 al
location from the student gov
ernment, which would have been
repaid upon receipt of outside
assistance. But to receive any
grants the college would have
had to submit a written prospec
tus. And for activists more ac
customed to organizing and
agitating, the difficulties of wilt
ing a formal proposal seem to
have been insurmountable.
So, with little money in sight
for the immediate future, EC of
ficials are beginning to take
stock of their operation.
"We are going to be tighter
about salaries next semester,"
EC Director Cynthia Nixon said,
"partly because of lack of
money and partly because work
has not been up to par."
"The structure of the EC will
change slightly to a more cen
tralized operation," she added.
No Leadership
Continuity has been another
major problem for free univer
sities. The one-year-old Free Uni
versity experiment at the Uni
versity of Michigan was discon
tinued this fall because "there
was no one to lead it," according
to Richard Cook, a graduate stu
dent in philosophy, who taught a
course at the Free U. last year.

"We had a debate when we
were starting the Free Univer
sity between the anarchists who
wanted no organization and
some of us who said some or
ganization was necessary. Those
in favor of organization won,
but no one did the work," Cook
added.
Similarly, Uninc. U., initiated
at the University of Colorado in
1965, lapsed last fall because no
plans had been made to continue
its operations and its organizers
had become involved in other ac
tivities. Now the project is being
revived with the formation of an
Uninc. U. Commission; and
courses are being offered for
second semester.
"I am very much in favor of
the intent of this project," said
Professor Walter Weir, "but I
don't think it can be lasting
and successful unless it is in
corporated into the University."
Requirement Rejected
Yet, formal connections with
the University can bring their
own problems, as the organizers
of the EC have learned. Besides
the paradox of offering courses
for credit in a system which it
rejects, the EC has to meet for
mal departmental requirements
for acceptance of its courses.
"During spring, credit was
given in special study courses in
the EC," according to Don Jones,
a lecturer in Psychology at San
Francisco State. "They clamped
down this fall."
"It might take as long to
break up the evaluation network
(grades, etc.) as it did to break
up the plantation system," he
said.
Call For Secession
But most free university plan
ners are uninterested in joining
the formal education system.
Following philosopher Paul
Goodman's original call for "se
cession" from the universities,
their organizers seek to estab
lish counter-institutions which
will be far more attractive to
to students that traditional col
leges.
"We will show the University
what kind of education we want

by going ahead," says Nell
Reichline, a founder of UCLA's
Experimental College. "In that
sense, the Experimental College
will be a model for education
that the administration will be
able to refer to in determining
curriculum changes."
"The time will eventually come
when the University will start
looking around for better ways
of providing education. We will
have them."
As for course credits, Reich
line says his "philosophy is to
tally against that. If it really
works, then there won't be any
need for credit."
The critics have a point. The
free university movement was
given a bad name last year when
the Free University of New York
(FUNY) refused to allow the
Hudson Institute's weapons
strategist Herman Kahn to teach
a course.
"Kahn can easily get a job
teaching," FUNY Director Allen
Krebs said. "We're in business
to give others, who aren't allow
ed to teach anywhere, a chance."
Decidedly Marxist
But FUNY, which has a de
cidedly Marxist orientation, is
atypical. Although many free
school have been initiated by
such leftist groups as Students
for a Democratic Society, most
try to appeal to a wide range
of students.
SDS dropped its sponsorship
of the Free University of Penn
sylvania, for example, to allow
a more representative Coordinat
ing Committee to plan the opera
tions. Student governments are
also getting into the act, spon
soring free universities at De-
Pauw University and Boston Uni
versity, among others.
Despite these problems, stu
dents continue to be excited by
their educational . experiments,
and free universities are pro
liferating across the country.
More than 30 free schools, in
volving over 3,000 students, have
been started this year at col
leges ranging from the Univer
sity of Oregon to Northern Illi
nois University to Princeton Uni
versity.
