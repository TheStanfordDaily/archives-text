# SCU Students Seek Senate Formation
## 
### MARSHALL COOK DOROTHY MALLOY 
Students and teachers of Santa
Clara University, a Catholic col
lege not known for its student
activism, met Wednesday night
to state their grievances and lis
ten to the proposal of a student
faculty Senate.
The proposed Senate would, ac
cording to student body president
Hal Mack, "bring the workings of
the University out into the open"
while offering students and fac
ulty a chance to recommend pol
icy on everything from admis
sions and the budget, to cur
riculum.
Approximately half of Santa
Clara's 3,000 students listened
as vice president Rich Murphy
described the endeavor between
the young student and the ex
perienced student (teacher), ask
ing "Should the administration
tell me what that endeavor is to
be?" Rather, he asserted, they
ought to "allow me to learn . . .
as well as possible."
Some of the faculty opposed
the idea in a question and an
swer session following Murphy's
speech. One asked why, if the
faculty were to be included in
the Senate, no faculty member
spoke at the meeting. In re
sponse, Roger Gross, a drama
professor, termed the proposal
"a nice revolution." He described
the mood of crisis among "a
couple of thousand students

afraid they're about to waste
four years of their lives."
The meeting was no accident.
It began as "the movement"
ten days ago when many of
Santa Clara's prominent stu
dents thrashed over student
problems in an all-night session.
The group, which included Mack,
Jim McCarthy, and John Otto
boni, commandeered an unused
room in a dormitory basement
for their headquarters. Veterans
of student politics, they soon
formed an organization which
circulated a statement of twelve
grievances titled "If we don't
. . . who will??"
A written statement of the
Senate proposal followed on
Tuesday, and later an announce
ment of the Wednesday night
meeting. Each student was con
tacted by his dorm chairman, and
each of 123 faculty members
was asked his opinion of the
proposal.
Action culminated yesterday
morning when Mack presented
the proposal to Father President
Donohoe, who for the students is
the single known representative
of the unknown administration.
Now students must await the
response they feel they deserve
and must have. If the Senate
is allowed, student government
at Santa Clara may no longer
be what The Snail, "junior class
irregular," describes as "an ob
ject without the confidence of its
consensus to remedy its faults."
