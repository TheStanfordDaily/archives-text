# ‘Les Girls' Have Party At Lassen
## 
### STEVE GRUBER Foreign Affairs Editor 
"Who was that lady I saw you
with last night?"
If you had asked that question
yesterday at Lassen House in
Stern Hall you might have
received this answer—"That was
no lady, that was a dancer from
"Vive Les Girls.'"
Twenty members of the cast,
now playing at the Circle Star
Theater in San Carlos, dropped
in Wednesday night to have a
party with the residents of Las
sen.
"They were really nice girls,"
reported Michael Weinstein of
Lassen. The girls danced with
nearly everyone and even asked
some of the more bashful men
to dance, he said.
The girls were invited to the
party, an official house function,
by Scott Mac Donald who works
at the Circle Star Theater as an
usher. The party started at mid
night, after Wednesday night's
show was over. It was held in
the Lassen lounge.
The average age of the girls
was about 25, according to Wein
stein, and most of them were not
French citizens.
Nearly all of the Lassen men
showed up at the party, he said.
"Vive Les Girls" is now in its
final week at the Circle Star. The
dancers have been invited to
many parties while the show has
been in the Bay Area, Weinstein
commented, but they rated the
Lassen party as one of the bet
ter functions.
Weinstein also said that the
girls "were good dancers" and
seemed to enjoy themselves.
