### CURTISS B. KECK Entertainment Editor 
THEATER
This week the San Francisco
and surrounding area critics
acknowledged the American Con
servatory Theater's eminence in
the world of repetory with a
flood of rave reviews of ACT's
TARTUFFE and TINY ALICE.
At 8:30 tonight and tomorrow
evening at the Geary Theater in
S.F., ACT preforms DEAR LIAR
and follows Sunday night with
"Tartuffe." They are plays well
worth seeing and, if at all pos
sible, a must on the weekend's
agenda.
The Stanford Repertory Thea
ter continues into its second
week of BEGGAR'S OPERA,
John Gay's 18th century musical
satire of the London condition.
Curtain at 8:30 tonight and to
morrow night. Tickets available,
I'm sure, at Mem Aud box of
fice.
THE PHYSICISTS, Friedrich
Durrenmatt's marvelous tragi
comic attack on atomic warfare,
continues at the Playhouse, S.F.
THE IMPORTANCE OF BE
ING EARNEST, Oscar Wilde's
wonderful satire of Victorian
manners and morals, in a sickly
and entirely inappropriate pro
duction at the Oakland Audi
torium Theater, is a night at the
theater you can do well without.
MOVIES
Tonight, Tresidder presents
the subtitled Japanese film,

IKIRU (To Live!). The story of
a search for meaning of life by
a man who knows he has only
a short time to live, "Ikiru" was
selected by the New York Times
as one of The 10 Best Films Of
1960.
THE GUNS OF NAVARONE
blazes across the Tresidder
screen tomorrow night. Sporting
lots of sex and gore, and star
ring Anthony Quinn, Gregory
Peck, and David Niven, "Nava
rone" relates the story of a
sabotage mission by the Allied
commandos against the impreg
nible German-held guns of the
Navarone.
At the Park, ALFEE is a man
and a move after my own tastes
(until his bloomin', bleeding'
epiphany in the end). A MAN
AND A WOMAN at the Guild
shouldn't be missed. MORGAN
and BLACK ORPHEUS are both
worth an excursion to the Paris.
If you're interested and the
movies are in the area, MUR
DER'S ROW, starring Dean
Martin, and ABARESQUE, with
Gregory Peck and Sophia Loren,
are without a doubt two of the
worst movies any producer ever
has had the mental debilities to
spend money filming. James Co
burn in DEAD HEAT ON A
MERRY GO ROUND and Mi
chael Caine in GAMBIT are their
phenomental selves while the
overall movies leave much to be
desired. *

MOVIES
Tonight, Tresidder presents
the subtitled Japanese film,

IKIRU (To Live!). The story of
a search for meaning of life by
a man who knows he has only
a short time to live, "Ikiru" was
selected by the New York Times
as one of The 10 Best Films Of
1960.
THE GUNS OF NAVARONE
blazes across the Tresidder
screen tomorrow night. Sporting
lots of sex and gore, and star
ring Anthony Quinn, Gregory
Peck, and David Niven, "Nava
rone" relates the story of a
sabotage mission by the Allied
commandos against the impreg
nible German-held guns of the
Navarone.
At the Park, ALFEE is a man
and a move after my own tastes
(until his bloomin', bleeding'
epiphany in the end). A MAN
AND A WOMAN at the Guild
shouldn't be missed. MORGAN
and BLACK ORPHEUS are both
worth an excursion to the Paris.
If you're interested and the
movies are in the area, MUR
DER'S ROW, starring Dean
Martin, and ABARESQUE, with
Gregory Peck and Sophia Loren,
are without a doubt two of the
worst movies any producer ever
has had the mental debilities to
spend money filming. James Co
burn in DEAD HEAT ON A
MERRY GO ROUND and Mi
chael Caine in GAMBIT are their
phenomental selves while the
overall movies leave much to be
desired. *
THEATER
This week the San Francisco
and surrounding area critics
acknowledged the American Con
servatory Theater's eminence in

flood of rave reviews of ACT's
TARTUFFE and TINY ALICE.
At 8:30 tonight and tomorrow
evening at the Geary Theater in

agenda.
The Stanford Repertory Thea
ter continues into its second
week of BEGGAR'S OPERA,
John Gay's 18th century musical
satire of the London condition.

morrow night. Tickets available,
I'm sure, at Mem Aud box of
fice.
THE PHYSICISTS, Friedrich
Durrenmatt's marvelous tragi
comic attack on atomic warfare,
continues at the Playhouse, S.F.
THE IMPORTANCE OF BE
ING EARNEST, Oscar Wilde's
wonderful satire of Victorian
manners and morals, in a sickly
and entirely inappropriate pro
duction at the Oakland Audi
torium Theater, is a night at the
theater you can do well without.
