# 'Man And Woman,' A Success
## 
### LARRY BIEHIL 
"A Man and a Woman"—a
simple title for two unusual
characters. The Man sees his
world from the cramped, cockpit
of a competion racing ca ir, where
life is measured in rri'iles per
hour. "At 141, you go {spinning
off the track; at 139, ;j/ou lose
the race." Life is precision.
The Woman confronts her
world from the foot of a movie
crane, where life is n leasured
by her capacity to produce a
marketable form. As a n iovie edi
tor, she chooses the words, di
rects the scenes and se' ects the
results of what her cannera and
microphone have recorded.
Again, the life of precision.
The Man is a widower. His
wife had a nervous breakdown
after his near fatal creick-up at
Le Mans, and killed herself. The
Woman is a widow. Her • huband,
a stuntman, died in an attempt
to enact a difficult char ge scene
across a mine-ridden 1 ield.
Man And Woman fl leet
The Man, a father, and the
Woman, a mother, meet through
their children who at tend the
same school.
"If you were in a fire and had
the chance to save a Rembrandt
or a cat, which woi ild you
save?"
"The cat . . . and then I'd let
him go."
Both choose life, pres< >nt-tense.
They have left behind i :he Rem
brandt, for even a glor ous past
carries with it regret, disappoint
ment and death. When they fall
in love, they feel their essence

asserted—a man and a woman.
The photographic play between
color and black and white,
though noticeable, was not dis
tracting, but vividly compli
mented emotional responses.
Night time was always filmed in
black and white, day time, in
color. Moments of warmth and
tenderness were filmed through
a brownish filter, creating a most
appropriate mellowing effect.
Black and white was again used
in moments of dejection and
uncertainty. The technique was
highly successful.
Because the film is French
and we must therefore read sub
titles (which, though brevity of
speech, were saved from becom
ing tedious), the switching of
the dialogue from Man to Wom
an to occasional radio broadcast
er would elicit more of a re

sponse in a viewer who under
stands French. And yet, even
though we are confronted with
subtitles, the technique achieves
appreciable results.
But the best I have saved for
last: the brilliance of the mu
sical score. At times it is sooth
ing, at times it is haunting; but
at all times, it is loving. We aro
convinced at the film's end that
Love is not just a Man and a
Woman, but a melody.
An Unpolluted Ending
Unlike so many love stories,
"A Man and a Woman" does not
pollute itself with a happy-ever
after ending. The Man and the
Woman find happiness through
their love, but this happiness is
not a resolution, a conclusion
or an ending; it is a demand,
existing in the present, which
the future challenges.
