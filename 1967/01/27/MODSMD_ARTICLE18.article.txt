# Old Cassanova Cary Grant Pimps In 'Walk, Don't Run'
## 
### ANDREW B. WILSON 
There comes the time when
even the ageless must make
way for youth, and so it is in
"Walk, Don't Run," when the
movies' most durable Cassa
nova, Cary Grant, is content to
clear the field for the armorous
pursuits of his young protege.
Now in the silver-haired twi
light of his career, the debo
naire Mr. Grant has lost none
of his skill and aplomb. As
always it is a pleasure to watch
his adroit maneuverings in and
out of ticklish situations. Often
befuddled, he is never ruffled.
It is Grant's impeccable per
formance which lifts "Walk,
Don't Run," an otherwise thinly
conceived, artlessly contrived
situation comedy, into the realm
of possible entertainment.
Grant plays an eccentric mil
lionaire, Sir William Rutland,
who, arriving in Tokyo shortly
before the Olympics and finding
no hotel openings, answers an
ad for sharing an apartment
room.
It could happen only in the
movies, for who appears at the
apartment door but a gorgeous
young woman (Samantha Eg
gar). It readily becomes appar
ent, however, that the dream
girl has a plain-jane personal
ity and could never have con
ceived of sharing her apartment
with a man, let alone a strange
man.
"I mean," she says, struggling
for the right and final words,
"I would prefer sharing my
apartment with a woman."
"Well, so would I," replies Sir
William triumphantly, there

upon marching in to conclude
the arrangements.
Won over but wary, the girl—
Christie—lays down a firm set
of regulations as regards equal
but separate facilities. Her prim,
punctilious demeanor forbids
whatever hopes the gay Sir Wil
liam might hage of promiscuous
cohabitation.
From Chris's point of view,
the potentially complicated ar
rangement becomes a live bomb
the following day when she re
turns home to find that Sir Wil
liam has taken in a third ledger,
a handsome Olympic contestant
(Jim Hutton). Once again, how
ever, Sir William's persuasive
ness prevails over her protesta
tions.
The seeming triangle assumes
a fourth angle when the two
men discover their beautiful
roommate is already engaged,
and to a prissy stuffed shirt they
soon have the misfortune to
meet. Alas, because she wants
security, it seems that Chris'
fetching endowments are destin
ed for the marital drain.
To cut a dull story short, Sir
William runs interference while
Chris, free of her fiance's atten
tion, falls helplessly in love with
her other roommate. A scandal
develops when the papers grab
hold of the unusual living ar
rangement, her fiance deserts
her in the crisis, and when the
mess blows over she and her
true lover are rushed to the
altar.
While the helter-skelter con
clusion misfired and the movie
failed to bring together taste
fully its love story and its comic
aspects, "Walk, Don't Run"
nonetheless provides a 50-50
evening of light entertainment.

young woman (Samantha Eg
gar). It readily becomes appar
ent, however, that the dream
girl has a plain-jane personal
ity and could never have con
ceived of sharing her apartment
with a man, let alone a strange
man.
"I mean," she says, struggling
for the right and final words,
"I would prefer sharing my
apartment with a woman."
"Well, so would I," replies Sir
William triumphantly, there

upon marching in to conclude
the arrangements.
Won over but wary, the girl—
Christie—lays down a firm set
of regulations as regards equal
but separate facilities. Her prim,
punctilious demeanor forbids
whatever hopes the gay Sir Wil
liam might hage of promiscuous
cohabitation.
From Chris's point of view,
the potentially complicated ar
rangement becomes a live bomb
the following day when she re
turns home to find that Sir Wil
liam has taken in a third ledger,
a handsome Olympic contestant
(Jim Hutton). Once again, how
ever, Sir William's persuasive
ness prevails over her protesta
tions.
The seeming triangle assumes
a fourth angle when the two
men discover their beautiful
roommate is already engaged,
and to a prissy stuffed shirt they
soon have the misfortune to
meet. Alas, because she wants
security, it seems that Chris'
fetching endowments are destin
ed for the marital drain.
To cut a dull story short, Sir
William runs interference while
Chris, free of her fiance's atten
tion, falls helplessly in love with
her other roommate. A scandal
develops when the papers grab
hold of the unusual living ar
rangement, her fiance deserts
her in the crisis, and when the
mess blows over she and her
true lover are rushed to the
altar.
While the helter-skelter con
clusion misfired and the movie
failed to bring together taste
fully its love story and its comic
aspects, "Walk, Don't Run"
nonetheless provides a 50-50
evening of light entertainment.
There comes the time when
even the ageless must make
way for youth, and so it is in
"Walk, Don't Run," when the
movies' most durable Cassa
nova, Cary Grant, is content to
clear the field for the armorous
pursuits of his young protege.
Now in the silver-haired twi
light of his career, the debo
naire Mr. Grant has lost none
of his skill and aplomb. As
always it is a pleasure to watch
his adroit maneuverings in and
out of ticklish situations. Often
befuddled, he is never ruffled.
It is Grant's impeccable per
formance which lifts "Walk,
Don't Run," an otherwise thinly
conceived, artlessly contrived
situation comedy, into the realm
of possible entertainment.
Grant plays an eccentric mil
lionaire, Sir William Rutland,
who, arriving in Tokyo shortly
before the Olympics and finding
no hotel openings, answers an
ad for sharing an apartment
room.
It could happen only in the
movies, for who appears at the
apartment door but a gorgeous
young woman (Samantha Eg
gar). It readily becomes appar
ent, however, that the dream
girl has a plain-jane personal
ity and could never have con
ceived of sharing her apartment
with a man, let alone a strange
