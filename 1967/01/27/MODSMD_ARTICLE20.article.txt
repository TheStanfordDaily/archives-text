# Swimmers Shoot For Relays Records
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER Sports Editor 
Stanford swimmers plan to
paddle to the cadence of cracked
records this weekend. The Cards
host Cal today at 3:30 p.m. The
record assult continues Satur
day, as four teams, including the
omnipotent Santa Clara Swim
Club, invade the Enema chlorine

cloister at 2 p.m. for the annual
Stanford Relays.
Stanford's three world rec
ord holders, Greg Buckingham,
Luis Nicolao, and Dick Roth,
will go with Mark Parmely after
the NCAA record for the 800
freestyle relay. The quartet must
average 1:45.5 or faster for each
200 leg to beat the 7:02.6 Indiana

record.
Every meet record in the 8-
event Relays is in jeopardy. The
400 medley relay should be the
race of the afternoon. Stanford
goes with its very strongest,
Bill Kee, Bob Momsen, Luis
Nicolao, and Greg Buckingham,
but the Indians will be hard
pressed to win.

Santa Clara Swim Club's med
ley relay of Mitch Ivey, Jack
Faunce, Mark Spitz, and Don
Roth or Bob Jamison is loaded
to the gills. Ivey and Faunce put
together the best high school
backstroke-breaststroke combo
in the country.
Hot Spitz
Spitz, a sure Olympic swim
mer, won the 100 meters butter
fly in the AAU nationals after
his sophomore year of high
school, and can swim anything.
Don Roth is the NCAA 100 free
style champion. Jamison and
Rick Eagleston will sting the
Cards in the freestyle sprints
all afternoon.
Stanford's 300 individual med
ley relay of Roth, Buckingham,
and Parmely will be the fastest
ever. Roth and Buckingham are
the fastest IM men in the world,
and Parmely is third in the
AAWU.
Backstroke Doomed
Kee, Pete Siebert, and Bob
Hart should tear the 300 back

stroke relay to shreds. Stan
ford's 400 freestyle relay of Bill
Meyer, Mike Wall, Morgan Man
ning and Jim Laney will have a
rough go of it against Santa
Clara's relay of Spitz, Eagle
ston, Jamison, and Don Roth.
Foothill Aquatic Club, San
Jose State, Cal, and the Stan
ford frosh trail behind the two
leaders in the Relays. Foothill
AC has a few outstanding in
dividuals, but probably not

enough to push Stanford and
Santa Clara.
Last year the Relays ended in
a three-way tie between Stan
ford, the Stanford frosh, and
Santa Clara.
Cal has lost 36 straight dual
meets to Stanford swimmers,
and conservative estimates in
dicate the string may hold for
another season.
Frosh Debut Against Cal
The Stanford frosh face the
Cal freshmen today at 3:30 p.m.
for their season opener. Richie
Williams and Jim Nickoloff carry
the heaviest weight for the Pa
pooses.
Williams was a high school
All-American in three events, and
Nickoloff made All-American in
the 100 butterfly. Nick Dondero
will be the Papooses' big gun in
the breaststroke.
Bill Main, CIF diving cham
pion and All-American 50 free
styler, puts Stanford's best-ever
technique upon the Encina div
ing boards.

Santa Clara Swim Club's med
ley relay of Mitch Ivey, Jack
Faunce, Mark Spitz, and Don
Roth or Bob Jamison is loaded
to the gills. Ivey and Faunce put
together the best high school
backstroke-breaststroke combo
in the country.
Hot Spitz
Spitz, a sure Olympic swim
mer, won the 100 meters butter
fly in the AAU nationals after
his sophomore year of high
school, and can swim anything.
Don Roth is the NCAA 100 free
style champion. Jamison and
Rick Eagleston will sting the
Cards in the freestyle sprints
all afternoon.
Stanford's 300 individual med
ley relay of Roth, Buckingham,
and Parmely will be the fastest
ever. Roth and Buckingham are
the fastest IM men in the world,
and Parmely is third in the
AAWU.
Backstroke Doomed
Kee, Pete Siebert, and Bob
Hart should tear the 300 back

stroke relay to shreds. Stan
ford's 400 freestyle relay of Bill
Meyer, Mike Wall, Morgan Man
ning and Jim Laney will have a
rough go of it against Santa
Clara's relay of Spitz, Eagle
ston, Jamison, and Don Roth.
Foothill Aquatic Club, San
Jose State, Cal, and the Stan
ford frosh trail behind the two
leaders in the Relays. Foothill
AC has a few outstanding in
dividuals, but probably not

enough to push Stanford and
Santa Clara.
Last year the Relays ended in
a three-way tie between Stan
ford, the Stanford frosh, and
Santa Clara.
Cal has lost 36 straight dual
meets to Stanford swimmers,
and conservative estimates in
dicate the string may hold for
another season.
Frosh Debut Against Cal
The Stanford frosh face the
Cal freshmen today at 3:30 p.m.
for their season opener. Richie
Williams and Jim Nickoloff carry
the heaviest weight for the Pa
pooses.
Williams was a high school
All-American in three events, and
Nickoloff made All-American in
the 100 butterfly. Nick Dondero
will be the Papooses' big gun in
the breaststroke.
Bill Main, CIF diving cham
pion and All-American 50 free
styler, puts Stanford's best-ever
technique upon the Encina div
ing boards.
Stanford swimmers plan to
paddle to the cadence of cracked
records this weekend. The Cards
host Cal today at 3:30 p.m. The
record assult continues Satur
day, as four teams, including the
omnipotent Santa Clara Swim
Club, invade the Enema chlorine

cloister at 2 p.m. for the annual
Stanford Relays.
Stanford's three world rec
ord holders, Greg Buckingham,
Luis Nicolao, and Dick Roth,
will go with Mark Parmely after
the NCAA record for the 800
freestyle relay. The quartet must
average 1:45.5 or faster for each
200 leg to beat the 7:02.6 Indiana

record.
Every meet record in the 8-
event Relays is in jeopardy. The
400 medley relay should be the
race of the afternoon. Stanford
goes with its very strongest,
Bill Kee, Bob Momsen, Luis
Nicolao, and Greg Buckingham,
but the Indians will be hard
pressed to win.
