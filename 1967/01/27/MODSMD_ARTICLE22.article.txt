## 
### NICK SELBY 
Stanford's steadily improving
wrestling team faces its tough
est match of the season when it
meets Cal Poly from San Luis
Obispo at 1:30 p.m. Saturday
afternoon in Encina Gym.
Cal Poly, boasting tlieir best
team ever, finished over 90
points ahead of the Indians in
a December tournament.
Before the Varsity match, the
J.V. and freshman wrestlers
will wrestle their counterparts
from Cal Poly in a match not
open to the public. The same
team will wrestle again at 6 p.m.
Saturday night in Encina Gym
against Chabot Junior College.
National Champs
Cal Poly visits Stanford with
a team better than last year's

college division national cham
pionship team. Captain of the
team is John Miller, 160 pounds,
who was runner up in the col
lege NCAA's at 152 last year.
Doug Gunesch will wrestle him
for the Tribe.
At 152 pounds, last year's 145
pound national champion Den
nis Downing will face Stanford's
captain, Len Borchers. Borchers
is undefeated this year and
Coach Jerry Budzik considers
him an excellent prospect for a
conference championship. It
should be the match of the day.
At 167 pounds, Stanford's
Burt Ambler will face last year's
California College champ, Dean
Hilger.
Best Face Off
The three matches pit Stan

ford's best against Cal Poly's
best, and should decide the
match outcome. Coach Budzik
said his team was a definite un
derdog, but that he expected sev
eral upsets in the dual matches.
