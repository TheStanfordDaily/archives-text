co-favorites with USC and UCLA
to win it this year.
Cal has been scoring about 172
ooints per meet this year com
pared to Stanford's 140. The In
dians, who are 3-0, did get up to
154.10 against Nevada in their
first meet.
Bears Tops In U.S.
Sid Freudenstein, the Bears'
all-around man, will be the man
to watch. His 55 point score
earlier this year places him first
in all-around in the United
States. His best events are floor
exercise and long horse.
Backing him up are two out
standing sophomores, Gary Dia
mond and Joel Tepp. Diamond's
trong points arp floor exercise
and the parallel bars. Tepp is
capable of being a national
champion on the side horse.
Senior Josh Robison will also
provide Cal with some points.
He has been the AAWU ring
champion for two years and is
;ut to make it three this season.
Hart To Beat
Stanford coach John Gilmore
said that in addition to all the
outstanding individuals, Cal has
tremendous depth that will be
very hard to overcome.
Jim Petersen will be compet
ing in all-around. Others com
peting will bo John Rinder
knecht, Bill Fisher, Rich Guess,
John Marks, Harry Miller, Brad
Pearson and Jim Snyder.
Frosh Meet, Too
The freshmen will meet the
Cal frosh just before the varsity
meet.

Cal's all-around man, Orrin
Borders, has scored around 42
points this season. Stanford's
Craig Dickson scored 46 in all
around last week against the
varsity.
Depth is the determining fac
tor in this meet. Stanford has
the better gymnasts, but will be
forced to leave six spots open
because of the shortage of
men on the team.
