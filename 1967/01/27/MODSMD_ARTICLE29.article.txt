# Individual And University
## 
### 
In the various controversies which have
crossed the front page of The Daily during Vol
ume 150, there has been one concept inherent in
every debate, but little discussed. That concept
is individualism.
The problem of roles was a real issue in history
long before social scientists appropriated the
term. But the problem of the individual has al
ways been acknowledged, regardless the era or
place. And so we ask today, what is the purpose
of the individual in the university.
We believe that it is the search for wisdom
and personal growth which binds together the
members of the academic community. As ab
struse as such a search may seem, each individ
ual in the community who takes his presence
seriously shares this quest. The wisdom of which
we are speaking is founded in knowledge, tem
pered in judgment and thought, and crystalized
in personal values and principles.
The university is more than society's citadel
of compiled knowledge. Again, it is more than a
center for formal education, for if this were the
university's only merit, we might have preferred
the sort of self-education which once made Lin
colns.
Rather it is in the pursuit of wisdom and per
sonal growth that the individual finds his pur
pose in the university, and the university its rea
son for existing. Wisdom can exist but in the in
dividual: its attainment is the work of one man—
scholar or student—with the inspiration of many
but with the work of one.

While the structures of the university provide
guidelines for growth, the individual is the one
who grows. Each person in the community faces
a different challenge in the pursuit and exercise
of wisdom, and at times we have addressed our
selves to some of these challenges.
But in essence we have found that no struc
ture or set of assumptions can replace individual
initiative; moreover that no growth, no matter
how exciting the context, can take place without
the active commitment of the individual.
The merit of the university is that all have, at
least in word, committed themselves to their
growth, and at the same time, to the growth of
others. A great university is one which manifests
this commitment of many levels of its organiza
tion.
It is with this concept of the individual that
we have written for the past five months. We
have asked of leaders that they wield their au
thority in light of the wisdom and power of in
spiration which they possess, and of all mem
bers of the community that they pursue wisdom
in their lives.
As we began the year, we outlined particular
challenges for each member of the community
—students, faculty, and administrators—which
stemmed from the pursuit of wisdom. Although
a number of the particularities have been real
ized, the greater challenge remains and will al
ways remain.
To our successors we leave the task of making
the challenge of wisdom apparent in the day to
day life of each individual in the university.

son for existing. Wisdom can exist but in the in
dividual: its attainment is the work of one man—
scholar or student—with the inspiration of many
but with the work of one.

While the structures of the university provide
guidelines for growth, the individual is the one
who grows. Each person in the community faces
a different challenge in the pursuit and exercise
of wisdom, and at times we have addressed our
selves to some of these challenges.
But in essence we have found that no struc
ture or set of assumptions can replace individual
initiative; moreover that no growth, no matter
how exciting the context, can take place without
the active commitment of the individual.
The merit of the university is that all have, at
least in word, committed themselves to their
growth, and at the same time, to the growth of
others. A great university is one which manifests
this commitment of many levels of its organiza
tion.
It is with this concept of the individual that
we have written for the past five months. We
have asked of leaders that they wield their au
thority in light of the wisdom and power of in
spiration which they possess, and of all mem
bers of the community that they pursue wisdom
in their lives.
As we began the year, we outlined particular
challenges for each member of the community
—students, faculty, and administrators—which
stemmed from the pursuit of wisdom. Although
a number of the particularities have been real
ized, the greater challenge remains and will al
ways remain.
To our successors we leave the task of making
the challenge of wisdom apparent in the day to
day life of each individual in the university.
In the various controversies which have
crossed the front page of The Daily during Vol
ume 150, there has been one concept inherent in
every debate, but little discussed. That concept
is individualism.
The problem of roles was a real issue in history
long before social scientists appropriated the
term. But the problem of the individual has al
ways been acknowledged, regardless the era or
place. And so we ask today, what is the purpose
of the individual in the university.
We believe that it is the search for wisdom
and personal growth which binds together the
members of the academic community. As ab
struse as such a search may seem, each individ
ual in the community who takes his presence
seriously shares this quest. The wisdom of which
we are speaking is founded in knowledge, tem
pered in judgment and thought, and crystalized
in personal values and principles.
The university is more than society's citadel
of compiled knowledge. Again, it is more than a
center for formal education, for if this were the
university's only merit, we might have preferred
the sort of self-education which once made Lin
colns.
Rather it is in the pursuit of wisdom and per
sonal growth that the individual finds his pur
pose in the university, and the university its rea
son for existing. Wisdom can exist but in the in
dividual: its attainment is the work of one man—
scholar or student—with the inspiration of many
but with the work of one.
