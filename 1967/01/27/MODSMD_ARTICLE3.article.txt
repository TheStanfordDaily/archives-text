# NEAR SUCCESS?
## Quest For Coffee House 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
The quest for a coffee house at Stan
ford is on the threshold of success.
If approval is granted by the Tresid
der Union Board and Committee and
funds are allocated by LASSU, a cof
fee house will open in Tresidder on
February 9.
The house, to be located in two al
coves adjacent to the eating area in
Tresidder, will be open on Thursday
and Friday nights from 10 to 1:30.
Various types of coffee and pastry
will be available and decorations and
lighting will provide a coffee house
atmosphere.
At Wednesday night's LASSU meet
ing the unofficial coffee house commit
tee, which has been working since the
end of Fall Quarter, presented its re
quest for funds. This request for $429
in initial operating costs will be voted
on at next Thursday's meeting. Com
mittee members feel the funds will be
granted without delay.
No Quorum
Both the TMU Board and Commit
tee will meet next week to vote on
the proposal. At a previous Board
meeting there was no quorum so ac
tion was delayed. The Committee,
composed of faculty and students, has
already approved the proposal "in
principle." Since Chester Berry, Direc
tor of Tresidder, has been consulted
constantly during drafting of the pro
posal, committee members feel the
chances of final passage are good.
The formal presentation of coffee
house plans comes after a series of
controversies about establishment of
a house at Stanford.
Last summer a coffee house was
run in the International Center and
backed by the University. The house,
called the AS SUCH, encountered dif
ficulties, however, as the administra

tion became worried about passage
and consumption of drugs. When the
Fall Quarter began the house was
closed to make way for foreign stu
dents and the university made no offer
to provide new space.
The Hypothesis
Early in the quarter, Dean Joel
Smith commenting on a coffee house
said that drug takers would be among
those attracted. A number of students
refused to accept this hypothesis and
continued to seek some answer. In
response to a space problem students
looked to the Reserve Book Room
which was to be vacated and the base
ment of the Women's Club House.
Both proved unsuitable.
Toward the end of the quarter,
there were several movements .orga
nized. One worked on a coffee house
off-campus, another concentrated on
finding space for the 1967-68 year, and
a third was interested in immediate
establishment. This final group got
the support of several faculty mem
bers, including Dean Napier.
As this quarter began, meetings
were held in Dean Napier's house and
a drafting group of four students
was chosen. They were: Janet Cox,
Kirk Hanson, Leslie Hill, and Penny
Moriarity. Norton Batkin advised for
the Tresidder Board. They soon
formed their proposals and had in
formal talks with administrators. With
general support, they officially ap
proached University officials.
Break-In Period
If the Coffee House is approved,
committee members hope it can ex
pand operating hours after an initial
break-in- period. The house will be
open to all Stanford students, fac
ulty, staff and their guests. To prevent
a deluge of non-university people,

student body cards will be necessary
for admittance. The only entrance will
be through the side patio door.
One problem the house faces is con
tinued decorating and dismanteling
since the rooms will be in normal
service during the day. The commit
tee plans to pay students $1.25 an
hour for working during regular
coffee house hours.

student body cards will be necessary
for admittance. The only entrance will
be through the side patio door.
One problem the house faces is con
tinued decorating and dismanteling
since the rooms will be in normal
service during the day. The commit
tee plans to pay students $1.25 an
hour for working during regular
coffee house hours.
The quest for a coffee house at Stan
ford is on the threshold of success.
If approval is granted by the Tresid
der Union Board and Committee and
funds are allocated by LASSU, a cof
fee house will open in Tresidder on
February 9.
The house, to be located in two al
coves adjacent to the eating area in
Tresidder, will be open on Thursday
and Friday nights from 10 to 1:30.
Various types of coffee and pastry
will be available and decorations and
lighting will provide a coffee house
atmosphere.
At Wednesday night's LASSU meet
ing the unofficial coffee house commit
tee, which has been working since the
end of Fall Quarter, presented its re
quest for funds. This request for $429
in initial operating costs will be voted
on at next Thursday's meeting. Com
mittee members feel the funds will be
granted without delay.
No Quorum
Both the TMU Board and Commit
tee will meet next week to vote on
the proposal. At a previous Board
meeting there was no quorum so ac
tion was delayed. The Committee,
composed of faculty and students, has
already approved the proposal "in
principle." Since Chester Berry, Direc
tor of Tresidder, has been consulted
constantly during drafting of the pro
posal, committee members feel the
chances of final passage are good.
The formal presentation of coffee
house plans comes after a series of
controversies about establishment of
a house at Stanford.
Last summer a coffee house was
run in the International Center and
backed by the University. The house,
called the AS SUCH, encountered dif
ficulties, however, as the administra

tion became worried about passage
and consumption of drugs. When the
Fall Quarter began the house was
closed to make way for foreign stu
dents and the university made no offer
to provide new space.
The Hypothesis
Early in the quarter, Dean Joel
Smith commenting on a coffee house
said that drug takers would be among
those attracted. A number of students
refused to accept this hypothesis and
continued to seek some answer. In
response to a space problem students
looked to the Reserve Book Room
which was to be vacated and the base
ment of the Women's Club House.
Both proved unsuitable.
Toward the end of the quarter,
there were several movements .orga
nized. One worked on a coffee house
off-campus, another concentrated on
finding space for the 1967-68 year, and
a third was interested in immediate
establishment. This final group got
the support of several faculty mem
bers, including Dean Napier.
As this quarter began, meetings
were held in Dean Napier's house and
a drafting group of four students
was chosen. They were: Janet Cox,
Kirk Hanson, Leslie Hill, and Penny
Moriarity. Norton Batkin advised for
the Tresidder Board. They soon
formed their proposals and had in
formal talks with administrators. With
general support, they officially ap
proached University officials.
Break-In Period
If the Coffee House is approved,
committee members hope it can ex
pand operating hours after an initial
break-in- period. The house will be
open to all Stanford students, fac
ulty, staff and their guests. To prevent
a deluge of non-university people,

student body cards will be necessary
for admittance. The only entrance will
be through the side patio door.
