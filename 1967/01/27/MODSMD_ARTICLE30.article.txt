ford last fall.)

I am walking around on cam
pus. Every now and then some
students hurry past me; their
steps can be heard as a click
clack sound in the quiet after
noon.
As I walk, I close my eyes; the
sun in my face, the quietness of
the day, and the comfortable
feeling I have make my thoughts
leave the present and go back
to my hometown.
I can see myself walking along
the sidewalk in my hometown.
There are small restaurants, and
I usually stop at one of them, for
man cannot live on pleasant
thoughts alone. During summer
time there are small tables cov
ered with coolorful tablecloths
on the sidewalk outside the res
taurants. Glasses with flowers
have been placed on the tables
and the setting is quite pictur
esque. An excellent place for
pleasant dreaming.
I sit down at a table next to
the fence and tilt my chair back
and lean against it, letting my
eyes glide over my environment.
A waiter dressed in dark trous
ers and a white coat comes up to
my table in a polite manner and
asks me what I would like to
have. I take the menu he hands
me.
I decide on a roast-beef sand
wich and a bottle of light beer.
The waiter takes my order with
a polite "Thank you," and soon
after he returns with my sand
wich on a silver plate and the
bottle and glass on a tray.
The thought of food, however,
takes me back to reality and
again I find myself walking
around on campus, and I am
hungry. With this feeling in my
stomach, I leave the path on
which I have been walking and
and head for Tresidder Union.
As I approach this eating place,
I hear a sound that rips through
the quiet air like lightening in a
thunderstorm.

The sound grows louder and
louder as I come closer to Tresid
der and finally it sounds as if I
were in a mineshaft in the middle
of a hectic working day. Next to
Tresidder there is some construc
tion work going on and a com
presosr is working at full capac
ity while a cement-mixer is mix
ing cement, and a pump pumps
the cement to whereever it is to
be used. Diesel-smoke is drifting
over the outdoor tables at Tre-

sidder Union while glasses on
the tables shake in the airbreak
ing sound.
The outdoor eating area is
heavily congested with students.
I look around to find a place to
sit down, but in vain. There is
not a single empty spot in the
area, or so it looks. Where people
are not sitting, trays, paper nap
kins, knives and forks, half emp
tied glasses with milk or juice;
half eaten rolls, hamburgers,
salads and spaghetti are piled up

and mixed together in such a
way that it looks as if it all had
been through the cement-mixer
thirty feet away. Two dogs are
systematically working their
way through the mess. The dogs
do not look underfed. They are
probably good customers here.
A student, dressed in a coat
that might have been white once
but now is of an undetermined
color, pushes a big wagon-like
device around where he can find

space. He picks up the trays and
the half eaten food and shuffles
it all into the wagon in a way
that makes him look like a pro
fessional garbage collector. May
be he is. If so, that's good because
that is what they need around
here after the look of the place.
There might be some vacant
seats inside the building, so I go
in. Two things are different here
inside. The noise is not so annoy
ing, and there are no dogs. For
some reason I feel that some

dogs should have been here too;
they would fit into the total pic
ture rather well.
If my system had not cried for
food the way it did, I would have
left the place. As I come up to the
counter where the food is, I feel
as if I am being sucked into a
rip-current. I can do nothing but
follow the crowd. We move slow
ly along the counter from one
end to the other. People around
me reach and stretch for the food
on the counter in such a manner
that I believe they cannot have
eaten for days. It is a complete
chaos and in my struggle for sur
vival I forget completely why I
am there. Not until I am almost
at the end of the counter do I
discover that so far I have not
gotten any food. In a last effort
to satisfy my stomach, I flex my
muscles and force my way
through the crowd to the coun
ter. Just before I am pushed
back again I get ahold of an
apple.
After that I do not remember
much. I know I paid for the apple
because no one stopped me on
my way out. How I managed to
get out of the chaos I do not
know. I just suddenly discover I
am back in the outdoor eating
area, my hands clutching the
apple. To start looking for a
place to sit again is unnecessary.
I can eat my apple while stand
ing up.
The apple does a rather poor
job of satisfying my hunger. To
try to get some more food is out
of the question. Instead I try to
find comfort in the saying that
man does not live on bread alone;
then I start walking away from
Tresidder.
America is a highly civilized
country, and the Americans are
proud of it. Most people on earth,
whether they are pro- or anti-
America, are trying to catch up
with the U.S. in that field.
If, however, the situation at
Tresidder Union is a typical re
sult of civilization, I will do
almost anything to stay uncivil
ized, because then civilization
definitely represents a decline of
the human race.

wich on a silver plate and the
bottle and glass on a tray.
The thought of food, however,
takes me back to reality and
again I find myself walking
around on campus, and I am
hungry. With this feeling in my
stomach, I leave the path on
which I have been walking and
and head for Tresidder Union.
As I approach this eating place,
I hear a sound that rips through
the quiet air like lightening in a
thunderstorm.

The sound grows louder and
louder as I come closer to Tresid
der and finally it sounds as if I
were in a mineshaft in the middle
of a hectic working day. Next to
Tresidder there is some construc
tion work going on and a com
presosr is working at full capac
ity while a cement-mixer is mix
ing cement, and a pump pumps
the cement to whereever it is to
be used. Diesel-smoke is drifting
over the outdoor tables at Tre-

sidder Union while glasses on
the tables shake in the airbreak
ing sound.
The outdoor eating area is
heavily congested with students.
I look around to find a place to
sit down, but in vain. There is
not a single empty spot in the
area, or so it looks. Where people
are not sitting, trays, paper nap
kins, knives and forks, half emp
tied glasses with milk or juice;
half eaten rolls, hamburgers,
salads and spaghetti are piled up

and mixed together in such a
way that it looks as if it all had
been through the cement-mixer
thirty feet away. Two dogs are
systematically working their
way through the mess. The dogs
do not look underfed. They are
probably good customers here.
A student, dressed in a coat
that might have been white once
but now is of an undetermined
color, pushes a big wagon-like
device around where he can find

space. He picks up the trays and
the half eaten food and shuffles
it all into the wagon in a way
that makes him look like a pro
fessional garbage collector. May
be he is. If so, that's good because
that is what they need around
here after the look of the place.
There might be some vacant
seats inside the building, so I go
in. Two things are different here
inside. The noise is not so annoy
ing, and there are no dogs. For
some reason I feel that some

dogs should have been here too;
they would fit into the total pic
ture rather well.
If my system had not cried for
food the way it did, I would have
left the place. As I come up to the
counter where the food is, I feel
as if I am being sucked into a
rip-current. I can do nothing but
follow the crowd. We move slow
ly along the counter from one
end to the other. People around
me reach and stretch for the food
on the counter in such a manner
that I believe they cannot have
eaten for days. It is a complete
chaos and in my struggle for sur
vival I forget completely why I
am there. Not until I am almost
at the end of the counter do I
discover that so far I have not
gotten any food. In a last effort
to satisfy my stomach, I flex my
muscles and force my way
through the crowd to the coun
ter. Just before I am pushed
back again I get ahold of an
apple.
After that I do not remember
much. I know I paid for the apple
because no one stopped me on
my way out. How I managed to
get out of the chaos I do not
know. I just suddenly discover I
am back in the outdoor eating
area, my hands clutching the
apple. To start looking for a
place to sit again is unnecessary.
I can eat my apple while stand
ing up.
The apple does a rather poor
job of satisfying my hunger. To
try to get some more food is out
of the question. Instead I try to
find comfort in the saying that
man does not live on bread alone;
then I start walking away from
Tresidder.
America is a highly civilized
country, and the Americans are
proud of it. Most people on earth,
whether they are pro- or anti-
America, are trying to catch up
with the U.S. in that field.
If, however, the situation at
Tresidder Union is a typical re
sult of civilization, I will do
almost anything to stay uncivil
ized, because then civilization
definitely represents a decline of
the human race.

I can see myself walking along

There are small restaurants, and
I usually stop at one of them, for
man cannot live on pleasant
thoughts alone. During summer
time there are small tables cov
ered with coolorful tablecloths
on the sidewalk outside the res
taurants. Glasses with flowers
have been placed on the tables
and the setting is quite pictur
esque. An excellent place for
pleasant dreaming.
I sit down at a table next to
the fence and tilt my chair back
and lean against it, letting my
eyes glide over my environment.
A waiter dressed in dark trous
ers and a white coat comes up to
my table in a polite manner and
asks me what I would like to
have. I take the menu he hands
me.
I decide on a roast-beef sand
wich and a bottle of light beer.

way through the mess. The dogs
do not look underfed. They are
probably good customers here.
A student, dressed in a coat
that might have been white once
but now is of an undetermined
color, pushes a big wagon-like
device around where he can find

space. He picks up the trays and
the half eaten food and shuffles
it all into the wagon in a way
that makes him look like a pro
fessional garbage collector. May
be he is. If so, that's good because
that is what they need around
here after the look of the place.
There might be some vacant
seats inside the building, so I go
in. Two things are different here
inside. The noise is not so annoy
ing, and there are no dogs. For
some reason I feel that some

dogs should have been here too;
they would fit into the total pic
ture rather well.
If my system had not cried for
food the way it did, I would have
left the place. As I come up to the
counter where the food is, I feel
as if I am being sucked into a
rip-current. I can do nothing but
follow the crowd. We move slow
ly along the counter from one
end to the other. People around
me reach and stretch for the food
on the counter in such a manner
that I believe they cannot have
eaten for days. It is a complete
chaos and in my struggle for sur
vival I forget completely why I
am there. Not until I am almost
at the end of the counter do I
discover that so far I have not
gotten any food. In a last effort
to satisfy my stomach, I flex my
muscles and force my way
through the crowd to the coun
ter. Just before I am pushed
back again I get ahold of an
apple.
After that I do not remember
much. I know I paid for the apple
because no one stopped me on
my way out. How I managed to
get out of the chaos I do not
know. I just suddenly discover I
am back in the outdoor eating
area, my hands clutching the
apple. To start looking for a
place to sit again is unnecessary.
I can eat my apple while stand
ing up.
The apple does a rather poor
job of satisfying my hunger. To
try to get some more food is out
of the question. Instead I try to
find comfort in the saying that
man does not live on bread alone;
then I start walking away from
Tresidder.
America is a highly civilized
country, and the Americans are
proud of it. Most people on earth,
whether they are pro- or anti-
America, are trying to catch up
with the U.S. in that field.
If, however, the situation at
Tresidder Union is a typical re
sult of civilization, I will do
almost anything to stay uncivil
ized, because then civilization
definitely represents a decline of
the human race.

ford last fall.)

I am walking around on cam
pus. Every now and then some
students hurry past me; their
steps can be heard as a click
clack sound in the quiet after
noon.
As I walk, I close my eyes; the
sun in my face, the quietness of
the day, and the comfortable
feeling I have make my thoughts
leave the present and go back
to my hometown.
I can see myself walking along
the sidewalk in my hometown.
There are small restaurants, and
I usually stop at one of them, for
man cannot live on pleasant
thoughts alone. During summer
time there are small tables cov
ered with coolorful tablecloths
on the sidewalk outside the res
taurants. Glasses with flowers
have been placed on the tables
and the setting is quite pictur
esque. An excellent place for
pleasant dreaming.
I sit down at a table next to
the fence and tilt my chair back
and lean against it, letting my
eyes glide over my environment.
A waiter dressed in dark trous
ers and a white coat comes up to
my table in a polite manner and
asks me what I would like to
have. I take the menu he hands
me.
I decide on a roast-beef sand
wich and a bottle of light beer.
The waiter takes my order with
a polite "Thank you," and soon
after he returns with my sand
wich on a silver plate and the
bottle and glass on a tray.
The thought of food, however,
takes me back to reality and
again I find myself walking
around on campus, and I am
hungry. With this feeling in my
stomach, I leave the path on
which I have been walking and
and head for Tresidder Union.
As I approach this eating place,
I hear a sound that rips through
the quiet air like lightening in a
thunderstorm.

The sound grows louder and
louder as I come closer to Tresid
der and finally it sounds as if I
were in a mineshaft in the middle
of a hectic working day. Next to
Tresidder there is some construc
tion work going on and a com
presosr is working at full capac
ity while a cement-mixer is mix
ing cement, and a pump pumps
the cement to whereever it is to
be used. Diesel-smoke is drifting
over the outdoor tables at Tre-

sidder Union while glasses on
the tables shake in the airbreak
ing sound.
The outdoor eating area is
heavily congested with students.
I look around to find a place to
sit down, but in vain. There is
not a single empty spot in the
area, or so it looks. Where people
are not sitting, trays, paper nap
kins, knives and forks, half emp
tied glasses with milk or juice;
half eaten rolls, hamburgers,
salads and spaghetti are piled up

and mixed together in such a
way that it looks as if it all had
been through the cement-mixer
thirty feet away. Two dogs are
systematically working their
way through the mess. The dogs
do not look underfed. They are
probably good customers here.

to satisfy my stomach, I flex my
muscles and force my way
through the crowd to the coun
ter. Just before I am pushed
back again I get ahold of an
apple.
After that I do not remember
much. I know I paid for the apple
because no one stopped me on
my way out. How I managed to
get out of the chaos I do not
know. I just suddenly discover I
am back in the outdoor eating
area, my hands clutching the
apple. To start looking for a
place to sit again is unnecessary.
I can eat my apple while stand
ing up.
The apple does a rather poor
job of satisfying my hunger. To
try to get some more food is out
of the question. Instead I try to
find comfort in the saying that
man does not live on bread alone;
then I start walking away from
Tresidder.
America is a highly civilized
country, and the Americans are
proud of it. Most people on earth,
whether they are pro- or anti-
America, are trying to catch up
with the U.S. in that field.
If, however, the situation at
Tresidder Union is a typical re
sult of civilization, I will do
almost anything to stay uncivil
ized, because then civilization
definitely represents a decline of
the human race.


For Man Cannot Live By Civilization Alone . . .
