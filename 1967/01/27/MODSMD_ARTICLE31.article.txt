Editor, The Daily:
Thank you for saying that "it
is time for reform and not revo
lution." As a fraternity mem
ber, I welcome criticisms and
questions of "my" system. But
because I am internally involved
with that system, I would like
to clarify the position of one
fraternity.
This year, as in past years
our GPA puts us academically
among the top living groups. In
addition to high academic
achievement, however, we have
felt increased desire for con
tact with faculty and adminis
tration. This is exemplified by
increased faculty attendance at
meals followed by discussion,
and in-the-house seminar, and a
new program whereby each
week a different member of the
faculty or administration lives
for three days in our house. In
addition, we are increasing our
meal associate program to ac
quire more contact with grad
uate students and women stu

dents on a level less intense
than the dating situation.
One of the advantages of a
fraternity is its sensativity to
the desires of its members. Re
cent change of our rush proce
dures is a result of the faults
found with our rush in previous
years. We do not believe it is
the manner in which our mem
bers are chosen that is most im
portant. Rather, what is done by
and with these members deter
mines the value of our fra
ternity.
Carl Mundt and you both men
tioned the "gap between social
and academic." From the actions
of my fraternity and other liv
ing groups on campus it is evi
dent that this gap is not as de
sirable as it apparently was
previously. Fraternities are open
to change, not destruction. If
existing situations are under
stood, questions are asked; if
suggestions are made, improve
ments are possible.
