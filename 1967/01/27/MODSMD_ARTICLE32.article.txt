# Two Minutes of Haight
## Who's Salvation? 
### Tim Haight 
Which is it going to be, indivi
dual or social salvation? If any
simply stated dilemma can size
up the predicament of this gen
eration, this is it.
Two archtypal figures are bat
tling for our lives. One is the
retiring hippie, the other the
angry activist. True, Horatio Al
ger has not completely aband
onded the field, but he is char
acteristic of our parents' gen
eration, not ours.
Stokely Charmichael says that
he is inhuman because it is the
only way he can stay sane. Hiro
shima, Vietnam, the South, the
contrast of starvation and plenty,
all have forced him to don the
armor of commitment.
Timothy Leary talks of karma.
You are a tree in the forest.
Middle Way
Is there a compromise? Not
an easy one. The categorical im
perative buzzes in the back of
our minds, saying, "You Ameri

can heir of the middle class.
You can skim your serenity off
the top of the human pile. But
the Vietnamese peasant loses
his rice to the Viet Cong and
his hut to the American napalm.
You are looking out your front
window, watching a rape with
quiet contemplation."
But the human empathy that
gives birth to the activist is too
often put away as a childish
thing. Tactics, ideology, action,
and public relations become the
tools of the activist, and the ef
fective use of those tools de
mand thick callouses.
A middle way could be an an
swer, save for one complication.
To achieve either of these two
goals demands real effort, to
achieve both is almost an impos
sibility. The social fabric that
encompasses us all guarantees
that. Both the activist and the
hippie are foreign to the cul
ture of America and its corp
orate, industrial, Madison Ave
nue demands.
American Dream
But the figures themselves,
the aspirations, are not foreign
to the American dream. Lyndon
Johnson probably does see him
self as a social activist and a
lover of the good. Even Dale
Carnegie's infamous book illus
trates the need for human con
tact, if only superficially.
So what's the answer? Who
knows? All that can be offered
here is a very idealistic hope.
We must disengage ourselves
from the ego involvements that
divert us from the problem, re
member the goals of human
love and dignity we value, and
try to change our society with
out becoming hateful in the
process.
Just Guidance
That's easily said, isn't it? A
grasshopper once asked a cock
roach how to prepare for the
winter. The cockroach said,
"Find a bakery, crawl down be
hind the radiator, turn yourself
into a cockroach and relax."
When the grasshopper protested
that that was impossible, the
cockroach replied, "Don't blame
me, I can only give policy guid
ance."
If anyone has a better idea,
the space in this column is his.
Perhaps if we could find all the
people in this University who
were working on ways to make
our society more human — by
peace research, human problems
study, or social planning — and
find some way to make that
relevent to more than a journal
article, we'd be somewhere.
But the academician gets
sucked into the status quo, and
all of a sudden the man next to
you in the Hoover library is
from the CIA. And Stanford Re
-search Institute is designing
poison gas. So fear mounts that
the gradualism of the university
liberal is too slow.
Humility may be an answer,
and patience. But tyrants ad
vise this of their subjects as
often as gurus of their pupils.
The answer, my friend, is blow
ing in the winds of freedom, but
the air is calm, just now.
In The Trial, a man sells all
he has to bribe the guard at the
gate of the castle. He does this
not because he expects success,
but because he cannot stand
the fear of leaving some alter
native untried. Do something,
readers, anywav.

Middle Way
Is there a compromise? Not
an easy one. The categorical im
perative buzzes in the back of
our minds, saying, "You Ameri

can heir of the middle class.
You can skim your serenity off
the top of the human pile. But
the Vietnamese peasant loses
his rice to the Viet Cong and
his hut to the American napalm.
You are looking out your front
window, watching a rape with
quiet contemplation."
But the human empathy that
gives birth to the activist is too
often put away as a childish
thing. Tactics, ideology, action,
and public relations become the
tools of the activist, and the ef
fective use of those tools de
mand thick callouses.
A middle way could be an an
swer, save for one complication.
To achieve either of these two
goals demands real effort, to
achieve both is almost an impos
sibility. The social fabric that
encompasses us all guarantees
that. Both the activist and the
hippie are foreign to the cul
ture of America and its corp
orate, industrial, Madison Ave
nue demands.
American Dream
But the figures themselves,
the aspirations, are not foreign
to the American dream. Lyndon
Johnson probably does see him
self as a social activist and a
lover of the good. Even Dale
Carnegie's infamous book illus
trates the need for human con
tact, if only superficially.
So what's the answer? Who
knows? All that can be offered
here is a very idealistic hope.
We must disengage ourselves
from the ego involvements that
divert us from the problem, re
member the goals of human
love and dignity we value, and
try to change our society with
out becoming hateful in the
process.
