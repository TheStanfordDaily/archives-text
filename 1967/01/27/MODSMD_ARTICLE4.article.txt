# BRITAIN II
## Poll Reveals Academic Weakness 
### GAIL ANDERSON SANDY SHAPIRO 
(Editor's Note: The following Is
based on a poll in which 42 of the 80
students in Britain II participated.)

"Unfortunately the academic pro
gram barely tapped the rich resources
available to us because of the com
mon language and the relatively small
size of England," stated one student in
a poll of the second Britain group.
Similar comments were made by
many of the 42 students who com
pleted the questionnaire. In general
they expressed greater satisfaction
with the cultural experience gained
from six months on the British Isles
than with the specific aspects of the
Harlaxton campus.
At Pubs
The majority of those polled said
they had contact with the British peo
ple "often "to "very often"—"at the
pubs, that is," qualified one student.
"There is as much opportunity as one
is willing to make," added another.
Some disagreed, however: "There
was very little chance to meet anyone
without considerable personal initia
tive." Several suggested having more
exchanges with nearby Nottingham
and Leicester universities.
"Students should be shoved out of
the campus to travel," emphasized one
participant. Those polled averaged
five to six trips per weekend and
spend around $850 including expenses
incurred during the three-week break.
When questioned about the field
trips to Edinburgh and Rome, 100 per
cent rated the Rome trip as more suc
cessful than the Scotland excursion,
despite the delay caused by the Flor
ence floods. Some noted the restric
tivencss of the group trips: "There are
too many conflicts—there's not enough
time for everything. They should be

cultural, otherwise an American Ex
press tour would do."
Academics
Thirty-six students said their grades
in England were about the same or
higher than those received on the
home campus, though many said they
did less work. The course load was
termed "just right" by almost all stu
dents, who would opt 14 to 15 units
as an ideal load.
More specific criticism of the curric
ulum was frequent. One student re
marked, "The courses were a joke—
really a colossal waste of time."
"The main problem both quarters,"
explained another, "was that none of
us knew what was happening." Many
felt that the courses on English his
tory, culture and technology were dis
organized, too broad, over-lapping, and
uninteresting.
Some suggested ways to improve
the academic situation. Several stu
dents proposed a prerequisite course
which would consist of directed his
tory reading and lectures on current
English politics to take the place of
the language courses required for
other campuses. This would allow Har
laxton classes to be more specialized.
Screen Profs
Other participants expressed the
need for screening the professors who
are sent to overseas campuses "with
particular regard to personality and
social amiability. Extra-curricular con
tact is as important as the brochure
says it is." One student added: "If
we are not offered a choice of courses,
the professors must be good."
In addition to academic criticism,
the food and the social regulations
received heavy censure. Only two of
those polled rated the meals better
than "poor." Several students felt
that the use of a catering service

should be discontinued so that the
administrators would have direct con
trol over hiring and firing the kitchen
staff.
Travel restrictions, open-house pol
icy, and liquor regulations were rated
almost unanimously as "too restric
tive." Many noted, however, that lack
of enforcement made the rules "more
livable."
More Understand big
Lest it seem the students were more
apt to complain than to act, one stu
dent explained: "I realize that this
group has complained extensively and
has been hesitant to act, but I feel
that too often we attempted to make
constructive suggestions and either
met a deaf ear or someone who said
'yes' and meant 'no.' I would urge
more of an attempt on administrators'

part to let students know their views
and their problems so that mutual
understanding could be approached."
Commenting on the overseas ex
perience, most students felt it had
value in spite of rather than because
of the academic situation. The pur
poses of foreign campuses most fre
quently mentioned were "appreciation
and understanding of another way of
life and personal development."
In response to the question, "Would
you chose Britain again?" 33 students
said they would, 7 replied negatively,
and 2 were uncertain. One student per
haps best summarized the six months
abroad as a chance to "achieve in
creased self knowledge through reac
tion to new situations, a small living
group, and detachment from Ameri
can security."
