# LASSU Asks Student Voice In Packer Comm Selection
## 
### SUZETTE LEITH 
Legislature last night voted to cir
culate a petition proposing that stu
dent members of the Packer Commit
tee on education be selected by a
committee of students and adminis
trators.
The petition labled the study "too
important a matter . . . for the selec
tion of committee members to be the
exclusive perogative of one segment
of (the University) community."
It proposed that two students and
two administrators "determine the
student members by consensus."
Appropriations
Also, $2500 was appropriated to the
ASSU Speech Association, and an ap
propriation was made to cover ex
penses for Dave Harris to travel to
Washington to participate in a con
ference on Vietnam with Dean Rusk
and other student body presidents.
An appropriation of $429 for a Cof
fee House was referred to the Finance
Committee.
Much controversy has developed

recently over procedure for selecting
student members of the Packer Com
mittee. As proposed by the Adminis
tration, students would be selected
by President Sterling.
LASSU last week proposed that
students themselves choose their rep
resentatives.
Speaker Tom Forstenzer reported
that he and other students had met
with Administrators throughout the
week in an effort to reach a compro
mise.
Consent â€”Not Veto
The students, he stated, proposed
a joint body of four to approve appli
cants by consent.
"Packer," he said, "took 'consent'
to mean veto power.'"
ASSU President Dave Harris stated
that "We have to fight for represen
tation."
"This is not a small power problem
of politics," Harris continued. "It con
cerns the whole problem of the way
people look at the University."
Various constituencies have differ
ent "world visions," Harris added, and
"for all his good intentions," Packer
would choose representatives "with
his view of the University."
Responsibility
Administrative Assistant Tim
Haight added that "an identification
of being appointed to the student
body" would create in members a
"feeling of responsibility to us."
In addition, the procedure of stu
dents appointing students has never
been recognized, Haight stated. "It is
a point of structure and principle."
The structure will be a "precedent
setter" and "model", added Harris.
"We must fight for the idea of a
community enterprise," Harris stated.
He opposed the idea that one part of

the University would run it and
"others would help run it."
It should at least be recognized that
the student body 'has a common in
terest ... a group identity," LASSU
Speaker Tom Forstenzer emphasized.
Packer, he claimed, hasn't answered
"why the students don't exist as an
entity."
"He wants to de-personalize the stu
dent body."
In addition to the petition, Harris
stated that students must "keep in
mind the possibility of boycotting the
study or of the Legislature not recog
nizing it."
Overruling
The Speech Appropriation was
passed after consideration of a ruling
that the motion was not in order.
The ruling was based on a section
of the by-laws providing that operat
ing budgets of ASSU-supported or
ganizations would not be extended
"save in the event of an extraordin
ary emergency." Legislature over
ruled the ruling.
The Speech Association had origin
ally requested an appropriation of
$4737.30. The figure was reduced by
eliminating one tournament and re
ducing the number of students to be
sent to various tournaments.
Seats Open
In addition, notice was given that
petitions are being accepted for ten
days for seats which are still open.
If no more petitions are received than
seats open, the petitioners will be
seated. If more are received, an
election will be held.
Open seats include off-campus un
dergraduates, three; business school,
four; earth sciences, one; education,
five; engineering, fourteen; humani
ties and sciences, twenty-two; and
medicine, three.
