# Grades Produce Frosh Trauma; Pressures Discourage Motivation
## 
### JAMES BRISCOE 
Stanford is rough on freshmen.
Students and faculty seem in sub
stantial agreement over this point.
Some students have never received
a grade lower than "A" before, one
professor points out, many others no
thing below a "B". All were at or near
the top of their class in high school
and accustomed to having their work
singled out for praise.
When one of these students gets a
"C-" on his first English paper, or
finds remarks like, "your facts are
wrong, your reasoning cloudy, your
development incoherent, and your
handwriting illegible," written on his
Civ midterm, the result is often
"trauma."
Outside Fields
Moreover, as the program at Stan
ford puts a fair portion of the gen
eral studies courses into the first
year, many students are pushed into
courses falling outside what they con

ceive to be their "fields of interest,"
yet strong pressures operate on them
to excel in all academic work. The re
sult some observers claim, is to de
velop an attitude of, "I'll learn it, but,
by God, I won't like it."
Professor Albert Guerard of the
English Department notes that a re
cent study of the motivation of Stan
ford freshmen showed that the most
common aim in the sciences and in
foreign langauge courses was to mas
ter the subject, and in the Freshman
Seminars to explore issues, whereas
the commonest aim in Western Civili
zation and Freshman English was to
do whatever is necessary to secure a
good grade.
To deal with these problems, and
to provide "a certain calm necessary
for education to take place" many have
proposed that no grades other than
"pass" or "fail" be given during the
freshman year.
Grading Pressures
Others, however, believe that grad
ing pressures are necessary and it
would be a disservice to the freshmen
to do away with grades. "Students
would not be getting a hard and fast
comparison of themselves with other
students without grades," Dr. Virgil
Whitaker maintains, "and students
need this kind of information. One of
the problems freshmen face is cor
recting the image of themselves as
students," he continues. "Most of
them come here bright eyed and full
of illusions."
Whitaker agreed that grades place
considerable pressure on freshmen
but suggests that such pressures
would only be postponed until the
second year if the first were graded
pass-fail.

Registrar Harvey Hall concurs that
"a time of decision must come," but
discounts the theory that students
would slack off during a pass-fail
freshman year. Reflecting that most
students who come to Stanford have
done well in secondary schools, he
notes, "study habits that students have
developed will not die so easily."
Most observers agree that grades
have definite functions in a university,
but some question whether or not
these uses obtain during the freshman
year. Graduate departments consider
mostly courses within the major field,
according to Dr. Gordon Craig of His
tory. "The freshman year grades are
relatively unimportant in this re
spect," he said.
A pass-fail freshman year, intro
duced at the California Institute of
Technology three years ago was made
permanent this year by a vote of the
faculty.
Ungraded Year
Communications graduate student
Tim Haight notes that, "As sopho
mores, the students who had partici
pated in the first ungraded freshman
year (at Cal Tech) made better grades
than the usual sophomore average.
Further, when the upperclassmen
were called to assess the interest, con
fidence and competence of the un
graded freshmen they replied that the
pass-fail students were more inter
ested and confident."
Discussion on the merits of a pass
fail first year continues at Stanford
in the Committee on Undergraduate
Education, and the Registrars Ad
visory Committee. The student legis
lature voted in favor of such a pro
gram fall quarter.

ford freshmen showed that the most
common aim in the sciences and in
foreign langauge courses was to mas
ter the subject, and in the Freshman
Seminars to explore issues, whereas
the commonest aim in Western Civili
zation and Freshman English was to
do whatever is necessary to secure a
good grade.
To deal with these problems, and
to provide "a certain calm necessary
for education to take place" many have
proposed that no grades other than
"pass" or "fail" be given during the
freshman year.
Grading Pressures
Others, however, believe that grad
ing pressures are necessary and it
would be a disservice to the freshmen
to do away with grades. "Students
would not be getting a hard and fast
comparison of themselves with other
students without grades," Dr. Virgil
Whitaker maintains, "and students
need this kind of information. One of
the problems freshmen face is cor
recting the image of themselves as
students," he continues. "Most of
them come here bright eyed and full
of illusions."
Whitaker agreed that grades place
considerable pressure on freshmen
but suggests that such pressures
would only be postponed until the
second year if the first were graded
pass-fail.

Registrar Harvey Hall concurs that
"a time of decision must come," but
discounts the theory that students
would slack off during a pass-fail
freshman year. Reflecting that most
students who come to Stanford have
done well in secondary schools, he
notes, "study habits that students have
developed will not die so easily."
Most observers agree that grades
have definite functions in a university,
but some question whether or not
these uses obtain during the freshman
year. Graduate departments consider
mostly courses within the major field,
according to Dr. Gordon Craig of His
tory. "The freshman year grades are
relatively unimportant in this re
spect," he said.

Ungraded Year
Communications graduate student
Tim Haight notes that, "As sopho
mores, the students who had partici
pated in the first ungraded freshman
year (at Cal Tech) made better grades
than the usual sophomore average.
Further, when the upperclassmen
were called to assess the interest, con
fidence and competence of the un
graded freshmen they replied that the
pass-fail students were more inter
ested and confident."
Discussion on the merits of a pass
fail first year continues at Stanford
in the Committee on Undergraduate
Education, and the Registrars Ad
visory Committee. The student legis
lature voted in favor of such a pro
gram fall quarter.
Stanford is rough on freshmen.
Students and faculty seem in sub
stantial agreement over this point.
Some students have never received
a grade lower than "A" before, one
professor points out, many others no
thing below a "B". All were at or near
the top of their class in high school
and accustomed to having their work
singled out for praise.
When one of these students gets a
"C-" on his first English paper, or
finds remarks like, "your facts are
wrong, your reasoning cloudy, your
development incoherent, and your
handwriting illegible," written on his
Civ midterm, the result is often
"trauma."
Outside Fields
Moreover, as the program at Stan
ford puts a fair portion of the gen
eral studies courses into the first
year, many students are pushed into
courses falling outside what they con

ceive to be their "fields of interest,"
yet strong pressures operate on them
to excel in all academic work. The re
sult some observers claim, is to de
velop an attitude of, "I'll learn it, but,
by God, I won't like it."
