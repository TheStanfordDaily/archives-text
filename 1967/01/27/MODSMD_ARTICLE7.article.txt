# Advocate Of 'Black Power' To Address FOCUS Series
## 
### 
Floyd McKissick, National Chairman
of the Congress on Racial Equality
(CORE) and well known Black Power
advocate will speak tomorrow after
noon on "The Implications of Negro
Political Power in the Cities."
The second program of the Political
Union's FOCUS Series on the Great
Society in America begins at 2:00 in
Memorial Auditorium.
McKissick, gained national atten
tion last spring during John Meridith's
march in Mississippi when he and
Stokely Carmichael of the Student
Non violent Coordinating Committee
(SNCC) adopted the Black Power slo
gan. Like Carmichael, McKissick rep
resented the more militant CORE
chapters from Northern cities which
have emphasized the need for greater
community consciousness and racial
pride as prerequisites for achieving
progress for the Negro.
This attitude prompted the resigna
tion of Lillian Smith from CORE and
initiated debates between Negro lead
ers representing "non-violent" and

"black power" philosophies. Dr. Mar
tin Luther King, Jr., is scheduled to
speak at Stanford next quarter.
After graduating from Moorehouse
College in Atlanta, Georgia, McKissick
became the first Negro graduate of the
University of North Carolina Law
School and has practiced in the Su
preme Court.
McKissick will be honored at an in
formal reception open to the campus
at the Lambda Nu house, 658 Lomita
Court, beginning at 12:30 p.m.
