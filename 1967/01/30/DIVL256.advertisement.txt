AVCO EVERETT
. . . only those who could appreciate an academic
climate that has the personal advantages of private
industry.
At Avco Everett, you'll be working in just such an environ
ment . . . one which places a premium on ideas . . .
where you'll be given all the freedom you need to do
significant research and publish papers . . . and you'll
be working with some of the most respected scientists
in aerospace research.
Our investigations range from high temperature gas dy
namics, plasma dynamics, aerophysics, atomic physics,
reentry physics, magnetohydrodynamics to low tempera
ture physics including superconductivity.
Avco Everett may not be for you. But if it is for you,
you're shortchanging yourself by not investigating further.
If you have an advanced degree and/or interest in one
of the above areas, please write Mr. Louis Rudzinsky.
