# Clergy Depart For Capitol Protest
## 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
Five members of the Stanford re
ligious community will enter the fore
front of Vietnam dissent tomorrow
in Washington D.C. as they join 2000
other clergy and laymen for a meet
ing of The National Emergency
Committee of Clergy and Laymen
Concerned about Vietnam.
The five are B. Davie Napier, Dean
of The Chapel; Robert McAfee Brown
and Michael Novak of the religion
department; and Stuart Mclean and
Richard Roe from the United Campus
Christian Ministry.
AH but Brown will be heading East
today along with William Sloane Cof
fin, organizer and leader of the

committee, who spent yesterday
preaching and talking at Stanford.
Brown is already in Washington
where he has been writing a state
ment the executive committee will
issue.
The committee is holding its meet
ing tomorrow and Wednesday be
cause, says Coffin, "This is a crucial
week. Now is the moment when the
war will head either to negotiations
or escalation." The committee hopes
it can help create a climate for nego
tiations.
Starts Tomorrow
The meeting will begin tomorrow
morning when Coffin chairs an as
semblage at which Brown will read
the executive committee statement.

This statement will be the keynote
of the conference. It will present what
Coffin describes as "realistic as well
as moral dissent to the war."
He explained that a solely moral
argument, which was accepted during
the Civil Rights movement, is consid
ered politically naive concerning the
war. The statement will thus include
a careful analysis and breakdown of
the war budget as part of its exam
ination of the conflict.
Of prime importance in the state
ment will be requests to the govern
ment to halt all bombing and to be
willing to talk with the National Lib
eration Front. To implement these
ideas it suggests an expanded use of
the International Control Commis
sion, a body which the N.L.F. trusts
and recognizes.
Only A Start
The statement, however, will be
only a part of the meeting. Those
gathered will be told how to contact
their congressmen and will then move
to the White House to hold a vigil
in the early afternoon.
Following this, the members will
speak to their congressmen and then
meet together again in the evening
for an interfaith service. Brown will
speak at this service. The group will
then disperse to spend the night in
hotels, homes, or on "free floor space"
in churches.
On Wednesday morning the group
will reconvene for a series of work
shops. In these workshops the mem
bers will be tutored on how to or
ganize anti-war movements in their
communities and in general how to
make Vietnam an issue at home.
Among the ideas to be suggested,
will be handing out the committee's
statement at services.
Concerned Clergy
Tomorrow's meeting marks the cli
max of long work by the Concerned

Clergy Committee. It was organized
last January during the long bomb
ing pause to organize community sup
port for President Johnson's peace
moves.
When the bombing was resumed,
the committee pressed forward on
three fronts. First, it continued to
help make the war an issue at home.
In this process, Coffin and other
founding members spent whole nights
on the phone talking to local priests,
ministers, and rabbis. As Mr. Coffin
said, "We took over The National
Council of Churches by night and
gave it back during the day." They
also paid for spot ads on radio and
circulated papers and letters.
On the second front they attempted
to keep in touch with congressmen
because the committee felt, and still
feels, that congressmen are in a bind.
If they don't see constituent support,
they are unable to move for peace.
Committee members thus tried to
keep Congress in touch with their
movement.
Contact NLF
Finally, the committee has attempt
ed to keep in contact with the North
Vietnamese and the N.L.F. Coffin
explained how he and others have
talked with them in Paris and phoned
them in Pragua He emphasized that
the committee was not negotiating,
but rather was trying to keep them
appraised of developments in the U.S.
For instance, Coffin described how he
warned the N.L.F. and the North
Vietnamese not to be deceived into
thinking the U.S. would pull out be
cause there were elements of opposi
tion at home.
He also said that the committee
had told the N.L.F. it must offer to
negotiate if the bombing is halted.
