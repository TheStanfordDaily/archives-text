WASHINGTON, D.C., (CPS)â€”
Alienation is not a major com
plaint of students at large uni
versities, according to a recent
survey by the National Associa
tion of State Universities and
Land-Grant Colleges (NASUL
GC).
In a poll of 100 students taken
by NASULGC's Office of Institu
tional Research, most sudents
said that it was possible to cope
with their schools' bureaucracies
and to establish meaningful cam
pus friendships.
The students answering the
questionnaire ranged from fresh
men to graduate students, and
their grade point averages varied
from the honor level to near
failing.
Many students reported that
they were overwhelmed at first
by the size of their universities,
but once they became accus
tomed to campus life, most easily
found friends among students
and faculty.
Only a few students com

plained about depersonalization
and alienation.
Among the advantages of size
cited were the opportunities to
meet a wide variety of people, to
confront many divergent ideas,
and to choose from an extensive
array of academic and extra-cur
ricular programs.
A number of students said
that shy and retiring individuals
might not be able to cope with
campus bigness while more out
going and aggressive students
would adjust with relative ease.
The responses to the OIR ques
tionnaire confirmed the findings
of a survey resported last Feb
ruary in Changing Times maga
zine. Based on questionnaire re
sponses from 400 student leaders
attending the 1965 annual meet
ing of the U.S. National Stu
dent Association, the Changing
Times survey concluded that
"most striking is the strong
evidence that bigness doesn't
matter anywhere near as much
as people think.
