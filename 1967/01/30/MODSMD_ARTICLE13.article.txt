# Yale's President Describes Myths Of College Admission
## 
### 
For each student admitted to
Yale, there is at least one other,
not admitted, who is "arguably
as good." What makes the dif
ference in the selection? And
Why? The Yale Alumni Maga
zine has devoted a recent issue
to the controversial subject in
an attempt to clear away the
dust.
At Yale there are some 6,000
applicants from which a fresh
man class of 1,025 is picked. The
anxiety of the student —and his
parents and teachers — while

waiting for a decision is matches,
by the deep concern felt by th<
college officials who must decide
The task, according to Presi
dent Kingman Brewster, Jr., "ir
evitably involves a series i
frightfully difficult and esser
tially moral decisions"; in man
cases it is the "intangibles tha
provide the feather's weight 01
the scales." The admissions pol
icy at Yale has no "double stan
dards," he emphasizes. "We ar
trying, deliberately, to make i y
clear to students everywhere
that we hope there are no b£
riers — barriers of inheritance
barriers of race, barriers of pock
etbook—to Yale admissions fo
those deserving of the Yale privi

Myths
There are at least three myth
that must be dispelled, accor

of the academic quality of al
those who apply. . . .
The second myth "is that w<
are against athletics. Contra*
to the myth, athletic accomplis
ment and athletic interest at
explicitly relevant. Exception
distinction in athletics . . . dt
serves the same kind of recogni
tion that truly outstanding
achievement in other forms o
creative non-curricular activit
obviously deserves," he said.
No Double Standard
But, he added, "Yale refuse,
to permit a double standard foi
the admission of athletes a 1
though they would be admittec
as less good students becaur
they are great as athletes."
The third myth, Presiden
Brewster said, "is perhaps mc •
widespread at the present mc
ment: that Yale and the Admis
sions Committee and the admis
sions process is somehow riggec
against the eestablished indeper
dent schools."
President Brewster went on t
explain that the drop in the nu:
ber of Yale students from privat
schools in recent years was als<
due to the fact that "most pub

schools in particular, have vas*
