# Savio Works While Berkeley Waits
## 
### HAROLD Y. STREETER Associated Press Writer 
(Editor's Note —He Isn't a student at
Berkeley now, but he's still a big man
on campus. To many a young fire
brand at the huge University, Mario
Savio remains a persuasive and fear
less spokesman for students' rights. Oth
ers view him as a troublemaker. Here's
a closeup of an activist who has spe
cialized In keeping things stirred up.)

BERKELEY, Calif. Jan. 28—A big
man on the University of California's
Berkeley campus is a part time bar
tender at the Steppenwolf Tavern. Gov.
Ronald Reagan may never have heard
of the Steppenwolf, but he has heard
of the bartender.
And the bartender may soon be
heard again.
At the Steppenwolf, the music is loud,
the dancers are jerky, and the beer is
served in big pitchers.
The bar's muddy brown walls, brok
en by white lime where chipped plaster
has created an inadvertent abstract
pattern, shut in a little world of the
young and restless left seat on San
Pablo Avenue in West Berkeley.
Strange paintings, such as one of
Bette Davis riding a Model T Roadster
past an orange-colored mushroom cloud,
dot the walls. So do scrawled chalk
signs: "Get the U.S. out of Vietnam"
and "Get the U.S. out of Berkeley."
A Protesting Bartender
Crowding the dance floor are bearded
young men in wrinkled clothing; also
the dapper and well dressed; wan, skin
ny girls; also husky girls bulging, in
ribbed sweaters.
On occasional weekends, one bar
tender is a most familiar figure—6-foot
1, slender, bushy-haired Mario Savio, 24,
whose protests have made thunderous
impact on the Berkeley community.
As a philosophy major, in 1964, he
lashed out at rules barring campus fund
collections for Civil Rights, helped top
ple a Chancellor and sparked nearly
800 mass arrests.
As a non-student, barred from school
for deliberately violating campus rules,
Savio helped whip up a furor over

Navy recruiting at the s t udent union
last November. For that demonstration,
Savio and four other non sl udents were
convicted last Saturday o:f creating a
public nuisance, but immediately filed
notice of appeal.
What's Next?'
Tending bar is only an interlude in
Savio's career, just a means of sup
porting his wife, the former Suzanne
Goldberg, and their 1-year old son.
Those who know his potential ask,
"What's next?"
Savio isn't saying publicly.
A reporter drove to £>a vio's apart
ment, a first floor affair with a motor
scooter parked out front, and rang the
doorbell.
"Wait a minute," a voice called out
over the crying of a baby.
Then Savio opened the d oor. He was
wearing, at 11 a.m., a long, flowing
bathrobe and was barefooted.
The reporter introduced himself.
Cocking his head to one side—his
plentiful hair in unusual disarray—
Savio said:
"You are from the Associated Press,
right?
"And you wish an interview, right?
"About myself?
"The answer is no."
And he quietly shut the door.
Fear Of Exaggerat ion
Trying to explain Savio '.«s reluctance
to talk with reporters, a friend, Tom
Erwin, said:
"In the past he has been called an
agitator and a rebel. He also feels that
any interview would tend to exaggerate
the importance of the individual over
the cause."
But the power of Savio' s influence,
whatever he may be planning, is at
tested by his former philosophy pro
fessor, John Searles.
"He's a pretty complica ted person,"
Searles says.
.- "Very intelligent. Yes, he has been a
problem in the past. But lie was one
of the leaders of the Speech
Movement, which did th e university
a great deal of good.
"Now there are more guarantees of

free speech. There has been created a
campus community which is more live
ly. There is more academic freedom."
Kerr And Reagan
Today's big question is the likelihood
of any new demonstrations and what
the repercussions would be. Presently
there is an atmoshpere of tense ex
pectancy on the Berkeley campus.
California's new Governor, Repub
lican Ronald Reagan, supports a full
scale investigation of the University's
troubles. He has said that anyone who
doesn't like the campus rules should
go elsewhere. Reagan also favors in
troducing tuition, a move opposed by
many of the students.
The University President, Clark Kerr,
also was against tuition, and equally
against what Reagan had said was the
only alternative, cutting the Univer
sity's budget. Last Friday, Kerr was
fired by the Board of Regents, by a
vote of 14 to 8. Gov. Reagan was among
those voting against him.
Physics Too Easy
Just who is Mario Savio? What
makes him tick?
He is a brain; he found college
physics so easy he gave it up.
He is very articulate; what he says,
and the way he says it, have galvanized
hearers into action.
He is an 'activist." He has gone to
jail and been beaten up for doing what
he believes in.
Savio was graduated in 1959 at the
head of his class of 1,200 at Martin
Van Buren high school, in Queens Vil
lage, N.Y.
He went to Manhattan College on a
scholarship until 1961. Majoring in
math and physics, he got straight A's.
In addition to finding physics too easy,
he felt that the New York City school,
operated by the Christian Brothers, was
too parochial. He transferred in 1961 to
Queens College in Flushing, N.Y.
When Savio followed his parents
West in 1963, he brought to the Uni
versity of California an average grade
of 3.9 out of a possible 4.
On an October day in 1964, Savio
climbed atop a campus police car at

Berkeley and made a speech. Inside
was a nonstudent, arrested for violating
campus rules against political activity.
Then under suspension with seven
others for breaking campus rules, Savio
said:
"Chancellor (Edward) Strong must
say no to the suspensions.
"And I'm publicly serving notice that
we're going to continue direct action
until they accede."
Signal Action
The suspensions stuck, but the crisis
forced Strong's retirement; brought
President Kerr into conference with
leaders of a student Free Speech Move
ment; resulted in rule changes.
The way Savio's words got translated
into action was exemplified on Dec. 2,
1964, during a massive sit-in at Sproul
Hall, the administration building, over
the campus rules fuss.
"The administration wants you to
walk by like a machine," Savio said.
Overnight, students started wearing
punched cards on coats and dresses by
way of saying an individual's personal
ity can be swallowed up by a com
puterized existence.
After the new Berkeley chancellor,
Roger Heyns, broke up a class boy
cott over the November recruiting up
roar and refused to consult Savio, the
campus influence of the non-student pro
testor was made evident.
Savio still has one sentence hanging
over him for the Sproul Hall sit-in, now
under appeal, in addition to last week's
conviction in connection with the re
cruiting melee.
An Organizing Force
What's in his future?
Says an authoriative spokesman on
the Berkeley campus:
"Savio is a forceful speaker. With
his voice, the Free Speech Movement
drew a lot of support, both student and
faculty. Without it, the FSM died. With
out it, the Free Student Union never got
off the floor. Without it, the Vietnam
Day Committee managed a few protest
parades and then faded.
"You just don't encounter a voice like
Savio's very often."
