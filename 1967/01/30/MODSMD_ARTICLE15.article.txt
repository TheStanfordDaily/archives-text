# Draft Ranking System Rankles CCNY Students
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, D.C., (CPS) —
New York City's Board of High
er Education has rejected stu
dent-faculty demands that City
College of New York (CCNY)
cease compiling class rankings
for local draft boards.
But the Board's decision, which
came in the face of an over
whelming student-faculty vote
against CCNY cooperation with
the Selective Service System, will
bo fought by the student gov
ernment, according to SG Presi
dent Shelley Sachs.
(Stanford's National Service
Office will send a student's
grades and class rank to his local
board only if he gives the office
written instruction to do so,
according to Walter J. Findeisen,
National Service advisor.)
Students Have No Voice
The Board said that to with
hold class ranks would discrim-
Vnate against students who want
their grades sent to draft boards.
Sachs charged in response that
the BHE resolution was "aca
demically indefensible" and "de
stroys the principle of student
oarticipation in decision-mak
ing."
Several students contended

that the BHE passed the resolu
tion announced during Christ
mas recess ,to save CCNY Pres
ident Buell Gallagher from mak
ing a decision on the issue.
A 'Misquoted Smear'
Gallagher had previously
fought with students over the
ranking issue when protesters at
a November sit-in demanded that
the referendum results be made
binding on the administration.
Gallagher was quoted as say
ing that the sit-in was Commu
nist dominated.
Although he later charged that
he had been misquoted, students

sl:£iged a week-long sit-in to pro
test what they called the Presi
dent's "smear" tactics and to re
po at their demands.
' The recent BHE resolution,
which is binding on all the insti
tutions of the City University
system, came just two weeks
after students at Brooklyn Col
log-e voted, by a narrow margin,
to support the existing policy.
Majority Rules
Of the 3221 ballots cast, rep
resenting approximately two
third of the student body, 1508
students voted to cease ranking
computation, 1594 supported the

present system of submitting
rank at a student's request, and
76 voted for submission of all
male students' class rankings.
Columbia Decision
The ranking issue is also be
ing debated at Columbia College
in New York, where faculty
members voted overwhelmingly
last weekend against issuing stu
dent standings to the Selective
Service boards.
Present university policy di
rects the registrar not to re
lease ranks to local draft boards
except upon a student's request.
David Truman, dean of Co

lumbia College, said he sup
ported the change because the
use of grades in determining
Selective Service status is "an in
trusion into the relation between
students and faculty" and causes
"corruption, distortion, and dis
ruption of the teaching process."
If the board of trustees ap
proves the faculty's proposal, Co
lumbia will become the fourth
college, after Haverford in Penn
sylvania, Wayne State Univer
sity in Detroit and Antioch Col
lege in Ohio, to refuse to release
ranking information to draft
boards.

The ranking issue is also be
ing debated at Columbia College
in New York, where faculty
members voted overwhelmingly
last weekend against issuing stu
dent standings to the Selective
Service boards.
Present university policy di
rects the registrar not to re
lease ranks to local draft boards
except upon a student's request.
David Truman, dean of Co

lumbia College, said he sup
ported the change because the
use of grades in determining
Selective Service status is "an in
trusion into the relation between
students and faculty" and causes
"corruption, distortion, and dis
ruption of the teaching process."
If the board of trustees ap
proves the faculty's proposal, Co
lumbia will become the fourth
college, after Haverford in Penn
sylvania, Wayne State Univer
sity in Detroit and Antioch Col
lege in Ohio, to refuse to release
ranking information to draft
boards.
WASHINGTON, D.C., (CPS) —
New York City's Board of High
er Education has rejected stu
dent-faculty demands that City
College of New York (CCNY)
cease compiling class rankings
for local draft boards.
But the Board's decision, which
came in the face of an over
whelming student-faculty vote
against CCNY cooperation with
the Selective Service System, will
bo fought by the student gov
ernment, according to SG Presi
dent Shelley Sachs.
(Stanford's National Service
Office will send a student's
grades and class rank to his local
board only if he gives the office
written instruction to do so,
according to Walter J. Findeisen,
National Service advisor.)
Students Have No Voice
The Board said that to with
hold class ranks would discrim-
Vnate against students who want
their grades sent to draft boards.
Sachs charged in response that
the BHE resolution was "aca
demically indefensible" and "de
stroys the principle of student
oarticipation in decision-mak
ing."
Several students contended

that the BHE passed the resolu
tion announced during Christ
mas recess ,to save CCNY Pres
ident Buell Gallagher from mak
ing a decision on the issue.
A 'Misquoted Smear'
Gallagher had previously
fought with students over the
ranking issue when protesters at
a November sit-in demanded that
the referendum results be made
binding on the administration.
Gallagher was quoted as say
ing that the sit-in was Commu
nist dominated.
Although he later charged that
he had been misquoted, students

sl:£iged a week-long sit-in to pro
test what they called the Presi
dent's "smear" tactics and to re
po at their demands.
' The recent BHE resolution,
which is binding on all the insti
tutions of the City University
system, came just two weeks
after students at Brooklyn Col
log-e voted, by a narrow margin,
to support the existing policy.
Majority Rules
Of the 3221 ballots cast, rep
resenting approximately two
third of the student body, 1508
students voted to cease ranking
computation, 1594 supported the

present system of submitting
rank at a student's request, and
76 voted for submission of all
male students' class rankings.
