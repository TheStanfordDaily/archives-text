# Swimmers Set National Relay Mark
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER Sports Editor 
Stanford swimmers left the
Encina pool deck cluttered with
shattered records last weekend.
Dick Roth, Greg Buckingham,
Mark Parmely, and Luis Nicolao
smashed the NCAA and AAU
National record for the 800 free
style relay by 1.2 seconds, tear
ing up the course in 7:01.4.
Buckingham's 4:45.2 pool and
varsity record for 500 freestyle
highlighted the Indians' 88-18 axe
job on Cal on Friday. Saturday,
the Stanford Relays appeared
doomed by the weatherman.
The rain let up just before
the meet, graciously enough, but
the deluge had hardly begun.
Every meet record, ten in
all, went gurgling down the
drain, each broken by at least 2
seconds.

Stanford got six of the meet
records and packed away the
meet with 78 points to Santa
Clara Swim Club's 64 and Foot
hill Aquatic Club's 57. Cal, San
Jose, and the Stanford frosh
finished far back. Last year,
Stanford, the Stanford frosh, and
Santa Clara tied for first.
Dick Roth led off the 800 free
relay with a 1:45.8 for the first

200 leg. Buckingham took off
next and never hit the water. He
flew to a 1:43.3 split that put the
record on ice. Parmely followed
with a 1:46.1, his best 200 ever,
and Nicolao brought it home
with a 1:46.2 anchor leg.
Stanford hopes to knock still
another 10 seconds off that rec
ord in the NCAA championships.
Buckingham's 4:45.2 for the

500 freestyle against Cal is the
nation's fastest time for that
event so far this season, by a
full three seconds. Buckingham
holds the national record of
4:41.1. Buckingham hit 51.4 for
a butterfly relay split against
Cal, and in the Relays, swam 54.2
for 100 IM and 47.8 for the 100
freestyle.
Bob Momsen set a new pool
record for the 100 breaststroke,
1:03.0, leading off the 300 breast
stroke relay Saturday. Momsen,
who took second in the NCAA's
last year with a 2:14.8 in the
200 breast, swam a 2:16.4 against
Cal.
Pete Siebert hit 2:00.5 for the
200 individual medley against
Cal. That time puts him among
the top three IM men in the
country. Siebert's 54.9 anchor leg
in the 300 backstroke relay com

plemented Bill Kee's lead-off 55.7
and Bob Hart's 56.2 for a mew
meet record.
Morgan Manning, whose 48.1
100 freesstyle split in the Re: lays
bodes well for the NCAA's, also
demonstrated rare versatility for
a freestyle sprinter. Manning
hit 1:02.2 for his 100 breastst r oke
leg in Stanford's most record
setting 300 breaststroke rela;/.
Santa Clara's 400 medley rt;lay
and Stanford locked horns in per
haps the best race of the day.
Mitch Ivey and Jack Fau nee,
probably the nation's best htigh
school backstroker and breast
stroker, gave Santa Clara an
early lead.
Nicolao could not gain ground
on Mark Spitz, who won the 100
fly in the nationals last year.
Don Roth, NCAA 100 frees tyle
champion, held his lead against

Buickingham in the anchor leg.
Frosh Finish Sixth
The Stanford frosh finished
in sixth place, but came up with
a number of bright spots in the
Relays. Richie Williams, Jim
NickolofT, and Nick Donero took
fourth in the 300 individual med
ley relay with a 2:55.8, .3 sec
ond out of third.
Bill Main, diving by himself
against the other teams that had
2 men going in the diving "re
lay," took fourth with a 262.75
total.
Williams, NickolofT, Donero,
and Main carried the biggest
burden for the frosh against the
Cal frosh, but fell short of the
Cubs, 54-50.
