# Coffin: Concern—Then Hope
## 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
When he starts talking about cam
pus ministries as 'floating crap
games" and describes past Stanford
students as being "as wholesome as
a head of Salinas lettuce" you know
it's got to be William Sloane Coffin
speaking.
But that's just a part of what Cof
fin said yesterday at Stanford. The
Yale Chaplain touched on many sub
jects, all having two things in com
mon—concern for the present, and
hope for the future.
From the minute he walked off his
United Airlines jet on Saturday eve
ning dressed in a turtle neck and blue
blazer, he was bubbling over with pro
gressive theories and thoughts.
"Students are the most alive sector
of the American population," he said
over breakfast. "If enough of them
come alive, things can change in the
country."
Campus In Past
He then outlined two areas in which
students must take interest. "Foreign
policy is a crucial subject. Americans

are conservative because they have a
lot to conserve. But we've got to get
involved." Pointing his remarks to
Stanford's Overseas Campuses, Coffin
said, "They're located in the past
rather than the future. Students
should be going to Latin America and
Africa, not Europe. Students have to
be concerned with the conjunction of
the present with the future, not J;he
past with the present."
On the domestic scene he talked of
the need for students to get "tied in
with the problems of urban poor."
He said that violence in the cities to
date has been token, but if changes
aren't made, "Someone may blow up
a transportation system or there may
be a real insurrection."
As he sipped a cup of coffee in
Tresidder, Coffin explained, "Repres
sive violence feeds the desperation that
produced it in the first place so that it
guarantees safety at the expense of
human purposes."
Sophisticated Renewal
On this subject, he suggested that
a more sophisticated type of urban
renewal be devised so that "we're not
just pouring cement on people." He
continued, "Our problem is not to get
the people out of slums, but get the
slums out of the people." In conclusion
he remarked that if students don't
begin to understand these problems,
they will become part of the problem.
The Chaplain, who is now in his
eighth year at Yale, emphasized how
much power students have. He noted
I'ia*. Dea.i I-n.> . jo, t . 1.0 ,
open letter from students protesting
the war by answering with a six page
letter and inviting them to come talk
with him. "And never forget," said
Coffin, "that President Johnson is very
aware that he can lose a lot of sup
port to Bobby Kennedy among the
students."
Turning his attention to religion
at. universities, Coffin explained what
he meant by the campus ministry be
ing "a floating crap game." He said,
"We've got to get up every morning
and ask where the action is. We've
got to find out how we can help stu
dents and get campus groups stimu
lated. As Paul Goodman says, we've
got to get students 'confused in a
creative way.' "

Continuing on religion, Coffin pre
dicted there will be a new religious
movement on campuses stimulated
"by students who are sensitive to the
importance of doing things in con
text in the world." He said, "Pretty
soon the Protestant ethic will have to
go because there'll be machines to do
everything. Animals will be able to do
animal work, machines will be able to
do machine work, and human beings
will be free to do human work. But
what is human work? Those who un
derstand will spearhead this new re
ligious movement."
Coffin also predicted that those who
do "will find Jesus a really captivating
person." He noted that from a reli
gious point of view, "The present
is conditioned by the future more than
the past."
By now William Sloane Coffin is in
Washington, D.C., leading a meeting
of clergy and laymen protesting the
war in Vietnam. He was only here foi
a day, but he left behind him a myriad
of ideas.
And he also said, "That Salinas
lettuce is no longer around."
