Sharp shooting, even scoring
and a second half rush all added

Art Harris led all scorers with
22 points. He was strongly sup
ported by Gary Petersmeyer
with 19, Don Griffin, 18, and
Howard Hassen, 14.

a 4140 halftime lead. However,
co-captain Hassen poured In
eight points in the first four
minutes of the second half to
spark the Cards.
Santa Clara pulled away to a
fast 5-0 lead as the Indians
couldn't find the basket. Finally

Hassen broke the ice with a free
throw, followed by an 18 foot
jump shot by Griffln.
See-Saw Battle
From there, the first half was
a see-saw battle, with the great
est lead being a five point bulge.
Sophomore center Bud Ogden
carried the Broncos for the en
tire first half on lay-ins and
short jumpers.
One Man Show
A one man show by guard
Gary Petersmeyer climaxed the
half. He scored on a spectacular
driving lay-up with 26 seconds
left to give Stanford a 39-38
lead. After a Bronco bucket,
Petersmeyer scored again on an
18 foot jumper with 5 seconds

dominated the second half as all
members of the team scored
well. After six minutes of action,
Stanford had pulled away to a
nine point lead, never to be chal
lenged again.
The second half of play was
marked by much wilder action
than the first. At one point the
ball was sailing back and forth
from one end of the court to the
other as both teams used the
fast break as their only offense.
Cards Open Up Lead
The Indians settled the pace
back down, though, and scored
on short jumpers and lay-ups
to open the lead up to 17 at one
point.

second half as he was held to
only five points. He ended up
Santa Clara's high point man
for the game with 21 points.

Clara's baskets came on close-in

shots by 6-9 center Dennis Awtry
and 6-5 forward Ralph Ogden.

the game with 23.

the punch for the Cards as he
poured in 22 points from all over
the court. Steve Kuchenbeeker
pulled down 12 rebounds for
the Indians.
