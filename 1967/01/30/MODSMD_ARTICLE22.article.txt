# Grace Leads Cards Over Piedmont Gap
## 
### JOHN MERRILL 
The Stanford ruggers, again
led by Mike Grace, remained un
defeated Saturday, defeating
Piedmont (formerly Peacocke)
Gap Rugby Club, 14-8.
Grace scored eight points on
two penalty kicks and one con
version and turned in some fine
field play in this, the third vic
tory of the young season for the
Card ruggers.
Piedmont got the opening
score, on a 25 yard penalty kick,
but the score was soon tied as
Grace also booted a three-point
er.
Sutcliffe Spectacle
Stanford bounced into the lead
with a strong backfield rush that
found Eric Sutcliffe taking the
ball over after a 30 yard jaunt
through most of the Piedmont
team.
The backfield swung left at
first, then came back right to
catch the opposing backs a little
out of place. Sutcliffe then went
between two players, and around
another to score.
Grace's conversion gave the
Cards the lead at 8-3 and they
were never headed after that.
Another penalty kick by Grace
gave Stanford an 11-3 halfttime
advantage.
Sutcliffe got his second try of
the day early in the second half
when he took a bouncing pass
from Grace and went in to score.
Sutcliffe barely eluded the grasp
of former Stanford footballer
and rugger Tim Hansel, now
graduated and playing for Pied
mont.
Piedmont capitalized on a dis
puted decision regarding a drop
out deep in Stanford territory

and scored a try to make the
score 14-8. However the con
version attempt was no good
and there was no further scor
ing by either team.
The latter part of the game
saw a good scrum battle with
neither side consistently get
ting the advantage. Stanford ap
peared to have the stronger
backfield attack, with Lionel
Hartvickson turning in a fine
performance at wing.
Peter Hogg and Robby Nimmo
played a strong game for the
Indians. Mike White, of the Stan
ford varsity football coaching
staff, played well on defense for
the Piedmont Gap Club.
Olympic Test Next
Next Week the Indians play
the San Francisco Olympic Club
at Stanford. The Olympics de
feated this same Piedmont team
20-0 last week and should pro
vide the first stiff test of the
sason for the Card ruggers.
Coach Pete Kmetovic was
pleased with the win and pre
dicted the team would be at full
strength for next week's game.

staff, played well on defense for
the Piedmont Gap Club.
Olympic Test Next
Next Week the Indians play
the San Francisco Olympic Club
at Stanford. The Olympics de
feated this same Piedmont team
20-0 last week and should pro
vide the first stiff test of the
sason for the Card ruggers.
Coach Pete Kmetovic was
pleased with the win and pre
dicted the team would be at full
strength for next week's game.
The Stanford ruggers, again
led by Mike Grace, remained un
defeated Saturday, defeating
Piedmont (formerly Peacocke)
Gap Rugby Club, 14-8.
Grace scored eight points on
two penalty kicks and one con
version and turned in some fine
field play in this, the third vic
tory of the young season for the
Card ruggers.
Piedmont got the opening
score, on a 25 yard penalty kick,
but the score was soon tied as
Grace also booted a three-point
er.
Sutcliffe Spectacle
Stanford bounced into the lead
with a strong backfield rush that
found Eric Sutcliffe taking the
ball over after a 30 yard jaunt
through most of the Piedmont
team.
The backfield swung left at
first, then came back right to
catch the opposing backs a little
out of place. Sutcliffe then went
between two players, and around
another to score.
Grace's conversion gave the
Cards the lead at 8-3 and they
were never headed after that.
Another penalty kick by Grace
gave Stanford an 11-3 halfttime
advantage.
Sutcliffe got his second try of
the day early in the second half
when he took a bouncing pass
from Grace and went in to score.
Sutcliffe barely eluded the grasp
of former Stanford footballer
and rugger Tim Hansel, now
graduated and playing for Pied
mont.
Piedmont capitalized on a dis
puted decision regarding a drop
out deep in Stanford territory

and scored a try to make the
score 14-8. However the con
version attempt was no good
and there was no further scor
ing by either team.
The latter part of the game
saw a good scrum battle with
neither side consistently get
ting the advantage. Stanford ap
peared to have the stronger
backfield attack, with Lionel
Hartvickson turning in a fine
performance at wing.
Peter Hogg and Robby Nimmo
played a strong game for the
Indians. Mike White, of the Stan
ford varsity football coaching
staff, played well on defense for
the Piedmont Gap Club.
