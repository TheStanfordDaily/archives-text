# The 						Daily Philosophy
## 
### 
The great principle of freedom, of the press
should operate just as strongly on campus as
elsewhere.
J. E. Wallace Sterling
(February 8, 1957, The Stanford Daily)
The role of The Daily in this community has
always been a source of misunderstanding. We
think it appropriate to begin this new volume
with a statement of the philosophy we intend
to follow.
We believe The Daily is a newspaper in the
best traditions of independent journalism and
that its aims and goals are those of free news
papers everywhere. We believe one of The
Daily's primary responsibilities is to inform, to
give a thorough and accurate presentation of
the news. The news, as we see it, consists not
only of "events of significant social import," but
also of those satisfying only the requirement
of being "something of interest to someone."
In other words, we will continue to take seri
ously our "bulletin board*' function. But The
Daily must do more if it is to be a neu>6paper.
It must, in Thomas Storke's words, "publish
the news that Ls public property without fear
or favor of friend or foe."
The Daily must open people's minds to the
problems around them; it must present a wide
spectrum of views, and finally, it must take
honest and responsible stands on the major
issues that we at Stanford have to face. In
short, The Daily must be more than a house
organ; it must be a voice on this campus, al
ways ready to question, to criticize, or to praise.
We also believe in what has been termed
the "public conscience" or "gadfly" responsibil
ity of a newspaper. Too often we are told we
have no business knowing and reporting what
is taking place behind closed doors. We believe

the University will function better when people
appreciate that acceptance of a decision hinges
more on its merits than on its presentation as a
fait accompli. The recent ill-fated faculty
master plan is a case in point.
We hope in this connection that certain
branches of the administration as well as of the
student government will reconsider their para
noia of The Daily and realize that we are more
than yellow journalists looking for hot scoops;
instead, we hope they will understand that we,
too, feel a deep commitment to this University.
Some people suggest The Daily should mimi
mize its coverage of problems at Stanford. We
feel the fact that something is wrong is news
in itself and that we often perform a valuable
service in exposing an issue that otherwise
would be ignored. Our intention here is to stim
ulate constructive thought, hopefully paving the
way for a satisfactory solution.
The editorial page will continue to serve as
a forum for all opinions, both solicited and un
solicited. The concept of the editorial has
been changed to increase its responsibility and
credibility. Instead of representing only the
Editor's views, as has been the case in the past,
it will reflect the opinion of The Daily, as de
termined by the Editorial Board. Dissenting
opinions on the Editorial Board will also be
heard.
The Daily is the major channel available for
communication on this campus. We recognize
the responsibilities involved and intend to fulfill
them without compromising our integrity to
anyone. We will not be a podium for anyone's
crusades, nor will we be a public relations
organ. We will publish the news that we con
sider public property and extend a challenge
to the community to cooperate with us in
achieving our goal.
