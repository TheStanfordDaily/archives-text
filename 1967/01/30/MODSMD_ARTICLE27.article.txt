## Save On High Cost Of Killing 
### Art Buchwald 
Everyone knows the Viet war
is costly, but no one realized how
costly, until the Washington
Post revealed that it costs
$332,000 to kill one Viet Cong.
The writer arrived at his figure
by taking the monthly average of
enemy killed and dividing it by
the monthly cost of the war,
which now seems to be running
at a rate of $1.7 billion.
If these figures are correct, it
would take $332 million to kill
1,000 of the enemy, and even if
we found a division of North
Vietnamese soldiers we wouldn't
have the funds to destroy it.
It is obvious that if we want
to have both guns and butter in

1967 we're going to have to cut
down the cost of knocking off
the Viet Cong.
The Auto Bomb
It has been proposed that in
stead of bombs, American planes
drop new automobiles that have
been called in for defects on the
suburbs of Hanoi. Once enough
cars have been dropped, the
North Vietnamese would pro
ceed to kill each other on their
own highways (providing we
don't destroy the highways). The
main value of this plan, besides
eliminating the enemy, is that it
would solve the problem of what
the United States should do with
its unsafe cars.
Another project that is be
ing given close study is to drop
pamphlets on North Vietnam
and Viet Cong zones offering
anyone who deserts to our side
a $25,000 home, free education
for his children, color television

and a paid-up membership in
the country club of his choice.
Cheap Victory
This would come to far less
than $322,000 and would certain
ly be a great propaganda victory
for our side.
If the Viet Cong deserter pre
fers, we could give him a num
bered bank account in Switzer
land so Ho Chi Minh would
never find out about it.
Still another suggestion is
that the United States build
American-type factories all
along the North-South Vietnam
border. The smoke from the fac
tories, with the help of a prevail
ing southeasterly wind, would
pollute the air of North Vietnam
and the Communists would
slowly expire. It might take a
little longer than other methods
of eliminating the enemy, but
the factories could be making
war materials, so all the effort

would not be wasted.
Syndicate Wipe Out
No idea is too far-fetched in
time of war, and one that is also
being considered has to do with
giving out "contracts"' to certain
people in the American under
world. The going rate in the un
derworld to wipe out somebody
is $25,000.
The idea would be for the
United States to let private en
terprise take over the elimina
tion of our Viet Cong friends.
The reason why a solution to
the problem has to be found fast
is that the present cost of fight
ing the enemy we really can't
afford to wipe them out. As a
matter of fact, the less Viet
Cong we kill, the more money
we save and the stronger our
economy will be to fight the
war.
