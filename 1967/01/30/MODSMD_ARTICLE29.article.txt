# Letters To The Editor
## Creeping Education Poses Threat To Camaraderie 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Concerning Carl Mundt's dis
cussion of fraternities and liv
ing groups in the January 26
Daily, might he not at least
have considered that the idiot
business of converting campus
residence houses into road show
lecture halls under the guise
of a "merger between social
and academic" life frankly
threatens our absolutely last en
claves of reasonably sane, ma
ture human society?
When and if this swindle and
betrayal comes to pass, the only
possible refuge from the Quad's
academic quackery, dishonesty
arid humbug generally will be
the bubbly green bottom of
Lake Lagunita.
The three basic requirements
for campus residences to which
students may reasonably be ex
pected to retire after a full day
on the Quad are: congenial com
pany of one's own choosing, a
good-sized host of sympathetic
listeners, and plenty of good
Bourbon. CLAY L. MILLER
• Expose
Editor, The Daily:
This is to protest the serious
infringement upon my privacy
perpetrated by your worthy
journal in the story "Hilgard
Heads Nat'l Study of Social
Science" (January 25). Through
the years I have been at Stan

ford, I have successfully pro
tected my anonymity.
But now that my real name
has been unmasked, I fear the
worst —lines of students outside
the office, possibly an investi
gation by HUAC that charges
subversion of Stanford by an
agent-alumnus from the great
institution across the Bay, per
haps even a call from the Presi
dent's office to account for my
presence on campus, not to men
tion my drawing a monthly pay
check.
It's true: Heinz Eulau has
been a pseudonym all along, in
vented to protect me from the
wrath of those for whom "Fritz
Einlau" is too much to bear. I
can hardly bear it myself.

(Editor's note: We trust that
our good readers will allow
Fritz Einlau to sink once again
into anonymous oblivion.)
• Ugly Rages
Editor, The Daily:
Stanford at last has a new
social center. Admittedly, it is
lacking in several features suit
able to such a center. Coffee
for example, must be smuggled
in from near-by Cubberley and
the music is confined to the cas
ual vocalizing of our more tal
ented undergraduates, but these
inconveniences can be forgiven
a building just barely com
pleted.
Its design has real social po
tential. What university library
in the country is more suitable
for an amateur performance of
Borneo and Juliet? Where else
can you shoot paper airplanes
from the fourth floor to the
Reserve Reading Desk on the
Second floor? And where else
can you communicate with a
friend on any of the top three
floors?
Of course there are disad
vantages, the most outstanding
being the several book shelves.
These are limited in number,
but there are enough to give the
building a slightly offensive aca
demic aura. And, it has been
rumored that there are one or
two corners of the building, in
the no-smoking areas, where an
academic dolt can enjoy as
much as five minutes of silence.
This is a deplorable condition
and one that could, if not cor
rected, set a dangerous precen
dent
It is the purpose of this letter
to help spread the brotherhood
and mirth of the center to the
far corners of our new library.
Given the excellence of the Stan
ford Student body, this chould
not be a difficult task.
