# Lynch Warns Of Negro 'Concentration Camps'
## 
### GAIL ANDERSON 
"The United States has a system of
concentration camps across the na
tion which can be used to detain peo
ple and groups that are determined
dangerous to tht national interest,"
charged Lincoln Lynch, Assistant Na
tional Director of CORE, in a speech
here Friday.
Substituting for Floyd McKissick,
National Director hospitalized in New
York, Lynch criticized "the white
establishment" in the second program
of Political Union's FOCUS series.
The series "A Great Society in
America"presented Friday "The Ne
gro in American Society."
Lynch represented the position
usually identified by the CORE phrase
"Black Power," and commented
"black power doesn't need further
elaborate — the whites know what
it is."
Lynch's most striking point con
cerned his observations on the Mc-
Carran-Walter Act of 1952. Title II
of this act, he contended, enabled the
United States government to set up a
system of concentration camps —
"euphemistically called detention
camps"—capable of holding 25,000 peo
ple.
The camps are presently being used,
he said, for federal prisoners, but they

could in the future be used to detain
large numbers of political prisoners.
He cited one camp in Allentown,
Pennsylvania ,and said there were sev
eral in California.
Lynch maintained that these camps
could be used to imprison the Negro
race wholesale. He compared the sit
uation to wartime Germany.
"The black people must be willing
to fight," he said. He added that there
could be "no compromise" and men
tioned the possible use of guns.
"But we already have another kind
of concentration camp in America,"
he told the audience. "These concen
tration camps are the ghettoes of our
cities."
Lynch criticized the "hypocrisy" of
white society as a whole as well as of
the government.
He also cited San Bernardino and
the activities of the right-wing Min
utemen organization.
Lynch is in the area to participate
in a conference on "Survival of the
Black People," currently being held
by the Russian Center in San Fran
cisco. The program centers around
the problems of "the survival of a
Black Community" and features speak
ers Wilfred T. Ussery, National Chair
man of CORE, and Stokely Carmi
chael, SNCC National Chairman.

tration camps are the ghettoes of our
cities."
Lynch criticized the "hypocrisy" of
white society as a whole as well as of
the government.
He also cited San Bernardino and
the activities of the right-wing Min
utemen organization.
Lynch is in the area to participate
in a conference on "Survival of the
Black People," currently being held
by the Russian Center in San Fran
cisco. The program centers around
the problems of "the survival of a
Black Community" and features speak
ers Wilfred T. Ussery, National Chair
man of CORE, and Stokely Carmi
chael, SNCC National Chairman.
"The United States has a system of
concentration camps across the na
tion which can be used to detain peo
ple and groups that are determined
dangerous to tht national interest,"
charged Lincoln Lynch, Assistant Na
tional Director of CORE, in a speech
here Friday.
Substituting for Floyd McKissick,
National Director hospitalized in New
York, Lynch criticized "the white
establishment" in the second program
of Political Union's FOCUS series.
The series "A Great Society in
America"presented Friday "The Ne
gro in American Society."
Lynch represented the position
usually identified by the CORE phrase
"Black Power," and commented
"black power doesn't need further
elaborate — the whites know what
it is."
Lynch's most striking point con
cerned his observations on the Mc-
Carran-Walter Act of 1952. Title II
of this act, he contended, enabled the
United States government to set up a
system of concentration camps —
"euphemistically called detention
camps"—capable of holding 25,000 peo
ple.
The camps are presently being used,
he said, for federal prisoners, but they

could in the future be used to detain
large numbers of political prisoners.
He cited one camp in Allentown,
Pennsylvania ,and said there were sev
eral in California.
Lynch maintained that these camps
could be used to imprison the Negro
race wholesale. He compared the sit
uation to wartime Germany.
"The black people must be willing
to fight," he said. He added that there
could be "no compromise" and men
tioned the possible use of guns.
"But we already have another kind
of concentration camp in America,"
he told the audience. "These concen
tration camps are the ghettoes of our
cities."
