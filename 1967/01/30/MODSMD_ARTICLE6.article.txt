## Academic Council Urges Regents To Give UC Faculty 'Major Voice' 
### 
The Academic Council Friday urged
the University of California Board of
Regents to give the faculty a "major
voice in choosing a new President"
and in "establishing effective safe
guards against the arbitrary or sum
mary dismissal of administrators."
By the vote of 228 to 28, the Council
adopted a resolution calling the firing
of Kerr a "disturbing and precipitate
action" which has endangered "the
continuation of the University's great
ness."
"The circumstances of President
Clark Kerr's dismissal will make it
difficult to attract a comparably dis
tinguished educator to assume the
presidency," the statement read.
"Meanwhile, other universities may
anticipate the enrichment of their fac
ulties at the expense of the Univer
sity of California."
Stronger Statement
The Executive Committee and the
Advisory Board of the Council had
previously issued a statement express
ing regret at Kerr's dismissal and sup
porting autonomy for university ad
ministrations and faculties. In hopes
of obtaining a strong resolution, Math
ematics professor Halsey Royden cir
culated a petition calling for a meeting
of the full Academic Council.
Royden reported that he was "very
pleased that the Academic Council saw
fit to adopt the present resolution."
"It is an excellent statement," he
said, "which makes clearer the points
I hoped the Council would approve."
Royden stated that the purpose of

the resolution was to express concern
for the situation at UC.
"I hope that it will indicate to the
Board of Regents and faculty at UC
that there exists a concern outside of
the University of California itself,"
Royden continued.
According to Academic Secretary
H. Donald Winbigler, the new state
ment has received much more pub
licity than the previous one and is
stronger in that it is endorsed by the
whole Academic Council.
The resolution was accepted for a
variety of reasons, he reported, some
faculty members believing it would
actually influence the Regents and oth
ers feeling a moral obligation to make
a commitment.
Winbigler noted that certain aspects
of the statement had been played-up
and often misinterpreted in the press.
IT nderstatement
The statement that the faculies of
other universities may be enriched at
the expense of UC, he said, was often
interpreted as will be enriched.
The idea was "deliberately under
stated," Winbigler continued. He added
that this sentence was one point of
debate, council members differing over
whether it would reassure the UC
faculty or instead aggravate the dif
ficulties.
Cal professor Kenneth Stampp,
sponsor of the UC Academic Senate's
resolution condemning the dismissal
of Kerr, called the Stanford statement
"not terribly aggressive."
"But I think it will help," he added.
"Every statement that records dis

approval of what the Regents did is
going to have some effect on the Re
gents and also, I hope, on some of
the state's political leaders," Stampp
continued.
Stampp reported that numerous oth
er statements have been received from
state colleges but that he was not
aware of any by faculty groups other
than at state colleges.
"There have been many statements
by administrators," he added, "and I
hope that more will come in."
Priceless Asset
The Academic Council's called a
great public university a "priceless
asset to any state."
"The University of California pres
ently ranks as one of the country's
greatest," the statement read. "It's
distinction is demonstrated by the
quality of its faculty, which includes
some of the nation's most noted schol
ars, teachers, and scientists."
The resolution noted that "We, the
faculty of Stanford University, join
our colleagues at Berkeley in deplor
ing" the dismissal of Kerr. "We urge
the Regents to restore confidence in
the University's independence" by
giving the faculty a voice in deter
mining a successor.
The Council directed the Academic
Secretary to send a copy of the
Resolution to each member of UCs
Board of Regents and to each di
vision of the Berkeley Academic
Senate.
