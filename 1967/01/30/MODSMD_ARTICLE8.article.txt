# Grove House Vandalized Late Friday
## 
### 
Vandals struck Stanford's first co
educational living and learning center
early last Saturday morning.
Four young males attacked the
Grove Project, ripping off the house
sign, tearing up personal photo
graphs, and smashing a large collage
on display in the hallway. They drove
away before they could be identified.
University officials have condemned
the incident and started an investi
gation. Provost Richard Lyman, who
visited the house shortly after the
1:30 a.m. incident said:
"Vandalism is bad enough under
any circumstances, but when it in
volves the destruction of a talented
student's art work, it is particularly
deplorable.
"Miss Ann Birky, like other mem
bers of the Grove Project, is partici
pating in a very interesting educa
tional venture.
"It is difficult to imagine a more
direct confrontation between the crea
tive and the destructive than the
smashing of her work."
