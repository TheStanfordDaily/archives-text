# Humans In Hospitals—Experiments?
## 
### PAT MCMAHON

You bet your life — but it's
a safe bet.
When a doctor performs an
experiment he is trying to help
the patient as well as further
scientific knowledge. Once in a
while, however, safety and se
curity are not so safe and sound.
Investigators at the Sloan-Ket
tering Research Center in New
York last fall asked some criti

cally ill patients to take part in
an experiment.
The doctors would be "inject
ing some cells" into them, the
subjects were told. These 22 ex
perimentees were never told
that the cells were malignant
and the word "cancer" — never
mentioned.
As it turned out, the investi
gators gained extensive informa
tion about immunity to cancer,
and the subjects whom the in
vestigators did not want to "un

necessarily alarm" were ap
parently unharmed.
The Question of Ethics
However, the ethical ques
tions present themselves in such
a case. Shouldn't the subjects
be informed of the exact nature
of the experiment? When is evi
dence conclusive enough to test
it out on human beings? What
are the pre-requisites for carry
ing out an experiment ethically?
If I am a patient — an experi
ment — will I know? Will they
ask me? Will they tell me the
truth?
Much concern about the use
of human beings in research and
requests for a review have de
veloped for two reasons, said
Dr. Henry K. Beecher, M.D., pro
fessor of medicine at Harvard, in
his essay "Experimentation In
Man."
Reasons for Concern
"First there were the outrages
of Hitler's Germany. The puzzle
is how such a thing could have
occurred in modern society....
Second, there is the rather new
ly recognized fact that some
types of basic scientific advance
could be made only in the pres
ence of the disease."
"Nature presents us with
bolder experiments than we ever
dare to perform. We profit from
a study of them — basic science
profits," Beecher noted.
"It is the mission of the doc
tor to safeguard the health of
the people. His knowledge and
conscience are dedicated to the
fulfillment of this mission," be
gins the Declaration of Helsinki.
The declaration was adopted in
1964 by the World Medical Asso
ciation and presents a code of
ethics on human experimenta
tion.
Code of Ethics
The Declaration includes three
basic principles:
1) Clinical research should be
based on laboratory and animal
experiments or other scientif
ically established facts and must
conform to the principles on
which medical research is based.
2) Research should only be
conducted by scientifically quali
fied persons under medical su
pervision.
3) Research cannot be legiti
mate unless the importance of
the objective is proportional to
the inherent risk.
Procedure Revision
Concern was widespread by
the middle of last year when the
Public Health Service issued an
extensive revision of procedure
on clinical research and investi
gation involving human sub
jects.
It specifically insisted that
group review of an experiment
in question be carried out to re
ceive any Public Health Service

(PHS) grant for the experiment
The PHS stated that the review
should "assure an independent
determination 1) of the rights
and welfare of the individual or
individuals involved, 2) of th<>
appropriateness of the methodj
used to secure informed consent,
and 3) the risks and potential
medical benefits of the investi
gation."
Med Center Policy
In an interview with Th<
Daily, the administrator of th->
Clinical Research Center at Stan
ford Medical Center discussed
the policy of the Medical Center
to exemplify the concern here
for the subject.
"A Stanford point of viev/
towards this subject," the policy
statement begins, "must b<*
stated as a guide for academic
faculty who try to add to the
sum of medical knowledge by in
vestigating patients under their
care. This is a difficult subject
to bring into sharp focus, and
subject wide open to misinter
pretation."
At Stanford, said Administra
tor H. Jack Geiken, we are try
ing to develop and employ "ef
fective, enlightened, and the
newest therapy." Our work witl
humans is usually oreviewet.
with several years of animal ex
periment.
Consent Form
The consent form contains a
written description of the "pro
cedure to be undertaken" and re
quires the patient's (or guard
ian's) as well as the physician's
signature.
It reads "I have been informed
of the risks and possible con
sequences involved in the per
formance of the procedure de
scribed above, have been advised
that unforseen results may oc
cur, and nevertheless, hereby
authorize "
In a letter from Hubert Heff
ner, Associate Provost for Re
search, to the Public Health Ser
vice, the committee structure is
outlined: "Two University com
mittees exist to assure proper
procedures in the conduct of re
search involving human sub
jects. The first, concerned pri
marily with medical research,
predates the Public Health Ser
vice requirements." He then
listed the doctors on the com
mittee, all from different de
partments.
Geiken noted also that he sits
on the medical committee as the
representative of the experi
ment ees.
Now all research hospitals re
ceiving grants from the Public
Health Service have boards of
review to insure the patient that
his friendly neighborhood hos
pitai an even safer bet.
