# Seven Points To Ponder
## 
### 
1. Remember the law, the ser
iousness of its penalties, and the
lifelong consequences of convic
tion. Do what you can to change
an unjust law of a society that
throws together the physiologi
cally non-addictive psychedelics
with addictive drugs such as
heroin and pours millions into
addictive killer drugs such as
alchohol and nicotine.
2. Remember our ignorance
of the subtle and long range
effects of psychedelics. In our
nation, which spends more on
cosmetics than on education, ig
»horance, hypocrisy and fear
have reduced sanctioned re
search to a trickle. Research
should be physiological, psycho
logical, ethical and religious.
3. Remember the enormous
potency of the psychedelics.
Weigh carefully their destruc
tive and creative powers. The
dangers are real. If you are pre
psychotic, they are likely to
bring the latent psychosis to the
surface; if more than reason
ably neurotic, they may do more
'harm than good. On the other
hand, psychedelics may be the
key to inner discoveries and
inner powers to cope with the
forces that threaten total de
struction.
Tune In
4. Be critical. Don't fall for

the phony argument that what
the psychedelics might give you
should be earned. What of the
gift of life? More to the point
is to use well the gifts that life
brings. The more overwhelming
the psychedelic experience, the
more unutterable its beauty, the
more exalting and humbling its
effect, the harder you must
work to assimilate its values in
to everyday life.
On the other hand, if you look
on LSD as an escape, ask care
fully, from what, to what? If
you are psychologically overde
pendent, be careful. You may
find yourself dependent on
Mother LSD. If you take it too
frequently you're not allowing
yourself time to assimilate what
it brings you.
5. I am not recommending
that you take a psychedelic even
when and where it is legal. But
If you must, don't take it lightly.
Have someone with you whom
you trust; who has had it him
self and is more likely to under
stand what is going on; who
will not push you around but
will help when needed; who will
put on and take off records, etc.;
who will answer the door and
keep gawkers and well-wishers
away.
Approach the experience with
meditation, or whatever your
version of prayer may be, and
as much faith, hope and love
as you have in you. Some of (he
most painful experiences are
among the most rewarding, but
if you think you need help, call
for a doctor quickly.
Unique Experiences
6. Remember that each psy
chedelic experience is unique,
and tends to bring out what is
latent in you. What that is no
one can know. As Ophelia says,
"We know what we are but we
know not what we may be."
Common to many psychedelic
experiences is the direct sense
of the kinship of many things.
You may experience yourself

dwindling to a point and be
coming one with infinite light.
You may look into a mirror and
see one after another a thousand
faces from you know not where,
and know that each is somehow
your own. You may weep years
of unshed tears, and feel that
you could never again be mean
or petty.
Such experiences may be in
stant, but the memory of them
will be enduring. One will never
live up to them, but one will find
them hard to shake off.
One Recommendation
7. I repeat, I do not recom
mend the psychedelics to any
one. But I make one exception.
I recommend that LBJ, heart
and all, take a large dose of
LSD. If it could crack his ex
treme egotism, it might plunge
him into an agony of self-exam
ination that could change the
course of history.

1. Remember the law, the ser
iousness of its penalties, and the
lifelong consequences of convic
tion. Do what you can to change
an unjust law of a society that
throws together the physiologi
cally non-addictive psychedelics
with addictive drugs such as
heroin and pours millions into
addictive killer drugs such as
alchohol and nicotine.
2. Remember our ignorance
of the subtle and long range
effects of psychedelics. In our
nation, which spends more on
cosmetics than on education, ig
»horance, hypocrisy and fear
have reduced sanctioned re
search to a trickle. Research
should be physiological, psycho
logical, ethical and religious.
3. Remember the enormous
potency of the psychedelics.
Weigh carefully their destruc
tive and creative powers. The
dangers are real. If you are pre
psychotic, they are likely to
bring the latent psychosis to the
surface; if more than reason
ably neurotic, they may do more
'harm than good. On the other
hand, psychedelics may be the
key to inner discoveries and
inner powers to cope with the
forces that threaten total de
struction.
Tune In
4. Be critical. Don't fall for

the phony argument that what
the psychedelics might give you
should be earned. What of the
gift of life? More to the point
is to use well the gifts that life
brings. The more overwhelming
the psychedelic experience, the
more unutterable its beauty, the
more exalting and humbling its
effect, the harder you must
work to assimilate its values in
to everyday life.
On the other hand, if you look
on LSD as an escape, ask care
fully, from what, to what? If
you are psychologically overde
pendent, be careful. You may
find yourself dependent on
Mother LSD. If you take it too
frequently you're not allowing
yourself time to assimilate what
it brings you.
5. I am not recommending
that you take a psychedelic even
when and where it is legal. But
If you must, don't take it lightly.
Have someone with you whom
you trust; who has had it him
self and is more likely to under
stand what is going on; who
will not push you around but
will help when needed; who will
put on and take off records, etc.;
who will answer the door and
keep gawkers and well-wishers
away.
Approach the experience with
meditation, or whatever your
version of prayer may be, and
as much faith, hope and love
as you have in you. Some of (he
most painful experiences are
among the most rewarding, but
if you think you need help, call
for a doctor quickly.
Unique Experiences
6. Remember that each psy
chedelic experience is unique,
and tends to bring out what is
latent in you. What that is no
one can know. As Ophelia says,
"We know what we are but we
know not what we may be."
Common to many psychedelic
experiences is the direct sense
of the kinship of many things.
You may experience yourself

dwindling to a point and be
coming one with infinite light.
You may look into a mirror and
see one after another a thousand
faces from you know not where,
and know that each is somehow
your own. You may weep years
of unshed tears, and feel that
you could never again be mean
or petty.
Such experiences may be in
stant, but the memory of them
will be enduring. One will never
live up to them, but one will find
them hard to shake off.

you could never again be mean
or petty.
Such experiences may be in
stant, but the memory of them
will be enduring. One will never
live up to them, but one will find
them hard to shake off.
One Recommendation
7. I repeat, I do not recom
mend the psychedelics to any
one. But I make one exception.
I recommend that LBJ, heart
and all, take a large dose of
LSD. If it could crack his ex
treme egotism, it might plunge
him into an agony of self-exam
ination that could change the
course of history.
