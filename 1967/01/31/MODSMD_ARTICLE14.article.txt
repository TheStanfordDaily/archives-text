"Given appropriate conditions,
the psychedelic agents can be
employed to enhance any aspect
of mental performance."

So concluded Doctors Willis

Harman and James Fadiman as
a result of a study of psyche
delic drugs and problem-solving.
The study involved experiments
with professional people who
worked various complicated
problems after having taken a
psychedelic drug (mescaline sul
phate).
"While this research was re
stricted to intellectual and artis
tic activity, we believe the as
sumption holds true for any
other mental, perceptual or emo
tional process. The psychedelic
agent acts as a facilitator . . .
by itself neither good nor evil,
efficacious nor powerless, safe
nor dangerous."
The subjects of the experi
ment produced, among other
things, a new conceptual model
of a photon, a design of a linear
electron accelerator beam steer
ing-device, a mathematical the
orem regarding NOR-gate cir
cuits, and several innovations in
architecture and design.
Most of the subjects reported
that their problem-solving and
creative capabilities were re
leased and enhanced under the

influence of the psychedelic
drug. The report of the study,
soon to be published, explains:
"The psychedelics appear to
temporarily inhibit censors
which ordinarily limit the men
tal contents coming into con
scious awareness. Thus the sub
ject may, for example, discover
his latent ability to form colored
imagery, to hallucinate, to recall
forgotten experiences of early
childhood, to generate meaning
ful symbolic presentations, etc."
In work performance since
the session, over half the sub
jects have shown significant or
marked improvement in prob
lem-solving capability.
"Among consequences of this
line of exploration, the most
significant of all in our estima
tion is the gaining of new
knowledge of the mysterious
higher processes of the human
mind, the framing of new and
more productive research ques
tions, and the eventual effect
on our image of man—of what
he can be, and what he is; of the
vast potentialities which he has
seemingly only begun to tap."
"Given appropriate conditions,
the psychedelic agents can be
employed to enhance any aspect

Most of the subjects reported
that their problem-solving and
creative capabilities were re
leased and enhanced under the

influence of the psychedelic
drug. The report of the study,
soon to be published, explains:
"The psychedelics appear to
temporarily inhibit censors
which ordinarily limit the men
tal contents coming into con
scious awareness. Thus the sub
ject may, for example, discover
his latent ability to form colored
imagery, to hallucinate, to recall
forgotten experiences of early
childhood, to generate meaning
ful symbolic presentations, etc."
In work performance since
the session, over half the sub
jects have shown significant or
marked improvement in prob
lem-solving capability.
"Among consequences of this
line of exploration, the most
significant of all in our estima
tion is the gaining of new
knowledge of the mysterious
higher processes of the human
mind, the framing of new and
more productive research ques
tions, and the eventual effect
on our image of man—of what
he can be, and what he is; of the
vast potentialities which he has
seemingly only begun to tap."
