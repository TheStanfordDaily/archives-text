# Don't Drop Out—We Need More White-Collar Hippies'
## 
### GAIL ANDERSON 
"If you haven't taken LSD by
now, don't."
This was the advice of psycho
pharmacologist Dr. Jack Shel
ton, himseli a 70-time user of
LSD who has administered it to
his patients about 500 times.
"I stopped taking LSD about
3 or 4 years ago," he explained
in a recent interview. "It can be
extremely beneficial under the
right circumstances — but right
now these are almost impossible
to produce.
"After taking LSD, your sug
gestibility is greatly increased,
so your social and psychological
environment can have a tremen
dous influence on you. LSD is
now such a public thing that it is
difficult to escape these in
fluences.
"Of course, people who are
more socially inclined anyway
are even more susceptible.
That's why it's really bad that
even fraternity members are
caking LSD. The dependence of
the average fraternity man on
society makes it more likely that
ie will have a bad trip.
"I see the future of LSD as
howing people a more valuable
cological relationship to the
world — not the present 'you
push the world around or it
pushes you' — but one of unity.
But our language is based on
dualities, like self-other, and
when you try to talk about this
you are misunderstood.
"You know Reagan's state
ment about 'who needs another
tree in California?' I'd love to be
able to give Reagan LSD under a
tree — he'd never say that again.
"Many people are coming to
the end of their LSD experience.
They use it successfully as a
path to meditation and then no
longer need it. This is how LSD
is best used ...
"The main task of the medita
tive discipline is to escape the
compressibility of time. When
we are children an afternoon is
an eternity. We experience the
eternal now. We lose this as we
—quote —grow up—unquote. I
want to move from adolescence
to senility. Growing up is selling
out and licking your wounds
with alcohol. LSD lets you ex
perience time subjectively.
"It also gives you a perspec
tive, makes it easier for you to
bear the 8-to-5 world. Monday
morning, when you're back in
your ego's clothes, they fit more
comfortably.

"If you know truly who you
are, you know that you have
nothing to give anyone. People
already have it.
"This doesn't mean you with
draw. That's the trouble with
Leary's formula — 'Turn on,
tune in, drop out.' If our best
kids follow this advice, the
squares will kill us. We need
white-collar hippies — in society,
controlling it so the mechanical
MacNamara-type minds won't be
able to.

"When you realize that the
other person is you, you don't
kill him or even mistreat him.
The Golden Rule works that
way, not through enforcing it.
It just happens."
We walked out through the
restaurant and he waved his
hand at the people eating lunch.
"Look at all these little bits of
eternity," he said, "And the sad
thing is that they don't even
know it. But — yes, they real
ly do — at night, in their
dreams..
