# 'Ask Not What LSD Can Do For You'
## 
### JAMES PAULSEN 
Being asked to write about
LSD is becoming a rather com
plicated matter. In the good old
days — say 1955 — it was an
affable and approachable topic,
interesting but challengingly ab
struse, curious but not danger
ous, pleasant but not world
shaking. Unlike man, the days
are changing. LSD nowadays is
a stimulus for mighty emotions,
social entanglements, cultism,
and an amorphous rigidity which
enables a reactionary Republican
to unctuously attest that he
wouldn't touch the stuff with a
10 foot Democratic ego. All this
leads me to feel, occasionally,
that I ought to establish myself
on some Stanford campus cor
ner, partially hidden in bushes,
and with a cryptic expression ac
cost students by opportuning:
"Pssst! LSD information here."
You want something, Mad
ame? — Sir? To Study More Ef
fectively? Brilliantly? Unincom
prehensively? To Relate Better?
More? Closer? Paratangential
ly? To Find Identity? Yourself?
Others? Mankind? Ask not, Sir
and Madame, what LSD can do
for you, but rather what you can
do for yourself.
False Insights
Ask yourself, — but better,
face yourself. If you can't ac
cept what you are and who you
are, LSD won't do this for you.
I'm not at all impressed with the
alleged "insights" which repeat
ed LSD users contend they de
velop. Fooling oneself is a game
older than the Old Testament. If
you can't alter what you don't
like about yourself or your func

tions, don't demand that LSD do
the work. Instant insight? Ba
loney. Short-cuts in life are
myths. Dream them if you will,
but live them not. Dreams can
be more dangerous than LSD.
Of all the dreams in LSD not
one contains an erg of work or
a microgram of love. The
"scene" of a group of "high"
people, moping about some un
kempt pad in San Francisco pro
testing their glorious relatedness
to others and infinity, is in utter
reality no Valhalla to them or
anyone else. It is, however, an
escape. The dilemma lies in the
need to escape, and Ihe enigma
is what it is they are escaping
from. I suspect they seek to es
cape from parts of themselves.
Fine — who doesn't? But leave
out the phony stuff. If you can't
— or won't — work, OK, loaf.
Entirely your prerogative.
But despair not, LSD is a
powerful experience, and there
in, probably, contains the worth.
The power in the experience is
emotional. For those individuals
who have displaced the capacity
to feel significantly about them
selves, others, and things, LSD
may offer the chance to redirect
emotions. Be prepared that it
may also offer a ticket to a farth
er land of isolation and loneli
ness. No guarantees inherent in
the price of admission. Your
"travel agent" tells you differ
ently? Of course. As I said,
please pay the fee, Sir! What is
the fee? Simple, Sir, the fee is
you.
'Worth The Fee?'
But some experiences are well
worth the fee. You will have to

be the judge of which is which.
LSD is unquestionably a new
experience, and similar to other
types of new experiences can of
fer the initiation of •change. It
must be made perfectly clear,
however, that it (the experience,
the "trip") is not and cannot be
the change. The experience is a
now; change is a future. But
some students committed to LSD
are unable to know the differ
ence and therefore are obliged
to live in various degrees of con
fusion. Only in a thoroughly con
fused individual could this be es
sentially gratifying.
Life can be described as an
accumulation of predispositions.
Individuals are predisposed to
things and happenings. This is
style. I suspect that the inherent
style of an individual is some
how enhanced by LSD. The pre
dispositions are more manifest,
partly because of facade-strip
ping. LSD can make the person
ality naked, and we all know
that nakedness is a relative
thing. There are "inner things"
within all individuals; often
these are better left alone, un
less, of course, function is im
paired. Introspective, self-direct
ing people have trouble letting
themselves alone. I further sus

pect that some of these indivi
duals are more likely than others
to experience the "bad" trip.
There is the case of the Philo
sophy (or was it Chemistry?)
major wh0....
Paulsen's Trilogy
Timothy Leary offered his
trilogy regarding LSD; I have
one, too. It goes like this: 1) If
you, your friends, family or a
professional can demonstrate
emotional instability in you, let
the stuff quite alone; 2) If you
decide to take it, read and dis
cuss the matter at all levels
(Playboy to the American Jour
nal of Psychiatry) and think
about the possibility of a psy
chiatric assessment, or evalua
tion; 3) Have a competent, ob
jective individual with you when
you have the experience and if
possible obtain the "antidote" in
case it is needed. And, Sir, re
member the admission fee.
Like I've said to friends...
bon voyage. See you later.

Paulsen's Trilogy
Timothy Leary offered his
trilogy regarding LSD; I have
one, too. It goes like this: 1) If
you, your friends, family or a
professional can demonstrate
emotional instability in you, let
the stuff quite alone; 2) If you
decide to take it, read and dis
cuss the matter at all levels
(Playboy to the American Jour
nal of Psychiatry) and think
about the possibility of a psy
chiatric assessment, or evalua
tion; 3) Have a competent, ob
jective individual with you when
you have the experience and if
possible obtain the "antidote" in
case it is needed. And, Sir, re
member the admission fee.
Like I've said to friends...
bon voyage. See you later.
Being asked to write about
LSD is becoming a rather com
plicated matter. In the good old
days — say 1955 — it was an
affable and approachable topic,
interesting but challengingly ab
struse, curious but not danger
ous, pleasant but not world
shaking. Unlike man, the days
are changing. LSD nowadays is
a stimulus for mighty emotions,
social entanglements, cultism,
and an amorphous rigidity which
enables a reactionary Republican
to unctuously attest that he
wouldn't touch the stuff with a
10 foot Democratic ego. All this
leads me to feel, occasionally,
that I ought to establish myself
on some Stanford campus cor
ner, partially hidden in bushes,
and with a cryptic expression ac
cost students by opportuning:
"Pssst! LSD information here."
You want something, Mad
ame? — Sir? To Study More Ef
fectively? Brilliantly? Unincom
prehensively? To Relate Better?
More? Closer? Paratangential
ly? To Find Identity? Yourself?
Others? Mankind? Ask not, Sir
and Madame, what LSD can do
for you, but rather what you can
do for yourself.
False Insights
Ask yourself, — but better,
face yourself. If you can't ac
cept what you are and who you
are, LSD won't do this for you.
I'm not at all impressed with the
alleged "insights" which repeat
ed LSD users contend they de
velop. Fooling oneself is a game
older than the Old Testament. If
you can't alter what you don't
like about yourself or your func

tions, don't demand that LSD do
the work. Instant insight? Ba
loney. Short-cuts in life are
myths. Dream them if you will,
but live them not. Dreams can
be more dangerous than LSD.
Of all the dreams in LSD not
one contains an erg of work or
a microgram of love. The
"scene" of a group of "high"
people, moping about some un
kempt pad in San Francisco pro
testing their glorious relatedness
to others and infinity, is in utter
reality no Valhalla to them or
anyone else. It is, however, an
escape. The dilemma lies in the
need to escape, and Ihe enigma
is what it is they are escaping
from. I suspect they seek to es
cape from parts of themselves.
Fine — who doesn't? But leave
out the phony stuff. If you can't
— or won't — work, OK, loaf.
Entirely your prerogative.
But despair not, LSD is a
powerful experience, and there
in, probably, contains the worth.
The power in the experience is
emotional. For those individuals
who have displaced the capacity
to feel significantly about them
selves, others, and things, LSD
may offer the chance to redirect
emotions. Be prepared that it
may also offer a ticket to a farth
er land of isolation and loneli
ness. No guarantees inherent in
the price of admission. Your
"travel agent" tells you differ
ently? Of course. As I said,
please pay the fee, Sir! What is
the fee? Simple, Sir, the fee is
you.
'Worth The Fee?'
But some experiences are well
worth the fee. You will have to

be the judge of which is which.
LSD is unquestionably a new
experience, and similar to other
types of new experiences can of
fer the initiation of •change. It
must be made perfectly clear,
however, that it (the experience,
the "trip") is not and cannot be
the change. The experience is a
now; change is a future. But
some students committed to LSD
are unable to know the differ
ence and therefore are obliged
to live in various degrees of con
fusion. Only in a thoroughly con
fused individual could this be es
sentially gratifying.
Life can be described as an
accumulation of predispositions.
Individuals are predisposed to
things and happenings. This is
style. I suspect that the inherent
style of an individual is some
how enhanced by LSD. The pre
dispositions are more manifest,
partly because of facade-strip
ping. LSD can make the person
ality naked, and we all know
that nakedness is a relative
thing. There are "inner things"
within all individuals; often
these are better left alone, un
less, of course, function is im
paired. Introspective, self-direct
ing people have trouble letting
themselves alone. I further sus

types of new experiences can of
fer the initiation of •change. It
must be made perfectly clear,
however, that it (the experience,
the "trip") is not and cannot be
the change. The experience is a
now; change is a future. But
some students committed to LSD
are unable to know the differ

to live in various degrees of con
fusion. Only in a thoroughly con
fused individual could this be es
sentially gratifying.
Life can be described as an
accumulation of predispositions.
Individuals are predisposed to
things and happenings. This is
style. I suspect that the inherent
style of an individual is some
how enhanced by LSD. The pre
dispositions are more manifest,
partly because of facade-strip
ping. LSD can make the person
ality naked, and we all know
that nakedness is a relative
thing. There are "inner things"
within all individuals; often
these are better left alone, un
less, of course, function is im
paired. Introspective, self-direct
ing people have trouble letting
themselves alone. I further sus

pect that some of these indivi
duals are more likely than others
to experience the "bad" trip.

Paulsen's Trilogy
Timothy Leary offered his
trilogy regarding LSD; I have
one, too. It goes like this: 1) If
you, your friends, family or a
professional can demonstrate
emotional instability in you, let
the stuff quite alone; 2) If you
decide to take it, read and dis
cuss the matter at all levels
(Playboy to the American Jour
nal of Psychiatry) and think
about the possibility of a psy
chiatric assessment, or evalua
tion; 3) Have a competent, ob
jective individual with you when
you have the experience and if
possible obtain the "antidote" in
case it is needed. And, Sir, re
member the admission fee.
Like I've said to friends...
bon voyage. See you later.
Being asked to write about
LSD is becoming a rather com
plicated matter. In the good old
days — say 1955 — it was an
affable and approachable topic,
interesting but challengingly ab
struse, curious but not danger
ous, pleasant but not world
shaking. Unlike man, the days
are changing. LSD nowadays is
a stimulus for mighty emotions,
social entanglements, cultism,
and an amorphous rigidity which
enables a reactionary Republican
to unctuously attest that he
wouldn't touch the stuff with a
10 foot Democratic ego. All this
leads me to feel, occasionally,
that I ought to establish myself
on some Stanford campus cor
ner, partially hidden in bushes,
and with a cryptic expression ac
cost students by opportuning:
"Pssst! LSD information here."
You want something, Mad
ame? — Sir? To Study More Ef
fectively? Brilliantly? Unincom
prehensively? To Relate Better?
More? Closer? Paratangential
ly? To Find Identity? Yourself?
Others? Mankind? Ask not, Sir
and Madame, what LSD can do
for you, but rather what you can
do for yourself.
False Insights
Ask yourself, — but better,
face yourself. If you can't ac
cept what you are and who you
are, LSD won't do this for you.
I'm not at all impressed with the
alleged "insights" which repeat
ed LSD users contend they de
velop. Fooling oneself is a game
older than the Old Testament. If
you can't alter what you don't
like about yourself or your func

tions, don't demand that LSD do
the work. Instant insight? Ba
loney. Short-cuts in life are
myths. Dream them if you will,
but live them not. Dreams can
be more dangerous than LSD.
Of all the dreams in LSD not
one contains an erg of work or
a microgram of love. The
"scene" of a group of "high"
people, moping about some un
kempt pad in San Francisco pro
testing their glorious relatedness
to others and infinity, is in utter
reality no Valhalla to them or
anyone else. It is, however, an
escape. The dilemma lies in the
need to escape, and Ihe enigma
is what it is they are escaping
from. I suspect they seek to es
cape from parts of themselves.
Fine — who doesn't? But leave
out the phony stuff. If you can't
— or won't — work, OK, loaf.
Entirely your prerogative.
But despair not, LSD is a
powerful experience, and there
in, probably, contains the worth.
The power in the experience is
emotional. For those individuals
who have displaced the capacity
to feel significantly about them
selves, others, and things, LSD
may offer the chance to redirect
emotions. Be prepared that it
may also offer a ticket to a farth
er land of isolation and loneli
ness. No guarantees inherent in
the price of admission. Your
"travel agent" tells you differ
ently? Of course. As I said,
please pay the fee, Sir! What is
the fee? Simple, Sir, the fee is
you.
'Worth The Fee?'
But some experiences are well
worth the fee. You will have to

be the judge of which is which.
