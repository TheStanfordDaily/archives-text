# Break Out, Drop In

### GAIL ANDERSON 
"LSD is not necessarily good for everyone. It's definitely bad fpr
some. I know it's been good for me."
A Stanford student who used LSD "30 or 40 times — it doesrj't
matter" describes his experiences with the drug.
"I've noticed one thing about my social existence on campus. I
play roles. I play the entertainer when I'm with girls — and my
hang up is — or was — that I didn't feel I was communicating
unless the girl and I were both entertaining, trying to please each
other. When we were silent, the relationship ended.
"It's a common hang-up of college students. We run around in
big groups, have big discussions in the Union. We're unwilling to
commit ourselves to one other person for very long because we're
afraid of boredom. You can only entertain for so long. You reach
a point where no more can be said.
"But there are enough interesting people at Stanford that it's
easy to get into a rut. I find myself constantly flying from one per
son to another.
Communication Without Words
"When I took LSD — I took it with a girl, the particular time
I'm talking about — for the first time in my life I experienced silent
communication, communication without words. There was no play-;
ing a role, no mutual ego game. LSD produces an ego loss. In one
sense, I became a child again, playing with mudpies in the garden.
It was a joyful, infantile, yet extremely beautiful kind of commu
nication. I felt I didn't have to try to communicate. LSD makes
you let go — you don't try, it just happens, it's there.
"Taking LSD made me aware of all my games here at Stanford,
and this awareness opens up a possibility of improvement — not
on LSD but back in the world. Once I had recognized my problem,
I could work toward solving it. My relationships with people are
ceasing to be superficial.
"Just the beauty of the experience would be enough of an excuse
— but this is much more!
"LSD has also made me into a mystic. Before, I was confused,
disgusted with the church but sensitive enough to be seeking a
rationale for my existence: I was bound up in fabricated systems
that tried to explain life, tried to relieve the insecurity of not know
ing why you exist.
Understanding Infinity
"I discovered that I had not known what infinity meant. I took
LSD and understood. I saw the world as I had never seen it before.
People became infinite in themselves. The human personality, which
psychiatrists try to put in little boxes and compartments, became
something infinite, beautiful, something that is . I saw the isness of
things, of the universe. I understood what it meant to become aware
of every grain of sand on every beach in the world.
"I am becoming aware of the incomprehensibility of existence —
and also of the limitations of the self. It's not an answer, it's
a perspective — but that perspective is the answer. I am more
confident now, more prepared — even to die.
"Another time I took LSD with several people, and this time
the communication was verbal. We talked about the El Camino Real
side of existence — the tedious, pointless garbage of day-to-day,
the hang-ups of relating to everyday life. It was the most lucid
discussion I've ever had with people. We were driven to understand
what each other meant. As a result I am more aware of the fact
that my personality is in every human being, in a way I had never
seen before.
Catalyst For Love
"And the communication engendered that night has continued
among us all.
"For me, there is a warm feeling when I know I've hit home,
that there really is communication with someone else, that there
is love and understanding and a sense of being in each other's
minds. Love is something inherent in every human being. But LSD
is a fantastic catalyst.
"Many people can find this without LSD. But my feelings and
emotions were repressed. LSD brought them out, helped me to
take a good look at myself, to see my limitations and repressions —
but also to forgive myself, to realize that I am in every person,
to talk about my problems, to work them out, and finally to over-
