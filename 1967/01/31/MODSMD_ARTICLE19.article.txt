# Stanford Tarzans Fall To Cal Chimps
## 
### 
California's strong gymnasts
handed Stanford its first defeat
of the season Saturday night,
177.60 to 140.00.
According to Stanford coach
John Gilmore, the Indians actu
ally put forth their best effort
of the season despite the fact
that it wasn't the best score.
P-Bar Better
Best improvement was shown
in the parallel bars where the
Cards amassed 24.3 points.
Sophomores John Marks, Jim
Snyder and Jim Petersen scored
5.25, 8.2 and 7.85, respectively,
in their best outing of the year.
Gilmore was also pleased with
the performances on the rings.
Again it was Marks who led the
Indians as he performed a very
fine routine which included a
f louble somersault dismount, a
new trick in his routine.
Petersen Leads Scoring
Petersen led the Cards' scor
ing again as he scored 43.05
in all-around. His best efforts
came in the long horse, 8.85, and
floor exercise, 8.2.
Stanford's weak events in this
meet (as they have been all
season) were the trampoline,
horizontal bar and side horse.
Gilmore is convinced that the
Indians can improve at least
three points in each event.
If they do manage to add

throe points to each of the three
events, then the team would be
scoring right around 150 points
per meet, which would put them
in a good position to knock off
the better share of their oppon
ents.
Frosh Fall
The California fresmen team
also beat Stanford in their meet,
131 to 97.7.
As was expected, the story of
the meet was just a matter of
filling all the positions. Whereas
Stanford left six spots open, the
Bears filled all but two.
Had the Indians been able to
fill all the events with three
men, it probably would have
been a very close meet.
Craig Dickson turned in the
best performance for any of the
Cards as he scored a 9.0 on the
long horse.
Sac State Next
Saturday the Indians will
meet Sacramento State and Uni
versity of California, Davis.
Gilmore expects his gymnasts
to beat the brand new Davis
team and to give Sac State a
good meet. Sac State has been
scoring around 150 this season
compared to Stanford's 140.
Sac State's two outstanding
performers are Dave Niemend,
who has scored 9.5 on the hori
zontal bar and Steve Pleau, who
has scored 49 points overall.

California's strong gymnasts
handed Stanford its first defeat
of the season Saturday night,
177.60 to 140.00.
According to Stanford coach
John Gilmore, the Indians actu
ally put forth their best effort
of the season despite the fact
that it wasn't the best score.
P-Bar Better
Best improvement was shown
in the parallel bars where the
Cards amassed 24.3 points.
Sophomores John Marks, Jim
Snyder and Jim Petersen scored
5.25, 8.2 and 7.85, respectively,
in their best outing of the year.
Gilmore was also pleased with
the performances on the rings.
Again it was Marks who led the
Indians as he performed a very
fine routine which included a
f louble somersault dismount, a
new trick in his routine.
Petersen Leads Scoring
Petersen led the Cards' scor
ing again as he scored 43.05
in all-around. His best efforts
came in the long horse, 8.85, and
floor exercise, 8.2.
Stanford's weak events in this
meet (as they have been all
season) were the trampoline,
horizontal bar and side horse.
Gilmore is convinced that the
Indians can improve at least
three points in each event.
If they do manage to add

throe points to each of the three
events, then the team would be
scoring right around 150 points
per meet, which would put them
in a good position to knock off
the better share of their oppon
ents.
Frosh Fall
The California fresmen team
also beat Stanford in their meet,
131 to 97.7.
As was expected, the story of
the meet was just a matter of
filling all the positions. Whereas
Stanford left six spots open, the
Bears filled all but two.
Had the Indians been able to
fill all the events with three
men, it probably would have
been a very close meet.
Craig Dickson turned in the
best performance for any of the
Cards as he scored a 9.0 on the
long horse.
Sac State Next
Saturday the Indians will
meet Sacramento State and Uni
versity of California, Davis.
Gilmore expects his gymnasts
to beat the brand new Davis
team and to give Sac State a
good meet. Sac State has been
scoring around 150 this season
compared to Stanford's 140.
Sac State's two outstanding
performers are Dave Niemend,
who has scored 9.5 on the hori
zontal bar and Steve Pleau, who
has scored 49 points overall.
