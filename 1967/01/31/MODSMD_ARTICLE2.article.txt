# SYMPOSIUM
## A 						Call For Student Centered Education 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
The student must be reinstated at
the center of the university if educa
tion is to meet the challenge of future
years.
Though they presented their ideas
in a diverse fashion, this was the con
clusion reached by David Harris,
Nevitt Sanford, and William Sloane
Coffin at Sunday evening's Student-
Faculty symposium in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. TTie topic was "Can Edu
cation Meet the Challenge?"
Coffin, Yale University Chaplain, in
sisted that, "the ideas of faculty today
are intellectually competent, but his
torically insignificant." These words
set the tone of his talk.
Coffin discussed three areas of the
university: faculty, curriculum, and
extra-curricular life.
He summarized his view of a good
faculty member by saying, "They
must embody in their own lives their
own values. They must be controver
sial characters."
He also added that students should

take part in tenure deliberations and
have a word on the hiring of faculty.
He asked, "How can we expect stu
dents to be responsible if we don't
treat them in a responsible way?"
Discussing curricula, Coffin said,
"They are old fashioned. If univer
sities had taught a course in Edsels,
they'd still be teaching it." He went on
to appeal for a major in Urban Studies
and other contemporary issues.
On moral issues, Coffin said that
students shouldn't be worried about
sex as much as what vocation they
will enter. He said students should
think about what they will do with
their knowledge instead of about each
other's sex. He asked, "How are they
going to massage a piece of paper?"
Attacks Fraternities
Finally, considering extra-curricular
life, he attacked the fraternity system
and suggested co-op living as the wave
of the future. On fraternities he com
mented, "Sending an immature per
son to a fraternity and expecting him
to come out mature is like sending a

wino to a wine cellar and expecting
him to come out sober."
Coffin closed his remarks with a
quotation he had recently read: "Men
learned to swim like fish and fly
like birds, but now they must learn to
walk like men."
Dave Harris challenged the present
educational philosophy of universities.
He said, "today people are seeking to
view the university as a producer in
stead of as the home of the mind." ;
He continued, "it is not enough : ar
the university to have goals for 1 le
future. These goals must be lived in
the everyday life of the university."
University and Peace
He then cited two examples of uni
versities meaning one thing and doing
something else. "Take war. The uni
versity should be the symbol of peace,
but instead it often supplies materials
and mechanisms for war. Or take the
university community which should
be founded on egalitarian principals.
But in the university, the few govern
the many."

Developing this idea, Harris said
the university must work toward a
community that, "defines itself in
terms of itself and its purposes, not
in terms of being a servant or helper
to society."
In conclusion he said, "the challenge
of the future must be seen as a chal
lenge in the present."
Nevitt Sanford, professor of psy
chology spoke following Harris. His
major thesis was that individual de
velopment must be the center of a
university's concerns.
He appealed to colleges to fight the
trend toward specialization and help
develop in students, "the capacity to
live outside their area of work."
Integrated Personality
He said this should be done through
developing an integrated personality
in students so that, "they feel at home
within themselves."
One way to do this, he noted, would
be to breakdown the present dogma of
course structure and content. For in
stance he suggested there be fewer
lecture courses and more seminars at
Stanford and added that courses in
education should be offered on the
undergraduate level.
After the talks, students met with
the speakers in Tresidder Union.
There was also a discussion among
students and faculty at the Grove
House.

stance he suggested there be fewer
lecture courses and more seminars at
Stanford and added that courses in
education should be offered on the
undergraduate level.
After the talks, students met with
the speakers in Tresidder Union.
There was also a discussion among
students and faculty at the Grove
House.
The student must be reinstated at
the center of the university if educa
tion is to meet the challenge of future
years.
Though they presented their ideas
in a diverse fashion, this was the con
clusion reached by David Harris,
Nevitt Sanford, and William Sloane
Coffin at Sunday evening's Student-
Faculty symposium in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. TTie topic was "Can Edu
cation Meet the Challenge?"
Coffin, Yale University Chaplain, in
sisted that, "the ideas of faculty today
are intellectually competent, but his
torically insignificant." These words
set the tone of his talk.
Coffin discussed three areas of the
university: faculty, curriculum, and
extra-curricular life.
He summarized his view of a good
faculty member by saying, "They
must embody in their own lives their
own values. They must be controver
sial characters."
He also added that students should

take part in tenure deliberations and
have a word on the hiring of faculty.
He asked, "How can we expect stu
dents to be responsible if we don't
treat them in a responsible way?"
Discussing curricula, Coffin said,
"They are old fashioned. If univer
sities had taught a course in Edsels,
they'd still be teaching it." He went on
to appeal for a major in Urban Studies
and other contemporary issues.
On moral issues, Coffin said that
students shouldn't be worried about
sex as much as what vocation they
will enter. He said students should
think about what they will do with
their knowledge instead of about each
other's sex. He asked, "How are they
going to massage a piece of paper?"
Attacks Fraternities
Finally, considering extra-curricular
life, he attacked the fraternity system
and suggested co-op living as the wave
of the future. On fraternities he com
mented, "Sending an immature per
son to a fraternity and expecting him
to come out mature is like sending a

wino to a wine cellar and expecting
him to come out sober."
Coffin closed his remarks with a
quotation he had recently read: "Men
learned to swim like fish and fly
like birds, but now they must learn to
walk like men."
Dave Harris challenged the present
educational philosophy of universities.
He said, "today people are seeking to
view the university as a producer in
stead of as the home of the mind." ;
He continued, "it is not enough : ar
the university to have goals for 1 le
future. These goals must be lived in
the everyday life of the university."
University and Peace
He then cited two examples of uni
versities meaning one thing and doing
something else. "Take war. The uni
versity should be the symbol of peace,
but instead it often supplies materials
and mechanisms for war. Or take the
university community which should
be founded on egalitarian principals.
But in the university, the few govern
the many."

Developing this idea, Harris said
the university must work toward a
community that, "defines itself in
terms of itself and its purposes, not
in terms of being a servant or helper
to society."
In conclusion he said, "the challenge
of the future must be seen as a chal
lenge in the present."
Nevitt Sanford, professor of psy
chology spoke following Harris. His
major thesis was that individual de
velopment must be the center of a
university's concerns.
He appealed to colleges to fight the
trend toward specialization and help
develop in students, "the capacity to
live outside their area of work."
Integrated Personality
He said this should be done through
developing an integrated personality
in students so that, "they feel at home
within themselves."
One way to do this, he noted, would
be to breakdown the present dogma of
course structure and content. For in
stance he suggested there be fewer
lecture courses and more seminars at
Stanford and added that courses in
education should be offered on the
undergraduate level.
