set of the meet, was downed 7-4
by the California boxing team
Saturday at Berkeley.
The Tribe boxers forfeited
the lower three weight divis
ions, 125, 132, and 139, and were
never able to catch up. Stanford
has not had an entrant in the
two lowest classes this season,
and Dave Hibbitts, who usually
boxes at 139, was injured dur
ing the week's practice sessions.
The first match of the evening
saw Stanford's Bill Thomas fac
ing Dick Weinbradt, perhaps
the finest ringman of the Cal
squad. In his first match of the
season, Thomas was caught
cold with the opening barrage
of punches from the agile Wein
brandt.
Twice Down
Thomas was down twice be
fore the referee stopped the
bout and the Indians were down
4-0 after only minutes of action.
Stanford bounced back with a
victory by hard-punching Jim
Marlar in the 156 pound class.
Marlar scored an impressive win
over Jim Hoobler of Cal. The
first round of action was a
standoff, but Marlar floored
Hoobler in the second round,
with Hoobler taking a nine
count.
Marlar then outboxed his op
ponent the rest of the way to
garner his first win of the year,
having drawn his initial match
against Navy two weeks ago.
Cal's Second Win
In the second 156 pound bout
Terry Stewart of California won
a three round decision over
Stanford's agressive Barney Ad
ler. The early part of the match
was a melee, with Adler taking
the fight to Stewart.
However, Stewart rallied back
to take the second and third
rounds and the decision for the
match. Adler showed a marked
improvement in this, his second
varsity match.
The 165 pound bout was a bat
tle all the way, with Stanford's
John Price coming out on the
short end of a decision. The two
were even for the first two
rounds, but a fast finish won for
Cal's Terry Monohan.
Jenks Draws
Tom Jenks of Stanford and
Bill Neyland of Cal then boxed
a three round draw. Jenks, de
fending league champion in this
division for Stanford did not
turn in one of his better per
form ances and the rematch in
three weeks should be more of
a spirited clash.
Stanford's veteran in the 180
pound class scored an easy,
three-round win over Cal's
Webb Lloyd. Palmer, effectively
used combinations to the head

and scored well with hooks to
the body in scoring the victory.
For the second straight match
Eric DeGooyer punched his way
to a TKO. This time the victim
was Steve Spreiter of the Bears.
DeGooyer floored his opponent
with a right hand combination.
Two Rugged Rights
A right hand to the body
doubled up Spreiter and a right
hook to the chin finished the
match, though Spreiter was on
his knees when he was counted
out by the referee.
Dave Oswald of Stanford and
Ron Dell'lmmagine boxed a
three-round draw to end the
card. The decision was not a
popular one, as Oswald had

forced the fight for most of the
way. This was Oswald's sccond
draw decision of the season.
After the matches, Coach Ray
Lunny of Stanford commented,"
Of course giving up three points
is a difficult thing to do. How
ever I feel we have shown a lot
of improvement over the first
match of the season two weeks
ago."
The Indians face Cal again on
February 16, this time at Stan
ford's Encina gym. Lunny said,
"We could beat them in the re
match, and I know we will be
ready to turn the tables."
The team meets the Univer

by the California boxing team
Saturday at Berkeley.

the lower three weight divis
ions, 125, 132, and 139, and were
never able to catch up. Stanford

two lowest classes this season,
and Dave Hibbitts, who usually
boxes at 139, was injured dur
ing the week's practice sessions.
The first match of the evening
saw Stanford's Bill Thomas fac
ing Dick Weinbradt, perhaps
the finest ringman of the Cal
squad. In his first match of the
season, Thomas was caught
cold with the opening barrage
of punches from the agile Wein
brandt.
Twice Down
Thomas was down twice be
fore the referee stopped the
bout and the Indians were down
4-0 after only minutes of action.

standoff, but Marlar floored
Hoobler in the second round,
with Hoobler taking a nine
count.

ponent the rest of the way to
garner his first win of the year,
having drawn his initial match
against Navy two weeks ago.
Cal's Second Win
In the second 156 pound bout
Terry Stewart of California won
a three round decision over
Stanford's agressive Barney Ad
ler. The early part of the match
was a melee, with Adler taking
the fight to Stewart.
However, Stewart rallied back
to take the second and third
rounds and the decision for the
match. Adler showed a marked
improvement in this, his second
varsity match.
The 165 pound bout was a bat
tle all the way, with Stanford's
John Price coming out on the
short end of a decision. The two
were even for the first two
rounds, but a fast finish won for
Cal's Terry Monohan.
Jenks Draws
Tom Jenks of Stanford and
Bill Neyland of Cal then boxed
a three round draw. Jenks, de
fending league champion in this
division for Stanford did not
turn in one of his better per
form ances and the rematch in
three weeks should be more of
a spirited clash.
Stanford's veteran in the 180
pound class scored an easy,
three-round win over Cal's
Webb Lloyd. Palmer, effectively
used combinations to the head

and scored well with hooks to
the body in scoring the victory.
For the second straight match
Eric DeGooyer punched his way
to a TKO. This time the victim
was Steve Spreiter of the Bears.
DeGooyer floored his opponent
with a right hand combination.

hook to the chin finished the
match, though Spreiter was on
his knees when he was counted
out by the referee.
Dave Oswald of Stanford and
Ron Dell'lmmagine boxed a
three-round draw to end the
card. The decision was not a
popular one, as Oswald had

forced the fight for most of the
way. This was Oswald's sccond
draw decision of the season.
After the matches, Coach Ray
Lunny of Stanford commented,"
