# Student Non-Power
## 
### 
The perennial problem of student involve
ment in University affairs has come up again.
Vice-Provost Herbert Packer has announced
that he will not let students select student mem
bers of the Executive Committee for the forth
coming study of Stanford's educational pro
grams.
On January 18, President Sterling issued a
letter inviting students to serve on the Execu
tive Committee. The next day Legislature pass
ed a resolution asking that student members
be selected by the ASSU President, with the
approval of Legislature, rather than by Presi
dent Sterling. Packer rejected the idea, insisting
that selection be made by Robert Hind, Asso
ciate Dean of Undergraduate Education, and
himself. He later agreed to let the ASSU Presi
dent and the Speaker of Legislature "advise"
them on the selection of student members. Then
last Thursday, LASSU voted to circulate a peti
tion proposing that student members of the
committee be selected by two students chosen
by Legislature and two administrators, pre
sumably Packer and Hind.
Packer has said that student selection of the
students for this committee would give the
study a political nature. We question Packer's
definition of "political" issues. Is a non-political
question one that the administration can decide
by itself? Does an issue become political simply
because students disagree with the administra
tion's point of view or with the status quo? The
University cannot hope to deal only with so
called non-political issues in this study; for one,
it insists that off campus housing for women be
considered by the study.
The real issue at hand, however, is more fun
damental than semantic bickering might indi
cate. Once again the administration has blatant
ly rejected the existence of the student body as
an equal constituency on this campus and has
refused to recognize its right to a part in the
decisions that concern it. As long as the admini
stration continues to appoint students to its com
mittees, there can be no effective participation
by the students in the decision-making process
in the University.

We concede that Packer and Hind are sin
cerely interested in soliciting a wide variety of
ideas for their study, but we insist that diversity
can be assured on the committee only if there
is diversity among the selectors. Prof. Packer's
fear that students will exercise the veto power
if they are allowed to participate in the forma
tion of a consensus is not valid; the Committee
of 15 has shown that students and administra
tors can effectively work together.
Ideally, we would suggest that all members
of the Executive Committee be selected by a
tripartite committee consisting of students, fa
culty, and administration. We reluctantly ac
cept the present impossibility of implementing
this approach, and suggest that instead two stu
dents serve on the selection committee on an
equal basis with Packer and Hind.
Packer's offer to let students "advise" them in
the selection of committee members is not a
convincing compromise; he is asking students to
trust him while refusing to reciprocate.
The students on the Executive Committee
must feel an identification with the student
body. We are not suggesting that LASSU have
the power either to recall or to instruct them.
But students should sit on a University com
mittee because they tire students, rather than
on an administration committee because it has
invited them. Students on the committee should
owe allegiance neither to the student body nor
to the administration. Their primary concern
should be to assure that ideas will be heard
from all segments of the University and that
their reports are in the best interest of the entire
community.
The new study is a much needed re-evalua
tion of Stanford education. We would like to
see the administration demonstrate the sincerity
implied by President Sterling's concern for as
suring "the broadest possible basis for selecting
the student members." We urge all students to
sign the petitions being circulated by Legisla
ture representatives in the hope that Packer and
Hind will reconsider their position.
We do not believe that one segment of the
University should rim it while others just help.
