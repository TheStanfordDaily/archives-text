# Letters To The Editor
## Rising TMU Costs Challenged By Petition 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Not again! Yes, Tresidder has
done it again — June, Septem
ber, and January have seen the
food prices in Tresidder raised!
You too can now buy a roll for
20 cents, peas for 20 cents, and
soup for 35 cents — to name
some in the recent move.
I get the feeling that profit off
students is a motive and an ac
tuality, whereas, as I see it, a
union should strive toward stu
dent service without seeking
profits.
Sign the petition which is cur
rently being circulated to protest
the January increases and re
quest a return to pre-January
prices if you disagree with
Tresidder's move.

Editor, The Daily:
One cannot help wondering
what Mr. Jan Kerr Eckbo did
with his apple core. Dispensing
with the unfortunate sentimen
tality of Mr. Eckbo's "Appetiz
ing Situation at TMU," I would
like to get to the cause of his
problem.
The debris which Mr. Eckbo
encountered was not left there
by the Tresidder Union em
ployee whom he offensively and
unjustly equates with a garbage
collector. It was left there by
his noble fellow patrons who
are hardened to the spectacle
of their own mess by a progres
sively unreasonable resistance
to Smokey-the-Bear and Litter
bug pleas, and softened to a tol
eration of it by the unfortunate
maturational circumstance of
not having progressed beyond
the infantile diaper-age stage
during which everyone else
cleans up after them.
I point to the Medical School
cafeteria as having a system
that provides us with a model
for the solution to the problem
at Tresidder. The patrons there
are requested to return used
trays with empty dishes and
leftover food to a disposal rack,
supplemented by a conveyer
belt during rush hours. I would
like to see this system put into
immediate effect at Tresidder,

with Mr. Eckbo at the head of
the line setting his uncivilized
example.
It is not too much to ask our
selves to cooperate in a small
measure of self-discipline that
would reflect not only respect
for others but also self-respect
—not to mention the joy of
always being able to come to
a clean table as well as that
of leaving a clean place behind
us. Of course the dogs might go
hungry, but then they shouldn't
be eating potato chips and pick
les anyway.
As for the congestion at the
food counter, we have a choice
of self-disciplined turn-taking or
long-line waiting. The space
limitation makes the choice of
the present system most reason
able. Control of the objection
able aspects lies within the po
liteness of the patrons. We
would do well if we only match
ed the courtesy uniformly dis
played by the Tresidder cafe
teria employees.

• Rubbish
Editor, The Daily:
As one who has grown sick of
the amount of rubbish that has
been thrown around on the
question of hereditary intelli
gence by so-called scholars and
speculators alike, it is with great
reluctance that I even bother to
make the following observation.
It does not take a Nobel Prize
winner to realize that the lowest
level of the Army, Navy, or any
other related military group is
not the best field of operation for
anyone seeking intelligence.
Without seemingly insulting the
military, it is an obvious fact
that given the draft system the
composition of the recruits tends
to lead us to precisely the oppo
site conclusion.
What is surprising is that
those seeking evidence to justify
their intellectual shortcomings
often find it necessary to avoid
the obvious sources. Those inter
ested in proving inherent Negro
inferiority might consider test
ing white and African children
of diplomats attending schools
together in the many capitals of
the world. For one thing this will
provide Negro subjects who

have not been subjected to the
crippling mental (not material)
environment which invariably
affects every American Negro
child. In fact why not a com
parison of the performance of
African students with that of
their American counterparts in
the universities?
Finally, Prof. Shockley does
not need me to tell him about
the inadequacies of the so-called
intelligence tests. I am yet to
find one that really makes sense.
Unfortunately, even the Nobel
Prize has proved not to be a good
test of intelligence.

• IQ Tyranny
Editor, The Daily:
Granted that population limi
tation may eventually be neces
sary, any program which would

apply this limitation only to a
certain segment of humanity,
to be chosen on the basis of a
set of values held only by an
other, limited, segment of hu
manity, would be intolerable
tyranny.
The suggestion that I.Q.
should be the basis for such a
program is despicable egotism.
Almost no one judges the qual
ity of another's life on the basis
of his ability to solve problems;
surely qualities such as warmth,
humility, compassion are those
that are really used, even by the
most cynical. If men should ever
attempt the contradiction of es
tablishing a program of eugenics
based on these criteria, it's quite
possible that more than one
Nobel Laureate would be at the
head of the vasectomy line.

sary, any program which would

apply this limitation only to a
certain segment of humanity,
to be chosen on the basis of a

manity, would be intolerable
tyranny.

should be the basis for such a

Almost no one judges the qual
ity of another's life on the basis
of his ability to solve problems;
surely qualities such as warmth,

Editor, The Daily:
Not again! Yes, Tresidder has
done it again — June, Septem
ber, and January have seen the
food prices in Tresidder raised!
You too can now buy a roll for
20 cents, peas for 20 cents, and
soup for 35 cents — to name
some in the recent move.
I get the feeling that profit off
students is a motive and an ac
tuality, whereas, as I see it, a
union should strive toward stu
dent service without seeking
profits.
Sign the petition which is cur
rently being circulated to protest
the January increases and re
quest a return to pre-January
prices if you disagree with
Tresidder's move.

Editor, The Daily:
One cannot help wondering
what Mr. Jan Kerr Eckbo did
with his apple core. Dispensing
with the unfortunate sentimen
tality of Mr. Eckbo's "Appetiz
ing Situation at TMU," I would
like to get to the cause of his
problem.
The debris which Mr. Eckbo
encountered was not left there
by the Tresidder Union em
ployee whom he offensively and
unjustly equates with a garbage
collector. It was left there by
his noble fellow patrons who
are hardened to the spectacle
of their own mess by a progres
sively unreasonable resistance
to Smokey-the-Bear and Litter
bug pleas, and softened to a tol
eration of it by the unfortunate
maturational circumstance of
not having progressed beyond
the infantile diaper-age stage
during which everyone else
cleans up after them.
I point to the Medical School
cafeteria as having a system
that provides us with a model
for the solution to the problem
at Tresidder. The patrons there
are requested to return used
trays with empty dishes and
leftover food to a disposal rack,
supplemented by a conveyer
belt during rush hours. I would
like to see this system put into
immediate effect at Tresidder,

with Mr. Eckbo at the head of
the line setting his uncivilized
example.
It is not too much to ask our
selves to cooperate in a small
measure of self-discipline that
would reflect not only respect
for others but also self-respect
—not to mention the joy of
always being able to come to
a clean table as well as that
of leaving a clean place behind
us. Of course the dogs might go
hungry, but then they shouldn't
be eating potato chips and pick
les anyway.
As for the congestion at the
food counter, we have a choice
of self-disciplined turn-taking or
long-line waiting. The space
limitation makes the choice of
the present system most reason
able. Control of the objection
able aspects lies within the po
liteness of the patrons. We
would do well if we only match
ed the courtesy uniformly dis
played by the Tresidder cafe
teria employees.

Editor, The Daily:
As one who has grown sick of
the amount of rubbish that has
been thrown around on the
question of hereditary intelli
gence by so-called scholars and
speculators alike, it is with great
reluctance that I even bother to
make the following observation.
It does not take a Nobel Prize
winner to realize that the lowest
level of the Army, Navy, or any
other related military group is
not the best field of operation for
anyone seeking intelligence.
Without seemingly insulting the
military, it is an obvious fact
that given the draft system the
composition of the recruits tends
to lead us to precisely the oppo
site conclusion.
What is surprising is that
those seeking evidence to justify
their intellectual shortcomings
often find it necessary to avoid
the obvious sources. Those inter
ested in proving inherent Negro
inferiority might consider test
ing white and African children
of diplomats attending schools
together in the many capitals of
the world. For one thing this will
provide Negro subjects who

have not been subjected to the
crippling mental (not material)
environment which invariably
affects every American Negro
child. In fact why not a com
parison of the performance of
African students with that of
their American counterparts in
the universities?
Finally, Prof. Shockley does
not need me to tell him about
the inadequacies of the so-called
intelligence tests. I am yet to
find one that really makes sense.
Unfortunately, even the Nobel
Prize has proved not to be a good
test of intelligence.

of diplomats attending schools
together in the many capitals of
the world. For one thing this will
provide Negro subjects who

• IQ Tyranny
Editor, The Daily:
Granted that population limi
tation may eventually be neces
sary, any program which would

apply this limitation only to a
certain segment of humanity,
to be chosen on the basis of a
set of values held only by an
other, limited, segment of hu
manity, would be intolerable
tyranny.
The suggestion that I.Q.
should be the basis for such a
program is despicable egotism.
Almost no one judges the qual
ity of another's life on the basis
of his ability to solve problems;
surely qualities such as warmth,
humility, compassion are those
that are really used, even by the
most cynical. If men should ever
attempt the contradiction of es
tablishing a program of eugenics
based on these criteria, it's quite
possible that more than one
Nobel Laureate would be at the
head of the vasectomy line.
JOHN CANN
Editor, The Daily:
Not again! Yes, Tresidder has
done it again — June, Septem
ber, and January have seen the
food prices in Tresidder raised!
You too can now buy a roll for
20 cents, peas for 20 cents, and
soup for 35 cents — to name
some in the recent move.
I get the feeling that profit off
students is a motive and an ac
tuality, whereas, as I see it, a
union should strive toward stu
dent service without seeking
profits.
Sign the petition which is cur
rently being circulated to protest
the January increases and re
quest a return to pre-January
prices if you disagree with
Tresidder's move.

• Messy Us
Editor, The Daily:
One cannot help wondering
what Mr. Jan Kerr Eckbo did
with his apple core. Dispensing
with the unfortunate sentimen
tality of Mr. Eckbo's "Appetiz
ing Situation at TMU," I would
like to get to the cause of his
problem.
The debris which Mr. Eckbo
encountered was not left there
by the Tresidder Union em
ployee whom he offensively and
unjustly equates with a garbage
collector. It was left there by
his noble fellow patrons who
are hardened to the spectacle
of their own mess by a progres
sively unreasonable resistance
to Smokey-the-Bear and Litter
bug pleas, and softened to a tol
eration of it by the unfortunate
maturational circumstance of
not having progressed beyond
the infantile diaper-age stage
during which everyone else
cleans up after them.
I point to the Medical School
cafeteria as having a system
that provides us with a model
for the solution to the problem
at Tresidder. The patrons there
are requested to return used
trays with empty dishes and
leftover food to a disposal rack,
supplemented by a conveyer
belt during rush hours. I would
like to see this system put into
immediate effect at Tresidder,

with Mr. Eckbo at the head of
the line setting his uncivilized
example.
It is not too much to ask our
selves to cooperate in a small
measure of self-discipline that
would reflect not only respect
for others but also self-respect
—not to mention the joy of
always being able to come to
a clean table as well as that
of leaving a clean place behind
us. Of course the dogs might go
hungry, but then they shouldn't
be eating potato chips and pick
les anyway.
As for the congestion at the
food counter, we have a choice
of self-disciplined turn-taking or
long-line waiting. The space
limitation makes the choice of
the present system most reason
able. Control of the objection
able aspects lies within the po
liteness of the patrons. We
would do well if we only match
ed the courtesy uniformly dis
played by the Tresidder cafe
teria employees.

• Rubbish
Editor, The Daily:
As one who has grown sick of
the amount of rubbish that has
been thrown around on the
question of hereditary intelli
gence by so-called scholars and
speculators alike, it is with great
reluctance that I even bother to
make the following observation.
It does not take a Nobel Prize
winner to realize that the lowest
level of the Army, Navy, or any
other related military group is
not the best field of operation for
anyone seeking intelligence.
Without seemingly insulting the
military, it is an obvious fact
that given the draft system the
composition of the recruits tends
to lead us to precisely the oppo
site conclusion.
What is surprising is that
those seeking evidence to justify
their intellectual shortcomings
often find it necessary to avoid
the obvious sources. Those inter
ested in proving inherent Negro
inferiority might consider test
ing white and African children
of diplomats attending schools
together in the many capitals of
the world. For one thing this will
provide Negro subjects who

have not been subjected to the
