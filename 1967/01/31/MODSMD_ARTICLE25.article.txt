# Burger Price Hike: Side Effect Of War
## 
### BOB EWEGEN Editor, Colorado DAILY 
It's a little thing, really. Mc-
Donald's hamburger stand, that
infinite oasis of quickly served
15-cent hamburgers, has fallen
victim to the Great Society.
They have raised their prices to
18 cents. A little thing, really,
but for so long they stood as a
symbol of man's ability to re
sist the opportunity to gouge
his neighbor. Then they too fell
beneath inexorable economic
forces and raised their prices by
20 per cent. A little thing, real
ly, and it began as a little thing
too.
A little thing. Some idiot in a
godforsaken corner of the world
shooting at some other idiot. A
little thing. Then some idiot in
Washington deciding we should
send an advisor to advise one of
the idiots on how better to kill
the other idiot. Still a little thing.
Little No Longer
Then suddenly it wasn't a little
thing and we had half a million
of our own kith and kin no long
er advising but shooting and dy

ing in earnest and spending an
extra 20 to 25 billion dollars a
year doing it. This sent economy
out of whack, triggered an in
flationary spiral and increased
the cost of everything from ham
burger to housing to non-ferrous
metals. A big thing.
And now even McDonald's
hamburger, the very symbol of
the cheap albeit not free lunch,
has caved in. No doubt they will
claim rising costs due to general
inflation and no doubt they'll be
right. And it all began as such
a little thing.
We fear that it is only a mat
ter of time before even Griff's
burger bar follows suit and the
15 cent hamburger will go the
way of the passenger pigeon,
the dodo bird and a rational
American foreign policy.
We've said it before and we'll
say it again. People used to look
at you when you grumbled about
Vietnam and mockingly retort,
"What's that got to do with the
price of beans in Boston?"
Well, like we said before, now
you know.

but for so long they stood as a
symbol of man's ability to re
sist the opportunity to gouge
his neighbor. Then they too fell
beneath inexorable economic
forces and raised their prices by
20 per cent. A little thing, real
ly, and it began as a little thing
too.
A little thing. Some idiot in a
godforsaken corner of the world
shooting at some other idiot. A
little thing. Then some idiot in
Washington deciding we should
send an advisor to advise one of
the idiots on how better to kill
the other idiot. Still a little thing.
Little No Longer
Then suddenly it wasn't a little
thing and we had half a million
of our own kith and kin no long
er advising but shooting and dy

ing in earnest and spending an
extra 20 to 25 billion dollars a
year doing it. This sent economy
out of whack, triggered an in
flationary spiral and increased
the cost of everything from ham
burger to housing to non-ferrous
metals. A big thing.
And now even McDonald's
hamburger, the very symbol of
the cheap albeit not free lunch,
has caved in. No doubt they will
claim rising costs due to general
inflation and no doubt they'll be
right. And it all began as such
a little thing.
We fear that it is only a mat
ter of time before even Griff's
burger bar follows suit and the
15 cent hamburger will go the
way of the passenger pigeon,
the dodo bird and a rational
American foreign policy.
We've said it before and we'll
say it again. People used to look
at you when you grumbled about
Vietnam and mockingly retort,
"What's that got to do with the
price of beans in Boston?"
Well, like we said before, now
you know.
