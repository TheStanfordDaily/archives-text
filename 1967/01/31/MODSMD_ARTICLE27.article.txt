# Today And Tomorrow
## LBJ Eases Budget Past Record Peak 
### Walter Lippmann 
Compared with last year's
budget, the present one is a re
freshingly straightforward piece
of estimating and accounting.
Gone is the absurd assump
tion made last year that the war
in Vietnam would be over
by this summer. Because of this
assumption last year's (1967)
budget estimated that the cost
of the war would be $10.5 bil
lion. It is now calculated that
the war is actually costing near
ly twice as much—sl9.9 billion.
As a result, the administration
is compelled to ask for a sup
plemental defense appropriation
of $12.3 billion.
The false estimate in last
year's budget is one of the prin
cipal items in the credibility
gap. We have now an attempt
to make a truer estimate, an
attempt, that is, to forecast ex
penditures 18 months ahead.

The 1968 estimates, says the
President in his message, put
defense requirements for the
next 18 months "on a continuing
basis, including the possibility
of an extension of combat be
yond the end of the fiscal year"
(June 30, 1968).
In explaining the budget to
the press on Jan. 23, a defense
official said that "We have pre
pared the budget on the assump
tion that the conflict will go on
indefinitely." This may not be
cheering, but it is sound.
Gone also from the new bud
get is most of the phoniness of
last year's State of the Union
message in which the country
was told that we could fight the
Vietnamese war and build the
Great Society at one and the
same time.
Great Society Loses
Last year's budget message,
to be sure, was a good deal more
sober and less rhetorical than
that. This year both the mes
sage on the State of the Union
and the budget deflate the prom
ise to build the Great Society in
wartime.
The 1968 budget promises to
carry on the welfare programs,
but not to expand and accelerate
them as originally intended. The
estimates are consistent with a
pause for the re-examination of
the welfare programs.
On the explosive question of
attempting to construct an anti
missile defense the President
has proceeded with prudence,
starting from the fact that,
while it may conceivably be pos
sible to invent a reliable anti
missile defense, no such anti
missile defense actually exists
today, here or in Russia.
For Nuclear Defense
He asks for $421 million for
further research and develop
ment in this field. But he ad
heres firmly to the tested and
proven defense against nuclear
attack which is to maintain de
terrent power—that is to say, to
be able to retaliate decisively
after an attack has been
launched.
Consequently, he asks for
$326 million to convert submar
ines to carry the Poseidon, the
missile "designed to increase
significantly our ability to pene
trate an aggressor's defense."
This is coupled with the at
tempt, which is in able hands, to
negotiate with the Soviet gov
ernment a standstill agreement
on nuclear defense against mis
siles. This would be to prevent
another upward spiral in the
costs and dangers of the nuclear
conflict. Here the President has
acted with understanding and
good sense.
Realistic Aims
The reassuring characteristic
of the budget is that it is real
istic, candid and modest in its
claims and promises. There are
some who are interpreting this
change of mood to mean that
the President has grimly re
solved to pursue military victory
and to abandon the quest for a
negotiated settlement.
Without professing to know
what he really thinks in the
privacy of his mind, I see no
reason why realism and candor
about the war itself are not
compatible with, indeed neces
sary to, realism and candor
about the purposes and pros
pects of the war.

As a result, the administration
is compelled to ask for a sup

of $12.3 billion.
The false estimate in last
year's budget is one of the prin

gap. We have now an attempt
to make a truer estimate, an
attempt, that is, to forecast ex

The 1968 estimates, says the
President in his message, put
defense requirements for the
next 18 months "on a continuing
basis, including the possibility
of an extension of combat be
yond the end of the fiscal year"
(June 30, 1968).
In explaining the budget to
the press on Jan. 23, a defense
official said that "We have pre

Gone also from the new bud
get is most of the phoniness of
last year's State of the Union
message in which the country
was told that we could fight the
Vietnamese war and build the
Great Society at one and the
same time.
Great Society Loses
Last year's budget message,
to be sure, was a good deal more
sober and less rhetorical than
that. This year both the mes
sage on the State of the Union
and the budget deflate the prom
ise to build the Great Society in
wartime.
The 1968 budget promises to
carry on the welfare programs,
but not to expand and accelerate
them as originally intended. The
estimates are consistent with a
pause for the re-examination of
the welfare programs.
On the explosive question of
attempting to construct an anti
missile defense the President
has proceeded with prudence,
starting from the fact that,
while it may conceivably be pos
sible to invent a reliable anti
missile defense, no such anti
missile defense actually exists
today, here or in Russia.
For Nuclear Defense
He asks for $421 million for
further research and develop
ment in this field. But he ad
heres firmly to the tested and
proven defense against nuclear
attack which is to maintain de
terrent power—that is to say, to
be able to retaliate decisively
after an attack has been
launched.
Consequently, he asks for
$326 million to convert submar
ines to carry the Poseidon, the
missile "designed to increase
significantly our ability to pene
trate an aggressor's defense."
This is coupled with the at
tempt, which is in able hands, to
negotiate with the Soviet gov
ernment a standstill agreement
on nuclear defense against mis
siles. This would be to prevent
another upward spiral in the
costs and dangers of the nuclear
conflict. Here the President has
acted with understanding and
good sense.
Realistic Aims
The reassuring characteristic
of the budget is that it is real
istic, candid and modest in its
claims and promises. There are
some who are interpreting this
change of mood to mean that
the President has grimly re
solved to pursue military victory
and to abandon the quest for a
negotiated settlement.
Without professing to know
what he really thinks in the
privacy of his mind, I see no
reason why realism and candor
about the war itself are not
compatible with, indeed neces
sary to, realism and candor
about the purposes and pros
pects of the war.
Compared with last year's
budget, the present one is a re
freshingly straightforward piece
of estimating and accounting.
Gone is the absurd assump
tion made last year that the war
in Vietnam would be over
by this summer. Because of this
assumption last year's (1967)
budget estimated that the cost
of the war would be $10.5 bil
lion. It is now calculated that
the war is actually costing near
ly twice as much—sl9.9 billion.
As a result, the administration
