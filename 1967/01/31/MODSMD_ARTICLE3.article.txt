# Assemblyman Believes Penalties Ineffective Curb Of Drug Usage
## 
### 
Stiff criminal penalties have been
ineffective in stopping "staggering" in
creases of drug usage among teen
agers and college students, reported
Assemblyman Craig Biddle in a panel
discussion here on "Drugs and the
Law."
Biddle, chairman of the Assembly
Committee on Criminal Procedure,
noted that criminal penalties for the
sale of marijuana are higher than
those for first-degree murder.
Explaining this phenomenon, he
said that in the eyes of many indivi
duals, all drug users are depraved in
dividuals who run around looting, rap
ing and assaulting â€” and the only
solution is to lock them up indefi
nitely.
"When newspapers and politicians
talk about increasing rates of drug
abuse, the public automatically as
sumes that this means an increase in
crime and violence."
A Medical Problem
But in reality, he added, "use of
drugs does not always lead to criminal
behavior. The threat is often to the

health and seanity of the individual
rather than to society, and the treat
ment prescribed should be medical
rather than criminal."
The problems caused by dangerous
drugs, he concluded, cannot be solved
by the law alone. His committee will
soon issue a report recommending
more research, public education, and
medical approaches to drug use. He
also said the present penalties for
drug use will be reviewed.
But, he added, "whether we like
the law or not, we have to abide by it."
Criminal Offense
Laws enacted by the last session of
the Legislature make possession of
LSD for personal use a criminal of
fense. Biddle was the leader of the at
tempt to remove this provision and
make California conform with fed
eral law.
"I got more pressure on the LSD
bill than any other bill in my life," he
reported. "Every paper except one and
every TV station taking a stand op
posed my position.
"It will take at least a year or two

to develop data demonstrating that
heavy sanctions against individual
users are not effective," he concluded,
"but time is on my side."
