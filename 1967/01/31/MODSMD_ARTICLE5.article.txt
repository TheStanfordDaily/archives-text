# New Rush Plan Approved; Provides Informal Contact
## 
### SANDY SHAPIRO Associate Editor 
The recommendations of the Ad
Hoc Committee on Rush were ap
proved yesterday by the Associated
Dean of Students for Counseling and
Resident Education.
The new rush schedule includes
meal exchanges, open houses spread
out over a longer period of time than
last year, and informal open after
noons. According to committee chair
man Lawrence Bennigson, faculty
resident in Rinconada, the plan is de
signed to enable both rushees and liv
ing group members to have more in
formal contact.
Bennigson explained that in the
past "rush has been too short and
the events were too structured. Our
working philosophy has been to alle
viate these problems so that there is
more time and that the time avail
able provides a variety of situations."
During the third and fourth weeks

of this quarter a one-way meal ex
change program has been in progress.
During this period each Wilbur house
entertains about six representa
tives from Stern, eating clubs, and
fraternities. The presidents of Inter-
Club Council, Inter-Fraternity Coun
cil, and Inter-Wilbur Council co-ordin
ate this program.
Two-way meal exchanges have be
gun this week. For two weeks inter
ested freshmen will have the oppor
tunity to visit various living groups
as many times as possible. Visitors
will be assigned to houses and clubs
by a coordinating committee.
In order to defray expenses the
visited group will send a number of
members equal to the number of
guests to Wilbur.
Open houses will begin on Febru
ary 7 and will extend from 7:15 p.m.
until 9:45. A poll conducted last year
indicated that freshmen preferred
having eating club and fraternity
open houses on different evenings, so
these functions will be staggered over
two weeks. Each club will host two
open houses and each fraternity
three.
Diversified Contact
"Hopefully this early part of rush
will encourage diversified contact
with living groups. It will be possible
for a freshman to visit the clusters on
one night and the remainder of the
houses on the other two nights," Ben
nigson said.
One of the major innovations in
this year's rush will begin on Wednes
day, February 15, Bennigson said.
Between the hours of 1:00 p.m. and
5:00 p.m. on specified days, eating
clubs, fraternities, and Stern houses
will participate in informal open
afternoons."
Also beginning on February 15, liv

ing groups may invite freshmen to
meals or other informal activities at
any time. The number of freshmen
at any time in any one living group
will be restricted to five except dur
ing scheduled open houses. In order
to eliminate financial competition for
meal guests, no more than five fresh
men per day may eat at a living
group or club, Bennigson added.
Two Parties
The first week of Spring Quarter
each group will have one additional
open house and may hold parties on
Friday, April 7 and Saturday, April
8. These parties are the only functions
which may be conducted off campus
and at which liquor may be served.
Formal bids may be given out after
the beginning of the first party.
Bid cards may not be signed be
fore Monday, April 17. This will allow
recipients "one week and a weekend
to make a calm, rational, and sober
decision," added Bennigson.
Equal Chance
Except for scheduled meal ex
changes and for purposes of provid
ing transportation for freshmen, there
should be no contact between living
group representatives and freshmen
in the context of Wilbur or Stern
Halls. "All of these regulations are
devised to insure that all freshmen
have an equal chance to see all the
living groups and vice versa," Ben
nigson summarized. "It is as much
a responsibility for freshmen to re
spect these procedures as it is to re
group members."
The Jul hoc committee which pre
sented these recommendations to
Dean Gordon consisted of the presi
dents of ICC, IFC, IHC, and IWC;
eight students; one representative
from the administration; and faculty
residents from one of the fraternity
clusters, Wilbur, and Stern.
