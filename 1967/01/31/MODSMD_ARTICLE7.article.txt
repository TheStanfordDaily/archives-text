## 
### GAIL ANDERSON 
The growing and complex contro
versy over LSD has recently gener
ated a "number of discussions at Stan
ford on various aspects of the prob
lem, culminating in the recent Tre
sidder Union series. In order to pre
sent some further views and new
approaches to the subject, The Daily
today is presenting a forum on the
use of psychedelic drugs.
Entitled "LSD—Who, When, Why,"
the forum appears on page three of
today's paper. Participating in the
forum are four professors and one
student. The specific question ad
dressed is "Under what circumstances
would you recommend the use of LSD
—why or why not?"

Professor Jeffery Smith offers sev
en points to consider about LSD,
ranging from the law to the fact that
the drug brings out what is latent
in a person, and ends with a surpris
ing recommendation. Dr. James Paul
sen of the Health Center makes some
suggestions as to what one cannot
expect LSD to do and follows with an
affirmation of what the drug can be.

Excerpts from the research of Pro
fessor Willis Harman demonstrate
enhancement of creativity under LSD.
His experiments show that the mental
abilities of the individual are height
ened both while on the drug and after
the experience. He suggests the use
of LSD to replace brainstorming and

other methods of problem-solving in
industry and the professions.
An interview with Dr. Jack Shelton
offers some personal observations
about the effects of the drug along
with a warning about the environ
ment in which it is taken.
Finally, a student speaks of the
way in which LSD has affected his
personality and his relationships with
other people in a second interview.
An article elsewhere in the paper
discusses the legal aspects of LSD as
presented recently in a panel discus
sion.
The group of articles is the first of
a series of similar forums on current
problems which The Daily plans to
feature every two weeks.
