# Grove Residents Enthusiastic About Coed Living
## In The Grove 
### 
Editor's note: The Grove Project
opened almost four weeks ago, and
while it is still early to evaluate the
academic program, some of the effects
of the residential experiment, also of
great significance for Stanford, can
be assessed.

Thirty-one men and 12 women have
been living in Stanford's first coedu
cational dorm for almost a month
now, and the consensus is that it en
courages more meaningful relation
ships between the sexes than segre
gated dorm life.
In fact, residents of the Grove
House are quick to praise almost
every aspect of the experiment.
"Development" is the educational
theme of the project. Depending on
the interest of the student, it will be
viewed from one of six perspectives,
in seminars on time, biology and eco
logy, education, ideology, violence, and
the culture of poverty.
Dual Awareness
A dual awareness has emerged from
the two experimental aspects of the
Grove: it focuses on education and on
life with the opposite sex. Students in
the house stress that the two are any
thing but incompatible.
"Social events as such don't allow
a boy and girl to really know each
other. Here we see fellows as they
are," said one woman resident. An
other commented, "it's great to wake

up in the morning, look out the win
dow and see men playing basketball
in the back yard. That's something
you'll never see at Flo Mo."
History professor Mark Mancall,
faculty resident of the house, theo
rized, "a less structured environment,
in which tension is lessened, seems
more conducive to study, and that's
what I hope the students will create."
Some Discontent
But some discontent exists among
the students of Grove, although it
varies in intensity and nowhere ap
pears strong. It can be traced to
several factors.
First, the House has no formal gov
ernmental procedures. Perhaps as a
result, certain of Dr. Mark Mancall's
early actions as faculty resident ap
peared arbitrary to every person inter
viewed. His immediate insistence that
women wear skirts to al! meals was
regarded by many as an imposition of
a "very personal" value judgment.
One student's remark, "we don't
know how authoritative Dr. Mancall's
going to be," reflects an uncertainty
among residents as to how much in
fluence they have a right to wield.
The choice of the 20 faculty members
of the house, for example, is essen
tially the faculty resident's task, with
student influence on the matter lim
ited to personal recommendations.
Second, open house regulations,
those under University policy, are "in

force," according to Mancall. He in
dicated, however, that he did not in
tend to police these rules, instead
leaving room for individual judgment.

One woman resident expressed re
gret that regulations along ASSU
guidelines were in fact the practice
while lip service was being paid to

University policy. Several students ex
pressed sympathy for Mancall's posi
tion, which they said was one of want
ing to endorse more liberal rules but
officially being unable to do so.
Swinging Door
Both men and women ridiculed the
function of a swinging door which
separates the small female living sec
tion from the male areas. After 11
p.m. the door swings only in one di
rection, barring entrance to the
women's section (women can enter
through another door). It was in
stalled especially for the Grove
House.
Although the male-female ratio at
Grove (40 men to 20 women) is less
pronounced than the University's
over-all 3-1 ratio, the ratio of resident
men to resident women is 31-12, little
improvement. Nine men and eight
women are associate members and
live elsewhere.
Men and women alike said the pro
portion should be equalized. One fe
male resident claimed that, because
of the present ratio, "all the discus
sions are oriented toward a man's
way of thinking." Males pointed out
that even in informal situations, a
woman member is likely to be sur
rounded by males.
Floor Plan
University authorities attributed
the necessity of this male-female ratio
to a floor plan which could not ac

commodate more women and still
maintain some degree of separation.
As recently as two months ago, the
Committee on Undergraduate Educa
tion's plan for the Grove Project in
cluded no women at all.
Among other criticisms were those
focussing on "unnecessary etiquette"
(dinner is by candlelight; ironically,
the napkins are of paper and of poor
quality) and "a seeming aura of
necessity to speak on a highly intellec
tual plane."
Self-Consclousnss
Self-consciousness has pervaded
Grove House. Residents have a strong
sense of their role in influencing the
course of coeducational living at Stan
ford. Some go so far as to predict
that if anything "goes wrong," it
could irreparably damage the future
of Stanford coeducational living.
A University administrator, how
ever, states that the Grove Project
in no way a test case to determine
whether Stanford should have coedu
cational living.
The University, acording to Robert
Hind. Associate Dean of Undergrad
uate Education, is already committed
to the principle of future coeduca
tional living in both Moore and Jacks
houses. Implementation of this prin
ciple, Hind said, does not hinge on
what happens at Grove.

Red wine, candlelight, and coed conver
sation at dinner are among the
perquisites of Grove residents. The
permanent contributions of the sylvan
setting to education are yet to be
asNo.ss<>d fully, but Initial reaction
from the participants Ls favorable.
