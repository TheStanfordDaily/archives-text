After graduation, what?
Will you begin your career as an
engineer or scientist or return to
school for an advanced degree?
You can do both at NOL ?
If you are ari engineer in the top third of your class or a scientist in the top quarter
of your class, NOL offers you the opportunity to begin your career in one of the world's
great laboratories and, at the same time, go ahead with your plans for graduate study.
