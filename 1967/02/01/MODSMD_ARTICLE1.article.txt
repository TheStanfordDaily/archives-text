# Protest Termed Beautiful
## 
### CHRIS HARTE 
"It went beautifully," was the en
thusiastic comment of B. Davie Na
pier, Dean of the Chapel, after the
Vietnam protest in Washington yes
terday.
Over 2000 clergymen, including a
Stanford delegation of Napier, Robert
McAfee Brown and Michael Novak
of thereligion department, Stuart Mc-
Lean and Richard Roe of the United
Campus Christian Ministry, and four
graduate students, kept an hour-long
silent vigil in front of the White House
and talked to Senators and Congress
men on Capitol Hill later.
"I went with the California delega
tion to meet with Senator Kuchel," Na
pier reported, "and I must say it was
n't very satisfactory. Then we had an
equally unsatisfying visit with Don
Clausen R-Crescent City) and, to as
suage our frustrations, a really won
derful talk with Phil Burton (D- San
Francisco)."
Napier said meetings had been sche
duled with 48 Senators and many more
Representatives. "It must have made,
it couldn't have missed making, some
impact on the Congress, with the
large number of interviews held this
afternoon. Churchmen are not by na
ture a very bold group, and this must
indicate a strong feeling that our gov
ernment is not making enough of an
effort to begin negotiations."
"Magnificent"
The position paper approved by the
clergymen, which was drafted by
Robert McAfee Brown, urged a cessa
tion of bombing in the North as a pre
lude to peace talks. Napier called the
paper "magnificent."
Meanwhile, a group of student lead
ers met with Secretary of State Dean
Rusk for nearly two hours and after
wards declared "our questions were
n't answered satisfactorily." David
Harris was part of the group.
Robert S. Powell, Jr., student body
president at the University of North
Carolina, said the group would next
send a message directly to President
Johnson asking for "clarification" of
the administration's Vietnam policy.
As matters now stand, he added,
the support for U.S. Vietnam policy on
campuses "will continue to be dan
gerously eroded."
The position taken by the student
group, as Powell phrased it after the
session, is that the Johnson admini
stration is pushing for "a military
solution" in Vietnam rather than giv
ing top priority to peace negotiations.
He said this would lead to more esca
lation of the confilict.
