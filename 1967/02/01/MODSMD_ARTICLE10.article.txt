# Linear Accelerator Above Expectations
## 
### 
The two-mile linear electron
accelerator has topped its design
energy of 20 billion electron
volts (20 GeV), project director
Wolfgang K. H. Panofsky an
nounced today.
The high mark of 20.159 GeV
was set at one o'clock in the
morning of Jan. 10, Professor
Panofsky said.
The event is one more in a
procession of achievements con
firming predictions of the ma
chines builders at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center (SL
AG). They performed the job
under contract with the U.S.
Atomic Energy Commission.
Late last spring the 10,000-
foot-long accelerator was first
turned on for its full length, ap
proximately four years from the
day ground was broken for it.
Last November the Stanford
physicists announced that they
had begun experiments at last.

Now operating about 80 hours
a week, the accelerator is used
about half the time for experi
ments and half for studies of its
electron beam characteristics. By
next June it is expected to be 90
per cent occupied with experi
ments.
Present investigations are of
two kinds: scattering experi
ments in which electrons bom
bard atomic nuclei to learn more
about the nuclear structure; and
experiments creating new par
ticles such as "pions" and
"kaons" that burst from nuclear
targets under electron bombard
ment, and then are used in turn
to bombard other targets.
Physicists study the interac
tions between these speeding
particles and their targets min
utely, hoping in the process to
discover more about the struc
ture of matter.
