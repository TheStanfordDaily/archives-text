# Pogo Sticks May Be Used To Explore Lunar Surface
## 
### WILLIAMSON EVERS 
Dr. Howard S. Seifert, Stan
ford professor of aeronautics
and astronautics, has developed
a concept of moon travel based
on the principle of the Pogo
stick.
The Pogo stick-like transpor
tation device would make its
first leap by employing a source
of high pressure gas, roughly
analogous to the boiler in a
steam engine. After its first
leap the system's Pogo stick
principle would enable it to
maintain a high degree of me
chanical efficiency.
The entire assembly would
consist of two space cabins, one
on either side of a hollow, 40-
foot, steel tube. Pilot and pas
senger would ride in one cabin,
while the power plant, flight
control, and life-support sys
tems would be housed in the
other.
Vaulting Pole
The cabins would ride up and
down the pole along with a pis
ton device, which would com
press the gas upon landing and
be driven up the pole by the gas
for acceleration. About 30 feet
up the pole the cabin structure
would lock into place and carry
the pole with it into the air.
At the start of the vehicle's
trajectory the pole would lean
forward at a 45-degree angle, to

give the craft its forward mo
mentum. During its 400-foot
leap, a system of gyros would
keep the cabin structure level
while the pole arced and moved
to a forward position to prepare
for landing. When the pole's
"traction foot" made contact
with the surface, it would be
leaning backward 45 degrees,
and the cabins would be near
the top. As the cabins slid
gently downward, the pole
would use its own momentum
to flip forward, positioning it
self for the next hop.
Stanford Excellent For Pogo
Professor Seifert told the
Dally yesterday: "Stanford is a
particularly good site for the
further development of this con
cept because the University is
strong in the field of gyroscop
ics, the field of dynamics of rig
id bodies, and the field of struc
tures. In addition, it is fortunate
that James Adams, who worked
on the design of the Surveyor
moon craft at the Jet Propul
sion Lab in Pasadena, came to
Stanford this year."
Pogo Stick-Mounted Computer
Since the moon's gravity is
only about one-sixth that of the
earth, Seifert predicts that ac
celeration forces would equal
one earth "g" for about three
seconds, followed by 12-second
intervals of free flight.
