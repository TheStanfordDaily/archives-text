### PETER WALLENSTEIN 
Love potions, quack physi
cians and the eternal triangle
contribute to the drama in Doni
zetti's opera, "The Elixir of
Love," being offered by the
West Bay Opera Company Feb
ruary 10, 11, and 12.
Curtain time is 8:15 Friday
and Saturday, and 7:30 p.m. Sun

The West Bay Opera, which
presented a very successful
"Carmen" in November was
founded 11 years ago by Henry
Holt, an Austrian immigrant
who performed under the baton
of Arturo Toscanini in 1937
with the Vienna Philharmonic.
Larg-e Scale
The company is a non-profit
organization working on a $15,-
000 yarly budget. It functions
under the auspices of Palo Al
to's Adult Education System to
present three operas annually,
most of which are laigescale.
Each opera is presented four
times, and is double-cast in the
leading roles. Soloists audition
six months prior to the per
formance date. Most of the per
formers are semi-professionals
who "on the side" are dentists,

doctors, lawyers, accountants,
housewives, and nurses. They
are attracted from the entire
Bay area, including Davis, San
Francisco, and San Jose.
Springboard
A number of the singers have
used their West Bay Opera Com
pany experience as a spring
board to a career in the world
of music. Holt is proud of West
Bay's value as a proving-ground
for aspiring artists. He gives
as examples one singer who has
gone on to perform with the
Metropolitan Opera Compaany,
and another who joined the Ber
liner Opera.
"I've had nothing but pleasant
experiences as founder and di
rector of the West Bay Opera,"
beams Holt, who was born and
educated in Vienna before emi
grating to the United States in
1937.
During WWII he served in
the Army, and then enrolled in
Mills College (California) to
continue his studies under the
famous French composer, Dari
us Milhaud. He received his
Masters in musical composition
in 1947.
Accompanist
Subsequently, he devoted his
time to concert piano work,
serving as accompanist to Lili
Pons and George London of the

Metropolitan; violinist, Gin o,
Francescatti; and cellist Pierre
Fournier.
Holt has also had considerable
teaching experience: for a year,
he instructed students in Ger
man at San Jose State, and
from 1959 to 1963 he taught pi
ano and music appreciation at
Foothill College. He also gives
pricate piano lessons and coach
es voice. Since 1943, Palo Alto
has been his home.
Three of the leading singers
in "The Elixir of Love" are also
foreign-born. One of the bari
tones is Russian and another,
Swedish; and one of the sopra
nos is Belgian.

Bay area, including Davis, San
Francisco, and San Jose.
Springboard
A number of the singers have
used their West Bay Opera Com

as examples one singer who has
gone on to perform with the
Metropolitan Opera Compaany,
and another who joined the Ber
liner Opera.
"I've had nothing but pleasant
experiences as founder and di

educated in Vienna before emi
grating to the United States in
1937.
During WWII he served in
the Army, and then enrolled in

continue his studies under the
famous French composer, Dari
us Milhaud. He received his
Masters in musical composition

time to concert piano work,
serving as accompanist to Lili
Pons and George London of the

Metropolitan; violinist, Gin o,
Francescatti; and cellist Pierre
Fournier.
Holt has also had considerable
teaching experience: for a year,
he instructed students in Ger
man at San Jose State, and
from 1959 to 1963 he taught pi
ano and music appreciation at
Foothill College. He also gives
