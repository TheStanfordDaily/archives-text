# Law: 'Search For Relevance'
## 
### 
Ask the good lawyer a simple
question—"ls it raining?"—and
you may get a surprising an
swer—"Where?"
The search for relevance is
the hallmark of a well-educated
attorney, according to Dean
Bayless Manning of the School
of Law.
"The good law student be
comes more liberated from the
tyranny of verbal categories
than almost anyone else," he de
clares.
"A lot of things we assume
are 'facts' actually are sets of
legal characterizations of the
flow of events—looking at the
selling of shoes as an act of in
terstate commerce, for example,
or saying something as appa
rently factual and simple as "I
am married.'"
Liberate Students
Just as graduate programs in
history assume there's more to
the game than just learning the
names and dates of the English
kings, so law schools must lib
erate students from feeling that

education is merely acquiring
information, he adds:
"Students undergo sheer
agony not learning the law, but
unlearning what they thought
was the law.
'The changes have been very
great in the last generation.
"What a lawyer does best
when he's good is develop a
sense of detachment that en
ables him to look at a problem
simultaneously from 35 differ
ent directions. We try to help
him develop his mental optical
equipment, so he can adjust in
stantaneously from a micro
scopic to a telescopic view.
"Interstate commerce, to use
the same example, is not a state
ment of fact; it is an imposition
of the human mind on a flow of
human events.
Questions and Answers
"We try to free students up
to the point where they run a
constant radar scope over state
ments made by others and them
selves, to understand the prem
ises behind the premises. This

is why law school education is
so heavily devoted to question
and answer.
"The student who comes here
thinking he'll find a lot of dec
laratory answex*s is ready for a
surprise."
The student who chooses
Stanford and is admitted may
also be surprised at the caliber
of his colleagues: the median of
this fall's entering class was on
the 96th percentile of the na-

tional exams, with an average
undergraduate grade of B-f-.
"So far as one can measure,
the Stanford student body today
is at parity with Harvard's. On
the paper record, Yale is still
the most selective of the na
tion's law schools," says Man
ning, who edited the Yale "Law
Journal as a student and taught
there before coming to Stan
ford in 1964.
Law School
"Stanford School of Law has
always been distinguished, but
in the past six years it's gone
through a revolution, a dramatic
rise in caliber of its students."
The prospect of "rocket-sled
development" in the West at
tracted Manning to Stanford.
"This University is trying to
accomplish in three-quarters of
a century what's taken Yale,
Harvard, and Columbia over
200 years to do."
Manning rates Stanford's 22-
man law faculty as "absolutely
outstanding" in quality, but
does not minimize the effort re
quired -to expand it by one
third. The cost: including sal
ary, fringe benefits, secretarial
support, said other current
costs: about $25,000 annually
for each of seven or eight new
professors.
Relatively Small Library
In the size of its law library,
Stanford ranks only about 17th
among law school collections,
with about 140,000 volumes.
This compares with more than

one million at Harvard and col
lections of 500,000 or more at
Yale and Columbia.
If the present level of acqui
sitions—l3,ooo books annually—
can be maintained and another
80,000 to 100,000 selected works
added, the School might biuld a
"very respectable" libary in
five to six years, he notes. The
cost: about $10 a volume.
Another challenge: developing
financial support for legal re
search—the local reflection of a
major problem for all the na
tion's law schools.
Also in the ofling in another
three or four years: a new
building to house the school and
a student body of about 500, 10
per cent above the present level.
Jobit Program
A new joint program at Stan
ford with the Graduate School
of Business, permitting stu
dents to earn both an M.B.A.
and an LL.B. degree in four
years, is indicative of the
School's strength in business-re
lated fields and of its interest
in interdisciplinary work.
But Manning feels still
stronger ties are needed with
the social sciences, medicine,
and computer science. "We've
got to get faculty thinking that
creates more awareness of tht
impact of technological change
on society," he comments.
"Our whole society has been
torn up and fundamentally
changed since World War 11.
Profound distortions are being
caused by the concentration of
underprivileged, undereducated
individuals in our large cities.
"Law schools should already
have people trained to observe
these aggregate social process
es, helping work out appropri
ate legal remedies.
Law As Ordering Mechanism
"Law is an instrument of so
cial policy, an ordering mech
anism for large social groups.
Law always involves a degree of
social engineering and always
has."
The legality of human organ
transplants and other futuristic
problems are now "in the cock
tail party talk" stage now, Mar
ning feels, but workable solu
tions won't be developed until
adequately trained lawyers start
the needed research and publish
their recommendations.
While these needs remain un
met, Manning is emphatic in
praising the achievements o'
lawyers in public service: "Law
yers outnumber the other pro
fessions by 100 to 1" in this re
spect, he comments.
"A school's leading alumni
stand as a symbol and standaru
for succeeding generations of
lawyers."
