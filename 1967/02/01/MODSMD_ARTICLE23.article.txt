# Adept Mail Staff Comes Through
## 
### CHRISTOPHER HARGROVE 
The tireless men who deliver
interdepartmental mail kept the
University running last year by
accounting for literally millions
of pieces of mail last year.
If you have ever wondered
where we would be if all the
mimeograph operators suddenly
vanished, then ponder for a mo
ment the catastrophe that would
ensue should such a fate befall
the man who deliver interde
partmental mail.
The mind boggles at the very
thought. Last year on this cam
pus, our unsung heroes delivered
exactly 3,479,492 pieces of ID
mail, as it is called. Dennis Spell
mire, the man in charge of ID
mail, figured this to be an aver
age of about 13,700 per working
day. And not a single dead letter
among them.
Illegible Addresses
This is no simple operation, as
Spellmire describes it. Many
items are addressed wrong,
many are addressed illegibly, but
every one finds its way to the
right person or else is sent back
to the person who mailed it.
As you read this, perhaps you
are grumbling about that item
you sent through ID mail last
week that never got there. But
Spellmire insists that the fault
lies not with his office. He can
recount the times when he has
received batches of used, sup
posedly empty ID envelopes
from secretaries around the cam
pus and has found things in
them which the secretaries ap
parently missed.
Nevertheless, he is quick to
praise the University's secre
taries for making his job as easy
as they can. "They are really
great," he says, "concerning ID
mail."
Efficient Staff
There are problems, of course.
Fifty to sixty pieces a day are
misaddressed, but Spellmire and
his staff know practically the en
tire university by heart This
also helps, for example, when
one professor has several offices
and wants all his mail delivered
to a particular one. Some depart
ments, moreover, have offices in
several locations.
Altogether the delivery boys
stop at 214 places twice a day,
and in Encina Hall — which ac
counts for about a quarter of
the total volume of ID mail —
they stop in each office six times
a day.
Weekly Work
The biggest headache, says
Spellmire, is the monthly pay
checks — seven or eight thou
sand of them. And if a single one
is late, his phone starts to ring.
There are also the 5000-or-so
Weekly Calendars and Faculty
and Staff Newsletters that have
to be distributed every week.
Five years ago the ID mall
service consisted of one lady
in one tiny office in Encina Hall,
which took care of only the ad
ministration types in Encina and
Inner Quad. It was a very small
scale operation compared to to
day when, as Spellmire says,
every new office and every new
building means more ID mall to
deliver.
Some departments, fortunate
ly, have their own mail rooms
— for example, the Graduate
School of Business and the Medi
cal Center. Some departments
send people over to Encina to
pick up their mail, rather than
have it delivered — for example,
the Linear Accelerator and Stan
ford Research Institute.
Not Everything
Some far-away places, like
Stanford Village and the Ryan
Laboratory, have their ID mall
delivered by car.
Some things are not handled,
like U.S. mail, packages and
Stanford Dailies. But Spellmire
is pleased to tell that his service
is consistently entrusted with
such things as budget state
ments and original manuscripts.
Lost-and-found items are also
processed through interdepart
mental mail. Eyeglasses, books,
overcoats and such are sent
through ID mail to the Fire

House, where they are some
times reclaimed.
Spellmire and his assistants
have been with Stanford's ID
mail service for about two years.
By now they have the hang of
it so well that most misaddressed
pieces find their way straight to
the right office anyway.
And so the University keeps
rolling as its daily mountain of
paperwork is continuously and
efficiently reshuffled by the men
on the three-wheeled bicycles of
the interdepartmntal mail ser
vice.
