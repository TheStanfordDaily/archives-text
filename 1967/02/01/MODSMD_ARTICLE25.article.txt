# Anti-Missile System Debated
## 
### JAMES MARLOW Associated Press 
Washington — It's a busy
time, ful of go-go-go. Mixed up,
too.
The United States and Russia
spent billions, and used up years,
to build missiles to use on each
other, just in case. Now the Rus
sians are busy with an anti
missile system which could cost
them another $25 billion.
This country, debating about
it, wishes the Soviets wouldn't
throw money around like that
because, if the United States
goes all-out on an antimissile
kick, the bill may be $40 billion.
The Russians, according to re
ports, have an x-ray arrange
ment that could blow up oncom
ing missiles while this country,

so reports say, knows how to
make a missile which could de
stroy several cities hundreds of
miles apart.
This involves a special tech
nique callcd MITRV, which is
short for multiple - individually -
targetable - reentry - vehicle.
That may too much for most
people to understand but most
can understand that relations
between Russia and Red China
are closer to breaking than ever
before although practically no
body outside China seems to
understand what is going on in
side China.
The Chinese are calling the
Russian leaders pigs and, in ef
fect, reactionaries while the Rus
sians are calling the Chinese,
in effect, nuts.

Neither is saying the embar
rassing thing: that both are suf
fering from acute nationalism,
which Communism was sup
posed to eliminate, or that na
tionalism may last longer than
Communism, which is bound
to go to pieces if nationalism
lasts long enough.
