# Corporations Seek Trainees
## 
### 
Nearly 200 Stanford under
graduates have applied for the
summer management intern pro
gram (SMIP) sponsored by stu
dent government in cooperation
with more than two dozen major
corporations and financial insti
tutions.
Operated on a shoestring bud
get of $100, the program has ex
panded very rapidly since it was
established two years ago by
Scott Mcßride, then student body
president.
In giving students a close-in
view of management at work, it
parallels the highly successful
Stanford • in • Washington pro
gram, run by the Alumni Asso
ciation, which now sends about
100 students to work every sum
mer with Congressmen and fed
eral agency executives.
Interest High
About 30 companies have ex
pressed interest in this year's
program and the total probably
will reach 50, according to Thom
as Shanahan, junior economics
major from Altadena, a Bank of
America intern last summer who
now directs the project.
Most applicants are liberal
arts students. Many are juniors
and sophomores interested in
finding out more about manage
ment. Last year's participants
are the most enthusiastic — and
effective — recruiters for this
year's program, Shanahan says.
Dean Ernest C. Arbuckle of
the Graduate School of Business,
a former vice-president with W.
R. Grace & Co., notes that "much
has been written . . . about a
growing disdain with which con
temporary collegians view ca
reers in business. Such careers,

they say, lack challenge, crea
tivity and personal satisfaction.
Experience Helpful
"This program was initiated
and has been ably sustained, by
Stanford undergraduates who
dissent from this view. They feel
that, at very least, outstanding
students in the process of career
decisions should gain a first
hand view of the management
function.
"The student's perception and
understanding of the institution
of business and how it is man
aged can be greatly enhanced
by direct contact with those who
manage, and personal involve
ment in some of the problems
they face.
"The experience they are seek
ing, even though limited to a

summer exposure, can do m i 1
to broaden their understand <n
and appreciation of business or
terprise."
Vince Ricci, senior political
science major from Anaheim,
who interned last summer a
business oflice assistant man
ager for Pacific Telephone in
Costa Mesa, says: My first im
pression was one of surprise. <
was not expecting to em
ployees of a firm working ,an f t
striving as hard as they do.j
Responsible Positions
"I was particularly imposed
with the time takers by company
executives for men on their '*um
mer hire' program. Top echelon
people paid sincere attention;; we
were allowed to participate 4 and
produce. Most trainees were
given considerable responsibility.
