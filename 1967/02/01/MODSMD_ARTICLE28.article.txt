Stanford's Burt Ambler, 167 pound wrestler,
strains here to pin his opponent from Oregon, Dick
Bellock. Ambler, demonstrating a classic can
opener, entwined his left leg through Bellock's
knee up to his own chin. Although Ambler did pull
Bellock over to his back, he was unable to get the
pin and had to settle for three predicament points.
