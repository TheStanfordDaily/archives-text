# International Studies Center Established
## 
### 
Establishment of a new Center for
Research in International Studies was
announced yesterday by President
Wallace Sterling.
"The new center is a logical out
growth of the extensive development
in recent years of the University's in
ternational studies programs," said
President Sterling. "Its establishment
at this time reflects more than five
years of development and preparation
*n the fields of international studies
throughout the University."
Center director will be Dr. Robert
M. Rosenzweig, associate dean of the
Graduate Division. Policy guidance for

the Center will be supplied by an ex
ecutive board composed of senior fa
culty and administrative officers.

"Perhaps the chief purpose of the
Center," said Rosenzweig, "is to stim
ulate and encourage new approaches
in international studies, particularly
those involving faculty from more
than one discipline or more than one
school. The Center will not offer cour
ses or award degrees. Rather, it will
make it easier for faculty and students
to pursue their intellectual interest,
and under the guidance of the Execu
tive Committee will help give direction
to those interests."

The Center will help faculty mem
bers to obtain funds for their research.
It will also aid in the allocation of
funds within the University and assist
in further development in the various
fields of international studies.
Exchange Programs
The Center will also administer the
University's graduate overseas re
search and educational programs, such
as the inter-university language pro
grams in Tokyo and Taipei, the Stan
ford-University of Warsaw graduate
exchange, and the doctoral dissertation
year fellowship programs in Britain,
France, Germany, and Italy.

"Perhaps the chief purpose of the
Center," said Rosenzweig, "is to stim
ulate and encourage new approaches
in international studies, particularly
those involving faculty from more
than one discipline or more than one
school. The Center will not offer cour
ses or award degrees. Rather, it will
make it easier for faculty and students
to pursue their intellectual interest,
and under the guidance of the Execu
tive Committee will help give direction
to those interests."

The Center will help faculty mem
bers to obtain funds for their research.
It will also aid in the allocation of
funds within the University and assist
in further development in the various
fields of international studies.
Exchange Programs
The Center will also administer the
University's graduate overseas re
search and educational programs, such
as the inter-university language pro
grams in Tokyo and Taipei, the Stan
ford-University of Warsaw graduate
exchange, and the doctoral dissertation
year fellowship programs in Britain,
France, Germany, and Italy.
Serving on the executive committee
