# Fixing In College Sports...An Inevitability?
## 
### 
Point spreads and the ability
of individuals to dominate a
team make basketball easy to
fix, but football has not totally
escaped the attention of the
fixers. As recently as last Octo
ber, three backfield stars of

Louisiana State University were
offered a total of $1,200 to influ
ence the outcomes of six games.
As they look about them for
possible relief from a system
that encourages rather than dis
courages abuses of betting, col
leges might support legislation
limiting college games or they
might better strike nearer to the
solution by following Clair Bee's
suggestion to de-emphasize.
The vicious circle of winning
and recruiting produced inter

esting teams that lured crowds
to see them play, but in only one
year did his team make money.
In fact, in its last year of opera
tion, it lost $25,000.
Bee contends that the decision
to de-emphasize would not in
volve a much greater outlay of
expenses than before. Schools of
long-standing could make the
step easier than newer schools
because of large endowments
which would help support a less
intense system.
De-Emphasis At Stanford
Johns Hopkins and the Ivy
League schools have made the
transition, but an university like
Stanford would find it hard to
eliminate football: "Expense
could be cut substantially, how
ever, income to support other
sports would also be wiped out!"
An effort in this direction
should be made, nevertheless, at
this and similar institutions if
the remark of Willard Manus,
who wrote a novel based on the
1951 basketball fixing scandal,
is correct, "Where there is re
cruiting and tampering, there
will, inevitably, be fixing."

Anxious Bettor
Quite obviously, an anxious bettor on the
weekend's college games wanted to check on
his investment. Stanford's sports publicity di
: had been informed of a rash of calls
7^ r from the east asking for the same information
ti'-.and had correctly inferred that syndicate gam

day. With so much money involved, one won

made the headlines for almost eight years, the

lege sports may not be a static relationship.

Symbiosis: Gambling and Sports
VJ Events of this century have shown that un
'less they are checked gambling interests that
~„( d rift and profiteer in the wake of fairly played

sports will form a symbiotic attachment and
slowly sap the sport's strength. Sports have
always been a favorite realm for bettors, and
they began their fixing activities on the level
of professional baseball. The first sports scan
dal of this century in the United States and
still the most celebrated case was the 1919
World Series fix.
Various sources made loud accusations after
the favorite Chicago White Sox lost in unspec
tacular fashion. Answering the critics of the
series, the official organ of professional base
ball found the cries of foul play impossible to
take seriously. "It seeems that the 'dope'
craze has gone a little beyond the bounds of
reason and . . . justice." But then evidence
came to light the next year which succeeded
in barring eight players from professional
baseball for life.
The principals involved, pitcher Eddie Ci
cotte and star hitter Arnold Gandil, had agreed
to bring in six others, and in return for throw
ing the series the group would receive a total
of $100,000.
To understand how gamblers can make in
roads into college sports and eventually in
fluence outcomes, an examination of how they
operate is necessary. Gambling gravitates
towards the dollar sign, and it is not surprising
that New York City, the business center of the
country, has long been the center of the large
gambling syndicates.
Bookmakers operate, naturally, in sports
that command the most widespread interest
and will stimulate the most betting. At first,
the national pastime, baseball, was the most
important item. The sudden emergence after
the Second World War of basketball and foot
ball shifted gamblers' emphasis. By 1960, paid
customers witnessing college basketball games
numbered 150,000,000. This interest accounted
for the daily betting figure of $15 million.
Betting in basketball and football is on a
point spread basis. For example, if Team A is

favored to defeat Team B by nine points, the
"line" is a 10-8 spread on A. Bettors on A
win if it wins by ten or more points while B
bettors collect if their team wins or loses by
eight or less. Bookies win everything if the
final margin is nine points.
How It Works
The bettors have the most to gain by fixing
a game's outcome. If a gambler bets heavily on
the underdog, he has probably bribed a star
player on the favorite to keep the winning
margin beneath the point spread. Heavy bet
ting on the favorite could mean that a bribed
star on the underdog would make sure his
team lost by more than the point spread.
The fixers range from professionals like
Irving Schwartzberg, who masterminded the
operation that turned into the 1951 basketball
scandal in N.Y.C., to amateurs like barber
Joe Graziano, who was apprehended last Octo
ber trying to fix L.S.U. football games. If they
can get players to hit the point spread exactly,
bookmakers can make killings by fixing. That
this happened at least twelve times during
the 1951 season indicates that this was prob
ably done.
When Dr. Forrest Allen predicted in 1944
that a fixing scandal in college basketball was
imminent unless positive steps were immedi
ately taken, he was attacked for his meager
confidence in the integrity ol both American
youth and his fellow coaches. The college com
munity could not be prodded to action until
his prediction came true in 1951. Because of
the Kefauver congreessional investigation into
gambling activities at that time, the public
was finally waking up to the existence of wide
spread illicit betting.
Star Center Is A Stoolie
The key person in exposing the fixers was
Junius Kellogg, a star center for Manhattan
College in New York City. He was approached
by bettors and offered $1,000 to throw a game

and make sure his team lost by more than
seven points. After contacting his coach and
telling him what happened, he then played
along with the bettors, and the authorities soon
uncovered a fixing network that included four
New York schools.
Reporters naturally asked Adolph Rupp,
coach of the number one team in the country,
for his opinions and whether such a scandal
could develop at Kentucky. "Those bettors
couldn't touch any of my players with a ten
foot pole." After the final investigations, six
Kentucky players were among a total of 32
players from seven schools eventually found
guilty of conspiring to fix games. New York
sports writers sent him an eleven-foot pole.
Also fair game for the critics were the
bonuses paid out by schools vying for athletes.
Closely aligned with this argument is the state
ment made by Clair Bee, coach of involved
Long Island University, a year after the scan
dal. "We (coaches) sabotaged the public's faith
and students' loyalty by turning a game into
a business." He went on to describe how the
recruiting policies of the basketball power
houses had led to a vicious circle that started
with an overemphasis on winning.
Intense recruiting was ncessary to produce
winning teams, which in turn was necessary
to produce enough money to take several trips
across the country to build up the team's repu
tation and to pay for the recruiting.
College Athletics More Susceptible
Professional baseball survived its serious
crisis, and other sports such as horse racing
and p/ofessional football have also survived
setbacks involving conflict of interests of cer
tain participants. Uniquely susceptible to col
lusion between athletes and outsiders, college
athletics does not recover as fully as profes
sional sports.
The college athlete by the offer of scholar
ships and other inducements had, in a sense,

been bribed to attend a certain university. Bpt
what was his reward after entering? He €fcw
large paying crowds at the games and so&n
began asking themselves where they fit ii)to
this system that benefited the school more th«n
him. Asking more from this situation than lie
was receiving, he succumbed to bettors' offe?s.
What type of janitorial job did the colleges
perform after the scandal? On an individual
basis, some drastic actions did result. Cliiir
Bee's employer, Long Island University, (fid
not consider varsity basketball success worth
a possible recurrence of the face-losing ex
perience it had gone through and dropped tlje
sport completely. The national organization
did not have the money to set up a permanent
internal control system. Because of
diversity of views, it rejected the giving (>f
broad powers to a commissioner-type post. *
Athletes' Cooperation
*
It still depended on total co-operation of the
athletes and the coaches and made an effort
to concentrate on disseminating information
outlining the perils of betting in college sporfe.
An individual conference might initiate a limit
ed investigation, but because of the large
number of college teams and their location in
different parts of the country, only the Fiji
was capable of successfully coping with the
problem.
Questionnaires and instructive forms a#e
currently used by various universities and con
ferences to aid in the fight against fixing, bQt
the prime reason for their use is to have or>
record evidence that minmum preventive stefls
were performed, if an incident does occur. *
No Recruiting Changes
Except for minor modifications and limita
tions, colleges have not changed their recruit
ing practices, which, many still insist, we£r
thin an athlete's moral fiber and make him
susceptible to fixers.
Point spreads and the ability
of individuals to dominate a
team make basketball easy to
fix, but football has not totally
escaped the attention of the
fixers. As recently as last Octo

No Recruiting Changes
Except for minor modifications and limita
tions, colleges have not changed their recruit
ing practices, which, many still insist, we£r
thin an athlete's moral fiber and make him
susceptible to fixers.
Point spreads and the ability
of individuals to dominate a
team make basketball easy to
fix, but football has not totally
escaped the attention of the
fixers. As recently as last Octo

Louisiana State University were
offered a total of $1,200 to influ

and recruiting produced inter

Bee contends that the decision
to de-emphasize would not in

expenses than before. Schools of
long-standing could make the
step easier than newer schools
because of large endowments
which would help support a less
intense system.
De-Emphasis At Stanford
Johns Hopkins and the Ivy
League schools have made the
transition, but an university like
Stanford would find it hard to
eliminate football: "Expense
could be cut substantially, how
ever, income to support other
sports would also be wiped out!"
An effort in this direction
should be made, nevertheless, at
this and similar institutions if
the remark of Willard Manus,
who wrote a novel based on the
1951 basketball fixing scandal,
is correct, "Where there is re
cruiting and tampering, there
will, inevitably, be fixing."

Symbiosis: Gambling and Sports
VJ Events of this century have shown that un
'less they are checked gambling interests that
~„( d rift and profiteer in the wake of fairly played

sports will form a symbiotic attachment and
slowly sap the sport's strength. Sports have
always been a favorite realm for bettors, and
they began their fixing activities on the level
of professional baseball. The first sports scan
dal of this century in the United States and
still the most celebrated case was the 1919
World Series fix.
Various sources made loud accusations after
the favorite Chicago White Sox lost in unspec
tacular fashion. Answering the critics of the
series, the official organ of professional base
ball found the cries of foul play impossible to
take seriously. "It seeems that the 'dope'
craze has gone a little beyond the bounds of
reason and . . . justice." But then evidence
came to light the next year which succeeded
in barring eight players from professional
baseball for life.
The principals involved, pitcher Eddie Ci
cotte and star hitter Arnold Gandil, had agreed
to bring in six others, and in return for throw
ing the series the group would receive a total
of $100,000.
To understand how gamblers can make in
roads into college sports and eventually in
fluence outcomes, an examination of how they
operate is necessary. Gambling gravitates
towards the dollar sign, and it is not surprising
that New York City, the business center of the
country, has long been the center of the large
gambling syndicates.
Bookmakers operate, naturally, in sports
that command the most widespread interest
and will stimulate the most betting. At first,
the national pastime, baseball, was the most
important item. The sudden emergence after
the Second World War of basketball and foot
ball shifted gamblers' emphasis. By 1960, paid
customers witnessing college basketball games
numbered 150,000,000. This interest accounted
for the daily betting figure of $15 million.
Betting in basketball and football is on a
point spread basis. For example, if Team A is

favored to defeat Team B by nine points, the
"line" is a 10-8 spread on A. Bettors on A
win if it wins by ten or more points while B
bettors collect if their team wins or loses by
eight or less. Bookies win everything if the
final margin is nine points.
How It Works
The bettors have the most to gain by fixing
a game's outcome. If a gambler bets heavily on
the underdog, he has probably bribed a star
player on the favorite to keep the winning
margin beneath the point spread. Heavy bet
ting on the favorite could mean that a bribed
star on the underdog would make sure his
team lost by more than the point spread.
The fixers range from professionals like
Irving Schwartzberg, who masterminded the
operation that turned into the 1951 basketball
scandal in N.Y.C., to amateurs like barber
Joe Graziano, who was apprehended last Octo
ber trying to fix L.S.U. football games. If they
can get players to hit the point spread exactly,
bookmakers can make killings by fixing. That
this happened at least twelve times during
the 1951 season indicates that this was prob
ably done.
When Dr. Forrest Allen predicted in 1944
that a fixing scandal in college basketball was
imminent unless positive steps were immedi
ately taken, he was attacked for his meager
confidence in the integrity ol both American
youth and his fellow coaches. The college com
munity could not be prodded to action until
his prediction came true in 1951. Because of
the Kefauver congreessional investigation into
gambling activities at that time, the public
was finally waking up to the existence of wide
spread illicit betting.
Star Center Is A Stoolie
The key person in exposing the fixers was
Junius Kellogg, a star center for Manhattan
College in New York City. He was approached
by bettors and offered $1,000 to throw a game

and make sure his team lost by more than
seven points. After contacting his coach and
telling him what happened, he then played
along with the bettors, and the authorities soon
uncovered a fixing network that included four
New York schools.
Reporters naturally asked Adolph Rupp,
coach of the number one team in the country,
for his opinions and whether such a scandal
could develop at Kentucky. "Those bettors
couldn't touch any of my players with a ten
foot pole." After the final investigations, six
Kentucky players were among a total of 32
players from seven schools eventually found
guilty of conspiring to fix games. New York
sports writers sent him an eleven-foot pole.
Also fair game for the critics were the
bonuses paid out by schools vying for athletes.
Closely aligned with this argument is the state
ment made by Clair Bee, coach of involved
Long Island University, a year after the scan
dal. "We (coaches) sabotaged the public's faith
and students' loyalty by turning a game into
a business." He went on to describe how the
recruiting policies of the basketball power
houses had led to a vicious circle that started
with an overemphasis on winning.
Intense recruiting was ncessary to produce
winning teams, which in turn was necessary
to produce enough money to take several trips
across the country to build up the team's repu
tation and to pay for the recruiting.

the 1951 season indicates that this was prob
ably done.
When Dr. Forrest Allen predicted in 1944
that a fixing scandal in college basketball was
imminent unless positive steps were immedi
ately taken, he was attacked for his meager
confidence in the integrity ol both American
youth and his fellow coaches. The college com
munity could not be prodded to action until
his prediction came true in 1951. Because of
the Kefauver congreessional investigation into
gambling activities at that time, the public
was finally waking up to the existence of wide
spread illicit betting.
Star Center Is A Stoolie
The key person in exposing the fixers was
Junius Kellogg, a star center for Manhattan
College in New York City. He was approached
by bettors and offered $1,000 to throw a game

and make sure his team lost by more than
seven points. After contacting his coach and
telling him what happened, he then played
along with the bettors, and the authorities soon
uncovered a fixing network that included four
New York schools.
Reporters naturally asked Adolph Rupp,
coach of the number one team in the country,
for his opinions and whether such a scandal
could develop at Kentucky. "Those bettors
couldn't touch any of my players with a ten
foot pole." After the final investigations, six
Kentucky players were among a total of 32
players from seven schools eventually found
guilty of conspiring to fix games. New York
sports writers sent him an eleven-foot pole.
Also fair game for the critics were the
bonuses paid out by schools vying for athletes.
Closely aligned with this argument is the state
ment made by Clair Bee, coach of involved
Long Island University, a year after the scan
dal. "We (coaches) sabotaged the public's faith
and students' loyalty by turning a game into
a business." He went on to describe how the
recruiting policies of the basketball power
houses had led to a vicious circle that started
with an overemphasis on winning.
Intense recruiting was ncessary to produce
winning teams, which in turn was necessary
to produce enough money to take several trips
across the country to build up the team's repu
tation and to pay for the recruiting.
College Athletics More Susceptible
Professional baseball survived its serious
crisis, and other sports such as horse racing
and p/ofessional football have also survived
setbacks involving conflict of interests of cer
tain participants. Uniquely susceptible to col
lusion between athletes and outsiders, college
athletics does not recover as fully as profes
sional sports.
The college athlete by the offer of scholar
ships and other inducements had, in a sense,

been bribed to attend a certain university. Bpt
what was his reward after entering? He €fcw
large paying crowds at the games and so&n
began asking themselves where they fit ii)to
this system that benefited the school more th«n
him. Asking more from this situation than lie
was receiving, he succumbed to bettors' offe?s.
What type of janitorial job did the colleges
perform after the scandal? On an individual
basis, some drastic actions did result. Cliiir

not consider varsity basketball success worth
a possible recurrence of the face-losing ex

sport completely. The national organization
did not have the money to set up a permanent
internal control system. Because of
diversity of views, it rejected the giving (>f
broad powers to a commissioner-type post. *
Athletes' Cooperation
*
It still depended on total co-operation of the
athletes and the coaches and made an effort
to concentrate on disseminating information
outlining the perils of betting in college sporfe.
An individual conference might initiate a limit
ed investigation, but because of the large
number of college teams and their location in
different parts of the country, only the Fiji
was capable of successfully coping with the
problem.

currently used by various universities and con
ferences to aid in the fight against fixing, bQt
the prime reason for their use is to have or>
record evidence that minmum preventive stefls
were performed, if an incident does occur. *
No Recruiting Changes
Except for minor modifications and limita
tions, colleges have not changed their recruit
ing practices, which, many still insist, we£r
thin an athlete's moral fiber and make him
susceptible to fixers.
Point spreads and the ability
of individuals to dominate a
team make basketball easy to
fix, but football has not totally
escaped the attention of the
fixers. As recently as last Octo
ber, three backfield stars of

Louisiana State University were
offered a total of $1,200 to influ
ence the outcomes of six games.
As they look about them for
possible relief from a system
that encourages rather than dis
courages abuses of betting, col
leges might support legislation
limiting college games or they
might better strike nearer to the
solution by following Clair Bee's
suggestion to de-emphasize.
The vicious circle of winning
and recruiting produced inter

esting teams that lured crowds
to see them play, but in only one
year did his team make money.
In fact, in its last year of opera
tion, it lost $25,000.
Bee contends that the decision
to de-emphasize would not in
volve a much greater outlay of
expenses than before. Schools of
long-standing could make the
step easier than newer schools
because of large endowments
which would help support a less
intense system.
De-Emphasis At Stanford
Johns Hopkins and the Ivy
League schools have made the
transition, but an university like
Stanford would find it hard to
eliminate football: "Expense
could be cut substantially, how
ever, income to support other
sports would also be wiped out!"
An effort in this direction
should be made, nevertheless, at
this and similar institutions if
the remark of Willard Manus,
who wrote a novel based on the
1951 basketball fixing scandal,
is correct, "Where there is re
cruiting and tampering, there
will, inevitably, be fixing."

Symbiosis: Gambling and Sports
VJ Events of this century have shown that un
'less they are checked gambling interests that
~„( d rift and profiteer in the wake of fairly played

sports will form a symbiotic attachment and
slowly sap the sport's strength. Sports have
always been a favorite realm for bettors, and
they began their fixing activities on the level
of professional baseball. The first sports scan
dal of this century in the United States and
still the most celebrated case was the 1919
World Series fix.
Various sources made loud accusations after
the favorite Chicago White Sox lost in unspec
tacular fashion. Answering the critics of the
series, the official organ of professional base
ball found the cries of foul play impossible to
take seriously. "It seeems that the 'dope'
craze has gone a little beyond the bounds of
reason and . . . justice." But then evidence
came to light the next year which succeeded
in barring eight players from professional
baseball for life.
The principals involved, pitcher Eddie Ci
cotte and star hitter Arnold Gandil, had agreed
to bring in six others, and in return for throw
ing the series the group would receive a total
of $100,000.
To understand how gamblers can make in
roads into college sports and eventually in
fluence outcomes, an examination of how they
operate is necessary. Gambling gravitates
towards the dollar sign, and it is not surprising
that New York City, the business center of the
country, has long been the center of the large
gambling syndicates.
Bookmakers operate, naturally, in sports
that command the most widespread interest
and will stimulate the most betting. At first,
the national pastime, baseball, was the most
important item. The sudden emergence after
the Second World War of basketball and foot
ball shifted gamblers' emphasis. By 1960, paid
customers witnessing college basketball games
numbered 150,000,000. This interest accounted
for the daily betting figure of $15 million.
Betting in basketball and football is on a
point spread basis. For example, if Team A is

favored to defeat Team B by nine points, the
"line" is a 10-8 spread on A. Bettors on A
win if it wins by ten or more points while B
bettors collect if their team wins or loses by
eight or less. Bookies win everything if the
final margin is nine points.
How It Works
The bettors have the most to gain by fixing
a game's outcome. If a gambler bets heavily on
the underdog, he has probably bribed a star
player on the favorite to keep the winning
margin beneath the point spread. Heavy bet
ting on the favorite could mean that a bribed
star on the underdog would make sure his
team lost by more than the point spread.
The fixers range from professionals like
Irving Schwartzberg, who masterminded the
operation that turned into the 1951 basketball
scandal in N.Y.C., to amateurs like barber
Joe Graziano, who was apprehended last Octo
ber trying to fix L.S.U. football games. If they
can get players to hit the point spread exactly,
bookmakers can make killings by fixing. That
this happened at least twelve times during
the 1951 season indicates that this was prob
ably done.

cotte and star hitter Arnold Gandil, had agreed
to bring in six others, and in return for throw
ing the series the group would receive a total
of $100,000.
To understand how gamblers can make in
roads into college sports and eventually in
fluence outcomes, an examination of how they
operate is necessary. Gambling gravitates
towards the dollar sign, and it is not surprising
that New York City, the business center of the
country, has long been the center of the large
gambling syndicates.
Bookmakers operate, naturally, in sports
that command the most widespread interest
and will stimulate the most betting. At first,
the national pastime, baseball, was the most
important item. The sudden emergence after
the Second World War of basketball and foot
ball shifted gamblers' emphasis. By 1960, paid
customers witnessing college basketball games
numbered 150,000,000. This interest accounted
for the daily betting figure of $15 million.
Betting in basketball and football is on a
point spread basis. For example, if Team A is

favored to defeat Team B by nine points, the
"line" is a 10-8 spread on A. Bettors on A
win if it wins by ten or more points while B
bettors collect if their team wins or loses by
eight or less. Bookies win everything if the
final margin is nine points.
How It Works
The bettors have the most to gain by fixing
a game's outcome. If a gambler bets heavily on
the underdog, he has probably bribed a star
player on the favorite to keep the winning
margin beneath the point spread. Heavy bet
ting on the favorite could mean that a bribed
star on the underdog would make sure his
team lost by more than the point spread.
The fixers range from professionals like
Irving Schwartzberg, who masterminded the
operation that turned into the 1951 basketball
scandal in N.Y.C., to amateurs like barber
Joe Graziano, who was apprehended last Octo
ber trying to fix L.S.U. football games. If they
can get players to hit the point spread exactly,
bookmakers can make killings by fixing. That
this happened at least twelve times during
the 1951 season indicates that this was prob
ably done.
When Dr. Forrest Allen predicted in 1944
that a fixing scandal in college basketball was
imminent unless positive steps were immedi
ately taken, he was attacked for his meager
confidence in the integrity ol both American
youth and his fellow coaches. The college com
munity could not be prodded to action until
his prediction came true in 1951. Because of
the Kefauver congreessional investigation into
gambling activities at that time, the public
was finally waking up to the existence of wide
spread illicit betting.
Star Center Is A Stoolie
The key person in exposing the fixers was
Junius Kellogg, a star center for Manhattan
College in New York City. He was approached
by bettors and offered $1,000 to throw a game

and make sure his team lost by more than
seven points. After contacting his coach and
telling him what happened, he then played
along with the bettors, and the authorities soon
uncovered a fixing network that included four
New York schools.
Reporters naturally asked Adolph Rupp,
coach of the number one team in the country,
for his opinions and whether such a scandal
could develop at Kentucky. "Those bettors
couldn't touch any of my players with a ten
foot pole." After the final investigations, six
Kentucky players were among a total of 32
players from seven schools eventually found
guilty of conspiring to fix games. New York
sports writers sent him an eleven-foot pole.
Also fair game for the critics were the
bonuses paid out by schools vying for athletes.
Closely aligned with this argument is the state
ment made by Clair Bee, coach of involved
Long Island University, a year after the scan
dal. "We (coaches) sabotaged the public's faith
and students' loyalty by turning a game into
a business." He went on to describe how the
recruiting policies of the basketball power
houses had led to a vicious circle that started
with an overemphasis on winning.
Intense recruiting was ncessary to produce
winning teams, which in turn was necessary
to produce enough money to take several trips
across the country to build up the team's repu
tation and to pay for the recruiting.
College Athletics More Susceptible
Professional baseball survived its serious
crisis, and other sports such as horse racing
and p/ofessional football have also survived
setbacks involving conflict of interests of cer
tain participants. Uniquely susceptible to col
lusion between athletes and outsiders, college
athletics does not recover as fully as profes
sional sports.
The college athlete by the offer of scholar
ships and other inducements had, in a sense,

been bribed to attend a certain university. Bpt
what was his reward after entering? He €fcw
large paying crowds at the games and so&n
began asking themselves where they fit ii)to
this system that benefited the school more th«n
him. Asking more from this situation than lie
was receiving, he succumbed to bettors' offe?s.
What type of janitorial job did the colleges
perform after the scandal? On an individual
basis, some drastic actions did result. Cliiir
Bee's employer, Long Island University, (fid
not consider varsity basketball success worth
a possible recurrence of the face-losing ex
perience it had gone through and dropped tlje
sport completely. The national organization
did not have the money to set up a permanent
internal control system. Because of
diversity of views, it rejected the giving (>f
broad powers to a commissioner-type post. *
Athletes' Cooperation
*
It still depended on total co-operation of the
athletes and the coaches and made an effort
to concentrate on disseminating information
outlining the perils of betting in college sporfe.
An individual conference might initiate a limit
ed investigation, but because of the large
number of college teams and their location in
different parts of the country, only the Fiji
was capable of successfully coping with the
problem.
Questionnaires and instructive forms a#e
currently used by various universities and con
ferences to aid in the fight against fixing, bQt
the prime reason for their use is to have or>
record evidence that minmum preventive stefls
were performed, if an incident does occur. *
No Recruiting Changes
Except for minor modifications and limita
tions, colleges have not changed their recruit
ing practices, which, many still insist, we£r
thin an athlete's moral fiber and make him
susceptible to fixers.
Point spreads and the ability
of individuals to dominate a
team make basketball easy to
fix, but football has not totally
escaped the attention of the
fixers. As recently as last Octo
ber, three backfield stars of

Louisiana State University were
offered a total of $1,200 to influ
ence the outcomes of six games.
As they look about them for
possible relief from a system
that encourages rather than dis
courages abuses of betting, col
leges might support legislation
limiting college games or they
might better strike nearer to the
solution by following Clair Bee's
suggestion to de-emphasize.
The vicious circle of winning
and recruiting produced inter

esting teams that lured crowds
to see them play, but in only one
year did his team make money.
In fact, in its last year of opera
tion, it lost $25,000.
Bee contends that the decision
to de-emphasize would not in
volve a much greater outlay of
expenses than before. Schools of
long-standing could make the
step easier than newer schools
because of large endowments
which would help support a less
intense system.
De-Emphasis At Stanford
Johns Hopkins and the Ivy
League schools have made the
transition, but an university like
Stanford would find it hard to
eliminate football: "Expense
could be cut substantially, how
ever, income to support other
sports would also be wiped out!"
An effort in this direction
should be made, nevertheless, at
this and similar institutions if
the remark of Willard Manus,
who wrote a novel based on the
1951 basketball fixing scandal,
is correct, "Where there is re
cruiting and tampering, there
will, inevitably, be fixing."

Symbiosis: Gambling and Sports
VJ Events of this century have shown that un
'less they are checked gambling interests that
~„( d rift and profiteer in the wake of fairly played

sports will form a symbiotic attachment and
slowly sap the sport's strength. Sports have
always been a favorite realm for bettors, and
they began their fixing activities on the level
of professional baseball. The first sports scan
dal of this century in the United States and
still the most celebrated case was the 1919
World Series fix.
Various sources made loud accusations after
the favorite Chicago White Sox lost in unspec
tacular fashion. Answering the critics of the
series, the official organ of professional base
ball found the cries of foul play impossible to
take seriously. "It seeems that the 'dope'
craze has gone a little beyond the bounds of
reason and . . . justice." But then evidence
came to light the next year which succeeded
in barring eight players from professional
baseball for life.
The principals involved, pitcher Eddie Ci
cotte and star hitter Arnold Gandil, had agreed
to bring in six others, and in return for throw
ing the series the group would receive a total
of $100,000.

Symbiosis: Gambling and Sports
VJ Events of this century have shown that un
'less they are checked gambling interests that
~„( d rift and profiteer in the wake of fairly played

sports will form a symbiotic attachment and
slowly sap the sport's strength. Sports have
always been a favorite realm for bettors, and
they began their fixing activities on the level
of professional baseball. The first sports scan
dal of this century in the United States and
still the most celebrated case was the 1919
World Series fix.
Various sources made loud accusations after
the favorite Chicago White Sox lost in unspec
tacular fashion. Answering the critics of the
series, the official organ of professional base
ball found the cries of foul play impossible to
take seriously. "It seeems that the 'dope'
craze has gone a little beyond the bounds of
reason and . . . justice." But then evidence
came to light the next year which succeeded
in barring eight players from professional
baseball for life.
The principals involved, pitcher Eddie Ci
cotte and star hitter Arnold Gandil, had agreed
to bring in six others, and in return for throw
ing the series the group would receive a total
of $100,000.
To understand how gamblers can make in
roads into college sports and eventually in
fluence outcomes, an examination of how they
operate is necessary. Gambling gravitates
towards the dollar sign, and it is not surprising
that New York City, the business center of the
country, has long been the center of the large
gambling syndicates.
Bookmakers operate, naturally, in sports
that command the most widespread interest
and will stimulate the most betting. At first,
the national pastime, baseball, was the most
important item. The sudden emergence after
the Second World War of basketball and foot
ball shifted gamblers' emphasis. By 1960, paid
customers witnessing college basketball games
numbered 150,000,000. This interest accounted
for the daily betting figure of $15 million.
Betting in basketball and football is on a
point spread basis. For example, if Team A is

favored to defeat Team B by nine points, the
"line" is a 10-8 spread on A. Bettors on A
win if it wins by ten or more points while B
bettors collect if their team wins or loses by
eight or less. Bookies win everything if the
final margin is nine points.
How It Works
The bettors have the most to gain by fixing
a game's outcome. If a gambler bets heavily on
the underdog, he has probably bribed a star
player on the favorite to keep the winning
margin beneath the point spread. Heavy bet
ting on the favorite could mean that a bribed
star on the underdog would make sure his
team lost by more than the point spread.
The fixers range from professionals like
Irving Schwartzberg, who masterminded the
operation that turned into the 1951 basketball
scandal in N.Y.C., to amateurs like barber
Joe Graziano, who was apprehended last Octo
ber trying to fix L.S.U. football games. If they
can get players to hit the point spread exactly,
bookmakers can make killings by fixing. That
this happened at least twelve times during
the 1951 season indicates that this was prob
ably done.
When Dr. Forrest Allen predicted in 1944
that a fixing scandal in college basketball was
imminent unless positive steps were immedi
ately taken, he was attacked for his meager
confidence in the integrity ol both American
youth and his fellow coaches. The college com
munity could not be prodded to action until
his prediction came true in 1951. Because of
the Kefauver congreessional investigation into
gambling activities at that time, the public
was finally waking up to the existence of wide
spread illicit betting.
Star Center Is A Stoolie
The key person in exposing the fixers was
Junius Kellogg, a star center for Manhattan
College in New York City. He was approached
by bettors and offered $1,000 to throw a game

and make sure his team lost by more than
seven points. After contacting his coach and
telling him what happened, he then played
along with the bettors, and the authorities soon
uncovered a fixing network that included four
New York schools.
Reporters naturally asked Adolph Rupp,
coach of the number one team in the country,
for his opinions and whether such a scandal
could develop at Kentucky. "Those bettors
couldn't touch any of my players with a ten
foot pole." After the final investigations, six
Kentucky players were among a total of 32
players from seven schools eventually found
guilty of conspiring to fix games. New York
sports writers sent him an eleven-foot pole.
Also fair game for the critics were the
bonuses paid out by schools vying for athletes.
Closely aligned with this argument is the state
ment made by Clair Bee, coach of involved
Long Island University, a year after the scan
dal. "We (coaches) sabotaged the public's faith
and students' loyalty by turning a game into
a business." He went on to describe how the
recruiting policies of the basketball power
houses had led to a vicious circle that started
with an overemphasis on winning.
Intense recruiting was ncessary to produce
winning teams, which in turn was necessary
to produce enough money to take several trips
across the country to build up the team's repu
tation and to pay for the recruiting.
College Athletics More Susceptible
Professional baseball survived its serious
crisis, and other sports such as horse racing
and p/ofessional football have also survived
setbacks involving conflict of interests of cer
tain participants. Uniquely susceptible to col
lusion between athletes and outsiders, college
athletics does not recover as fully as profes
sional sports.
The college athlete by the offer of scholar
ships and other inducements had, in a sense,

been bribed to attend a certain university. Bpt
what was his reward after entering? He €fcw
large paying crowds at the games and so&n
began asking themselves where they fit ii)to
this system that benefited the school more th«n
him. Asking more from this situation than lie
was receiving, he succumbed to bettors' offe?s.
What type of janitorial job did the colleges
perform after the scandal? On an individual
basis, some drastic actions did result. Cliiir
Bee's employer, Long Island University, (fid
not consider varsity basketball success worth
a possible recurrence of the face-losing ex
perience it had gone through and dropped tlje
sport completely. The national organization
did not have the money to set up a permanent
internal control system. Because of
diversity of views, it rejected the giving (>f
broad powers to a commissioner-type post. *
Athletes' Cooperation
*
It still depended on total co-operation of the
athletes and the coaches and made an effort
to concentrate on disseminating information
outlining the perils of betting in college sporfe.
An individual conference might initiate a limit
ed investigation, but because of the large
number of college teams and their location in
different parts of the country, only the Fiji
was capable of successfully coping with the
problem.
Questionnaires and instructive forms a#e
currently used by various universities and con
ferences to aid in the fight against fixing, bQt
the prime reason for their use is to have or>
record evidence that minmum preventive stefls
were performed, if an incident does occur. *
No Recruiting Changes
Except for minor modifications and limita
tions, colleges have not changed their recruit
ing practices, which, many still insist, we£r
thin an athlete's moral fiber and make him
susceptible to fixers.
Point spreads and the ability
of individuals to dominate a
team make basketball easy to
fix, but football has not totally
escaped the attention of the
fixers. As recently as last Octo
ber, three backfield stars of

Louisiana State University were
offered a total of $1,200 to influ
ence the outcomes of six games.
As they look about them for
possible relief from a system
that encourages rather than dis
courages abuses of betting, col
leges might support legislation
limiting college games or they
might better strike nearer to the
solution by following Clair Bee's
suggestion to de-emphasize.
The vicious circle of winning
and recruiting produced inter

esting teams that lured crowds
to see them play, but in only one
year did his team make money.
In fact, in its last year of opera
tion, it lost $25,000.
Bee contends that the decision
to de-emphasize would not in
volve a much greater outlay of
expenses than before. Schools of
long-standing could make the
step easier than newer schools
because of large endowments
which would help support a less
intense system.
De-Emphasis At Stanford
Johns Hopkins and the Ivy
League schools have made the
transition, but an university like
Stanford would find it hard to
eliminate football: "Expense
could be cut substantially, how
ever, income to support other
sports would also be wiped out!"
An effort in this direction
should be made, nevertheless, at
this and similar institutions if
the remark of Willard Manus,
who wrote a novel based on the
1951 basketball fixing scandal,
is correct, "Where there is re
cruiting and tampering, there
will, inevitably, be fixing."

suggestion to de-emphasize.
The vicious circle of winning
and recruiting produced inter

esting teams that lured crowds
to see them play, but in only one
year did his team make money.
In fact, in its last year of opera
tion, it lost $25,000.
Bee contends that the decision
to de-emphasize would not in
volve a much greater outlay of
expenses than before. Schools of
long-standing could make the
step easier than newer schools
because of large endowments
which would help support a less
intense system.
De-Emphasis At Stanford
Johns Hopkins and the Ivy
League schools have made the
transition, but an university like
Stanford would find it hard to
eliminate football: "Expense
could be cut substantially, how
ever, income to support other
sports would also be wiped out!"
An effort in this direction
should be made, nevertheless, at
this and similar institutions if
the remark of Willard Manus,
who wrote a novel based on the
1951 basketball fixing scandal,
is correct, "Where there is re
cruiting and tampering, there
will, inevitably, be fixing."

Symbiosis: Gambling and Sports
VJ Events of this century have shown that un
'less they are checked gambling interests that
~„( d rift and profiteer in the wake of fairly played

sports will form a symbiotic attachment and
slowly sap the sport's strength. Sports have
always been a favorite realm for bettors, and
they began their fixing activities on the level
of professional baseball. The first sports scan
dal of this century in the United States and
still the most celebrated case was the 1919
World Series fix.
Various sources made loud accusations after
the favorite Chicago White Sox lost in unspec
tacular fashion. Answering the critics of the
series, the official organ of professional base
ball found the cries of foul play impossible to
take seriously. "It seeems that the 'dope'
craze has gone a little beyond the bounds of
reason and . . . justice." But then evidence
came to light the next year which succeeded
in barring eight players from professional
baseball for life.
The principals involved, pitcher Eddie Ci
cotte and star hitter Arnold Gandil, had agreed
to bring in six others, and in return for throw
ing the series the group would receive a total
of $100,000.
To understand how gamblers can make in
roads into college sports and eventually in
fluence outcomes, an examination of how they
operate is necessary. Gambling gravitates
towards the dollar sign, and it is not surprising
that New York City, the business center of the
country, has long been the center of the large
gambling syndicates.
Bookmakers operate, naturally, in sports
that command the most widespread interest
and will stimulate the most betting. At first,
the national pastime, baseball, was the most
important item. The sudden emergence after
the Second World War of basketball and foot
ball shifted gamblers' emphasis. By 1960, paid
customers witnessing college basketball games
numbered 150,000,000. This interest accounted
for the daily betting figure of $15 million.
Betting in basketball and football is on a
point spread basis. For example, if Team A is

favored to defeat Team B by nine points, the
"line" is a 10-8 spread on A. Bettors on A
win if it wins by ten or more points while B
bettors collect if their team wins or loses by
eight or less. Bookies win everything if the
final margin is nine points.
How It Works
The bettors have the most to gain by fixing
a game's outcome. If a gambler bets heavily on
the underdog, he has probably bribed a star
player on the favorite to keep the winning
margin beneath the point spread. Heavy bet
ting on the favorite could mean that a bribed
star on the underdog would make sure his
team lost by more than the point spread.
The fixers range from professionals like
Irving Schwartzberg, who masterminded the
operation that turned into the 1951 basketball
scandal in N.Y.C., to amateurs like barber
Joe Graziano, who was apprehended last Octo
ber trying to fix L.S.U. football games. If they
can get players to hit the point spread exactly,
bookmakers can make killings by fixing. That
this happened at least twelve times during
the 1951 season indicates that this was prob
ably done.
When Dr. Forrest Allen predicted in 1944
that a fixing scandal in college basketball was
imminent unless positive steps were immedi
ately taken, he was attacked for his meager
confidence in the integrity ol both American
youth and his fellow coaches. The college com
munity could not be prodded to action until
his prediction came true in 1951. Because of
the Kefauver congreessional investigation into
gambling activities at that time, the public
was finally waking up to the existence of wide
spread illicit betting.
Star Center Is A Stoolie
The key person in exposing the fixers was
Junius Kellogg, a star center for Manhattan
College in New York City. He was approached
by bettors and offered $1,000 to throw a game

and make sure his team lost by more than
seven points. After contacting his coach and
telling him what happened, he then played
along with the bettors, and the authorities soon
uncovered a fixing network that included four
New York schools.
Reporters naturally asked Adolph Rupp,
coach of the number one team in the country,
for his opinions and whether such a scandal
could develop at Kentucky. "Those bettors
couldn't touch any of my players with a ten
foot pole." After the final investigations, six
Kentucky players were among a total of 32
players from seven schools eventually found
guilty of conspiring to fix games. New York
sports writers sent him an eleven-foot pole.
Also fair game for the critics were the
bonuses paid out by schools vying for athletes.
Closely aligned with this argument is the state
ment made by Clair Bee, coach of involved
Long Island University, a year after the scan
dal. "We (coaches) sabotaged the public's faith
and students' loyalty by turning a game into
a business." He went on to describe how the
recruiting policies of the basketball power
houses had led to a vicious circle that started
with an overemphasis on winning.
Intense recruiting was ncessary to produce
winning teams, which in turn was necessary
to produce enough money to take several trips
across the country to build up the team's repu
tation and to pay for the recruiting.
College Athletics More Susceptible
Professional baseball survived its serious
crisis, and other sports such as horse racing
and p/ofessional football have also survived
setbacks involving conflict of interests of cer
tain participants. Uniquely susceptible to col
lusion between athletes and outsiders, college
athletics does not recover as fully as profes
sional sports.
The college athlete by the offer of scholar
ships and other inducements had, in a sense,

been bribed to attend a certain university. Bpt
what was his reward after entering? He €fcw
large paying crowds at the games and so&n
began asking themselves where they fit ii)to
this system that benefited the school more th«n
him. Asking more from this situation than lie
was receiving, he succumbed to bettors' offe?s.
What type of janitorial job did the colleges
perform after the scandal? On an individual
basis, some drastic actions did result. Cliiir
Bee's employer, Long Island University, (fid
not consider varsity basketball success worth
a possible recurrence of the face-losing ex
perience it had gone through and dropped tlje
sport completely. The national organization
did not have the money to set up a permanent
internal control system. Because of
diversity of views, it rejected the giving (>f
broad powers to a commissioner-type post. *
Athletes' Cooperation
*
It still depended on total co-operation of the
athletes and the coaches and made an effort
to concentrate on disseminating information
outlining the perils of betting in college sporfe.
An individual conference might initiate a limit
ed investigation, but because of the large
number of college teams and their location in
different parts of the country, only the Fiji
was capable of successfully coping with the
problem.
Questionnaires and instructive forms a#e
currently used by various universities and con
ferences to aid in the fight against fixing, bQt
the prime reason for their use is to have or>
record evidence that minmum preventive stefls
were performed, if an incident does occur. *
No Recruiting Changes
Except for minor modifications and limita
tions, colleges have not changed their recruit
ing practices, which, many still insist, we£r
thin an athlete's moral fiber and make him
susceptible to fixers.
Point spreads and the ability
of individuals to dominate a
team make basketball easy to
fix, but football has not totally
escaped the attention of the
fixers. As recently as last Octo
ber, three backfield stars of

Louisiana State University were
offered a total of $1,200 to influ
ence the outcomes of six games.
As they look about them for
possible relief from a system
that encourages rather than dis
courages abuses of betting, col
leges might support legislation
limiting college games or they
might better strike nearer to the
solution by following Clair Bee's
suggestion to de-emphasize.
