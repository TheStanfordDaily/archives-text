# Fixing In College Sports...An Inevitability?
## 
### 
Point spreads and the ability
of individuals to dominate a
team make basketball easy to
fix, but football has not totally
escaped the attention of the
fixers. As recently as last Octo
ber, three backfield stars of

Louisiana State University were
offered a total of $1,200 to influ
ence the outcomes of six games.
As they look about them for
possible relief from a system
that encourages rather than dis
courages abuses of betting, col
leges might support legislation
limiting college games or they
might better strike nearer to the
solution by following Clair Bee's
suggestion to de-emphasize.
The vicious circle of winning
and recruiting produced inter

esting teams that lured crowds
to see them play, but in only one
year did his team make money.
In fact, in its last year of opera
tion, it lost $25,000.
Bee contends that the decision
to de-emphasize would not in
volve a much greater outlay of
expenses than before. Schools of
long-standing could make the
step easier than newer schools
because of large endowments
which would help support a less
intense system.
De-Emphasis At Stanford
Johns Hopkins and the Ivy
League schools have made the
transition, but an university like
Stanford would find it hard to
eliminate football: "Expense
could be cut substantially, how
ever, income to support other
sports would also be wiped out!"
An effort in this direction
should be made, nevertheless, at
this and similar institutions if
the remark of Willard Manus,
who wrote a novel based on the
1951 basketball fixing scandal,
is correct, "Where there is re
cruiting and tampering, there
will, inevitably, be fixing."
