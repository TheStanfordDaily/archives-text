Like many others in this University, we are
excited by the Grove project. It is a hopeful
first step out of the miasma of the present hous
ing system toward a true residence university.
And unlike some, we still believe in this goal —
not enforced residence in sterile and overpriced
dormitories* but a system in which the living
unit forms a meaningful and invigorating part
of the total education experience.
Yet we are becoming increasingly concerned
that forces are presently operating which can
only be detrimental to the project. Despite Uni
versity disclaimers that the future of coed hous
ing is not predicated on the "success" of the
Grove, the spectre of official scrutiny is making
its haunting presence felt among those most
directly involved with the project. More and
more voices are urging that the Grove be a
"showcase" living group, leaning over back
wards to avoid any violation of the various Uni
versity regulations now "in force."
That the powers that be should have their
telescopes turned toward the Grove, we ap
plaud. Hopefully they will gain the inspiration

for a workable and livable residence program.
But they should not expect to see the enforce
ment of regulations almost universally disre
garded throughout the rest of the campus.
We question the compatibility of present re
gulations with any residential program, but the
notion that they should be applied with especial
vigor in a coed living group seeems to us parti
cularly unfortunate — the result of an anti
quated philosophy we hoped Stanford was be
ginning to outgrow. If this attitude prevails, the
outcome may well be to make the Grove less
a "coed" residence than many of the existing
"segregated" living groups.
The way to discover new approaches toward
a meaningful residential program is not the
continued application of past failures. We con
fess freely we don't know all the requisites for
a successful program, but we are convinced that
the highest feasible level of individual freedom
is among the first.
We therefore oppose all attempts to encumber
the Grove with bankrupt and obsolescent regu
lations and trust that all pressures to do so will
be resisted.

cularly unfortunate — the result of an anti
quated philosophy we hoped Stanford was be
ginning to outgrow. If this attitude prevails, the
outcome may well be to make the Grove less
a "coed" residence than many of the existing
"segregated" living groups.
The way to discover new approaches toward
a meaningful residential program is not the
continued application of past failures. We con
fess freely we don't know all the requisites for
a successful program, but we are convinced that
the highest feasible level of individual freedom
is among the first.
We therefore oppose all attempts to encumber
the Grove with bankrupt and obsolescent regu
lations and trust that all pressures to do so will
be resisted.
