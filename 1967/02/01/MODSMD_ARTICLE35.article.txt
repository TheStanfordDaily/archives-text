## Britain II Student Replies To Poll 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
As a less critical member of
Britain 11, I feel that some less
critical reactions to the group
experience should be voiced
along with the polled opinions
reported in January 27 Daily.
Difficulty in meeting people
has been overemphasized. The
Pubs were congenial, but so
were the groups of folk singers
and folk dancers, as well as
church fellowships. Hitch-hike
lifts were usually very friendly,
with offers for tea in private
homes, or coffee at a roadside
cafe, or a beer at the corner
pub; many local people followed
through with later visits, notes,
and invitations to the new "Am
erican friends". Students from
hostels throughout the British
Isles were kind to many stu
dents with some even inviting
us to their homes. The Royal
Air Force Cadets were frequent
callers and admirers of the Har
laxton Dollies. Exchanges with
Nottingham and Leicester stu
dents were perhaps infrequent,
but several teachers' colleges in
vited students to their campuses
for atheletic and cultural
events. Local hospitality was
continuous children playing on
the manor fields and grounds
inviting students home to meet
"Mum and Dad", Grantham Ro
tary Club inviting students to
club luncheons, local lawyers in
viting interested prelaw stu
dents to visit with them in their
offices, etc. Possibilities for
meeting the people were not
"limited."
The Academics in my opin
ion, were not "a joke". Opinions
of disorganization of the Gen
eral Studies Courses have some
validity although course out
lines, reading, and requirements
were made quite explicit. Lec
ture titles were pre-announced
so that students could choose
their areas of concentration,
often as follow-ups on studies in
their majors. American profes
sors were quite adaptable in ad
justing the standards and work
loads of their courses to meet
the foreign campus situation.

The suggested pre-requisite ol
directed history and current af
fairs readings would, perhaps,
assist in specializing the Gen
eral Studies courses in future
groups but our "broad, over-lap
ping" courses were not a "waste
of time". Perhaps we students
were "the waste" in not doing
all the readings, skipping the
conferences, failing to talk with
the professors at meals, or crit
icizing without taking any in
itiative for improvement.

• Self-knowledge
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to thank Dr.
James Paulsen for his excellent
article concerning LSD. It's good
to hear a viewpoint so seldom
verbally stated on a college cam
pus, that a god helps those who
help themselves. Or to para
phrase the moral in another epi
thet, you get out of something
exactly what you put in.
It seems to me that Dr. Paul
sen is indirectly commenting on
one of the ever-present chal
lenges of a college education:
that of relating your college edu
cation to yourself. Two thousand
years, and one still hears once
in a while Socrates' maxim, "Ed
ucation is a process of self
knowledge."
Or . . .as Joyce's Dedalus com
mented, "I'm using Thomas
Aquinas as a stepping stone for
my own theory of aesthetics."
One could go on ad infinitum

• Price Is Right
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to clear up some
of the perennial questions about
prices at Tresidder Union. Since
the Union opened in the fall of
'62 we have changed prices sev
eral times. At first we found
that we were making more
money than we should, so we
lowered the price of hamburg
ers. During the year of 1964 we
also increased the size of the

coffee cup by 50 percent, and
lowered the prices of chili and
stew.
In the meantime, the price of
labor and food was beginning
to spiral upwards. At first we
were able to partially absorb
these increases by a rise in vol
ume. However, in the last year,
not only has volume fallen off,
but our labor costs have in
creased $1,800 a month and food
costs have increased $1,500 a
month.
We all know what is causing
this inflation, but there doesn't
seem to be anything we can do
about stopping it, so something
has to give. The Union is
already subsidized by the Uni
versity, and it couldn't go on
losing indefinitely. Last spring,
at the insistence of the students
involved and Union Director Dr.
Berry, only a few prices were
raised in hopes that the trend
would change. Obviously it has
n't, and we were forced to raise
some others in later months. It
should be noted that these were
just stages in one general price
increase and not 3 separate
ones, compared to two substan
tial general price increases by
the University food service dur
ing the same period.
But things are not as bad as
some would make them. A
critical study was just com
pleted by a group of students
who visited nine other establish
ments in the area that are most
frequented by students, compar
ing the Union to these places
on several different scales. The
average price of food over the
entire spectrum that the Union
sells was $0,341 compared to a
average price of $0,603 for the
other places, nearly 100 percent
difference. The Union is doing
all it can to keep prices down.
Any questions can be referred
to Dr. Berry or myself.

• Missed
Editor, The Daily:
The aims of Volume 151 of
The Daily were stated on its

editorial page, but the results
were not evident on Page One.
Having been a witness to Mr.
Lynch's speech, I have valid rea
sons to believe that some of his
statements were distorted in
Monday's Daily. My points are:
1) The choice of a headline
seeemed to be blatant yellow
journalism. Mr. Lynch's topic
was "The Negro in American
Society," not "Negro Concentra
tion Camps."
2) Mr. Lynch stated that these
"Concentration camps" are to be
used for political prisoners, not
"to imprison the Negro race
wholesale" as the Daily reported.
3) The "possible use of huns"
was not used in a domestic
sense.
4) The Minutemen were men
tioned in response to a question.
5) Mr. Lynch spoke on Satur
day, not Friday.

• PhUlipic
Editor, The Daily:
A simple desultory phillipic,
Or a really "radical" view on
acid:
Who needs it, baby,
When you can turn on your
mind
With such mind-expanding
profs at the U.
As Sokel, Mothershead, Guer
ard, Napier,
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera,
To name but a few.
