## Provincial Patter Obscures Education 
### Joel Kugelmass 
Mr. Coffin says the University
ought to provide a major in
Urban Affairs, and we say, "yes,
wouldn't it be nice." Mr. Harris
asserts that the University must
have a structure which reflects
the liberal value of egalitarian
ism, and we say "yes, wouldn't
it be nice." The suggestions for
a relevant education multiply,
and the audience murmurs,

"that's right, yes, quite true."
Mr. Coffin, Mr. Harris, Mr.
Sanford, and the many others
go home; they will come back
as they have for so many years.
They come back to Memorial
Auditorium because they care.
Too bad they are talking to
themselves.
Students are apt to care about
caring, to be committed to com
mitment. But to what are they
committed, to what do they give
their care?
Let them speak for them
selves: 'His immediate insist
ence that women wear skirts to
all meals was regarded by many
as an imposition of a 'very per
sonal' value judgement." Or one
hears "dinner is by candlelight;
ironically, the napkins are of
paper and of poor quality." In
fact, the napkins itch. An iden
tity crisis at the Emporium.
Usually provincialism is mere
ly dull. At a University it is
dangerous. It is dangerous be
cause it does not only stand
against education, but renders
it prostrate and moaning. It
makes a bookstore into a gift
shoppe. It cries out that educa
tion must be relevant. Relevant,
to what? Relevant to whom?
To the weave of napkins, to the
cut of cloth, to the trip of a
lonely and unhappy hippy?
The provincial order grits at
the Waldorf; he is willing to
pay three grand for a meal. The
waiter excuses himself, runs
across to a coffee shop, brings
back a white pulpy mess. The
customer eats, reflects, and eats
some more. "They're good," he
states, "but not real good." The
provincial wipes his face on the
tablecloth and excuses himself.
He is excused.
The student sits down at din
ner with a professor. The pro
fessor eats. The student eats.
They are eating together. The
dinner is over; the student ex
cuses himself: "Excuse me, I
have to go book." He is excused.
What manner of act is this,
this "going to book?"
book, verb (from the OHG
beinehelfen). 1. to open a book.
2. to close a book. 3. to carry a
book. 4. common usage: to have
booked. SYN see Philistined.
If the students are to justify
their demands to themselves,
they must also justify them
selves to their demands. If the
student's world is to small, he
may be able only to see the
smaller part of his education.
We demand to be able to con
stitute our own lives. Bravo. But
if our lives are studies in pro
vincialisms, which others damn
them, don't share (please do not
wear a pettiness to dinner), we
can no longer expect our educa
tion to change.
How in the world would we
recognize it if it did?

student's world is to small, he
may be able only to see the
smaller part of his education.
We demand to be able to con
stitute our own lives. Bravo. But
if our lives are studies in pro
vincialisms, which others damn
them, don't share (please do not
wear a pettiness to dinner), we
can no longer expect our educa
tion to change.
How in the world would we
recognize it if it did?
Mr. Coffin says the University
ought to provide a major in
Urban Affairs, and we say, "yes,
wouldn't it be nice." Mr. Harris
asserts that the University must
have a structure which reflects
the liberal value of egalitarian
ism, and we say "yes, wouldn't
it be nice." The suggestions for
a relevant education multiply,
and the audience murmurs,

"that's right, yes, quite true."
Mr. Coffin, Mr. Harris, Mr.
Sanford, and the many others
go home; they will come back
as they have for so many years.
They come back to Memorial
Auditorium because they care.
Too bad they are talking to
themselves.
Students are apt to care about
caring, to be committed to com
mitment. But to what are they
committed, to what do they give
their care?
Let them speak for them
selves: 'His immediate insist
ence that women wear skirts to
all meals was regarded by many
as an imposition of a 'very per
sonal' value judgement." Or one
hears "dinner is by candlelight;
ironically, the napkins are of
paper and of poor quality." In
fact, the napkins itch. An iden
tity crisis at the Emporium.
Usually provincialism is mere
ly dull. At a University it is
dangerous. It is dangerous be
cause it does not only stand
against education, but renders
it prostrate and moaning. It
makes a bookstore into a gift
shoppe. It cries out that educa
tion must be relevant. Relevant,
to what? Relevant to whom?
To the weave of napkins, to the
cut of cloth, to the trip of a
lonely and unhappy hippy?
The provincial order grits at
the Waldorf; he is willing to
pay three grand for a meal. The
waiter excuses himself, runs
across to a coffee shop, brings
back a white pulpy mess. The
customer eats, reflects, and eats
some more. "They're good," he
states, "but not real good." The
provincial wipes his face on the
tablecloth and excuses himself.
He is excused.
The student sits down at din
ner with a professor. The pro
fessor eats. The student eats.
They are eating together. The
dinner is over; the student ex
cuses himself: "Excuse me, I
have to go book." He is excused.
What manner of act is this,
this "going to book?"
book, verb (from the OHG
beinehelfen). 1. to open a book.
2. to close a book. 3. to carry a
book. 4. common usage: to have
booked. SYN see Philistined.
