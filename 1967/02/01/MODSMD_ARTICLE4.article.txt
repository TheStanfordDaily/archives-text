# Jacks House Delayed Indefinitely; Moore To Be Ready By Sept. '68
## 
### JAY BOSWORTH 
David and Margaret Jacks Hall, the
coeducational dormitory to be located
on the site of the present Deke and
Fiji houses 1 , has been postponed in
definitely.
Provost Richard Lyman said the
action taken could be best described
as a "delay," but that the similar
Robert Moore Hall would proceed as
planned. Mr. Lyman cited numerous
reasons for reconsideration of Jacks.
Reasons For Delay
—The Federal Government has
placed a freeze on loans under the
Home and House Finance Agency. If
the University went ahead with both
Moore and Jacks, the move would be
a financial gamble. While other fac
tors contributed to the decision, this
unavailability of government funds
triggered the action. The Board of
Trustees were informed of the post
ponement at their January meeting.
—Opening of both dormitories at
the same time would be disadvantag
eous. Hopefully, by concentrating on
Moore, final design and construction

deadlines can be met, and the planned
occupancy date of September, 1968,
will be realized. In contrast to Jacks,
Moore has no seminar rooms, faculty
residences, or tutor suites.
—Although preliminary proposals
for Jacks were received with con
siderable enthusiasm, little progress
was made on an academic program
for the hall. No faculty members
have been recruited, nor has the ex
act nature of the "educational input"
been determined.
Deke, Fiji Houses
—Had Jacks proceeded on schedule,
the Deke and Fiji houses would have
been demolished before their new
houses in the third cluster could be
finished. Robert Summers, Director
of Fraternities told The Daily the
final plans for the new cluster houses
had been received and would be sub
mitted to the individual fraternities
for approval. If all goes well, con
struction of the cluster, to be located
on Campus Drive next to the Student
Health Center, should begin in May
or June.
Provost Lyman's fifth point con
cerned the recently initiated study on
education at Stanford, to be headed
by Vice Provost Herbert Packer. Any
new housing is subject to reevalua
tion pending the recommendations of
the executive committee concerning
residential policy at Stanford. The
poll conducted last quarter by the
Office of the Dean of Students indi
cated dissatisfaction among under
graduate women with their present
housing and a preference for campus
housing in the form of apartments.
This poll and the OFF petition had
a definite effect upon the Jacks decis
ion reached by the President and his
staff after consideration of all
aspects.
Dormitories' Features
Moore and Jacks Halls were first
proposed during the spring of 1965.
They were to be identical, each hous

ing 140 men and 140 women, with
central dining and recreational facili
ties, lounge, study, seminar rooms,
and a master's residence. In addition
there would be two tutors' suites and
a faculty residence for every 70
students. The planners foresaw the
possibility of fusing education with
housing by scheduling senior col
loquia and other small seminar
courses in the seminar rooms. Later
the seminar rooms and faculty resi
dences were removed from th<~ * ns
of Moore, but these could be t'UO fly
added if the Jacks plan proved suc
cessful.
