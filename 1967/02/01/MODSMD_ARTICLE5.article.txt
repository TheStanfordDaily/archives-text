# C15 Refers OFF Question To Executive Committee
## 
### MAGGIE MCCOMAS Staff Editor 
The Committee of Fifteen has de
cided to refer the OFF issue to the
newly formed Executive Committee
for the reappraisal of educational pro
grams.
The decision came after a vote of 12
in favor with 1 absention at the Janu
ary 24 meeting. Committeee of Fifteen
had brought the issue under consider
ation upon the request of a LASSU
resolution.
Prof. Herbert Packer, vice-provost
and head of the Executive Committee,
said that the issue will have "high
priority" on the committee's agenda.
He said that the committeee is in the
process of designating persons to
study feasible solutions to the OFF
question.
Efficient Ex Comm
Prof. Philip Rhinelander, chairman
of Cl 5, said that the prime reason for
referring the matter to the Executive
Committee was that it could "most
efficiently" study all aspects of the
problem and suggest possible solu
tions.

A Cl 5 subcommittee had investi
gated the issue shortly after the pres
entation of the LASSU resolution and
found that the Packer Committee was
already in the process of planning a
study of the OFF issue.
"The purpose of Cl 5 is to thrash
out issues when a solution has not
been found," Rhinelander said. "In this
case, we felt that the best possible
action for us was to give the Packer
committee the 'go-ahead' signal."
Criticism
Committeeman Tom Forstenzer,
LASSU Speaker, said that he felt that
the committee's action was "wrong."
While he agreed that the committee's
capacity is advisory, Forstenzer point
ed out that the issue had been speci
fically referred to the members by
LASSU and that there should have
been firmer action taken on the mat
ter.
The resolution as passed by the
committee is as follows:
1) We believe that the question of
off campus housing for undergraduate
women is an Important issue which
requires early consideration, and we
approve of the plan of the Packer
Committee to proceed immediately to
a study of the problem. (Passed: 12
for, 1 abstention.) $
2) We understand that the Packer
Committee plans to include students
with full voting membership on the
group studying this issue, and on the
basis of our experience over the past
year ami a half, we urge that this
type of participation be provided.
(Passed: 7 for, 5 against, 1 absten
tion.)
Resolution 'Unclear'
Packer said that the second portion
of the resolution seemed "unclear" as
to its purpose, since it was decided
at the time of the formation of the
Executive Committee that the group
would include students with full vot
ing rights.
The Cl 5 did not consider the method
of election of students for the Execu
tive Committee, as this issue has not
been referred to Cl 5.
"This action doesn't mean that the

issue is dead as far as Cl 5 is con
cerned," said Forstenzer, adding that
it was "presumptuous" of the commit
tee members to make the commen
dation. Forstenzer and ASSU presi
dent David Harris were meeting with
the Board of Trustees at the time of
the Cl 5 meeting and did not take part
in the decision.
OFF Effects Far Reaching
Prof. Rhinelander added that con
sideration of the OFF issue would fit
in with other activities of the Packer
Committeee. "The OFF issue is not
isolated," he said. "Any such change
in living arrangements would in
fluence other areas of the university.
For instance, it might seriously affect
the admissions policy." Rhinelander
added that if results of the Executive
Committee's study are not satisfac
tory, the issue can be referred back
to Cl 5.
