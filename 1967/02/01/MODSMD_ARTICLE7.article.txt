# KITS NOT USED
## No ROTC Spies At Stanford 
### GAIL ANDERSON 
Stanford ROTC received the con
troversial "spy kit" sent to all West
Coast units but decided the material
was "not only superfluous but offen
sive," a student cadet here revealed
yesterday.
However Major Robert Siderious,
Stanford ROTC public information of
ficer, said he had no knowledge that
any such kits had even been received.
"If such a kit is in existence," he add
ed, "we probably wouldn't use it any
way. We have no desire to enter into
campus politics."
The first report that the "spy kits"
had been widely distributed came in
the January 15 Sunday Ramparts.
Rampart's Report
"The United States Army has been
disseminating training kits to ROTC
units at major West Coast universities
which identify SDS, SNSS, the Dubois
Club, and other student political
groups as 'Communist dominated,
Communist influenced, and Commu
nist oriented,'" it reported.

According to the newspaper, thee
kits consist of three slides and an ac
companying commentary.
The first slide pictures a map of
the West Coast with red dots marking
major cities. The second identifies the
dots as various headquarters for
groups such as SDS and SNCC.
The third shows three ducks with
the legend below: "If it walks like a
duck, talks like a duck, and lays eggs
like a duck, then it is a duck."
Secrecy
Recent controversy has surrounded
the showing of these slides to cadets
at the University of Washington under
secret conditions. The students were
reportedly instructed to collect files
on fellow students belonging to the
organizations named. This prompted
an exchange of letters between the
President of the university and the
commander of the Presidio, Gen. J. L.
Richardson.
General Richardson's public rela
tions officer, Col. Balish, commented
to Ramparts that he was unable either

to substantiate or deny the accusation.
Col. Balish told The Daily yesterday
that "the kits sent out by Army head
quarters have worked successfully,
notably at Berkeley."
The material, he said, concerned
certain activities in which students
were warned not to get involved if
they wanted to receive their commis
sions.
ROTC Denys Spying
However, he added, "ROTC students
are never required to spy on anyone."
"The ROTC at Stanford," a student
enrolled in the program said, "has
no objections to a student belonging
to an organization as long as it is not
on the Attorney General's list of sub
versive organizations. The only group
listed of any import that I know of
is the Dußois Clubs." Membership in
other organizations, however, could
be embarrassing or could endanger a
student's being commissioned. "They
ask us only to use discretion," he said.

Secrecy
Recent controversy has surrounded
the showing of these slides to cadets
at the University of Washington under
secret conditions. The students were
reportedly instructed to collect files
on fellow students belonging to the
organizations named. This prompted
an exchange of letters between the
President of the university and the
commander of the Presidio, Gen. J. L.
Richardson.
General Richardson's public rela
tions officer, Col. Balish, commented
to Ramparts that he was unable either

to substantiate or deny the accusation.
Col. Balish told The Daily yesterday
that "the kits sent out by Army head
quarters have worked successfully,
notably at Berkeley."
The material, he said, concerned
certain activities in which students
were warned not to get involved if
they wanted to receive their commis
sions.
ROTC Denys Spying
However, he added, "ROTC students
are never required to spy on anyone."
"The ROTC at Stanford," a student
enrolled in the program said, "has
no objections to a student belonging
to an organization as long as it is not
on the Attorney General's list of sub
versive organizations. The only group
listed of any import that I know of
is the Dußois Clubs." Membership in
other organizations, however, could
be embarrassing or could endanger a
student's being commissioned. "They
ask us only to use discretion," he said.
ROTC carries both academic and
activity credit at Stanford.
Stanford ROTC received the con
troversial "spy kit" sent to all West
Coast units but decided the material
was "not only superfluous but offen
sive," a student cadet here revealed
yesterday.
However Major Robert Siderious,
Stanford ROTC public information of
ficer, said he had no knowledge that
any such kits had even been received.
"If such a kit is in existence," he add
ed, "we probably wouldn't use it any
way. We have no desire to enter into
campus politics."
The first report that the "spy kits"
had been widely distributed came in
the January 15 Sunday Ramparts.
Rampart's Report
"The United States Army has been
disseminating training kits to ROTC
units at major West Coast universities
which identify SDS, SNSS, the Dubois
Club, and other student political
groups as 'Communist dominated,
Communist influenced, and Commu
nist oriented,'" it reported.

According to the newspaper, thee
kits consist of three slides and an ac
companying commentary.
The first slide pictures a map of
the West Coast with red dots marking
major cities. The second identifies the
dots as various headquarters for
groups such as SDS and SNCC.
The third shows three ducks with
the legend below: "If it walks like a
duck, talks like a duck, and lays eggs
like a duck, then it is a duck."
