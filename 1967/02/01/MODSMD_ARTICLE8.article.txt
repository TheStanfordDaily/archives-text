# Anti-Draft Union Clarifies Petition Statements
## 
### NICK SELBY 
Stanford's Anti-Draft Union devoted
the major part of its third meeting to
clarifying its position in the petitions
it has been circulating to Stanford
students. Leonard Siegal chaired a
meeting of 22 people in Tresidder
last night.
The Union, which defines itself as
a semi-autonomous body within the
Students for a Democratic Society
(SDS), had been circulating both a
petition which expressed opposition to
the draft, and a sheeet with two state
ments qualifying this opposition.
The clarifying statement said, "As
a young man of draft age, I will not
allow myself to be conscripted" and
offered as an alternative "I will not
fight in Vietnam."
New Qualifications
When the first statement came un
der question, David Ransom sug_?sted
that the clarifying sheet be changed
to contain these alternatives: 1, "I will
not cooperate with the Selective Ser
vice;" 2, "I will not allow myself to
be conscripted into the military"; and
3, "I will not fight in Vietnam".
A fourth alternative allowing for
any other qualifications was deleted
from the proposal for a new sheet.
The people at the meeting approved
the new alternatives by a vote of 21-1.
Their reason for the new clarifications
was to make sure that the Union
would be able to include almost all
forms of opposition to the draft while

insuring a well-defined position for
those signing the petition.
Demonstrations
The Union's next important con
sideration was the form its demonstra
tions ought to take. General agree
ment was reached on the proposal that
the best channel for anti-draft energy
would lie within the living commu
nities.
Joe Reich's proposal was to develop
"dorm organization" so that people
in living groups would be aware of
each other's position. He said that
such organization would allow more
discussions at meals and make for
less need to have meetings in Tresid
der.
Reich added that it would also
allow each member of the Union to
join in active opposition to the draft
within his own abilities.
More Publicity
The Union's desire for greater pub
licity, another major concern of the
meeting, was reflected in a statement
concerning demonstrations, that if the
Union could get 30 people to return
their draft cards to the Selective Ser
vice along with Dave Harris, it would
receive a wave of publicity.
The meeting decided that it would
have members of the Union's pub
licity committee man a desk in
White Plaza for the rest of the week.
Among the other matters which the
Union intended to take up were re
search, community action, and an
nouncements.
Fear The Reason
The Anti-Draft Union says that it
has had trouble in getting people to
sign petitions because those people

fear their draft boards. Secretary
Gary Coutin cites this as a major
reason for the formation of the
Union.
The Union's petition reads, "We op

pose the draft because it is a coercive
and intimidating way by which a gov
ernment is able to eect foreign and
domestic policies against the interest
of its people."
