# Reagan's Budget Calls For Tuition, Reduces Higher Education Allotment
## 
### 
Gov. Ronald Reagan included a
request for tuition at state colleges
and universities in his budget pro
posal yesterday.
The budget, which also called for
a quick tax hike and spending cut
backs, is expected to have trouble
obtaining the necessary two-thirds
majority in the Democratic-controlled
Legislature.
Tuition would be $250 at the Uni
versity of California and $150 at the
state colleges.
30 Per Cent Cut
The budget also calls for a 30 per
cent slash in higher education ex
penditures. The $107 million reduc
tion in support to state colleges and
the university is based on Reagan's
10 percent across-the-board cutback
and the imposition of tuition at state
institutions of higher education.
The current spending of $1.88 bil
lion on all levels of education is re
duced to $1.78 billion in the proposed
1967-68 fiscal year state budget. The
entire cutback in the education bud
get is in the amount allotted for
higher education.
Reagan's budget proposes the state
spend $353.3 million* to support oper

ations, excluding building construc
tion, of the state colleges and uni
versity. This is a reduction of 15 per
cent from the current level of $422.5
million.
More than an 18 percent cut in
state support to the nine-campus uni
versity is planned; the allotment is
reduced from $240.6 million to $196.8
million. The support to state colleges
would be reduced by 12 percent, from
$175.7 million to $154.2 million.
Basis For Cutback
The deduction in the higher educa
tion budget is based on an across'the
board cutback of $26.4 million for the
University of California and $19.1
million for the 18-campus state col
lege system, another $21.5 million cut
to be offset by the use of university
resources and overhead, and revenues
of $20 million at the university and
$18 at the state colleges from tuition.
State Finance Director Gordon P.
Smith said that part of the revenues
obtained from tuition would be set
aside for scholarship programs. He
estimated that $4 million of the uni
versity tuition and $6 million from
state college tuition would be used
to finance scholarships.
