"There's no other business
like it"
"Routine," at least here at Burnett's, is strictly
minimal. About the only thing we do the same--one day
to the next--is show up in the morning. Some days we
come in earlier, to get the jump on a rough problem.
Other days, later--if we got away in the wee hours.
A long training program, at Burnett's, is notable
for its absence. No limbo-period of "backing into the
pay-line." You're assigned on Day One to a specific
department, a specific job. Doing real and meaning
ful work.
You find yourself wearing two hats. One for Burnett's
and one for the client. You are urged to think from
both points of view. And which hat is nearest your
head, most of the time? The client's.
%
Your age makes no difference. Time and seniority
aren't hooked up to Burnett promotions or titles. No
matter how new you are--if you've got what this agency
needs, it gets recognized. In a hurry.
Burnett's is a lean agency. Doers and thinker/doers
--not just thinkers. Everyone here pulls his own load,
and more. Over a thousand activists with never an ounce
of intellectual fat.
I could write a lot more about other surprises I've
found at Burnett's--and will, if you drop me a line.
But why not talk to our representative? He'll be on
the campus February 10.
