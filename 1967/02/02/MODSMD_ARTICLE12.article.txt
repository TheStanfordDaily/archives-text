# Nation Ponders Rising College Costs
## 
### 
(AP) — The rising cost of
higher education has led to steep
increases in college tuition char
ges across America, a nation
wide survey shows. In extreme
cases, fees have more than
doubled within five years.
Some state schools have been
driven recently to charging tui
tion for the first time.
In California, a row which
developed when Gov. Ronald
Reagan proposed tuition fees for
resident students resulted in
the ouster of Clark Kerr as
president of the University of
California. Kerr had opposed
both tuition and Reagan's pro
posal to cut the university's
budget.
Many educators have ex
pressed fear that mounting stu
dent charges will deprive chil
dren of low income families of a
chance to attend college.
Don Stevens, a member of
the Michigan State University
Board of Trustees, 'said: "Tui
tion is wrong in public educa
tion. It discriminates against

low income families and against
girls."
Mounting Costs
"If there are a boy and a girl
in the same family, .the boy gets
the nod. The brightest kids from
low-income families don't go to
college," Stevens said.
Taking note of mounting edu
cational costs, Gov. Kenneth M.
Curtis of Maine had this com
ment in his inaugural address
on Jan. 5:
"Our long-range objective
must be free education beyond
high school for every Maine boy
and girl who has the desire and
talent to use this education. We
will not achieve this objective
during my administration."
A student point of view was
voiced by Dan Allison, a mem
ber of the University of Oregon
Student Senate:
"We believe that higher edu
cation should be available to all
who wish to take advantage of
it, and raising tuition does not
move in this direction."
A pending proposal to raise

tuition fees in 22 state-sup
ported colleges in Texas by a
total of $44 million during the
next two years was denounced
by U.S. Sen. Ralph Yarborough
as "a tax on students" and "an
antieducation measure."
But almost everywhere, the
fees go up and up.
Tuition's Rise
Tuition at the University of
Minnesota costs resident stu
dents $375 a year, compared
with $275.45 five years ago, and
nonresidents $921, compared
with $622.55.
Utah State university charges
residents $282 against $180 in
1960, and nonresidents $639
against $285.
At Indiana's Purdue Universi
ty the tuition for residents went
from $240 to $330 in the past five
years, and for nonresidents
from $750 to $950.
California's academic blowup
came when Reagan, newly
elected governor, proposed state
educational budget cuts of about
10 per cent, with an offsetting

tuition charge—first in history—
on resident students. He sug
gested $400 a year at the Uni
versity of California's nine cam
puses and $200 at the 18-campus
California State colleges.
Nonresident students in Cali
fornia now pay $980 a year plus
a $219 incidentals fee, compared
with $500 and $120 five years
ago.
Jesse M. Unruh, Democratic
speaker of the State Assembly,
protested:
"Tuition charged solely for
the purpose of making up a
budget cut must be considered a
tax on education. Such a propos
al demands the most thorough
study we can make before it is
enacted."
The California Federation of
Teachers announced plans for a
or the capi
tal, by 10,000 educators, stu-
of Feb 11 to
"resist Gov. Reagan's attack on
public education."
Reagan denounced his critics
as "hysterical" and said they
might change their tune when
they got a look at his forthcom
ing state budget.
New York
New York, where 24 under
graduate schools had been tui
tion-free to resident students,
adopted a uniform tuition sche
dule in 1963 which requires pay
ment from almost all who at

tend state institutions of higher
learning.
Resident undergraduates pa.
$400, nonresidents $600. Studen 112 •
at graduate schools, both resi
dent and nonresident, pay $600
At medical, dental, law' and
other professional schools the
charge is $800 for residents, $1,-
000 for nonresidents.
However, New York also h'
what it calls a "scholar ince
tive program," applying only to
resident students, which is
based on family net income. An
undergraduate student from a
family with taxable income of
less than $1,800 pays nothing. Jf
income is $1,800 to $7,500 the
student pays $200 and the sta s
reimburses the college for the
other $200. If net income is
more than $7,500 the student
pays $300 and the state $100.
Private Schools
Increasing costs have hit pri
vate schools just as hard as
those supported by the statujT
and tuition charges have, risen
accordingly.
In 1961-62 the tuition at Har
vard was $1,520. It is $1,760 this
year and in September it goes
up to $2,000.
Tuition at Yale is $1,950 com
pared with $1,550 five years ag),
at Notre Dame $800 compared
with $550, at Johns Hopkins $1,-
800, going up to $2,000 in Sep

(AP) — The rising cost of
higher education has led to steep
increases in college tuition char
ges across America, a nation
wide survey shows. In extreme
cases, fees have more than
doubled within five years.
Some state schools have been
driven recently to charging tui
tion for the first time.
In California, a row which
developed when Gov. Ronald
Reagan proposed tuition fees for
resident students resulted in
the ouster of Clark Kerr as
president of the University of
California. Kerr had opposed
both tuition and Reagan's pro
posal to cut the university's
budget.
Many educators have ex
pressed fear that mounting stu
dent charges will deprive chil
dren of low income families of a
chance to attend college.
Don Stevens, a member of
the Michigan State University
Board of Trustees, 'said: "Tui
tion is wrong in public educa
tion. It discriminates against

low income families and against
girls."
Mounting Costs
"If there are a boy and a girl
in the same family, .the boy gets
the nod. The brightest kids from
low-income families don't go to
college," Stevens said.
Taking note of mounting edu
cational costs, Gov. Kenneth M.
Curtis of Maine had this com

on Jan. 5:
"Our long-range objective
must be free education beyond
high school for every Maine boy
and girl who has the desire and
talent to use this education. We
will not achieve this objective
during my administration."
A student point of view was
voiced by Dan Allison, a mem

Student Senate:
"We believe that higher edu

who wish to take advantage of
it, and raising tuition does not
move in this direction."
A pending proposal to raise

tuition fees in 22 state-sup
ported colleges in Texas by a
total of $44 million during the
next two years was denounced
by U.S. Sen. Ralph Yarborough
as "a tax on students" and "an
antieducation measure."
But almost everywhere, the
fees go up and up.

California's academic blowup
came when Reagan, newly
elected governor, proposed state
educational budget cuts of about
10 per cent, with an offsetting

tuition charge—first in history—
on resident students. He sug
gested $400 a year at the Uni
versity of California's nine cam

California State colleges.
Nonresident students in Cali
fornia now pay $980 a year plus
a $219 incidentals fee, compared

ago.
Jesse M. Unruh, Democratic
speaker of the State Assembly,
protested:
"Tuition charged solely for
the purpose of making up a
