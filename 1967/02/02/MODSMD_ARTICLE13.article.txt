# TMU DEBATE
## Panel Explores LSD Effect 
### 
Varying opinions were the
keynote of the psychedelic panel
Tuesday night in Tresidder. The
three panel members, Dr. Na
than Adler, Dr. Alan Kringle
and Dr. K. H. Blacker, discussed

various problems connected with
the use of LSD.
Dr. Adler set the tone of the
panel by commenting that
"every time you get into
trouble, you get a drug group."

After sketching a historical par
allel between the culture of the
Haight-Ashbury, the Romantics
of post-Napoleonic Europe, and
the Gnostics of Third Century
Rome, he said, "One of the
things that's worrisome about
this is that Byronism and Bona
partism are two faces of the
same coin. As soon as a char
ismatic leader comes along . . .
some of today's cool cats and
hipsters will be the storm troop
ers of tomorrow."
Dr. Kringle disagreed. Com
menting on the recent Be-In in
San Francisco, he said, "I've
never seen so many people with
so little feeling of irritation, an
noyance or anger on the part
of anyone."
Dr. Kringle traced some of
the causes of the drug usage
problem to the fact that young
LSD users do not know how to
"hold the experience and do
something with it" in their per
sonal lives. "Young people are
coming to the hospital because
of odd, unacceptable hehavior,
but joint interviews with their
parents show very little true
communication between them,"
Kringle added.
Dr. Blacker, instead of dis
cussing the "spiritual" effects of
LSD, turned the attention of the
panel to the medical problms
LSD users were encountering.
According to Blacker, patients
under observation for a three to
four month period show a his
tory that strongly resembles
that of chronic drug users.
Their common characteristics
included using a variety of
drugs to excess, "very chaotic"
sex life, "poor" work histories,
and extensive anti-social behav
ior.
The common characteristics
found in LSD users and chronic
drug users were discovered dur
ing a study conducted at the
Langley-Porter Psychiatric In
stitute. The study covered 20
patients the same age who had
been admitted for prolonged
treatment but who had not
taken LSD.
In only two of the 20 cases
was LSD considered a likely
cause for admission of the pa
tients. The study provided no
evidence that LSD is producing
a new kind of psychiatric pa
tient. In distinguishing between
those patients who had and had
not taken LSD, "we wound up
identifying an already known
group of chronic drug users."
Dr. Adler suggested that
"drug cultures are beginning to
homogenize." In part this re
flects improved law enforcement
against heroin. In part it is a
social shift: "middle class cock
tail parties are now on acid"
instead of alcohol.
