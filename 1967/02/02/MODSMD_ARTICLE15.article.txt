# Te Vegaâ€”The Floating University
## 
### 
Nine graduate students and
a faculty of four, led by Dr.
Richard Dugdale of the Univer
sity of Alaska, are now on
Stanford's 135-ft research schoo
ner, Te Vega, for tropical waters
off Mexico and Central America.
The 13 will pursue studies
and research in biological ocean
ography on the cruise which will
end in mid-March. The program
is sponsored by the National Sci
ence Foundation under the di
rection of the Hopkins Marine
Station of the university. The Te
Vega's home port is Monterey,
but she was completing her an
nual overhaul at Long Beach
before she left on the quarter
long cruise.
There will be three more
cruises for the Te Vega in 1967,
each cruise lasting about 10
weeks and corresponding to the
unversity's academic quarters.
On the cruises students take a
15-unit advanced course in bio
logical oceanography. Students
come from universities around
the nation to participate in the
program. This quarter all the
participating students come from

different institutions, including
one Stanford student, James
Childress.

The voyage will include a stop
at the Scammon Lagoon half
way down the coast of Baja

California, where the group will
try to observe the calving of
California gray whales. The ship

will procede to Acapulco and
then go to the Galapagos Is
lands, where it will pass most
of February. The cruise ends
in Acapulco about March 17.
An important objective of this
cruise of the Te Vega is the in
vestigation of the "oxygen mini
mum layer" lying 600 to 2400
feet deep in the waters the ship
will traverse. This layer of the
ocean, which has been relatively
undisturbed by ocean currents,
holds about 95 per cent less
ox>gen than the surface waters.
The layer nonetheless supports
a dense population of marine
organisms.
The vessel will make about 58
"oceanographic stations" on the
voyage; the ship will stop brief
ly at regular intervals while sci
entists take samples of the wa
ters and the marine life and
check the curents. A profes
sional captain and crew will
handle the Te Vega.
The voyage's chief scientist,
Prof. Dugdale, will be accom
panied by his wife, Jane, who is
also a qualified biologist and has
signed up as a student for the
vovage.
