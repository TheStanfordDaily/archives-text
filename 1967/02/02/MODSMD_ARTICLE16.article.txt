# U.S. Peace Corps Draws Liberal Arts Graduates; European Programs Recruit Skilled Specialists
## 
### 
The United States does it,
France does it, even tiny Liech
tenstein does it.
Like a new parlor game, the
idea of starting a Peace Corps
has caught on throughout the
world — and everyone seemes to
be getting into the act.
Twenty-one nations have estab
lished overseas voluntary service
programs. These include the two
pioneer organizations — the
United Kingdom's Voluntary Ser
vice Overseas and the United
States' Peace Corps. Another 42
countries — all considered part
of the developing world — have
caught the volunteer fever and
set up domestic service pro
grams.
The goals and scale of the pro
liferating number of volunteer
agencies differ considerably.
Liechtenstein's three volunteers
(in Algeria, Cameroon and Tan
zania), for instance, hardly com
pare with the United States'
nearly 15,000. However, the gal
lant three represent a far great
er stretching of Liechenstein's
resource of 18,000 people.
No Scattering; for French
The French, for their part,
prefer not to scatter their 6,000
volunteers (about 90 per cent of
whom are fulfilling a military
obligation) to the world's far cor
ners and instead send them only
to their former African terri
tories that have maintained close
post-independent contact with
the metropole.
Europe — directly and indi
rectly — has become the base for
international voluntary organi
zations ever since the idea was
popularized by the formation
of the Peace Corps in 1961. Thir
teen European nations and five
European "children" — the U.S.,
Canada, New Zealand, Australia
and Israel — have such pro
grams. Even Argentina, which
plans to send volunteers to other
Latin American countries, has a
European heritage.
Two Asian nations — Japan
and the Philippines — also have
established technical assistance
programs based on voluntary
service. Japan has 79 Overseas
Cooperation volunteers serving
in Kenya, India and four Asian
countries. The Philippines has
140 members of its Operation
Brotherhood providing Laos with
medical, agricultural and social
work skills.
From Swaziland and to Pacific
Just under 20,000 volunteers
from all sources were serving as
of September 30, 1966, in 95 lo
cations from Swaziland to Elice

Island in the Pacific. Africa was
the chief recipient with 10,700
volunteers.
Leading contributors were the
United States (10,368), France
(6,000), the United Kingdom (1,-
287), West Germany (819), and
Canada (569). A quarter of all
volunteers were working in six
nations — India (about 1,100),
Nigeria (894), Brazil (636), Ethi
opia (547), Tanzania (516) and
Thailand (476).
Although generally given cre
dit for encouraging development
of similar programs in other
countries, the Peace Corps' ac
tual method of operation and
overseas programming have not
been copied closely elsewhere.
Two Peace Corps officials who
recently attended a conference
at The Hague, Netherlands, or
ganized by the International Sec
retariat for Voluntary Service,
report that foreign "peace corps"
administrators are often unable
to mount programs that can
match the Peace Corps in rela
tive size, scope or initiative.
Peace Corps Paradox
"The Peace Corps is a paradox
to many people overseas," says
Raymond C. Parrott, Director of
National Voluntary Service Pro
grams for the Peace Corps.
"How, they ask, can such a big,
thus bureaucratic, organization
be so creative and responsive?
They also do not understand
how we can operate so freely of
government control."
The Peace Corps' relatively
large size is not the only factor
that separates it from counter
part organizations overseas.
Parrott says that foreign credi
bility is challenged, too, because
the Peace Corps is supported en
tirely from public funds. Most
other volunteer organizations
function with various combina
tions of private administration
and financial support and gov
ernment subsidy.
"They just do not understand
how we can operate so freely of
government," Parrott says. "In
fact, some countries are saying
that the Americans are pricing
them out of the market. Govern
ment-supported programs can
provide volunteers free, but pri
vately sponsored groups must
rely on host country subsidies."
Contrast in Recruits
Who joins the various volun
tary programs provides a mark
ed contrast between the Ameri
can and European-based organi
zations. While the U.S. draws
about 85 per cent of its volun
teers from university ranks, and

then trains them to do a specific
job, the Europeans attract main
ly persons who already possess
skills. Training periods are cor
respondingly brief.
Dr. A 1 Carp believes that the
technically oriented programs
pursued overseas by European
volunteer organizations can be
viewed as a natural outgrowth
of European — versus American
— culture.
Carp points to a strong career
orientation with highly struc
tured European societies that
leads university graduates into
permanent occupations at home
rather than into adventures over
seas.
"To have held several jobs by
age 30 is not unusual for an
American," says Carp, who
serves the Peace Corps as Direc
tor of Selection. "But in Europe,
apprenticeship and career train
ing start early and there is little
chance for change or delay along
the way."
Carp believes that the "trade
technical reputation" of such
European groups as the German
Development Service deters lo

cal university students from
joining. On the other hand, he
says, the liberal arts-generalist
orientation of the Peace Corps
may be partly to blame for the
difficulty in recruiting skilled
persons.
Both Parrott and Carp con

tend that the Peace Corps is dis
tinguished among voluntary or
ganizations by its flexibility and
initiative in developing new pro
grams to meet changing needs
in young nations. "We are con
cerned most with change," says
Carp.

volunteers (about 90 per cent of
whom are fulfilling a military
obligation) to the world's far cor
ners and instead send them only
to their former African terri
tories that have maintained close
post-independent contact with
the metropole.
Europe — directly and indi
rectly — has become the base for
international voluntary organi
zations ever since the idea was
popularized by the formation
of the Peace Corps in 1961. Thir
teen European nations and five
European "children" — the U.S.,
Canada, New Zealand, Australia
and Israel — have such pro
grams. Even Argentina, which
plans to send volunteers to other
Latin American countries, has a
European heritage.
Two Asian nations — Japan
and the Philippines — also have
established technical assistance
programs based on voluntary
service. Japan has 79 Overseas
Cooperation volunteers serving
in Kenya, India and four Asian
countries. The Philippines has
140 members of its Operation
Brotherhood providing Laos with
medical, agricultural and social
work skills.
From Swaziland and to Pacific
Just under 20,000 volunteers
from all sources were serving as
of September 30, 1966, in 95 lo
cations from Swaziland to Elice

Island in the Pacific. Africa was
the chief recipient with 10,700
volunteers.
Leading contributors were the
United States (10,368), France
(6,000), the United Kingdom (1,-
287), West Germany (819), and
Canada (569). A quarter of all
volunteers were working in six
nations — India (about 1,100),
Nigeria (894), Brazil (636), Ethi
opia (547), Tanzania (516) and
Thailand (476).
Although generally given cre
dit for encouraging development
of similar programs in other
countries, the Peace Corps' ac
tual method of operation and
overseas programming have not
been copied closely elsewhere.
Two Peace Corps officials who
recently attended a conference
at The Hague, Netherlands, or
ganized by the International Sec
retariat for Voluntary Service,
report that foreign "peace corps"
administrators are often unable
to mount programs that can
match the Peace Corps in rela
tive size, scope or initiative.
Peace Corps Paradox
"The Peace Corps is a paradox
to many people overseas," says
Raymond C. Parrott, Director of
National Voluntary Service Pro
grams for the Peace Corps.
"How, they ask, can such a big,
thus bureaucratic, organization
be so creative and responsive?
They also do not understand
how we can operate so freely of
government control."
The Peace Corps' relatively
large size is not the only factor
that separates it from counter
part organizations overseas.
Parrott says that foreign credi
bility is challenged, too, because
the Peace Corps is supported en
tirely from public funds. Most
other volunteer organizations
function with various combina
tions of private administration
and financial support and gov
ernment subsidy.
"They just do not understand
how we can operate so freely of
government," Parrott says. "In
fact, some countries are saying
that the Americans are pricing
them out of the market. Govern
ment-supported programs can
provide volunteers free, but pri
vately sponsored groups must
rely on host country subsidies."
Contrast in Recruits
Who joins the various volun
tary programs provides a mark
ed contrast between the Ameri
can and European-based organi
zations. While the U.S. draws
about 85 per cent of its volun
teers from university ranks, and

then trains them to do a specific
job, the Europeans attract main
ly persons who already possess
skills. Training periods are cor
respondingly brief.
Dr. A 1 Carp believes that the
technically oriented programs
pursued overseas by European
volunteer organizations can be
viewed as a natural outgrowth
of European — versus American
— culture.
Carp points to a strong career
orientation with highly struc
tured European societies that
leads university graduates into
permanent occupations at home
rather than into adventures over
seas.
"To have held several jobs by
age 30 is not unusual for an
American," says Carp, who
serves the Peace Corps as Direc
tor of Selection. "But in Europe,
apprenticeship and career train
ing start early and there is little
chance for change or delay along
the way."
Carp believes that the "trade
technical reputation" of such
European groups as the German
Development Service deters lo

cal university students from
joining. On the other hand, he
says, the liberal arts-generalist
orientation of the Peace Corps
may be partly to blame for the
difficulty in recruiting skilled
persons.
Both Parrott and Carp con

tend that the Peace Corps is dis
tinguished among voluntary or
ganizations by its flexibility and
initiative in developing new pro
grams to meet changing needs
in young nations. "We are con
cerned most with change," says
Carp.
The United States does it,
France does it, even tiny Liech
tenstein does it.
Like a new parlor game, the
idea of starting a Peace Corps
has caught on throughout the
world — and everyone seemes to
be getting into the act.
Twenty-one nations have estab
lished overseas voluntary service
programs. These include the two
pioneer organizations — the
United Kingdom's Voluntary Ser
vice Overseas and the United
States' Peace Corps. Another 42
countries — all considered part
of the developing world — have
caught the volunteer fever and
set up domestic service pro
grams.
The goals and scale of the pro
liferating number of volunteer
agencies differ considerably.
Liechtenstein's three volunteers
(in Algeria, Cameroon and Tan
zania), for instance, hardly com
pare with the United States'
nearly 15,000. However, the gal
lant three represent a far great
er stretching of Liechenstein's

from all sources were serving as
of September 30, 1966, in 95 lo
cations from Swaziland to Elice

Island in the Pacific. Africa was
the chief recipient with 10,700
volunteers.
Leading contributors were the
United States (10,368), France
(6,000), the United Kingdom (1,-
287), West Germany (819), and
Canada (569). A quarter of all
volunteers were working in six
nations — India (about 1,100),
Nigeria (894), Brazil (636), Ethi
opia (547), Tanzania (516) and
Thailand (476).
Although generally given cre
dit for encouraging development
of similar programs in other
countries, the Peace Corps' ac
tual method of operation and
overseas programming have not
been copied closely elsewhere.
Two Peace Corps officials who
recently attended a conference
at The Hague, Netherlands, or
ganized by the International Sec
retariat for Voluntary Service,
report that foreign "peace corps"
administrators are often unable
to mount programs that can
match the Peace Corps in rela
tive size, scope or initiative.
Peace Corps Paradox
"The Peace Corps is a paradox
to many people overseas," says
Raymond C. Parrott, Director of
National Voluntary Service Pro
grams for the Peace Corps.
"How, they ask, can such a big,
thus bureaucratic, organization
be so creative and responsive?
They also do not understand
how we can operate so freely of
government control."
The Peace Corps' relatively
large size is not the only factor
that separates it from counter
part organizations overseas.
Parrott says that foreign credi
bility is challenged, too, because
the Peace Corps is supported en
tirely from public funds. Most
other volunteer organizations
function with various combina
tions of private administration
and financial support and gov
ernment subsidy.
"They just do not understand
how we can operate so freely of
government," Parrott says. "In
fact, some countries are saying
that the Americans are pricing
them out of the market. Govern
ment-supported programs can
provide volunteers free, but pri
vately sponsored groups must
rely on host country subsidies."
Contrast in Recruits
Who joins the various volun
tary programs provides a mark
ed contrast between the Ameri
can and European-based organi
zations. While the U.S. draws
about 85 per cent of its volun
teers from university ranks, and

then trains them to do a specific
job, the Europeans attract main
ly persons who already possess
skills. Training periods are cor
respondingly brief.
Dr. A 1 Carp believes that the
technically oriented programs
pursued overseas by European
volunteer organizations can be
viewed as a natural outgrowth
of European — versus American
— culture.
Carp points to a strong career
orientation with highly struc
tured European societies that
leads university graduates into
permanent occupations at home
rather than into adventures over
seas.
"To have held several jobs by
age 30 is not unusual for an
American," says Carp, who
serves the Peace Corps as Direc
tor of Selection. "But in Europe,
apprenticeship and career train
ing start early and there is little
chance for change or delay along
the way."
Carp believes that the "trade
technical reputation" of such
European groups as the German
Development Service deters lo

cal university students from
joining. On the other hand, he
says, the liberal arts-generalist
orientation of the Peace Corps
may be partly to blame for the
difficulty in recruiting skilled
persons.
Both Parrott and Carp con

tend that the Peace Corps is dis
tinguished among voluntary or
ganizations by its flexibility and
initiative in developing new pro
grams to meet changing needs
in young nations. "We are con
cerned most with change," says
Carp.
The United States does it,
France does it, even tiny Liech
tenstein does it.
Like a new parlor game, the
idea of starting a Peace Corps
has caught on throughout the
world — and everyone seemes to
be getting into the act.
Twenty-one nations have estab
lished overseas voluntary service
programs. These include the two
pioneer organizations — the
United Kingdom's Voluntary Ser
vice Overseas and the United
States' Peace Corps. Another 42
countries — all considered part
of the developing world — have
caught the volunteer fever and
set up domestic service pro
grams.
The goals and scale of the pro
liferating number of volunteer
agencies differ considerably.
Liechtenstein's three volunteers
(in Algeria, Cameroon and Tan
zania), for instance, hardly com
pare with the United States'
nearly 15,000. However, the gal
lant three represent a far great
er stretching of Liechenstein's
resource of 18,000 people.
No Scattering; for French
The French, for their part,
prefer not to scatter their 6,000
volunteers (about 90 per cent of
whom are fulfilling a military
obligation) to the world's far cor
ners and instead send them only
to their former African terri
tories that have maintained close
post-independent contact with
the metropole.
Europe — directly and indi
rectly — has become the base for
international voluntary organi
zations ever since the idea was
popularized by the formation
of the Peace Corps in 1961. Thir
teen European nations and five
European "children" — the U.S.,
Canada, New Zealand, Australia
and Israel — have such pro
grams. Even Argentina, which
plans to send volunteers to other
Latin American countries, has a
European heritage.
Two Asian nations — Japan
and the Philippines — also have
established technical assistance
programs based on voluntary
service. Japan has 79 Overseas
Cooperation volunteers serving
in Kenya, India and four Asian
countries. The Philippines has
140 members of its Operation
Brotherhood providing Laos with
medical, agricultural and social
work skills.

match the Peace Corps in rela
tive size, scope or initiative.
Peace Corps Paradox
"The Peace Corps is a paradox
to many people overseas," says
Raymond C. Parrott, Director of
National Voluntary Service Pro
grams for the Peace Corps.
"How, they ask, can such a big,
thus bureaucratic, organization
be so creative and responsive?
They also do not understand
how we can operate so freely of
government control."
The Peace Corps' relatively
large size is not the only factor
that separates it from counter
part organizations overseas.
Parrott says that foreign credi
bility is challenged, too, because
the Peace Corps is supported en
tirely from public funds. Most
other volunteer organizations
function with various combina
tions of private administration
and financial support and gov
ernment subsidy.
"They just do not understand
how we can operate so freely of
government," Parrott says. "In
fact, some countries are saying
that the Americans are pricing
them out of the market. Govern
ment-supported programs can
provide volunteers free, but pri
vately sponsored groups must
rely on host country subsidies."
Contrast in Recruits
Who joins the various volun
tary programs provides a mark
ed contrast between the Ameri
can and European-based organi
zations. While the U.S. draws
about 85 per cent of its volun
teers from university ranks, and

then trains them to do a specific
job, the Europeans attract main
ly persons who already possess
skills. Training periods are cor
respondingly brief.
Dr. A 1 Carp believes that the
technically oriented programs
pursued overseas by European
volunteer organizations can be
viewed as a natural outgrowth
of European — versus American
— culture.
Carp points to a strong career
orientation with highly struc
tured European societies that
leads university graduates into
permanent occupations at home
rather than into adventures over
seas.
"To have held several jobs by
age 30 is not unusual for an
American," says Carp, who
serves the Peace Corps as Direc
tor of Selection. "But in Europe,
apprenticeship and career train
ing start early and there is little
chance for change or delay along
the way."
Carp believes that the "trade
technical reputation" of such
European groups as the German
Development Service deters lo

cal university students from
joining. On the other hand, he
says, the liberal arts-generalist
orientation of the Peace Corps
may be partly to blame for the
difficulty in recruiting skilled
persons.
Both Parrott and Carp con

tend that the Peace Corps is dis
tinguished among voluntary or
ganizations by its flexibility and
initiative in developing new pro
grams to meet changing needs
in young nations. "We are con
cerned most with change," says
Carp.
