# IS BUSINESS STRUCTURED FOR RECOGNITION OF INDIVIDUAL MERIT?
## (or How to Succeed Quickly in Business by Shuffling Letters.) 
### 
Dear Mr. Kokalas:
The fundamental concern expressed in the headline
above has been voiced in one way or another by all
six students taking part in our current exchange of
views on business. Because it is an issue of such
common concern, I am going to respond in the same
manner to each of you.
We would agree, I believe, that there are instances
in which seniority, prejudice in some form, nepotism,
or personal chemistry have been influential to an
unjustifiable degree in advancing or hindering
careers in business, in government, in education. This
shows human frailty; it is neither unique nor
dominant in business. We must combat this for
the general improvement of society and we will be
assisted in our task by the fact that inadequacy in
any position of leadership tends to catch up with
its owner.
Meanwhile, the great burden of evidence supports
a conviction that business is structured for the
recognition of individual merit.
There are thousands of executives in American
business today who made their mark before they
were 50. Many before 40. I want to tell you about one
of these men, not because I seek to generalize on
one specific but because the individual merit which
has been demonstrated in his career broadly
characterizes American business leadership.
1 his man's career might be entitled "How To Succeed
Quickly in Business by Shuffling Letters." It is not a
tale of a young genius who invented a new product
and zoomed to the high tax brackets overnight.
There are true stories like that, but they don't speak
directly to your questions.
No, this story starts with an 18-year-old student of
humble circumstances at the University of Chicago
who had an ordinary summer job at a camera
company. His job wasn't too different from the sort
of summer job which many college students would
describe as dull and boring, fragmented and incon
clusive. He worked in the company's service
department. He answered complaint letters.

It was a small department (there weren't too many
complaints) and the college student spent about two
weeks doing exactly what he was paid to do: read
letters, find the problem, write answers which gave
the solution. This is the way the job had always been
done, no matter who sat at that particular desk.
Gradually, however, this particular answer-writer
(his name was Charles H. Percy—the company was
Bell & Howell) began to see patterns emerging in the
customers' letters. With few exceptions, he realized,
each letter fell into one of perhaps nine categories.
Percy took a bundle of letters home that weekend,
sorted them out on the floor, and began to compose
a group of specific, carefully thought-out letters of
reply. He checked and rechecked each letter against
each proposed answer letter and against all the other
answer letters. He found that, sure enough, he now
had created a series of answers which gave full
and courteous reply to almost every customer letter
in the bundle.
On Monday morning, Percy checked the morning
mail against his new letters and, when they, too,
checked out, he took the whole bundle into the
service department manager's office.
The service manager heard Percy out, checked the
letters in the bundle, and agreed: a secretary could
sort incoming complaints by category, type the
answers, and forward a copy for further action where
needed. The manager also agreed that Percy had
knowingly eliminated his own job.
This intrigued Percy's boss (jobs were scarcer than
they are today) and he told Bell & Howell President
Joseph H. McNabb about "this enterprising kid
down there who has worked himself out of a job."
Mr. McNabb said, "That's a young man we should
keep an eye on."
Chuck Percy went to work full-time for Bell & Howell
after he graduated in 1941. He was elected president
and chief executive officer at 29. The company's sales
increased twelvefold under his leadership. Today,
at 47, he is a newly elected United States senator.
Counting his summer jobs, he had worked for Bell
& Howell for 28 years.

I do not contend that every college student can
duplicate the Percy story in whatever career he
chooses. I do submit, however, that your own
version of this story will start when you start to
apply your individual creativity to your first job the
way he did to his.
Answering complaint letters can be a routine job for
a routine sort of fellow. Come at the job with
creativity, however, and you can lift it from the
humdrum. You can even eliminate the job—and there
aren't many more forceful ways to show that you are
ready for a bigger job than to eliminate your
present one.
Note also that here was a man who achieved job
fulfillment, recognition, security, advancement,
individuality, a chance for creativity-all the things
today's college students want from their working
lives—and he achieved them all within the business
structure.
Society itself has a structure. All elements within
society have structures. These structures generally
work for the good of the individual, not for his harm
—and the degree to which this is so depends in the
final measure largely upon the individual.
Chuck Percy did not wait for chance recognition
he earned his early recognition by his own creative
vision, imagination, and action.
The fastest route to a job of major responsibility is to
improve the handling of a job of lesser responsibility.

This two-way conversation
is open to you
Have you questions or opinions about business as
a possible career or as a force in society? Have you
reactions (pro or con) to this series of open letters
between Ed Kokalas, a student at Michigan State,
and Robert W. Galvin, chairman of Motorola Inc.?
Letters like this one have appeared regularly in
29 student newspapers throughout the country since
October. You are invited to make your feelings
known, too. Write Mr. Galvin at 9401 West Grand
Avenue, Franklin Park, Illinois 60131.
