(Editor's noteâ€”the follow

University in America, an
"occasional paper" recently
published by The Center for
the Study of Democratic In

The Daily, feeling the paper
to be of unusual significance,
will print occasional install
ments of the occasional paper.)
First in a Series
The university in America is

in trouble. The troubles are not
new. What is new is the degree
of urgency that is forcing the
professional community and the
public in general to reappraise
what our universities are and
should be. Once, the sole re
sponsibility of the university
was thought to be the perpetua
tion and the advancement of
knowledge and, wherever pos
sible, wisdom.
The earliest colleges and uni

versities in America were struc
tured largely on the European
model and sought to perform
no other function than to edu
cate its scholars to seek the
truth. The backbone of formal
education was the liberal arts.
But in the late nineteenth cen
tury the explosion of the sci
ences and the expansion of our
Western frontier led to the in
troduction of two new strains
that were to change significant
ly the character and curriculum
of the university.
Land Grant
Through the Morrill Act of
1862, and a succession of other
acts, land-grant colleges were
established to teach skills that
would contribute directly to the
agricultural and industrial ex
pansion of the country. Sup
ported by federal and state
funds, land-grant institutions
flourished, and by the 1920's pri

vate colleges and universities
also were assuming responsi
bility for meeting the needs of
the community in the training
of specialists the society be
lieved it required.
The second innovation was
the introduction of the elective
system, which was intended to
cope with the tremendous
growth of new scientific knowl
edge and to assimilate it into
the liberal arts program. Within
a short time, however, the cur
ricula presented a shopping-cen
ter multiplication of subject
matters and "majors" in individ
ual disciplines that isolated each
from the other.
Added to this was the intro
duction of the research teacher.
The principle behind encourag
ing research was to advance the
teacher in his learning. In prac
tice, however, the emphasis was
put on publishing and on ser
vice, so that the teacher was

caught between the publish-or
perish syndrome and his new
role as a specialist-salesman
competing for students and for
"contracts."
To help further the reapprais

al of the university in America
that more and more people see
as indispensable, the Center for
the Study of DemocraticThstitu
tions held a Convocation in Los
Angeles in 1966.
