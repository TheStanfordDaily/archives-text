# The
						Issues

### Robert M. Hutchins President of the Center 
A British scholar remarked
recently that education was
something like the Kingdom of
God in former times. It is within
us and amongst us, yet it some
how lies ahead.
The elect possess it and hope
to gather in those who are not
yet saved. But what on earth
it is has seldom been made
clear.
Much the same may be said
of the university in its global
manifestation. It is generally
agreed to be a Fine Thing,
though a certain mysticism at
taches to the reason why.
There is something pathetic,
moving, and characteristic
about the following official
statement of a foreign govern
ment: "The aims of higher edu
cation are inextricably bound up
with national aims and develop
ment. ... If Liberia is to hold a
position of leadership in the
modem world it must have
highly trained personnel at all
levels."
Population Explosion
The institution called the uni
versity is almost everywhere
afflicted with difficulties associ
ated with the birth-rate and the
desire of an increasing popula
tion to acquire whatever it is

that attendance at and recogni
tion by a university confers.
Of the Western countries only
Portugal reports that "the num
ber of university students grad
uating each year has not risen
at a sufficient rate to meet the
needs of the country."
Even Portugal is not free
from other difficulties felt al
most everywhere, those arising
from the restlessness of stu
dents.
Without attempting to pass on
the specific complaint alleged
in any of these instances, and
with due recognition of the prac
tice in some countries of incit
ing students to riot for political
purposes, we may yet acknowl
edge the possibility, in view of
what we know about universi
ties and about national policies,
that in some cases the students
may have been right.
No Resemblance
When we pass beyond these
phenomena, exponential growth
and student disorders, any re
semblance between the Ameri
can university and the univers
ity anywhere is purely coinci
dental.
There is practically no coun
try in the world outside the
Communist orbit that does not
report that its universities are
autonomous. Whether or not
they are in fact autonomous is
not now in issue. The point Is
that every country finds it nec
essary to claim they are.
The United States has only
the most limited conception of
autonomy. The meaning of au
tonomy elsewhere is that the
faculties are in actual control,
no matter what the extent of
the nominal powers of ministers
of education, legislatures, or
boards of trustees may be.
Cannibal
In no country in the world is
the university the cannibal it is
in the United States. Every
other nation assigns some tasks
of education, training, and re
search to other institutions.
Nowhere else is it auto
matically assumed that
everything anybody wants by
way of educational experience
beyond the high school or any
thing anybody would like to see
done by way of solving practical
problems, collecting data, in
vestigating the universe, or
cleaning up the landscape may
as a matter of course be a func
tion of the university.
The responsibility of the pro
fessions for the preparation and
induction of neophytes, the op
eration of training schools and
research institutes outside the
university, and a break of the
greatest significance between
secondary and higher education
are the general rule in other
countries and unknown or ex
ceptional in the United States.
The last point deserves, per
haps, a word more. In the
United States we do not believe
that secondary education
amounts to much, and we do not
really care.
Those who are graduated
from high school may not have
learned anything, but many of
them will go on to college,
where they will be accommo
dated by what have been called
the six R's, remedial reading,
remedial 'riting, and remedial
'rithmetic.
Next: the University as super
market, pump, and resort.
