# Value Of Psychedelic Expansion Questioned In TMU Discussion
## 
### GEOFF STEVENS 
Interspersing their statements with
humorous jibes, Dr. Richard Alpert
and Dr. Sidney Cohen debated last
night the psychedelic question: To
take or not to take?
Alpert sounded much like Dr. Tim
othy Leary in claiming that LSD
usage could lead to a religious experi
ence. With the aid of LSD, Alpert said
that he saw the unity and the plan
of the universe.
Dr. Cohen agreed that LSD produc
ed vivid hallucinations, but asked
whether the "transcendental LSD ex
perience is really real, or is it a neuro
chemical trick?"
Continuing his argument, Cohen
tried to explore the "myths" of drug
usage by calling insanity inglorious,
emphasizing the possibility of serious
LSD-produced mental disorder and
generally devaluating the insights
gained during a drug experience.
Both men expressed optimism about
the future of mankind. Alpert said
that LSD had changed his outlook
from one of Western cynicism to one
of Eastern consciousness.
With an understanding of the po
tential of man's consciousness, he felt
mankind would discard the world-view
which accepts war.

Cohen concurred that mankind
would probably build a better world.
He saw mankind's hope not in ex
panded consciousness, but in the con
tinuing evolution of man's rationality.
Thoughout the discussion, the
speakers referred to each other as
"Richard" and "Sidney." Frequently
they would speak indulengtly of each
other as if the other were sincere but
extremely misguided in his notions.
Cohen began his talk defensively by
saying that he was not a spokesman
for the establishment as "Richard
would have you believe." On the other
hand, Alpert denied that he was "un
scientific" and convincingly showed
himself to be a relaxed, sane man.
Alpert and Cohen are co-authors of
a book entitled LSD. They have de
bated together often as was evident
from their ability to anticipate each
other's arguments.
It appeared that the basis of their
disagreement over the value of LSD
stemmed from their different views of
insanity. Alpert said that he has seen
"Fifteen-year old girls on Sunset Strip
flipped-out, and I'm still not frighten
ed." Cohen said he had talked with
many former psychotics, and almost
all of them described their mental dis
order as being "terrifying."
