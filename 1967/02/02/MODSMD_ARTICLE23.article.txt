## 
### BONNIE SELWAY 
The Stanford Sailing Associa
tion will enter two teams this
Saturday, February 4, in a race
sponsored by the Northern Cali
fornia Intercollegiate Yacht Rac
ing Association and hosted by
Cal.
The competition will begin at
10:30 at the University of Cali
fornia Yacht Club in Berkeley.
Nine colleges, including Stan
ford, Cal, San Francisco State,
San Jose State, Sonoma State
and Davis will vie for top honors
in this year's first NCIYRA race.
The bay-area league was form
ed a year ago to admit two-year
colleges, such as Laney Junior
College in Berkeley, which were
excluded from the larger Pacific
Coast Intercollegiate Yacht Rac
ing League.
Christmas Regattas
Over Christmas vacation Stan
ford sailors were coaxing their
boats to place well in several
regattas.
The Intercollegiate Christmas
Regatta was held at Newport
Beach, December 17. The Orange
Coast College-sponsored event
was won by USC. Stanford, rep
resented by skippers Craig Mc-
Cabe and Raymond Wilde, took
fourth out of fifteen.
Sailing in the Newport Harbor
Yacht Club's Christmas Regatta
under light winds, Stanford's two
brand-new "Shield 30's" placed
second and fourth out of six,
with skippers Kim Desenberg
and Dick Enersen.
In the Sweet Trophy races, De
cember 19 and 20, Stanford skip
per Skip Allan and crews Dick

Enersen and Carl Boiler placed
second in the first-day elimina
tions and fourth in the finals.
Eight schools from all over
the country participated in the
Sugar Bowl Regatta at New Or
leans, December 29 and 30. Stan
ford's two teams, skippers Kim
Desenberg and Skip Allen, and
crews Dirck Brinckerhoff and
Raymond Wilde, finished second
in their "Flying Juniors," two
points behind defending cham
pions use.
Desenberg was high-point skip
per in the "A" division; Allan
was runner-up in the "B" divi
sion despite a disqualification on
the first day.
The racing team faces a busy
season, highlighted by the "John
F. Kennedy Memorial Trophy"
race in April. An eight-man crew

will set sail for Annapolis to sail
in five eight-and-a-half mile
races on an Olympic-type course.
Pleasure Too

enjoy open sailing in the club's
twelve-foot "Flying Juniors"
every Friday from 2:00 to 5:00
and Saturday Sunday from 10:00
to 5:00 on Lake Lag.
The new "Shield 30's" donated
by Shield Co., and brought up

mas Regatta are used for plea
sure sailing and instructions
every Saturday at San Francisco
Yacht Club in Tuberon. These
boats will be entered in handicap
