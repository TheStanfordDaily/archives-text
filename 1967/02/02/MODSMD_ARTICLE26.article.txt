## Don't Be A Mail 'Junkie!' 
### Robert E. Stone 
Mail from home is an impor
tant part of the lives of the 50
per cent of Stanford students
who live outside California. The
anticipation of news from
friends and parents, maybe of
a little gift, is enough to cause
students to go running to their
post office box three or four
times a day.
Imagine the grief these stu
dents must feel when they open
their mailboxes and discover, in
stead of words of love, adver
tisements. Junk mail is becom

ing a problem all over the coun
try. Here at. Stanford it is be
coming a chronic problem.
Every student has at one time
or another received ads from
Time, Newsweek, Capitol Rec
ord Club. Females have been
known to get ads for various fe
male-oriented magazines, cos
metic companies, and computer
date services. The various ROTC
programs send out regular no
tices, at government expense, of
"the better way to fulfill your
obligation." The ROTC people

are so indiscriminate, that many
girls get copies of their appeals.
Sticky
Accox-ding to Dr. Harvey Hall,
University Registrar, the Regi
strar's Office does not give out
lists of students to companies,
or for that matter to anyone
else. "As for our basic guide
lines," Hall said, "we're sticky
about giving out information
about students."
The Student Directory, the of
ficial listing of students, is, how
ever, a publication of the Regi
strar's Office. According to Hall,
"We give out information in the
public realm. For example, if
someone were to call us and ask
if John Jones had passed Eco
nomics I, we wouldn't tell him.
If someone called and asked if
John Jones had received an A.B.
in 1964 we would."
Since the Registrar's Office
considers the information in the
Student Directory to be in the
public realm, another solution
must be found to eliminating
the problem of junk mail. There
are two courses available.
How To Escape
The first is not to list your ad
dress in the Student Directory.
This method is not very satis
factory because it also eliminates
the possibility of receiving any
official University mail.

The best method of elimina.
ing junk mail depends on your
ability to recognize the stuff.
According to the Post Office, un
solicited mail, if unopened, may
be returned. What this means
is, that when you spot junk mail,
all you have to do Is write "Un
solicited — Please return to
sender" on the envelope and
leave it for the mailman.
This method works because
the Post Office is not in thr
habit of sending free mail. In
stead they charge the sender fo»-
the return postage, and the send
er just doesn't like that and he
stops sending you mail.
Limit Sales
For those who find this pro
cess too laborious, there is one
further suggestion. Student D :
rectories are sold through the
Bookstore to anyone who can
cough up the necessary 50 cents.
Perhaps it might be possible to
limit sales of the Directory to
people with University I.D.s.
If junk mail is a problem for
you, I suggest that you try on
of the methods listed above. May
be a little pressure in the right
places could get the Bookstore
to change its policies. Maybe the
eager students who count so
much on their mail for home
will no longer be disappointed.

Accox-ding to Dr. Harvey Hall,
University Registrar, the Regi
strar's Office does not give out
lists of students to companies,
or for that matter to anyone
else. "As for our basic guide
lines," Hall said, "we're sticky
about giving out information
about students."
The Student Directory, the of
ficial listing of students, is, how
ever, a publication of the Regi
strar's Office. According to Hall,
"We give out information in the
public realm. For example, if
someone were to call us and ask
if John Jones had passed Eco
nomics I, we wouldn't tell him.
If someone called and asked if
John Jones had received an A.B.
in 1964 we would."
Since the Registrar's Office
considers the information in the
Student Directory to be in the
public realm, another solution
must be found to eliminating
the problem of junk mail. There
are two courses available.
How To Escape
The first is not to list your ad
dress in the Student Directory.
This method is not very satis
factory because it also eliminates
the possibility of receiving any
official University mail.

The best method of elimina.
ing junk mail depends on your
ability to recognize the stuff.
According to the Post Office, un
solicited mail, if unopened, may
be returned. What this means
is, that when you spot junk mail,
all you have to do Is write "Un
solicited — Please return to
sender" on the envelope and
leave it for the mailman.
This method works because
the Post Office is not in thr
habit of sending free mail. In
stead they charge the sender fo»-
the return postage, and the send
er just doesn't like that and he
stops sending you mail.
Limit Sales
For those who find this pro
cess too laborious, there is one
further suggestion. Student D :
rectories are sold through the
Bookstore to anyone who can
cough up the necessary 50 cents.
Perhaps it might be possible to
limit sales of the Directory to
people with University I.D.s.
If junk mail is a problem for
you, I suggest that you try on
of the methods listed above. May
be a little pressure in the right
places could get the Bookstore
to change its policies. Maybe the
eager students who count so
much on their mail for home
will no longer be disappointed.
Mail from home is an impor
tant part of the lives of the 50
per cent of Stanford students
who live outside California. The
anticipation of news from
friends and parents, maybe of
a little gift, is enough to cause
students to go running to their
post office box three or four
times a day.
Imagine the grief these stu
dents must feel when they open
their mailboxes and discover, in
stead of words of love, adver
tisements. Junk mail is becom

ing a problem all over the coun
try. Here at. Stanford it is be
coming a chronic problem.
