## Stanford Should Defend Radicalism 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
So it begins again. Mr. Hoover
has warned us of the threats to
our intellectual Virginity. In the
current political climate, appar
ently no legitimate political ac
tivity is to be permitted on the
left. Must every left wing group
endure these allegations?
Since the late forties, radical
political activity has been es
sentially nonexistent in the
United States, and many incipi
ent radical groups have lost pub
lic support when charged of
Communist support or sym
pathy. The academic community
behaved less than nobly under
the pressures of the McCarthy
period. The Stanford Administra
tion and their counterparts
throughout the country could
now perform a major role in
protecting political and academic
civil liberities. The Administra
tion should now speak to the
Federal Government and the
American public about the differ
ences between Communist and
current radical political activity.
The relevance and legitimacy of
radical political activity should
be defended against the inevit
able right-wing inspired, at
tempts to again crush the left.

• Cliches?
Editor, The Daily:
I wish to express my sincere
appreciation to Prof. Jeffery
Smith for his enlightening
article, "Seven Points to Pon
der". Prof. Smith left no chest
nut unturned in his story, which
read like the Readers' Digest—
"What Every Young Hippy
Should Know".
The advice ranged from the
deep esoteric ("Have someone
with you ... who will put on and
take off records . . . (and) will
answer the door") to the politi
cally profound ("I recommend
that LBJ . . . take a large dose
of LSD"). The points, individu
ally, make fascinating reading

and reflect an entirely contem
porary body of knowledge.
Fresh discoveries concerning
"addictive killer drugs such as
alchohol and nicotine ("what,
not caceine?") were particularly
effective. Also, I was forced to
reflect on the shallowness ("Our
nation . . . spends more on cos
metics than on education") and
depravity of what I shall term
"the masses" ("ignorance, hypo
crisy, and fear" dominate them).
The statement "psychedelics
may be the key to . . . inner
powers to cope with the powers
that threaten total destruction"
sounded strikingly like the plot
line from the TV show "Mr. Ter
riffic".
The points, in total, struck
me as being the same advice
one would give someone who
wished to undress in public (i.e.
"The dangers are real", "if more
than reasonably neurotic, it may
do more harm than good", "the
more exalting and humbling its
effect", "bring out what is latent
in you", "don't take it lightly",
and"the memory . . . will be en
during).
Lest I be thought to have no
point, I wish to say that Prof.
Smith's article struck me as
having an inordinate number of
cliches and no signs of the per
vading feeling of love or height
ened sensitivity which LSD
should provide. What little tone
I detected in the piece ran like
a verse from "I'M IN WITH
THE "IN" CROWD". As a char
acter named "Gentleman" says
of Ophelia, "she speaks things
in doubt that carry but half
sense. Her speech is nothing yet
the unshaped use of it doth
move the hearers".

• Battle of Sexes
Editor, The Daily:
Compulsive shouters of such
proven campus boondoggles as

"change" and "progress" have
come up with a really and truly
lulu this time: "Co-educational
Living."
I have taken salt at Grove
House. The residents I met and
talked with are happy with their
arrangement as well as articu
late about it, and I, unlike David
Harris and his Barnyard Admin
istration, am the last person to
police where and how other
people chose to live. But if
Grove House is intended as
some kind of dismal sneak pre
view of residential abomina
tions soon to become standard,
it becomes an intense personal
interest.
For my money, co educational
housing, under any but the most
frankly immoral circumstances
is, simply a cheat and a fraud,
designed specifically to turn out
an entire generation of Stanford
men conned out of their bachel
orhoods and housebroken into
sofa-dwelling Ozzie Nelsons
easily a decade before their
time. First we'll have to watch
our language at table, and then
we'll have to shave before
breakfast. Before you can say
"henpecked" we'll be leaving off
our shoes at the door and
scampering about in our socks
so as not to track street dust
on the carpet.
The final infamy will come
when the women usurp our be
loved old billiard rooms and
lounge around therein, sporting
Panatella stogies and swilling
down great gulps of bourbon
hijacked from our personal re
serves. The transference will be
complete and we tepid, con
temptuous, well-adjusted, sex
less, watery pease porridge of
of uniformity that will assure
Stanford University's final and
irrevocable flushing down the
toilet drain of history. If Harris
and Assoc. don't find some other
way to yank the handle on us
in the meantime.

• Pass-Fail
Editor, The Daily:
A possible compromise in the
debate over freshman grading
and a pass-fail freshman year
may be the following: assign
grades in all freshman courses
in the usual manner. However,
these grades would only be given
to each freshman for his own
information in order to compare
himself with the standards of the
school and his classmates. In
his transcript there would be no
record of these grades, but only
the notations pass or fail for the
freshman courses.
Insofar as the university is
concerned, the freshman year
would be pass-fail.
Such a system might relieve
some of the pressures on a
freshman, as no recorded com
parisons would be made until his
sophomore year. He would then
have a chance to adjust his be
havior or attitudes without the
potential psychological problems

of knowing that a fourth of his
record is already permanently
on the books.
But if the problem of grades
are related primarily to internal
pressures generated by expecta
tions or desires to make ail A's
at Stanford, the proposed sys
tem would seem to be of little
help. I doubt there are any
modifications in the current
grading system which could help
the student adjust to his new
relative position in the race for
grades.
Whether college grades should
be weighted so heavily in evalu
ations of students by business,
government, graduate schools,
and various peer groups is an
other matter. Selection of indi
viduals for various positions will
always require rating methods.
Changes in the rating methods,
e.g., deemphasis of grade point
average myopia, require adjust
ment by all the above groups.
