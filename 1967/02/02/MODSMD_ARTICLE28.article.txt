# Today And Tomorrow
## Chinese Threat And Domino Action 
### Walter Lippmann 
Behind the fog of war lies the
great unanswered question of
our role in Asia. None of us to
day can answer this question
finally and conclusively, for
there is no all-wise and omni
competent Asia expert who can
speak with authority on a situ
ation which has existed for only
about 15 or 20 years.
Our present position in the
Pacific and our relations with
Asia are the unplanned and acci
dental consequences of the Japa
nese victories over the European
empires in Asia and of our total
victory over Japan.
The result of this immense his
torical upheaval has been to
bring our military frontier not
only all the way across the Pa
cific, but also on to the penin
sulas and offshore islands of the
Asia mainland â€” to South Ko
rea, Okinawa, Taiwan and South
Vietnam. The great unresolved
questions turn on where an en
during frontier can and should
be stabilized.
Chinese Revolution
Beyond the military frontier
lies China which is passing
through a revolution comparable
to, though bigger and perhaps
more portentous than, the
French Revolution of 1789 and
the Russian Revolution of 1917.
Nobody living today knows
much about the Chinese Revo
lution, but from the other two
revolutions of modern times one
lesson stands out. A big revolu
tion in a big country, which is
a very different thing from a
local revolution in a small coun
try, cannot be controlled by for
eign intervention.
Experience teaches us that

the best policy is one of watch
ful waiting while internal revolu
tionary fires burn themselves
out. Eventually they do. A new
pnnpvation arrives after a gen
eration of revolutionary upheav
al. It has forgotten the original
grievances and is bored with
the old ideologies and seeks for
itself a quieter life.
Looking On
During this period of watchful
waiting the smaller nations on
the frontiers of a gigantic revo
lution are bound to be nervous
and apprehensive. They do not
know what will happen, but they
do know in their bones that in
the long run they will have to
find a way of coming to terms
with the masters.
On the frontiers of China to
day some countries have govern
ments which have compromised
their future relations with al
most any Chinese government.
South Korea, Gen. Nguyen Cao
Ky's Saigonese government, and
the present rulers of Thailand
have no alternative to becoming
the satellites of the United
States.
Among our great mistakes in
Southeast Asia has been the
reckless use of words. It is our
own propaganda which has
taught the world, and particu
larly the small allies, that the
outcome in Vietnam was the
"test" of American courage,
good faith, idealism and power.
What was the sense of saying
that?
Reckless
We are like a man who makes
a reckless promise, say that he
will climb the face of the Wash
ington Monument, and then in

an excess of exhuberance and
pride adds "and if I do not climb
it you may consider that I am a
coward and a horse thief."
In truth, the power of the
United States is not being tested
in Vietnam. It has been tested
against far more powerful ene
mies than the Viet Cong and
their northern allies. There is
no doubt about the power of
the United States.
What is being tested is wheth
er the generation now in com
mand in Washington has the in
telligence to use American
power wisely and effectively or
whether it thinks it can kill mo
squitoes with tanks and build
a Great Society with B-525.
Bogged Down
The more extensively the
United States becomes bogged
down in Vietnam, the less able
or willing it will be to under
take a second and a third Viet
nam somewhere else. It is an
empty boast and a false prom
ise to tell the world that the
United States will fight aggres
sion everywhere.
The weak countries will have
to save themselves from revolu
tion. They will have to keep
themselves going with such mar
ginal economic and technical as
sistance as we in the advanced
countries are willing to give
them.
Beyond that, if they feel them
selves threatened by Chinese
missiles and nuclear weapons it
might be useful to see whether
an agreement can be negotiated
by the nuclear powers promis
ing to unite against the country
which makes the first nuclear
strike.

Only lately, we must remem
ber, the Chinese have said again
that they will never strike first.
It would be most useful if this
could be spelled out in a collec
tive agreement.
The peripheral states of a
superpower like China will have
to move within the Chinese orbit
as surely as the Caribbean states
move within the orbit of the
United States.
