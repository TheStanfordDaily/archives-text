## War Doesn't Kill It Just Deadens 
### Doug Ohmans 
At last we're at war!
I'm not saying it's good. I
deeply detest man's inhumanity
to man. I believe in a world
where love guides human re
lationships. I hate ... no, I
don't hate. I am a liberal. It's
that easy. It's that simple.
I used to ques.tron whether
my country's policy in Vietnam
was immoral. Now it's clear
that it is. I used to wonder

whether there was anything I
could do. Now it's obvious that
there isn't. You could say I've
resigned myself to it. Why, I
don't even read the papers any
more.
I'd go to jail, but I think that
one can do more good working
within society. I'd be a CO, but
I don't want to stay within the
system. I'd march, but it's been
shown that that alienates the
middle class from the protest
movement. I'd write my con
gressman, but he'd probably
just throw away my letter.
I'm not kidding, it's a simple
case of a problem out of my
hands. I suppose that the best
thing I could do would be to go
to graduate school. There will
be crises in the future, and then
I'll have the power to do some
thing about them.
Wait! What is happening to
me? I am missing the point. It
almost seems as if the war has
moved from within me, where
it used to take place, to over
there. Where is it, "over there"?
Maybe war for me is not con
flict but a kind of calm, a kind
of dead calm. The immorality
of war is not so much that it
kills, but that it deadens. Are
protests over at Stanford?
