# Counselors Give Discussion Aid
## 
### CHRISTOPHER HARGROVE 
Students who have trouble partici
pating in discussion groups are getting
a helping hand from the Stanford
Counseling and Testing Center.
A special project is now under way,
under the direction of Alvin I. Haim
son, to determine what accounts for
reticence in the classroom and to help
each individual student who wants to
participate more.
The program got its intial impetus
from the Western Civilization Depart
ment four years ago. Haimson will
meet today with Western Civ. instruc
tors to enlist their support in con
tinuing the program. Any freshmen
who are interested will be encouraged
to join one of the small discussion
groups at the Counseling Center
where their problems will be hashed
out.
This is the third year these groups,
usually five to seven people, have met.
They are led by graduate psychology
students; this year's leaders are be
ing trained right now.
The program began with a request
from the Western Civ. Department
that their discussion groups be studied
with a view to encouraging more stu
dents to talk. Four years ago class dis
cussion was formally a part of a stu
dent's grade in the course.
The Testing Service administered
questionnaires to all the freshmen in
1562 to get a general idea of the scope
of the problem and an idea of how the
students regarded it. The instructors
themselves were also asked for their
impressions.
The results of both inquiries indi
cated that about one third of an aver
age Civ. discussion group either "sel
dom participates" or "participates
very rarely." Hamison said he believes
this figure remains fairly constant
from year to year.
Furthermore, the questionnaire re
vealed that a student's class partici
pation bore no relation to his high
school grades. Certain personality
traits appeared to be common among
non-participators, but Hamison em
phasizes that this fact by no means
proves the existence of a "personality
type."
Participators tend, in general, to be
more assertive, persuasive and social
ly comfortable in their every-day lives.
This trend is more marked in men
than women. Participators also tend
as a group to have good study habits,
again men apparently more so than
women.
Haimson is careful to point out that
he steers away from stereotypes and
statisical generalizations except when
they give hints as to where a problem

might lie. The students are accepted
as individuals, he says, and their prob
lems are treated as individual prob
lems.
The small discussion groups organ
ized by the Counseling Center are de
signed to give non-participators a
chance to "take a more detailed look
at their classroom behavior and pos
sibly increase the level or scope or
quality of their participation." The
groups are, of course, entirely volun
tary.
These groups take on some of the
aspects of group therapy, in that prob
lems are brought out into the open
and freely discussed. The difference,
however, is that the sessions are not
psychoanalytic in nature. They don't
don't probe thp subconscious or search
after childhood traumas.
Rather they treat non-participation
as a specific problem capable of having
specific individual solutions. The ap
proach is highly pragmatic. And some
students end up deciding that they

don't really care if they are talkative
in class or not.
A much larger number of students,
however, have expressed favor with
the program. Out of a sample of 60
who took part in it, about half re
mained for the duration of the pro
gram, about six sessions. Eighty per
cent said they thought the group was
useful.
Typical responses to a sampling of
opinion were: "Showed me my prob
lem wasn't unique;" "Made me realize
why I wasn't interested in my Civ.
class and ways I could get more en
thusiastic;" "Just by expressing my
self in the meetings, I felt more at
ease and relaxed in class;" "I realized
I didn't need it."
Although the discussion group proj
ect is intended primarily as a service
directly for individual students, it
has become part of a broad research
project now being conducted by the
Counseling and Testing Service. Haim
son describes it as an effort to discover

more about all aspects of teacher-stu
dent interaction, not just those that
take place in a Western Civ. section.
One of the methods used to observe
the dynamics of group discussion is
videotape television. According to
Haimson, this use of videotape is still
quite experimental, and the effects
on a group of seeing themselves play
ed back on television have not yet
been determined.
Furthermore, it has not been deter
mined how the group's awareness that
it is being taped might affect their
behavior. So far, the taping of a group
has not been conducted without their
knowledge.
Haimson says the members of
other departments of the University
have expressed informally an interest
in the study. Western Civilization has
been, so far, the only department in
active cooperation with the project.
Freshmen who are interested in the
program will have a chance to join it
soon when it gets under way this year.
