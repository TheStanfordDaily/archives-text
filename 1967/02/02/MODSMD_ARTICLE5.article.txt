involved shall be omitted. (Those re

Fundamental Standard and Honor
Code Commission to be submitted,
after approval by the Judicial Coun
cils, to The Stanford Daily for twice
monthly publication."
"Whereas: the Fundamental Stan
dard and Honor Code Commission was
abolished last year, and
"Whereas: the above mentioned sec
tion is therefore invalid, and
"Whereas: the Judicial Council at
present is under no legal obligation to
the Associated Students to make pub
lic anything concerning cases because

of the invalidity of this section,
"Therefore, be it enacted by the
Legislature of the Associated Students
here assembled that Article IV, Sec

Judicial Council. All names or inci

in applying the Fundamentaal San
dard."
An appropriation for a student cof
fee house will also be returned from

tion.
