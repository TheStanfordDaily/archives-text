# Beta Chi Adopts Coed Pledges In Diverse Living Community
## 
### DICK RIORDAN 
The term "frat woman" seems to
involve an inherent contradiction. Yet
Anne Phillips, an English graduate
student, and two undergraduates,
Pamela Morgan and Gail Grabstein,
joined Beta Chi fraternity under its
new open membership policy.
Early autumn quarter Beta Chi an
nounced that it was dropping selective
rush and that faculty, graduates, and
women were welcome as members.
"This approach results in natural
selection," Anne Phillips told The
Daily yesterday. "Those interested in
the advantages particular to Beta Chi
will seek membership." Those who
feel they would not fit into the living
group will have no desire to join.
Natural selection, she said, points to
the emphasis Beta Chi places upon the
value of the individual personality. She
sees in Beta Chi the opportunity for
"the mature expression of individual
differences within an intellectual and
social group." Of equal importance in
her decision to become a member was
her hope that Beta Chi could function
as a microcosm of University life, its
diverse membership "representing all
segments of the University commu
nity."

Acquaintance with, and respect for,
Beta Chi members motivated all the
girls to join. "They want to come in
contact with new people, new ideas,
and new experiences," commented Gail
Grabstein, "in order to expand the
view of life they already have." Pam
Morgan calls Beta Chi members "sen
sitive and highly individual. They can
n't be stereotyped, yet they make up
as cohesive a living group as one can
find."
All saw membership as a chance to
participate in informal communication
with all levels of the University. Rela
tionships that escape the two extremes
of dating and between class conversa
tion become possible within the fra
ternity. All three girls describe Beta
Chi as "a place where I'm comfort
able."
The loss of almuni support without
commensurate assistance from other
outside sources, and lack of the strong
tradition which characterizes the con
ventional fraternity are the two major
dangers facing Beta Chi, according
to Anne Phillips.
Thus Beta Chi has yoked together,
for better or for worse, the female and
the fraternity.
