# FUROR OVER NUDE
## UCLA Literary Supplement Suspended For Obscenity 
### 
(CPS—The weekly literary supple
ment of UCLA's Daily Bruin, the
student newspaper, was suspended
from publication following pressure
from local officials who protested the
reproduction of a picture of a nude
woman and an accompanying article
which was run in the Jan. 18 issue
of the paper.
The picture, appearing in the sup
plement Intro, drew criticism from
several Los Angeles County supervis
ors, local newspapers and two UCLA
students, who say they will sue for
discontinuance of the Daily Bruin.
The picture, drawn by the German
artist George Grosz, drew violent re
action from the German government
in 1923 when it was first exhibited.
The government imposed a fine on
Grosz and ordered that his exhibitions
be dismantled.
The decision to suspend Intro
was passed unanimously in an an
emergency meeting of the student
Communications Board, which called
for a policy study committee to set
up guidelines to insure the independ
ence of student publications. The
board announced that it found noth
ing wrong with the article but sus
pended publication partly because of
recent political pressure by conserva
tives to investigate the university.
"We didn't want to penalize any

body personally," Communciations
Board Chairman Chris Emerson said,
"but we had to act—the timing (of
the article) was so bad."
The board reached its decision after
almost five hours in executive session
with Daily Bruin editor Neil Reich
line, Intro editor Digby Diehl, DB
advisor James Howard and UCLA
Chancellor Franklin Murphy.
The policy study—chaired by Diehl
—will hold open hearings to consider
what material can be considered ac
ceptable for Intro with respect to
the readership of the Daily Bruin.
Diehl said that his committee,
rather than imposing censorship, will
set up specific recommendations to
"establish a liberal precedent" for stu
dent publications.
Editor Reichline said that the
board's action was taken because
"the Communications Board was
pressured by the situation of the uni
versity today. Keeping this in mind,"
he added, "I suppose their decision
was a wise one."
The Los Angeles County Board of
Supervisors became involved in the
Intro controversy when it decided
to refer the Intro article to the
County Anti-Obscenity Commission
and to send copies of that edition to
the President of the Board of Reegnts
and to the governor's office.

One member of the Board of Su
pervisors, Warren Dorn, expressed
his disapproval of the article and com
pared it to an erhibit at the Los
Angeles County Art Museum last
year. Dorn had vehemently denounced
the exhibit, a presentation of modern
art sculpture by Edward Kienholz
which included sculptures of old cars
and of couples petting. As a result
of Dorn's objections, the exhibit was
a great success and attracted thou
sands of viewers, according to the
Daily Bruin.
"I didn't like the Intro article at
all," Dorn said. "I thought it was ob
scene in nature, much like the Kien
holz exhibit."
Several students have said that the
actions of the Board of Supervisors
and the attacks by local papers were
prompted by the firing of University
of California President Clark Kerr
last week. Kerr's dismissal was inter
preted as a victory by conservative
governor Ronald Reagan who had
made "New Left" activity at the Uni

versity a major issue in his campaign.
The governor, after seeing a copy
of Intro, was reported on a tele
vision news program as being "in
articulate with rage." Reagan said
that "anybody who would print any
thing like this (Grosz's picture) is
sick."
Intro editor Diehl said that he
plans to fight for the rights of stu
dents to speak and act freely. "Our
voices have not been silenced by
cowardice,'' he said.
Diehl charged that the uproar
against Intro represents a political
"invasion of the sanctity of the uni
versity." He added that the article
was printed by "mature, serious and
informed students."
Diehl said that those who objected
to the article are "naive." "I can't be
lieve that they have read any litera
ture of this century." Several stu
dents reported that members of the
art department find the attacks on
the issue "laughable."
But not all UCLA students seem

to agree with the art department.
Two students have filed suit with the
Los Angeles superior court to pre
vent the Da«ly Bruin from publish
ing what they call "filth and porno
graphy." The suit is directed toward
Chancellor Franklin Murphy.
The two students, Alan Bock and
Jeraldine Anderson, said that objec
tion a b 1 e material in the Daily
Bruin "has a tendency to generate
in the minds of the general public a
belief that students at UCLA are
lewd and dissolute."
Bock and Anderson, who announced
their intended suit in a press con
ference, said they not only objected
to the Intro issue but they also
cited an Oct. 14, 1966, column by J.
Akin which appeared on the Daily
Bruin editorial page under the head
line "Sex and Christianity." The ar
ticle, the petitioners said, is one in
which "the Christian religion was
held up to ridicule."
Diehl charged that the two stu
dents, who are both members of the
Young Republicans Club, made their
announcement in an expensive hotel
which, he said, could only have been
paid for by the Republican organiza
tion.
Diehl added that the protestors
seem to be acting as "agents of
Mayor (Sam) Yorty to bring political
pressure on the students of the uni
versity, which the students resent
greatly."

Diehl charged that the uproar
against Intro represents a political

Diehl said that those who objected

lieve that they have read any litera

art department find the attacks on
the issue "laughable."
But not all UCLA students seem

to agree with the art department.
Two students have filed suit with the
Los Angeles superior court to pre
vent the Da«ly Bruin from publish
ing what they call "filth and porno
graphy." The suit is directed toward
Chancellor Franklin Murphy.
The two students, Alan Bock and
Jeraldine Anderson, said that objec
tion a b 1 e material in the Daily
Bruin "has a tendency to generate
in the minds of the general public a
belief that students at UCLA are
lewd and dissolute."
Bock and Anderson, who announced
their intended suit in a press con
ference, said they not only objected
to the Intro issue but they also
cited an Oct. 14, 1966, column by J.
Akin which appeared on the Daily
Bruin editorial page under the head
line "Sex and Christianity." The ar
ticle, the petitioners said, is one in
which "the Christian religion was
held up to ridicule."
Diehl charged that the two stu

Young Republicans Club, made their
announcement in an expensive hotel
which, he said, could only have been
paid for by the Republican organiza

Diehl added that the protestors
seem to be acting as "agents of
Mayor (Sam) Yorty to bring political
pressure on the students of the uni

(CPS—The weekly literary supple
ment of UCLA's Daily Bruin, the
student newspaper, was suspended
from publication following pressure
from local officials who protested the
reproduction of a picture of a nude
woman and an accompanying article
which was run in the Jan. 18 issue
of the paper.
The picture, appearing in the sup
plement Intro, drew criticism from
several Los Angeles County supervis
ors, local newspapers and two UCLA
students, who say they will sue for
discontinuance of the Daily Bruin.
The picture, drawn by the German
artist George Grosz, drew violent re
action from the German government
in 1923 when it was first exhibited.
The government imposed a fine on
Grosz and ordered that his exhibitions
be dismantled.
The decision to suspend Intro
was passed unanimously in an an
emergency meeting of the student
Communications Board, which called
for a policy study committee to set
up guidelines to insure the independ
ence of student publications. The
board announced that it found noth
ing wrong with the article but sus
pended publication partly because of
recent political pressure by conserva
tives to investigate the university.
"We didn't want to penalize any

body personally," Communciations
Board Chairman Chris Emerson said,
"but we had to act—the timing (of
the article) was so bad."
The board reached its decision after
almost five hours in executive session
with Daily Bruin editor Neil Reich
line, Intro editor Digby Diehl, DB
advisor James Howard and UCLA
Chancellor Franklin Murphy.
The policy study—chaired by Diehl
—will hold open hearings to consider
what material can be considered ac
ceptable for Intro with respect to
the readership of the Daily Bruin.
Diehl said that his committee,
rather than imposing censorship, will
set up specific recommendations to
"establish a liberal precedent" for stu
dent publications.
Editor Reichline said that the
board's action was taken because
"the Communications Board was
pressured by the situation of the uni
versity today. Keeping this in mind,"
he added, "I suppose their decision
was a wise one."
The Los Angeles County Board of
Supervisors became involved in the
Intro controversy when it decided
to refer the Intro article to the
County Anti-Obscenity Commission
and to send copies of that edition to
the President of the Board of Reegnts
and to the governor's office.

One member of the Board of Su
pervisors, Warren Dorn, expressed
his disapproval of the article and com
pared it to an erhibit at the Los
Angeles County Art Museum last
year. Dorn had vehemently denounced
the exhibit, a presentation of modern
art sculpture by Edward Kienholz
which included sculptures of old cars
and of couples petting. As a result
of Dorn's objections, the exhibit was
a great success and attracted thou
sands of viewers, according to the
Daily Bruin.
"I didn't like the Intro article at
all," Dorn said. "I thought it was ob
scene in nature, much like the Kien
holz exhibit."
Several students have said that the
actions of the Board of Supervisors
and the attacks by local papers were
prompted by the firing of University
of California President Clark Kerr
last week. Kerr's dismissal was inter
preted as a victory by conservative
governor Ronald Reagan who had
made "New Left" activity at the Uni

versity a major issue in his campaign.
The governor, after seeing a copy
of Intro, was reported on a tele
vision news program as being "in
articulate with rage." Reagan said
that "anybody who would print any
thing like this (Grosz's picture) is
sick."

The Los Angeles County Board of
Supervisors became involved in the
Intro controversy when it decided
to refer the Intro article to the
County Anti-Obscenity Commission
and to send copies of that edition to
the President of the Board of Reegnts
and to the governor's office.

One member of the Board of Su
pervisors, Warren Dorn, expressed
his disapproval of the article and com
pared it to an erhibit at the Los
Angeles County Art Museum last
year. Dorn had vehemently denounced
the exhibit, a presentation of modern
art sculpture by Edward Kienholz
which included sculptures of old cars
and of couples petting. As a result
of Dorn's objections, the exhibit was
a great success and attracted thou
sands of viewers, according to the
Daily Bruin.
"I didn't like the Intro article at
all," Dorn said. "I thought it was ob
scene in nature, much like the Kien
holz exhibit."
Several students have said that the
actions of the Board of Supervisors
and the attacks by local papers were
prompted by the firing of University
of California President Clark Kerr
last week. Kerr's dismissal was inter
preted as a victory by conservative
governor Ronald Reagan who had
made "New Left" activity at the Uni

versity a major issue in his campaign.
The governor, after seeing a copy
of Intro, was reported on a tele
vision news program as being "in
articulate with rage." Reagan said
that "anybody who would print any
thing like this (Grosz's picture) is
sick."
Intro editor Diehl said that he
plans to fight for the rights of stu
dents to speak and act freely. "Our
voices have not been silenced by
cowardice,'' he said.
Diehl charged that the uproar
against Intro represents a political
"invasion of the sanctity of the uni
versity." He added that the article
was printed by "mature, serious and
informed students."
Diehl said that those who objected
to the article are "naive." "I can't be
lieve that they have read any litera
ture of this century." Several stu
dents reported that members of the
art department find the attacks on
the issue "laughable."
But not all UCLA students seem

to agree with the art department.
Two students have filed suit with the
Los Angeles superior court to pre
vent the Da«ly Bruin from publish
ing what they call "filth and porno
graphy." The suit is directed toward
Chancellor Franklin Murphy.
The two students, Alan Bock and
Jeraldine Anderson, said that objec
tion a b 1 e material in the Daily
Bruin "has a tendency to generate
in the minds of the general public a
belief that students at UCLA are
lewd and dissolute."
Bock and Anderson, who announced
their intended suit in a press con
ference, said they not only objected
to the Intro issue but they also
cited an Oct. 14, 1966, column by J.
Akin which appeared on the Daily
Bruin editorial page under the head
line "Sex and Christianity." The ar
ticle, the petitioners said, is one in
which "the Christian religion was
held up to ridicule."
Diehl charged that the two stu
dents, who are both members of the
Young Republicans Club, made their
announcement in an expensive hotel
which, he said, could only have been
paid for by the Republican organiza
tion.
Diehl added that the protestors
seem to be acting as "agents of
Mayor (Sam) Yorty to bring political
pressure on the students of the uni
versity, which the students resent
greatly."
(CPS—The weekly literary supple
ment of UCLA's Daily Bruin, the
student newspaper, was suspended
from publication following pressure
from local officials who protested the
reproduction of a picture of a nude
woman and an accompanying article
which was run in the Jan. 18 issue
of the paper.
The picture, appearing in the sup
plement Intro, drew criticism from
several Los Angeles County supervis
ors, local newspapers and two UCLA
students, who say they will sue for
discontinuance of the Daily Bruin.
The picture, drawn by the German
artist George Grosz, drew violent re
action from the German government
in 1923 when it was first exhibited.
The government imposed a fine on
Grosz and ordered that his exhibitions
be dismantled.
The decision to suspend Intro
was passed unanimously in an an
emergency meeting of the student
Communications Board, which called
for a policy study committee to set
up guidelines to insure the independ
ence of student publications. The
board announced that it found noth
ing wrong with the article but sus
pended publication partly because of
recent political pressure by conserva
tives to investigate the university.
"We didn't want to penalize any

body personally," Communciations
Board Chairman Chris Emerson said,
"but we had to act—the timing (of
the article) was so bad."
The board reached its decision after
almost five hours in executive session
with Daily Bruin editor Neil Reich
line, Intro editor Digby Diehl, DB
advisor James Howard and UCLA
Chancellor Franklin Murphy.
The policy study—chaired by Diehl
—will hold open hearings to consider
what material can be considered ac
ceptable for Intro with respect to
the readership of the Daily Bruin.
Diehl said that his committee,
rather than imposing censorship, will
set up specific recommendations to
"establish a liberal precedent" for stu
dent publications.

board's action was taken because
