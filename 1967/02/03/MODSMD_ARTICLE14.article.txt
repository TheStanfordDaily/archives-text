# Out-'Rage-ous Movie
## 
### CURTISS B. KECK 
A mostly unconvincing melo
drama, which nonetheless has its
few tense moments, "Rage" uses
the dog-eared plotline of a "race
against time" to show the strug
gle for life of a man who, after
ten years of slowly trying to de
stroy himself, suddenly and des
parately wants to live.
In a remote Mexican mining
camp, a doctor (Glenn Ford)
wallows in drunkness and self
pity, torturing himself for the
night, ten years ago, when he
had been unable to save the lives
of his wife and son after a car
wreck.
Rabid Dog
A roving whore - house • on -
wheels trundles into the camp.
One of the girls (Stella Stevens)
takes a fancy to the doctor. The
doctor rejects her advances, and
she flails his chronic self-pity.
With a single, flouting comment,
"Your wife's been dead for ten
years," she succeeds in exhum
ing the drunken and self-for
saken "medicine man" from his
wife's grave.
The crucial incident of the
movie passes almost unnoticed
at the time, for not until eight
days atfer shrugging off a dog
bite, does the doctor discover
that the dog was rabid. The doc
tor then has 48 hours in which
to be innoculated before his ra
bies infection becomes incurable.
Somehow he must cross hun
dreds of miles of Mexican waste
lands to reach the nearest hospi
tal.
No Catharsis
Although the doctor's frantic
struggle to reach the hospital
generates mild excitement,
"Rage" fails to provide a cathar
sis through which the doctor is
made to recognize the futility of
his self-pity. In fact never is the
essential premise established
that, except for the girl, the doc
tor would not have expended the
effort necessary to save his own
life.
"Rage" sinks to a nadir of
soap opera melodrama when, for
reasons unfathomable to me, the
doctor happens across Stella
Stevens in an old, rickety line
shack in the middle of the desert.
Also unconvincing is the at
tack of guilt which drives the
doctor to take the responsibility
of the Hipocratic oath, at the
cost of precious hours in his race
against death, and save a wom
an from fatal childbirth.
Perhaps the most damaging
flaw in the movie lies in the one
dimensional, vaguely implied re
lationship between the doctor
and the girl. This relationship
must be super-charged with emo
tion, for it is through the slut
that the doctor becomes intent
on wanting to live.
Ford Miscast
The voluptuous and intoxicat
ing Miss Stella Stevens plays
her role to perfection. Her every
move, every word, every spread

legged sprawl was that of seduc
tion. Phenomenal.
Glenn Ford seemed miscast as
the doctor. As an actor he cannot
muster the breadth of character
necessary in portraying a highly
emotional role.
"Rage" is a melodrama in the
worst sense of the word. Every
turn of the plot leaves the chara
cters without choice of action.
Their decisions and the conse
quences of their actions are dic
tated by what is to follow. When
the doctor overcomes his all-con
suming self-pity, the plot re
quires him to reverse his atti-

tudes toward life in order for
his fight across the desert to
take on any meaning.
Netherland
Here and elsewhere the plot
moved the characters, as would
a neophytic chessplayer his
pieces, so as to set up that check
mate of excitement — the doc
tor's grueling struggle to reach
a hospital. It is the movies'
shrugging lack of regard for
sense of realism and for explica
tion that places "Rage" in the
netherland of melodrama and
the wasteland of entertainment.

at the time, for not until eight

bite, does the doctor discover

No Catharsis
Although the doctor's frantic
struggle to reach the hospital
generates mild excitement,
"Rage" fails to provide a cathar
sis through which the doctor is
made to recognize the futility of
his self-pity. In fact never is the
essential premise established
that, except for the girl, the doc
tor would not have expended the
effort necessary to save his own
life.
"Rage" sinks to a nadir of
soap opera melodrama when, for
reasons unfathomable to me, the
doctor happens across Stella
Stevens in an old, rickety line
shack in the middle of the desert.
Also unconvincing is the at
tack of guilt which drives the
doctor to take the responsibility
of the Hipocratic oath, at the
cost of precious hours in his race
against death, and save a wom
an from fatal childbirth.
Perhaps the most damaging
flaw in the movie lies in the one
dimensional, vaguely implied re
lationship between the doctor
and the girl. This relationship
must be super-charged with emo
tion, for it is through the slut
that the doctor becomes intent
on wanting to live.
Ford Miscast
The voluptuous and intoxicat
ing Miss Stella Stevens plays
her role to perfection. Her every
move, every word, every spread

legged sprawl was that of seduc
tion. Phenomenal.
Glenn Ford seemed miscast as
the doctor. As an actor he cannot
muster the breadth of character
necessary in portraying a highly
emotional role.
"Rage" is a melodrama in the
worst sense of the word. Every
turn of the plot leaves the chara
cters without choice of action.
Their decisions and the conse
quences of their actions are dic
tated by what is to follow. When
the doctor overcomes his all-con
suming self-pity, the plot re
quires him to reverse his atti-

tudes toward life in order for
his fight across the desert to
take on any meaning.

Here and elsewhere the plot
moved the characters, as would
a neophytic chessplayer his

mate of excitement — the doc

a hospital. It is the movies'
shrugging lack of regard for
sense of realism and for explica
tion that places "Rage" in the
netherland of melodrama and
the wasteland of entertainment.
A mostly unconvincing melo
drama, which nonetheless has its
few tense moments, "Rage" uses
the dog-eared plotline of a "race
against time" to show the strug
gle for life of a man who, after
ten years of slowly trying to de
stroy himself, suddenly and des
parately wants to live.
In a remote Mexican mining
camp, a doctor (Glenn Ford)
wallows in drunkness and self

of his wife and son after a car
wreck.
