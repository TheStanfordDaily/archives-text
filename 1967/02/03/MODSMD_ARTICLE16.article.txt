THEATER
With three resounding suc
cesses in their three productions
so far this season, the American
Conservatory Theater will shoot
for four when it opens TORCH
BEARERS, George E. Kelly's
satire on community theater, to
night and tomorrow night at the
Geary Theater in S. F. ACT fol
lows on Sunday night with their
much acclaimed production of
TINY ALICE, also at the Geary
Theater.
While Stanford Repertory
Theatory Theator's production
of John Gay's BEGGAR'S OP
ERA drags into its third week at
Mem Aud., an SRT tutored
group from the Speach and
Drama Department has stolen
the limelight with a sterling ren
dition of Moliere's troublesome
DON JUAN. (See review of this
page). Tickets may be had at
the Tresidder Union box office.
The show will continue through
the week at the Nitery.
While the poems will never
be sung again with all the fervor
and passion of the bacchanalian
bard himself, it might almost
seem the muse of Dylan Thomas
had touched the tongue and lit
the heart of Jack Aranson,
whose phenomenal performance
of THE WORLD OF DYLAN
THOMAS has been held over
another week at the S.F. City
Theater. The program consists
of stories, dramatic writings and
sketches from the late poet's
life. Catch this rare performance
while it lasts.
THE PHYSICISTS, Friedrich
Durrenmatt's marvelous tragi
comic attack on atomic warfare,
continues at the Playhouse, S.F.

MOVIES
Tonight, Tressider presents
the Japanese film, GATES OF
HELL. I don't know a thing
about the movie, but if it's any
thing like JAWS OF DEATH,
some distinguished body ought
to select it as one of The 10 Tri
test Film Titles of the year.
What happens to the gambler
who loses to the bottle? What
happens to the pool shark whose
knuckles are busted? These are
the classic questions which form
the dramatic basis of THE
HUSTLER, Tresidder's Saturday
night flick, a smooth and studly
pool room soap opera starring
Paul Newmann and Jackie Glea
son. At the insignificant risk of
giving the plot away, I will tel 1
you that in the end Newman
loses the girl, but wins the show
down pool game, thereby abro
gating his opportunity ever to
play again in big-time competi
tion. This may be the last chance
you get to see this movie before
it is relegated to the Late, Late
Show.
If, like myself, you haven't
seen A MAN AND A WOMAN,
you ought to go see it. I'm be
coming deathly tired of people
asking me if I've seen it, and
then proceeding, at no inconsid
erable length, to explain how
fabulous it is. I'm going. I hope
I hate it.
