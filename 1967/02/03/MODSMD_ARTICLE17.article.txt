## Indian Cagers Face Denver Challenge 
### 
Stanford's hotter-all-the-time
basketball team, winners of five
of their last six games, face a
serious threat tonight at 8 p.m.
against the visiting University of
Denver Pioneers. Saturday at
2:30 p.m., the U.S. Air Force
Falcons swoop into the Pavilion
for a non-conference game.
Seven of last year's Denver let
termen are still on the court, and
those are seven big ones. The
Pioneer front lino averages over
6-8, and their backcourt is hot.
Denver knocked oIT Oklahoma
City, which beat the Indians,
88-73, over Christmas vacation.
Stanford coach Howie Dallmar
will rely on Don Griffin for the
Indians' big job on defense. All-
American candidate Harry Hol
lines will be the toughest man
to contain.
Griffin Does No Wrong
Against Santa Clara last week,
Griffin held 20-point average
Gervasoni to 2 points, and com
mitted nary a foul in the process
(he did, however, commit 18
points to the Stanford score
board.) Griffin also led both
teams in rebounds with 11.
Hollines is dunking shots at a
26.5 clip. He hit 41 in against the
Air Force, and has been held
under 20 only twice.
Brian Clare, 6-10 center, Bryon
Beck, 6-8 forward, and George
Roderick, a 6-7 forward, put the
Pioneers' front line somewhere
on top of the Rockies.
Art Harris played his best

game in several weeks when he
hit 22 to lead the Cards to an
88-73 win over Santa Clara. Gary
Petersmeyer poured in 19 from
his übiquitous guard position,
and forward Howard Hassen hit
his season's high, 14 points,
against the Broncos.
Air Force lost to Denver, 100-
80, but will be no pushover. Cliff
Parson, a 6-10 center, hit 32
against Denver and holds 3
inches over the longest Indian,
center Rich Baker.
ON THE EYE
The Air Force game will be
televised over ABC. During the
half time, excerpts from the
UCLA-Stanford water polo game
will be screened. The Bruins won
that one, 9-8, with two seconds
left in the game to clinch the
national championship.

a two-game schedule this week
end. The Papooses host the Uni

Last week, Santa Clara's fresh
man squad turned fortune's ra

the Papooses could never get off
the ground.

Mare Island Naval Station at 4

Gap, will have their hands full
with the O Club, who blanketed
Piedmont 20-0 the week before.
The toe of Mike Grace has
been the Tribe's most effective

Newbery have done the damag

Blaine Nye, and Eric DeGooyer
have hooked the ball out of the
scrum.
