# UC Students Seek Support For Protest March On Sacramento
## 
### PAT McMAHON Assistant Managing Editor 
Representatives of the student
march on Sacramento set for Feb
ruary 9 sought Stanford participation
yesterday morning at a meeting in
Tresidder.
"The general academic community
overreaches strict institutional
bounds," said Rob Roark, explaining
the reason for support sought from

Stanford, and he urged both students
and professors to take part.
Rob Roark and three others repre
sented the organizers of the march,
the Associated Students of the Uni
versity of California at Santa Barbara
including Larry Adams, professor of
political science at UCSB.
Adams explained that the march
has two intentions: to present to the
Governor and to seek to support

friends of the University who are
legislators.
Roark outlined the specifics of the
march. Professors, who are asked to
wear academic dress, and students
will gather at UC Davis on the morn
ing of Feb. 9 for breakfast and then
will be shuttled by bus to various
starting points. Roark also urged that
students meet at Davis rather than
going to Sacramento.
The NSA at Stanford last night an
nounced that they would organize
support for the march on the Stan
ford campus and would recruit par
ticipants.
"Once in Sacramento," Roark also
noted, "we will march to the Capitol
to demonstrate our support for the
freedom of the University (UC) from
political affairs. Then we will break
up into discussion groups and those
of us who are 21, and have made ap
pointments, will see our legislators."
Purpose
Roark also released a statement of
the purpose of the march made by
the Associated Students of UCSB:
WE SUPPORT:
(1) Freedom from political inter
ference in the affairs of the Univer
sity of California; (2) Excellence in
higher education sustained by full
budgetary support, especially in view
of increasing numbers of qualified
students; (3) California's tradition of
tuition-free higher education.
WE DEPLORE:
(1) The manner of dismissal of the
University President without consid
eration of the opinions of all seg
ments of the University community;
(2) The serious damage already done
to the University and to the state col
leges; (3) The consequent undermin
ing of national and international con
fidence in the future of the University
of California.
WE THEREFORE RESOLVE TO
ASSEMBLE IN SACRAMENTO:
(1) To affirm our support of the
principles that have been the founda
tion of California's system of higher
education, and to express our desire
and hope that the legislature will con
tinue to support these principles; and
(2) To meet with Gov. Reagan and
legislators to discuss the educational
concerns of students, faculty, and ad
ministrators; specifically, the future
growth of higher education, the pro
posed budget cuts and tuition, and
means of establishing meaningful
channels of communication between
the students and California's govern
mental officers.
