# Johnson Calls For Compromises In Vietnam
## 
### WALTER R. MEARS Associated Press Writer 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Pres
ident Johnson said yesterday it
will take concession by both the
United States and the Commu
nists to bring a negotiated peace
to Vietnam.
But, amid a swirl of rumors
about Vietnam peace moves,
Johnson said there has been no
hint of a serious Communist ef
fort to bring the conflict to the
conference table.
"... Every hour of every
day the spokesmen of this gov
ernment are under instructions
to explore every prospect for
peace," the President said.
But at a White House news
conference dominated by the
Southeast Asian war, this was
Johnson's refrain:

"In all candor, I am not aware
of an serious effort that the
other side has made, in my judg
ment, to bring the fighting to a
stop and to stop the war."
Time and again, Johnson stres
sed that point. For the United
States, he said, "I will do any
thing I can on the part of this
government to go more than
halfway to bring it to an end."
Underscoring that theme,
Johnson made these statements:
—"I think that any peace
agreements would involve under
standing on both parts and cer
tain concessions on both parts
... " But he said possible conces
sions cannot be discussed in ad
vance of negotiations.
—He said the United States is
prepared to halt the bombing of
North Vietnam in return for

"just almost any step" by the
Communists. "As far as we can
see they haven't taken any yet,"
he said. "We would be glad to
explore any reciprocal action ...
We have made one proposal
after the other.
"We'd like to have a cease
fire," he said, "we'd be real glad
to stop our bombing as we have
on two previous occasions if we
had any indication of reciprocal
action."
Johnson said the United States
stands ready to discuss mutual
steps to ease the combat, an ex
change of prisoners, an effort to
bring true demilitarization to the
demilitarized zone between
North and South Vietnam — "or
any other aspects which might
take even a small step in the
direction of peace."

But again he declared that
there has been no serious effort
by the other side to move toward
the peace table.
Almost every question during
the half-hour session dealt with
Vietnam. And when Johnson
faced one that did not — an in
quiry about his feelings on the
job he holds —the war came up
again.
"I go to bed every night feel
ing that I failed that day be
cause I couldn't end the conflict
in Vietnam," Johnson said.
It came up indirectly when
Johnson was asked about the Re
publican resurgence in Congress.
"I'm going to try to do with
the Congress what we are trying
to do with our adversaries in
other parts of the world," he
said. 'I am going to say to the
minority party that I willing to
meet them halfway."
Johnson said the administra
tion will try to work out "an
area of agreement" with com
promises designed to pass his
legislative proposals.
He said partisan infighting is
no good for the country.
On other topics:
—Johnson said China is hav
ing serious internal problems,
problems which are not going
to improve the position of North
Vietnam. "I do not see that the
differences in China are going
to contribute anything to the
strength of the North Vietna
mese," he said. But Johnson said
he was not implying that China's
internal discord is likely to bring
peace quickly.

—He urged Senate approval
of the proposed consular conven
tion with the Soviet Union. "I
feel very strongly that the rati
fication of this treating is very
much in our national interest,"
Johnson said. He said it could
mean 10 to 15 more Communist
diplomats in the United States,
but that does not raise security
or espionage problems "which
the FBI cannot effectively and
efficiently deal with."
"In my judgment it raises no
problem with respect to our na
tional security," Johnson said.
—Johnson defended the Demo
cratic National Committee, say
ing it gave the party's Congres
sional candidates more help in
the 1966 elections than at any
time in history.
"Some people have used the
committee as a whipping boy,
and some don't understand the
functions of the committee," he
said. Some Democratic politi
cians have sharply criticized the
committee's operations.
But again and again, the talk
returned to the war raging in
Asia.
"You may be sure that we are
diligent in our search for the
possibility of peaceful settle
ment," Johnson said. He said it
would not be helpful for him to
comment on any particular chan
nel that effort now is taking.
As for the possibility that he
might one day take a personal
role in peace negotiations, John
son said "if the other side de
sides to discuss peace at any
time, we will be very happy to

have appropriate arrangements
made." He said the questions of
who would negotiate, and where,
could be worked out then.
Johnson said once again that
settlement terms must include
self determination for South
Vietnam and freedom from the
threat or use of force there.

Johnson said there has been no
hint of a serious Communist ef
fort to bring the conflict to the
conference table.
"... Every hour of every
day the spokesmen of this gov
ernment are under instructions
to explore every prospect for
peace," the President said.
But at a White House news
conference dominated by the
Southeast Asian war, this was
Johnson's refrain:

"In all candor, I am not aware
of an serious effort that the
other side has made, in my judg
ment, to bring the fighting to a
stop and to stop the war."
Time and again, Johnson stres
sed that point. For the United
States, he said, "I will do any
thing I can on the part of this
government to go more than
halfway to bring it to an end."
Underscoring that theme,
Johnson made these statements:
—"I think that any peace
agreements would involve under
standing on both parts and cer
tain concessions on both parts
... " But he said possible conces
sions cannot be discussed in ad
vance of negotiations.
—He said the United States is
prepared to halt the bombing of
North Vietnam in return for

"just almost any step" by the
Communists. "As far as we can
see they haven't taken any yet,"
he said. "We would be glad to
explore any reciprocal action ...
We have made one proposal
after the other.
"We'd like to have a cease
fire," he said, "we'd be real glad
to stop our bombing as we have
on two previous occasions if we
had any indication of reciprocal
action."
Johnson said the United States
stands ready to discuss mutual
steps to ease the combat, an ex
change of prisoners, an effort to
bring true demilitarization to the
demilitarized zone between
North and South Vietnam — "or
any other aspects which might
take even a small step in the
direction of peace."

But again he declared that
there has been no serious effort
by the other side to move toward
the peace table.
Almost every question during
the half-hour session dealt with
Vietnam. And when Johnson
faced one that did not — an in
quiry about his feelings on the
job he holds —the war came up
again.
"I go to bed every night feel
ing that I failed that day be
cause I couldn't end the conflict
in Vietnam," Johnson said.
It came up indirectly when
Johnson was asked about the Re
publican resurgence in Congress.
"I'm going to try to do with
the Congress what we are trying
to do with our adversaries in
other parts of the world," he
said. 'I am going to say to the
minority party that I willing to
meet them halfway."
Johnson said the administra
tion will try to work out "an
area of agreement" with com
promises designed to pass his
legislative proposals.
He said partisan infighting is
no good for the country.
On other topics:
—Johnson said China is hav
ing serious internal problems,
problems which are not going
to improve the position of North
Vietnam. "I do not see that the
differences in China are going
to contribute anything to the
strength of the North Vietna
mese," he said. But Johnson said
he was not implying that China's
internal discord is likely to bring
peace quickly.

—He urged Senate approval
of the proposed consular conven
tion with the Soviet Union. "I
feel very strongly that the rati
fication of this treating is very
much in our national interest,"
Johnson said. He said it could
mean 10 to 15 more Communist
diplomats in the United States,
but that does not raise security
or espionage problems "which
the FBI cannot effectively and
efficiently deal with."
"In my judgment it raises no
problem with respect to our na
tional security," Johnson said.
—Johnson defended the Demo
cratic National Committee, say
ing it gave the party's Congres
sional candidates more help in
the 1966 elections than at any
time in history.
"Some people have used the
committee as a whipping boy,
and some don't understand the
functions of the committee," he
said. Some Democratic politi
cians have sharply criticized the
committee's operations.
But again and again, the talk
returned to the war raging in
Asia.
"You may be sure that we are
diligent in our search for the
possibility of peaceful settle
ment," Johnson said. He said it
would not be helpful for him to
comment on any particular chan
nel that effort now is taking.
As for the possibility that he
might one day take a personal
role in peace negotiations, John
son said "if the other side de
sides to discuss peace at any
time, we will be very happy to

have appropriate arrangements
made." He said the questions of
who would negotiate, and where,
could be worked out then.
Johnson said once again that
settlement terms must include
self determination for South
Vietnam and freedom from the
threat or use of force there.

But at a White House news
conference dominated by the
Southeast Asian war, this was
Johnson's refrain:

"In all candor, I am not aware
of an serious effort that the
other side has made, in my judg
ment, to bring the fighting to a
stop and to stop the war."
Time and again, Johnson stres
sed that point. For the United
States, he said, "I will do any
thing I can on the part of this
government to go more than
halfway to bring it to an end."
Underscoring that theme,
Johnson made these statements:
—"I think that any peace
agreements would involve under
standing on both parts and cer
tain concessions on both parts
... " But he said possible conces
sions cannot be discussed in ad
vance of negotiations.
—He said the United States is
prepared to halt the bombing of
North Vietnam in return for

"just almost any step" by the
Communists. "As far as we can
see they haven't taken any yet,"
he said. "We would be glad to
explore any reciprocal action ...
We have made one proposal
after the other.
"We'd like to have a cease
fire," he said, "we'd be real glad
to stop our bombing as we have
on two previous occasions if we
had any indication of reciprocal
action."
Johnson said the United States
stands ready to discuss mutual
steps to ease the combat, an ex
change of prisoners, an effort to
bring true demilitarization to the
demilitarized zone between
North and South Vietnam — "or
any other aspects which might
take even a small step in the
direction of peace."

But again he declared that
there has been no serious effort
by the other side to move toward
the peace table.
Almost every question during
the half-hour session dealt with
Vietnam. And when Johnson
faced one that did not — an in
quiry about his feelings on the
job he holds —the war came up
again.
"I go to bed every night feel
ing that I failed that day be
cause I couldn't end the conflict
in Vietnam," Johnson said.
It came up indirectly when
Johnson was asked about the Re
publican resurgence in Congress.
"I'm going to try to do with
the Congress what we are trying
to do with our adversaries in
other parts of the world," he
said. 'I am going to say to the
minority party that I willing to
meet them halfway."
Johnson said the administra
tion will try to work out "an
area of agreement" with com
promises designed to pass his
legislative proposals.
He said partisan infighting is
no good for the country.
On other topics:
—Johnson said China is hav
ing serious internal problems,
problems which are not going
to improve the position of North
Vietnam. "I do not see that the
differences in China are going
to contribute anything to the
strength of the North Vietna
mese," he said. But Johnson said
he was not implying that China's
internal discord is likely to bring
peace quickly.

—He urged Senate approval
of the proposed consular conven
tion with the Soviet Union. "I
feel very strongly that the rati
fication of this treating is very
much in our national interest,"
Johnson said. He said it could
mean 10 to 15 more Communist
diplomats in the United States,
but that does not raise security
or espionage problems "which
the FBI cannot effectively and
efficiently deal with."
"In my judgment it raises no
problem with respect to our na
tional security," Johnson said.
—Johnson defended the Demo
cratic National Committee, say
ing it gave the party's Congres
sional candidates more help in
the 1966 elections than at any
time in history.
"Some people have used the
committee as a whipping boy,
and some don't understand the
functions of the committee," he
said. Some Democratic politi
cians have sharply criticized the
committee's operations.
But again and again, the talk
returned to the war raging in
Asia.
"You may be sure that we are
diligent in our search for the
possibility of peaceful settle
ment," Johnson said. He said it
would not be helpful for him to
comment on any particular chan
nel that effort now is taking.
As for the possibility that he
might one day take a personal
role in peace negotiations, John
son said "if the other side de
sides to discuss peace at any
time, we will be very happy to

have appropriate arrangements
made." He said the questions of
who would negotiate, and where,
could be worked out then.
Johnson said once again that
settlement terms must include
self determination for South
Vietnam and freedom from the
threat or use of force there.
WASHINGTON (AP) — Pres
ident Johnson said yesterday it
will take concession by both the
United States and the Commu
nists to bring a negotiated peace
to Vietnam.
But, amid a swirl of rumors
about Vietnam peace moves,
Johnson said there has been no
hint of a serious Communist ef
fort to bring the conflict to the
conference table.
"... Every hour of every
day the spokesmen of this gov
ernment are under instructions
to explore every prospect for
peace," the President said.
