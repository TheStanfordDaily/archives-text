# Justices To Consider Draft
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
war in Vietnam is casting a
lengthening shadow over the Su
preme Court.
The justices already have
agreed to decide how far demon
strators may go in practicing
"civil disobedience," and they
soon will have to make other
hard decisions involving the
war's unpopularity among cer
tain segments of the nation's
youth.
Three separate appeals now
at the Court's doorstep, awaiting
invitation to be heard, challenge
the government's right to im
prison draft card burners and
the legality of the draft and the
war itself.
If four of the nine justices
give assent, the Vietnam war
will, in effect, be tried by the
Supreme Court.
Major figures in the unfolding
drama are:
David J. Miller, 24, self-describ
ed Roman Catholic pacifist con
victed of setting fire to his draft
classification notice near the
Army's induction center in down
town New York.
David Henry Mitchell 111, 24-
year-old Greenwich Village book
store clerk who refused to report
for induction, was convicted of
draft evasion, and faces up to
five years in federal prison.
Howard Katz, 29, stock market
analyst, and David A. Baumann,
20, now serving with the Army
in Korea, who have been blocked
in lower court from challenging
the draft law's constitutionality.

The legal positions of these
four young men are diverse.
Miller, backed by the New
York Civil Liberties Union, has
said he is willing go to jail rath
er than obtain a new draft card.
He directly attacks the 1965 law
that prohibits draft card burn
ing, claiming its purpose is to
suppress dissent.
None of the three others
claims pacifism. And none claims
that he is a conscientious objec
tor.
The slender, soft-spoken Mitch
ell says he has a moral legal
duty under the international
charter which governed the trial
of Nazi leaders after World War
II to refuse to cooperate with
the draft.
The war in Vietnam, he says,
violates the other international
agreements; the selective service
system "is the criminal in this
case."
Under the Constitution, the
Mitchell appeal says, Congress—
not the President — has the
power to declare war. The brief
goes on to question whether the
President may legally "send the
armed forces of the United
States outside the continental
limits ... if such action is in vio
lation of . . . treaties and consti
tutional provisions."
Katz and Baumann base their
argument against the draft law
in the Nuernberg Charter and in
the ninth amendment to the U.S.
Constitution.
In suing to block enforcement
of the draft law they named as
defendants President Johnson,

Secretary of Defense Robert S.
McNamara and Lt. Gen. Lewis
B. Hershey, Selective Service Di
rector.
They cite the eighth article of
the Neurnberg Charter, which
said the fact that a Nazi accused
of war crimes "acted pursuant
to orders of his government or
of a superior shall not free him
of responsibility..."
And the ninth amendment to
the Constitution, they say, af
fords protection from govern
ment "force" represented by the
draft law.
