# Draft Commission To Issue Report
## 
### SEYMOUR M. HERSH Associated Press Writer 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
National Commission on Selec
tive Service will present a volu
minous study of the draft to
President Johnson within two
weeks, sources said yesterday.
The Commission had been ord
ered to report by Jan. 1.
"We are late but I'm not em
barrassed," one official said.
"We've been looking over these
issues pretty carefully.'
Many of the Commission's key
decisions were reached during
meetings in December and early
January, this informant said,
but the actual writing of the re
port was delayed.
"Several of the Commission
members said 'Let's go over this

or that again'," this source said.
"We've been tossing these
things back and worth.
"We've done what we think
is a good job."
Johnson set up the 20-member
Commission last summer in the
wake of increasing student pro
tests and growing dissatisfac
tion with the draft. He named
Burke Marshall, former Justice
Department official, as Director
and ordered the Commission to
make an exhaustive study of
the Selective Service.
Johnson already has made it
clear he believes the laws needs
changing. He told Congress in
his State uf the Union speech,
Jan. 10, "We should modernize
our Selective Service System."
After he receives the Commis

sion's report, the President told
the legislators, "I will send you
new recommendations to meet
our military manpower needs,
but let us resolve that this is
to be the Congress that made
our draft laws as fair and as ef
fective as possible."
Sources said the Commission,
in meetings last year, quickly
ruled out any radical changes
in the present system — such as
the proposed alternatives of a
standing professional army or a
wide-spread national service pro
gram.
The report is known, however,
to call for an extensive shakeup
of the draft system and for the
setting up of national standards
for student and other defer
ments to reduce inequities.
But just what else will be
recommended is not known.
There have been reports that
some form of a modified lottery
will be proposed. Sources indi
cated that if the Commission
does make such a recommenda
tion, the proposed lottery would
be modest in scope — involving
only those youths classified IA.
Deferments would continue un
der the present basis.
A lottery plan proposed by
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-
Mass., and others would assign
a number to all 18-year-olds
found fit by their local draft
boards. Those who received edu
cational deferment would — aft
er college — go right back into
the 18-year-old lottery pool.
Commission members are
known also to have seriously de
bated the Pentagon suggestion
that the order of draft be re
versed to begin taking 18- and
19-year-old youths instead of the
older men first.
"We've been going over and
over these things," one source
said.
Secretary of Defense Robert
S. McNamara told Congress last
week in his annual Defense Pos
ture Statement that draft calls
over the next 18 months will
continue strong. He said that
about 17,000 youths will be in
ducted each month through this
June, and about 24,000 will be
drafted monthly in the follow
ing 12 months.
Draft calls reached a high —
nearly 41,000 a month — in the
August - through • November pe
riod last year. Since the Vietnam
buildup began late in 1964, about
650,000 youths have been induct
ed into the Armed Services.
