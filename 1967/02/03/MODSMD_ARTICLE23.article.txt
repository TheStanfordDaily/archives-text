# Salisbury Tells Senators About Hanoi
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Har
rison E. Salisbury of the New
York Times said yesterday he
believes the Hanoi government
"is ready to begin to talk busi
ness" about peace in Vietnam,
but any negotiations must begin
in total secrecy.
"If it's being done, I don't
want to know about it," said the
newsman whose accounts of
bomb damage and civilian ca
sualties in North Vietnam
stirred national debate at the
turn of the year.
"I don't want to read about
it . . . Salisbury told the Sen
ate Foreign Relations Commit
tee, "because that means it isn't
ticking."
Salisbury, an Assistant Man
aging Editor of the Times, said
Hanoi's dependence on Soviet
and Chinese supplies must be
forcing a reappraisal of the
communist position on peace
talks.
He said civil war inside Chi
na or a heightening of the dis
pute between the Peking regime
and the Soviet Union could lead
to a halt in essential supplies.
"Any reasonable or prudent
(Hanoi) government must see
that the chances are that they
are stronger today than they
may be a few months from now
or a year from now," Salisbury
said.
Salisbury said he thinks Ha
noi may be flexible on one point

that looms as an obstacle to
successful peace talks—the com
munists' insistence that the gov
ernment of South Vietnam be
reshaped on their terms.
"It is my impression, and it's
a subjective one, that there is
less hardness on that point than
you might suspect," he said.
Salisbury said he gathered
these impressions during his
two-week visit to North Viet
nam, which began Dec. 23.
He said the war appears to
be at a turning point, with ei
ther a negotiated settlement or
dangerous escalation ahead.
Meanwhile in Poland, U.S.
Ambassador John A. Gronouski
declined comment on a report
that mid-December bombing of
the Hanoi area upset a Polish
effort to start peace talks be
tween North Vietnam and the
United States.
"I wouldn't want to comment
on that," Gronouski said when
asked about a Washington Post
story which said United Nations
sources considered December
peace moves by Poland prom
ising.
Postponing a scheduled vaca
tion, Gronouski flew to Wash
ington Dec. 22 for one day of
consultations at the State De
partment. He returned saying
he had discussed financial mat
ters and his forthcoming Jan
uary meeting with the Chinese
Communists in Warsaw.
Polish officials, who complain

that inflexibility in Washington
and Hanoi is frustrating them,
have said they would undertake
peace moves only with reason
able promise of results, and
with a halt to U.S. bombing as
an essential condition.
Salisbury said American
bombing of the communist
North has cemented the nation
—as air raids unified Britain
and Germany during World
War 11.
"The bombing has caused the
country to acquire a spirit of
national purpose and unity," he
said. . . The people have . . .
rallied around the national
cause on the basis of patriotism
rather than communism."
Salisbury said welding of pub
lic sentiment may outweigh
the military advantages of the
bombing, which he said are lim
ited.
Furthermore, he said, a halt
in the air raids would bring
world opinion to bear on North
Vietnam to take "some recipro
cal step to match our move."
Salisbury said the American
bombing is slowing somewhat
the flow of North Vietnamese
men and supplies into South
Vietnam. But he suggested sup
plies still are being sent south
ward as rapidly as they can be
used.
"Why doesn't North Vietnam
give up?" asked Sen. J. W. Ful
bright, (D., Ark.), "Why are
they so stubborn?"

"They don't trust us," Salis
bury replied.
"Why don't they trust us,
we're trustworthy people?"
"They say we keep fighting
harder, dropping more bombs,"
Salisbury replied. "They have a
feeling that we have evil inten
tions toward them."
Salisbury acknowledged one
error, but generally defended
the reports he filed from North
Vietnam. The mistake, he said,
was in his initial story, which
did not attribute civilian casual
ty figures to communist offi
cials.
"This was an error on my
part, a simple journalistic er
ror," Salisbury said.
Salisbury said it is impossible
to wage air war on military in
stallations without killing some
civilians.
"I was surprised at the reac
tion in this country," he said,
"when I described what seemed
to me a perfectly ordinary re
sult."
"I think the connotation which
resulted from your earlier
stories at least is that you
thought we were bombing noth
ing but metropolitan areas
without military significance of
any kind," said Sen. Bourke B.
Hickenlooper, (R., Iowa).
"This is not the correct im
pression and I think if you ex
amine the stories again, you'll
see that," Salisbury said.
