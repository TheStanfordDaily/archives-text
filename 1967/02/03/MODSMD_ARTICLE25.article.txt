# The 						Edge Of Greatness...
## Two Minutes of Haight Human Hope In A Frantic Age 
### Tim Haight 
We all need love, compassion,
and understanding. But do we
have time for it? Our present
society has succeeded in defeat
ing its own purpose, to be a ve
hicle for men living well. It bru
talizes, confuses, frustrates, and
sickens where it should help.
In On Agression, Konrad Lo
renz writes of the Argus Pheas
ant, a silly bird who grows such
long wing and tail feathers that
it can hardly fly. It grows them
to attract the opposite sex, and
in that it succeeds. More and
more pheasants are bom into
the world unable to fly because
sexual selection has predomi
nated over survival value in se
lection.
Lorenz then writes, "Next to
the wings of the Argus Pheas
ant, the hectic life of Western
Civilized man is the most stupid
product of intra-specific selec
tion!"
Life of Rush
"The rushed existence into
which industrialized, commer
cialized man has precipitated
himself is actually a good ex
ample of an independent devel
opment caused entirely by com
petition between members of
the same species. Human beings
of today are attacked by so
called manager diseases, high
blood pressure, renal atrophy,
gastric ulcers, and torturing
neuroses; they succumb to bar
barism because they have no
more time for cultural interests.
"And all this is unnecessary,
for they could easily agree to
take things more easily; theo
retically they could, but in prac
tice it is just as impossible for
them as it is for the Argus
pheasant to grow shorter wing
feathers."
Put simply, our society re
wards those people who ruin
themselves. As we rise higher
on the socio-economic scale, our

material desires increase, we be
come more anxious, with less
time for human pursuits. The
behavior demanded of us in al
most every occupation is fairly
rigidly prescribed, too, if we
plan to succeed.
Only An Escape
We suffer from alcoholism,
neuroses, divorce. Perhaps the
dramas of the sad suburbs are
not as popular now as before.
An escape has been found in
contemplating youth. But in
reality that contemplation is
only an escape unless we can
bring something of the freedom
we now enjoy into the roles
awaiting us in the "adult
world."
Our generation has failed be
fore. Look at all the radicals of
the thirties who now cry for or
der. Ronald Reagan himself led
a student strike when he was
in college. No kidding. But it's
not just political freedom that's
important. The freedom to love,
to care, can go the same route
as radicalism.
Look at the harried psychol
ogists. They try to patch up
their patients, to help them
make the best decisions in a
very less than perfect world.
About the best they can do is
to help us see reality and adjust
as the limits of our nature will
let us, if we want.
Make Society Adjust
But who is working to make
that society adjust to the hu
man needs of people, instead of
the other way around? Can it
be that we have all so forgotten
what it means to be human that
we cannot form limits past
which the desires for material
plushness should not go? Has
the Leviathan gotten so far out
of control that the only way to
find human peace is to go off
to Haight-Ashbury?
Hopefully not. Hopefully the

university, the citadel of knowl
edge, would be considering how
much pollution of the soul can
be tolerated, as it discussed pol
lution of the air.
But the role of the modern
scholar is itself a compromise
between the love of ideas and
a way to make a living in 20th
century space city. The search
for truth has become specialized,
the answers put aside for fur
ther research, the process be
comes a workaday task.
Perhaps, in this hiatus be
tween the new left and the new
torpor, we can find ways to ex
plore the question now. The an
swers may not reform society,
but at least it would give those
of us heading there a shred of
hope.
