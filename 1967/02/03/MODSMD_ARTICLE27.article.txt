## Intellectuals Thrive At Stern 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Probably because Stern Hall
must compete with the Fraterni
ties (but no vice versa, as in
the past), we at Stern have been
most concerned with the ques
tion Carl Mundt treated in his
provocative article on the mer
ger of social and academic life
in University living groups. To
set his article in broader per
spective may I comment on a
few of Mr. Mundt's assump
tions?
(a) It is not my experience as
a Stern resident that "there is
no general awareness on the
part of Stanford students" con
cerning residence education.
(b) Mr. Mundt says: "... a
living group, be it a house in
Stern Hall, Toyon Hall, a wom
en's residence or a fraternity,
all too often become a refuge
from intellectual life." Please
note:
Stern supports a Guest-in-
Residence Program (open, inci
dentally, to the entire campus).
Each House has five or more
faculty members as regular
guests—and at least as many
graduate associates. Four facul
ty members live in Stem Hall.
Classes are being taught in
Stern Hall. Plans are presently
being made for special seminars
to be residence-oriented.
The atmosphere at Stern has
been for me a bridge to the in
tellectual life on Quad; I think
many others would join me in
this opinion.
(c) Mr. Mundt's quotation
from the Amherst report was
most interesting. This quotation
suggested no fraternity could
provide various cultural advan
tages, which it then listed. I list
those advantages presently
available in this writer's house
(Holladay):
A completely furnished li
brary with a small but sufficient
stock of both academic and di
versionary titles. Stern Hall has
two suites for visitors' use avail
able to students and faculty.
Holladay has its own guest room
at the disposal of its Faculty
Resident.
Holladay has, in addition to
its lounge facilities for after
dinner coffee and conversation;
it has a very large room avail
able for any game activity short
of volleyball; the best upright
piano on campus; and access to
Stern Hall projectors and
screens and has facilities for
their use.
(d) Mr. Mundt further quotes
from the Amherst report a list
of cultural events (allegedly)
not supportable by a fraternity.
I list from the Holladay Social
Calendar those items duplicated
on his list:
Dramatic skit, a special show
ing of an imported Czech film,

and other entertainments. Hol
laday shares with Fremont
House 40 season tickets to the
Stanford Repertory Theater.
Holladay has six season tick
ets for the American Conserva
tory Theater; an evening cock
tail-anddinner party series in
the Faculty Resident's Apart
ment for invited faculty mem
bers; and is attending the d'Oy
ly Carte Gilbert & Sullivan com
pany at the Geary in S.F.
Interested people should cease
ignoring the realities—as well
as the potentialities — of Stern
Hall if they desire a clear per
spective. Any one interested in
finding a method "for making
living groups intellectual
groups as well" can not possi
bly ignore Stern Hall.

• Gratitude
Editor, The Dally:
We wish to express our
thanks to all those students
who contributed to the travel
costs of our trip to Washington
for the Mobilization of Clergy
and Laymen Concerned About
Vietnam. We are grateful for
having been allowed to share in
the excitement of the two-day
meeting, and are hopeful about
its implications in Washington
and throughout the country.
We feel that the Mobilization
represents a turning point in
the involvement of the churches
and synagogues with the moral
dilemma of Vietnam, and hope
to make a report to all interest
ed members of the Stanford
community in the near future.

Editor, The Daily:
I believe that Professor Shock
ley is right in pointing out that
the genetic development of a
people is dictated by the terms
of their survival conditions. To
cite a lack of genetic experi
ments, however, is to overlook
two important experiments in
this field.
The first involved the Negro
people. It was a lengthy experi
ment lasting several centuries;
controls were absolute and the
terms of survival were rigorous.
Slavery in this country provided
laborers in the field so that the
terms of survival depended
largely on the physical strength
of the slave.
The experiment included the
use of adversive stimuli to pro
duce desired behavior—not that
the overseer's whip was as ele
gant as the use of an electronic
device to administer shock in
measurable quantities, but it
was rigorous.
There were even special "lab

oratories" In which slaves
"learned" to be docile laborers.
Here, the variables were re
duced to a minimum and the
whole activity devoted to mak
ing clear the terms of survival.
This upset the normal curve of
genetic development since the
terms of survival were physical.
The other experiment in
volved the Jewish people. Dur
ing the Middle Ages, Jews were
denied access to the land and
were herded into city ghettos
from which they could emerge
only at the whim of their mas
ters. Since the main source of
income at that time was land,
it is obvious that the survival
terms dictated in this experi
ment involved using one's wits.
Only the smartest of the Jews
were able to devise effective sur
vival techniques. Since Chris
tians were restrained by reli
gion from lending money at in
terest, the Jewish people filled
an economic need for business
even as the Negro people filled
an economic need for physical
labor. The genetic results of
centuries of predetermined se
lection are hardly to be won
dered at.
As Harry Golden once re

marked: "First, they told us
that the Jew was too smart to
he accepted, and now they tell
us the Negro is too stupid."
My question is: When are we
going to remember our common
ancestry that makes us all part
of the human race?"

I believe that Professor Shock
ley is right in pointing out that
the genetic development of a
people is dictated by the terms
of their survival conditions. To
cite a lack of genetic experi
ments, however, is to overlook
two important experiments in
this field.
The first involved the Negro
people. It was a lengthy experi
ment lasting several centuries;
controls were absolute and the
terms of survival were rigorous.
Slavery in this country provided
laborers in the field so that the
terms of survival depended
largely on the physical strength
of the slave.
The experiment included the
use of adversive stimuli to pro
duce desired behavior—not that
the overseer's whip was as ele
gant as the use of an electronic
device to administer shock in
measurable quantities, but it
was rigorous.
There were even special "lab

oratories" In which slaves
"learned" to be docile laborers.
Here, the variables were re
duced to a minimum and the
whole activity devoted to mak
ing clear the terms of survival.
This upset the normal curve of
genetic development since the
terms of survival were physical.
The other experiment in
volved the Jewish people. Dur
ing the Middle Ages, Jews were
denied access to the land and
were herded into city ghettos
from which they could emerge
only at the whim of their mas
ters. Since the main source of
income at that time was land,
it is obvious that the survival
terms dictated in this experi
ment involved using one's wits.
Only the smartest of the Jews
were able to devise effective sur
vival techniques. Since Chris
tians were restrained by reli
gion from lending money at in
terest, the Jewish people filled
an economic need for business
even as the Negro people filled
an economic need for physical
labor. The genetic results of
centuries of predetermined se
lection are hardly to be won
dered at.
As Harry Golden once re

marked: "First, they told us
that the Jew was too smart to
he accepted, and now they tell
us the Negro is too stupid."
My question is: When are we
going to remember our common
ancestry that makes us all part
of the human race?"

Probably because Stern Hall
must compete with the Fraterni
ties (but no vice versa, as in
the past), we at Stern have been
most concerned with the ques
tion Carl Mundt treated in his
provocative article on the mer
ger of social and academic life
in University living groups. To
set his article in broader per
spective may I comment on a
few of Mr. Mundt's assump
tions?
(a) It is not my experience as
a Stern resident that "there is
no general awareness on the
part of Stanford students" con
cerning residence education.
(b) Mr. Mundt says: "... a
living group, be it a house in
Stern Hall, Toyon Hall, a wom
en's residence or a fraternity,
all too often become a refuge
from intellectual life." Please
note:
Stern supports a Guest-in-
Residence Program (open, inci
dentally, to the entire campus).
Each House has five or more
faculty members as regular
guests—and at least as many
graduate associates. Four facul
ty members live in Stem Hall.
Classes are being taught in
Stern Hall. Plans are presently
being made for special seminars
to be residence-oriented.
The atmosphere at Stern has
been for me a bridge to the in
tellectual life on Quad; I think
many others would join me in
this opinion.
(c) Mr. Mundt's quotation
from the Amherst report was
most interesting. This quotation
suggested no fraternity could
provide various cultural advan
tages, which it then listed. I list
those advantages presently
available in this writer's house
(Holladay):
A completely furnished li
brary with a small but sufficient
stock of both academic and di
versionary titles. Stern Hall has
two suites for visitors' use avail
able to students and faculty.
Holladay has its own guest room
at the disposal of its Faculty
Resident.
Holladay has, in addition to
its lounge facilities for after
dinner coffee and conversation;
it has a very large room avail
able for any game activity short
of volleyball; the best upright
piano on campus; and access to
Stern Hall projectors and
screens and has facilities for
their use.
(d) Mr. Mundt further quotes
from the Amherst report a list
of cultural events (allegedly)
not supportable by a fraternity.
I list from the Holladay Social
Calendar those items duplicated
on his list:
Dramatic skit, a special show
ing of an imported Czech film,

and other entertainments. Hol
laday shares with Fremont
House 40 season tickets to the
Stanford Repertory Theater.
Holladay has six season tick
ets for the American Conserva
tory Theater; an evening cock
tail-anddinner party series in
the Faculty Resident's Apart
ment for invited faculty mem
bers; and is attending the d'Oy
ly Carte Gilbert & Sullivan com
pany at the Geary in S.F.
Interested people should cease
ignoring the realities—as well
as the potentialities — of Stern
Hall if they desire a clear per
spective. Any one interested in
finding a method "for making
living groups intellectual
groups as well" can not possi
bly ignore Stern Hall.

Editor, The Dally:
We wish to express our
thanks to all those students
who contributed to the travel
costs of our trip to Washington
for the Mobilization of Clergy
and Laymen Concerned About
Vietnam. We are grateful for
having been allowed to share in
the excitement of the two-day
meeting, and are hopeful about
its implications in Washington
and throughout the country.
We feel that the Mobilization
represents a turning point in
the involvement of the churches
and synagogues with the moral
dilemma of Vietnam, and hope
to make a report to all interest
ed members of the Stanford
community in the near future.

(c) Mr. Mundt's quotation

suggested no fraternity could

A completely furnished li
brary with a small but sufficient
stock of both academic and di
versionary titles. Stern Hall has
two suites for visitors' use avail
able to students and faculty.
Holladay has its own guest room
at the disposal of its Faculty
Resident.
Holladay has, in addition to
its lounge facilities for after
dinner coffee and conversation;
it has a very large room avail
able for any game activity short
of volleyball; the best upright
piano on campus; and access to
Stern Hall projectors and
screens and has facilities for
their use.
(d) Mr. Mundt further quotes
from the Amherst report a list
of cultural events (allegedly)
not supportable by a fraternity.
I list from the Holladay Social
Calendar those items duplicated
on his list:
Dramatic skit, a special show
ing of an imported Czech film,

and other entertainments. Hol
laday shares with Fremont
House 40 season tickets to the
Stanford Repertory Theater.
Holladay has six season tick
ets for the American Conserva
tory Theater; an evening cock
tail-anddinner party series in
the Faculty Resident's Apart
ment for invited faculty mem

Interested people should cease

bly ignore Stern Hall.

Editor, The Dally:
We wish to express our
thanks to all those students
who contributed to the travel
costs of our trip to Washington
for the Mobilization of Clergy
and Laymen Concerned About
Vietnam. We are grateful for
having been allowed to share in
the excitement of the two-day
meeting, and are hopeful about
its implications in Washington
and throughout the country.
We feel that the Mobilization
represents a turning point in
the involvement of the churches
and synagogues with the moral
dilemma of Vietnam, and hope
to make a report to all interest
ed members of the Stanford
community in the near future.

I believe that Professor Shock
ley is right in pointing out that
the genetic development of a
people is dictated by the terms
of their survival conditions. To
cite a lack of genetic experi
ments, however, is to overlook
two important experiments in
this field.
The first involved the Negro
people. It was a lengthy experi
ment lasting several centuries;
controls were absolute and the
terms of survival were rigorous.
Slavery in this country provided
laborers in the field so that the
terms of survival depended
largely on the physical strength
of the slave.
The experiment included the
use of adversive stimuli to pro
duce desired behavior—not that
the overseer's whip was as ele
gant as the use of an electronic
device to administer shock in
measurable quantities, but it
was rigorous.
There were even special "lab

oratories" In which slaves
"learned" to be docile laborers.
Here, the variables were re
duced to a minimum and the
whole activity devoted to mak
ing clear the terms of survival.
This upset the normal curve of
genetic development since the
terms of survival were physical.
The other experiment in
volved the Jewish people. Dur
ing the Middle Ages, Jews were
denied access to the land and
were herded into city ghettos
from which they could emerge
only at the whim of their mas
ters. Since the main source of
income at that time was land,
it is obvious that the survival
terms dictated in this experi
ment involved using one's wits.
Only the smartest of the Jews
were able to devise effective sur
vival techniques. Since Chris
tians were restrained by reli
gion from lending money at in
terest, the Jewish people filled
an economic need for business
even as the Negro people filled
an economic need for physical
labor. The genetic results of
centuries of predetermined se
lection are hardly to be won
dered at.
As Harry Golden once re

marked: "First, they told us
that the Jew was too smart to
he accepted, and now they tell
us the Negro is too stupid."
My question is: When are we
going to remember our common
ancestry that makes us all part
of the human race?"

Probably because Stern Hall
must compete with the Fraterni
ties (but no vice versa, as in
the past), we at Stern have been
most concerned with the ques
tion Carl Mundt treated in his
provocative article on the mer
ger of social and academic life
in University living groups. To
set his article in broader per
spective may I comment on a
few of Mr. Mundt's assump
tions?
(a) It is not my experience as
a Stern resident that "there is
no general awareness on the
part of Stanford students" con
cerning residence education.
(b) Mr. Mundt says: "... a
living group, be it a house in
Stern Hall, Toyon Hall, a wom
en's residence or a fraternity,
all too often become a refuge
from intellectual life." Please
note:
Stern supports a Guest-in-
Residence Program (open, inci
dentally, to the entire campus).

faculty members as regular

This upset the normal curve of
genetic development since the
terms of survival were physical.
The other experiment in
volved the Jewish people. Dur
ing the Middle Ages, Jews were
denied access to the land and
were herded into city ghettos
from which they could emerge
only at the whim of their mas
ters. Since the main source of
income at that time was land,
it is obvious that the survival
terms dictated in this experi
ment involved using one's wits.
Only the smartest of the Jews
were able to devise effective sur
vival techniques. Since Chris
tians were restrained by reli
gion from lending money at in
terest, the Jewish people filled
an economic need for business
even as the Negro people filled
an economic need for physical
labor. The genetic results of
centuries of predetermined se
lection are hardly to be won
dered at.
As Harry Golden once re

marked: "First, they told us
that the Jew was too smart to
he accepted, and now they tell
us the Negro is too stupid."
My question is: When are we
going to remember our common
ancestry that makes us all part
of the human race?"

Probably because Stern Hall
must compete with the Fraterni
ties (but no vice versa, as in
the past), we at Stern have been
most concerned with the ques
tion Carl Mundt treated in his
provocative article on the mer
ger of social and academic life
in University living groups. To
set his article in broader per
spective may I comment on a
few of Mr. Mundt's assump
tions?
(a) It is not my experience as
a Stern resident that "there is
no general awareness on the
part of Stanford students" con
cerning residence education.
(b) Mr. Mundt says: "... a
living group, be it a house in
Stern Hall, Toyon Hall, a wom
en's residence or a fraternity,
all too often become a refuge
from intellectual life." Please
note:
Stern supports a Guest-in-
Residence Program (open, inci
dentally, to the entire campus).
Each House has five or more
faculty members as regular
guests—and at least as many
graduate associates. Four facul
ty members live in Stem Hall.
Classes are being taught in
Stern Hall. Plans are presently
being made for special seminars
to be residence-oriented.
The atmosphere at Stern has
been for me a bridge to the in
tellectual life on Quad; I think
many others would join me in
this opinion.
(c) Mr. Mundt's quotation
from the Amherst report was
most interesting. This quotation
suggested no fraternity could
provide various cultural advan
tages, which it then listed. I list
those advantages presently
available in this writer's house
(Holladay):
A completely furnished li
brary with a small but sufficient
stock of both academic and di
versionary titles. Stern Hall has
two suites for visitors' use avail
able to students and faculty.
Holladay has its own guest room
at the disposal of its Faculty
Resident.
Holladay has, in addition to
its lounge facilities for after
dinner coffee and conversation;
it has a very large room avail
able for any game activity short
of volleyball; the best upright
piano on campus; and access to
Stern Hall projectors and
screens and has facilities for
their use.
(d) Mr. Mundt further quotes
from the Amherst report a list
of cultural events (allegedly)
not supportable by a fraternity.
I list from the Holladay Social
Calendar those items duplicated
on his list:
Dramatic skit, a special show
ing of an imported Czech film,

and other entertainments. Hol
laday shares with Fremont
House 40 season tickets to the
Stanford Repertory Theater.
Holladay has six season tick
ets for the American Conserva
tory Theater; an evening cock
tail-anddinner party series in
the Faculty Resident's Apart
ment for invited faculty mem
bers; and is attending the d'Oy
ly Carte Gilbert & Sullivan com
pany at the Geary in S.F.
Interested people should cease
ignoring the realities—as well
as the potentialities — of Stern
Hall if they desire a clear per
spective. Any one interested in
finding a method "for making
living groups intellectual
groups as well" can not possi
bly ignore Stern Hall.

Editor, The Dally:
We wish to express our
thanks to all those students
who contributed to the travel
costs of our trip to Washington
for the Mobilization of Clergy
and Laymen Concerned About
Vietnam. We are grateful for
having been allowed to share in
the excitement of the two-day
meeting, and are hopeful about
its implications in Washington
and throughout the country.
We feel that the Mobilization
represents a turning point in
the involvement of the churches
and synagogues with the moral
dilemma of Vietnam, and hope
to make a report to all interest
ed members of the Stanford
community in the near future.

I believe that Professor Shock
ley is right in pointing out that
the genetic development of a
people is dictated by the terms
of their survival conditions. To
cite a lack of genetic experi
ments, however, is to overlook
two important experiments in
this field.
The first involved the Negro
people. It was a lengthy experi
ment lasting several centuries;
controls were absolute and the
terms of survival were rigorous.
Slavery in this country provided
laborers in the field so that the
terms of survival depended
largely on the physical strength
of the slave.
The experiment included the
use of adversive stimuli to pro
duce desired behavior—not that
the overseer's whip was as ele
gant as the use of an electronic
device to administer shock in
measurable quantities, but it
was rigorous.
There were even special "lab

oratories" In which slaves
"learned" to be docile laborers.
Here, the variables were re
duced to a minimum and the
whole activity devoted to mak
ing clear the terms of survival.
This upset the normal curve of
genetic development since the
terms of survival were physical.
The other experiment in
volved the Jewish people. Dur
