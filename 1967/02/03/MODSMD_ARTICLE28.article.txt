# Today And Tomorrow
## Negotiators Should Consider 'Guantanamo' Solution In Asia 
### Walter Lippmann 
There are reasons for think
ing that the Vietnam conflict
has come into a new phase
where new opportunities pre
sent themselves. There are new
indications that at least for a
time we need not be caught be
tween the old absolutes: to get
in or to get out, to flatten Hanoi
or to withdraw helter-skelter.
There are some signs that lucid
and skillful diplomacy could
now bring about a negotiated
settlement.
Much the most important
cause of this change in the situ
ation is the spreading disorder
inside mainland China. It is
bound to mean a reduction in
the material and the political in
fluence of Peking on Hanoi and
a corresponding increase in the
influence of the Soviet Union. It
means a reduction, also, in the
imminence and extent of the
Chinese threat to their neigh
bors.
Second to what is happening
in China, a long way second to
it, is the fact that the United
States has now established a
military position in South Viet
nam and Thailand which for the
foreseeable future is invulner
able.
Land Bound
Third, the counterrevolution
in Indonesia has made it quite
evident that Chinese military
power and revolutionary fervor
cannot be carried across the sea.
They are landlocked, so to
speak, in continental China.
These three developments
have created a new situation

and have opened up new oppor
tunities.
Nothing may come of it all.
Indeed, it is quite evident that
the favorable opportunities
could be erased suddenly. We
need only take the advice of
Barry Goldwater.
What is promising in the sit
uation could be destroyed in a
few hours. All that would need
to be done is to attack China
and blow up the Russian ships
at the same time. If we followed
the Goldwater policy and at
tacked thpm we could probably
remove Mao's internal troubles
on a nice bright morning.
Would Help Mao
An American bombing attack
on Chinese territory would do
more to rally the Chinese to
Mao than anything he could do.
If in addition, adopting the Gold
water advice, we closed Hai
phong Harbor and attacked So
viet ships we would make a
mighty contribution to healing
the angry quarrel between Pe
king and Moscow. In fact, no
one in the world knows so well
how to consolidate world com
munism, which has disintegra
ted dramatically, as does Barry
Goldwater.
The essential elements of the
new situation which present the
new opportunities are these. We
know from reliable reporters,
notably from Harrison Salis
bury, that within the Hanoi gov
ernment there is a mood to talk
about an end to the war without
demanding impossible prelimi
nary conditions.
Along with this is the fact,
which is becoming increasingly

clear, that the Viet Cong, who
are perhaps four-fifths of the
fighting force in the field against
us, are, though dependent on
Hanoi, increasingly determined
to follow an independent course.
This may make it possible for
the moderates in the constituent
assemblly in Saigon to negotiate
an agreement with the moder
ates in the Viet Cong and thus
bring the fighting to an end.
Two Vietnams
If things can be coaxed and
pushed along these lines, an
eventual settlement might take
the form of two provisionally
separate Vietnams. It is not im
possible to imagine that for a
term of years both Vietnams
would find it convenient to have
a continuing U.S. military pres
ence in some fortified enclave.
For while I, for one, think we
should never have committed
ourselves to a land war on the
Asian continent, we have done
just that and done it on a very
large scale. It will not be easy
to end our immense entangle
ment. And if the war is to be
ended by negotiating compro
mises, a Guantanamo arrange
ment might be one of them.

Second to what is happening
in China, a long way second to
it, is the fact that the United
States has now established a
military position in South Viet
nam and Thailand which for the
foreseeable future is invulner
able.
Land Bound
Third, the counterrevolution
in Indonesia has made it quite
evident that Chinese military
power and revolutionary fervor
cannot be carried across the sea.
They are landlocked, so to
speak, in continental China.
These three developments
have created a new situation

and have opened up new oppor
tunities.
Nothing may come of it all.
Indeed, it is quite evident that
the favorable opportunities
could be erased suddenly. We
need only take the advice of
Barry Goldwater.
What is promising in the sit
uation could be destroyed in a
few hours. All that would need
to be done is to attack China
and blow up the Russian ships
at the same time. If we followed
the Goldwater policy and at
tacked thpm we could probably
remove Mao's internal troubles
on a nice bright morning.
Would Help Mao
An American bombing attack
on Chinese territory would do
more to rally the Chinese to
Mao than anything he could do.
If in addition, adopting the Gold
water advice, we closed Hai
phong Harbor and attacked So
viet ships we would make a
mighty contribution to healing
the angry quarrel between Pe
king and Moscow. In fact, no
one in the world knows so well
how to consolidate world com
munism, which has disintegra
ted dramatically, as does Barry
Goldwater.
The essential elements of the
new situation which present the
new opportunities are these. We
know from reliable reporters,
notably from Harrison Salis
bury, that within the Hanoi gov
ernment there is a mood to talk
about an end to the war without
demanding impossible prelimi
nary conditions.
Along with this is the fact,
which is becoming increasingly

clear, that the Viet Cong, who
are perhaps four-fifths of the
fighting force in the field against
us, are, though dependent on
Hanoi, increasingly determined
to follow an independent course.
This may make it possible for
the moderates in the constituent
assemblly in Saigon to negotiate
an agreement with the moder
ates in the Viet Cong and thus
bring the fighting to an end.
Two Vietnams
If things can be coaxed and
pushed along these lines, an
eventual settlement might take
the form of two provisionally
separate Vietnams. It is not im
possible to imagine that for a
term of years both Vietnams
would find it convenient to have
a continuing U.S. military pres
ence in some fortified enclave.
For while I, for one, think we
should never have committed
ourselves to a land war on the
Asian continent, we have done
just that and done it on a very
large scale. It will not be easy
to end our immense entangle
ment. And if the war is to be
ended by negotiating compro
mises, a Guantanamo arrange
ment might be one of them.
There are reasons for think
ing that the Vietnam conflict
has come into a new phase
where new opportunities pre
sent themselves. There are new
indications that at least for a
time we need not be caught be
tween the old absolutes: to get
in or to get out, to flatten Hanoi
or to withdraw helter-skelter.
There are some signs that lucid
and skillful diplomacy could
now bring about a negotiated
settlement.
Much the most important
cause of this change in the situ
ation is the spreading disorder
inside mainland China. It is
bound to mean a reduction in
the material and the political in
fluence of Peking on Hanoi and
a corresponding increase in the
influence of the Soviet Union. It
means a reduction, also, in the
imminence and extent of the
Chinese threat to their neigh
