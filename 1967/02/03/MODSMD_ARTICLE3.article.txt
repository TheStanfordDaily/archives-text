tion and composition of the Packer

teen (Cl 5).
A motion to refer to Cl 5 the ques
tion of discrimination in University
admissions policy was made, but no
action was taken, due to lack of a
quorum.
A proposal for a by-laws change

In addition, Speaker Tom Forsten
zer appointed a committee to study
and draw up proposals for a "con
tinuing self-study of the student
body."
Forstenzer emphasized that this
study would be an attempt to "supple
ment and aid, but not to compete
with, the Packer Committee."
"The prime function of the ASSU
should be academic," Forstenzer
stated.
He added that the study would
probably be conducted by department
level committees with the help of the
faculty, administration, and outside
consultants.
He estimated that such a study
would cost at least $10,000 a year and
that the Legislature would have to
seek support from foundations.
Packer Issue
Concerning the Packer Committee
issue, Forstenzer reported that Pack
er had invited him to sit in on selec
tion interviews. He added that he
would do so but did not want to "pro
vide any unnecessary legitimacy."
Forstenzer suggested referral of
Packer Committee selection to the
Committee of Fifteen because that
committee "was established to deal
with issues that have not been re
solved."
Both ASSU President David Harris
and Forstenzer stated that they would
resign from the Committee if it did
not take up the Packer Committee is
sue.
Also, Dave Harris reported on his
Washington conference with Dean
Rusk and forty-one other student
body presidents.
