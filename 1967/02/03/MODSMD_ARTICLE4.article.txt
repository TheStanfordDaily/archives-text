lomatic manipulations do not repre
sent a hostile shift in Franco-Ameri
can relations, vice-counsel Charles
Crettien told a Stanford French
Week audience yesterday.
Crettien on assignment at the
French Consulate in San Francisco

an essential agreement for France."
He acknowledged France's withdrawal
of troops from NATO and the shift of
Allied Headquarters from French soil.
However, Crettien underlined
France's longstanding commitment to
the original 1919 mutual defense com
mitment which binds the NATO na
tions together. "France will remain
loyal to the spirit of the alliance," he
said.
Crettien denied that the exchange
gold reserves as "technical rather than
political" in nature. Current effort to
build up the French gold supply is
aimed at reestablishing the 1920 level,
he noted.
Crittien denied that the exchange
of American dollars, which has irri
tated this nation's gold flow, contained
any "hostility."
The wide ranging discussion of
French foreign policy outlined
France's triple orientation: the conti
nent, the West, and Africa.
Denying that French foreign policy
s directed against any nation, Cret
tien said France had an important role
to play in effecting entente with the
Soviet Union. He claimed the situa
tion in the far East favored France's
attempts at a detente.
Crettien optimistically outlined the
prospects for uniting Europe into a
single economic unit. In regard to
Great Britain, he told the audience,
"The Common Market is not a closed
club,"and the French government
would welcome a new partner.
