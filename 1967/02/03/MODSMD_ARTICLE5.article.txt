## Moliere's 'Don Juan' Acclaimed 
### CURTISS B. KECK 
Under the auspices of the Under
graduate Speech and Drama Depart
ment, brilliant acting and the imagi
native direction of Gerald Hiken com
bined to turn Moliere's rarely pro
duced "Don Juan" into the theatrical
bonanza of the season.
Playing to a small but enthusiastic
audience in the Nitery, Hiken and his
retinue of precocious young actors
triumphantly overcame the produc
tion's most forboding obstacle — Mo
liere's play.
The most acidic and least coherent
of Moliere's satires, "Don Juan" as a
play lacks all the ribaldry we have
come to associate with the title char
acter and is often too unreservedly

venomous to be good satire or engag
ing comedy.
Perhaps the most flagrant shortcom
ing of the play is Moliere's failure to
provide the incorrigible profligate, Don
Juan, with an intellectually competent
adversary. The underpinning of satire
and comedy lies in the audience's abi
lity to identify with corruption and
immorality and also with piety and
virtue. It is in the grey interlude be
tween these qualities that satire be
comes effective.
Heavy-Handed Satire
Here 'Don Juan" completely fails.
The audience is afforded only one
point of view, that of the degenerate
Don Juan. The good satirist must
maintain a detachment from his work.
He must not, as does Moliere, osten

sibly jump into the play and s"narl
out his own bitterness. Moliere's pro
fanation of the nobility, medicine, mar
riage, and seemingly every imaginable
virtue is too blunt and strikes home
more like a cudgel than a rapier.
Hence the satire and many of the
play's potentially comic scenes are
drown in the vitriol of Moliere's bit
terness.
All of this is not to say, however,
that the play is without its comic
moments. Hiken capitalized wonder
fully on several of Moliere's funny
scenes, such as Don Juan bamboozling
a creditor and his making protesta
tions of love simultaneously to a
couple of country maids.
Hiken goes a step further and
sprinkles humor and animation where

originally the play was lifeless. For
example: Don Juan's valet Sgnarelle
undresses his master, gives him a
massage which breaks out into a pul
meting of fists, and then wraps him
in a toga; also the hilarious scene
where Sgnarelle comes to the amorous
aid of Don Juan as he makes love at
the same time to the two country
lasses.
Although Director Hiken's inven
tiveness transfused adrenaline into the
hardened arteries of Moliere's play,
an abundance of exceptional acting
talent made his task all the more
easy.
Chris Wilson gave an outstanding
performance as the elegant and arro
gant Don Juan. The touchstone of
