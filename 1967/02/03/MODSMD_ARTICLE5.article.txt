# REVIEW
## Moliere's 'Don Juan' Acclaimed 
### CURTISS B. KECK 
Under the auspices of the Under
graduate Speech and Drama Depart
ment, brilliant acting and the imagi
native direction of Gerald Hiken com
bined to turn Moliere's rarely pro
duced "Don Juan" into the theatrical
bonanza of the season.
Playing to a small but enthusiastic
audience in the Nitery, Hiken and his
retinue of precocious young actors
triumphantly overcame the produc
tion's most forboding obstacle — Mo
liere's play.
The most acidic and least coherent
of Moliere's satires, "Don Juan" as a
play lacks all the ribaldry we have
come to associate with the title char
acter and is often too unreservedly

venomous to be good satire or engag
ing comedy.
Perhaps the most flagrant shortcom
ing of the play is Moliere's failure to
provide the incorrigible profligate, Don
Juan, with an intellectually competent
adversary. The underpinning of satire
and comedy lies in the audience's abi
lity to identify with corruption and
immorality and also with piety and
virtue. It is in the grey interlude be
tween these qualities that satire be
comes effective.
Heavy-Handed Satire
Here 'Don Juan" completely fails.
The audience is afforded only one
point of view, that of the degenerate
Don Juan. The good satirist must
maintain a detachment from his work.
He must not, as does Moliere, osten

sibly jump into the play and s"narl
out his own bitterness. Moliere's pro
fanation of the nobility, medicine, mar
riage, and seemingly every imaginable
virtue is too blunt and strikes home
more like a cudgel than a rapier.
Hence the satire and many of the
play's potentially comic scenes are
drown in the vitriol of Moliere's bit
terness.
All of this is not to say, however,
that the play is without its comic
moments. Hiken capitalized wonder
fully on several of Moliere's funny
scenes, such as Don Juan bamboozling
a creditor and his making protesta
tions of love simultaneously to a
couple of country maids.
Hiken goes a step further and
sprinkles humor and animation where

originally the play was lifeless. For
example: Don Juan's valet Sgnarelle
undresses his master, gives him a
massage which breaks out into a pul
meting of fists, and then wraps him
in a toga; also the hilarious scene
where Sgnarelle comes to the amorous
aid of Don Juan as he makes love at
the same time to the two country
lasses.
Although Director Hiken's inven
tiveness transfused adrenaline into the
hardened arteries of Moliere's play,
an abundance of exceptional acting
talent made his task all the more
easy.
Chris Wilson gave an outstanding
performance as the elegant and arro
gant Don Juan. The touchstone of
Wilson's acting prowess was his
ability to command the stage
at all times. Even while he was
a backstage spectator to the
main action, Wilson kept the
audience's attention with his fa
cial mimickry.
By way of Don Juan's capti
vating stage presence, the dis
tended monologues of his wife.
Donna Elvira, and of his father,
Don Louis, were taken as so
much sonorous background for
Don Juan's flouting pantomime.
The monologues could easily
have become painfully tedious;
however, Chris Wilson managed
in great comic style to divert the
audience's attention and show up
the speeches for their pomposity.
Simarly fortunate for the pro
duction, Wilson diluted the
strength of Moliere's venom by
playing Don Juan as gilb rather
than acidic and as degenerate
rather than rakish.
Always Comic
Larry Goldsmith as the vir
tuous and remonstrant Sgnarelle
contributed greatly to the suc
cess of the production. His deft
portrayal of Don Juan's con
science-stricken valet was always
comic and at times, uproarious.
His witless monologue of blith
ering logic was a highspot in the
evening.
Although his role was not as
taxing as those of Don Juan
and Signarelle, Dennis Johnson
handled the part of Don Carlos
with aplomb. Befitting the nobil
ity of his role, he displayed the
confidence in delivering his lines
and the effortless grace of a
stage veteran.
Little the less impressive were
William Clebsch as Pierrot and
Paul Schneider as Don Alonso.
Both turned in highly credible
performances. The remainder of
the cast, with special mention to
Vicki Davis, James Freeman,
and sexy Lindy Press, acted com
petently.
Nitery Helped
The Nitery, despite all its limi
tations, greatly enhanced the

production. Semi-circled around
the stage, the audience was
never more than a few yards
from the action. This proximity
of actor to audience created an
intimcy which can hardly fail
to preserve a lot of laughs that
might otherwise have been lost.
The lovely Jane House, fes
tooned with garlands from her
last quarter's role in Beaux
Stratagen," once more has
shown herself to be a highly
trained actress. Playing the part
of Donna Elvira, jilted wife of
the restless Don Juan, she per
fectly affected (hopefully) the
monotony basic to her self-right
ous and devout lamentations.
As did James Freeman playing
Don Juan's father, Miss House
kept her voice at a constant emo
tional pitch idled at a monotone.
In the production, it was better
that the audience did not notice
her pious words so much as the
mocking contempt with which
Don Juan countenced her.
Tsh, Tsh
Hiken should have moved
Charlotte and Mathurine closer
together in the secen where Don
Juan jaunts from one girl to the
other tweaking their vanities
and pinching their sublimities.
As the scene was, Don Juan's
two-faced machinations became
a little tiresome when he had
to pace the dozen yards from
one girl to the other.
The next to the closing scene
where Heaven rents its wrath
upon Don Juan is rather slow.
Chris Wilson took a finger-twid
dling time to finally die; al
though I believe he had to wait
for the light change to so ex
pire.
Warren Travis' costuming was
magnificently sumptuous. Mol
iere would have been pleased to
see the nobility he despised for
its pomposity, dressed so gaud
ily.

Chris Wilson took a finger-twid
dling time to finally die; al
though I believe he had to wait

see the nobility he despised for
its pomposity, dressed so gaud

Under the auspices of the Under
graduate Speech and Drama Depart
ment, brilliant acting and the imagi
native direction of Gerald Hiken com
bined to turn Moliere's rarely pro
duced "Don Juan" into the theatrical
bonanza of the season.
Playing to a small but enthusiastic
audience in the Nitery, Hiken and his
retinue of precocious young actors
triumphantly overcame the produc
tion's most forboding obstacle — Mo
liere's play.
The most acidic and least coherent
of Moliere's satires, "Don Juan" as a
play lacks all the ribaldry we have
come to associate with the title char
acter and is often too unreservedly

venomous to be good satire or engag
ing comedy.
Perhaps the most flagrant shortcom
ing of the play is Moliere's failure to
provide the incorrigible profligate, Don
Juan, with an intellectually competent
adversary. The underpinning of satire
and comedy lies in the audience's abi
lity to identify with corruption and
immorality and also with piety and
virtue. It is in the grey interlude be
tween these qualities that satire be
comes effective.
Heavy-Handed Satire
Here 'Don Juan" completely fails.
The audience is afforded only one
point of view, that of the degenerate
Don Juan. The good satirist must
maintain a detachment from his work.
He must not, as does Moliere, osten

sibly jump into the play and s"narl
out his own bitterness. Moliere's pro
fanation of the nobility, medicine, mar
riage, and seemingly every imaginable
virtue is too blunt and strikes home
more like a cudgel than a rapier.
Hence the satire and many of the
play's potentially comic scenes are
drown in the vitriol of Moliere's bit
terness.
All of this is not to say, however,
that the play is without its comic
moments. Hiken capitalized wonder
fully on several of Moliere's funny
scenes, such as Don Juan bamboozling
a creditor and his making protesta
tions of love simultaneously to a
couple of country maids.
Hiken goes a step further and
sprinkles humor and animation where

originally the play was lifeless. For
example: Don Juan's valet Sgnarelle
undresses his master, gives him a
massage which breaks out into a pul
meting of fists, and then wraps him
in a toga; also the hilarious scene
where Sgnarelle comes to the amorous
aid of Don Juan as he makes love at
the same time to the two country
lasses.
Although Director Hiken's inven
tiveness transfused adrenaline into the
hardened arteries of Moliere's play,
an abundance of exceptional acting
talent made his task all the more
easy.
Chris Wilson gave an outstanding
performance as the elegant and arro
gant Don Juan. The touchstone of
Wilson's acting prowess was his
ability to command the stage
at all times. Even while he was
a backstage spectator to the
main action, Wilson kept the
audience's attention with his fa
cial mimickry.
By way of Don Juan's capti
vating stage presence, the dis
tended monologues of his wife.
Donna Elvira, and of his father,
Don Louis, were taken as so
much sonorous background for
Don Juan's flouting pantomime.
The monologues could easily
have become painfully tedious;
however, Chris Wilson managed
in great comic style to divert the
audience's attention and show up
the speeches for their pomposity.
Simarly fortunate for the pro
duction, Wilson diluted the
strength of Moliere's venom by
playing Don Juan as gilb rather
than acidic and as degenerate
rather than rakish.
Always Comic
Larry Goldsmith as the vir
tuous and remonstrant Sgnarelle
contributed greatly to the suc
cess of the production. His deft
portrayal of Don Juan's con
science-stricken valet was always
comic and at times, uproarious.
His witless monologue of blith
ering logic was a highspot in the
evening.
Although his role was not as
taxing as those of Don Juan
and Signarelle, Dennis Johnson
handled the part of Don Carlos
with aplomb. Befitting the nobil
ity of his role, he displayed the
confidence in delivering his lines
and the effortless grace of a
stage veteran.
Little the less impressive were
William Clebsch as Pierrot and
Paul Schneider as Don Alonso.
Both turned in highly credible
performances. The remainder of
the cast, with special mention to
Vicki Davis, James Freeman,
and sexy Lindy Press, acted com
petently.
Nitery Helped
The Nitery, despite all its limi
tations, greatly enhanced the

production. Semi-circled around
the stage, the audience was
never more than a few yards
from the action. This proximity
of actor to audience created an
intimcy which can hardly fail
to preserve a lot of laughs that
might otherwise have been lost.
The lovely Jane House, fes
tooned with garlands from her
last quarter's role in Beaux
Stratagen," once more has
shown herself to be a highly
trained actress. Playing the part
of Donna Elvira, jilted wife of
the restless Don Juan, she per
fectly affected (hopefully) the
monotony basic to her self-right
ous and devout lamentations.
As did James Freeman playing
Don Juan's father, Miss House
kept her voice at a constant emo
tional pitch idled at a monotone.
In the production, it was better
that the audience did not notice
her pious words so much as the
mocking contempt with which
Don Juan countenced her.
Tsh, Tsh
Hiken should have moved
Charlotte and Mathurine closer
together in the secen where Don
Juan jaunts from one girl to the
other tweaking their vanities
and pinching their sublimities.
As the scene was, Don Juan's
two-faced machinations became
a little tiresome when he had
to pace the dozen yards from
one girl to the other.
The next to the closing scene
where Heaven rents its wrath
upon Don Juan is rather slow.
Chris Wilson took a finger-twid
dling time to finally die; al
though I believe he had to wait
for the light change to so ex

audience's attention with his fa
cial mimickry.
By way of Don Juan's capti
vating stage presence, the dis
tended monologues of his wife.
Donna Elvira, and of his father,
Don Louis, were taken as so
much sonorous background for
Don Juan's flouting pantomime.
The monologues could easily
have become painfully tedious;
however, Chris Wilson managed
in great comic style to divert the
audience's attention and show up
the speeches for their pomposity.
Simarly fortunate for the pro
duction, Wilson diluted the
strength of Moliere's venom by
playing Don Juan as gilb rather
than acidic and as degenerate
rather than rakish.
Always Comic
Larry Goldsmith as the vir
tuous and remonstrant Sgnarelle
contributed greatly to the suc
cess of the production. His deft
portrayal of Don Juan's con
science-stricken valet was always
comic and at times, uproarious.
His witless monologue of blith
ering logic was a highspot in the
evening.
Although his role was not as
taxing as those of Don Juan
and Signarelle, Dennis Johnson
handled the part of Don Carlos
with aplomb. Befitting the nobil
ity of his role, he displayed the
confidence in delivering his lines
and the effortless grace of a
stage veteran.
Little the less impressive were
William Clebsch as Pierrot and
Paul Schneider as Don Alonso.
Both turned in highly credible
performances. The remainder of
the cast, with special mention to
Vicki Davis, James Freeman,
and sexy Lindy Press, acted com
petently.
Nitery Helped
The Nitery, despite all its limi
tations, greatly enhanced the

production. Semi-circled around
the stage, the audience was
never more than a few yards
from the action. This proximity
of actor to audience created an
intimcy which can hardly fail
to preserve a lot of laughs that
might otherwise have been lost.
The lovely Jane House, fes
tooned with garlands from her
last quarter's role in Beaux
Stratagen," once more has
shown herself to be a highly
trained actress. Playing the part
of Donna Elvira, jilted wife of
the restless Don Juan, she per
fectly affected (hopefully) the
monotony basic to her self-right
ous and devout lamentations.
As did James Freeman playing
Don Juan's father, Miss House
kept her voice at a constant emo
tional pitch idled at a monotone.
In the production, it was better
that the audience did not notice
her pious words so much as the
mocking contempt with which
Don Juan countenced her.
Tsh, Tsh
Hiken should have moved
Charlotte and Mathurine closer
together in the secen where Don
Juan jaunts from one girl to the
other tweaking their vanities
and pinching their sublimities.
As the scene was, Don Juan's
two-faced machinations became
a little tiresome when he had
to pace the dozen yards from
one girl to the other.
The next to the closing scene
where Heaven rents its wrath
upon Don Juan is rather slow.
Chris Wilson took a finger-twid
dling time to finally die; al
though I believe he had to wait
for the light change to so ex
pire.
Warren Travis' costuming was
magnificently sumptuous. Mol
iere would have been pleased to
see the nobility he despised for
its pomposity, dressed so gaud

Under the auspices of the Under
graduate Speech and Drama Depart
ment, brilliant acting and the imagi
native direction of Gerald Hiken com
bined to turn Moliere's rarely pro
duced "Don Juan" into the theatrical
bonanza of the season.
Playing to a small but enthusiastic
audience in the Nitery, Hiken and his
retinue of precocious young actors
triumphantly overcame the produc
tion's most forboding obstacle — Mo
liere's play.
The most acidic and least coherent
of Moliere's satires, "Don Juan" as a
play lacks all the ribaldry we have
come to associate with the title char
acter and is often too unreservedly

venomous to be good satire or engag
ing comedy.
Perhaps the most flagrant shortcom
ing of the play is Moliere's failure to
provide the incorrigible profligate, Don
Juan, with an intellectually competent
adversary. The underpinning of satire
and comedy lies in the audience's abi
lity to identify with corruption and
immorality and also with piety and
virtue. It is in the grey interlude be
tween these qualities that satire be
comes effective.
Heavy-Handed Satire
Here 'Don Juan" completely fails.
The audience is afforded only one
point of view, that of the degenerate
Don Juan. The good satirist must
maintain a detachment from his work.
He must not, as does Moliere, osten

sibly jump into the play and s"narl
out his own bitterness. Moliere's pro
fanation of the nobility, medicine, mar
riage, and seemingly every imaginable
virtue is too blunt and strikes home
more like a cudgel than a rapier.
Hence the satire and many of the
play's potentially comic scenes are
drown in the vitriol of Moliere's bit
terness.
All of this is not to say, however,
that the play is without its comic
moments. Hiken capitalized wonder
fully on several of Moliere's funny
scenes, such as Don Juan bamboozling
a creditor and his making protesta
tions of love simultaneously to a
couple of country maids.
Hiken goes a step further and
sprinkles humor and animation where

originally the play was lifeless. For
example: Don Juan's valet Sgnarelle
undresses his master, gives him a
massage which breaks out into a pul
meting of fists, and then wraps him
in a toga; also the hilarious scene
where Sgnarelle comes to the amorous
aid of Don Juan as he makes love at
the same time to the two country
lasses.
Although Director Hiken's inven
tiveness transfused adrenaline into the
hardened arteries of Moliere's play,
an abundance of exceptional acting
talent made his task all the more
easy.
Chris Wilson gave an outstanding
performance as the elegant and arro
gant Don Juan. The touchstone of
Wilson's acting prowess was his
ability to command the stage
at all times. Even while he was
a backstage spectator to the
main action, Wilson kept the

Under the auspices of the Under
graduate Speech and Drama Depart
ment, brilliant acting and the imagi
native direction of Gerald Hiken com
bined to turn Moliere's rarely pro
duced "Don Juan" into the theatrical
bonanza of the season.
Playing to a small but enthusiastic
audience in the Nitery, Hiken and his
retinue of precocious young actors
triumphantly overcame the produc
tion's most forboding obstacle — Mo
liere's play.
The most acidic and least coherent
of Moliere's satires, "Don Juan" as a
play lacks all the ribaldry we have
come to associate with the title char
acter and is often too unreservedly

venomous to be good satire or engag
ing comedy.
Perhaps the most flagrant shortcom
ing of the play is Moliere's failure to
provide the incorrigible profligate, Don
Juan, with an intellectually competent
adversary. The underpinning of satire
and comedy lies in the audience's abi
lity to identify with corruption and
immorality and also with piety and
virtue. It is in the grey interlude be
tween these qualities that satire be
comes effective.
Heavy-Handed Satire
Here 'Don Juan" completely fails.
The audience is afforded only one
point of view, that of the degenerate
Don Juan. The good satirist must
maintain a detachment from his work.
He must not, as does Moliere, osten

sibly jump into the play and s"narl
out his own bitterness. Moliere's pro
fanation of the nobility, medicine, mar
riage, and seemingly every imaginable
virtue is too blunt and strikes home
more like a cudgel than a rapier.
Hence the satire and many of the
play's potentially comic scenes are
drown in the vitriol of Moliere's bit
terness.
All of this is not to say, however,
that the play is without its comic
moments. Hiken capitalized wonder
fully on several of Moliere's funny
scenes, such as Don Juan bamboozling
a creditor and his making protesta
tions of love simultaneously to a
couple of country maids.
Hiken goes a step further and
sprinkles humor and animation where

originally the play was lifeless. For
example: Don Juan's valet Sgnarelle
undresses his master, gives him a
massage which breaks out into a pul
meting of fists, and then wraps him
in a toga; also the hilarious scene
where Sgnarelle comes to the amorous
aid of Don Juan as he makes love at
the same time to the two country
lasses.
Although Director Hiken's inven
tiveness transfused adrenaline into the
hardened arteries of Moliere's play,
an abundance of exceptional acting
talent made his task all the more
easy.
Chris Wilson gave an outstanding
performance as the elegant and arro
gant Don Juan. The touchstone of
Wilson's acting prowess was his
ability to command the stage
at all times. Even while he was
a backstage spectator to the
main action, Wilson kept the
audience's attention with his fa
cial mimickry.
By way of Don Juan's capti
vating stage presence, the dis
tended monologues of his wife.
Donna Elvira, and of his father,
Don Louis, were taken as so
much sonorous background for
Don Juan's flouting pantomime.
The monologues could easily
have become painfully tedious;
however, Chris Wilson managed
in great comic style to divert the
audience's attention and show up
the speeches for their pomposity.
Simarly fortunate for the pro
duction, Wilson diluted the
strength of Moliere's venom by
playing Don Juan as gilb rather
than acidic and as degenerate
rather than rakish.
Always Comic
Larry Goldsmith as the vir
tuous and remonstrant Sgnarelle
contributed greatly to the suc
cess of the production. His deft
portrayal of Don Juan's con
science-stricken valet was always
comic and at times, uproarious.
His witless monologue of blith
ering logic was a highspot in the
evening.
Although his role was not as
taxing as those of Don Juan
and Signarelle, Dennis Johnson
handled the part of Don Carlos
with aplomb. Befitting the nobil
ity of his role, he displayed the
confidence in delivering his lines
and the effortless grace of a
stage veteran.
Little the less impressive were
William Clebsch as Pierrot and
Paul Schneider as Don Alonso.
Both turned in highly credible
performances. The remainder of
the cast, with special mention to
Vicki Davis, James Freeman,
and sexy Lindy Press, acted com
petently.
Nitery Helped
The Nitery, despite all its limi
tations, greatly enhanced the

production. Semi-circled around
the stage, the audience was
never more than a few yards
from the action. This proximity
of actor to audience created an
intimcy which can hardly fail
to preserve a lot of laughs that
might otherwise have been lost.
The lovely Jane House, fes
tooned with garlands from her
last quarter's role in Beaux
Stratagen," once more has
shown herself to be a highly
trained actress. Playing the part
of Donna Elvira, jilted wife of
the restless Don Juan, she per
fectly affected (hopefully) the
monotony basic to her self-right
ous and devout lamentations.
As did James Freeman playing
Don Juan's father, Miss House
kept her voice at a constant emo
tional pitch idled at a monotone.
In the production, it was better
that the audience did not notice
her pious words so much as the
mocking contempt with which
Don Juan countenced her.
