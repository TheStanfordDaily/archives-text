# Brown, Novak, Harris Return From Washington

### SANDY SHAPIRO Associate Editor 
"Sometimes the impact of the Viet
nam war on the student is described
as a 'Who am I?' identity crisis. But
now it has become a 'Who are we?'
question.
"The emphasis has moved from pri
vate to social ethics; they cannot be
completely separated," continued Mi
chael Novak at an informal press con
ference held yesterday with Robert
McAfee Brown and Dave Harris.
Brown and Novak have just re
turned from Washington, D.C., where
they joined 2,000 clergymen of all
faiths in a Vietnam protest. Harris was
also in the nation's capital earlier this
this week to participate in a confer
ence of college student body presidents
with Secretary of State Dean Rusk.
Moral Dilemma
All three explained that they have
talked to a large cross-section of stu
dents who "bring up the question of
what to do—the moral dilemma of the
war." In a paper prepared by the Exec
utive Committee of Clergy and Lay
men Concerned about Vietnam and
distributed in Washington, the prob
lem of advising students was dis
cussed:
"A time comes when silence is a
betrayal . . . Many of us are called
upon to counsel young men of draft
age who in conscience question our
presence in Vietnam . . . How can we
counsel them to participate in such a
war as this? When they decide that
they cannot condone the war by their
personal involvement, we must sup
port them in that decision."
Brown explained that the part of the
statement quoted above was a re
sponse to the letter drafted by the stu
dent body presidents to protest the
war. At the recent meeting another 100
signatures were added to this letter.
Hope for Change
"This movement is distinguished
from the Beatnik craze of ten years
ago because it's no longer centered
on an individual search," Novak
stated. "I think there's a greater
sense of hope involved here. Beatniks
opted out —today's youth have more
hope that they can affect change.
They have a greater feeling of power
and establish a different set of values
for themselves."
Harris continued, "Now, whether
it's the issue of civil rights, education
al improvements, or the war, students
take a position outside society and

confront the majority. It's a new con
cern with what's right—not just in
politics.
"You can't talk about building a
better university when one of the
basic educational freedoms—whether
or not you're going to be in school—
is non-existent."
Civil Rights
When asked if the civil rights move
ment had lost strength as a result
of Vietnam, Harris replied: "The na
ture of the civil rights movement has
changed since 1963. The Vietnam war
has had some effect on this—many of
the people who were previously in
volved with civil rights have shifted
areas.
"It used to be a clearcut issue of
how you felt about your fellowman
and if you were willing to act to sup
port your stand," Harris explained.
"Now it's a question of how one shuf
fles and reorders society."
Brown noted that "the civil rights
movement allowed one to ignore Viet
nam. Civil rights was a clear prob
lem; the war is ambiguous. It's now
become impossible to avoid—the im
mensity of this issue won't allow it to
be pushed aside."
Brown was asked if he felt that
Vietnam would result in a growth of

life time pacifism. "Vietnam is forcing
the option of pacifism as a long-iun
thing. War will not become less am
biguous, but more so. A decision now
will not be temporary; it will con
tinue to affect a man's judgment."
Novak felt that current opposition
to the war was more selective. "Many
students I talk to wouldn't heistate to
fight if this were World War II." Har
ris replied. "Decisions of pacifism
must be based on our current expos
ure to war.
"Some adopt a pacifist stand be
cause of the nature of military or
ganization. Human spontaniety and
examination are constantly sup
pressed—a destruction of what it
means to be a human being, regard
less of the war Issue," Harris con
cluded.
Vietnam And Drugs
The possible connection between
Vietnam opposition and drug use was
raised. Novak commented: "We have
a tendency to see everything in
instrumental terms. Students work in
high school to get into college; in
college it's graduate school. Society
has become so highly organized that
we lose track of individuals. Drugs
are a means of freeing oneself from
instrumental terms.
