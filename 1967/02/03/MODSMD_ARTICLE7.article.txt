### MAGGIE McCOMAS 
Thirty-five student body presidents
of U.S. universities left the office of
Secretary of State Dean Rusk Wed
nesday with many unanswered ques
tions and a pessimistic outlook for
hopes of a peace settlement in Viet
nam, said David Harris.
ASSU president David Harris was
among the group of 42 (seven of them
were observers) who spent two hours
in a closed conference with Rusk. The
conference came as a result of a let
ter of protest to the war signed by 100
student body presidents late last year.
"Most in group were moderates,"
Harris said. "In fact one person had
signed a petition in support of the war
a year or so ago. He added that most
of them left even more opposed to the
war than before, "except for myself,
and that's only because I've reached
the saturation point."

Harris said that the group's primary
query concerned how much the U.S.
was willing to sacrifice in order to ob
tain negotiations and a peace settle
ment.
Rusk apparently successfully avoid
ed answering the question of U.S. sup
port of the South Vietnamese govern
ment, placing the blame on Commu
nist aggression from the North and
centering the problems of the war in
Hanoi.
Harris indicated that Rusk either
"didn't understand the questions we
were asking" or was "awfully slip
pery" in evading the group's ques
tions.
Harris said that the group left with
the impression that the primary con
cern of U.S. involvement was based
on military strategy rather than on
long range political aims or concern
for peace settlements.
