# Transcript Requests Go Unfilled
## 
### STEVE GRUBER 
"Where's my transcript?" I asked
you to send it before Christmas."
Mary Nelson and Jeanne East, the
University's transcript secretaries
fielded this question many times yes
terday. They expect many more of
the same questions because they are
two weeks behind in sending the
transcripts.
"It happens every year," Miss Nel
son explained. "We are sending 200
transcripts per day now and we sent
out 4000 during January."
The transcript delays start every
January, according to Miss Nelson. A
large proportion apply to graduate
schools and all of the transcript re
quests come at the same time.
December Freeze
Even though some of the requests
came during the last weeks of De
cember, they cannot be processed un
til the grades for fall quarter are en
tered. The result of this is to freeze
all requests from the last days of fi
nals to the first week of January.
The Registrar's office has a master
grade sheet for each student which is
used to make copies. Until the copy is
stamped with the University seal and
signed by either the Registrar or the
Recorder, it is not an official tran
script.
Anyone requesting a transcript
must either send a letter to the Regis
trar or come to the Registrar's infor
mation office on Quad and request it
in person, according to Miss Nelson.
Unless the student personally asks
that a transcript be sent, he will not
get it.

But there is one exception to this
usually rigid rule.
If an FBI agent wants to see a tran
script he can do so without the stu
dent's permission. The agent only
needs to present his identification —
he does not need to show cause for
examining the records.
Civil Service investigators, Naval
Intelligence employees, and agents
from other certified government agen
cies are allowed the same privilege.
The student will not be told that his
record has been checked.
Internal Information
On the back of each transcript mas
ter copy is additional information
about the student, including honors
awards, student activities, advanced
standing, petitions, and academic
standing.
According to Registrar Harvey Hall,
this information is "for internal use
only" and will not be released to any
one outside the Registrar's office.
The back of the transcript will in
dicate if a student has been suspend
ed or put on academic probation. This
information will not be recorded on
the front of the transcript. Hall said
that University policy was to let the
student's record speak for itself.
Many universities include this on
the official transcript, Hall said, but
Stanford feels that it would bias the
student's chances of acceptance for
graduate schools and employment.
Friends Cause Delay
Mrs. Dorothy Wood, the University
Recorder, said that many transcripts
are held up unnecessarily because
students do not ask for them per

sonally. Having a friend ask for a
transcript causes delays while the re
quest is verified, according to Mrs.
Wood.
Students who come in and ask if
their transcripts have been sent out
only delay the process, according to
Miss Nelson. "I realize that they sure
anxious to have them sent, but it does
take a lot of our time to chase down
the transcript," she said.
The other transcript secretary,
Jeanne East, commented that one
student has called everyday for the
last two weeks to check the progress
of his transcript. "And every time he
calls, he promises to call again the
next day," she added.
Miss Nelson said that students will
receive their transcripts quicker if
they come to the Registrar's Office in
person to make the request instead of
writing a letter. The secretaries are
not allowed to take requests by tele
phone, she added.

Friends Cause Delay
Mrs. Dorothy Wood, the University
Recorder, said that many transcripts
are held up unnecessarily because
students do not ask for them per

sonally. Having a friend ask for a
transcript causes delays while the re
quest is verified, according to Mrs.
Wood.
Students who come in and ask if
their transcripts have been sent out
only delay the process, according to
Miss Nelson. "I realize that they sure
anxious to have them sent, but it does
take a lot of our time to chase down
the transcript," she said.
The other transcript secretary,
Jeanne East, commented that one
student has called everyday for the
last two weeks to check the progress
of his transcript. "And every time he
calls, he promises to call again the
next day," she added.
Miss Nelson said that students will
receive their transcripts quicker if
they come to the Registrar's Office in
person to make the request instead of
writing a letter. The secretaries are
not allowed to take requests by tele
phone, she added.
"Where's my transcript?" I asked
you to send it before Christmas."
Mary Nelson and Jeanne East, the
University's transcript secretaries
fielded this question many times yes
terday. They expect many more of
the same questions because they are
two weeks behind in sending the
transcripts.
"It happens every year," Miss Nel
son explained. "We are sending 200
transcripts per day now and we sent
out 4000 during January."
The transcript delays start every
January, according to Miss Nelson. A
large proportion apply to graduate
schools and all of the transcript re
quests come at the same time.
December Freeze
Even though some of the requests
came during the last weeks of De
cember, they cannot be processed un
til the grades for fall quarter are en
tered. The result of this is to freeze
all requests from the last days of fi
nals to the first week of January.
The Registrar's office has a master
grade sheet for each student which is
used to make copies. Until the copy is
stamped with the University seal and
signed by either the Registrar or the
Recorder, it is not an official tran
script.
Anyone requesting a transcript
must either send a letter to the Regis
trar or come to the Registrar's infor
mation office on Quad and request it
in person, according to Miss Nelson.
Unless the student personally asks
that a transcript be sent, he will not
get it.

But there is one exception to this
usually rigid rule.
If an FBI agent wants to see a tran
script he can do so without the stu
dent's permission. The agent only
needs to present his identification —
he does not need to show cause for
examining the records.
Civil Service investigators, Naval
Intelligence employees, and agents
from other certified government agen
cies are allowed the same privilege.
The student will not be told that his
record has been checked.
Internal Information
On the back of each transcript mas
ter copy is additional information
about the student, including honors
awards, student activities, advanced
standing, petitions, and academic
standing.
According to Registrar Harvey Hall,
this information is "for internal use
only" and will not be released to any
one outside the Registrar's office.
The back of the transcript will in
dicate if a student has been suspend
ed or put on academic probation. This
information will not be recorded on
the front of the transcript. Hall said
that University policy was to let the
student's record speak for itself.
Many universities include this on
the official transcript, Hall said, but
Stanford feels that it would bias the
student's chances of acceptance for
graduate schools and employment.
