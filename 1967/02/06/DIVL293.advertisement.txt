Youth isn't wasted on the young. And the young don't
waste their time at Celanese.
Our top people are never old-fashioned about any new
idea, whether it conies l'rom middle management or
from our youngest college grad. We have a master plan
and the vitality to make it work. Marketing is way-out
and zeroed right in. Finance knows that we have better
things to do with our money than let it grow barnacles...
shelled out $4G5 million in capital expenditures
over the last 3 years. In the scientific department, we
combine technical insight with an unusual grasp of
marketing dynamics.
Thinking young explains how we chalked-up one of the
most impressive corporate rebuilding jobs in recent
history. How we turned what was basically a one-product
business into a solid and diverse international corporation
dealing in chemicals, miracle fibers, plastics, paints,
petroleum and forest products. How we multiplied sales
5 fold in 10 years. How we now have 100 plants in the
U.S.. Canada, Latin America, Europe, Africa and Asia.
Possibly we could afford to relax arlittle. But success
makes young blood run even faster.
Which means that the ambitious college grad couldn't
find a more provocative opportunity anywhere else in
American industry.
