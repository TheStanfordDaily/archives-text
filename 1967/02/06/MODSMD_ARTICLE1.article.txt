# Greek Week Aims At Serving Community
## Helen Of Quad? 
### MIRE MORTON 
Once again the campus will come
alive to the exploits of Hellenic he
roes. At noon today, Argive entre
peurs inaugurate a semi-fortnight of
saturnalia, the traditional beginning
of Rush-Greek Week.
However, this year there will be a
change. Tim McCarthy, chairman and
general supervisory mastermind of
the program, explained to The Daily
the modification in the philosophy of
Greek Week. He said that the pri
mary aim is now to expand the Week
from its original role of a period of
fraternity-oriented fun and games to
a time relevant to the entire Univer
sity community and during which
genuine service can be performed.
Chariot Races
Activities begin today at noon with
the annual Chariot Races around
White Plaza. The local populous will
flock to gaze in rapt amazement as
two stalwart sons from each fraterni
ty combine to seek boundless honor

and glory by racing about the course
a chariot bearing their duly-elected
House Queen.
Tomorrow the glorifying aspect of
Greek Week will be carried further
with a luncheon for the officers of
each house, and specifically for honor
ing of the House Queens.
New Look
On Wednesday, the organizers of
the Week bring their "new look" to
the fore. Members of the fraternity
community will join in a public ser
vice project: a mass tree-planting in
tended to beautify the grounds around
the Undergraduate Library.
With the innovation of Career
Night on Thursday, the new philoso
phy of the Week will appear at its
novel best. Headed by Tom Shanahan
of Kappa Sigma Alpha, the new proj
ect is the first real attempt on the
part of those associated with Greek
Week to provide a service with actual
attraction for and relevance to each
member of the University commu
nity.

Each fraternity will sponsor a ca
reer, making a total of 21 profes
sions represented. Professional men
from the local area, many of them
Stanford alumni, will eat dinner at
the various houses and afterwards
participate in discussions open to all
who may be interested.
According to the organizers of this
program, the hope here is for well
attended discussions that will go
somewnat deeper than the traditional
student concerns of "what courses do
I have to take" and "how much mon
ey can I expect to make?"
Tradition will once again dominate
on Friday as the annual Queen's
Games are held. The location is as yet
undetermined, but the purpose re
mains as fixed as it has been since
its initiation. The Games are a fun
fest-free-for-all consisting of activities
from three-legged races to chugging
contests to everything between and
beyond. All are invited to participate

in and add to the merry-making in
whatever way they may see fit.
Point Competition
The Queen's Games are the second
phase in the point-competition-be
tween-fraternities aspect of Greek
Week (the Chariot Races being the
first). In years past these two events
have been the backbone of the com
petition with attendance at the IFC
Ball used as a third criteria.
However, in line with this year's
Greek Week emphasis shift, the com
petition will be expanded. Included
now in the point sources wil be aver
age house grade point averages over
the last three quarter period, and
most improved house GPA's from the
previous three quarter period.
Greek Week will conclude Friday
evening with the annual Inter-Fra
ternity Council Ball. The Ball will
feaure a variety of entertainment for
the frat community, and during the
course of the evening winners of the
Week's competition will be an
nounced and honored.

thousand chariots, and sent scores of
Stanford men charging half-crazed
around White Plaza? See this ever
thrilling scene re-enacted today at

Night on Thursday, the new philoso
phy of the Week will appear at its
novel best. Headed by Tom Shanahan
of Kappa Sigma Alpha, the new proj
ect is the first real attempt on the
part of those associated with Greek
Week to provide a service with actual
attraction for and relevance to each
member of the University commu
nity.

Each fraternity will sponsor a ca
reer, making a total of 21 profes
sions represented. Professional men
from the local area, many of them
Stanford alumni, will eat dinner at
the various houses and afterwards
participate in discussions open to all
who may be interested.
According to the organizers of this
program, the hope here is for well
attended discussions that will go
somewnat deeper than the traditional
student concerns of "what courses do
I have to take" and "how much mon
ey can I expect to make?"
Tradition will once again dominate
on Friday as the annual Queen's
Games are held. The location is as yet
undetermined, but the purpose re
mains as fixed as it has been since
its initiation. The Games are a fun
fest-free-for-all consisting of activities
from three-legged races to chugging
contests to everything between and
beyond. All are invited to participate

in and add to the merry-making in
whatever way they may see fit.
Point Competition
The Queen's Games are the second
phase in the point-competition-be
tween-fraternities aspect of Greek
Week (the Chariot Races being the
first). In years past these two events
have been the backbone of the com
petition with attendance at the IFC
Ball used as a third criteria.
However, in line with this year's
Greek Week emphasis shift, the com
petition will be expanded. Included
now in the point sources wil be aver
age house grade point averages over
the last three quarter period, and
most improved house GPA's from the
previous three quarter period.
Greek Week will conclude Friday
evening with the annual Inter-Fra
ternity Council Ball. The Ball will
feaure a variety of entertainment for
the frat community, and during the
course of the evening winners of the
Week's competition will be an
nounced and honored.

thousand chariots, and sent scores of
Stanford men charging half-crazed
around White Plaza? See this ever
thrilling scene re-enacted today at
noon as the Chariot Races kick off
annual Greek Week.
Once again the campus will come
alive to the exploits of Hellenic he
roes. At noon today, Argive entre
peurs inaugurate a semi-fortnight of
saturnalia, the traditional beginning
of Rush-Greek Week.
However, this year there will be a
change. Tim McCarthy, chairman and
general supervisory mastermind of
the program, explained to The Daily
the modification in the philosophy of
Greek Week. He said that the pri
mary aim is now to expand the Week
from its original role of a period of
fraternity-oriented fun and games to
a time relevant to the entire Univer
sity community and during which
genuine service can be performed.
Chariot Races
Activities begin today at noon with
the annual Chariot Races around
White Plaza. The local populous will
flock to gaze in rapt amazement as
two stalwart sons from each fraterni
ty combine to seek boundless honor

and glory by racing about the course
a chariot bearing their duly-elected
House Queen.
Tomorrow the glorifying aspect of
Greek Week will be carried further
with a luncheon for the officers of
