# Tribe Point Binge Salts Falcon Tails
## What's So Funny? 
### BOB THIERIOT 
Stanford posted the invading
Air Force an early 10 point
advantage Saturday afternoon,
but then crushed the Falcons un
der the weight of a 15 point scor
ing spurt and a rush during
which Stanford outscored Air
Force 26-2.
The Indians beat the Air Force
in the first cage game ever be
tween the two schools, 80-65.
Falcons Take Off ...
The first six field goal at
tempts that the Falcons tossed
up threaded the hoop, and the
packed throng at the Pavilion

soon found their heroes behind
at 15-5.
Cliff Parsons the tallest (6'
10") man in Falcon basketball
history led the splurge, as he did
the entire Air Force offensive.
He finished as the high scorer
for the game with 26 points.
... But Are Shot Down
Stanford finally got rolling,
and Air Force cooled off enough
to allow the Indians to catch
them with seven minutes re
maining in the half at 28. At
19-28 Stanford began a 15 point
scoring spree which all but de
stroyed Falcon asperations. But
after AF finally scored, the on
slaught continued beyond the
half. Stanford ran the score to
45-30.
Art Harris and Mai McElwain
led the attack against the Air
Force which last for almost 9
minutes.
Griffin Scores 21
Don Griffin led the Indians in
scoring with 21 points. He has
been an unexpected star this
year, who has done much to
make up for Stanford's lack of
height. Howard Hassen had one
of his few scoring days, ringing

up 15 points. Art Harris tallied
14.
The second half was somewhat
anti-climactic, after the first half
comeback. TTie Falcons never
made a serious rush at Stan
ford, though Parsons kept dump
ing in points from the key, and
captain corner-man Fred Bud
inger threw in 18.
Indians Scalp Pioneers

Stanford won its tenth game
of the season Friday night
against the Denver Pioneers, 66-
58. In a game of whistle blow
ing and foul shooting, 51 per
sonal fouls were called and 83
free throws attempted.
Denver jumped off to a rapid
15-5 lead to start the game. The
Cards called time out to re
gather forces, and came back to
tie the game 28-28 and were
never headed again.
Hollines Controlled
Hot-shooting Harry Hollines, a
before-game all-America candi
date, looked like a ball of putty
in the hands of Don Griffin. Hol
lines, averaging 26 points per
game and ranking fifth in the
nation in scoring, was held to
only three field goals and four
teen points for the game. He
missed a total of 11 shots from
the floor for a rather anemic
.214 percentage.
While Griffin was guarding
him, Harry hit only one field

goal. Griffin had five flelu goals
and three foul shots for 13
points.
Beck Nets 18
Denver's Brian Beck led all
scorers with 18 points, dropping
in hook shots from both left and
right of the key. The loss of the
6'-7", 220 pound forward with
3.44 left to play in a tight game,
all but ruined the Pioneers'
hopes for winning.
Art Harris led the Stanford at
tack with 14 points, and Gary
Petersmeyer matched Don Grif
fin's output with 13 points. Two
substitutes, Mai McElwain and
Ed Martin were the next highest
scorer with 9 and 8 points re
spectively.
Shooting for both teams was
poor. Stanford managed only 33
per cent, 21 for 63, and Denver
shot 37 per cent, 18 for 49. Stan
ford lost several potential points
on missed free throws in the
closing minutes. They ended the
game with 62 per cent. Denver
shot slightly better hitting on 68
per cent from the charity line.
11-5 On Season
The weekend sweep gives Stan
ford an overall record of 11-5,
with the resumption of the con
ference games imminent. The In
dians boast a 3-1 slate. The only
loss was inflicted by the con
ference leading UCLA Bruins,
who are undefeated and beat
rival USC 40-35 in overtime Sat
urday night.
