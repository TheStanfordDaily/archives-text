### JOHN MERRILL 
In a battle of the toes, the
Stanford rugby team defeated
the San Francisco Olympic Club
ruggers 14-6 Saturday.
The game, the fourth straight
season victory for the Indians,
was highlighted by the kicking
of Stanford's Mike Grace and
the equally outstanding foot

work of the Club's Tom Blanch
field, former California foot
baller.
Grace scored 11 points for the
day to run his point total for
the season to 43. Grace has been
the high point man for the In
dians in every game to date.
Early Club Lead
Blanchficld put the Club in the

lead early in the game with a
penalty kick after he and Grace
had both missed early attempts
at penalty three-pointers.
Blanchfield's kick, a 40-yard ef
fort, was quickly followed up by
a 30-yard beauty from Mike
Grace, knotting the score at 3-3.
The game then developed into
a rugged scrum duel which re

sembled a pitched battle even
more than rugby games usually
do.
Nye Leads Llneouts
The more experienced Olym
pic hooker gave the Club an
advantage in the scrums, though
Stanford, behind the rugged
playing of Blaine Nye, took most
of the lineouts.

Shortly before halftime, Grace
put the Indians in the lead to
stay with his second penalty
kick. This one, from 20 yarns
out, made the score 6-3 at half
time.
Like the first period, the sec
ond half opened with an ex
change of penalty kicks. Blanch
field again scored first with a
30-yard kick, but Grace followed
a few minutes later with his,
a 30-yard boot, with a bad angle
to the left.
Back To The Scrum
The struggle once again shift
ed to the scrum play of both
teams, but Stanford began to
dominate the play as the game
progressed. In the scrum, Nye,
Frank Pattitucci, Joe Neal, and
Peter Hogg began to take the
game to their Olympic oppo
nents.
Jeff Joseph, Eric Sutcliffe, and
Dick Ragsdale countered most
of the Club's offensive rushes
and only once did the Club threa
ten in the second half, when they
were turned back on the 5 yard
line.
Stanford's final score of the
game came when Bob Blunt took
the ball after a backfield rush.
Blunt ran for ten yards, then
was hit and released the ball.
Blunt Scores
Blunt came up with the ball
again seconds later and contin
ued 25 yards to the end zone for
the try. Grace's conversion at
tempt was good and the game
stood at 14-6, the final score.
At the game's end Stanford
was pressing for another score,
deep in the Olympic Club terri
tory. Dick Ragsdale and Eric
Sutcliffe did most of the run
ning damage to the Club in this
late going.
After the game Coach Pete
Kmetovic commented, "This is
easily our finest game yet. Blaine
Nye and Frank Pattitucci did a
great job for us in the scrum
and I though all the backs played
very well."
An Important Game
Kmetovic thought the team
got stronger as the game went
along and was pleased with the
over all team play. The Indians
are now 4-0-0 and have out
scored their opponents 73-22. No
opponent has scored over 10

ning damage to the Club in this
late going.

great job for us in the scrum
and I though all the backs played
very well."

got stronger as the game went
along and was pleased with the
