# Boyce Soars To Jump Mark
## Long Way Down! 
### JIM MALLERY 
Led by high flying Peter Boyce
in the high-jump, Stanford's
traveling track stars placed in
every event they entered at the
Seattle Invitational Indoor Track
Meet Saturday night.
Boyce, holder of the frosh and
old school records, set a new
school standard of 6'-ll", eclips
ing his old mark by a half inch.
He made both 6'-10" and 6'-ll"
on his first try and then nar
rowly missed 7'-0" on his third
try. On that jump he was over
the bar, but came down on it.
Vaughan Sets Personal Mark
Junior Craig Vaughan pulled
in a second place for the Cards
with a leap in the long jump of
25'-5%". Winner of the event
was Darrel Horn at 25'-8\
Vaughan has been steadily im
proving this season, after being
Stanford's number one jumper
as a sophomore last year. In
the San Francisco meet earlier
this year, he did 23'-ll" for
fourth place, and before that, 22'-
2" in intrasquad competition.
Jim Ward, also a junior, placed
second in the 500 yd. run with
a fast time of 58.4 sec. Ward,
too, has been looking good this
year; in the San Francisco meet
he placed second in the 600 yd.
run against a very fast field.
Jim Eshelman was able to cap
ture only third place with a leap
of 15'-6" in the pole vault. He

has been over 16'-0" this year
and has a best of better than
16'-6". Taking first in that event
was Jeff Chase at 16'-4". Second
was Philips of Oregon State at
16'-0".
Walsh Captures Two Places
Bud Walsh, who like Eshel
man, is competing in his last
year for the Indians, placed fifth
in both the 60 yd. high hurdles
and long jump. His time in the
best time of the year.
However, his distance of 22'-
9%" in the long jump was well
under his best. Three weeks ago
in intrasquad competition he
flew over the 24', and last year
was over that mark several
times.
Roger Cox placed sixth in the
60 yd. dash with a time of 6.2
sec. This was only a tenth of a
second off his best time of the
season, but in a race as short as
this, that time can mean the
difference of several places at the
finish.
The mile relay team of Roger
Cox, Larry Larson, Dan Wood
ruff, and Jim Ward placed fourth
with a time of 3:27.5. This was
their best of the indoor season,
and their best performance ever
during the three years that they
have competed in Seattle.
The next indoor meet for the
Cards will be in two weeks in
San Francisco Golden Gate In
vitational.
