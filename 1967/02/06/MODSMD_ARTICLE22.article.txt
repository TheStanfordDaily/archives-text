# Challenge:
## read this message in 32 seconds. 
### 
There are 1,236 words in this message. If
you read at the average national reading
rate, you will require nearly five minutes
to read it. If you had developed the
simple skill of Dynamic Reading, you
would be nearly halfway through the
article by now. There are many Reading
Dynamics graduates who could read this
page with full comprehension in less than
10 seconds.
But don't be embarrassed about your
slow reading. The simple fact is that you
don't read slowly by average standards;
but by the standards of Reading Dy
namics you poke along at a snail's pace
— probably reading between 250 and 400
words per minute. You are not alone.
Most of your friends and neighbors —
and many highly placed professional
people —can't read any faster than you.
Many undoubtedly read at a consider
ably slower pace.
Most Reading Dynamics graduates can
read an average novel in less than the
time it would take them to watch the Ed
Sullivan Show on Sunday night. And
they read with full comprehension and
complete enjoyment. You can, too, once
you have acquired the extraordinary
skill of Dynamic Reading.
Most Bay Area Dynamic Readers have now
finished this article. But please keep going.
In recent years over 250,000 people have
graduated from the 63 Reading Dynam
ics Institutes here and abroad. All of
these people took the course with the
guarantee that their reading efficiency
would at least triple in the short span
of eight weeks. In virtually every case,
when the student attended class sessions
and did the required practice, this excit
ing promise came true. Reading Dynam
ics makes you the sarpe astonishing guar
antee: We guarantee to increase your
reading efficiency at least 3 times. We
will refund the entire tuition to any
student who, after completing minimum
class and study requirements, does not
at least triple his reading efficiency as
measured by our beginning and ending
tests. Reading efficiency combines rate
and comprehension, not speed alone.
Compared to the national average of 325
words a minute, most Reading Dynamics
graduates from the Bay Area read nearly
3,000 words per minute. Many people

who read Dynamically have developed
their skill so successfully that they are
able to read at even higher rates. As
tonishing? Yes, it is. But true.
At this point you are probably a bit in
credulous. A doubting Thomas. Be our
guest. We admit our claims are dramatic
— indeed, overwhelming. But they are
based on documented statistical case his
tories of our thousands of students. When
you become one of our students —even
though you may be a relatively slow
reader now —you, too, will contribute to
our startling record of achievement.
Evelyn Wood first observed Dynamic
Reading 18 years ago when a professor
at the University of Utah read her term
paper at an amazing 6,000 words per
minute. Mrs. Wood's curiosity caused her
to look for other exceptional readers,
and over the next few years, she found
50 people who could read faster than
1,500 words per minute, with fine com
prehension, outstanding recall, and great
satisfaction in reading.
"Reading is a waste of time, slow or fast,
if you don't understand what you are
reading," stated Evelyn Wood at a recent
teacher training conference. "If you
are not comprehending, you are not
reading."
The first thing you are asked to do after
enrolling in the Evelyn Wood Reading
Dynamics course is to forget everything
you have ever been taught about how to
read. Reading Dynamics teaches you to
read all over again. A relatively fast
reader beginning the course does not
have any particular advantage over an
average reader starting the course. You
will be taught to read not just with your
eyes, but with all your senses. Words will
become pictures, and pages will roll by
like frames on film. Your eyes will learn
to move in rhythmic patterns down the
page and through the volume; and you
will read with thorough comprehension
in a fraction of the time it takes you now.
As a child you were taught to "hear" the
words as you read them. You will be un
taught that cumbersome technique and
discover that you can read swiftly and
meaningfully by circumventing your old
audio reading patterns. Once this eye
to-mind communication has been estab
lished, you practically eliminate the ne
cessity of saying, hearing or re-thinking
words. You will no longer read word-by

word or even phrase-by-phrase; indeed,
as you develop your skill, neither will
you read sentence-by-sentence. Instead,
you will read iii "chunks." You will visu
ally lift large blocks of material from the
printed page and instantaneously project
actions and pictures onto the screen of
your imagination. As the course devel
ops your Reading Dynamics skills, you
will discover the exhilaration of experi
encing the vitality of the printed page.
Reading will become less and less like
reading, as it becomes more and more a
process of experiencing.
Dynamic Readers, having finished this
article, are now pages ahead of you in this
newspaper.
As you read, your hand will function as
a pacer, swiftly brushing across printed
material as the words well into pictures
in continuous, dramatic flow. You will
be gratified at your increased speed; you
will be moved by your newly developed
sensitivity to literary values; and you
will be thrilled at the high degree of re
tention of the printed material after it
has been read. Many Reading Dynamics
graduates find that their ability to recall
even highly technical material long after
it has been read is the single most valu
able aspect of their new skill.
The Evelyn Wood Reading Dynamics
teaching staff in the Northern California
area is highly experienced. Naturally,
all instructors are college graduates.
Many hold MA's and some are prepar
ing for their Ph.D's. Their instruction
never includes the use of machines or
electronic eye movement devices used
frequently in skim-reading courses. Me
chanical devices tend to make students
dependent upon machines as a reading
crutch. Moreover, Reading Dynamics
does not teach skimming. It teaches im
proved reading efficiency which includes
both speed and comprehension. Skim
ming techniques negate improved com
prehension and are therefore unaccept
able in the Evelyn Wood method.
As Mrs. Wood frequently points out,
"You read five times faster not by read
ing every fifth word, but by reading five
times as many words in the same amount
of time. It is impossible to tell which
words to skip or disregard until you have
seen them all and determined their rela
tive importance and meaning."

You should be reassured that the Evelyn
Wood Reading Dynamics course is the
definitive rapid reading method in the
world today.
The Dynamic Reader, having finished this
newspaper, is off doing something else.
In this supersonic, electronic, automated
age, it is comforting to know that man
has discovered a way to improve not just
things and machines but man himself.
When your minimum guarantee of trip
ling your reading skill comes to pass,
you will find that you can read and ab
sorb at least three times more material
in the time it now takes you to efficiently
complete present reading commitments.
To put it another way, you can conven
iently cut your present reading time
allotment by at least two-thirds. In an
age where your most precious posses
sions are time and knowledge, isn't this
a wonderful gift to give yourself? The
rare and exciting gift of self-improve
ment. It can be yours in EIGHT SHORT
WEEKS. The 32 second challenge is
now over.
