Students are the major underprivileged class
in today's society.
This oft-repeated rallying cry of the angry
young men (and women) of the new student
left possesses just enough credibility inter
spersed within the invective to invite closer
examination.
On its face, the statement seems invalid and
indefensible, especially here on the Farm. Stan
ford students, one can argue, represent a privi
leged minority of what is commonly acknowl
edged a highly privileged generation. Atten
dance at Stanford is, after all, a privilege and
not a right.
Furthermore, Stanford students either come
from middle or upper-middle financial strata, or
receive substantial financial aid, and for the most
part can afford to operate autos, and live and eat
in University residences (no trifling matter this
last, at $3/diem for food and $45/ mo. rent).
The notion that students are akin to share
croppers in the south or ghetto-dwellers in the
north seems, by these lights, rather absurb. Yet
with only a little effort, one can discover a num
ber of interesting parallels, some amusing, others
not so.
In the former category we note the rest room
situation on Inner Quad where the locked doors
of most of the inside conveniences bear the
label, "For Faculty Men (or Women) Only,"
while students are relegated, often literally, to
the "outbacks." One is relieved that at least the
drinking fountains are integrated.
Then, of course, we could mention the wom
en's housing situation, but so many loud and
furious words have already been expended over
this subject that, with difficulty, we restrain
ourselves.
But, nowhere are the lines of privilege more

clearly drawn, and students more explicitly rel
egated to the bottom of the pecking order, than
in the allocation and regulation of parking on
campus.
All parking sites, excluding visitor's and dorm
itory lots, are divided into three ordered classes,
arranged roughly concentrically about the im
portant elements of the university: the Quad,
the library complex, etc. Parking permits in
each of the three classes allow parking in the
specified and all inferior lots. Thus Reserved
permits, the highest class, may park in their
own, in Staff, or in Off-Campus (student) areas,
while students with Off-Campus stickers are
confined exclusively to the lowest, and most
distant lots.
This, we submit, is not only separate but
unequal.
Nor should it escape notice that students are
assessed $10 for "registration" while faculty and
staff permits are issued gratis.
And there are various addition reminders that
regulations are directed primarily at the stu
dents. For instance, one reads in the informative
little pamphlet on parking rules that "repeated
violation of parking regulations is subject to
action by the (student) Judicial Council." Yet
the mind boggles at the thought that the owner
of the great blue Fleetwood so often parked be
hind Building 10 should ever find himself be
fore that illustrous Council explaining his re
peated violation of the unqualified rule, "Motor
vehicles shall not be driven onto or parked
in the Quad."
There are, of course, assorted rationale for this
system, but none, we believe, gainsays our con
tention that in this and many other situations,
students are very much second class citizens.
