## Campus Housing: No Variety 
### Maggie McComas 
The problem of the residence
university policy goes beyond
the question of whether all stu
dents should have the option to
live off campus.
More fundamentally, the uni
versity must ask itself if it is
justified in maintaining the
residence policy if it cannot of
f e r "favorable alternatives"
among living quarters on cam
pus.
More than a few people
would like to see some creative
thought going into the planning
and construction of new resi
dences. It may be possible to put
into reality that plan of a type
of residence which could con
join academic, social and resi
dence aspects of university life
(as now developing on a trial
basis in the Grove Project).
It was hoped that the Moore-
Jacks residences would have of
fered this type of living alterna
tive. Yet the "indefinite delay"

seems to be another symptom of
a schizophrenic residence pol
icy.
More Groves
It has been assumed that more
Grove Projects, perhaps on a
larger scale, are the type of
residences wanted; yet Moore
will be even less than a half
hearted attempt at this goal. By
the same token, there seems to
have been no consideration as
to the other types of residences
which would make on-campus
living enticing to a larger num
ber of students.
The possibility of student-op
erated cooperatives has been
suggested more than once. Also,
the popularity of Hoskins indi
cates that women undergradu
ates give apartment living high
priority on their list of living
alternatives. If the on-campus
rule for undergrad women re
mains unchanged, the demand
for more apartment accommo

dations cannot be overlooked in
planning additional university
housing.
As now planned, Moore will
set a precedent in that it will be
the first residence specifically
designed for coeducational liv
ing. Yet the fact of a dorm's
being coeducational may not
particularly make it a "favor
able alternative," but rather a
passing novelty.
Bring Men Back
As far as a mere space is con
cerned, Moore would be fulfill
ing a special need in one respect
as there is now a waiting list
for men's housing. Space must
be provided for these people if
the concept of a residence uni
versity is to be fulfilled, and it
would appear that the univer
sity is trying to live up to its
residence "ideal" by bringing
more men back on campus.
As for women, the status of
Hoskins and some of the Row

houses remains cloudy. Moore
could hand approximately the
same number of occupants as
Hoskins or a combination of
Row houses. Officials are reluc
tant to indicate that Hoskins
might revert to its original pur
pose, housing for married stu
dents. In any case, the closing
of either Hoskins or the Row
Houses would give women stu
dents practically nO choice
among types of residences.
One cause of delay of the
Jacks House construction is the
holdup on the new fraternity
cluster. The problem in that
area arose in part because of
indecision on the precise ar
rangement of the five houses in
the cluster and also complaints
(already?) from residents near
the proposed site who felt that
the activity in the cluster would
disrupt the neighborhood.
Own Worst Enemy
Ironic that the development of

a new type ol residence should
be contingent upon the con
struction of a completely differ
ent type of living group, one
whose functions have been fair
ly well defined, goals deliniated,
and whose own selective resi
dence and membership policies
have fallen into serious ques
tion.
Since the reluctance to insti
tute a new type of living resi
dence seems to be contingent
upon the Packer Committee's
reevaluation of education and
residences, the university may
be its own worst enemy in
stifling change.
The very word 'reevaluation'
indicates that the committee's
primary duty will not be to pre
dict all the possible flaws in an
experimental living situation,
but rather to find out why the
present residence system is un
satisfactory.
