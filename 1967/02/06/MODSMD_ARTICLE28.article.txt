## Residence System Faltering; Is Only Half 'On' Worthwhile? 
### Bill Wertz 
Stanford's Board of Trustees
faces more than the dilemma of
allowing women to live off cam
pus. It faces the larger ques
tion of whether Stanford is to
continue to be a "residence uni
versity"; and to answer this
question, the Board is going to
have to stop sitting on the fence.
For years, the Board of Trus
tees has moved neither toward
nor away from the concept of a
residence university. Yet when
pressed to explain the obvious
inequity in requiring women to
live on campus when men can
live where they choose, the
Board answers that Stanford is
still devoted to a total residence
system.
Seemingly no effort, however,
is being made to require the
large number of men who live
off campus to move back on. In
deed, housing plans for the near
future would do little or nothing
to reduce the number of non
resident students at Stanford.

As the fraternity cluster plan
illustrates, the University seems
committed to a policy of replac
ing existing housing facilities
rather than adding additional
ones, and the proposed Moore-
Jacks dormitories seem aimed
more at women, who can be
housed on campus, than at men,
who cannot.
The reasons for this unfortu
nate ambivalence are several,
but primary among them seems
to be the Trustees' inability to
(reconcile the accepted educa
tional benefits of a residence
system with its considerably
higher cost and the fund-raising
difficulties of a private univer
sity.
Educators are in general agree
ment that students can benefit
greatly by living conditions
which encourage them to assimi
late the ideas and attitudes they
meet in the classroom by dis
cussing and exploring them im
mediately with others — hence

the concept of residing at the
university among peers. On a
college campus, however, espe
cially on a large campus where
it is impossible to know every
one, significant relationships and
close associations are influenced
to a great extent by physical
propinquity.
Encouragement
Thus, to provide this encour
agement, living, dining, and
studying arrangements must re
sult in very frequent associa
tions among a given group of
students. Almost necessarily,
housing units must be small and
relatively luxurious, providing
more than minimal sleeping and
eating facilities and encouraging
the student to stay within the
unit for study, relaxation and
recreation.
Despite Stanford's claim of
being a residence university, and
despite its token division of large
dormitories into "houses," most
of its students do not live under

the conditions that make resi
dential living at a university
valuable.
The closest Stanford comes to
the ideal residential concept in
housing is in the dwindling num
ber of women's row houses and
in fraternities. But in fraterni
ties, the value of close associa
tions which accompany a shar
ing of general values and specific
interests conflicts with a policy
of selection which eliminates the
obvious educational value of re
lationships among people whose
values and interests differ.
Forced Expansion
In the face of this agreement
on the value of a residential sys
tem, is the trend of higher edu
cation throughout the United
States and particularly in Cali
fornia. More and more students
are applying for admission to
already overcrowded colleges,
forcing expansion of all facilities
and driving costs up.
For state universities, this
burden is borne to some extent
by the taxpayer, although tu
ition increases are common in all
states. The private university is
faced with an even greater mone
tary problem, and as a result has
little left for the construction
of the small, relatively luxurious
residences that are optimal for
the educational process.
The answer to this problem
in many cases has been the con
struction of giant dormitories,
which are relatively inexpensive,
or requiring other students to
find their own housing and com
mute to school, thus freeing
funds for the expansion of class
room facilities and for faculty
salaries.
No Connection
Increasingly too, students seem
to be content to commute, in
deed, to separate entirely the
educational and the living en
vironment and to consider col
lege less as an intellectual ex
perience than as necessary voca
tional training.
The Board of Trustees must
consider, then, the advantages of
the residential university with
its costs and decide whether the
concept is viable in a time of
increasing enrollment, increasing
costs and a changing concept
of education.
The question of whether half a
residence system is better than
none is not an idle one. Students
are beginning to question the in
consistencies and the inequalities
that are the result of indecision
and lack of commitment, and it
is clear that the Trustees can
not postpone a decision much
longer.

tary problem, and as a result has
little left for the construction
of the small, relatively luxurious
residences that are optimal for
the educational process.
The answer to this problem
in many cases has been the con
struction of giant dormitories,
which are relatively inexpensive,
or requiring other students to
find their own housing and com
mute to school, thus freeing
funds for the expansion of class
room facilities and for faculty
salaries.
No Connection
Increasingly too, students seem
to be content to commute, in
deed, to separate entirely the
educational and the living en
vironment and to consider col
lege less as an intellectual ex
perience than as necessary voca
tional training.
The Board of Trustees must
consider, then, the advantages of
the residential university with
its costs and decide whether the
concept is viable in a time of
increasing enrollment, increasing
costs and a changing concept
of education.
The question of whether half a
residence system is better than
none is not an idle one. Students
are beginning to question the in
consistencies and the inequalities
that are the result of indecision
and lack of commitment, and it
is clear that the Trustees can
not postpone a decision much
longer.
Stanford's Board of Trustees
faces more than the dilemma of
allowing women to live off cam
pus. It faces the larger ques
tion of whether Stanford is to
continue to be a "residence uni
versity"; and to answer this
question, the Board is going to
have to stop sitting on the fence.
For years, the Board of Trus
tees has moved neither toward
nor away from the concept of a
residence university. Yet when
pressed to explain the obvious
inequity in requiring women to
live on campus when men can
live where they choose, the
Board answers that Stanford is
still devoted to a total residence
system.
Seemingly no effort, however,
is being made to require the
large number of men who live
off campus to move back on. In
deed, housing plans for the near
future would do little or nothing
to reduce the number of non
resident students at Stanford.

As the fraternity cluster plan
illustrates, the University seems
committed to a policy of replac
ing existing housing facilities
rather than adding additional
ones, and the proposed Moore-
Jacks dormitories seem aimed
more at women, who can be
housed on campus, than at men,
who cannot.
The reasons for this unfortu
nate ambivalence are several,
but primary among them seems
to be the Trustees' inability to
(reconcile the accepted educa
tional benefits of a residence
system with its considerably
higher cost and the fund-raising
difficulties of a private univer
sity.
Educators are in general agree
ment that students can benefit
greatly by living conditions
which encourage them to assimi
late the ideas and attitudes they
meet in the classroom by dis
cussing and exploring them im
mediately with others — hence

the concept of residing at the
university among peers. On a
college campus, however, espe
cially on a large campus where
it is impossible to know every
one, significant relationships and
close associations are influenced
to a great extent by physical
propinquity.
Encouragement
Thus, to provide this encour
agement, living, dining, and
studying arrangements must re
sult in very frequent associa
tions among a given group of
students. Almost necessarily,
housing units must be small and
relatively luxurious, providing
more than minimal sleeping and
eating facilities and encouraging
the student to stay within the
unit for study, relaxation and
recreation.
Despite Stanford's claim of
being a residence university, and
despite its token division of large
dormitories into "houses," most
of its students do not live under

the conditions that make resi
dential living at a university
valuable.
The closest Stanford comes to
the ideal residential concept in
housing is in the dwindling num
ber of women's row houses and
in fraternities. But in fraterni
ties, the value of close associa
tions which accompany a shar
ing of general values and specific
interests conflicts with a policy
of selection which eliminates the
obvious educational value of re
lationships among people whose
values and interests differ.
Forced Expansion
In the face of this agreement
on the value of a residential sys
tem, is the trend of higher edu
cation throughout the United
States and particularly in Cali
fornia. More and more students
are applying for admission to
already overcrowded colleges,
forcing expansion of all facilities
and driving costs up.
For state universities, this
burden is borne to some extent
by the taxpayer, although tu
ition increases are common in all
states. The private university is

tary problem, and as a result has

Despite Stanford's claim of
being a residence university, and
despite its token division of large
dormitories into "houses," most
of its students do not live under

the conditions that make resi
dential living at a university
valuable.
The closest Stanford comes to
the ideal residential concept in
housing is in the dwindling num
ber of women's row houses and
in fraternities. But in fraterni
ties, the value of close associa
tions which accompany a shar
ing of general values and specific
interests conflicts with a policy
of selection which eliminates the
obvious educational value of re
lationships among people whose
values and interests differ.
Forced Expansion
In the face of this agreement
on the value of a residential sys
tem, is the trend of higher edu
cation throughout the United
States and particularly in Cali
fornia. More and more students
are applying for admission to
already overcrowded colleges,
forcing expansion of all facilities
and driving costs up.
For state universities, this
burden is borne to some extent
by the taxpayer, although tu
ition increases are common in all
states. The private university is
faced with an even greater mone
tary problem, and as a result has
little left for the construction
of the small, relatively luxurious
residences that are optimal for
the educational process.
The answer to this problem
in many cases has been the con
struction of giant dormitories,
which are relatively inexpensive,
or requiring other students to
find their own housing and com
mute to school, thus freeing
funds for the expansion of class
room facilities and for faculty
salaries.
No Connection
Increasingly too, students seem
to be content to commute, in
deed, to separate entirely the
educational and the living en
vironment and to consider col
lege less as an intellectual ex
perience than as necessary voca
tional training.
The Board of Trustees must
consider, then, the advantages of
the residential university with
its costs and decide whether the
concept is viable in a time of
increasing enrollment, increasing
costs and a changing concept
of education.
The question of whether half a
residence system is better than
none is not an idle one. Students
are beginning to question the in
consistencies and the inequalities
that are the result of indecision
and lack of commitment, and it
is clear that the Trustees can
not postpone a decision much
longer.
Stanford's Board of Trustees
faces more than the dilemma of
allowing women to live off cam
pus. It faces the larger ques
tion of whether Stanford is to
continue to be a "residence uni
versity"; and to answer this
question, the Board is going to
have to stop sitting on the fence.
For years, the Board of Trus
tees has moved neither toward
nor away from the concept of a
residence university. Yet when
pressed to explain the obvious
inequity in requiring women to
live on campus when men can
live where they choose, the
Board answers that Stanford is
still devoted to a total residence
system.
Seemingly no effort, however,
is being made to require the
large number of men who live
off campus to move back on. In
deed, housing plans for the near
future would do little or nothing
to reduce the number of non
resident students at Stanford.

As the fraternity cluster plan
illustrates, the University seems
committed to a policy of replac
ing existing housing facilities
rather than adding additional
ones, and the proposed Moore-
Jacks dormitories seem aimed
more at women, who can be
housed on campus, than at men,
who cannot.
The reasons for this unfortu
nate ambivalence are several,
but primary among them seems
to be the Trustees' inability to
(reconcile the accepted educa
tional benefits of a residence
system with its considerably
higher cost and the fund-raising
difficulties of a private univer
sity.
Educators are in general agree
ment that students can benefit
greatly by living conditions
which encourage them to assimi
late the ideas and attitudes they
meet in the classroom by dis
cussing and exploring them im
mediately with others — hence

the concept of residing at the
university among peers. On a
college campus, however, espe
cially on a large campus where
it is impossible to know every
one, significant relationships and
close associations are influenced
to a great extent by physical
propinquity.
Encouragement
Thus, to provide this encour
agement, living, dining, and
studying arrangements must re
sult in very frequent associa
tions among a given group of
students. Almost necessarily,
housing units must be small and
relatively luxurious, providing
more than minimal sleeping and
eating facilities and encouraging
the student to stay within the
unit for study, relaxation and
recreation.
