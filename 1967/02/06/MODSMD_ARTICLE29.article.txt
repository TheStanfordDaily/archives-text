## Stanford Breeds Superpeople In Fusion Of Polar Extremes 
### Bob Fishman 
Once upon a time, the student
body presidents, football cap
tains, campus queens and every
one else who could muster a
bright Pepsodent smile stood at
the top of the campus status
hierarchy.
Now their antitheses, the
proudly dissheveled activists,
the objectors and rejectors,
have made a strong challenge.
You can see them on every col
lege campus, either marching in
demonstrations or reading Cam
us in English translation.
But we at this university are
privileged to be present at the
birth of a new breed of super
men and superwomen: the Stan
ford synthesis.
I mean the people who articu
lately debunk American society
while working as hard as they
can to be its future leaders.
They'll do anything for prin
ciples — anything that doesn't
hurt their chances for grad
school.
They have mastered both the
idiom of revolt and the tech
niques of success.

They'll smoke pot and even
try LSD, provided it does not
interfere with studying for the
next midterm.
For them, Haight-Ashbury is
a great place to visit, but they
wouldn't want to live there.
Their dream is a $50,000
ranch house — with a Volks
wagen parked in front.
The Stanford synthesis is the
fraternity man who hates fra
ternities, the future corporation
lawyer who hates "big busi
ness," the guy who reads the
New York Review of Books and
Time—and likes them both.
It is the Row Girl who doesn't
believe in God but "loves" Dec.n
Napier.
Symbol: Pill
The symbol of the Stanford
synthesis ought to be the con
traceptive, embodying, as it
does, both daring and safety.
The university, of course, is
the ideal environment for the
Stanford synthesis.
Here one can take courses of
Marxism, the culture of pover
ty, and other topical problems.

One can have dinner with like
minded professors who are
usually more witty than their
students.
There are also many interest
ing clubs like SDS one can be
long to.
For those so inclined, the uni
versity offers a perfect oppor
tunity for the separation of
thought and action.
Winning Combo
I do not know what to think
of the people who embody the
Stanford synthesis. Theirs is
certainly a winning combina
tion.
They are destined to be the
patrons of symphony orches
tras, and the supporters of lit
erary magazines, book clubs
and universities.
But they also have an oppor
tunity which neither the objec
tors nor the acceptors will ever
have. Once in control, they will
have a real chance to effect a
synthesis between their "princi
ples" and their position.
It will be interesting to see
if they succeed.

But we at this university are
privileged to be present at the
birth of a new breed of super
men and superwomen: the Stan
ford synthesis.
I mean the people who articu
lately debunk American society
while working as hard as they
can to be its future leaders.
They'll do anything for prin
ciples — anything that doesn't
hurt their chances for grad
school.
They have mastered both the
idiom of revolt and the tech
niques of success.

They'll smoke pot and even
try LSD, provided it does not
interfere with studying for the
next midterm.
For them, Haight-Ashbury is
a great place to visit, but they
wouldn't want to live there.
Their dream is a $50,000
ranch house — with a Volks
wagen parked in front.
The Stanford synthesis is the
fraternity man who hates fra
ternities, the future corporation
lawyer who hates "big busi
ness," the guy who reads the
New York Review of Books and
Time—and likes them both.
It is the Row Girl who doesn't
believe in God but "loves" Dec.n
Napier.
Symbol: Pill
The symbol of the Stanford
synthesis ought to be the con
traceptive, embodying, as it
does, both daring and safety.
The university, of course, is
the ideal environment for the
Stanford synthesis.
Here one can take courses of
Marxism, the culture of pover
ty, and other topical problems.

One can have dinner with like
minded professors who are
usually more witty than their
students.
There are also many interest
ing clubs like SDS one can be
long to.
For those so inclined, the uni
versity offers a perfect oppor
tunity for the separation of
thought and action.
Winning Combo
I do not know what to think
of the people who embody the
Stanford synthesis. Theirs is
certainly a winning combina
tion.
They are destined to be the
patrons of symphony orches
tras, and the supporters of lit
erary magazines, book clubs
and universities.
But they also have an oppor
tunity which neither the objec
tors nor the acceptors will ever
have. Once in control, they will
have a real chance to effect a
synthesis between their "princi
ples" and their position.
It will be interesting to see
if they succeed.
Once upon a time, the student
body presidents, football cap
tains, campus queens and every
one else who could muster a
bright Pepsodent smile stood at
the top of the campus status
hierarchy.
Now their antitheses, the
proudly dissheveled activists,
the objectors and rejectors,
have made a strong challenge.
You can see them on every col
lege campus, either marching in
demonstrations or reading Cam
us in English translation.
