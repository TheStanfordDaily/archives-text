# Thai Diplomat Speaks On Vietnam
## 
### MAGGIE McCOMAS 
"While our main concern is to keep
the Viet Cong from destroying South
Vietnam, the time has come for the
U.S. to withdraw its troops," said the
Ambassador from Thailand, speaking
'iere Friday. "American forces
shouldn't be there —unless absolutely
necessary for world peace," he added.
The Ambassador, H. E. Sukich Nim
manheminda, spoke at the Law
School, answering questions about
U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia
and Thailand's role in the growing
conflicts there. Mr. Nimmanheminda
has been ambassador to the U.S. since
1963, having previously served as am
bassador to Ceylon and as minister to
Nepal and Afghanistan.
Concerning U.S. involvement, he ob
served that the U.S. is trying to solve

problems left by imperialist regimes
in other countries by helping the na
tive peoples to rule themselves. "But
. . . you shouldn't be trying to force
something down the throats of un
willing people. The trouble with
America is that it tends to listen to
what other countries, such as France,
says about its actions, and then gets
an 'inferiority complex,' " he said.
Answering questions about Thai
land's guerilla movement, the Thai
land Patriotic Front, he indicated that
the forces are composed of both Thais
and outsiders. "Some of them are lo
cal people who feel that they are get
ting scant attention from Bangkok,"
he said. "But this is not so different
from people in the U.S. who are dis
satisfied with the poverty programs."
Outsiders
"Most of the trouble comes from
outsiders trying to incite the Thai
peoples," he continued, pointing out
that the forces are led primarily by
infiltrators or communist inspired na
tives. "These are people who are
ready to play the 'stooge' for strong
ideological groups."
"We can cut the insurgents down
any day,"he said. "But there are
many innocent people around." He
indicated that action against guerillas
in Thailand hasn't been escalated out
of consideration for the Thai people.
"Why should we kill our own people
unnecessarily?" he said. "Our mod
erate way of dealing with this situa
tion is compatible with our Buddhist
way of life."
He said, however, that Thailand had
perhaps made the mistake of being
"too kind" to some refugees. "Ho Chi
Minh once sought refuge from French

persecution . . . [refugees] always
come to a country where people are
working for freedom. Seventy thou
sand Vietnamese tried to escape the
French and come to Thailand, but
they were still 'worshipping' Ho Chi
Minh."
Order
The Ambassador also touched on
internal problems of Thailand, indi
cating that their main concern is "to
put our house in order," by overhaul
ing the administration, taxation sys
tem, educational system, public health
facilities and building and road pro
grams.
He said that the Thai government
has had "indigestion" since 1932. "We
just couldn't assimilate democracy
. . . Eight years ago a new constitu
tion was requested but has not been
yet drafted. We hope to be ready this
year and have elections soon. The sys
tem would be much like the British
parliament, with the opposition hav
ing a similar role."
He defended the present system,
which puts a military general in
charge as prime minister. "It is not
actually a military dictatorship; the
government is not centered in Bang
kok, but scattered throughout the
country. Since there is no constitu
tion it is quite all right for the mili
tary to maintain order," he said.
Chinese
Concerning the Chinese menace,
Mr. Nimmanheninda said that the
Thais were ready to defend themselves
and "face the consequences. Right
now we don't have too many troops
on the frontiers because we don't

want to provoke incidents," he said.
He added that the Vietnamese were
not the prime threat to Thailand. "We
have nothing to fear . . . except 700
million Chinese," he said.
In regard to China's internal prob
lems, the ambassador said that it is
the "nature of things" for there to be
some element of intrigue and turmoil
in China. Chinese rule seems to be a
problem of the "eternal triangle,"
with constant competition among
rulers.
"The communist Chinese have held
together for ten years . . . actually
that's quite a record," he said.

served that the U.S. is trying to solve

problems left by imperialist regimes
in other countries by helping the na
tive peoples to rule themselves. "But
. . . you shouldn't be trying to force
something down the throats of un
willing people. The trouble with
America is that it tends to listen to
what other countries, such as France,
says about its actions, and then gets
an 'inferiority complex,' " he said.
Answering questions about Thai
land's guerilla movement, the Thai
land Patriotic Front, he indicated that
the forces are composed of both Thais
and outsiders. "Some of them are lo
cal people who feel that they are get
ting scant attention from Bangkok,"
he said. "But this is not so different
from people in the U.S. who are dis
satisfied with the poverty programs."
Outsiders
"Most of the trouble comes from
outsiders trying to incite the Thai
peoples," he continued, pointing out
that the forces are led primarily by
infiltrators or communist inspired na
tives. "These are people who are
ready to play the 'stooge' for strong
ideological groups."
"We can cut the insurgents down
any day,"he said. "But there are
many innocent people around." He
indicated that action against guerillas
in Thailand hasn't been escalated out
of consideration for the Thai people.
"Why should we kill our own people
unnecessarily?" he said. "Our mod
erate way of dealing with this situa
tion is compatible with our Buddhist
way of life."
He said, however, that Thailand had
perhaps made the mistake of being
"too kind" to some refugees. "Ho Chi
Minh once sought refuge from French

persecution . . . [refugees] always
come to a country where people are
working for freedom. Seventy thou
sand Vietnamese tried to escape the
French and come to Thailand, but
they were still 'worshipping' Ho Chi
Minh."
Order
The Ambassador also touched on
internal problems of Thailand, indi
cating that their main concern is "to
put our house in order," by overhaul
ing the administration, taxation sys
tem, educational system, public health
facilities and building and road pro
grams.
He said that the Thai government
has had "indigestion" since 1932. "We
just couldn't assimilate democracy
. . . Eight years ago a new constitu
tion was requested but has not been
yet drafted. We hope to be ready this
year and have elections soon. The sys
tem would be much like the British
parliament, with the opposition hav
ing a similar role."
He defended the present system,
which puts a military general in
charge as prime minister. "It is not
actually a military dictatorship; the
government is not centered in Bang
kok, but scattered throughout the
country. Since there is no constitu
tion it is quite all right for the mili
tary to maintain order," he said.
Chinese
Concerning the Chinese menace,
Mr. Nimmanheninda said that the
Thais were ready to defend themselves
and "face the consequences. Right
now we don't have too many troops
on the frontiers because we don't

want to provoke incidents," he said.
He added that the Vietnamese were
not the prime threat to Thailand. "We
have nothing to fear . . . except 700
million Chinese," he said.
In regard to China's internal prob
lems, the ambassador said that it is
the "nature of things" for there to be
some element of intrigue and turmoil
in China. Chinese rule seems to be a
problem of the "eternal triangle,"
with constant competition among
rulers.
"The communist Chinese have held
together for ten years . . . actually
that's quite a record," he said.

from people in the U.S. who are dis
satisfied with the poverty programs."
Outsiders
"Most of the trouble comes from
outsiders trying to incite the Thai
peoples," he continued, pointing out
that the forces are led primarily by
infiltrators or communist inspired na
tives. "These are people who are
ready to play the 'stooge' for strong
ideological groups."
"We can cut the insurgents down
any day,"he said. "But there are
many innocent people around." He
indicated that action against guerillas
in Thailand hasn't been escalated out
of consideration for the Thai people.
"Why should we kill our own people
unnecessarily?" he said. "Our mod
erate way of dealing with this situa
tion is compatible with our Buddhist
way of life."
He said, however, that Thailand had
perhaps made the mistake of being
"too kind" to some refugees. "Ho Chi
Minh once sought refuge from French

persecution . . . [refugees] always
come to a country where people are
working for freedom. Seventy thou
sand Vietnamese tried to escape the
French and come to Thailand, but
they were still 'worshipping' Ho Chi
Minh."
Order
The Ambassador also touched on
internal problems of Thailand, indi
cating that their main concern is "to
put our house in order," by overhaul
ing the administration, taxation sys
tem, educational system, public health
facilities and building and road pro
grams.
He said that the Thai government
has had "indigestion" since 1932. "We
just couldn't assimilate democracy
. . . Eight years ago a new constitu
tion was requested but has not been
yet drafted. We hope to be ready this
year and have elections soon. The sys
tem would be much like the British
parliament, with the opposition hav
ing a similar role."
He defended the present system,
which puts a military general in
charge as prime minister. "It is not
actually a military dictatorship; the
government is not centered in Bang
kok, but scattered throughout the
country. Since there is no constitu
tion it is quite all right for the mili
tary to maintain order," he said.
Chinese
Concerning the Chinese menace,
Mr. Nimmanheninda said that the
Thais were ready to defend themselves
and "face the consequences. Right
now we don't have too many troops
on the frontiers because we don't

want to provoke incidents," he said.
He added that the Vietnamese were
not the prime threat to Thailand. "We
have nothing to fear . . . except 700
million Chinese," he said.
In regard to China's internal prob
lems, the ambassador said that it is
the "nature of things" for there to be
some element of intrigue and turmoil
in China. Chinese rule seems to be a
problem of the "eternal triangle,"
with constant competition among
rulers.
"The communist Chinese have held
together for ten years . . . actually
that's quite a record," he said.


AMBASSADOR NIMMANHEMINDA
"While our main concern is to keep
the Viet Cong from destroying South
Vietnam, the time has come for the
U.S. to withdraw its troops," said the
Ambassador from Thailand, speaking
'iere Friday. "American forces
shouldn't be there —unless absolutely
necessary for world peace," he added.
The Ambassador, H. E. Sukich Nim
manheminda, spoke at the Law
School, answering questions about
U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia
and Thailand's role in the growing
conflicts there. Mr. Nimmanheminda
has been ambassador to the U.S. since
1963, having previously served as am
bassador to Ceylon and as minister to
Nepal and Afghanistan.
Concerning U.S. involvement, he ob
served that the U.S. is trying to solve

problems left by imperialist regimes
in other countries by helping the na
tive peoples to rule themselves. "But
. . . you shouldn't be trying to force
something down the throats of un
willing people. The trouble with
America is that it tends to listen to
what other countries, such as France,
says about its actions, and then gets
an 'inferiority complex,' " he said.
Answering questions about Thai
land's guerilla movement, the Thai
land Patriotic Front, he indicated that
the forces are composed of both Thais
and outsiders. "Some of them are lo
cal people who feel that they are get
ting scant attention from Bangkok,"
he said. "But this is not so different
from people in the U.S. who are dis
satisfied with the poverty programs."
