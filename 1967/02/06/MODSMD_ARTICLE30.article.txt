# Letters To The Editor
## Men Need More Than Billiards 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
I would like to make a few
comments on the content of re
cent issues of The Daily.
Contrary to Clay Miller (let
ters, 3 Feb.), I would like to
cast a vote in favor of co-educa
tional dormatories. It is my be
lief that it takes something more
than billiard rooms, Panatella
stogies and bourbon to make a
male into a man.
It would be my hope that co
educational housing would be
just that, co-educational, allow
ing each participant a better un
derstanding of the opposite sex
and thus leading to a better un
derstanding of one's own sex.
This in turn would, hopefully,
lead to a breaking down of some
of the false values and behav
ioral facades that tend to be so
prevalent in our society.
I would also like to take this

opportunity to commend the edi
tor and staff of Volume 151 for
their obvious efforts to upgrade
the quality of The Daily. Per
haps it is a bit early for final
judgment, but I am greatly en
couraged by the feature articles
on LSD, by the lengthy coverage
of the UCLA Literary supple
ment supressions, and by the
substantial expansion of national
coverage.
On this line I wonder if,
given the recent events in Sac
ramento, The Daily couldn't also
make a more concerted effort to
keep the Stanford community
abreast of developments as they
occur, perhaps with the appoint
ment of a "Political Editor"
whose sole function would be to
report on the Sacramento scene.
This would be, perhaps, an even
greater service to the Univer
sity.

In closing I would like to say
that in my estimation The Daily
is well on its way to becoming
an honest asset to the commu
nity.

Editor, The Dally:
It's time to say something
about scientists: they shout ter
rible things at one, and yet we
(laymen all) listen reverently to
their oracles as if wisdom re
sided only with them. After all,
scientists are human too, like
the rest of us, and often arro
gant, stupid, silly, and cruel. A
Nobel prize or the white uniform
of their order hardly serves to
exempt them from such failings.
We have laughed at the re
ligious and have forced him to
become one of us again; so—let's
make vicious fun of our newer
priests, that marvellous tribe of
Balnibarbians; let's sting those
"research proletariats" who so
avidly seek the comfortable se
curity of the Technological Es
tablishment, who "produce" only
because they learn enough to
obey the rules of the autono
mous scientific process.
What some of the Tinker Toy
boys are doing in the Holy Name
of Knowledge and Progress is
downright malicious and crim
inal — and inane. How we do
tremble (where's our common
sense?) before the polysyllabic
didacticism and revolting sci
entific piety, the presumptuous
braying of some Scientific Spe
cialist, some Teller, some B.F.
Skinner, who deigns (o rare!) to
thunder at the gullible common
man. They have thrown rocks
at many a glass dome and priv
ate greenhouse; now it's time to
break some windows in their
crystal palaces. The barb of
satire to this inflated humbug,
to bring our solemn, soaring in
tellects back down to our some
what finite, uncomfortable
ground,
HANS-PETER BRUER
• Pettiness
Editor, The Daily:
I was appalled to read Robert
Stone's article of January 26
criticizing the state of this great

university's roads. It was a fine
example of the petty thinking so
much in existence these days.
Mr. Stone complains of the
damage done to automobiles on
the Stanford thoroughfares.
Even a hasty glance at the larger
issues at stake would have
shown him that the thousands of
cars destroyed annually on cam
pus must be repaired or replaced.
Obviously this greatly aids both
the local and national economies.
As General Motors goes, so goes
the nation, and all that. This also
holds true for the wreckage
caused in accidents due to brake
failure, etc., while those killed,
maimed, or drowned serve to
retard the general population
explosion.
Furthermore the constant ex
cavation and re-excavation of
Stanford roads does the noble
service of combating growing
unemployment. This is enhanced
by the fact that the University
employs three observers to every
working man for their construc
tion crews. Also the prestige of
holding the Annual International
Chuck-Hole Diggers' Champion
ship on Pal Drive should not be
overlooked.
In the future it is to be hoped
that those of Mr. Stone's stamp
will confine their criticism to the
freshness of the rolls at Branner.
We must overlook the mayhem
caused by Stanford's roads, and
proudly revel in the great sacri
fices Stanford is making for the
nation. "Ask not what your
country can do for you, but what
you can do for your country."
Amen.

derstanding of the opposite sex
and thus leading to a better un
derstanding of one's own sex.
This in turn would, hopefully,
lead to a breaking down of some
of the false values and behav
ioral facades that tend to be so
prevalent in our society.
I would also like to take this

opportunity to commend the edi
tor and staff of Volume 151 for
their obvious efforts to upgrade
the quality of The Daily. Per
haps it is a bit early for final
judgment, but I am greatly en
couraged by the feature articles
on LSD, by the lengthy coverage
of the UCLA Literary supple
ment supressions, and by the
substantial expansion of national
coverage.
On this line I wonder if,
given the recent events in Sac
ramento, The Daily couldn't also
make a more concerted effort to
keep the Stanford community
abreast of developments as they
occur, perhaps with the appoint
ment of a "Political Editor"
whose sole function would be to
report on the Sacramento scene.
This would be, perhaps, an even
greater service to the Univer
sity.

In closing I would like to say
that in my estimation The Daily
is well on its way to becoming
an honest asset to the commu
nity.

Editor, The Dally:
It's time to say something
about scientists: they shout ter
rible things at one, and yet we
(laymen all) listen reverently to
their oracles as if wisdom re
sided only with them. After all,
scientists are human too, like
the rest of us, and often arro
gant, stupid, silly, and cruel. A
Nobel prize or the white uniform
of their order hardly serves to
exempt them from such failings.
We have laughed at the re
ligious and have forced him to
become one of us again; so—let's
make vicious fun of our newer
priests, that marvellous tribe of
Balnibarbians; let's sting those
"research proletariats" who so
avidly seek the comfortable se
curity of the Technological Es
tablishment, who "produce" only
because they learn enough to
obey the rules of the autono
mous scientific process.
What some of the Tinker Toy
boys are doing in the Holy Name
of Knowledge and Progress is
downright malicious and crim
inal — and inane. How we do
tremble (where's our common
sense?) before the polysyllabic
didacticism and revolting sci
entific piety, the presumptuous
braying of some Scientific Spe
cialist, some Teller, some B.F.
Skinner, who deigns (o rare!) to
thunder at the gullible common
man. They have thrown rocks
at many a glass dome and priv
ate greenhouse; now it's time to
break some windows in their

• Pettiness
Editor, The Daily:
I was appalled to read Robert
Stone's article of January 26
criticizing the state of this great

university's roads. It was a fine
example of the petty thinking so
much in existence these days.
Mr. Stone complains of the
damage done to automobiles on
the Stanford thoroughfares.
Even a hasty glance at the larger
issues at stake would have
shown him that the thousands of
cars destroyed annually on cam
pus must be repaired or replaced.
Obviously this greatly aids both
the local and national economies.
As General Motors goes, so goes
the nation, and all that. This also
holds true for the wreckage
caused in accidents due to brake
failure, etc., while those killed,
maimed, or drowned serve to
retard the general population
explosion.
Furthermore the constant ex
cavation and re-excavation of
Stanford roads does the noble
service of combating growing
unemployment. This is enhanced
by the fact that the University
employs three observers to every
working man for their construc
tion crews. Also the prestige of
holding the Annual International
Chuck-Hole Diggers' Champion
ship on Pal Drive should not be
overlooked.
In the future it is to be hoped
that those of Mr. Stone's stamp
will confine their criticism to the
freshness of the rolls at Branner.
We must overlook the mayhem
caused by Stanford's roads, and
proudly revel in the great sacri
fices Stanford is making for the
nation. "Ask not what your
country can do for you, but what
you can do for your country."
Amen.

on LSD, by the lengthy coverage
of the UCLA Literary supple
ment supressions, and by the
substantial expansion of national
coverage.
On this line I wonder if,
given the recent events in Sac
ramento, The Daily couldn't also
make a more concerted effort to
keep the Stanford community
abreast of developments as they
occur, perhaps with the appoint
ment of a "Political Editor"
whose sole function would be to
report on the Sacramento scene.
This would be, perhaps, an even
greater service to the Univer
sity.

In closing I would like to say
that in my estimation The Daily
is well on its way to becoming
an honest asset to the commu
nity.

Editor, The Dally:
It's time to say something
about scientists: they shout ter
rible things at one, and yet we
(laymen all) listen reverently to
their oracles as if wisdom re
sided only with them. After all,
scientists are human too, like
the rest of us, and often arro
gant, stupid, silly, and cruel. A
Nobel prize or the white uniform
of their order hardly serves to
exempt them from such failings.
We have laughed at the re
ligious and have forced him to
become one of us again; so—let's
make vicious fun of our newer
priests, that marvellous tribe of
Balnibarbians; let's sting those
"research proletariats" who so
avidly seek the comfortable se
curity of the Technological Es
tablishment, who "produce" only
because they learn enough to
obey the rules of the autono
mous scientific process.
What some of the Tinker Toy
boys are doing in the Holy Name
of Knowledge and Progress is
downright malicious and crim
inal — and inane. How we do
tremble (where's our common
sense?) before the polysyllabic
didacticism and revolting sci
entific piety, the presumptuous
braying of some Scientific Spe
cialist, some Teller, some B.F.
Skinner, who deigns (o rare!) to
thunder at the gullible common
man. They have thrown rocks
at many a glass dome and priv
ate greenhouse; now it's time to
break some windows in their
crystal palaces. The barb of
satire to this inflated humbug,
to bring our solemn, soaring in
tellects back down to our some
what finite, uncomfortable
ground,
HANS-PETER BRUER
• Pettiness
Editor, The Daily:
I was appalled to read Robert
Stone's article of January 26
criticizing the state of this great

university's roads. It was a fine
example of the petty thinking so
much in existence these days.
Mr. Stone complains of the
damage done to automobiles on
the Stanford thoroughfares.
Even a hasty glance at the larger
issues at stake would have
shown him that the thousands of
cars destroyed annually on cam
pus must be repaired or replaced.
Obviously this greatly aids both
the local and national economies.
As General Motors goes, so goes
the nation, and all that. This also
holds true for the wreckage
caused in accidents due to brake
failure, etc., while those killed,
maimed, or drowned serve to
retard the general population
explosion.
Furthermore the constant ex
cavation and re-excavation of
Stanford roads does the noble
service of combating growing
unemployment. This is enhanced
by the fact that the University
employs three observers to every
working man for their construc
tion crews. Also the prestige of
holding the Annual International
Chuck-Hole Diggers' Champion
ship on Pal Drive should not be
overlooked.
In the future it is to be hoped
that those of Mr. Stone's stamp
will confine their criticism to the
freshness of the rolls at Branner.
We must overlook the mayhem
caused by Stanford's roads, and
proudly revel in the great sacri
fices Stanford is making for the
nation. "Ask not what your
country can do for you, but what
you can do for your country."
Amen.

Editor, The Dally:
I would like to make a few
comments on the content of re
cent issues of The Daily.
Contrary to Clay Miller (let
ters, 3 Feb.), I would like to
cast a vote in favor of co-educa
tional dormatories. It is my be
lief that it takes something more
than billiard rooms, Panatella
stogies and bourbon to make a
male into a man.
It would be my hope that co
educational housing would be
just that, co-educational, allow
ing each participant a better un
derstanding of the opposite sex
and thus leading to a better un
derstanding of one's own sex.
This in turn would, hopefully,
lead to a breaking down of some
of the false values and behav
ioral facades that tend to be so
prevalent in our society.
I would also like to take this

opportunity to commend the edi
tor and staff of Volume 151 for
their obvious efforts to upgrade
the quality of The Daily. Per
haps it is a bit early for final
judgment, but I am greatly en
couraged by the feature articles
on LSD, by the lengthy coverage
of the UCLA Literary supple
ment supressions, and by the
substantial expansion of national
coverage.
