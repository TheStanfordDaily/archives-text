# New 'Commitment' Issue Features Broad Spectrum Of 'Resistance'
## 
### 
The latest issue of Commitment,
the bi weekly newspaper of Tho Ex>
>eriirient, will be available tomorrow
and Wednesday in most of the major
living groups and on top of the Stan
ford Dally pick up boxes around quad.
The issue features articles on Stan
xord's relationship with the military
industrial complex, the Warren Com
mission's Report of the assassination
of President Kennedy, and the second
half of a review on the poetry of Gary
Snyder.

Future issues, according to co
editor Barry Greenberg, will be called
Resistance and will include expanded
coverage and opinion on the war iti
Vietnam and the anti-war and anti
draft movements.
The reason for the title change,
Greenberg explains in the editorial of
this issue, is that . . we agree with
those who see a man's freedom as
consisting in his ability and courage
to say no, to say no to his society
which grows increasingly repressive,
to his society which grows increasing

ly intolerant of dissent, to his society
which is reducing all thought — all
men—to one sober, grey dimension."
Resistance will focus on the " . . .
uncommitted, unresisting student, the
individual whom we feel cannot yet
comprehend the totalitarian nature of
his society, and who can see no rea
son to resist and who is skeptical of
those who do."
Articles, essays, cartoons, etc. rep
resenting all views are welcomed by
the editors.
