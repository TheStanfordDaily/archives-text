# Marches On Sacramento To Question Policies
## 
### PAT McMAHON 
Sacramento and the Holy Land have
only one thing in common — people
march there when they think things
are going wrong.
This week will see at least two
marches in Sacramento to protest
Governor Reagan's budget cuts and
particularly the demands for tuition
at the University of California and
the State colleges.
On February 9, students of many
universities in California are expected
to march on the Capitol, hold a rally
and seminars, and visit legislators
and Governor Reagan to express their
concern.
The American Federation of Teach
ers will march on Saturday, Feb. 11
and they have asked all labor to join
with them as well as students.
Two marches to express the same
views, appealing to the same partici

pants—students, scheduled for differ
ent dates, have led to some conflict
between supporters of each march.
It seems that the American Fed
eration of Teachers (AFT) announced
their march earlier. The AFT is com
posed of the teachers in the State Col
lege system, high school teachers,
TA's, and other instructors but does
not include most professors. They set
their date for February 11, next Sat
urday.
Later, the Associated Students of
the University of California at Santa
Barbara (UCSB) organized a march
on the Capitol for the 9th, and asked
other campuses of UC to participate.
The Davis campus agreed to partic
ipate and offered that campus as an
organizational point for the march.
Response from other campuses was
light but in general support of the
plan. At the end of last week, stu
dents from UCSB were visiting vari
ous colleges and universities to pro
mote the march of "the academic
community."
At the Stanford stop-off, three stu
dents and a professor discussed the
plans for the march, the reason for
the February 9 date, and solicited
Stanford support.
The meeting, at which other schools
in the area were to attend but only
someone from Cal State in Hayward
appeared, included representatives of
Stanford's Students for A Democratic
Society (SDS), National Student As
cosiation (NSA) and a few other in
terested students.
Larry Adams, professor and facul
ty advisor of the group, discussed the
two dates. He said that the date set
for their march was not planned to
interfere with the Feb. 11 march, but
that there are several reasons for
both marches.
He explained that Ronald Reagan

would not be in Sacramento on Satur
day, but speaking in Eugene, Oregon.
Furthermore, UC's one three-day
holiday falls during the weekend, and
most students have made previous
plans.
He also cited the traffic problem,
and the possibility that dubious par
ents might object to the trip during
holidays otherwise spent at home,
and mentioned that the Academic
Senate at UCSB had excused the stu
dents at Santa Barbara from classes
to attend the march.
The student from Cal State at Hay
ward objected to the march because
he said it would harm the effective
ness of the Saturday march. He also
thought that it was not fair to expect
students to "skip school" for the
march and that many teachers were
legally bound to remain at their jobs.
Furthermore, he noted that the Satur
day marchers would include people
"from every occupation" and they
could not leave their work.
The NSA locally and nationally has
agreed to support the February 9
march and the SDS, the February
11th march. However, the SDS has
moved their scheduled noon rally
from Thursday back to Wednesday.
A spokesman for SDS said that,
"SDS is supporting the AFT march,
rather than the February 9 march
being organized by UCSB students
largely because the latter will take
place on Thursday, a day on which
few Stanford students could go to
Sacramento."
SDS announced plans to have rides
and buses available on Saturday for
transportation. They will meet tonite
at 8:15 in Tresidder 271 to discuss
plans for Wednesday's rally, and they
welcome people interested in the rally
or the march, regardless of their rea
sons to attend the meeting.
