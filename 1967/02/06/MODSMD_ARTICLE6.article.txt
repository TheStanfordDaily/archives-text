# Dellinger 'Contradicts' Pentagon; Calls Civilian Bombing Deliberate
## 
### BILL RORABAUGH 
"At the time I was there, all of
North Vietnam, except for a couple of
little circles around Hanoi and Hai
phong, was being bombed day and
night," Dave Dellinger, Liberation
magazine editor who visited North
Vietnam last year, told a Tresidder
audience yesterday afternoon.
Dellinger, in a speech sponsored by
the Stanford Students for a Demo
cratic Society, focused on the civilian
damaged caused by American air at
tacks on North Vietnam. "I believe
they are deliberately bombing civilian
targets," said Dellinger, adding that
"the newest and best buildings have
been destroyed."
Just Communists
Dellinger, once a Union Seminary
theology student, theorized that pilot
error or misdirection might have been
responsible for much of the civilian
attack. For other pilots, the people of
North Vietnam are "just communists,
some inferior kind of people that you
just don't relate to," he sugggested.
He suggested civilian targets were
sometimes picked rather than military
ones so the United States government
could emphasize to the rest of the
world that restraint had been used, by
pointing to an untouched factory.
"There was hardly a moment out
side Hanoi when you couldn't see the
bombs flash, or hear them crash, or
see flares. TTie planes are always go
ing overhead," Dellinger said.
Thailand Bases
The North Vietnamese told Del
linger 1000 planes per day fly over
North Vietnam. The Pentagon figure
is half that or says Dellinger.
The difference is the number of Ameri

can sorties taking off from Thailand
bases, and are, hence, not included in
the Pentagon figures.
Dellinger described fragmentation
bombs. They explode in the air, re
leasing 300 smaller bombs, which ex
plode again, releasing 150 pellets of
steel. These pellets have no value
against bridges or buildings, only hu
mans, he said.
He reported he did not see any
strafing, but "everywhere I went peo
ple talked to me about strafing." In
North Vietnam water buffalo and field
animals are strafed.
Into The Villages
"The reaction to bombing is not
fear," said Dellinger, and he men
tioned a "hate memorial" in a Catholic
village, that said "Firmly hold the
plow, firmly hold the rifle, in order to
avenge our fellow countrymen."
He found the situation far grimmer
than New York Times reporter Har
rison Salisbury reported. "Salisbury
traveled outside of Hanoi only when
bombs weren't falling, during truce
periods."
"I had to persuade the Vietnamese
to let me into the villages." Traveling
at night, in jeeps, with no lights, or
lights under the body of the vehicle,
Dellinger "crossed rivers where
bridges had been taken out only half
an hour before. Cost of the bridges
had been knocked out, but it didn't
make much difference."
Catholic Village
"Salisbury brought home to the
American people that the Catholic pop
ulation of North Vietnam could live
in peace," said Dellinger, adding that
he personally visited a Catholic vil
lage.

This particular Catholic village had
been bombed, and 32 persons had been
killed. Dellinger talked to a young
girl whose family had been wiped out
while eating lunch. She told him,
"Worse than that, they bombed our
Catholic church, with its 32 statutes of
the virgin that we revere."
While reporting "hatred" for Ameri
can bombers, Dellinger said the Viet
namese are not anti-American, be
cause they believe the American peo
ple are dominated by an evil gov
ernment and economic system.
In an interview with Ho Chi Minh,
Ho expressed compassion for the posi
tion of the American soldier who is
conscripted into a war he does not
understand and may not support. But
Ho added, "they are committing ter
rible crimes. We can never forget
that."
"I had my passport revoked to be
able to go to North Vietnam. They
didn't do that to Harrison Salisbury.
I'm not important, but they wouldn't
take Salisbury's passport," said Del
linger.
Honest Reporters
His visit to North Vietnam was ar
ranged through an invitation from
Staunton Lynd. The request for per
mission to visit was at first accepted,
then denied, after American bombers
struck the Hanoi area.
He emphasized, "When I saw the
extent and nature of the civilian dam
age, I intensified my request that a
few honest American newspapermen
be admitted." He felt that this would
happen anyway, but that the bombing
of the Hanoi area had temporarily
halted the process.
