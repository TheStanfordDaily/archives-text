I. THE NEED TO SPEAK
A time comes when silence is
betrayal. That time has come
for us in relation to Vietnam. As
members of American churches
and synagogues, we voice not
only our own convictions, but
seek also to articulate the un
expressed fears and longings of
millions of Americans.
The Old Testament forbids us
to prophecy "smooth things,"
and in the face of any evil, the
mandate of Albert Camus is laid
upon all men, whether religious
or not, that they "should speak
out, loud and clear, and that
they should voice their con

demnation in such a way that
never a doubt, never the sightest
doubt, could rise in the heart of
the simplest man. That they
should get away from abstrac
tion and confront the blood
stained face history has taken
on today."
Our share of responsibility
for that blood-stained face
haunts us today and prompts
our outcry. We confess that we
should have spoken sooner and
with clearer voice, but we do
speak now, hoping it is not too
late, adding our voice to the
voice of Pope Paul, the World
Council of Churches, the Syna
gogue Council of America, the
National Council of Churches,
the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops, and other reli
gious bodies, in urging a reap
praisal of our policy in Viet
nam.
Our allegiance to our nation
is held under a higher allegi
ance to the God who is sover
eign over all the nations. When
there is a conflict between those
allegiances, the priorities are
clear: "You shall have no other
gods before me." "We must
obey God rather than men."
Each day we find allegiance to
our nation's policy more diffi
cult to reconcile with allegiance
to our God.
Both the exercise of faith and
the expression of the democrat
ic privilege oblige us to make
our voices heard. For while we
speak as members of religious
communities, we also speak as
American citizens. Responsible
expression of disagreement and
dissent is the lifeblood of de
mocracy, and we speak out of a
loyalty that refuses to condone
in silence a national policy that
is leading our world toward dis
aster.
We speak in full awareness
that no easy answers are avail
able. But we believe that issues
must be pressed and questions
forced, if new answers are to be
forthcoming. For the old an
swers no longer satisfy us.

11. THE ONGOING ANGUISH
No one planned the type of
war in which we are involved.
It has slowly escalated from one
small move to the next small
move, each presumed to be the
last that would be necessary, so
that now we find our nation
able to offer only military an
swers to political and human
questions. We sympathize with
the dilemmas that face our
President and Congressmen in
dealing with a situation all de
cent men abhor. But a recogni
tion of past mistakes does not
entitle us to repeat and com
pound those mistakes by con
tinuing them on an ever-widen
ing scale.
We are unable to support our
nation's policy of military esca
lation, and we find those to
whom we minister caught as we
are in confusion and anguish be
cause of it.
1. This anguish is based first
of all on the immorality of the
warfare in Vietnam. We add our
voice to those who protest a
war in which civilian casualties
are greater than military; in
which whole populations are de
ported against their will; in
which the widespread use of
napalm and other explosives is
killing and maiming women,
children, and the aged; in which
the combatants are systemat
ically destroying the crops and
production capacity of a coun
try they profess to liberate; in
which the torturing of prisoners
by both sides has been common
place.
All who believe that man is
made in God's image must be
horrified by such crimes com
mitted against God and man.
There is guilt on all sides in
such a war as this, but the guilt
is ours far more than we have
courage to admit. We can only
tremble at the thought that God
is just.
2. Even those of us who rec
ognize that sometimes evil must
be done lest greater evil prevail,
feel a sense of anguish in the
inconsistency between our sta
ted aims and the consequences
they produce.
Our ongoing escalation, far
from bringing the war closer to
an end, serves rather to increase
its duration and intensity.
Our bombing of the north, far
from bringing our enemies to
their knees, serves rather to
strengthen their will to resist
us.
Our military presence in Viet
nam, far from stemming the
tide of communism, serves
rather to unite more firmly
those communist societies which
might otherwise develop sepa
rate destinies.
Our widening military involve

ment, far from demonstrating
to the world our firmness and
resolve, serves rather to make
the world suspicious of us and
fearful of our use of power.
Our unilateral action in Viet
nam, far from strengthening
our influence among other na
tions, serves rather to jeopar
dize new alliances we might be
creating.
At home, we find the war
threatening the very goals we
claim to be defending in Viet
nam. Programs to help mem
bers of minority groups realize
their own human dignity are
jeopardized if not destroyed. A
spurious type of patriotism is
challenging the right of dissent
and the open debate of public
issues. Financial and psychologi
cal preoccupation with the war
is destroying creative plans to
alleviate poverty, overcome dis
ease, extend education, replace
city slums and exalt human dig
nity. We grieve over lost oppor
tunities that may never be re
claimed.
Many of us are called upon to
counsel young men of draft age
who in conscience question our
presence in Vietnam. The moral
dilemma they face is part and
parcel of our own. Their an
guish is frequently motivated
by a high patriotism that forces
them to challenge, often at great
personal cost, policies they be
lieve will stain their nation's
honor. How can we counsel
them to participate in such a
war as this? When they decide
that they cannot condone the
war by their personal involve
ment, we must support them in
that decision.
3. Our anguish is deepened by
the discrepancy between what
we are told by our government
and what we discover is actual
ly taking- place.
We are told that the other
side gives no indication of de
sire to negotiate, and we then
discover that such indications
have been given, but that we
have responded either with re
buff or military escalation.
We are told that our nation is
prepared to negotiate with all
concerned, and we then discover
that certain of the combatants
will not be welcome at the con
ference table.
We are told that certain cities
have not been bombed, and we
then discover that they have
been.
We are told that civilian tar
gets have been avoided, ard we
then discover that they have not
been.
Such actions not only play
into the hands of those who dis
trust us, since they can consist
ently discount our word, but the
continuous discovery of discrep

ancles between our nation's
word and deed has already
shaken the confidence of our
own people in the word of their
government. We fear both the
immediate and long-range con
sequences for our nation of this
increasing deterioration of trust.
This, then, is our ongoing
anguish: a crisis of conscience
concerning what we do know,
and a crisis of confusion con
cerning what we do not know.
ni. THE NEED FOR
CLARIFICATION
The public debate is forcing
us to choose between wrong al
ternatives in Vietnam. Conse
quently, agreeing with the
American Roman Catholic
Bishops that it is "our duty to
magnify the moral voice of our
nation," we ask for clarification
of the real alternatives.
The choices usually presented
to the American people are
three (1) we could escalate rap
idly and "win the war" in the
forseeable future; or (2) we
could withdraw our troops and
accept defeat; but (3) since to
most Americans these alterna
tives are unsatisfactory, we
must continue our present
course, i.e., gradually escalate
the war until the other side
capitulates to our increasing
pressure.
We believe the realistic alter
natives are closer to the follow
ing: (1) we can continue to fight
a hard, bloody, increasingly bit
ter and frustrating war for
many years, a war we can con
ceivably "win," but at the price
of destroying the land and peo
ple we presume to liberate, of
sacrificing more and more of
our own young men to death,
of widening the probability that
other nations will enter the con
flict, of engendering increasing
ho s ti 1 i t y against ourselves
throughout the rest of the world,
and of emerging at the end with
no "victory" worth what it has
cost.
On the other hand, (2) we can
commit ourselves unequivocal
ly to seek now rather than later
for a negotiated peace, realizing
that history does not present us
with easy choices and that the
road to such a peace would be
long and torturous. Just as
there has been frustration and
heartache in our gradual escala
tion, so too there would be frus
tratation and heartache In the
development of new initiatives
leading to a negotiated peace.
Just as the risks of extending
the war are great, so too the
risks of seeking new initiatives
for negotiated peace are great.
But confronted by such a
choice, we believe the American
people will choose the path of

initiatives for negotiation, an
that the risks involved in sue
a choice are well worth takinc
And so we put these question
to our government:
1. Will you help our natlo
confront the choice between th
expansion of a war no one ca
"win" without destruction s
terrible as to negate its state
aim, and the immediate purs J
of a negotiated peace no one ca
"win" in the conventions
sense?
2. Will you make clear to a
that we are not trying to wi
through negotiation what w
have been unable to v
through military might, an
that we seek a peace
victory—a peace that can com
only on terms agreeable to a
at the conference table?
3. Will you make more cred
ble use than has yet been mad
of International agencies tI.J
could help us find ways to in
tiate negotiation?
IV. THE PRECONDITIONS O]
NEGOTIATION
The possibility of negotiatio
will depend in large part *
how such questions are ar
swered. Many in our nation a
ready feel that all efforts towar
a negotiated peace have bee
made by us, and that any fui
ther initiatives must come fror
the other side. But certain pr<
conditions that seem indisp
sible to negotiations are not y€
present in our policy, and wi*l
out them other nations ca
hardly be expected to take ser
ously our intent:
1. The first precondition is in
plied in our questions and- 'r
volves an assurance from ou
government that we are gei
uinely ready to negotiate, t > •
that we are not merely trying t
win diplomatically what w
have not won militarily. Ther
will be no reason for respons
from the other side unless *v
indicate a willingness to see,
peace without prior assuranc
that all details of the peace v J
follow our desires.
2. There must be some actio)
by our government to lend cred
bllity to our willingness to negc
tiate. It is increasingly ck.
that one indispensible prerequ
site is our willingness uncond
tionally to cease the bombing o
North Vietnam.
We are at an impasse v W<
have said we will not cease'. lh.
bombing until there is a slgi
from the other side of Willi £
ness to negotiate, and yet whei
such signs have come we hav
ignored them. They have s«it
they will give no further sign o
willingness to negotiate unti
we cease the bombing, and ye
when we have briefly ceased th«
bombing, no sign has come.
There is no way beyond thi
impasse until someone taker i
fresh initiative. We, as tn<
stronger nation, have both th<
obligation and the opportunlt:
to take that initiative.
The initiative must be uncor
ditional. Having ceased, we m» s
be prepared to wait until th<
other side responds. We have n»
reason to expect that a respond
will come soon, for it will tak«
time to gain credibility for ou
intent. In the interval, wtiilt
diplomatic channels are ex
plored, we will call upon
gious leaders in other countfie
to intercede and urge that
tive response be made.
3. If we truly do not intent
to dictate the terms of peace ii
advance, then we cannot eXcltidi
from the conference table anj
who are involved in the preStii
struggle. Our nation must ac
cept the National Liberate
Front as a partner in the peac<
talks in its own right. The pre
vious assurances of our leader;
have failed to state this clearly
4. Other conditions are aes'r
able, such as a de-escalation u
the ground war to a degree com
mensurate with the
necessary for those alreadj
there. But since the destiny o
all nations is involved in a nego
tiated peace, we must not seel
it unilaterally, but must ask
full cooperation of all agencie:
designed to deal with interna
tional tensions. These must *n
elude an increasing role for th<


DR MoAFEE BROWN
United Nations, and a recogni
tion of the potential role of the
International Control Commis
sion in reducing ground hostili
ty by providing an international
presence under cover of which
foreign troops might ultimately
be withdrawn from Vietnam.
Although we address these ap
peals particularly to our own
nation, we are fully aware that
negotiations involve more than
one participant, and we lay the
seriousness of our concern upon
all men everywhere to offer
further help in transforming
possibilities into realities.
V. RECOMMENDATIONS FOE
FURTHER ACTION
There are further steps that
Americans can take to indicate
our desire to play a creative
rather than destructive role in
the future of Vietnam.
1. Our Congressmen will short
ly begin debate on an appropri
ations bill. Their response to
that bill will say much about
our true intentions in Vietnam.
We urge that additional time be
allocated for a careful estimate
of the costs of the war by a
number of congressional com
mittees, such as the Joint Eco
nomic Committee, the Ways
and Means Committee, the Edu
cation and Labor Committee,
the Judiciary Committee and
the Foreign Affairs Committee,

in addition to the Appropria
tions Committee and the Armed
Services Committee, to deter
mine what costs are necessary
(1) to maintain the current level
of military operations, (2) to fi
nance new stages of build-up
and escalation, and (3) to pro
vide the type of military and
civilian security that would be
needed during a period of pro
longed negotiation. In this way,
members of the Congress can
choose the type and degree of
military operation they wish to
support.
2. We ask the Congress to re
examine the international agree
ments to which the United
States is pledged. To an unprec
edented degree, today's world
order and human life itself de
pend upon the exercise of con
straint in the conduct of for
eign affairs. The origin and con
duct of the war in Vietnam
must be examined in this light.
Particular attention must be fo
cused on the destruction of ci
vilian life and property, the use
of gas and other chemicals, and
the treatment of prisoners of
war. Our country must pledge
itself anew to conform policy
and practice in Vietnam to in
ternational law, as embodied in
the several agreements of Ge
neva and the Hague, the Nurem
berg judgments, the charter of
the United Nations, and other
such documents. The abandon
ment of constraint leads our
country and the world down the
path of brutalization and de
struction.
3. Our religious bodies must
assume a particular responsi
bility for prisoners of war in
both the north and south. We

call upon international religious
agencies to take the initiative in
developing effective programs
for speedy repatriation and hu
mane treatment of prisoners,
with special attention to nutri
tional and medical needs. Under
no circumstances can our na
tion condone brutal treatment
of prisoners on the ground that
the other side does so.
4. Wo must immediately sup
port efforts to insure that vic
tims of bombing and terroism,
particularly those who have
been burned by napalm, are
given proper hospitalization
wherever adequate facilities are
available, including the United
States. We welcome the forma
tion of the Committee of Re
sponsibility that is working to
this end, and urge governmen
tal support for its efforts.
We urge all religious organi
zations to follow the example of
the World Council of Churches
in arranging special offerings
for the relief of all victims of
warfare in Vietnam, whether in
the north or south, to be admin
istered through the Internation
al Red Cross or similar agen
cies.
5. At such time as negotia
tions have begun, further crea
tive opportunities should be op
ened up for both the public and
the private sectors of our na
tion. There will be need for the
development of a genuinely rep
resentative government in the
south. Members of our Congress
and our legal profession can of
fer their services, under the
auspices of Asian members of
such bodies as the International
Parliamentary Union, for what
ever counsel the Vietnamese de
sire in the development of a
constitutional assembly.
Those with special skills in
such fields as education, land
reform, housing, nutrition, med
icine and job training can be
prepared to help in Vietnam
during the long and involved
period of negotiations. The re
sources of various Catholic,
Protestant and Jewish relief
agencies can be coordinated for
these and other ventures, and
we urge foundations to support
extended opportunities for ser
vice in these areas.
We are eager that many of

our citizens pledge themselves
to acts of mercy and rebuilding
and reconciliation. These are a
particular American responsi
bility because of the deep mea
sure of American involvement
in acts of injury and destruc
tion. But such acts will have en
during meaning only when our
nation has pledged itself to seek
negotiated peace in more coura
geous terms than have yet been
undertaken. Otherwise we will
appear to be using small ges
tures of creativity to excuse
massive acts of ongoing destruc
tion.
Other projects should be ini
tiated even as negotiations pro
ceed, and we urge that further
suggestions be sent to Clergy
and Laymen Concerned About
Vietnam, 475 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York 10027, for
appropriate implementation.
In all such ventures, however,
there is a danger to which
Americans must be particularly
sensitive. We must not seek to
export the American way of
life, or impose an alien culture
on the Vietnamese. By insisting
that our help be channeled
through international agencies,
we can clarify our desire to
serve only as others choose to
use us, and not as we dictate.
We must convey by word, and
even more by deed, our desire
to let the Vietnamese be the ar
biters of their own destiny, and
insist only on such international
controls as will temporarily be
needed to insure that injustices
are prevented or properly recti
fied.
VI. OUR ONGOING
RESPONSIBILITY
We know that millions of
Americans share the anguish we
express, and endorse the alter
natives we propose. If they have
been silent heretofor, we plead
with them to speak up now, and
we pledge them our support. If
they have spoken earlier and
felt no resonance of public re
sponse, we plead with them to
speak again, so that together we
can create the new groundswell
of public outcry that will force
a reappraisal and a new direc
tion.
We reaffirm our own respon
sibility to urge that new direc
tion. We pledge to lay this burn

ing concern upon the con
sciences of our religious bodies,
through our local congregations,
our denominational agencies,
our councils of churches, and
our involvement in civic groups,
so that increasing pressure can
be brought to bear, through the
pulpit, the public forum, the
mass media, and the ballot box,
upon those in public life who
make our policy decisions.
As we face a difficult and dan
gerous period in the history of
man, we remember that our
task is not to assign blame for
the past, but to accept responsi
bility for the future; not to cast
the stone of condemnation, but
to offer the helping hand of re
conciliation; not to proceed self
righteously and vindictively,
but to walk humbly and repent
ently.
We who are so deeply in
volved in the immensity of the
present war must have the
courage to initiate the steps that
will lead to peace. If we do not
take those steps, we firmly be
lieve that God will judge us
harshly, and will hold us ac
countable for the horror we con
tinue to unleash. But if we do
turn about, if we seek to undo
whatever measure we can of the
wrong that has been done, then
we also firmly believe that as
we walk that long and hard and
often discouraging road, God
himself will be with us, to guide
and chasten and sustain us, and
that he will deign to use even
us in restoring some portion of
the divine creation we have so
grieviously misused.

ho s ti 1 i t y against ourselves
throughout the rest of the world,
and of emerging at the end with
no "victory" worth what it has
cost.
On the other hand, (2) we can
commit ourselves unequivocal
ly to seek now rather than later
for a negotiated peace, realizing
that history does not present us
with easy choices and that the
road to such a peace would be
long and torturous. Just as
there has been frustration and
heartache in our gradual escala
tion, so too there would be frus
tratation and heartache In the
development of new initiatives
leading to a negotiated peace.
Just as the risks of extending
the war are great, so too the
risks of seeking new initiatives
for negotiated peace are great.
But confronted by such a
choice, we believe the American
people will choose the path of

initiatives for negotiation, an
that the risks involved in sue
a choice are well worth takinc
And so we put these question
to our government:
1. Will you help our natlo
confront the choice between th
expansion of a war no one ca
"win" without destruction s
terrible as to negate its state
aim, and the immediate purs J
of a negotiated peace no one ca
"win" in the conventions
sense?
2. Will you make clear to a
that we are not trying to wi
through negotiation what w
have been unable to v
through military might, an
that we seek a peace
victory—a peace that can com
only on terms agreeable to a
at the conference table?
3. Will you make more cred
ble use than has yet been mad
of International agencies tI.J
could help us find ways to in
tiate negotiation?
IV. THE PRECONDITIONS O]
NEGOTIATION
The possibility of negotiatio
will depend in large part *
how such questions are ar
swered. Many in our nation a
ready feel that all efforts towar
a negotiated peace have bee
made by us, and that any fui
ther initiatives must come fror
the other side. But certain pr<
conditions that seem indisp
sible to negotiations are not y€
present in our policy, and wi*l
out them other nations ca
hardly be expected to take ser
ously our intent:
1. The first precondition is in
plied in our questions and- 'r
volves an assurance from ou
government that we are gei
uinely ready to negotiate, t > •
that we are not merely trying t
win diplomatically what w
have not won militarily. Ther
will be no reason for respons
from the other side unless *v
indicate a willingness to see,
peace without prior assuranc
that all details of the peace v J
follow our desires.
2. There must be some actio)
by our government to lend cred
bllity to our willingness to negc
tiate. It is increasingly ck.
that one indispensible prerequ
site is our willingness uncond
tionally to cease the bombing o
North Vietnam.
We are at an impasse v W<
have said we will not cease'. lh.
bombing until there is a slgi
from the other side of Willi £
ness to negotiate, and yet whei
such signs have come we hav
ignored them. They have s«it
they will give no further sign o
willingness to negotiate unti
we cease the bombing, and ye
when we have briefly ceased th«
bombing, no sign has come.
There is no way beyond thi
impasse until someone taker i
fresh initiative. We, as tn<
stronger nation, have both th<
obligation and the opportunlt:
to take that initiative.
The initiative must be uncor
ditional. Having ceased, we m» s
be prepared to wait until th<
other side responds. We have n»
reason to expect that a respond
will come soon, for it will tak«
time to gain credibility for ou
intent. In the interval, wtiilt
diplomatic channels are ex
plored, we will call upon
gious leaders in other countfie
to intercede and urge that
tive response be made.
3. If we truly do not intent
to dictate the terms of peace ii
advance, then we cannot eXcltidi
from the conference table anj
who are involved in the preStii
struggle. Our nation must ac
cept the National Liberate
Front as a partner in the peac<
talks in its own right. The pre
vious assurances of our leader;
have failed to state this clearly
4. Other conditions are aes'r
able, such as a de-escalation u
the ground war to a degree com
mensurate with the
necessary for those alreadj
there. But since the destiny o
all nations is involved in a nego
tiated peace, we must not seel
it unilaterally, but must ask
full cooperation of all agencie:
designed to deal with interna
tional tensions. These must *n
elude an increasing role for th<


DR MoAFEE BROWN
United Nations, and a recogni
tion of the potential role of the
International Control Commis
sion in reducing ground hostili
ty by providing an international
presence under cover of which
foreign troops might ultimately
be withdrawn from Vietnam.
Although we address these ap
peals particularly to our own
nation, we are fully aware that
negotiations involve more than
one participant, and we lay the
seriousness of our concern upon
all men everywhere to offer
further help in transforming
possibilities into realities.
V. RECOMMENDATIONS FOE
FURTHER ACTION
There are further steps that
Americans can take to indicate
our desire to play a creative
rather than destructive role in
the future of Vietnam.
1. Our Congressmen will short
ly begin debate on an appropri
ations bill. Their response to
that bill will say much about
our true intentions in Vietnam.
We urge that additional time be
allocated for a careful estimate
of the costs of the war by a
number of congressional com
mittees, such as the Joint Eco
nomic Committee, the Ways
and Means Committee, the Edu
cation and Labor Committee,
the Judiciary Committee and
the Foreign Affairs Committee,

in addition to the Appropria
tions Committee and the Armed
Services Committee, to deter
mine what costs are necessary
(1) to maintain the current level
of military operations, (2) to fi
nance new stages of build-up
and escalation, and (3) to pro
vide the type of military and
civilian security that would be
needed during a period of pro
longed negotiation. In this way,
members of the Congress can
choose the type and degree of
military operation they wish to
support.
2. We ask the Congress to re
examine the international agree
ments to which the United
States is pledged. To an unprec
edented degree, today's world
order and human life itself de
pend upon the exercise of con
straint in the conduct of for
eign affairs. The origin and con
duct of the war in Vietnam
must be examined in this light.
Particular attention must be fo
cused on the destruction of ci
vilian life and property, the use
of gas and other chemicals, and
the treatment of prisoners of
war. Our country must pledge
itself anew to conform policy
and practice in Vietnam to in
ternational law, as embodied in
the several agreements of Ge
neva and the Hague, the Nurem
berg judgments, the charter of
the United Nations, and other
such documents. The abandon
ment of constraint leads our
country and the world down the
path of brutalization and de
struction.
3. Our religious bodies must
assume a particular responsi
bility for prisoners of war in
both the north and south. We

call upon international religious
agencies to take the initiative in
developing effective programs
for speedy repatriation and hu
mane treatment of prisoners,
with special attention to nutri
tional and medical needs. Under
no circumstances can our na
tion condone brutal treatment
of prisoners on the ground that
the other side does so.
4. Wo must immediately sup
port efforts to insure that vic
tims of bombing and terroism,
particularly those who have
been burned by napalm, are
given proper hospitalization
wherever adequate facilities are
available, including the United
States. We welcome the forma
tion of the Committee of Re
sponsibility that is working to
this end, and urge governmen
tal support for its efforts.
We urge all religious organi
zations to follow the example of
the World Council of Churches
in arranging special offerings
for the relief of all victims of
warfare in Vietnam, whether in
the north or south, to be admin
istered through the Internation
al Red Cross or similar agen
cies.
5. At such time as negotia
tions have begun, further crea
tive opportunities should be op
ened up for both the public and
the private sectors of our na
tion. There will be need for the
development of a genuinely rep
resentative government in the
south. Members of our Congress
and our legal profession can of
fer their services, under the
auspices of Asian members of
such bodies as the International
Parliamentary Union, for what
ever counsel the Vietnamese de
sire in the development of a
constitutional assembly.
Those with special skills in
such fields as education, land
reform, housing, nutrition, med
icine and job training can be
prepared to help in Vietnam
during the long and involved
period of negotiations. The re
sources of various Catholic,
Protestant and Jewish relief
agencies can be coordinated for
these and other ventures, and
we urge foundations to support
extended opportunities for ser
vice in these areas.
We are eager that many of

our citizens pledge themselves
to acts of mercy and rebuilding
and reconciliation. These are a
particular American responsi
bility because of the deep mea
sure of American involvement
in acts of injury and destruc
tion. But such acts will have en
during meaning only when our
nation has pledged itself to seek
negotiated peace in more coura
geous terms than have yet been
undertaken. Otherwise we will
appear to be using small ges
tures of creativity to excuse
massive acts of ongoing destruc
tion.
Other projects should be ini
tiated even as negotiations pro
ceed, and we urge that further
suggestions be sent to Clergy
and Laymen Concerned About
Vietnam, 475 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York 10027, for
appropriate implementation.
In all such ventures, however,
there is a danger to which
Americans must be particularly
sensitive. We must not seek to
export the American way of
life, or impose an alien culture
on the Vietnamese. By insisting
that our help be channeled
through international agencies,
we can clarify our desire to
serve only as others choose to
use us, and not as we dictate.
We must convey by word, and
even more by deed, our desire
to let the Vietnamese be the ar
biters of their own destiny, and
insist only on such international
controls as will temporarily be
needed to insure that injustices
are prevented or properly recti
fied.
VI. OUR ONGOING
RESPONSIBILITY
We know that millions of
Americans share the anguish we
express, and endorse the alter
natives we propose. If they have
been silent heretofor, we plead
with them to speak up now, and
we pledge them our support. If
they have spoken earlier and
felt no resonance of public re
sponse, we plead with them to
speak again, so that together we
can create the new groundswell
of public outcry that will force
a reappraisal and a new direc
tion.
We reaffirm our own respon
sibility to urge that new direc
tion. We pledge to lay this burn

ing concern upon the con
sciences of our religious bodies,
through our local congregations,
our denominational agencies,
our councils of churches, and
our involvement in civic groups,
so that increasing pressure can
be brought to bear, through the
pulpit, the public forum, the
mass media, and the ballot box,
upon those in public life who
make our policy decisions.
As we face a difficult and dan
gerous period in the history of
man, we remember that our
task is not to assign blame for
the past, but to accept responsi
bility for the future; not to cast
the stone of condemnation, but
to offer the helping hand of re
conciliation; not to proceed self
righteously and vindictively,
but to walk humbly and repent
ently.
We who are so deeply in
volved in the immensity of the
present war must have the
courage to initiate the steps that
will lead to peace. If we do not
take those steps, we firmly be
lieve that God will judge us
harshly, and will hold us ac
countable for the horror we con
tinue to unleash. But if we do
turn about, if we seek to undo
whatever measure we can of the
wrong that has been done, then
we also firmly believe that as
we walk that long and hard and
often discouraging road, God
himself will be with us, to guide
and chasten and sustain us, and
that he will deign to use even
us in restoring some portion of
the divine creation we have so
grieviously misused.

Clery and Laymen Concerned
About Vietnam.)

I. THE NEED TO SPEAK
A time comes when silence is
betrayal. That time has come
for us in relation to Vietnam. As
members of American churches
and synagogues, we voice not
only our own convictions, but
seek also to articulate the un
expressed fears and longings of
millions of Americans.
The Old Testament forbids us
to prophecy "smooth things,"
and in the face of any evil, the
mandate of Albert Camus is laid
upon all men, whether religious
or not, that they "should speak
out, loud and clear, and that
they should voice their con

demnation in such a way that
never a doubt, never the sightest
doubt, could rise in the heart of
the simplest man. That they
should get away from abstrac
tion and confront the blood
stained face history has taken
on today."
Our share of responsibility
for that blood-stained face
haunts us today and prompts
our outcry. We confess that we
should have spoken sooner and
with clearer voice, but we do
speak now, hoping it is not too
late, adding our voice to the
voice of Pope Paul, the World
Council of Churches, the Syna
gogue Council of America, the
National Council of Churches,
the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops, and other reli
gious bodies, in urging a reap
praisal of our policy in Viet
nam.
Our allegiance to our nation
is held under a higher allegi
ance to the God who is sover
eign over all the nations. When
there is a conflict between those
allegiances, the priorities are
clear: "You shall have no other
gods before me." "We must
obey God rather than men."
Each day we find allegiance to
our nation's policy more diffi
cult to reconcile with allegiance
to our God.
Both the exercise of faith and
the expression of the democrat
ic privilege oblige us to make
our voices heard. For while we
speak as members of religious
communities, we also speak as
American citizens. Responsible
expression of disagreement and
dissent is the lifeblood of de
mocracy, and we speak out of a
loyalty that refuses to condone
in silence a national policy that
is leading our world toward dis
aster.
We speak in full awareness
that no easy answers are avail
able. But we believe that issues
must be pressed and questions
forced, if new answers are to be
forthcoming. For the old an
swers no longer satisfy us.

11. THE ONGOING ANGUISH
No one planned the type of
war in which we are involved.
It has slowly escalated from one
small move to the next small
move, each presumed to be the
last that would be necessary, so
that now we find our nation
able to offer only military an
swers to political and human
questions. We sympathize with
the dilemmas that face our
President and Congressmen in
dealing with a situation all de
cent men abhor. But a recogni
tion of past mistakes does not
entitle us to repeat and com
pound those mistakes by con
tinuing them on an ever-widen
ing scale.
We are unable to support our
nation's policy of military esca
lation, and we find those to
whom we minister caught as we
are in confusion and anguish be
cause of it.
1. This anguish is based first
of all on the immorality of the
warfare in Vietnam. We add our
voice to those who protest a
war in which civilian casualties
are greater than military; in
which whole populations are de
ported against their will; in
which the widespread use of
napalm and other explosives is
killing and maiming women,
children, and the aged; in which
the combatants are systemat
ically destroying the crops and
production capacity of a coun
try they profess to liberate; in
which the torturing of prisoners
by both sides has been common
place.
All who believe that man is
made in God's image must be
horrified by such crimes com
mitted against God and man.
There is guilt on all sides in
such a war as this, but the guilt
is ours far more than we have
courage to admit. We can only
tremble at the thought that God
is just.
2. Even those of us who rec
ognize that sometimes evil must
be done lest greater evil prevail,
feel a sense of anguish in the
inconsistency between our sta
ted aims and the consequences
they produce.
Our ongoing escalation, far
from bringing the war closer to
an end, serves rather to increase
its duration and intensity.
Our bombing of the north, far
from bringing our enemies to
their knees, serves rather to
strengthen their will to resist
us.
Our military presence in Viet
nam, far from stemming the
tide of communism, serves
rather to unite more firmly
those communist societies which
might otherwise develop sepa
rate destinies.
Our widening military involve

ment, far from demonstrating
to the world our firmness and
resolve, serves rather to make
the world suspicious of us and
fearful of our use of power.
Our unilateral action in Viet
nam, far from strengthening
our influence among other na
tions, serves rather to jeopar
dize new alliances we might be
creating.
At home, we find the war
threatening the very goals we
claim to be defending in Viet
nam. Programs to help mem
bers of minority groups realize
their own human dignity are
jeopardized if not destroyed. A
spurious type of patriotism is
challenging the right of dissent
and the open debate of public
issues. Financial and psychologi
cal preoccupation with the war
is destroying creative plans to
alleviate poverty, overcome dis
ease, extend education, replace
city slums and exalt human dig
nity. We grieve over lost oppor
tunities that may never be re
claimed.
Many of us are called upon to
counsel young men of draft age
who in conscience question our
presence in Vietnam. The moral
dilemma they face is part and
parcel of our own. Their an
guish is frequently motivated
by a high patriotism that forces
them to challenge, often at great
personal cost, policies they be
lieve will stain their nation's
honor. How can we counsel
them to participate in such a
war as this? When they decide
that they cannot condone the
war by their personal involve
ment, we must support them in
that decision.
3. Our anguish is deepened by
the discrepancy between what
we are told by our government
and what we discover is actual
ly taking- place.
We are told that the other
side gives no indication of de
sire to negotiate, and we then
discover that such indications
have been given, but that we
have responded either with re
buff or military escalation.
We are told that our nation is
prepared to negotiate with all
concerned, and we then discover
that certain of the combatants
will not be welcome at the con
ference table.
We are told that certain cities
have not been bombed, and we
then discover that they have
been.
We are told that civilian tar
gets have been avoided, ard we
then discover that they have not
been.
Such actions not only play
into the hands of those who dis
trust us, since they can consist
ently discount our word, but the
continuous discovery of discrep

ancles between our nation's
word and deed has already
shaken the confidence of our
own people in the word of their
government. We fear both the
immediate and long-range con
sequences for our nation of this
increasing deterioration of trust.
This, then, is our ongoing
anguish: a crisis of conscience
concerning what we do know,
and a crisis of confusion con
cerning what we do not know.
ni. THE NEED FOR
CLARIFICATION
The public debate is forcing
us to choose between wrong al
ternatives in Vietnam. Conse
quently, agreeing with the
American Roman Catholic
Bishops that it is "our duty to
magnify the moral voice of our
nation," we ask for clarification
of the real alternatives.
The choices usually presented
to the American people are
three (1) we could escalate rap
idly and "win the war" in the
forseeable future; or (2) we
could withdraw our troops and
accept defeat; but (3) since to
most Americans these alterna
tives are unsatisfactory, we
must continue our present
course, i.e., gradually escalate
the war until the other side
capitulates to our increasing
pressure.
We believe the realistic alter
natives are closer to the follow
ing: (1) we can continue to fight
a hard, bloody, increasingly bit
ter and frustrating war for
many years, a war we can con
ceivably "win," but at the price
of destroying the land and peo
ple we presume to liberate, of
sacrificing more and more of
our own young men to death,
of widening the probability that
other nations will enter the con
flict, of engendering increasing
ho s ti 1 i t y against ourselves
throughout the rest of the world,
and of emerging at the end with
no "victory" worth what it has
cost.
On the other hand, (2) we can
commit ourselves unequivocal
ly to seek now rather than later
for a negotiated peace, realizing
that history does not present us
with easy choices and that the
road to such a peace would be
long and torturous. Just as
there has been frustration and
heartache in our gradual escala
tion, so too there would be frus
tratation and heartache In the
development of new initiatives
leading to a negotiated peace.
Just as the risks of extending
the war are great, so too the
risks of seeking new initiatives
for negotiated peace are great.
But confronted by such a
choice, we believe the American
people will choose the path of

initiatives for negotiation, an
that the risks involved in sue
a choice are well worth takinc
And so we put these question
to our government:
1. Will you help our natlo
confront the choice between th
expansion of a war no one ca
"win" without destruction s
terrible as to negate its state
aim, and the immediate purs J
of a negotiated peace no one ca
"win" in the conventions
sense?
2. Will you make clear to a
that we are not trying to wi
through negotiation what w
have been unable to v
through military might, an
that we seek a peace
victory—a peace that can com
only on terms agreeable to a
at the conference table?
3. Will you make more cred
ble use than has yet been mad

could help us find ways to in

during the long and involved
period of negotiations. The re
sources of various Catholic,
Protestant and Jewish relief
agencies can be coordinated for
these and other ventures, and
we urge foundations to support
extended opportunities for ser
vice in these areas.
We are eager that many of

our citizens pledge themselves
to acts of mercy and rebuilding
and reconciliation. These are a
particular American responsi
bility because of the deep mea
sure of American involvement
in acts of injury and destruc
tion. But such acts will have en
during meaning only when our
nation has pledged itself to seek
negotiated peace in more coura
geous terms than have yet been
undertaken. Otherwise we will
appear to be using small ges
tures of creativity to excuse
massive acts of ongoing destruc
tion.
Other projects should be ini
tiated even as negotiations pro
ceed, and we urge that further
suggestions be sent to Clergy
and Laymen Concerned About
Vietnam, 475 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York 10027, for
appropriate implementation.
In all such ventures, however,
there is a danger to which
Americans must be particularly
sensitive. We must not seek to
export the American way of
life, or impose an alien culture
on the Vietnamese. By insisting
that our help be channeled
through international agencies,
we can clarify our desire to
serve only as others choose to
use us, and not as we dictate.
We must convey by word, and
even more by deed, our desire
to let the Vietnamese be the ar
biters of their own destiny, and
insist only on such international
controls as will temporarily be
needed to insure that injustices
are prevented or properly recti
fied.
VI. OUR ONGOING
RESPONSIBILITY
We know that millions of
Americans share the anguish we
express, and endorse the alter
natives we propose. If they have
been silent heretofor, we plead
with them to speak up now, and
we pledge them our support. If
they have spoken earlier and
felt no resonance of public re
sponse, we plead with them to
speak again, so that together we
can create the new groundswell
of public outcry that will force
a reappraisal and a new direc
tion.
We reaffirm our own respon
sibility to urge that new direc
tion. We pledge to lay this burn

ing concern upon the con
sciences of our religious bodies,
through our local congregations,
our denominational agencies,
our councils of churches, and
our involvement in civic groups,
so that increasing pressure can
be brought to bear, through the
pulpit, the public forum, the
mass media, and the ballot box,
upon those in public life who
make our policy decisions.
As we face a difficult and dan
gerous period in the history of
man, we remember that our
task is not to assign blame for
the past, but to accept responsi
bility for the future; not to cast
the stone of condemnation, but
to offer the helping hand of re
conciliation; not to proceed self
righteously and vindictively,
but to walk humbly and repent
ently.
We who are so deeply in
volved in the immensity of the
present war must have the
courage to initiate the steps that
will lead to peace. If we do not
take those steps, we firmly be
lieve that God will judge us
harshly, and will hold us ac
countable for the horror we con
tinue to unleash. But if we do
turn about, if we seek to undo
whatever measure we can of the
wrong that has been done, then
we also firmly believe that as
we walk that long and hard and
often discouraging road, God
himself will be with us, to guide
and chasten and sustain us, and
that he will deign to use even
us in restoring some portion of
the divine creation we have so
grieviously misused.

I. THE NEED TO SPEAK
A time comes when silence is
betrayal. That time has come
for us in relation to Vietnam. As
members of American churches
and synagogues, we voice not
only our own convictions, but
seek also to articulate the un
expressed fears and longings of
millions of Americans.
The Old Testament forbids us
to prophecy "smooth things,"
and in the face of any evil, the
mandate of Albert Camus is laid
upon all men, whether religious
or not, that they "should speak
out, loud and clear, and that
they should voice their con

demnation in such a way that
never a doubt, never the sightest
doubt, could rise in the heart of
the simplest man. That they
should get away from abstrac
tion and confront the blood
stained face history has taken
on today."
Our share of responsibility
for that blood-stained face
haunts us today and prompts
our outcry. We confess that we
should have spoken sooner and
with clearer voice, but we do
speak now, hoping it is not too
late, adding our voice to the
voice of Pope Paul, the World
Council of Churches, the Syna
gogue Council of America, the
National Council of Churches,
the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops, and other reli
gious bodies, in urging a reap
praisal of our policy in Viet
nam.
Our allegiance to our nation
is held under a higher allegi
ance to the God who is sover
eign over all the nations. When
there is a conflict between those
allegiances, the priorities are
clear: "You shall have no other
gods before me." "We must
obey God rather than men."
Each day we find allegiance to
our nation's policy more diffi
cult to reconcile with allegiance
to our God.
Both the exercise of faith and
the expression of the democrat
ic privilege oblige us to make
our voices heard. For while we
speak as members of religious
communities, we also speak as
American citizens. Responsible
expression of disagreement and
dissent is the lifeblood of de
mocracy, and we speak out of a
loyalty that refuses to condone
in silence a national policy that
is leading our world toward dis
aster.
We speak in full awareness
that no easy answers are avail
able. But we believe that issues
must be pressed and questions
forced, if new answers are to be
forthcoming. For the old an
swers no longer satisfy us.

11. THE ONGOING ANGUISH
No one planned the type of
war in which we are involved.
It has slowly escalated from one
small move to the next small
move, each presumed to be the
last that would be necessary, so
that now we find our nation
able to offer only military an
swers to political and human
questions. We sympathize with
the dilemmas that face our
President and Congressmen in
dealing with a situation all de
cent men abhor. But a recogni
tion of past mistakes does not
entitle us to repeat and com
pound those mistakes by con
tinuing them on an ever-widen
ing scale.
We are unable to support our
nation's policy of military esca
lation, and we find those to
whom we minister caught as we
are in confusion and anguish be
cause of it.
1. This anguish is based first
of all on the immorality of the
warfare in Vietnam. We add our
voice to those who protest a
war in which civilian casualties
are greater than military; in
which whole populations are de
ported against their will; in
which the widespread use of
napalm and other explosives is
killing and maiming women,
children, and the aged; in which
the combatants are systemat
ically destroying the crops and
production capacity of a coun
try they profess to liberate; in
which the torturing of prisoners
by both sides has been common
place.
All who believe that man is
made in God's image must be
horrified by such crimes com
mitted against God and man.
There is guilt on all sides in
such a war as this, but the guilt
is ours far more than we have
courage to admit. We can only
tremble at the thought that God
is just.
2. Even those of us who rec
ognize that sometimes evil must
be done lest greater evil prevail,
feel a sense of anguish in the
inconsistency between our sta
ted aims and the consequences
they produce.
Our ongoing escalation, far
from bringing the war closer to
an end, serves rather to increase
its duration and intensity.
Our bombing of the north, far
from bringing our enemies to
their knees, serves rather to
strengthen their will to resist
us.
Our military presence in Viet
nam, far from stemming the
tide of communism, serves
rather to unite more firmly
those communist societies which
might otherwise develop sepa
rate destinies.
Our widening military involve

ment, far from demonstrating
to the world our firmness and
resolve, serves rather to make
the world suspicious of us and
fearful of our use of power.
Our unilateral action in Viet
nam, far from strengthening
our influence among other na
tions, serves rather to jeopar
dize new alliances we might be
creating.
At home, we find the war
threatening the very goals we
claim to be defending in Viet
nam. Programs to help mem
bers of minority groups realize
their own human dignity are
jeopardized if not destroyed. A
spurious type of patriotism is
challenging the right of dissent
and the open debate of public
issues. Financial and psychologi
cal preoccupation with the war
is destroying creative plans to
alleviate poverty, overcome dis
ease, extend education, replace
city slums and exalt human dig
nity. We grieve over lost oppor
tunities that may never be re
claimed.
Many of us are called upon to
counsel young men of draft age
who in conscience question our
presence in Vietnam. The moral
dilemma they face is part and
parcel of our own. Their an
guish is frequently motivated
by a high patriotism that forces
them to challenge, often at great
personal cost, policies they be
lieve will stain their nation's
honor. How can we counsel
them to participate in such a
war as this? When they decide
that they cannot condone the
war by their personal involve
ment, we must support them in
that decision.
3. Our anguish is deepened by
the discrepancy between what
we are told by our government
and what we discover is actual
ly taking- place.
We are told that the other
side gives no indication of de
sire to negotiate, and we then
discover that such indications
have been given, but that we
have responded either with re
buff or military escalation.
We are told that our nation is
prepared to negotiate with all
concerned, and we then discover
that certain of the combatants
will not be welcome at the con
ference table.
We are told that certain cities
have not been bombed, and we
then discover that they have
been.
We are told that civilian tar
gets have been avoided, ard we
then discover that they have not
been.
Such actions not only play
into the hands of those who dis
trust us, since they can consist
ently discount our word, but the
continuous discovery of discrep

ancles between our nation's
word and deed has already
shaken the confidence of our
own people in the word of their
government. We fear both the
immediate and long-range con
sequences for our nation of this
increasing deterioration of trust.
This, then, is our ongoing
anguish: a crisis of conscience
concerning what we do know,
and a crisis of confusion con
cerning what we do not know.
ni. THE NEED FOR
CLARIFICATION
The public debate is forcing
us to choose between wrong al
ternatives in Vietnam. Conse
quently, agreeing with the
American Roman Catholic
Bishops that it is "our duty to
magnify the moral voice of our
nation," we ask for clarification
of the real alternatives.
The choices usually presented
to the American people are
three (1) we could escalate rap
idly and "win the war" in the
forseeable future; or (2) we
could withdraw our troops and
accept defeat; but (3) since to
most Americans these alterna
tives are unsatisfactory, we
must continue our present
course, i.e., gradually escalate
the war until the other side
capitulates to our increasing
pressure.
We believe the realistic alter
natives are closer to the follow
ing: (1) we can continue to fight
a hard, bloody, increasingly bit
ter and frustrating war for
many years, a war we can con
ceivably "win," but at the price
of destroying the land and peo
ple we presume to liberate, of
sacrificing more and more of
our own young men to death,
of widening the probability that
other nations will enter the con
flict, of engendering increasing
ho s ti 1 i t y against ourselves
throughout the rest of the world,
and of emerging at the end with
no "victory" worth what it has
cost.
On the other hand, (2) we can
commit ourselves unequivocal
ly to seek now rather than later
for a negotiated peace, realizing
that history does not present us
with easy choices and that the
road to such a peace would be
long and torturous. Just as
there has been frustration and
heartache in our gradual escala
tion, so too there would be frus
tratation and heartache In the
development of new initiatives
leading to a negotiated peace.
Just as the risks of extending
the war are great, so too the
risks of seeking new initiatives
for negotiated peace are great.
But confronted by such a
choice, we believe the American
people will choose the path of

initiatives for negotiation, an
that the risks involved in sue
a choice are well worth takinc
And so we put these question
to our government:
1. Will you help our natlo
confront the choice between th
expansion of a war no one ca
"win" without destruction s
terrible as to negate its state
aim, and the immediate purs J
of a negotiated peace no one ca
"win" in the conventions
sense?
2. Will you make clear to a
that we are not trying to wi
through negotiation what w
have been unable to v
through military might, an
that we seek a peace
victory—a peace that can com
only on terms agreeable to a
at the conference table?
3. Will you make more cred
ble use than has yet been mad
of International agencies tI.J
could help us find ways to in
tiate negotiation?
IV. THE PRECONDITIONS O]
NEGOTIATION
The possibility of negotiatio
will depend in large part *
how such questions are ar
swered. Many in our nation a
ready feel that all efforts towar
a negotiated peace have bee
made by us, and that any fui
ther initiatives must come fror
the other side. But certain pr<
conditions that seem indisp
sible to negotiations are not y€
present in our policy, and wi*l
out them other nations ca
hardly be expected to take ser
ously our intent:
1. The first precondition is in
plied in our questions and- 'r
volves an assurance from ou
government that we are gei
uinely ready to negotiate, t > •
that we are not merely trying t
win diplomatically what w
have not won militarily. Ther
will be no reason for respons
from the other side unless *v
indicate a willingness to see,
peace without prior assuranc
that all details of the peace v J
follow our desires.
2. There must be some actio)
by our government to lend cred
bllity to our willingness to negc
tiate. It is increasingly ck.
that one indispensible prerequ
site is our willingness uncond
tionally to cease the bombing o
North Vietnam.
We are at an impasse v W<
have said we will not cease'. lh.
bombing until there is a slgi
from the other side of Willi £
ness to negotiate, and yet whei
such signs have come we hav
ignored them. They have s«it
they will give no further sign o
willingness to negotiate unti
we cease the bombing, and ye
when we have briefly ceased th«
bombing, no sign has come.
There is no way beyond thi
impasse until someone taker i
fresh initiative. We, as tn<
stronger nation, have both th<
obligation and the opportunlt:
to take that initiative.
The initiative must be uncor
ditional. Having ceased, we m» s
be prepared to wait until th<
other side responds. We have n»
reason to expect that a respond
will come soon, for it will tak«
time to gain credibility for ou
intent. In the interval, wtiilt
diplomatic channels are ex
plored, we will call upon
gious leaders in other countfie
to intercede and urge that
tive response be made.
3. If we truly do not intent
to dictate the terms of peace ii
advance, then we cannot eXcltidi
from the conference table anj
who are involved in the preStii
struggle. Our nation must ac
cept the National Liberate
Front as a partner in the peac<
talks in its own right. The pre
vious assurances of our leader;
have failed to state this clearly
4. Other conditions are aes'r
able, such as a de-escalation u
the ground war to a degree com
mensurate with the
necessary for those alreadj
there. But since the destiny o
all nations is involved in a nego
tiated peace, we must not seel
it unilaterally, but must ask
full cooperation of all agencie:
designed to deal with interna
tional tensions. These must *n
elude an increasing role for th<


DR MoAFEE BROWN
United Nations, and a recogni
tion of the potential role of the
International Control Commis
sion in reducing ground hostili
ty by providing an international
presence under cover of which
foreign troops might ultimately
be withdrawn from Vietnam.
Although we address these ap
peals particularly to our own
nation, we are fully aware that
negotiations involve more than
one participant, and we lay the
seriousness of our concern upon
all men everywhere to offer
further help in transforming
possibilities into realities.
V. RECOMMENDATIONS FOE
FURTHER ACTION
There are further steps that
Americans can take to indicate
our desire to play a creative
rather than destructive role in
the future of Vietnam.
1. Our Congressmen will short
ly begin debate on an appropri
ations bill. Their response to
that bill will say much about
our true intentions in Vietnam.
We urge that additional time be
allocated for a careful estimate
of the costs of the war by a
number of congressional com
mittees, such as the Joint Eco
nomic Committee, the Ways
and Means Committee, the Edu
cation and Labor Committee,
the Judiciary Committee and
the Foreign Affairs Committee,

in addition to the Appropria
tions Committee and the Armed
Services Committee, to deter
mine what costs are necessary
(1) to maintain the current level
of military operations, (2) to fi
nance new stages of build-up
and escalation, and (3) to pro
vide the type of military and
civilian security that would be
needed during a period of pro
longed negotiation. In this way,
members of the Congress can
choose the type and degree of
military operation they wish to
support.
2. We ask the Congress to re
examine the international agree
ments to which the United
States is pledged. To an unprec
edented degree, today's world
order and human life itself de
pend upon the exercise of con
straint in the conduct of for
eign affairs. The origin and con
duct of the war in Vietnam
must be examined in this light.
Particular attention must be fo
cused on the destruction of ci
vilian life and property, the use
of gas and other chemicals, and
the treatment of prisoners of
war. Our country must pledge
itself anew to conform policy
and practice in Vietnam to in
ternational law, as embodied in
the several agreements of Ge
neva and the Hague, the Nurem
berg judgments, the charter of
the United Nations, and other
such documents. The abandon
ment of constraint leads our
country and the world down the
path of brutalization and de
struction.
3. Our religious bodies must
assume a particular responsi
bility for prisoners of war in
both the north and south. We

call upon international religious
agencies to take the initiative in
developing effective programs
for speedy repatriation and hu
mane treatment of prisoners,
with special attention to nutri
tional and medical needs. Under
no circumstances can our na
tion condone brutal treatment
of prisoners on the ground that
the other side does so.
4. Wo must immediately sup
port efforts to insure that vic
tims of bombing and terroism,
particularly those who have
been burned by napalm, are
given proper hospitalization
wherever adequate facilities are
available, including the United
States. We welcome the forma
tion of the Committee of Re
sponsibility that is working to
this end, and urge governmen
tal support for its efforts.
We urge all religious organi
zations to follow the example of
the World Council of Churches
in arranging special offerings
for the relief of all victims of
warfare in Vietnam, whether in
the north or south, to be admin
istered through the Internation
al Red Cross or similar agen
cies.
5. At such time as negotia
tions have begun, further crea
tive opportunities should be op
ened up for both the public and
the private sectors of our na
tion. There will be need for the
development of a genuinely rep
resentative government in the
south. Members of our Congress
and our legal profession can of
fer their services, under the
auspices of Asian members of
such bodies as the International
Parliamentary Union, for what
ever counsel the Vietnamese de
sire in the development of a
constitutional assembly.
Those with special skills in
such fields as education, land
reform, housing, nutrition, med
icine and job training can be
prepared to help in Vietnam
during the long and involved
period of negotiations. The re
sources of various Catholic,
Protestant and Jewish relief
agencies can be coordinated for
these and other ventures, and
we urge foundations to support
extended opportunities for ser
vice in these areas.
We are eager that many of

our citizens pledge themselves
to acts of mercy and rebuilding
and reconciliation. These are a
particular American responsi
bility because of the deep mea
sure of American involvement
in acts of injury and destruc
tion. But such acts will have en
during meaning only when our
nation has pledged itself to seek
negotiated peace in more coura
geous terms than have yet been
undertaken. Otherwise we will
appear to be using small ges
tures of creativity to excuse
massive acts of ongoing destruc
tion.
Other projects should be ini
tiated even as negotiations pro
ceed, and we urge that further
suggestions be sent to Clergy
and Laymen Concerned About
Vietnam, 475 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York 10027, for
appropriate implementation.
In all such ventures, however,
there is a danger to which
Americans must be particularly
sensitive. We must not seek to
export the American way of
life, or impose an alien culture
on the Vietnamese. By insisting
that our help be channeled
through international agencies,
we can clarify our desire to
serve only as others choose to
use us, and not as we dictate.
We must convey by word, and
even more by deed, our desire
to let the Vietnamese be the ar
biters of their own destiny, and
insist only on such international
controls as will temporarily be
needed to insure that injustices
are prevented or properly recti

our influence among other na
tions, serves rather to jeopar
dize new alliances we might be
creating.
At home, we find the war
threatening the very goals we
claim to be defending in Viet
nam. Programs to help mem
bers of minority groups realize
their own human dignity are
jeopardized if not destroyed. A
spurious type of patriotism is
challenging the right of dissent
and the open debate of public
issues. Financial and psychologi
cal preoccupation with the war
is destroying creative plans to
alleviate poverty, overcome dis
ease, extend education, replace
city slums and exalt human dig
nity. We grieve over lost oppor
tunities that may never be re
claimed.
Many of us are called upon to
counsel young men of draft age
who in conscience question our
presence in Vietnam. The moral
dilemma they face is part and
parcel of our own. Their an
guish is frequently motivated
by a high patriotism that forces
them to challenge, often at great
personal cost, policies they be
lieve will stain their nation's
honor. How can we counsel
them to participate in such a
war as this? When they decide
that they cannot condone the
war by their personal involve
ment, we must support them in
that decision.
3. Our anguish is deepened by
the discrepancy between what
we are told by our government
and what we discover is actual
ly taking- place.
We are told that the other
side gives no indication of de
sire to negotiate, and we then
discover that such indications
have been given, but that we
have responded either with re
buff or military escalation.
We are told that our nation is
prepared to negotiate with all
concerned, and we then discover
that certain of the combatants
will not be welcome at the con
ference table.
We are told that certain cities
have not been bombed, and we
then discover that they have
been.
We are told that civilian tar
gets have been avoided, ard we
then discover that they have not
been.
Such actions not only play
into the hands of those who dis
trust us, since they can consist
ently discount our word, but the
continuous discovery of discrep

ancles between our nation's
word and deed has already
shaken the confidence of our
own people in the word of their
government. We fear both the
immediate and long-range con
sequences for our nation of this
increasing deterioration of trust.
This, then, is our ongoing
anguish: a crisis of conscience
concerning what we do know,
and a crisis of confusion con
cerning what we do not know.
ni. THE NEED FOR
CLARIFICATION
The public debate is forcing
us to choose between wrong al
ternatives in Vietnam. Conse
quently, agreeing with the
American Roman Catholic
Bishops that it is "our duty to
magnify the moral voice of our
nation," we ask for clarification
of the real alternatives.
The choices usually presented
to the American people are
three (1) we could escalate rap
idly and "win the war" in the
forseeable future; or (2) we
could withdraw our troops and
accept defeat; but (3) since to
most Americans these alterna
tives are unsatisfactory, we
must continue our present
course, i.e., gradually escalate
the war until the other side
capitulates to our increasing
pressure.
We believe the realistic alter
natives are closer to the follow
ing: (1) we can continue to fight
a hard, bloody, increasingly bit
ter and frustrating war for
many years, a war we can con
ceivably "win," but at the price
of destroying the land and peo
ple we presume to liberate, of
sacrificing more and more of
our own young men to death,
of widening the probability that
other nations will enter the con
flict, of engendering increasing
ho s ti 1 i t y against ourselves
throughout the rest of the world,
and of emerging at the end with
no "victory" worth what it has
cost.
On the other hand, (2) we can
commit ourselves unequivocal
ly to seek now rather than later
for a negotiated peace, realizing
that history does not present us
with easy choices and that the
road to such a peace would be
long and torturous. Just as
there has been frustration and
heartache in our gradual escala
tion, so too there would be frus
tratation and heartache In the
development of new initiatives
leading to a negotiated peace.
Just as the risks of extending
the war are great, so too the
risks of seeking new initiatives
for negotiated peace are great.
But confronted by such a
choice, we believe the American
people will choose the path of

initiatives for negotiation, an
that the risks involved in sue
a choice are well worth takinc
And so we put these question
to our government:
1. Will you help our natlo
confront the choice between th
expansion of a war no one ca
"win" without destruction s
terrible as to negate its state
aim, and the immediate purs J
of a negotiated peace no one ca
"win" in the conventions
sense?
2. Will you make clear to a
that we are not trying to wi
through negotiation what w
have been unable to v
through military might, an
that we seek a peace
victory—a peace that can com
only on terms agreeable to a
at the conference table?
3. Will you make more cred
ble use than has yet been mad
of International agencies tI.J
could help us find ways to in
tiate negotiation?
IV. THE PRECONDITIONS O]
NEGOTIATION
The possibility of negotiatio
will depend in large part *
how such questions are ar
swered. Many in our nation a
ready feel that all efforts towar
a negotiated peace have bee
made by us, and that any fui
ther initiatives must come fror
the other side. But certain pr<
conditions that seem indisp
sible to negotiations are not y€
present in our policy, and wi*l
out them other nations ca
hardly be expected to take ser
ously our intent:
1. The first precondition is in
plied in our questions and- 'r
volves an assurance from ou
government that we are gei
uinely ready to negotiate, t > •
that we are not merely trying t
win diplomatically what w
have not won militarily. Ther
will be no reason for respons
from the other side unless *v
indicate a willingness to see,
peace without prior assuranc
that all details of the peace v J
follow our desires.
2. There must be some actio)
by our government to lend cred
bllity to our willingness to negc
tiate. It is increasingly ck.
that one indispensible prerequ
site is our willingness uncond
tionally to cease the bombing o
North Vietnam.
We are at an impasse v W<
have said we will not cease'. lh.
bombing until there is a slgi
from the other side of Willi £
ness to negotiate, and yet whei
such signs have come we hav
ignored them. They have s«it
they will give no further sign o
willingness to negotiate unti
we cease the bombing, and ye
when we have briefly ceased th«
bombing, no sign has come.
There is no way beyond thi
impasse until someone taker i
fresh initiative. We, as tn<
stronger nation, have both th<
obligation and the opportunlt:
to take that initiative.
The initiative must be uncor
ditional. Having ceased, we m» s
be prepared to wait until th<
other side responds. We have n»
reason to expect that a respond
will come soon, for it will tak«
time to gain credibility for ou
intent. In the interval, wtiilt
diplomatic channels are ex
plored, we will call upon
gious leaders in other countfie
to intercede and urge that
tive response be made.
3. If we truly do not intent
to dictate the terms of peace ii
advance, then we cannot eXcltidi
from the conference table anj
who are involved in the preStii
struggle. Our nation must ac
cept the National Liberate
Front as a partner in the peac<
talks in its own right. The pre
vious assurances of our leader;
have failed to state this clearly
4. Other conditions are aes'r
able, such as a de-escalation u
the ground war to a degree com
mensurate with the
necessary for those alreadj
there. But since the destiny o
all nations is involved in a nego
tiated peace, we must not seel
it unilaterally, but must ask
full cooperation of all agencie:
designed to deal with interna
tional tensions. These must *n
elude an increasing role for th<


DR MoAFEE BROWN
United Nations, and a recogni
tion of the potential role of the
International Control Commis
sion in reducing ground hostili
ty by providing an international
presence under cover of which
foreign troops might ultimately
be withdrawn from Vietnam.
Although we address these ap
peals particularly to our own
nation, we are fully aware that
negotiations involve more than
one participant, and we lay the
seriousness of our concern upon
all men everywhere to offer
further help in transforming
possibilities into realities.
V. RECOMMENDATIONS FOE
FURTHER ACTION
There are further steps that
Americans can take to indicate
our desire to play a creative
rather than destructive role in
the future of Vietnam.
1. Our Congressmen will short
ly begin debate on an appropri
ations bill. Their response to
that bill will say much about
our true intentions in Vietnam.
We urge that additional time be
allocated for a careful estimate
of the costs of the war by a
number of congressional com
mittees, such as the Joint Eco
nomic Committee, the Ways
and Means Committee, the Edu
cation and Labor Committee,
the Judiciary Committee and
the Foreign Affairs Committee,

in addition to the Appropria
tions Committee and the Armed
Services Committee, to deter
mine what costs are necessary
(1) to maintain the current level
of military operations, (2) to fi
nance new stages of build-up
and escalation, and (3) to pro
vide the type of military and
civilian security that would be
needed during a period of pro
longed negotiation. In this way,
members of the Congress can
choose the type and degree of
military operation they wish to
support.
2. We ask the Congress to re
examine the international agree
ments to which the United
States is pledged. To an unprec
edented degree, today's world
order and human life itself de
pend upon the exercise of con
straint in the conduct of for
eign affairs. The origin and con
duct of the war in Vietnam
must be examined in this light.
Particular attention must be fo
cused on the destruction of ci
vilian life and property, the use
of gas and other chemicals, and
the treatment of prisoners of
war. Our country must pledge
itself anew to conform policy
and practice in Vietnam to in
ternational law, as embodied in
the several agreements of Ge
neva and the Hague, the Nurem
berg judgments, the charter of
the United Nations, and other
such documents. The abandon
ment of constraint leads our
country and the world down the
path of brutalization and de
struction.
3. Our religious bodies must
assume a particular responsi
bility for prisoners of war in
both the north and south. We

call upon international religious
agencies to take the initiative in
developing effective programs
for speedy repatriation and hu
mane treatment of prisoners,
with special attention to nutri
tional and medical needs. Under
no circumstances can our na
tion condone brutal treatment
of prisoners on the ground that
the other side does so.
4. Wo must immediately sup
port efforts to insure that vic
tims of bombing and terroism,
particularly those who have
been burned by napalm, are
given proper hospitalization
wherever adequate facilities are
available, including the United
States. We welcome the forma
tion of the Committee of Re
sponsibility that is working to
this end, and urge governmen
tal support for its efforts.
We urge all religious organi
zations to follow the example of
the World Council of Churches
in arranging special offerings
for the relief of all victims of
warfare in Vietnam, whether in
the north or south, to be admin
istered through the Internation
al Red Cross or similar agen
cies.
5. At such time as negotia
tions have begun, further crea
tive opportunities should be op
ened up for both the public and
the private sectors of our na
tion. There will be need for the
development of a genuinely rep
resentative government in the
south. Members of our Congress
and our legal profession can of
fer their services, under the
auspices of Asian members of
such bodies as the International
Parliamentary Union, for what
ever counsel the Vietnamese de
sire in the development of a
constitutional assembly.
Those with special skills in
such fields as education, land
reform, housing, nutrition, med
icine and job training can be
prepared to help in Vietnam
during the long and involved
period of negotiations. The re
sources of various Catholic,
Protestant and Jewish relief
agencies can be coordinated for
these and other ventures, and
we urge foundations to support
extended opportunities for ser
vice in these areas.
We are eager that many of

our citizens pledge themselves
to acts of mercy and rebuilding
and reconciliation. These are a
particular American responsi
bility because of the deep mea
sure of American involvement
in acts of injury and destruc
tion. But such acts will have en
during meaning only when our
nation has pledged itself to seek
negotiated peace in more coura
geous terms than have yet been
undertaken. Otherwise we will
appear to be using small ges
tures of creativity to excuse
massive acts of ongoing destruc
tion.
Other projects should be ini
tiated even as negotiations pro
ceed, and we urge that further
suggestions be sent to Clergy
and Laymen Concerned About
Vietnam, 475 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York 10027, for
appropriate implementation.
In all such ventures, however,
there is a danger to which
Americans must be particularly
sensitive. We must not seek to
export the American way of
life, or impose an alien culture
on the Vietnamese. By insisting
that our help be channeled
through international agencies,
we can clarify our desire to
serve only as others choose to
use us, and not as we dictate.
We must convey by word, and
even more by deed, our desire
to let the Vietnamese be the ar
biters of their own destiny, and
insist only on such international
controls as will temporarily be
needed to insure that injustices
are prevented or properly recti
fied.
VI. OUR ONGOING
RESPONSIBILITY
We know that millions of
Americans share the anguish we
express, and endorse the alter
natives we propose. If they have
been silent heretofor, we plead
with them to speak up now, and
we pledge them our support. If
they have spoken earlier and
felt no resonance of public re
sponse, we plead with them to
speak again, so that together we
can create the new groundswell
of public outcry that will force
a reappraisal and a new direc
tion.
We reaffirm our own respon
sibility to urge that new direc
tion. We pledge to lay this burn

ing concern upon the con
sciences of our religious bodies,
through our local congregations,
our denominational agencies,
our councils of churches, and
our involvement in civic groups,
so that increasing pressure can
be brought to bear, through the
pulpit, the public forum, the
mass media, and the ballot box,
upon those in public life who
make our policy decisions.
As we face a difficult and dan
gerous period in the history of
man, we remember that our
task is not to assign blame for
the past, but to accept responsi
bility for the future; not to cast
the stone of condemnation, but
to offer the helping hand of re
conciliation; not to proceed self
righteously and vindictively,
but to walk humbly and repent
ently.
We who are so deeply in
volved in the immensity of the
present war must have the
courage to initiate the steps that
will lead to peace. If we do not
take those steps, we firmly be
lieve that God will judge us
harshly, and will hold us ac
countable for the horror we con
tinue to unleash. But if we do
turn about, if we seek to undo
whatever measure we can of the
wrong that has been done, then
we also firmly believe that as
we walk that long and hard and
often discouraging road, God
himself will be with us, to guide
and chasten and sustain us, and
that he will deign to use even
us in restoring some portion of
the divine creation we have so
grieviously misused.

Clery and Laymen Concerned
About Vietnam.)

I. THE NEED TO SPEAK
A time comes when silence is
betrayal. That time has come
for us in relation to Vietnam. As
members of American churches
and synagogues, we voice not
only our own convictions, but
seek also to articulate the un
expressed fears and longings of
millions of Americans.
The Old Testament forbids us
to prophecy "smooth things,"
and in the face of any evil, the
mandate of Albert Camus is laid
upon all men, whether religious
or not, that they "should speak
out, loud and clear, and that
they should voice their con

demnation in such a way that
never a doubt, never the sightest
doubt, could rise in the heart of
the simplest man. That they
should get away from abstrac
tion and confront the blood
stained face history has taken
on today."
Our share of responsibility
for that blood-stained face
haunts us today and prompts
our outcry. We confess that we
should have spoken sooner and
with clearer voice, but we do
speak now, hoping it is not too
late, adding our voice to the
voice of Pope Paul, the World
Council of Churches, the Syna
gogue Council of America, the
National Council of Churches,
the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops, and other reli
gious bodies, in urging a reap
praisal of our policy in Viet
nam.
Our allegiance to our nation
is held under a higher allegi
ance to the God who is sover
eign over all the nations. When
there is a conflict between those
allegiances, the priorities are
clear: "You shall have no other
gods before me." "We must
obey God rather than men."
Each day we find allegiance to
our nation's policy more diffi
cult to reconcile with allegiance
to our God.
Both the exercise of faith and
the expression of the democrat
ic privilege oblige us to make
our voices heard. For while we
speak as members of religious
communities, we also speak as
American citizens. Responsible
expression of disagreement and
dissent is the lifeblood of de
mocracy, and we speak out of a
loyalty that refuses to condone
in silence a national policy that
is leading our world toward dis
aster.
We speak in full awareness
that no easy answers are avail
able. But we believe that issues
must be pressed and questions
forced, if new answers are to be
forthcoming. For the old an
swers no longer satisfy us.

11. THE ONGOING ANGUISH
No one planned the type of
war in which we are involved.
It has slowly escalated from one
small move to the next small
move, each presumed to be the
last that would be necessary, so
that now we find our nation
able to offer only military an
swers to political and human
questions. We sympathize with
the dilemmas that face our
President and Congressmen in
dealing with a situation all de
cent men abhor. But a recogni
tion of past mistakes does not
entitle us to repeat and com
pound those mistakes by con
tinuing them on an ever-widen
ing scale.
We are unable to support our
nation's policy of military esca
lation, and we find those to
whom we minister caught as we
are in confusion and anguish be
cause of it.
1. This anguish is based first
of all on the immorality of the
warfare in Vietnam. We add our
voice to those who protest a
war in which civilian casualties
are greater than military; in
which whole populations are de
ported against their will; in
which the widespread use of
napalm and other explosives is
killing and maiming women,
children, and the aged; in which
the combatants are systemat
ically destroying the crops and
production capacity of a coun
try they profess to liberate; in
which the torturing of prisoners
by both sides has been common
place.
All who believe that man is
made in God's image must be
horrified by such crimes com
mitted against God and man.
There is guilt on all sides in
such a war as this, but the guilt
is ours far more than we have
courage to admit. We can only
tremble at the thought that God
is just.
2. Even those of us who rec
ognize that sometimes evil must
be done lest greater evil prevail,
feel a sense of anguish in the
inconsistency between our sta
ted aims and the consequences
they produce.
Our ongoing escalation, far
from bringing the war closer to
an end, serves rather to increase
its duration and intensity.
Our bombing of the north, far
from bringing our enemies to
their knees, serves rather to
strengthen their will to resist
us.
Our military presence in Viet
nam, far from stemming the
tide of communism, serves
rather to unite more firmly
those communist societies which
might otherwise develop sepa
rate destinies.
Our widening military involve

ment, far from demonstrating
to the world our firmness and
resolve, serves rather to make
the world suspicious of us and
fearful of our use of power.
Our unilateral action in Viet
nam, far from strengthening
our influence among other na
tions, serves rather to jeopar
dize new alliances we might be
creating.
At home, we find the war
threatening the very goals we
claim to be defending in Viet
nam. Programs to help mem
bers of minority groups realize
their own human dignity are
jeopardized if not destroyed. A
spurious type of patriotism is
challenging the right of dissent
and the open debate of public
issues. Financial and psychologi
cal preoccupation with the war
is destroying creative plans to
alleviate poverty, overcome dis
ease, extend education, replace
city slums and exalt human dig
nity. We grieve over lost oppor
tunities that may never be re
claimed.
Many of us are called upon to
counsel young men of draft age
who in conscience question our
presence in Vietnam. The moral
dilemma they face is part and
parcel of our own. Their an
guish is frequently motivated
by a high patriotism that forces
them to challenge, often at great
personal cost, policies they be
lieve will stain their nation's
honor. How can we counsel
them to participate in such a
war as this? When they decide
that they cannot condone the
war by their personal involve
ment, we must support them in
that decision.
3. Our anguish is deepened by
the discrepancy between what
we are told by our government
and what we discover is actual
ly taking- place.
We are told that the other
side gives no indication of de
sire to negotiate, and we then
discover that such indications
have been given, but that we
have responded either with re
buff or military escalation.
We are told that our nation is
prepared to negotiate with all
concerned, and we then discover
that certain of the combatants
will not be welcome at the con
ference table.
We are told that certain cities
have not been bombed, and we
then discover that they have
been.
We are told that civilian tar
gets have been avoided, ard we
then discover that they have not
been.
Such actions not only play
into the hands of those who dis
trust us, since they can consist
ently discount our word, but the
continuous discovery of discrep

ancles between our nation's
word and deed has already
shaken the confidence of our
own people in the word of their
government. We fear both the
immediate and long-range con
sequences for our nation of this
increasing deterioration of trust.
This, then, is our ongoing
anguish: a crisis of conscience
concerning what we do know,
and a crisis of confusion con
cerning what we do not know.
ni. THE NEED FOR

us to choose between wrong al

American Roman Catholic

of the real alternatives.
The choices usually presented

accept defeat; but (3) since to
most Americans these alterna

We believe the realistic alter

that the risks involved in sue

And so we put these question
to our government:

our desire to play a creative
rather than destructive role in
the future of Vietnam.
1. Our Congressmen will short
ly begin debate on an appropri
ations bill. Their response to
that bill will say much about
our true intentions in Vietnam.
We urge that additional time be
allocated for a careful estimate
of the costs of the war by a
number of congressional com
mittees, such as the Joint Eco
nomic Committee, the Ways
and Means Committee, the Edu
cation and Labor Committee,
the Judiciary Committee and
the Foreign Affairs Committee,

in addition to the Appropria
tions Committee and the Armed
Services Committee, to deter
mine what costs are necessary
(1) to maintain the current level
of military operations, (2) to fi
nance new stages of build-up
and escalation, and (3) to pro
vide the type of military and
civilian security that would be
needed during a period of pro
longed negotiation. In this way,
members of the Congress can
choose the type and degree of
military operation they wish to
support.
2. We ask the Congress to re
examine the international agree
ments to which the United
States is pledged. To an unprec
edented degree, today's world
order and human life itself de
pend upon the exercise of con
straint in the conduct of for
eign affairs. The origin and con
duct of the war in Vietnam
must be examined in this light.
Particular attention must be fo
cused on the destruction of ci
vilian life and property, the use
of gas and other chemicals, and
the treatment of prisoners of
war. Our country must pledge
itself anew to conform policy
and practice in Vietnam to in
ternational law, as embodied in
the several agreements of Ge
neva and the Hague, the Nurem
berg judgments, the charter of
the United Nations, and other
such documents. The abandon
ment of constraint leads our
country and the world down the
path of brutalization and de
struction.
3. Our religious bodies must
assume a particular responsi
bility for prisoners of war in
both the north and south. We

call upon international religious
agencies to take the initiative in
developing effective programs
for speedy repatriation and hu
mane treatment of prisoners,
with special attention to nutri
tional and medical needs. Under
no circumstances can our na
tion condone brutal treatment
of prisoners on the ground that
the other side does so.
4. Wo must immediately sup
port efforts to insure that vic
tims of bombing and terroism,
particularly those who have
been burned by napalm, are
given proper hospitalization
wherever adequate facilities are
available, including the United
States. We welcome the forma
tion of the Committee of Re
sponsibility that is working to
this end, and urge governmen
tal support for its efforts.
We urge all religious organi
zations to follow the example of
the World Council of Churches
in arranging special offerings
for the relief of all victims of
warfare in Vietnam, whether in
the north or south, to be admin
istered through the Internation
al Red Cross or similar agen
cies.
5. At such time as negotia
tions have begun, further crea
tive opportunities should be op
ened up for both the public and
the private sectors of our na
tion. There will be need for the
development of a genuinely rep
resentative government in the
south. Members of our Congress
and our legal profession can of
fer their services, under the
auspices of Asian members of
such bodies as the International
Parliamentary Union, for what
ever counsel the Vietnamese de
sire in the development of a
constitutional assembly.
Those with special skills in
such fields as education, land
reform, housing, nutrition, med
icine and job training can be
prepared to help in Vietnam
during the long and involved
period of negotiations. The re
sources of various Catholic,
Protestant and Jewish relief
agencies can be coordinated for
these and other ventures, and
we urge foundations to support
extended opportunities for ser
vice in these areas.
We are eager that many of

our citizens pledge themselves
to acts of mercy and rebuilding
and reconciliation. These are a
particular American responsi
bility because of the deep mea
sure of American involvement
in acts of injury and destruc
tion. But such acts will have en
during meaning only when our
nation has pledged itself to seek
negotiated peace in more coura
geous terms than have yet been
undertaken. Otherwise we will
appear to be using small ges
tures of creativity to excuse
massive acts of ongoing destruc
tion.
Other projects should be ini
tiated even as negotiations pro
ceed, and we urge that further
suggestions be sent to Clergy
and Laymen Concerned About
Vietnam, 475 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York 10027, for
appropriate implementation.
In all such ventures, however,
there is a danger to which
Americans must be particularly
sensitive. We must not seek to
export the American way of
life, or impose an alien culture
on the Vietnamese. By insisting
that our help be channeled
through international agencies,
we can clarify our desire to
serve only as others choose to
use us, and not as we dictate.
We must convey by word, and
even more by deed, our desire
to let the Vietnamese be the ar
biters of their own destiny, and
insist only on such international
controls as will temporarily be
needed to insure that injustices
are prevented or properly recti
fied.
VI. OUR ONGOING
RESPONSIBILITY
We know that millions of
Americans share the anguish we
express, and endorse the alter
natives we propose. If they have
been silent heretofor, we plead
with them to speak up now, and
we pledge them our support. If
they have spoken earlier and
felt no resonance of public re
sponse, we plead with them to
speak again, so that together we
can create the new groundswell
of public outcry that will force
a reappraisal and a new direc
tion.
We reaffirm our own respon
sibility to urge that new direc
tion. We pledge to lay this burn

ing concern upon the con
sciences of our religious bodies,
through our local congregations,
our denominational agencies,
our councils of churches, and
our involvement in civic groups,
so that increasing pressure can
be brought to bear, through the
pulpit, the public forum, the
mass media, and the ballot box,
upon those in public life who
make our policy decisions.
As we face a difficult and dan
gerous period in the history of
man, we remember that our
task is not to assign blame for
the past, but to accept responsi
bility for the future; not to cast
the stone of condemnation, but
to offer the helping hand of re
conciliation; not to proceed self
righteously and vindictively,
but to walk humbly and repent
ently.
We who are so deeply in
volved in the immensity of the
present war must have the
courage to initiate the steps that
will lead to peace. If we do not
take those steps, we firmly be
lieve that God will judge us
harshly, and will hold us ac
countable for the horror we con
tinue to unleash. But if we do
turn about, if we seek to undo
whatever measure we can of the
wrong that has been done, then
we also firmly believe that as
we walk that long and hard and
often discouraging road, God
himself will be with us, to guide
and chasten and sustain us, and
that he will deign to use even
us in restoring some portion of
the divine creation we have so
grieviously misused.

I. THE NEED TO SPEAK
A time comes when silence is
betrayal. That time has come
for us in relation to Vietnam. As
members of American churches
and synagogues, we voice not
only our own convictions, but
seek also to articulate the un
expressed fears and longings of
millions of Americans.
The Old Testament forbids us
to prophecy "smooth things,"
and in the face of any evil, the
mandate of Albert Camus is laid
upon all men, whether religious
or not, that they "should speak
out, loud and clear, and that
they should voice their con

demnation in such a way that
never a doubt, never the sightest
doubt, could rise in the heart of
the simplest man. That they
should get away from abstrac
tion and confront the blood
stained face history has taken
on today."
Our share of responsibility
for that blood-stained face
haunts us today and prompts
our outcry. We confess that we
should have spoken sooner and
with clearer voice, but we do
speak now, hoping it is not too
late, adding our voice to the
voice of Pope Paul, the World
Council of Churches, the Syna
gogue Council of America, the
National Council of Churches,
the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops, and other reli
gious bodies, in urging a reap
praisal of our policy in Viet
nam.
Our allegiance to our nation
is held under a higher allegi
ance to the God who is sover
eign over all the nations. When
there is a conflict between those
allegiances, the priorities are
clear: "You shall have no other
gods before me." "We must
obey God rather than men."
Each day we find allegiance to
our nation's policy more diffi
cult to reconcile with allegiance
to our God.
Both the exercise of faith and
the expression of the democrat
ic privilege oblige us to make
our voices heard. For while we
speak as members of religious
communities, we also speak as
American citizens. Responsible
expression of disagreement and
dissent is the lifeblood of de
mocracy, and we speak out of a
loyalty that refuses to condone
in silence a national policy that
is leading our world toward dis
aster.
We speak in full awareness
that no easy answers are avail
able. But we believe that issues
must be pressed and questions
forced, if new answers are to be
forthcoming. For the old an
swers no longer satisfy us.

11. THE ONGOING ANGUISH
No one planned the type of
war in which we are involved.
It has slowly escalated from one
small move to the next small
move, each presumed to be the
last that would be necessary, so
that now we find our nation
able to offer only military an
swers to political and human
questions. We sympathize with
the dilemmas that face our
President and Congressmen in
dealing with a situation all de
cent men abhor. But a recogni
tion of past mistakes does not
entitle us to repeat and com
pound those mistakes by con
tinuing them on an ever-widen
ing scale.
We are unable to support our
nation's policy of military esca
lation, and we find those to
whom we minister caught as we
are in confusion and anguish be
cause of it.
1. This anguish is based first
of all on the immorality of the
warfare in Vietnam. We add our
voice to those who protest a
war in which civilian casualties
are greater than military; in
which whole populations are de
ported against their will; in
which the widespread use of
napalm and other explosives is
killing and maiming women,
children, and the aged; in which
the combatants are systemat
ically destroying the crops and
production capacity of a coun
try they profess to liberate; in
which the torturing of prisoners
by both sides has been common
place.
All who believe that man is
made in God's image must be
horrified by such crimes com
mitted against God and man.
There is guilt on all sides in
such a war as this, but the guilt
is ours far more than we have
courage to admit. We can only
tremble at the thought that God
is just.
2. Even those of us who rec
ognize that sometimes evil must
be done lest greater evil prevail,
feel a sense of anguish in the
inconsistency between our sta
ted aims and the consequences
they produce.
Our ongoing escalation, far
from bringing the war closer to
an end, serves rather to increase
its duration and intensity.
Our bombing of the north, far
from bringing our enemies to
their knees, serves rather to
strengthen their will to resist
us.
Our military presence in Viet
nam, far from stemming the
tide of communism, serves
rather to unite more firmly
those communist societies which
might otherwise develop sepa
rate destinies.
Our widening military involve

ment, far from demonstrating
to the world our firmness and
resolve, serves rather to make
the world suspicious of us and
fearful of our use of power.
Our unilateral action in Viet
nam, far from strengthening
our influence among other na
tions, serves rather to jeopar
dize new alliances we might be
creating.
At home, we find the war
threatening the very goals we
claim to be defending in Viet
nam. Programs to help mem
bers of minority groups realize
their own human dignity are
jeopardized if not destroyed. A
spurious type of patriotism is
challenging the right of dissent
and the open debate of public
issues. Financial and psychologi
cal preoccupation with the war
is destroying creative plans to
alleviate poverty, overcome dis
ease, extend education, replace
city slums and exalt human dig
nity. We grieve over lost oppor
tunities that may never be re
claimed.
Many of us are called upon to
counsel young men of draft age
who in conscience question our
presence in Vietnam. The moral
dilemma they face is part and
parcel of our own. Their an
guish is frequently motivated
by a high patriotism that forces
them to challenge, often at great
personal cost, policies they be
lieve will stain their nation's
honor. How can we counsel
them to participate in such a
war as this? When they decide
that they cannot condone the
war by their personal involve
ment, we must support them in
that decision.
3. Our anguish is deepened by
the discrepancy between what
we are told by our government
and what we discover is actual
ly taking- place.
We are told that the other
side gives no indication of de
sire to negotiate, and we then
discover that such indications
have been given, but that we
have responded either with re
buff or military escalation.
We are told that our nation is
prepared to negotiate with all
concerned, and we then discover
that certain of the combatants
will not be welcome at the con
ference table.
We are told that certain cities
have not been bombed, and we
then discover that they have
been.
We are told that civilian tar
gets have been avoided, ard we
then discover that they have not
been.
Such actions not only play
into the hands of those who dis
trust us, since they can consist
ently discount our word, but the
continuous discovery of discrep

ancles between our nation's
word and deed has already
shaken the confidence of our
own people in the word of their
government. We fear both the
immediate and long-range con
sequences for our nation of this
increasing deterioration of trust.
This, then, is our ongoing
anguish: a crisis of conscience
concerning what we do know,
and a crisis of confusion con
cerning what we do not know.
ni. THE NEED FOR
CLARIFICATION
The public debate is forcing
us to choose between wrong al
ternatives in Vietnam. Conse
quently, agreeing with the
American Roman Catholic
Bishops that it is "our duty to
magnify the moral voice of our
nation," we ask for clarification
of the real alternatives.
The choices usually presented
to the American people are
three (1) we could escalate rap
idly and "win the war" in the
forseeable future; or (2) we
could withdraw our troops and
accept defeat; but (3) since to
most Americans these alterna
tives are unsatisfactory, we
must continue our present
course, i.e., gradually escalate
the war until the other side
capitulates to our increasing
pressure.
We believe the realistic alter
natives are closer to the follow
ing: (1) we can continue to fight
a hard, bloody, increasingly bit
ter and frustrating war for
many years, a war we can con
ceivably "win," but at the price
of destroying the land and peo
ple we presume to liberate, of
sacrificing more and more of
our own young men to death,
of widening the probability that
other nations will enter the con
flict, of engendering increasing
ho s ti 1 i t y against ourselves
throughout the rest of the world,
and of emerging at the end with
no "victory" worth what it has
cost.
On the other hand, (2) we can
commit ourselves unequivocal
ly to seek now rather than later
for a negotiated peace, realizing
that history does not present us
with easy choices and that the
road to such a peace would be
long and torturous. Just as
there has been frustration and
heartache in our gradual escala
tion, so too there would be frus
tratation and heartache In the
development of new initiatives
leading to a negotiated peace.
Just as the risks of extending
the war are great, so too the
risks of seeking new initiatives
for negotiated peace are great.
But confronted by such a
choice, we believe the American
people will choose the path of

initiatives for negotiation, an
that the risks involved in sue
a choice are well worth takinc
And so we put these question
to our government:
1. Will you help our natlo
confront the choice between th
expansion of a war no one ca
"win" without destruction s
terrible as to negate its state
aim, and the immediate purs J
of a negotiated peace no one ca
"win" in the conventions
sense?
2. Will you make clear to a
that we are not trying to wi
through negotiation what w
have been unable to v
through military might, an
that we seek a peace
victory—a peace that can com
only on terms agreeable to a
at the conference table?
3. Will you make more cred
ble use than has yet been mad
of International agencies tI.J
could help us find ways to in
tiate negotiation?
IV. THE PRECONDITIONS O]
NEGOTIATION
The possibility of negotiatio
will depend in large part *
how such questions are ar
swered. Many in our nation a
ready feel that all efforts towar
a negotiated peace have bee
made by us, and that any fui
ther initiatives must come fror
the other side. But certain pr<
conditions that seem indisp
sible to negotiations are not y€
present in our policy, and wi*l
out them other nations ca
hardly be expected to take ser
ously our intent:
1. The first precondition is in
plied in our questions and- 'r
volves an assurance from ou
government that we are gei
uinely ready to negotiate, t > •
that we are not merely trying t
win diplomatically what w
have not won militarily. Ther
will be no reason for respons
from the other side unless *v
indicate a willingness to see,
peace without prior assuranc
that all details of the peace v J
follow our desires.
2. There must be some actio)
by our government to lend cred
bllity to our willingness to negc
tiate. It is increasingly ck.
that one indispensible prerequ
site is our willingness uncond
tionally to cease the bombing o
North Vietnam.
We are at an impasse v W<
have said we will not cease'. lh.
bombing until there is a slgi
from the other side of Willi £
ness to negotiate, and yet whei
such signs have come we hav
ignored them. They have s«it
they will give no further sign o
willingness to negotiate unti
we cease the bombing, and ye
when we have briefly ceased th«
bombing, no sign has come.
There is no way beyond thi
impasse until someone taker i
fresh initiative. We, as tn<
stronger nation, have both th<
obligation and the opportunlt:
to take that initiative.
The initiative must be uncor
ditional. Having ceased, we m» s
be prepared to wait until th<
other side responds. We have n»
reason to expect that a respond
will come soon, for it will tak«
time to gain credibility for ou
intent. In the interval, wtiilt
diplomatic channels are ex
plored, we will call upon
gious leaders in other countfie
to intercede and urge that
tive response be made.
3. If we truly do not intent
to dictate the terms of peace ii
advance, then we cannot eXcltidi
from the conference table anj
who are involved in the preStii
struggle. Our nation must ac
cept the National Liberate
Front as a partner in the peac<
talks in its own right. The pre
vious assurances of our leader;
have failed to state this clearly
4. Other conditions are aes'r
able, such as a de-escalation u
the ground war to a degree com
mensurate with the
necessary for those alreadj
there. But since the destiny o
all nations is involved in a nego
tiated peace, we must not seel
it unilaterally, but must ask
full cooperation of all agencie:
designed to deal with interna
tional tensions. These must *n
elude an increasing role for th<


DR MoAFEE BROWN
United Nations, and a recogni
tion of the potential role of the
International Control Commis
sion in reducing ground hostili
ty by providing an international
presence under cover of which
foreign troops might ultimately
be withdrawn from Vietnam.
Although we address these ap
peals particularly to our own
nation, we are fully aware that
negotiations involve more than
one participant, and we lay the
seriousness of our concern upon
all men everywhere to offer
further help in transforming
possibilities into realities.
V. RECOMMENDATIONS FOE
FURTHER ACTION
There are further steps that
Americans can take to indicate
our desire to play a creative
rather than destructive role in
the future of Vietnam.
1. Our Congressmen will short
ly begin debate on an appropri
ations bill. Their response to
that bill will say much about
our true intentions in Vietnam.
We urge that additional time be
allocated for a careful estimate
of the costs of the war by a
number of congressional com
mittees, such as the Joint Eco

and Means Committee, the Edu

the Judiciary Committee and
the Foreign Affairs Committee,

in addition to the Appropria
tions Committee and the Armed
Services Committee, to deter
mine what costs are necessary
(1) to maintain the current level
of military operations, (2) to fi
nance new stages of build-up
and escalation, and (3) to pro
vide the type of military and
civilian security that would be
needed during a period of pro
longed negotiation. In this way,
members of the Congress can
choose the type and degree of
military operation they wish to
support.
2. We ask the Congress to re
examine the international agree
ments to which the United
States is pledged. To an unprec
edented degree, today's world
order and human life itself de
pend upon the exercise of con
straint in the conduct of for

must be examined in this light.
Particular attention must be fo

country and the world down the
path of brutalization and de

3. Our religious bodies must
assume a particular responsi

both the north and south. We

call upon international religious

developing effective programs
for speedy repatriation and hu

with special attention to nutri

no circumstances can our na

of prisoners on the ground that
the other side does so.
4. Wo must immediately sup

gious bodies, in urging a reap
praisal of our policy in Viet
nam.
Our allegiance to our nation
is held under a higher allegi
ance to the God who is sover
eign over all the nations. When
there is a conflict between those
allegiances, the priorities are
clear: "You shall have no other
gods before me." "We must
obey God rather than men."
Each day we find allegiance to
our nation's policy more diffi
cult to reconcile with allegiance
to our God.
Both the exercise of faith and
the expression of the democrat
ic privilege oblige us to make
our voices heard. For while we
speak as members of religious
communities, we also speak as
American citizens. Responsible
expression of disagreement and
dissent is the lifeblood of de
mocracy, and we speak out of a
loyalty that refuses to condone
in silence a national policy that
is leading our world toward dis
aster.
We speak in full awareness
that no easy answers are avail
able. But we believe that issues
must be pressed and questions
forced, if new answers are to be
forthcoming. For the old an
swers no longer satisfy us.

11. THE ONGOING ANGUISH
No one planned the type of
war in which we are involved.
It has slowly escalated from one
small move to the next small
move, each presumed to be the
last that would be necessary, so
that now we find our nation
able to offer only military an
swers to political and human
questions. We sympathize with
the dilemmas that face our
President and Congressmen in
dealing with a situation all de
cent men abhor. But a recogni
tion of past mistakes does not
entitle us to repeat and com
pound those mistakes by con
tinuing them on an ever-widen
ing scale.
We are unable to support our
nation's policy of military esca
lation, and we find those to
whom we minister caught as we
are in confusion and anguish be
cause of it.
1. This anguish is based first
of all on the immorality of the
warfare in Vietnam. We add our
voice to those who protest a
war in which civilian casualties
are greater than military; in
which whole populations are de
ported against their will; in
which the widespread use of
napalm and other explosives is
killing and maiming women,
children, and the aged; in which
the combatants are systemat
ically destroying the crops and
production capacity of a coun
try they profess to liberate; in
which the torturing of prisoners
by both sides has been common
place.
All who believe that man is
made in God's image must be
horrified by such crimes com
mitted against God and man.
There is guilt on all sides in
such a war as this, but the guilt
is ours far more than we have
courage to admit. We can only
tremble at the thought that God
is just.
2. Even those of us who rec
ognize that sometimes evil must
be done lest greater evil prevail,
feel a sense of anguish in the
inconsistency between our sta
ted aims and the consequences
they produce.
Our ongoing escalation, far
from bringing the war closer to
an end, serves rather to increase
its duration and intensity.
Our bombing of the north, far
from bringing our enemies to
their knees, serves rather to
strengthen their will to resist
us.
Our military presence in Viet
nam, far from stemming the
tide of communism, serves
rather to unite more firmly
those communist societies which
might otherwise develop sepa
rate destinies.
Our widening military involve

ment, far from demonstrating
to the world our firmness and
resolve, serves rather to make
the world suspicious of us and
fearful of our use of power.
Our unilateral action in Viet
nam, far from strengthening
our influence among other na
tions, serves rather to jeopar
dize new alliances we might be
creating.
At home, we find the war
threatening the very goals we
claim to be defending in Viet
nam. Programs to help mem
bers of minority groups realize
their own human dignity are
jeopardized if not destroyed. A
spurious type of patriotism is
challenging the right of dissent
and the open debate of public
issues. Financial and psychologi
cal preoccupation with the war
is destroying creative plans to
alleviate poverty, overcome dis
ease, extend education, replace
city slums and exalt human dig
nity. We grieve over lost oppor
tunities that may never be re
claimed.
Many of us are called upon to
counsel young men of draft age
who in conscience question our
presence in Vietnam. The moral
dilemma they face is part and
parcel of our own. Their an
guish is frequently motivated
by a high patriotism that forces
them to challenge, often at great
personal cost, policies they be
lieve will stain their nation's
honor. How can we counsel
them to participate in such a
war as this? When they decide
that they cannot condone the
war by their personal involve
ment, we must support them in
that decision.
3. Our anguish is deepened by
the discrepancy between what
we are told by our government
and what we discover is actual
ly taking- place.
We are told that the other
side gives no indication of de
sire to negotiate, and we then
discover that such indications
have been given, but that we
have responded either with re
buff or military escalation.
We are told that our nation is
prepared to negotiate with all
concerned, and we then discover
that certain of the combatants
will not be welcome at the con
ference table.
We are told that certain cities
have not been bombed, and we
then discover that they have
been.
We are told that civilian tar
gets have been avoided, ard we
then discover that they have not
been.
Such actions not only play
into the hands of those who dis
trust us, since they can consist
ently discount our word, but the
continuous discovery of discrep

ancles between our nation's
word and deed has already
shaken the confidence of our
own people in the word of their
government. We fear both the
immediate and long-range con
sequences for our nation of this
increasing deterioration of trust.
This, then, is our ongoing
anguish: a crisis of conscience
concerning what we do know,
and a crisis of confusion con
cerning what we do not know.
ni. THE NEED FOR
CLARIFICATION
The public debate is forcing
us to choose between wrong al
ternatives in Vietnam. Conse
quently, agreeing with the
American Roman Catholic
Bishops that it is "our duty to
magnify the moral voice of our
nation," we ask for clarification
of the real alternatives.
The choices usually presented
to the American people are
three (1) we could escalate rap
idly and "win the war" in the
forseeable future; or (2) we
could withdraw our troops and
accept defeat; but (3) since to
most Americans these alterna
tives are unsatisfactory, we
must continue our present
course, i.e., gradually escalate
the war until the other side
capitulates to our increasing
pressure.
We believe the realistic alter
natives are closer to the follow
ing: (1) we can continue to fight
a hard, bloody, increasingly bit
ter and frustrating war for
many years, a war we can con
ceivably "win," but at the price
of destroying the land and peo
ple we presume to liberate, of
sacrificing more and more of
our own young men to death,
of widening the probability that
other nations will enter the con
flict, of engendering increasing
ho s ti 1 i t y against ourselves
throughout the rest of the world,
and of emerging at the end with
no "victory" worth what it has
cost.
On the other hand, (2) we can
commit ourselves unequivocal
ly to seek now rather than later
for a negotiated peace, realizing
that history does not present us
with easy choices and that the
road to such a peace would be
long and torturous. Just as
there has been frustration and
heartache in our gradual escala
tion, so too there would be frus
tratation and heartache In the
development of new initiatives
leading to a negotiated peace.
Just as the risks of extending
the war are great, so too the
risks of seeking new initiatives
for negotiated peace are great.
But confronted by such a
choice, we believe the American
people will choose the path of

initiatives for negotiation, an
that the risks involved in sue
a choice are well worth takinc
And so we put these question
to our government:
1. Will you help our natlo
confront the choice between th
expansion of a war no one ca
"win" without destruction s
terrible as to negate its state
aim, and the immediate purs J
of a negotiated peace no one ca
"win" in the conventions
sense?
2. Will you make clear to a
that we are not trying to wi
through negotiation what w
have been unable to v
through military might, an
that we seek a peace
victory—a peace that can com
only on terms agreeable to a
at the conference table?
3. Will you make more cred
ble use than has yet been mad
of International agencies tI.J
could help us find ways to in
tiate negotiation?
IV. THE PRECONDITIONS O]
NEGOTIATION
The possibility of negotiatio
will depend in large part *
how such questions are ar
swered. Many in our nation a
ready feel that all efforts towar
a negotiated peace have bee
made by us, and that any fui
ther initiatives must come fror
the other side. But certain pr<
conditions that seem indisp
sible to negotiations are not y€
present in our policy, and wi*l
out them other nations ca
hardly be expected to take ser
ously our intent:
1. The first precondition is in
plied in our questions and- 'r
volves an assurance from ou
government that we are gei
uinely ready to negotiate, t > •
that we are not merely trying t
win diplomatically what w
have not won militarily. Ther
will be no reason for respons
from the other side unless *v
indicate a willingness to see,
peace without prior assuranc
that all details of the peace v J
follow our desires.
2. There must be some actio)
by our government to lend cred
bllity to our willingness to negc
tiate. It is increasingly ck.
that one indispensible prerequ
site is our willingness uncond
tionally to cease the bombing o
North Vietnam.
We are at an impasse v W<
have said we will not cease'. lh.
bombing until there is a slgi
from the other side of Willi £
ness to negotiate, and yet whei
such signs have come we hav
ignored them. They have s«it
they will give no further sign o
willingness to negotiate unti
we cease the bombing, and ye
when we have briefly ceased th«
bombing, no sign has come.
There is no way beyond thi
impasse until someone taker i
fresh initiative. We, as tn<
stronger nation, have both th<
obligation and the opportunlt:
to take that initiative.
The initiative must be uncor
ditional. Having ceased, we m» s
be prepared to wait until th<
other side responds. We have n»
reason to expect that a respond
will come soon, for it will tak«
time to gain credibility for ou
intent. In the interval, wtiilt
diplomatic channels are ex
plored, we will call upon
gious leaders in other countfie
to intercede and urge that
tive response be made.
3. If we truly do not intent
to dictate the terms of peace ii
advance, then we cannot eXcltidi
from the conference table anj
who are involved in the preStii
struggle. Our nation must ac
cept the National Liberate
Front as a partner in the peac<
talks in its own right. The pre
vious assurances of our leader;
have failed to state this clearly
4. Other conditions are aes'r
able, such as a de-escalation u
the ground war to a degree com
mensurate with the
necessary for those alreadj
there. But since the destiny o
all nations is involved in a nego
tiated peace, we must not seel
it unilaterally, but must ask
full cooperation of all agencie:
designed to deal with interna
tional tensions. These must *n
elude an increasing role for th<


DR MoAFEE BROWN
United Nations, and a recogni
tion of the potential role of the
International Control Commis
sion in reducing ground hostili
ty by providing an international
presence under cover of which
foreign troops might ultimately
be withdrawn from Vietnam.
Although we address these ap
peals particularly to our own
nation, we are fully aware that
negotiations involve more than
one participant, and we lay the
seriousness of our concern upon
all men everywhere to offer
further help in transforming
possibilities into realities.
V. RECOMMENDATIONS FOE
FURTHER ACTION
There are further steps that
Americans can take to indicate
our desire to play a creative
rather than destructive role in
the future of Vietnam.
1. Our Congressmen will short
ly begin debate on an appropri
ations bill. Their response to
that bill will say much about
our true intentions in Vietnam.
We urge that additional time be
allocated for a careful estimate
of the costs of the war by a
number of congressional com
mittees, such as the Joint Eco
nomic Committee, the Ways
and Means Committee, the Edu
cation and Labor Committee,
the Judiciary Committee and
the Foreign Affairs Committee,

in addition to the Appropria
tions Committee and the Armed
Services Committee, to deter
mine what costs are necessary
(1) to maintain the current level
of military operations, (2) to fi
nance new stages of build-up
and escalation, and (3) to pro
vide the type of military and
civilian security that would be
needed during a period of pro
longed negotiation. In this way,
members of the Congress can
choose the type and degree of
military operation they wish to
support.
2. We ask the Congress to re
examine the international agree
ments to which the United
States is pledged. To an unprec
edented degree, today's world
order and human life itself de
pend upon the exercise of con
straint in the conduct of for
eign affairs. The origin and con
duct of the war in Vietnam
must be examined in this light.
Particular attention must be fo
cused on the destruction of ci
vilian life and property, the use
of gas and other chemicals, and
the treatment of prisoners of
war. Our country must pledge
itself anew to conform policy
and practice in Vietnam to in
ternational law, as embodied in
the several agreements of Ge
neva and the Hague, the Nurem
berg judgments, the charter of
the United Nations, and other
such documents. The abandon
ment of constraint leads our
country and the world down the
path of brutalization and de
struction.
3. Our religious bodies must
assume a particular responsi
bility for prisoners of war in
both the north and south. We

call upon international religious
agencies to take the initiative in
developing effective programs
for speedy repatriation and hu
mane treatment of prisoners,
with special attention to nutri
tional and medical needs. Under
no circumstances can our na
tion condone brutal treatment
of prisoners on the ground that
the other side does so.
4. Wo must immediately sup
port efforts to insure that vic
tims of bombing and terroism,
particularly those who have
been burned by napalm, are
given proper hospitalization
wherever adequate facilities are
available, including the United
States. We welcome the forma
tion of the Committee of Re
sponsibility that is working to
this end, and urge governmen
tal support for its efforts.
We urge all religious organi
zations to follow the example of
the World Council of Churches
in arranging special offerings
for the relief of all victims of
warfare in Vietnam, whether in
the north or south, to be admin
istered through the Internation
al Red Cross or similar agen
cies.
5. At such time as negotia
tions have begun, further crea
tive opportunities should be op
ened up for both the public and
the private sectors of our na
tion. There will be need for the
development of a genuinely rep
resentative government in the
south. Members of our Congress
and our legal profession can of
fer their services, under the
auspices of Asian members of
such bodies as the International
Parliamentary Union, for what
ever counsel the Vietnamese de
sire in the development of a
constitutional assembly.
Those with special skills in
such fields as education, land
reform, housing, nutrition, med
icine and job training can be
prepared to help in Vietnam
during the long and involved
period of negotiations. The re
sources of various Catholic,
Protestant and Jewish relief
agencies can be coordinated for
these and other ventures, and
we urge foundations to support
extended opportunities for ser
vice in these areas.
We are eager that many of

our citizens pledge themselves
to acts of mercy and rebuilding
and reconciliation. These are a
particular American responsi
bility because of the deep mea
sure of American involvement
in acts of injury and destruc
tion. But such acts will have en
during meaning only when our
nation has pledged itself to seek
negotiated peace in more coura
geous terms than have yet been
undertaken. Otherwise we will
appear to be using small ges
tures of creativity to excuse
massive acts of ongoing destruc
tion.
Other projects should be ini
tiated even as negotiations pro
ceed, and we urge that further
suggestions be sent to Clergy
and Laymen Concerned About
Vietnam, 475 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York 10027, for
appropriate implementation.
In all such ventures, however,
there is a danger to which
Americans must be particularly
sensitive. We must not seek to
export the American way of
life, or impose an alien culture
on the Vietnamese. By insisting
that our help be channeled
through international agencies,
we can clarify our desire to
serve only as others choose to
use us, and not as we dictate.
We must convey by word, and
even more by deed, our desire
to let the Vietnamese be the ar
biters of their own destiny, and
insist only on such international
controls as will temporarily be
needed to insure that injustices
are prevented or properly recti
fied.
VI. OUR ONGOING
RESPONSIBILITY
We know that millions of
Americans share the anguish we
express, and endorse the alter
natives we propose. If they have
been silent heretofor, we plead
with them to speak up now, and
we pledge them our support. If
they have spoken earlier and
felt no resonance of public re
sponse, we plead with them to
speak again, so that together we
can create the new groundswell
of public outcry that will force
a reappraisal and a new direc
tion.
We reaffirm our own respon
sibility to urge that new direc
tion. We pledge to lay this burn

ing concern upon the con
sciences of our religious bodies,
through our local congregations,
our denominational agencies,
our councils of churches, and
our involvement in civic groups,
so that increasing pressure can
be brought to bear, through the
pulpit, the public forum, the
mass media, and the ballot box,
upon those in public life who
make our policy decisions.
As we face a difficult and dan
gerous period in the history of
man, we remember that our
task is not to assign blame for
the past, but to accept responsi
bility for the future; not to cast
the stone of condemnation, but
to offer the helping hand of re
conciliation; not to proceed self
righteously and vindictively,
but to walk humbly and repent
ently.
We who are so deeply in
volved in the immensity of the
present war must have the
courage to initiate the steps that
will lead to peace. If we do not
take those steps, we firmly be
lieve that God will judge us
harshly, and will hold us ac
countable for the horror we con
tinue to unleash. But if we do
turn about, if we seek to undo
whatever measure we can of the
wrong that has been done, then
we also firmly believe that as
we walk that long and hard and
often discouraging road, God
himself will be with us, to guide
and chasten and sustain us, and
that he will deign to use even
us in restoring some portion of
the divine creation we have so
grieviously misused.

I. THE NEED TO SPEAK
A time comes when silence is
betrayal. That time has come
for us in relation to Vietnam. As
members of American churches
and synagogues, we voice not
only our own convictions, but
seek also to articulate the un
expressed fears and longings of
millions of Americans.
The Old Testament forbids us
to prophecy "smooth things,"
and in the face of any evil, the
mandate of Albert Camus is laid
upon all men, whether religious
or not, that they "should speak
out, loud and clear, and that
they should voice their con

demnation in such a way that
never a doubt, never the sightest
doubt, could rise in the heart of
the simplest man. That they
should get away from abstrac
tion and confront the blood
stained face history has taken
on today."
Our share of responsibility
for that blood-stained face
haunts us today and prompts
our outcry. We confess that we
should have spoken sooner and
with clearer voice, but we do
speak now, hoping it is not too
late, adding our voice to the
voice of Pope Paul, the World
Council of Churches, the Syna
gogue Council of America, the
National Council of Churches,
the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops, and other reli
gious bodies, in urging a reap
praisal of our policy in Viet
nam.
Our allegiance to our nation
is held under a higher allegi
ance to the God who is sover
eign over all the nations. When
there is a conflict between those
allegiances, the priorities are
clear: "You shall have no other
gods before me." "We must
obey God rather than men."
Each day we find allegiance to
our nation's policy more diffi
cult to reconcile with allegiance
to our God.
Both the exercise of faith and
the expression of the democrat
ic privilege oblige us to make
our voices heard. For while we
speak as members of religious
communities, we also speak as
American citizens. Responsible
expression of disagreement and
dissent is the lifeblood of de
mocracy, and we speak out of a
loyalty that refuses to condone
in silence a national policy that
is leading our world toward dis
aster.
We speak in full awareness
that no easy answers are avail
able. But we believe that issues
must be pressed and questions
forced, if new answers are to be
forthcoming. For the old an
swers no longer satisfy us.

11. THE ONGOING ANGUISH
No one planned the type of
war in which we are involved.
It has slowly escalated from one
small move to the next small
move, each presumed to be the
last that would be necessary, so
that now we find our nation
able to offer only military an
swers to political and human
questions. We sympathize with
the dilemmas that face our
President and Congressmen in
dealing with a situation all de

entitle us to repeat and com

We are unable to support our

This, then, is our ongoing

NEGOTIATION
The possibility of negotiatio
will depend in large part *
how such questions are ar
swered. Many in our nation a
ready feel that all efforts towar
a negotiated peace have bee
made by us, and that any fui
ther initiatives must come fror
the other side. But certain pr<
conditions that seem indisp
sible to negotiations are not y€
present in our policy, and wi*l
out them other nations ca
hardly be expected to take ser
ously our intent:
1. The first precondition is in
plied in our questions and- 'r
volves an assurance from ou
government that we are gei
uinely ready to negotiate, t > •
that we are not merely trying t
win diplomatically what w
have not won militarily. Ther
will be no reason for respons
from the other side unless *v
indicate a willingness to see,
peace without prior assuranc
that all details of the peace v J
follow our desires.
2. There must be some actio)
by our government to lend cred
bllity to our willingness to negc
tiate. It is increasingly ck.
that one indispensible prerequ
site is our willingness uncond
tionally to cease the bombing o
North Vietnam.
We are at an impasse v W<
have said we will not cease'. lh.
bombing until there is a slgi
from the other side of Willi £
ness to negotiate, and yet whei
such signs have come we hav
ignored them. They have s«it
they will give no further sign o
willingness to negotiate unti
we cease the bombing, and ye
when we have briefly ceased th«
bombing, no sign has come.
There is no way beyond thi
impasse until someone taker i
fresh initiative. We, as tn<
stronger nation, have both th<
obligation and the opportunlt:
to take that initiative.
The initiative must be uncor
ditional. Having ceased, we m» s
be prepared to wait until th<
other side responds. We have n»
reason to expect that a respond
will come soon, for it will tak«
time to gain credibility for ou
intent. In the interval, wtiilt
diplomatic channels are ex
plored, we will call upon
gious leaders in other countfie
to intercede and urge that
tive response be made.
3. If we truly do not intent
to dictate the terms of peace ii
advance, then we cannot eXcltidi
from the conference table anj
who are involved in the preStii
struggle. Our nation must ac
cept the National Liberate
Front as a partner in the peac<
talks in its own right. The pre
vious assurances of our leader;
have failed to state this clearly
4. Other conditions are aes'r
able, such as a de-escalation u
the ground war to a degree com
mensurate with the
necessary for those alreadj
there. But since the destiny o
all nations is involved in a nego
tiated peace, we must not seel
it unilaterally, but must ask
full cooperation of all agencie:
designed to deal with interna
tional tensions. These must *n
elude an increasing role for th<


DR MoAFEE BROWN
United Nations, and a recogni
tion of the potential role of the
International Control Commis
sion in reducing ground hostili
ty by providing an international
presence under cover of which
foreign troops might ultimately
be withdrawn from Vietnam.
Although we address these ap
peals particularly to our own
nation, we are fully aware that
negotiations involve more than
one participant, and we lay the
seriousness of our concern upon
all men everywhere to offer
further help in transforming
possibilities into realities.
V. RECOMMENDATIONS FOE
FURTHER ACTION
There are further steps that
Americans can take to indicate
our desire to play a creative
rather than destructive role in
the future of Vietnam.
1. Our Congressmen will short
ly begin debate on an appropri
ations bill. Their response to
that bill will say much about
our true intentions in Vietnam.
We urge that additional time be
allocated for a careful estimate
of the costs of the war by a
number of congressional com
mittees, such as the Joint Eco
nomic Committee, the Ways
and Means Committee, the Edu
cation and Labor Committee,
the Judiciary Committee and
the Foreign Affairs Committee,

in addition to the Appropria
tions Committee and the Armed
Services Committee, to deter
mine what costs are necessary
(1) to maintain the current level
of military operations, (2) to fi
nance new stages of build-up
and escalation, and (3) to pro
vide the type of military and
civilian security that would be
needed during a period of pro
longed negotiation. In this way,
members of the Congress can
choose the type and degree of
military operation they wish to
support.
2. We ask the Congress to re
examine the international agree
ments to which the United
States is pledged. To an unprec
edented degree, today's world
order and human life itself de
pend upon the exercise of con
straint in the conduct of for
eign affairs. The origin and con
duct of the war in Vietnam
must be examined in this light.
Particular attention must be fo
cused on the destruction of ci
vilian life and property, the use
of gas and other chemicals, and
the treatment of prisoners of
war. Our country must pledge
itself anew to conform policy
and practice in Vietnam to in
ternational law, as embodied in
the several agreements of Ge
neva and the Hague, the Nurem
berg judgments, the charter of
the United Nations, and other
such documents. The abandon
ment of constraint leads our
country and the world down the
path of brutalization and de
struction.
3. Our religious bodies must
assume a particular responsi
bility for prisoners of war in
both the north and south. We

call upon international religious
agencies to take the initiative in
developing effective programs
for speedy repatriation and hu
mane treatment of prisoners,
with special attention to nutri
tional and medical needs. Under
no circumstances can our na
tion condone brutal treatment
of prisoners on the ground that
the other side does so.
4. Wo must immediately sup
port efforts to insure that vic
tims of bombing and terroism,
particularly those who have
been burned by napalm, are
given proper hospitalization
wherever adequate facilities are
available, including the United
States. We welcome the forma
tion of the Committee of Re
sponsibility that is working to
this end, and urge governmen
tal support for its efforts.
We urge all religious organi
zations to follow the example of
the World Council of Churches
in arranging special offerings
for the relief of all victims of
warfare in Vietnam, whether in
the north or south, to be admin
istered through the Internation
al Red Cross or similar agen
cies.
5. At such time as negotia
tions have begun, further crea
tive opportunities should be op
ened up for both the public and
the private sectors of our na
tion. There will be need for the
development of a genuinely rep
resentative government in the
south. Members of our Congress
and our legal profession can of
fer their services, under the
auspices of Asian members of
such bodies as the International
Parliamentary Union, for what
ever counsel the Vietnamese de
sire in the development of a
constitutional assembly.
Those with special skills in
such fields as education, land
reform, housing, nutrition, med
icine and job training can be
prepared to help in Vietnam
during the long and involved
period of negotiations. The re
sources of various Catholic,
Protestant and Jewish relief
agencies can be coordinated for
these and other ventures, and
we urge foundations to support
extended opportunities for ser
vice in these areas.
We are eager that many of

our citizens pledge themselves
to acts of mercy and rebuilding
and reconciliation. These are a
particular American responsi
bility because of the deep mea
sure of American involvement
in acts of injury and destruc
tion. But such acts will have en
during meaning only when our
nation has pledged itself to seek
negotiated peace in more coura
geous terms than have yet been
undertaken. Otherwise we will
appear to be using small ges
tures of creativity to excuse
massive acts of ongoing destruc
tion.
Other projects should be ini
tiated even as negotiations pro
ceed, and we urge that further
suggestions be sent to Clergy
and Laymen Concerned About
Vietnam, 475 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York 10027, for
appropriate implementation.
In all such ventures, however,
there is a danger to which
Americans must be particularly
sensitive. We must not seek to
export the American way of
life, or impose an alien culture
on the Vietnamese. By insisting
that our help be channeled
through international agencies,
we can clarify our desire to
serve only as others choose to
use us, and not as we dictate.
We must convey by word, and
even more by deed, our desire
to let the Vietnamese be the ar
biters of their own destiny, and
insist only on such international
controls as will temporarily be
needed to insure that injustices
are prevented or properly recti
fied.
VI. OUR ONGOING
RESPONSIBILITY
We know that millions of
Americans share the anguish we
express, and endorse the alter
natives we propose. If they have
been silent heretofor, we plead
with them to speak up now, and
we pledge them our support. If
they have spoken earlier and
felt no resonance of public re
sponse, we plead with them to
speak again, so that together we
can create the new groundswell
of public outcry that will force
a reappraisal and a new direc
tion.
We reaffirm our own respon
sibility to urge that new direc
tion. We pledge to lay this burn

ing concern upon the con
sciences of our religious bodies,
through our local congregations,
our denominational agencies,
our councils of churches, and
our involvement in civic groups,
so that increasing pressure can
be brought to bear, through the
pulpit, the public forum, the
mass media, and the ballot box,
upon those in public life who
make our policy decisions.
As we face a difficult and dan
gerous period in the history of
man, we remember that our
task is not to assign blame for
the past, but to accept responsi
bility for the future; not to cast
the stone of condemnation, but
to offer the helping hand of re
conciliation; not to proceed self
righteously and vindictively,
but to walk humbly and repent
ently.
We who are so deeply in
volved in the immensity of the
present war must have the
courage to initiate the steps that
will lead to peace. If we do not
take those steps, we firmly be
lieve that God will judge us
harshly, and will hold us ac
countable for the horror we con
tinue to unleash. But if we do
turn about, if we seek to undo
whatever measure we can of the
wrong that has been done, then
we also firmly believe that as
we walk that long and hard and
often discouraging road, God
himself will be with us, to guide
and chasten and sustain us, and
that he will deign to use even
us in restoring some portion of
the divine creation we have so
grieviously misused.

I. THE NEED TO SPEAK
A time comes when silence is
betrayal. That time has come
for us in relation to Vietnam. As
members of American churches
and synagogues, we voice not
only our own convictions, but
seek also to articulate the un
expressed fears and longings of
millions of Americans.
The Old Testament forbids us
to prophecy "smooth things,"
and in the face of any evil, the
mandate of Albert Camus is laid
upon all men, whether religious
or not, that they "should speak
out, loud and clear, and that
they should voice their con

demnation in such a way that
never a doubt, never the sightest
doubt, could rise in the heart of
the simplest man. That they
should get away from abstrac
tion and confront the blood
stained face history has taken
on today."
Our share of responsibility
for that blood-stained face
haunts us today and prompts
our outcry. We confess that we
should have spoken sooner and
with clearer voice, but we do
speak now, hoping it is not too
late, adding our voice to the
voice of Pope Paul, the World
Council of Churches, the Syna
gogue Council of America, the
National Council of Churches,
the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops, and other reli
gious bodies, in urging a reap
praisal of our policy in Viet
nam.
Our allegiance to our nation
is held under a higher allegi
ance to the God who is sover
eign over all the nations. When
there is a conflict between those
allegiances, the priorities are
clear: "You shall have no other
gods before me." "We must
obey God rather than men."
Each day we find allegiance to
our nation's policy more diffi
cult to reconcile with allegiance
to our God.
Both the exercise of faith and
the expression of the democrat
ic privilege oblige us to make
our voices heard. For while we
speak as members of religious
communities, we also speak as
American citizens. Responsible
expression of disagreement and
dissent is the lifeblood of de
mocracy, and we speak out of a
loyalty that refuses to condone
in silence a national policy that
is leading our world toward dis
aster.
We speak in full awareness
that no easy answers are avail
able. But we believe that issues
must be pressed and questions
forced, if new answers are to be
forthcoming. For the old an
swers no longer satisfy us.

11. THE ONGOING ANGUISH
No one planned the type of
war in which we are involved.
It has slowly escalated from one
small move to the next small
move, each presumed to be the
last that would be necessary, so
that now we find our nation
able to offer only military an
swers to political and human
questions. We sympathize with
the dilemmas that face our
President and Congressmen in
dealing with a situation all de
cent men abhor. But a recogni
tion of past mistakes does not
entitle us to repeat and com
pound those mistakes by con
tinuing them on an ever-widen
ing scale.
We are unable to support our
nation's policy of military esca
lation, and we find those to
whom we minister caught as we
are in confusion and anguish be
cause of it.
1. This anguish is based first
of all on the immorality of the
warfare in Vietnam. We add our
voice to those who protest a
war in which civilian casualties
are greater than military; in
which whole populations are de
ported against their will; in
which the widespread use of
napalm and other explosives is
killing and maiming women,
children, and the aged; in which
the combatants are systemat
ically destroying the crops and
production capacity of a coun
try they profess to liberate; in
which the torturing of prisoners
by both sides has been common
place.
All who believe that man is
made in God's image must be
horrified by such crimes com
mitted against God and man.
There is guilt on all sides in
such a war as this, but the guilt
is ours far more than we have
courage to admit. We can only
tremble at the thought that God
is just.
2. Even those of us who rec
ognize that sometimes evil must
be done lest greater evil prevail,
feel a sense of anguish in the
inconsistency between our sta
ted aims and the consequences
they produce.
Our ongoing escalation, far
from bringing the war closer to
an end, serves rather to increase
its duration and intensity.
Our bombing of the north, far
from bringing our enemies to
their knees, serves rather to
strengthen their will to resist
us.
Our military presence in Viet
nam, far from stemming the
tide of communism, serves
rather to unite more firmly
those communist societies which
might otherwise develop sepa
rate destinies.
Our widening military involve

ment, far from demonstrating
to the world our firmness and
resolve, serves rather to make
the world suspicious of us and
fearful of our use of power.
Our unilateral action in Viet
nam, far from strengthening
our influence among other na
tions, serves rather to jeopar
dize new alliances we might be
creating.
At home, we find the war
threatening the very goals we
claim to be defending in Viet
nam. Programs to help mem
bers of minority groups realize
their own human dignity are
jeopardized if not destroyed. A
spurious type of patriotism is
challenging the right of dissent
and the open debate of public
issues. Financial and psychologi
cal preoccupation with the war
is destroying creative plans to
alleviate poverty, overcome dis
ease, extend education, replace
city slums and exalt human dig
nity. We grieve over lost oppor
tunities that may never be re
claimed.
Many of us are called upon to
counsel young men of draft age
who in conscience question our
presence in Vietnam. The moral
dilemma they face is part and
parcel of our own. Their an
guish is frequently motivated
by a high patriotism that forces
them to challenge, often at great
personal cost, policies they be
lieve will stain their nation's
honor. How can we counsel
them to participate in such a
war as this? When they decide
that they cannot condone the
war by their personal involve
ment, we must support them in
that decision.
3. Our anguish is deepened by
the discrepancy between what
we are told by our government
and what we discover is actual
ly taking- place.
We are told that the other
side gives no indication of de
sire to negotiate, and we then
discover that such indications
have been given, but that we
have responded either with re
buff or military escalation.
We are told that our nation is
prepared to negotiate with all
concerned, and we then discover
that certain of the combatants
will not be welcome at the con
ference table.
We are told that certain cities
have not been bombed, and we
then discover that they have
been.
We are told that civilian tar
gets have been avoided, ard we
then discover that they have not
been.
Such actions not only play
into the hands of those who dis
trust us, since they can consist
ently discount our word, but the
continuous discovery of discrep

ancles between our nation's
word and deed has already
shaken the confidence of our
own people in the word of their
government. We fear both the
immediate and long-range con
sequences for our nation of this
increasing deterioration of trust.
This, then, is our ongoing
anguish: a crisis of conscience
concerning what we do know,
and a crisis of confusion con
cerning what we do not know.
ni. THE NEED FOR
CLARIFICATION
The public debate is forcing
us to choose between wrong al
ternatives in Vietnam. Conse
quently, agreeing with the
American Roman Catholic
Bishops that it is "our duty to
magnify the moral voice of our
nation," we ask for clarification
of the real alternatives.
The choices usually presented
to the American people are
three (1) we could escalate rap
idly and "win the war" in the
forseeable future; or (2) we
could withdraw our troops and
accept defeat; but (3) since to
most Americans these alterna
tives are unsatisfactory, we
must continue our present
course, i.e., gradually escalate
the war until the other side
capitulates to our increasing
pressure.
We believe the realistic alter
natives are closer to the follow
ing: (1) we can continue to fight
a hard, bloody, increasingly bit
ter and frustrating war for
many years, a war we can con
ceivably "win," but at the price
of destroying the land and peo
ple we presume to liberate, of
sacrificing more and more of
our own young men to death,
of widening the probability that
other nations will enter the con
flict, of engendering increasing
ho s ti 1 i t y against ourselves
throughout the rest of the world,
and of emerging at the end with
no "victory" worth what it has
cost.
On the other hand, (2) we can
commit ourselves unequivocal
ly to seek now rather than later
for a negotiated peace, realizing
that history does not present us
with easy choices and that the
road to such a peace would be
long and torturous. Just as
there has been frustration and
heartache in our gradual escala
tion, so too there would be frus
tratation and heartache In the
development of new initiatives
leading to a negotiated peace.
Just as the risks of extending
the war are great, so too the
risks of seeking new initiatives
for negotiated peace are great.
But confronted by such a
choice, we believe the American
people will choose the path of

initiatives for negotiation, an
that the risks involved in sue
a choice are well worth takinc
And so we put these question
to our government:
1. Will you help our natlo
confront the choice between th
expansion of a war no one ca
"win" without destruction s
terrible as to negate its state
aim, and the immediate purs J
of a negotiated peace no one ca
"win" in the conventions
sense?
2. Will you make clear to a
that we are not trying to wi
through negotiation what w
have been unable to v
through military might, an
that we seek a peace
victory—a peace that can com
only on terms agreeable to a
at the conference table?
3. Will you make more cred
ble use than has yet been mad
of International agencies tI.J
could help us find ways to in
tiate negotiation?

tunities that may never be re
claimed.
Many of us are called upon to
counsel young men of draft age
who in conscience question our
presence in Vietnam. The moral
dilemma they face is part and
parcel of our own. Their an
guish is frequently motivated
by a high patriotism that forces
them to challenge, often at great
personal cost, policies they be
lieve will stain their nation's
honor. How can we counsel
them to participate in such a
war as this? When they decide
that they cannot condone the
war by their personal involve
ment, we must support them in
that decision.
3. Our anguish is deepened by
the discrepancy between what
we are told by our government
and what we discover is actual
ly taking- place.
We are told that the other
side gives no indication of de
sire to negotiate, and we then
discover that such indications
have been given, but that we
have responded either with re
buff or military escalation.
We are told that our nation is
prepared to negotiate with all
concerned, and we then discover
that certain of the combatants
will not be welcome at the con
ference table.
We are told that certain cities
have not been bombed, and we
then discover that they have
been.
We are told that civilian tar
gets have been avoided, ard we
then discover that they have not
been.
Such actions not only play
into the hands of those who dis
trust us, since they can consist
ently discount our word, but the
continuous discovery of discrep

ancles between our nation's
word and deed has already
shaken the confidence of our
own people in the word of their
government. We fear both the
immediate and long-range con
sequences for our nation of this
increasing deterioration of trust.
This, then, is our ongoing
anguish: a crisis of conscience
concerning what we do know,
and a crisis of confusion con
cerning what we do not know.
ni. THE NEED FOR
CLARIFICATION
The public debate is forcing
us to choose between wrong al
ternatives in Vietnam. Conse
quently, agreeing with the
American Roman Catholic
Bishops that it is "our duty to
magnify the moral voice of our
nation," we ask for clarification
of the real alternatives.
The choices usually presented
to the American people are
three (1) we could escalate rap
idly and "win the war" in the
forseeable future; or (2) we
could withdraw our troops and
accept defeat; but (3) since to
most Americans these alterna
tives are unsatisfactory, we
must continue our present
course, i.e., gradually escalate
the war until the other side
capitulates to our increasing
pressure.
We believe the realistic alter
natives are closer to the follow
ing: (1) we can continue to fight
a hard, bloody, increasingly bit
ter and frustrating war for
many years, a war we can con
ceivably "win," but at the price
of destroying the land and peo
ple we presume to liberate, of
sacrificing more and more of
our own young men to death,
of widening the probability that
other nations will enter the con
flict, of engendering increasing
ho s ti 1 i t y against ourselves
throughout the rest of the world,
and of emerging at the end with
no "victory" worth what it has
cost.
On the other hand, (2) we can
commit ourselves unequivocal
ly to seek now rather than later
for a negotiated peace, realizing
that history does not present us
with easy choices and that the
road to such a peace would be
long and torturous. Just as
there has been frustration and
heartache in our gradual escala
tion, so too there would be frus
tratation and heartache In the
development of new initiatives
leading to a negotiated peace.
Just as the risks of extending
the war are great, so too the
risks of seeking new initiatives
for negotiated peace are great.
But confronted by such a
choice, we believe the American
people will choose the path of

initiatives for negotiation, an
that the risks involved in sue
a choice are well worth takinc
And so we put these question
to our government:
1. Will you help our natlo
confront the choice between th
expansion of a war no one ca
"win" without destruction s
terrible as to negate its state
aim, and the immediate purs J
of a negotiated peace no one ca
"win" in the conventions
sense?
2. Will you make clear to a
that we are not trying to wi
through negotiation what w
have been unable to v
through military might, an
that we seek a peace
victory—a peace that can com
only on terms agreeable to a
at the conference table?
3. Will you make more cred
ble use than has yet been mad
of International agencies tI.J
could help us find ways to in
tiate negotiation?
IV. THE PRECONDITIONS O]
NEGOTIATION
The possibility of negotiatio
will depend in large part *
how such questions are ar
swered. Many in our nation a
ready feel that all efforts towar
a negotiated peace have bee
made by us, and that any fui
ther initiatives must come fror
the other side. But certain pr<
conditions that seem indisp
sible to negotiations are not y€
present in our policy, and wi*l
out them other nations ca
hardly be expected to take ser
ously our intent:
1. The first precondition is in
plied in our questions and- 'r
volves an assurance from ou
government that we are gei
uinely ready to negotiate, t > •
that we are not merely trying t
win diplomatically what w
have not won militarily. Ther
will be no reason for respons
from the other side unless *v
indicate a willingness to see,
peace without prior assuranc
that all details of the peace v J
follow our desires.
2. There must be some actio)
by our government to lend cred
bllity to our willingness to negc
tiate. It is increasingly ck.
that one indispensible prerequ
site is our willingness uncond
tionally to cease the bombing o
North Vietnam.
We are at an impasse v W<
have said we will not cease'. lh.
bombing until there is a slgi
from the other side of Willi £
ness to negotiate, and yet whei
such signs have come we hav
ignored them. They have s«it
they will give no further sign o
willingness to negotiate unti
we cease the bombing, and ye
when we have briefly ceased th«
bombing, no sign has come.
There is no way beyond thi
impasse until someone taker i
fresh initiative. We, as tn<
stronger nation, have both th<
obligation and the opportunlt:
to take that initiative.
The initiative must be uncor
ditional. Having ceased, we m» s
be prepared to wait until th<
other side responds. We have n»
reason to expect that a respond
will come soon, for it will tak«
time to gain credibility for ou
intent. In the interval, wtiilt
diplomatic channels are ex
plored, we will call upon
gious leaders in other countfie
to intercede and urge that
tive response be made.
3. If we truly do not intent
to dictate the terms of peace ii
advance, then we cannot eXcltidi
from the conference table anj
who are involved in the preStii
struggle. Our nation must ac
cept the National Liberate
Front as a partner in the peac<
talks in its own right. The pre
vious assurances of our leader;
have failed to state this clearly
4. Other conditions are aes'r
able, such as a de-escalation u
the ground war to a degree com
mensurate with the
necessary for those alreadj
there. But since the destiny o
all nations is involved in a nego
tiated peace, we must not seel
it unilaterally, but must ask
full cooperation of all agencie:
designed to deal with interna
tional tensions. These must *n
elude an increasing role for th<


DR MoAFEE BROWN
United Nations, and a recogni
tion of the potential role of the
International Control Commis
sion in reducing ground hostili
ty by providing an international
presence under cover of which
foreign troops might ultimately
be withdrawn from Vietnam.
Although we address these ap
peals particularly to our own
nation, we are fully aware that
negotiations involve more than
one participant, and we lay the
seriousness of our concern upon
all men everywhere to offer
further help in transforming
possibilities into realities.
V. RECOMMENDATIONS FOE
FURTHER ACTION
There are further steps that
Americans can take to indicate
our desire to play a creative
rather than destructive role in
the future of Vietnam.
1. Our Congressmen will short
ly begin debate on an appropri
ations bill. Their response to
that bill will say much about
our true intentions in Vietnam.
We urge that additional time be
allocated for a careful estimate
of the costs of the war by a
number of congressional com
mittees, such as the Joint Eco
nomic Committee, the Ways
and Means Committee, the Edu
cation and Labor Committee,
the Judiciary Committee and
the Foreign Affairs Committee,

in addition to the Appropria
tions Committee and the Armed
Services Committee, to deter
mine what costs are necessary
(1) to maintain the current level
of military operations, (2) to fi
nance new stages of build-up
and escalation, and (3) to pro
vide the type of military and
civilian security that would be
needed during a period of pro
longed negotiation. In this way,
members of the Congress can
choose the type and degree of
military operation they wish to
support.
2. We ask the Congress to re
examine the international agree
ments to which the United
States is pledged. To an unprec
edented degree, today's world
order and human life itself de
pend upon the exercise of con
straint in the conduct of for
eign affairs. The origin and con
duct of the war in Vietnam
must be examined in this light.
Particular attention must be fo
cused on the destruction of ci
vilian life and property, the use
of gas and other chemicals, and
the treatment of prisoners of
war. Our country must pledge
itself anew to conform policy
and practice in Vietnam to in
ternational law, as embodied in
the several agreements of Ge
neva and the Hague, the Nurem
berg judgments, the charter of
the United Nations, and other
such documents. The abandon
ment of constraint leads our
country and the world down the
path of brutalization and de
struction.
3. Our religious bodies must
assume a particular responsi
bility for prisoners of war in
both the north and south. We

call upon international religious
agencies to take the initiative in
developing effective programs
for speedy repatriation and hu
mane treatment of prisoners,
with special attention to nutri
tional and medical needs. Under
no circumstances can our na
tion condone brutal treatment
of prisoners on the ground that
the other side does so.
4. Wo must immediately sup
port efforts to insure that vic
tims of bombing and terroism,
particularly those who have
been burned by napalm, are
given proper hospitalization
wherever adequate facilities are
available, including the United
States. We welcome the forma
tion of the Committee of Re
sponsibility that is working to
this end, and urge governmen
tal support for its efforts.
We urge all religious organi
zations to follow the example of
the World Council of Churches
in arranging special offerings
for the relief of all victims of
warfare in Vietnam, whether in
the north or south, to be admin
istered through the Internation
al Red Cross or similar agen
cies.
5. At such time as negotia
tions have begun, further crea
tive opportunities should be op
ened up for both the public and
the private sectors of our na
tion. There will be need for the
development of a genuinely rep
resentative government in the
south. Members of our Congress
and our legal profession can of
fer their services, under the
auspices of Asian members of
such bodies as the International
Parliamentary Union, for what
ever counsel the Vietnamese de
sire in the development of a
constitutional assembly.
Those with special skills in
such fields as education, land
reform, housing, nutrition, med
icine and job training can be
prepared to help in Vietnam
during the long and involved
period of negotiations. The re
sources of various Catholic,
Protestant and Jewish relief
agencies can be coordinated for
these and other ventures, and
we urge foundations to support
extended opportunities for ser
vice in these areas.
We are eager that many of

our citizens pledge themselves
to acts of mercy and rebuilding
and reconciliation. These are a
particular American responsi
bility because of the deep mea
sure of American involvement
in acts of injury and destruc
tion. But such acts will have en
during meaning only when our
nation has pledged itself to seek
negotiated peace in more coura
geous terms than have yet been
undertaken. Otherwise we will
appear to be using small ges
tures of creativity to excuse
massive acts of ongoing destruc
tion.
Other projects should be ini
tiated even as negotiations pro
ceed, and we urge that further
suggestions be sent to Clergy
and Laymen Concerned About
Vietnam, 475 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York 10027, for
appropriate implementation.
In all such ventures, however,
there is a danger to which
Americans must be particularly
sensitive. We must not seek to
export the American way of
life, or impose an alien culture
on the Vietnamese. By insisting
that our help be channeled
through international agencies,
we can clarify our desire to
serve only as others choose to
use us, and not as we dictate.
We must convey by word, and
even more by deed, our desire
to let the Vietnamese be the ar
biters of their own destiny, and
insist only on such international
controls as will temporarily be
needed to insure that injustices
are prevented or properly recti
fied.
VI. OUR ONGOING
RESPONSIBILITY
We know that millions of
Americans share the anguish we
express, and endorse the alter
natives we propose. If they have
been silent heretofor, we plead
with them to speak up now, and
we pledge them our support. If
they have spoken earlier and
felt no resonance of public re
sponse, we plead with them to
speak again, so that together we
can create the new groundswell
of public outcry that will force
a reappraisal and a new direc
tion.
We reaffirm our own respon
sibility to urge that new direc
tion. We pledge to lay this burn

ing concern upon the con
sciences of our religious bodies,
through our local congregations,
our denominational agencies,
our councils of churches, and
our involvement in civic groups,
so that increasing pressure can
be brought to bear, through the
pulpit, the public forum, the
mass media, and the ballot box,
upon those in public life who
make our policy decisions.
As we face a difficult and dan
gerous period in the history of
man, we remember that our
task is not to assign blame for
the past, but to accept responsi
bility for the future; not to cast
the stone of condemnation, but
to offer the helping hand of re
conciliation; not to proceed self
righteously and vindictively,
but to walk humbly and repent
ently.
We who are so deeply in
volved in the immensity of the
present war must have the
courage to initiate the steps that
will lead to peace. If we do not
take those steps, we firmly be
lieve that God will judge us
harshly, and will hold us ac
countable for the horror we con
tinue to unleash. But if we do
turn about, if we seek to undo
whatever measure we can of the
wrong that has been done, then
we also firmly believe that as
we walk that long and hard and
often discouraging road, God
himself will be with us, to guide
and chasten and sustain us, and
that he will deign to use even
us in restoring some portion of
the divine creation we have so
grieviously misused.

Clery and Laymen Concerned
About Vietnam.)

I. THE NEED TO SPEAK
A time comes when silence is
betrayal. That time has come
for us in relation to Vietnam. As
members of American churches
and synagogues, we voice not
only our own convictions, but
seek also to articulate the un
expressed fears and longings of
millions of Americans.
The Old Testament forbids us
to prophecy "smooth things,"
and in the face of any evil, the
mandate of Albert Camus is laid
upon all men, whether religious
or not, that they "should speak
out, loud and clear, and that
they should voice their con

demnation in such a way that
never a doubt, never the sightest
doubt, could rise in the heart of
the simplest man. That they
should get away from abstrac
tion and confront the blood
stained face history has taken
on today."
Our share of responsibility
for that blood-stained face
haunts us today and prompts
our outcry. We confess that we
should have spoken sooner and
with clearer voice, but we do
speak now, hoping it is not too
late, adding our voice to the
voice of Pope Paul, the World
Council of Churches, the Syna
gogue Council of America, the
National Council of Churches,
the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops, and other reli
gious bodies, in urging a reap
praisal of our policy in Viet
nam.
Our allegiance to our nation
is held under a higher allegi
ance to the God who is sover
eign over all the nations. When
there is a conflict between those
allegiances, the priorities are
clear: "You shall have no other
gods before me." "We must
obey God rather than men."
Each day we find allegiance to
our nation's policy more diffi
cult to reconcile with allegiance
to our God.
Both the exercise of faith and
the expression of the democrat
ic privilege oblige us to make
our voices heard. For while we
speak as members of religious
communities, we also speak as
American citizens. Responsible
expression of disagreement and
dissent is the lifeblood of de
mocracy, and we speak out of a
loyalty that refuses to condone
in silence a national policy that
is leading our world toward dis
aster.
We speak in full awareness
that no easy answers are avail
able. But we believe that issues
must be pressed and questions
forced, if new answers are to be
forthcoming. For the old an
swers no longer satisfy us.

11. THE ONGOING ANGUISH
No one planned the type of
war in which we are involved.
It has slowly escalated from one
small move to the next small
move, each presumed to be the
last that would be necessary, so
that now we find our nation
able to offer only military an
swers to political and human
questions. We sympathize with
the dilemmas that face our
President and Congressmen in
dealing with a situation all de
cent men abhor. But a recogni
tion of past mistakes does not
entitle us to repeat and com
pound those mistakes by con
tinuing them on an ever-widen
ing scale.
We are unable to support our
nation's policy of military esca
lation, and we find those to
whom we minister caught as we
are in confusion and anguish be
cause of it.
1. This anguish is based first
of all on the immorality of the
warfare in Vietnam. We add our
voice to those who protest a
war in which civilian casualties
are greater than military; in
which whole populations are de
ported against their will; in
which the widespread use of
napalm and other explosives is
killing and maiming women,
children, and the aged; in which
the combatants are systemat
ically destroying the crops and
production capacity of a coun
try they profess to liberate; in
which the torturing of prisoners
by both sides has been common
place.
All who believe that man is
made in God's image must be
horrified by such crimes com
mitted against God and man.
There is guilt on all sides in
such a war as this, but the guilt
is ours far more than we have
courage to admit. We can only
tremble at the thought that God
is just.
2. Even those of us who rec
ognize that sometimes evil must
be done lest greater evil prevail,
feel a sense of anguish in the
inconsistency between our sta
ted aims and the consequences
they produce.
Our ongoing escalation, far
from bringing the war closer to
an end, serves rather to increase
its duration and intensity.
Our bombing of the north, far
from bringing our enemies to
their knees, serves rather to
strengthen their will to resist
us.
Our military presence in Viet
nam, far from stemming the
tide of communism, serves
rather to unite more firmly
those communist societies which
might otherwise develop sepa
rate destinies.
Our widening military involve

ment, far from demonstrating
to the world our firmness and
resolve, serves rather to make
the world suspicious of us and
fearful of our use of power.
Our unilateral action in Viet
nam, far from strengthening
our influence among other na
tions, serves rather to jeopar
dize new alliances we might be
creating.
At home, we find the war
threatening the very goals we
claim to be defending in Viet
nam. Programs to help mem
bers of minority groups realize
their own human dignity are
jeopardized if not destroyed. A
spurious type of patriotism is
challenging the right of dissent
and the open debate of public
issues. Financial and psychologi
cal preoccupation with the war
is destroying creative plans to
alleviate poverty, overcome dis
ease, extend education, replace
city slums and exalt human dig
nity. We grieve over lost oppor
tunities that may never be re
claimed.
Many of us are called upon to
counsel young men of draft age
who in conscience question our
presence in Vietnam. The moral
dilemma they face is part and
parcel of our own. Their an
guish is frequently motivated
by a high patriotism that forces
them to challenge, often at great
personal cost, policies they be
lieve will stain their nation's
honor. How can we counsel
them to participate in such a
war as this? When they decide
that they cannot condone the
war by their personal involve
ment, we must support them in
that decision.
3. Our anguish is deepened by
the discrepancy between what
we are told by our government
and what we discover is actual
ly taking- place.
We are told that the other
side gives no indication of de
sire to negotiate, and we then
discover that such indications
have been given, but that we
have responded either with re
buff or military escalation.
We are told that our nation is
prepared to negotiate with all
concerned, and we then discover
that certain of the combatants
will not be welcome at the con
ference table.
We are told that certain cities
have not been bombed, and we
then discover that they have
been.
We are told that civilian tar
gets have been avoided, ard we
then discover that they have not
been.
Such actions not only play
into the hands of those who dis
trust us, since they can consist
ently discount our word, but the
continuous discovery of discrep

ancles between our nation's
word and deed has already
shaken the confidence of our
own people in the word of their
government. We fear both the
immediate and long-range con
sequences for our nation of this
increasing deterioration of trust.
This, then, is our ongoing
anguish: a crisis of conscience
concerning what we do know,
and a crisis of confusion con
cerning what we do not know.
ni. THE NEED FOR
CLARIFICATION
The public debate is forcing
us to choose between wrong al
ternatives in Vietnam. Conse
quently, agreeing with the
American Roman Catholic
Bishops that it is "our duty to
magnify the moral voice of our
nation," we ask for clarification
of the real alternatives.
The choices usually presented
to the American people are
three (1) we could escalate rap
idly and "win the war" in the
forseeable future; or (2) we
could withdraw our troops and
accept defeat; but (3) since to
most Americans these alterna
tives are unsatisfactory, we
must continue our present
course, i.e., gradually escalate
the war until the other side
capitulates to our increasing
pressure.
We believe the realistic alter
natives are closer to the follow
ing: (1) we can continue to fight
a hard, bloody, increasingly bit
ter and frustrating war for
many years, a war we can con
ceivably "win," but at the price
of destroying the land and peo
ple we presume to liberate, of
sacrificing more and more of
our own young men to death,
of widening the probability that
other nations will enter the con
flict, of engendering increasing
ho s ti 1 i t y against ourselves
throughout the rest of the world,
and of emerging at the end with
no "victory" worth what it has
cost.
On the other hand, (2) we can
commit ourselves unequivocal
ly to seek now rather than later
for a negotiated peace, realizing
that history does not present us
with easy choices and that the
road to such a peace would be
long and torturous. Just as
there has been frustration and
heartache in our gradual escala
tion, so too there would be frus
tratation and heartache In the
development of new initiatives
leading to a negotiated peace.
Just as the risks of extending
the war are great, so too the
risks of seeking new initiatives
for negotiated peace are great.
But confronted by such a
choice, we believe the American
people will choose the path of

initiatives for negotiation, an
that the risks involved in sue
a choice are well worth takinc
And so we put these question
to our government:
1. Will you help our natlo
confront the choice between th
expansion of a war no one ca
"win" without destruction s
terrible as to negate its state
aim, and the immediate purs J
of a negotiated peace no one ca
"win" in the conventions
sense?
2. Will you make clear to a
that we are not trying to wi
through negotiation what w
have been unable to v
through military might, an
that we seek a peace
victory—a peace that can com
only on terms agreeable to a
at the conference table?
3. Will you make more cred
ble use than has yet been mad
of International agencies tI.J
could help us find ways to in
tiate negotiation?
IV. THE PRECONDITIONS O]
NEGOTIATION
The possibility of negotiatio
will depend in large part *
how such questions are ar
swered. Many in our nation a
ready feel that all efforts towar
a negotiated peace have bee
made by us, and that any fui
ther initiatives must come fror
the other side. But certain pr<
conditions that seem indisp
sible to negotiations are not y€
present in our policy, and wi*l
out them other nations ca
hardly be expected to take ser
ously our intent:
1. The first precondition is in
plied in our questions and- 'r
volves an assurance from ou
government that we are gei
uinely ready to negotiate, t > •
that we are not merely trying t
win diplomatically what w
have not won militarily. Ther
will be no reason for respons
from the other side unless *v
indicate a willingness to see,
peace without prior assuranc
that all details of the peace v J
follow our desires.
2. There must be some actio)
by our government to lend cred
bllity to our willingness to negc
tiate. It is increasingly ck.
that one indispensible prerequ
site is our willingness uncond
tionally to cease the bombing o
North Vietnam.
We are at an impasse v W<
have said we will not cease'. lh.
bombing until there is a slgi
from the other side of Willi £
ness to negotiate, and yet whei
such signs have come we hav
ignored them. They have s«it
they will give no further sign o
willingness to negotiate unti
we cease the bombing, and ye
when we have briefly ceased th«
bombing, no sign has come.
There is no way beyond thi
impasse until someone taker i
fresh initiative. We, as tn<
stronger nation, have both th<
obligation and the opportunlt:
to take that initiative.
The initiative must be uncor
ditional. Having ceased, we m» s
be prepared to wait until th<
other side responds. We have n»
reason to expect that a respond
will come soon, for it will tak«
time to gain credibility for ou
intent. In the interval, wtiilt
diplomatic channels are ex
plored, we will call upon
gious leaders in other countfie
to intercede and urge that
tive response be made.
3. If we truly do not intent
to dictate the terms of peace ii
advance, then we cannot eXcltidi
from the conference table anj
who are involved in the preStii
struggle. Our nation must ac
cept the National Liberate
Front as a partner in the peac<
talks in its own right. The pre
vious assurances of our leader;
have failed to state this clearly
4. Other conditions are aes'r
able, such as a de-escalation u
the ground war to a degree com
mensurate with the
necessary for those alreadj
there. But since the destiny o
all nations is involved in a nego
tiated peace, we must not seel
it unilaterally, but must ask
full cooperation of all agencie:
designed to deal with interna
tional tensions. These must *n
elude an increasing role for th<


DR MoAFEE BROWN
United Nations, and a recogni
tion of the potential role of the
International Control Commis
sion in reducing ground hostili
ty by providing an international
presence under cover of which
foreign troops might ultimately
be withdrawn from Vietnam.
Although we address these ap
peals particularly to our own
nation, we are fully aware that
negotiations involve more than
one participant, and we lay the
seriousness of our concern upon
all men everywhere to offer
further help in transforming
possibilities into realities.
V. RECOMMENDATIONS FOE
FURTHER ACTION
There are further steps that
Americans can take to indicate
our desire to play a creative
rather than destructive role in
the future of Vietnam.
1. Our Congressmen will short
ly begin debate on an appropri
ations bill. Their response to
that bill will say much about
our true intentions in Vietnam.
We urge that additional time be
allocated for a careful estimate
of the costs of the war by a
number of congressional com
mittees, such as the Joint Eco
nomic Committee, the Ways
and Means Committee, the Edu
cation and Labor Committee,
the Judiciary Committee and
the Foreign Affairs Committee,

in addition to the Appropria
tions Committee and the Armed
Services Committee, to deter
mine what costs are necessary
(1) to maintain the current level
of military operations, (2) to fi
nance new stages of build-up
and escalation, and (3) to pro
vide the type of military and
civilian security that would be
needed during a period of pro
longed negotiation. In this way,
members of the Congress can
choose the type and degree of
military operation they wish to
support.
2. We ask the Congress to re
examine the international agree
ments to which the United
States is pledged. To an unprec
edented degree, today's world
order and human life itself de
pend upon the exercise of con
straint in the conduct of for
eign affairs. The origin and con
duct of the war in Vietnam
must be examined in this light.
Particular attention must be fo
cused on the destruction of ci
vilian life and property, the use
of gas and other chemicals, and
the treatment of prisoners of
war. Our country must pledge
itself anew to conform policy
and practice in Vietnam to in
ternational law, as embodied in
the several agreements of Ge
neva and the Hague, the Nurem
berg judgments, the charter of
the United Nations, and other
such documents. The abandon
ment of constraint leads our
country and the world down the
path of brutalization and de
struction.
3. Our religious bodies must
assume a particular responsi
bility for prisoners of war in
both the north and south. We

call upon international religious
agencies to take the initiative in
developing effective programs
for speedy repatriation and hu
mane treatment of prisoners,
with special attention to nutri
tional and medical needs. Under
no circumstances can our na
tion condone brutal treatment
of prisoners on the ground that
the other side does so.
4. Wo must immediately sup
port efforts to insure that vic
tims of bombing and terroism,
particularly those who have
been burned by napalm, are
given proper hospitalization
wherever adequate facilities are
available, including the United
States. We welcome the forma
tion of the Committee of Re
sponsibility that is working to
this end, and urge governmen
tal support for its efforts.
We urge all religious organi
zations to follow the example of
the World Council of Churches
in arranging special offerings
for the relief of all victims of
warfare in Vietnam, whether in
the north or south, to be admin
istered through the Internation
al Red Cross or similar agen
cies.
5. At such time as negotia
tions have begun, further crea
tive opportunities should be op
ened up for both the public and
the private sectors of our na
tion. There will be need for the
development of a genuinely rep
resentative government in the
south. Members of our Congress
and our legal profession can of
fer their services, under the
auspices of Asian members of
such bodies as the International
Parliamentary Union, for what
ever counsel the Vietnamese de
sire in the development of a
constitutional assembly.
Those with special skills in
such fields as education, land
reform, housing, nutrition, med
icine and job training can be
prepared to help in Vietnam
during the long and involved
period of negotiations. The re
sources of various Catholic,
Protestant and Jewish relief
agencies can be coordinated for
these and other ventures, and
we urge foundations to support
extended opportunities for ser
vice in these areas.
We are eager that many of

our citizens pledge themselves
to acts of mercy and rebuilding
and reconciliation. These are a
particular American responsi
bility because of the deep mea
sure of American involvement
in acts of injury and destruc
tion. But such acts will have en
during meaning only when our
nation has pledged itself to seek
negotiated peace in more coura
geous terms than have yet been
undertaken. Otherwise we will
appear to be using small ges
tures of creativity to excuse
massive acts of ongoing destruc
tion.
Other projects should be ini
tiated even as negotiations pro
ceed, and we urge that further
suggestions be sent to Clergy
and Laymen Concerned About
Vietnam, 475 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York 10027, for
appropriate implementation.
In all such ventures, however,
there is a danger to which
Americans must be particularly
sensitive. We must not seek to
export the American way of
life, or impose an alien culture
on the Vietnamese. By insisting
that our help be channeled
through international agencies,
we can clarify our desire to
serve only as others choose to
use us, and not as we dictate.
We must convey by word, and
even more by deed, our desire
to let the Vietnamese be the ar
biters of their own destiny, and
insist only on such international
controls as will temporarily be
needed to insure that injustices
are prevented or properly recti
fied.
VI. OUR ONGOING
RESPONSIBILITY
We know that millions of
Americans share the anguish we
express, and endorse the alter
natives we propose. If they have
been silent heretofor, we plead
with them to speak up now, and
we pledge them our support. If
they have spoken earlier and
felt no resonance of public re
sponse, we plead with them to
speak again, so that together we
can create the new groundswell
of public outcry that will force
a reappraisal and a new direc
tion.
We reaffirm our own respon
sibility to urge that new direc
tion. We pledge to lay this burn

ing concern upon the con
sciences of our religious bodies,
through our local congregations,
our denominational agencies,
our councils of churches, and
our involvement in civic groups,
so that increasing pressure can
be brought to bear, through the
pulpit, the public forum, the
mass media, and the ballot box,
upon those in public life who
make our policy decisions.
As we face a difficult and dan
gerous period in the history of
man, we remember that our
task is not to assign blame for
the past, but to accept responsi
bility for the future; not to cast
the stone of condemnation, but
to offer the helping hand of re
conciliation; not to proceed self
righteously and vindictively,
but to walk humbly and repent
ently.
We who are so deeply in
volved in the immensity of the
present war must have the
courage to initiate the steps that
will lead to peace. If we do not
take those steps, we firmly be
lieve that God will judge us
harshly, and will hold us ac
countable for the horror we con
tinue to unleash. But if we do
turn about, if we seek to undo
whatever measure we can of the
wrong that has been done, then
we also firmly believe that as
we walk that long and hard and
often discouraging road, God
himself will be with us, to guide
and chasten and sustain us, and
that he will deign to use even
us in restoring some portion of
the divine creation we have so
grieviously misused.

Clery and Laymen Concerned
About Vietnam.)

I. THE NEED TO SPEAK
A time comes when silence is
betrayal. That time has come
for us in relation to Vietnam. As
members of American churches
and synagogues, we voice not
only our own convictions, but
seek also to articulate the un
expressed fears and longings of
millions of Americans.
The Old Testament forbids us
to prophecy "smooth things,"
and in the face of any evil, the
mandate of Albert Camus is laid
upon all men, whether religious
or not, that they "should speak
out, loud and clear, and that
they should voice their con

demnation in such a way that
never a doubt, never the sightest
doubt, could rise in the heart of
the simplest man. That they
should get away from abstrac
tion and confront the blood
stained face history has taken
on today."
Our share of responsibility
for that blood-stained face
haunts us today and prompts
our outcry. We confess that we
should have spoken sooner and
with clearer voice, but we do
speak now, hoping it is not too
late, adding our voice to the
voice of Pope Paul, the World
Council of Churches, the Syna
gogue Council of America, the
National Council of Churches,
the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops, and other reli
gious bodies, in urging a reap
praisal of our policy in Viet
nam.
Our allegiance to our nation
is held under a higher allegi
ance to the God who is sover
eign over all the nations. When
there is a conflict between those
allegiances, the priorities are
clear: "You shall have no other
gods before me." "We must
obey God rather than men."
Each day we find allegiance to
our nation's policy more diffi
cult to reconcile with allegiance
to our God.
Both the exercise of faith and
the expression of the democrat
ic privilege oblige us to make
our voices heard. For while we
speak as members of religious
communities, we also speak as
American citizens. Responsible
expression of disagreement and
dissent is the lifeblood of de
mocracy, and we speak out of a
loyalty that refuses to condone
in silence a national policy that
is leading our world toward dis
aster.
We speak in full awareness
that no easy answers are avail
able. But we believe that issues
must be pressed and questions
forced, if new answers are to be
forthcoming. For the old an
swers no longer satisfy us.

11. THE ONGOING ANGUISH
No one planned the type of
war in which we are involved.
It has slowly escalated from one
small move to the next small
move, each presumed to be the
last that would be necessary, so
that now we find our nation
able to offer only military an
swers to political and human
questions. We sympathize with
the dilemmas that face our
President and Congressmen in
dealing with a situation all de
cent men abhor. But a recogni
tion of past mistakes does not
entitle us to repeat and com
pound those mistakes by con
tinuing them on an ever-widen
ing scale.
We are unable to support our
nation's policy of military esca
lation, and we find those to
whom we minister caught as we
are in confusion and anguish be
cause of it.
1. This anguish is based first
of all on the immorality of the
warfare in Vietnam. We add our
voice to those who protest a
war in which civilian casualties
are greater than military; in
which whole populations are de
ported against their will; in
which the widespread use of
napalm and other explosives is
killing and maiming women,
children, and the aged; in which
the combatants are systemat
ically destroying the crops and
production capacity of a coun
try they profess to liberate; in
which the torturing of prisoners
by both sides has been common
place.
All who believe that man is
made in God's image must be
horrified by such crimes com
mitted against God and man.
There is guilt on all sides in
such a war as this, but the guilt
is ours far more than we have
courage to admit. We can only
tremble at the thought that God
is just.
2. Even those of us who rec
ognize that sometimes evil must
be done lest greater evil prevail,
feel a sense of anguish in the
inconsistency between our sta
ted aims and the consequences
they produce.
Our ongoing escalation, far
from bringing the war closer to
an end, serves rather to increase
its duration and intensity.
Our bombing of the north, far
from bringing our enemies to
their knees, serves rather to
strengthen their will to resist
us.
Our military presence in Viet
nam, far from stemming the
tide of communism, serves
rather to unite more firmly
those communist societies which
might otherwise develop sepa
rate destinies.
Our widening military involve

ment, far from demonstrating
to the world our firmness and
resolve, serves rather to make
the world suspicious of us and
fearful of our use of power.
Our unilateral action in Viet
nam, far from strengthening
our influence among other na
tions, serves rather to jeopar
dize new alliances we might be
creating.
At home, we find the war
threatening the very goals we
claim to be defending in Viet
nam. Programs to help mem
bers of minority groups realize
their own human dignity are
jeopardized if not destroyed. A
spurious type of patriotism is
challenging the right of dissent
and the open debate of public
issues. Financial and psychologi
cal preoccupation with the war
is destroying creative plans to
alleviate poverty, overcome dis
ease, extend education, replace
city slums and exalt human dig
nity. We grieve over lost oppor
tunities that may never be re
claimed.
Many of us are called upon to
counsel young men of draft age
who in conscience question our
presence in Vietnam. The moral
dilemma they face is part and
parcel of our own. Their an
guish is frequently motivated
by a high patriotism that forces
them to challenge, often at great
personal cost, policies they be
lieve will stain their nation's
honor. How can we counsel
them to participate in such a
war as this? When they decide
that they cannot condone the
war by their personal involve
ment, we must support them in
that decision.
3. Our anguish is deepened by
the discrepancy between what
we are told by our government
and what we discover is actual
ly taking- place.
We are told that the other
side gives no indication of de
sire to negotiate, and we then
discover that such indications
have been given, but that we
have responded either with re
buff or military escalation.
We are told that our nation is
prepared to negotiate with all
concerned, and we then discover
that certain of the combatants
will not be welcome at the con
ference table.
We are told that certain cities
have not been bombed, and we
then discover that they have
been.
We are told that civilian tar
gets have been avoided, ard we
then discover that they have not
been.
Such actions not only play
into the hands of those who dis
trust us, since they can consist
ently discount our word, but the
continuous discovery of discrep

ancles between our nation's
word and deed has already
shaken the confidence of our
own people in the word of their
government. We fear both the
immediate and long-range con
sequences for our nation of this
increasing deterioration of trust.
This, then, is our ongoing
anguish: a crisis of conscience
concerning what we do know,
and a crisis of confusion con
cerning what we do not know.
ni. THE NEED FOR
CLARIFICATION
The public debate is forcing
us to choose between wrong al
ternatives in Vietnam. Conse
quently, agreeing with the
American Roman Catholic
Bishops that it is "our duty to
magnify the moral voice of our
nation," we ask for clarification
of the real alternatives.
The choices usually presented
to the American people are
three (1) we could escalate rap
idly and "win the war" in the
forseeable future; or (2) we
could withdraw our troops and
accept defeat; but (3) since to
most Americans these alterna

must continue our present
course, i.e., gradually escalate
the war until the other side
capitulates to our increasing

We believe the realistic alter

a hard, bloody, increasingly bit

many years, a war we can con

development of new initiatives
leading to a negotiated peace.
Just as the risks of extending
the war are great, so too the
risks of seeking new initiatives
for negotiated peace are great.
But confronted by such a
choice, we believe the American
people will choose the path of

initiatives for negotiation, an
that the risks involved in sue
a choice are well worth takinc
And so we put these question
to our government:
1. Will you help our natlo
confront the choice between th
expansion of a war no one ca
"win" without destruction s
terrible as to negate its state
aim, and the immediate purs J
of a negotiated peace no one ca

neva and the Hague, the Nurem
berg judgments, the charter of
the United Nations, and other
such documents. The abandon
ment of constraint leads our
country and the world down the
path of brutalization and de
struction.
3. Our religious bodies must
assume a particular responsi
bility for prisoners of war in
both the north and south. We

call upon international religious
agencies to take the initiative in
developing effective programs
for speedy repatriation and hu
mane treatment of prisoners,
with special attention to nutri
tional and medical needs. Under
no circumstances can our na
tion condone brutal treatment
of prisoners on the ground that
the other side does so.
4. Wo must immediately sup
port efforts to insure that vic
tims of bombing and terroism,
particularly those who have
been burned by napalm, are
given proper hospitalization
wherever adequate facilities are
available, including the United
States. We welcome the forma
tion of the Committee of Re
sponsibility that is working to
this end, and urge governmen
tal support for its efforts.
We urge all religious organi
zations to follow the example of
the World Council of Churches
in arranging special offerings
for the relief of all victims of
warfare in Vietnam, whether in
the north or south, to be admin
istered through the Internation
al Red Cross or similar agen
cies.
5. At such time as negotia
tions have begun, further crea
tive opportunities should be op
ened up for both the public and
the private sectors of our na
tion. There will be need for the
development of a genuinely rep
resentative government in the
south. Members of our Congress
and our legal profession can of
fer their services, under the
auspices of Asian members of
such bodies as the International
Parliamentary Union, for what
ever counsel the Vietnamese de
sire in the development of a
constitutional assembly.
Those with special skills in
such fields as education, land
reform, housing, nutrition, med
icine and job training can be
prepared to help in Vietnam
during the long and involved
period of negotiations. The re
sources of various Catholic,
Protestant and Jewish relief
agencies can be coordinated for
these and other ventures, and
we urge foundations to support
extended opportunities for ser
vice in these areas.
We are eager that many of

our citizens pledge themselves
to acts of mercy and rebuilding
and reconciliation. These are a
particular American responsi
bility because of the deep mea
sure of American involvement
in acts of injury and destruc
tion. But such acts will have en
during meaning only when our
nation has pledged itself to seek
negotiated peace in more coura
geous terms than have yet been
undertaken. Otherwise we will
appear to be using small ges
tures of creativity to excuse
massive acts of ongoing destruc
tion.
Other projects should be ini
tiated even as negotiations pro
ceed, and we urge that further
suggestions be sent to Clergy
and Laymen Concerned About
Vietnam, 475 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York 10027, for
appropriate implementation.
In all such ventures, however,
there is a danger to which
Americans must be particularly
sensitive. We must not seek to
export the American way of
life, or impose an alien culture
on the Vietnamese. By insisting
that our help be channeled
through international agencies,
we can clarify our desire to
serve only as others choose to
use us, and not as we dictate.
We must convey by word, and
even more by deed, our desire
to let the Vietnamese be the ar
biters of their own destiny, and
insist only on such international
controls as will temporarily be
needed to insure that injustices
are prevented or properly recti
fied.
VI. OUR ONGOING
RESPONSIBILITY
We know that millions of
Americans share the anguish we
express, and endorse the alter
natives we propose. If they have
been silent heretofor, we plead
with them to speak up now, and
we pledge them our support. If
they have spoken earlier and
felt no resonance of public re
sponse, we plead with them to
speak again, so that together we
can create the new groundswell
of public outcry that will force
a reappraisal and a new direc
tion.
We reaffirm our own respon
sibility to urge that new direc
tion. We pledge to lay this burn

ing concern upon the con
sciences of our religious bodies,
through our local congregations,
our denominational agencies,
our councils of churches, and
our involvement in civic groups,
so that increasing pressure can
be brought to bear, through the
pulpit, the public forum, the
mass media, and the ballot box,
upon those in public life who
make our policy decisions.
As we face a difficult and dan
gerous period in the history of
man, we remember that our
task is not to assign blame for
the past, but to accept responsi
bility for the future; not to cast
the stone of condemnation, but
to offer the helping hand of re
conciliation; not to proceed self
righteously and vindictively,
but to walk humbly and repent
ently.
We who are so deeply in
volved in the immensity of the
present war must have the
courage to initiate the steps that
will lead to peace. If we do not
take those steps, we firmly be
lieve that God will judge us
harshly, and will hold us ac
countable for the horror we con
tinue to unleash. But if we do
turn about, if we seek to undo
whatever measure we can of the
wrong that has been done, then
we also firmly believe that as
we walk that long and hard and
often discouraging road, God
himself will be with us, to guide
and chasten and sustain us, and
that he will deign to use even
us in restoring some portion of
the divine creation we have so
grieviously misused.

I. THE NEED TO SPEAK
A time comes when silence is
betrayal. That time has come
for us in relation to Vietnam. As
members of American churches
and synagogues, we voice not
only our own convictions, but
seek also to articulate the un
expressed fears and longings of
millions of Americans.
The Old Testament forbids us
to prophecy "smooth things,"
and in the face of any evil, the
mandate of Albert Camus is laid
upon all men, whether religious
or not, that they "should speak
out, loud and clear, and that
they should voice their con

demnation in such a way that
never a doubt, never the sightest
doubt, could rise in the heart of
the simplest man. That they
should get away from abstrac
tion and confront the blood
stained face history has taken
on today."
Our share of responsibility
for that blood-stained face
haunts us today and prompts
our outcry. We confess that we
should have spoken sooner and
with clearer voice, but we do
speak now, hoping it is not too
late, adding our voice to the
voice of Pope Paul, the World
Council of Churches, the Syna
gogue Council of America, the
National Council of Churches,
the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops, and other reli
gious bodies, in urging a reap
praisal of our policy in Viet
nam.
Our allegiance to our nation
is held under a higher allegi
ance to the God who is sover
eign over all the nations. When
there is a conflict between those
allegiances, the priorities are
clear: "You shall have no other
gods before me." "We must
obey God rather than men."
Each day we find allegiance to
our nation's policy more diffi
cult to reconcile with allegiance
to our God.
Both the exercise of faith and
the expression of the democrat
ic privilege oblige us to make
our voices heard. For while we
speak as members of religious
communities, we also speak as
American citizens. Responsible
expression of disagreement and
dissent is the lifeblood of de
mocracy, and we speak out of a
loyalty that refuses to condone
in silence a national policy that
is leading our world toward dis
aster.
We speak in full awareness
that no easy answers are avail
able. But we believe that issues
must be pressed and questions
forced, if new answers are to be
forthcoming. For the old an
swers no longer satisfy us.

11. THE ONGOING ANGUISH
No one planned the type of
war in which we are involved.
It has slowly escalated from one
small move to the next small
move, each presumed to be the
last that would be necessary, so
that now we find our nation
able to offer only military an
swers to political and human
questions. We sympathize with
the dilemmas that face our
President and Congressmen in
dealing with a situation all de
cent men abhor. But a recogni
tion of past mistakes does not
entitle us to repeat and com
pound those mistakes by con
tinuing them on an ever-widen
ing scale.
We are unable to support our
nation's policy of military esca
lation, and we find those to
whom we minister caught as we
are in confusion and anguish be
cause of it.
1. This anguish is based first
of all on the immorality of the
warfare in Vietnam. We add our
voice to those who protest a
war in which civilian casualties
are greater than military; in
which whole populations are de
ported against their will; in
which the widespread use of
napalm and other explosives is
killing and maiming women,
children, and the aged; in which
the combatants are systemat
ically destroying the crops and
production capacity of a coun
try they profess to liberate; in
which the torturing of prisoners
by both sides has been common
place.
All who believe that man is
made in God's image must be
horrified by such crimes com
mitted against God and man.
There is guilt on all sides in
such a war as this, but the guilt
is ours far more than we have
courage to admit. We can only
tremble at the thought that God
is just.
2. Even those of us who rec
ognize that sometimes evil must
be done lest greater evil prevail,
feel a sense of anguish in the
inconsistency between our sta
ted aims and the consequences
they produce.
Our ongoing escalation, far
from bringing the war closer to
an end, serves rather to increase
its duration and intensity.
Our bombing of the north, far
from bringing our enemies to
their knees, serves rather to
strengthen their will to resist
us.
Our military presence in Viet
nam, far from stemming the
tide of communism, serves
rather to unite more firmly
those communist societies which
might otherwise develop sepa
rate destinies.
Our widening military involve

ment, far from demonstrating
to the world our firmness and
resolve, serves rather to make
the world suspicious of us and
fearful of our use of power.
Our unilateral action in Viet
nam, far from strengthening
our influence among other na
tions, serves rather to jeopar
dize new alliances we might be
creating.
At home, we find the war
threatening the very goals we
claim to be defending in Viet
nam. Programs to help mem
bers of minority groups realize
their own human dignity are
jeopardized if not destroyed. A
spurious type of patriotism is
challenging the right of dissent
and the open debate of public
issues. Financial and psychologi
cal preoccupation with the war
is destroying creative plans to
alleviate poverty, overcome dis
ease, extend education, replace
city slums and exalt human dig
nity. We grieve over lost oppor
tunities that may never be re
claimed.
Many of us are called upon to
counsel young men of draft age
who in conscience question our
presence in Vietnam. The moral
dilemma they face is part and
parcel of our own. Their an
guish is frequently motivated
by a high patriotism that forces
them to challenge, often at great
personal cost, policies they be
lieve will stain their nation's
honor. How can we counsel
them to participate in such a
war as this? When they decide
that they cannot condone the
war by their personal involve
ment, we must support them in
that decision.
3. Our anguish is deepened by
the discrepancy between what
we are told by our government
and what we discover is actual
ly taking- place.
We are told that the other
side gives no indication of de
sire to negotiate, and we then
discover that such indications
have been given, but that we
have responded either with re
buff or military escalation.
We are told that our nation is
prepared to negotiate with all
concerned, and we then discover
that certain of the combatants
will not be welcome at the con
ference table.
We are told that certain cities
have not been bombed, and we
then discover that they have
been.
We are told that civilian tar
gets have been avoided, ard we
then discover that they have not
been.
Such actions not only play
into the hands of those who dis
trust us, since they can consist
ently discount our word, but the
continuous discovery of discrep

ancles between our nation's
word and deed has already
shaken the confidence of our
own people in the word of their
government. We fear both the
immediate and long-range con
sequences for our nation of this
increasing deterioration of trust.
This, then, is our ongoing
anguish: a crisis of conscience
concerning what we do know,
and a crisis of confusion con
cerning what we do not know.
ni. THE NEED FOR
CLARIFICATION
The public debate is forcing
us to choose between wrong al
ternatives in Vietnam. Conse
quently, agreeing with the
American Roman Catholic
Bishops that it is "our duty to
magnify the moral voice of our
nation," we ask for clarification
of the real alternatives.
The choices usually presented
to the American people are
three (1) we could escalate rap
idly and "win the war" in the
forseeable future; or (2) we
could withdraw our troops and
accept defeat; but (3) since to
most Americans these alterna
tives are unsatisfactory, we
must continue our present
course, i.e., gradually escalate
the war until the other side
capitulates to our increasing
pressure.
We believe the realistic alter
natives are closer to the follow
ing: (1) we can continue to fight
a hard, bloody, increasingly bit
ter and frustrating war for
many years, a war we can con
ceivably "win," but at the price
of destroying the land and peo
ple we presume to liberate, of
sacrificing more and more of
our own young men to death,
of widening the probability that
other nations will enter the con
flict, of engendering increasing
ho s ti 1 i t y against ourselves
throughout the rest of the world,
and of emerging at the end with
no "victory" worth what it has
cost.
On the other hand, (2) we can
commit ourselves unequivocal
ly to seek now rather than later
for a negotiated peace, realizing
that history does not present us
with easy choices and that the
road to such a peace would be
long and torturous. Just as
there has been frustration and
heartache in our gradual escala
tion, so too there would be frus
tratation and heartache In the
development of new initiatives
leading to a negotiated peace.
Just as the risks of extending
the war are great, so too the
risks of seeking new initiatives
for negotiated peace are great.
But confronted by such a
choice, we believe the American
people will choose the path of

initiatives for negotiation, an
that the risks involved in sue
a choice are well worth takinc
And so we put these question
to our government:
1. Will you help our natlo
confront the choice between th
expansion of a war no one ca
"win" without destruction s
terrible as to negate its state
aim, and the immediate purs J
of a negotiated peace no one ca
"win" in the conventions
sense?
2. Will you make clear to a
that we are not trying to wi
through negotiation what w
have been unable to v
through military might, an
that we seek a peace
victory—a peace that can com
only on terms agreeable to a
at the conference table?
3. Will you make more cred
ble use than has yet been mad
of International agencies tI.J
could help us find ways to in
tiate negotiation?
IV. THE PRECONDITIONS O]
NEGOTIATION
The possibility of negotiatio
will depend in large part *
how such questions are ar
swered. Many in our nation a
ready feel that all efforts towar
a negotiated peace have bee
made by us, and that any fui
ther initiatives must come fror
the other side. But certain pr<
conditions that seem indisp
sible to negotiations are not y€
present in our policy, and wi*l
out them other nations ca
hardly be expected to take ser
ously our intent:
1. The first precondition is in
plied in our questions and- 'r
volves an assurance from ou
government that we are gei
uinely ready to negotiate, t > •
that we are not merely trying t
win diplomatically what w
have not won militarily. Ther
will be no reason for respons
from the other side unless *v
indicate a willingness to see,
peace without prior assuranc
that all details of the peace v J
follow our desires.
2. There must be some actio)
by our government to lend cred
bllity to our willingness to negc
tiate. It is increasingly ck.
that one indispensible prerequ
site is our willingness uncond
tionally to cease the bombing o
North Vietnam.
We are at an impasse v W<
have said we will not cease'. lh.
bombing until there is a slgi
from the other side of Willi £
ness to negotiate, and yet whei
such signs have come we hav
ignored them. They have s«it
they will give no further sign o
willingness to negotiate unti
we cease the bombing, and ye
when we have briefly ceased th«
bombing, no sign has come.
There is no way beyond thi
impasse until someone taker i
fresh initiative. We, as tn<
stronger nation, have both th<
obligation and the opportunlt:
to take that initiative.
The initiative must be uncor
ditional. Having ceased, we m» s
be prepared to wait until th<
other side responds. We have n»
reason to expect that a respond
will come soon, for it will tak«
time to gain credibility for ou
intent. In the interval, wtiilt
diplomatic channels are ex
plored, we will call upon
gious leaders in other countfie
to intercede and urge that
tive response be made.
3. If we truly do not intent
to dictate the terms of peace ii
advance, then we cannot eXcltidi
from the conference table anj
who are involved in the preStii
struggle. Our nation must ac
cept the National Liberate
Front as a partner in the peac<
talks in its own right. The pre
vious assurances of our leader;
have failed to state this clearly
4. Other conditions are aes'r
able, such as a de-escalation u
the ground war to a degree com
mensurate with the
necessary for those alreadj
there. But since the destiny o
all nations is involved in a nego
tiated peace, we must not seel
it unilaterally, but must ask
full cooperation of all agencie:
designed to deal with interna
tional tensions. These must *n
elude an increasing role for th<


DR MoAFEE BROWN
United Nations, and a recogni
tion of the potential role of the
International Control Commis
sion in reducing ground hostili
ty by providing an international
presence under cover of which
foreign troops might ultimately
be withdrawn from Vietnam.
Although we address these ap
peals particularly to our own
nation, we are fully aware that
negotiations involve more than
one participant, and we lay the
seriousness of our concern upon
all men everywhere to offer
further help in transforming
possibilities into realities.
V. RECOMMENDATIONS FOE
FURTHER ACTION
There are further steps that
Americans can take to indicate
our desire to play a creative
rather than destructive role in
the future of Vietnam.
1. Our Congressmen will short
ly begin debate on an appropri
ations bill. Their response to
that bill will say much about
our true intentions in Vietnam.
We urge that additional time be
allocated for a careful estimate
of the costs of the war by a
number of congressional com
mittees, such as the Joint Eco
nomic Committee, the Ways
and Means Committee, the Edu
cation and Labor Committee,
the Judiciary Committee and
the Foreign Affairs Committee,

in addition to the Appropria
tions Committee and the Armed
Services Committee, to deter
mine what costs are necessary
(1) to maintain the current level
of military operations, (2) to fi
nance new stages of build-up
and escalation, and (3) to pro
vide the type of military and
civilian security that would be
needed during a period of pro
longed negotiation. In this way,
members of the Congress can
choose the type and degree of
military operation they wish to
support.
2. We ask the Congress to re
examine the international agree
ments to which the United
States is pledged. To an unprec
edented degree, today's world
order and human life itself de
pend upon the exercise of con
straint in the conduct of for
eign affairs. The origin and con
duct of the war in Vietnam
must be examined in this light.
Particular attention must be fo
cused on the destruction of ci
vilian life and property, the use
of gas and other chemicals, and
the treatment of prisoners of
war. Our country must pledge
itself anew to conform policy
and practice in Vietnam to in
ternational law, as embodied in
the several agreements of Ge
neva and the Hague, the Nurem
berg judgments, the charter of
the United Nations, and other
such documents. The abandon
ment of constraint leads our
country and the world down the
path of brutalization and de
struction.
3. Our religious bodies must
assume a particular responsi
bility for prisoners of war in
both the north and south. We

call upon international religious
agencies to take the initiative in
developing effective programs
for speedy repatriation and hu
mane treatment of prisoners,
with special attention to nutri
tional and medical needs. Under
no circumstances can our na
tion condone brutal treatment
of prisoners on the ground that
the other side does so.
4. Wo must immediately sup
port efforts to insure that vic
tims of bombing and terroism,
particularly those who have
been burned by napalm, are
given proper hospitalization
wherever adequate facilities are
available, including the United
States. We welcome the forma
tion of the Committee of Re
sponsibility that is working to
this end, and urge governmen
tal support for its efforts.
We urge all religious organi
zations to follow the example of
the World Council of Churches
in arranging special offerings
for the relief of all victims of
warfare in Vietnam, whether in
the north or south, to be admin
istered through the Internation
al Red Cross or similar agen
cies.
5. At such time as negotia
tions have begun, further crea
tive opportunities should be op
ened up for both the public and
the private sectors of our na
tion. There will be need for the
development of a genuinely rep
resentative government in the
south. Members of our Congress
and our legal profession can of
fer their services, under the
auspices of Asian members of
such bodies as the International
Parliamentary Union, for what
ever counsel the Vietnamese de
sire in the development of a
constitutional assembly.
Those with special skills in
such fields as education, land
reform, housing, nutrition, med
icine and job training can be
prepared to help in Vietnam
during the long and involved
period of negotiations. The re
sources of various Catholic,
Protestant and Jewish relief
agencies can be coordinated for
these and other ventures, and
we urge foundations to support
extended opportunities for ser
vice in these areas.
We are eager that many of

our citizens pledge themselves
to acts of mercy and rebuilding
and reconciliation. These are a
particular American responsi
bility because of the deep mea
sure of American involvement
in acts of injury and destruc
tion. But such acts will have en

nation has pledged itself to seek
negotiated peace in more coura
geous terms than have yet been
undertaken. Otherwise we will
appear to be using small ges
tures of creativity to excuse
massive acts of ongoing destruc
tion.
Other projects should be ini
tiated even as negotiations pro
ceed, and we urge that further
suggestions be sent to Clergy
and Laymen Concerned About
Vietnam, 475 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York 10027, for
appropriate implementation.
In all such ventures, however,
there is a danger to which
Americans must be particularly
sensitive. We must not seek to
export the American way of
life, or impose an alien culture
on the Vietnamese. By insisting
that our help be channeled
through international agencies,
we can clarify our desire to

tinuing them on an ever-widen
ing scale.
We are unable to support our
nation's policy of military esca
lation, and we find those to
whom we minister caught as we
are in confusion and anguish be
cause of it.
1. This anguish is based first
of all on the immorality of the
warfare in Vietnam. We add our
voice to those who protest a
war in which civilian casualties
are greater than military; in
which whole populations are de
ported against their will; in
which the widespread use of
napalm and other explosives is
killing and maiming women,
children, and the aged; in which
the combatants are systemat
ically destroying the crops and
production capacity of a coun
try they profess to liberate; in
which the torturing of prisoners
by both sides has been common
place.
All who believe that man is
made in God's image must be
horrified by such crimes com
mitted against God and man.
There is guilt on all sides in
such a war as this, but the guilt
is ours far more than we have
courage to admit. We can only
tremble at the thought that God
is just.
2. Even those of us who rec
ognize that sometimes evil must
be done lest greater evil prevail,
feel a sense of anguish in the
inconsistency between our sta
ted aims and the consequences
they produce.
Our ongoing escalation, far
from bringing the war closer to
an end, serves rather to increase
its duration and intensity.
Our bombing of the north, far
from bringing our enemies to
their knees, serves rather to
strengthen their will to resist
us.
Our military presence in Viet
nam, far from stemming the
tide of communism, serves
rather to unite more firmly
those communist societies which
might otherwise develop sepa
rate destinies.
Our widening military involve

ment, far from demonstrating
to the world our firmness and
resolve, serves rather to make
the world suspicious of us and
fearful of our use of power.
Our unilateral action in Viet
nam, far from strengthening
our influence among other na
tions, serves rather to jeopar
dize new alliances we might be
creating.
At home, we find the war
threatening the very goals we
claim to be defending in Viet
nam. Programs to help mem
bers of minority groups realize
their own human dignity are
jeopardized if not destroyed. A
spurious type of patriotism is
challenging the right of dissent
and the open debate of public
issues. Financial and psychologi
cal preoccupation with the war
is destroying creative plans to
alleviate poverty, overcome dis
ease, extend education, replace
city slums and exalt human dig
nity. We grieve over lost oppor
tunities that may never be re
claimed.
Many of us are called upon to
counsel young men of draft age
who in conscience question our
presence in Vietnam. The moral
dilemma they face is part and
parcel of our own. Their an
guish is frequently motivated
by a high patriotism that forces
them to challenge, often at great
personal cost, policies they be
lieve will stain their nation's
honor. How can we counsel
them to participate in such a
war as this? When they decide
that they cannot condone the
war by their personal involve
ment, we must support them in
that decision.
3. Our anguish is deepened by
the discrepancy between what
we are told by our government
and what we discover is actual
ly taking- place.
We are told that the other
side gives no indication of de
sire to negotiate, and we then
discover that such indications
have been given, but that we
have responded either with re
buff or military escalation.
We are told that our nation is
prepared to negotiate with all
concerned, and we then discover
that certain of the combatants
will not be welcome at the con
ference table.
We are told that certain cities
have not been bombed, and we
then discover that they have
been.
We are told that civilian tar
gets have been avoided, ard we
then discover that they have not
been.
Such actions not only play
into the hands of those who dis
trust us, since they can consist
ently discount our word, but the
continuous discovery of discrep

ancles between our nation's
word and deed has already
shaken the confidence of our
own people in the word of their
government. We fear both the
immediate and long-range con
sequences for our nation of this
increasing deterioration of trust.
This, then, is our ongoing
anguish: a crisis of conscience
concerning what we do know,
and a crisis of confusion con
cerning what we do not know.
ni. THE NEED FOR
CLARIFICATION
The public debate is forcing
us to choose between wrong al
ternatives in Vietnam. Conse
quently, agreeing with the
American Roman Catholic
Bishops that it is "our duty to
magnify the moral voice of our
nation," we ask for clarification
of the real alternatives.
The choices usually presented
to the American people are
three (1) we could escalate rap
idly and "win the war" in the
forseeable future; or (2) we
could withdraw our troops and
accept defeat; but (3) since to
most Americans these alterna
tives are unsatisfactory, we
must continue our present
course, i.e., gradually escalate
the war until the other side
capitulates to our increasing
pressure.
We believe the realistic alter
natives are closer to the follow
ing: (1) we can continue to fight
a hard, bloody, increasingly bit
ter and frustrating war for
many years, a war we can con
ceivably "win," but at the price
of destroying the land and peo
ple we presume to liberate, of
sacrificing more and more of
our own young men to death,
of widening the probability that
other nations will enter the con
flict, of engendering increasing
ho s ti 1 i t y against ourselves
throughout the rest of the world,
and of emerging at the end with
no "victory" worth what it has
cost.
On the other hand, (2) we can
commit ourselves unequivocal
ly to seek now rather than later
for a negotiated peace, realizing
that history does not present us
with easy choices and that the
road to such a peace would be
long and torturous. Just as
there has been frustration and
heartache in our gradual escala
tion, so too there would be frus
tratation and heartache In the
development of new initiatives
leading to a negotiated peace.
Just as the risks of extending
the war are great, so too the
risks of seeking new initiatives
for negotiated peace are great.
But confronted by such a
choice, we believe the American
people will choose the path of

initiatives for negotiation, an
that the risks involved in sue
a choice are well worth takinc
And so we put these question
to our government:
1. Will you help our natlo
confront the choice between th
expansion of a war no one ca
"win" without destruction s
terrible as to negate its state
aim, and the immediate purs J
of a negotiated peace no one ca
"win" in the conventions
sense?
2. Will you make clear to a
that we are not trying to wi
through negotiation what w
have been unable to v
through military might, an
that we seek a peace
victory—a peace that can com
only on terms agreeable to a
at the conference table?
3. Will you make more cred
ble use than has yet been mad
of International agencies tI.J
could help us find ways to in
tiate negotiation?
IV. THE PRECONDITIONS O]
NEGOTIATION
The possibility of negotiatio
will depend in large part *
how such questions are ar
swered. Many in our nation a
ready feel that all efforts towar
a negotiated peace have bee
made by us, and that any fui
ther initiatives must come fror
the other side. But certain pr<
conditions that seem indisp
sible to negotiations are not y€
present in our policy, and wi*l
out them other nations ca
hardly be expected to take ser
ously our intent:
1. The first precondition is in
plied in our questions and- 'r
volves an assurance from ou
government that we are gei
uinely ready to negotiate, t > •
that we are not merely trying t
win diplomatically what w
have not won militarily. Ther
will be no reason for respons
from the other side unless *v
indicate a willingness to see,
peace without prior assuranc
that all details of the peace v J
follow our desires.
2. There must be some actio)
by our government to lend cred
bllity to our willingness to negc
tiate. It is increasingly ck.
that one indispensible prerequ
site is our willingness uncond
tionally to cease the bombing o
North Vietnam.
We are at an impasse v W<
have said we will not cease'. lh.
bombing until there is a slgi
from the other side of Willi £
ness to negotiate, and yet whei
such signs have come we hav
ignored them. They have s«it
they will give no further sign o
willingness to negotiate unti
we cease the bombing, and ye
when we have briefly ceased th«
bombing, no sign has come.
There is no way beyond thi
impasse until someone taker i
fresh initiative. We, as tn<
stronger nation, have both th<
obligation and the opportunlt:
to take that initiative.
The initiative must be uncor
ditional. Having ceased, we m» s
be prepared to wait until th<
other side responds. We have n»
reason to expect that a respond
will come soon, for it will tak«
time to gain credibility for ou
intent. In the interval, wtiilt
diplomatic channels are ex
plored, we will call upon
gious leaders in other countfie
to intercede and urge that
tive response be made.
3. If we truly do not intent
to dictate the terms of peace ii
advance, then we cannot eXcltidi
from the conference table anj
who are involved in the preStii
struggle. Our nation must ac
cept the National Liberate
Front as a partner in the peac<
talks in its own right. The pre
vious assurances of our leader;
have failed to state this clearly
4. Other conditions are aes'r
able, such as a de-escalation u
the ground war to a degree com
mensurate with the
necessary for those alreadj
there. But since the destiny o
all nations is involved in a nego
tiated peace, we must not seel
it unilaterally, but must ask
full cooperation of all agencie:
designed to deal with interna
tional tensions. These must *n
elude an increasing role for th<


DR MoAFEE BROWN
United Nations, and a recogni
tion of the potential role of the
International Control Commis
sion in reducing ground hostili
ty by providing an international
presence under cover of which
foreign troops might ultimately
be withdrawn from Vietnam.
Although we address these ap
peals particularly to our own
nation, we are fully aware that
negotiations involve more than
one participant, and we lay the
seriousness of our concern upon
all men everywhere to offer
further help in transforming
possibilities into realities.
V. RECOMMENDATIONS FOE
FURTHER ACTION
There are further steps that
Americans can take to indicate
our desire to play a creative
rather than destructive role in
the future of Vietnam.
1. Our Congressmen will short
ly begin debate on an appropri
ations bill. Their response to
that bill will say much about
our true intentions in Vietnam.
We urge that additional time be
allocated for a careful estimate
of the costs of the war by a
number of congressional com
mittees, such as the Joint Eco
nomic Committee, the Ways
and Means Committee, the Edu
cation and Labor Committee,
the Judiciary Committee and
the Foreign Affairs Committee,

in addition to the Appropria
tions Committee and the Armed
Services Committee, to deter
mine what costs are necessary
(1) to maintain the current level
of military operations, (2) to fi
nance new stages of build-up
and escalation, and (3) to pro
vide the type of military and
civilian security that would be
needed during a period of pro
longed negotiation. In this way,
members of the Congress can
choose the type and degree of
military operation they wish to
support.
2. We ask the Congress to re
examine the international agree
ments to which the United
States is pledged. To an unprec
edented degree, today's world
order and human life itself de
pend upon the exercise of con
straint in the conduct of for
eign affairs. The origin and con
duct of the war in Vietnam
must be examined in this light.
Particular attention must be fo
cused on the destruction of ci
vilian life and property, the use
of gas and other chemicals, and
the treatment of prisoners of
war. Our country must pledge
itself anew to conform policy
and practice in Vietnam to in
ternational law, as embodied in
the several agreements of Ge
neva and the Hague, the Nurem
berg judgments, the charter of
the United Nations, and other
such documents. The abandon
ment of constraint leads our
country and the world down the
path of brutalization and de
struction.
3. Our religious bodies must
assume a particular responsi
bility for prisoners of war in
both the north and south. We

call upon international religious
agencies to take the initiative in
developing effective programs
for speedy repatriation and hu
mane treatment of prisoners,
with special attention to nutri
tional and medical needs. Under
no circumstances can our na
tion condone brutal treatment
of prisoners on the ground that
the other side does so.
4. Wo must immediately sup
port efforts to insure that vic
tims of bombing and terroism,
particularly those who have
been burned by napalm, are
given proper hospitalization
wherever adequate facilities are
available, including the United
States. We welcome the forma
tion of the Committee of Re
sponsibility that is working to
this end, and urge governmen
tal support for its efforts.
We urge all religious organi
zations to follow the example of
the World Council of Churches
in arranging special offerings
for the relief of all victims of
warfare in Vietnam, whether in
the north or south, to be admin
istered through the Internation
al Red Cross or similar agen
cies.
5. At such time as negotia
tions have begun, further crea
tive opportunities should be op
ened up for both the public and
the private sectors of our na
tion. There will be need for the
development of a genuinely rep
resentative government in the
south. Members of our Congress
and our legal profession can of
fer their services, under the
auspices of Asian members of
such bodies as the International
Parliamentary Union, for what
ever counsel the Vietnamese de
sire in the development of a
constitutional assembly.
Those with special skills in
such fields as education, land
reform, housing, nutrition, med
icine and job training can be
prepared to help in Vietnam
during the long and involved
period of negotiations. The re
sources of various Catholic,
Protestant and Jewish relief
agencies can be coordinated for
these and other ventures, and
we urge foundations to support
extended opportunities for ser
vice in these areas.
We are eager that many of

our citizens pledge themselves
to acts of mercy and rebuilding
and reconciliation. These are a
particular American responsi
bility because of the deep mea
sure of American involvement
in acts of injury and destruc
tion. But such acts will have en
during meaning only when our
nation has pledged itself to seek
negotiated peace in more coura
geous terms than have yet been
undertaken. Otherwise we will
appear to be using small ges
tures of creativity to excuse
massive acts of ongoing destruc
tion.
Other projects should be ini
tiated even as negotiations pro
ceed, and we urge that further
suggestions be sent to Clergy
and Laymen Concerned About
Vietnam, 475 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York 10027, for
appropriate implementation.
In all such ventures, however,
there is a danger to which
Americans must be particularly
sensitive. We must not seek to
export the American way of
life, or impose an alien culture
on the Vietnamese. By insisting
that our help be channeled
through international agencies,
we can clarify our desire to
serve only as others choose to
use us, and not as we dictate.
We must convey by word, and
even more by deed, our desire
to let the Vietnamese be the ar
biters of their own destiny, and
insist only on such international
controls as will temporarily be
needed to insure that injustices
are prevented or properly recti
fied.
VI. OUR ONGOING
RESPONSIBILITY
We know that millions of
Americans share the anguish we
express, and endorse the alter
natives we propose. If they have
been silent heretofor, we plead
with them to speak up now, and
we pledge them our support. If
they have spoken earlier and
felt no resonance of public re
sponse, we plead with them to
speak again, so that together we
can create the new groundswell
of public outcry that will force
a reappraisal and a new direc
tion.
We reaffirm our own respon
sibility to urge that new direc
tion. We pledge to lay this burn

ing concern upon the con
sciences of our religious bodies,
through our local congregations,
our denominational agencies,
our councils of churches, and
our involvement in civic groups,
so that increasing pressure can
be brought to bear, through the
pulpit, the public forum, the
mass media, and the ballot box,
upon those in public life who
make our policy decisions.
As we face a difficult and dan
gerous period in the history of
man, we remember that our
task is not to assign blame for
the past, but to accept responsi
bility for the future; not to cast
the stone of condemnation, but
to offer the helping hand of re
conciliation; not to proceed self
righteously and vindictively,
but to walk humbly and repent
ently.
We who are so deeply in
volved in the immensity of the
present war must have the
courage to initiate the steps that
will lead to peace. If we do not
take those steps, we firmly be
lieve that God will judge us
harshly, and will hold us ac
countable for the horror we con
tinue to unleash. But if we do
turn about, if we seek to undo
whatever measure we can of the
wrong that has been done, then
we also firmly believe that as
we walk that long and hard and
often discouraging road, God
himself will be with us, to guide
and chasten and sustain us, and
that he will deign to use even
us in restoring some portion of
the divine creation we have so
grieviously misused.

I. THE NEED TO SPEAK
A time comes when silence is
betrayal. That time has come
for us in relation to Vietnam. As
members of American churches
and synagogues, we voice not
only our own convictions, but
seek also to articulate the un
expressed fears and longings of
millions of Americans.
The Old Testament forbids us
to prophecy "smooth things,"
and in the face of any evil, the
mandate of Albert Camus is laid
upon all men, whether religious
or not, that they "should speak
out, loud and clear, and that
they should voice their con

demnation in such a way that
never a doubt, never the sightest
doubt, could rise in the heart of
the simplest man. That they
should get away from abstrac
tion and confront the blood
stained face history has taken
on today."
Our share of responsibility
for that blood-stained face
haunts us today and prompts
our outcry. We confess that we
should have spoken sooner and
with clearer voice, but we do
speak now, hoping it is not too
late, adding our voice to the
voice of Pope Paul, the World
Council of Churches, the Syna
gogue Council of America, the
National Council of Churches,
the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops, and other reli
gious bodies, in urging a reap
praisal of our policy in Viet
nam.
Our allegiance to our nation
is held under a higher allegi
ance to the God who is sover
eign over all the nations. When
there is a conflict between those
allegiances, the priorities are
clear: "You shall have no other
gods before me." "We must
obey God rather than men."
Each day we find allegiance to
our nation's policy more diffi
cult to reconcile with allegiance
to our God.
Both the exercise of faith and
the expression of the democrat
ic privilege oblige us to make
our voices heard. For while we
speak as members of religious
communities, we also speak as
American citizens. Responsible
expression of disagreement and
dissent is the lifeblood of de
mocracy, and we speak out of a
loyalty that refuses to condone
in silence a national policy that
is leading our world toward dis
aster.
We speak in full awareness
that no easy answers are avail
able. But we believe that issues
must be pressed and questions
forced, if new answers are to be
forthcoming. For the old an
swers no longer satisfy us.

11. THE ONGOING ANGUISH
No one planned the type of
war in which we are involved.
It has slowly escalated from one
small move to the next small
move, each presumed to be the
last that would be necessary, so
that now we find our nation
able to offer only military an
swers to political and human
questions. We sympathize with
the dilemmas that face our
President and Congressmen in
dealing with a situation all de
cent men abhor. But a recogni
tion of past mistakes does not
entitle us to repeat and com
pound those mistakes by con
tinuing them on an ever-widen
ing scale.
We are unable to support our
nation's policy of military esca
lation, and we find those to
whom we minister caught as we
are in confusion and anguish be
cause of it.
1. This anguish is based first
of all on the immorality of the
warfare in Vietnam. We add our
voice to those who protest a
war in which civilian casualties
are greater than military; in
which whole populations are de
ported against their will; in
which the widespread use of
napalm and other explosives is

children, and the aged; in which
the combatants are systemat
ically destroying the crops and
production capacity of a coun
try they profess to liberate; in
which the torturing of prisoners
by both sides has been common
place.
All who believe that man is
made in God's image must be
horrified by such crimes com
mitted against God and man.
There is guilt on all sides in
such a war as this, but the guilt
is ours far more than we have
courage to admit. We can only
tremble at the thought that God
is just.
2. Even those of us who rec
ognize that sometimes evil must
be done lest greater evil prevail,
feel a sense of anguish in the
inconsistency between our sta
ted aims and the consequences
they produce.
Our ongoing escalation, far
from bringing the war closer to
an end, serves rather to increase
its duration and intensity.
Our bombing of the north, far
from bringing our enemies to
their knees, serves rather to
strengthen their will to resist
us.
Our military presence in Viet

rather to unite more firmly

might otherwise develop sepa

Our widening military involve

the world suspicious of us and
fearful of our use of power.
Our unilateral action in Viet

creating.
At home, we find the war
threatening the very goals we
claim to be defending in Viet

bers of minority groups realize
their own human dignity are
jeopardized if not destroyed. A
spurious type of patriotism is
challenging the right of dissent
and the open debate of public

cal preoccupation with the war
is destroying creative plans to
alleviate poverty, overcome dis

them to participate in such a
war as this? When they decide
that they cannot condone the

that decision.
3. Our anguish is deepened by
the discrepancy between what
we are told by our government
and what we discover is actual
ly taking- place.
We are told that the other

discover that such indications

We are told that our nation is

We are told that certain cities

We are told that civilian tar

Such actions not only play

continuous discovery of discrep

ancles between our nation's
word and deed has already
shaken the confidence of our
own people in the word of their
government. We fear both the
immediate and long-range con
sequences for our nation of this
increasing deterioration of trust.
This, then, is our ongoing
anguish: a crisis of conscience
concerning what we do know,
and a crisis of confusion con
cerning what we do not know.

us to choose between wrong al

of the real alternatives.
The choices usually presented

fresh initiative. We, as tn<
stronger nation, have both th<
obligation and the opportunlt:
to take that initiative.
The initiative must be uncor
ditional. Having ceased, we m» s
be prepared to wait until th<
other side responds. We have n»
reason to expect that a respond
will come soon, for it will tak«
time to gain credibility for ou
intent. In the interval, wtiilt
diplomatic channels are ex
plored, we will call upon
gious leaders in other countfie
to intercede and urge that
tive response be made.
3. If we truly do not intent
to dictate the terms of peace ii
advance, then we cannot eXcltidi
from the conference table anj
who are involved in the preStii
struggle. Our nation must ac
cept the National Liberate
Front as a partner in the peac<
talks in its own right. The pre
vious assurances of our leader;
have failed to state this clearly
4. Other conditions are aes'r
able, such as a de-escalation u
the ground war to a degree com
mensurate with the
necessary for those alreadj
there. But since the destiny o
all nations is involved in a nego
tiated peace, we must not seel
it unilaterally, but must ask
full cooperation of all agencie:
designed to deal with interna
tional tensions. These must *n
elude an increasing role for th<


DR MoAFEE BROWN
United Nations, and a recogni
tion of the potential role of the
International Control Commis
sion in reducing ground hostili
ty by providing an international
presence under cover of which
foreign troops might ultimately
be withdrawn from Vietnam.
Although we address these ap
peals particularly to our own
nation, we are fully aware that
negotiations involve more than
one participant, and we lay the
seriousness of our concern upon
all men everywhere to offer
further help in transforming
possibilities into realities.
V. RECOMMENDATIONS FOE
FURTHER ACTION
There are further steps that
Americans can take to indicate
our desire to play a creative
rather than destructive role in
the future of Vietnam.
1. Our Congressmen will short
ly begin debate on an appropri
ations bill. Their response to
that bill will say much about
our true intentions in Vietnam.
We urge that additional time be
allocated for a careful estimate
of the costs of the war by a
number of congressional com
mittees, such as the Joint Eco
nomic Committee, the Ways
and Means Committee, the Edu
cation and Labor Committee,
the Judiciary Committee and
the Foreign Affairs Committee,

in addition to the Appropria
tions Committee and the Armed
Services Committee, to deter
mine what costs are necessary
(1) to maintain the current level
of military operations, (2) to fi
nance new stages of build-up
and escalation, and (3) to pro
vide the type of military and
civilian security that would be
needed during a period of pro
longed negotiation. In this way,
members of the Congress can
choose the type and degree of
military operation they wish to
support.
2. We ask the Congress to re
examine the international agree
ments to which the United
States is pledged. To an unprec
edented degree, today's world
order and human life itself de
pend upon the exercise of con
straint in the conduct of for
eign affairs. The origin and con
duct of the war in Vietnam
must be examined in this light.
Particular attention must be fo
cused on the destruction of ci
vilian life and property, the use
of gas and other chemicals, and
the treatment of prisoners of
war. Our country must pledge
itself anew to conform policy
and practice in Vietnam to in
ternational law, as embodied in
the several agreements of Ge
neva and the Hague, the Nurem
berg judgments, the charter of
the United Nations, and other
such documents. The abandon
ment of constraint leads our
country and the world down the
path of brutalization and de
struction.
3. Our religious bodies must
assume a particular responsi
bility for prisoners of war in
both the north and south. We

call upon international religious
agencies to take the initiative in
developing effective programs
for speedy repatriation and hu
mane treatment of prisoners,
with special attention to nutri
tional and medical needs. Under
no circumstances can our na
tion condone brutal treatment
of prisoners on the ground that
the other side does so.
4. Wo must immediately sup
port efforts to insure that vic
tims of bombing and terroism,
particularly those who have
been burned by napalm, are
given proper hospitalization
wherever adequate facilities are
available, including the United
States. We welcome the forma
tion of the Committee of Re
sponsibility that is working to
this end, and urge governmen
tal support for its efforts.
We urge all religious organi
zations to follow the example of
the World Council of Churches
in arranging special offerings
for the relief of all victims of
warfare in Vietnam, whether in
the north or south, to be admin
istered through the Internation
al Red Cross or similar agen
cies.
5. At such time as negotia
tions have begun, further crea
tive opportunities should be op
ened up for both the public and
the private sectors of our na
tion. There will be need for the
development of a genuinely rep
resentative government in the
south. Members of our Congress
and our legal profession can of
fer their services, under the
auspices of Asian members of
such bodies as the International
Parliamentary Union, for what
ever counsel the Vietnamese de
sire in the development of a
constitutional assembly.
Those with special skills in
such fields as education, land
reform, housing, nutrition, med
icine and job training can be
prepared to help in Vietnam
during the long and involved
period of negotiations. The re
sources of various Catholic,
Protestant and Jewish relief
agencies can be coordinated for
these and other ventures, and
we urge foundations to support
extended opportunities for ser
vice in these areas.
We are eager that many of

our citizens pledge themselves
to acts of mercy and rebuilding
and reconciliation. These are a
particular American responsi
bility because of the deep mea
sure of American involvement
in acts of injury and destruc
tion. But such acts will have en
during meaning only when our
nation has pledged itself to seek
negotiated peace in more coura
geous terms than have yet been
undertaken. Otherwise we will
appear to be using small ges
tures of creativity to excuse
massive acts of ongoing destruc
tion.
Other projects should be ini
tiated even as negotiations pro
ceed, and we urge that further
suggestions be sent to Clergy
and Laymen Concerned About
Vietnam, 475 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York 10027, for
appropriate implementation.
In all such ventures, however,
there is a danger to which
Americans must be particularly
sensitive. We must not seek to
export the American way of
life, or impose an alien culture
on the Vietnamese. By insisting
that our help be channeled
through international agencies,
we can clarify our desire to
serve only as others choose to
use us, and not as we dictate.
We must convey by word, and
even more by deed, our desire
to let the Vietnamese be the ar
biters of their own destiny, and
insist only on such international
controls as will temporarily be
needed to insure that injustices
are prevented or properly recti
fied.
VI. OUR ONGOING
RESPONSIBILITY
We know that millions of
Americans share the anguish we
express, and endorse the alter
natives we propose. If they have
been silent heretofor, we plead
with them to speak up now, and
we pledge them our support. If
they have spoken earlier and
felt no resonance of public re
sponse, we plead with them to
speak again, so that together we
can create the new groundswell
of public outcry that will force
a reappraisal and a new direc
tion.
We reaffirm our own respon
sibility to urge that new direc
tion. We pledge to lay this burn

ing concern upon the con
sciences of our religious bodies,
through our local congregations,
our denominational agencies,
our councils of churches, and
our involvement in civic groups,
so that increasing pressure can
be brought to bear, through the
pulpit, the public forum, the
mass media, and the ballot box,
upon those in public life who
make our policy decisions.
As we face a difficult and dan
gerous period in the history of
man, we remember that our
task is not to assign blame for
the past, but to accept responsi
bility for the future; not to cast
the stone of condemnation, but
to offer the helping hand of re
conciliation; not to proceed self
righteously and vindictively,
but to walk humbly and repent
ently.
We who are so deeply in
volved in the immensity of the
present war must have the
courage to initiate the steps that
will lead to peace. If we do not
take those steps, we firmly be
lieve that God will judge us
harshly, and will hold us ac
countable for the horror we con
tinue to unleash. But if we do
turn about, if we seek to undo
whatever measure we can of the
wrong that has been done, then
we also firmly believe that as
we walk that long and hard and
often discouraging road, God
himself will be with us, to guide
and chasten and sustain us, and
that he will deign to use even
us in restoring some portion of
the divine creation we have so
grieviously misused.
