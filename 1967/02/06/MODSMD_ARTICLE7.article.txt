About Vietnam.)

I. THE NEED TO SPEAK
A time comes when silence is
betrayal. That time has come
for us in relation to Vietnam. As
members of American churches
and synagogues, we voice not
only our own convictions, but
seek also to articulate the un
expressed fears and longings of
millions of Americans.
The Old Testament forbids us
to prophecy "smooth things,"
and in the face of any evil, the
mandate of Albert Camus is laid
upon all men, whether religious
or not, that they "should speak
out, loud and clear, and that
they should voice their con

demnation in such a way that
never a doubt, never the sightest
doubt, could rise in the heart of
the simplest man. That they
should get away from abstrac
tion and confront the blood
stained face history has taken
on today."
Our share of responsibility
for that blood-stained face
haunts us today and prompts
our outcry. We confess that we
should have spoken sooner and
with clearer voice, but we do
speak now, hoping it is not too
late, adding our voice to the
voice of Pope Paul, the World
Council of Churches, the Syna
gogue Council of America, the
National Council of Churches,
the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops, and other reli
gious bodies, in urging a reap
praisal of our policy in Viet
nam.
Our allegiance to our nation
is held under a higher allegi
ance to the God who is sover
eign over all the nations. When
there is a conflict between those
allegiances, the priorities are
clear: "You shall have no other
gods before me." "We must
obey God rather than men."
Each day we find allegiance to
our nation's policy more diffi
cult to reconcile with allegiance
to our God.
Both the exercise of faith and
the expression of the democrat
ic privilege oblige us to make
our voices heard. For while we
speak as members of religious
communities, we also speak as
American citizens. Responsible
expression of disagreement and
dissent is the lifeblood of de
mocracy, and we speak out of a
loyalty that refuses to condone
in silence a national policy that
is leading our world toward dis
aster.
We speak in full awareness
that no easy answers are avail
able. But we believe that issues
must be pressed and questions
forced, if new answers are to be
forthcoming. For the old an
swers no longer satisfy us.

11. THE ONGOING ANGUISH
No one planned the type of
war in which we are involved.
It has slowly escalated from one
small move to the next small
move, each presumed to be the
last that would be necessary, so
that now we find our nation
able to offer only military an
swers to political and human
questions. We sympathize with
the dilemmas that face our
President and Congressmen in
dealing with a situation all de
cent men abhor. But a recogni
tion of past mistakes does not
entitle us to repeat and com
pound those mistakes by con
tinuing them on an ever-widen
ing scale.
We are unable to support our
nation's policy of military esca
lation, and we find those to
whom we minister caught as we
are in confusion and anguish be
cause of it.
1. This anguish is based first
of all on the immorality of the
warfare in Vietnam. We add our
voice to those who protest a
war in which civilian casualties
are greater than military; in
which whole populations are de
ported against their will; in
which the widespread use of
napalm and other explosives is
killing and maiming women,
children, and the aged; in which
the combatants are systemat
ically destroying the crops and
production capacity of a coun
try they profess to liberate; in
which the torturing of prisoners
by both sides has been common
place.
All who believe that man is
made in God's image must be
horrified by such crimes com
mitted against God and man.
There is guilt on all sides in
such a war as this, but the guilt
is ours far more than we have
courage to admit. We can only
tremble at the thought that God
is just.
2. Even those of us who rec
ognize that sometimes evil must
be done lest greater evil prevail,
feel a sense of anguish in the
inconsistency between our sta
ted aims and the consequences
they produce.
Our ongoing escalation, far
from bringing the war closer to
an end, serves rather to increase
its duration and intensity.
Our bombing of the north, far
from bringing our enemies to
their knees, serves rather to
strengthen their will to resist
us.
Our military presence in Viet
nam, far from stemming the
tide of communism, serves
rather to unite more firmly
those communist societies which
might otherwise develop sepa
rate destinies.
Our widening military involve

ment, far from demonstrating
to the world our firmness and
resolve, serves rather to make
the world suspicious of us and
fearful of our use of power.
Our unilateral action in Viet
nam, far from strengthening
our influence among other na
tions, serves rather to jeopar
dize new alliances we might be
creating.
At home, we find the war
threatening the very goals we
claim to be defending in Viet
nam. Programs to help mem
bers of minority groups realize
their own human dignity are
jeopardized if not destroyed. A
spurious type of patriotism is
challenging the right of dissent
and the open debate of public
issues. Financial and psychologi
cal preoccupation with the war
is destroying creative plans to
alleviate poverty, overcome dis
ease, extend education, replace
city slums and exalt human dig
nity. We grieve over lost oppor
tunities that may never be re
claimed.
Many of us are called upon to
counsel young men of draft age
who in conscience question our
presence in Vietnam. The moral
dilemma they face is part and
parcel of our own. Their an
guish is frequently motivated
by a high patriotism that forces
them to challenge, often at great
personal cost, policies they be
lieve will stain their nation's
honor. How can we counsel
them to participate in such a
war as this? When they decide
that they cannot condone the
war by their personal involve
ment, we must support them in
that decision.
3. Our anguish is deepened by
the discrepancy between what
we are told by our government
and what we discover is actual
ly taking- place.
We are told that the other
side gives no indication of de
sire to negotiate, and we then
discover that such indications
have been given, but that we
have responded either with re
buff or military escalation.
We are told that our nation is
prepared to negotiate with all
concerned, and we then discover
that certain of the combatants
will not be welcome at the con
ference table.
We are told that certain cities
have not been bombed, and we
then discover that they have
been.
We are told that civilian tar
gets have been avoided, ard we
then discover that they have not
been.
Such actions not only play
into the hands of those who dis
trust us, since they can consist
ently discount our word, but the
continuous discovery of discrep

ancles between our nation's
word and deed has already
shaken the confidence of our
own people in the word of their
government. We fear both the
immediate and long-range con
sequences for our nation of this
increasing deterioration of trust.
This, then, is our ongoing
anguish: a crisis of conscience
concerning what we do know,
and a crisis of confusion con
cerning what we do not know.
ni. THE NEED FOR
CLARIFICATION
The public debate is forcing
us to choose between wrong al
ternatives in Vietnam. Conse
quently, agreeing with the
American Roman Catholic
Bishops that it is "our duty to
magnify the moral voice of our
nation," we ask for clarification
of the real alternatives.
The choices usually presented
to the American people are
three (1) we could escalate rap
idly and "win the war" in the
forseeable future; or (2) we
could withdraw our troops and
accept defeat; but (3) since to
most Americans these alterna
tives are unsatisfactory, we
must continue our present
course, i.e., gradually escalate
the war until the other side
capitulates to our increasing
pressure.
We believe the realistic alter
natives are closer to the follow
ing: (1) we can continue to fight
a hard, bloody, increasingly bit
ter and frustrating war for
many years, a war we can con
ceivably "win," but at the price
of destroying the land and peo
ple we presume to liberate, of
sacrificing more and more of
our own young men to death,
of widening the probability that
other nations will enter the con
flict, of engendering increasing
ho s ti 1 i t y against ourselves
throughout the rest of the world,
and of emerging at the end with
no "victory" worth what it has
cost.
On the other hand, (2) we can
commit ourselves unequivocal
ly to seek now rather than later
for a negotiated peace, realizing
that history does not present us
with easy choices and that the
road to such a peace would be
long and torturous. Just as
there has been frustration and
heartache in our gradual escala
tion, so too there would be frus
tratation and heartache In the
development of new initiatives
leading to a negotiated peace.
Just as the risks of extending
the war are great, so too the
risks of seeking new initiatives
for negotiated peace are great.
But confronted by such a
choice, we believe the American
people will choose the path of

initiatives for negotiation, an
that the risks involved in sue
a choice are well worth takinc
And so we put these question
to our government:
1. Will you help our natlo
confront the choice between th
expansion of a war no one ca
"win" without destruction s
terrible as to negate its state
aim, and the immediate purs J
of a negotiated peace no one ca
"win" in the conventions
sense?
2. Will you make clear to a
that we are not trying to wi
through negotiation what w
have been unable to v
through military might, an
that we seek a peace
victory—a peace that can com
only on terms agreeable to a
at the conference table?
3. Will you make more cred
ble use than has yet been mad
of International agencies tI.J
could help us find ways to in
tiate negotiation?
IV. THE PRECONDITIONS O]
NEGOTIATION
The possibility of negotiatio
will depend in large part *
how such questions are ar
swered. Many in our nation a
ready feel that all efforts towar
a negotiated peace have bee
made by us, and that any fui
ther initiatives must come fror
the other side. But certain pr<
conditions that seem indisp
sible to negotiations are not y€
present in our policy, and wi*l
out them other nations ca
hardly be expected to take ser
ously our intent:
1. The first precondition is in
plied in our questions and- 'r
volves an assurance from ou
government that we are gei
uinely ready to negotiate, t > •
that we are not merely trying t
win diplomatically what w
have not won militarily. Ther
will be no reason for respons
from the other side unless *v
indicate a willingness to see,
peace without prior assuranc
that all details of the peace v J
follow our desires.
2. There must be some actio)
by our government to lend cred
bllity to our willingness to negc
tiate. It is increasingly ck.
that one indispensible prerequ
site is our willingness uncond
tionally to cease the bombing o
North Vietnam.
We are at an impasse v W<
have said we will not cease'. lh.
bombing until there is a slgi
from the other side of Willi £
ness to negotiate, and yet whei
such signs have come we hav
ignored them. They have s«it
they will give no further sign o
willingness to negotiate unti
we cease the bombing, and ye
when we have briefly ceased th«
bombing, no sign has come.
There is no way beyond thi
impasse until someone taker i
fresh initiative. We, as tn<
stronger nation, have both th<
obligation and the opportunlt:
to take that initiative.
The initiative must be uncor
ditional. Having ceased, we m» s
be prepared to wait until th<
other side responds. We have n»
reason to expect that a respond
will come soon, for it will tak«
time to gain credibility for ou
intent. In the interval, wtiilt
diplomatic channels are ex
plored, we will call upon
gious leaders in other countfie
to intercede and urge that
tive response be made.
3. If we truly do not intent
to dictate the terms of peace ii
advance, then we cannot eXcltidi
from the conference table anj
who are involved in the preStii
struggle. Our nation must ac
cept the National Liberate
Front as a partner in the peac<
talks in its own right. The pre
vious assurances of our leader;
have failed to state this clearly
4. Other conditions are aes'r
able, such as a de-escalation u
the ground war to a degree com
mensurate with the
necessary for those alreadj
there. But since the destiny o
all nations is involved in a nego
tiated peace, we must not seel
it unilaterally, but must ask
full cooperation of all agencie:
designed to deal with interna
tional tensions. These must *n
elude an increasing role for th<
