# State Comm To Conduct Graduate Record Exam
## 
### 
The Graduate Record Exam
ination will be given on Satur
day, February 25, at the Univer
sity of San Francisco. Applica
tion forms may be picked up at
the Stanford Counseling and
Testing Center in Room 272, En
cina. Forms must be completed
and mailed to the Educational
Testing Service, Box 1025, Berke
ley, California, before Tuesday,
February 7.
Arthur Marmaduke, Executive
Director of the State Graduate
Fellowship Program, has an
nounced two changes in this
year's administration of the
program:
• The application deadline is
moved to March 15, 1967; the
Commission will accept applica
tions postmarked prior to that
dme;
• The competition for State
Graduate Fellowships for 1967-68
is now open to all full-time grad
uate students in the academic
disciplines previously approved;
the restriction of the program to
Qrst year entering students is re
moved.

The State Graduate Fellowship
Program can be singularly im
portant to currently enrolled
graduate students who may be
experiencing financial difficulty.
The opening of the program
should offer to many graduate
schools the possibility of freeing
some of their funds for other
purposes.
The competition remains open
to college seniors who are enter
ing graduate schools; interested
students are still required to
submit Verbal and Quantitative
Sections of the Graduate Rec
ord Examination. In addition,
the Commission will accept score
reports from prior administra
tions of the GRE, either from
the National Program or from
institutional administrations up
to February 25.
Marmaduke reports one other
program change: college seniors
applying for State Graduate Fel
lowships are asked to indicate on
the application form the junior
year grade point average, not a
three year over-all grade point
average as previously requested.
