# "House Cleaning' -- It All Started With SUE
## 
### PAT McMAHON (1st Of Series) 
"The fabric of education at Stan
ford was strong and new in 1920.
Now it is old and torn . . charged
the Stanford Dally in 1951.
"Rutted roads, lower division ad
visers, and to hell with that professor
who thinks his course is the only one
you're taking. We have griped about
these things for four years and now
we are leaving Stanford still dissatis
fied."
This was the attitude of many stu
dents at Stanford before SUE began
its work in 1954. SUE was the Study
of Undergraduate Education under
taken by the Executive Committee of
the Academic Council, and its con
clusions changed admissions policy,

the general studies program, ad
vanced placement credit, and the
freshman year.
Complete Overhaul
SUE, forerunner of the Packer
Committee, undertook a complete re
evaluation and overhaul of the cur
riculum. Its aim was "to formulate
a program, properly administered and
imaginatively taught, that can excite
intellectually the largest number of
students; and to give reasonable cov
erage to the fields of knowledge with
out dulling intellectual interest . . .
or limiting the highly gifted."
The result was a new general stu
dies program at Stanford.
Features of the report include
many program innovations which
would setm hardly new to the Stan

ford student today. Highlights were:
Entering students could receive up
to fifteen units for college-level
courses taken in high school. Ad
vanced placement now can total 45
units.
English Requirement
Requirement of a full year of fresh
man English, to include both compo
sition and literature. Remedial En
glish was eliminated. Today, students
with advanced placement in English
are admitted to Special English 1 and
2 and are exempt from English 3.
Students were automatically freed
from required general studies courses
in their major fieldsâ€”natural sci
ences, social sciences, or humanities.
Social Science departments were
asked to develop "terminal courses"

designed to familiarize students with
the subject but not to prepare them
for further study in the area. These
are the Social Science numbered 1
courses today.
Activity credits were established.
Additional language, math, or logic
was required of an A.B. candidate.
Science Units Up
The science requirement was raised
from 15 to 17 units. Senior colloquia
that were to be outside a student's
major subject were established to dis
cuss current problems in the area of
study. Today only one senior colloq
uia is required.
Freshmen were allowed to declare a
major subject, and juniors were re
quired to select one.
Each student was to have "absolute

freedom" in changing advisors or
fields of study to avoid "actual or
imagined psychological barriers" to
his choice.
The General Studies Committee
was established to provide continu
ous review of the effectiveness of the
program.
In addition to the curriculum re
view, the committee recommended
that requirements for admissions be
raised to include three years of En
glish rather than two and to employ
College Board Achievement Test
scores. The former of these sugges
tions is currently a requirement.
President Sterling called the report
"the most thoroughgoing revision of
Stanford's undergraduate curriculum
in 35 years." Actually, it was the first

major report on Stanford curriculum.
Composed of 31 faculty members,
Provost Terman, and President Ster
ling, the Executive Committee of the
Academic Council in making its rec
ommendations had focused on Ave
areas: 1) admissions, 2) the quality
of undergraduate teaching, 3) the lec
ture system and the organization of
formal instruction, 4) undergraduate
intellectual motivation, and 5) the
new curriculum.
The committee directed by Pro
fessor Robert Hoopes and Hubert
Marshall included Professors Robert
A. Walker, Leonard I. Schiff, Fried
rich Strothmann, Kenneth J. Arrow,
Robert R. Sears, and Ernest R. Hil
gard.
