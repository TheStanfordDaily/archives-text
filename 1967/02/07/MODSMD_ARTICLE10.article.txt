# CORNELL UNIVERSITY
## Banned Magazine Reinstated 
### BOB DAVIS 
A New York State Supreme Court
judge has lifted an injunction against
the Cornell University literary maga
zine, the Trojan Horse.
The action climaxed a series of bi
zarre events which began when a
campus police official seized 130 copies
of the publication which contained a
controversial article.
James Herson, head of the "Safety
Division"-of the Cornell campus police
force, made the decision to confiscate
the Trojan Horse on January 19.
Herson labeled a journal written by
an Ithaca resident and nonstudent as
obscene. The local printer of the Horse
had refused to set the journal and
it was mimeographed and stapled in
the magazine.
All top University officials were out
of town attending a trustee meeting
at the time of the unprecedented ac
tion. But the acting president of the
University announced that the editors
of the magazine had been ordered to
halt distribution.
The editorial staff of the Trojan
Horse voted almost at once to defy the
ban. They organized a rally for the
next day in front of the student union.
Some 1500 persons attended.
The district attorney of Tomkins
County, in which Ithaca is located,

appeared at the scene of the rally.
He attempted to arrest five students
who were selling the magazine and
take them to his car.
A number of people attending the
rally tried to block his path. The dis
trict attorney, Richard Thaler, spoke
to the crowd from the top of an
automobile amid considerable con
fusion and noise. He warned strongly
against the sale of the magazine.
Later in the afternoon Thaler got a
temporary injunction against the sale
of the Horse from a Supreme Court
justice in Ithaca. The injunction listed
the names of the 14 staff members of
the publication.
Meanwhile, students were circulat
ing a list to be signed by everyone
who sold the magazine, so that they
would all be prosecuted.
The student-run Activities Review
Board of the University met that night
and voted 8 to 0 to permit sale of the
Horse.
On Saturday, January 21, another
rally was held in front of the union.
No police or county officials appeared,
but the vice president of the Univer
sity returned from the trustee meet
ing to help deal with the crisis. He
told the students that he recognized
the legal right of the district attorney

to confiscate the Horse. But he ob
jected to the act on grounds of pro
priety.
The injunction, however, remained
in effect.
On January 27 Judge Harold E.
Simpson ruled that the controversial
article in the magazine met the U.S.
Supreme Court's test against pruriency
and the publication was entitled to the
protection of the First Amendment
and could not be banned.
Judge Simpson prefaced his final
decision by saying the publication con
tained much that was "vile and evil."
He described the one article as filled
with "garbage and trash without any
semblance of literary merit."
But he refered to the dictionary defi
nition of prurient as "itching."
The Supreme Court in New York
is a lower judiciary body than the
state Court of Appeals.
The magazine may now be sold on
campus, but editor James Moody in
dicated that the magazine would not
be reprinted.
James Herson, the man who initiated
the action against the Trojan Horse
has recently resigned his post. He re
marked that in his position in the
Cornell Safety Division, he can no
longer be effective.
