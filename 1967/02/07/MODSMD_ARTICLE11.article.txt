# Philly Philharmonic Scheduled To Perform
## 
### 
Stanford radio station KZSU
will present the Philadelphia Or
chestra under the direction of
Eugene Ormandy on Sunday,
May 28 at 4:30 p.m., in Frost
Memorial Amphitheatre.
Ormandy has been conductor
of the orchestra for thirty-one
years. According to John Simion,
station announcer for KZSU, the
Philadelphia Orchestra is now
considered one of the two lead
ing orchestras in the country,
largely due to Ormandy's direc
tion, The New York Philhar
monic Orchestra, until recently
under the direction of Leonard
Bernstein, is considered the na
tion's other leading orchestra.
After stopping at Stanford for
their final stop of a five-concert
West Coast tour, Ormandy and

the Philadelphia Orchestra will
leave the states for a tour of Ja
pan. Since Ormandy is retiring
from his distinguished career at
the end of this concert season,
his Stanford appearance will be
his last on the West Coast.
Tickets may be obtained by
sending a self-addressed stamped
envelope to the Committee on
Public Exercises, Stanford Uni
versity. Reserved seats are $5.50
for students and non-students.
Other seats are $4.00 and $3.00
for non-students and $3.00 and
$2.00 for students.
Simion estimated that the or
chestra will be approximately
one hundred pieces. It varies in
size normally between ninety
five and one hundred ten pieces.
