# NATIONAL CHAMPIONS IN 1971?

The 1967 Stanford Varsity
tennis team shows improvement
over last year's team, even
though half of its top six play
ers are sophomores. The youth
on the team points to a very
hopeful future, as does the pres
ence this year of three outstand
ing Frosh players.
The strength of the team lies
in the overall balance of its ten
members. As Coach Gould put

it: "Brian Leek is a fine player,
but not a potential Davis Cup
per." Leek is a two-time letter
winner, who stands at the top of
the tennis ladder at Stanford.
Southlanders
Much of the team hails from
Southern California, and those
players from there were gen
erally ranked high in the Jun
iors a few years ago. Craig
Braise (4), Jamie Carroll (6),
and Rick Reed (7), were ranked
Bth, 7th, and 12th.
The team has been working
hard to develop top condition,
which it will need with the
schedule that faces them. Of the
teams which finished in the top
ten in the nation one of the last
two years, Stanford faces seven
of these teams. Also, on the list
are three All-Star matches
against local men's squads.
Number 2 man Dean Schlo

bohm is only a sophomore, but
has already beaten several top
Northern California players. He
also had an impressive match
Saturday against the Olympic
Club. He was pitted against Tom
Brown, who was a Wimbledon
Finalist and an ex-Davis Cup
per. Scholobohm lost in consecu
tive sets, but made Brown work
way ovvertime before the former
lost 10-12, 5-7.
Alloo Improving
Chuck Alloo, who was rated 12

in the Nation's Junior, joined
his brother in 1966 to reach the
semi-finals in the Juniors Dou
bles. Alloo a sophomore had a
win Saturday over a tough Cliff
Vickery.
Dale Wong who holds down the
sth spot is the most improving
player on the team. Another
sophomore, he was the number 2
junior in the Northwest. Jamie
Carroll, who lettered last year, is
an exceptional doubles player.
Four men stand ready to move

up the ladder at any opportunity
or to play when asked. Rick
Reed is a junior letterman, who
won against the Olympic Club in
singles. John McCabe is a sen
ior letter-winner, who was the
No. 1 Texas Junior and Number
5 in the Men's. A tremendous
competitor, he played in the Na
tional Intercollegiate. Charlie
Herlands and Brad Cornell are
devoted netmen who are both
very good doubles players.
Building To The Top
This year's team is a better
dual match than tournament
team because of the lack of an
outstanding player. The good
balance though will be the de
termining factor in many of the
matches this year.
Three Freshmen players—Rob
Rippner, John Spiegel, and Rod
Kahn—will bring again next year
tremendously talented youth.
Next year's contingent will have
only two seniors. Coach Gould
sees these young players as his
foundation to a National Cham
pionship.
This championship is the
goal of this .year's team and
the entire tennis program. Gould
realizes that this year's squad

has little chance of finishing
number 1, but in four years he
feels that this goal will be a
realistic target.
The next match, after Satur
day's impressive defeat of the
Olpmpic Club, will be this Thurs
day against San Fernando State.
This will be a mild match, com
pared to what is coming up
against No. 1 ranked USC and
strong UCLA. Pair-ups versus

Peninsula All-Stars, Northern
California All-Stars, and the Jun
iro Veteran All-Stars will also
test the skill and stamina of the
team.
The victory against the Olym
pic Club was a rare triumph for
Stanford, who has beaten the
Club only sporadically in the last
twenty years. The Indians picked
up five of the singles and one
of the doubles to win, 6-3.


Rick Reed, junior returning letterman, was ranked
12th in the Southern California Juniors. He con
tributed a singles victory against the Olympic
Club Saturday. It was Stanford's first match of the
season and an impressive 6-3 upset
