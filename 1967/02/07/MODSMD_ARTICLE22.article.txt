# Same New Look

### 
-■ The Row's annual attempt at creativity is
Jjnder way again—Greek Week. But the fra
ternities promise the ceremonies will be differ
ent this year, for they anxiously point out that
they have established new goals for the week.
Representatives from all the houses agreed
fast October that fraternities need to find a
jXiew voice" in order to strengthen their posi
tion on campus. Accordingly, the Greek Week
$hairman has indicated his intention to change
the week from solely a period of "fraternity
oriented fun and games" to a period "relevant
to the entire University community and during
Which genuine service can be performed."
Yesterday's fiasco on White Memorial Plaza
was no indication that anything has changed; it
will take an imagination more fertile that ours to
discover the chariot races' relevance to the Uni
versity community. The House Queen luncheon,
the Queen's Games, and the sporadically inter
spersed chugging contests do not provide much
hope that the rest of the week will fulfill this
goal, either.
Wednesday's tree-planting will highlight
Greek Week's efforts at public service. Twelve
hundred fraternity men are asked to help
plant a half-dozen trees around the Under
graduate Library. The University will dig the
holes for the trees and will raise them to a
vertical position, while a landscape architect

supervises the fraternity men as they guide the
trees into the holes. The Greeks will then water
and fertilize the six trees. A previous "service"
plan had called for the boathouse to be re
painted, but was abandoned when it was found
that the task might take more than one day.
The Interfraternity Council (IFC) has appro
priated almost $5000 of its $6000 annual budget
to finance Greek Week; 80 per cent of the Greek
Week allocation will be spent on social activi
ties, mostly the IFC ball. Whatever happened to
the IFC President's promise that social and edu
cational functions would receive approximately
an equal share of the budget? What happened
to the guest-in-residence program planned for
Greek Week?
That the fraternities are making an effort
toward establishing a "new look" is commend
able; the progress they have made in achieving
this goal, however, has been disappointing. One
evening of a high school Career Day program
and a GPA contest will never make Greek Week
relevant, nor will planting six trees once a year
convince anyone of the fraternities' interest in
the community. Fraternities today are being
asked to justify their relevance and it is only
after they take the bold step of rejecting their
anachronistic traditions that they can hope to
establish themselves as legitimate parts of a
University.

goal, either.
Wednesday's tree-planting will highlight
Greek Week's efforts at public service. Twelve
hundred fraternity men are asked to help
plant a half-dozen trees around the Under
graduate Library. The University will dig the
holes for the trees and will raise them to a
vertical position, while a landscape architect

supervises the fraternity men as they guide the
trees into the holes. The Greeks will then water
and fertilize the six trees. A previous "service"
plan had called for the boathouse to be re
painted, but was abandoned when it was found
that the task might take more than one day.
The Interfraternity Council (IFC) has appro
priated almost $5000 of its $6000 annual budget
to finance Greek Week; 80 per cent of the Greek
Week allocation will be spent on social activi
ties, mostly the IFC ball. Whatever happened to
the IFC President's promise that social and edu
cational functions would receive approximately
an equal share of the budget? What happened
to the guest-in-residence program planned for
Greek Week?
That the fraternities are making an effort
toward establishing a "new look" is commend
able; the progress they have made in achieving
this goal, however, has been disappointing. One
evening of a high school Career Day program
and a GPA contest will never make Greek Week
relevant, nor will planting six trees once a year
convince anyone of the fraternities' interest in
the community. Fraternities today are being
asked to justify their relevance and it is only
after they take the bold step of rejecting their
anachronistic traditions that they can hope to
establish themselves as legitimate parts of a
University.
-■ The Row's annual attempt at creativity is
Jjnder way again—Greek Week. But the fra
ternities promise the ceremonies will be differ
ent this year, for they anxiously point out that
they have established new goals for the week.
Representatives from all the houses agreed
fast October that fraternities need to find a
jXiew voice" in order to strengthen their posi
tion on campus. Accordingly, the Greek Week
$hairman has indicated his intention to change
the week from solely a period of "fraternity
oriented fun and games" to a period "relevant
to the entire University community and during
Which genuine service can be performed."
Yesterday's fiasco on White Memorial Plaza
was no indication that anything has changed; it
will take an imagination more fertile that ours to
discover the chariot races' relevance to the Uni
versity community. The House Queen luncheon,
the Queen's Games, and the sporadically inter
spersed chugging contests do not provide much
hope that the rest of the week will fulfill this
goal, either.
