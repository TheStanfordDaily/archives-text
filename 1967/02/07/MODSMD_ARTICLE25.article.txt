## Faculty Call For Dow Boycott 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Friday's Daily contained a
Dow Chemical recruiting ad. We
urge that Stanford students re
spond to Dow's recruiting drive
by refusing to work for the sup
plier of polystyrene—the thick
ener of the new, "improved" na
palm B. We ask that those who
might have been interested in
the company write Dow and tell
the recruiter why they will not
work for Dow.
Anyone who still thinks that

napalm is a tolerable war wea
pon—regardless of his view of
the tolerability of the Vietnam
war—is urged to see Dr. R. E.
Perry's article in the January
Redbook, Martha Gelhorn's ar
ticle in the January Ladies'
Home Journal, and William Pep
per's articles in the fall Colum
bia Forum and the January
Ramparts. These articles give
further evidence that napalm is
primarily useful in areas where
population is dense, and that
civilian casualities from napalm
far outnumber military ones. In
Vietnam, at least 50 per cent of
the population is under sixteen.
The older, now obsolete, type
of napalm left "much to be de
sired, particularly in adhesion"
(Chemical and Engineering
News). Those who have seen pic
tures of napalm-charred children
know that an increase in ad
hesion means an increase in
the searing of human flesh —
which the new product clings to
admirably, thanks to Dow Chem
ical.
A boycott of Dow's Saran-
Wrap, Handi-Wrap, and Bath
room Cleaner has been in effect
for some time. Housewives who
have written to Dow stating
their reasons for boycotting have
received form letters saying that
Dow is proud to do anything
their government asks, and that
they are also glad to help hasten
the day peace will be brought to
the world.
In view of the Nuremberg
principle, Dow's policy makes
particiption in their organization
repugnant.

* Death Trap?
Editor, The Dally:
While cruising down Lomita
at 15 mph it ocurred to me that
in the very likely event of a
stray student wandering onto a
crossing the chances were high
that I'd go straight into him . . .
on slowing down to 5 mph it
became apparent that not only
were the crossings still a death
trap but at this pace I myself
was now a hazard to other
traffic.
Please, Administration, before
I kill someone, please illuminate
these crossings ... it is totally
impossible to see an elephant on
them let alone an unsuspecting
freshman ... is a flashing light
of some kind of warning not pos
sible? I suggest a team of stu
dents waving white handker
chiefs if all else fails . . . hurry,
before squashed sophomore is
served at Tresidder—probably a
great improvement. . . .
