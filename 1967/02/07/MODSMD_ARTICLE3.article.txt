# Bathtub Babe, Pig-Toting Gnome Rush Through Plaza In Frat Race
## 
### STEVE GRUBER Gladhand Editor 
The fraternity boys turned back the
clock to ancient Greece yesterday.
Chariot races through the middle of
White Plaza highlighted the start of
Greek Week. The chariots were ac
tually contraptions made of junk and
old bicycle wheels. The charioteers
were actually Stanford women in
Greek trappings.
And the slaves were really fratern
ity boys. They were also fast. Most
of the entries covered the 100-yard
course in about 11 seconds, but the
winner, Kappa Alpha, ran one heat in
10.8 seconds.
Hunchback Of ATO
Not all of the entries were con
cerned with the speed with which they
covered the course. Alpha Tau Omi
cron featured a hunchback pushing a
gnome with a painted face—this was
part of the humorous category. The
gnome carried a pig, who was not a
Stanford student, but who did attract
the attention of several of the dogs
watching the race.
The humorous entry from Phi Kap
pa Sigma chose a more realistic rep
resentation. Eight Phi Kaps sat on a
wagon, playing cards and drinking
beers, while a maiden pulled them
through the course.
Each fraternity was supposed to
pull a girl on the chariot in accordance
with the rules. However ,the rules did
not say what type of girl—one fra
ternity borrowed a faculty member's
daughter for the event. She weighed
only fifty pounds, but they still lost.
Bubbles Galore
White Plaza has been the scene of
many left-wing pow wows, but yes
terday was probably the first time
that a girl in a bathtub was the cen
ter of attention. She was surrounded
by suds, but not clothes, and whether
she really had anything on was left
to the fertile imaginations of the spec
tators.
The race was marred by only one
mechanical failure. With 25 yards left
to go, the wheels on the Zeta Psi char
iot locked and bent inward at an

awkward angle. The going suddenly
got much tougher for the Zetes, but
they finished the race anyway.
"We could have won, too," one of
the chariot pullers complained to the
maiden in the driver's seat.
There were only three Phi Delt
sweat shirts seen at the event. The
Phi Delts, who were suspended from
campus until next September, made
no attempt to enter a chariot.
The crowd's response never seemed
to hit a frenzied high, but perhaps it
had no previous chariot-race-watching
experience. Approximately 800 peo
ple watched the fracas, but the crowd
got smaller as the races went longer.

Loud stomach growls could be heard
from some of the spectators who stuck
out the full 50 minutes of racing.
The final race of the day, between
Kappa Alpha and Alpha Sigma Phi,
was late in starting. The official start
er ordered the participants to their
marks, then said "Get set," only to
find that his starter's pistol wouldn't
work. The tension built.
The starter tried again. "To your
marks, get set," he said. Then a soft
click was heard. The pistol had failed
again. He put it away and took out
his trusty whistle, sending the make
believe Greeks on their road to glory.

The starter tried again. "To your
marks, get set," he said. Then a soft
click was heard. The pistol had failed
again. He put it away and took out
his trusty whistle, sending the make
believe Greeks on their road to glory.
The fraternity boys turned back the
clock to ancient Greece yesterday.
Chariot races through the middle of
White Plaza highlighted the start of
Greek Week. The chariots were ac
tually contraptions made of junk and
old bicycle wheels. The charioteers
were actually Stanford women in
Greek trappings.
And the slaves were really fratern
ity boys. They were also fast. Most
of the entries covered the 100-yard
course in about 11 seconds, but the
winner, Kappa Alpha, ran one heat in
10.8 seconds.
Hunchback Of ATO
Not all of the entries were con
cerned with the speed with which they
covered the course. Alpha Tau Omi
cron featured a hunchback pushing a
gnome with a painted face—this was
part of the humorous category. The
gnome carried a pig, who was not a
Stanford student, but who did attract
the attention of several of the dogs
watching the race.
The humorous entry from Phi Kap
pa Sigma chose a more realistic rep
resentation. Eight Phi Kaps sat on a
wagon, playing cards and drinking
beers, while a maiden pulled them
through the course.
Each fraternity was supposed to
pull a girl on the chariot in accordance
with the rules. However ,the rules did
not say what type of girl—one fra
ternity borrowed a faculty member's
daughter for the event. She weighed
only fifty pounds, but they still lost.
Bubbles Galore
White Plaza has been the scene of
many left-wing pow wows, but yes
terday was probably the first time
that a girl in a bathtub was the cen
ter of attention. She was surrounded
by suds, but not clothes, and whether
she really had anything on was left
to the fertile imaginations of the spec
tators.
The race was marred by only one
mechanical failure. With 25 yards left
to go, the wheels on the Zeta Psi char
iot locked and bent inward at an

awkward angle. The going suddenly
got much tougher for the Zetes, but
they finished the race anyway.
"We could have won, too," one of
the chariot pullers complained to the
maiden in the driver's seat.
There were only three Phi Delt
sweat shirts seen at the event. The
Phi Delts, who were suspended from
campus until next September, made
no attempt to enter a chariot.
The crowd's response never seemed
to hit a frenzied high, but perhaps it
had no previous chariot-race-watching
experience. Approximately 800 peo
ple watched the fracas, but the crowd
got smaller as the races went longer.

Loud stomach growls could be heard
from some of the spectators who stuck
out the full 50 minutes of racing.
The final race of the day, between
Kappa Alpha and Alpha Sigma Phi,
was late in starting. The official start
er ordered the participants to their
marks, then said "Get set," only to
find that his starter's pistol wouldn't
work. The tension built.
