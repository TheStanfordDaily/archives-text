# ATO Balks At New Rush Schedule
## 
### 
Representatives of the Intra Fra
ternity Council (IFC) will meet at the
Alpha Delta Phi house tonight to dis
cuss possible changes in the rush pro
gram set up last week.
Discontent with the original sched
ule was expressed by the members of
Alpha Tau Omicron fraternity.
According to Drennen Jones, presi
dent of IFC, there was a communica
tions breakdown between the fraterni
ties and the Ad Hoc Committee on
Rush, and some of the issues were not
resolved.
At an informal meeting Sunday two
alternate rush proposals were de
vised; they were presented last night
at house individual meetings. The
ATO's have agreed to support either
of the revised programs.
The original proposal provided that

open house would begin Tuesday,
April 4; parties and the beginning
of bidding would be held Friday and
Saturday that week; open house the
following Monday and Tuesday; and
bid card signing would begin Mon
day, April 17.
In a second proposal, another open
house would be added on Thursday
of the first week, in place of the sec
ond Tuesday open house. The third
program would be identical to the
second, but would include an informal
open aftprnoon on Wednesday, April 5.
