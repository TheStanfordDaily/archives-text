# Students Across Country Express Draft Discontent
## 
### BEVERLY CORY 
Student leaders representing 15 na
tional organizations have condemned
the military draft in favor of volun
tary service.
In a two-day conference held in
Washington, the students issued a
resolution declaring that conscription
is incompatible with individual free
dom.
Their position is paralleled at Stan
ford by the activities of the Anti-
Draft Union, which has been circulat
ing a petition opposing military in
duction. The petition attacks the draft
as "a coercive and intimidating way"
used by the government to effect
policies contrary to the public in
terest.
Political leanings were apparently
insignificant in the national stand,
since signers of the resolution en
compassed the leftist Students for a
Democratic Society, right-wing Young
Americans for Freedom, and the mod
erate student division of the National
Association for the Advancement of
Colored People.
All Opposition
The Stanford Anti-Draft Union,
although connected with the SDS,
also seeks to rise above political
biases and coordinate all degrees of
opposition to the draft. Included with
its petitions are well-defined alterna
tive positions suggesting that one re
fuse to cooperate with the Selective
Service, refuse to serve in the mili
tary, or refuse to fight in Vietnam.
Gary Coutin, secretary of the Un
ion, described it as a forum, or a
meeting ground for all opposing the
draft. One faction is advocating group
non-cooperation with the Selective
Service—even to the extent of going
to jail—to attract publicity to their
stand.
Stanford Young Republicans also
stand opposed to the draft. At a con
vention of the California Young Re
publicans in Sacramento last week
end, Stanford delegate John Lucas in
troduced an amendment challenging
conscription policy.
Dtminuation Of Liberty
It described the function of the mili
tary as "the defense of individual
freedom and property," and as it
stands, the Selective Service system
contradicts this by a "diminuation of
individual liberty."

The amendment recommended in
stead of the draft, "fully professional
armed services staffed with well-paid
career personnel." According to Stan
ford Young Republican Mike Kuhl,
the amendment was adopted as part
of the 1967 California YR Platform.
The national resolution passed by
the students in Washington presented
no specific alternatives to the draft
because a unanimous consensus could
not be reached. It did recognize that
"an urgent need exists for young
people to become involved in the elim
ination of such social ills as ignor
ance, poverty, racial discrimination
and war."
One Alternative
However, a separate resolution was
signed by 9 of the 15 student leaders
presenting one alternative to the
draft. It urged the use of voluntary
armed forces only, and called for the
creation of a program of voluntary
service in humatarian work, such as
the Peace Corps.
A National Students Association
poll revealed dissatisfaction with the

Selective Service system is echoed on
campuses throughout the country.
Sixty-eight percent of 30,500 students
were not content with the current
method, and about 75 percent looked
for peaceful alternatives to military
service, including VISTA and the
Teacher Corps.
Opposition to the draft by students
representing the political extremes
was based on varying reasons. Greg
ory Calvert of the SDS urged its
abolition because was a "tool of an
imperialistic and aggressive" U.S. for
eign policy.
Rightist David Franke of the
Young Americans for Freedom ob
jected to forced service on the
grounds that it restricted individual
liberty and is "one of the most totali
tarian measures on the books."
Franke, however, indicated approval
of American committments in Viet
nam.
Still, 90 percent felt military con
scription is justifiable, although ony
68 percent thought it was necessary
at times other than a national emerg
ency.
