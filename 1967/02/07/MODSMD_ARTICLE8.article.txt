# Civ Review To Study Course With Faculty, Student Survey
## 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
Concerned with faculty and student
reactions of the program, Western Civ
coordinators have instituted a general
evaluation of present policies.
Letters to 25 administrators and
faculty members have already been
sent out, according to Paul S. Seaver,
assistant professor of history and di
rector of the Western Civ program.
"Our present plans include a survey
of all present freshmen and a selected
group of upperclassmen if we can get
the funds," Seaver commented.
Packer Committee
Although the results may eventually
be considered by the Packer Commit
tee on Education, the study is being
conducted by the department "solely
as an internal project."
Administrators and faculty mem
bers were asked their opinions of the
purposes of Western Civ and present

course problems. The results are ex
pected within two weeks.
Seaver said that the student survey
will have a different emphasis. "We
are interested in details," he stated. "A
student questionnaire would concen
trate on the usefulness of present ma
terials â€” texts, discussions, and lec
tures."
Action will be taken only after the
faculty letters, student questionnaires,
and Western Civ staff opinions are all
evaluated. Areas for consideration in
clude pass-fail or all-deferred grading,
class size, and the current lecture-dis
cussion balance.
Whether the course is too historical
or too much a "Great Books" course
will also be discussed. "We are inter
ested in just what the course should
be," Seaver commented.
"There have been quite a few sug
gestions from within the department
for possible reforms." But before ini
tiating any changes, "a complete study
of university opinions is necessary,"
he added.
Budget
Budget limitations may curtail
plans for the survey of upperclass
men, since mailing costs are prohibi
tive with available funds.
Besides pass-fail grading, several
other innovations have been suggested.
Other proposals include abolition of
the course entirely, extension of the
program to two years, a science-ori
ented alternative class, and the inte
gration of Civ and Freshman English
curricula.
