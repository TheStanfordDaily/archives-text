# Board Of Trustees Sets Evaluation
## 
### 
The Board of Trustees has initiated
a self-evaluation study, to be con
cerned primarily with structure, func
tion and goals of the board.
According to Richard E. Guggen
hime, president of the Board, the study
is only in preliminary stages and
"there will be no results to report for
several months."
Guggenhime explained that the
study was not motivated by any ex
ternal pressures, but will be like other
similar studies which are conducted
every few years in order to aid the
Board in functioning and will cover a
broad range of topics.
Trustee Robert Minge Brown will
direct the re-evaluation study.
