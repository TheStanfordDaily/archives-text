# Students To Attack Union City Poverty
## 
### 
A group of Stanford students
plan to work during Spring
break In two poverty areas of
the East Bay communities of
Hayward and Union City.
The two work projects, spon
sored by Junipero house of Wil
bur, are open to all interested
students. At an organization
meeting held last week, some
forty students discussed the im
mediate goals of each project.
In the Union City project, stu
dents will tutor Mexican-Ameri
cans who have difficulty with
written English. These people
need to learn, for example, how
a loan application is filled out
or how a written driver's test is
taken. In addition to the tutor
ing work, Stanford students will
participate in a week-end fiesta.
The Hayward project workers
will cooperate with a local com
munity organization formed
with the help of the Office of
Economic Opportunity. They
plan to clean alleys, build
fences, and develop community
political consciousness. Accord
ing to Neal Yoder, one of the
project leaders, many of the

Hayward area residents face
eviction from their homes be
cause of new freeway construc
tion.
Both the Hayward and Union
City work projects have room
for more people. Anyone inter
ested in participating in either
project should contact either
Neal Yoder (326-9562) or Don
Brenneis (326-5953).
