# Film-Maker Brakhage Offers 'Collage Of Visual Memories'
## 
### 
Experimental film-maker Stan
Brakhage will lecture and show
selections from his latest work,
the Song cycle, tonight at 8:30
p.m. at the Experiment building.
Brakhage is well known in
film circles her and abroad for
his films which deal with a
great variety of subjects rang
ing from war, to love and fire.
In all his films he is very con
cerned with the intricate
rhythms of film editing.
Featured tonight will be the
23rd Psalm Branch. This is an
hour-long epic on war as experi
enced by memory. Brakhage is
concerned with the precise
rhytms of memory and at
tempts in this film, to translate
these rhythms into visual terms.

Poet Michael McClure says of
Brakhage's latest work, "Stan
Brakhage's 23rd Psalm Branch
is the most perfect anti-war film
and it is right that the film ad
vances from the napalm and
hydrogen of 35 mm to speak
in the husky whisper of 8 mm.
The footage is a tortured and
beauteous nervous system . . .
23rd Psalm Branch is the ma
gician standing at the table wav
ing his wand, as on the tarrot
card, but the agony that follows
meditation on carnage ... as he
frees eternity again and guilt
lessly."
Allen Ginsburg summed up
the film by saying, "Here we
have intensified a collage of vis
ual memories—film maker lost

in recollective thoughts — of
newsreels from Hitler's and
Mussolini's crowds shaping
themselves like protoplasmic
bloops of Apocalypses — static
and scratches of Brakhage's
Closed-eye visual grid super
imposed on mighty image tanks
and tortures of WW 11. All mod
ern phenomena are crazy and
transient as proved by thi9
movie."
Besides the showing of the
23rd Psalm Branch and general
lecture of all his works, Brak
hage will freely entertain all
queries. This program is part
of the Experiment's series for
independent film-makers and a
one dollar admission will bt
charged.
