# Cal Young Republicans Move Left Of Far Right
## 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
The California Young Repub
licans began what many observ
ers felt would be a typical, for
the CRY's, three day convention
in the Hotel El Dorado in Sacra
mento last Friday. Delegates
were greeted by posters calling
on them to "do your bit for
Rhodesia and buy bonds".
There was talk of adopting
a resolution pledging to find a
conservative candidate to un
seat U.S. Senator Thomas
Kuchel for his "betrayal" of the
Republican party. And among
the state officers, there were
three members of the John
Birch Society.
The convention represented in
many ways the firm control
which the Southern California
conservatives have maintained
over the CRY's during the past
five years.
S.U. YR's Buck Trend
The Stanford YR's have long
been critical of the control of
the state organization by what
one delegate called the "kook
element". However, it wasn't
until this year that the club,
the largest in the state, felt
they were able to reverse the
trend.
"As part of the San Mateo
County delegation, our dele
gates played key roles in the
resolution and platform com
mittees," said Stanford YR
president Bob Walker.
"The platform still has some
parts I don't completely agree
with, but it is far better than
past platforms."
In-Fighting'
The ugly political in-fighting
which has been a part of past
conventions went on for two
days in the credentials commit
tee. The past three Los Angeles
County chairmen and the presi
dent of the UCLA chapter be
came embroiled in a fight at
tempting to fix the blame for
LAYR's failure to have dues in
by the January 10 deadline.
When the general session met
late Saturday night, the full
complement of 37 Los Angeles
delegates was seated.
Moderates Form Resolutions
During the time the creden
tials fight was waging on, Stan
ford delegates, and other moder
ate delegates from throughout
the state concentrated their ef
forts in the platform and reso
lutions committees.
Stanford delegate John Lucas
introduced an amendment offer
ing as an alternative to con
scription "a fully professional
armed services staffed with
well-paid career personnel."
Education Support
Lucas also introduced an
amendment calling for "public
support of education up to the
secondary level." In regards to
tuition at the University of Cali
fornia, the platform called for a
"system of revolving loans and
solicited scholarships."
In resolutions committee,
Walker led the fight to prevent
adoption of the resolution sup
ported by state president Mike
Djordjevich condemning Ku
chel. Walker added, "We had
several resolutions of our own
which I would have liked to see
adopted. These were resolutions
taking stands on lowering the
drinking age to eighteen and
air pollution."
Opposition To College Proposals
More than one of the South
ern California delegates found
the positions taken by Stanford,
along with other college delega
tions intolerable. Typical of the
reaction, was one delegate
who yelled in the hall after one
committee meeting: "These
damn College Federation stu

dents shouldn't be allowed to be
on the committees. They are the
ones who are subverting the
whole convention."
Others were not so quick to
condemn. One of the Asembly
men attending the Convention
pointed out, "The CYR's should
be training our future politici
ans, and I don't think they cur
rently are."
