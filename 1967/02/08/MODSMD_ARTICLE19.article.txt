# Bernstein On Truman: 'A Reluctant Liberal'
## 
### 
Assistant Professor of History
Barton Bernstein described Presi
dent Truman as a "cautious and
reluctant liberal in the struggle"
for civil rights, in a paper re
cently delivered before the Amer
ican Historical Association.
Bernstein felt that Truman did
"far less than he could and much
less than he had asked of Con
gress" and so "his achievements
fell far short of liberal aims and
hopes."
However, said Bernstein, he
kindled hope by focusing atten
tion on the moral dimensions of
the dilemma. Truman asked Con
gress in 1948 for a civil rights
program that included the Fair
Employment Practices Commis
sion and measures against lynch
ing and the poll tax.
Bernstein added that Truman's
"efforts to desegregate the

armed forces, and the participa
tion of his Department of Justice
in cases against restrictive cove
nants and segregation in educa
tion, placed the administration
firmly in the struggle for equal
ity and sporadically against the
separate-but-equal doctrine."
Truman also gave orders for
ending discrimination in federal
employment.
Throughout his term, "Truman
moved cautiously and only en
dorsed measures affirming legal
equality and protecting Negroes
from violence," reported Bern
stein.
From Truman's efforts Bern
stein felt that "the injustices he
revealed, the evils he and his
generation failed to correct,
will soon demand new efforts
and a new vision."
