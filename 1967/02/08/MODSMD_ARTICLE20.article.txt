# SLAC Research Tests Elastic Scattering Effect
## 
### CATHERINE BURKE 
The world's most expensive
scientific instrument, the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator, is now
working full time, and, having
slightly exceeded its potential of
20 billion electrons volts (BEV's),
the accelerator is handling a
wide variety of experiments pro
gramed by many researchers.
The accelerator propels elec
trons along a two mile course
terminated by target buildings
which are specially designed to
gather and analyze data on the
interactions between the elec
tron beam and its target nuclei.
Upon completion of four years
of construction the beam began
operating on May 21, 1966. It
was scheduled for a one year
shake-down series before official
operation was to begin. How
ever, the instrument performed
beyond expectations and has
accelerated its own time table by
six months.
Proposal Needed
In order to perform an experi
ment using the accelerator a pro
posal must be submitted to a
committee of eight scientists,
chaired by Dr. Sands, assistant
director of SLAC. Four members
of the committee are from Stan
ford and four represent other
areas.
Programming and scheduling
suggestions are given to Dr.
Wolfgang Panofsky. As director
of the center, Dr. Panofsky has
the final responsibility of decid
ing who may use the machine
and for what purpose it may be
used. It is estimated that one
dozen projects per year can be
performed with the accelerator.
Dr. Panofsky is also a mem
ber of the seven research teams
active at the center. His team
specializes in electron scattering
analysis. One project concerning
the team is "elastic scattering."
When a high energy electron

passes very close to a target
nucleus, an electromagnetic in
teraction between the nucleus
and the electron will cause the
electron to veer off its path in
one direction while the nucleus
responds in a different direction.
The scatter pattern of elec
trons is measured precisely with
on-line computer equipment in
order to achieve a clear picture
of the nucleus that has caused
the scattering. A major field
of interest is concerned with
the created particles which are
driven from the nucleus after a
direct hit.
Bubble Chamber
In order to clarify investiga
tions of this area the particles
are guided through either a bub
ble or spark chamber. The bub
ble chamber is presently at the
Lawrence Radiation Laboratory
in Berkeley. It was be expanded
from seventy-two inches to
eighty-two inches to accommo
date mumeson research.
Total cost of moving the two
hundred seventy ton camber to
SLAC and of modifications: one
million dollars. The steamer
spark chamber is a gigantic de
tector (two meters long) devel
oped at Stanford for use with
the accelerator.
Another interest field associ
ated with scattering is learning
what reactions particles can
cause when they are focused as
a beam to bombard another tar
get, a process known in accelera
tor circles as secondary beam
bombardment. Three specrome
ters analyze results of known
particles hitting unknown tar
gets while the chambers anal
yze unknown particles hitting
known targets.
Although a national facility,
the accelerator is run as a de
partment of the university and
is open for inspection six days
a week.
