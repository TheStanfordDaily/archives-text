The Painted Bird, by Jerzy Ko
sinski, (Pocket Books) 35 cents.
Jerzy Kosinski's Painted Bird
is a compelling tale focusing on
the banality of superstition, the
banality of violence, and the di
lemma of alienated man. It is
brilliantly written, displaying
throughout, the author's incis
ive descriptive capability. Kosin
ski makes every episode a new
Intricate variation on what he
considers to be the timeless
danse macabre of civilization.
The novel takes place in Nazi
occupied rural Eastern Europe.
But considering the setting, the
truculent figures in the book are
not usual ones. The Soviet and
Nazi soldiers are actually kind.
It is the peasants who are in
humane. During the Kalmuks'
raid, the similarity of the peas
ants and the massacring Kal
muks is unmistakable.
The only part of the book
which is emphatically concerned
with the evils of National Social
ism is the rather impersonal
impression which one gets of
the trainloads of Jews going to
be gassed in the concentration
camps. Even here the author's
emphasis on the Nazis is subor
dinate to the overall importance
of the peasants.

The small boy who narrates
the story (one never learns his
name) is six years old at the
book's beginning, twelve at its
end. He has been separated from
parents because of their wish to
spare him from Nazi persecu
tion. He wanders about from
village to village in the most
backward parts of Eastern Eur
ope. He is considered a Jewish
or Gypsy stray because the
peasants are unfamiliar with his
educated accent and his dark
complexion.
The incident from which the
title The Paintod Bird was taken
offers an excellent example of
the book's thematic concern
with alienation and the banality
of violence. In the course of his
wanderings, the small boy stays
for a while with a birdman, a
man who prepares stork nests
for houses and who captures
and sells birds.
As a way of venting his rage,
this birdman takes one of his
birds, and paints its feathers

bright colors. He then goes into
the forest, squeezes the bird
gently so that its cries attract
a flock of the same species over
head. At this point the bird is
released; it flies upward, eager
to join its fellows, and they peck
it to death because of its strange
color pattern.
The Painted Bird is somewhat
reminiscent of the Lord of the
Flies because both are charac
terized by a belief that there is
an all-pervading seething savag
ery which is imperfectly con
cealed by the delicate super
structure of civilization.
Through his portrayal of the
brutality and superstition of the
peasants, Kosinski is attempting
to demonstrate that violent,
pagan man is more natural than
civilized man.

ism is the rather impersonal
impression which one gets of
the trainloads of Jews going to
be gassed in the concentration
camps. Even here the author's
emphasis on the Nazis is subor
dinate to the overall importance
of the peasants.

The small boy who narrates
the story (one never learns his
name) is six years old at the
book's beginning, twelve at its
end. He has been separated from
parents because of their wish to
spare him from Nazi persecu
tion. He wanders about from
village to village in the most
backward parts of Eastern Eur
ope. He is considered a Jewish
or Gypsy stray because the
peasants are unfamiliar with his
educated accent and his dark
complexion.
The incident from which the
title The Paintod Bird was taken
offers an excellent example of
the book's thematic concern
with alienation and the banality
of violence. In the course of his
wanderings, the small boy stays
for a while with a birdman, a
man who prepares stork nests
for houses and who captures
and sells birds.
As a way of venting his rage,
this birdman takes one of his
birds, and paints its feathers

bright colors. He then goes into
the forest, squeezes the bird
gently so that its cries attract
a flock of the same species over
head. At this point the bird is
released; it flies upward, eager
to join its fellows, and they peck
it to death because of its strange
color pattern.
The Painted Bird is somewhat
reminiscent of the Lord of the
Flies because both are charac
terized by a belief that there is
an all-pervading seething savag
ery which is imperfectly con
cealed by the delicate super
structure of civilization.
Through his portrayal of the
brutality and superstition of the
peasants, Kosinski is attempting
to demonstrate that violent,
pagan man is more natural than
civilized man.

Jerzy Kosinski's Painted Bird
is a compelling tale focusing on
the banality of superstition, the
banality of violence, and the di
lemma of alienated man. It is
brilliantly written, displaying
throughout, the author's incis
ive descriptive capability. Kosin
ski makes every episode a new
Intricate variation on what he
considers to be the timeless
danse macabre of civilization.
The novel takes place in Nazi
occupied rural Eastern Europe.
But considering the setting, the
truculent figures in the book are
not usual ones. The Soviet and
Nazi soldiers are actually kind.
It is the peasants who are in
humane. During the Kalmuks'
raid, the similarity of the peas
ants and the massacring Kal
muks is unmistakable.
The only part of the book
which is emphatically concerned
with the evils of National Social
ism is the rather impersonal
impression which one gets of
the trainloads of Jews going to
be gassed in the concentration
camps. Even here the author's
emphasis on the Nazis is subor
