## It's Absurd To Hush Up Good Films On Campus 
### Steve Lavine 
The French department is to
be both congratulated and criti
cized lor its French week film
series. The films were enough
to blow your mind, Shoot the
Piano Player, Lola, Last year at
Marienbad, Lovers and Thieves,
and Children of Paradise.
The French department, how
ever, seems to have made every
attempt to keep the films a
secret. Marienbad played to full
houses both times but when I
say Lola, the room was only %
full and fully half those present
were teenyboppers. A terrible
waste!
Perhaps the French depart
ment is trying to emulate our
renowned history department
that has succeeded so well in
concealing the dates of the West
ern Civ films from upper class
men. Here again one must praise
and criticize. The idea of coordi
nating great films with Western
Civ is excellent. One might even
say it was "progressive" educa
tion (or a step toward the pro
verbial "edge"). To keep the
films secret from the larger
Stanford community is absurd.
The university film this week
is Greed (Erich von Stroheim,
1924). The movie is based on the
Frank Norris novel MeTeague,
written in 1899.

Strohoim set out to film the
book exactly as it was. The re
sult was a film that ran about
10 hours (42 reels). Metro re
fused to release it as it was or
even to release it in two five
hour segments. The film was
turned over to June Mathis, who
cut it to 10 reels.
Even in this mutilated form,
the film stands as one of the
great masterpieces of the Ameri
can cinema. What is most im
mediately striking about the
movie is its absolute fidelity to
the novel. Even the minor char
acters, like the old junkman, are
retained.
Much of the action, as a result
of the cutting, is abrupt and
unprepared for, but this prob
lem is not too disturbing in the
film.
The Saturday TMU film is
This Sporting Life (Lindsay An
derson, 1963). It is one of the
better films to arise from the
social realism school of British
film making that was much in
evidence in the early 1960's.
The reason for its success is
that it goes beyond the limits of
the other films of the period, ex
tensively employing flashbacks
and at least making rudimentary
attempts at a psychological ex
ploration of the characters.
