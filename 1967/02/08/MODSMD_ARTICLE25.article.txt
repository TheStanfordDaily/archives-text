# Surrealistic Story Uses 3-D Images
## 
### CHRISTOPHER HARGROVE The Eye of the Needle, by Ben Stoltzfus, (Viking) $4. 50 
Try to imagine several panes
of glass standing up one behind
the other with a transparent
image painted on each one. If
you stand up close, you can
focus your eyes on each image
separately by looking through
the ones in front of it. If you
stand back far enough, you can
see all the images superimposed
on each other, but the distance

blurs the fine detail of each
Image.
Let this pass as a metaphor
ical description of what I can
only call a three-dimensional
novel: The Eye of the Needle
by Ben Stoltzfus.
Every decent story has its
levels of meaning, of course, de
pending on how deep you care
to delve into symbolism. The
difference in the case of this
book, Stoltzfus' first novel, Is
that he is not trying so much
to tell a story as to describe the
workings of a mind in a period
of emotional crisis.
The situation is the dilemma
of a 14-year-old boy living in a
Nazi-occupied country. The boy
is caught between the strictures
of a hell's-llre-and-brimstone up
bringing and the growing urg
ency of his sexual desires. He
suffers from an obsessive fear
of death compounded by crush
ing sexual guilt. His state of
mind from moment to moment
—his daydreams, fears, mem
ories, inner conflicts—form the
substance of the book.
This boy has many problems,
the most pressing of which is
hinted at in the book's title. He
sees himself as a sinner with
less chance of entering the king
dom of God than the proverbial
camel has of going through the
eye of a needle.
The book reads like a movie
script with all the director's
notes written into it. This is in
tended not as a criticism but
merely to emphasize that Stoltz
fus' style is highly visual. The
vivid descriptions of the boy's
dreams and fantasies are espe
cially good in their surrealistic
detail.
My one complaint with The
Eye of the Needle is that the
author tends to be a little ob
scure about his intentions. There
is virtue in not being obvious
about them, but past a certain
point the reader begins to won
der if it is worth the trouble of
the author's effort to bury them
so deeply or worth the reader's
effort to dig for them.
Perhaps I am not doing the
book justice, having read all the
way through it only once. It is
a consistently engrossing novel,
and it deserves to be read care
fully.

that he is not trying so much
to tell a story as to describe the
workings of a mind in a period
of emotional crisis.
The situation is the dilemma
of a 14-year-old boy living in a
Nazi-occupied country. The boy
is caught between the strictures
of a hell's-llre-and-brimstone up
bringing and the growing urg
ency of his sexual desires. He
suffers from an obsessive fear
of death compounded by crush
ing sexual guilt. His state of
mind from moment to moment
—his daydreams, fears, mem
ories, inner conflicts—form the
substance of the book.
This boy has many problems,
the most pressing of which is
hinted at in the book's title. He
sees himself as a sinner with
less chance of entering the king
dom of God than the proverbial
camel has of going through the
eye of a needle.
The book reads like a movie
script with all the director's
notes written into it. This is in
tended not as a criticism but
merely to emphasize that Stoltz
fus' style is highly visual. The
vivid descriptions of the boy's
dreams and fantasies are espe
cially good in their surrealistic
detail.
My one complaint with The
Eye of the Needle is that the
author tends to be a little ob
scure about his intentions. There
is virtue in not being obvious
about them, but past a certain
point the reader begins to won
der if it is worth the trouble of
the author's effort to bury them
so deeply or worth the reader's
effort to dig for them.
Perhaps I am not doing the
book justice, having read all the
way through it only once. It is
a consistently engrossing novel,
and it deserves to be read care
fully.
Try to imagine several panes
of glass standing up one behind
the other with a transparent
image painted on each one. If
you stand up close, you can
focus your eyes on each image
separately by looking through
the ones in front of it. If you
stand back far enough, you can
see all the images superimposed
on each other, but the distance

blurs the fine detail of each
Image.
Let this pass as a metaphor
ical description of what I can
only call a three-dimensional
novel: The Eye of the Needle
by Ben Stoltzfus.
Every decent story has its
levels of meaning, of course, de
pending on how deep you care
to delve into symbolism. The
difference in the case of this
book, Stoltzfus' first novel, Is
that he is not trying so much
