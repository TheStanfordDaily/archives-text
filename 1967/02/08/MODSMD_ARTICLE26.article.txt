Second In A Series
In part one, Robert Hutchins,
President of the Center, began
his discussion of "The Issues"
by remarking that in the
United States the university is
more subject to outside control
than in other countries, and
is also given diverse tasks
which elsewhere are generally
assigned to other institutions
than the university. The fol
lowing excerpts complete
Hutchins' article.
These considerations suggest
that whereas other countries
have an idea of a university,
however inadequate, vague, or
even erroneous, we have none.
The idea of an omnium gath
erum cannot be taken seriously.
An idea enables you to tell what
is appropriate and what not,
what is to be included and what
left out.
The idea shapes the constitu
tion, the external and internal
relationships, and the activities
of the university. It holds the
place together and defines and
protects it.
All we have to do to decide
whether we have an Idea of a
university is to ask ourselves
whether there is anything imag
inable that would seem inappro
priate in an American institution
of higher learning.
I shall never forget—though I
have often tried—the last meet
ing of the Big Ten presidents I
attended, fifteen years ago.
Embarrassing
The President of the Univer
sity of Michigan said, "Say I,
want to ask you fellows, what
are we going to do about em
balming?" He went on to report
that the embalmers in his state
wanted to become a profession
for the double purpose of limit
ing competition and raising their
social standing.
This they proposed to accom
plish by establishing a school
of embalming at the University
of Michigan and requiring all
practitioners to have a degree
from the school before being
permitted to embalm any resi
dent of the state.
None of us could think of any
reason why the embalmers of
Michigan should not have their
way.
The only consolation offered
by the President of Michigan
came from the President of the
University of Minnesota, who as
sured him that the embalming
program at that great university
had not interfered with its
smooth operation.
If the President of the Univer
sity of Michigan could get no
help from us, he could fine none
either in the works of our prede
cessors or contemporaries.
The platform on which Charles
W. Eliotfi Andrew D. White,
David Starr Jordan, and Ben
jamin Ide Wheeler took their
stand was that any subject, in
terest, or activity was as good
as any other. Nothing was more
important or more trivil than
anything else.

In justice to these great and
good men, I must add that their
rhetoric may have seemed war
ranted at the time. They were
trying to break open an ancient,
narrow curriculum in order to
let science in.
But they did not foresee where
their argument would lead. In
his inaugural address in 1968
Mr. Eliot said, "It will be gen
erations before the best Ameri
can institutions will ge enough
growth to bear pruning."
But by 1905, Henry Seidel Can
by of Yale wrote, a young in
structor could look upon an
American university, this un
heard-of combination of sporting
resort, beer garden, political con
vention, laboratory, and factory
for research, with a mind as con
fused as a Spanish omelet.
And Norman Foerster could
report by 1931 that a student at
the University of Nebraska could
takes courses in early Irish, crea
tive thinking, American English,
first aid, advanced clothing, ice
cream and ices, third year
Czechoslovakian, football, sew
erage, and a man's problems in
the modern home.
Armed Truce
The most recent historian of
the American university says the
principle that any subject is as
good as another led to a kind of
armed truce among departments
and specialists—live and let live
became the slogan.
"The university," he says,
"went several different ways at
once. It crystallized into a collec
tion of divergent minds, usually
ignoring each other, commonly
talking past one another, and
periodically enjoying the illusion
of dialogue on 'safe' issues."
Even departments and schools
now seem to be loose associa
tions of professors who are
seldom, to borrow a phrase from
physics, in a solid state. They
are here today and gone tomor
row, consulting, advising, and
confering.
The situation would have de
lighted Heraclitus: you cannot
put your foot in the same uni
versity twice.
The historian I have quoted
says that what holds the place
together is bureaucracy — the
standardized practices by which
everybody has to live in order to
live at all.
But standardized practices can
not hold anything together un
less the object of the exercise is
first understood and agreed up
on. What is the object toward
which the procedures of the
American university are direct
ed?
Reply
President Pusey of Harvard
has a reply. To the question,

Is there a central dominating
idea enlivening the American
university today, he says,"The
answer is, most certainly, yes.
For such an idea is found in the
devotion to learning which per
meates the whole community
and in recognition of learning's
importance for a full manner of
life. . . . Through scholars today
often appear to pursue separate
ways within universities—quite
unaware of their colleague's exis
tence . . . —still by and large
they all are, and know they are,
working in a common vineyard.
"They know it is not their
specialities but 'learning' . . .
that they have in common. The
connecting link for all within the
university remains learning thus
understood, a compact of knowl
edge, effort, and hope."
A professor on the other side
of the tracks, at Boston Univer
sity, remained unimpressed by
the arcane union in a common
vineyard of workers unaware of
one another, indiscriminately cul
tivating grapes and thistles, and
unable, in fact, to tell one from
the other.
He spoke for many when he
said, T consider such statements
. . . falsely reassuring and deep
ly misleading in masking the
contemporary crisis in the Amer
ican multiversity."
Grape-Thistle
I gather the current answer
to the grape-thistle question is
that it is all much ado about
very little. We have decided that
all thistles are grapes, or that
a few thistles won't damage
the wine.
Mr. Pusey's vision of the vine
yard cannot match, for sheer
unrestrained lyricism, the meta
phor of President Perkins of
Cornell.
He says,"The univertiy and
the other institutions of society
—including the corporation, the
farm, the cultural center, and
the government agency — have
now been joined together by a
new kind of blood stream, made
up of the ideas, the trained in
telligence, and the manpower
which provide the driving en
ergy for our society.
And the university is the great
Jumping heart that keeps this
system fresh, invigorated, and in
motion."
Golly!
One is tempted to resort to
one of President Eisenhower's
more expressive utterances and
say simply "Golly!"
But such primitive sounds are
unequal to the demands of an
occasion like this, and we must
press on to more elaborate form
ulations of awe and wonder.
The objection to the great
pumping heart is not merely that

it is an example of the fallacy
of misplaced physiological con
creteness —one would have ex
pected Mr. Perkins to refer to
the brain.
The fundamental objection is
that it takes the society as given,
with all its folly and pretentious
ness, and asks the university to
supply some of the facilities,
most the hands, a lot of the en
ergy, and all of the ideas that
will enable the society to achieve
its mistaken goals.
Service Station
This is really the old service
station, refurbished, with plus
lounges, fluorescent lights, and
gaudier signs in bigger words.
Whatever the society wants
the university will do, provided
it gets the money to pay for it.
And it is not even what the so
ciety wants. It is what the most
vocal pressure groups demand.
Some light on this subjffiect
comes from an unlikely source,
the government of the United
Arab Republic.
Its official statement is, "It is
not an accepted practice for uni
versities to undertake supported
research from private organiza
tions or Government agencies.
This has safeguarded the free
dom of research and has made it
possible for the teaching staff to
devote more time to basic re
search."
The old service station ren
dered service of a kind; there is
no doubt about that. And there
is no doubt that the new one,
with its far more lavish re
sources and equipment, will ren
der more and perhaps better ser
vice of that kind.
Lose The University?
The only question is whether
we lose something in the process.
Perhaps we lose the university.
An institution is defined by its
task. Its task is defined by ask
ing what it alone can do, or what
it can do better than any other
institution.
The functions of the service
station can be • carried out by
training schools, junior colleges,
research institutes, hospitals,
commerical laboratories, experi
ment stations, or what you will.
There are services offered by
the Boy Scouts, the YMCA, pub
lic libraries, settlement houses,
city planners, and professional
athletic teams.
But the greatest service, the
service the country needs most,
cannot be performed by a service
station, no matter how modern
its facilities or how elevated its
advertising.
What the country needs most
the university, and only the uni
versity, could supply, and that
is intellectual leadership.
The university could fashion

the mind of the age. Now it is
the other way round. The de
mands of the age are fashioning
the mind, if one may use the ex
pression, of the university.
Mind Of The Age
If it is to fashion the mind of
the age and not be fashioned by
it, the university must be a cen
ter of independent thought and
criticism, an autonomous think
ing community.
If it could be that, it would
automatically rid itself of its
cannibalistic tendencies; it would
have to disgorge a vast range of
miscellaneous, irrelevant activi
ties that it has swallowed.
By disgorging the freshman
and sophomore years and limit
ing its professors and students
to those capable of independent
thought it would get rid of
many aspects of immaturity that
now confuse it and its support
ers.
It would at the same time solve
the ancient problem of teaching
vs. research. Professors and stu
dents could be joined together
in an endeavor in which teach
ing and research were indistin
guishable.
To be an autonomous thinking
community a university would
have to be small.
Lord James of Rusholme has
lately proposed that universities
should be limited to three thou
sand students, that they should
be made up of small colleges,
and that when an existing uni
versity was threatened by larger
numbers, a new one should be
built across the street.
Something of this sort has
happened in Toronto. A university
of this size, organized on this
plan, would be small enough to
be a community and small
enough to get along without an
overwhelming bureaucracy.
Jaspers
When Karl Jaspers suggested
something new in Europe, a tech
nological faculty in the univer
sity, he did it for a most un-
American reason.
He explicitly did not do it be
cause he was concerned that his
country, or Europe, was falling
behind in the production of en
gineers, or because he wanted to
make the university the great
pumping heart of the industrial
system.
He did it because he wanted to
put technology in its place. He
wanted to bring it within the
circle of knowledge and not
leave it to technicians. He want
ed to subject other disciplines to
interaction with it and it to in
teraction with other disciplines.

said, T consider such statements
. . . falsely reassuring and deep
ly misleading in masking the
contemporary crisis in the Amer
ican multiversity."
Grape-Thistle
I gather the current answer
to the grape-thistle question is
that it is all much ado about
very little. We have decided that
all thistles are grapes, or that
a few thistles won't damage
the wine.
Mr. Pusey's vision of the vine
yard cannot match, for sheer
unrestrained lyricism, the meta
phor of President Perkins of
Cornell.
He says,"The univertiy and
the other institutions of society
—including the corporation, the
farm, the cultural center, and
the government agency — have
now been joined together by a
new kind of blood stream, made
up of the ideas, the trained in
telligence, and the manpower
which provide the driving en
ergy for our society.
And the university is the great
Jumping heart that keeps this
system fresh, invigorated, and in
motion."
Golly!
One is tempted to resort to
one of President Eisenhower's
more expressive utterances and
say simply "Golly!"
But such primitive sounds are
unequal to the demands of an
occasion like this, and we must
press on to more elaborate form
ulations of awe and wonder.
The objection to the great
pumping heart is not merely that

it is an example of the fallacy
of misplaced physiological con
creteness —one would have ex
pected Mr. Perkins to refer to
the brain.
The fundamental objection is
that it takes the society as given,
with all its folly and pretentious
ness, and asks the university to
supply some of the facilities,
most the hands, a lot of the en
ergy, and all of the ideas that
will enable the society to achieve
its mistaken goals.
Service Station
This is really the old service
station, refurbished, with plus
lounges, fluorescent lights, and
gaudier signs in bigger words.
Whatever the society wants
the university will do, provided
it gets the money to pay for it.
And it is not even what the so
ciety wants. It is what the most
vocal pressure groups demand.
Some light on this subjffiect
comes from an unlikely source,
the government of the United
Arab Republic.
Its official statement is, "It is
not an accepted practice for uni
versities to undertake supported
research from private organiza
tions or Government agencies.
This has safeguarded the free
dom of research and has made it
possible for the teaching staff to
devote more time to basic re
search."
The old service station ren
dered service of a kind; there is
no doubt about that. And there
is no doubt that the new one,
with its far more lavish re
sources and equipment, will ren
der more and perhaps better ser
vice of that kind.
Lose The University?
The only question is whether
we lose something in the process.
Perhaps we lose the university.
An institution is defined by its
task. Its task is defined by ask
ing what it alone can do, or what
it can do better than any other
institution.
The functions of the service
station can be • carried out by
training schools, junior colleges,
research institutes, hospitals,
commerical laboratories, experi
ment stations, or what you will.
There are services offered by
the Boy Scouts, the YMCA, pub
lic libraries, settlement houses,
city planners, and professional
athletic teams.
But the greatest service, the
service the country needs most,
cannot be performed by a service
station, no matter how modern
its facilities or how elevated its
advertising.
What the country needs most
the university, and only the uni
versity, could supply, and that
is intellectual leadership.
The university could fashion

the mind of the age. Now it is
the other way round. The de
mands of the age are fashioning
the mind, if one may use the ex
pression, of the university.
Mind Of The Age
If it is to fashion the mind of
the age and not be fashioned by
it, the university must be a cen
ter of independent thought and
criticism, an autonomous think
ing community.
If it could be that, it would
automatically rid itself of its
cannibalistic tendencies; it would
have to disgorge a vast range of
miscellaneous, irrelevant activi
ties that it has swallowed.
By disgorging the freshman
and sophomore years and limit
ing its professors and students
to those capable of independent
thought it would get rid of
many aspects of immaturity that
now confuse it and its support
ers.
It would at the same time solve
the ancient problem of teaching
vs. research. Professors and stu
dents could be joined together
in an endeavor in which teach
ing and research were indistin
guishable.
To be an autonomous thinking
community a university would
have to be small.
Lord James of Rusholme has
lately proposed that universities
should be limited to three thou
sand students, that they should
be made up of small colleges,
and that when an existing uni
versity was threatened by larger
numbers, a new one should be
built across the street.
Something of this sort has
happened in Toronto. A university
of this size, organized on this
plan, would be small enough to
be a community and small
enough to get along without an
overwhelming bureaucracy.
Jaspers
When Karl Jaspers suggested
something new in Europe, a tech
nological faculty in the univer
sity, he did it for a most un-
American reason.
He explicitly did not do it be
cause he was concerned that his
country, or Europe, was falling
behind in the production of en
gineers, or because he wanted to
make the university the great
pumping heart of the industrial
system.
He did it because he wanted to
put technology in its place. He
wanted to bring it within the
circle of knowledge and not
leave it to technicians. He want
ed to subject other disciplines to
interaction with it and it to in
teraction with other disciplines.

Second In A Series
In part one, Robert Hutchins,
President of the Center, began
his discussion of "The Issues"
by remarking that in the
United States the university is
more subject to outside control
than in other countries, and
is also given diverse tasks
which elsewhere are generally
assigned to other institutions
than the university. The fol
lowing excerpts complete
Hutchins' article.
These considerations suggest
that whereas other countries
have an idea of a university,
however inadequate, vague, or
even erroneous, we have none.
The idea of an omnium gath
erum cannot be taken seriously.
An idea enables you to tell what
is appropriate and what not,
what is to be included and what
left out.
The idea shapes the constitu
tion, the external and internal
relationships, and the activities
of the university. It holds the
place together and defines and
protects it.
All we have to do to decide
whether we have an Idea of a
university is to ask ourselves
whether there is anything imag
inable that would seem inappro
priate in an American institution
of higher learning.
I shall never forget—though I
have often tried—the last meet
ing of the Big Ten presidents I
attended, fifteen years ago.
Embarrassing
The President of the Univer
sity of Michigan said, "Say I,
want to ask you fellows, what
are we going to do about em
balming?" He went on to report
that the embalmers in his state
wanted to become a profession
for the double purpose of limit
ing competition and raising their
social standing.
This they proposed to accom
plish by establishing a school
of embalming at the University
of Michigan and requiring all
practitioners to have a degree
from the school before being
permitted to embalm any resi
dent of the state.
None of us could think of any
reason why the embalmers of
Michigan should not have their
way.
The only consolation offered
by the President of Michigan
came from the President of the
University of Minnesota, who as
sured him that the embalming
program at that great university
had not interfered with its
smooth operation.
If the President of the Univer
sity of Michigan could get no
help from us, he could fine none
either in the works of our prede
cessors or contemporaries.
The platform on which Charles
W. Eliotfi Andrew D. White,
David Starr Jordan, and Ben
jamin Ide Wheeler took their
stand was that any subject, in
terest, or activity was as good
as any other. Nothing was more
important or more trivil than
anything else.

In justice to these great and
good men, I must add that their
rhetoric may have seemed war
ranted at the time. They were
trying to break open an ancient,
narrow curriculum in order to
let science in.
But they did not foresee where
their argument would lead. In
his inaugural address in 1968
Mr. Eliot said, "It will be gen
erations before the best Ameri
can institutions will ge enough
growth to bear pruning."
But by 1905, Henry Seidel Can
by of Yale wrote, a young in
structor could look upon an
American university, this un
heard-of combination of sporting
resort, beer garden, political con
vention, laboratory, and factory
for research, with a mind as con
fused as a Spanish omelet.
And Norman Foerster could
report by 1931 that a student at
the University of Nebraska could
takes courses in early Irish, crea
tive thinking, American English,
first aid, advanced clothing, ice
cream and ices, third year
Czechoslovakian, football, sew
erage, and a man's problems in
the modern home.
Armed Truce
The most recent historian of
the American university says the
principle that any subject is as
good as another led to a kind of
armed truce among departments
and specialists—live and let live
became the slogan.
"The university," he says,
"went several different ways at
once. It crystallized into a collec
tion of divergent minds, usually
ignoring each other, commonly
talking past one another, and
periodically enjoying the illusion
of dialogue on 'safe' issues."
Even departments and schools
now seem to be loose associa
tions of professors who are
seldom, to borrow a phrase from
physics, in a solid state. They
are here today and gone tomor
row, consulting, advising, and
confering.
The situation would have de
lighted Heraclitus: you cannot
put your foot in the same uni
versity twice.
The historian I have quoted
says that what holds the place
together is bureaucracy — the
standardized practices by which
everybody has to live in order to
live at all.
But standardized practices can
not hold anything together un
less the object of the exercise is
first understood and agreed up
on. What is the object toward
which the procedures of the
American university are direct
ed?
Reply
President Pusey of Harvard
has a reply. To the question,

Is there a central dominating
idea enlivening the American
university today, he says,"The
answer is, most certainly, yes.
For such an idea is found in the
devotion to learning which per
meates the whole community
and in recognition of learning's
importance for a full manner of
life. . . . Through scholars today
often appear to pursue separate
ways within universities—quite
unaware of their colleague's exis
tence . . . —still by and large
they all are, and know they are,
working in a common vineyard.
"They know it is not their
specialities but 'learning' . . .
that they have in common. The
connecting link for all within the
university remains learning thus
understood, a compact of knowl
edge, effort, and hope."
A professor on the other side
of the tracks, at Boston Univer
sity, remained unimpressed by
the arcane union in a common
vineyard of workers unaware of
one another, indiscriminately cul
tivating grapes and thistles, and
unable, in fact, to tell one from
the other.
He spoke for many when he
said, T consider such statements
. . . falsely reassuring and deep
ly misleading in masking the
contemporary crisis in the Amer
ican multiversity."
Grape-Thistle
I gather the current answer
to the grape-thistle question is
that it is all much ado about
very little. We have decided that
all thistles are grapes, or that
a few thistles won't damage
the wine.
Mr. Pusey's vision of the vine
yard cannot match, for sheer
unrestrained lyricism, the meta
phor of President Perkins of
Cornell.
He says,"The univertiy and
the other institutions of society
—including the corporation, the
farm, the cultural center, and
the government agency — have
now been joined together by a
new kind of blood stream, made
up of the ideas, the trained in
telligence, and the manpower
which provide the driving en
ergy for our society.
And the university is the great
Jumping heart that keeps this
system fresh, invigorated, and in
motion."
Golly!
One is tempted to resort to
one of President Eisenhower's
more expressive utterances and
say simply "Golly!"
But such primitive sounds are
unequal to the demands of an
occasion like this, and we must
press on to more elaborate form
ulations of awe and wonder.
The objection to the great
pumping heart is not merely that

it is an example of the fallacy
of misplaced physiological con
creteness —one would have ex
pected Mr. Perkins to refer to
the brain.
The fundamental objection is
that it takes the society as given,
with all its folly and pretentious
ness, and asks the university to
supply some of the facilities,
most the hands, a lot of the en
ergy, and all of the ideas that

its mistaken goals.

This is really the old service
station, refurbished, with plus
lounges, fluorescent lights, and
gaudier signs in bigger words.
Whatever the society wants

And it is not even what the so

vocal pressure groups demand.

In part one, Robert Hutchins,
President of the Center, began
his discussion of "The Issues"
by remarking that in the
United States the university is
more subject to outside control
than in other countries, and
is also given diverse tasks
which elsewhere are generally
assigned to other institutions
than the university. The fol
lowing excerpts complete
Hutchins' article.
These considerations suggest
that whereas other countries
have an idea of a university,
however inadequate, vague, or
even erroneous, we have none.
The idea of an omnium gath
erum cannot be taken seriously.
An idea enables you to tell what
is appropriate and what not,
what is to be included and what
left out.
The idea shapes the constitu
tion, the external and internal
relationships, and the activities
of the university. It holds the
place together and defines and
protects it.
All we have to do to decide
whether we have an Idea of a
university is to ask ourselves
whether there is anything imag
inable that would seem inappro
priate in an American institution
of higher learning.
I shall never forget—though I
have often tried—the last meet
ing of the Big Ten presidents I
attended, fifteen years ago.
Embarrassing
The President of the Univer
sity of Michigan said, "Say I,
want to ask you fellows, what
are we going to do about em
balming?" He went on to report
that the embalmers in his state
wanted to become a profession
for the double purpose of limit
ing competition and raising their
social standing.
This they proposed to accom
plish by establishing a school
of embalming at the University
of Michigan and requiring all
practitioners to have a degree
from the school before being
permitted to embalm any resi
dent of the state.
None of us could think of any
reason why the embalmers of
Michigan should not have their
way.
The only consolation offered
by the President of Michigan
came from the President of the
University of Minnesota, who as
sured him that the embalming
program at that great university
had not interfered with its
smooth operation.
If the President of the Univer
sity of Michigan could get no
help from us, he could fine none
either in the works of our prede
cessors or contemporaries.
The platform on which Charles
W. Eliotfi Andrew D. White,
David Starr Jordan, and Ben
jamin Ide Wheeler took their
stand was that any subject, in
terest, or activity was as good
as any other. Nothing was more
important or more trivil than
anything else.

In justice to these great and
good men, I must add that their
rhetoric may have seemed war
ranted at the time. They were
trying to break open an ancient,
narrow curriculum in order to
let science in.
But they did not foresee where
their argument would lead. In
his inaugural address in 1968
Mr. Eliot said, "It will be gen
erations before the best Ameri
can institutions will ge enough
growth to bear pruning."
But by 1905, Henry Seidel Can
by of Yale wrote, a young in
structor could look upon an
American university, this un
heard-of combination of sporting
resort, beer garden, political con
vention, laboratory, and factory
for research, with a mind as con
fused as a Spanish omelet.
And Norman Foerster could
report by 1931 that a student at
the University of Nebraska could
takes courses in early Irish, crea
tive thinking, American English,
first aid, advanced clothing, ice
cream and ices, third year
Czechoslovakian, football, sew
erage, and a man's problems in
the modern home.
Armed Truce
The most recent historian of
the American university says the
principle that any subject is as
good as another led to a kind of
armed truce among departments
and specialists—live and let live
became the slogan.
"The university," he says,
"went several different ways at
once. It crystallized into a collec
tion of divergent minds, usually
ignoring each other, commonly
talking past one another, and
periodically enjoying the illusion
of dialogue on 'safe' issues."
Even departments and schools
now seem to be loose associa
tions of professors who are
seldom, to borrow a phrase from
physics, in a solid state. They
are here today and gone tomor
row, consulting, advising, and
confering.
The situation would have de
lighted Heraclitus: you cannot
put your foot in the same uni
versity twice.
The historian I have quoted
says that what holds the place
together is bureaucracy — the
standardized practices by which
everybody has to live in order to
live at all.
But standardized practices can
not hold anything together un
less the object of the exercise is
first understood and agreed up
on. What is the object toward
which the procedures of the
American university are direct
ed?
Reply
President Pusey of Harvard
has a reply. To the question,

Is there a central dominating
idea enlivening the American
university today, he says,"The
answer is, most certainly, yes.
For such an idea is found in the
devotion to learning which per
meates the whole community
and in recognition of learning's
importance for a full manner of
life. . . . Through scholars today
often appear to pursue separate
ways within universities—quite
unaware of their colleague's exis
tence . . . —still by and large
they all are, and know they are,
working in a common vineyard.
"They know it is not their
specialities but 'learning' . . .
that they have in common. The
connecting link for all within the
university remains learning thus
understood, a compact of knowl
edge, effort, and hope."
A professor on the other side
of the tracks, at Boston Univer
sity, remained unimpressed by
the arcane union in a common
vineyard of workers unaware of
one another, indiscriminately cul
tivating grapes and thistles, and
unable, in fact, to tell one from
the other.
He spoke for many when he
said, T consider such statements
. . . falsely reassuring and deep
ly misleading in masking the
contemporary crisis in the Amer
ican multiversity."
Grape-Thistle
I gather the current answer
to the grape-thistle question is
that it is all much ado about
very little. We have decided that
all thistles are grapes, or that
a few thistles won't damage
the wine.
Mr. Pusey's vision of the vine
yard cannot match, for sheer
unrestrained lyricism, the meta
phor of President Perkins of
Cornell.
He says,"The univertiy and
the other institutions of society
—including the corporation, the
farm, the cultural center, and
the government agency — have
now been joined together by a
new kind of blood stream, made
up of the ideas, the trained in
telligence, and the manpower
which provide the driving en
ergy for our society.
And the university is the great
Jumping heart that keeps this
system fresh, invigorated, and in
motion."
Golly!
One is tempted to resort to
one of President Eisenhower's
more expressive utterances and
say simply "Golly!"
But such primitive sounds are
unequal to the demands of an
occasion like this, and we must
press on to more elaborate form
ulations of awe and wonder.
The objection to the great
pumping heart is not merely that

it is an example of the fallacy
of misplaced physiological con
creteness —one would have ex
pected Mr. Perkins to refer to
the brain.
The fundamental objection is
that it takes the society as given,
with all its folly and pretentious
ness, and asks the university to
supply some of the facilities,
most the hands, a lot of the en
ergy, and all of the ideas that
will enable the society to achieve
its mistaken goals.
Service Station
This is really the old service
station, refurbished, with plus
lounges, fluorescent lights, and
gaudier signs in bigger words.
Whatever the society wants
the university will do, provided
it gets the money to pay for it.
And it is not even what the so
ciety wants. It is what the most
vocal pressure groups demand.
Some light on this subjffiect
comes from an unlikely source,
the government of the United
Arab Republic.
Its official statement is, "It is
not an accepted practice for uni
versities to undertake supported
research from private organiza
tions or Government agencies.
This has safeguarded the free
dom of research and has made it
possible for the teaching staff to
devote more time to basic re
search."
The old service station ren
dered service of a kind; there is
no doubt about that. And there
is no doubt that the new one,
with its far more lavish re
sources and equipment, will ren
der more and perhaps better ser
vice of that kind.
Lose The University?
The only question is whether
we lose something in the process.
Perhaps we lose the university.
An institution is defined by its
task. Its task is defined by ask
ing what it alone can do, or what
it can do better than any other
institution.
The functions of the service
station can be • carried out by
training schools, junior colleges,
research institutes, hospitals,
commerical laboratories, experi
ment stations, or what you will.
There are services offered by
the Boy Scouts, the YMCA, pub
lic libraries, settlement houses,
city planners, and professional
athletic teams.
But the greatest service, the
service the country needs most,
cannot be performed by a service
station, no matter how modern
its facilities or how elevated its
advertising.
What the country needs most
the university, and only the uni
versity, could supply, and that
is intellectual leadership.
The university could fashion

the mind of the age. Now it is
the other way round. The de
mands of the age are fashioning
the mind, if one may use the ex
pression, of the university.
Mind Of The Age
If it is to fashion the mind of
the age and not be fashioned by
it, the university must be a cen
ter of independent thought and
criticism, an autonomous think
ing community.
If it could be that, it would
automatically rid itself of its
cannibalistic tendencies; it would
have to disgorge a vast range of
miscellaneous, irrelevant activi
ties that it has swallowed.
By disgorging the freshman
and sophomore years and limit
ing its professors and students
to those capable of independent
thought it would get rid of
many aspects of immaturity that
now confuse it and its support
ers.
It would at the same time solve
the ancient problem of teaching
vs. research. Professors and stu
dents could be joined together
in an endeavor in which teach
ing and research were indistin
guishable.
To be an autonomous thinking
community a university would
have to be small.
Lord James of Rusholme has
lately proposed that universities
should be limited to three thou
sand students, that they should
be made up of small colleges,
and that when an existing uni
versity was threatened by larger
numbers, a new one should be
built across the street.
Something of this sort has
happened in Toronto. A university
of this size, organized on this
plan, would be small enough to
be a community and small
enough to get along without an
overwhelming bureaucracy.
Jaspers
When Karl Jaspers suggested
something new in Europe, a tech
nological faculty in the univer
sity, he did it for a most un-
American reason.
He explicitly did not do it be
cause he was concerned that his
country, or Europe, was falling
behind in the production of en
gineers, or because he wanted to
make the university the great
pumping heart of the industrial
system.
He did it because he wanted to
put technology in its place. He
wanted to bring it within the
circle of knowledge and not
leave it to technicians. He want
ed to subject other disciplines to
interaction with it and it to in
teraction with other disciplines.

the wine.
Mr. Pusey's vision of the vine
yard cannot match, for sheer
unrestrained lyricism, the meta
phor of President Perkins of
Cornell.
He says,"The univertiy and
the other institutions of society
—including the corporation, the
farm, the cultural center, and
the government agency — have
now been joined together by a
new kind of blood stream, made
up of the ideas, the trained in
telligence, and the manpower
which provide the driving en
ergy for our society.
And the university is the great
Jumping heart that keeps this
system fresh, invigorated, and in
motion."
Golly!
One is tempted to resort to
one of President Eisenhower's
more expressive utterances and
say simply "Golly!"
But such primitive sounds are
unequal to the demands of an
occasion like this, and we must
press on to more elaborate form
ulations of awe and wonder.
The objection to the great
pumping heart is not merely that

it is an example of the fallacy
of misplaced physiological con
creteness —one would have ex
pected Mr. Perkins to refer to
the brain.
The fundamental objection is
that it takes the society as given,
with all its folly and pretentious
ness, and asks the university to
supply some of the facilities,
most the hands, a lot of the en
ergy, and all of the ideas that
will enable the society to achieve
its mistaken goals.
Service Station
This is really the old service
station, refurbished, with plus
lounges, fluorescent lights, and
gaudier signs in bigger words.
Whatever the society wants
the university will do, provided
it gets the money to pay for it.
And it is not even what the so
ciety wants. It is what the most
vocal pressure groups demand.
Some light on this subjffiect
comes from an unlikely source,
the government of the United
Arab Republic.
Its official statement is, "It is
not an accepted practice for uni
versities to undertake supported
research from private organiza
tions or Government agencies.
This has safeguarded the free
dom of research and has made it
possible for the teaching staff to
devote more time to basic re
search."
The old service station ren
dered service of a kind; there is
no doubt about that. And there
is no doubt that the new one,
with its far more lavish re
sources and equipment, will ren
der more and perhaps better ser
vice of that kind.
Lose The University?
The only question is whether
we lose something in the process.
Perhaps we lose the university.
An institution is defined by its
task. Its task is defined by ask
ing what it alone can do, or what
it can do better than any other
institution.
The functions of the service
station can be • carried out by
training schools, junior colleges,
research institutes, hospitals,
commerical laboratories, experi
ment stations, or what you will.
There are services offered by
the Boy Scouts, the YMCA, pub
lic libraries, settlement houses,
city planners, and professional
athletic teams.
But the greatest service, the
service the country needs most,
cannot be performed by a service
station, no matter how modern
its facilities or how elevated its
advertising.
What the country needs most
the university, and only the uni
versity, could supply, and that
is intellectual leadership.
The university could fashion

the mind of the age. Now it is
the other way round. The de
mands of the age are fashioning
the mind, if one may use the ex
pression, of the university.
Mind Of The Age
If it is to fashion the mind of
the age and not be fashioned by
it, the university must be a cen
ter of independent thought and
criticism, an autonomous think
ing community.
If it could be that, it would
automatically rid itself of its
cannibalistic tendencies; it would
have to disgorge a vast range of
miscellaneous, irrelevant activi
ties that it has swallowed.
By disgorging the freshman
and sophomore years and limit
ing its professors and students
to those capable of independent
thought it would get rid of
many aspects of immaturity that
now confuse it and its support
ers.
It would at the same time solve
the ancient problem of teaching
vs. research. Professors and stu
dents could be joined together
in an endeavor in which teach
ing and research were indistin
guishable.
To be an autonomous thinking
community a university would
have to be small.
Lord James of Rusholme has
lately proposed that universities
should be limited to three thou
sand students, that they should
be made up of small colleges,
and that when an existing uni
versity was threatened by larger
numbers, a new one should be
built across the street.
Something of this sort has
happened in Toronto. A university
of this size, organized on this
plan, would be small enough to
be a community and small
enough to get along without an
overwhelming bureaucracy.
Jaspers
When Karl Jaspers suggested
something new in Europe, a tech
nological faculty in the univer
sity, he did it for a most un-
American reason.
He explicitly did not do it be
cause he was concerned that his
country, or Europe, was falling
behind in the production of en
gineers, or because he wanted to
make the university the great
pumping heart of the industrial
system.
He did it because he wanted to
put technology in its place. He
wanted to bring it within the
circle of knowledge and not
leave it to technicians. He want
ed to subject other disciplines to
interaction with it and it to in
teraction with other disciplines.

Second In A Series
In part one, Robert Hutchins,
President of the Center, began
his discussion of "The Issues"
by remarking that in the
United States the university is
more subject to outside control
than in other countries, and
is also given diverse tasks
which elsewhere are generally
assigned to other institutions
than the university. The fol
lowing excerpts complete
Hutchins' article.
These considerations suggest
that whereas other countries
have an idea of a university,
however inadequate, vague, or
even erroneous, we have none.
The idea of an omnium gath
erum cannot be taken seriously.
An idea enables you to tell what
is appropriate and what not,
what is to be included and what
left out.
The idea shapes the constitu
tion, the external and internal
relationships, and the activities
of the university. It holds the
place together and defines and
protects it.
All we have to do to decide
whether we have an Idea of a
university is to ask ourselves
whether there is anything imag
inable that would seem inappro
priate in an American institution
of higher learning.
I shall never forget—though I
have often tried—the last meet
ing of the Big Ten presidents I
attended, fifteen years ago.
Embarrassing
The President of the Univer
sity of Michigan said, "Say I,
want to ask you fellows, what
are we going to do about em
balming?" He went on to report
that the embalmers in his state
wanted to become a profession
for the double purpose of limit
ing competition and raising their
social standing.
This they proposed to accom
plish by establishing a school
of embalming at the University
of Michigan and requiring all
practitioners to have a degree
from the school before being
permitted to embalm any resi
dent of the state.
None of us could think of any
reason why the embalmers of
Michigan should not have their
way.
The only consolation offered
by the President of Michigan
came from the President of the
University of Minnesota, who as
sured him that the embalming
program at that great university
had not interfered with its
smooth operation.
If the President of the Univer
sity of Michigan could get no
help from us, he could fine none
either in the works of our prede
cessors or contemporaries.
The platform on which Charles
W. Eliotfi Andrew D. White,
David Starr Jordan, and Ben
jamin Ide Wheeler took their
stand was that any subject, in
terest, or activity was as good
as any other. Nothing was more
important or more trivil than
anything else.

In justice to these great and
good men, I must add that their
rhetoric may have seemed war
ranted at the time. They were
trying to break open an ancient,
narrow curriculum in order to
let science in.
But they did not foresee where
their argument would lead. In
his inaugural address in 1968
Mr. Eliot said, "It will be gen
erations before the best Ameri
can institutions will ge enough
growth to bear pruning."
But by 1905, Henry Seidel Can
by of Yale wrote, a young in
structor could look upon an
American university, this un
heard-of combination of sporting
resort, beer garden, political con
vention, laboratory, and factory
for research, with a mind as con
fused as a Spanish omelet.
And Norman Foerster could
report by 1931 that a student at
the University of Nebraska could
takes courses in early Irish, crea
tive thinking, American English,
first aid, advanced clothing, ice
cream and ices, third year
Czechoslovakian, football, sew
erage, and a man's problems in
the modern home.
Armed Truce
The most recent historian of
the American university says the
principle that any subject is as
good as another led to a kind of
armed truce among departments
and specialists—live and let live
became the slogan.
"The university," he says,
"went several different ways at
once. It crystallized into a collec
tion of divergent minds, usually
ignoring each other, commonly
talking past one another, and
periodically enjoying the illusion
of dialogue on 'safe' issues."
Even departments and schools
now seem to be loose associa
tions of professors who are
seldom, to borrow a phrase from
physics, in a solid state. They
are here today and gone tomor
row, consulting, advising, and
confering.
The situation would have de
lighted Heraclitus: you cannot
put your foot in the same uni
versity twice.
The historian I have quoted
says that what holds the place
together is bureaucracy — the
standardized practices by which
everybody has to live in order to
live at all.
But standardized practices can
not hold anything together un
less the object of the exercise is
first understood and agreed up
on. What is the object toward
which the procedures of the
American university are direct
ed?
Reply
President Pusey of Harvard
has a reply. To the question,

Is there a central dominating
idea enlivening the American
university today, he says,"The
answer is, most certainly, yes.
For such an idea is found in the
devotion to learning which per
meates the whole community
and in recognition of learning's
importance for a full manner of
life. . . . Through scholars today
often appear to pursue separate
ways within universities—quite
unaware of their colleague's exis
tence . . . —still by and large
they all are, and know they are,
working in a common vineyard.
"They know it is not their
specialities but 'learning' . . .
that they have in common. The
connecting link for all within the
university remains learning thus
understood, a compact of knowl
edge, effort, and hope."
A professor on the other side
of the tracks, at Boston Univer
sity, remained unimpressed by
the arcane union in a common
vineyard of workers unaware of
one another, indiscriminately cul
tivating grapes and thistles, and
unable, in fact, to tell one from
the other.
He spoke for many when he
said, T consider such statements
. . . falsely reassuring and deep
ly misleading in masking the
contemporary crisis in the Amer
ican multiversity."
Grape-Thistle
I gather the current answer
to the grape-thistle question is
that it is all much ado about
very little. We have decided that
all thistles are grapes, or that
a few thistles won't damage
the wine.
Mr. Pusey's vision of the vine
yard cannot match, for sheer
unrestrained lyricism, the meta
phor of President Perkins of
Cornell.
He says,"The univertiy and
the other institutions of society
—including the corporation, the
farm, the cultural center, and
the government agency — have
now been joined together by a
new kind of blood stream, made
up of the ideas, the trained in
telligence, and the manpower
which provide the driving en
ergy for our society.
And the university is the great
Jumping heart that keeps this
system fresh, invigorated, and in
motion."
Golly!
One is tempted to resort to
one of President Eisenhower's
more expressive utterances and
say simply "Golly!"
But such primitive sounds are
unequal to the demands of an
occasion like this, and we must
press on to more elaborate form
ulations of awe and wonder.
The objection to the great
pumping heart is not merely that

it is an example of the fallacy
of misplaced physiological con
creteness —one would have ex
pected Mr. Perkins to refer to
the brain.
The fundamental objection is
that it takes the society as given,
with all its folly and pretentious
ness, and asks the university to
supply some of the facilities,
most the hands, a lot of the en
ergy, and all of the ideas that
will enable the society to achieve
its mistaken goals.

This is really the old service
station, refurbished, with plus
lounges, fluorescent lights, and
gaudier signs in bigger words.
Whatever the society wants

it gets the money to pay for it.
And it is not even what the so
ciety wants. It is what the most
vocal pressure groups demand.

Armed Truce
The most recent historian of
the American university says the
principle that any subject is as
good as another led to a kind of
armed truce among departments
and specialists—live and let live
became the slogan.
"The university," he says,
"went several different ways at
once. It crystallized into a collec
tion of divergent minds, usually
ignoring each other, commonly
talking past one another, and
periodically enjoying the illusion
of dialogue on 'safe' issues."
Even departments and schools
now seem to be loose associa
tions of professors who are
seldom, to borrow a phrase from
physics, in a solid state. They
are here today and gone tomor
row, consulting, advising, and
confering.
The situation would have de
lighted Heraclitus: you cannot
put your foot in the same uni
versity twice.
The historian I have quoted
says that what holds the place
together is bureaucracy — the
standardized practices by which
everybody has to live in order to
live at all.
But standardized practices can
not hold anything together un
less the object of the exercise is
first understood and agreed up
on. What is the object toward
which the procedures of the
American university are direct
ed?
Reply
President Pusey of Harvard
has a reply. To the question,

Is there a central dominating
idea enlivening the American
university today, he says,"The
answer is, most certainly, yes.
For such an idea is found in the
devotion to learning which per
meates the whole community
and in recognition of learning's
importance for a full manner of
life. . . . Through scholars today
often appear to pursue separate
ways within universities—quite
unaware of their colleague's exis
tence . . . —still by and large
they all are, and know they are,
working in a common vineyard.
"They know it is not their
specialities but 'learning' . . .
that they have in common. The
connecting link for all within the
university remains learning thus
understood, a compact of knowl
edge, effort, and hope."
A professor on the other side
of the tracks, at Boston Univer
sity, remained unimpressed by
the arcane union in a common
vineyard of workers unaware of
one another, indiscriminately cul
tivating grapes and thistles, and
unable, in fact, to tell one from
the other.
He spoke for many when he
said, T consider such statements
. . . falsely reassuring and deep
ly misleading in masking the
contemporary crisis in the Amer
ican multiversity."
Grape-Thistle
I gather the current answer
to the grape-thistle question is
that it is all much ado about
very little. We have decided that
all thistles are grapes, or that
a few thistles won't damage
the wine.
Mr. Pusey's vision of the vine
yard cannot match, for sheer
unrestrained lyricism, the meta
phor of President Perkins of
Cornell.
He says,"The univertiy and
the other institutions of society
—including the corporation, the
farm, the cultural center, and
the government agency — have
now been joined together by a
new kind of blood stream, made
up of the ideas, the trained in
telligence, and the manpower
which provide the driving en
ergy for our society.
And the university is the great
Jumping heart that keeps this
system fresh, invigorated, and in
motion."
Golly!
One is tempted to resort to
one of President Eisenhower's
more expressive utterances and
say simply "Golly!"
But such primitive sounds are
unequal to the demands of an
occasion like this, and we must
press on to more elaborate form
ulations of awe and wonder.
The objection to the great
pumping heart is not merely that

it is an example of the fallacy
of misplaced physiological con
creteness —one would have ex
pected Mr. Perkins to refer to
the brain.
The fundamental objection is
that it takes the society as given,
with all its folly and pretentious
ness, and asks the university to
supply some of the facilities,
most the hands, a lot of the en
ergy, and all of the ideas that
will enable the society to achieve
its mistaken goals.
Service Station
This is really the old service
station, refurbished, with plus
lounges, fluorescent lights, and
gaudier signs in bigger words.
Whatever the society wants
the university will do, provided
it gets the money to pay for it.
And it is not even what the so
ciety wants. It is what the most
vocal pressure groups demand.
Some light on this subjffiect
comes from an unlikely source,
the government of the United
Arab Republic.
Its official statement is, "It is
not an accepted practice for uni
versities to undertake supported
research from private organiza
tions or Government agencies.
This has safeguarded the free
dom of research and has made it
possible for the teaching staff to
devote more time to basic re
search."
The old service station ren
dered service of a kind; there is
no doubt about that. And there
is no doubt that the new one,
with its far more lavish re
sources and equipment, will ren
der more and perhaps better ser
vice of that kind.
Lose The University?
The only question is whether
we lose something in the process.
Perhaps we lose the university.
An institution is defined by its
task. Its task is defined by ask
ing what it alone can do, or what
it can do better than any other
institution.
The functions of the service
station can be • carried out by
training schools, junior colleges,
research institutes, hospitals,
commerical laboratories, experi
ment stations, or what you will.
There are services offered by
the Boy Scouts, the YMCA, pub
lic libraries, settlement houses,
city planners, and professional
athletic teams.
But the greatest service, the
service the country needs most,
cannot be performed by a service
station, no matter how modern
its facilities or how elevated its
advertising.
What the country needs most
the university, and only the uni
versity, could supply, and that
is intellectual leadership.
The university could fashion

the mind of the age. Now it is
the other way round. The de
mands of the age are fashioning
the mind, if one may use the ex
pression, of the university.
Mind Of The Age
If it is to fashion the mind of
the age and not be fashioned by
it, the university must be a cen
ter of independent thought and
criticism, an autonomous think
ing community.
If it could be that, it would
automatically rid itself of its
cannibalistic tendencies; it would
have to disgorge a vast range of
miscellaneous, irrelevant activi
ties that it has swallowed.
By disgorging the freshman
and sophomore years and limit
ing its professors and students
to those capable of independent
thought it would get rid of
many aspects of immaturity that
now confuse it and its support
ers.
It would at the same time solve
the ancient problem of teaching
vs. research. Professors and stu
dents could be joined together
in an endeavor in which teach
ing and research were indistin
guishable.
To be an autonomous thinking
community a university would
have to be small.
Lord James of Rusholme has
lately proposed that universities
should be limited to three thou
sand students, that they should
be made up of small colleges,
and that when an existing uni
versity was threatened by larger
numbers, a new one should be
built across the street.
Something of this sort has
happened in Toronto. A university
of this size, organized on this
plan, would be small enough to
be a community and small
enough to get along without an
overwhelming bureaucracy.
Jaspers
When Karl Jaspers suggested
something new in Europe, a tech
nological faculty in the univer
sity, he did it for a most un-
American reason.
He explicitly did not do it be
cause he was concerned that his
country, or Europe, was falling
behind in the production of en
gineers, or because he wanted to
make the university the great
pumping heart of the industrial
system.
He did it because he wanted to
put technology in its place. He
wanted to bring it within the
circle of knowledge and not
leave it to technicians. He want
ed to subject other disciplines to
interaction with it and it to in
teraction with other disciplines.

which elsewhere are generally
assigned to other institutions
than the university. The fol

now been joined together by a
new kind of blood stream, made
up of the ideas, the trained in
telligence, and the manpower
which provide the driving en
ergy for our society.
And the university is the great
Jumping heart that keeps this
system fresh, invigorated, and in
motion."
Golly!
One is tempted to resort to
one of President Eisenhower's
more expressive utterances and
say simply "Golly!"
But such primitive sounds are
unequal to the demands of an
occasion like this, and we must
press on to more elaborate form
ulations of awe and wonder.
The objection to the great
pumping heart is not merely that

it is an example of the fallacy
of misplaced physiological con
creteness —one would have ex
pected Mr. Perkins to refer to
the brain.
The fundamental objection is
that it takes the society as given,
with all its folly and pretentious
ness, and asks the university to
supply some of the facilities,
most the hands, a lot of the en
ergy, and all of the ideas that
will enable the society to achieve
its mistaken goals.
Service Station
This is really the old service
station, refurbished, with plus
lounges, fluorescent lights, and
gaudier signs in bigger words.
Whatever the society wants
the university will do, provided
it gets the money to pay for it.
And it is not even what the so
ciety wants. It is what the most
vocal pressure groups demand.
Some light on this subjffiect
comes from an unlikely source,
the government of the United
Arab Republic.
Its official statement is, "It is
not an accepted practice for uni
versities to undertake supported
research from private organiza
tions or Government agencies.
This has safeguarded the free
dom of research and has made it
possible for the teaching staff to
devote more time to basic re
search."
The old service station ren
dered service of a kind; there is
no doubt about that. And there
is no doubt that the new one,
with its far more lavish re
sources and equipment, will ren
der more and perhaps better ser
vice of that kind.
Lose The University?
The only question is whether
we lose something in the process.
Perhaps we lose the university.
An institution is defined by its
task. Its task is defined by ask
ing what it alone can do, or what
it can do better than any other
institution.
The functions of the service
station can be • carried out by
training schools, junior colleges,
research institutes, hospitals,
commerical laboratories, experi
ment stations, or what you will.
There are services offered by
the Boy Scouts, the YMCA, pub
lic libraries, settlement houses,
city planners, and professional
athletic teams.
But the greatest service, the
service the country needs most,
cannot be performed by a service
station, no matter how modern
its facilities or how elevated its
advertising.
What the country needs most
the university, and only the uni
versity, could supply, and that
is intellectual leadership.
The university could fashion

the mind of the age. Now it is
the other way round. The de
mands of the age are fashioning
the mind, if one may use the ex
pression, of the university.
Mind Of The Age
If it is to fashion the mind of
the age and not be fashioned by
it, the university must be a cen
ter of independent thought and
criticism, an autonomous think
ing community.
If it could be that, it would
automatically rid itself of its
cannibalistic tendencies; it would
have to disgorge a vast range of
miscellaneous, irrelevant activi
ties that it has swallowed.
By disgorging the freshman
and sophomore years and limit
ing its professors and students
to those capable of independent
thought it would get rid of
many aspects of immaturity that
now confuse it and its support
ers.
It would at the same time solve
the ancient problem of teaching
vs. research. Professors and stu
dents could be joined together
in an endeavor in which teach
ing and research were indistin
guishable.
To be an autonomous thinking
community a university would
have to be small.
Lord James of Rusholme has
lately proposed that universities
should be limited to three thou
sand students, that they should
be made up of small colleges,
and that when an existing uni
versity was threatened by larger
numbers, a new one should be
built across the street.
Something of this sort has
happened in Toronto. A university
of this size, organized on this
plan, would be small enough to
be a community and small
enough to get along without an
overwhelming bureaucracy.
Jaspers
When Karl Jaspers suggested
something new in Europe, a tech
nological faculty in the univer
sity, he did it for a most un-
American reason.
He explicitly did not do it be
cause he was concerned that his
country, or Europe, was falling
behind in the production of en
gineers, or because he wanted to
make the university the great
pumping heart of the industrial
system.
He did it because he wanted to
put technology in its place. He
wanted to bring it within the
circle of knowledge and not
leave it to technicians. He want
ed to subject other disciplines to
interaction with it and it to in
teraction with other disciplines.

Second In A Series
In part one, Robert Hutchins,
President of the Center, began
his discussion of "The Issues"
by remarking that in the
United States the university is
more subject to outside control
than in other countries, and
is also given diverse tasks
which elsewhere are generally
assigned to other institutions
than the university. The fol
lowing excerpts complete
Hutchins' article.
These considerations suggest
that whereas other countries
have an idea of a university,
however inadequate, vague, or
even erroneous, we have none.
The idea of an omnium gath
erum cannot be taken seriously.
An idea enables you to tell what
is appropriate and what not,
what is to be included and what
left out.
The idea shapes the constitu
tion, the external and internal
relationships, and the activities
of the university. It holds the
place together and defines and
protects it.
All we have to do to decide
whether we have an Idea of a
university is to ask ourselves
whether there is anything imag
inable that would seem inappro
priate in an American institution
of higher learning.
I shall never forget—though I
have often tried—the last meet
ing of the Big Ten presidents I
attended, fifteen years ago.
Embarrassing
The President of the Univer
sity of Michigan said, "Say I,
want to ask you fellows, what
are we going to do about em
balming?" He went on to report
that the embalmers in his state
wanted to become a profession
for the double purpose of limit
ing competition and raising their
social standing.
This they proposed to accom
plish by establishing a school
of embalming at the University
of Michigan and requiring all
practitioners to have a degree
from the school before being
permitted to embalm any resi
dent of the state.
None of us could think of any
reason why the embalmers of
Michigan should not have their
way.
The only consolation offered
by the President of Michigan
came from the President of the
University of Minnesota, who as
sured him that the embalming
program at that great university
had not interfered with its
smooth operation.
If the President of the Univer
sity of Michigan could get no
help from us, he could fine none
either in the works of our prede
cessors or contemporaries.
The platform on which Charles
W. Eliotfi Andrew D. White,
David Starr Jordan, and Ben
jamin Ide Wheeler took their
stand was that any subject, in
terest, or activity was as good
as any other. Nothing was more
important or more trivil than
anything else.

In justice to these great and
good men, I must add that their
rhetoric may have seemed war
ranted at the time. They were
trying to break open an ancient,
narrow curriculum in order to
let science in.
But they did not foresee where
their argument would lead. In
his inaugural address in 1968
Mr. Eliot said, "It will be gen
erations before the best Ameri
can institutions will ge enough
growth to bear pruning."
But by 1905, Henry Seidel Can
by of Yale wrote, a young in
structor could look upon an
American university, this un
heard-of combination of sporting
resort, beer garden, political con
vention, laboratory, and factory
for research, with a mind as con
fused as a Spanish omelet.
And Norman Foerster could
report by 1931 that a student at
the University of Nebraska could
takes courses in early Irish, crea
tive thinking, American English,
first aid, advanced clothing, ice
cream and ices, third year
Czechoslovakian, football, sew
erage, and a man's problems in
the modern home.
Armed Truce
The most recent historian of
the American university says the
principle that any subject is as
good as another led to a kind of
armed truce among departments
and specialists—live and let live
became the slogan.
"The university," he says,
"went several different ways at
once. It crystallized into a collec
tion of divergent minds, usually
ignoring each other, commonly
talking past one another, and
periodically enjoying the illusion
of dialogue on 'safe' issues."
Even departments and schools
now seem to be loose associa
tions of professors who are
seldom, to borrow a phrase from
physics, in a solid state. They
are here today and gone tomor
row, consulting, advising, and
confering.
The situation would have de
lighted Heraclitus: you cannot
put your foot in the same uni
versity twice.
The historian I have quoted
says that what holds the place
together is bureaucracy — the
standardized practices by which
everybody has to live in order to
live at all.
But standardized practices can
not hold anything together un
less the object of the exercise is
first understood and agreed up
on. What is the object toward
which the procedures of the
American university are direct
ed?
Reply
President Pusey of Harvard
has a reply. To the question,

Is there a central dominating
idea enlivening the American
university today, he says,"The
answer is, most certainly, yes.
For such an idea is found in the
devotion to learning which per
meates the whole community
and in recognition of learning's
importance for a full manner of
life. . . . Through scholars today
often appear to pursue separate
ways within universities—quite
unaware of their colleague's exis
tence . . . —still by and large
they all are, and know they are,
working in a common vineyard.
"They know it is not their
specialities but 'learning' . . .
that they have in common. The
connecting link for all within the
university remains learning thus
understood, a compact of knowl
edge, effort, and hope."
A professor on the other side
of the tracks, at Boston Univer
sity, remained unimpressed by
the arcane union in a common
vineyard of workers unaware of
one another, indiscriminately cul
tivating grapes and thistles, and
unable, in fact, to tell one from
the other.
He spoke for many when he
said, T consider such statements
. . . falsely reassuring and deep
ly misleading in masking the
contemporary crisis in the Amer
ican multiversity."
Grape-Thistle
I gather the current answer
to the grape-thistle question is
that it is all much ado about
very little. We have decided that
all thistles are grapes, or that
a few thistles won't damage
the wine.
Mr. Pusey's vision of the vine
yard cannot match, for sheer
unrestrained lyricism, the meta
phor of President Perkins of
Cornell.
He says,"The univertiy and
the other institutions of society
—including the corporation, the
farm, the cultural center, and
the government agency — have
now been joined together by a
new kind of blood stream, made
up of the ideas, the trained in
telligence, and the manpower
which provide the driving en
ergy for our society.
And the university is the great
Jumping heart that keeps this
system fresh, invigorated, and in
motion."
Golly!
One is tempted to resort to
one of President Eisenhower's
more expressive utterances and
say simply "Golly!"
But such primitive sounds are
unequal to the demands of an
occasion like this, and we must
press on to more elaborate form
ulations of awe and wonder.
The objection to the great
pumping heart is not merely that

it is an example of the fallacy
of misplaced physiological con
creteness —one would have ex
pected Mr. Perkins to refer to
the brain.
The fundamental objection is
that it takes the society as given,
with all its folly and pretentious
ness, and asks the university to
supply some of the facilities,
most the hands, a lot of the en
ergy, and all of the ideas that
will enable the society to achieve
its mistaken goals.
Service Station
This is really the old service
station, refurbished, with plus
lounges, fluorescent lights, and
gaudier signs in bigger words.
Whatever the society wants
the university will do, provided
it gets the money to pay for it.
And it is not even what the so
ciety wants. It is what the most
vocal pressure groups demand.

The idea shapes the constitu
tion, the external and internal
relationships, and the activities
of the university. It holds the
place together and defines and
protects it.
All we have to do to decide
whether we have an Idea of a
university is to ask ourselves
whether there is anything imag
inable that would seem inappro
priate in an American institution
of higher learning.
I shall never forget—though I
have often tried—the last meet
ing of the Big Ten presidents I
attended, fifteen years ago.
Embarrassing
The President of the Univer
sity of Michigan said, "Say I,
want to ask you fellows, what
are we going to do about em
balming?" He went on to report
that the embalmers in his state
wanted to become a profession
for the double purpose of limit
ing competition and raising their
social standing.
This they proposed to accom
plish by establishing a school
of embalming at the University
of Michigan and requiring all
practitioners to have a degree
from the school before being
permitted to embalm any resi
dent of the state.
None of us could think of any
reason why the embalmers of
Michigan should not have their
way.
The only consolation offered
by the President of Michigan
came from the President of the
University of Minnesota, who as
sured him that the embalming
program at that great university
had not interfered with its
smooth operation.
If the President of the Univer
sity of Michigan could get no
help from us, he could fine none
either in the works of our prede
cessors or contemporaries.
The platform on which Charles
W. Eliotfi Andrew D. White,
David Starr Jordan, and Ben
jamin Ide Wheeler took their
stand was that any subject, in
terest, or activity was as good
as any other. Nothing was more
important or more trivil than
anything else.

In justice to these great and
good men, I must add that their
rhetoric may have seemed war
ranted at the time. They were
trying to break open an ancient,
narrow curriculum in order to
let science in.
But they did not foresee where
their argument would lead. In
his inaugural address in 1968
Mr. Eliot said, "It will be gen
erations before the best Ameri
can institutions will ge enough
growth to bear pruning."
But by 1905, Henry Seidel Can
by of Yale wrote, a young in
structor could look upon an
American university, this un
heard-of combination of sporting
resort, beer garden, political con
vention, laboratory, and factory
for research, with a mind as con
fused as a Spanish omelet.
And Norman Foerster could
report by 1931 that a student at
the University of Nebraska could
takes courses in early Irish, crea
tive thinking, American English,
first aid, advanced clothing, ice
cream and ices, third year
Czechoslovakian, football, sew
erage, and a man's problems in
the modern home.
Armed Truce
The most recent historian of
the American university says the
principle that any subject is as
good as another led to a kind of
armed truce among departments
and specialists—live and let live
became the slogan.
"The university," he says,
"went several different ways at
once. It crystallized into a collec
tion of divergent minds, usually
ignoring each other, commonly
talking past one another, and
periodically enjoying the illusion
of dialogue on 'safe' issues."
Even departments and schools
now seem to be loose associa
tions of professors who are
seldom, to borrow a phrase from
physics, in a solid state. They
are here today and gone tomor
row, consulting, advising, and
confering.
The situation would have de
lighted Heraclitus: you cannot
put your foot in the same uni
versity twice.
The historian I have quoted
says that what holds the place
together is bureaucracy — the
standardized practices by which
everybody has to live in order to
live at all.
But standardized practices can
not hold anything together un
less the object of the exercise is
first understood and agreed up
on. What is the object toward
which the procedures of the
American university are direct
ed?
Reply
President Pusey of Harvard
has a reply. To the question,

Is there a central dominating
idea enlivening the American
university today, he says,"The
answer is, most certainly, yes.
For such an idea is found in the
devotion to learning which per
meates the whole community
and in recognition of learning's
importance for a full manner of
life. . . . Through scholars today
often appear to pursue separate
ways within universities—quite
unaware of their colleague's exis
tence . . . —still by and large
they all are, and know they are,
working in a common vineyard.
"They know it is not their
specialities but 'learning' . . .
that they have in common. The
connecting link for all within the
university remains learning thus
understood, a compact of knowl
edge, effort, and hope."
A professor on the other side
of the tracks, at Boston Univer
sity, remained unimpressed by
the arcane union in a common
vineyard of workers unaware of
one another, indiscriminately cul
tivating grapes and thistles, and
unable, in fact, to tell one from
the other.
He spoke for many when he
said, T consider such statements
. . . falsely reassuring and deep
ly misleading in masking the
contemporary crisis in the Amer
ican multiversity."
Grape-Thistle
I gather the current answer
to the grape-thistle question is
that it is all much ado about
very little. We have decided that
all thistles are grapes, or that
a few thistles won't damage
the wine.
Mr. Pusey's vision of the vine
yard cannot match, for sheer
unrestrained lyricism, the meta
phor of President Perkins of
Cornell.
He says,"The univertiy and
the other institutions of society
—including the corporation, the
farm, the cultural center, and
the government agency — have
now been joined together by a
new kind of blood stream, made
up of the ideas, the trained in
telligence, and the manpower
which provide the driving en
ergy for our society.
And the university is the great
Jumping heart that keeps this
system fresh, invigorated, and in
motion."
Golly!
One is tempted to resort to
one of President Eisenhower's
more expressive utterances and
say simply "Golly!"
But such primitive sounds are
unequal to the demands of an
occasion like this, and we must
press on to more elaborate form
ulations of awe and wonder.
The objection to the great
pumping heart is not merely that

it is an example of the fallacy
of misplaced physiological con
creteness —one would have ex
pected Mr. Perkins to refer to
the brain.
The fundamental objection is
that it takes the society as given,
with all its folly and pretentious
ness, and asks the university to
supply some of the facilities,
most the hands, a lot of the en
ergy, and all of the ideas that
will enable the society to achieve
its mistaken goals.
Service Station
This is really the old service
station, refurbished, with plus
lounges, fluorescent lights, and
gaudier signs in bigger words.
Whatever the society wants
the university will do, provided
it gets the money to pay for it.
And it is not even what the so
ciety wants. It is what the most
vocal pressure groups demand.
Some light on this subjffiect
comes from an unlikely source,
the government of the United
Arab Republic.
Its official statement is, "It is
not an accepted practice for uni
versities to undertake supported
research from private organiza
tions or Government agencies.
This has safeguarded the free
dom of research and has made it
possible for the teaching staff to
devote more time to basic re
search."
The old service station ren
dered service of a kind; there is
no doubt about that. And there
is no doubt that the new one,
with its far more lavish re
sources and equipment, will ren
der more and perhaps better ser
vice of that kind.
Lose The University?
The only question is whether
we lose something in the process.
Perhaps we lose the university.
An institution is defined by its
task. Its task is defined by ask
ing what it alone can do, or what
it can do better than any other
institution.
The functions of the service
station can be • carried out by
training schools, junior colleges,
research institutes, hospitals,
commerical laboratories, experi
ment stations, or what you will.
There are services offered by
the Boy Scouts, the YMCA, pub
lic libraries, settlement houses,
city planners, and professional
athletic teams.
But the greatest service, the
service the country needs most,
cannot be performed by a service
station, no matter how modern
its facilities or how elevated its
advertising.
What the country needs most
the university, and only the uni
versity, could supply, and that
is intellectual leadership.
The university could fashion

the mind of the age. Now it is
the other way round. The de
mands of the age are fashioning
the mind, if one may use the ex
pression, of the university.
Mind Of The Age
If it is to fashion the mind of
the age and not be fashioned by
it, the university must be a cen
ter of independent thought and
criticism, an autonomous think
ing community.
If it could be that, it would
automatically rid itself of its
cannibalistic tendencies; it would
have to disgorge a vast range of
miscellaneous, irrelevant activi
ties that it has swallowed.
By disgorging the freshman
and sophomore years and limit
ing its professors and students
to those capable of independent
thought it would get rid of
many aspects of immaturity that
now confuse it and its support
ers.
It would at the same time solve
the ancient problem of teaching
vs. research. Professors and stu
dents could be joined together
in an endeavor in which teach
ing and research were indistin
guishable.
To be an autonomous thinking
community a university would
have to be small.
Lord James of Rusholme has
lately proposed that universities
should be limited to three thou
sand students, that they should
be made up of small colleges,
and that when an existing uni
versity was threatened by larger
numbers, a new one should be
built across the street.
Something of this sort has
happened in Toronto. A university
of this size, organized on this
plan, would be small enough to
be a community and small
enough to get along without an
overwhelming bureaucracy.
Jaspers
When Karl Jaspers suggested
something new in Europe, a tech
nological faculty in the univer
sity, he did it for a most un-
American reason.
He explicitly did not do it be
cause he was concerned that his
country, or Europe, was falling
behind in the production of en
gineers, or because he wanted to
make the university the great
pumping heart of the industrial
system.
He did it because he wanted to
put technology in its place. He
wanted to bring it within the
circle of knowledge and not
leave it to technicians. He want
ed to subject other disciplines to
interaction with it and it to in
teraction with other disciplines.

Perfect University," by Clark
