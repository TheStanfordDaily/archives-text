# The 						March Is On
## 
### 
Stanford students have the opportunity to
morrow to express their concern over the prob
lems now facing the University of California.
They can participate in a march on Sacramento
culminating in a confrontation with Governor
Reagan and the state's legislators.
The Berkeley protests of the last two years,
so effectively used by Reagan in his bid for
the state's highest office, were the result of a
total breakdown in communication between stu
dents, administrators, and politicians. Part of
the purpose of tomorrow's march is to insure
that such a breakdown does not take place
again now that the University is facing an even
more fundamental crisis.
The future of the University of California is
at stake. It is critical at this point for the aca
demic community to articulate its views to an
swer those of the non-educators who have dis
covered politically appealing panaceas for the
system's problems.
In mixing partisan politics with education,
Governor Reagan has menaced the University
of California's position of excellence among
public institutions of higher education in this
country. He has threatened to abolish the
University's tradition of providing an education
to all students who are academically qualified;

for many students the proposed $400 tuition
may be a critical factor in determining whether
they can continue their education. Reagan and
the Regents dismissed Clark Kerr without con
sulting essential segments of the University
community. They have undermined confidence
in the University of California and launched it
on its way to becoming just another public in
stitution.
But Reagan and the Regents have not yet ir
reversibly committed themselves. And the
State Legislature has not yet indicated that it
would endorse any plan to cut the University's
budget. There remains, therefore, some hope
that sanity can be restored to the management
of the University. The march will hopefully
tell the Governor and the legislators where the
academic community stands and initiate a
meaningful discussion among the various groups
interested in Cal's future.
The crisis at the University of California
should not only be disquieting to those whose
pocketbooks stand to be directly affected. The
present problems should interest everyone in
volved with higher education in this state. We
hope a substantial number of Stanford students
will care enough to march to the Capitol, and
demonstrate their concern in maintaining a
reputable public university system in California.
