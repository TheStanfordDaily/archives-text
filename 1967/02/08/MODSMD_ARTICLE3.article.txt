# Vietnam Peace Fast Attracts One Million
## 
### 
A 24-hour vigil organized by SANE,
AFS, and the Stanford and Berkeley
Faculty Committees for Peace in Viet
nam, will begin Friday at noon at
Grace Cathedral in San Francisco.
Brown encouraged members of the
Stanford community to participate in
the fast to the extent that they are
"psychologically" and "physically"
able. All participants interested in the
fast are invited to a meeting in Me
morial Church Vestry tomorrow at
8 p.m.
A nation-wide peace fast with an
expected participation of one million
begins this morning, timed to coincide
with the Buddhist New Year's cease
fire in Vietnam. This is a first in a
series of events planned as a result
of last week's Washington Mobiliza
tion of clergy and laymen.
Credibility Gap
Plans for the fast and a report of
the Washington meeting were out
lined last night at Memorial Church
by law and clergy members of the
Stanford community and Peninsula
area who attended the Washington
meeting. Speakers included Robert
McAfee Brown, B. Davie Napier and
Michael Novak.
Brown reported that one of the
primary goals of the nationwide mobi
lization will be to make it politically
feasible for Congressmen to represent
the concern over the war and "take
the kind of action which has up to
now seemed too risky."
Commenting on a conference with
Sen. Thomas H. Ktichel (R-Calif.) and
Rep. Tom Gubser (R-Calif.), graduate
student Clifford Brunk said that both
agreed that a substantial "credibility
gap" existed in regard to government
policy and reports of activity in Viet
nam. "However, both fended off the

question of what congressmen could
do to close that gap," Brunk said.
In addition to the peace vigil, other
recommenudations by the Washington
Mobilization include support of the
Committee of Responsibility, a group
organized by doctors across the U.S.
with plans to bring victims of napalm
bombs to the U.S- for special medical
treatment.
Brown also said that aid to civilian
victims of both North and South Viet
nam may be given through contribu
tions to the International .Red Cross.
The fast was proposed to the Com
mittee for Clergy and Laymen Con
cerned about Vietnam by a group of
St. Louis clergymen who felt a "need
for renewed sensibility to human prob
lems ... a rebirth of compassion."

Commenting on a conference with
Sen. Thomas H. Ktichel (R-Calif.) and
Rep. Tom Gubser (R-Calif.), graduate
student Clifford Brunk said that both
agreed that a substantial "credibility
gap" existed in regard to government
policy and reports of activity in Viet
nam. "However, both fended off the

question of what congressmen could
do to close that gap," Brunk said.
In addition to the peace vigil, other
recommenudations by the Washington
Mobilization include support of the
Committee of Responsibility, a group
organized by doctors across the U.S.
with plans to bring victims of napalm
bombs to the U.S- for special medical
treatment.
Brown also said that aid to civilian
victims of both North and South Viet
nam may be given through contribu
tions to the International .Red Cross.
The fast was proposed to the Com
mittee for Clergy and Laymen Con
cerned about Vietnam by a group of
St. Louis clergymen who felt a "need
for renewed sensibility to human prob
lems ... a rebirth of compassion."
A 24-hour vigil organized by SANE,
AFS, and the Stanford and Berkeley
Faculty Committees for Peace in Viet
nam, will begin Friday at noon at
Grace Cathedral in San Francisco.
Brown encouraged members of the
Stanford community to participate in
the fast to the extent that they are
"psychologically" and "physically"
able. All participants interested in the
fast are invited to a meeting in Me
morial Church Vestry tomorrow at
8 p.m.
A nation-wide peace fast with an
expected participation of one million
begins this morning, timed to coincide
with the Buddhist New Year's cease
fire in Vietnam. This is a first in a
series of events planned as a result
of last week's Washington Mobiliza
tion of clergy and laymen.
Credibility Gap
Plans for the fast and a report of
the Washington meeting were out
lined last night at Memorial Church
by law and clergy members of the
Stanford community and Peninsula
area who attended the Washington
meeting. Speakers included Robert
McAfee Brown, B. Davie Napier and
Michael Novak.
Brown reported that one of the
primary goals of the nationwide mobi
lization will be to make it politically
feasible for Congressmen to represent
the concern over the war and "take
the kind of action which has up to
now seemed too risky."
