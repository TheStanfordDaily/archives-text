## Harris Laying Egg 
### Clay L. Miller 
The hubba-hubba soft heads,
witless seers of some emetic
"New Era," who so jubilantly
honked Dave Harris into office
last spring are resting more
quietly now, and all we hear
from the government offices is
the occasional scritch of some
one attending to a flea- Their
Schubert roadshow Berkeley has
folded after mercifully few per
formances.
Dave Harris managed to scuff
and shuffle around the campus
a little bit, whining obnoxiously
about fraternities, but hell, the
prerogative of Harris-types and
political gimmick-men generally
to harass and malign their bet
ters has been implicit ever since
ego-mania. So people don't pay
much attention to that sort of
thing any more.
We do seem finally to have
netted the elusive, now-you-see
it-now-you-don't coffee house, but
all that crybaby business about
"make him gimme back my toy,
daddy, pleeeze?" on top of the
administration's pot panic
seemed more precisely designed
to degrade those personally in
volved or embarrass us as a uni
versity than to fuse us into a
united front Revolt of the Wool
gatherers.

The rent strike petered out,
rather.
The Interesting Year we were
threatened with last April and,
less excusably though just as
predictably, the government that
was supposed to spark it, have
been busts. I suggest that the
whole idiot scheme was damned
to bust from the very start be
cause Harris and his Govern
ment by Managerie, despite their
much-vaunted collective intellect,
are simply, patently and one
imagines congenitally incapable
of running a government or
much anything else toward any
predictable end whatsoever.
They live their days and nights
perched precariously on the
thinnest imaginable fringes of
sanity, taunting and baiting real
ity as though it were a secret
front for the Selective Service.
Once, pharmaceuticals for sale
cheap, in the president's own
office if need be, were going to
topple Tresidder drugstore
prices. It was a rare bird, a real
istic idea; it lasted quick. No
wonder, then, this curious freak
of an administration can't run
a government. Shucks. It can't
even run a medicine show.

whole idiot scheme was damned
to bust from the very start be
cause Harris and his Govern
ment by Managerie, despite their
much-vaunted collective intellect,
are simply, patently and one
imagines congenitally incapable
of running a government or
much anything else toward any
predictable end whatsoever.
They live their days and nights
perched precariously on the
thinnest imaginable fringes of
sanity, taunting and baiting real
ity as though it were a secret
front for the Selective Service.
Once, pharmaceuticals for sale
cheap, in the president's own
office if need be, were going to
topple Tresidder drugstore
prices. It was a rare bird, a real
istic idea; it lasted quick. No
wonder, then, this curious freak
of an administration can't run
a government. Shucks. It can't
even run a medicine show.
The hubba-hubba soft heads,
witless seers of some emetic
"New Era," who so jubilantly
honked Dave Harris into office
last spring are resting more
quietly now, and all we hear
from the government offices is
the occasional scritch of some
one attending to a flea- Their
Schubert roadshow Berkeley has
folded after mercifully few per
formances.
Dave Harris managed to scuff
and shuffle around the campus
a little bit, whining obnoxiously
about fraternities, but hell, the
prerogative of Harris-types and
political gimmick-men generally
to harass and malign their bet
ters has been implicit ever since
ego-mania. So people don't pay
much attention to that sort of
thing any more.
We do seem finally to have
netted the elusive, now-you-see
it-now-you-don't coffee house, but
all that crybaby business about
"make him gimme back my toy,
daddy, pleeeze?" on top of the
administration's pot panic
seemed more precisely designed
to degrade those personally in
volved or embarrass us as a uni
versity than to fuse us into a
united front Revolt of the Wool
gatherers.

The rent strike petered out,
rather.
The Interesting Year we were
threatened with last April and,
less excusably though just as
predictably, the government that
was supposed to spark it, have
been busts. I suggest that the
whole idiot scheme was damned
to bust from the very start be

ment by Managerie, despite their
