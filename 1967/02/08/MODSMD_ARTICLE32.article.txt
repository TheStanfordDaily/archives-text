## Greek Week: Meaning Of 'Relevant' 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
The Daily's February 7 edi
torial, "The Same New Look"
demonstrates a basic misconcep
tion common to many new left
activists and antifraternity think
ers.
My criticism is that the editor
assumes a chariot race to be ir
relevant to the university com
munity. Here he falls into the
same trap that has caught many
activists: Namely the belief that
a university is a place solely for
serious academic inquiry, for
serious social service, and for a
gathering of maturity. I believe
that a university does not serve
these functions alone but must
also allow ungrudgingly periodic,
pure ridiculous fun making —
spontaneous expression of glori
ous immaturity.
Certainly anyone who advo
cates that chariot races and all
present fraternity traditions are
totally irrelevant to the univer
sity is taking himself much too
seriously in the role of a new
left editor. He himself has be
come as ridiculous as the frater
nity members who hope to pre
sent a new look by planting six
trees at the library.
My point, then, is that the edi
tor has been too hasty in using
the spectacle of Greek Week as
basis for condemnation of pro
gress towards a new look for
fraternities. Why should the
Greek Week present a new
look? Why should it not be
merely "fraternity oriented fun
and games"? Why cannot the
new look come on a much wider
basis that does not exclude fun
and games but makes such ac
tivities a smaller part of a much
larger and better life?
The editor has been too strict

in his consideration of what is
relevant to a university. Let us
not think ourselves so sophisti
cated, scholarly, and mature that
we must look down on those who
are not continually mulling
world problems, on those who
enjoy an occasional run in the
sun.

• Cheers
Editor, The Daily:
In response to your editorial,
"We're Only No. 2," I am re
minded of a saying: "The three
things dearest to a man's heart
are his parking space, his dog
and his family"—in that order.

• Honor?
Editor, The Daily:
During the past year I have
been proud to attend a school
where the students actually
abide by the Honor Code (i.e.,
the Fundamental Standard).
This seems especially so when
taking exams as I personally
have never seen a breach of the
Code in a test room.
However, I have lost a little
confidence in the strength of
the Fundamental Standard when
receiving my lost wallet through
the mail, I discovered that the
returner had kept all of the
"green stuff" for himself. The
actual amount is unimportant
(although it must have seemed
quite sufficient for him), but the
realization that is was done up
sets me.

I suppose this sounds like a
cynical letter, but unfortunately
it seems necessary and more ap
propriate that this be a threat
ening one. The two Stanford stu
dents who took the wallet from
the stand have both been iden
tified and to avoid their names
being submitted to the Judicial
Council or the police department
I would greatly appreciate the
receipt of the wallet's contents in
full! (Perhaps through the
mail.) Thank you.

• Draft
Editor, The Dally:
I do not know who is respon
sible for the inaccuracy in yes
terday's Daily saying that the
Stanford Young Republicans
stand opposed to the draft—they
do not. We would hope that in
the best of all possible worlds
the draft could be ended and our
military manpower needs sat
isfied by an all-vounteer army.
But in view of our present mili
tary commitments—specifically
the war in Vietnam, which we
generally support—military con
scription in some form is neces
sary and we therefore support
it. That is the stand of the
Stanford Young Republicans.
As another Stanford delegate
to the state convention, I can as
sure you that John Lucas's
amendment you refer to was an
attempt—and a successful one—
to tone down an intemperate
clause in the proposed platform
condemning the draft in sweep
ing terms. In fact—and I can
assure you of the veracity of this
because I drafted the original
resolution—Stanford introduced

a resolution which was over
whelmingly passed by the con
vention supporting and urging
cooperation with military con
scription in times of national
need—such as now, with the war
in Vietnam (the present war in
Vietnam was referred to by
name as such a case of national
need in the resolution passed by
the convention).

• And More Draft
Your article on student dis
content with the draft com
pletely distorts my position and
that of the Stanford Young Re
publicans. I did introduce an
amendment to the platform to
replace an intemperate denunci
ation of the draft which recog
nized no right to conscription
Under any circumstances and re
ferred to the U.S. armed forces
as an "army of slaves." The pur
pose of my amendment was to
put the Young Republicans on
record supporting the employ
ment of conscription "in clear
cases of national need," a posi
tion you manage to contradict
by excluding this crucial pass
age while quoting from the
phrases immediately preceding
and following it.
I regard conscription as a di
minution of individual liberty
and do favor its replacement by
a volunteer army. But freedom
can never be an absolute and
must sometimes be abridged by
society in some of its particu
lars if it is to be preserved in
the whole. The first task of gov
ernment is the defense of the

nation from external threat; to
do this it must raise and main
tain an army sufficient to meet
all possible challenges over long
periods of time without destroy
ing the vitality of its social and
economic fabric. To be forced
to rely solely on volunteers
would greatly hamper its ability
to perform this task effectively
and the cost of such an army,
employing "bounties" of exces
sively high salaries to compen
sate for the risk to life in war
time, might cause severe eco
nomic dislocation that would
impair the country's ability to
meet subsequent future chal
lenges. Whether Vietnam repre
sents such a case of clear na
tional need is debatable. I frank
ly think it does; but I would like
to see a more serious attempt
made to raise the army volun
tarily, and believe that conscrip
tion can and should be aband
oned when the current war sit
uation is ended.
Thank you,
