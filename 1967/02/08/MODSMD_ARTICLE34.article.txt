STAMP OUT YOUNG LOVE
It happens every day. A young man goes off to college,
leaving his home town sweetheart with vows of eternal
love, and then he finds that he has outgrown her. What, in
such cases, is the honorable thing to do?
Well sir, you can do what Crunch Sigafoos did.

When Crunch left his home in Cut and Shoot, Pa., to go
off to a prominent midwestern university ( Florida State)
he said to his sweetheart, a wholesome country lass named
Mildred Bovine, "My dear, though I am far away in col
lege, I will love you always. I take a mighty oath I will
never look at another girl. If I do, may my eyeballs parch
and wither, may my viscera writhe like adders, may my
ever-press slacks go baggy!"
Then he clutched Mildred to his bosom, flicked some
hayseed from her hair, planted a final kiss upon her fra
grant young skull, and went away, meaning with all his
heart to be faithful.
But on the very first day of college he met a coed named
Irmgard Champerty who was studded with culture like a
ham with cloves. She knew verbatim the complete works
of Franz Kafka, she sang solos in stereo, she wore a black
leather jacket with an original Goya on the back.
Well sir, Crunch took one look and his jaw dropped and
his nostrils pulsed like a bellows and his kneecaps turned
to sorghum. Never had he beheld such sophistication, such
intellect, such savoir faire. Not, mind you, that Crunch
was a dolt. He was, to be sure, a country boy, but he had a
head on his shoulders, believe you me! Take, for instance,
his choice of razor blades. Crunch always shaved with
Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades, and if that doesn't
show good sense, I am Rex the Wonder Horse. No other
blade shaves you so comfortably so often. No other blade
brings you such facial felicity, such epidermal elan.
Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades take the travail out
of shaving, scrap the scrape, negate the nick, peel the pull,
oust the ouch. Furthermore, Personnas are available both
in double-edge style and in injector style. If you're smart
—and I'm sure you are, or how'd you get out of high school
—you'll get a pack of Personnas before another sun has set.
But I digress. Crunch, as we have seen, was instantly
smitten with Irmgard Champerty. All day he followed her
around campus and listened to her talk about Franz Kafka
and like that, and then be went back to his dormitory and
found this letter from his home town sweetheart Mildred:
Dear Crunch:
Us kids had a keen time yesterday. We vent down to
the pond and caught some frogs. I caught the most of
anybody. Then we hitched rides on trucks and did lots
of nutsy stuff like that. Well, I must close now because I
got to whitewash the fence.
Your friend,
Mildred
P.S 1 know hoiv to ride backwards on my skateboard.
Well sir, Crunch thought about Mildred and then he
thought about Irmgard and then a great sadness fell upon
him. Suddenly he knew he had outgrown young, innocent
Mildred; his heart now belonged to smart, sophisticated
Irmgard.
Being above all things honorable, he returned forth
with to Cut and Shoot, Pa., and looked Mildred straight in
the eye and said manlily, "I do not love you any more. I
love another. You can hit me in the stomach all your might
if you want to!'
"That's okay, hey!' said Mildred amiably. "I don't love
you neither. I found a new boy."
"What is his name?" asked Crunch.
"Franz Kafka!' said Mildred.
"I hope you will be very happy," said Crunch and shook
Mildred's hand and they have remained good friends to
this day. In fact, Crunch and Irmgard often double-date
with Franz and Mildred and have barrels of fun. Franz
knows how to ride backwards on his skateboard one-legged.

So you see, all's well that ends well—including a shave
with Personna Super Stainless Steel Itlades and
I'ersonna's partner in luxury shaving—lturma-Shave. It
comes in menthol or regular; it soaks rings around any
o her lather.
