# Third Fraternity Unit To Open In Fall '68
## 
### JAY BOSWORTH 
The third fraternity cluster, to be
located on Campus Drive next to the
Cowell Student Health Center, is
scheduled for occupancy by Septem
ber, 1968, according to Robert Sum
mers, Director of Fraternities.
Plans are back from architects Er
nest J. Kump Associates for final ap
proval by the University and the in
dividual fraternities: Dekes, Fijis, Chi
Psis, ATO's, and Alpha Sigs. The
cluster should be submitted to a bid
late in March and construction will
begin in May or June.
Individual Latitude
Planning the new cluster has in
volved many site revisions. The pres
ent is the seventh in a series of over
all plans. Individual fraternities have
been allowed considerable latitude in
the design of the interiors of their
respective houses.
Each hired its own interior decora
tor and offered suggestions for the
layout of social, recreational, and
study areas. Underlying principle in
the drafting of the plans has been a
concern to meet the needs and de
sires of the fraternities, according to
a University spokesman.
Initial position in the cluster was
determined by a draw. The fraterni
ties chosen to occupy the group have
sufficient money pledged to provide
approximately half of the estimated
cost of $550,000 per house.
Faculty Protest
A protest by faculty members with
homes adjacent to the proposed site
on Mayfield Avenue and Lane C re
sulted in one of the major revisions
of the cluster. They had expressed
concern over the road layout, which
would have brought fraternity traf
fic near their homes.
Subsequent plans provide for a new
road to be called Bowdoin Street to
run perpendicular to Mayfield Avenue
and a landscaped buffer zone between
the fraternities and the faculty.
The new houses have considerable
flexibility. Living areas are separated
from social, recreational, and dining
areas in all five houses. Two-room
suites for two men will predominate,
but three room suites for four and
singles will also be included.
Old Row Dilapidated
The first fraternity cluster for Kap
pa Sigma, SAE, Theta Delta Chi, and
Phi Delta Theta was completed in
1962. The second for Alpha Delta Phi,
Zeta Psi, Lambda Nu, and Kappa
Alpha was finished in 1963.

These replaced the row-type houses
which since World War II had dilapi
dated to a degree beyond the financial
capabilities of the individual fra
ternities. (When the old Zete house
was remodeled for the I-Center, the
price came to over $150,000.)
After an intensive study by stu
dents, faculty, and administration and
a change in the requirements for gov
ernment loans, the cluster program
was initiated.
Alumni Contributions
The original concept was the brain
child of John Carl Warnecke and pro
vided for arrangement of four or five
fraternity houses into "clusters" em
ploying study-bedroom suites and
separate libraries and lounges but one
central kitchen.
This last proposal was abandoned
before the final draft of the first clus
ter. The University provided half of
the cost of each of the houses through
loans from the Housing and Urban
Development Agency. Fraternities
raised the other half from alumni
contributions.
For tax purposes it was necessary
for the University to own the houses.
The fraternity does not lease a house
but occupies the building on the basis
of a letter of agreement.

For aesthetics and architectural
reasons, the mony was lumped to
gether and the houses built as one
"project." The total money invested
in the three clusters will be between
five and six million dollars and dem
onstrates the University's commit
ment to the fraternity principle as
one type of men's housing.
The only source of revenue for
each of the houses in any of the clus
ters is that which it can generate it
self. Since each has to pay off its own
portion of the University debt, large
portions of members' house bills are
allocated to a building fund. The
University collects about $21,000 a
year from the cluster houses.
The future is somewhat hazy for
the eventual location of the other
eleven row houses. Present plans call
for the abrogation of all old, inade
quate houses within the next ten or
fifteen years.
The actual form of any new fra
ternity construction is dependent
upon the report of the definitive
Packer study on education at Stan
ford. The order of movement out of
the old houses depends upon which
fraternities raise the necessary funds
and which are most in need of new
housing.
