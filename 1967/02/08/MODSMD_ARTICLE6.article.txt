# Student Demands End 'Repose'
## 
### PAT McMAHON (Last in a series) 
Stanford today is "absolutely dif
ferent" from what it was at the time
of the Study of Undergraduate Edu
cation (SUE) ten years ago, noted
Hubert Marshall, professor of politi
cal science, and co-author of the
Hoopes and Marshall report on the
findings of SUE.
Describing Stanford of the early
and middle '50s Marshall said yester
day that the campus was in a "state
of repose." He explained that there
was no insistence for curriculum re
form nor was there any unified
demands, but individual students
would occasionally write letters to
The Daily discussing dissatisfaction.
The SUE report and results came
after a two year study and evalua
tion of the undergraduate program.
It was financed by the Ford and Car
negie foundations and was hailed by
the faculty and students as the first
serious stride Stanford had made to

ward providing a true liberal educa
tion.
Department Ratings
Part of the report included a sur
vey of the graduating class. "It was
not until we asked them for their
ideas and opinions that we got any
response from them," recalled Mar
shall.
The poll rated Stanford professors,
departments, and categories. The sen
iors rated their instructors "good" or
"excellent" in 57 per cent of the cases,
and "fair" or "poor", 43 per cent.
In department ratings, history and
the honors humanities programs were
rated very highly. Art and architech
ture, biology, German, music, philos
ophy, and physics departments were
rated among the highest. On the other
end of the ranking were military and
air sciences departments.
In Praise Of Liberal Arts
When the report was accepted by
the Academic Council and released,
the February 9, 1956 Daily editorial

said, "We are proud to be enrolled
in a forward-looking University."
The Daily also expressed the views
of many other students in a roundup
of opinion on the study and the liberal
arts tradition. Students were asked
"Do you believe the increased liberal
arts emphasis in the new undergrad
uate study will be of greater bene
fit to the student in his future life
than the present plan?"
A Branner sponsor, Joanne Cud
dihy, said, "In this world right now.
to really develop your interests and
talents completely, it is necessary to
have a smattering of education in all
these fields. If you are curious and
therefore subject to education, you
want to know about them anyway."
Initiative From President
A Roble freshman however noted
that, "I don't think students should
have to spend time in studying things
which aren't absolutely necessary for
getting a job. Whether or not they
study other subjects should be left
up to the individual student."
Professor Marshall however points
out the differences between the stu
dent of then and today. There were no
"oragnized and consistent demands,"
and there could be no election to stu
dent body presidency on a platform
of educational reform.
The initiative for SUE came for the
most part from the President's Office,
Marshall recalls. The barriers to
change before that time were consid
ered too foreboding.
Continual Critics
Students are "continual critics" to
day, Marshall said, but he emphasized

that they shouldn't have the right to
dictate curriculum.
Since the report of SUE, the Over
seas Campus Program has developed
and a comprehensive survey of the
freshman year was completed. Now,
the focus of educational review cen
ters around the new Packer Commit
tee, its selection, agnda, and goals.
