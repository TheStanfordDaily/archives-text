# Steering Comm Named-Students Protest
## Students Charge Denial Of Rights 
### GEOFFREY STEVENS 
At a noon rally held yesterday in White Plaza, student
speakers, including Student Body President Dave Harris,
exhorted students to commit themselves in a struggle for
student power.
The rally ended just a few hours before the University
released the names of the newly selected members of the
Packer Committee, which will undertake a comprehensive
review of Stanford education.
The selection of the three student members of the
Packer Committee has been challenged by LASSU, since
no elected student representatives were given an official
voice in th selection process. Both Tom Forstenzer, LASSU
Speaker, and Dave Harris have condemned the Packer
Committee for denying students the right to choose their
own representatives.
Whitewash
At the rally, which was sponsored by the Stanford chap
ter of Students for a Democratic Society, Harris termed
the Packer Committee "a sophisticated whitewash" because
the administrators still view themselves and not the stu
dents as the owners of the University. He compared the
students on the Packer Committee to "errand boys" who
serve because the Administration lets them serve.
Answering complaints that he hasn't done anything,
Harris said he couldn't change Stanford by himself, and
that unless students were willing to organize and put
"their bodies on the line," nothing will be done.
"This university can't run without students," argued
Harris as he called upon students to recognize their col
lective power. He urged women to exercise their power
by moving off campus, and urged all students to refuse to
recognize or serve on the Packer
Committee.

Harris later told The Dally that he
plans to speak to students in their
living groups with the hope of or
ganizing opposition to complete ad
ministrative control of Stanford.
Political Party
Joe Reich, another speaker at yes
terdays rally, talked about building
a student political party. He asked in
terested students to call him at El Cap
itan eating club during lunch or din
ner.
Other speakers at the rally dis
cussed issues other than local ones.
Leonard Siegel stated eight demands
of SDS, calling for tuition-free educa
tion at Cal, student-faculty control
of academic affairs, and repeal of on
campus speaking restrictions.
SDS is supporting Saturday's march
on Sacramento and can arrange rides
for Stanford students needing trans
portation, according to Siegel. The pur
pose of the march is to demonstrate
the unity of the academic community
in opposing proposed policy changes
for the University of California, he
said.
Comment On Kerr
English TA Bob Haas said during
the rally that "the people of Cali
fornia don't want a great university
because a great university is critical
of society." Expressing no regret over
the recent firing of Clark Kerr, Haas
called Kerr an "establishment liberal"
who believes in teaching students only
"instrumental values "
The final speaker Ira Arlook, an
organizer of The Experiment, gave de
tails of Stanford's relationship with
the "military-industrial complex." Ar
look mentioned that many Trustees
head corporations which receive large
defense contracts, and that SRI has
done research in chemical warfare.
Concluding, he stated that personal
commitment on the part of each stu
dent is necessary to effect change in
Stanford's tacit but substantial sup
port of the war in Vietnam.

pose of the march is to demonstrate
the unity of the academic community
in opposing proposed policy changes
for the University of California, he
said.
Comment On Kerr
English TA Bob Haas said during
the rally that "the people of Cali
fornia don't want a great university
because a great university is critical
of society." Expressing no regret over
the recent firing of Clark Kerr, Haas
called Kerr an "establishment liberal"
who believes in teaching students only
"instrumental values "
The final speaker Ira Arlook, an
organizer of The Experiment, gave de
tails of Stanford's relationship with
the "military-industrial complex." Ar
look mentioned that many Trustees
head corporations which receive large
defense contracts, and that SRI has
done research in chemical warfare.
Concluding, he stated that personal
commitment on the part of each stu
dent is necessary to effect change in
Stanford's tacit but substantial sup
port of the war in Vietnam.

At a noon rally held yesterday in White Plaza, student
speakers, including Student Body President Dave Harris,
exhorted students to commit themselves in a struggle for
student power.
The rally ended just a few hours before the University
released the names of the newly selected members of the
Packer Committee, which will undertake a comprehensive
review of Stanford education.
The selection of the three student members of the
Packer Committee has been challenged by LASSU, since
no elected student representatives were given an official
voice in th selection process. Both Tom Forstenzer, LASSU
Speaker, and Dave Harris have condemned the Packer
Committee for denying students the right to choose their
own representatives.
Whitewash
At the rally, which was sponsored by the Stanford chap
ter of Students for a Democratic Society, Harris termed
the Packer Committee "a sophisticated whitewash" because
the administrators still view themselves and not the stu
dents as the owners of the University. He compared the
students on the Packer Committee to "errand boys" who
serve because the Administration lets them serve.
Answering complaints that he hasn't done anything,
Harris said he couldn't change Stanford by himself, and
that unless students were willing to organize and put
"their bodies on the line," nothing will be done.
"This university can't run without students," argued
Harris as he called upon students to recognize their col
lective power. He urged women to exercise their power
by moving off campus, and urged all students to refuse to
recognize or serve on the Packer
Committee.

Harris later told The Dally that he
plans to speak to students in their
living groups with the hope of or
ganizing opposition to complete ad
ministrative control of Stanford.
Political Party
Joe Reich, another speaker at yes
terdays rally, talked about building
a student political party. He asked in
terested students to call him at El Cap
itan eating club during lunch or din
ner.
Other speakers at the rally dis
cussed issues other than local ones.
Leonard Siegel stated eight demands
of SDS, calling for tuition-free educa
tion at Cal, student-faculty control
of academic affairs, and repeal of on
campus speaking restrictions.
SDS is supporting Saturday's march
on Sacramento and can arrange rides
for Stanford students needing trans
portation, according to Siegel. The pur
pose of the march is to demonstrate
the unity of the academic community
in opposing proposed policy changes
for the University of California, he
said.
