# Eight To Direct Education Study
## 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
Five professors and three students were named yester
day to the Steering Committee for the upcoming Study of
Undergraduate Education.
The professors are: James F. Gibbons, Electrical Engi
neering; Albert Hastorf, Chairman of the Pyschology De
partment; Joshua Lederberg, Nobel Prize winner in ge
netics; Mark Mancall, History, head of The Grove Project;
and Leonard Schiff, Physics, winner of Dinkelspiel Award
as top undergraduate teacher.
Student members include: Norton Batkin, a sophomore
philosophy major; Michael Menke, a graduate student in
Physics, and Anne Osborn, a first year medical student.
Batkin was chosen last year's outstanding Freshman
male by the Alumni Association, and is a member of
Lambda Nu. Menke was a Churchill Scholar at Churchill
College in Cambridge, England, and is presently a tutor in
Cedro and a member of The Experiment. Miss Osborn, who
is a Woodrow Wilson and National Science Foundation fel
low, received last year's Dinkelspiel Award as the outstand
ing woman in the graduating class.
Objective Scrutiny
In announcing the appointments, President Wallace Ster
ling noted "the members were not chosen for their capacity
to 'represent' any interests or constituencies. They speak
for themselves as members of the Stanford community who
in my judgment share a concern for the future of the
University, a high order of creative and critical intelligence,
and the capacity to bring an objective scrutiny to bear on
the many important problems that will come before them,"
Considerable controversy surrounds the appointment of
students. The Legislature last month circulated a petition

asking that the selections be made by
a committee of two administators and
two students. Vice-Provost Herbert
Packer, however, maintained that "the
qualities of interest, talent and critical
intelligence that we want in the stu
dent members is not to be determined
by a majority vote."
All student applicants for the com
mittee submitted a statement of pers
onal qualifications and of problems
they identified as important to the re
view.
Year-Long Programs
In his statement Batkin proposed
implementation of an education plan
similar to those used at Oxford and
the University of London involving
year-long seminars and lecture pro
grams and culminating with compre
hensive exams in the undergraduate's
major field. He also stresses the im
portance of reevaluating grades, hous
ing programs and library facilities.
Batkin notes that his concept of edu
cation may "impose more of a burden
on the student than I believe Stanford
thinks he can accept."
Menke, who received his undergrad
uate degree from Princeton, wrote, "I
would like to strengthen education as
a development of critical, questioning
attitudes as opposed to the production
of experts in limited areas. I would
like to strengthen the role of experts
in limited areas. I would like to streng
then the role of education as a source
of constructive criticism of our cul
ture."
He stressed improving education "as
a responsible exercise of Individual
freedom" and also proposed "some
cohesive program of activities com
bining social and cultural enjoyment,
of which I offer wine tasting as an ex
ample new to this campus."
Housing
In her letter, Miss Osborn remarks
that the move for women's off-campus
living "may be protesting not the lo
cation of housing, but the kind of
housing available." She suggests mak
ing the conditions of off-campus living
available on the campus.
"I think one of the Committee's
greatest difficulties may come not in
finding answers to problems, but in
fonnulating the questions them
selves."
The Steering Committee, headed by
Vice-Provost Packer, will be the cen
tral organizing unit for the study.
Packer, however, feels that the whole
university community must be involv
ed for the study to be successful. There
will be a wide range of committees
established to study specific issues, he
said.
At present, the Committee will con
centrate on forming an agenda.
