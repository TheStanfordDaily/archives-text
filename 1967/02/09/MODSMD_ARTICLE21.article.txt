# Judicial Responsibility

### 
'(• Judicial Council is presently under no obli
\ gation to make public any of its proceedings or
'»decisions. Tonight Legislature will consider a
j bill requiring detailed reports of all judicial
'.cases, omitting the names of the people involved.
' Until last year an obscure by-law in the ASSU
'constitution read as follows: The Judicial Coun
•cil shall submit to the Fundamental Standard
and Honor Code Commission (FSHCC) detailed
reports of cases heard by the Judicial Coun
cils. All names or incidents which would clearly
identify the names of the individuals involved
would be omitted. The by-law further stated
that the FSHCC should summarize the reports
and submit them to The Daily for bi-monthly
publication. The by-law became invalid last
when the FSHCC was abolished.
Judicial Council is in the ambiguous position
of having to fulfill a responsibility both to the
public and to its defendants. On one hand, it
must keep the community informed of how it
interprets the Fundamental Standard. At the
_same time it must protect the defendants and
guarantee their anonymity. The conflict inherent
in this dual responsibility is not irreconcilable;
both obligations must be met if the Council is
to be a rehabilitative and an educative body,
rather than just a punitive one.
Provisions should be made for the Judicial
Council to prepare detailed reports of its ac
tions, as was stipulated in the old by-law. Stu
dents should be aware of the manner in which

cases have been handled so that they can have
an idea of how the body functions. We are not
suggesting that the Council should operate ac
cording to precedent, but only that the public
should be aware of both trends and inequities.
Personal privacy will still be maintained as long
as the Council insures that neither names nor
information clearly leading to revelation of
names be made public.
The Judicial Council derives its authority from
Legislature and has a responsibility to that body.
LASSU, which is entrusted with final interpreta
tion of the Fundamental Standard, should know
how that Standard is being applied.
Some members of Judicial Council have
suggested that it would be best for them simply
to report only on cases they deem of interest to
the community. This would, in effect, deny stu
dents the guarantee that the Council would re
veal all matters of general interest. The Coun
cil has also expressed its concern that publica
tion of decisions might result in distortion of the
facts. On the contrary, so far it has usually been
under circumstances in which straightforward
information has not been available that false
information has been circulated.
Students must know how their judicial system
is functioning, and how it is interpreting the
Fundamental Standard. Keeping the community
informed will also be a major step toward instill
ing some respect for the Fundamental Standard,
a respect which is presently sadly lacking.

'(• Judicial Council is presently under no obli
\ gation to make public any of its proceedings or

j bill requiring detailed reports of all judicial
'.cases, omitting the names of the people involved.
' Until last year an obscure by-law in the ASSU
'constitution read as follows: The Judicial Coun
•cil shall submit to the Fundamental Standard
and Honor Code Commission (FSHCC) detailed
reports of cases heard by the Judicial Coun
cils. All names or incidents which would clearly
identify the names of the individuals involved
would be omitted. The by-law further stated
that the FSHCC should summarize the reports
and submit them to The Daily for bi-monthly
publication. The by-law became invalid last
when the FSHCC was abolished.
Judicial Council is in the ambiguous position
of having to fulfill a responsibility both to the
public and to its defendants. On one hand, it
must keep the community informed of how it
interprets the Fundamental Standard. At the
_same time it must protect the defendants and
guarantee their anonymity. The conflict inherent
in this dual responsibility is not irreconcilable;
both obligations must be met if the Council is
to be a rehabilitative and an educative body,
rather than just a punitive one.
Provisions should be made for the Judicial
Council to prepare detailed reports of its ac
tions, as was stipulated in the old by-law. Stu
dents should be aware of the manner in which

cases have been handled so that they can have
an idea of how the body functions. We are not
suggesting that the Council should operate ac
cording to precedent, but only that the public
should be aware of both trends and inequities.
Personal privacy will still be maintained as long
as the Council insures that neither names nor
information clearly leading to revelation of
names be made public.
The Judicial Council derives its authority from
Legislature and has a responsibility to that body.
LASSU, which is entrusted with final interpreta
tion of the Fundamental Standard, should know
how that Standard is being applied.
Some members of Judicial Council have
suggested that it would be best for them simply
to report only on cases they deem of interest to
the community. This would, in effect, deny stu
dents the guarantee that the Council would re
veal all matters of general interest. The Coun
cil has also expressed its concern that publica
tion of decisions might result in distortion of the
facts. On the contrary, so far it has usually been
under circumstances in which straightforward
information has not been available that false
information has been circulated.
Students must know how their judicial system
is functioning, and how it is interpreting the
Fundamental Standard. Keeping the community
informed will also be a major step toward instill
ing some respect for the Fundamental Standard,
