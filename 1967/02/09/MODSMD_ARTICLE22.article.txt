## Whodunit Story On Smog: It's Always The Next Guy 
### Art Buchwald 
President Johnson came out
against air pollution this week,
and it was hard for even the
Republicans to attack him on it.
This country may be divided on
many things, but it seems to be
in almost total agreement that it
is against air pollution. Where
everyone parts company is when
you try to place the blame on
those suspected of causing it-
The other day I went around
New York City talking to peo
ple who may or may not have
something to do with poisoning
the air.
"It certainly isn't us," said the
director of a utilities company.
"Why, the fuel we burn could
hardly cause an ounce of pollu
tion. We get all the blame be
cause everyone can see our
smokestacks, but do you know
what comes out of those smoke
stacks?"
"What?" I asked.
New Jersey At Fault
"Good, clean by-products. I
breathe it every day. If you ask
me, it's those refineries over
there in New Jersey that are
causing all the air pollution
around here."
I went over to New Jersey to
talk to a refinery executive.
"It's typical of people in New
York to blame New Jersey for
their troubles. We have tests to
prove that we're responsible for
less than .005 per cent of the air
pollution in the area. You won't
find bettor air than that right
here at the refinery. If you
want to know the real cause of
air pollution, go over to the
garbage dumps. That's where
they're making all the smog."
I drove over to a large gar
bage dump located in a swamp.
The man in charge was indig
nant when I said he was sus
pected of polluting the air.
Not Garbage
"We only burn garbage twice
a day,"he said angrily, "and
most of the smoke blows out to
sea. Heck, we've been burning
garbage for years, and no one
has complained before. You
know what I think is causing all
the air pollution? Those damn
automobiles. You watch the

fumes come out of the exhaust
of a car, and you know where
the poison's coming from."
I went back to New York to
talk to a representative of the
auto industry, who retorted,
"They're blaming the automobile
for everything these days. We're
becoming the patsy of the United
States. Pretty soon it will be our
fault that we're in Vietnam. Let
me tell you something. The auto
mobile is clean, as clean as we
can make it, and anyone who
says differently is trying to hurt
the economy of this country. Be
sides, it isn't automobiles that
are spewing out all that filth. It's
diesel engines on buses and
trucks. They do all the damage,
and the automobile gets all the
blame."
Not Buses Either
I was directed to a spokesman
for the trucking and bus indus
try.
"Lies, all lies," he said. "One
chemical factory makes more
smog in an hour than all our
trucks and buses make in a
week. Go visit oiie and see for
yourself."
I took a ride over to a chem
ical factory.
"It isn't us. It's the steel peo
ple. I have a sample here of
polluted air. It comes directly
from a foundry. Whatever you
see coming out of our chimneys
actually purifies the air."
The steel people told me the
real cause of air pollution was
the airplanes taking off and land
ing at La Guardia Field. And
the airplane people told me the
railroads around New York
caused most of the smog.
By this time I was coughing
pretty hard, and I wasn't too
sure that I wanted to pursue the
subject, so I decided to stop into
a large hospital for an E-ray.
As I walked toward it I noticed
three chimneys in the back of
the hospital spewing out large
amounts of black smoke.
I mentioned this to the doctor
who was examining me.
"Yes," he said, "that's our pow
erhouse. We need it to treat
our patients who are suffering
from polluted air."
