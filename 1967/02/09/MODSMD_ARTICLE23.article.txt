# Letters To The Editor
## Republican Views Variegated 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
I felt that your article in the
February 6 Daily on student sen
timent toward the draft was a
fairly accurate assessment of
student opinion, and I was very
sorry to read in the February 8
issue two letters to the editor
which, purporting to represent
the views of the Stanford Area
Young Republicans, implicitly
challenged the theme of your
article.
Mr. Clarke, in his letter, went
one step further in his com
mentary on the draft by assert
ing that the Stanford Young Re
publicans generally support the
Government's effort in Viet
nam. I afraid that the ambiguity
of the adverb "generally" ob
scures the accuracy of his state
ment.
In order that the Stanford
community be aware of the wide
spectrum of opinion on the Viet
nam war among Republicans at
Stanford, I think that in all fair
ness you should print the en
closed article, "Vietnam and the
Diplomatic Offensive," which I
wrote under a pseudonym for
the Stanford Republican.

allow us to reprint the article.

ford Republican of November

• Be Hairful
Editor, The Daily:
I applaud the editor for his
brave statement, "The Same
New Look." I only hope he does

not awake to find that his head
has been shaved.

• Let Us Laugh
Editor, The Daily:
No, The Chariot Race was not
a super contribution to the Uni
versity. I mean, not like all the
other fantastic, intellectual, real
ly serious stuff that goes on.
All of us, of course, are not
made of that drive which pushes
ever forward in valient efforts
to solve the World and its Prob
lems. Some of us laugh, though
perhaps not as heroically or pro
foundly as we might, while the
great strong ones do What Must
Be Done.
Alas, I'm only a Laugher. But
why must I justify anything to
you, sir? Who are you to ques
tion my "anachronistic tradi
tions"? Who are you to deter
mine my legitimacy in the uni
versity? You do not even know
me.
Oh, would that I were as
strong and sure as you. How
wonderfully intense, how serious
you must be. Pay no attention
to the jingle in the wind, Ozy
mandias, it is only one poor soul
laughing at another.

• Defensive
Editor, The Dally:
In the latest issue of Commit
ment, Ira Arlook again brings
up the subject of defense con
tracts and the University. He
makes judgments which are com
pletely unjustified and which dis

play the typical ignorance or
misinformation which has char
acterized similar attacks in the
past.
A basic premise in Mr. Ar
look's article is that any research
connected with defense or the
"military-industrial complex" is
automatically not "lively or
creative." He insults the intel
ligence of many professors and
students with this remark.
Many non-science oriented stu
dents simply do not understand
that whole areas of challenging
research have opened up with de
fense needs, and much is done in
conjunction with private indus
try and government agencies. A
good example of this is the work
on the Manhattan Project in the
1940's which helped in the de
velopment of atomic energy.
Mr. Arlook states that the Uni
versity is supporting the War by
allowing this research to go on.
Could not one also say that by
allowing him and others to use
university facilities to voice their
opposition that the University is
therefore supporting this opposi
tion?
