# Coffee House Opening Date Still Uncertain
## 
### 
The new Coffee House in Tresidder
will probably open next week instead
of tonight, as was reported earlier.
The Coffee House will be open on
an experimental basis on Thursday
and Friday nights. If there is sufficient
demand, more days will be added to
the schedule.
Although located in Tresidder, the
Coffee House will be isolated from the
rest of the Union, will be decorated dif
ferently, and will have a separate en
trance.
The exact opening date has not yet
been decided upon.
