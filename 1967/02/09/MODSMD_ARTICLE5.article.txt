## 
### LONNIE TERRY 
A noon rally will be held today in
White Memorial Plaza to air campus
opinion on Vietnam and to present
information about a protest fast to be
held tomorrow.
Speaking at the rally will be Pro
fessor of Religion Robert McAfee
Brown, Dean of Chapel B. Davie Na
pier, and Professor of Religion Mich
ael Novak. All three attended the
Washington conference of Clergy and
Laymen Concerned About Vietnam.
Also invited is ASSU President David
Harris. UCCM Campus Minister Rich
ard Roe and Assistant Professors of
English Larry Friedlander and Lucio
Rutolo will address the group.
A call will be issued at the rally for
all concerned members of the Stanford
community to observe a one-day fast
tomorrow. "This will mean skipping
breakfast, noon, and evening meals.
The Clubhouse will serve as a center
of gathering for people participating
in the fast and for other interested
people from noon until 7 p.m. Friday,"
said Roe.
Rice And Tea
"Faculty members and students will
be on hand at all times to discuss the
war and other related subjects. We
will have available simple portions of
rice and tea to aid in the identification
of the fasters with the Vietnamese peo
ple," he continued.
The fast grew out of the Washing
ton Vietnam conference. It was pro
posed to the Committee for Clergy
and Laymen Concerned about Viet
name by a St. Louis clergyman who
cited the "need for renewed sensibility
to human problems ... a rebirth of
compassion." The three-day national
fast proposed by the conference, which
began last night, is expected to draw
one million participants across the
nation. Fifteen-minute services of com
passion and prayer in connection with
the fast will be held today and to
morrow at 8 p.m. in Memorial Church.
Friedlander sees the Stanford pro

test as a chance to show campus
solidarity with the nation-wide fast.
Stanford groups will leave from the
Clubhouse for Grace Cathedral in San
Francisco at noon and 7 p.m. tomor
row. He says the pi-otesters have "an
idea of coming together and dramatiz
ing their feelings in this essentially
nonpolitical way. It will help support
the vigil in San Francisco. By going to
San Francisco as a group, Stanford

can show its support more openly
and clearly."
Triple Purpose
Roe says the protest has "validity in
itself, an expression of concern and
unity of the members of the Stanford
community who are openly concerned
about the situation in Vietnam."
He thinks the protest has three
main purposes. First, "the fast is a
purely personal purpose for the in

dividuals who participate to deepen
their own feeling and compassion for
the people of Vietnam and people
everywhere.
"The second purpose is to draw to
gether the people who are concerned
to protest and to help them be award
of a sense of community among one
another.
"Third, is to make a witness to the
larger community of our concern."

A noon rally will be held today in
White Memorial Plaza to air campus
opinion on Vietnam and to present
information about a protest fast to be
held tomorrow.
Speaking at the rally will be Pro
fessor of Religion Robert McAfee
Brown, Dean of Chapel B. Davie Na
pier, and Professor of Religion Mich
ael Novak. All three attended the
Washington conference of Clergy and
Laymen Concerned About Vietnam.
Also invited is ASSU President David
Harris. UCCM Campus Minister Rich
ard Roe and Assistant Professors of
English Larry Friedlander and Lucio
Rutolo will address the group.
A call will be issued at the rally for
all concerned members of the Stanford
community to observe a one-day fast
tomorrow. "This will mean skipping
breakfast, noon, and evening meals.
The Clubhouse will serve as a center
of gathering for people participating
in the fast and for other interested
people from noon until 7 p.m. Friday,"
said Roe.
Rice And Tea
"Faculty members and students will
be on hand at all times to discuss the
war and other related subjects. We
will have available simple portions of
rice and tea to aid in the identification
of the fasters with the Vietnamese peo
ple," he continued.
The fast grew out of the Washing
ton Vietnam conference. It was pro
posed to the Committee for Clergy
and Laymen Concerned about Viet
name by a St. Louis clergyman who
cited the "need for renewed sensibility
to human problems ... a rebirth of
compassion." The three-day national
fast proposed by the conference, which
began last night, is expected to draw
one million participants across the
nation. Fifteen-minute services of com
passion and prayer in connection with
the fast will be held today and to
morrow at 8 p.m. in Memorial Church.
Friedlander sees the Stanford pro

test as a chance to show campus
solidarity with the nation-wide fast.
Stanford groups will leave from the
Clubhouse for Grace Cathedral in San
Francisco at noon and 7 p.m. tomor
row. He says the pi-otesters have "an
idea of coming together and dramatiz
ing their feelings in this essentially
nonpolitical way. It will help support
the vigil in San Francisco. By going to
San Francisco as a group, Stanford

can show its support more openly
and clearly."
Triple Purpose
Roe says the protest has "validity in
itself, an expression of concern and
unity of the members of the Stanford
community who are openly concerned
about the situation in Vietnam."
He thinks the protest has three
main purposes. First, "the fast is a
purely personal purpose for the in

dividuals who participate to deepen
their own feeling and compassion for
the people of Vietnam and people
everywhere.
"The second purpose is to draw to
gether the people who are concerned
to protest and to help them be award
of a sense of community among one
another.
"Third, is to make a witness to the
larger community of our concern."
