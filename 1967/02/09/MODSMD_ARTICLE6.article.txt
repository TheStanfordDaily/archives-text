# A 						LITTLE TIME OFF
## Journalists Return To School 
### SUE DONNELLY 
"lt's a reprieve from reality," says
Myron Feinsilber, one of the 17 pro
fessional journalists of the fellowship
program which is allowing him to at
tend Stanford for six months-
Sponsored by the Ford Foundation,
the Journalism Fellows Program was
established last September. It allows
about thirty full-time newspapermen
and news broadcasters per year to take
time out from their careers to audit
courses for one to three quarters.
Robb C. DeWall, staff newsman for
KOTA Radio and Television in Rapid
City, South Dakota, called the Stan
ford program a "wonderful opportun
ity to refresh the intellectual aspects
of involvement." He said that it has
given him time to think about the
background of current issues.
Need For Publicity
Another of the Ford fellows, Noel
Lieberman, general assignment report
er for the Oakland Tribune, said that
he thinks the program should be pub
licized more. Publicity is needed to
build the program's reputation, he
said, because the Ford Foundation will
stop supporting it in three years, and
it will become largely dependant on
donations from newspapers.
Lieberman also would appreciate
more contact with the students.
"It is of the utmost importance for
news reporters to keep in step with

his readers," said Lieberman, who cov
ers the city of Berkeley for the Tri
bune. "College students are a big por
tion of the population."
'Ivory Tower'
Myron Feinsilber, newsfeature writ
er for United Press International, said
that the program has given him "a
chance to read and to think away
from the typewriter."
Feinsilber, who is taking mainly
history courses, finds the professors "a
lot closer to the real world than the
students are." He feels that if the
"Ivory Tower of Intellectualism" ap
plies, it refers to students rather than
instructors.
Miss Charlotte Buchen, general as
signment reporter for The Arizona
Republic, said that most major papers
are quite challenged by the technical
age. "It is difficult for reporters to
do an adequate job of presenting and
interpreting it intelligently," she said.
She said that the responsibilities of
the professor and of the reporter are
similar in that both must be objec

tive and not hesitate to point out
controversy; both must present all
facets of an issue and let their lis
teners make their own decision.
Practical Application
Miss Buchen, whose special interest
is in social welfare issues, especially
the War on Poverty, said that during
last quarter she was upset by profes
sors' seeming unawareness of the
practical application of the learning
they offered.
But this quarter she has found that
she cannot say this on a general
basis. She cited Michael Novak, Assis
tant Professor of Religion, as a pro
fessor who relates what has been said
and written in his field to what is
happening today.
Paul Beers, a columnist and edi
torial writer for the Patriot-News in
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, was im
pressed with Stanford professors.
"Professors come well-prepared for
each class," he said, "and they don't
use old class notes." Beers also said
that reading assignments are good
and up-to-date.
