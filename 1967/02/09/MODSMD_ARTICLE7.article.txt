# Commission Expects To Direct Heaviest Fire At 2-S Deferments
## 
### 
The President's Commission on the
Draft is expected to send its report
to the White House in the next two
weeks, and informed sources in Wash
ington say much of it will be devoted
to the question of student deferments.
The sources said the report will rec
ommend drafting the youngest men
first and will propose that gradual
abolition of student deferments be
given strong consideration. The report
will also recommend a process of
random selection of draftees from
among all men classified 1-A.
At present, the oldest men up to age
26 who are classified 1-A are drafted
first.
Student Question
The question of student deferments
was a source of considerable debate
within the commission since last fall,
the Washington sources said. The
debate eventually resolved into two
opposing camps. The first advocated
abolishing student deferment alto
gether on the grounds that it is un
fair. The other favored retaining the
system and eliminating inequities by
a better administration of deferments.
There was, however, virtual unanim
ity that student deferments should not
allow graduate students to escape the
draft by staying in school until they
are 26 years old. Defense Depart
ment studies have shown that the
majority of graduate students avoid
service this way.

It is also understood that the com
mission will not recommend that work
in such organizations as the Peace
Corps be accepted as alternatives to
military service- Also the commission
will not recommend that bases for
conscientious objection include politi
cal grounds.
The 20-member commission, official

ly called the National Advisory Com
mission on Selective Service, was ap
pointed by President Johnson last
July. It is headed by Burke Marshall,
former head of the civil rights division
of the Justice Department.
The commission's members include
educators, clergymen, businessmen,
civil rights leaders, and former gov
ernment officials.
