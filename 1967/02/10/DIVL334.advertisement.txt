60 through 64....50 c insurance for each $1 „
65 through 69. . . .25c insurance for each $1
STATUS—You deal as a member-owner, not as a customer when you borrow from your Credit Union. You are elig
ible for a loan after six months of continuous employment and a purchase of one $5 share. Loans are granted for
any worthwhile purpose.
BORROWING COST—The Credit Union never charges more than 1 % per month on the unpaid balance of a loan.
Some loans are made at % of 1 % per month on the unpaid balance if fully secured by shares. Payment in ad
vance of schedule reduces cost still further and no penalty is assessed for prepayment. The Credit Union does not
charge loan setup fees, filing fees, or late payment fees. Loan payments are made through payroll deductions.
LOAN INSURANCE—Another benefit provided for borrowers without additional cost is credit life insurance on

CREDIT UNION SAFEGUARDS-Since the Credit Union has been chartered by the Federal government, it is regu
lated by Federal laws and is audited at least once a year by Federal authorities. The books are periodically exam
ined by the Credit Union appointed audit staff. All persons handling Credit Union funds are bonded. In the final
analysis, the best guarantee of the stability and security of the Credit Union is the character and financial responsi
bility of Stanford Credit Union members themselves.
