# Students Protest Napalm Firm's Recruiter
## 
### BILL RORABAUGH 
"Can you work for a company whose prod
ucts are killing and deforming women and
children in Vietnam?" ask John Schelling and
Peter Ware, two graduate studeents in busi
ness who plan to picket the Dow Chemical
Company employment recruiter at the Grad
uate School of Business today.
The Dow Company has a $2,9 million Air
Force contract to produce napalm, according
to the Defense Industry Bulletin. The company
also manufactures polystyrene, half of type-
B napalm, a new napalm that "adheres better"
to the skin, said Ware and Schelling.
The pickets ask two questions: "First, as
regards the individual firm, is there a place

for moral and ethical considerations within
the firm? Or is it rather our responsibility as
businessmen simply to meet the demand, re
gardless of what is demanded?
Ethical 'Cost'
"Second, is there a moral or ethical 'cost'
which you should consider in deciding whether
to work for Dow? Should you, as a business
man, even consider such immeasurable fac
tors?"
Schelling commented, "We're not saying
Dow should be dismantled, but business stu
dents should be aware of what Dow makes."
Ware and Schelling have placed copies of
their statement in the boxes of all business
school students.

Schelling said, "We aren't interested in con
demning Dow per se, but in getting people
to make their own judgments."
The Dow Company has issued a statement
endorsing "the right of any American to
legally and peacefully protest an action with
which he does not agree "
Not Policy Makers
The statement adds, "Our position on the
manufacture of napalm is that we are a sup
plier of goods to the Defense Department and
not a policy maker. We do not and should
not try to decide military strategy or policy."
Both pickets see napalm as part of a much
larger issue â€” the war itself. "Why Dow?
Napalm. Why napalm? You can see the

effects," said Ware. "It's a clear violation of
the war crimes trial to many people. It's
used more on a civilian than a military pop
ulation. It's a messy weapon that attracts at
tention."
Glenn Allen, recruiter for the Dow Com
pany, commented that this is not the first
protest. Ho has also encountered protests
and pickets at University of California cam
puses, San Jose State College, and the Univer
sity of Washington.
No SDS Connections
Allen said the pickets at other campuses
seemed to be connected with Students for a
Democratic Society. Ware and Schelling em
phasized their own effort was not connected

with SDS, but Ware mentioned the subject had
came up at one SDS meeting he had at
tended.
Allen said picketing had reached its peak
last fall, adding, "There doesn't seem to be
much activity lately." He said the pickets he
had seen behaved "like gentlemen."
"Our recruiting is heavier than normal,"
said Allen. "We attribute this to our new
brochures "
Ware and Schelling also stated they were
'pleased" with a recent letter in The Daily
signed by the Stanford Faculty and Staff for
Peace in Vietnam, asking for a boycott of
Dow Company products. They said the letter
was unrelated to their own campaign.
