# Reagan Slashes Budget: Demands New Taxes
## 
### BILL BOYARSKY Associated Press Writer 
i * * "SACRAMENTO (AP)—ln his first month as
Governor of California, Ronald Reagan has
crossed swords with the state legislature,
state educators and a union of state employes.
The Republican chief executive proposed an
ahnual budget $250 million lower than the last
> one presented by his Democratic predecessor,
.f<Edmund G. (Pat) Brown.
But then, amid outcries from the legisla
ture's Democratic majority, Reagan followed
up with demands for $650 million in new tax
es.
Casting about for ways of balancing the
v books, Reagan slashed budget requests for
r; .higher education by 30 per cent and suggested
" that resident students at state universities and
colleges start paying tuition.
In the ensuing uproar, Reagan supported
the firing of Clark Kerr as President of the
University of California, and was denounced
as a bad guy in educational circles from coast
to coast.
Defending his actions, Reagan went directly
to the voters in a series of television appear

ances, using his acting experience to good ef
fect in presenting his case.
Partly as a result, a recent poll of the citi
zenry showed that 52 per cent favored higher
education budget cuts and 51 per cent thought
a student tuition charge would be justified.
Sometimes Reagan stumbles as he contends
with the complexities of the nation's most
populous state. At one of his weekly news
conferences, the Governor was asked about a
State Highway Commission appointment. He
replied:
"Let's see, this one hasn't—yes, I'm trying
to remember —no, well now, wait a minute,
when I say no, I'm saying—I shouldn't have
prefaced with that word because that sounds
like an answer to your question. We haven't
gotten to that yet."
As each week passes, however, Reagan an
swers questions with more assurance. Told
the Democratic legislature might add to his
$4.62 billion budget Reagan said he'd cut it
again.
"The only weapon the Governor has in the
event of disagreement on economies Is the
blue pencil and I have every intention of
using that blue pencil," said the Governor.
"I get a little tired of this poor mouth from

the Chief Executive," said Chairman George
Miller Jr., Democratic Chairman of the Sen
ate Finance Committee, which must act on the
budget.
Miller is a crusty, veteran fiscal expert and
a power in backroom legislative negotiations
on the budget and taxes.
Past governors have curried his favor. Rea
gan wants his support—but also seems intent
on circling around him in a television end
run, working up enough popular support to
force the legislature to approve his plans.
Senators and assemblymen sat silently dur
ing Reagan's budget message. He stumbled
several times and finally had to put on his
glasses to read it.
Reagan's assistants asked television stations
for 15 minutes of Sunday evening time for
another fiscal report and 27 stations granted
the request.
"The people should hear it straight from the
Governor's mouth, without interpretation,
without deletion, without any limits of the
communications media," said Lyn Nofziger,
Reagan's Press Secretary—official title: "Com
munications Director."
Was the Governor going over the legisla

tors' heads? No, replied Nofziger, it's just that
"We feel the people, because of the confusion
that reigns, because of the charges, should
have the straight story."
So far, it's hard to determine how well
Reagan's methods work.
Republican groups have adopted resolutions
expressing their solid support.
Democrats, quiet at first, are stepping up
their opposition, but are cautiously aware that
Reagan defeated Brown by almost a million
votes.
Reagan's major plans—anti-crime bills, fis
cal economies, social welfare reform — have
not been heard by a single legislative com
mittee. They will not be brought to a vote for
weeks, and only then can the success of his
approach be judged.
A legislative battle seems likely to develop
over Reagan's new tax proposals.
The Governor seeks an increase in the state
sales tax, from four per cent to five per cent;
an increase in the cigarette tax from three
cents a pack to eight cents; an increase in the
liquor tax from $1.50 a gallon wholesale to $2,
and higher taxes in unspecified "other spe
cialized areas."

Legislative leaders want to use any addi
tional tax revenues to increase state aid to
schools and help make up for local reductions
in property taxes.
Reagan insists that part of the money must
go to pay off $180 million which he says the
previous Democratic administration "bor
rowed from various state funds."
In his search for economies, Reagan has re
quested the state's 169,000 employes to work
on Lincoln's and Washington's birthdays —
normally holidays for those on the state pay
roll—without extra pay.
Commented Bud Aronson, Secretary-trea
surer of the State Employes Union: "Involun
tary servitude."
Aronson said he would urge union members
to ignore Reagan's request. Another worker
group, the California Employes Association,
described this particular economy move as
"ridiculous, uneconomical, ill-timed and un
workable."
The Governor also has found another way
to cut costs. His office is using stationery
bearing the name of Governor Brown. That
line has been inked out, and Reagan's name
is typed under it.
