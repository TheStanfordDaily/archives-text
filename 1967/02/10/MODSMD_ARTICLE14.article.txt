# Prof. Rhinelander: Tension Gives Life To A University
## 
### 
•In one aspect, the university is
conservative force, created by
spciety to pass on its own image
and values, according to Profes
sor Philip H. Rhinelander, writ
hing in the February Stanford
./ Even in ancient Greece, edu
.Cfction was defined as "the proc
ess by which the community
preseives and transmits its phy
sical and intellectual character."
But in another aspect, he says,
the university is a radical force,
** criticizing society in the name
\of ideals.
-> :< i"Society . . . frequently pro
fesses ideals which it does not
So it becomes the func
tion of the university to per
'form the unpopular but neces-
task of criticizing society
for failing to achieve its proper
t goals . . .
Two Forces
'• "These two forces—one con
'flevvative, the other radical —
create continuing tension in the
•university. This tension is in
evitable ... It holds in any so
ciety which professes regard for
;iree inquiry and individual in
• dependence. This tension is what
H*ives a university life."

Professor Rhinelander writes,
"To the student, all true educa
tion is unsettling, bewildering,
frustrating. It has to be."
When students find themselves
angry and unsettled with their
educational experience, it may
mean there is something wrong
with the system, the philosophy
professor admits.
Students Learn To Think
But it may also mean that the
system, though imperfect, is
succeeding—that they are learn
ing to think for themselves, to
search for their own answers in
a changing world. "And that is
the aim of education in a free
society."
Rhinelander sees a need for
balance in the university's new
er function of service to gov
ernment industry and other in
stitutions. This service makes
the university more of a social
force, but it also tends to sub
ject it to more social pressures.
"If the university were com
pletely submerged in society, it
would cease to be progressive.
But if it were entirely divorced
from society, it would become a
pure ivory tower, without influ
ence and without significance."

When students find themselves
angry and unsettled with their
educational experience, it may
mean there is something wrong
with the system, the philosophy
professor admits.
Students Learn To Think
But it may also mean that the
system, though imperfect, is
succeeding—that they are learn
ing to think for themselves, to
search for their own answers in
a changing world. "And that is
the aim of education in a free
society."
Rhinelander sees a need for
balance in the university's new
er function of service to gov
ernment industry and other in
stitutions. This service makes
the university more of a social
force, but it also tends to sub
ject it to more social pressures.
"If the university were com
pletely submerged in society, it
would cease to be progressive.
But if it were entirely divorced
from society, it would become a
pure ivory tower, without influ
ence and without significance."
•In one aspect, the university is

But in another aspect, he says,
the university is a radical force,

Two Forces
'• "These two forces—one con

create continuing tension in the
•university. This tension is in
evitable ... It holds in any so
ciety which professes regard for

H*ives a university life."

Professor Rhinelander writes,
"To the student, all true educa
tion is unsettling, bewildering,
frustrating. It has to be."
