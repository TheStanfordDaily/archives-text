### ANDREW B. WILSON Entertainment Editor 
THEATER
BOYFRIEND, a musical comedy which satirizes life in the Roar
ing Twenties, opens tonight and plays again on Saturday night and
Sunday afternoon. We wish RAM's Head the best of luck in this,
their second outing of the year.
Stanford Repertory Theater, meanwhile, will be putting on three
one-acts by Anton Chekhov in the Spangenberg Theater. Gunn High
School, Palto Alto. THE MARRIAGE PROPOSAL, THE BOOR and
SWAN SONG comprise the special program, MORNING, NOON
AND NIGHT WITH CHEKHOV. Tickets for this production, as for
BOYFRIEND, are available at the Tresidder Union box office.
Master of Fine Arts may sound a trifle prissy title, yet candi
dates for this degree have founded a formidable crew, called the
MaFiA by abbreviation, which will present a MIDNIGHT AT THE
MaFiA Saturday night program of theatrical skits, improvisations
and one-acts at the Nitery. Admission is free, doors open at 11:30
p.m. and the MaFiA encourages students to attend and actively
participate in the fun and games. Peanut butter and jelly sand
wiches will be served as an added enticement.
MOVIES
Tresidder resumes its Japanese film series tonight with THE
ISLAND, a phantasmal tale concerning a family's struggle for
survival on a deserted South Seas isle. The audience will be spared
the trouble of deciphering sub-titles, as there is no audible dialogue
in the movie. Aside from the musical score, the only sound ema
nates from"the natural noises of the Jungle." A student of such
matters, Curt Keck, has informed us that not since Johnny Weiss
muller and Ronnie Reagan opted for immortality have natural
noises been allowed to speak so much louder than words. Ugh!
Tomorrow night Tresidder will show THIS SPORTING LIFE,
starring Richard Harris. The movie is unsuccessful, if its achieve
ments are scaled against its apparent ambitions. A significant re
lation fails to evolve between the two planes on which the story
operates. On the one hand there is the epic of the burly young
pauper who ascends into the glamorous world of big-time rugby,
and on the other hand there is the tragedy of the physical man
who genuinely loves a woman, yet finds his brutish nature incapa
ble of adequately expressing this love. While the different currents
of the one life run their random ways, one suspects that director
Lindsey Anderson may have been groping for some kind of a
Lawrencian message to resolve the flesh and the spirit in his mo
vie. At the least, however, THIS SPORTING LIFE is an interest
ing and ambitious failure, well photographed and worth a trip to
the Union.
Sunday night at Mem Aud features NORTH TO ALASKA, a
moderately entertaining flick which certain minds will no doubt
find all the more entertaining when the inevitable wits and wags
in the balcony add their say. Recommended for the crude and ob
noxious, and all those whose senses of humor require the presence
of a captive audience in a darkened room.
CITIZEN KANE will be shown on Tuesday and Wednesday night
at Cubberley.

at Cubberley.
THEATER
BOYFRIEND, a musical comedy which satirizes life in the Roar
ing Twenties, opens tonight and plays again on Saturday night and
Sunday afternoon. We wish RAM's Head the best of luck in this,
their second outing of the year.
Stanford Repertory Theater, meanwhile, will be putting on three
one-acts by Anton Chekhov in the Spangenberg Theater. Gunn High
School, Palto Alto. THE MARRIAGE PROPOSAL, THE BOOR and
SWAN SONG comprise the special program, MORNING, NOON
AND NIGHT WITH CHEKHOV. Tickets for this production, as for
BOYFRIEND, are available at the Tresidder Union box office.
Master of Fine Arts may sound a trifle prissy title, yet candi
dates for this degree have founded a formidable crew, called the
MaFiA by abbreviation, which will present a MIDNIGHT AT THE
MaFiA Saturday night program of theatrical skits, improvisations
and one-acts at the Nitery. Admission is free, doors open at 11:30
p.m. and the MaFiA encourages students to attend and actively
participate in the fun and games. Peanut butter and jelly sand
wiches will be served as an added enticement.
MOVIES
Tresidder resumes its Japanese film series tonight with THE
ISLAND, a phantasmal tale concerning a family's struggle for
survival on a deserted South Seas isle. The audience will be spared
the trouble of deciphering sub-titles, as there is no audible dialogue
in the movie. Aside from the musical score, the only sound ema
nates from"the natural noises of the Jungle." A student of such
matters, Curt Keck, has informed us that not since Johnny Weiss
muller and Ronnie Reagan opted for immortality have natural
noises been allowed to speak so much louder than words. Ugh!
Tomorrow night Tresidder will show THIS SPORTING LIFE,
starring Richard Harris. The movie is unsuccessful, if its achieve
ments are scaled against its apparent ambitions. A significant re
lation fails to evolve between the two planes on which the story
operates. On the one hand there is the epic of the burly young
pauper who ascends into the glamorous world of big-time rugby,
and on the other hand there is the tragedy of the physical man
who genuinely loves a woman, yet finds his brutish nature incapa
ble of adequately expressing this love. While the different currents
of the one life run their random ways, one suspects that director
Lindsey Anderson may have been groping for some kind of a
Lawrencian message to resolve the flesh and the spirit in his mo
vie. At the least, however, THIS SPORTING LIFE is an interest
ing and ambitious failure, well photographed and worth a trip to
the Union.
Sunday night at Mem Aud features NORTH TO ALASKA, a
moderately entertaining flick which certain minds will no doubt
find all the more entertaining when the inevitable wits and wags
in the balcony add their say. Recommended for the crude and ob
noxious, and all those whose senses of humor require the presence
of a captive audience in a darkened room.
CITIZEN KANE will be shown on Tuesday and Wednesday night
at Cubberley.
