### BILL WERTZ 
BLOW-UP. A successful young
London photographer (David
Hemmings) wanders into an al
most deserted park and happens
upon two lovers, apparently ob
livious to their surroundings.
He snaps picture after picture
of the couple until the girl (Va
nessa Redgrave) catches him
and hysterically demands the
roll of film.
Curious to why she wants it,
the photographer refuses and
develops the film, and as the
pictures are blown up, he real
izes his camera has recorded
something his senses failed to
perceive: the murder of the
girl's companion in the park.
Who has been murdered, and
why? Who is the mysterious
girl? We never find out. Instead
we become concerned with the
photographer and the illumina
tion this strange event throws
on his way of life.
"Blow-Up" is the first movie

made in English by the highly
regarded Italian director Mi
chelangelo Antonioni (cf. "L'Av
ventura," "La Notte" and "Red
Desert") and displays a new An
tonioni's superb sense of color.
What is more, Blow-Up captures
more forcefully than any of his
other films the colorful but
sterile swirl of modern life
around modern man.
In the unreal atmosphere of
the photographer's studio, An
tonioni expresses the dehumani
zation and object worship of
modern society, in which people
are no more meaningful, than
the studio props and facades
that seem so real in photo
graphs.
Through his camera, the pho
tographer has discovered a mur
der, but the discovery presents
him with a responsibility he did
not seek and a set of compli
cated questions nothing in his
life has prepared him to answer.
He escapes the problem tempo

rarily in a bleak and pathetU
orgy with a pair of teenagers
hoping to be photographed, bu
finds his dilemma is still real
Later, when he discovers tl~
murderers have stolen the in
criminating photographs and re
moved his heavy load of respon
sibility, the photographer feel;
oddly disappointed and sad.
No Easy Explanations
In a sense, Blow-Up is an un
satisfactory picture, for Anto. 1
oni offers no easy explanatior
of what happens, and severa
scenes, though enjoyable ii
themselves, add nothing to the
film. One such is the scene of i
rock and roll guitarist fighting
his electric guitar, which is
drowning the music in static
His triumph over the machim
is hollow, if satisfactory, yet i
is entirely peripheral to the
film.
More unfortunate, however
is the final sequence of the film
in which a mime troupe plav«
an imaginary game of tennis
which seems flawlessly real. Sud
denly the ball lands at the pho
tographer's feet. He studies th<
imaginary ball for a moment
then picks it up and throws '■
back, aware that there is mucy
more to life than he can see. Jr
an otherwise subtle and natura
film, the final scene seems £
jarringly artificial and clumsj
symbolic device to tie off the
end of the film.
Outstanding
These criticisms aside, ho"'
ever, Blow-Up is an outstanding
film. Antonioni is a flawless
craftsman in the use of camera
direction and color photography
and Hemmings as the photogra
pher puts in one of the be;.,
performances of the year in a
role which convincingly dram "
tizes the emptiness inside mod
ern man and the disorientation
in modern society. ,

BLOW-UP. A successful young
London photographer (David
Hemmings) wanders into an al
most deserted park and happens
upon two lovers, apparently ob
livious to their surroundings.
He snaps picture after picture
of the couple until the girl (Va
nessa Redgrave) catches him
and hysterically demands the
roll of film.
Curious to why she wants it,
the photographer refuses and
develops the film, and as the
pictures are blown up, he real
izes his camera has recorded
something his senses failed to
perceive: the murder of the
girl's companion in the park.
Who has been murdered, and
why? Who is the mysterious
girl? We never find out. Instead
we become concerned with the
photographer and the illumina
tion this strange event throws
on his way of life.
"Blow-Up" is the first movie

made in English by the highly
regarded Italian director Mi
chelangelo Antonioni (cf. "L'Av
ventura," "La Notte" and "Red
Desert") and displays a new An
tonioni's superb sense of color.
What is more, Blow-Up captures
more forcefully than any of his
other films the colorful but
sterile swirl of modern life
around modern man.
In the unreal atmosphere of
the photographer's studio, An
tonioni expresses the dehumani
zation and object worship of
modern society, in which people
are no more meaningful, than
the studio props and facades
that seem so real in photo
graphs.
Through his camera, the pho
tographer has discovered a mur
der, but the discovery presents
him with a responsibility he did
not seek and a set of compli
cated questions nothing in his
life has prepared him to answer.
He escapes the problem tempo

rarily in a bleak and pathetU
orgy with a pair of teenagers
hoping to be photographed, bu
finds his dilemma is still real
Later, when he discovers tl~
murderers have stolen the in
criminating photographs and re
moved his heavy load of respon
sibility, the photographer feel;
oddly disappointed and sad.
No Easy Explanations
In a sense, Blow-Up is an un
satisfactory picture, for Anto. 1
oni offers no easy explanatior
of what happens, and severa
