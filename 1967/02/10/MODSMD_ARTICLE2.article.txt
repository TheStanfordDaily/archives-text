## Students March Reagan Defends Program At Rally 
### MAGGIE McCOMAS Staff Editor 
SACRAMENTO — Governor Ron
ald Reagan made an unexpected ap
pearance here yesterday at noon on
the Capitol steps to defend his pro
posed budget cuts and tuition fees be
fore a rally of University of Califor
nia students protesting the mea
sures.
Reagan appeared before a crowd of
over 3,000 representatives of the nine
campuses who had marched 10 blocks
to the Capitol, in biting 40-degree
weather. The Governor got a polite
but restrained reception as he gave
an 11-minute talk before a banner
that read, "Keep Politics Out of High
er Education."
"Those who have reported to you
and charged that this is not a tempo
rary emergency situation but that I
have some devious conspiratorial
plan to lower the permanent quality
of education—these people—l can
only use one word—they are lying,"
he said.
Some Delay
The Governor described tlr* pro
posed tuition fee as a solution to a
"serious temporary problem." He said
that while such a fee might cause
some delay in educational progress, it
would not, in the long run, set prog
ress back.
Reagan accused members of the

academic community of inaccurately
interpreting his views on the pro
posed cut of university appropria
tions and imposition of tuition. Of
these people, he said, "not one has
made the slightest effort to commu
nicate and ask the Governor what his
position is."
He praised the marchers as the
"first and only group" to attempt
such communication.
UCSB Support
While representatives of the nine
campuses took part in the march, the
primary support and organization of
the rally came from the Santa Bar
bara campus. Some representatives of
the other campuses had indicated ear
lier that they intended to participate
instead in the march organized by the
American Federation of Teachers,
scheduled for Saturday.
The Santa Barbara representatives
presented Reagan with a formal peti
tion comprised of questions on the
budget proposals and the relationship
between the administration and the
university.
Later in the afternoon the Gover
nor met with representatives of eight
campuses in a closed conference. At
the close of the meeting one student
leader reported that there was "little
time" for worthwhile dialogue. He
added that the discussion had re
volved around the fiscal issues, but

that in regard to the philosophy and
function of the university in general,
the Governor was "a little fuzzy."
Business Venture
Another student representative, dis
appointed by the results of the con
ference, said, "To him (Reagan), edu
cation is just a business venture."
State Assemblymen and members
of the academic community speaking
at the rally praised the marchers for
their orderly conduct. Immediately
following the close of the rally, stu
dents flooded the halls of the Capitol
to talk to their legislators about the
budget proposals. Others congregated
on the Capitol lawns for discussion on
"The Nature of the University."
Reagan's appearance interrupted
remarks by Santa Barbara Philoso
phy Prof. Harry Grivett, who was
saying that the mandate given by the
people was not an authorization for
"death to reason and logic ... or to
dismantle the California institutions
of higher learning."
Tax On Education
Assembly Speaker Jesse Un r u h
called the tuition proposal "a tax, the
worst kind—a tax on education." Un
ruh said that Reagan was not offer
ing an alternative of tax or no tax,
but rather an alternative of tax on
education or some other kind of tax.
Unruh added that he knew of "no
Democratic votes in the Assembly"

which would assent to a budget which
would include a cut in university ap
propriations and a consequent tuition
imposition.
Commending the students on the
rally, San Francisco Assemblyman
John Burton noted that the protest
was hardly a "Rod Guard march on
Sacramento." He added that "stu
dents—washed and unwashed, beard
ed and clean-shaven, sandaled and
shod—are the future of this state and
the world."
Supporting the continuation of tui
tion-free education, Burton said that
the protest indicated that students
were "tired of the hypocrisy the old
er generation has forced upon them."
Noble Fight
Santa Barbara English Prof. Ho
mer Swander spoke of the "new stu
dent" on whose efforts the future of
the University depends and com
mended the marchers for their "no
ble fight." Swander said that rather
than imposing tuition fees, the uni
versities should be "paying the
brightest students from all over the
world to come here."
He said the desire to impose tui
tion is "based on the assumption that
the only person who benefits is the
one who gets the education . . . but
every person benefits from a single
educated man."
One Assemblyman, majority leader
Winfield Shoemaker, observed that
the Governor had taken a "middle-of
the-road" approach to the problem:
"Middle-of-the-road — between Attila
the Hun and Genghis Khan." Shoe
maker added that each college grad
uate is an economic asset and that to
impose tuition would drive students
away from the state.

er Education."
"Those who have reported to you
and charged that this is not a tempo
rary emergency situation but that I
have some devious conspiratorial
plan to lower the permanent quality
of education—these people—l can
only use one word—they are lying,"
he said.
Some Delay
The Governor described tlr* pro
posed tuition fee as a solution to a
"serious temporary problem." He said
that while such a fee might cause
some delay in educational progress, it
would not, in the long run, set prog
ress back.
Reagan accused members of the

academic community of inaccurately
interpreting his views on the pro
posed cut of university appropria
tions and imposition of tuition. Of
these people, he said, "not one has
made the slightest effort to commu
nicate and ask the Governor what his
position is."
He praised the marchers as the
"first and only group" to attempt
such communication.
UCSB Support
While representatives of the nine
campuses took part in the march, the
primary support and organization of
the rally came from the Santa Bar
bara campus. Some representatives of
the other campuses had indicated ear
lier that they intended to participate
instead in the march organized by the
American Federation of Teachers,
scheduled for Saturday.
The Santa Barbara representatives
presented Reagan with a formal peti
tion comprised of questions on the
budget proposals and the relationship
between the administration and the
university.
Later in the afternoon the Gover
nor met with representatives of eight
campuses in a closed conference. At
the close of the meeting one student
leader reported that there was "little
time" for worthwhile dialogue. He
added that the discussion had re
volved around the fiscal issues, but

that in regard to the philosophy and
function of the university in general,
the Governor was "a little fuzzy."
Business Venture
Another student representative, dis
appointed by the results of the con
ference, said, "To him (Reagan), edu
cation is just a business venture."
State Assemblymen and members
of the academic community speaking
at the rally praised the marchers for
their orderly conduct. Immediately
following the close of the rally, stu
dents flooded the halls of the Capitol
to talk to their legislators about the
budget proposals. Others congregated
on the Capitol lawns for discussion on
"The Nature of the University."
Reagan's appearance interrupted
remarks by Santa Barbara Philoso
phy Prof. Harry Grivett, who was
saying that the mandate given by the
people was not an authorization for
"death to reason and logic ... or to
dismantle the California institutions
of higher learning."
Tax On Education
Assembly Speaker Jesse Un r u h
called the tuition proposal "a tax, the
worst kind—a tax on education." Un
ruh said that Reagan was not offer
ing an alternative of tax or no tax,
but rather an alternative of tax on
education or some other kind of tax.
Unruh added that he knew of "no
Democratic votes in the Assembly"

which would assent to a budget which
would include a cut in university ap
propriations and a consequent tuition
imposition.
Commending the students on the
rally, San Francisco Assemblyman
John Burton noted that the protest
was hardly a "Rod Guard march on
Sacramento." He added that "stu
dents—washed and unwashed, beard
ed and clean-shaven, sandaled and
shod—are the future of this state and
the world."
Supporting the continuation of tui
tion-free education, Burton said that
the protest indicated that students
were "tired of the hypocrisy the old
er generation has forced upon them."
Noble Fight
Santa Barbara English Prof. Ho
mer Swander spoke of the "new stu
dent" on whose efforts the future of
the University depends and com
mended the marchers for their "no
ble fight." Swander said that rather
than imposing tuition fees, the uni
versities should be "paying the
brightest students from all over the
world to come here."
He said the desire to impose tui
tion is "based on the assumption that
the only person who benefits is the
one who gets the education . . . but
every person benefits from a single
educated man."
One Assemblyman, majority leader
Winfield Shoemaker, observed that
the Governor had taken a "middle-of
the-road" approach to the problem:
"Middle-of-the-road — between Attila
the Hun and Genghis Khan." Shoe
maker added that each college grad
uate is an economic asset and that to
impose tuition would drive students
away from the state.

interpreting his views on the pro
posed cut of university appropria
tions and imposition of tuition. Of
these people, he said, "not one has
made the slightest effort to commu
nicate and ask the Governor what his
position is."
He praised the marchers as the
"first and only group" to attempt
such communication.
UCSB Support
While representatives of the nine
campuses took part in the march, the
primary support and organization of
the rally came from the Santa Bar
bara campus. Some representatives of
the other campuses had indicated ear
lier that they intended to participate
instead in the march organized by the
American Federation of Teachers,
scheduled for Saturday.
The Santa Barbara representatives
presented Reagan with a formal peti
tion comprised of questions on the
budget proposals and the relationship
between the administration and the
university.
Later in the afternoon the Gover
nor met with representatives of eight
campuses in a closed conference. At
the close of the meeting one student
leader reported that there was "little
time" for worthwhile dialogue. He
added that the discussion had re
volved around the fiscal issues, but

that in regard to the philosophy and
function of the university in general,
the Governor was "a little fuzzy."
Business Venture
Another student representative, dis
appointed by the results of the con
ference, said, "To him (Reagan), edu
cation is just a business venture."
State Assemblymen and members
of the academic community speaking
at the rally praised the marchers for
their orderly conduct. Immediately
following the close of the rally, stu
dents flooded the halls of the Capitol
to talk to their legislators about the
budget proposals. Others congregated
on the Capitol lawns for discussion on
"The Nature of the University."
Reagan's appearance interrupted
remarks by Santa Barbara Philoso
phy Prof. Harry Grivett, who was
saying that the mandate given by the
people was not an authorization for
"death to reason and logic ... or to
dismantle the California institutions
of higher learning."
Tax On Education
Assembly Speaker Jesse Un r u h
called the tuition proposal "a tax, the
worst kind—a tax on education." Un
ruh said that Reagan was not offer
ing an alternative of tax or no tax,
but rather an alternative of tax on
education or some other kind of tax.
Unruh added that he knew of "no
Democratic votes in the Assembly"

which would assent to a budget which
would include a cut in university ap
propriations and a consequent tuition
imposition.
Commending the students on the
rally, San Francisco Assemblyman
John Burton noted that the protest
was hardly a "Rod Guard march on
Sacramento." He added that "stu
dents—washed and unwashed, beard
ed and clean-shaven, sandaled and
shod—are the future of this state and
the world."
Supporting the continuation of tui
tion-free education, Burton said that
the protest indicated that students
were "tired of the hypocrisy the old
er generation has forced upon them."
Noble Fight
Santa Barbara English Prof. Ho
mer Swander spoke of the "new stu
dent" on whose efforts the future of
the University depends and com
mended the marchers for their "no
ble fight." Swander said that rather
than imposing tuition fees, the uni
versities should be "paying the
brightest students from all over the
world to come here."
He said the desire to impose tui
tion is "based on the assumption that
the only person who benefits is the
one who gets the education . . . but
every person benefits from a single
educated man."
One Assemblyman, majority leader
Winfield Shoemaker, observed that
the Governor had taken a "middle-of
the-road" approach to the problem:
"Middle-of-the-road — between Attila
the Hun and Genghis Khan." Shoe
maker added that each college grad
uate is an economic asset and that to
impose tuition would drive students
away from the state.

SACRAMENTO — Governor Ron
ald Reagan made an unexpected ap
pearance here yesterday at noon on
the Capitol steps to defend his pro
posed budget cuts and tuition fees be
fore a rally of University of Califor
nia students protesting the mea
sures.
Reagan appeared before a crowd of
over 3,000 representatives of the nine
campuses who had marched 10 blocks
to the Capitol, in biting 40-degree
weather. The Governor got a polite
but restrained reception as he gave
an 11-minute talk before a banner
that read, "Keep Politics Out of High
er Education."
"Those who have reported to you
and charged that this is not a tempo
rary emergency situation but that I
have some devious conspiratorial
plan to lower the permanent quality
of education—these people—l can
only use one word—they are lying,"
he said.
Some Delay
The Governor described tlr* pro
posed tuition fee as a solution to a
"serious temporary problem." He said
that while such a fee might cause
some delay in educational progress, it
would not, in the long run, set prog
ress back.
