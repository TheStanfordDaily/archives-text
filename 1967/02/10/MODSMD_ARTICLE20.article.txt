# FALLEN LEAF SUMMER CAMP
## Sierras Hold Diverse Pleasure For Alumni And Staff 
### CRAIG LUBBOCK 
Let man's spirit soar
wild, free
under cloudless skies
over crystal waters
In the majestic splendour of
Summer in the Sierra
(reprinted from the Stanford
Alumni brochure)
Hidden away on the south
shore of Fallen Leaf Lake, just
five miles from Lake Tahoe, the
casinos, and Mt. Tallac, is Stan
ford's Sierra Camp—isolated and
rustic.
The camp is owned and oper
ated by the Stanford Alumni As
sociation for the use of Stanford
alumni, parents, faculty and ad
ministrators, and their children.
It will be open from June 24 to
September 9 this year, and will
be under the direction of Camp
Manager Frank Hildreth, Associ
ate Director for Finance Frank
Ratts and Assistant Director
Susy Allen.
In an atmosphere of inspir
ing natural beauty and quiet re
laxation thrives the spirited ex
change of ideas and interests
which characterize a university
community whether in Palo Alto
or the California wilderness.
The difference is that while on
campus this exchange may be
over a desk, at camp intellectual-
Ism in the best sense of the word
is transformed into a match on
the tennis court, a hike, or a
game of golf.
Diverse outdoor activities are
available for the enjoyment of
camp guests, including just plain
loafing. In addition to the regu
lar activities, the Staff plans
special programs for all age
groups. These activities may be
organized or spontaneous, but
they are optional; after all, it's
not army camp; it's summer
tamp.
The Papoose Playground pro
vides supervised play for chil
dren including handicraft in
struction, movies and special
campfires. Horseback riding and
baby sitting may be arranged at
dxtra charge.
For the teenagers there is a
separate outdoor and social pro
gram.

Your time is your own. In the
evenings, movies, campfires, folk
dancing, informal seminars with
distinguished faculty and alum
ni, small parties, and a grand
"Fun Night" talent show are
scattered throughout the week.
A large fire warms the lobby
where coffee is served late at
night, and bridge, chess, reading,
and singing can coexist, not
offensive to the peace.
Just a few minutes from the
camp are golf, horseback riding,
and ice-skating.
The most popular sport is
waterskiing, and free beginning
instruction is offered. Other

waterfront activities include
swimming, boating, canoeing,
sailing and fishing.
The old volleyball game still
exists and of course the trails
are there for your exploring.
Recreational facilities include
a soda fountain, recreation hall,
lounge and library, nature area,
badminton, tennis, shuffleboard,
basketball and volleyball courts,
horseshoe pits and campfire and
chapel areas. This year a new
recreation complex with open
pit barbeques has been added
near the beach.
One of the new programs at
the camp this summer is the
"faculty-in-residence." Dr. Eu

gene Yates of the Physiology de
partment is chairman of the pro
gram. One evening each week a
member of the faculty will lead
a discussion "on the social issues
that are affected by universities,
and by which universities are af
fected," according to Yates.
If you're not out on the courts,
at the beach or hiking through
the towering Sierra-Nevadas,
you may be enjoying the cuisine.
Three meals a day are served
and this year will feature a re
turn of the gourmet buffet lunch
—seven days a week.
Each family usually stays for
a week; the camp week begins

with Saturday dinner and ends
the following Saturday with
breakfast and a box lunch for
the journey home.
Reservations can be made
from the Alumni Association
at Bowman Alumni House.
Behind the scenes making sure
everything runs smoothly and
providing much of the spirit are
some twenty Stanford students
who serve as the staff.
It is often asked who benefits
most—the Sierra Camp guests

or the employees? Beyond any
doubt, the waitresses, boat boys,
recreation staff, and office help
stand to gain for more from their
stay in the mountains.
The camp is now hiring stu
dents for this summer. Applica
tions may be picked up at the
Bowman House from Susy Allen
until the end of next week. And
anyone who applies and is for
tunate enough to qualify will be
plunged into a stimulating, grati
fying job.
Fallen Leaf provides one of the
best opportunities Stanford of
fers for communication between
faculty and students. Leisure is
the pivotal factor which makes
the vast difference between talk
ing to professors on campus and
being with them during their va
cation. The barriers are gone;
Dr. Christian Bay can say, "Just
call me Christian."
For 11 weeks 11 different
groups of people come and go,
and the camp has been called a
lesson in Marriage and the Fam
ily, fascinating from a sociologic
al standpoint. In a week's time
each conglomeration of guests
develops a composite personal
ity.
The staff is not paid a king's
ransom, but it eats a king's
meals. With only one day off a
week you can't travel far, but
then you may not want to leave
at all.
After a summer at Fallen Leaf
Marsha Cook, a former student
and camp staffer, summarized
the student experience: "Sud
denly formerly distant names,
like Spitz, Smith, and K< nnody,
are old friends. Better still, their
wives invite you over for meals."
"The administrators, faculty,
and especially the alumni serve
as examples that people can
graduate from college and lead
solid lives, not intellectually as
much as humanly, warmly. They
also show that some people can't.
For this revelation alone the
summer is valuable."

where coffee is served late at
night, and bridge, chess, reading,

offensive to the peace.
Just a few minutes from the
camp are golf, horseback riding,
and ice-skating.
The most popular sport is
waterskiing, and free beginning
instruction is offered. Other

waterfront activities include
swimming, boating, canoeing,
sailing and fishing.
The old volleyball game still
exists and of course the trails
are there for your exploring.
Recreational facilities include
a soda fountain, recreation hall,
lounge and library, nature area,
badminton, tennis, shuffleboard,
basketball and volleyball courts,
horseshoe pits and campfire and
chapel areas. This year a new
recreation complex with open
pit barbeques has been added
near the beach.
One of the new programs at
the camp this summer is the
"faculty-in-residence." Dr. Eu

member of the faculty will lead
a discussion "on the social issues
that are affected by universities,

you may be enjoying the cuisine.
Three meals a day are served

Each family usually stays for

Reservations can be made

Behind the scenes making sure
everything runs smoothly and

some twenty Stanford students
who serve as the staff.
It is often asked who benefits
most—the Sierra Camp guests

recreation staff, and office help
stand to gain for more from their
stay in the mountains.
The camp is now hiring stu

Fallen Leaf provides one of the

develops a composite personal

The staff is not paid a king's

Marsha Cook, a former student

the student experience: "Sud

Hidden away on the south
shore of Fallen Leaf Lake, just
five miles from Lake Tahoe, the
casinos, and Mt. Tallac, is Stan
ford's Sierra Camp—isolated and
rustic.
The camp is owned and oper
ated by the Stanford Alumni As
sociation for the use of Stanford
alumni, parents, faculty and ad
ministrators, and their children.
It will be open from June 24 to
September 9 this year, and will
be under the direction of Camp
Manager Frank Hildreth, Associ
ate Director for Finance Frank
Ratts and Assistant Director
Susy Allen.
In an atmosphere of inspir
ing natural beauty and quiet re
laxation thrives the spirited ex
change of ideas and interests
which characterize a university
community whether in Palo Alto
or the California wilderness.
The difference is that while on
campus this exchange may be
over a desk, at camp intellectual-
Ism in the best sense of the word
is transformed into a match on
the tennis court, a hike, or a
game of golf.
Diverse outdoor activities are
available for the enjoyment of
camp guests, including just plain
loafing. In addition to the regu
lar activities, the Staff plans
special programs for all age
groups. These activities may be
organized or spontaneous, but
they are optional; after all, it's
not army camp; it's summer
tamp.
The Papoose Playground pro
vides supervised play for chil
dren including handicraft in
struction, movies and special
campfires. Horseback riding and
baby sitting may be arranged at
dxtra charge.
For the teenagers there is a
separate outdoor and social pro
gram.

Your time is your own. In the
evenings, movies, campfires, folk
dancing, informal seminars with
distinguished faculty and alum
ni, small parties, and a grand
"Fun Night" talent show are
scattered throughout the week.
A large fire warms the lobby
where coffee is served late at
night, and bridge, chess, reading,
and singing can coexist, not
offensive to the peace.
Just a few minutes from the
camp are golf, horseback riding,
and ice-skating.
The most popular sport is
waterskiing, and free beginning
instruction is offered. Other

waterfront activities include
swimming, boating, canoeing,
sailing and fishing.
The old volleyball game still
exists and of course the trails
are there for your exploring.
Recreational facilities include
a soda fountain, recreation hall,
lounge and library, nature area,
badminton, tennis, shuffleboard,
basketball and volleyball courts,
horseshoe pits and campfire and
chapel areas. This year a new
recreation complex with open
pit barbeques has been added
near the beach.
One of the new programs at
the camp this summer is the
"faculty-in-residence." Dr. Eu

gene Yates of the Physiology de
partment is chairman of the pro
gram. One evening each week a
member of the faculty will lead
a discussion "on the social issues
that are affected by universities,
and by which universities are af
fected," according to Yates.
If you're not out on the courts,
at the beach or hiking through
the towering Sierra-Nevadas,
you may be enjoying the cuisine.
Three meals a day are served
and this year will feature a re
turn of the gourmet buffet lunch
—seven days a week.
Each family usually stays for
a week; the camp week begins

with Saturday dinner and ends
the following Saturday with
breakfast and a box lunch for
the journey home.
Reservations can be made
from the Alumni Association
at Bowman Alumni House.
Behind the scenes making sure
everything runs smoothly and
providing much of the spirit are
some twenty Stanford students
who serve as the staff.
It is often asked who benefits
most—the Sierra Camp guests

or the employees? Beyond any
doubt, the waitresses, boat boys,
recreation staff, and office help
stand to gain for more from their
stay in the mountains.
