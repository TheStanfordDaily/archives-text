# Tax Credit Bill Introduced
## 
### 
(CPS)â€”A bill to provide in
come tax credit of up to $325 for
college students and their par
ents was re-introduced in the
Senate Monday by Sen. Abra
ham Ribicoff (D-Conn.).
The proposal, co-sponsored by
46 senators, is opposed by sev
eral major education associa
tions, including the National As
sociation of State Universities
and Land-Grant Colleges and the
Association of State Colleges and
Universities.
Ribicoff's bill would allow a
75 per cent income tax credit on
the first $200 of tuition, fees,

books, and supplies. This means
that if one paid $200 tuition, $150
could be deducted from the in
dividual's net income tax bill.
The next $300 would be lessened
by a 25 per cent credit, allowing
another $75 in deductions from
the tax due, while a 10 per cent
credit, or up to $100, would be
provided on the following $1,000.
Though Ribicoff claims over
two-thirds of the benefits under
his bill would go to families
earning less than $10,000 a year,
opponents of the proposal note
that families with several chil
dren, earning $5,000, would not

gain from the bill since they pay
no income tax.
Additionally, opponents of Rib
icoff's proposal charge, the tax
credit could be used as a way
of bypassing the Constitutional
provisions against use of public
funds for discriminatory pur
poses.
The tax credit bill was de
feated in the Senate during the
last session by a vote of 47-37.
With its current 46 co-sponsoijs
and the strong possibility that its
provisions will be included as
part of the Ftepublicans' tax pro
posals, passage seems likely.
