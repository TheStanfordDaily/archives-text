# On Rushing Stanford Faces Long Weekend In Washington
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Stanford's propensity to pro
duce athletic teams with totally
unnexpected merit — brilliance
or impotence — has produced an
excitingly successful basketball
team.
Stanford's cage material, at the
season's outset, appeared doom
ed to the dismal depths of the
conference cellar.
The Indians, too short and far

outclassed, have racked up an 11-
5 record, including 7 wins in their
last 8 games. Stanford has lost
only one AAWU encounter, that
to UCLA, and holds the second
ranking behind the Bruins.
Last weekend, the Cards hand
led Denver, 66-58, and the Air
Force, 80-65, working against an
incredible height disadvantage
both times.
The Indians will have to tie

Cinderella's basketball slippers
on tight this weekend, as once
again they must look up to prac
tically every one of their adver
saries. Stanford faces towering
Washington State Saturday
night and takes on Washington
Monday night.
Washington State's Jim Mc-
Kean has hit 19.1 points per game
so far this season. The 6-10 cen
ter is sixth in the AAWU in scor

ing and ranks second behind Lew
Alcindor in rebounds.
Backing up McKean are for
wards Ray Stein and Randy
Stoll, each hitting better than 11
ppg, and guard Ted Wierman,
10.2 ppg.
Hot Husky Harris
Washington's 6-10 center Gor
dy Harris has hit 19.8 points per
game in conference action. Keep
ing him company among the
clouds are forwards Dave Carr
(15.0) and Dave Hovde (10.1).
Guard Gary Ostenson has scored
at an 11.2 clip for the Huskies.
Rich Baker, who stands 6-7 at
center, will get the call to handle
the "Big Man." Baker held Den
ver's 6-10 Brian Clare to zilch,
but Air Force's Cliff Parsons got
away with 26 points.
Don Griffin has emerged lately
as the top defensive Indian. Grif
fin and Art Harris kept Denver's
Ail-American candidate Harry
Hollines to a season low of 14
points. Griffin's 18.0 conference
average puts him among the
AAWU's top ten scorers.
Art Tops Cards
Art Harris' 15.1 season aver
age still is the Tribe's best. Gary
Petersmeyer, the driving force
behind the Stanford offense, has
hit 11.5 for an average from his
guard position.
Howard Hassen, with 14 and 15
point efforts in two of his last
three games, will chuck an un
expected parameter onto the
Washington courts.
Frosh Face Santa Clara
The Stanford frosh, 8-2 after
a 70-64 win over UOP and a white
wash of Mare Island Naval Sta
tion, get a chance to avenge a
painful 92-61 loss to Santa Clara
tonight in San Jose.
