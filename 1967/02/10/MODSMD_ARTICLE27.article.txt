# Foothill Owls Next In Line For Powerful Stanford Swimmers
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER Sports Editor 
Foothill College has the dubi
ous privilege of hosting Stan
ford's NCAA-bound swimming
team tomorrow at 2 p.m. The
Cards have doused five dual
meet opponents with ease, and
swamped the Stanford Relays
with six meet records and an
NCAA 800 free relay record.
Foothill, perennially the top
junior college swimming power
in the country, has several out
standing individuals, but nothing
to compare with Stanford's pow
er and depth.
Greg Buckingham set an
NCAA record for the 1000 free
style (10:09.7) in Stanford's first
meet of the season, but has since

lost it to UCLA's Mike Burton
(10:05.4). Buckingham will try
to get it back tomorrow, but will
get a race from Foothill's
George Watson, whose 10:17.3
last week stood for a national
JC record.
Unpassable Buck
Buckingham's 1:58.9 for the
200 individual medley, 4:45.2 for
the 500 free, and 1:43.3 200 free
style split all stand on top of
the country.
Buckingham, Pete Siebert,
Mark Parmley, and Dick Roth
completely dominate the AAWU
200 IM rankings. Foothill's Ralph
Hutton, however, will be hard
to beat. Hutton, a member of the
Canadian Olympic team, won the
individual medley and back
stroke races in the British Com
monwealth Games last summer.
Owl backstrokers John Lea
sure and Fred Skarbo will push
Stanford's Bill Kee and Bob

Hart for the upside-down honors.
Stanford coach Jim Gaughran
has kept the team on a grueling
workout schedule up through the
Foothill meet in anticipation of
.next week's now-or-never en
counters with USC and UCLA.
USC has won more than 75
straight dual meets and has
brought home the NCAA cham
pionship the past four years.
UCLA, with world-record holder
Mike Burton and sprinter Zack
Zorn in the lead, pose no less
threat.
Stanford led five of the ten
individual events and both relays
in the most recent AAWU rank
ings. The Cards placed at least
three men among the AAWU's
top six in seven different events.
The Stanford frosh host Santa
Ana JC tomorrow at 10 a.m. The
Papooses lost their opening meet
to the Cal frosh, 54-50, in the
last relay two weeks ago.
