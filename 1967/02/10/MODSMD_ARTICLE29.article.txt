# CONFERENCE CHAMPS
## Tribe Hosts Nevada Boxers 
### JOHN MERRILL 
"It should be a great card.
We're ready," were the com
ments of Stanford boxing coach
Ray Lunny when asked about
Saturday's night match against
defending league champion, the
University of Nevada.
Nevada will bring two of the
members of last year's team who
won individual titles, Mike Schel
lin in the 156 pound class and
Tony Scheuller in the 165 pound
class.
When asked about the overall
Nevada strength, Lunny said

"They are pretty strong in all
weights. Besides the two cham
pions, Jeff Olivas, the son of the
coach Jimmy Olivas, is very
tough at 180."
Two Forfeits
As in the past Stanford must
forfeit the first two weight
classes, 125 and 132. Behind 2-0
from the start, the veteran Stan
ford boxers will have a struggle
to catch up in the nine matches
that are scheduled.
Opening the card for Stanford
will be Dave Hibbitts at 139
pounds. Hibbitts missed last
week's California matches due to
an injury, but has been working
out all this week.
In the 147 pound class Stan
ford's Bill Thomas will go
against Bob Diullo. Though de
feated last week, Thomas has
been especially strong in work
outs this past week.
Marlar in Tough
Jim Marlar, at 156, has the
task of dethroning Schellin, title
holder in the division. Marlar
brings an undefeated record into
this, what may be the best match
of the meet.
Rapidly improving Barney Ad
ler will be Stanford's choice in
the second 156 pound match. Ad
ler will face either John Silver
or Mikey McCrorey.
Nevada's other champion,
Tony Scheuller, will be facing
John Price of Stanford. Price de
feated Scheuller last year,
though the Nevada man eventu
ally won the conference title at
the season's end
Jenks at 172
Stanford's league champion
from last year, Tom Jenks, will
go against Riley Beckett in the
172 pound class. Beckett and
Jenks have fought twice in the

past with the record even at a
victory apiÂ°ce
Mike Palmer battles the vet
eran Olivas at 180. Palmer
pounded out a victory in the Cal
match last week and seems re
covered from a previous should
er injury.
Another for De Gooyer?
In the top heavyweight match,
Eric De Gooyer faces Gary Sil
verman. De Gooyer has knocked
out both his two previous oppo
nents this year. Silverman is a

letterman from last year for Ne
vada.
The final bout of the evening
will match Stanford's Dave Os
wald with Mike Smithwick of
Nevada. Oswald is undefeated
this year, with two draws, one a
questionable decision against
California.
The meet begins at 8:00 p.m. in
Encina Gym. Spectators are en
couraged to come early, due to
the crowded seating conditions
that always prevail at Encina.

a 2:03.7, and sixth In the 50 free,
