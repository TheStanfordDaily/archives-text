# Day Long Fast Begun To Protest Involvement In Vietnam War
## 
### BILL WERTZ 
A 24-hour fast is underway on the
Stanford campus today to express "an
guish, concern and protest" about the
nature of U.S. military involvement in
Vietnam.
A group of seven Stanford profes
sors and theologians urged a crowd
of more than 300 on White Plaza yes
terday to fast from 7 p.m. Thursday
until 7 p.m. Friday and to join a peace
vigil in San Francisco in an effort to
influence a change in the war effort.
Professor of Religion Robert Mc-
Afee Brown, Dean of Chapel 13. Davie
Napier and Professor of Religion Mi
chael Novak recently returned from a
Washington conference on Vietnam at
tended by members of the clergy con
cerned with the war.
Grass-roots Influence
All three theologians said they re
turned from the conference with a
feeling that the government is In a cru
cial period and is prepared to be in
fluenced by a change in grass-roots
feeling. They urged that those opposed
to the war make their views known
in order to assure members of the ad
ministration that their political lives

would not be endangered by a de-escal
ation of the war effort.
Napier termed the conference "less
of protest than of pleading—more of
anguish than anger," and said it con
cluded all the old answers about Viet
nam were "obscene."
"We have made a series of ghastly
mistakes in Vietnam," Brown said.
"Our task now is to bring about radical
initiatives for change."
Extend Truce
Brown urged that the government
maintain the present four-day New
Year truce, not resume bombing of
North Vietnam and make clear an in
tention to include the Viet Cong in any
settlement negotiations.
"There is no reason for the other
side to trust us unless we make these
concrete steps," Brown said.
"The time has come to repent,"
Brown said, "The time has come to
turn about, begin again and make a
fresh start." This is hard for an indi
vidual to do, and it Is hard for a coun
try to do, he said, "but that is what nur
nation is called upon to do."
"Goaded Patriotism
Novak charged that Americans had

been "goaded into patriotism and into
a war fever," but reported that during
a half hour off-the-record conversation
with Secretary of Defense Robert Mc-
Namara he had come to respect the
secretary's "sensitivity and intelli
gence."
Student body president Dave Harris,
who attended an off-the-record inter
view with Secretary of State Dean
Rusk, said it is time "for the people
who compose down-home America to
make their voices heard," reporting
that Rusk felt his job would be jeopar
dized if he recanted a policy he was
instrumental in formulating.
There was some question and dis
approval from the audience about the
fact that Novak and Harris agreed to
off-the-record interviews with the of
ficials and could not report specifically
what was discussed in the meetings.
Harris said he had opposed closing
the sessions, but had been voted down
by the other student body presidents
who attended the meeting.
Novak said he had been in favor of
off-the-record talks because he felt
more meaningful things could be dis
cussed.

There was some question and dis
approval from the audience about the
fact that Novak and Harris agreed to
off-the-record interviews with the of
ficials and could not report specifically
what was discussed in the meetings.
Harris said he had opposed closing
the sessions, but had been voted down
by the other student body presidents
who attended the meeting.
Novak said he had been in favor of
off-the-record talks because he felt
more meaningful things could be dis
cussed.
A 24-hour fast is underway on the
Stanford campus today to express "an
guish, concern and protest" about the
nature of U.S. military involvement in
Vietnam.
A group of seven Stanford profes
sors and theologians urged a crowd
of more than 300 on White Plaza yes
terday to fast from 7 p.m. Thursday
until 7 p.m. Friday and to join a peace
vigil in San Francisco in an effort to
influence a change in the war effort.
Professor of Religion Robert Mc-
Afee Brown, Dean of Chapel 13. Davie
Napier and Professor of Religion Mi
chael Novak recently returned from a
Washington conference on Vietnam at
tended by members of the clergy con
cerned with the war.
Grass-roots Influence
All three theologians said they re
turned from the conference with a
feeling that the government is In a cru
cial period and is prepared to be in
fluenced by a change in grass-roots
feeling. They urged that those opposed
to the war make their views known
in order to assure members of the ad
ministration that their political lives

would not be endangered by a de-escal
ation of the war effort.
Napier termed the conference "less
of protest than of pleading—more of
anguish than anger," and said it con
cluded all the old answers about Viet
nam were "obscene."
"We have made a series of ghastly
mistakes in Vietnam," Brown said.
"Our task now is to bring about radical
initiatives for change."
Extend Truce
Brown urged that the government
maintain the present four-day New
Year truce, not resume bombing of
North Vietnam and make clear an in
tention to include the Viet Cong in any
settlement negotiations.
"There is no reason for the other
side to trust us unless we make these
concrete steps," Brown said.
"The time has come to repent,"
Brown said, "The time has come to
turn about, begin again and make a
fresh start." This is hard for an indi
vidual to do, and it Is hard for a coun
try to do, he said, "but that is what nur
nation is called upon to do."
"Goaded Patriotism
Novak charged that Americans had

been "goaded into patriotism and into
a war fever," but reported that during
a half hour off-the-record conversation
with Secretary of Defense Robert Mc-
Namara he had come to respect the
secretary's "sensitivity and intelli
gence."
Student body president Dave Harris,
who attended an off-the-record inter
view with Secretary of State Dean
Rusk, said it is time "for the people
