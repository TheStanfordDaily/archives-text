# Undefeated Ruggers Meet Trojan 15 In Los Angeles
## 
### 
Undefeated and untied for the
season the Stanford Rugby team
travels south this weekend to
face the Southern California
Rugby squad.
Last weekend the Indians, led
by high scoring Mike Grace,
raced by the San Francisco
Olympic Club. Up until last
weekend the Olympic Club liked
to tout themselves as one of the
best rugby teams in the United
States. The Club will tour Eu
rope this summer.
Because of a ruling of Trojan
football coach John McKay, USC
does not allow its football play
ers to participate in rugby, un
like Stanford.
This has weakened the USC
chances in the past and this
season should be no different.
However, Stanford coach Pete
Kmetovic stated, "You can never
tell what USC will come up
with."
Thus far this season the Card

ruggers have outscored their op
ponents 73-22- Mike Grace has
individually outscored the other
teams 43-22 in leading the attack
in all four games this season.
However, Grace has been
backed by a fast backfield and a
veteran scrum. No team has
scored more than ten points
against Stanford and scrum play
has generally kept the ball out
of Indian territory all season.
The Indians' next home game
is on February 18, when Stan
ford will host the UCLA Bruins'
rugby team on the Stanford
grounds at 1:30 p.m.
