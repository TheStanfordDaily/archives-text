# Lost Horizons

The administration confirmed what no one
had doubted Wednesday when it announced
its hand-picked selections for the Steering Com
mittee of the educational review: participation
in the decision-making process is still very
much a privilege, not a right; and students will
kindly serve when spoken to.
This does not mean that Mr. Packer and
friends chose poorly; they may have chosen
very well. Certainly the academic campaign rib
bons of the selectees are imposing, though it
is difficult to suppress a slightly raised eyebrow
over news that only one undergraduate and
one member of the humanities' faculty were
tapped. Any judgment on this question must be
withheld until the committee actually settles
down to work.
But comment cannot be withheld on the
broader and more serious issues thrown into
such sharp focus by this petty squabble. The
particulars of the controversy, so often be
labored here and elsewhere, have now lost
most of their import, but the real tragedy of
the affair must not be obscured by the comedy
of errors staged by both sides during the past
weeks.
The outcome has been, quite simply, to in
crease still further the already pronounced im
balances in the government of this university.
The notion that students and faculty should

have a voice in the decision-making process
commensurate with their individual and collec
tive importance in the university has been re
turned to that never-never land between said
and done, and the once-visible goal of a self
governing community of scholars has been en
shrouded in a thickening haze of autocratic
intransigence. Those who still believe in this
goal and luckily there are a few, can only
view with apprehension the present state of
affairs. The administration, long accustomed
to running the show according to its own script,
with the complacent cooperation of the fac
ulty, has reiterated its long-standing dictum that
student involvement in the affairs of the Uni
versity will be by invitation only.
The faculty has acquiesced massively. The
students, on the whole, have received the pro
nunciamento with indifference. The few ex
ceptional attempts at protest, without exception,
have been bungled. The Committee of Fifteen,
established two years ago as a forerunner of
true community participation, immediately
handed over to the new committee those "issues
of concern to all constituencies" which it was
asked, in more hopeful days to mediate: the
OFF question and the selection controversy it
self.
It is still too early, of course, to predict the
ramifications of this controversy, but it seems
clear that not all the steps taken were forward.
