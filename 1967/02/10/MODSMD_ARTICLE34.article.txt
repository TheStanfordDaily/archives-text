# Letters To The Editor
## Student Questions Priorities 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
In view of the Daily's failure
to inform the Stanford commu
nity of Tuesday night's Memo
rial Church panel discussion on
the Washington Mobilization of
Clergy and Laymen Concerned
about Vietnam before the event
took place, it is particularly re
grettable that Wednesday's re
portage of the presentation was

as incomplete and—well, bun
g-ling: as it was. I understand
that the Daily reporter had to
leave early in order to meet a
9:30 p.m. page one deadline, but
"lack of news" for the front
page hardly seems an adequate
excuse not only for inept jour
nalism but sloppy coverage of
so important an event. This
would not have been the first

time that a story was released
later than the morning after the
event.
The Daily may be commended
for its efforts to eliminate many
laborious speech coverages, but
it must remember that intelli
gent descrimination may well be
the better part of valor: hap
hazard combination of the panel
story and a pitch for the vigil
at Grace Cathedral (which were
in no way connected at the time
the Daily reporter left Mem
Chu) at the bottom of a front
page where the top right story
illuminated administrative de
tails concerning a fraternity
cluster scheduled to open a year
and a half from now is really
too much.
The meeting Tuesday night
was important. It was important
not only for the Stanford com
munity and those concerned
about Vietnam who were unable
to attend the conference in
Washington, but also for all
California voters. Dean Napier,
UCCM Campus Minister Stuart
McLean, and Guthrie Schwartz
of the First Congregational
Church in Palo Alto commented
on more or less fruitful and
most enlightening interviews
with Senators Kuchel and Mur
phy and Congressmen Charles
Gubser and Arthur Younger.
Admiral Arnold True of the
Friends Society made some ex
tremely relevant remarks on the
carefully constituted State De
partment "secret information"
briefings of senators and con

gressmen by White House public
relations men: our representa
tives in Washington may be far
less current regarding Vietnam
and other policy issues than
many of their concerned constit
uency. And Senator Kuchel had
not read Ambassador Reisch
auer's testimony before the Sen
ate Foreign Relations Commit
tee on the current situation in
South East Asia.
At the end of the discussion,
Professors Michael Novak (in
the context of his remarks dis
cribing an interview with Secre
tary of Defense MacNamara)
and Robert McAfee Brown em
phasized the primary impor
tance of the concerned voter
making himself known to his
representatives in Washington
through letters. Politicians can't
function without pressure from
home. MacNamara places re
sponsibility for key foreign pol
icy decisions with the voters.

• Campus Debate?
Editor, The Dally:
It warms one's heart to hear
of the consistent success of our
debating teams in competitions.
But the warmth (such as it is),
is only momentary, for, the
dampening thought occurs —
why is this valour not displayed
on campus itself? In other words,
why are there no All-Campus
Debating Competitions? Such oc
casions would be admirable for
a) presenting the student body
with an opportunity to see these
excellent speakers tear each oth
er apart, and b) being a more

fool-proof mode of selection of
University representatives. This
is not a criticism of the present
method (of which I am un
aware), nor is it an aspersion on
the present representatives. It's
merely a proposal to add anoth
er interesting facet to campus
activity. Besides its entertain
ment value, a debate goes a long
way towards clarifying issues of
interest; one gets so tired of
hearing mere speeches.

• More YR's
Editor, The Daily:
I hate to beat this to death,
but letter-writer Tom Hause
(Daily, Feb. 9) is, I'm afraid,
sorely mistaken in his opinion
of the "generality" of Stanford
Young Republican support of
the Government's effort in Viet
nam. Bob Clark's original state
ment (Daily, Feb. 8) is indeed
accurate. The Stanford YR's do
"generally support" the Govern
ment's effort in Vietnam. Any
one in the Stanford community
familiar with Tom Hause's
views on the subject must be
aware that there is a very wide
"spectrum" of opinion on the
Vietnam war among Republi
cans at Stanford; but I would
stress that the great majority
of Stanford YR's — certainly
enough to jjstify Clark's use of
the word "generally"—support
the Government's basic commit
ment in Vietnam.

• Campus Debate?
Editor, The Dally:
It warms one's heart to hear
of the consistent success of our
debating teams in competitions.
But the warmth (such as it is),
is only momentary, for, the
dampening thought occurs —
why is this valour not displayed
on campus itself? In other words,
why are there no All-Campus
Debating Competitions? Such oc
casions would be admirable for
a) presenting the student body
with an opportunity to see these
excellent speakers tear each oth
er apart, and b) being a more

fool-proof mode of selection of
University representatives. This
is not a criticism of the present
method (of which I am un
aware), nor is it an aspersion on
the present representatives. It's
merely a proposal to add anoth
er interesting facet to campus
activity. Besides its entertain
ment value, a debate goes a long
way towards clarifying issues of
interest; one gets so tired of
hearing mere speeches.

• More YR's
Editor, The Daily:
I hate to beat this to death,
but letter-writer Tom Hause
(Daily, Feb. 9) is, I'm afraid,
sorely mistaken in his opinion
of the "generality" of Stanford
Young Republican support of
the Government's effort in Viet
nam. Bob Clark's original state
ment (Daily, Feb. 8) is indeed
accurate. The Stanford YR's do
"generally support" the Govern
ment's effort in Vietnam. Any
one in the Stanford community
familiar with Tom Hause's
views on the subject must be
aware that there is a very wide
"spectrum" of opinion on the
Vietnam war among Republi
cans at Stanford; but I would
stress that the great majority
of Stanford YR's — certainly
enough to jjstify Clark's use of
the word "generally"—support
the Government's basic commit
ment in Vietnam.

Editor, The Daily:
In view of the Daily's failure
to inform the Stanford commu
nity of Tuesday night's Memo
rial Church panel discussion on
the Washington Mobilization of
Clergy and Laymen Concerned
about Vietnam before the event
took place, it is particularly re
grettable that Wednesday's re
portage of the presentation was

as incomplete and—well, bun
g-ling: as it was. I understand
that the Daily reporter had to
leave early in order to meet a
9:30 p.m. page one deadline, but
"lack of news" for the front
page hardly seems an adequate
excuse not only for inept jour
nalism but sloppy coverage of
so important an event. This
would not have been the first

time that a story was released
later than the morning after the
event.
The Daily may be commended
for its efforts to eliminate many
laborious speech coverages, but
it must remember that intelli
gent descrimination may well be
the better part of valor: hap
hazard combination of the panel
story and a pitch for the vigil
at Grace Cathedral (which were
in no way connected at the time
the Daily reporter left Mem
Chu) at the bottom of a front
page where the top right story
illuminated administrative de
tails concerning a fraternity
cluster scheduled to open a year
and a half from now is really
too much.
The meeting Tuesday night
was important. It was important
not only for the Stanford com
munity and those concerned
about Vietnam who were unable
to attend the conference in
Washington, but also for all
California voters. Dean Napier,
UCCM Campus Minister Stuart
McLean, and Guthrie Schwartz
of the First Congregational
Church in Palo Alto commented
on more or less fruitful and
most enlightening interviews
with Senators Kuchel and Mur
phy and Congressmen Charles
Gubser and Arthur Younger.
Admiral Arnold True of the
Friends Society made some ex
tremely relevant remarks on the
carefully constituted State De
partment "secret information"
briefings of senators and con

gressmen by White House public
relations men: our representa
tives in Washington may be far
less current regarding Vietnam
and other policy issues than
many of their concerned constit
uency. And Senator Kuchel had
not read Ambassador Reisch
auer's testimony before the Sen
ate Foreign Relations Commit
tee on the current situation in
South East Asia.
At the end of the discussion,
Professors Michael Novak (in
the context of his remarks dis
cribing an interview with Secre
tary of Defense MacNamara)
and Robert McAfee Brown em
phasized the primary impor
tance of the concerned voter
making himself known to his
representatives in Washington
through letters. Politicians can't
function without pressure from
home. MacNamara places re

"lack of news" for the front
page hardly seems an adequate
excuse not only for inept jour
nalism but sloppy coverage of
so important an event. This
would not have been the first

time that a story was released
later than the morning after the
event.
The Daily may be commended
for its efforts to eliminate many
laborious speech coverages, but
it must remember that intelli
gent descrimination may well be
the better part of valor: hap
hazard combination of the panel
story and a pitch for the vigil
at Grace Cathedral (which were
in no way connected at the time
the Daily reporter left Mem
Chu) at the bottom of a front
page where the top right story
illuminated administrative de
tails concerning a fraternity
cluster scheduled to open a year
and a half from now is really
too much.
The meeting Tuesday night
was important. It was important
not only for the Stanford com
munity and those concerned
about Vietnam who were unable
to attend the conference in
Washington, but also for all
California voters. Dean Napier,
UCCM Campus Minister Stuart
McLean, and Guthrie Schwartz
of the First Congregational
Church in Palo Alto commented
on more or less fruitful and
most enlightening interviews
with Senators Kuchel and Mur
phy and Congressmen Charles
Gubser and Arthur Younger.
Admiral Arnold True of the
Friends Society made some ex
tremely relevant remarks on the
carefully constituted State De
partment "secret information"
briefings of senators and con

gressmen by White House public
relations men: our representa
tives in Washington may be far
less current regarding Vietnam
and other policy issues than
many of their concerned constit
uency. And Senator Kuchel had
not read Ambassador Reisch
auer's testimony before the Sen
ate Foreign Relations Commit
tee on the current situation in
South East Asia.
At the end of the discussion,
Professors Michael Novak (in
the context of his remarks dis
cribing an interview with Secre
tary of Defense MacNamara)
and Robert McAfee Brown em
phasized the primary impor
tance of the concerned voter
making himself known to his
representatives in Washington
through letters. Politicians can't
function without pressure from
home. MacNamara places re
sponsibility for key foreign pol
icy decisions with the voters.

• Campus Debate?
Editor, The Dally:
It warms one's heart to hear
of the consistent success of our
debating teams in competitions.
But the warmth (such as it is),
is only momentary, for, the
dampening thought occurs —
why is this valour not displayed
on campus itself? In other words,
why are there no All-Campus
Debating Competitions? Such oc
casions would be admirable for
a) presenting the student body
with an opportunity to see these
excellent speakers tear each oth
er apart, and b) being a more

fool-proof mode of selection of
University representatives. This
is not a criticism of the present
method (of which I am un
aware), nor is it an aspersion on
the present representatives. It's
merely a proposal to add anoth
er interesting facet to campus
activity. Besides its entertain
ment value, a debate goes a long
way towards clarifying issues of
interest; one gets so tired of
hearing mere speeches.

• More YR's
Editor, The Daily:
I hate to beat this to death,
but letter-writer Tom Hause
(Daily, Feb. 9) is, I'm afraid,
sorely mistaken in his opinion
of the "generality" of Stanford
Young Republican support of
the Government's effort in Viet
nam. Bob Clark's original state
ment (Daily, Feb. 8) is indeed
accurate. The Stanford YR's do
"generally support" the Govern
ment's effort in Vietnam. Any
one in the Stanford community
familiar with Tom Hause's
views on the subject must be
aware that there is a very wide
"spectrum" of opinion on the
Vietnam war among Republi
cans at Stanford; but I would
stress that the great majority
of Stanford YR's — certainly
enough to jjstify Clark's use of
the word "generally"—support
the Government's basic commit
ment in Vietnam.

In view of the Daily's failure
to inform the Stanford commu
nity of Tuesday night's Memo
rial Church panel discussion on
the Washington Mobilization of
Clergy and Laymen Concerned
about Vietnam before the event
took place, it is particularly re
grettable that Wednesday's re
portage of the presentation was

as incomplete and—well, bun
g-ling: as it was. I understand
