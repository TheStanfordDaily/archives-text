# Two Minutes of Haight
## A
						New Kind Of Demonstration 
### Tim Haight 
One can only elaborate the
problem for so long and then
some solutions have to come.
Here are some wild guesses on
how we might bring human val
ues back into the conduct of af
fairs in America. All of this is
hopelessly idealistic, but for us
that is nothing new.
1. Remember how it all start
ed. Civil rights. Lunch-counter
sit-ins and kids getting pelted
with rocks trying to go to school.
Jim Crow. Folk songs — an a
wakening of middle class youth
to lives they hadn't known. Joan
Baez saying at the demonstra
tion, "Smile, this is a labor of
love."
2. Remember what it aimed
at. Martin Luther King wanted
to arouse the conscience of
America. We called the demon
strations the war "teach-ins".
The purpose was to appeal to
America at large.
Conscience?
3. Remember what happened.
Some laws. The war goes on.
White backlash. Frustration.
America turned out not to have
such a beautiful conscience to be
awakened, after all. North was
as racist as South.
4. Remember where we are at.
We feel beaten-up, disillusioned.
Some of us take LSD, more or
less frequently. That gives a
wonderment, good or bad. It is
not an escape, for we learn about

our minds. But it does not solve
the big social problems, and the
presence of the Godhead doesn't
necessarily tell us how to live
when we're down. But the LSD
culture stresses love and peace
and beauty. Amen to that.
Now, what can we learn from
this? First, we cannot forget the
human needs. When the Move
ment started, it was a gut thing.
With whatever fantasy we ado
lescents of the WASP middle
class could muster we did em
phathize with the Negro. We did
feel the magic of their love of
the freedom they never had had.
Deep-Seated Problems
We made a mistake. We were
too other-directed. We let our
hope for awakening America be
come too important. We should
have been prepared for the pos
sibility that problems of war
and peace, of freedom and slave
ry, were too deeply rooted all
over this country to be solved
with a picket sign on a weekend.
We made another mistake. We
let our desire for press coverage
change what we were. When the
press covered our image badly,
we adopted cliches to fit a simple
pattern, rather than forcing them
to be complex. Then came the
mania for novelty. Each demon
stration had be new, different.
We felt the old values of love
and freedom were hackneyed.
When we realized the "is" was

complicated, we responded by
complicating our "ought". We
launched Yellow Submarines in
stead of saying the verities that
are older than the Gospel. We
had to be "in".
When we had to summon
strength to deal with complex
problems, we became ritualists.
We did not have the breadth of
mind to remember the emotional
drive that got us started. The
need for that emotional commit
ment was shunted off so much
that when it broke loose again
with the beauty of the hippies
in psychedelic new dress, we did
not recognize it as part of where
we had been.
Love and Activism
So we perceived it as a dilem
ma. We said love or activism.
But love is activism, the angry
young zealots notwithstanding.
The hippies are activists. Th?y
are building a community, one
that is integrated and hates war
and is fighting the demon of the
work ethic.
And, in our own world, we can
see again how working for hu
man change — for an end to war

and poverty and discrimination
can be emotionally satisfying. All
we need are means that do not
get us where we were before.
We have one thing going for
us; we are older and wiser. We
can keep our "ought" and ravel
through the labyrinthian "is".
iPerhaps we start by showing
that love at home and in Vietnam
and in the South is all part of the
same fabric.
Promise of Hope
Perhaps, with the vigor and
freshness of our youth, we offer
the country hope. We remain our
selves and invite our troubled
countrymen to come join in a
world of love. We don't go after
their conscience, but their desire
for peace. We say it plain — you
are tearing yourselves up by
clawing up and pushing people
down. Take it easy.
A new kind of demonstration,
one which gives as it demands.
Not "cute" like Kesey and his
mushrooms for the Mayor. Some
thing that just says, "Come, let
us build a new world." We will
run into a lot of slobs, but we can
enjoy it too. The joy is in giving.
