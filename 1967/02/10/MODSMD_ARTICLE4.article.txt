# Untold Tales Behind Closed Doors; Futile Efforts At Compromise
## 
### CRAIG LUBBOCK HENRY MULLER 
Behind the controversy over selec
tion of students to the Steering Com
mittee of the Education Study lies a
series of attempts at compromise
which were never revealed and which
never materialized.
David Stepner, a LASSU member
intimately involved with the issue, yes
terday outlined to The Daily the events
which led up to ASSU President David
Harris' new campaign to seek sup
port for greater student representa
tion.
On January 19, Legislature asked
that the student representatives to the
Steering Committee be appointed by
the ASSU President rather than by
President Sterling. It asked that stu
dents submit their applications direct
ly to the ASSU office. According to
Stepner, Vice-Provost and Steering
Committee chairman Herbert Packer
rejected this suggestion as being "un
reasonable."
LASSU one week later voted to cir
culate a petition proposing that stu

dent members of the Steering Com
mittee be selected by two students
designated by Legislature and two ad
ministrators, presumably Packer and
Associate Dean of Undergraduate Edu
cation Robert Hind. All petitions have
not yet been collected.
Packer, as a compromise, agreed to
let the ASSU President and the Speak
er of Legislature "advise" them on the
selection of student members. He ex
pressed the fear that students would
exercise a veto power.
Of the 80 applicants for the three
student positions on the Steering Com
mittee, approximately 50 were elim
inated before interviews on the basis
of their statement of purpose, accord
ing to Stepner. No students "advised"
Packer and Hind in this elimination.
LASSU Speaker Tom Fostenzer and
Stepner sat in on some of the inter
views, but declined to participate in
the actual selection because they said
they were not elected representatives
of the student body.
On February 4, Harris and Forsten
zer suggested another compromise to

Packer. They proposed that a faculty
member of Packer's choice already
designated to be on the Steering Com
mittee serve on the student selection
committee in addition to the two stu
dents and two administrators. He
would vote only in the case of an irre
concilable disagreement.
Packer, saying that he would con
sider the suggestion, left for Portland.
In the meantime, LASSU made
plans for an emergency Monday night
meeting in the event the compromise
was accepted.
Packer rejected the proposal Mon
day morning.
Following a resolution by Legisla
ture that the Committee of Fifteen

(Cl 5) discuss the controversy, Cl 5
took up the matter at a meeting last
Tuesday. According to Prof. Philip
Rhinelander, chairman of Cl 5, the
committee reached no conclusions.
Reached for comment yesterday,
Harris said that "it doesn't appear that
the Committee of 15 is going to act
upon the issues of the Packer Com
mittee selection." Stepner said that the
inaction of Cl 5 was "the last straw."
At Wednesday's noon rally, Harris
told the crowd that "students must
choose a position." Sooner or later
they would have to stand up for the
vote of last spring, he told them-
According to Stepner, "later has
come."

dents submit their applications direct
ly to the ASSU office. According to
Stepner, Vice-Provost and Steering
Committee chairman Herbert Packer
rejected this suggestion as being "un
reasonable."
LASSU one week later voted to cir
culate a petition proposing that stu

dent members of the Steering Com
mittee be selected by two students
designated by Legislature and two ad
ministrators, presumably Packer and
Associate Dean of Undergraduate Edu
cation Robert Hind. All petitions have
not yet been collected.
Packer, as a compromise, agreed to
let the ASSU President and the Speak
er of Legislature "advise" them on the
selection of student members. He ex
pressed the fear that students would
exercise a veto power.
Of the 80 applicants for the three
student positions on the Steering Com
mittee, approximately 50 were elim
inated before interviews on the basis
of their statement of purpose, accord
ing to Stepner. No students "advised"
Packer and Hind in this elimination.
LASSU Speaker Tom Fostenzer and
Stepner sat in on some of the inter
views, but declined to participate in
the actual selection because they said
they were not elected representatives
of the student body.
On February 4, Harris and Forsten
zer suggested another compromise to

Packer. They proposed that a faculty
member of Packer's choice already
designated to be on the Steering Com
mittee serve on the student selection
committee in addition to the two stu
dents and two administrators. He
would vote only in the case of an irre
concilable disagreement.
Packer, saying that he would con
sider the suggestion, left for Portland.
In the meantime, LASSU made
plans for an emergency Monday night
meeting in the event the compromise
was accepted.
Packer rejected the proposal Mon
day morning.
Following a resolution by Legisla
ture that the Committee of Fifteen

(Cl 5) discuss the controversy, Cl 5
took up the matter at a meeting last
Tuesday. According to Prof. Philip
Rhinelander, chairman of Cl 5, the
committee reached no conclusions.
Reached for comment yesterday,
Harris said that "it doesn't appear that
the Committee of 15 is going to act
upon the issues of the Packer Com
mittee selection." Stepner said that the
inaction of Cl 5 was "the last straw."
At Wednesday's noon rally, Harris
told the crowd that "students must
choose a position." Sooner or later
they would have to stand up for the
vote of last spring, he told them-
According to Stepner, "later has
come."
Behind the controversy over selec
tion of students to the Steering Com
mittee of the Education Study lies a
series of attempts at compromise
which were never revealed and which
never materialized.

which led up to ASSU President David
Harris' new campaign to seek sup
