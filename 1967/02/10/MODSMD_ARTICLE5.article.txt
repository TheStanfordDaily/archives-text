# Legislature Proposes Rally, Fun Stan Change
## 
### SUZETTE LEITH 
The Legislature last night began
consideration of strong measures de
signed to give students a greater
voice in the University, spurred by
dissatisfaction with the process used
in selecting students to the Packer
Committee.
A first reading was held on a pro
posed by-laws change to make it a
Fundamental Standard violation for
students to serve on University com
mittees unless students are involved
in the selections process or Legisla
ture chooses to waive its right of se
lection for a particular committee.
LASSU also voted to hold a noon
rally early next week to discuss the
issue of student representation of the
Packer Committee. Vice-Provost Pack
er or a suitable representative,
LASSU speaker Tom Forstenzer, and
ASSU President David Harris will be
invited to speak. The rally will be
hold on White Plaza on a date to be
determined soon.
In addition, Legislature resolved to
"strongly urge" the three student
members of the Steering Committee
of the Packer study to report their
views of their responsibility to the
student constituency, preferably in
person to the Legislature.
Seen —Not Heard
Speaker Tom Forstenzer termed
the present practice of Administra
tion selection of students to various
committees "evidence of the attitude
that students should be seen and not
heard."
"It is a striking example of the role
students play in the University hier
archy—which is none," he claimed.
"This role is unacceptable to a

group which is involved in academic
enterprize as much as and probably
more than any faculty or administra
tion member," Forstenzer continued.
"Students are central to and essen
tially concerned with education."
Forstenzer added that the "general
value structure in this University
won't respond to anything less than
an organized student body."
Student Impact
"There is a difference between be
ing heard and being listened to," he
continued. "We should have a guar
antee of having an impact."
Forstenzer reported that petitions
concerning Packer committee selec
tion are still available and should
continue to be circulated.
The Fundamental Standard bill was
referred to the Student Affairs com
mittee, with the consent of other
relevent committees.
"The Fundamental Standard was de
signed to protect students," one rep
resentative argued, "and we're in need
of protection."
Appropriations
Legislature also voted to redirect
funds allocated to the Housing Com
mission to enable them to publish
their report in the Daily rather than
separately. Funds were also redirect
ed to allow the Graduate Student As
sociation to spend $73 of their budget
to cover debts incurred in a dance
held earlier this quarter.
A bill to appropriate $706.15 to the
lIR-Foreign Policy Institute was re
ferred to the Finance Committee.
Also, a bill was presented to raise
student body fees by $1 to support
permanent research into education;
however, no action was taken, be
cause of lack of a quorum.
