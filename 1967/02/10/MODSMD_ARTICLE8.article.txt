# U of W Votes Out Women's Regs
## 
### 
The President of the Univer
sity of Washington, Charles E.
Odegaard, last week abolished
mandatory curfews for women
in university residences and
gave each house its own option
on hours.
Odegaard lifted the curfew of
midnight on school nights and
2 a.m. on weekends by approv
ing the following proposal: "De
termination of hours when stu
dents will be in their residential
buildings is the responsibility of
the individuals themselves, sub
ject to such regulations as may
be adopted by living units with

which they voluntarily associate
themselves."
The change affects 2500 fresh
man, sophomore and junior
women living in university resi
dence halls and university-ap
proved housing.
Odegaard gave his approval
after University women voted
90 per cent in favor of the mea
sure earlier this month.
The passage of the proposal
represents more than a year's
work by many students and fac
ulty.
After its first approval by the
AWS Standards Council and

University women, the proposal
was submitted to and revised by
the deans of students. After a
reaffirmation by the council, the
revised proposal went through a
myriad of faculty and adminis
tration committees and emerged
in its present form this quarter.
The change will be delayed
until next fall for those in the
dormitories due to contractual
agreements with parents.
Sharon Woski, AWS Stan
dards chairman and resident of
a university dormitory, said that
she is certain there will be a re
quest from dormitory residents
asking for a spring implementa
tion of the new rules. She said
that the group will ask that in-

dividual parents be allowed to
(break the contract for their
daughters, exempting them
from hours restrictions and
freeing the University from re
sponsibility.
When asked about security
Miss Woski said, "In my dormi
tory everyone has a key sum
mer quarter. It shouldn't cause
a security problem now."
J. Arthur Pringle, director of
student residences, was asked
about possible security plans
for the dorms. He said, "We are
leaning strongly toward a se
curity patrol throughout the
area. We would not necessarily
have night attendants to admit
girls."

themselves."
The change affects 2500 fresh
man, sophomore and junior
women living in university resi
dence halls and university-ap
proved housing.
Odegaard gave his approval
after University women voted
90 per cent in favor of the mea
sure earlier this month.
The passage of the proposal
represents more than a year's
work by many students and fac
ulty.
After its first approval by the
AWS Standards Council and

University women, the proposal
was submitted to and revised by
the deans of students. After a
reaffirmation by the council, the
revised proposal went through a
myriad of faculty and adminis
tration committees and emerged
in its present form this quarter.
The change will be delayed
until next fall for those in the
dormitories due to contractual
agreements with parents.
Sharon Woski, AWS Stan
dards chairman and resident of
a university dormitory, said that
she is certain there will be a re
quest from dormitory residents
asking for a spring implementa
tion of the new rules. She said
that the group will ask that in-

dividual parents be allowed to
(break the contract for their
daughters, exempting them
from hours restrictions and
freeing the University from re
sponsibility.
When asked about security
Miss Woski said, "In my dormi
tory everyone has a key sum
mer quarter. It shouldn't cause
a security problem now."
J. Arthur Pringle, director of
student residences, was asked
about possible security plans
for the dorms. He said, "We are
leaning strongly toward a se
curity patrol throughout the
area. We would not necessarily
have night attendants to admit
girls."
The President of the Univer
sity of Washington, Charles E.
Odegaard, last week abolished
mandatory curfews for women
in university residences and
gave each house its own option
on hours.
Odegaard lifted the curfew of
midnight on school nights and
2 a.m. on weekends by approv
ing the following proposal: "De
termination of hours when stu
dents will be in their residential
buildings is the responsibility of
the individuals themselves, sub
ject to such regulations as may
be adopted by living units with

which they voluntarily associate
themselves."
