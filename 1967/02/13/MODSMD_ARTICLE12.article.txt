# STANFORD BUSINESS CONFERENCE
## Focus On Business And Government Friedman: Old Myths 
### BILL EVERS 
Milton Friedman's speech to
the Business Conference was an
effort to explode the myth that
we must choose between infla
tion and unemployment, or,
stated another way, between
price stability and full employ
ment.
Initially, Professor Friedman
sought to delineate the nature of
this myth of obligate choice. He
characterized the myth as a mod
ern revision of Marx's theory of
"the reverse army of the un
employed." The current version
is that only a reserve army of
unemployed will prevent work
ers from seeking higher de
mands and that rising prices
keep unemployment low.
Friedman noted that in eco
nomic history there has been no
observable relationship between
inflation and unemployment;
they are independent.
He believes that the myth of
choice only between inflation and
unemployment has as its founda
tion a neglect of the difference
between nominal wages (wages
expressed in money terms) and
real wages (buying power) and
a confusion between rising prices
and an acceleration of rising
prices.
Friedman pointed out that
businessmen and workers bar
gain for real wages and real
prices. An increase in the aggre
gate money on demand would re
sult in a temporary boom, but
then labor leaders would in
crease demands in order to com
pensate for the decline in the
purchasing power of the dollar.
Friedman holds that there is
prosperity as long as the public
maintains its feeling that the
existing favorable pattern will
continue. To demonstrate the

power of people's anticipations,
Friedman cited the example of
a situation in Brazil. That na
tion undertook measures to curb
inflation. The result was wide
spread unemployment and a de
crease in output. Labor contract
ed for, with wages geared to the
apparently continuing inflation,
had suddenly become more ex
pensive than anticipated.
From 1955 until 1960 there was
a determined attempt to pre
vent price inflation in the United
States. At the same time an in
crease in unemployment oc
curred. This changed people's ex
pectations. From 1965-66 there
was an acceleration in the rate
of increase of the money supply.
Anticipations have changed. If
there is a recession this year,
prices will continue to rise.
Demand-Pull Inflation
Friedman commented that
those who disagree with him will
say that demand-pull inflation in
1966 caused cost-push inflation
in 1967. Friedman himself be
lieves that the Federal Reserve
Board stepped on the brake too
hard in 1966, and that the con
sequence of this abrupt altera
tion in people's expectations will
be a recession in 1967.
If a stable economy is desired,
Friedman thinks we need a fav
orable state of anticipation. We
should have this if the Federal
Reserve Board would move to
ward a constant rate of growth
in the money supply.
Should there be a recession,
however, what is likely is that
there will be public clamor to
"do something," probably some
thing based on the Employment
Act of 1946. And what we will
have is a series of escalations of
inflation creating a series of
short, artificial booms.
