# Galbraith: Power In Industry Today
## 
### 
These lectures make up the
contents of Galbraith's book
"The New Industrial State,"
which will be published in June.
The following are excepts from
his remarks:
My purpose in this paper is to
examine the location and the
sources of authority in the mod
ern industrial enterprise and to
see the effect of changes in the
location of this authority on the
society at large. By exercise of
authority I have nothing very
complicated in mind. It is the
power to set the goals of the en
terprise, at least so far as these
are not given by outside agen
cies, and the power to make the
decisions that serve these goals.

In time, the notion of the com
petitive market, to which num
erous producers were passively
subject, has largely disappeared
even from the textbooks. Those
in charge of the business enter
prise are routinely accorded the
power over prices and output
that is associated with monop
oly, small numbers or oligopoly,
or some unique feature of their
product.
Power Shift
In the last three decades, most
observers would agree that there
has been a shift of power from
owners to managers within the
modern large corporation.
Yet, over a longer range of
time, power over the productive
enterprise has shifted radically
as between the factors of pro
duction. The eminence of capital
is, in fact, a relatively recent
matter; until about two cen
turies ago no qualified observer
would have doubted that the de
cisive factor of production was
land.
Then in the last century, in
what we all agree to call the ad
vanced countries, land was de
throned. The search for land, set
in motion by its strategic role,
uncovered a munificent supply.

The 1967 Stanford Business Conference, held February 9 in Sj
Francisco, focused on the topic of business and governmer
Milton Friedman is part of the "Chicago school" of Jibertan;
economic thought and was economics adviser to Senator
water in 1964. John Kenneth Galbraith is a leading Keynesit
and was a member of the Kennedy administration.

The Americas, South Africa and
Australia were ail discovered to
have a large, unused and suable
supply.
Capital Economy
Meanwhile, mechanical inven
tions and the growth of metal
lurgical and engineering knowl
edge were prodigiously expand
ing opportunities for the em
ployment of capital. From this
greater use of capital came great
er production and from that pro
duction came greater income and
savings.
Accordingly, the man who
owned or supplied the capital
now had the strategically impor
tant factor of production. Au
thority over the enterprise, as a
result, now passed to him.
The central task of modern
economic policy, as it is most
commonly defined in peace
time, is to insure that all
intended savings, at a high
level of output, are offset
by investment. This is what has
come to be called Keynesian eco
nomic policy. Failure to invest
all savings means unemployment

—an excess of labor. So capit
and labor have a conjoined t
dency to abundance.
Superbuslness
Power has passed to wh
anyone in search of novol
might be forgiven for characte
izing as a new factor of pr
duction. It is not, I shall argu
merely management. Rather L
the whole structure of organic
tion — the whole range of tc .
nical knowledge, talent and e
perience that modern industri
enterprise requires. It is on tl
effectiveness of this structm
as indeed most business doctri
now agrees, that the success
