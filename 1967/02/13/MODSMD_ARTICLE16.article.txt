# CHINA CONFERENCE
## Panel Examines Asian Conflicts 
### MAGGIE McCOMAS 
Resolution of the Southeast
Asian conflict will take another
10 to 15 years, according to Po
litical Science Professor Robert
North, who spoke Saturday in a
panel discussion on "The Cultur
al Revolution —External Reper
cussions."
"People don't have the patience
to wait .... They either want to
pull out of Vietnam now or bomb
China," he said. Prof. North in
dicated that the U.S. must con
tinue to search for effective chan
nels of communication and then
wait until the necessary propos
als are made, while working to
lower tension in the areas around
China.
Also participating in the dis
cussion were Prof. Claude Buss
and John Emerson, State De
partment minister to Japan.
Prof. Mark Mancall moderated
the panel.
Emerson said that while U.S.
imperialism has been the enemy
of Communist China for some
time, "U.S. forces in Southeast

"China's Cultural Revolu
tion" was the topic of an all
day symposium last Saturday,
with participants from the
Stanford and UC faculties tak
ing part. The program was
sponsored by the Institute of
International Relations and
Americans for Reappraisal of
Far Eastern Policy.

Asia are not adding to the cul
tural revolution." He added that
the basic question revolves not
around the presence of Ameri
can forces in Vietnam but around
the conflict of Taiwan.
Cultural Revolution
Regarding the cultural revolu
tion within China, Prof. North
pointed out that to focus on a
comparison of China and the
U.S.S.R. is to present too narrow
a view, since the Soviets started

from a high technological base
and the Chinese started on a
much lower level.
North cited the "technological
gap" as the chief issue of the cul
tural revolution. In China, he
said, discontent has arisen as the
result of inability of the society
to keep up sociologically and
psychologically with technologic
al development.
He reported that the U.S. has
done a good job fo "catching up"
and closing its gap and that in
this respect, the U.S.SR. is closer
to the U.S. than to China. "If the
Chinese took a more Western,
rational technological approach,
it might change the Soviet's
view," he said.
Cooperative Effort
North predicted either a "con
tinuing dichotomization" be

tween powers in relation to the
ability to close the technological
gap or a "cooperative effort" by
such nations as the U.S., U.S.S.R.
and those of western Europe to
help nations such as China to
close the gap. Without such help
he said, China's problem will
only worsen because of her tre
mendous population explosion.
"If Mao desn't close the gap,
then somebody will have to—or
we'll be in real trouble," he said.
In regard to Japan's role in re
lation to China, Emerson said
there is "no great fear" of China
as a threat to the Japanese. De
spite the official government pol
icy of keeping economy and poli
tics separate, Japan has gained
"more respect" for China as the
Chinese have begun to develop
nuclear power. "The Japanese

see China in the future as a coun
try with which they must have
relationships," he said.
Two To Tango
Answering a question about
a hypothetical foreign policy,
Prof. Buss said that "you don't
make foreign policy, but rather
you negotiate it.... It takes two
to tango. We must deal with the
Chinese and say 'what do you
fellows want?'"
Moderator Mancall called for a
"radical rethinking of U.S. ap
proach to other countries. We
need to expose people to more
knowledge about the U.S." he
said.
Prof. North said that the cul
tural revolution within China is
not the real issue, but that it is
related to seven other revolu
tions occuring right now which

need to be solved by the year
2000:
• nuclear energy—how to har
ness and use it;
• use of outer space and the
possibility of extending power
conflicts beyond the earth's sur
face.
• instant communication and
growing rapidity of transporta
tion;
• cybernetics and the displace
ment of a large proportion of the
world's labor force;
• prolongation of life spans
and population explosion;
• ge.ietic intervention.
North added that these new
revolutions go beyond cultural
limits and that "there has not
been adequate attention to thes
seven revolutions —in Marxist,
Leninist, or capitalist literature."

Prof. North said that the cul
tural revolution within China is
not the real issue, but that it is
related to seven other revolu
tions occuring right now which

need to be solved by the year
2000:
• nuclear energy—how to har
ness and use it;
• use of outer space and the
possibility of extending power
conflicts beyond the earth's sur
face.
• instant communication and
growing rapidity of transporta
tion;
• cybernetics and the displace
ment of a large proportion of the
world's labor force;
• prolongation of life spans
and population explosion;
• ge.ietic intervention.
North added that these new
revolutions go beyond cultural
limits and that "there has not
been adequate attention to thes
seven revolutions —in Marxist,
Leninist, or capitalist literature."
Resolution of the Southeast
Asian conflict will take another
10 to 15 years, according to Po
litical Science Professor Robert
North, who spoke Saturday in a
panel discussion on "The Cultur
al Revolution —External Reper
cussions."
"People don't have the patience
to wait .... They either want to
pull out of Vietnam now or bomb
China," he said. Prof. North in
dicated that the U.S. must con
tinue to search for effective chan
nels of communication and then
wait until the necessary propos
als are made, while working to
lower tension in the areas around
China.
Also participating in the dis
cussion were Prof. Claude Buss
and John Emerson, State De
partment minister to Japan.
Prof. Mark Mancall moderated
the panel.

"China's Cultural Revolu

day symposium last Saturday,
with participants from the
Stanford and UC faculties tak
ing part. The program was
sponsored by the Institute of
International Relations and
Americans for Reappraisal of
Far Eastern Policy.

Asia are not adding to the cul
tural revolution." He added that
the basic question revolves not
around the presence of Ameri
can forces in Vietnam but around
the conflict of Taiwan.
Cultural Revolution
Regarding the cultural revolu
tion within China, Prof. North
pointed out that to focus on a
comparison of China and the
U.S.S.R. is to present too narrow
a view, since the Soviets started

from a high technological base
and the Chinese started on a
much lower level.
North cited the "technological
gap" as the chief issue of the cul
tural revolution. In China, he
said, discontent has arisen as the
result of inability of the society
to keep up sociologically and
psychologically with technologic
al development.
He reported that the U.S. has
done a good job fo "catching up"
and closing its gap and that in
this respect, the U.S.SR. is closer
to the U.S. than to China. "If the
Chinese took a more Western,
rational technological approach,
it might change the Soviet's
view," he said.
Cooperative Effort
North predicted either a "con
tinuing dichotomization" be

tween powers in relation to the
ability to close the technological
gap or a "cooperative effort" by
such nations as the U.S., U.S.S.R.
and those of western Europe to
help nations such as China to
close the gap. Without such help
he said, China's problem will
only worsen because of her tre
mendous population explosion.
"If Mao desn't close the gap,
then somebody will have to—or
we'll be in real trouble," he said.
In regard to Japan's role in re
lation to China, Emerson said
there is "no great fear" of China
as a threat to the Japanese. De
spite the official government pol
icy of keeping economy and poli
tics separate, Japan has gained
"more respect" for China as the
Chinese have begun to develop
nuclear power. "The Japanese

see China in the future as a coun
try with which they must have
relationships," he said.
Two To Tango
Answering a question about
a hypothetical foreign policy,
Prof. Buss said that "you don't
make foreign policy, but rather
you negotiate it.... It takes two
to tango. We must deal with the
Chinese and say 'what do you
fellows want?'"
Moderator Mancall called for a
"radical rethinking of U.S. ap
proach to other countries. We
need to expose people to more
knowledge about the U.S." he
said.

spite the official government pol
icy of keeping economy and poli
tics separate, Japan has gained
"more respect" for China as the
Chinese have begun to develop
nuclear power. "The Japanese

see China in the future as a coun
try with which they must have
relationships," he said.
Two To Tango
Answering a question about
a hypothetical foreign policy,
Prof. Buss said that "you don't
make foreign policy, but rather
you negotiate it.... It takes two
to tango. We must deal with the
Chinese and say 'what do you
fellows want?'"
Moderator Mancall called for a
"radical rethinking of U.S. ap
proach to other countries. We
need to expose people to more
knowledge about the U.S." he
said.
Prof. North said that the cul
tural revolution within China is
not the real issue, but that it is
related to seven other revolu
tions occuring right now which

need to be solved by the year
2000:
• nuclear energy—how to har
ness and use it;
• use of outer space and the
possibility of extending power
conflicts beyond the earth's sur
face.
• instant communication and
growing rapidity of transporta
tion;
• cybernetics and the displace
ment of a large proportion of the
world's labor force;
• prolongation of life spans
and population explosion;
• ge.ietic intervention.
North added that these new
revolutions go beyond cultural
limits and that "there has not
been adequate attention to thes
seven revolutions —in Marxist,
Leninist, or capitalist literature."
Resolution of the Southeast
Asian conflict will take another
10 to 15 years, according to Po
litical Science Professor Robert
North, who spoke Saturday in a
panel discussion on "The Cultur
al Revolution —External Reper
cussions."
"People don't have the patience
to wait .... They either want to
pull out of Vietnam now or bomb
China," he said. Prof. North in
dicated that the U.S. must con
tinue to search for effective chan
nels of communication and then
wait until the necessary propos
als are made, while working to
lower tension in the areas around
China.
Also participating in the dis
cussion were Prof. Claude Buss
and John Emerson, State De
partment minister to Japan.
Prof. Mark Mancall moderated
the panel.
Emerson said that while U.S.
imperialism has been the enemy
of Communist China for some
time, "U.S. forces in Southeast

"China's Cultural Revolu
tion" was the topic of an all
day symposium last Saturday,
with participants from the
Stanford and UC faculties tak
ing part. The program was
sponsored by the Institute of
International Relations and
Americans for Reappraisal of
Far Eastern Policy.

Asia are not adding to the cul
tural revolution." He added that
the basic question revolves not
around the presence of Ameri
can forces in Vietnam but around
the conflict of Taiwan.
Cultural Revolution
Regarding the cultural revolu
tion within China, Prof. North
pointed out that to focus on a
comparison of China and the
U.S.S.R. is to present too narrow
a view, since the Soviets started

from a high technological base
and the Chinese started on a
much lower level.
North cited the "technological
gap" as the chief issue of the cul
tural revolution. In China, he
said, discontent has arisen as the
result of inability of the society
to keep up sociologically and
psychologically with technologic
al development.
He reported that the U.S. has
done a good job fo "catching up"
and closing its gap and that in
this respect, the U.S.SR. is closer
to the U.S. than to China. "If the
Chinese took a more Western,
rational technological approach,
it might change the Soviet's
view," he said.
Cooperative Effort
North predicted either a "con
tinuing dichotomization" be

tween powers in relation to the
ability to close the technological
gap or a "cooperative effort" by
such nations as the U.S., U.S.S.R.
and those of western Europe to
help nations such as China to
close the gap. Without such help
he said, China's problem will
only worsen because of her tre
mendous population explosion.
"If Mao desn't close the gap,
then somebody will have to—or
we'll be in real trouble," he said.
In regard to Japan's role in re
lation to China, Emerson said
there is "no great fear" of China
as a threat to the Japanese. De
spite the official government pol
icy of keeping economy and poli
tics separate, Japan has gained
