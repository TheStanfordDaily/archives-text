# Anti-Maoists Bring About 'Paper War'
## 
### LINDSAY BLACKMAN 
Is civil war beginning in
China? Stanford political sci
entist Michael Oksenberg be
lieves that the anti-Mao move
ment is still a "paper war" em
bodying the wall posters which
aggravate rumor in an already
secretive society.
Oksenberg's remarks were de
ivered at an afternoon panel
discussion, "The Cultural Revo
lution—lnternal Politics," as a
part of Saturday's conference on
"China's Cultural Revolution."
Panelists included journalist
Lisa Hobbs, University of Cali
fornia (Berkeley), political sci
ntist Chalmers Johnson, Stan
ford anthropologist William
Skinner, and Oksenberg. Acting
js moderator was Stanford His
tory professor Lyman Van Slyke.
Questioning Loyalty
Oksenberg also thinks China
is not on the verge of civil war
ind accuses the American press
of publishing exaggerated re
ports of the growing regionalism
.■ii China.
Johnson asserted that the
goals of "national self-improve
ment" and economic prosperity
present a problem to China's
government elite. "The mass of
the population will remain loyal
to the Chinese Communist Party
only to the extent that the party
can deliver economic develop
ment and contribute to national
enhancement."
Citing popular pride in de
. elopment of an atomic bomb
and increased industrial capabil
y, Johnson maintained that the
spirit of China is currently more
nationalistic than socialistic.
Limited Opposition
Concurring, Skinner pointed
out that nationalistic fervor is
manifested in anti-Western, anti
foreign, anti - Soviet - revisionist
statements.
According to Oksenberg, the

opposition to Mao is "plural
rather than a single, coherent,
unified" force- He believes the
focal points of resistance to Mao
are the political branch of the
army, the pure party apparatus,
and regions of anti-Mao feeling.
Skinner felt that opposition
had been engendered in part by
Mao's own omnipotence. Van
Slyke pointed out, however, that
the People's Liberation Army
has remained loyal to Mao. For
this reason he believes that or
ganized, open civil war is un
likely.
Poster Watchers
Are there precedents for the
wall posters? According to Van
Slyke, posters have a long rev
olutionary history because they
are cheaper to produce than
newspapers and a safer means
to express heterodoxy.
The quality of the posters
ranges from the good paper and
fastidious printing of official
government posters to the shod
dy signs of the Red Guards.
China watchers would like to
know the quality of a poster as
an indication of the reliability
of its message.
Death Of Mao
What will happen when Mao
dies? The answer to this ques
tion will depend upon whether
Mao is actually directing the
revolution or whether he is a
front for others such as Lin
Piao. Most Sinologists believe
that Mao holds the power and
that his death will spark a des
perate power struggle resem
bling that which occurred in the
Soviet Union following Stalin's
death in 1953.
Outside observers can only
ponder whether Mao has had to
undertake a drastic program
against a virulent regionalism in
order to preserve his power and
to ensure continued economic
growth.
