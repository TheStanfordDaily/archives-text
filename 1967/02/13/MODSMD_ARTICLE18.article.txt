# Mao's Fears Stir China Revolt
## 
### CHRIS RIGOS 
"The most important factor in
explaining the Chinese Culture
Revolution is Mao Tse-tung and
his fears that his vision of Chi
nese society has been denied."
Thus declared Dr. Michael
Oksenberg, Assistant Professor
of Political Science, in his speech
"The Chinese Cultural Revolu
tion: Problems of Interpretation"
delivered Saturday morning to
the lIR-ARFEP conference.
The Cultural Revolution in
China marked the rise in 1966 of
a new mood urging destruction
of the "old, traditional society
and bourgeoisie values," Oksen
berg proclaimed. All examina
tion of Mao's beliefs, the devel
opments in China in the past
seventeen years, and precipitat
ing factors offer an explanation
to the revolution.
Conflict In Beliefs
Mao Tse-tung should be viewed
as a man "deeply committed to

conflicting beliefs," Dr. Oksen
berg urged. While supporting
the industrialization of China,
Mao deplores the accompanying
division of labor. Although seek
ing to maintain and enchance
his own power, he simultaneous
ly seeks to instill in his suc
cessors a commitment to strive
for a new society of perpetual
revolution.
At the same time as he holds
faith in democratic procedure
and decentralization, Mao be
lieves in the necessity of cen
tralized organization to mobilize,
direct, and control the masses.
Finally, although Mao values
the struggle and conflict by
which people become "steeled
for commitment to social
change," he praises the unity
and harmony of a community
merged "into a collective whole,"
according to Dr. Oflsenberg.
Bureaucratic Growth
according to Dr. Oksenberg.
since 1949 there has been a grad
ual growth of a bureaucratic ap
paratus in China that is "almost
impervious to attack." In short,
"the party has become calcified,"
filled with officials skilled in "de
lay, passing the buck, and avoid
ing responsibility."
These officials have become
primarily interested in status
and have grown in their ability
to take in stride Mao's cam
paigns designed to "shake up
and mobilize the lower level of
bureaucrats for shorttime goals."
Dr. Oksenberg asserted that
Mao Tse-tung, in viewing this
bureaucratization and the
growth of a new industrial class,
feels this is not the kind of
society he had envisioned in 1949.
Youth And Army
Mao therefore is turning to the
two classes whose interests cor
respond to his own—the youth
and the Army. The youth, being
the recipients of intense indoc
trination and and education, ex

pect better jobs and political
participation. But because the
Chinese economy is not expand
ing rapidly enough to provide
even a majority of the youth
with jobs, and because the party
bureaucracy blocks their en
trance into political positions,
the youth have become a frus
trated and discontented force.
Mao has channeled this force,
the professor contended, to sup
port his regime and to propel so
ciety forward.
The People's Liberation Army
is utilized by Mao because it is a
coercive apparatus needed in
China at the present time. Fur
thermore, unlike the political
sphere, the Army possesses the
mechanism to draw in new blood
and to purge from its ranks
those Chinese lacking in en
thusiasm.
Dr. Oksenberg concluded in
saying that Mao Tse-tung by

his "emphasis of struggle" may
be "fragmenting the unity of the
organism that he took great
effort to build."
Maneall Explains
Dr. Mark Maneall, Assistant
Professor of History, discussed
the main themes of Dr. Oksen
berg's thesis. He proposed the
Chinese Cultural Revolution was
a part of a pattern of the devel
opment of totalitarian states in
which there exists an "ever-con
tracting spiral vanishing at the
top and ever-renewed at the
bottom."
According to this model, the
ruling party in a totalitarian
state, maintained Maneall, must
delegate much of its power to
organisms for its administrative
activity. However, the people
manning these organisms must
be interested in the efficiency of
their apparatus and its service
to society.

Chinese economy is not expand

even a majority of the youth
with jobs, and because the party
bureaucracy blocks their en

the youth have become a frus

Mao has channeled this force,
the professor contended, to sup

The People's Liberation Army
is utilized by Mao because it is a
coercive apparatus needed in
China at the present time. Fur
thermore, unlike the political
sphere, the Army possesses the
mechanism to draw in new blood
and to purge from its ranks
those Chinese lacking in en
thusiasm.
Dr. Oksenberg concluded in
saying that Mao Tse-tung by

his "emphasis of struggle" may
be "fragmenting the unity of the
organism that he took great
effort to build."
Maneall Explains
Dr. Mark Maneall, Assistant
Professor of History, discussed
the main themes of Dr. Oksen
berg's thesis. He proposed the
Chinese Cultural Revolution was
a part of a pattern of the devel
opment of totalitarian states in
which there exists an "ever-con
tracting spiral vanishing at the
top and ever-renewed at the
bottom."
According to this model, the
ruling party in a totalitarian
state, maintained Maneall, must
delegate much of its power to
organisms for its administrative
activity. However, the people
manning these organisms must
be interested in the efficiency of
their apparatus and its service
to society.
"The most important factor in
explaining the Chinese Culture
Revolution is Mao Tse-tung and
his fears that his vision of Chi
nese society has been denied."
Thus declared Dr. Michael
Oksenberg, Assistant Professor
of Political Science, in his speech
"The Chinese Cultural Revolu
tion: Problems of Interpretation"
delivered Saturday morning to
the lIR-ARFEP conference.
The Cultural Revolution in
China marked the rise in 1966 of
a new mood urging destruction
of the "old, traditional society
and bourgeoisie values," Oksen
berg proclaimed. All examina
tion of Mao's beliefs, the devel
opments in China in the past
seventeen years, and precipitat
ing factors offer an explanation
to the revolution.
Conflict In Beliefs
Mao Tse-tung should be viewed
as a man "deeply committed to

conflicting beliefs," Dr. Oksen
berg urged. While supporting
the industrialization of China,
Mao deplores the accompanying
division of labor. Although seek
ing to maintain and enchance
his own power, he simultaneous
ly seeks to instill in his suc
cessors a commitment to strive
for a new society of perpetual
revolution.
At the same time as he holds
faith in democratic procedure
and decentralization, Mao be
lieves in the necessity of cen
tralized organization to mobilize,
direct, and control the masses.
Finally, although Mao values
the struggle and conflict by
which people become "steeled
for commitment to social
change," he praises the unity
and harmony of a community
merged "into a collective whole,"
according to Dr. Oflsenberg.
Bureaucratic Growth
according to Dr. Oksenberg.
since 1949 there has been a grad
ual growth of a bureaucratic ap
paratus in China that is "almost
impervious to attack." In short,
"the party has become calcified,"
filled with officials skilled in "de
lay, passing the buck, and avoid
ing responsibility."
These officials have become
primarily interested in status
and have grown in their ability
to take in stride Mao's cam
paigns designed to "shake up
and mobilize the lower level of
bureaucrats for shorttime goals."
Dr. Oksenberg asserted that
Mao Tse-tung, in viewing this
bureaucratization and the
growth of a new industrial class,
feels this is not the kind of
society he had envisioned in 1949.
Youth And Army
Mao therefore is turning to the
two classes whose interests cor
respond to his own—the youth
and the Army. The youth, being
the recipients of intense indoc

ing to maintain and enchance
his own power, he simultaneous
ly seeks to instill in his suc
cessors a commitment to strive
for a new society of perpetual
revolution.
At the same time as he holds
faith in democratic procedure
and decentralization, Mao be
lieves in the necessity of cen
tralized organization to mobilize,
direct, and control the masses.
Finally, although Mao values
the struggle and conflict by
which people become "steeled
for commitment to social
change," he praises the unity
and harmony of a community
merged "into a collective whole,"
according to Dr. Oflsenberg.
Bureaucratic Growth
according to Dr. Oksenberg.
since 1949 there has been a grad
ual growth of a bureaucratic ap
paratus in China that is "almost
impervious to attack." In short,
"the party has become calcified,"
filled with officials skilled in "de
lay, passing the buck, and avoid
ing responsibility."
These officials have become
primarily interested in status
and have grown in their ability
to take in stride Mao's cam
paigns designed to "shake up
and mobilize the lower level of
bureaucrats for shorttime goals."
Dr. Oksenberg asserted that
Mao Tse-tung, in viewing this
bureaucratization and the
growth of a new industrial class,
feels this is not the kind of
society he had envisioned in 1949.
Youth And Army
Mao therefore is turning to the
two classes whose interests cor
respond to his own—the youth
and the Army. The youth, being
the recipients of intense indoc
trination and and education, ex

pect better jobs and political
participation. But because the
Chinese economy is not expand
ing rapidly enough to provide
even a majority of the youth
with jobs, and because the party
bureaucracy blocks their en
trance into political positions,
the youth have become a frus
trated and discontented force.
Mao has channeled this force,
the professor contended, to sup
port his regime and to propel so
ciety forward.
The People's Liberation Army
is utilized by Mao because it is a
coercive apparatus needed in
China at the present time. Fur
thermore, unlike the political
sphere, the Army possesses the
mechanism to draw in new blood
and to purge from its ranks
those Chinese lacking in en
thusiasm.
Dr. Oksenberg concluded in
saying that Mao Tse-tung by

his "emphasis of struggle" may
be "fragmenting the unity of the
organism that he took great
effort to build."
Maneall Explains
Dr. Mark Maneall, Assistant
Professor of History, discussed
the main themes of Dr. Oksen
berg's thesis. He proposed the
Chinese Cultural Revolution was
a part of a pattern of the devel
opment of totalitarian states in
which there exists an "ever-con
tracting spiral vanishing at the
top and ever-renewed at the
bottom."
According to this model, the
ruling party in a totalitarian
state, maintained Maneall, must
delegate much of its power to
organisms for its administrative
activity. However, the people
manning these organisms must
be interested in the efficiency of
their apparatus and its service
to society.
