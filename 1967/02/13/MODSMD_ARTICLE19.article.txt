# Buckingham Destroys NCAA Mark
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER Sports Editor 
Greg Buckingham utterly de
molished the NCAA 1000 free
style record by an unbelievable
18 seconds to goldplate a 64-40
Stanford swimming victory over
Foothill College last weekend.
Buckingham's 9:47.2 shone
brightest of the Indians' 8 new
meet records, 4 pool records, and
3 varsity records.
Dick Roth won the 200 back
stroke in 1:59.4 for a varsity
and pool record and posted a
pool record 1:59 6 for the 200 in
dividual medley. Both times rank
among the top three in the coun
try.
Siebert Rips Butterfly
Pete Siebert set a pool record
and smashed Luis Nicolao's 200
butterfly varsity record with a
1:56.9. It was Siebert's best time
by six full seconds and second
fastest in the nation so far this
season.

Buckingham took out his rec
ord 1000 with a 4:47 for the
first 500 (which, incidentally, is
the fastest 500 by anybody this
year except Buckingham). Buck
ingham also won the 100 free in
48.1 to tie a meet record, and
swam on the meet record-setting
400 free relay (3:15.5).
UCLA's Mike Burton held the
pitifully ill-fated 1000 record of
10:05.4. Burton, national record
holder in the 1650 free (16:27),
and Buckingham, who holds the
national 500 freestyle record (4:-
41.1), will have it out in per
son when the Bruins hit Stanford
this Friday.
75 Straight For USC
Defending NCAA champion
USC lurches onto the Farm Sat
urday for the greatest 1-2 punch
in Stanford dual meet history.
Southern Cal has won four
NCAA championships in a row,
and has gone more than 75 dual
meets without a loss.

Stanford swimmers (now 6-0)
reaped a surprising harvest of
best times last weekend, con
sidering coach Jim Gaughran's
heavy workout schedule which
allowed no respite before the
Foothill meet.
Doug Miller dropped his best
200 butterfly time to 2:00.7. Bill
Kee's 2:05 5 200 backstroke, cap
tain Jim Lanley's 2:03.0 200 fly,
Mike Wall's 5:00.5 500 free, Ni
colao's 50.7 butterfly split, and
Tom Jamison's 10:55.4 1000 All
marked best times for the sea
son.
Momsen Takes 200 Breast
Bob Momsen won the 200
breast in 2:16.8. Monsen placed
second in the NCAA's as a sopho
more last year behind USC's
Wayne Anderson. Anderson and
Momsen square off again Satur
day in a 1967 NCAA preview.
Gaughran, while elated with
the bounty of top performances,
was concerned with the less-than

sensational performances of the
Indian sprinters. UCLA's Zack
Zorn and USC's Russ Kidder and
John Havens all stand among the
country's elite.
Bill Meyer, fifth in the NCAA
500 freestyle in 21.5 and 11th in
the 100 (47.5), teams with Mor
gan Manning and Jim Laney for
the Cards' main strength in the
sprints.
Stanford has not "sprinted
down," or let off to rest before
a meet, at all this season. The

crucial meets between USC and
UCLA this weekend will test the
efficacy of the Indians' long
term conditioning.
