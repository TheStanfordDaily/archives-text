# Dow Recruiters Draw Protests
## 
### 
A trio of students in the Graduate
School of Business leafieted their
Placement Office Friday while a Dow
Chemical Company recruiter inter
viewed students.
John Schelling, Peter Ware, and
Derek Hansen pointed out Dow's role
as a napalm producer and asked their
fellow students:
While it is possible to consider a
manufacturing firm amoral, can in
dividual students justifiably lend tacit
consent to the actions of a company
whose products are killing and de
forming women and children in Viet
nam?
Commenting on the purpose of the
protest, Schelling said, "We're not say
ing Dow should be dismantled, but we
think students should be aware of
what Dow makes."
Elaborating further, Hansen ex
plained that the dual function of their
action was to make students at the
Business School think in terms of a
moral decision and realize that what
ever benefits accrue to the users of
napalm are outweighed by the moral
wrong done.
Campus Police
The three leafleting students quickly
complied with a campus police re
quest to keep their activities outside
of the building itself, in accordance
with University regulations.
Earlier, two unidentified Business

School students had grabbed a hand
ful of leaflets from Ware and tried to
block his entry to the building.
Ware expressed concern that the
campus police "seem to have come pre
pared to break up a riot."
He reaffirmed that the purpose of
the protest was not to violate the
campus regulation confining protests
to outside the building itself, but to
create an atmosphere in which their
fellow students would be forced to
think and ask questions concerning
the moral basis for the war.
Despite the protest, Glenn Allen,
Dow company recruiter, said that he
had "full schedules" in three days of
interviewing — "the best schedule
we've ever had at Stanford." Allen
said that he had encountered similar
protests earlier at San Jose State, the
University of Washington, and at Uni
versity of California campuses.
The Santa Cruz Campus newspaper,
The City on the Hill Press, published
a Dow advertisement, but refunded
the money paid for the ad, because
of the moral issue involved.
Dow Rebuttal
Dow has issued a statement en
dorsing "the right of any American
to legally and peacefully protest an
action with which he does not agree."
The statement goes on to say, "Our
position on the manufacture of napalm

is that we are a supplier of goods to
the Defense Department and not a
policy maker. We do not and should
not try to decide military strategy or
policy."
Ware said about thirty to forty fel
low students talked with the group
on Friday. "None of the discussions
were heated," he said. "Those who
were violently opposed simply ripped
up the leaflet without looking at it.
Business school students were more
willing to listen to us than they are
to David Harris or other students in
White Plaza. They're pre-conditioned
against that kind of protest "

White Plaza. They're pre-conditioned
against that kind of protest "
A trio of students in the Graduate
School of Business leafieted their
Placement Office Friday while a Dow
Chemical Company recruiter inter
viewed students.
John Schelling, Peter Ware, and
Derek Hansen pointed out Dow's role
as a napalm producer and asked their
fellow students:
While it is possible to consider a
manufacturing firm amoral, can in
dividual students justifiably lend tacit
consent to the actions of a company
whose products are killing and de
forming women and children in Viet
nam?
Commenting on the purpose of the
protest, Schelling said, "We're not say
ing Dow should be dismantled, but we
think students should be aware of
what Dow makes."
Elaborating further, Hansen ex
plained that the dual function of their
action was to make students at the
Business School think in terms of a
moral decision and realize that what
ever benefits accrue to the users of
napalm are outweighed by the moral
wrong done.
Campus Police
The three leafleting students quickly
complied with a campus police re
quest to keep their activities outside
of the building itself, in accordance
with University regulations.
Earlier, two unidentified Business

School students had grabbed a hand
ful of leaflets from Ware and tried to
block his entry to the building.
Ware expressed concern that the
campus police "seem to have come pre
pared to break up a riot."
He reaffirmed that the purpose of
the protest was not to violate the
campus regulation confining protests
to outside the building itself, but to
create an atmosphere in which their
fellow students would be forced to
think and ask questions concerning
the moral basis for the war.
Despite the protest, Glenn Allen,
Dow company recruiter, said that he
had "full schedules" in three days of
interviewing — "the best schedule
we've ever had at Stanford." Allen
said that he had encountered similar
protests earlier at San Jose State, the
University of Washington, and at Uni
versity of California campuses.
The Santa Cruz Campus newspaper,
The City on the Hill Press, published
a Dow advertisement, but refunded
the money paid for the ad, because
of the moral issue involved.
Dow Rebuttal
Dow has issued a statement en
dorsing "the right of any American
to legally and peacefully protest an
action with which he does not agree."
The statement goes on to say, "Our
position on the manufacture of napalm

is that we are a supplier of goods to
the Defense Department and not a
policy maker. We do not and should
not try to decide military strategy or
policy."
Ware said about thirty to forty fel
low students talked with the group
on Friday. "None of the discussions
were heated," he said. "Those who
were violently opposed simply ripped
up the leaflet without looking at it.
Business school students were more
willing to listen to us than they are
to David Harris or other students in
White Plaza. They're pre-conditioned
against that kind of protest "
