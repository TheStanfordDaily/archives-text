## 
### JIM MALLERY 
Stanford, falling prey to bad
hands and missed free throws,
was clobbered by the Cougars of
Washington State 82-58 Satur
day night. Tonight the Cards will
try to make amends as they go
against the University of Wash
ington in Seattle.
Washington State's victory
shoved them into second place in
AAWU standings, while Stan
ford dropped to third.
Quick Lead For Cougars
The Cougars jumped off to a
quick 7-2 lead, but after taking
time out to regather forces, the
Cards came back to tie it 9-9.
It remained a close battle un
til the closing minutes of first
half play, when the Cougars used
the same explosive punch they
opened the game with and left
the floor with a 38-27 lead.
The Cards continued their rag
ged play of the first half in the
second stanza. With their offence
completely throttled they were
able to score only 20 points to the
Cougars' 44.
Cards Comeback Fails
Stanford managed to cut a 16
point margin down to nine points
midway through the last quarter,
but more costly turnovers al
lowed the Pullman cagers to
again open up a comfortable
margin.
The Cards completely fell apart

in the last 5V6 minutes of the
game as the Cougars outscored
them 19-2.
Big Ted Wierman, State's 6'-8"
forward, led all scorers with 20
points. Three other Cougars
were also in double figures.
Stanford Scores Even
Howard Hassen and Gary Pe
tersmeyer led Stanford with 11
points apiece. Rich Baker and
substitute Mai McElwain were
next, both hitting 10 points.
McElwain was the one bright
spot for the Cards in the first
half, as he came off the bench to
dominate the boards for Stan
ford and score well.
The usually high-scoring duo
of Harris and Don Griffin was
held to 16 points, 9 for Harris
and 7 for Griffin. Griffin also
fouled out in the final minutes
of play.
Stanford was particularly im
potent from thp foul line, miss
ing 20 of their 36 attempts for
44 per cent. Washington State
hit 18 of 27 to match their sea
sonal average of 67 per cent.
