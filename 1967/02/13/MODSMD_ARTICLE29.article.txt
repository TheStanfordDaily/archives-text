# Reagan Does About-Face
## 
### MAGGIE McCOMAS 
Last Thursday '.iovernor Rea
gan was given a chance to define
his position in regard to the rela
tion of the university and his ad
ministration. He also might have
taken the opportunity, if not to
reconsider his budgetary pro
posals, at least to justify and ex
plain his tuition proposals.
The group staging Thursday's
march was, for the most part,
"his kind of people," composed
of the conservatively dressed and
clean-shaven. The rally itself was
staged in an orderly and re
strained fashion.
Noxious as the Governor's pro
posals might be, he recognized
the importance and validity of
such a mass demonstration that

day when he commended the stu
dents for this "first attempt" as
establishing lines of communica
tion in order to resolve the con
flicts which have developed over
the past month.
Yet the governor waited until
he was again behind closed doors
later that afternoon to drop a
new bomb by informing student
leaders that he not only stood
firm on the tuition proposal, but
would also work for a higher
tuition rate in the future.
Saturday's demonstration, or
ganized by the California Feder
ation of Teachers, with substan
tial student support, was some
what less appreciative of the gov
ernor's surprise appearance.
Amidst boos and jeers, Reagan
blew his cool and indicated that
he had no real intention of con
sidering the protests of such a
"close-minded" group.
Hostility
The hostility exhibited in Sat
urday's march is indicative that
impatience is growing in a hurry
among those connected with the
university system and the last
thing these people want or need
is a new credibility gap at the
level of state government admin
istration.
Reagan's about-face tactics
demonstrated his ability to play
a wide range of roles, as he com
mended the Thursday marchers
on their conduct and then re
vealed his true feeling on the tui
tion topic at his conference with
student representatives that af
ternoon.
Superficially, the hostility ex
pressed at the Saturday rally
may have abrogated any effect
ive channels of communication
initiated on Thursday. On the
other hand, the unruliness of the
Saturday marchers is to be com
mended for exposing the Govern
or's true sentiments. Apparently
the boos and chants were im
petus enough to evoke his opin
ion that the "close-minded" rep
resentatives of the university
"communities do not deserve just
consideration.
Despite Time magazine's re
port of Reagan's continuing box
office apepal to the people of Cali
fornia, his honeymoon with the
public appears to have died soon
er than expected. Talk of closed
minds seems to be particularly
out of place if, as the Governor
suggests, he really wants to rep
resent the people of California.
If he is unable to interpret his
mandate or, more probably, will
ing to misuse it, 1970 will be none
too soon for the voters to bring
on a new act.
