# LASSU: In Crowd Tyranny
## 
### FRITZ SCHAEFER 
At 7:40 Tom Forstenzer calls
to order the weekly meeting of
Stanford's most prestigious spe
cial interest group — LASSU.
The first, most dramatic, and
sometimes the only order of busi
ness is the Report of the Speak-
In his report Mr. Forstenzer
recapitulates what "we" have ac
complished during the past week.
The "we" consists of Tom For-

stenzer, Dave Harris, Tim Haight
and perhaps a few lesser lights
from time to time taken in as a
part of Harris' Great Cultural
Revolution.
And what they have accom
plished is always the same.
These student leaders, in pursu
ing their ultimate goal—to bring
Stanford University to a grind
ing halt—have done their darn
dest during the past week to de
stroy what vestiges of student-

faculty and student-administra
tion relations still exist.
Students Fail To Rally
After this review of his ef
forts during the past week, Mr.
Forstenzer explains once again,
that this week as every week, he
is sad to report that Stanford
students have not rallied behind
his valiant efforts. They just
don't seem to be interested, he
tells LASSU. !But Mr. Forsten
zer knows that even though the
student body won't support his
lunacy, his. friends in LASSU
will.
So at this point he begins the
harrange which will result in
LASSU's weekly resolution, this
one more absurd that last week's,
but of the same basic content—
students must rise up and cast
off the chains which the faculty
and administration have locked
them in- The most interesting
thing to do during Mr. Forsten
zer's plea for rebellion is to
watch the faces of his audience.
Skilled Distortions
Through the skillful manipla
tion of a well organized collec
tion of distortions of reality and
outright falsehoods, the Speaker
literally fills the minds of his
audience with his own unre
lenting contempt for his oppres
sors; the faculty and adminis
tration.
Perhaps this is how it was
during Hitler's denunciations of
the Jews. As a matter of fact,
LASSU may just pass a resolu
tion next week to send the en
tire administration and faculty,

from President Sterlin on down,
straight to the incinerators —the
final solution to the Stanford
problem.
Upon completition of his
speech, Mr. Forstenzer accepts
a motion from the floor for
LASSU's weekly resolution. The
matter is "debated" at length
to make its wording more force
ful if necessary. Only those per
sons basically in favor of the res
olution are allowed to discuss it.
Opposition is effectively stifled
by not recognizing representa
tives whose views are alien to
the Speaker. If such a represen
tative is unrecognized and gains
the floor (such as I did last
week), Mr. Forsternzer wastes
little time in ruling him "out of
order," and continuing the dis
cussion.
Then It's Over
At 9:15 LASSU passes its
weekly resolution. Simultaneous
ly the representatives begin to
trickle out the door-
The Report of the President
is next. Unfortunately Mr. Har
ris is often unable to attend
LASSU meetings due to more
pressing matters, whatever that
means. In this case there is no
longer a majority of LASSU
members present and the meet
ing is adjourned due to lack of a
quorum. And we haven't even
made it to New Business yet!
(The next edition of this col
umn will contain a look at one
of the occasional Reports of the
President and some facts to de
bunk the myth that LASSU rep
resents students.)

on first and Liu's on second, then Lin's on third?' 'No, Llns on
second and Mao's on third." 'Then if . .

At 7:40 Tom Forstenzer calls
to order the weekly meeting of
Stanford's most prestigious spe
cial interest group — LASSU.
The first, most dramatic, and
sometimes the only order of busi
ness is the Report of the Speak-
In his report Mr. Forstenzer
recapitulates what "we" have ac
complished during the past week.
The "we" consists of Tom For-

stenzer, Dave Harris, Tim Haight
and perhaps a few lesser lights
from time to time taken in as a
part of Harris' Great Cultural
Revolution.
And what they have accom
plished is always the same.
These student leaders, in pursu
ing their ultimate goal—to bring
Stanford University to a grind
ing halt—have done their darn
dest during the past week to de
stroy what vestiges of student-

faculty and student-administra
tion relations still exist.
Students Fail To Rally
After this review of his ef
forts during the past week, Mr.
Forstenzer explains once again,
that this week as every week, he
is sad to report that Stanford
students have not rallied behind
his valiant efforts. They just
don't seem to be interested, he
tells LASSU. !But Mr. Forsten
zer knows that even though the
student body won't support his
lunacy, his. friends in LASSU
will.
So at this point he begins the
harrange which will result in
LASSU's weekly resolution, this
one more absurd that last week's,
but of the same basic content—
students must rise up and cast
off the chains which the faculty
and administration have locked
them in- The most interesting
thing to do during Mr. Forsten
zer's plea for rebellion is to
watch the faces of his audience.
Skilled Distortions
Through the skillful manipla
tion of a well organized collec
tion of distortions of reality and
outright falsehoods, the Speaker
literally fills the minds of his
audience with his own unre
lenting contempt for his oppres
sors; the faculty and adminis
tration.
Perhaps this is how it was
during Hitler's denunciations of
the Jews. As a matter of fact,
LASSU may just pass a resolu
tion next week to send the en
tire administration and faculty,

from President Sterlin on down,
straight to the incinerators —the
final solution to the Stanford
problem.
Upon completition of his
speech, Mr. Forstenzer accepts
a motion from the floor for
LASSU's weekly resolution. The
matter is "debated" at length
to make its wording more force
ful if necessary. Only those per
sons basically in favor of the res
olution are allowed to discuss it.
Opposition is effectively stifled
by not recognizing representa
tives whose views are alien to
the Speaker. If such a represen
tative is unrecognized and gains
the floor (such as I did last
week), Mr. Forsternzer wastes
little time in ruling him "out of
order," and continuing the dis
cussion.
Then It's Over
At 9:15 LASSU passes its
weekly resolution. Simultaneous
ly the representatives begin to
trickle out the door-
The Report of the President
is next. Unfortunately Mr. Har
ris is often unable to attend
LASSU meetings due to more
pressing matters, whatever that
means. In this case there is no
longer a majority of LASSU
members present and the meet
ing is adjourned due to lack of a
quorum. And we haven't even
made it to New Business yet!
