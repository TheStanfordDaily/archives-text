## Defense Of Dow: Service To Freedom 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
We would like to voice our
storng disagreement with the let
ter from the "Stanford Faculty
and Staff for Peace in Vietnam,"
printed on Tuesday, February 7.
We believe that our country's
present position in Southeast
Asia is essentially right, morally
and otherwise. Indeed, we
that we have an obligation to de
fend free people from oppression
and terrorism—terrorism which
is ignored completely by those
who cry that our efforts are kill
ing civilians. We therefore de
plore attacks on companies
which find it their duty to supply
our government.
The technical statements of

the above-mentioned letter ap
pear to be misleading. The poly
styrene thickner is intended, we
expect, to prevent unwanted
spreading and diffusion of Na
palm B, thereby allowing Ameri
can pilots to destroy en< my tar
gets with added precision while
avoiding injuring nearby civil
ians. This care and precision in
selection of targets has been the
paramount concern of U.S. air
power throughout the Vietnam
war.
Those of us (the undersigned)
who are students of science and
engineering look forward to
working with American indus
tries, and we wholehartedly en
courage our colleagues to do so.

Editor, The Daily :
Once upon a time the legisla
ture of Standard University
passed a bill making it a crime
for a student to serve on an un
approved committee. A list of un

approved committoes was pub
lished, and all students were re
quired to sign a loyalty oath,
swearing that they were not and
never had been a member of an
unapproved committee.
The legislature's committee on
unstudent activities investigated
suspected cases of lists of stu

being front organizations for un

Editor, The Daily:
We have followed with interest
the current controversy concern
ing Dow Chemical Company.
Economics and common sense
suggest an approach which has
not to our knowledge been pre
sented for consideration.
Consider the effect of the ex
tant boycott of Dow Saran-Wrap
and Dow Bathroom Cleaner.
Sales of Saran-Wrap and Bath
room Cleaner will plummet, thus
encouraging the production of
polystyrene (for napalm), as the
marginal profitability of Saran-
Wrap and Bathroom Cleaner,
with respect to polystyrene, will
decrease.
Consider the purfuit (sic) of
the opposite course. If everyone
would fill all spare nooks and
crannies with sticky mounds of
Saran-Wrap and endless stacks
of Bathroom CI aner, then the
Dow Chemical Company could
no longer afford to produce poly
styrene for use in napalm.
As such stacks and mounds
have little aesthetic value and
small utility, we suggest a third
course of action:
Each member of the faculty or
staff who is opopsed to Dow
Chemical policies would borrow
a month's salary from the Stan
ford Federal Credit Union. The
money thus realized would be
used to purchase Common shares
in the Dow Chemical Company.
These new stockholders would
appear and express their views
at the next stockholders' meeting
of Dow. The resultant publicity
would attract the attention of
Wall Street to the profits which
Dow has realized from its partici
pation in the war effort, and the
value of Dow shares would rise.
The participating members of
this plan would then sell their
Dow shares, using the profits
thus realized to finance future
protests.

We have followed with interest
the current controversy concern
ing Dow Chemical Company.
Economics and common sense
suggest an approach which has
not to our knowledge been pre
sented for consideration.
Consider the effect of the ex
tant boycott of Dow Saran-Wrap
and Dow Bathroom Cleaner.
Sales of Saran-Wrap and Bath
room Cleaner will plummet, thus
encouraging the production of
polystyrene (for napalm), as the
marginal profitability of Saran-
Wrap and Bathroom Cleaner,
with respect to polystyrene, will
decrease.
Consider the purfuit (sic) of
the opposite course. If everyone
would fill all spare nooks and
crannies with sticky mounds of
Saran-Wrap and endless stacks
of Bathroom CI aner, then the
Dow Chemical Company could
no longer afford to produce poly
styrene for use in napalm.
As such stacks and mounds
have little aesthetic value and
small utility, we suggest a third
course of action:
Each member of the faculty or
staff who is opopsed to Dow
Chemical policies would borrow
a month's salary from the Stan
ford Federal Credit Union. The
money thus realized would be
used to purchase Common shares
in the Dow Chemical Company.
These new stockholders would
appear and express their views
at the next stockholders' meeting
of Dow. The resultant publicity
would attract the attention of
Wall Street to the profits which
Dow has realized from its partici
pation in the war effort, and the
value of Dow shares would rise.
The participating members of
this plan would then sell their
Dow shares, using the profits
thus realized to finance future
protests.

We would like to voice our
storng disagreement with the let
ter from the "Stanford Faculty
and Staff for Peace in Vietnam,"
printed on Tuesday, February 7.
We believe that our country's
present position in Southeast
Asia is essentially right, morally
and otherwise. Indeed, we
that we have an obligation to de
fend free people from oppression
and terrorism—terrorism which
is ignored completely by those
who cry that our efforts are kill
ing civilians. We therefore de
plore attacks on companies
which find it their duty to supply
our government.
The technical statements of

the above-mentioned letter ap
pear to be misleading. The poly
styrene thickner is intended, we
expect, to prevent unwanted
spreading and diffusion of Na
palm B, thereby allowing Ameri
can pilots to destroy en< my tar
gets with added precision while
avoiding injuring nearby civil
ians. This care and precision in
selection of targets has been the
paramount concern of U.S. air
power throughout the Vietnam
war.
Those of us (the undersigned)
who are students of science and
engineering look forward to
working with American indus
tries, and we wholehartedly en
courage our colleagues to do so.

• Fairy Tale?
Editor, The Daily :
Once upon a time the legisla
ture of Standard University
passed a bill making it a crime
for a student to serve on an un
approved committee. A list of un

approved committoes was pub
lished, and all students were re
quired to sign a loyalty oath,
swearing that they were not and
never had been a member of an
unapproved committee.
The legislature's committee on
unstudent activities investigated
suspected cases of lists of stu
dent organizations suspected of
being front organizations for un
approved committees. Students
suspected of being members of
unapproved committoes de
nounced by members of the legis
lature as Red and Whites since
Standard University's colors
were not chosen by an approved
committee . . . 808 McCOWN

• Wall Street Ruin
Editor, The Daily:
We have followed with interest
the current controversy concern
ing Dow Chemical Company.
Economics and common sense
suggest an approach which has
not to our knowledge been pre
sented for consideration.
Consider the effect of the ex
tant boycott of Dow Saran-Wrap
and Dow Bathroom Cleaner.
Sales of Saran-Wrap and Bath
room Cleaner will plummet, thus
encouraging the production of
polystyrene (for napalm), as the
marginal profitability of Saran-
Wrap and Bathroom Cleaner,
with respect to polystyrene, will
decrease.
Consider the purfuit (sic) of
the opposite course. If everyone
would fill all spare nooks and
crannies with sticky mounds of
Saran-Wrap and endless stacks
of Bathroom CI aner, then the
Dow Chemical Company could
no longer afford to produce poly
styrene for use in napalm.
As such stacks and mounds
have little aesthetic value and
small utility, we suggest a third
course of action:
Each member of the faculty or
staff who is opopsed to Dow
Chemical policies would borrow
a month's salary from the Stan
ford Federal Credit Union. The
money thus realized would be
used to purchase Common shares
in the Dow Chemical Company.
These new stockholders would
appear and express their views
at the next stockholders' meeting
of Dow. The resultant publicity
would attract the attention of
Wall Street to the profits which
Dow has realized from its partici
pation in the war effort, and the
value of Dow shares would rise.
The participating members of
this plan would then sell their
Dow shares, using the profits
thus realized to finance future
protests.
