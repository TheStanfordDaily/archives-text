# Packer Letter—Non-Cooperation
## 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
I'd like to start by registering
a mild complaint about "lack of
communication." I don't mean
the Aesopian version fostered by
Messrs. Harris and Forstenzer,
which translates as "you didn't
do what I wanted you to." What
I mean is, simply and literally,
lack of communication.
If Messrs. Lubbock and Muller
had taken the trouble to check
with me or Dean Hind before
rushing into print with their "un
told tales behind closed doors,"
they might have written a some
what different story. Then again,
they might not have. But at least
they'd have given themselves a
chance to be responsible news
papermen.
The facts as I see them are as
follows: The Planning Commit
tee for The Study, which includ
ed Mr. Harris, recommended that
students serve as full voting
members of the Executive (or as
we call it, Steering) Committee
for the Study. I concurred in that
view, as did the other faculty
members of the Planning Com
mittee. I don't know whether or
not Mr. Harris did, because he
missed the last two out of the
five meetings of the Planning
Committee.
It was generally agreed that
the Steering Committee should
not be viewed as representing
any constituencies or interests
and that the President should
choose the members solely on the
basis of the qualities they could
bring to the task. Again, I'm not
sure whether Mr. Harris agreed
with that concept, since he may
or may not have been there when
it was discussed. However, I am
sure that he never voiced a con
trary view, because he took little
part in the discussion when he
was there. The other student
member of the Planning Com

mittee, Miss Nichols, did not ex
press a contrary view as I re
call.
The Planning Committee's con
cept of how the Steering Com
mittee should be constituted was,
in my judgment, the only basis
upon which the enterprise could
be viable. The wide range of is
sues that would necessarily be
raised in the Study, the free
and open kind of inquiry called
for, made it imperative that the
participants should approach
their task with no external
constraints.
In particular, the idea of hav
ing members speak for THE
student body, THE faculty, or
THE administration, was foreign
to the stpirit of the Study. TTie
time for "political" scrutiny by
"constituencies" would come lat
er when specific proposals for
action emerged- The Study and
those who are engaged in it
would have no "power" other
than the persuasiveness of the
ideas they put forward.
When the President asked me
to take charge of the Study,
we agreed that the selection of
members for the Steering Com
mittee should be governed by the
Planning Committee's concept.
The President selected the fac
ulty members on the basis of
his knowledge of their qualifica
tions, as reinforced by discus
sion with his staff and with va
rious members of the faculty.
The selection of student mem
bers posed a different and harder
problem. We could have simply
relied on suggestions submitted
by various people, including
Messrs. Harris and Forstenzer.
Indeed, we started down that
road but soon became aware of
its inadequacy because it left no
opportunity for the student body
as a whole to express interest.

Consequently, Dean Hind and I
recommended to the President
that he issue a general invitation
to the student body to apply for
membership on the Steering
Committee. This the President
did on January 18. The response
was gratifying — over eighty
statements of interest.
Meanwhile, Mr. Forstenzer and
others had raised the issue of
student participation in the selec
tion process. Our response has
been consistently based on the
Planning Committee concept:
the Steering Committee for the
Study does not "represent" con
stituencies ; political criteria are
inappropriate for selection of the
membership; the selection pro
cess would benefit from student
participation; to that end repre
sentatives of LASSU and ASSU
were welcome to join in screen
ing the applications.
Specifically, we invited Messrs.
Harris and Forstenzer to read
through our file of applications,
to advise us in selecting for inter
views, to sit in with us on the
interviews, to express their views
about selection criteria and the
identity of the best candidates.
We never heard from Mr. Harris.
Mr. Forstenzer did attend a few
of the interviews but did not par
ticipate in the discussion, per
haps because he disagreed with
the conditions under which stu
dent participation occurred.
Mr, Forstenzer also delegated
two members of LASSU to ap
pear in his place. One of these,
Steve McMillan, spent an entire
morning with us and then joined
us in evaluating the people with
whom we had talked. While he
made it clear that he was partici
pating as an individual rather
than as a LASSU representative,
we found Mr. McMillan's help
very valuable. (It is interesting

to note that the Lubbock-Muller
"inside story" did not mention
Mr. McMillan's participation.)
The same day, Dave Stepner sat
with us and participated in the
interviews although not in the
evaluation.
In sum, then, student partici
pation in the selection process
consisted of three students, one
at a time, sitting in on a total
of two-thirds of the interviews.
No students "advised" on screen
ing the initial eighty applications
(as reported in Friday's Daily)
for the simple reason that al
though invited (as unreported in
Friday's Daily), Messrs. Harris
and Forstenzer did not find it
convenient to do so.
It is easy to understand this
minimal studont participation. It
took each of half a day to read
through eighty application. More
time was consumed in settling on
a smaller group to be inter
viewed. The interviews took a
total of over ten hours, spread
over three days. It would have
taken a strong interest in the
merits, as opposed to an interest
in scoring political points, for
Mr. Harris or Mr. Forstenzer to
persevere. Their failure to do so
is no surprise. What is rather
surprising is the conversion of
that failure into some kind of
badge of virtue.
I do not propose to dofend the
Study, its purposes and methods.
It will stand or fall on its own
merits. What I do wish to say is
simply this: Those who
with Mr. Harris' reported exhor
tation in White Plaza that stu
dents should boycott the Study
betray a preference for the ir
rationality of confrontation poli
tics over the reasoned discussion
of educational policies.

Steve McMillan, spent an entire
morning with us and then joined
us in evaluating the people with
whom we had talked. While he
made it clear that he was partici
pating as an individual rather
than as a LASSU representative,
we found Mr. McMillan's help
very valuable. (It is interesting

to note that the Lubbock-Muller
"inside story" did not mention
Mr. McMillan's participation.)
The same day, Dave Stepner sat
with us and participated in the
interviews although not in the
evaluation.
In sum, then, student partici
pation in the selection process
consisted of three students, one
at a time, sitting in on a total
of two-thirds of the interviews.
No students "advised" on screen
ing the initial eighty applications
(as reported in Friday's Daily)
for the simple reason that al
though invited (as unreported in
Friday's Daily), Messrs. Harris
and Forstenzer did not find it
convenient to do so.
It is easy to understand this
minimal studont participation. It
took each of half a day to read
through eighty application. More
time was consumed in settling on
a smaller group to be inter
viewed. The interviews took a
total of over ten hours, spread
over three days. It would have
taken a strong interest in the
merits, as opposed to an interest
in scoring political points, for
Mr. Harris or Mr. Forstenzer to
persevere. Their failure to do so
is no surprise. What is rather
surprising is the conversion of
that failure into some kind of
badge of virtue.
I do not propose to dofend the
Study, its purposes and methods.
It will stand or fall on its own
merits. What I do wish to say is
simply this: Those who
with Mr. Harris' reported exhor
tation in White Plaza that stu
dents should boycott the Study
betray a preference for the ir
rationality of confrontation poli
tics over the reasoned discussion
of educational policies.
HERBERT L. PACKER
Vice-Provost
Editor, The Daily:
I'd like to start by registering
a mild complaint about "lack of
communication." I don't mean
the Aesopian version fostered by
Messrs. Harris and Forstenzer,
which translates as "you didn't
do what I wanted you to." What
I mean is, simply and literally,
lack of communication.
If Messrs. Lubbock and Muller
had taken the trouble to check
with me or Dean Hind before
rushing into print with their "un
told tales behind closed doors,"
they might have written a some
what different story. Then again,
they might not have. But at least
they'd have given themselves a
chance to be responsible news
papermen.
The facts as I see them are as
follows: The Planning Commit
tee for The Study, which includ
ed Mr. Harris, recommended that
students serve as full voting
members of the Executive (or as
we call it, Steering) Committee
for the Study. I concurred in that
view, as did the other faculty
members of the Planning Com
mittee. I don't know whether or
not Mr. Harris did, because he
missed the last two out of the
five meetings of the Planning
Committee.
It was generally agreed that
the Steering Committee should
not be viewed as representing
any constituencies or interests
and that the President should
choose the members solely on the
basis of the qualities they could
bring to the task. Again, I'm not
sure whether Mr. Harris agreed
with that concept, since he may
or may not have been there when
it was discussed. However, I am
sure that he never voiced a con
trary view, because he took little
part in the discussion when he
was there. The other student
member of the Planning Com

mittee, Miss Nichols, did not ex
press a contrary view as I re
call.
The Planning Committee's con
cept of how the Steering Com
mittee should be constituted was,
in my judgment, the only basis
upon which the enterprise could
be viable. The wide range of is
sues that would necessarily be
raised in the Study, the free
and open kind of inquiry called
for, made it imperative that the
participants should approach
their task with no external
constraints.
In particular, the idea of hav
ing members speak for THE
student body, THE faculty, or
THE administration, was foreign
to the stpirit of the Study. TTie
time for "political" scrutiny by
"constituencies" would come lat
er when specific proposals for
action emerged- The Study and
those who are engaged in it
would have no "power" other
than the persuasiveness of the
ideas they put forward.
When the President asked me
to take charge of the Study,
we agreed that the selection of
members for the Steering Com
mittee should be governed by the
Planning Committee's concept.
The President selected the fac
ulty members on the basis of
his knowledge of their qualifica
tions, as reinforced by discus
sion with his staff and with va
rious members of the faculty.
The selection of student mem
bers posed a different and harder
problem. We could have simply
relied on suggestions submitted
by various people, including
Messrs. Harris and Forstenzer.
Indeed, we started down that
road but soon became aware of
its inadequacy because it left no
opportunity for the student body
as a whole to express interest.

Consequently, Dean Hind and I
recommended to the President
that he issue a general invitation
to the student body to apply for
membership on the Steering
Committee. This the President
did on January 18. The response
was gratifying — over eighty
statements of interest.
Meanwhile, Mr. Forstenzer and
others had raised the issue of
student participation in the selec
tion process. Our response has
been consistently based on the
Planning Committee concept:
the Steering Committee for the
Study does not "represent" con
stituencies ; political criteria are
inappropriate for selection of the
membership; the selection pro
cess would benefit from student
participation; to that end repre
sentatives of LASSU and ASSU
were welcome to join in screen
ing the applications.
Specifically, we invited Messrs.
Harris and Forstenzer to read
through our file of applications,
to advise us in selecting for inter
views, to sit in with us on the
interviews, to express their views
about selection criteria and the
identity of the best candidates.
We never heard from Mr. Harris.
Mr. Forstenzer did attend a few
of the interviews but did not par
ticipate in the discussion, per
haps because he disagreed with
the conditions under which stu
dent participation occurred.
Mr, Forstenzer also delegated
two members of LASSU to ap
pear in his place. One of these,

to take charge of the Study,
we agreed that the selection of
members for the Steering Com
mittee should be governed by the
Planning Committee's concept.
The President selected the fac
ulty members on the basis of
his knowledge of their qualifica
tions, as reinforced by discus
sion with his staff and with va
rious members of the faculty.
The selection of student mem
bers posed a different and harder
problem. We could have simply
relied on suggestions submitted
by various people, including
Messrs. Harris and Forstenzer.
Indeed, we started down that
road but soon became aware of
its inadequacy because it left no
opportunity for the student body
as a whole to express interest.

Consequently, Dean Hind and I
recommended to the President
that he issue a general invitation
to the student body to apply for
membership on the Steering
Committee. This the President
did on January 18. The response
was gratifying — over eighty
statements of interest.
Meanwhile, Mr. Forstenzer and
others had raised the issue of
student participation in the selec
tion process. Our response has
been consistently based on the
Planning Committee concept:
the Steering Committee for the
Study does not "represent" con
stituencies ; political criteria are
inappropriate for selection of the
membership; the selection pro
cess would benefit from student
participation; to that end repre
sentatives of LASSU and ASSU
were welcome to join in screen
ing the applications.
Specifically, we invited Messrs.
Harris and Forstenzer to read
through our file of applications,
to advise us in selecting for inter
views, to sit in with us on the
interviews, to express their views
about selection criteria and the
identity of the best candidates.
We never heard from Mr. Harris.
Mr. Forstenzer did attend a few
of the interviews but did not par
ticipate in the discussion, per
haps because he disagreed with
the conditions under which stu
dent participation occurred.
Mr, Forstenzer also delegated
two members of LASSU to ap
pear in his place. One of these,
Steve McMillan, spent an entire
morning with us and then joined
us in evaluating the people with
whom we had talked. While he
made it clear that he was partici
pating as an individual rather
than as a LASSU representative,
we found Mr. McMillan's help
very valuable. (It is interesting

to note that the Lubbock-Muller
"inside story" did not mention
Mr. McMillan's participation.)
The same day, Dave Stepner sat
with us and participated in the
interviews although not in the
evaluation.
In sum, then, student partici
pation in the selection process
consisted of three students, one
at a time, sitting in on a total
of two-thirds of the interviews.
No students "advised" on screen
ing the initial eighty applications
(as reported in Friday's Daily)
for the simple reason that al
though invited (as unreported in
Friday's Daily), Messrs. Harris
and Forstenzer did not find it
convenient to do so.
It is easy to understand this
minimal studont participation. It
took each of half a day to read
through eighty application. More
time was consumed in settling on
a smaller group to be inter
viewed. The interviews took a
total of over ten hours, spread
over three days. It would have
taken a strong interest in the
merits, as opposed to an interest
in scoring political points, for
Mr. Harris or Mr. Forstenzer to
persevere. Their failure to do so
is no surprise. What is rather
surprising is the conversion of
that failure into some kind of
badge of virtue.
I do not propose to dofend the
Study, its purposes and methods.
It will stand or fall on its own
merits. What I do wish to say is
simply this: Those who
with Mr. Harris' reported exhor
tation in White Plaza that stu
dents should boycott the Study
betray a preference for the ir
rationality of confrontation poli
tics over the reasoned discussion
of educational policies.
HERBERT L. PACKER

Editor, The Daily:
I'd like to start by registering
a mild complaint about "lack of
communication." I don't mean
the Aesopian version fostered by
Messrs. Harris and Forstenzer,
which translates as "you didn't
do what I wanted you to." What
I mean is, simply and literally,
lack of communication.
If Messrs. Lubbock and Muller
had taken the trouble to check
with me or Dean Hind before
rushing into print with their "un
told tales behind closed doors,"
they might have written a some
what different story. Then again,
they might not have. But at least
they'd have given themselves a
chance to be responsible news
papermen.
The facts as I see them are as
follows: The Planning Commit
tee for The Study, which includ
ed Mr. Harris, recommended that
students serve as full voting
members of the Executive (or as
we call it, Steering) Committee
for the Study. I concurred in that
view, as did the other faculty
members of the Planning Com
mittee. I don't know whether or
not Mr. Harris did, because he
missed the last two out of the
five meetings of the Planning
Committee.
It was generally agreed that
the Steering Committee should
not be viewed as representing
any constituencies or interests
and that the President should
choose the members solely on the
basis of the qualities they could
bring to the task. Again, I'm not
sure whether Mr. Harris agreed
with that concept, since he may
or may not have been there when
it was discussed. However, I am
sure that he never voiced a con
trary view, because he took little
part in the discussion when he
was there. The other student
member of the Planning Com

mittee, Miss Nichols, did not ex
press a contrary view as I re
call.
The Planning Committee's con
cept of how the Steering Com
mittee should be constituted was,
in my judgment, the only basis
upon which the enterprise could
be viable. The wide range of is
sues that would necessarily be
raised in the Study, the free
and open kind of inquiry called
for, made it imperative that the
participants should approach
their task with no external
constraints.
In particular, the idea of hav
ing members speak for THE
student body, THE faculty, or
THE administration, was foreign
to the stpirit of the Study. TTie
time for "political" scrutiny by
"constituencies" would come lat
er when specific proposals for
action emerged- The Study and
those who are engaged in it
would have no "power" other
than the persuasiveness of the
ideas they put forward.

papermen.
The facts as I see them are as
follows: The Planning Commit
tee for The Study, which includ
ed Mr. Harris, recommended that
students serve as full voting
members of the Executive (or as
we call it, Steering) Committee
for the Study. I concurred in that
view, as did the other faculty
members of the Planning Com
mittee. I don't know whether or
not Mr. Harris did, because he
missed the last two out of the
five meetings of the Planning
Committee.
It was generally agreed that
the Steering Committee should
not be viewed as representing
any constituencies or interests
and that the President should
choose the members solely on the
basis of the qualities they could
bring to the task. Again, I'm not
sure whether Mr. Harris agreed
with that concept, since he may
or may not have been there when
it was discussed. However, I am
sure that he never voiced a con
trary view, because he took little
part in the discussion when he
was there. The other student
member of the Planning Com

mittee, Miss Nichols, did not ex
press a contrary view as I re
call.
The Planning Committee's con
cept of how the Steering Com
mittee should be constituted was,
in my judgment, the only basis
upon which the enterprise could
be viable. The wide range of is
sues that would necessarily be
raised in the Study, the free
and open kind of inquiry called
for, made it imperative that the
participants should approach
their task with no external
constraints.
In particular, the idea of hav
ing members speak for THE
student body, THE faculty, or
THE administration, was foreign
to the stpirit of the Study. TTie
time for "political" scrutiny by
"constituencies" would come lat
er when specific proposals for
action emerged- The Study and
those who are engaged in it
would have no "power" other
than the persuasiveness of the
ideas they put forward.
When the President asked me
to take charge of the Study,
we agreed that the selection of
members for the Steering Com
mittee should be governed by the
Planning Committee's concept.
The President selected the fac
ulty members on the basis of
his knowledge of their qualifica
tions, as reinforced by discus
sion with his staff and with va
rious members of the faculty.
The selection of student mem
bers posed a different and harder
problem. We could have simply
relied on suggestions submitted
by various people, including
Messrs. Harris and Forstenzer.
Indeed, we started down that
road but soon became aware of
its inadequacy because it left no
opportunity for the student body
as a whole to express interest.

Consequently, Dean Hind and I
recommended to the President
that he issue a general invitation
to the student body to apply for
membership on the Steering
Committee. This the President
did on January 18. The response
was gratifying — over eighty
statements of interest.
Meanwhile, Mr. Forstenzer and
others had raised the issue of
student participation in the selec
tion process. Our response has
been consistently based on the
Planning Committee concept:
the Steering Committee for the
Study does not "represent" con
stituencies ; political criteria are
inappropriate for selection of the
membership; the selection pro
cess would benefit from student
participation; to that end repre
sentatives of LASSU and ASSU
were welcome to join in screen
ing the applications.
Specifically, we invited Messrs.
Harris and Forstenzer to read
through our file of applications,
to advise us in selecting for inter
views, to sit in with us on the
interviews, to express their views
about selection criteria and the
identity of the best candidates.
We never heard from Mr. Harris.
Mr. Forstenzer did attend a few
of the interviews but did not par
ticipate in the discussion, per
haps because he disagreed with
the conditions under which stu
dent participation occurred.
Mr, Forstenzer also delegated
two members of LASSU to ap
pear in his place. One of these,
Steve McMillan, spent an entire
morning with us and then joined
us in evaluating the people with
whom we had talked. While he
made it clear that he was partici
pating as an individual rather
than as a LASSU representative,
we found Mr. McMillan's help
very valuable. (It is interesting

to note that the Lubbock-Muller
"inside story" did not mention
Mr. McMillan's participation.)
The same day, Dave Stepner sat
with us and participated in the
interviews although not in the
evaluation.
In sum, then, student partici
pation in the selection process
consisted of three students, one
at a time, sitting in on a total
of two-thirds of the interviews.
No students "advised" on screen
ing the initial eighty applications
(as reported in Friday's Daily)
for the simple reason that al
though invited (as unreported in
Friday's Daily), Messrs. Harris
and Forstenzer did not find it
convenient to do so.
It is easy to understand this
minimal studont participation. It
took each of half a day to read
through eighty application. More
time was consumed in settling on
a smaller group to be inter
viewed. The interviews took a
total of over ten hours, spread
over three days. It would have
taken a strong interest in the
merits, as opposed to an interest
in scoring political points, for
Mr. Harris or Mr. Forstenzer to
persevere. Their failure to do so
is no surprise. What is rather
surprising is the conversion of
that failure into some kind of
badge of virtue.
I do not propose to dofend the
Study, its purposes and methods.
It will stand or fall on its own
merits. What I do wish to say is
simply this: Those who
with Mr. Harris' reported exhor
tation in White Plaza that stu
dents should boycott the Study
betray a preference for the ir
rationality of confrontation poli
tics over the reasoned discussion
of educational policies.

Editor, The Daily:
I'd like to start by registering
a mild complaint about "lack of
communication." I don't mean
the Aesopian version fostered by
Messrs. Harris and Forstenzer,
which translates as "you didn't
do what I wanted you to." What
I mean is, simply and literally,
lack of communication.
If Messrs. Lubbock and Muller
had taken the trouble to check
with me or Dean Hind before
rushing into print with their "un
told tales behind closed doors,"
they might have written a some
what different story. Then again,
they might not have. But at least
they'd have given themselves a
chance to be responsible news
papermen.
