## Boy Friend Displays 'Great' Talents 
### BRUCE MERRY 
Take in the Ram's Head The Boy Friend be
cause it's a great show. Excellent song and dance
routines combine with infectious acting to carry
off the latest Ram's Head production in the Little
Theater on Campus.
Sandy Wilson's The Boy Friend was written
as a light-hearted parody on the musical comedy of
the 1920'5. It's a caricature of the Europe that F.
Scott Fitzgerald discovered after the first world
war: foppish men in boaters and angular flat-chest
ed women knee-stepping the Charleston.
The scene is Nice, France, a finishing school
where all the girls are ever-so rather breathless
about "That certain thing called a boy friend."
After intricate sub-plots the girls get engaged to a
row of gents in yellow bow-ties and cricket blazers-
Their teacher gets realigned with a millionaire
who made the grade with her on Armistice Night.
His wn daughter, also a pupil at the school, col
lects an aristocratic Oxford flunk-out and they all
love happily ever after.
The chorus of schoolgirls and their French suit
ors was really good news. They cavorted around
the stage in consistently well-staged dance num
bers: for a group of eight they meshed nicely,
and the girls snapped out their songs in time with
legs and thighs that left—how should one say—
no stone unturned.

Ronee Blakley invited attention as Maisie, the
most daring of their number. Becky "I-may-look
innocent-but-really-I'm-not" Whitehouse perfectly
captured the spirit of fluttering eye-lashes and vi
carious frolicking. Wendy Weiner and Susan Baker
brought up a well-padded rear amongst lorgnettes
and centrifugal necklaces.
Music was conceded from behind the stage by
the Bearcats, who must have been neutered for
the show. There was no need for this band to look
so bored and squeeze out each note as if it carried
a price-tag.
Feeding-Time
But their playing was accurate and they were
somewhat hampered by a green curtain that
clanked up and down on chains each time they had
to proffer a number. Unlocked like penguins at
feeding-time, the Bearcats alternated in black and
white tuxedos.
Jennifer Schneider was cool and graceful as Ma
dame Dubonnet, the Principal of the finishing
school. Undulating usefully, she eased William Wil
liams, as the millionaire Pervical Browne, into
another of the marriage arrangements. The latter,
coping manfully with a scruffy suit at least three
sizes too large for him, succumbed gallently to the
physical charms of Miss Schneider, herself wrapped
in a charteristically unflattering pink sheath from
the Ram's Head wardrobe.

Among the men Alan Mokler was nice as the
ham-fisted American: he sprang through and over
the furniture, clutched at his cloth-cap and choked
out his marriage proposal to Maisie with the con
fidence of someone fishing for a lost shirt in the
laundry.
Morals Charge
Meanwhile Ronee Blakley features at the carni
val party as Midriff Maisie, always, one felt, within
inches of a morals charge. Her impeccable navel
was a key member of the cast, infinitely more so
than the tasteless parody of a palsied woman that
was pushed on and off between the wings in the
beach scene-
A slow-motion chase across the back of the stage
and a tango that suggested the Lone Ranger try
ing a Flamenco led into mass-dancing and the fi
nale: reprises by the entire cast of the two best
numbers in the show "A Room In Bloomsbury"
and"I Could Be Happy With You."
Of the other songs Maisie's "There's Safety In
Numbers" with the four men was well taken.
Like others it included Charleston steps that verged
on an exceeding rheumatic Can-Can: pre-Hippy
steps like the Charleston and the Quickstep should
have been difficult but not impossible.
Desipte a small stage and a limited budget the
Ram's Head Boy Friend is a great show.
