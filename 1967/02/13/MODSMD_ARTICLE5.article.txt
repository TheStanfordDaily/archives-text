# Housing Comm Proposes Integrated Coed Dorms
## 
### CHRISTOPHER HARGROVE 
The ASSU Housing Commission has
proposed a bold experiment in under
graduate housing, including coed dor
mitories and the integration of fresh
men and upperclassmen.
The proposal is contained in a 62-
page report to be released Wednesday
after four months of research, deliber
ation and discussion.
In the report of the Subcommittee
for Freshman Year, which was co
chaired by Health Service Director Dr.
Maurice M. Osborne Jr. and Wilbur
head sponsor Scott Soames, the "Wil
bur Experiment" is put forth as the
best possibility for curing the present
system's deficiencies.
If the subcommittee's recommenda
tions are adopted by the University,
next fall each Wilbur house would
have two floors for men and one floor
for women. In addition .every house
would have three upperclassmen for
each freshman.
The leftover freshman women
would live in Roble and Florence
Moore. The remaining freshman men
would move into Branner and Stern.
The other dormitories and houses
would be unaffected by the change.
The report says the ideal ratio of
men to women in a co-ed house is one
to-one, but that two-to-one is accept
able. It suggests as a long-range goal
changing the admissions ratio to one
to-one. It also suggests that freshmen
should ideally constitute 30 per cent
of a house's population.
The subcommittee also discussed
the importance of maintaining diverse
types of housing on the campus and

maintaining diversity within each
house.
In addition to "shuffling bodies," the
report says, the new housing arrange
ments should provide close contacts
with the faculty, closer than exist un
der the present faculty resident ar
rangement. It also proposes experi
mentation with varieties of self-gov
ernment, expansion of the role of tu
tors and immediate elimination of the
resident assistant positions. The lat
ter, according to the committee, are
ineffective as disciplinarians and un
necessary as counselors. Eventually,

Other sections of the Housing Com
missions report will be covered in
The Daily tomorrow and Wednesday,
and the full text of the report will
be published sometime this week..

the report says, there will be no need
for sponsors, either.
Another proposal is to set up five of
the Wilbur Houses around various aca
demic or social themes, make another
an international house and leave the
other two unstructured.
The committee report attacks the
present freshman housing system as
serving "to reinforce natural anxieties
among the newest members of the Uni
versity, and to promote the seeking of
solutions to this anxiety that have little
if anything to do with educational pur
poses, but tend to promote premature
and mutuaHy exclusive social group
ings."
The report also criticizes segregated

freshman housing for encouraging
"the seeking of achievement symbols
(i.e. grades) rather than knowledge of
self or substance." In addition, it says,
the system tends "to aggravate the na
tural ambivalence of freshmen to
wards authority..., and to provide too
much pressure for distortion and rit
ualization of relationships between the
sexes."

The Subcommittee for Freshman
Year was formed last fall by the mer
ger of two committees on freshman
residential education set up simultan
eously but independently by the ASSU
and Associate Dean of Students Rob
ert Gordon. The combined group
agreed to help Gordon meet his obliga
tions and deadlines, and Gordon
agreed to give the group's report the
same serious consideration he would
have given that of his own originally
separate committee.
The Freshman Subcommittee's re
port is the most exhaustive of all the
reports received by commission chair
men Jan Jacobi and John Trimbur, It
treats all the educational aspects of
university residence and regards
freshman residence as an inseparable
part of the total university experience,
which in turn is seen as just one phase
of the total process of education.
The subcommittee decided early not
to limit its inquiry to specific problems
but to begin by defining principles and
from there proceed to particulars. It
also saw the need to make some pro
posals for immediate action which
will, presumably, be taken up by the
so-called Packer Committee in time to
be implemented this fall.

The Subcommittee for Freshman
Year was formed last fall by the mer
ger of two committees on freshman
residential education set up simultan
eously but independently by the ASSU
and Associate Dean of Students Rob
ert Gordon. The combined group
agreed to help Gordon meet his obliga
tions and deadlines, and Gordon
agreed to give the group's report the
same serious consideration he would
have given that of his own originally
separate committee.
The Freshman Subcommittee's re
port is the most exhaustive of all the
reports received by commission chair
men Jan Jacobi and John Trimbur, It
treats all the educational aspects of
university residence and regards
freshman residence as an inseparable
part of the total university experience,
which in turn is seen as just one phase
of the total process of education.
The subcommittee decided early not
to limit its inquiry to specific problems
but to begin by defining principles and
from there proceed to particulars. It
also saw the need to make some pro
posals for immediate action which
will, presumably, be taken up by the
so-called Packer Committee in time to
be implemented this fall.
The ASSU Housing Commission has
proposed a bold experiment in under
graduate housing, including coed dor
mitories and the integration of fresh
men and upperclassmen.
The proposal is contained in a 62-
page report to be released Wednesday
after four months of research, deliber
ation and discussion.
In the report of the Subcommittee
for Freshman Year, which was co
chaired by Health Service Director Dr.
Maurice M. Osborne Jr. and Wilbur
head sponsor Scott Soames, the "Wil
bur Experiment" is put forth as the
best possibility for curing the present
system's deficiencies.
If the subcommittee's recommenda
tions are adopted by the University,
next fall each Wilbur house would
have two floors for men and one floor
for women. In addition .every house
would have three upperclassmen for
each freshman.
The leftover freshman women
would live in Roble and Florence
Moore. The remaining freshman men
would move into Branner and Stern.
The other dormitories and houses
would be unaffected by the change.
The report says the ideal ratio of
men to women in a co-ed house is one
to-one, but that two-to-one is accept
able. It suggests as a long-range goal
changing the admissions ratio to one
to-one. It also suggests that freshmen
should ideally constitute 30 per cent
of a house's population.
The subcommittee also discussed
the importance of maintaining diverse
types of housing on the campus and

maintaining diversity within each
house.
In addition to "shuffling bodies," the
report says, the new housing arrange
ments should provide close contacts
with the faculty, closer than exist un
der the present faculty resident ar
rangement. It also proposes experi
mentation with varieties of self-gov
ernment, expansion of the role of tu
tors and immediate elimination of the
resident assistant positions. The lat
ter, according to the committee, are
ineffective as disciplinarians and un
necessary as counselors. Eventually,

Other sections of the Housing Com
missions report will be covered in
The Daily tomorrow and Wednesday,
and the full text of the report will
be published sometime this week..

the report says, there will be no need
for sponsors, either.
Another proposal is to set up five of
the Wilbur Houses around various aca
demic or social themes, make another
an international house and leave the
other two unstructured.
The committee report attacks the
present freshman housing system as
serving "to reinforce natural anxieties
among the newest members of the Uni
versity, and to promote the seeking of
solutions to this anxiety that have little
if anything to do with educational pur
poses, but tend to promote premature
and mutuaHy exclusive social group
ings."
The report also criticizes segregated

freshman housing for encouraging
"the seeking of achievement symbols
(i.e. grades) rather than knowledge of
self or substance." In addition, it says,
the system tends "to aggravate the na
tural ambivalence of freshmen to
wards authority..., and to provide too
much pressure for distortion and rit
ualization of relationships between the
sexes."

ineffective as disciplinarians and un
necessary as counselors. Eventually,

Other sections of the Housing Com
missions report will be covered in
The Daily tomorrow and Wednesday,
and the full text of the report will
be published sometime this week..

the report says, there will be no need
for sponsors, either.
Another proposal is to set up five of
the Wilbur Houses around various aca
demic or social themes, make another
an international house and leave the
other two unstructured.
The committee report attacks the
present freshman housing system as
serving "to reinforce natural anxieties
among the newest members of the Uni
versity, and to promote the seeking of
solutions to this anxiety that have little
if anything to do with educational pur
poses, but tend to promote premature
and mutuaHy exclusive social group
ings."
The report also criticizes segregated

freshman housing for encouraging
"the seeking of achievement symbols
(i.e. grades) rather than knowledge of
self or substance." In addition, it says,
the system tends "to aggravate the na
tural ambivalence of freshmen to
wards authority..., and to provide too
much pressure for distortion and rit
ualization of relationships between the
sexes."

The Subcommittee for Freshman
Year was formed last fall by the mer
ger of two committees on freshman
residential education set up simultan
eously but independently by the ASSU
and Associate Dean of Students Rob
ert Gordon. The combined group
agreed to help Gordon meet his obliga
tions and deadlines, and Gordon
agreed to give the group's report the
same serious consideration he would
have given that of his own originally
separate committee.
The Freshman Subcommittee's re
port is the most exhaustive of all the
reports received by commission chair
men Jan Jacobi and John Trimbur, It
treats all the educational aspects of
university residence and regards
freshman residence as an inseparable
part of the total university experience,
which in turn is seen as just one phase
of the total process of education.
The subcommittee decided early not
to limit its inquiry to specific problems
but to begin by defining principles and
from there proceed to particulars. It
also saw the need to make some pro
posals for immediate action which
will, presumably, be taken up by the
so-called Packer Committee in time to
be implemented this fall.
