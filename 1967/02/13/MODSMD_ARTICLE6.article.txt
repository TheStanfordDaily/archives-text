# WORK BEGINS IN MARCH
## Lomita Mallâ€”A $9 Million Development 
### MAGGIE McCOMAS 
This spring Stanford will begin
building a mall and buildings for Space
Engineering and Earth Sciences, in a
new group around Lomita Drive.
According to Royal H. Tyson of
Planning and Development, construc
tion of the Space Engineering build
ing will begin in late March, with bid
ding for the contract being held early
next month. The building's maximum
cost is a projected 4.5 million.
The structure will be located next to
the McCullough building, on the pres
ent site of the old women's gym.
The Earth Sciences building is sched
uled to be started in October, subject
to funding. The building, which will
cost an estimated 3.75 million, will be
located just north of the intersection
of Panama Street and Lomita Drive.
The section of Lomita Drive between
Panama and Serra Streets will be

closed to traffic after construction of
the Space Engineering building gets
underway, with the Lomita Mall de
velopment project scheduled to begin
in July, subject to funding.
Cost for the basic changeover from
vehicle to pedestrian traffic is an esti
mated $.67 million, with landscape
improvements being financed by indi
vidual gifts.
Architects for the Space Engineer
ing and Earth Sciences buildings are
Spencer, Lee and Busse of San Fran
cisco and Palo Alto. Thomas Church,
landscape architect, designed the mall
development plan.
Bids for each of the projects will
precede actual construction by approx
imately a half month for each project.
Traffic now carried through Lomita
on the west side of Quad will be re
routed by way of the Panama Street
extension which now connects with
Campus Drive south of the Medical
Center near Jordan Hall.
