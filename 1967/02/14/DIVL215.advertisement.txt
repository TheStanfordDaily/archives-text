The building of a new hydroelectric power station in
Siberia may not seem like the most promising subject
matter for a 150-page epic poem. And it would be
difficult to imagine one of our own poets — perhaps
Allen Ginsberg? — singing an unsatirical paean of
praise to the Hoover Dam.
But the poet in this case is very serious. He is also
one of the most exciting in the world, one who uses
the power station as a framework on which to hang his
unique view of existence. Yevgeny Yevtushenko is the
poet; the poem is Uralsk Station, and it is, in the words
of Vogue Magazine, the 33-year-old Russian's "newest
and perhaps his greatest."
Some of you may already be familiar with a bit of
Bratsk Station, for on his recent tour of American
colleges, Yevtushenko read parts of it to enthusiastic
audiences. Now the whole epic cycle of 35 poems, along
with 26 other new poems (on such diverse subjects as
seals, jukeboxes, and the death of Edith Piaf) are col
lected in a new Doubleday Anchor Original paperback.
In the introduction to llratsk Station and Other I\etv
Pot s, translated by Tina Tupikina-Glaessner, Geof
frey Dutton, and Igor Mezhakoff-Koriakin ($1.25),
Rosh Ireland calls Bratsk "a second autobiography.
Besides Yevtushenko's view of history, it contains . . .
the coalescing of a coherent view of his errors in the
past and determination for the future . . . and a vast
amount of evidence on his view of himself and his own
generation."
Mr. Ireland sees Yevtushenko "as a poet whose value,
like his inquiry, extends beyond the boundaries of the
Soviet Union, and whose work is properly the concern
of all to whom poetry is important." Yevtushenko him
self, in setting himself the monumental task of this
distinctly Russian, yet universal poem, writes in a
prologue,
the poet is his'century's image,
and the visionary symbol of the future.
Without shyness, the poet summing up
the total, all that has happened before him . . .
Can I do this?
On the evidence, the answer is yes.
Another author who set himself a monumental task
and succeeded is John Barth. Six years ago, when the
author of the bestselling (riles Goat-Hoy wrote The
Sot-Weed Factor, critic Leslie Fiedler said it was
"closer to the great American novel than any other book
of the past decades." Now John Barth has revised The
Sot-Weed Factor, as he puts it "to make this long
narrative a quantum swifter and more graceful," with
out in any way changing the plot or the characters. It
was 80(5 pages; it's now 7(58. The Sot-Weed Factor:
revised edition, $7.50.

The building of a new hydroelectric power station in
Siberia may not seem like the most promising subject
matter for a 150-page epic poem. And it would be
difficult to imagine one of our own poets — perhaps
Allen Ginsberg? — singing an unsatirical paean of
praise to the Hoover Dam.
But the poet in this case is very serious. He is also
one of the most exciting in the world, one who uses
the power station as a framework on which to hang his
unique view of existence. Yevgeny Yevtushenko is the
poet; the poem is Uralsk Station, and it is, in the words
of Vogue Magazine, the 33-year-old Russian's "newest
and perhaps his greatest."
Some of you may already be familiar with a bit of
Bratsk Station, for on his recent tour of American
colleges, Yevtushenko read parts of it to enthusiastic
audiences. Now the whole epic cycle of 35 poems, along
with 26 other new poems (on such diverse subjects as
seals, jukeboxes, and the death of Edith Piaf) are col
lected in a new Doubleday Anchor Original paperback.
In the introduction to llratsk Station and Other I\etv
Pot s, translated by Tina Tupikina-Glaessner, Geof
frey Dutton, and Igor Mezhakoff-Koriakin ($1.25),
Rosh Ireland calls Bratsk "a second autobiography.
Besides Yevtushenko's view of history, it contains . . .
the coalescing of a coherent view of his errors in the
past and determination for the future . . . and a vast
amount of evidence on his view of himself and his own
generation."
Mr. Ireland sees Yevtushenko "as a poet whose value,
like his inquiry, extends beyond the boundaries of the
Soviet Union, and whose work is properly the concern
of all to whom poetry is important." Yevtushenko him
self, in setting himself the monumental task of this
distinctly Russian, yet universal poem, writes in a
prologue,
the poet is his'century's image,
and the visionary symbol of the future.
Without shyness, the poet summing up
the total, all that has happened before him . . .
Can I do this?
On the evidence, the answer is yes.
Another author who set himself a monumental task
and succeeded is John Barth. Six years ago, when the
author of the bestselling (riles Goat-Hoy wrote The
Sot-Weed Factor, critic Leslie Fiedler said it was
"closer to the great American novel than any other book
of the past decades." Now John Barth has revised The
Sot-Weed Factor, as he puts it "to make this long
narrative a quantum swifter and more graceful," with
out in any way changing the plot or the characters. It
was 80(5 pages; it's now 7(58. The Sot-Weed Factor:
revised edition, $7.50.
