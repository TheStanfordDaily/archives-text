# Walker Confirms Campus In Vienna
## 
### 
Long rumored plans to move Stan
ford's Austrian campus from The Sem
mering to Vienna were confirmed
yesterday at a School of Humanities
and Sciences faculty meeting.
"We plan to move to Vienna, to see
what a thoroughly urban setting does,"
Overseas Campus Director Robert
Walker told about 100 faculty mem
bers.
He disclosed no date for the change,
which cannot become effective without
approval from the Board of Trustees,
who meet Thursday.
Walker spoke after History Prof.
Henry Lewis W. Spitz criticized "ob
vious gaps between educational phi
losophy and administrative policy" in
the overseas program.
"Structurally, what we have is a
benevolent despotism. Fortunately, it's

very benevolent," Spitz said in a
friendly exchange with Walker.
Spitz suggested that a faculty com
mittee appointed by the Academic
Council Executive Committee should
be established to supervise to program,
specifically including jurisdiction over
location of new campuses.
English Prof. John Loftis pointed
out that academic policy, including
location, is now set by the Committee
on General Studies, which is appoint
ed by the Academic Council Executive
Committee and headed by Walker.
History Prof. Gordon Craig, a for
mer General Studies Committee mem
ber, confirmed that this group was con
sulted on location and other policies
during his five years' service.
Growth of the overseas campus
program and other responsibilities

may have "overburdened" the Gen
eral Studies Committee, Prof. Craig
added. He suggested a separate group
might provide more continuous policy
guidance for the overseas campus pro
gram.
Classics Prof. Brooks Otis recom
mended appointment of a small hu
manities and sciences faculty commit
tee to study this question, and the
motion carried by voice vote.
Associate Dean Lincoln Moses, who
chaired the session, said a group of
three to five members would be ap
pointed by the humanities and sciences
faculty steering committee.
Provost Richard Lyman expressed
hope its efforts could be dovetailed
with those of The Study of Education
at Stanford, which also plans to ap
praise the overseas campus program

as part of its comprehensive, univer
sity wide review.
At present, more than half of Stan
ford's undergraduates study six
months in Europe before graduation.
Squaw Valley?
Music Prof. William Crosten sug
gested location was of considerable
importance in the program's educa
tional effectiveness. "You can learn
about America from Fresno or Squaw
Valley, but the chances are you'll learn
far more in San Francisco," he sug
gested.
German Prof. Kurt Mueller-Vollmer
said the intellectual stimulation pro
vided by the overseas campuses "is
still small in comparison with the po
tential."
Associating each overseas campus
with a foreign institution of higher

learning might provide students with
opportunities for specialized work, if
desired, and provide more opportuni
ties for faculty to exchange ideas with
their foreign colleagues, he suggested.
Communications Prof. Nathan Mac
coby quoted a student poll at Stan
ford-in-Britain as finding that "if we're
in the country, we'll go to the city, but
if we're in the city we won't go to
the country."
Tours, France
English Profs. Loftis and Albert
Guerard both praised the Stanford site
at Tours, Franceâ€”a three-hour com
mute from Paris. A member of the
overseas campus subcommittee, Prof.
Loftis predicted that a move of the
Austrian campus from its mountain
site at The Semmering to Vienna was
"likely" this fall or next

Prof. Walker said the committee
discussions indicated the faculty felt
it was "not desirable" to have all
overseas campuses located in large
cities.
Experience at Florence, Italy, Tours,
France, and Beutelsbach, Germany
suggests that "diversity is the best ed
ucational objectives" in locating over
seas campuses, he added.
Both he and Prof. Guerard em
phasized the very great value of close
student-faculty relationships estab
lished at the European campuses.
"This is the only place where Stan
ford has developed solid integration
of student and faculty living," Walker
said.
Coeducational groups of about 80
students live with two faculty families
at each European campus.
