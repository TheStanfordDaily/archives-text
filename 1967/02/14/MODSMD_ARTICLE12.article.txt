# East Oakland Work-Project Planned For Spring Break
## 
### 
A combined seminar and work
project in East Oakland is be
ing planned by the Stanford
"Y" for spring break from Fri
day, March 24, to Friday, March
31.
Applications may be obtained
this week from the "Y" office on
the third floor of the Clubhouse.
The project is co-sponsored
by the East Oakland Parish, a
non-profit, non-sectarian, educa
tion and community action orga
nization that operates in a low
income, largely non-white area.
Differing from other spring
projects, the aim is to let the

group of ten to 15 students spend
the week living in East Oakland
to learn as much as possible
about the local urban problems.
The students will live in a church
basement made available by tho
parish and will prepare their
own food, the latter being thf
only cost for the week.
The group will participate in
a number of the citizens' various
activities and in addition, will
meet with Oakland police and
welfare agency officials, and visit
jails, courthouses, and schools.
Further information about the
project may be obtained by call
ing extension 4502.
