# Twas A Poor Day
## Card Ruggers Tie USC 12-12 
### JOHN MERRILL 
Beset by a late plane, an ex
tremely smoggy atmosphere, and
a just plain bad day the Stanford
Rugby team had to settle for a
12-12 tie against the Southern
California Trojans Saturday in
a game played in Los Angeles.
A rule which had heretofore
forbidden football players to
enter competition in Rugby for
USC was waived and the Trojans
came up with a much better
team than expected.
Mike Grace was the Indian
standout, in the standoff, scoring
nine points on three penalty
kicks. The Stanford backs found
that the playing field, narrower
that the conventional rugby
field, made it tough to organize
effective rushes.
First Season Non-Victory
The Tribe ruggers, undefeated
a: 4 d untied until Saturday, trailed
ot the half, 6-3, the only score
being a penalty three-pointer
by Grace.
Meanwhile in the first period
the Trojans had scored once on
a penalty kick and had also
scored a try.

Early in the second half the
lead seesawed as Stanford first
tied the game, then went behind,
then tied the match up again on
successive penalty kicks by both
teams.
A Trojan 60 Yards
Then USC boomed back into
the lead on the only really ex
plosive play of the hot, smoggy
day. The score, a 60 yard run
off a pop kick, put the Trojans
in a 12-9 lead.
In the closing minutes of the
game Stanford began to show
flashes of the play that had
carried the Indians to four
straight victories.
The scrum came to life and be
gan to dominate much of the

field play with Blaine Nye lead
ing the comeback
Nye personally dominated the
lineouts all afternoon, coming up
with the ball when it was even
remotely close to the Stanford
side of the lineout.
It was off a five yard scrum
that Bob Blunt scored the try
that almost gave the Indians the
win. Blunt's score made it 12-12
and Mike Grace attempted the
conversion.
It was a rather routine at«
tempt for Grace, top scorer for
the team all season, and the
kick seemed to be good to all
but one person.
No Good?
The referee was out of posi

tion for the call and that left
the goal judge who ruled no
good, and the game ended,
amidst a good deal of discussion,
a tie.
Stanford Coach Pete Kmetovic
was disappointed at the result
especially after the resounding
Olympic Club upset of last week.
Kmetovic did single out Joe
Neal, Peter Hogg, and Frank
Pattitucci for their fine scrum
play. Pattitucci was a standout
at the breakaway position until
leaving the game with a rib in
jury in the second half.
Stanford will attempt to get
back on the winning streak next
week when they meet UCLA in a
match here at Stanford at 1:30.

at the breakaway position until
leaving the game with a rib in

Beset by a late plane, an ex
tremely smoggy atmosphere, and
a just plain bad day the Stanford
Rugby team had to settle for a
12-12 tie against the Southern
California Trojans Saturday in
a game played in Los Angeles.
A rule which had heretofore
forbidden football players to
enter competition in Rugby for
USC was waived and the Trojans
came up with a much better
team than expected.
Mike Grace was the Indian
standout, in the standoff, scoring
nine points on three penalty
kicks. The Stanford backs found
that the playing field, narrower
that the conventional rugby
field, made it tough to organize
effective rushes.
First Season Non-Victory
The Tribe ruggers, undefeated
a: 4 d untied until Saturday, trailed
ot the half, 6-3, the only score
being a penalty three-pointer
by Grace.
Meanwhile in the first period
the Trojans had scored once on
a penalty kick and had also
scored a try.

Early in the second half the
lead seesawed as Stanford first
tied the game, then went behind,
then tied the match up again on
successive penalty kicks by both
teams.
A Trojan 60 Yards
Then USC boomed back into
the lead on the only really ex
plosive play of the hot, smoggy
day. The score, a 60 yard run
off a pop kick, put the Trojans
in a 12-9 lead.
In the closing minutes of the
game Stanford began to show
flashes of the play that had
carried the Indians to four
straight victories.
The scrum came to life and be
gan to dominate much of the

field play with Blaine Nye lead
ing the comeback
Nye personally dominated the
lineouts all afternoon, coming up
with the ball when it was even
remotely close to the Stanford
side of the lineout.
It was off a five yard scrum
that Bob Blunt scored the try
that almost gave the Indians the
win. Blunt's score made it 12-12
and Mike Grace attempted the
conversion.
It was a rather routine at«
tempt for Grace, top scorer for
the team all season, and the
kick seemed to be good to all
but one person.
No Good?
The referee was out of posi

tion for the call and that left
the goal judge who ruled no
good, and the game ended,
amidst a good deal of discussion,
a tie.
Stanford Coach Pete Kmetovic
was disappointed at the result
especially after the resounding
Olympic Club upset of last week.
Kmetovic did single out Joe
Neal, Peter Hogg, and Frank
Pattitucci for their fine scrum
play. Pattitucci was a standout
at the breakaway position until
leaving the game with a rib in
jury in the second half.
