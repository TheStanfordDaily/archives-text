# Gymnasts Post Rings Record, But Succumb To Cal Hears
## 
### GREG PSALTIS 
A crowd of better than 400
was awed several times by spar
kling performances by California
and Stanford gymnasts Saturday
night as the Bears trounced the
Indians, 180.95 to 130.55.
Stanford was handicapped by
not having the services of all
around man Jim Petersen who
was injured in practice the day
before the meet. Had Petersen
competed, he would have been
able to add at least another 15
points to the Indians' score,
bringing it up to at least 145.
Marks Sets Mark
Sophomore John Marks pro
vided the highlight of the meet
for Stanford as he performed a
beautiful ring routine for a 9.2
score. It is only the second 9.2
score in the history of Stanford
gymnastics and the first on the
rings.
Rich Guess shared the spot
light with Marks as he turned in
fine performances in floor exer
cise, trampoline and long horse
to give him 24-35 points for the
night. Sophomore Jim Snyder's
8.40 on the long horse wets an
other fine effort for the Cards.
Coach John Gilmore said he
was encouraged by the fact that
Stanford had enough depth to
fill in where Petersen had to
drop out. Last year the team
would have had to leave several
spots open, but this year those
spots were filled.

Cal King?
By running up 180.95 points,
California definitely became the
leading candidate for the con
ference championship. Previous
ly the Bears had been scoring
around 170 points per meet, but
have now jelled to form a pro
spective conference champion
team.
Josh Robison, Sid Freudensteln
and Herb Solomon provided
most of the thrills in the meet
as they performed nearly flaw
less routines.
Robison, two-time conference
ring champion, did a routine that

Craig Dickson, the Cards' top
freshman, could only participate
in two events due to a bad
hand tear. He scored 9.2 in the
long horse and 8.3 in floor exer
cise.
Don Reed turned in two good
performances for the freshmen,
too, as he scored 8.0 in both the
long horse and side horse.

Indians, 180.95 to 130.55.
Stanford was handicapped by
not having the services of all
around man Jim Petersen who
was injured in practice the day
before the meet. Had Petersen
competed, he would have been
able to add at least another 15
points to the Indians' score,
bringing it up to at least 145.
Marks Sets Mark
Sophomore John Marks pro
vided the highlight of the meet
for Stanford as he performed a
beautiful ring routine for a 9.2
score. It is only the second 9.2
score in the history of Stanford
gymnastics and the first on the
rings.
Rich Guess shared the spot
light with Marks as he turned in
fine performances in floor exer
cise, trampoline and long horse
to give him 24-35 points for the
night. Sophomore Jim Snyder's
8.40 on the long horse wets an
other fine effort for the Cards.
Coach John Gilmore said he
was encouraged by the fact that
Stanford had enough depth to
fill in where Petersen had to
drop out. Last year the team
would have had to leave several
spots open, but this year those
spots were filled.

Cal King?
By running up 180.95 points,
California definitely became the
leading candidate for the con
ference championship. Previous
ly the Bears had been scoring
around 170 points per meet, but
have now jelled to form a pro
spective conference champion
team.
Josh Robison, Sid Freudensteln
and Herb Solomon provided
most of the thrills in the meet
as they performed nearly flaw
less routines.
Robison, two-time conference
ring champion, did a routine that

Craig Dickson, the Cards' top
freshman, could only participate
in two events due to a bad
hand tear. He scored 9.2 in the
long horse and 8.3 in floor exer
cise.
Don Reed turned in two good
performances for the freshmen,
too, as he scored 8.0 in both the
long horse and side horse.
