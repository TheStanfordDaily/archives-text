# Volunteers In Asia Program Expands Field Of Operation
## 
### 
Volunteers in Asia (VIA), a Stan
ford-based service program, has an
nounced plans to send almost fifty vol
unteers to the Far East during the
coming summer. While continuing
projects in Hong Kong, Vietnam, Ma
cao, and Korea, VIA will start pro
grams this year in the Philippines,
Okinawa, and possibly Sarawak.
Twenty-five students will be as
signed to Hong Kong, the site of the
initial VIA program in 1963. Some
volunteers will teach English, in col
leges, rooftop schools, secondary
schools, an orphange and a TB sard
torium. Others will be involved in
medical and recreational work.
In Vietnam, five volunteers, already
selected and taking an intensive Viet
namese language course, will work on
community development. Their pro
gram is co-sponsored by International
Voluntary Services.
Korea
Two volunteers in Korea will teach
at Kyung-Pook National University
in Taegu while two others work with
the Korean National Commission for
UNESCO. The two volunteers as
signed to Okinawa will be located in
one of the southernmost islands of the

Ryukyus chain. They will offer an in
tensive spoken English course to the
island's English teachers.
VlA's entry into the Philippines is
a result of a recent survey trip to Asia
by VIA director Dwight Clark, a for
mer Stanford dean. In answer to Min
danao State University's request to
VIA for an unlimited number of vol
unteers, seven students from Pomoma
College are expected to be sent to the
Philippines this year. Pomona had ear
lier requested that an Asian project be
fielded from its campus.
Political Unrest
Recent political unrest in Macao
makes continuation of the VIA proj
ects there uncertain. At present, how
ever, the organization hopes to send
three volunteers to work in a refugee
self-help organization and continue a
socio-economic survey, the colony's
first, begun by VIA workers in 1966.
Applications for students interested
in participating in this summer's pro
grams are now available at the orga
nization's office in the International
Center. Wednesday evening at 7:30, al
so at the International Center, past
volunteers will conduct an informa
tional meeting.
