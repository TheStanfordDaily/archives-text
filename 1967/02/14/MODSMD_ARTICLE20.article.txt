The Housing Commission's report on fra
ternities reveals a sad state of affairs on the Row.
It is a strong indictment of the fraternity sys
tem and must not be ignored or underestimated.
The study brings into focus aspects of
fraternity life which have long been general
knowledge but have never in the past been re
ported publicly. The specifics on academic in
terest, selection, discrimination, and hell week
alone are strong condemnations of the fraterni
ties. But their real value as criticisms of the sys
tem lies in their exposition of an attitude prev
alent in the fraternities, namely the feeling that
they can continue to exist with goals totally
contrary to those of the rest of the University
community.
Fraternities cannot continue to be an escape
from education. The polarity between amuse
ment and education does not need to exist, and
without eliminating the "fun and games" neces
sary to any living group, fraternities can at
tempt to contribute more to the total educational
experience of their members. The answer does
not lie only in dinner invitations to faculty or in
fining members for not coming to house sem
inars; it lies in a reevaluation of the fraternities'
purpose.
The subcommittee's report calls for answers
to a number of pressing questions. Why hasn't
the Dean's office ever investigated fraternity be
havior? Why has information on specific inci
dents consistently been squelched? Does the
Dean's office intend to do anything now? Why

was information on two fraternities conspicu
ously omitted?
The report, despite its thoroughness, fails to
offer a satisfactory solution to more than the
specific problems of fraternity misbehavior. The
suggestion that eight houses initiate a 25 per
cent draw is neither desirable nor feasible. It
would create strong animosities between the
pledged and the drawn members, leading to ill
feeling which would only strengthen the fra
ternities' grip on the status quo, rather than open
the door to constructive change.
Last fall, fraternity representatives spent a
weekend assessing the houses' actual and po
tential role in the University. They concluded
that it was necessary for a change to take place,
but that this change would have to take place
from within. Very little has been done so far.
Four fraternities have severed their ties with
their national organizations; two have substan
tially changed their selection procedure; several
are teaching classes at their houses. However,
these are insufficient indications that substan
tial improvements will be initiated from "with
• »
in.
This year's freshman class is cautioned to go
into rush with open eyes and an open mind; to
those who decide they wish to join fraternities
we offer the challenge of transforming that sys
tem into a legitimate alternative offering more
Uian small group living, a structured social pro
gram, and nice cluster houses.
