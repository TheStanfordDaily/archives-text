## ASSU: How Much Power? 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
In view of recent statements
about the Committee of Fifteen,
certain clarifications may be in
order.
The Committee of Fifteen was
set up to discuss issues on which
the main constituencies of the
University—administration, fac
ulty and students—might be in
disagreement. The hope is that
by full and free discussion and
exchange of views, many dis
agreements can be ironed out.
Hence, the fact that the Com
mittee of Fifteen may not im
mediately and unanimously en
dorse the position of one partic
ular constituency does not mean
that the Committee has "failed "
It means, rather, that the Com
mittee, as an independent body,
does not accept the view that
any one constituency is always
right.
As to the newly established
Packer committee, it is impor
tant to consider what is in issue
and what is not. The claim that
students should participate in
University policy making has
been met by the appointment
of three students to the nine
man Steering Committee, with
full voting membership. The
claim that ASSU should have a
voice in the selection of student
members was met by inviting
representatives of ASSU to par
ticipate in interviewing student
candidates and to make recom
mendations concerning those in
terviewed.
Thus, as matters now stand,
students have been appointed to
the Steering Committee, and rep
resentatives of ASSU were in
vited into consultation as to their
selection. Surely Professor Pack
er has gone far beyond former
practice in both respects.
What, then, is the ground of
objection? The objections seem
to rest upon a sweeping claim
that ASSU should be recognized

by all parties as the final judge
as to which individual students
are qualified to serve on Univer
sity committees. I do not think
the proponents of this claim have
been quite candid as to what
they are demanding; perhaps
they have not thought of all the
implications.
But the implications are quite
radical, and they raise a num
ber of serious questions. Is the
claimed authority within the
scope of ASSU's constitution?
When student officers are elect
ed, is it the intention, or is it
within the power, of the student
body to give student officers a
veto power over the legitimate
activities of individuals?
Could the student body presi
dent claim the right to decide
who should play on the football
team? Could he claim the right
to veto an individual student's
choice of courses or professors?
Could LASSU declare that
joining a fraternity is contrary
to the fundamental standard?
Could student political officers in
sist on the right to decide who
is qualified to try out for The
Daily or claim the authority to
censor its editorials? I should
hesitate to think so.
If there are limits to the prop
er authority of student govern
ment and student officers over in
dividuals, I think it is important
to consider carefully what those
limits are.
It seems to me that two dif
ferent questions have got con
fused. It is one thing to argue
that students should have a role
in University policy making. It is
quite another thing to argue that
ASSU—which was not set up

with this function in view—
should act as the exclusive bar
gaining agent on behalf of all
students with respect to the im
plementation of this policy. It
is important to distinguish these
claims because it is quite possi
ble to support the first without
supporting the second.

Editor, The Daily:
As the other student sitting
on the Planning Committee
which set up the Packer Com
mittee, I would like to expand on
two points relevant to the pres
ent controversy.
First, although it was agreed
that members of the Steering
Committee should "be based on
ability and interest rather than
representation," the specific
method of selection of these
members was never discussed.
Selection by the President seems
to have been an assumed ex
tension of "the committee's con
cept" rather than one specifically
articulated by the committee.
Secondly, the agreement on
ability and interest rather than
representation as the criteria for
selection of the Steering Com
mittee was made in conjunction
with the explicit understanding

that a permanent Advisory Com
mittee generally representative
of the major university con
stituiences would be appointed.
It was my understanding that
the students sitting on this com
mittee would be representatives
such as the President of ASSU
and the Speaker of Legislature.
Although no three students se
lected by anyone could ever hope
to be "representative," these stu
dent members could most effec
tively fill this role acting as a
form of check and balance giv
ing direction to the more specific
work carried out by the Steering
Committee. It seems ironical
that no mention of this Advisory
Committee has been made at all
when one of its most important
functions might have been aid
ing in the selection of the Steer
ing Committee.

Editor, The Daily:
In view of recent statements
about the Committee of Fifteen,
certain clarifications may be in
order.
The Committee of Fifteen was
set up to discuss issues on which
the main constituencies of the
University—administration, fac
ulty and students—might be in
disagreement. The hope is that
by full and free discussion and
exchange of views, many dis
agreements can be ironed out.
Hence, the fact that the Com
mittee of Fifteen may not im
mediately and unanimously en
dorse the position of one partic
ular constituency does not mean
that the Committee has "failed "
It means, rather, that the Com
mittee, as an independent body,
does not accept the view that
any one constituency is always
right.
As to the newly established
Packer committee, it is impor
tant to consider what is in issue
and what is not. The claim that
students should participate in
University policy making has
been met by the appointment
of three students to the nine
man Steering Committee, with
full voting membership. The
claim that ASSU should have a
voice in the selection of student
members was met by inviting
representatives of ASSU to par
ticipate in interviewing student
candidates and to make recom
mendations concerning those in
terviewed.
Thus, as matters now stand,
students have been appointed to
the Steering Committee, and rep
resentatives of ASSU were in
vited into consultation as to their
selection. Surely Professor Pack
er has gone far beyond former
practice in both respects.
What, then, is the ground of
objection? The objections seem
to rest upon a sweeping claim
that ASSU should be recognized

by all parties as the final judge
as to which individual students
are qualified to serve on Univer
sity committees. I do not think
the proponents of this claim have
been quite candid as to what
they are demanding; perhaps
they have not thought of all the
implications.
But the implications are quite
radical, and they raise a num
ber of serious questions. Is the
claimed authority within the
scope of ASSU's constitution?
When student officers are elect
ed, is it the intention, or is it
within the power, of the student
body to give student officers a
veto power over the legitimate
activities of individuals?
Could the student body presi
dent claim the right to decide
who should play on the football
team? Could he claim the right
to veto an individual student's
choice of courses or professors?
Could LASSU declare that
joining a fraternity is contrary
to the fundamental standard?
Could student political officers in
sist on the right to decide who
is qualified to try out for The
Daily or claim the authority to
censor its editorials? I should
hesitate to think so.
If there are limits to the prop
er authority of student govern
ment and student officers over in
dividuals, I think it is important
to consider carefully what those
limits are.
It seems to me that two dif
ferent questions have got con
fused. It is one thing to argue
that students should have a role
in University policy making. It is
quite another thing to argue that
ASSU—which was not set up

with this function in view—
should act as the exclusive bar
gaining agent on behalf of all
students with respect to the im
plementation of this policy. It
is important to distinguish these
claims because it is quite possi
ble to support the first without
supporting the second.

Editor, The Daily:
As the other student sitting
on the Planning Committee
which set up the Packer Com
mittee, I would like to expand on
two points relevant to the pres
ent controversy.
First, although it was agreed
that members of the Steering
Committee should "be based on
ability and interest rather than
representation," the specific
method of selection of these
members was never discussed.
Selection by the President seems
to have been an assumed ex
tension of "the committee's con
cept" rather than one specifically
articulated by the committee.
Secondly, the agreement on
ability and interest rather than
representation as the criteria for
selection of the Steering Com
mittee was made in conjunction
with the explicit understanding

that a permanent Advisory Com
mittee generally representative
of the major university con
stituiences would be appointed.
It was my understanding that
the students sitting on this com
mittee would be representatives
such as the President of ASSU
and the Speaker of Legislature.
Although no three students se
lected by anyone could ever hope
to be "representative," these stu
dent members could most effec
tively fill this role acting as a
form of check and balance giv
ing direction to the more specific
work carried out by the Steering
Committee. It seems ironical
that no mention of this Advisory
Committee has been made at all
when one of its most important
functions might have been aid
ing in the selection of the Steer
ing Committee.

about the Committee of Fifteen,
certain clarifications may be in
order.
The Committee of Fifteen was
set up to discuss issues on which
the main constituencies of the
University—administration, fac
ulty and students—might be in
disagreement. The hope is that
by full and free discussion and
exchange of views, many dis
agreements can be ironed out.
Hence, the fact that the Com
mittee of Fifteen may not im
mediately and unanimously en
dorse the position of one partic
ular constituency does not mean
that the Committee has "failed "
It means, rather, that the Com
mittee, as an independent body,
does not accept the view that
any one constituency is always
right.
As to the newly established
Packer committee, it is impor
tant to consider what is in issue
and what is not. The claim that
students should participate in
University policy making has
been met by the appointment
of three students to the nine
man Steering Committee, with
full voting membership. The
claim that ASSU should have a
voice in the selection of student
members was met by inviting
representatives of ASSU to par
ticipate in interviewing student
candidates and to make recom
mendations concerning those in
terviewed.
Thus, as matters now stand,
students have been appointed to
the Steering Committee, and rep
resentatives of ASSU were in
vited into consultation as to their
selection. Surely Professor Pack
er has gone far beyond former
practice in both respects.
What, then, is the ground of
objection? The objections seem
to rest upon a sweeping claim
that ASSU should be recognized

by all parties as the final judge
as to which individual students
are qualified to serve on Univer
sity committees. I do not think
the proponents of this claim have
been quite candid as to what
they are demanding; perhaps
they have not thought of all the
implications.
But the implications are quite
radical, and they raise a num
ber of serious questions. Is the
claimed authority within the
scope of ASSU's constitution?
When student officers are elect
ed, is it the intention, or is it
within the power, of the student
body to give student officers a
veto power over the legitimate
activities of individuals?
Could the student body presi
dent claim the right to decide
who should play on the football
team? Could he claim the right
to veto an individual student's
choice of courses or professors?
Could LASSU declare that
joining a fraternity is contrary
to the fundamental standard?
Could student political officers in
sist on the right to decide who
is qualified to try out for The
Daily or claim the authority to
censor its editorials? I should
hesitate to think so.
If there are limits to the prop
er authority of student govern
ment and student officers over in
dividuals, I think it is important
to consider carefully what those
limits are.
It seems to me that two dif
ferent questions have got con
fused. It is one thing to argue
that students should have a role
in University policy making. It is
quite another thing to argue that
ASSU—which was not set up

with this function in view—
should act as the exclusive bar
gaining agent on behalf of all
students with respect to the im
plementation of this policy. It
is important to distinguish these
claims because it is quite possi
ble to support the first without
supporting the second.

Editor, The Daily:
As the other student sitting
on the Planning Committee
which set up the Packer Com
mittee, I would like to expand on
two points relevant to the pres
ent controversy.
First, although it was agreed
that members of the Steering
Committee should "be based on
ability and interest rather than
representation," the specific
method of selection of these
members was never discussed.
Selection by the President seems
to have been an assumed ex
tension of "the committee's con
cept" rather than one specifically
articulated by the committee.
Secondly, the agreement on
ability and interest rather than
representation as the criteria for
selection of the Steering Com
mittee was made in conjunction
with the explicit understanding

that a permanent Advisory Com
mittee generally representative
of the major university con
stituiences would be appointed.
It was my understanding that
the students sitting on this com
mittee would be representatives
such as the President of ASSU
and the Speaker of Legislature.
Although no three students se
lected by anyone could ever hope
to be "representative," these stu
dent members could most effec
tively fill this role acting as a
form of check and balance giv
ing direction to the more specific
work carried out by the Steering
Committee. It seems ironical
that no mention of this Advisory
Committee has been made at all
when one of its most important
functions might have been aid
ing in the selection of the Steer
ing Committee.
