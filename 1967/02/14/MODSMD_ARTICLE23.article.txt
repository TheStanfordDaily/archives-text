## Freshman Battle Cry: 'Remember The Row!' 
### Clay L. Miller 
Attacks on the fraternities by
the tireless soreheads, hippies,
Daily writers, imbecile do-good
ers, and the others to whom our
student administration owes its
opinions and policies, have lately
reached a pitch of virulence sug
gesting the more advanced, wast
ing stages of paranoia.
These Brahmins of the Com
munity-of-Scholars hoax, over
and beyond flicking the spitwads
of anti-fraternity envy that have
been their stock-in-trade as long
as memory runneth, have now
started to run a kind of political
protection racket on the side.
The way it works, the fraterni
ties, in order to keep the Harris
government's Grim Black Camel
penned in at the Phi Delt house,
are expected, publicly and often,
to hunch down on thir knees and
elbows, performing all manner
of witless indignities such as we
saw out at the Undergraduate
Library last week, strictly for
the amusement and diversion of
the Friends of the Radical Ad
ministration in a sort of per
petual Super-Hell Week without
parallel since that disgusting
business at Canossa. No more
public recantation in metaphori
cal sack cloth and ashes ... no
more fraternities.

The glue-pot mentality fra
ternity-baiters, who always de
light in preposterous bleatings
out anyway, the lounder the bet
ter, have come up with a new
sancitmony that is almost hilari
ous. This emasculation of fra
ternities, they assure us, this
Gun-Point Theory of University
Awareness, is really meant just
to uplift those poor-bastard
Delts, out of the Bronze Age, to
their own dizzyingly exhausted
intellectual level. It is in a pig's
Camelia bush because you know
and I know that our campus al
ready enjoys the genius of gen
uine intellectual diversity and
anyone not taking advantage of
it by now never will No mat
ter where he lives.
Rather, we are up against a
ploy, inspired by the supersti
tious fears and prejudices of the
more ineffectual of the campus
intellectuals — a thin-skinned
bunch generally to be found
turning scarlet with indignation
and gallumphing about like a
whole division of hopped-up
horse maries at the sight of
someone enjoying life on terms
different from their own—to in
stitute a vacuous social confrom
ity in the name of democracy
and at the expense of liberty.
Heady Victory
Those of us here last spring
will never forget the bourbony
taste of victory over the en
trenched, self-righteous, and
probably manic moral despots
and outright churls that clung to
the dry-campus liquor regula
tions.
Men of '70: The struggle
against meddlesome cranks that
would have our University
moulded in none but their own
unspeakable, censorious images
wasn't won completely last
spring before you joined us. It
continues in the fight for the
right of the fraternities to re
main as first class members of
the university, as long as they
have the pledge support to keep
them going.
Do your part, then. Sound the
well-worn conch from the wine
stained battlements of freedom.
Rush the fraternities and rush
them hard, whether or not you
pledge, and thereby demonstrate
to all interested parties in how
much awe you hold these crack
pots monkeying around with
your right to live your years at
Stanford as, where, and with
whom you choose.
May I lend you some of my
Jade East?
