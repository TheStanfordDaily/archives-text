# Israeli Ambassador:
## 'Arabs Must Honor Armistice Agreements' 
### MAGGIE McCOMAS 
Israel's primary goal in its "retalia
tory response" to provocations along
the Jordanian border in recent months
was to emphasize the point that the
1919 armistice agreements with the
Arab states must be honored, explain
ed Israeli Ambassador Avraham Har
man, speaking here yesterday.
A guest of the Law School Inter
national Society, the ambassador said
that the armistice agreements have
been a "way of life" rather than a
transition from peace to war as they
should be.
"But world conditions today allow
neither peace nor war ... we want
peace, not just a 'no shooting' situa
tion," he said
Mr. Harman explained further that
while the intruders from Jordan may
have been Syrian inspired, the Israeli
government acted in response to a

specific area of Jordan where "a series
of provocations had originated over a
period of several weeks. This was not
an instantaneous reaction to a one
shot affair," he said.
The ambassador agreed that the
Syrians have been instrumental in
provoking border conflicts and said
that since 1965 the Syrians have im
plemented a policy of armed infiltra
tion using terrorist methods in border
areas. "This is in direct conflict with
the armistice agreement of 1949," he
said.
He added, however, that those pro
voking the Jordan incidents had as
sumed immunity from the Jordanian
government, from the people of that
area, and from the people of Israel,
and that Israel's position was to break
down this "immunity" concept.
"If they don't want peace, they must
at least leave us alone," he said. "That

is a minimum condition."
Within the last ten years Israel's
military escalation has been "only
to maintain minimum sufficiency of
deterent strength."
"This is not an easy policy to fol
low," he said, "but it has resulted in
diverting aggression. This policy can
continue indefinitely until our neigh
bors can accommodate themselves to
the reality of our existence," he said.
The ambassador indicated that the
most important thing the U.S. can do
concerning these conflicts is to "recog
nize the independence and integrity
of all states in this area."
In regard to the problem of settle
ment of Arab refugees, Mr. Harman
said, "We are committed to paying
compensation to Arab refugees . . .
but there is nobody to negotiate with
. . . and won't be as long as the Arabs
don't recognize Israel."

He explained that the Israeli gov
ernment's position has changed con
siderably in regard to this problem
and has become "more flexible." From
1948 to 1951 the government offered
to make contributions to the settle
ment of refugees only within the con
text of a peace settlement with the
Arab nations, he said. However, in late
1951 this position changed, and the
Israeli government was prepared to
negotiate the refugee problem outside
the context of a peace settlement.
He added that the Israeli govern
ment is not ready to make a "suicidal
contribution" to the solution of the
problem by letting Arab refugees
"blow us up from the inside."
"If there were no other solution
than settlement of these people within
Israel then we would have a serious
problem, but there are 13 Arab states
where they can settle," he said.

nize the independence and integrity
of all states in this area."
In regard to the problem of settle
ment of Arab refugees, Mr. Harman
said, "We are committed to paying
compensation to Arab refugees . . .
but there is nobody to negotiate with
. . . and won't be as long as the Arabs
don't recognize Israel."

He explained that the Israeli gov
ernment's position has changed con
siderably in regard to this problem
and has become "more flexible." From
1948 to 1951 the government offered
to make contributions to the settle
ment of refugees only within the con
text of a peace settlement with the
Arab nations, he said. However, in late
1951 this position changed, and the
Israeli government was prepared to
negotiate the refugee problem outside
the context of a peace settlement.
He added that the Israeli govern
ment is not ready to make a "suicidal
contribution" to the solution of the
problem by letting Arab refugees
"blow us up from the inside."
"If there were no other solution
than settlement of these people within
Israel then we would have a serious
problem, but there are 13 Arab states
where they can settle," he said.
Israel's primary goal in its "retalia
tory response" to provocations along
the Jordanian border in recent months
was to emphasize the point that the
1919 armistice agreements with the
Arab states must be honored, explain
ed Israeli Ambassador Avraham Har
man, speaking here yesterday.
A guest of the Law School Inter
national Society, the ambassador said
that the armistice agreements have
been a "way of life" rather than a
transition from peace to war as they
should be.
"But world conditions today allow
neither peace nor war ... we want
peace, not just a 'no shooting' situa
tion," he said
Mr. Harman explained further that
while the intruders from Jordan may
have been Syrian inspired, the Israeli
government acted in response to a

specific area of Jordan where "a series
of provocations had originated over a
period of several weeks. This was not
an instantaneous reaction to a one
shot affair," he said.
The ambassador agreed that the
Syrians have been instrumental in
provoking border conflicts and said
that since 1965 the Syrians have im
plemented a policy of armed infiltra
tion using terrorist methods in border
areas. "This is in direct conflict with
the armistice agreement of 1949," he
said.
He added, however, that those pro
voking the Jordan incidents had as
sumed immunity from the Jordanian
government, from the people of that
area, and from the people of Israel,
and that Israel's position was to break
down this "immunity" concept.
"If they don't want peace, they must
at least leave us alone," he said. "That

is a minimum condition."
Within the last ten years Israel's
military escalation has been "only
to maintain minimum sufficiency of
deterent strength."
"This is not an easy policy to fol
low," he said, "but it has resulted in
diverting aggression. This policy can
continue indefinitely until our neigh
bors can accommodate themselves to
the reality of our existence," he said.
The ambassador indicated that the
most important thing the U.S. can do
concerning these conflicts is to "recog
nize the independence and integrity
of all states in this area."
