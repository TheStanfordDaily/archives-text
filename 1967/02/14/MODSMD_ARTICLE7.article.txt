# Housing Report Challenges Quality Of Frat Life, Traditional Hell Week
## 
### CHRISTOPHER HARGROVE 
The ASSU Housing Commission's
subcommittee on fraternities has
called for an immediate investigation
into fraternity "hell week," if not by
the Dean's office then by the Santa
Clara County District Attorney.
The subcommittee's report, part of
the recently completed comprehensive
study of University housing, also calls
on the fraternities to "submit nota
rized affidavits explaining their pro
cedure during the last Hell Week/Help
Week, except in such cases where the
Constitutional Bill of Rights is in
voked."

Other proposals include instituting
an experimental draw system in at
least eight fraternities, whereby 25
per cent of the pledge spaces would
be filled by draw.
The report also asks that a review
board be established which would de
cide within the next three years
whether each fraternity should be
allowed to remain at Stanford. Each
decision, says the report, "shall be
based upon performance." The board
would be appointed by President Ster
ling and the Academic Council.
Furthermore the report proposes
that all fraternities publicly repudiate

all racial and religious restrictions im
mediately or else lose the financial
assistance of the University.
It is asked also that the Board of
Trustees be notified in detail of the
substance of the report and that its
judgment be requested.
Finally, the report states that
"should these measures, or measures
incorporating similar intentions, be
ignored, the freshman class of this
year should take special note of the
means available to it to improve the
character of its forthcoming upper
class life."
The full report of the Housing
Commission will be released tomor
row after four months of study and
discussion.
The report omits any information
pertaining to Delta Tau Delta and
Zeta Psi fraternities, "because of cir
cumstances beyond the subcommit
tee's control."
The fraternity subcommittee was
composed of 17 undergraduate men,
of whom ten are active fraternity
members, three are deactivated (in
cluding Chairman David Calfee), three
are freshmen and one is unaffiliated.
The report charges that the fratern
ity, as an institution, is in practice op
posed to education. It says, "in dividing
the life of the student member as it
has, it has not only separated enter
tainment and education, but rendered
them combatants."
Cocktail Parties
Except for faculty cocktail parties
and after-dinner discussions, the re
port continues, only three fraternities
have organized explicitly educational
activities. The most commonly report
ed house traditions are parties. "No
house reported educational or aca
demic traditions."
The subcommittee condemned most
of the currently practiced rushing pol
icies as "unworthy of this Univer

sity." It stated further that not only
is the rushee "thoroughly disadvan
taged" by the process but that "the
persistent claims of reciprocity and
mutual choice are phantasmagoric."
Moreover, the subcommittee charged,
the present rush system "can inflict
psychological scars on many fresh
men."
Although practices vary from one
fraternity to another, the subcommit
tee found a number of cases where
Hell Week practices (initiating pledges
into the fraternity) are in direct viola
tion of California State Law, section
8 of the Education Code, which spe
cifically prohibits all forms of hazing.
Hell Week Activities
Some houses have made changes in
their Hell Week procedures, the re
port points out, and some have tech
nically abolished it. Nevertheless, the
report says, even in these cases "there
is a series of prescribed activities
which are often annoying or embar
rassing and certainly non-educational."
The report points out that, though
the Dean's office has publicly stated
that it does not condone hazing, in
fact it has done nothing to curb it."It
has become clear," the report states,
"that the University has remained
passive to the condition of the Fratern
ity, excepting its physical plant, in all
cases but those producing scandal."
Another recommendation is for more
contact between the fraternities and
the faculty. "There is at present no
widespread contact or associate pro
gram," the report says. Thirteen fra
ternities reported that their faculty
advisors did not know what went on
during their Hell Week. Seven houses
said they had no faculty advisor.
The remaining sections of the Hous
ing Commission report will be covered
in The Dally tomorrow. The full text
of the report will be published tomor

character of its forthcoming upper
class life."
The full report of the Housing
Commission will be released tomor
row after four months of study and
discussion.
The report omits any information
pertaining to Delta Tau Delta and
Zeta Psi fraternities, "because of cir
cumstances beyond the subcommit
tee's control."
The fraternity subcommittee was
composed of 17 undergraduate men,
of whom ten are active fraternity
members, three are deactivated (in
cluding Chairman David Calfee), three
are freshmen and one is unaffiliated.
The report charges that the fratern
ity, as an institution, is in practice op
posed to education. It says, "in dividing
the life of the student member as it
has, it has not only separated enter
tainment and education, but rendered
them combatants."
Cocktail Parties
Except for faculty cocktail parties
and after-dinner discussions, the re
port continues, only three fraternities
have organized explicitly educational
activities. The most commonly report
ed house traditions are parties. "No
house reported educational or aca
demic traditions."
The subcommittee condemned most
of the currently practiced rushing pol
icies as "unworthy of this Univer

sity." It stated further that not only
is the rushee "thoroughly disadvan
taged" by the process but that "the
persistent claims of reciprocity and
mutual choice are phantasmagoric."
Moreover, the subcommittee charged,
the present rush system "can inflict
psychological scars on many fresh
men."
Although practices vary from one
fraternity to another, the subcommit
tee found a number of cases where
Hell Week practices (initiating pledges
into the fraternity) are in direct viola
tion of California State Law, section
8 of the Education Code, which spe
cifically prohibits all forms of hazing.
Hell Week Activities
Some houses have made changes in
their Hell Week procedures, the re
port points out, and some have tech
nically abolished it. Nevertheless, the
report says, even in these cases "there
is a series of prescribed activities
which are often annoying or embar
rassing and certainly non-educational."
The report points out that, though
the Dean's office has publicly stated
that it does not condone hazing, in
fact it has done nothing to curb it."It
has become clear," the report states,
"that the University has remained
passive to the condition of the Fratern
ity, excepting its physical plant, in all
cases but those producing scandal."
Another recommendation is for more
contact between the fraternities and
the faculty. "There is at present no
widespread contact or associate pro
gram," the report says. Thirteen fra
ternities reported that their faculty
advisors did not know what went on
during their Hell Week. Seven houses
said they had no faculty advisor.
The remaining sections of the Hous
ing Commission report will be covered
in The Dally tomorrow. The full text
of the report will be published tomor
row In a special supplement.
The ASSU Housing Commission's
subcommittee on fraternities has
called for an immediate investigation
into fraternity "hell week," if not by
the Dean's office then by the Santa
Clara County District Attorney.
The subcommittee's report, part of
the recently completed comprehensive
study of University housing, also calls
on the fraternities to "submit nota
rized affidavits explaining their pro
cedure during the last Hell Week/Help
Week, except in such cases where the
Constitutional Bill of Rights is in
voked."

Other proposals include instituting
an experimental draw system in at
least eight fraternities, whereby 25
per cent of the pledge spaces would
be filled by draw.
The report also asks that a review
board be established which would de
cide within the next three years
whether each fraternity should be
allowed to remain at Stanford. Each
decision, says the report, "shall be
based upon performance." The board
would be appointed by President Ster
ling and the Academic Council.
Furthermore the report proposes
that all fraternities publicly repudiate

all racial and religious restrictions im
mediately or else lose the financial
assistance of the University.
It is asked also that the Board of
Trustees be notified in detail of the
substance of the report and that its
judgment be requested.
Finally, the report states that
"should these measures, or measures
incorporating similar intentions, be
ignored, the freshman class of this
year should take special note of the
means available to it to improve the
character of its forthcoming upper
class life."

fraternity to another, the subcommit
tee found a number of cases where
Hell Week practices (initiating pledges
into the fraternity) are in direct viola
tion of California State Law, section
8 of the Education Code, which spe
cifically prohibits all forms of hazing.
Hell Week Activities
Some houses have made changes in
their Hell Week procedures, the re
port points out, and some have tech
nically abolished it. Nevertheless, the
report says, even in these cases "there
is a series of prescribed activities
which are often annoying or embar
rassing and certainly non-educational."
The report points out that, though
the Dean's office has publicly stated
that it does not condone hazing, in
fact it has done nothing to curb it."It
has become clear," the report states,
"that the University has remained
passive to the condition of the Fratern
ity, excepting its physical plant, in all
cases but those producing scandal."
Another recommendation is for more
contact between the fraternities and
the faculty. "There is at present no
widespread contact or associate pro
gram," the report says. Thirteen fra
ternities reported that their faculty
advisors did not know what went on
during their Hell Week. Seven houses
said they had no faculty advisor.
The remaining sections of the Hous
ing Commission report will be covered
in The Dally tomorrow. The full text
of the report will be published tomor
row In a special supplement.
The ASSU Housing Commission's
subcommittee on fraternities has
called for an immediate investigation
into fraternity "hell week," if not by
the Dean's office then by the Santa
Clara County District Attorney.
The subcommittee's report, part of
the recently completed comprehensive
study of University housing, also calls
on the fraternities to "submit nota
rized affidavits explaining their pro
cedure during the last Hell Week/Help
Week, except in such cases where the
Constitutional Bill of Rights is in
voked."

Other proposals include instituting
an experimental draw system in at
least eight fraternities, whereby 25
per cent of the pledge spaces would
be filled by draw.
The report also asks that a review
board be established which would de
cide within the next three years
whether each fraternity should be
allowed to remain at Stanford. Each
decision, says the report, "shall be
based upon performance." The board
would be appointed by President Ster
ling and the Academic Council.
Furthermore the report proposes
that all fraternities publicly repudiate

all racial and religious restrictions im
mediately or else lose the financial
assistance of the University.
It is asked also that the Board of
Trustees be notified in detail of the
substance of the report and that its
judgment be requested.
Finally, the report states that
"should these measures, or measures
incorporating similar intentions, be
ignored, the freshman class of this
year should take special note of the
means available to it to improve the
character of its forthcoming upper
class life."
The full report of the Housing
Commission will be released tomor
row after four months of study and
discussion.
The report omits any information
pertaining to Delta Tau Delta and
Zeta Psi fraternities, "because of cir
cumstances beyond the subcommit
tee's control."
The fraternity subcommittee was
composed of 17 undergraduate men,
of whom ten are active fraternity
members, three are deactivated (in
cluding Chairman David Calfee), three
are freshmen and one is unaffiliated.
The report charges that the fratern
ity, as an institution, is in practice op
posed to education. It says, "in dividing
the life of the student member as it
has, it has not only separated enter
tainment and education, but rendered
them combatants."
Cocktail Parties
Except for faculty cocktail parties
and after-dinner discussions, the re
port continues, only three fraternities
have organized explicitly educational
activities. The most commonly report
ed house traditions are parties. "No
house reported educational or aca
demic traditions."
The subcommittee condemned most
of the currently practiced rushing pol
icies as "unworthy of this Univer

sity." It stated further that not only
is the rushee "thoroughly disadvan
taged" by the process but that "the
persistent claims of reciprocity and
mutual choice are phantasmagoric."
Moreover, the subcommittee charged,
the present rush system "can inflict
psychological scars on many fresh
men."
Although practices vary from one
fraternity to another, the subcommit
tee found a number of cases where
Hell Week practices (initiating pledges
into the fraternity) are in direct viola
tion of California State Law, section
8 of the Education Code, which spe
cifically prohibits all forms of hazing.
