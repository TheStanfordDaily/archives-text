# El Capitan Abolishes Selective Rush Policy

### STEVE GBUBER 
El Capitan Eating Club last night
became the third campus organization
to abolish selective rush.
Breakers Eating Club was the first
to abolish selective rush. Breakers
made the move last February and was
followed by Beta Chi in October.
El Capitan president David Mitchell,
a graduate student in communications,
strongly supported the new policy.
"We did not like playing junior
gods," he said.
The new rush system, as explained
by Mitchell, allows prospective mem
bers to join "after eating several
meals" at the club. "After he has seen
El Capitan and met a few members,
then he can tell us if he would like
to join, and he will automatically be
come a member," Mitchell said.
El Capitan set a precedent last year
by voting to allow women to join the

organization. Since that time, several
other groups have invited women to
join.
The vote to abolish selective rush
was 22 to 9, with a two-thirds ma
jority needed to pass the measure.
"People are no longer under pres
sure to sell themselves to us," Mitch
ell said, "but are encouraged to deter
mine if the group will both correspond
to and further their own goals."
El Capitan will continue to hold
open houses and rush parties in ac
cordance with the proposals submitted
in January by the ad-hoc rush com
mittee, according to Mitchell.
"We hope the new policy will tend
to bring in people who are interested
in meeting other people, getting to
know them, and getting to know them
selves," Mitchell said. The new rush
plan will take effect immediately, he
said.
