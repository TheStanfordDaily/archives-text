# Packer Study: 250 Questions Raised
## 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
The preliminary agenda for The Study of
Education at Stanford released yesterday by
Herbert L. Packer raises questions ranging
from, "Do we need bells between classes?" to
"What is the University for?"
In total, it raises over two hundred and fifty
questions in eighteen major areas of uni
versity life.
The agenda, which will be revised by the
Steering Committee, begins with a series of
questions relating to, "The Nature and Basic
Characteristics of the University." Three major
queries ask what the University is for, how
Stanford should relate to the worlds around
it, and what its enrollment policy should be.
Sub-questions in this area deal with spe
cifically with Stanford's role in California, the
West, the nation, and the world. Questions in
clude: "What obligations does Stanford have
to help solve urban, racial and environmental

problems? What emphasis on education for in
ternational service?"
Under enrollment policy are two questions,
"What is the desirable enrollment at various
levels, today and in 1980?" and "What criteria
should determine the ratio of men to women
and what should this ratio be?"
The second major heading of the agenda
is "Undergraduate Education." The first ques
tion offered is: "What should be Stanford's
goals in the light of present student character
istics and objectives?" An example of student
objectives is the matter of who goes to grad
uate school.
Other questions concern major requirements,
off-campus learning, student leave-of-absence
rules, independent study, and general educa
tion. The last includes problems of whether
Western Civ and freshman English should be
required and what responsibility the Univer
sity has for students' ability to communicate in

writing.
The last topic in this heading deals with the
General Studies program. Points to be ex
amined are whether the program should sup
ply rigid requirements or relaxed guidelines
in self-planned programs, whether beginning
courses in science, social science and humani
ties fill general education needs, and whether
there is a need for, "syntheses and subjects
such as a history/philosophy/methods of sci
ence course."
"Graduate Education" is the third key area.
The first series of questions concern degree
programs. These ask if there should be a re
duction in the average time required to get
a Ph.D. and if there should be more inter
disciplinary degrees.
Further questions deal with preparation for
academic careers, general education at the
graduate level, presence of post-doctoral fel
lows on campus, and the continuing education

of alumni.
The next central topic is "Instructional Pro
grams and Practices." The first subject con
sidered is Stanford's curricular offerings. The
concept of a "course" as, "the principal cur
ricular concept in higher education" is to be
considered as is the load of work students
carry.
Other questions concern the addition of new
courses, inter-disciplinary opportunities, course
descriptions, and"the relevance of education
to the lives of our students."
Concluding the section are the matters of
class size, the grading system, use of educa
tional television, and the use of personality
tests in assigning students to sections in large
courses.
The fifth focal topic is "Overseas Campuses
and Programs." The philosophy, operation, and
location of the campuses are the subject of
questions. One specific concern is with the need

for overseas graduate centers or the placement
of graduates in the undergraduate centers.
The next two topic subjects are "Admissions
and Financial Aid" and "Advising and Coun
selling." There are several questions about se
lecting undergraduates. For example: "Are
selection methods as objective as possible?
What are our selection criteria? Are admis
sions tests adequate?" and "Should we seek
a more widely representative student body?"
On finance, the question is raised: "Do our
present financial aid policies adequately sup
port our admission objectives?"
The four major questions under "Advising
and Counselling" deal with the coordination
of advising, counselling, placement, and health
service; improvement in advising; helping
students plan the next step in their careers;
and upgrading services that help students with
personal, medical, or psychological problems.
"Residence Programs and Pol
icies" is the next key area. The
primary question raised is
whether, "Stanford should strive
to be a residential campus for
all undergraduates or should off
campus living be considered?"
The following questions are:
"Should on-campus residence be
compulsory for any group?" and
"If women are allowed the off
campus option, what, if any, age
or parental permission require
ments should apply?" These
questions have been the subject
of heated debate in recent weeks
as women have protested on-cam
pus restrictions.
Other housing questions con
cern the segregated freshman
year, future co-ed living, educa
tional activities in undergraduate
residences, the role of fraterni
ties and eating clubs, room and
board charges, and the need for
graduate student residences.

The ninth heading is, "Stu
dents and the Extra Curricu
lum." Student government, stu
dent conduct, and athletics are
considered.
The first question and its sub
questions ask what the role and
structure of student government
should be, whether it is represen
tative, whether it should be
more, or less, independent of the
formal university structure, and
what its relationship should be
to extra-curricular activities.
Fundamental Standard
Student conduct is scrutinized
by questioning the fundamental
standard, the judicial mechan
isms, and the honor code.
Finally, there is a question
concerning the proper roles of in
tra- and inter-university ath
letics.
"Women's Education" and the
"Academic Calendar" are the
next chief subjects. Special prob
lems in the education of women,

career opportunities and suitably
related educational opportuni
ties, and facilities and opportuni
ties for student and faculty
wives are suggested as areas for
study.
The quarter system, the use of
the summer period, and the
daily schedule are to be pondered
under "Academic Calendar."
The following three
topics are "Campus Environ
ment," "Libraries," and "Re
search."
A Coffee House?
The need for coffee houses is
one issue marked for study un
der the first. Another is how
Stanford should adapt to changes
in the surrounding community.
A look at the shortcomings
of the library system is suggest
ed under the second heading. The
need to establish priorities for
library improvement is also sug
gested.
"Research" questions deal with
the proper balance of research
and teaching and whether there
should be an enlargement in uni
versity sponsored research.
The distribution of teaching
loads, the quality of teaching,
the teaching assistant program,
and the selection and recruit
ment of faculty are all questioned
under the next title, "Faculty
and Other Teaching Personnel."
The Administration
The sixteenth heading is, "Ad
ministrative Structure of The
University." The major questions
ask whether the administra
tion is properly organized "to
give maximum support to the
full range of academic activi
ties," whether the faculty can
be, "more effectively organized
for participation in the decision
making process," what role stu
dents should have in the govern
ment of the University, and what
administrative arrange ments
would, "maximize cohesiveness
among the various elements of
the campus community."
In the revising process, the
Committee will hold hearings
open to the entire community
and will solicit written communi
cations. "These hearings," Chair
man, Herbert L. Packer, notes,
"will provide an opportunity
for all interested people—fac
ulty, staff and students—who
wish to participate in the study
of any item on the agenda to
make their interest known."
The hearings will be held in
the Committee office in the
Meyer Library.

goals in the light of present student character
istics and objectives?" An example of student
objectives is the matter of who goes to grad
uate school.
Other questions concern major requirements,
off-campus learning, student leave-of-absence
rules, independent study, and general educa
tion. The last includes problems of whether
Western Civ and freshman English should be
required and what responsibility the Univer
sity has for students' ability to communicate in

writing.
The last topic in this heading deals with the
General Studies program. Points to be ex
amined are whether the program should sup
ply rigid requirements or relaxed guidelines
in self-planned programs, whether beginning
courses in science, social science and humani
ties fill general education needs, and whether
there is a need for, "syntheses and subjects
such as a history/philosophy/methods of sci
ence course."
"Graduate Education" is the third key area.
The first series of questions concern degree
programs. These ask if there should be a re
duction in the average time required to get
a Ph.D. and if there should be more inter
disciplinary degrees.
Further questions deal with preparation for
academic careers, general education at the
graduate level, presence of post-doctoral fel
lows on campus, and the continuing education

of alumni.
The next central topic is "Instructional Pro
grams and Practices." The first subject con
sidered is Stanford's curricular offerings. The
concept of a "course" as, "the principal cur
ricular concept in higher education" is to be
considered as is the load of work students
carry.
Other questions concern the addition of new
courses, inter-disciplinary opportunities, course
descriptions, and"the relevance of education
to the lives of our students."
Concluding the section are the matters of
class size, the grading system, use of educa
tional television, and the use of personality
tests in assigning students to sections in large
courses.
The fifth focal topic is "Overseas Campuses
and Programs." The philosophy, operation, and
location of the campuses are the subject of
questions. One specific concern is with the need

for overseas graduate centers or the placement
of graduates in the undergraduate centers.
The next two topic subjects are "Admissions
and Financial Aid" and "Advising and Coun
selling." There are several questions about se
lecting undergraduates. For example: "Are
selection methods as objective as possible?
What are our selection criteria? Are admis
sions tests adequate?" and "Should we seek
a more widely representative student body?"
On finance, the question is raised: "Do our
present financial aid policies adequately sup
port our admission objectives?"
The four major questions under "Advising
and Counselling" deal with the coordination
of advising, counselling, placement, and health
service; improvement in advising; helping
students plan the next step in their careers;
and upgrading services that help students with
personal, medical, or psychological problems.
"Residence Programs and Pol
icies" is the next key area. The
primary question raised is
whether, "Stanford should strive
to be a residential campus for
all undergraduates or should off
campus living be considered?"
The following questions are:
"Should on-campus residence be
compulsory for any group?" and
"If women are allowed the off
campus option, what, if any, age
or parental permission require
ments should apply?" These
questions have been the subject
of heated debate in recent weeks
as women have protested on-cam
pus restrictions.
Other housing questions con
cern the segregated freshman
year, future co-ed living, educa
tional activities in undergraduate
residences, the role of fraterni
ties and eating clubs, room and
board charges, and the need for
graduate student residences.

The ninth heading is, "Stu
dents and the Extra Curricu
lum." Student government, stu
dent conduct, and athletics are
considered.
The first question and its sub
questions ask what the role and
structure of student government
should be, whether it is represen
tative, whether it should be
more, or less, independent of the
formal university structure, and
what its relationship should be
to extra-curricular activities.
Fundamental Standard
Student conduct is scrutinized
by questioning the fundamental
standard, the judicial mechan
isms, and the honor code.
Finally, there is a question
concerning the proper roles of in
tra- and inter-university ath
letics.
"Women's Education" and the
"Academic Calendar" are the
next chief subjects. Special prob
lems in the education of women,

career opportunities and suitably
related educational opportuni
ties, and facilities and opportuni
ties for student and faculty
wives are suggested as areas for
study.
The quarter system, the use of
the summer period, and the
daily schedule are to be pondered
under "Academic Calendar."
The following three
topics are "Campus Environ
ment," "Libraries," and "Re
search."
A Coffee House?
The need for coffee houses is
one issue marked for study un
der the first. Another is how
Stanford should adapt to changes
in the surrounding community.
A look at the shortcomings
of the library system is suggest
ed under the second heading. The
need to establish priorities for
library improvement is also sug
gested.
"Research" questions deal with
the proper balance of research
and teaching and whether there
should be an enlargement in uni
versity sponsored research.
The distribution of teaching
loads, the quality of teaching,
the teaching assistant program,
and the selection and recruit
ment of faculty are all questioned
under the next title, "Faculty
and Other Teaching Personnel."
The Administration
The sixteenth heading is, "Ad
ministrative Structure of The
University." The major questions
ask whether the administra
tion is properly organized "to
give maximum support to the
full range of academic activi
ties," whether the faculty can
be, "more effectively organized
for participation in the decision
making process," what role stu
dents should have in the govern
ment of the University, and what
administrative arrange ments
would, "maximize cohesiveness
among the various elements of
the campus community."
In the revising process, the
Committee will hold hearings
open to the entire community
and will solicit written communi
cations. "These hearings," Chair
man, Herbert L. Packer, notes,
"will provide an opportunity
for all interested people—fac
ulty, staff and students—who
wish to participate in the study
of any item on the agenda to
make their interest known."
The hearings will be held in
the Committee office in the
Meyer Library.
The preliminary agenda for The Study of
Education at Stanford released yesterday by
Herbert L. Packer raises questions ranging
from, "Do we need bells between classes?" to
"What is the University for?"
In total, it raises over two hundred and fifty
questions in eighteen major areas of uni
versity life.
The agenda, which will be revised by the
Steering Committee, begins with a series of
questions relating to, "The Nature and Basic
Characteristics of the University." Three major
queries ask what the University is for, how
Stanford should relate to the worlds around
it, and what its enrollment policy should be.
Sub-questions in this area deal with spe
cifically with Stanford's role in California, the
West, the nation, and the world. Questions in
clude: "What obligations does Stanford have
to help solve urban, racial and environmental

problems? What emphasis on education for in
ternational service?"
Under enrollment policy are two questions,
"What is the desirable enrollment at various
levels, today and in 1980?" and "What criteria
should determine the ratio of men to women
and what should this ratio be?"
The second major heading of the agenda
is "Undergraduate Education." The first ques

The next central topic is "Instructional Pro
grams and Practices." The first subject con
sidered is Stanford's curricular offerings. The
concept of a "course" as, "the principal cur
ricular concept in higher education" is to be
considered as is the load of work students
carry.
Other questions concern the addition of new
courses, inter-disciplinary opportunities, course
descriptions, and"the relevance of education
to the lives of our students."
Concluding the section are the matters of
class size, the grading system, use of educa
tional television, and the use of personality
tests in assigning students to sections in large
courses.
The fifth focal topic is "Overseas Campuses
and Programs." The philosophy, operation, and
location of the campuses are the subject of
questions. One specific concern is with the need

for overseas graduate centers or the placement
of graduates in the undergraduate centers.
The next two topic subjects are "Admissions
and Financial Aid" and "Advising and Coun
selling." There are several questions about se
lecting undergraduates. For example: "Are
selection methods as objective as possible?
What are our selection criteria? Are admis
sions tests adequate?" and "Should we seek
a more widely representative student body?"
On finance, the question is raised: "Do our
present financial aid policies adequately sup
port our admission objectives?"
The four major questions under "Advising
and Counselling" deal with the coordination
of advising, counselling, placement, and health
service; improvement in advising; helping
students plan the next step in their careers;
and upgrading services that help students with
personal, medical, or psychological problems.
"Residence Programs and Pol
icies" is the next key area. The
primary question raised is
whether, "Stanford should strive
to be a residential campus for
all undergraduates or should off
campus living be considered?"
The following questions are:
"Should on-campus residence be
compulsory for any group?" and
"If women are allowed the off
campus option, what, if any, age
or parental permission require
ments should apply?" These
questions have been the subject
of heated debate in recent weeks
as women have protested on-cam
pus restrictions.
Other housing questions con
cern the segregated freshman
year, future co-ed living, educa
tional activities in undergraduate
residences, the role of fraterni
ties and eating clubs, room and
board charges, and the need for
graduate student residences.

The ninth heading is, "Stu
dents and the Extra Curricu
lum." Student government, stu
dent conduct, and athletics are
considered.
The first question and its sub
questions ask what the role and
structure of student government
should be, whether it is represen
tative, whether it should be
more, or less, independent of the
formal university structure, and
what its relationship should be
to extra-curricular activities.
Fundamental Standard
Student conduct is scrutinized
by questioning the fundamental
standard, the judicial mechan
isms, and the honor code.
Finally, there is a question
concerning the proper roles of in
tra- and inter-university ath
letics.
"Women's Education" and the
"Academic Calendar" are the
next chief subjects. Special prob
lems in the education of women,

career opportunities and suitably
related educational opportuni
ties, and facilities and opportuni
ties for student and faculty
wives are suggested as areas for
study.
The quarter system, the use of
the summer period, and the
daily schedule are to be pondered
under "Academic Calendar."
The following three
topics are "Campus Environ
ment," "Libraries," and "Re
search."
A Coffee House?
The need for coffee houses is
one issue marked for study un
der the first. Another is how
Stanford should adapt to changes
in the surrounding community.
A look at the shortcomings
of the library system is suggest
ed under the second heading. The
need to establish priorities for
library improvement is also sug
gested.
"Research" questions deal with
the proper balance of research
and teaching and whether there
should be an enlargement in uni
versity sponsored research.
The distribution of teaching
loads, the quality of teaching,
the teaching assistant program,
and the selection and recruit
ment of faculty are all questioned
under the next title, "Faculty
and Other Teaching Personnel."
The Administration
The sixteenth heading is, "Ad
ministrative Structure of The
University." The major questions
ask whether the administra
tion is properly organized "to
give maximum support to the
full range of academic activi
ties," whether the faculty can
be, "more effectively organized
for participation in the decision
making process," what role stu
dents should have in the govern
ment of the University, and what
administrative arrange ments
would, "maximize cohesiveness
among the various elements of
the campus community."
In the revising process, the
Committee will hold hearings
open to the entire community
and will solicit written communi
cations. "These hearings," Chair
man, Herbert L. Packer, notes,
"will provide an opportunity
for all interested people—fac
ulty, staff and students—who
wish to participate in the study
of any item on the agenda to
make their interest known."
The hearings will be held in
the Committee office in the
Meyer Library.
The preliminary agenda for The Study of
Education at Stanford released yesterday by
Herbert L. Packer raises questions ranging
from, "Do we need bells between classes?" to
"What is the University for?"
In total, it raises over two hundred and fifty
questions in eighteen major areas of uni
versity life.
The agenda, which will be revised by the
Steering Committee, begins with a series of
questions relating to, "The Nature and Basic
Characteristics of the University." Three major
queries ask what the University is for, how
Stanford should relate to the worlds around
it, and what its enrollment policy should be.
Sub-questions in this area deal with spe
cifically with Stanford's role in California, the
West, the nation, and the world. Questions in
clude: "What obligations does Stanford have
to help solve urban, racial and environmental

problems? What emphasis on education for in
ternational service?"
Under enrollment policy are two questions,
"What is the desirable enrollment at various
levels, today and in 1980?" and "What criteria
should determine the ratio of men to women
and what should this ratio be?"
The second major heading of the agenda
is "Undergraduate Education." The first ques
tion offered is: "What should be Stanford's
goals in the light of present student character
istics and objectives?" An example of student
objectives is the matter of who goes to grad
uate school.
Other questions concern major requirements,
off-campus learning, student leave-of-absence
rules, independent study, and general educa
tion. The last includes problems of whether
Western Civ and freshman English should be
required and what responsibility the Univer
sity has for students' ability to communicate in

writing.
The last topic in this heading deals with the
General Studies program. Points to be ex
amined are whether the program should sup
ply rigid requirements or relaxed guidelines
in self-planned programs, whether beginning
courses in science, social science and humani
ties fill general education needs, and whether
there is a need for, "syntheses and subjects
such as a history/philosophy/methods of sci
ence course."
"Graduate Education" is the third key area.
The first series of questions concern degree
programs. These ask if there should be a re
duction in the average time required to get
a Ph.D. and if there should be more inter
disciplinary degrees.
Further questions deal with preparation for
academic careers, general education at the
graduate level, presence of post-doctoral fel
lows on campus, and the continuing education

of alumni.
The next central topic is "Instructional Pro

port our admission objectives?"
The four major questions under "Advising
and Counselling" deal with the coordination
of advising, counselling, placement, and health
service; improvement in advising; helping
students plan the next step in their careers;
and upgrading services that help students with
personal, medical, or psychological problems.
"Residence Programs and Pol
icies" is the next key area. The
primary question raised is
whether, "Stanford should strive
to be a residential campus for
all undergraduates or should off
campus living be considered?"
The following questions are:
"Should on-campus residence be
compulsory for any group?" and
"If women are allowed the off
campus option, what, if any, age
or parental permission require
ments should apply?" These
questions have been the subject
of heated debate in recent weeks
as women have protested on-cam
pus restrictions.
Other housing questions con
cern the segregated freshman
year, future co-ed living, educa
tional activities in undergraduate
residences, the role of fraterni
ties and eating clubs, room and
board charges, and the need for
graduate student residences.

The ninth heading is, "Stu
dents and the Extra Curricu
lum." Student government, stu
dent conduct, and athletics are
considered.
The first question and its sub
questions ask what the role and
structure of student government
should be, whether it is represen
tative, whether it should be
more, or less, independent of the
formal university structure, and
what its relationship should be
to extra-curricular activities.
Fundamental Standard
Student conduct is scrutinized
by questioning the fundamental
standard, the judicial mechan
isms, and the honor code.
Finally, there is a question
concerning the proper roles of in
tra- and inter-university ath
letics.
"Women's Education" and the
"Academic Calendar" are the
next chief subjects. Special prob
lems in the education of women,

career opportunities and suitably
related educational opportuni
ties, and facilities and opportuni
ties for student and faculty
wives are suggested as areas for
study.
The quarter system, the use of
the summer period, and the
daily schedule are to be pondered
under "Academic Calendar."
The following three
topics are "Campus Environ
ment," "Libraries," and "Re
search."
A Coffee House?
The need for coffee houses is
one issue marked for study un
der the first. Another is how
Stanford should adapt to changes
in the surrounding community.
A look at the shortcomings
of the library system is suggest
ed under the second heading. The
need to establish priorities for
library improvement is also sug
gested.
"Research" questions deal with
the proper balance of research
and teaching and whether there
should be an enlargement in uni
versity sponsored research.
The distribution of teaching
loads, the quality of teaching,
the teaching assistant program,
and the selection and recruit
ment of faculty are all questioned
under the next title, "Faculty
and Other Teaching Personnel."
The Administration
The sixteenth heading is, "Ad
ministrative Structure of The
University." The major questions
ask whether the administra
tion is properly organized "to
give maximum support to the
full range of academic activi
ties," whether the faculty can
be, "more effectively organized
for participation in the decision
making process," what role stu
dents should have in the govern
ment of the University, and what
administrative arrange ments
would, "maximize cohesiveness
among the various elements of
the campus community."
In the revising process, the
Committee will hold hearings
open to the entire community
and will solicit written communi
cations. "These hearings," Chair
man, Herbert L. Packer, notes,
"will provide an opportunity
for all interested people—fac
ulty, staff and students—who
wish to participate in the study
of any item on the agenda to
make their interest known."
The hearings will be held in
the Committee office in the
Meyer Library.
The preliminary agenda for The Study of
Education at Stanford released yesterday by
Herbert L. Packer raises questions ranging
from, "Do we need bells between classes?" to
"What is the University for?"
In total, it raises over two hundred and fifty
questions in eighteen major areas of uni
versity life.
The agenda, which will be revised by the
Steering Committee, begins with a series of
questions relating to, "The Nature and Basic
Characteristics of the University." Three major
queries ask what the University is for, how
Stanford should relate to the worlds around
it, and what its enrollment policy should be.
Sub-questions in this area deal with spe
cifically with Stanford's role in California, the
West, the nation, and the world. Questions in
clude: "What obligations does Stanford have
to help solve urban, racial and environmental

problems? What emphasis on education for in
ternational service?"
Under enrollment policy are two questions,
"What is the desirable enrollment at various
levels, today and in 1980?" and "What criteria
should determine the ratio of men to women
and what should this ratio be?"
The second major heading of the agenda
is "Undergraduate Education." The first ques
tion offered is: "What should be Stanford's
goals in the light of present student character
istics and objectives?" An example of student
objectives is the matter of who goes to grad
uate school.
Other questions concern major requirements,
off-campus learning, student leave-of-absence
rules, independent study, and general educa
tion. The last includes problems of whether
Western Civ and freshman English should be
required and what responsibility the Univer
sity has for students' ability to communicate in

writing.
The last topic in this heading deals with the
General Studies program. Points to be ex
amined are whether the program should sup
ply rigid requirements or relaxed guidelines
in self-planned programs, whether beginning
courses in science, social science and humani
ties fill general education needs, and whether
there is a need for, "syntheses and subjects
such as a history/philosophy/methods of sci
ence course."
"Graduate Education" is the third key area.
The first series of questions concern degree
programs. These ask if there should be a re
duction in the average time required to get
a Ph.D. and if there should be more inter
disciplinary degrees.
Further questions deal with preparation for
academic careers, general education at the
graduate level, presence of post-doctoral fel
lows on campus, and the continuing education

of alumni.
The next central topic is "Instructional Pro
grams and Practices." The first subject con
sidered is Stanford's curricular offerings. The
concept of a "course" as, "the principal cur
ricular concept in higher education" is to be
considered as is the load of work students
carry.
Other questions concern the addition of new
courses, inter-disciplinary opportunities, course
descriptions, and"the relevance of education
to the lives of our students."
Concluding the section are the matters of
class size, the grading system, use of educa
tional television, and the use of personality
tests in assigning students to sections in large
courses.
The fifth focal topic is "Overseas Campuses
and Programs." The philosophy, operation, and
location of the campuses are the subject of
questions. One specific concern is with the need

for overseas graduate centers or the placement
of graduates in the undergraduate centers.
The next two topic subjects are "Admissions
and Financial Aid" and "Advising and Coun
selling." There are several questions about se
lecting undergraduates. For example: "Are
selection methods as objective as possible?
What are our selection criteria? Are admis
sions tests adequate?" and "Should we seek
a more widely representative student body?"
On finance, the question is raised: "Do our
present financial aid policies adequately sup
port our admission objectives?"
The four major questions under "Advising

of advising, counselling, placement, and health
service; improvement in advising; helping
