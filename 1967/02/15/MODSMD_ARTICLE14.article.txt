# Students Help San Quentin Find Jobs For Ex-convicts
## 
### NICK SELBY 
Stanford activists get another
opportunity to aid the surround
ing community this week with
the start of a campus organiza
tion to aid a group of ex-crimi
nals from San Quentin Prison.
The San Quentin Project, as
its director Mose Richards calls
it, will sell raffle tickets and try
to collect money for The Seventh
Step Foundation, which has sev
eral groups in the Bay Area at
tempting to get jobs for ex-con
victs.
Richards stated that San Quen

tin Prison has six steps in its re
lease process, and the Seventh
Step is joining the founding af
ter release.
Reverses National Results
Nation-wide statistics show
that eight out of every ten ex
convicts goes back to prison. But
in the San Jose Seventh Step
Foundation, which Richards
wants to aid, and when the ex
convicts aid each other, only five
out of 116 ex-convicts have gone
back to prison.
Richards stated that staying
out of prison almost always boils
down to being able to get a job.
The Seventh Seal foundation
has expenses of $1,000 monthly,
and because of near insolvency,
the foundation has been unable
to expand its work into the juve
nile problem, and has led a
month to month existence.
Teaching Possibility
Richards stated that Stanford
students would primarily fulfill
this fund-raising need for the
first month, but would later pos
sibly go to San Quentin and San
Jose to help convicts with En
glish problems. He added that a
meeting of those interested
would be announced later in
Once Around the Quad.
The Foundation is comprised
entirely of ex-convicts except for
its Board of Directors of lead
ing businessmen, judges, and
sheriffs. It is the first group ever
of ex-convicts to form a legal
association for mutual benefit.
