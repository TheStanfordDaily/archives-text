# GRUDGE MATCH
## Laxmen Meet Palo Alto Club 
### HUGH WEST 
Stanford's Lacrosse Team
meets the Palo Alto Club this
Saturday afternoon in a full
dress rehearsal of the up-com
ing season.
The game will not count on
the official record of either team
and will provide both teams
with a chance to shake out the
kinks under full game pressure
before the season gets officially
underway with the Cal-Stanford
game March 4.
Coach Bob Barton's early es
timations indicate that this
year's team will be even better
than last year's, which won the
Pacific Coast Coliegiate title,
placed four men or the Pacific
Coast All Star first team, and
walloped California 11-0 to wrest
the Aberchrombie and Fitch

Broken Stick Trophy from the
Bears.
Best Defensive Unit
Barton boasts the best defen
sive unit Stanford has ever had.
Although All-Star Chip Green
ing has graduated, his position
has more than been filled by two
newcomers, Bill Eakland and
Denny McNeely, while veteran
Jack Dirman is back. All three
tip the scales above the 200-
pound level.
Eakland was first string All-
New England last year at An
dover. McNeely is a transfer
from Dartmouth, where he

played fullback for the football
team as well as defense in la
crosse.
Dirman is polishing up his
reputation as one of the tough
est players in the NorCal league
to a bright shine.
Back leading the attack is the
Baltimore Bruiser, Clay Prim
rose, who led the team in scor
ing and won a first team berth
on the Pacific Coast team. Join
ing Primrose in the assault on
the goal will be George Muser,
Don Sangre, and Dick Enerson.
Fresh Mldfield
The only question mark this
early in the season lies in the

midfield, the question which
plagues nearly every lacrosse
team before regular play starts.
Last year's entire first mid
field graduated, but Barton has
a nucleus of lettennen to rely
on, including Sandy Saxton,
Glenn Thomas, Dirk Speas, and
Sill Sanders, and Brent Lake.
Based on this core, Barton will
dip into a collection of new
faces to round out the midfield.
The Indians have more than
a handful in the Palo Alto Club,
the only team to which they lost
last year. The Club is made up
mostly of Stanford graduate stu
dents and boasts a generous
smattering of seasoned Eastern
stars and former All-Americans.
Goalie's Day
There is bound to be a lot of
action around the Stanford goal,
which will be occupied alter
nately by third year starter and
Captain Mel Ellis and Hugh
West.
There is bound to be a lot of
contact in this game, as is al
ways the case when these cross
campus rivals meet. The In
dians begrudge the two losses
to Paly last year and will be out
to deck the smug veterans.
