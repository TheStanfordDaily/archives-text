Society in America" sponsored by the
Political Union. Previous speakers

Institutions, and Lincoln Lynch, As

Student Opinion
Commenting on the program, Po
litical Union President Charles Bell
said, "We feel that the press-confer
ence format of the scheduled program
will provide an opportunity for the
expression of student opinion on a
variety of topics."
Arrangements for Humphrey's ap
pearance were made well in advance
and coincide with his appearance at
the twenty-fifth anniversary meeting
of the Rural Electric Cooperative As
sociation in San Francisco on the same
day.
Some political observers have view
ed the increasing number of Hum
phrey's public appearances as part
of a drive to gain re-election of the
President and himself in 1968. Jack
Bell, Associated Press political writer,
stated in yesterday's column, "Presi
dent Johnson has given the nod to
Vice-President Hubert H- Humphrey
to help beef up the Democratic Party

jrganization for the 1968 Presidential
race."
Student Protest
The feeling that "Humphrey isn't
coming to be persuaded, but rather to
drum up support for the war," has
led three Stanford students to an
nounce plans to stage a series of dem
onstrations against Humphrey.
Two of the students, Marc Sapir
and Anatole Anton, have announced
that there will be a meeting in the Ex
periment building tonight to "co-ordi
nate" the various forms of protest of
Humphrey's appearance.
The group insists Humphrey "has
no right to impose himself on an aca
demic institution."
They feel that Humphrey offers
"the way to mask a vicious war with
a facade of liberalism."
Furthermore, they add, "we believe
the people in government aren't inter
ested in what we say. They are trying
to build up their power."
"If a college professor who believed
in the war stood up and .gave us hifc

honest reasons for supporting it, we
would listen. We would also listen to
men like Fulbright who is beginning
to grapple with the problems in
volved."
"Humphrey represents the institu
tionalization of liberalism in America
today. He also stands for the estab
lishment of a concept of liberalism
which opposes the individual."
In the Future
Charles Bell has stated that Hum
phrey's appearance in the Focus
series represents part of the Political
Union's attempt to deal with the "prob
lems of poverty and affluence in Amer
ican society, covering viewpoints on
specific areas from the Negro ghettos
to the morality of the United States'
involvement in Southeast Asia.
Future speakers will include Nor
man Thomas on February 28th and
Milton Friedman on March Bth.

Student Opinion
Commenting on the program, Po
litical Union President Charles Bell
said, "We feel that the press-confer
ence format of the scheduled program
will provide an opportunity for the
expression of student opinion on a
variety of topics."
Arrangements for Humphrey's ap
pearance were made well in advance
and coincide with his appearance at
the twenty-fifth anniversary meeting
of the Rural Electric Cooperative As
sociation in San Francisco on the same
day.
Some political observers have view
ed the increasing number of Hum
phrey's public appearances as part
of a drive to gain re-election of the
President and himself in 1968. Jack
Bell, Associated Press political writer,
stated in yesterday's column, "Presi
dent Johnson has given the nod to
Vice-President Hubert H- Humphrey
to help beef up the Democratic Party

jrganization for the 1968 Presidential
race."
Student Protest
The feeling that "Humphrey isn't
coming to be persuaded, but rather to
drum up support for the war," has
led three Stanford students to an
nounce plans to stage a series of dem
onstrations against Humphrey.
Two of the students, Marc Sapir
and Anatole Anton, have announced
that there will be a meeting in the Ex
periment building tonight to "co-ordi
nate" the various forms of protest of
Humphrey's appearance.
The group insists Humphrey "has
no right to impose himself on an aca
demic institution."
They feel that Humphrey offers
"the way to mask a vicious war with
a facade of liberalism."
Furthermore, they add, "we believe
the people in government aren't inter
ested in what we say. They are trying
to build up their power."
"If a college professor who believed
in the war stood up and .gave us hifc

honest reasons for supporting it, we
would listen. We would also listen to
men like Fulbright who is beginning
to grapple with the problems in
volved."
"Humphrey represents the institu
tionalization of liberalism in America
today. He also stands for the estab
lishment of a concept of liberalism
which opposes the individual."
