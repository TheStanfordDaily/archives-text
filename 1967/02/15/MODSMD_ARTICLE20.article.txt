# Huskies' Comeback Downs Tribe, 79-73
## 
### 
The Stanford basketball team
took its second rebuff from the
great Northwest Monday night
as the University of Washing
ton came from behind to beat
the Indians, 79-73. Saturday,
Stanford felt a hot-shooting, high
perched WSU squad, 82-58.
Stanford set a fast pace early
in the game, with Don Griffin in
the lead. Griffin finished the

game with 33 points, high for
the game and the largest total
for a Stanford player this sea
son.
Indian speed kept the Huskies
puffing in the first half. The
Cards once led by 11 points, and
held a 36-28 halftime advantage.
Late Lead Disappears
The Cards led by 8 points with
7 minutes left in the game, but
a flurry of whistles put four top
Cards in foul trouble. Rich Bak
er, Mai MacElwain, Art Harris,
and Howard Hassen were in
jeopardy.
Washington took advantage
of the Indians' predicament, and
threw a press on the court. The
strategy worked, and Hassen
and Harris both netted their
fifth fouls. Harris potted 18
points before he left the game.
Gordy Harris led the Huskies'
comeback with 21 points. Three
other Washington players scored
in double figures.
