## Reply: Construction Vs. Nihilism 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
I'd like to reply to Mr. Schae
fer's piece of slander published
in yesterday's Dally. I accuse
you of distorting the truth, Mr.
Schaefer. Whatever your virtues
are, there's a danger in the kind
of negation your article, where
the truth is sacrificed to drama,
represents. There is no compro
.nise with your sort of nihilism;
it represents a nihilistic intel
lect that has to be answered.
But perhaps I assume too much:
that your article was meant to
be taken seriously, that it
doesn't just represent an at
tempt to practice a certain kind
of rhetoric.
Whatever your intentions, Mr.
Schaefer, I'll answer you as if
you were being serious.
In your article you fail com
pletely to understand the role of
the speaker in LASSU. You
laint him as the Prince, play
ing LASSU off against itself to
his own ends. It almost
suffices to say that that just is
not the case; lunacy of your
sort hardly has to be answered
with an argument.
But 1 have talked with Mr.
Forstenzer on several occasions,
sometimes hours at a time, and
lave found that he has an accu
rate view of the Speaker's role
in the Legislature: (1) to pre
side over the meetings (2) to
report accurately the course of
previous legislation referred to
/arious committees (3) to eli
cit further clarification of the
ssues from other LASSU mem
bers and various committee
members present (say, from the
Committee of Fifteen) (4) to
give his evaluation of the effect
of previous proposals made by
LASSU (5) sometimes making
cautious recommendations, to
Jrge the Legislature to consider
the issues and corresponding
legislation.
It is entirely within his posi
tion to recommend general leg
slation and areas of legislation
to the Legislature, but I must
add that Mr. Forstenzer is cau
tious even here. It has been my
observation that he has never
acted without observing the
consensus of the Legislature,
even demanding, on occasion,
chat the Legislature clarify its
own position. I demand your
apology, Mr. Schaefer, for the
.gnorince you let become inso
lence. Mr. Forstenzer has not

and does not try to deceive the
Legislature, but no argument
can prove that, especially when
fools desire to believe other
wise.
But you heaped verbal excre
tion upon a more important
body, Mr. Schaefer. You have
let yourself believe that legisla
tors would easily be deceived if
someone were trying to deceive
them. Yes, Schaefer, the Legis
lature has shortcomings. Yes,
Schaefer, there are fallible and
unconcerned legislators. But
there are many whose concern
and dedication I have witnessed,
whose alertness and demand for
information I have not matched
and you have not matched. You
owe the Legislature an apology,
Mr. Schaefer. Were you born
without ears to hear and eyes to
see? Yes they are students, yes
they are sometimes unattentive
and docile, but always lied to
and easily deceived?—never!
You mentioned further that
the Speaker doesn't recognize
representatives he knows to be
opposed to his views. Mr. Fors
tenzer is not a mind reared, Mr.
Schaefer. And, may I point out
that it was another representa
tive, not the Speaker, who
raised a Point of Inquiry as to
whether or not your discussion
was out of order, Mr. Forsten
zer having previously ruled you
out of order for not being recog
nized by the chair, but recog
nizing you immediately after
his ruling.
You wonder why Mr. Harris
is unable to attend each of the
LASSU meetings. It is true, Mr.
Schaefer, that he occasionally
has other business at that time.
But the Legislature doesn't re
quire the constant attendance of
Mr. Harris—just as the Con
gress doesn't require the con
stant attendance of President
Johnson — to be effective and
informed. We don't rely on Mr.
Harris in order to function in
the Legislature, Mr. Schaefer,
and those that think we do are
dancing with a chimera. Is the
rhythm suitable, Mr. Schaefer?
But I do share one of your
opinions. It is true and it is sad
that some legislators leave the
meetings after about two hours,
this eventually leaves the rest of
us without a quorum. But you
overlook the fact that most new
legislation is passed during the
Speaker's report. New business

is, in effect, covered there.
May I point out that there has
not been a single piece of legis
lation listed under new business
for the last three meetings —
only because new business is
covered earlier, in the Speaker's
report, or immediately after a
motion has been passed to
change the Orders of the Day
and consider a piece of new
legislation early in the meeting.
But I must admit that occasion
ally pieces of less-important old
business do fail to be considered
adequately, but these are either
tabled or referred to a commit
tee, or appear at the top of the
old business agenda for the next
meeting. You omit the truth for
your own purposes, Mr. Schae
fer.
In closing, Mr. Schaefer, let
me remind you: lies are not
meant for men to hear, if one
can speak otherwise. Use your
energy to be constructive rather
than destructive, to be critical

of LASSU and its members with
an eye to the future, a future
that your present nihilism won't
allow. What is it you want, Mr.
Schaefer? A purge? Better, I
think, a new period of responsi
ble criticism and active leader
ship, a period of attention to
our own shortcomings with a
dedication to student purposes.

• Midnight Horror
Editor, The Daily:
"Midnight Mafia," the Drama
Department's much - publicized
late-night show, opened on Sat
urday at the Nitery Theatre.

Its main attraction was a stu
dent play, Joseph Medalis'
"Sins." "Sins" is the kind of
thing any campus could do with
out. It is one hour of agonized,
hyper-meaningful drooling, a fes
tival of unzipped flies and anal
jokes that masquerades as un
recognized poetry but peters off
into repetitious boredom.
It was kitchen-sink drama that
is really on the level of the out
side drain. A jovial voice in the
audience asked the female lead
to strip: the author got up and
threatened to punch the voice's
nose. He didn't, a fiting climax to
his play.
