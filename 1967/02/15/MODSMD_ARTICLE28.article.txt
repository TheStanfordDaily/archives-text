# 'More Stately Mansions'

Once upon a time, a bold group of men con
ceived of an intrepid plan to propel this uni
versity (in the phrase of the day) "over the edge
of greatness."
With great skill and daring, and with the
aid of a wondrous genie called Pace, they pro
ceeded to gather together the best faculty, the
best students and the best facilities they could
find, then confidently sat back to watch the uni
versity go over the edge.
But when that best faculty and those best
students saw everyone sitting and waiting at
the edge of greatness, and heard that some great
and exciting leap was about to occur, they
walked right over and sat down too, so as to
have a better view of this spectacle. And there,
still, they sit, and wait.
Some six years have passed since Stanford
set about its drive toward excellence; six years
which have seen a dramatic transformation
of the academic fabric of the University. The
faculty has been expanded and enriched until
it compares favorably with any in America; the
student body is freely acknowledged as among
the best; and the research facilities are envied
from coast to coast.
But few will argue that Stanford has yet at
tained that goal of excellence toward which it
strives. Those undefinable but unmistakable
qualities of intellectual excitement and ferment
so necessary to transform an institution from
a school in which skills are transmitted to a Uni
versity in which education is accomplished, are
sadly lacking.
A list of the factors responsible for this failure

would be lengthy, but no small share of the
blame must be laid before the present housing
program. The investigations of the ASSU Hous
ing Commission effectively document the suc
cess of the present program in confining the Uni
versity's educational endeavors within the sand
stone arches of the Quad.
The residential system at Stanford has re
mained almost unaffected by the progress of
the rest of the community, and efforts to im
prove and revitalize it have been sporadic and
uncoordinated. The present system is sadly un
fit to fulfill even the minimal expectations of a
residence university.
That this situation has existed so long is re
grettable; that it should continue, unthinkable.
Yet if meaningful change is to come, bold steps
must be taken. The Wilbur Experiment, pro
posed by the Housing Commission is one, and
should be initiated as soon as possible. But it
must be only the beginning. The present hous
ing system, even while bearing the fraternity
albatross about its neck, can be extensively im
proved at once. And all new construction — in
particular the projected Robert Moore House —
should be carefully examined to assure that past
mistakes are not being repeated.
Major revision and improvement of the resi
dence program will be neither easy nor cheap,
but it can no longer be delayed.
Hopefully the Education Study will devote a
good part of its efforts to formulating a coordi
nated and comprehensive long-range housing
program. Certainly the Housing Commission re
port will give them the best kind of start.
