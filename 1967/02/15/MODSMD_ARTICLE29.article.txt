## Assorted Forward Steps: Positive Rush, Signing-Out 
### Steve Gruber 
Stanford living groups can be
fun — if you live in the right
one.

Congratulations to the girl in
Cardenal House of Florence
Moore Hall. Last Thursday night
she mounted a protest against
social regulations by stealing the
sign-out board. The board is
used by all of the girls in the
house for signing out if they ex
pect to be home later than mid
night.
No sign-out board, no signing
out, she figured. And besides she
wanted to have a few more over
nights. But the Cardenal resident
assistant, Barbara Tinder, quick
ly replaced the board with more
sign-out cards.
Our brave girl took the new
cards and dumped them in the
nearest toilet. Miss Tinder was
still not worried. "We have an
infinite supply of sign-out cards,"
she said.
Fun and Games
Monday night's house meeting
in Cardenal was fun and games.
Nearly all of the girls agreed
that stealing sign-out cards was
immoral, illegal, and fattening.
According to some of my spies
who were present at the meeting,
many of the girls demonstrated
a great real of immaturity. They
asked for a confession, but none
was given.
But our girl came through
yesterday when she tacked up
an anonymous confession on the
Cardenal bulletin board. It was
a simple confession, merely say
ing that the cards had been
thrown away as a protest against
social regulations.
Hopefully, she will not give
up the protest that easily.

Lambda Nu almost switched
to an open rush policy this
spring. But not quite. To remove
some of the guilt connected with
judging fellow students, the
Lambdas have instituted a "posi
tive" rush system.
Individual Rush
According to a statement given
to The Dally by Harry Houston,
the Lambda Nu rush chairman,
"Rush will be conducted in in
dividual rooms, not in the living
room." This is to encourage
more meaningful contact, and,
as such, is commendable.
The statement continues,
"New members will be selected
by positive votes. Each active
will vote for no more than fifteen
freshmen. We anticipate that
many will vote for fewer than

fifteen. Actives are encouraged
to base each vote on a respon
sible knowledge of an individual.
There will be no dings or nega
tives votes, and pressure poli
ticking by actives is discour
aged."
Therefore, each freshman will
have a certain number of votes
after the balloting is completed.
Those with the highest number
of votes will be bid.
Still Has Faults
Certainly this is better than
a straight one-man, one-ding sys
tem, but it still has many of the
faults of the ding system. Lamb
da Nu changed the mechanics
of their rush system, but not the
eventual result.
Lambda Nu is still saying,
"There are certain Stanford stu
dents whom we don't want to
associate with." And that is ex
actly what the fraternities with
ding systems are saying.
There are only three groups
that have admitted the basic
equality of Stanford students.
Beta Chi, Breakers Eating Club,
and El Capitan Eating Club will
allow anyone to join if he wants
to. Why not Lambda Nu?

Speaking of Eating Clubs,
changes in their rush policy may
be made next week. Of the seven
clubs, two — Breakers and El
Capitan — are on a completely
open rush policy. The other five
clubs are still using ding sys
tems. (If a certain percentage,
usually one sixth, of the mem
bers agree that they do not like
a person, he is dinged.)
Draw System
The Inter-Club Council, the or
ganization responsible for the
Eating Clubs, may pass a reso
lution allowing a draw system
for all seven clubs. What this
means is that any freshman who
wants to join an Eating Club
may do so. The strongest oppo
sition will come from El Tigre
and El Toro, two clubs which
are very fraternity-like.
The Eating Clubs have finally
realized that they are no differ
ent from even the most selec
tive fraternities as long as they
have ding systems. The old say
ing, "An Eating Club is a fra
ternity without beds," is true
and will remain so unless a new
rush policy is established.
Living groups are changing,
but they are changing slowly.
One consolation is that situation
is much different now than it
was only two years ago.
