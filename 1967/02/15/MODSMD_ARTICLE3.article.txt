# Experiment Circulates Petition Calling For JFK Death Inquiry
## 
### DAN SNELL 
Members of the Experiment are cir
culating a petition calling for a re
opening of the investigation into the
assassination of President Kennedy.
The petition reads in part, "We feel
the investigation conducted by the

Federal agencies immediately after
the assassination to be inadequate, and
the conclusions drawn by the Warren
Commission to be both hastily conceiv
ed and erroneous."
Peter Friedlander, leader of the Ex
periment's seminar on the assassina

tion drew up the petition. "I'm not
sure the Warren Commission did dupe
the American people," Friedlander
said. "Any malicious motive on the
Commission's part is out of the ques
tion, but they seem to have covefed
up important facts."
Friedlander was not sure the peti
tion would help make the government
launch another investigation. He said
that the signed petitions probably will
be sent to a New York Congressman
who is working to reopen the matter.
"It is important to know all the
facts," Friedlander said, "This petition
really questions the validity of the
claim of America to be an open so
ciety."
Experiment leader Barry Green
burg, asked if the circulation of the
petition is not a new, more political
tack for his organization, replied, "I
don't know what people thought we
were, but we've always aimed at a
philosophy that includes the political."
Friedlander cites growing concern
voiced by Mark Lane and other re
searchers on the assassination as the
reason for Circulating the petition at
this time. Friedlander published an
article In the last issue of the Ex
periment's newspaper Commitment on
his reading about the Warren Report
done as a project in directed reading
in the History Department.
