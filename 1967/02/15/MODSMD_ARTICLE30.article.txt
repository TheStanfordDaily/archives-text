## Harris Rebuts Packer: 'Myopic Insecurity' 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
What astonishes me about the
Stanford community is not the
extent to which it basks in its
own myopic insecurity. What is
impossible to comprehend is
that it finds this myopia a cita
del of reason to be defended at
all costs. The history of at
tempts to change the University
indicate clearly that such a com
munity's first instinct is anality,
not self study.
A case in point is the contro
versy surrounding the Packer
study and most recently Pack
er's letter to the Daily. Mr.
Packer's defense of his proce
dure in choosing student mem
bership for the steering commit
tee of the study seemed to cen
ter around three points:
1. my performance and attend
ance as a member of the Plan
ning Committee,
2. the Planning Committee's fi
nal decisions as to the nature
of the study,
3. and a notion of when repre
sentative participation is vi
able in this University.
Let me take them up in that
order.
I was present at three of the
five meetings of the Planning
Committee. My two absences
were due to other commitments.

The total of six hours I met
with that committee were spent
largely in discussion of how
data for a study was to be gath
ered. Data processing not being
quite my field of expertise, I
found little to agree or disagree
with.
Contrary to the implications
of Herbert Packer's letter I did
in fact raise the issue of how
students for the steering com
mittee were to be selected. Af
ter stating that some means
should be developed that al
lowed the various sectors of the
community to choose those they
thought most suited for the
task. I was told that my state
ment was not germane to the
proceedings at that point and
that this subject would be dealt
with eventually.
As Mr. Packer's letter indi
cates, the subject was indeed
brought up again. Although I
was not present to represent
this viewpoint when the final
decision was made, I don't think
Mr. Packer or the other mem
bers of that committee would
contend that they had no cog
nizance of this argument and
were, because of my absence,
handicapped in any attempt to
reach a resolution. With my
presence or without it, the ques

tion of student participation was
there to be discussed and the
existing situation would tend to
indicate it was dealt with rather
inconclusively.
The solution the Planning
Committee reached was to di
rect the study with a steering
committee free from the biases
and narrow vision of political
contention. To take on this task
they ordained Wallace Sterling,
a party of noteworthy disinter
est and lack of bias, and his
chosen representative, Mr. Pack
er (who didn't miss any meet
ings). Another decision of the
committee, made while I was
present, indicated a unanimous
feeling on the part of the group
that the community had numer
ous mechanisms to deal with
immediate political controver
sies and in no case should the
study involve itself in their so
lution.
Acting in accordance with
that policy, the first problem
Mr. Packer decided to study was
whether or not women should
be allowed to live off campus.
He announced his decision to
place this problem on the com
mittee's immediate agenda in
the midst of a mobilization for
a rent strike. If this is what the
Planning Committee's decisions

for a removed and objective
study mean in action, I find it
difficult to believe this so-called
study is anything more than a
rather complex means of avoid
ing representative and demo
cratic decision making in this
University.
(In his letter, Mr. Packer de
scribed the entire process of in
terviewing. He voices the im
plicit expectation that those who
find the entire context of selec
tion unacceptable will neverthe
less participate. I find such ex
pectation a bit absurd. For the
sake of information it should
also be noted that I was first
notified as to the existence of
those interviews after they were
half finished.)
Finally, we get down to Mr.
Packer's notion that the only
meaning "representation" has is
in the circumstance of the bar
gaining table. He fails to see
that students are different peo
ple than administrators and
faculty members and that in
volved in that difference is a
vision of the University striking
ly unlike that of Mr. Packer and
the man who appointed him.
If in a study one wants a real
interaction of all those views of
the University, the first consider
ation would seem to be the selec

tion by the various cultures in
the community of those deemed
best able to understand the fu
ture of the University. This no
tion of representative gives sim
ple recognition to the diverse
nature of the community and
rightfully assumes that no one
man, however competent, is
capable of choosing without the
bias of his own position. If such
a notion of representation were
to hold sway, it would have to
emanate from the equality of all
parties involved in the study—
which may be Mr. Packer's pri
mary objection.

JOHN MacDONALD
Editor, The Daily:
What astonishes me about the
Stanford community is not the
extent to which it basks in its
own myopic insecurity. What is
impossible to comprehend is
that it finds this myopia a cita
del of reason to be defended at
all costs. The history of at
tempts to change the University
indicate clearly that such a com
munity's first instinct is anality,
not self study.
A case in point is the contro
versy surrounding the Packer
study and most recently Pack
er's letter to the Daily. Mr.
Packer's defense of his proce
dure in choosing student mem
bership for the steering commit
tee of the study seemed to cen
ter around three points:
1. my performance and attend
ance as a member of the Plan
ning Committee,
2. the Planning Committee's fi
nal decisions as to the nature
of the study,
3. and a notion of when repre
sentative participation is vi
able in this University.
Let me take them up in that
order.
I was present at three of the
five meetings of the Planning
Committee. My two absences
were due to other commitments.

The total of six hours I met
with that committee were spent
largely in discussion of how
data for a study was to be gath
ered. Data processing not being
quite my field of expertise, I
found little to agree or disagree
with.
Contrary to the implications
of Herbert Packer's letter I did
in fact raise the issue of how
students for the steering com
mittee were to be selected. Af
ter stating that some means
should be developed that al
lowed the various sectors of the
community to choose those they
thought most suited for the
task. I was told that my state
ment was not germane to the
proceedings at that point and
that this subject would be dealt
with eventually.
As Mr. Packer's letter indi
cates, the subject was indeed
brought up again. Although I
was not present to represent
this viewpoint when the final
decision was made, I don't think
Mr. Packer or the other mem
bers of that committee would
contend that they had no cog
nizance of this argument and
were, because of my absence,
handicapped in any attempt to
reach a resolution. With my
presence or without it, the ques

tion of student participation was
there to be discussed and the
existing situation would tend to
indicate it was dealt with rather
inconclusively.
The solution the Planning
Committee reached was to di
rect the study with a steering
committee free from the biases
and narrow vision of political
contention. To take on this task
they ordained Wallace Sterling,
a party of noteworthy disinter
est and lack of bias, and his
chosen representative, Mr. Pack
er (who didn't miss any meet
ings). Another decision of the
committee, made while I was
present, indicated a unanimous
feeling on the part of the group
that the community had numer
ous mechanisms to deal with
immediate political controver
sies and in no case should the
study involve itself in their so
lution.
Acting in accordance with
that policy, the first problem
Mr. Packer decided to study was
whether or not women should
be allowed to live off campus.
He announced his decision to
place this problem on the com
mittee's immediate agenda in
the midst of a mobilization for
a rent strike. If this is what the
Planning Committee's decisions

for a removed and objective
study mean in action, I find it
difficult to believe this so-called
study is anything more than a
rather complex means of avoid
ing representative and demo
cratic decision making in this
University.

mittee were to be selected. Af
ter stating that some means
should be developed that al
lowed the various sectors of the
community to choose those they
thought most suited for the
task. I was told that my state
ment was not germane to the
proceedings at that point and
that this subject would be dealt
with eventually.
As Mr. Packer's letter indi
cates, the subject was indeed
brought up again. Although I
was not present to represent
this viewpoint when the final
decision was made, I don't think
Mr. Packer or the other mem
bers of that committee would
contend that they had no cog
nizance of this argument and
were, because of my absence,
handicapped in any attempt to
reach a resolution. With my
presence or without it, the ques

tion of student participation was
there to be discussed and the
existing situation would tend to
indicate it was dealt with rather
inconclusively.
The solution the Planning
Committee reached was to di
rect the study with a steering
committee free from the biases
and narrow vision of political
contention. To take on this task
they ordained Wallace Sterling,
a party of noteworthy disinter
est and lack of bias, and his
chosen representative, Mr. Pack
er (who didn't miss any meet
ings). Another decision of the
committee, made while I was
present, indicated a unanimous
feeling on the part of the group
that the community had numer
ous mechanisms to deal with
immediate political controver
sies and in no case should the
study involve itself in their so
lution.
Acting in accordance with
that policy, the first problem
Mr. Packer decided to study was
whether or not women should
be allowed to live off campus.
He announced his decision to
place this problem on the com
mittee's immediate agenda in
the midst of a mobilization for
a rent strike. If this is what the
Planning Committee's decisions

for a removed and objective
study mean in action, I find it
difficult to believe this so-called
study is anything more than a
rather complex means of avoid
ing representative and demo
cratic decision making in this
University.
(In his letter, Mr. Packer de
scribed the entire process of in
terviewing. He voices the im
plicit expectation that those who
find the entire context of selec
tion unacceptable will neverthe
less participate. I find such ex
pectation a bit absurd. For the
sake of information it should
also be noted that I was first
notified as to the existence of
those interviews after they were
half finished.)
Finally, we get down to Mr.
Packer's notion that the only
meaning "representation" has is
in the circumstance of the bar
gaining table. He fails to see
that students are different peo
ple than administrators and
faculty members and that in
volved in that difference is a
vision of the University striking
ly unlike that of Mr. Packer and
the man who appointed him.
If in a study one wants a real
interaction of all those views of
the University, the first consider
ation would seem to be the selec

tion by the various cultures in
the community of those deemed
best able to understand the fu
ture of the University. This no
tion of representative gives sim
ple recognition to the diverse
nature of the community and
rightfully assumes that no one
man, however competent, is
capable of choosing without the
bias of his own position. If such
a notion of representation were
to hold sway, it would have to
emanate from the equality of all
parties involved in the study—
which may be Mr. Packer's pri

Editor, The Daily:
What astonishes me about the
Stanford community is not the
extent to which it basks in its
own myopic insecurity. What is
impossible to comprehend is
that it finds this myopia a cita
del of reason to be defended at
all costs. The history of at
tempts to change the University
indicate clearly that such a com
munity's first instinct is anality,
not self study.
A case in point is the contro
versy surrounding the Packer
study and most recently Pack
er's letter to the Daily. Mr.
Packer's defense of his proce
dure in choosing student mem
bership for the steering commit
tee of the study seemed to cen
ter around three points:
1. my performance and attend
ance as a member of the Plan
ning Committee,
2. the Planning Committee's fi
nal decisions as to the nature
of the study,
3. and a notion of when repre
sentative participation is vi
able in this University.
Let me take them up in that
order.
I was present at three of the
five meetings of the Planning
Committee. My two absences
were due to other commitments.

The total of six hours I met
with that committee were spent
largely in discussion of how
data for a study was to be gath
ered. Data processing not being
quite my field of expertise, I
found little to agree or disagree
with.
Contrary to the implications
of Herbert Packer's letter I did
in fact raise the issue of how
students for the steering com
mittee were to be selected. Af
ter stating that some means
should be developed that al
lowed the various sectors of the
