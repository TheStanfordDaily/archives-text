"To begin at the beginning ..."
Dylan Thomas
Last spring Carl Schmidt and Kit An
derton (as candidates for A.S.S.U. presi
dent and vice-president) proposed that
the A.S.S.U. establish a commission to
examine the entire residence system at
Stanford. After his election as A.S.S.U.
President, David Harris and Jan Jacobi
drc" up plans for an A.S.S.U. Housing
Commission. By the end of spring quar
ter they had established six sub-commit
tees and had chosen two co-chairmen
for each subcommittee.
In early October, the Legislature for
mally structured the Housing Commis
sion. It was to have subcommittees on:
1) the philosophy of the residence uni
versity, 2) the freshman year, 3) frater
nities, 4) independent men's housing, 5)
women's housing, and 6) special proj
ects and research.
Under the leadership of the two co
chairmen, each subcommittee charted
its own course to examine its particu
lar area of the Stanford residence sys
tem — to report back to the Commission
Chairmen when it had finished its study.
Each subcommittee was charged with
the task of examining the present sys
tem, asking the central question: does
it fulfill the obligation of a residence
to educate the students who live within
it; in essence, is educatiqn being carried
from the lecture hall, the seminar room,
the library, to the residence?
After two important administrative
decisions, to amalgamate two commit
tees that had been set up independently
to examine the freshman year (the
Housing Commission subcommittee and
Dean Gordon's Advisory Committee)
and to restructure the fraternity sub
committee (to work for a critical, yet
objective report), the five subcommit
tees that had specific tasks plunged into
a full schedule of meetings and assigned
specific research to committee members.
It was this fact, that these subcommit
tees found it necessary to carry out
their own programs of research, that
led the Commission to abandon plans
for an independent research committee.
After Thanksgiving the work of the
subcommittees bogged down slightly.
However, after a three week rest, sub
committee members returned to their
tasks with renewed vigor. By the end of

January each subcommittee had pre
sented its final report to us. We then
edited these reports into a comprehen
sible whole.
Basic Tenets
In our work we have established two
broad and basic tenets which we feel
must be at the heart of the ideal resi
dence at Stanford.
First, we believe that the residence
university should be our long range goal.
Not only is it practical, but it is the ideal.
While men and women should have the
right to live off-campus, we feel that
each of us must give his best efforts
toward achieving a residence program
that is so exciting and challenging that
each student at Stanford would want to
live on campus — and that there might
be places for every student who would
wish to live on campus. This would mean
more money spent for dormitories, co
operative apartments, or small living
group units — but we feel that this mon
ey should be earmarked for the resi
dence program at Stanford on as high a
level of priority as any academic (class
room space, department offices, etc.) or
any other program. In his convocation
address President Sterling questioned
the basic value and then the financial
practicality of the residence university.
We find that concept not only our ideal,
but also of the first priority financially.
As long as the present residence system
exists at this university, Stanford will
not be an educational community of first
rank.
When we began this study, we had in
mind the possibility of positing our ideal
housing system for Stanford — not just
the residence university, if indeed that
were to be our goal, but how that goal
might be achieved. This has been our
greatest criticism of the university ad
ministration: that it stated its goal as
the residence university, yet approached
that goal in a piecemeal and sometimes
backward fashion. University housing
resembled a patchwork quilt of alterna
tives, none of which seemed to satisfy
anyone — it was a ship without a rud
der, or even a pilot. We still feel this to
be true, yet we have not drawn up our
own plan of what structure the ideal
residence university should resemble.
We have not structured our ideal for
an important reason. We began with the
thought of possibly drawing up plans

for an overall house or college system
that might be set up here. Such systems
have been established with much suc
cess at Harvard and Yale. Yet it was a
very exponent of the Yale system, Dean
Napier, who warned us against impos
ing a system that worked elsewhere onto
our own community. "Stanford has a
spirit, a psyche, all its own," he said,
"and you must not do anything that
might harm or alter or it." We cannot
here today know what will be ideal in a
residence system in twenty years — but
we can know how to begin to approach
our ideal. We have not ev n n done that
in the past. Within the report of the
subcommittee on the freshman year
you will find a proposal for what we
think can feasibly be instituted next
year. If this exp -riment is successful it
can be carried further. From Wilbur we
can carry coed-integrated housing (and
integrated class housing — but sepa
rated by sex if desired) to Stern, Flor
ence Moore, Lagunita, and eventually to
fraternity houses. We have replaced our
structured ideal with a first step. It is
our hope that this first step will lead to
what each of us, as a student, admini
strator, or faculty member considers
his ideal for residential education at
Stanford.
Two Recommendations
In view of the necessity for annual
(perhaps semi-annual), re-evaluation of
the residence system — which facets of
a particular experiment are successful
and which are not; then what'experi
ments are to be attempted the following
year — our first recommendation is that
the Legislature create a permanent
Housing Commission with the power to
review all current experiments, within
the guidelines established by the first
A.S.S.U. Housing Commission, but not
limited by those guidelines.
As the second general recommenda
tion, the Commission urges the Univer
sity to put a total halt on all building
plans (especially the Moore houses and
the third fraternity cluster) until we
have given further thought to our con
cept of the residence university. In this
general area we recommend considera
tion of re-location and possible construc
tion of new dormitory space for the eat
ing clubs.
In this introduction we should like to
comment upon the work of the Fresh

man Year subcommittee. For it has been
truly remarkable. It is not without good
reason that the work of this subcommit
tee comprises a considerable portion of
the final Commission report. Establish
ing a deep rapport in common purpose:
to study the goals of the freshman year
and then to relate them to the residence
question, the students and faculty mem
bers of this committee have given the
community an example of how we
might ideally study many controversial
issues and come to workable conclu
sions as to how to resolve them. We are
indebted to the work of this committee
and wish to accord its members special
recognition.
It would be impossible to list every
person to whom we owe our thanks.
Certainly the subcommittee co-chair
men and committee members are de
serving of our greatest acknowledge
ment; they are listed separately with
their individual committee reports. To
the faculty members who served on
the freshman year subcommittee, Mrs.
Cohen, Dr. Levin, Dean Napier, and Dr.
Osborne, we owe special gratitude for
the numerous occasions they took time
from their already overcrowded sche
dules to meet with that committee. With
out Chris Harte's aid in the final stages
of presenting the report in The Daily
and his constant help throughout, our
work would not have progressed as well
as it did. Rick Levin gave us great help
in drawing up the plans for our experi
mental idea for Wilbur next year. His
wizardry with figures gave rise to the
expression, "Levin's table of random
and movable digits." Craig Schindler
helped us with the final report of the
freshman year subcommittee. To Sue
Horst goes a special note: she helped
out with the final drafting of the frater
nity subcommittee report — her work
in the A.S.S.U. office has been of great
assistance and inspiration to all of us.
Thanks go also to our corps of typists:
Pat Dietterle, Denise Holmes, Kathy
Kaplan, Mimi Ritter, Maureen Jenks,
Pam Patty, Martha Scott, Joanne Quan,

In view of the necessity for annual
(perhaps semi-annual), re-evaluation of
the residence system — which facets of
a particular experiment are successful
and which are not; then what'experi

year — our first recommendation is that
the Legislature create a permanent
Housing Commission with the power to
review all current experiments, within
the guidelines established by the first
A.S.S.U. Housing Commission, but not
limited by those guidelines.
As the second general recommenda
tion, the Commission urges the Univer
sity to put a total halt on all building
plans (especially the Moore houses and
the third fraternity cluster) until we
have given further thought to our con
cept of the residence university. In this
general area we recommend considera
tion of re-location and possible construc
tion of new dormitory space for the eat
ing clubs.
In this introduction we should like to
comment upon the work of the Fresh

man Year subcommittee. For it has been
truly remarkable. It is not without good
reason that the work of this subcommit
tee comprises a considerable portion of
the final Commission report. Establish
ing a deep rapport in common purpose:
to study the goals of the freshman year
and then to relate them to the residence
question, the students and faculty mem
bers of this committee have given the
community an example of how we
might ideally study many controversial
issues and come to workable conclu
sions as to how to resolve them. We are
indebted to the work of this committee
and wish to accord its members special
recognition.
It would be impossible to list every
person to whom we owe our thanks.
Certainly the subcommittee co-chair

the faculty members who served on
the freshman year subcommittee, Mrs.

Osborne, we owe special gratitude for
the numerous occasions they took time
from their already overcrowded sche

out Chris Harte's aid in the final stages
of presenting the report in The Daily

work would not have progressed as well
as it did. Rick Levin gave us great help

"To begin at the beginning ..."
Dylan Thomas
Last spring Carl Schmidt and Kit An
derton (as candidates for A.S.S.U. presi
dent and vice-president) proposed that
the A.S.S.U. establish a commission to
examine the entire residence system at
Stanford. After his election as A.S.S.U.
President, David Harris and Jan Jacobi
drc" up plans for an A.S.S.U. Housing
Commission. By the end of spring quar
ter they had established six sub-commit
tees and had chosen two co-chairmen
for each subcommittee.
In early October, the Legislature for
mally structured the Housing Commis
sion. It was to have subcommittees on:
1) the philosophy of the residence uni
versity, 2) the freshman year, 3) frater
nities, 4) independent men's housing, 5)
women's housing, and 6) special proj
ects and research.
Under the leadership of the two co
chairmen, each subcommittee charted
its own course to examine its particu
lar area of the Stanford residence sys
tem — to report back to the Commission
Chairmen when it had finished its study.
Each subcommittee was charged with
the task of examining the present sys
tem, asking the central question: does
it fulfill the obligation of a residence
to educate the students who live within
it; in essence, is educatiqn being carried
from the lecture hall, the seminar room,
the library, to the residence?
After two important administrative
decisions, to amalgamate two commit
tees that had been set up independently
to examine the freshman year (the
Housing Commission subcommittee and
Dean Gordon's Advisory Committee)
and to restructure the fraternity sub
committee (to work for a critical, yet
objective report), the five subcommit
tees that had specific tasks plunged into
a full schedule of meetings and assigned
specific research to committee members.
It was this fact, that these subcommit
tees found it necessary to carry out
their own programs of research, that
led the Commission to abandon plans
for an independent research committee.
After Thanksgiving the work of the
subcommittees bogged down slightly.
However, after a three week rest, sub
committee members returned to their
tasks with renewed vigor. By the end of

January each subcommittee had pre
sented its final report to us. We then
edited these reports into a comprehen
sible whole.
Basic Tenets
In our work we have established two
broad and basic tenets which we feel
must be at the heart of the ideal resi
dence at Stanford.
First, we believe that the residence
university should be our long range goal.
Not only is it practical, but it is the ideal.
While men and women should have the
right to live off-campus, we feel that
each of us must give his best efforts
toward achieving a residence program
that is so exciting and challenging that
each student at Stanford would want to
live on campus — and that there might
be places for every student who would
wish to live on campus. This would mean
more money spent for dormitories, co
operative apartments, or small living
group units — but we feel that this mon
ey should be earmarked for the resi
dence program at Stanford on as high a
level of priority as any academic (class
room space, department offices, etc.) or
any other program. In his convocation
address President Sterling questioned
the basic value and then the financial
practicality of the residence university.
We find that concept not only our ideal,
but also of the first priority financially.
As long as the present residence system
exists at this university, Stanford will
not be an educational community of first
rank.
When we began this study, we had in
mind the possibility of positing our ideal
housing system for Stanford — not just
the residence university, if indeed that
were to be our goal, but how that goal
might be achieved. This has been our
greatest criticism of the university ad
ministration: that it stated its goal as
the residence university, yet approached
that goal in a piecemeal and sometimes
backward fashion. University housing
resembled a patchwork quilt of alterna
tives, none of which seemed to satisfy
anyone — it was a ship without a rud
der, or even a pilot. We still feel this to
be true, yet we have not drawn up our
own plan of what structure the ideal
residence university should resemble.
We have not structured our ideal for
an important reason. We began with the
thought of possibly drawing up plans

for an overall house or college system
that might be set up here. Such systems
have been established with much suc
cess at Harvard and Yale. Yet it was a
very exponent of the Yale system, Dean
Napier, who warned us against impos
ing a system that worked elsewhere onto
our own community. "Stanford has a
spirit, a psyche, all its own," he said,
"and you must not do anything that
might harm or alter or it." We cannot
here today know what will be ideal in a
residence system in twenty years — but
we can know how to begin to approach
our ideal. We have not ev n n done that
in the past. Within the report of the
subcommittee on the freshman year
you will find a proposal for what we
think can feasibly be instituted next
year. If this exp -riment is successful it
can be carried further. From Wilbur we
can carry coed-integrated housing (and
integrated class housing — but sepa
rated by sex if desired) to Stern, Flor
ence Moore, Lagunita, and eventually to
fraternity houses. We have replaced our
structured ideal with a first step. It is
our hope that this first step will lead to
what each of us, as a student, admini
strator, or faculty member considers
his ideal for residential education at
Stanford.
Two Recommendations
In view of the necessity for annual
(perhaps semi-annual), re-evaluation of
the residence system — which facets of

Not only is it practical, but it is the ideal.
While men and women should have the
right to live off-campus, we feel that
each of us must give his best efforts
toward achieving a residence program
that is so exciting and challenging that
each student at Stanford would want to
live on campus — and that there might
be places for every student who would
wish to live on campus. This would mean
more money spent for dormitories, co
operative apartments, or small living
group units — but we feel that this mon
ey should be earmarked for the resi
dence program at Stanford on as high a
level of priority as any academic (class
room space, department offices, etc.) or
any other program. In his convocation
address President Sterling questioned
the basic value and then the financial
practicality of the residence university.
We find that concept not only our ideal,
but also of the first priority financially.
As long as the present residence system
exists at this university, Stanford will
not be an educational community of first
rank.
When we began this study, we had in
mind the possibility of positing our ideal
housing system for Stanford — not just
the residence university, if indeed that
were to be our goal, but how that goal
might be achieved. This has been our
greatest criticism of the university ad
ministration: that it stated its goal as
the residence university, yet approached
that goal in a piecemeal and sometimes
backward fashion. University housing
resembled a patchwork quilt of alterna
tives, none of which seemed to satisfy
anyone — it was a ship without a rud
der, or even a pilot. We still feel this to
be true, yet we have not drawn up our
own plan of what structure the ideal
residence university should resemble.
We have not structured our ideal for
an important reason. We began with the
thought of possibly drawing up plans

for an overall house or college system
that might be set up here. Such systems
have been established with much suc
cess at Harvard and Yale. Yet it was a
very exponent of the Yale system, Dean
Napier, who warned us against impos
ing a system that worked elsewhere onto
our own community. "Stanford has a
spirit, a psyche, all its own," he said,
"and you must not do anything that
might harm or alter or it." We cannot
here today know what will be ideal in a
residence system in twenty years — but
we can know how to begin to approach
our ideal. We have not ev n n done that
in the past. Within the report of the
subcommittee on the freshman year
you will find a proposal for what we
think can feasibly be instituted next
year. If this exp -riment is successful it
can be carried further. From Wilbur we
can carry coed-integrated housing (and
integrated class housing — but sepa
rated by sex if desired) to Stern, Flor
ence Moore, Lagunita, and eventually to
fraternity houses. We have replaced our
structured ideal with a first step. It is
our hope that this first step will lead to
what each of us, as a student, admini
strator, or faculty member considers
his ideal for residential education at
Stanford.
Two Recommendations
In view of the necessity for annual
(perhaps semi-annual), re-evaluation of
the residence system — which facets of
a particular experiment are successful
and which are not; then what'experi
ments are to be attempted the following
year — our first recommendation is that
the Legislature create a permanent
Housing Commission with the power to
review all current experiments, within
the guidelines established by the first
A.S.S.U. Housing Commission, but not
limited by those guidelines.
As the second general recommenda
tion, the Commission urges the Univer
sity to put a total halt on all building
plans (especially the Moore houses and
the third fraternity cluster) until we
have given further thought to our con
cept of the residence university. In this
general area we recommend considera
tion of re-location and possible construc
tion of new dormitory space for the eat
ing clubs.
In this introduction we should like to
comment upon the work of the Fresh

man Year subcommittee. For it has been
truly remarkable. It is not without good
reason that the work of this subcommit
tee comprises a considerable portion of
the final Commission report. Establish
ing a deep rapport in common purpose:
to study the goals of the freshman year
and then to relate them to the residence
question, the students and faculty mem
bers of this committee have given the
community an example of how we
might ideally study many controversial
issues and come to workable conclu
sions as to how to resolve them. We are
indebted to the work of this committee
and wish to accord its members special
recognition.
It would be impossible to list every
person to whom we owe our thanks.
Certainly the subcommittee co-chair
men and committee members are de
serving of our greatest acknowledge
ment; they are listed separately with
their individual committee reports. To
the faculty members who served on
the freshman year subcommittee, Mrs.
Cohen, Dr. Levin, Dean Napier, and Dr.
Osborne, we owe special gratitude for
the numerous occasions they took time
from their already overcrowded sche
dules to meet with that committee. With
out Chris Harte's aid in the final stages
of presenting the report in The Daily
and his constant help throughout, our
work would not have progressed as well
as it did. Rick Levin gave us great help
in drawing up the plans for our experi
mental idea for Wilbur next year. His
wizardry with figures gave rise to the
expression, "Levin's table of random
and movable digits." Craig Schindler
helped us with the final report of the
freshman year subcommittee. To Sue

in the A.S.S.U. office has been of great

"To begin at the beginning ..."
Dylan Thomas
Last spring Carl Schmidt and Kit An
derton (as candidates for A.S.S.U. presi
dent and vice-president) proposed that
the A.S.S.U. establish a commission to
examine the entire residence system at
Stanford. After his election as A.S.S.U.
President, David Harris and Jan Jacobi
drc" up plans for an A.S.S.U. Housing
Commission. By the end of spring quar
ter they had established six sub-commit
tees and had chosen two co-chairmen
for each subcommittee.
In early October, the Legislature for
mally structured the Housing Commis
sion. It was to have subcommittees on:
1) the philosophy of the residence uni
versity, 2) the freshman year, 3) frater
nities, 4) independent men's housing, 5)
women's housing, and 6) special proj
ects and research.
Under the leadership of the two co
chairmen, each subcommittee charted
its own course to examine its particu
lar area of the Stanford residence sys
tem — to report back to the Commission
Chairmen when it had finished its study.
Each subcommittee was charged with
the task of examining the present sys
tem, asking the central question: does
it fulfill the obligation of a residence
to educate the students who live within
it; in essence, is educatiqn being carried
from the lecture hall, the seminar room,
the library, to the residence?
After two important administrative
decisions, to amalgamate two commit
tees that had been set up independently
to examine the freshman year (the
Housing Commission subcommittee and
Dean Gordon's Advisory Committee)
and to restructure the fraternity sub
committee (to work for a critical, yet
objective report), the five subcommit
tees that had specific tasks plunged into
a full schedule of meetings and assigned
specific research to committee members.
It was this fact, that these subcommit
tees found it necessary to carry out
their own programs of research, that
led the Commission to abandon plans
for an independent research committee.
After Thanksgiving the work of the
subcommittees bogged down slightly.
However, after a three week rest, sub
committee members returned to their
tasks with renewed vigor. By the end of

January each subcommittee had pre
sented its final report to us. We then
edited these reports into a comprehen
sible whole.

"To begin at the beginning ..."
Dylan Thomas
Last spring Carl Schmidt and Kit An
derton (as candidates for A.S.S.U. presi
dent and vice-president) proposed that
the A.S.S.U. establish a commission to
examine the entire residence system at
Stanford. After his election as A.S.S.U.
President, David Harris and Jan Jacobi
drc" up plans for an A.S.S.U. Housing
Commission. By the end of spring quar
ter they had established six sub-commit
tees and had chosen two co-chairmen
for each subcommittee.
In early October, the Legislature for
mally structured the Housing Commis
sion. It was to have subcommittees on:
1) the philosophy of the residence uni
versity, 2) the freshman year, 3) frater
nities, 4) independent men's housing, 5)
women's housing, and 6) special proj
ects and research.
Under the leadership of the two co
chairmen, each subcommittee charted
its own course to examine its particu
lar area of the Stanford residence sys
tem — to report back to the Commission
Chairmen when it had finished its study.
Each subcommittee was charged with
the task of examining the present sys
tem, asking the central question: does
it fulfill the obligation of a residence
to educate the students who live within
it; in essence, is educatiqn being carried
from the lecture hall, the seminar room,
the library, to the residence?
After two important administrative
decisions, to amalgamate two commit
tees that had been set up independently
to examine the freshman year (the
Housing Commission subcommittee and
Dean Gordon's Advisory Committee)
and to restructure the fraternity sub
committee (to work for a critical, yet
objective report), the five subcommit
tees that had specific tasks plunged into
a full schedule of meetings and assigned
specific research to committee members.
It was this fact, that these subcommit
tees found it necessary to carry out
their own programs of research, that
led the Commission to abandon plans
for an independent research committee.
After Thanksgiving the work of the
subcommittees bogged down slightly.
However, after a three week rest, sub
committee members returned to their
tasks with renewed vigor. By the end of

January each subcommittee had pre
sented its final report to us. We then
edited these reports into a comprehen
sible whole.
Basic Tenets
In our work we have established two
broad and basic tenets which we feel
must be at the heart of the ideal resi
dence at Stanford.
First, we believe that the residence
university should be our long range goal.
Not only is it practical, but it is the ideal.
While men and women should have the
right to live off-campus, we feel that
each of us must give his best efforts
toward achieving a residence program
that is so exciting and challenging that
each student at Stanford would want to
live on campus — and that there might
be places for every student who would
wish to live on campus. This would mean
more money spent for dormitories, co
operative apartments, or small living
group units — but we feel that this mon
ey should be earmarked for the resi
dence program at Stanford on as high a
level of priority as any academic (class
room space, department offices, etc.) or
any other program. In his convocation
address President Sterling questioned
the basic value and then the financial
practicality of the residence university.
We find that concept not only our ideal,
but also of the first priority financially.
As long as the present residence system
exists at this university, Stanford will
not be an educational community of first
rank.
When we began this study, we had in
mind the possibility of positing our ideal
housing system for Stanford — not just
the residence university, if indeed that
were to be our goal, but how that goal
might be achieved. This has been our
greatest criticism of the university ad
ministration: that it stated its goal as
the residence university, yet approached
that goal in a piecemeal and sometimes
backward fashion. University housing
resembled a patchwork quilt of alterna
tives, none of which seemed to satisfy
anyone — it was a ship without a rud
der, or even a pilot. We still feel this to
be true, yet we have not drawn up our
own plan of what structure the ideal
residence university should resemble.
We have not structured our ideal for
an important reason. We began with the
thought of possibly drawing up plans

for an overall house or college system
that might be set up here. Such systems
have been established with much suc
cess at Harvard and Yale. Yet it was a
very exponent of the Yale system, Dean
Napier, who warned us against impos
ing a system that worked elsewhere onto
our own community. "Stanford has a
spirit, a psyche, all its own," he said,
"and you must not do anything that
might harm or alter or it." We cannot
here today know what will be ideal in a
residence system in twenty years — but
we can know how to begin to approach
our ideal. We have not ev n n done that
in the past. Within the report of the
subcommittee on the freshman year
you will find a proposal for what we
think can feasibly be instituted next
year. If this exp -riment is successful it
can be carried further. From Wilbur we
can carry coed-integrated housing (and
integrated class housing — but sepa
rated by sex if desired) to Stern, Flor
ence Moore, Lagunita, and eventually to
fraternity houses. We have replaced our
structured ideal with a first step. It is
our hope that this first step will lead to
what each of us, as a student, admini
strator, or faculty member considers
his ideal for residential education at
Stanford.
Two Recommendations
In view of the necessity for annual
(perhaps semi-annual), re-evaluation of
the residence system — which facets of
a particular experiment are successful
and which are not; then what'experi
ments are to be attempted the following
year — our first recommendation is that
the Legislature create a permanent
Housing Commission with the power to
review all current experiments, within
the guidelines established by the first
A.S.S.U. Housing Commission, but not
limited by those guidelines.
As the second general recommenda
tion, the Commission urges the Univer
sity to put a total halt on all building
plans (especially the Moore houses and
the third fraternity cluster) until we
have given further thought to our con
cept of the residence university. In this
general area we recommend considera
tion of re-location and possible construc
tion of new dormitory space for the eat
ing clubs.
In this introduction we should like to
comment upon the work of the Fresh

man Year subcommittee. For it has been
truly remarkable. It is not without good
reason that the work of this subcommit
tee comprises a considerable portion of
the final Commission report. Establish
ing a deep rapport in common purpose:
to study the goals of the freshman year
and then to relate them to the residence
question, the students and faculty mem
bers of this committee have given the
community an example of how we
might ideally study many controversial
issues and come to workable conclu
sions as to how to resolve them. We are
indebted to the work of this committee
and wish to accord its members special
recognition.
It would be impossible to list every
person to whom we owe our thanks.
Certainly the subcommittee co-chair
men and committee members are de
serving of our greatest acknowledge
ment; they are listed separately with
their individual committee reports. To
the faculty members who served on
the freshman year subcommittee, Mrs.
Cohen, Dr. Levin, Dean Napier, and Dr.
Osborne, we owe special gratitude for
the numerous occasions they took time
from their already overcrowded sche
dules to meet with that committee. With
out Chris Harte's aid in the final stages
of presenting the report in The Daily
and his constant help throughout, our
work would not have progressed as well
as it did. Rick Levin gave us great help
in drawing up the plans for our experi
mental idea for Wilbur next year. His
wizardry with figures gave rise to the
expression, "Levin's table of random
and movable digits." Craig Schindler
helped us with the final report of the
freshman year subcommittee. To Sue
Horst goes a special note: she helped
out with the final drafting of the frater
nity subcommittee report — her work
in the A.S.S.U. office has been of great
assistance and inspiration to all of us.

can be carried further. From Wilbur we
can carry coed-integrated housing (and
integrated class housing — but sepa
rated by sex if desired) to Stern, Flor
ence Moore, Lagunita, and eventually to
fraternity houses. We have replaced our
structured ideal with a first step. It is
our hope that this first step will lead to
what each of us, as a student, admini
strator, or faculty member considers
his ideal for residential education at
Stanford.
Two Recommendations
In view of the necessity for annual
(perhaps semi-annual), re-evaluation of
the residence system — which facets of
a particular experiment are successful
and which are not; then what'experi
ments are to be attempted the following
year — our first recommendation is that
the Legislature create a permanent
Housing Commission with the power to
review all current experiments, within
the guidelines established by the first
A.S.S.U. Housing Commission, but not
limited by those guidelines.
As the second general recommenda
tion, the Commission urges the Univer
sity to put a total halt on all building
plans (especially the Moore houses and
the third fraternity cluster) until we
have given further thought to our con
cept of the residence university. In this
general area we recommend considera
tion of re-location and possible construc
tion of new dormitory space for the eat
ing clubs.
In this introduction we should like to
comment upon the work of the Fresh

man Year subcommittee. For it has been
truly remarkable. It is not without good
reason that the work of this subcommit
tee comprises a considerable portion of
the final Commission report. Establish
ing a deep rapport in common purpose:
to study the goals of the freshman year
and then to relate them to the residence
question, the students and faculty mem
bers of this committee have given the
community an example of how we
might ideally study many controversial
issues and come to workable conclu
sions as to how to resolve them. We are
indebted to the work of this committee
and wish to accord its members special
recognition.
It would be impossible to list every
person to whom we owe our thanks.
Certainly the subcommittee co-chair
men and committee members are de
serving of our greatest acknowledge
ment; they are listed separately with
their individual committee reports. To
the faculty members who served on
the freshman year subcommittee, Mrs.
Cohen, Dr. Levin, Dean Napier, and Dr.
Osborne, we owe special gratitude for
the numerous occasions they took time
from their already overcrowded sche
dules to meet with that committee. With
out Chris Harte's aid in the final stages
of presenting the report in The Daily
and his constant help throughout, our
work would not have progressed as well
as it did. Rick Levin gave us great help
in drawing up the plans for our experi
mental idea for Wilbur next year. His
wizardry with figures gave rise to the
expression, "Levin's table of random
and movable digits." Craig Schindler
helped us with the final report of the
freshman year subcommittee. To Sue
Horst goes a special note: she helped
out with the final drafting of the frater
nity subcommittee report — her work
in the A.S.S.U. office has been of great
assistance and inspiration to all of us.
Thanks go also to our corps of typists:

"To begin at the beginning ..."
Dylan Thomas
Last spring Carl Schmidt and Kit An
derton (as candidates for A.S.S.U. presi
dent and vice-president) proposed that
the A.S.S.U. establish a commission to
examine the entire residence system at
Stanford. After his election as A.S.S.U.
President, David Harris and Jan Jacobi
drc" up plans for an A.S.S.U. Housing
Commission. By the end of spring quar
ter they had established six sub-commit
tees and had chosen two co-chairmen
for each subcommittee.
In early October, the Legislature for
mally structured the Housing Commis
sion. It was to have subcommittees on:
1) the philosophy of the residence uni
versity, 2) the freshman year, 3) frater
nities, 4) independent men's housing, 5)
women's housing, and 6) special proj
ects and research.
Under the leadership of the two co
chairmen, each subcommittee charted
its own course to examine its particu
lar area of the Stanford residence sys
tem — to report back to the Commission
Chairmen when it had finished its study.
Each subcommittee was charged with
the task of examining the present sys
tem, asking the central question: does
it fulfill the obligation of a residence
to educate the students who live within
it; in essence, is educatiqn being carried
from the lecture hall, the seminar room,
the library, to the residence?
After two important administrative
decisions, to amalgamate two commit
tees that had been set up independently
to examine the freshman year (the
Housing Commission subcommittee and
Dean Gordon's Advisory Committee)
and to restructure the fraternity sub
committee (to work for a critical, yet
objective report), the five subcommit
tees that had specific tasks plunged into
a full schedule of meetings and assigned
specific research to committee members.
It was this fact, that these subcommit
tees found it necessary to carry out
their own programs of research, that
led the Commission to abandon plans
for an independent research committee.
After Thanksgiving the work of the
subcommittees bogged down slightly.
However, after a three week rest, sub
committee members returned to their
tasks with renewed vigor. By the end of

January each subcommittee had pre
sented its final report to us. We then
edited these reports into a comprehen
sible whole.
Basic Tenets
In our work we have established two
broad and basic tenets which we feel
must be at the heart of the ideal resi
dence at Stanford.
First, we believe that the residence
university should be our long range goal.
Not only is it practical, but it is the ideal.
While men and women should have the
right to live off-campus, we feel that
each of us must give his best efforts
toward achieving a residence program
that is so exciting and challenging that
each student at Stanford would want to
live on campus — and that there might
be places for every student who would
wish to live on campus. This would mean
more money spent for dormitories, co
operative apartments, or small living
group units — but we feel that this mon
ey should be earmarked for the resi
dence program at Stanford on as high a
level of priority as any academic (class
room space, department offices, etc.) or
any other program. In his convocation
address President Sterling questioned
the basic value and then the financial
practicality of the residence university.
We find that concept not only our ideal,
but also of the first priority financially.
As long as the present residence system
exists at this university, Stanford will
not be an educational community of first
rank.
When we began this study, we had in
mind the possibility of positing our ideal
housing system for Stanford — not just
the residence university, if indeed that
were to be our goal, but how that goal
might be achieved. This has been our
greatest criticism of the university ad
ministration: that it stated its goal as
the residence university, yet approached
that goal in a piecemeal and sometimes
backward fashion. University housing
resembled a patchwork quilt of alterna
tives, none of which seemed to satisfy
anyone — it was a ship without a rud
der, or even a pilot. We still feel this to
be true, yet we have not drawn up our
own plan of what structure the ideal
residence university should resemble.
We have not structured our ideal for
an important reason. We began with the
thought of possibly drawing up plans

for an overall house or college system
that might be set up here. Such systems
have been established with much suc
cess at Harvard and Yale. Yet it was a
very exponent of the Yale system, Dean
Napier, who warned us against impos
ing a system that worked elsewhere onto
our own community. "Stanford has a
spirit, a psyche, all its own," he said,
"and you must not do anything that
might harm or alter or it." We cannot
here today know what will be ideal in a
residence system in twenty years — but
we can know how to begin to approach
our ideal. We have not ev n n done that
in the past. Within the report of the
subcommittee on the freshman year
you will find a proposal for what we
think can feasibly be instituted next
year. If this exp -riment is successful it
can be carried further. From Wilbur we
can carry coed-integrated housing (and
integrated class housing — but sepa
rated by sex if desired) to Stern, Flor
ence Moore, Lagunita, and eventually to
fraternity houses. We have replaced our
structured ideal with a first step. It is
our hope that this first step will lead to
what each of us, as a student, admini
strator, or faculty member considers
his ideal for residential education at
Stanford.
