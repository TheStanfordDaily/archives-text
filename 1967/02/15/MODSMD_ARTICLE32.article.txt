The Commission dedicates its work to
two individuals who have made this re
port possible.
For Maurice M. Osborne, Jr.
In perhaps the most moving tribute
to the late President Kennedy, George
Hunt wrote that the greatest quality
the President had possessed was that he
could respond with warmth to the
warmth he evoked in others. There are
few amongst us indeed who have this
magical quality of human understand
ing. But when you meet such a person
you recognize that quality in him in
stantly. So it is with Dr. Osborne. We
have known him for but a short time —
yet it is as though he has always been
a long and trusted friend.
For David Harris
"He broke fresh ground — because,
and only because he had the courage to
go ahead without asking whether others
were following or even understood ... "
"When the morning's freshness has
been replaced by the weariness of mid
day, when the leg muscles quiver under
the strain, the climb seems endless, and
suddenly, nothing will go quite as you
wish — it is then that you must not
hesitate." — Dag Hammarwkjold
