# The 						Philosophy Of The Residence University
## 
### 
To examine the concept of a residence
university is first to inquire into the
nature of education. And to make that
inquiry is to ask not about the univer
sity but about the individual. For the es
sence of education does not consist in
reading, in going to classes, in writing
papers, but rather invisibly and intan
gibly in the changing and developing
mind of the individual. Education is the
assimilation of knowledge and skills into
the mental faculties of a single person.
It is the disciplining of a mind, the de
velopment of a feeling for scientific and
scholarly methodology. It is the realiza
tion within the individual of conceptual
Ideas such as order, freedom and justice.
It is the development of self-confidence,
the discovery of wisdom, the honing of
the personal creative instinct. It is, in
short, the solitary growth of conscious
ness.
But although education ultimately oc
curs in the mind of the individual, that
mind cannot grow and change without
stimuli from the external world. Before
the individual can know, he must first
perceive. And before he can gain under
standing and ultimately wisdom, he
must first be exposed to a variety of
thought and experience and be challeng
ed to reconcile and synthesize that which
is before him. The function of a univer
sity becomes, then, not to educate per se,
but rather to provide as open, challeng
ing, and stimulating an environment as
possible in which individuals can best
pursue the creative process of self-edu
cation.
By proclaiming itself a university,
Stanford implicitly accepts as its objec
tive to provide for individual students
such an environment. By proclaiming
itself a residential university, Stanford
asserts that that environment should ex
tend beyond the classroom into an in
dividual's living situation, "that living
and learning, social and intellectual life,
should not be separate but together."
(Stanford University Bulletin, p. 47.)
Through its residence system, the Uni
versity promises a climate in which the
total individual can learn and grow.
Evidence from socio - psychological

studies of student life indicates that the
dominant influence on an individual's
development during his college years is
exerted by his peer group, with such in
fluences as books and professors rating
as secondary factors. It is in the con
frontation with another person — simi
lar to him in that he is a student but of
a different background and with differ
ent values and beliefs — that the in
dividual begins to find himself and be
gins to realize the variety of dimensions
in man. His own ideas and beliefs are
challenged and rechallenged, changed
and rechanged, and in the process he
comes to know other people (and him
self) as more than amalgamations of
roles. Moreover, the same confrontation
brings deeper understanding and broad
er and more varied perspectives to the
ideas and concepts presented through
the formal curriculum, making the in
tellectual life relevant and attractive to
the individual.
The optimum situation for encourag
ing such confrontation seems to be a
group characterized by frequent contact,
similar concerns, divergent opinions
and attitudes, and a sense of community.
This last is difficult to define, but might
be described as the difference between
being among friends or among strang
ers. Its basis is an emphasis on the dig
nity and worth of each individual and
on cooperation rather than competition.
In such a community the social barriers
which prevent others from seeing one's
true thoughts are relaxed. Individuals
learn to confide in each other not only
their ideas and opinions, but their emo
tional feelings and attitudes as well.
Little attention is given to externally de
rived status. Each person must stand as
an individual and be judged as a total
human being; each person must discover
a personal as opposed to a group iden
tity. Within the community students and
faculty together share a concern for in
tellectual and personal growth and are
jointly involved in the pursuit of knowl
edge and wisdom. In such a community,
interest in the academic, intellectual and
human dimensions of education flour
ishes naturally, for each follows from

the multi-faceted curiosity and intense
self-questioning that the environment
would engender.
Commitment to this ideal of commu
nity must be the goal of a residential
university. Without such a commitment
Stanford will continue to be an institu
tion of rigid and detrimental dicho
tomies between education and resi
dences, between a student's intellectual
and social lives.
Recent criticisms of the University
have focused on these dichotomies in the
area of housing. The fraternity system
has been attacked, from both within and
without, as an anachronism and a hin
drance to Stanford's development as an
intellectual community. Repeatedly, Wil
bur Hall has been criticized as impairing
the intellectual and personal growth of
its residents, perpetuating a high
school value orientation, and impeding
the freshman's assimilation into the Uni
versity. Common to both these residence
systems, and in fact to the whole of
Stanford residences, is the failure to see
the student and his university in terms
of total education. Rather than compre
hending the student's experiences as an
integrated whole, the classroom and the
residence, the student's social and intel
lectual interests, his personality and in
tellect are seen as separate, mutually
exclusive factors.
To eliminate this educational fragmen
tation, Stanford must dedicate itself to
creating communities which fuse these
seemingly diffuse elements into an in
ter-connected whole. We maintain that
the expansion of the intellect deepens
and complements interpersonal relation
ships; that the pursuit of knowledge, too
often seen narrowly as a function of the
classroom, cannot be divorced from the
development in the student of mature
and thoughtful values; and that in a
university residential community the
knowledge and intellectual insight pre
sented in the formal academic curricu
lum and the experiences and personal
interaction of a living group cannot be
separated, but rather intertwine and
stimulate each other.
It is the intent of the Housing Com
mission to direct attention to University

residences as an agent of this integra
tive function. In this study we have con
sidered the relationship of Stanford
residences to the individual student's
total education. We have evaluated liv
ing groups and the quality of student
life therein not primarily by their rele
vance to the demands placed on students
by society or to the present standards
and definitions students hold about
themselves, but by their relevance to
a community of learning and personal
development.
Our purpose, we would emphasize, is
not to make students "work harder,"
spend more time in "useful" pursuits,
engage more often in "intellectual" ac
tivities, or imitate the faculty, the per
fect graduate student, or any other mod
el. Our intention, rather, is to question
the irrelevant and unnecessary pres
sures and restrictions that exist within
the Stanford residence system, and to
recommend innovations that would en
hance the quality of life at Stanford.
Many of the influences which prevent
Stanford living groups from developing
into vital educational communities are
beyond the scope of this study. Exces
sively heavy academic work loads and
the insistence of many graduate and
professional schools on superior aca
demic performance leads many students
to view "good grades" as the sole reward
of university life. Other inhibiting fac
tors continue to exist, however, only as
a result of tradition, habit, group pres
sure, or lack of creative effort.
In this study the Housing Commission
has attempted to point out these inhibit
ing elements and, in considering the
residential system as a whole and as an
integral part of Stanford education, has
presented ideas, programs, and general
proposals. We are confident that with
serious and thoughtful re-evaluation of
the residences and earnest co-operation
of the entire Stanford community, Stan
ford residences can realize the ideal of
community and enhance and profoundly
intensify the meaning of a Stanford ed
ucation.
