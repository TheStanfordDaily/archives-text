# Report Of The Freshman Year Committee
## 
### 
Doubts of the ability of Stanford's
present educational system to provide
for the needs of its students, and speci
fic questions about the relevance of
the residence program in its present
form, have stimulated students, faculty,
and staff to seek more appropriate
solutions.
The A.S.S.U., concerned about the
quality of residential experience at
Stanford — particularly in contrast to
that at the Overseas Campuses —
created through its Legislature a Hous
ing Commission, one task of which was
to review and make recommendations
concerning the freshman residence
program in its relation to education.
At about the same time, Associate
Dean of Students Robert Gordon was
asked to present proposals for a new
model of freshman residential educa
tion.
Both A.S.S.U. and Dean Gordon al
most simultaneously appointed com
mittees in the early Fall of 1966 to ad
vise them in the making of recommen
dations in this important area, and
rather than continue a too-familiar pat
tern of separate committees working
independently (and often divergently)
it was decided to merge the two.
In the merger, the Dean's Advisory
Committee agreed to accept the A.S.S.U.
invitation to become an integral part,
of its group. Dean Gordon agreed to
accept the report of the entire group
in the same light as he would have the
recommendations of his originally ap
pointed committee, and the merged
group in turn agreed to attempt in
good faith to assist him in meeting his
deadlines and obligations as best it
could.
Despite particular questions existing
about the Sponsor system, the Commit
tee felt from the outset that to limit
its discussions and report to such par
ticulars, or to start out with them,
would be to avoid the main Issues sur
rounding ,the quality and meaning of

residential education at Stanford, par
ticularly the freshman program.
The Committee thus firmly decided
that it would start from a fresh con
sideration of the issues and principles
involved, relating its recommendations
to them. It was recognized that such
an approach would be time consuming,
that it might seem Utopian to some;
yet a critque and basic statement about
the ideas of a residence university
seemed vital for future planning and
growth.
At the same time, the practical ne
cessity for more immediate recommen
dations and action was realized. The
present report is in this sense a pre
liminary, or interim report, which at
tempts to set forth and justify some
practical recommendations for residence
programs that could be adopted in
1967-68 — steps within the framework
of progression towards a more ideal
situation.
The Case for the Residential Commu
nity — The Personal Committment to
Learning
The impossibility of considering the
freshman experience in isolation from
the life and purposes of the entire un
dergraduate program has been a ma
jor premise in the subcommittee's
study of the Freshman Residence Pro
gram. Two main assumptions underlie
this approach.
One is that the university experience,
as a whole, is only one part of the con
tinuum of the educational process, a
process which neither begins nor ends
at the university gates. The educational
ideals should be the same for all four
undergraduate years in terms of what
they declare for the growth of persons.
The freshman year is only a step in
a span of development, having a spe
cial function as the first step but not
a separate one.
The second is a new conception which
views the university as a community
for learning through personal, interac
,tjon, find development,. .nsp, of

all its facilities for education. This view
emphasizes that the classroom, library
or laboratory cannot — indeed does not
even now — have a monopoly on pro
viding for the education and develop
ment of students. Else, why a residen
tial university? Why not subcontract
all residential arrangements and avoid
hotel problems?
The Committee felt strongly that
there was urgent need for institutional
endorsement of the fact that without
growth and development in personal,
social, and emotional dimensions, the
achievements of intellect are shallow
and stand in isolation from the indivi
dual and his world. The conviction that
gives personal meaning to knowledge
is a product of direct human relation
ship, and we make far too little use
of its potential.
In a more settled and comfortable
past, with much greater mutuality of
expectations and values both between
peers and between generations, the ur
gency of such questions was less, the
scope more limited and the answers
more predictable. The bull-session quite
effectively handled many aspects of
this personal-social side of development.
For this, and other reasons, relatively
little formal attention to it was felt
to be necessary, aside from some for
mal lectures on hygiene, the evils of
sex and booze, and the Fundamental
Standard. After all, boys were (and
would be) boys, and pretty soon they'd
grow up into men, producers and fa
thers. Home and society would take
care somehow that they grew up right,
and the college would provide an ac
cepted transition station on the way,
some academic input, and try to keep
the lid on boyish spirit getting out of
hand.
By contrast today, for many students
questions about one's nature, and about
one's relationship to an uncertain
world, and about this world itself are
more insistent, and more pre-occupying
.before The V&iefttipns a#?, -real,

and require believable answers from
within the individual. And, until he can
find them, this quest, this preoccupa
tion has top priority, while academics
suffer through seeming less relevant.
And though there are many students
who are relatively unconcerned about
such questions, we feel their total edu
cation would be enriched if they could
be purposefully involved.
The history of formal didactic at
tempts to speak to these burning ques
tions is rather dismal, and all over the
country, there has been a steady atro
phy of required, and even of voluntary
courses relative to personal hygiene,
sex, morals, and behavior. Both stu
dents and educators sense that because
a viable set of personal ethics and
values just grow within the individual,
attempts simply to impose them from
without are relatively futile.
Not only have curricular approaches
to such questions atrophied (happi
ly!), but American education is nearing
the end of a decade in which the entire
necessity of addressing itself to the
problem of personal growth has been
quite deliberately rejected. Sputnik was
the symbol, and such spokesmen as
Hyman Rickover took up the cudgels,
with articulate and seathing denuncia
tions of "Education for Living" — of
concepts of "adjustment," and insisted,
along with many others, on intellectual
excellence (for "excellence" read "a
chievement") as the right, and only
purpose of education.
Growth of population; of national
wealth with its stimulus to upward so
cial mobility; increasing complexity
and diversity of knowledge with its
concommitant of faculty pre-occupa
tion and relatively-narrower fields; and
increased competition have sharpened
the pressures for achievement, leaving
even loss time, thought, or energy for
development as a person.
The need to pay most serious atten
tion to this is most keenly felt by many
studetitfi hy their eldprs.
